And it's around 12 hours later than usual because I usually post around midnight but last night I wasn't in the state to post it hahaha
“Yes, Cas, I’m sure. Let’s just buy coffee and some food and I’m good to go.” Cas was still looking at him with doubt and worry. “If I’m tired, I’ll let you drive this time, okay?” he said finally, getting into the car. Cas’ mouth formed into small smile. Dean said he’d let him drive. That means he’s not mad anymore. At least, not as much as he was before.
“Hello, what can I get you?” they all looked at the waiter. Dean swallowed loudly. It was him. No amount of weed would make him relaxed enough to not be a little bit nervous around his crush.
“I’m free tomorrow night.” Cas said, but then added quickly “But we can find time next week too, I just thought- Nevermind, sorry.”
He sat up and glanced at the other bed, where Cas was asleep. Dean couldn't recall ever seeing him like that. Maybe that's because he never did. Cad looked so peaceful. This time Winchester allowed himself to smile fondly at the sight. He forgot about his nightmare right away. Cas was right here.
Dean tried. Tried to control himself. It was their first kiss. He felt like he’s dreaming. So when he subconsciously put his hand on Cas’ tie and tried to take it off, he almost gasped in surprise. Almost, because his lips were preoccupied. He expected Cas to protest, when his tie was no longer on his neck. But the angel eagerly joined, taking Dean’s jacket and shirt off. Woah.
I remember that I was struggling with coming up with the idea for this one, hopefully it counts as 'comfort' hah
"You don't have to do that, Dean." Cas said but Dean just shot him a look. A look that said: shut up and drink your water, I'm happy to do this for you.
“You too.” he said and they were silent for a moment. “Is this awkward?” he then added, feeling a bit weird.
“Yay, food!” Charlie exclaimed. She was probably the highest of them all. She was already up, going to the front door and putting her shoes on.
“You good, Sammy?” Dean asked his younger brother, of course thinking it was his first time smoking. It wasn’t. And he wasn’t
“So what?” Dean found himself not really caring if Cas notices. But that lasted a moment, after which he came back to reality. “I’m hungry.” he said again.
“Anyone wanna tell me how this happened? And when?” Sam asked, motioning between Cas and Dean. “Who finally had the guts to make the first move?” he was really curious, but he said it in rather teasing tone. And, who was he kidding, Dean was not gonna tell him anything.
“Cas, listen to me. You can cry and still have hope, okay? But we will get him back.” Dean’s other hand gripped Castiel’s cheek and moved his head in his direction, and Cas looked at Dean, surprised. “You have no idea... “ he trailed off. “Every time I lost you, I was a mess. I couldn’t cope with that. But then every time you came back, even when I really lost all hope.
They all placed their orders and Cas went away, with Dean observing him. Cas was in a really well-fitting pair of black jeans, and a white polo shirt that they were supposed to wear in the diner, and a red apron. And he looked good. Like always. His dark hair all messy. But the thing about him Dean liked the most, in appearance, were his eyes. So blue and bright and… deep and nice and Dean was so in love with those eyes. He also loved Castiel’s sense of humor and the way he got confused when he didn’t understand a joke or a reference. Or how smart he was and he seemed to know every fact there is about everything. And he was so nice and helpful to people. They talked quite a lot. But not long, because Cas was always working. And Dean never had the guts to ask him out, even as friends. And when they weren’t talking and Dean was in the diner, he liked to observe him. He knew all his cutest smiles and expressions. And he was a little creeped out by himself, but he didn’t care.
“Yeah.” Charlie nodded and then started laughing. Then she got all serious. “Guys!” she exclaimed. “What if we all got magic powers, like, like wizards- Like, what if we were supposed to go to Hogwarts but we never got out letters?!” she seemed really concerned about this, which was really funny to the rest of the group.
Anyway, we're at 20 o.o And I have a lot more already written and I am so surprised I stuck to this lmao (I think once I write all of them I'll try posting more often than once a week, but there's still a long way haha)
Cas just looked at him for a moment, and then, without a warning, he smashed his lips into Dean’s. It was unexpected. And aggressive. And Dean hesitated for a second, but then he was kissing Cas back. Dean figured, he needed some kind of comfort, and if this was the way to give it to him, he really wasn’t complaining. Although that was not exactly how either of them imagined doing this.
died and got stuck in the Empty for you, so that you could live, and then immediately after that you just went and died?” he raised his eyebrows. Now Dean felt bad. He didn’t even think about it that way.
Cas went to sleep. And Dean had to gather all the self-control he had not to look at him. Because that morning in the motel, he discovered that watching sleeping Cas was his new creepy guilty pleasure. So he woke Cas up. It’s not like angel needed to sleep, right?
The kiss, at the beginning slow and unsure, turned into hot, passionate and deep. Soon it was full-on make out session.
“Dean.” Cas rolled his eyes, but there was a fond smile on his face. “You know I’m not interested in anyone but you.”
“Hey, guys, are you-” they heard Sam behind them. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, people are dying, we don’t have time for that.” he sounded annoyed and Dean could swear he could
“Only if we let it be.” Dean answered, opening the car door for Cas. He was acting way more confident than he felt. “So how about dinner?”
“I think you need a good luck kiss, too. Just to be safe.” Dean said, linking their lips again, although this time Cas couldn’t contain a laugh.
“Right.” he tried to focus, but he couldn’t help looking at Cas from time to time. Was that a crush? Was that normal for a man his age? He felt like he was a teenager. But then he realized that his teenage self would make a move if he liked someone. So why couldn’t he do that now? He was afraid that if Cas didn’t feel the same way, things would be awkward. But they overcame so much, surely they would overcome that, too, right?
All four of them were sitting around a table, in a bar, dressed in suits. Dean and Cas on one side of the table, Jack and Sam opposite them. They were holding bottles of beer, and seemed very relaxed and happy, which was quite unusual for them. For once, there was no threat of the world ending, and they could just do what they normally did. Hunt things and save people.
got himself killed again. And that's when their argument began. Older of the Winchester brothers was just scared to lose Castiel again, and getting angry was the only way he knew to deal with all that.
But he understood all that just about a month later and he was so shocked that he hadn't noticed that before…
“But you thought I can never feel exactly how you do, because I’m not human.” Cas interrupted. Dean nodded, lowering his gaze to the ground. “In a sense you were right. Normally, angels don’t feel human emotions.”
Not sure if this counts as “on a place of insecurity” but this came to my mind and it seemed pretty cute, although I didn’t write it exactly how I originally planned and I have mixed feelings about it (there are also moments that I now find a bit cringy but I don't feel like changing it now lol)
Cas put his coat in the backseat. Dean glanced at him and damn. He had just his white shirt with loose blue tie underneath that coat. Dean thought back to their hunt. And the way Cas looked when he was fighting. He was always observing Cas in situations like that. And every damn time he found himself attracted to the angel more and more. There was just something about how badass he was. And hot. And now he was sitting in Dean’s car, next to him, without his cute stupid trench coat that was always covering his awesome body. I mean, he knew it was just a vessel, but to him, this was Cas. Awesome, handsome, hot, badass, powerful, strong, beautiful, kind, sometimes stupid and stubborn and thinking he’s always right and then doing something wrong, but always with good intentions… his Cas.
At first he tried to deny it. Whenever he would feel that way, or catch himself thinking something he shouldn’t, he would force himself to focus on something else. And usually he could, with the world constantly ending. He had something to occupy his mind. But then it was finally peaceful, at least for a while, and his feelings just grew and got more intense. And he couldn’t pretend like they don’t exist anymore.
He pressed one more chaste kiss to Castiel’s lips before grabbing his hand and walking towards their motel room.
“I knew you had the guts to ask him out.” Benny finally said. “Well, really I didn’t, but good for you.”
Almost forgot to post it haha (doing it a few hours later anyway XD) because the end of the semester is near and I'm swamped lol
It was hours later when they all decided to take a break. And this time Dean suggested that he can put back the books they didn’t need anymore. Of course with that Cas agreed to help. But once they were far enough from Sam, who was trying not to fall asleep at the table, Dean put his books on the floor and dragged Cas behind a shelf.
“I just wanna say, you gotta relax a bit. It’s nothing.” Sam was clearly amused, while Cas just looked between them with a frown.
mad.” after those words he kissed Cas again. “Don’t” he started saying between kisses. “do that” another kiss. “ever” and another “again.”
Suddenly, he had a very dumb idea. He pulled over. Cas’ confused stare met his again. But before the angel could ask anything, hunter grabbed Cas’ tie and pulled him closer. And then their lips met. To say Castiel was shocked was an understatement. For a moment he forgot to breathe. He was on earth long enough to know what this means. He was human once. But he was so surprised that he couldn’t move. Dean was starting to panic. Maybe this was dumber idea than he thought. He wanted to pull away, but then Cas kissed him back. Hunter smiled, deepening the kiss. It was the best, the most intimate, desperate, full of love and finally released tension, and so, so hot kiss. Dean was dizzy from all the feelings that overwhelmed him in that moment.
Before Dean even really registers what happened, Cas is kind of freaking out. “Oh, Dean I'm so sorry! How could I have been so careless? I knew we should have brought these outside. It’s everywhere! Where are your extra napkins?” Cas had spilled a small line of ice cream down the seat and Dean tries to stop him from going for the glovebox, but Cas is determined to clean up the small mess that you would think is an entire pie smeared into the leather by how he's reacting. “No Cas, it's fine, just don't open the….glovebox.” There, for all the world to see, is a roll of condoms and a, decent sized but still mini, bottle of lube.
Cas's reverie is interrupted by Dean sounding a bit uneasy. “Well, we should talk about something.” Cas thinks for a moment, tilting his head and squinting into the distance again. “We could talk about why you deny yourself things that make you happy.” Dean scrunches up his face again. “I don't do that.”
Cas jumps every time tongue meets flesh. “Ohhhh.” Dean wraps his lips around the end of Cas's length and Cas takes in a sharp breath and tenses all his muscles. “J-jackpot!” Dean breaths out a laugh and can't stop his lips curling back bringing his teeth in contact with Cas. He pulls off and lets out a hot breathy chuckle. “You can't make me laugh while I'm doing this or you'll get teeth.”
Dean sinks down onto Cas's cock painfully slowly. He breaths in through his nose and descends lower. He wills his throat to open and his eyes water with the effort. He's not sure how he manages it but he hollows his cheeks and sucks in as he pulls up. His lips slide over the newly slicked tip and he lets them graze the very end. It's almost a kiss but so soft. “See the difference?” There is gravel in his words and it almost comes out as a growl.
Dean’s tone turns a bit defensive and Cas remembers why he was being careful of his words before. His goal was to calm Dean out of a nightmare, not argue with him. However, Dean's tone is still temperate and he hasn't moved away so their shoulders are still touching. “Yeah but, you’re in a dude. I mean, your vessel is a dude.”
Dean's mouth falls open as he watches Cas push dark black forms from his back. The base where the forms are spilling out is glowing with white hot grace and Dean starts to make out the bones that construct the frames of the wings. There are no feathers yet, just black skeletal structures unfolding.
He sighs as the tension about this plan leaks out of him at the enthusiastic message. Cas wants to meet him. He shoots back a quick “10 min?”, hoping that doesn't seem too eager. He gets an instant reply of “That's far too long Dean! Though I would like you to drive safely, I have to admit it will be torture waiting that long. Do you need my address again? Have you left yet? Are you on the road?” Dean can't help but laugh excitedly at Cas’s reaction. It's exactly what he was hoping for. This is gonna be awesome.
Dean looks down awkwardly, considerably more uncomfortable now. Cas turns back to the lake, internally mourning the loss of the easy comfort they had just moments prior. “You shouldn’t apologize. I found it extremely pleasant. This is pleasant too. I can see the appeal of this dream.”
Dean punctuates a thrust and positions it perfectly to hit right in that little bundle of nerves inside his Angel. Cas's eyes shoot open and his head falls back as he yells out long and loud. His wings tense and every feather is on end.
There's no way he'd be shopping this early in the morning anyway, the entire place is practically vacant. Dean's only there at 7am because if he was home, he'd be typing in far too specific searches online for dark haired, blue eyed, Cecealia porn. He'd gotten nothing but frustration when none of the results came close enough to the vivid image in his mind of icy blue surrounded by deep purple, azure, and cobalt. Yeah, Dean actually looked up the words to describe the right colors, and ok, physical attraction may have been a big factor in not being able to move on.
Dean slides his hands over Cas's ribs then curves them back and down making Cas lift his hips off the bed unintentionally. He pulls Cas's dress pants down using Cas's involuntary movements to make it easier. He pulls them completely off and lets them fall from the side of the bed, making a splashing sound as they slip from the edge of the dock into the water.
Dean doesn't delay for a second. “Yes sir!” He actually likes how commanding Cas can get and secretly hopes to see more of that happen in the future. He reaches out and runs his hands through Cas’s feathers. Cas’s body shivers as he makes sure he's lined up. He starts to sink down and Dean digs his hands deep into the insides of Cas’s wings massaging bone and tendon.
Cas writhes under him, unsure how to react to the sudden passion after so much tenderness. Dean moves down to Cas's collar bone and smirks as he tosses Cas's loose tie aside. He thanks his past self for keeping it on. He likes the blue contrast against Cas's olive skin and it makes his eye color pop when they burst open.
Sam tries to convince Dean to stop for the night multiple times and is confronted each time with eye rolls and tensed muscles. He gives up after a loud bark from Dean about dropping it and a swerve of the wheel that Sam's almost surprised doesn't flip the car. Sam is left to ponder why Dean is insisting on driving for eight hours after being awake for practically two days straight already. However, arguing with him about it proves futile every time. He figures the ride is much more pleasant, albeit unsafe, once he just accepts that they're not stopping for anything.
Cas takes a deep breath and starts flapping his wings wildly which lifts him up off of Dean making them both cry out. Cas’s hips pendulate and Dean curves his back as they seep into a heated rhythm.
It's like all of his brain cells are exploding at once in an eruption of color. He's seeing things that he's never been able to see before. It's almost as if his mind can't comprehend what's happening to him. It's as if his brain has to create something new, that's never existed before, to hold this moment in so he doesn’t collapse into a black hole and suck everything up with him into nothingness like a dying star. He doesn't have a concept of time anymore, but the next thing he knows, he's opening his eyes.
When Dean fails to speak, Cas doesn't skip a beat in derailing Dean's ability to think again by saying in his perfect gaveled, smoke soaked voice, “Dean. It's good to finally see you. Why didn't you tell me you were so devastatingly attractive?” His tone is light and he slaps his hand down on Dean's bicep and squeezes before turning to Baby and leaning down to her level as he slides his hands over her black shining surface. “Now this one, I already knew was stunningly gorgeous, but it's an entirely different experience seeing her in person. May I?”
He doesn't even care that his neck is bent against the door or that Cas’s head is also bent forward to prevent him from hitting the ceiling. Eventually however, these things start to be an issue. Cas calls it before Dean and pulls out so they can scramble to change positions and get Cas back inside of him where be belongs. They end up with Cas seated in the middle of the bench with his legs sprawled out and Dean straddling him while holding onto the back of the seat. Dean’s breath catches as the new angle plunges Cas deeper than he's been and Dean can't help but move his hips in tiny circles to feel Cas’s cock rub deep inside of him making sparks light behind his eyes.
Sam smiles back by scrunching his lower lip up. He looks at how Dean’s laying on Cas, basically using him as a body pillow, and his smile grows wider. “You gonna stay out here with him all night?” Cas answers quickly and confidently. “Yes. Unless he wakes up and chooses to move.”
Dean freezes in place and stares at Cas, stunned. Cas frantically bucks his hips up seeking the lost friction from Dean stilling his motions. Cas looks down with unease, afraid he's said something wrong. “Dean? I...I'm sorry. I-it just came out. I didn't mean to...”
Dean thinks things over for a long time, leaving Cas drowning in anticipation, worried he's said the wrong thing. Cas was hoping their conversation was enough to allow that question, but he could have easily misread the situation.
Dean intends to inch his way back up but his eyes sink down to Cas's cock. It's standing at attention and aching to be touched. His mind goes blank for a second before it's flooded with thoughts of the delicious sounds and movements he could pull from Cas if he put his mouth there.
It feels good for Cas to see Dean like this, so peaceful and comfortable in the safety of his dream sanctuary. He could sit like this for years. However, he hears the sound of a door opening in the distance and knows they’re about to be interrupted by Sam. He clings to the remaining minutes he has before he’ll undoubtedly need to leave the dream to assure Sam everything is fine. He wonders briefly if this will ruin the shaky balance they've built up to and he'll have to start over. He's not even sure what he's starting over, but it may take some work to get Dean back to a place where he can get that close to him again.
Cas creeps forward and slides in close almost touching Dean’s lips with his. He stops short and looks over Dean’s face with hooded eyes. Dean’s lips curve upwards as he realizes Cas isn’t going to close the gap this time either. Dean hums and bites Cas’s bottom lip before pressing in. He moves up on his elbows for leverage.
Blue Eyes leans in ever closer and his lips graze Dean's ear as he speaks, making all of Dean's muscles tense with arousal, "I would like to take you to bed Dean. I would like to spend days worshipping your spectacular body and getting to know your exceptional mind. But I have a mess to clean up, and you surely have friends and family who would search for you and find you here."
Cas almost sounds like he's conducting an interview now, but Dean is taken aback by the question anyway. “What?! First of all, that’s not a better way to say physical contact... and second, fuck no I wouldn’t let Jimmy comfort me physically.” Dean uses air quotes to emphasize his point.
Cas seems stiffen and get slightly uncomfortable for a moment, but then sinks back into Dean’s arms. “You don't think them ugly? They're not like other angel wings. Not many angel wings are black.” Dean looks down at his hand gliding across Cas’s dark feathers. “Whoever made you think these are ugly is a jealous idiot. I love that they're black, it's so you. I don't think I'd like them as much if they were a different color.” Dean laughs outright before continuing. “Eh, who am I kidding? I'd love them no matter what color they were. They're yours so they're perfect. But yeah, black is awesome.”
Cas’s eyes wonder over Dean’s form without his consent and he wonders what else his body will do without his permission. Apparently being in such close proximity to humans causes a lack of control over his own vessel. “He cares about you. He enjoys seeing you happy.”
Dean moves his hands to Cas's back and scratches lightly when they dip low causing Cas's wings to shiver. Dean is getting more and more used to the sound they make when they do that, and he's starting to think he won't be able to live without it. His breathing picks up and he clutches tighter, pulling them impossibly closer.
Dean feels Cas clench around him and can't help but let out his own ecstasy-filled yell of approval. He pounds into Cas relentlessly, feeling every sound it punches out of him deep in his chest, and it's the single most gratifying moment he's ever experienced. Until Cas yells his name.
Dean is relishing in every movement and sound. He realizes he wants Cas to tremble under his caress. He wants him to beg for more. “I want to hear you say I can have anything I want in this dream, Castiel.”
The Cecaelia looks surprised, but pleased, and somewhat questioning as he asks, "Are you not? I have no leverage to prevent you from telling anyone."
He waits until Blue Eyes is far enough down the road that he probably won't hear the roar of his engine. Even in this circumstance he can't fault his Baby for sounding so pretty when her engines gets going. It's really too bad she isn't sentient and he can't just date his beloved car instead of chasing down random dudes from the grocery store, but here we are. He only lets one car get between them at any given time and watches closely for unexpected turns. The guy’s a very cautious driver and it makes it incredibly easy to tail him. He ends up stopping in the parking lot of a conference building. The signs out front say something about Cecelia Language and History, as well as some other Halfling subjects, and Dean realizes Sam sent him a link to this event when he was still being extra preachy about Hanging rights. Dean had to physically shake Sam and explain that he's preaching to the freaking choir and he needs to knock it off already.
Dean smirks. “Ok, we’re delving into some pretty deep chick flick territory. Let’s maybe change the subject, huh?” Cas sits quietly looking out at the lake and marveling again at Dean’s subconscious attention to detail.
Dean can't make out everything but every so often he hears the words 'Dean', 'Yes', 'Please', a very slurred version of ‘Jackpot', and something he doesn't understand but it keeps being repeated. 'Ozien' and 'Sam eve la ji Coreda zod izoda'. Or something.
It's awkward getting both their clothes off, there's more than one bumped knee and elbow, but Cas is on a mission, and once he has Dean in the same spread out position, only this time sans clothes, he stops to take Dean in. It would be another embarrassing moment for Dean if Cas didn't look so hungry for him. The way Cas’s eyes rake over him is like a drug to watch. It builds the anticipation until Dean's basically vibrating with it. Cas leans in and squeezes Dean's inner thighs again, the sensation that much more intense now, and Dean can't help but buck his hips, pushing his erection into the air in search for friction. He's never been this hard in his life and Cas is in no better condition.
Half hard and embarrassed as all hell, Dean drives right past the guy as his pimp mobile is inching into a parking space. He decides to devise an actual plan while he's at work and try his luck that night. He's gotta be able to figure out a good reason to be at a school, that won't fall apart as a lie later, while also not making him end up committing to anything like taking actual classes. He's got all day to figure it out. He'll think of something.
Cas has turned serious, but soft, eyes on Dean and he feels like he could fucking fly. The worry about what they did and how it would affect their friendship, and what Dean actually wants hadn’t really had a chance to sink in for Dean, but he knows as soon as the words leave Cas’s mouth, he wants the same thing. An exasperated, relieved, and excited, “Awesome.” Is all Dean can get out, but it seems to be enough for Cas because he absolutely beams at Dean before scooching closer and placing his hand on Dean's thigh lightly. “Now, I believe we have a car show to get to.” Dean squeezes Cas’s hand before putting Baby into reverse and pulling back out of their spot. “Fuck yeah we do.”
Before Cas can argue and defend the Winchesters choices, Dean digs his fingers in a little deeper as he pets Cas's wing. “These wings, Cas. Damn they're awesome. I wish you could keep them out all the time.”
With Cas now on top of him, he slides his legs together and pulls Cas's legs apart by the back of his knees. Cas is now mounting him and he bucks up making Cas have to stabilize himself by putting his hands firmly on Dean's chest.
Cas can't take it anymore and he pulls Dean down towards him. Dean complies, unable to hold back and he grinds down. “Damn Cas, why do you gotta make it so hard?” Cas reciprocates Dean's motions, rubbing up against him with vigor. “You're the one who's making it hard Dean.” Cas's tone is serious and he bucks up into Dean again showing him how true his statement is.
Dean scoffs and, though Cas isn't sure if that is a good thing or not, Dean seems to have relaxed more and his shoulder is brushing Cas's again. Dean shrugs and scoffs again but this time it's lighter. “Huh. Go figure, so the younger one is the most mature.”
To Dean's surprise and elation, they're smiling at each other, and though this guy's grin is small and tight, it conveys a lot of emotion through such a small variation of facial muscles. Dean follows the line of thought from genuine contentment to something else in his eyes and, before he knows it, the beautiful Ceceilea is shaking his head and dispelling the happy trance they seemed to be under.
Cas growls loudly and in one fluid movement he scoops Dean up and almost throws him on his back. It’s Cas’s turn to be the predator and he crawls over Dean with his wings fully extended. Dean’s expression softens and he lays back to be devoured. After all, he did pretty much ask for this, teasing his angel like that. What else could he have expected?
Cas's eyes roll back in his head and he pushes his hips forward. Dean's heated exhalation is causing Cas to come unhinged. “Yes, t-teeth is good.” Cas is obviously delirious and doesn't know what he's saying anymore.
Days later, try as he might, Dean can't get the guy out of his head. As stupid as he feels for admitting it to himself, he'd had an instant connection with him. He tried to convince himself it was just attraction, but he's been hot for plenty of people and always has been able to move on easily. Anyone else with that short of an interaction with Dean wouldn't even be a blip on the radar. No, this is different. Dean knows he's screwed and he has no idea what to do about it.
Cas nods slowly as a few tears spill over his cheeks and Dean’s chest could literally burst right now knowing somehow he did it, somehow he got enough words out to show Cas how much he means to him. He smiles contentedly and Cas buries his face in Dean’s shoulder as they start to quicken their pace.
He moves his hand to Cas’s ribs and pulls him in closer. When Cas stirs and cuddles in, Dean can hear the rustling of feathers and looks down to see one wing draped over him keeping his torso warm while the sheet is covering his legs.
He takes a deep breath and opens the door, trying to keep his eyes away from Cas, just in case. He risks a glance once he's settled and Cas is beaming at him again, which is only a little less tempting than rubbing himself on the seats. “I'll take that ride now.” Dean feels like his jaw drops into his own lap at the implication and he's half tempted to jump into Cas's arms and ride him until his legs give out. But Cas keeps talking. “The show doesn't begin for some time, I know you were referring to a ride there, but perhaps we could take a drive before then? I'd say we should get a bite to eat, but there will be plenty of food options at the show, and I'm partial to those types of foods when they're available.”
Dean appreciates his brother keeping him informed, but he already knows all of this. It's obvious in his every day life. He's broken up more fights that should've ended in a hate crime lawsuit against the offender, than he can count. But in Kansas, hate crimes against Halfling people usually get thrown out or there's only a small fine anyway so it's not even really worth the pursuit.
Cas turns his attention to the lake and stares into the distance. “You stirred in your sleep and called out my name.” Dean rolls his eyes. “Awww man, were you watching me sleep again?” Cas turns back to him, keeping his tone even and light to match the quality of their surroundings. “You don't remember falling asleep on the couch?” Dread slowly seeps into Dean’s face. “Oh, oh yeah. Now I do. Sorry about that...”
This is love, in its purest form. This is a love that legends are made of. A love that is talked about for centuries. The guy literally went to hell and back for him, sacrificed everything for him, turned his back on the only family he's ever known for him.
Cas whimpers causing Dean to break out into a bright smile again. “Fuck, I love how ready you are.” Dean leans in and explores Cas’s hip with one of his hands causing Cas to start writhing again. “Remember...Stay. With. Me.”
Cas studies Dean’s face, probably wondering why he's just standing there sporting a dopey smile. “Are you alright Dean?” Cas’s eyes are full of concern and Dean knows that he probably looks worse then he feels, which is saying something. He shrugs and waves Cas off nonchalantly. “Yeah Cas, just tired and I’ve got this monster headache that I can’t get to go away.” Dean chuckles at his unexpected use of the word ‘monster’, considering they were just fighting actual ones less than 24 hours ago. He pinches the bridge of his nose and let’s out a tense sigh.
While Dean is caught up in fruitless schemes, the Ceceilea finishes his meal and starts his car. Dean might not be very creative, but he's determined as hell. Maybe if he follows the guy to somewhere else other than the grocery store, he could find an easier in. He rushes to his car, throws the few bags he's carrying into the back seat, and tries to will his beautiful engine to be quiet while starting up this time. His classic 67’ Impala isn't exactly the best option for tailing someone unnoticed, but the guy didn't seem any the wiser as he cautiously pulls out of his space.
Dean takes a deep breath, which is more of an exasperated sigh, and he gives in. “Yeah Cas, I'm way more comfortable with you ok? Are ya happy?” Cas smiles confidently. “Yes.” Dean can't help but look back and be reminded of Cas’s reaction to burgers when Famine caused him to have an uncontrollable craving for them.
Dean feels like he's being torn in half. He gasps for air and clutches at Cas's back trying to hold on through this whirlwind of feelings that is taking him over. Tears start to well up as he thinks how little he deserves what he's experiencing. This incredible creature so willing to lay down his life for him after surviving centuries, is more than he can handle.
This statement rings in Cas's ears. Dean is so adamant and sure of it that Cas’s mind goes blank on how to respond. The Winchesters barely trust each other, and after everything that's happened between them, it's incredible that Dean can say that with such conviction.
A sonic pulse is released from him and it causes another huge wave to ripple out from the dock and flood the shores surrounding them as Cas comes. It's the most beautiful thing Dean has ever witnessed. He can barely register the heated coil rising in his stomach, but then Cas clenches around Dean tighter then he thought possible. It's the perfect thing to push him over the edge and he falls against the bed and arches his back, pushing in as deep as he can go.
Dean looks dazed as he grips tight to Cas's coat, still trying to calm himself. “W-what? I’m dreaming?” He grapples with the concept, still clinging desperately to Cas’s coat as if Cas would disappear as soon as he let go.
Cas looks down at Dean’s face, expecting him to open his eyes. He notices worry lines starting to form on Dean's forehead, at least, Cas thinks they're worry lines. He finds himself wondering why he didn't pay more attention to human interaction through the ages. He could've been an expert by now and would be able to comprehend Sam and Dean’s actions instead of so many things escaping his understanding.
It’s the growl that does him in. Cas’s muscles all tense and his hands squeeze Dean where he holds him, but the sound Cas makes right into Dean's ear has him spilling over untouched as he clenches down. Cas comes tumbling after Dean and his already bruising grip tightens even more for a moment before they both go lax in each other's arms. Once the orgasm fog clears, Dean realizes he probably won't be able to sit comfortably for a while, not only due to his sore ass, but also the place just below his ass cheeks that Cas gave so much squeezing attention to. He kind of loves it.
Dean smirks knowing exactly what to say to that. “What kind of righteous man of yours would I be if I didn’t make sure?” Cas’s entire body tenses and he yells out so loud it feels like everything starts shaking around them. “Ozien Samevelaji Coredazodizoda!” He starts to come undone and stops thinking.  He can barely put another sentence together but manages to huff out a demanding request. “Dean, t-t-touch m-my w-… my wings.”
Dean is still pumping Cas steadily. Then he twists his hand and curves it around the head, knowing how good that feels when he does it to himself. Cas yells out those same words. “Samevelaji Coredazodizoda!” Dean’s fingers tingle as if those words are causing electricity to flow into him wherever he's touching Cas. “Yes Cas, ok. Tell me what that means.”
Cas has a smug smile as he notices Dean’s instant reaction to hearing his name said like that. Dean tenses his entire body “Oh fuuck. Uhh you’re killin’ me! The lube is all the way over there!” Cas leans in again and his voice sounds like gravel. There’s still a hint of impatience in his tone but it’s mostly self-assured playfulness. “It’s a dream Dean.” He then licks up Dean’s ear and teethes the edges just like Dean did to him earlier. “And teeth aren’t always bad.”
Dean retorts quickly. “You think you being an Angel of the Lord makes it better? Doing anything with you is like corrupting the purest thing. Actually, a lot of times that's pretty hot. Like corrupting the pastors daughter but on a whole new holy level.”
“Cas what the hell? At least pull your underwear over your dick so no one sees it.” Dean's loud whisper makes Cas laugh outright. “Why Dean? Are you jealous?” Dean looks down at the ground shyly and before he can stop himself it slips out. “And what if I am?” Cas looks back warmly, giving Dean more than butterflies before he hobbles over to a nearby trashcan, picking up their mostly empty cups from where he apparently set them down, and disposing of the condom inside one while smashing the other one onto it, effectively hiding that they're was ever a condom in the first place.
Dean reaches up again and strokes the primary feathers, still gentle but more forceful this time. Cas growls loudly and practically falls onto Dean's chest with his face buried in Dean's shoulder. Dean smiles and repeats the action, letting his fingertips brush the wing tips.
Dean turns his head toward Cas slightly. “So what did Sam have to say?” Cas answers quickly, disappointed he is ‘back at square one’ as Dean would say. “He thought I was sleeping and was concerned. He was getting food to bring back to his room.” Dean’s eyes grow wide. “Oh yeah, we skipped dinner. I’m gonna need a big ass breakfast when I wake up.” Cas ponders for a moment. “That shouldn’t be a problem.”
He hesitates slightly before he touches two fingers to Dean’s forehead and closes his eyes, waiting for his surroundings to change. Dark blue shadows from the dimly lit bunker swirl into harsher reddish-orange tones. He looks up to see Dean staring blankly with terror plastered on his face. Cas is just out of Dean’s periphery so Dean hasn’t noticed him yet.
He walks outside, totally expecting to never see the guy again, only to find him sitting in the driver's seat of an old Lincoln Continental delicately biting into the breakfast sandwich he had put together inside the store. He's eating in his car. Dean still has a chance! He racks his brain for an idea of how he could strike up a conversation without totally spooking the guy. He could just walk up with a ‘fancy meeting you here’ line. But with no incentive to stay, the guy could easily be weirded out by that and take off. He could ask for help with something. But he doesn't actually need help with anything and as soon as the guy figures that out he could again get weirded out and just take off. He could try to offer helping with something. But this guy seems overly capable if helping himself.
He watches, mesmerized, and finds himself quietly following the guy around the store while he finishes up getting what looks like breakfast. Kinda odd he would come here just for a meal, especially this early in the morning but it actually looks like a pretty good spread, and maybe lunch too. Dean hasn't really gotten himself anything and he can't exactly talk to the guy empty handed. It's gotta feel organic and unplanned and Dean has no idea how he's going to pull that off without looking like a total creep. He grabs a loaf of bread off a shelf by him and moves to the next isle quietly while the Ceceilea drifts through the store perusing the bottled drinks and no doubt looking for the last ingredient to his breakfast.
The fleeting thought of marking Cas deep inside him where he's never been touched before drifts through his mind and that's it. White light bursts behind his eyelids as a feeling that he can't even describe washes over him. It's beyond ecstasy, beyond euphoria, it's so far beyond anything he's ever felt, it's almost as if his brain can't fully process it so it's shutting down. He faintly registers that he's yelling and he's surprised his body is still functioning and doing what it's supposed to, because he's so high right now.
“Maybe.” Dean answered, shrugging and earning a side eye and a long sigh from Sam. “Cas?” he turned to him, waiting on an answer.
“Yeah, you’ve been talking about it before Dean suggested food.” Sam said. He was still the sober one.
"Thank you. I'm going to try to go to sleep now." and he wanted to go by Dean, who then took his hand, stopping him.
"Sorry." Cas whispered, but he saw Dean smile so he didn't know what to think. Was he mad or not? It was hard to tell.
Something really, really short this time hah (the plan was for all the drabbles to be more or less this short, but y'know how it is with planning fics haha 🤷)
Castiel has always had some feelings towards Dean. But he didn't understand them. He still not fully does. But now he's more aware of them and what they might be. He felt more human, when he was with Dean, and that was a good feeling. And he could tell he loved Dean. In kind of different way than he loved Sam, but he didn't want to think about it too much. What if he says something and Dean never talks to him again? Cas didn't want to risk that.
He glanced at the angel for a second, smile forcing itself on his lips. Dean fought back that smile, tightening his grip on the wheel and blinking a few times. He needs to focus. Because if he's supposed to be mad at Cas, there's no way in hell that he's letting him drive his Baby.
they can bring him back. They’ll try. And if they fail, they’ll try again. And again. And again. Until they’re literally out of options. No one in their little family dies for good, ever. And the first one certainly won’t be a kid.
“I’ll see ya, kid.” Bobby said before standing up and walking away, obviously trying to give them time to talk.
When they finally parted, they were both panting and smiling, and Dean wanted nothing more than just to kiss Cas again, and again, and again, and again. But for now, he needed to breathe. He was happy, really happy, for the first time in a long while. And he felt lighter after getting all those emotions out, even if just in the form of a kiss. He would get to the talking part later. There was no rush. And in that moment, they didn’t need any words.
“Okay.” Cas murmured, settling against Dean again, his lips starting to move against his neck in short ghosts of kisses. Dean just chuckled, relaxing into it. And then…
“You’re no help.” Dean scoffed and FaceTimed Charlie, asking the same question. She was at some party, getting drunk and high again.
Cas just smiled and went to his room. Soon after that Dean followed, but went to his own room, put the gun in its place, and went to sleep. Or tried to.
When they were finished with the food, they spent a bit more time there, just sitting and talking. Then they paid and left. They started walking back towards Dean’s apartment, Benny and Charlie deep in conversation about some sci-fi movie they both watched and now they were discussing and freaking out over the end of the world. Sam was to them listening with amusement, and Dean was deep in thought. Then suddenly he stopped.
I started to write this mostly because I wanted to practice my writing and I saw this one post on tumblr (
Haha, I'm kind of trying to find more time to write, every night I try to sit down to it, or at least once a week, and I have so many ideas :D
I’m actually so mad at myself about this chapter - because I had this whole scene in my head, the dialogue, everything, and it was so good, but I was busy and I didn’t write it down - and then I forgot, but then I sat down to write a couple hours later and I was so surprised because I was sure that I had written this drabble already. And by then I forgot almost all of it so it turned out worse than it could be, although I still kinda like it lol
“Like he would even dare to try.” Dean scoffed, but pulled out his wallet to settle the bill, and, just to be safe, looked out the window to make sure his car was still there. Cas just smiled at him, intertwining their fingers as they were leaving. On their way, Dean smiled at the waitress, who immediately looked away. And his humor was much better again. Who knew that all he needed to be truly happy was Cas?
“You know what you wanna get?” Dean asked, his menu raised a bit, to avoid Sam’s teasing about drooling over Cas. Who was just... there. And that was making Dean giddy. And
Idk, whatever I write, it never turns out the way I want it to, and I don't particularly like this one, but whatever hah
“I know” Cas cut in, and Dean relaxed, just now noticing that all his muscles got tense and he was holding his breath. Maybe it was stupid, but he just wasn't ready to say those words. He was expressing his love for the angel in other words and other ways.
“Not much. Case turned out to be more complicated than simple ghost, but we managed” Cas shrugged. Sam sighed in disappointment, wondering why they were so oblivious.
“I love you” Dean smiled and his heart started racing. He opened his eyes and looked in Cas’ blue ones.
And as they looked into each other's eyes, for longer than necessary, as they tended to do, Cas realized why Dean was getting more open about them in public, even if still discreet. He was happy. And he really didn’t want to hide his happiness. And then Dean took his hand and intertwined their fingers. They weren’t at the stage of showing off their relationship, and maybe they never would be. But in time, their kisses and hand holding won’t be hidden, discreet, and secretive. And now they had all the time in the world to really figure everything out.
Despite everything, Dean would still be worried sick, which would probably earn him some teasing from both his brother and his boyfriend. And he was fine with that. He just needed Cas to come back to him.
“Alright, I guess it’s time to get up.” he said, rolling his eyes. Cas started getting up, but then Dean added: “But first-” and he captured Cas’ lips with his, pushing him back onto the pillow. Cas immediately wrapped his hands around him.
“Just so you know.” Cas pulled away. “I don’t regret dying for you. But I just wanted you to live a full, happy life before you came here.”
To Dean’s left was his best friend, Charlie Bradburry, sitting in the middle of the couch, talking passionately about something. They’ve been friends forever and now they were going to the same university. Her beautiful red hair was up in a ponytail, with few strands of hair and her fringe loose all around her face. She was wearing Dean’s t-shirt, because she spilled coke all over hers, being her clumsy self.
Cas didn't say anything. He just laid in bed on the other side and covered himself with half of the blanket.
He wasn’t sure what to do, and he knew that he wouldn’t last long with bottling all those feelings inside. There were just too many emotions he was already hiding and he felt like he was about to burst.
“I guess I gotta call Sammy and tell him we’re gonna be home a little later than expected.” Dean laughed, sitting in the driver's seat, already clothed.
“Well, you’re here now.” Dean attempted a smile. “And if it makes you feel any better, it was not a glorious, guns blazing death. It was rather pathetic.” he chuckled. “And it’s not like I wanted to die, so don’t give me shit for that. You chose to be stupid and sacrifice yourself for me.” now he was getting irritated, because that was what his relationship with Cas usually looked like and he secretly loved it. All the irritation and bickering.
“I want to kiss you.” Cas said out of the blue, looking Dean straight into the eyes. He was thinking it the whole evening, and now it just kinda slipped out of his mouth.
“You don’t have my number.” Cas said, pulling his pad and a pen, writing a number and then tearing the page out of there and giving it to Dean. “Here.”
Later that night, maybe around 3:30am, he was back in the apartment, where the rest of them were eating ice-cream from a box.
“Thanks, Sammy.” she grinned and stuck out her tongue when he rolled his eyes. “You know you’re stuck with ‘Sammy’, right?”
“But you do, huh?” Dean smirked, now feeling stupid for not realizing it earlier. “Because you’re no ordinary angel.” Cas shrugged, with a helpless little smile. Dean took another few steps closer. “You’re a Winchester. And we never play by the book.” at that, Castiel’s smile grew wider and his expression softened even more. “Cas, every time you leave me, I- I can’t function. I can’t breathe without you. So even though I’m dead now, I’m happy, because you’re here and nothing can tear us apart now.” he grabbed Castiel by the lapel of his coat. “And just to be clear, because you’re a dumbass, I love you, too.” his voice shook a little at those last words. Ironically, he felt like he was going to die in that moment. His heart was racing, as if it was about to jump out of his chest, and he felt dizzy.
And years later, when Dean and Cas moved in together, they still couldn’t believe that it all started from weed. If it wasn’t for that night when Dean got high and wanted to go out to eat, who knows if he would ever had the guts to ask Cas out? Maybe Cas would ask him? Although he was never really sure if Dean was interested and didn’t want to make a fool of himself. Anyway, the sentence “I could really eat somethin’” has become one of the inside jokes for the group of friends, and, more importantly, a really important thing for Cas and Dean. A sentence that started it all. Or maybe it was weed? Well, they were thankful to both.
“Yeah, well, you said your peace back then. So now it’s my turn.” Dean said before Cas had a chance to repeat his speech or whatever he was about to say. “That was so unfair.” he started, taking a step towards Cas. “You can’t just say all those stuff just to die afterwards! I barely had time to process what was happening.”
“Dean, are you listening?” Sam asked, as Dean looked at him over the table. He realized he’s just spent a good few minutes looking at Cas, who sat next to Sam, while leaning his chin on his hand. Damn. That was just embarrassing.
“What?” Castiel squinted his eyes adorably as he did, when he was really confused. “You just ate, Dean.”
“I know. Now so does she.” he shrugged, pleased with himself. He felt really good about just being out in public, kissing his boyfriend, and no one having any problem with that. It felt awesome, and he found himself thinking that he ought to do it more. Maybe he’d finally take Cas on an actual date?
Those words echoed through his head. He didn’t understand… Cas was dead, wasn’t he? Did Jack bring him back? What was going on?
He couldn’t sleep, he was worried about Cas, and about Jack, and he couldn’t let himself grieve or else he would lose it. And he felt guilty, for being so against Jack at the beginning, among other things. After all, bad things were always in some way his fault, right? At least that’s what he believed.
Dean and Cas started acting like a married couple, even more than they already were. And they would never really talk about it, but they knew that they were together and that they're gonna sleep in one bed from now on. And it wouldn’t really change their lives or affect their hunts. As human Cas would learn to believe when Dean would say that he needs him. He would start to feel important and necessary and like he matters. Because of Dean. Because he did matter to Dean.
He parked the car in front of some diner. It was getting dark and they were all tired and hungry, and they’ve been driving for a while.
Just saying: in this drabble Sam doesn't now about Dean and Cas, and they are in no hurry to change that :D
Hi! This week I remembered to post in the middle of the week too yaay! (okay, I updated my calendar, whatever haha)
It was Friday night. Actually, it was already Saturday. Four teenagers were sitting in a circle at the round table. They were all in great moods. It was probably mostly due to the joint they were sharing. They were finishing another one and they were quite high at this point. But let’s introduce them first.
“Dean, watch out!” he heard Cas’ raised voice as the angel took the steering wheel and probably saved them from crashing. Dean blinked quickly, trying to stay awake. When was the last time he slept? He couldn't remember. “You need rest.”
And Dean got lost in those blue eyes. And all he wanted to do was kiss Cas’ lips. But... Keep in mind that he was intoxicated, when he mindlessly said, or maybe even muttered “I could really eat somethin’.”
“Why aren't you sleeping?” was the first thing Dean said after he shook off his surprise at seeing his little brother. Dean's tone was offensive and even accusing.
And now the two of them were going on a hunt together. Sam stayed at the bunker, doing research. He wanted to go too. And Dean wanted him to go. But Sam decided to stay for some reason. Cas suspected that he maybe did it so Dean and Cas would finally make up.
“I… died?” Dean answered, frowning in confusion, although it came out more as a question. This wasn’t how he imagined reuniting with his angel. “I died, and I’m in Heaven. What-?”
Dean woke up at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. They were quiet, discreet, like someone didn't want to be heard. And they definitely weren't Sam's. His first instinct was getting his gun that was usually on his nightstand while he slept nowadays. He took the gun and stood up, already fully awake at the thought of an intruder in the bunker.
“I was getting bored.” Cas smiled innocently when he was done, his face close to Dean’s again. Yeah, apparently laying in bed and doing nothing was not something Cas could do for a long period of time. Dean learned about it a while ago, and normally he would be like that too, it was just so great to be able to do this with Cas.
“To another successful hunt.” Jack toasted, raising his beer bottle. All three of his father figures looked at him with genuine pride and affection. He was still getting used to this hunter’s lifestyle, but he was doing great.
Anyway, they talked to people, did some research, found the ghost… and that’s when it went downside. Because it wasn't a single ghost. There were ghosts. Plural. Very very mad vengeful spirits.
He parked his car in front of the building Cas lived in. He got out of the car and that’s when he saw the door opening and Cas was walking towards him, wearing a light blue shirt and black jeans, with unzipped jacket over his shoulders.
“I know that.” he said almost defensively. “It’s just- You’re human now.” he linked their fingers and looked down. “And I can’t help it if I’m a little worried.” he murmured, his face now flushed.
This is probably one of my least fav things I've ever written - I have no idea what is even going on here lmao (I almost don't wanna post it at all, geez XD)
“Look, this should be good.” and he used that as an excuse to raise his menu even higher and come closer to Cas, so that their menus were now shielding them from Sam’s and Jack’s gazes. Cas turned his head to look at him in confusion. And then Dean left a soft, gentle kiss on Cas’ lips. “Couldn’t help myself.” he murmured, pulling away with a grin.
“I know” Cas repeated, earning a chuckle from Dean. After that Dean fell asleep, feeling Cas’ warm body against his. Cas’ body. Cause even in Cas’ opinion, it stopped being just a vessel a long time ago. It's him now.
Opposite to Charlie, and to Dean’s right there was his other best friend, Benny Lafitte, on an ottoman, holding the joint at the moment and taking a drag on it. He was also Dean and Charlie’s friend. They all met at the same time in elementary school and were inseparable since. Benny too went to college with Dean and even used to live with him for a while, before they decided that living together was not good for their friendship. They drove each other crazy.
Dean smiled and tried to get a little bit of blanket to cover himself. He didn't want to get up to get another blanket, he was too tired. So he tried to pull the blanket from under Cas and failed. Well, he did it gently to not wake him up. But then he tried again, harder. This time he succeeded, but Cas, still asleep, pulled the blanket back. Dean looked at him with disbelief. Who knew that he was a blanket hogger?
“Of course, Dean.” Cas’ smile was bright and happy. Happier than Dean’s ever seen him. And he realized that maybe up until now Cas was still doubting Dean’s feelings. Maybe he hadn’t thought that Dean would want to stay with him forever. Which was a stupid thing to think, because who wouldn’t want that? It was Cas. “Let’s get our own home.”
I kinda like it, but at the same time it kinda feels like it was written months ago, y'know? - maybe it's just me tho hahaha didn't make any changes tho, it is what it is
“Can never be too careful.” Dean shrugged. “But you got a gun too, right?” he added, glancing at Cas.
So he called him later that day, when his friends went back to their houses and it was just him and his brother.
“C’mon, why don’t we go for a drive?” he asked. “And we can talk and catch up.” he intertwined their fingers. When Cas nodded, Dean pulled him towards the car.
“I’m calling about that date… because I did ask you out on a date, right?” he added, suddenly doubting himself.
His shower lasted maybe two minutes. Then he came out of the bathroom in his pants and without a shirt, cause he forgot. And he never really paid attention to that. But now he was painfully aware of his lack of clothes and Cas’ eyes on him. Which was ridiculous, of course. He decided he was just imagining things. Dean ignored it and started looking for clean shirt in his bag. Meanwhile Cas went to the bathroom. Which, again, made Dean feel confused. Even after all those years, he still didn't understand angels. This one angel in particular.
“Dean, about a month ago.” Cas answered, surprising them both. Before he could say anything else, Dean grabbed his hand.
“Oh.” that's a new information. Dean felt his eyes close and he wasn't even in bed yet. He took his jacket and shoes and off and collapsed onto bed, falling asleep almost immediately, on top of the sheets.
“Dean.” Cas pulled his hands away from his face, looked at Dean, and tried to act as if everything’s fine. “What are you doing here?”
When they got to the room with two beds, Dean looked at Cas, a little confused. Cas was going towards one of the beds.
But I genuinely love this drabble so much, like, I have no idea why, but out of everything in this series I wrote up until now, this one's probably my favorite :D
As the girl was walking away with their orders, Dean’s gaze following her, he felt a kick under the table. He looked up at his brother, who sat opposite him and Cas.
” Dean scoffed. “You didn’t know shit.” he said a little aggressively. “Just like you think that you couldn’t have what you wanted. You’re an idiot.” Cas opened his mouth to answer, but Dean quickly started talking again. “But I guess I am, too. I’m not good at this shit, Cas. This will not be as good as what you said. But I need to tell you. You know, when you showed up in my life, you turned it upside down. And it wasn’t just the angel thing or the Apocalypse, and all that shit. It was you.” he couldn’t help the small smile. “I started questioning everything. About me, about my life… You changed me, too, Cas. Completely. But I tried to repress all the feelings. I hid them as deep as I could. Until Purgatory.” he looked Cas in the eyes and saw the moment Cas understood where he was going with this. “Purgatory was when I realized. But then there was another problem. I thought...” he chuckled. “I was never sure if angels can, uh, feel the way humans do. I knew there was something there. But-”
“I think I’ll stay. We have more books to read.” Cas said, pointing to the pile of books on the table. Dean pouted as Cas looked him straight in the eyes, with an expression that told Dean that Cas knew that getting a snack was not the only thing he had in mind.
They ended up going to the dinner, then to the movies, and then finally ended up in a bar, drinking beer and talking. Turns out, once they got past the awkwardness, they couldn’t stop talking about basically everything.
This one is…. Unnecessary, lol. I didn’t really have an idea but I started writing whatever, and this happened. There’s barely any dialogue or anything actually happening, no idea why it’s so long, but whatever XD (also, the amount of times I used the word ‘control’ is ridiculous - like, bitch, you don’t NEED to use the word in the prompt at all, let alone this much lmao
They were close. Cas moved a little bit closer, because he didn't want to take the blanket from Dean. They didn't touch but Cas could feel the warmth coming from Dean's body and it was strangely comforting. Dean fell asleep quickly, he must've been tired. And for a while Castiel just looked at him. And maybe it was seeing the hunter next to him, or maybe just knowing that he's so close, just few centimeters… but Cas felt good and safe and for a moment he forgot about being a powerless human and slowly, really slowly, but finally he too fell asleep. By Dean's side. With smile on the face.
But anyway, I wrote this one a loooong time ago for number 11 before I realized that it fits more here, idk, and thanks to that I wrote a new one for number 11 which is one of my faves haha
I kinda had trouble with this one - I wrote first two paragraphs and then I just couldn't finish it, I left it for WEEKS, and then I wrote this at 2am, tipsy and barely awake lol
“We should probably get up soon.” Cas said, raising his head to look at the clock on the bedside table. “It’s late.”
“Yeah. Duh. Did you think I want to live with my brother for the rest of my life?” Dean chuckled. Cas shrugged. “So. What do you think? We can find some small, old, run-down house. And renovate it together. And make it truly our home.” he took Cas’ hand into his. “Do you wanna get a house and spend the rest of our lives with me there?” he added a little shyly, his tone half teasing. Because it sounded ridiculous. Dean Winchester and a former angel of the Lord playing house together? His life was insane.
He loved when they watched movies together, and they sat close and their hands would meet in a bowl of popcorn, sending shivers through Dean every time their skin would touch. And he loved that Cas would actually eat the popcorn, despite not being able to really taste it. Things like that made him appear a little bit more human.
And then, they were on a case, and Dean couldn’t stop fearing for Cas’ life, even though he was an angel, and it was not likely for him to die because of a ghost. He just felt like, if Cas died again, he would regret not saying anything, not doing anything. So when they were back at the motel and got out of the car, Sam had gone to their room, and Dean stayed back, grabbing Castiel’s wrist. And he kissed Cas eagerly, as if his life depended on it. As if that kiss was what he needed to live. And he felt as if his insides completely melted, and he felt nervous and relieved. Relieved, because Castiel answered with the same passion and desperation. As if that moment, and that kiss, was the only thing that mattered. They kept kissing so desperately, as if they would die once their lips parted. Dean actually felt like that might happen. He finally got to kiss Cas, and he never wanted to stop. He poured all the years of longing and pining and denial and grief and love into that kiss. He continued kissing Cas even when he felt like he was going to pass out because of the lack of air.
He felt some kind of… longing. He didn’t really get it. He was happy, he had everything he could dream of. His family was alive. He had Cas. The world wasn’t ending for once. It was great. But still, something was missing. But he didn’t want to dwell on it and seem like he’s not happy with his life now, because really, he has never been happier. Still, he couldn’t help but wonder.
He was constantly finding new things about Cas that made him feel that weird feeling. It was enough for Cas to look at him, which was happening a lot, and he felt butterflies in his stomach. Cas’ eyes were the most beautiful thing in the world, and his smile lit up the room. And Dean was fucked.
