Tony was always under pressure, but Steve hoped that this time, it wasn't because of him. He wanted to just pull Tony away and go to a spa and see that tension melt away from the brunette's shoulders.
"He found out about me tutoring you and also got angry at my report results," Tony continued, "The usual happened then. He called me a fag and threw me. He-"
"Uhm... I uh... I kinda... I kinda p-promised myself that I would uh... I would only use it if you--
"Great! I'll go talk to Banner and see for myself what needs to be corrected," smirking to himself, Tony took a couple steps forward to the door.
Tony was curled into a ball, resting against the other side of the door and trying to snuffle his wails. His breathing increased. His head felt light. It felt numb. Everything felt numb. It was the type of numbness you would feel when the cold stings so badly, that your nerves finally give up trying to aid you in touch. It was fear creeping in like ice in his veins and sending shockwaves through his body. Tony was hyperventilating. He believed Steve didn‚Äôt want him anymore. That he had failed as a partner.
‚ÄúOkay, so, I planned a small little picnic for us today, but then the rain happened, so I thought of the next best thing: a small indoors picnic by the fireplace. And don‚Äôt worry, I told the others to stay on their floors and not to bother us today.‚Äù
It was all he could do after seeing Natasha haul him like a piece of meat! But, then again... a lioness

time? Or do you think they'd rather find an alpha to really relieve that ache?" Tony stretched out his arms, arching his eyebrows questioningly.
The captain opened his eyes and saw the far-away look in Tony's. The genius bit his lip subconsciously and seemed to forget his surroundings.
"You do drive a good bargain, Captain," the mechanic grinned. And Steve vowed to keep that grin on Tony's face as long as he could.
And with that, he forcefully grabbed Bucky by the collar of his uniform and yanked him down the corridor to the helicarrier outside!
He pushed Steve away as fast as he could, his eyes wide and scared as he started blubbering nonsensically, "I'm- I'm sorry, I- I'm

‚ÄòHe looks tired,‚Äô thought Tony sympathetically, surprising himself that he was so quick to care. Though, it had been a couple months already, but‚Ä¶
The captain's eyes crinkled, his eyebrows furrowing as his whole face pinched in pain. He drew Tony back into his arms, letting the tired scientist rest in his grip.
His eyes clenched shut as he fought his internal battle against the spiral of emotions raging in his body.
I am incredibly sorry that it's taken so long to get back to this work - I didn't forget about it entirely; I've just been dealing with some things at home, but I've got 2 new fics planned and I'm gonna get into contact with a beta to help me, because I'm gonna need help, so if anyone can recommend any betas that can help with plot continuity, I'd appreciate it üíô
She had fought against it for two whole days after Tony‚Äôs heat had passed, but the brunette was stuck on the statement that she deserved something completely amazing for putting up with him. He hated how useless he must‚Äôve been in heat, relying on Nat like a pup and not being able to function properly. It was a low blow to be such a burden on Nat. And Tony had to make up for it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll call for Doctor Stephen right away,‚Äù the front desk secretary scrambled for the microphone and called for attention Doctor Stephen.
Tony leapt up the last few stairs, two at a time, clutching the bouquet of Steve‚Äôs favorite flowers and the holiday brochure hidden between the petals.
And, by God, the entire man's face lit up like a thousand Christmas lights as he pulled Tony to his chest, cradling the brunette's head tenderly and nuzzling his hair.
She pecked a kiss onto his forehead. Her tone turned playful, "So you wanna get up from the floor now, Antoshka? You wanna go curl up all nice cozy on the bed? Huh? Come on, Sweet Omega, let's get up and I'll take care of you."
Most people would grow to see you in a different light when troubles come your way. When you asked for help, some people would believe you to be too frail or sickly to handle something like that on your own ever again. Natasha wasn‚Äôt like that. She didn‚Äôt push or fawn over you like an injured duckling. She understood that each person had to overcome their own battles, but she‚Äôd be there to catch you nevertheless.
Steve‚Äôs forehead rested despairingly against the hardwood as his shoulders hitched with his quiet sobs.
So, I'm contemplating whether or not to leave this fic with a cliffhanger and start the 3rd book in the series, because of Chapter consistency.
"Let it out, Antoshka. Just let it out- it's okay. You're upset and you miss your daddy. It's normal. But you could
So, the next chapter will contain some light angst and will I'll maybe work on the draft later today or tomorrow, but I will be posting soon!
Steve wouldn't let himself be riled up, but he had to admit the doctor was good. His blood was boiling as he clenched his hands into fists.
‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúWhy would you ever choose to love me? What good does it bring you? Mentally, physically; spiritually? It brings nothing. I don‚Äôt even know why you, or Rhodey or Pepper still stick around
"Shhh... shhh... Oh, my poor Tony... it's alright..." Steve whispered gently into his baby's curls, "Shhh... Shh... Aw, come on now, my HoneyBaby; there we go... Oh, it'll be alright..."
Steve hated that Tony always felt obligated to expect the worst from their conversations. Not that Steve had ever given Tony reason to think otherwise...
An iron ring clenched around Steve‚Äôs own heart, choking him- shallow breaths leaving and entering his body.
open the door for me. I need to see you ‚Äì I need to apologize to you properly. Babydoll? Tones, please.‚Äù
But Steve felt his stomach drop. His body froze. The last time he had been this close to Tony, he'd messed everything up- he'd nearly gotten Tony killed.
She walked over to the now-turned-toddler genius and clutched him into her lap, tickling him madly! Tony squealed in surprise and tried to fight her off, but it was to no avail!
All too soon though, Steve broke away. Tony whined, trying to recapture Steve's lips, but to no avail.
The genius had been working non-stop for SI for over a month now and it had taken quite a toll on him. And on Steve especially. With all the work piled up, Tony hadn‚Äôt been able to show his alpha the love and affection he‚Äôd normally be able to give.
The embraced in a big, albeit stinky hug and Steve turned to Tony who was nuzzling the blonde's neck. He looked up with wide eyes to Steve, who kissed him on the nose.
Tony gazed into those beautiful blue orbs, hoping to say what words never could. The rain continued its silent pounding against the glass outside, the lightning flashing white gold.
Tony barked out a laugh, "I like this possessive streak, Stevie! I missed that filthy mouth of yours too!"
It took a while, but slowly, his eyes lost their haze and Tony blinked a couple times before really seeing Nat in front of him.
And with that, Steve growled once more, crushing Tony‚Äôs mouth against his. And Tony laughed happily all through the elevator ride to their room on the third floor.
loves you!" Bucky pressed, leaning closer, "I know it's your decision, but it's been months Tony. If you're ready for closure, then maybe you need to take the first step to talk to him. He's still hurting pretty bad."
A devilish thought had then come into Steve's mind at the bar. He decided to get Bucky drunk enough to agree to blind sex. One thing then led to another and...
Tony would fall asleep soon, like he always did when she petted him like this, and then she‚Äôd deal with a
‚ÄúSteve, come on, bud. I‚Äôll make you some tea and you can come sit and relax,‚Äù Bruce gently coaxed him to the couch, but Steve pushed away.
Just then, Tony's stomach gurgle noisily in the room. Clapping a hand to his tummy, Tony made a face, "I feel kinda hungry."
So I'm alive!!! üéâüéâüéâüòÑüòÑ School is just a lot for me, so just bear with me on the days when I don't have the energy to write, but when I start something I love, I will finish it, but I just want to make it perfectüíô
Thor was the one to pick the night's movie - "Midgardian Culture is quite simply more predictable than I thought. There is certainly a lot more violence in this
It wasn't until Natasha called Steve one Friday morning, that the man finally shot out of his wallowing in ice-cream and comedy shows and took a shower and called Bucky.
Tony whimpered again shamefully and more wetness gathered between his thighs. More sweat gathered over his bosy. He clutched desperately at his stomach and his eyes were screwed shut as he tried to ignore the pounding ache.
Steve snickered. Another thing he found quite mesmerizing was the relationship Tony had with his technology. He treated his AIs and robots with humanity; as equals.
"Yeah, the, uh, nurse had to put this antiseptic on my stitches, but just then, Bruce needed help calming down, so she had to bolt. And I can't leave, because they're obviously going to check the cameras and know that I haven't gotten my full medical exam."
Steve's eyes clouded over with tears and he leaned in to clutch Tony's lips and tell him what Steve couldn't, through his kisses, through his touch. He made sure that Tony felt treasured.
That eerie, shadow voice came forward again once more, and chuckled darkly from deep within the corner of Steve's head.
Steve had never seen eyes blaze so strong with fury. Her gaze was like ice, licking its way into Steve's veins, into his blood and into his heart.
"Mmm, Alpha..." he murmured, dazed. His pupils dilated and his mind began to fill with that soft, golden haze of bliss. "
They also blushed at Nat's smug, snickering grin when they re-entered the med bay, their hands entwined together
Nat rolled her eyes at their lovey-dovey antics, but nodded to Steve-- seemingly satisfied with his answer. She ruffled Tony's hair fondly as the couple stepped into the elevator.
" a new voice suddenly called out. Tony squeezed his eyes shut, sighing. He leant closer to Steve before turning his attention over to a red-head standing in front of them.
Steve rolled his eyes again, but couldn‚Äôt help smiling fondly, ‚ÄúYou need to rest. You need to sleep.‚Äù
, Rogers..." Her voice became a deathly cold whisper, "You will be paralyzed for the next seventy years of your lifetime ..."
His body pulled him back into the dreaded cold he felt in his nightmare and he began to shiver uncontrollably.
Nat led Steve to a side corridor to speak with him. Steve couldn‚Äôt shake his fear. He couldn‚Äôt shake the anxiety. Tony was lying in a small hospital bed, unaware of what was happening around him and the captain felt so helpless. He didn‚Äôt want to sit here and wait for test results; he wanted a cure! He wanted Tony to wake up!
Nodding to herself, she turned back to her teammates. They all exchanged dumbfounded glances as Nat, Bruce and Clint huddled around Tony to comfort him. Wanda shrugged, non-committedly.
Shucking off his coat and tie and flipping off his shoes by the hanger, he walked into the kitchen to find his husband all dressed up in an apron and chef‚Äôs hat bustling about the room.
Steve‚Äôs heart summersaulted. ‚ÄúOh, Tony you don‚Äôt need to be,‚Äù he murmured softly, ‚ÄúBecause no matter what, you are
. And no, it is not because it comes from the garbage. It's just considered unhealthy if you eat too much of it. And you call music 'sick beats' as in 'fun' and 'cool', okay?"
‚ÄúF.R.I.D.A.Y? Be a dear and please leave a note to Barton saying that a surprise is¬† waiting for him in the kitchen.‚Äù Steve called out, his gaze never unlocking from Tony's.
In response, she tightened her grip on Steve's arms, making him flinch. Steve soon began twisting in pain against the wall.
Tony looked dumbfounded and a little nervous, still, so Steve pecked him on the nose, causing the genius to blush and grin sheepishly!
And, even though his head was in his hands, everyone could see Clint's shoulders shake as he ultimately gave in and laughed with the others.
"Shh... shhh, that's it... Daddy's here; Daddy's gotcha... You don't have to worry 'bout nothing...There we go... Ahh, there we go, my beautiful boy... My
"Shh now, shh, it's okay... It's alright. Hey, it's okay. Nothing's messed up. You didn't mess anything up."
‚ÄúHey, hey, no. No, it‚Äôs okay, My Little Babe, it‚Äôs alright. Hey, hey come on, let me look at those beautiful eyes. Let me see my beautiful boy. Come on.‚Äù
"Awh, don't tell F.R.I.D.A.Y, Nat, but you're my best gal!" Tony called, as Nat strolled out of the room. She blew him a kiss before closing the door.
‚ÄúAw, no way, I-‚Äú Tony laughed wetly. His favourite cereal and pudding and donuts were stocked up with Steve blushing brightly as he held them. The two shared a look; and a smile between them.
"You'll still be here when I wake up, right? You won't leave?" Tony mumbled, the vibrations tickling Steve's throat a little.
gorgeous mechanic a few feet away, covered in oil as black as his tank top and jeans. His hair was disheveled and his lop-sided grin made Steve's heart flip. The blonde couldn't tear his eyes away if he tried.
Everything inside of Tony screamed agonizingly. His vision swam, his ears ringing in a high pitched squeal.
Five seconds in which Steve held on to Tony's rough, calloused hand that had created so many wonderful things Steve was privileged to have witnessed being made. A touch like fire. Sparks flying.
The captain blew a raspberry on Tony‚Äôs stomach, watching the small boy wriggle and chuckle and Steve just enjoyed the happy sounds that left his heart and lips.
He made quick work of it, then. Stroking Steve with a lubed up hand while working himself open, before ever so slowly letting himself slide down Steve‚Äôs shaft. They both moaned when Tony bottomed out.
Bucky hummed and thought his own of it. They eventually let go and Steve went back to his painting and ignoring Tony.
‚ÄúCar should be ready in five, and then we‚Äôll go for that date.‚Äù Tony kissed Steve again because now he could, he finally could, and then dragged him along to the elevator to get down to the underground garage.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
‚ÄúIs it weird that I‚Äôm so comfortable around you?‚Äù he asked softly. Steve smiled and played with Tony‚Äôs fingers.
Tony woke up on a hard floor, his head feeling as if it was stuffed with clouds. He made to rub his temples, only to discover that his hands were bound. He frowned and opened his eyes, memories coming back to him. The fight in the dark, a few harsh blows and then a smell going straight to his brain, making him black out.
Steve smiled and sat up again to pull off his shirt, then he relaxed back against the cushions, fingers playing the metal rods through his nipples.
‚ÄúWondering what you‚Äôre going to do now you have me all tied up, sweet thing ‚Äú Steve drawled, and God that made Tony leak in his pants.
‚ÄúYou like to be told what to do, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Tony whispered in Steve‚Äôs ear, nibbling the earlobe. Steve nodded instinctively, wondering if his brain could actually shut down, because this sure as hell felt like it.‚ÄùWell, I think you should show Loki here a good time. Think you‚Äôre up for that?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, you‚Äôre safe, we're safe.‚Äù Steve reassured Tony, holding him close and rubbing soothing circles over Tony‚Äôs back. Tony had buried his head in the crook of Steve‚Äôs neck and was still clinging to him.
‚ÄúSo, what do you want to do now?‚Äù Tony blushed. ‚Äúwe still have two hours before we need to be at the restaurant.‚Äù
‚ÄòWish you were here too X love a good suck job. My hand will have to do for now, what should I do with my other hand?‚Äô
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm with you.‚Äù Their fingers intertwined and  Tony blushed. Steve watched him, already fond of the beautiful brunette. Their ice cream arrived with those little fireworks on a stick on them and Tony started beaming when he saw them. He was like a kid in a candy store and Steve could feel himself falling even more.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make it even better, touch yourself sweetheart, give your cock some attention. I can‚Äôt wait to suck it real nice for you one day.‚Äù
‚ÄúMe neither. This is amazing, Tony. Just everything today ... The Heli, being able to touch and kiss you, the ice cream, the show, this place, oh and let‚Äôs not forget the limo.‚Äù
‚Äúgood morning, honey.‚Äù Steve pressed a kiss to Tony‚Äôs cheek, and that wouldn‚Äôt do. That wouldn‚Äôt do at all.
‚ÄúKind of want to explore you, get my mouth on you. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm good with it, but I really want to this time. Can I?‚Äù
‚ÄúI mean, if you feel ready about it? I would kind of like coming home to you.‚Äù Tony said softly, heart clenching and wishing for Steve to say yes, because now that the idea was in his mind it wouldn‚Äôt leave. Oh please let Steve move in, yes yes yes yes.
A long moan escaped him when Steve immediately started hammering his prostate, the Precision with which Steve would always hit it should be made illegal. Tony was soon swept away in a black out orgasm.
‚ÄúOh no... Oh no, no, no, no.‚Äù Tony sat up Immediately, taking in his surroundings. A gaunt basement in concrete with moist walls and one tiny lamp hanging from the ceiling. A heavy metal door in one of the walls. Tony started taking conclusions, he was obviously drugged to be brought here, most likely with cloroform. He had put up a fight, but he had been outnumbered.  He was so deep in thought he hadn‚Äôt even heard the door  open and a masked man coming in.
Steve got up to get ready, as Tony just sat there, staring as his boyfriend shaved and got dressed. He could get used to seeing this every day, and maybe he would, because Steve had said yes to moving in together.
‚ÄòDefinitely not someone you'd want to mess with, she knew her way around guns.‚Äô Steve smiled as he typed this.
'Guess you're not going to pick up. Maybe you'll answer texts? Please honey, we had such fun. Tell me you just needed some time.‚Äô‚Äô
‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK I WAS SO CLOSE YOU BASTARD.‚Äù The brunet yelled, and then moaned as Steve turned the vibrations right up again.
Steve carried two boxes of clothes to the bedroom, while Tony got distracted by Steve‚Äôs family albums.
‚ÄúGo to sleep honey. I‚Äôll talk to you in the morning, and maybe if you like I could come over this weekend.‚Äù Steve said, fingers itching to reach out and feel Tony‚Äôs silk looking hair under them.
‚ÄúTony!‚Äù Steve smiled brightly as he finally, FINALLY got his first real life look at the man who had driven him crazy all those times.
‚ÄúSteve, not that we‚Äôre going to do that, but do you realise how much the nudes on your phone are worth?‚Äù Bucky exclaimed. Steve shrugged.
He knew it was irrational but still he didn‚Äôt want to let Tony down, in case he woke up and asked for Steve. Fury could wait. Training and his TV shows could wait. Food and sleep could wait.
‚ÄúSure you are.‚Äù Steve replied then set the pizza on the table. ‚ÄúWhy are they in the parlor? I thought you kept them in the workshop.‚Äù
‚ÄúOw.‚Äù Steve rubbed his arm just to humor Tony, mostly he was glad that the omega was not having a melt down because of having his secret exposed. But he supposed, not remembering guarding the secret for so long was also part of it.
"No, no and no. Fine I get it, it was my choice. It was either this, or be kicked out of the team. I could have said no. I said yes. Doesn't mean I have to like it."
Tony looked up to see the Captain opening cartons on the coffee table, he realized how hungry he actually was.
Soon after that, after a series of less important peoples photos, like Hill and the girl who runs Tony‚Äôs favorite coffee shop and such flashed one after the other, Jarvis shut down the projection. Tony remembered none of them.
He rushed into the room but forced himself to take calm, measured steps once he was inside. Tony looked pale against the sheets but not entirely too sick. He was sitting up with his hands together in his lap and there was an expectant look on his face. They had cleaned the blood, bandaged and taped up various small cuts, his black hair pointed in all directions. The corners of his eyes crinkled just the tiniest bit when Steve stepped inside.
Tony decided he would cook a nice breakfast and talk to Steve like an adult. Explain that Fury was taking advantage of Steve and Tony wasn't going to allow that. Even if it cost him Steve's friendship, along with his impossibly tight body and nimble fingers. Steve would be grateful for not being stuck with Tony once he met a nice sub who wasn't so... old and mouthy and stubborn.
Steve curled his fingers around Tony‚Äôs as he watched the colonels expression closed off, his eyes fixed on their joint hands.
Gentle palms cupped his face, the touch way more personal than what Tony was used to from Captain America. He lifted Tony's face up so they could look at eachother.
"Rhodey, please." Pepper tried to pull him back with a hand on the colonels shoulder but the colonel ignored it.
‚ÄúAnd yes, I‚Äôm worried. Who wouldn‚Äôt be. But I don‚Äôt need psych voodoo, I don‚Äôt need to waste time spilling my guts to people who don‚Äôt know me or care about me, people who might sell me off to the news papers at any moment,‚Äù
Then the video opened and Tony started skipping ahead furiously, freezing with his hand hovering above the touch screen when the timeline showed Steve‚Äôs naked back stepping into the shower stall.
Steve didn‚Äôt wait for them to get too far, as soon as they passed Steve, he leapt. He went for the man with the rifle first, the others dropped the suit to the ground with a heavy thunk, but still didn‚Äôt have much time as Steve easily got rid of the rest. Then he dragged the suit into the darkness of the building. He covered the tracks and prayed that he would have a little time to check on Tony before more men poured in.
It was conference room that he's never been in before. It was wide with dark, carpeted floors. A glass conference table surrounded by elegant wire chairs, and wall to wall windows that looked down onto the city. One wall was mirrored and Tony knew it was the result of the obsessive need to spy that SHIELD had.
He kept the part about Bruce to last. Seeing the Hulk, even on a screen was startling at best. Right now, Tony seemed to like Bruce, as he did before the amnesia and Steve didn‚Äôt want to take that away from him, as much as he didn‚Äôt want to take Tony‚Äôs friendship away from the scientist. It would deeply hurt Bruce if Tony even flinched the next time they saw eachother. But he had to trust Tony, trust that the man himself would be the same deep down, despite the lack of memories.
For a moment it was quiet outside. Tony‚Äôs burning form falling kept replaying in front of his eyes but he needed to pull himself together. This would NOT happen a second time. He had been unable to help Bucky. He wouldn‚Äôt leave Tony behind. Alive, or dead.
Tony patted his hand carelessly and turned to point at another young girl with dark hair and slanted eyes while Mike looked down at his hand like he planned to never wash it again. ‚ÄúAnd Ms Sato here is a computer genius. She‚Äôs 22! You should hear her story about the mission in Mexico, Steve. She‚Äôs trying to be modest about it, but they say she saved everyone's asses with her exceptional skills.‚Äù Some of the others at the table nodded as the Asian girl blushed this time.
"Why don't you take a picture, it'll last longer. Plus, we don't have to wait to get to the fun parts." He said.
So he refrained from asking how long he'd have to stay in position. Except as the minutes passed, the problem in his bladder was growing. Maybe if he asked nicely Steve would let him take a break to use the bathroom. After all he'd said he'd help Tony obey.
"No swearing. No backtalk, no arguing. If you have a concern you'll talk to me about it respectfully and honestly."
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mind not knowing anything so much when it was just you and me. But this place is huge. And people look at me with expectation in their eyes.. Not all of those expectations are good.. I don‚Äôt know how to handle that. Maybe I knew, before. I don‚Äôt, now. I need help.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious.‚Äù He gently ran his thumb over Tony‚Äôs eyelashes, urging him to close his eyes once more. Tony complied, settling in. He understood that he didn‚Äôt have to talk, or answer, or comment as Steve spoke. Right now, nothing was expected of him.
‚ÄúYes. In the Syrian facility. We were getting Natasha and Clint out. Remember?‚Äù Steve was getting worried but it was also understandable that Tony would get a little disoriented after a fall like that.
Steve had never had an omega before. Well, just Bucky but Bucky had never been his either. It had been teenaged experimentation on both their sides, then Steve had slept with with various omegas and betas. Not many, but enough to get to know how things worked.  None of them had taken the sickly and weak alpha too seriously anyway. Then he had met Peggy and after that he had gone into ice. He still had the instincts though. The instinct to dominate and protect. He didn‚Äôt know what to do, not exactly, but he could feel what Tony needed. What Tony was trying to ask for, not knowing how to phrase it. Omegas didn‚Äôt always need the care of an alpha, when they had both feet firmly on the ground, like Pepper or Happy. Stability and safety without an alpha was what Tony had been trying to provide for the abused omegas with his charity organization. When they didn‚Äôt have both feet on the ground, they sometimes needed help.  Like Tony did now.
‚ÄúNo need to get up on my behalf Mr Stark. I‚Äôm not exactly shocked.‚Äù Coulson said, then laid the dossiers on the coffee table. ‚ÄúMay I sit?‚Äù But before either of them could answer Coulson had already perched himself on the arm of the closest couch.
‚ÄúAlmost two months?‚Äù Of course, how had Steve missed that? He had been too preoccupied with Tony to notice the timing. He was no expert but even he knew that couldn‚Äôt be natural or healthy. Then he remembered how different Tony‚Äôs heat had smelled that first time he had seen it happen, during the fundraiser. Something wasn‚Äôt right.
The captain didn't answer at first, then gently cupped Tony's face to raise his head and look the sub in the eyes, Tony tried to look away but it was so hard to do under that intense, blue gaze. The dom was slightly frowning.
Despite the memory loss, Tony Stark was still far from stupid. After the ambulance ride it hadn‚Äôt taken long for him to understand that Steve was in fact just being nice and helping him, Tony wasn‚Äôt his omega and that left Tony bereft? Of course. Tony didn‚Äôt know he had been pretending to be an alpha for years now, almost all his life. He had forgotten it. He had just assumed, since the first thing he had seen upon waking up in the land rover , in the middle of the desert was Steve fondling his half naked body as if he had any right to do so.
Tony looked at him for a moment then concluded with his usual perceptiveness, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want me to be afraid of him.‚Äù
The little scritch scatches of Steve's pen stopped, then Tony heard paper shuffling and Steve getting up from his chair. His heart rate picked up, his brain conjuring images of what Steve might do to his cock to stop it from moving. Which of course made him twitch harder.
Something sparked in Tony. A mix of affection, pride, gratitude, indignance and something unfamiliar. Oh he'd make Steve happy alright. He could do much better than this.
"Or touching you." The hands moved up his thighs to his ass, spreading his cheeks obscenely and Tony couldn't help but wink at his dom.
‚ÄúIf you say so Captain. I still find it a little hard to swallow he only remembers you. Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but he barely had a kind word to say about you before all this Syria business.‚Äù
"Oh no way in hell I'm telling you buddy." Tony answered immediately. A murmur rose up once more. "I'd rather get married in peace, thank you." he added over the noise.
"Yeah. Alright. I'll sign them." He said, then added, "Until Pepper gets the board to sign Stane's document null."
The hot flashes, the sweating, the disturbing feeling of wetness between his legs and arousal that only built by the minute‚Ä¶ He paled and scrambled up and out of the bed.
‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be going back to SHIELD as Iron Man for a while yet. You‚Äôre going in as an observer and a tech advisor.‚Äù
‚ÄúI.. Look I get that heats are hard to get through.. Especially alone.. But to do that? And he said.. He said he didn‚Äôt want to force me to be with him..that way. But he had asked me to stay the night. I don‚Äôt see why he‚Äôd be scared enough to do such a thing.‚Äù
Tony breathed from his nose, hands gesticulating wildly and it pissed him off more than words could say to see Steve sitting there all composed and calm, not a hair out of place.
‚ÄúSteve!‚Äù Tony said, and Steve couldn‚Äôt help but notice how truly handsome the man really was. When he wasn‚Äôt being an asshole. And when he wasn‚Äôt being condescending. Or sarcastic. Or defensive, stressed, over worked‚Ä¶
‚ÄúHe has a condition. But more importantly, he is a friend of yours. Remember? He was in the pictures we showed you that first day after you got back from the infirmary. He‚Äôs a really nice guy. You have nothing to worry about.‚Äù Then he reconsidered his words, ‚ÄúUnless you poke him with sharp sticks. Tony, you‚Äôre absolutely forbidden from trying to get him angry to see what happens, do you understand me? If you‚Äôre ever going to obey me, obey me in this. Do not provoke him.‚Äù
Steve started to stroke this time, up and down, making Tony feel a bit like a cow being milked. He could feel the intense blush around his neck and ears, brought on both by his position and what the Captain was saying.
"I'm not. I'm not very good. I'm a bad friend. Bad sub, a bad ceo and a bad team mate. I'm a bad person. I'm scared that people will realize. Pepper already did. And Rhodey will. One day, you will too."
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Tony. It‚Äôs ok. You‚Äôll be ok. You must be in shock.‚Äù He raised a hand to hold Tony‚Äôs hand, to give some sort of comforting touch but then pulled back. Tony wouldn‚Äôt normally want to be comforted, least of all by Steve. So his hand hovered uselessly for a moment. He needed to do something. He needed to keep driving, he knew they weren‚Äôt far from the border, but he couldn‚Äôt turn away from that look.
"Lie down Tony. I want you to sleep with me tonight. Just sleep, you're too tired anyway. I just wanted you to be close to me. Alright?"
The house wasn't big. It was a nice aparment building, with decent sized flats but it was still a flat in mid city. Tony supposed this was as big a place as you could get if you weren't named Stark.
‚ÄúHe told me when he was 16. I was the first person he told, did you know that?‚Äù He said then took a sip.
"There." Gentle hands fit the tip of Tony's cock into the opening of the plastic bottle, then Steve's big warm palm was gripping Tony's cock.
"Steve.. You are young-" Tony started and saw the frown coming a mile away, "and you are...nice. You are very nice." Tony floundered to find a way of telling Steve that he was too innocent, too pure for the likes of Tony. He didn't want Steve to get defensive on his behalf right now, but he did want to make a truthful point.
There was a round of greetings as the agents acknowledged him, one or two of them still green enough to look star struck, looking like they couldn‚Äôt believe their luck, having lunch with both the Iron Man and Captain America. Steve decided to make an appearance more often on the juniors floors.
Tony looked at the guy with his jaw on the floor. Odin? Loki? Greatest energy source known? He had been there??? What?
‚ÄúThank you Captain.‚Äù Jarvis said, still managing to sound like he meant the exact opposite. Tony‚Äôs tech was truly wondrous.
"I wanted to talk first. I don't think we understand each other." Tony said and Steve looked at him with a raised eyebrow.
"You're both right and wrong. I also want you to learn how you can benefit from team work and trusting a team mate."
It's been two nights, Tony's cock reminded him. And we've been good. We earned a reward. Well not completely good, but as good as could be? Steve seemed in a good mood. Could Tony dare hope to come this evening?
Steve debated what he wanted to do next for a few minutes. He hadn‚Äôt planned to spend the night but since he was here, he may as well stay until Tony woke up. In any case, maybe after the day they had yesterday, it was better if Tony didn‚Äôt wake up to an empty house.
Steve's warm hand felt like hot coals on his shaft after the cold treatment but Tony watched in silence while his dom fitted the cock cage around him. When he was done, he held up the key to it, then making sure that Tony was watching pulled out his dogtags and added the small key into the chain.
It was a big plate, with fried eggs, juicy looking sausages, sauteed mushrooms, multi-grain sourdough toast, ham, grilled cherry tomatoes and three kinds of cheese. Tony's eyebrows shot up to his hairline.
Tony bent his head a little, giving Steve more acess to his neck. "Me too." he said eventually. "I just don't understand why that means I have to be celibate."
"It's just salt Tony. I happen to think you've done very well. I'll add to your tally for calling yourself names." The dom said between putting the shaker down and tasting the eggs. "See? There, perfectly good."
Steve was still doubtful. How would it work? He could picture himself being there for Tony, gently guiding him, comforting him, dominating him. But he couldn‚Äôt, in good conscience, have sex with Tony, own Tony or be a true alpha to him. He could play at it, until Tony got his feet back under him but how would that effect Steve? What kind of torture would it be to have Tony but not have him? Could he do it? Should he? How would Tony react to such an arrangement once he got his memories back? He‚Äôd probably hate Steve. He‚Äôd feel humiliated.
Initially, after what Steve privately called ‚ÄòThe Breakfast Incident‚Äô, Tony backed off; Steve would say he reverted to friendly smiles and polite conversation‚Äî but their relationship had never been that insipid before, so that would have been inaccurate.
They understood each other so well, made each other laugh, had each other‚Äôs backs every step of the way. They encouraged each other to be better, something more than the sum of their parts, and craved each others approval. For longer than he cared to admit, all Steve had needed to brighten his day, was to see Tony smiling at him.
"Come on," Steve chuckled, squeezing Tony warmly, "let's go back home and I'll make sure to give you some hot coco and we can snuggle on the couch."
Tony still looked into Steve's eyes as he resumed telling the story, "The audience sees Judy reach for fox repellent. Nick was exaggerating and feigned attacking her; asking her if she was afraid that he might go savage... might go nuts like a predator and try to harm her to try to eat her," Tony sucked in a breath, pinching his stinging eyes closed for a moment.
Should I keep this book going with a longer amount of chapters or start a new one to keep a kind of balance going with the number of chapters in each fic installment?
Blushing, Tony asked, "Um, will you- will you come again tomorrow? And‚Ä¶ Could you- could you be there when I'm discharged? The team is gonna drop me off at the tower."
"Yeah, yeah - sure thing, Nat," he croaked out, his voice rising an octave, "No problem at all. If anything, I'm the one who's safer with Bucky--it's never the other way around."
A breathless chuckle bubbled out of him, "But I wanted his legacy to live on through something important. And I'm glad that Nat agreed to be our surrogate mother too."
a surprising turn of events, but they succeeded in the end. Now it would be a long time before Dr Doom tried his luck again.
Tears still flowed- tears of sadness, regret, but also tears of happiness! A laugh bubbled up from Tony's chest and he pulled away slightly, cradling Steve's face in his hands.
Clint and Thor were busy playing street racer video games on the floor in front of the TV, while Nat and Wanda were snuggling on the couch watching videos on Wanda's laptop.
As the lyric was sung by Phil Collins, and his voice filled the room, Steve used his free hand to hold Tony's in sync, and he rubbed his thumb gently over his baby's knuckles.
The pair looked up to see Clint hanging halfway out of the vent shaft, waving apologetically. Though they all knew that he secretly found this to be
"I was just busy doing my physics homework, Sir," he answered, keeping his tone neutral, his face expressionless.
"There he is- there's that smiling boy!" Steve muzzled Tony's neck until his laughter filled the whole facility!
"Watch your step, on your way in, please Tony. I've been painting and molding - and God knows what else! - to cope. So, my art supplies are everywhere!"
The captain couldn‚Äôt help smiling at that. He placed a kiss in Tony‚Äôs dark locks and pulled away slowly.
‚ÄúWell, then I‚Äôve made just the thing to cheer you up! Now go on and change into something comfy. Take a shower, take a long bath and everything will be ready when you get back. Go on now, get!‚Äù
"A-and wher-where i-is my d-daddy?" Tony's voice had risen an octave in an attempt to speak over his sobbing wails that still threatened to break through.
‚ÄúT-Tony, I ‚Äì you‚Äôre- I, uh-‚Äú Steve stuttered helplessly. His whole body flushed with cold embarrassment. His heartbeat picked up erratically.
Tony's eyes widened and he giggled happily at Nat's story. It was the best sound the spy had ever heard.
, Mama-Bear!" Tony pulled away whining, "If you're finished, then I'd very much like to take a certain blonde captain up to bed, since I can't sleep without him."
The avengers that remained after the snap, stood silent as the grave, unprepared for the reaction that Tony would give them. They were stunned, silent.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see that there‚Äôs much you can do. Let things play out?‚Äù He spread his hands, palms up. ‚ÄúIf they do break up eventually, and you get another shot, don‚Äôt waste it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAwesome armor,‚Äù Tony said, pointing at himself. ‚ÄúShitty shield issue armor.‚Äù He pointed at Steve. ‚ÄúOffice building.‚Äù He gestured at the rubble around them. ‚ÄúTrust me. I could‚Äôve taken the hit. The Creature from the Black Lagoon had nothing on me.‚Äù
She shrugged. ‚ÄúTo Tony? Not really. Things have been quiet all round while you were gone. I mean, he had that gala for the children‚Äôs hospital earlier this week, and I guess there‚Äôs Allison. But other than that‚Äî‚Äù
And sure, Steve felt tired post-battle, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to let Tony down. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great idea.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Something about a wedding we have to go to? Do we know anyone that‚Äôs getting married?‚Äù
That edge of frustration and irritation didn‚Äôt truly fade until after their initial battle with the Chitauri. Seeing Tony fly a nuke into a wormhole had made Steve‚Äôs heart clench in his chest. All in a rush he realized he‚Äôd been wrong about Stark.
Tony and Allison dated for six weeks. Six long weeks where Steve spent one helluva lot of time working his way through punching bags in the gym, and, for the most part managed to avoid the happy couple completely.
He barely ate anything after that, just pushed his food around his plate and watched Tony with worried eyes.
Right from the start Tony had always been tactile, that was the thing, even when they were bickering. In the few weeks between them defeating the Chitauri, and the Avengers moving into the tower, Steve had gotten used to the way Tony would nudge his knee against Steve‚Äôs when they were sitting next to each other, or casually sling an arm over his shoulder when they walked side by side. Then there was the way he‚Äôd rest one hand, warm and firm, against Steve‚Äôs back as he peered over his shoulder to check out whatever Steve was sketching.
‚ÄúA den, then,‚Äù Tony corrected, seamlessly. ‚ÄúA den of superheroes. That‚Äôs the collective noun. I just decided.‚Äù
Steve shook his head. That stomach-swooping-on-a-roller-coaster sensation was back, except this time it didn‚Äôt stop. It just kept on going and going and‚Äî Tony was dating. Tony had stopped calling Steve ‚Äòdear,‚Äô and ‚Äòdarling,‚Äô and ‚Äòhoneypie,‚Äô because he was
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt,‚Äù Steve said, jabbing a random button on the one piece of infernal machinery he had so far failed to master in the 21st Century. ‚ÄúHow do I get this thing to make coffee again?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow come you‚Äôre here so early?‚Äù Steve asked Tony, cutting Clint off mid sentence. Because while Tony wasn‚Äôt always late, exactly, he was almost never at these things before Steve.
Steve winced. ‚ÄúI should uh‚Äî‚Äù He jerked a thumb in the direction of the door, and before either of them could say anything else he was gone.
The Avengers had assembled, defeating them easily enough‚Äî but 6AM post-battle debriefs were still a necessary evil.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with Legolas?‚Äù Tony asked, as they zipped through the clear blue skies of New York towards Avengers Tower.
‚ÄúWait, there are muffins?‚Äù Steve said hopefully, supersoldier metabolism was something else, and what with their late finish last night, he‚Äôd skipped breakfast, rather than miss out on sleep.
‚ÄúHere,‚Äù Bruce said. Leaning over he picked up the syrup and passed it across the table without looking up from his tablet.
‚ÄúGood morning, beloved. This is for you.‚Äù With a wink, Tony slid a cup of coffee across the table towards Steve. Then he leaned back in his chair with a satisfied smile on his face.
‚ÄúWhen‚Äôs the big day?‚Äù Clint asked, after the Avengers finished taking down Mole Man for the second time in a month.
‚ÄúAu contraire, mon capitaine,‚Äù Tony replied, the first time Steve referred to it that way in passing conversation. "This is not a frat house."
It wasn‚Äôt until the fourth day, when they got the call to assemble, that things were finally resolved.
In what felt like no time at all, Espresso Yourself delivered more coffee, enough for everyone in the building, not just those in the meeting room, and an entire muffin basket just for Steve.
‚ÄúI think something‚Äôs wrong with Tony‚Äù he said to Nat, dragging her off to one side after brunch was over.
‚ÄúHey! I don't know where all this crap about me being a difficult person is coming from. I am a constant fucking delight, you know that.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, Allison. She‚Äôs a pediatrician. He met her at the gala? Brought her back to the tower a couple days ago and introduced her to all of us?‚Äù
Steve sat down opposite him in one of the generic office chairs that SHIELD kept in all their meeting rooms. When he took the cup he sniffed it, and smiled. ‚ÄúWow, thanks, Tony. This is great.‚Äù
There was a searing pain in Steve‚Äôs chest as he flew backwards hitting the building behind him. He punched through a wall, and landed on the floor, only for the ceiling above him to collapse in a shower of falling masonry.
carrying Steve, but Steve understood the gesture well enough. ‚ÄúDid Thor propose to Jane or something?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell how was I supposed to know that you‚Äôd decided to stick around just in case we get to see Revenge of the Dildo‚Äôs? Here, have a breakfast muffin instead, birdbrain.‚Äù Tony lobbed a brown paper bag at Clint‚Äôs head, and Clint caught it easily.
The thing was, now that his mind had been opened to the possibility, all he could think about was how good it would be.
‚ÄúI wear armor,‚Äù Tony said, when they finally uncovered him. He knelt beside Steve and flipped his faceplate up, glaring down at him. ‚ÄúRemember this suit? Does it ring any bells?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù Steve knew his mouth was hanging open, but he didn‚Äôt seem to be able to close it. Something was horribly, desperately wrong.
‚ÄúT-Tony,‚Äù Steve said, swallowing. ‚ÄúTony‚Äôs the best Avenger. Iron Man. Tony designed that suit himself. He flew a nuke into a wormhole to save New York, never knowing if he would survive. He invited all of us into his home and that one act allowed us to become a true team. A family. Everything he‚Äôs achieved has been through his own ingenuity, intelligence and hard work. He‚Äôs generous to a fault, too. I uh‚Äî ‚Äù Steve trailed off.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll take your word for it.‚Äù Tony wrinkled his nose in disgust as he peered at it. ‚ÄúAre those pickles?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou can talk to me if you want to, Tony. I mean. I care about you. A‚Äî A lot, actually. So if you wanted to talk then‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúCatcha later, Bruce, and uh-- Stud--Stev--Rog--Cap, Ha!‚Äù His voice sounded about three octaves higher than Steve was used to hearing. In another second he‚Äôd disappeared through the doorway, and then they heard his footsteps echoing speedily away down the hall.
Tony‚Äôs eyes widened and he blinked. Slowly, as Steve watched he flushed a delightful shade of pale pink. ‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù His mouth opened and closed like a goldfish. ‚ÄúUh‚Äî‚Äù
And Steve wouldn't have believed it possible five minutes ago, but he really was; as Steve watched that pale pink flush Tony sported darkened, spreading down his neck, and over the tips of his ears.
That was a ridiculous sentiment. The Avengers had been a thing since the battle with the Chitauri, had been living together in Avengers Tower for a whole year. They were more than a team now. They were a
At that, Tony went completely and utterly still, his eyes darting down to look at where Steve‚Äôs hand covered his. ‚ÄúUh‚Äî S-Steve?‚Äù he said, and his voice broke slightly over the word.
‚ÄúYeah. No. Right. You‚Äôre a straight talker. I just. Um. Uh‚Äî No. Oh no. God that‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù Tony swallowed, blinking furiously. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he hissed under his breath, ducking his head. ‚ÄúThis is gonna be so inconvenient.‚Äù
It was awful. Awful how wonderful Allison was. She was funny and kind and more than held her own against Tony. All Steve could do was keep smiling and hope that none of them noticed he was dying on the inside.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Steve muttered. ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm‚Äî‚Äù His vision swam. From the feel of it he‚Äôd probably broken a couple of ribs, and maybe his leg. Not to mention the scorching burn that covered most of his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre ok, Tony,‚Äù he said, and promptly passed out.
Steve tried to sit up, his ears were ringing, but the serum was kicking in. Or it would do, any minute. Geez, everything hurt. ‚ÄúAre we good now?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúUh,‚Äù Tony sat back in his chair. A look of confusion passed over his face for a fleeting second, but he soon straightened his shoulders and shot Steve his trademark smirk. ‚ÄúYeah, well. That‚Äôs me. Generous. Handsome. Intelligent. Charming.‚Äù He waggled his eyebrows.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying,‚Äù Tony said, as he and Steve walked into the kitchen at Avengers Tower together a week or so later, once Steve was fully recovered. ‚ÄúI could make you one too. They‚Äôre good. Don‚Äôt take my word for it. Ask Rhodey!‚Äù
The first morning it happened, the Avengers were all sitting around the table for family brunch. It had become a Sunday morning tradition in the last year or so‚Äî assuming there wasn‚Äôt some kind of imminent crisis brewing.
Tony didn‚Äôt answer for a long moment. When Steve glanced up to look at him, he was standing a few feet away, blinking rapidly, face a little pale.
They alighted on the landing pad at Avengers Tower a moment later, and Steve released his grip on the armor.
Reluctantly Steve reached out a hand for the remote, and as he did, Tony said, ‚ÄúIt just‚Äî I guess it felt like I wasn‚Äôt all in, y‚Äôknow? And it seemed like she was, or she could be eventually and‚Äî‚Äù He trailed off.
Steve had always been an early riser, up well before Tony on any given day, (assuming Tony went to bed at all, and didn‚Äôt just hole up in his workshop). Plus there was the fact that Allison worked long shifts at the NYP Morgan Stanley Children‚Äôs Hospital, so she wasn‚Äôt around all the time anyway. All of that meant that Steve just had to find a way to make himself scarce on the occasional evening where Tony did bring her back to the tower.
‚ÄúYeah! Yes. Of course I will.‚Äù Tony hurried over to where Steve was waiting, and pressed the buttons in a flurry of activity. They stood side by side, Tony‚Äôs shoulder bumping companionably against Steve‚Äôs, while the coffee machine did it‚Äôs thing.
Steve held his breath as Tony crossed the room and slumped next to him on the couch, their knees knocking together. This close, Steve could see how tired he looked, there were dark circles under his eyes.
Sure, in the days that followed Tony seemed distant. Well. Not distant. Not precisely that. There was a change though, a tangible change in his behaviour, particularly around Steve.
Across from them Bruce glanced up, gaze flitting between them both with interest. Steve didn‚Äôt pay him too much mind.
A giant mutant lizard creature, that Tony insisted on calling Godzilla, had appeared out of the murky depths of the Hudson and found its way to the Lower East Side. When they finally caught up with it, the team had it cornered by a couple of abandoned office buildings, and were employing a pincer maneuver with Clint, Thor and Hulk coming from one side, and Steve, Tony and Nat on the other.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù Bruce added, ‚ÄúBecause I caught Clint trying to do a keg stand with that barrel of mead Thor brought back from Asgard last week.‚Äù
Nevertheless, for three whole days, unless they were training or attending a briefing, Steve only saw Tony at the occasional mealtime. Any conversation was necessary for the team, and carefully cordial, none of the usual banter.
‚ÄúYou said this was a sanctuary. A judgement free sanctuary,‚Äù Bruce pointed out, as he crammed more of the offending eggs into his mouth and chewed. ‚ÄúAnd besides,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs delicious.‚Äù
It was Nat and Thor‚Äôs turn to cook this morning, and they were both surprisingly good at it. Although Thor tended to assume he needed to make enough food for all Asgard. The table was piled high with bacon and eggs, pancakes, fruit and waffles, fresh coffee and fruit juice. The whole team was together, and Steve felt something a lot like pride rise in his chest.
‚ÄúWait! Someone‚Äôs getting married? Who?‚Äù He tapped the earpiece again, and it crackled to life, but not before it emitted an ear piercing shriek of feedback that made Steve wince.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like it? What about a haunt? Or a sanctuary. A refuge? Whatever.‚Äù He waved a hand. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is‚Äî we make our own rules. You wanna do ill-advised keg stands with god-tier alcohol, knock yourself out. You wanna put barbecue sauce on scrambled eggs at
In the end it was five weeks in before Steve crossed paths with them at all. On the morning in question he‚Äôd just come back from a run, and found them sitting in the kitchen area together. Tony was making smoothies, and Allison was perched on a stool, watching him.
‚ÄúNothing. Ha!‚Äù Tony laughed and there was a slight manic edge to it. ‚ÄúI mean work. I have work. Inconvenient work. In my workshop. That I ought to be uh‚Äî working on. So.‚Äù
The ease with which Tony said it made Steve flinch back imperceptibly. And although he didn‚Äôt think Allison noticed, Tony definitely did. He sent Steve a slight, questioning look.
Clint, who had shuffled in behind Steve, eyes still crusted with sleep, slumped noisily into the chair next to him and sighed.
For the rest of that afternoon Steve lay on his bed in his quarters and wondered how he could have been so blind.
Now, in the quiet of his room, it seemed obvious: Tony had been declaring his intentions‚Äî had been trying, to‚Äî to
Tony couldn‚Äôt shrug very well in the armor, at least not when flying, and certainly not while flying
‚ÄúOk, fine,‚Äù he grumped. ‚ÄúBut at least let me redesign the suit you have. It can be the same style if that‚Äôs what you want! Just the material they used is so‚Äî‚Äù He makes a face. ‚ÄúI have a light weight alloy I‚Äôve developed that will still allow you flexibility‚Äî‚Äù Here he pouted in Steve‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúBut will be more durable, resistant to extreme temperatures and‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúMy armor is flexible!‚Äù Tony said, stung. ‚ÄúSuper flexible. And, added bonus, don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve noticed, but it can fly. Can‚Äôt get more flexible than that.‚Äù
‚ÄúOhhh.‚Äù Steve wasn‚Äôt sure what his face is doing, but it didn‚Äôt seem to be under his conscious control anymore, and he was pretty sure the expression it currently wore was not appropriate for: My best buddy just broke up with his girl. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs. I‚Äôm sorry, Tony. Is that‚Äî do you want to talk about it?‚Äù
‚ÄúI wondered if you wanna go grab a bite at that new deli on 8th.‚Äù Tony twisted his hands in front of him, his expression taking on that weirdly expectant quality again.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs inconvenient?‚Äù Steve reached out to touch Tony‚Äôs arm, but Tony flinched back like he‚Äôd been burned.
He didn‚Äôt get what he‚Äôd done wrong, and he couldn‚Äôt seem to get close enough to Tony to ask for an explanation.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Tony said, ‚ÄúUnless there‚Äôs anything else‚Äî?‚Äù his gaze slid over to Steve in a silent question.
‚ÄúLair sounds kind of evil,‚Äù Bruce said absently, as he shovelled a forkful of eggs into his mouth, and swiped at the Starkpad which rested on the table in front of him.
‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù Tony flipped up the faceplate, and walked forward. Immediately the floor started to shift either side of him as robotic arms rose up through it and started to strip him out of the suit. As Steve walked past him he whistled long and low. ‚ÄúGotta say, your ass looks great in that new suit, snugglebug. Whoever designed your old SHIELD one really didn‚Äôt know how to appreciate your ass-ets.‚Äù
‚ÄúChange of plans,‚Äù said Clint. ‚ÄúAfter what happened last night, she went solo. I‚Äôll stick around for the moment just in case those robo-dicks come back; she‚Äôll call me if she needs me.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat big day?‚Äù Steve said, as he scrubbed a hand across his face, swiping at the sweat that beaded on his brow. There was a sound like static in his earpiece, and the voices of the other Avengers kept fading in and out.
‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Steve said, smiling up at him loopily. There must have been blood trickling out the corner of his mouth, because he could feel it, could taste it on his tongue. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ok.‚Äù
In his mind he replayed every single interaction between himself and Tony over the last year. The invitation to the deli. The muffins at shield headquarters. The art exhibit. Oh god‚Äî
Then, in a moment that nobody had predicted, the damn thing opened its mouth and shot a huge fiery energy blast straight at Tony. In a moment of panic, Steve somersaulted off a nearby building, knocking Tony out of the way. Unfortunately that meant he, and the empty office building behind him, bore the brunt of the hit.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor‚Äù Steve continued, forging bravely onwards, determined to finish now he‚Äôd started. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor to be here, on this team with you, and to be invited to live in your home.‚Äù
Truthfully, up until that moment he hadn‚Äôt even considered the possibility of dating Tony. Not that he was opposed to dating a man, he knew himself that well at least. It was just that Steve had filed Tony away in a box marked ‚Äòfriend‚Äô and ‚Äòteammate,‚Äô and left him there. He‚Äôd taken all the cute names and flirting and assumed it was just Tony being, well‚Äî
Sure, they still argued with each other, but a lot of the heat seemed to have gone out of it. With time and shared experience it had mellowed into something easier and almost‚Äî fun? Steve found he liked bickering with Tony. Too many people were nervous around him, treating him with reverence one minute, or with kid gloves the next; both were frustrating in different ways. Tony never seemed to have that problem‚Äî either he didn‚Äôt feel obliged to coddle Steve, or maybe he just lacked the verbal filter to stop himself saying exactly what he thought. Whichever it was, Steve found it refreshing.
Steve never once batted an eye at any of Tony‚Äôs flirting, or the endearments. Tony had names for everyone. Literally, everyone. He was charming, and funny, and handsome, and sometimes he directed that charm at Steve, but it didn‚Äôt mean anything. It was just part of who he was.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were gonna be here,‚Äù Tony said to Clint. ‚ÄúI thought you and Nat were headed out to Budapest first thing.‚Äù
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let Godzilla blast you,‚Äù Steve said stubbornly. For a smart guy, Tony was so stupid sometimes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a team. You‚Äôre‚Äî You‚Äî‚Äù He lifted an arm and gestured at Tony, who was still glaring at him.
Clint‚Äôs eyes darted to Steve, then to Tony, and then, for some reason, back to Steve again. He sighed heavily, and eyed the basket of muffins, then reached for a blueberry one. ‚ÄúYeah, ok.‚Äù
After the battle was over, and it was clear that Tony had survived and everything was gonna be ok, the Avengers decided to stay together; they helped to rebuild the city, and Steve found that he coped more easily with the more abrasive edges of Tony‚Äôs personality in the weeks that followed. The endless snark, the weird jokes that were peppered with obscure cultural references, the flirting, and yes, the random nicknames, all became part of Tony‚Äôs undeniable charm.
As the first glimpse of daylight appeared above him, Steve blinked, looked around hazily, and tried to work out why he was seeing two of everything.
‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Allison grinned at Steve. ‚ÄúTotal mutual appreciation society. Looks like I‚Äôve got competition, Tony.‚Äù Grinning at Tony, she took his hand and squeezed it tight.
‚ÄúWell in that case,‚Äù Steve deadpanned, and cocked a hip, and then did his best supermodel strut off the landing pad.
Three of them were sitting at the table in the dining area, Tony sipping his coffee, while Steve and Bruce ate breakfast. They‚Äôd officially been living at Avengers Tower for a whole week now, and it still felt kind of magical to Steve.
So Tony had infuriated him at first, rubbed him up the wrong way. Made Steve want to get all up in Tony‚Äôs face and just‚Äî just‚Äî do
The calls stopped an hour or so later, the texts around lunchtime, and Steve let out a breath of relief. He focussed on his work and grabbed a beer and some Chinese take out on the way home.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ride you, and then we‚Äôre taking a hot shower.‚Äù Tony promised Steve, licking the blond‚Äôs neck and eliciting another shudder from the blonde.
‚ÄúYes, and you know why? Because you‚Äôre mine, honey, every inch of gold brown skin and that perfect ass is mine, and I can‚Äôt wait to wreck it.‚Äù
‚ÄúCos√¨ perfetto, ragazzo mio, non fermarti.‚Äù Tony begged, and Steve didn‚Äôt think of stopping. Not until he had given Tony the best orgasm of his life, not until he heard more of that delicious Italian from Tony‚Äôs plush and kiss swollen lips.
‚ÄúOf course I did, sweetheart.‚Äù He said, voice laced with affection. ‚ÄúAnd you get to take me out on any fancy date you want to prove it.‚Äù
‚ÄúTony... I think I might be in love with you.‚Äù Steve confessed softly.  For a brief moment, shock settled on Tony‚Äôs face, and Steve was afraid he‚Äôd messed up. He was about to apologise when Tony put on an unreadable expression.
When he came back to his senses, Tony was smiling down at him, softly threading a hand through his hair.
‚ÄúAre you aware we have all the contacts in your phone Mr stark? There seems to be one number that calls you a lot. What if we pay them a visit?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to finger you open, and then I‚Äôll just slide into you and fuck you hard and deep until you forget your own name. I‚Äôll make true on my promise, you won‚Äôt be sitting comfortably for a week.‚Äù He whispered huskily,  making Tony shiver.  Steve added a second finger and kissed Tony deeply. Their tongues fought for dominance and Tony was rolling his hips to get more of the fingers inside him.
‚ÄúI take it you like it.‚Äù He breathed. Tony chuckled and licked the other nipple teasingly, before continuing downward and lavishing the six-pack Steve worked so hard for.
His four-year old self was still fidgeting non-stop and Natasha was at her wit's end trying to calm him down.
He squeezed his daddy lightly as a response, and he felt Steve's smile as a kiss was placed in his curls once again.
He scuttled a little closer. She made no sign that she wanted him to stop. He shuffled closer and closer until he could place his head on her shoulder. Tony let out an adorable squeak, to ask if he could go further. Nat looked down into his doe-eyes and couldn't help but grin fondly. She nodded and tilted her head so Tony could breathe in her scent where it was strongest at her gland.
"Ah, Nat..." Bucky pulled her in for a tight hug and she breathed in his scent deeply as if it was the last time.
"I- I- uhm..." Steve stammered hopelessly, and Tony continued to stare, as if he was contemplating whether or not to take Steve to a repair shop for this malfunction!
She tried distracting herself by making some coffee and watching a re-run of her favorite telenovela, but it was no use. Half an hour later, Natasha was back to pacing again.
His hands gripped Tony's shoulders and Steve ever so gently shoved him down onto the bed, before climbing on top of him. The kiss never broke. Tony's hands were carding through Steve's hair and the genius let out a soft moan.
The scientist stared at him curiously. He scanned Steve's eyes, his own eyes guarded and yet, wanting to let himself be open enough to believe Steve's words.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the news? Is he okay? What‚Äôs the diagnosis?‚Äù Pepper‚Äôs frantic questions were going a mile a minute.
"But," he continued, "She has to solve this case with the help of a fox, Nick Wilde. And Nick... you uhm... you get to learn of his troubled past. You get to see h-how he grew up... being bullied... And...¬† hi-his main insecurity is that, uhm, that the world will- will never see him as something outside of being a trickster. A liar."
"Now, Mr Barnes," Tony smiled, "I don't blame you for thinking that you're in trouble. And I most certainly don't blame you for what happened."
The cars pulled up to the starting line, engines revving. Natasha gave a respectful nod to Steve before placing her focus on the road ahead.
"Yes, well, I thought it would best to give Tony some space for now," Steve replied, his eyes going cold.
He stood in front of the great brass statue. The memorial for the greatest defender of Earth. The greatest Avenger.
Tony remained silent for a few moments more, staring at the wall. His chest rose and fell steadily, and he finally turned to the blonde.
Steve wasted no time engulfing Tony in the biggest bear hug, cradling the brunette's head beneath his neck.
"Steve Rogers. Brooklyn boy, aye?" she tilted her head, her assessing gaze still sharp, "I heard Brooklyn boys like it rough and tough. So, what kind of tough are you looking for in New York City, then?"
to say that it's good to have you back. And thank you for bringing My Love back to me in one piece."
that happened between the two of them. Steve couldn't explain it, but Tony's magnetic persona had drawn him in and he was hooked.
Tony wound his arms around his daddy's back and hugged him tightly. He rested the side of his head on Steve's shoulder.
Natasha strolled out of a side room, her entire forearm bandaged from a gash that a bot had clawed onto her.
I'm going to be really cruel and just divide this into two more chapters! üòÇüòà But they'll be like short ones, like Chapter 1, but I just think it's better like that that to have a long, dragged out chapters with smudged plot points. Each chapter just deals with a different major plot point, so I like starting fresh like that: having everything described and felt under one issue- one chapter- and start off with a new one, with the previous issue still relatable. üòäüìñ
It nagged at the blonde when Tony tried for humor to deflect his real emotions, but he granted the brunette the benefit of the doubt this time, since it
With as much sensitivity as an AI could possibly muster, Jarvis continued to console Tony as best he could, in his current Little Headspace, after calculating that a nightmare such as that, would indeed trigger him into such a state.
‚ÄúIf Tony is hiding somewhere only Tony would hide, then there‚Äôs now way to discover that hiding place now. But I do hope he‚Äôs at least keeping warm. God knows I‚Äôd want to stay in a hot bath and bundle up away from all things scary.‚Äù
The glass pierced Tony's skin, the shards digging deep into his flesh. Howard stood with his arm still outstretched, poised from throwing his son with the wine bottle. In one swipe, he grabbed Tony by the scruff of his collar, breathing his alcohol-stench into his son's face.
With Tony blinking wide-eyed in Steve's oversized clothes, Steve himself couldn't help giggling softly at how lucky he was to witness his adorable boyfriend.
Steve let him go and watched in amazement as Nat pulled him for a huge bear hug and kissed his temple. Tony whined at the pampering, but Nat just peppered more kisses onto the side of his face!
The little girl smiled, ‚ÄúTo be honest, he wasn‚Äôt a good storyteller. Mom had to help him most times, but when he was
Thank you SOO SO much for everyone who still leaves kudos and comments on this series - it does make me feel good to know that people still like it! üíô I don't really have an updating schedule, but I maybe have like 2 or three more chapters to post of this installment and then I'll plan a 3rd fanfic to this series, if you guys still want it. So please bear with me and stay tuned for the last run!
‚Äù Steve replied firmly, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre caring and selfless and intelligent, and you‚Äôre scared that if you aren‚Äôt perfect, people are going to leave you, because you‚Äôve never had someone love you as you are, but believe me when I tell you that I want to be one of those that
"You're a remarkable person, Tony. And life's too short to let remarkable people slip through your fingers."
After supervising him undercover as Natalie Rushman, the spy couldn't stop herself from falling in love with just about every aspect of Tony, just like many others had done.
Hacking coughs heaved through him as Tony let his sobbing echo off the bathroom walls. He clutched at his chest desperately, hoping that the pain would stop. His throat burned as he tried to swallow his tears thick as steel.
He was shaken out of it by Natasha literally holding his arms to his sides and rattling him out of his panic.
Tony saw stars dancing above him as he climaxed, shouting out Steve's name, and he marveled at how beautiful his lover looked in the afterglow!
Steve got up last, soley because of a small brunette who was fast asleep in his arms, wrapped up in a blanket burrito. Tony mumbled in his sleep and wrinkled his nose adorably,
Pepper, Happy and Rhodey took shifts each day to keep the paparazzi at bay who swarmed like vultures around the hospital every second.
‚ÄúPerfect! Give me at least twenty minutes and I‚Äôll be up there before Aragorn can give another motivational speech!‚Äù
"You're my only hope, Tony, to not give up. If you go‚Ä¶ then I'm done. I'll put the shield aside for good. And I can respect that - I can respect you going‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ if- if there's a chance you'd say yes to‚Ä¶ to stay?"
With some probing from Sam, Bucky made a shy appearance bringing Tony some flowers. Pepper embraced him gladly, shocking the soldier.
It was the strangest thing to Nat to see her friend sleep so soundly, to appear so calm, when his mind could be a whirlwind of storms that they couldn't even see. The team stood heartbroken as each of them brought 'get-well-soon' cards and gifts. Thor broke down completely, blubbering like a small babe when he caught sight of his frail teammate lying so small and helpless in his bed.
To the untrained eye, her glare would appear very leathal, but on the Spy Twin's scale, it was quite moderate.
Worry then filled his face, ‚ÄúOh no, I didn‚Äôt miss your birthday, did I? Or an anniversary? Oh God- F.R.I.D.A.Y, pull up the-‚Äú
Tony stretched out a hand to hold on to the side of Steve's face and Steve leaned right into the motion again, as if it was sixth sense. Tony felt honored to be worthy of Steve's love. The soldier was beautiful and kind and good and pure.
It felt like forever when he finally pulled up to Steve's house. He parked his bike against Steve's own by the wall and breathed heavily, collecting himself before he knocked.
Natasha admired Tony's intelligence, his bravery, his heart of gold, his grit and his perseverance - though she would never admit to it aloud.
The alpha slowly turned his body, and came face to face with Tony, stricken and shivering with shock.
As soon as that thought came into his head, something very pure and warm good glowed in Tony's chest and a soft, dopey grin donned his face. Steve was smiling dopily back!
you did it. You're an alpha who has needs, just as many as the average omega. Your rut was pretty close too, so the feral-ness of your behavior was like, at least, thirty percent influenced by that."
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it!‚Äù Steve jumped up faster than lightning, surprising everyone, and even himself. Shocked and quizzical expressions met his blushing face.
The space-ship finally touched down on the lawn. The new glowing woman, Carol Danvers, had just rescued the two lost team members from the void of space. Once Nebula made sure that Tony could walk on his own, she made her way over to Rocket, hugging him tightly.
I know it's quite short, but it's kind of like an introduction to the chaos that's about to arrive...
Wanda knew that after Ultron, she‚Äôd need to work to build trust between her teammates. This was the first time she‚Äôd ever had to use her magic since Sokovia, so it was still a significant adjustment for the team.
After splashing around with Tony in the bath, and making soap bubble beards and mustaches, Steve dried him off and bundled Tony up in his favourite kitty onesie.
‚ÄúS-Steve?‚Äù Tony tried again, his voice a bit stronger, but it still came out as a tiny mouse‚Äôs whimper.
. I already messed up. I blew my chance. I went to see him once and I doubt Pepper will allow it again."
And everyone else looked completely fine. They were all laughing and drinking soda and Tony had been having fun the whole night.
Jenny gripped Steve‚Äôs shoulders tight and sat him down in one of the hospital chairs closest to her desk. She knelt in front of him, rubbing his arm reassuringly. She was young, blond with red highlights and doe-brown eyes like Tony‚Äôs.
‚ÄúShh, shh‚Ä¶ there we go now‚Ä¶ shh‚Ä¶ aw, such a good omega- yes! So sweet and brave and so smart!‚Äù she crooned, nuzzling his nose fondly. Tony blushed a dusty pink, but he purred happily and burrowed as close as he could to absorb her warm summer-scent. Elation washed over Nat as Tony‚Äôs breathing evened out and his calmed scent resonated around her.
His heart fractured as he listened to his boy choke up like that and he tried, desperately, to hold his Little Tony as close as possible to stop his shivering.
"Hi, My Baby Boy," Steve said lovingly, as he stroked through Tony's soft, brown curls and the genius snuggled closer under the blankets with Steve, to settle. He closed his eyes and hummed at the contact.
"Well, your vitals seem up to standard‚Ä¶ no sign of brain damage, but I'd like to keep you for a few more days just to run some basic health tests and scans," Stephen smiled at his patient.
wrong Aunty Nat," the little brunette blushed and ducked his head sheepishly, embarrassed that he would make fun of Steve when he wasn't there.
Steve's heart shattered at those words. He pulled Tony close to him, kissing him softly. Steve's kisses felt like home. They felt like clouds you could fly amongst forever.
‚ÄúI love you too, Tony. I‚Äôll make sure to clean up later, but make sure to get some sleep now, Kotynok,‚Äù she pulled him closer protectively, humming a soft lullaby as Tony‚Äôs breathing evened out and he fell into a deep sleep.
I'm not saying who, but please keep that in mind and I will update my tags before I post another chapter
Steve surprised himself at how quickly he wanted to remember and file that information. What surprised him even more were the sudden questions his brain longed to ask Rhodey:
He laughed too, almost breathlessly and flushed even more, "I'll take that as a compliment!" Another pause.
Tony was cuddled up to Steve's side (and was using Steve's bicep as his own pillow!) and Steve just used the arm tucked under Tony, to wrap his Little genius, securely against him, and gently stroke his baby's hip.
"That's for the ninety-eight percent you got on your report, you slag. What? Were you getting some girl pregnant? I didn't raise my son to be useless."
Tony handed him the anti-septic, grinning. Before Steve could go any further, Tony's words made him stop and think.
She heard the shred of shame in his voice. Even through Loki‚Äôs magic, Tony, from a young age, was still pushed to be brave and perfect. She understood him in that way and could relate.
A smile subconsciously began to form on her face at the thought of spending some time with her genius best friend!
'Mmmmhhmm...' Tony hummed contently. 'Feels nice... Feel too warm... Uugghh! Too hot! Mhmum... Why do I feel so hot? Ugh, it's like fire! Cold isn't working!'
"What? What are you going on about now?" Steve chuckled and couldn't help but smile fondly at the genius.
he thought to himself. The captain brushed away the thought, but it became increasingly a little more difficult with the quiet moans Tony let slip through his lips. Steve was careful when massaging in the ointment, but he never thought it would have
‚ÄúThankfully so. Zoology tends to leads to a veterinarian job and I don‚Äôt think I can handle animals spending more of my husband‚Äôs time than me.‚Äù
He sprinted to the ship's ramp, gripping a frail Tony into his arms with breathless tears streaming down his face. Tony's eyes danced in a daze and it took a moment for him to focus on who held him.
No sooner had the words left her mouth, did Doctor Strange come walking through the door to the waiting area.
This one was not at all hesitant! It was heated, it was steady and Tony was overwhelmed by Steve's presence.
Feigning obliviousness, Steve called out to the silent room, ‚ÄúOh, I sure do hope my brave superhero is alright! I‚Äôd like to run him a nice warm bath to take away all his worries.‚Äù
"Aunt Peggy would tell stories about you. Not just of Captain America, but Steve Rogers. The boy who willingly jumped on top of a grenade to protect his men. Who wanted to protect his country. To fight for his country... Who's also very brave and very gentle and... who I'm telling is going to regret the decision of taking a chance on me."
Tony snuggled deep as he could into Steve's side, as his Daddy continued to sing and rub his hip gently, both of their hands still intertwined between them.
Sighing, she couldn't still help but grin at Tony's bouncing behavior and the spy couldn't help the excitement creeping into her own skin either!
Natasha finally let the squealing toddler go, still laughing herself, but no sooner, did she suddenly get the air punched out of her with an almighty
The sky thundered with wrath and cracked open with lightning tendrils spiking across the midnight blue hue. Clouds dipped in shades of black and grey ink, brought forth warnings of oncoming hailstorms.
If you were bonded, then that would be a different case, but you are not listed as Mr Stark‚Äôs closest kin, so I cannot let you see him now,‚Äù the nurse‚Äôs name tag read Jenny.
Steve smiled, thinking how smug Tony would feel at that compliment, but secretly, he‚Äôd be quite shy and flattered behind the paparazzi‚Äôs eyes.
Something that she also grew to love about the brunette was how he treated people and the good he hoped to accomplish with Stark Industries.
When he turned the corner again, he found a small, skinny boy blinking up at him with tear-filled, owlish eyes.
You love me and I know it's true; I believe it. I trust it! And I'm sure of that, because... because
But Barton wasn't stupid,contrary to popular belief. He'd figured out that the intensity of Natasha's stares was caused,
But Steve gingerly tapped his fingers under Tony's chin and lifted up the genius' beautiful, teary face.
Said toddler widened his own eyes in horror and gasped, "But Aunty Nat, I can't have that for lunch!"
Pepper Potts tried feebly to hold Rhodey back, but she wasn‚Äôt fast enough, before Rhodey gripped Steve by his shirt and shoved him straight against the wall! Steve felt the wind punched out of him as he was strung up a few centimetres off the floor.
Tony‚Äôs entire body stiffened as he gasped for air, overwhelmed as tears filled his eyes. It was all so much. It all felt too much.
So this chapter dives a little bit into a kind of "soulmates" theory-narrative. So it's an a/b/o with a hint of soulmate theory sprinkled in too - just to give the world building some shape and form.
The city was wrapped in darkness. And the Avengers were doing no better. J.A.R.V.I.S had the heat up to seventy percent and still, everybody preferred to remain in each other‚Äôs company to keep warm. Blankets bundled around, everyone curled around each other while they continued their Harry Potter marathon.
... He let everything from that moment come forward and he launched himself at Steve! Tears poured over and Tony kissed him deeeply!
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry!" he blurted out, hiding his face in Steve's neck. He needed Steve close to him, he needed to breathe in his boyfriend's scent.
"I call it taking a chance," he said, grinning, "Let me take a chance on you. And take a chance on me Tony- let me take care of you."
In one swift movement, Steve stood and pulled Tony into his arms! He cradled the brunette‚Äôs head softly against his shoulder and was mindful of his hurt, bandaged arm.
Steve clenched his teeth, willing the gut-wrenching sob to be forced back down, but it was futile. His hand shook over the statue‚Äôs heart, clutching at the air and hoping it was the cloth of Tony‚Äôs shirt to grip in his hands. Willing it to be Tony‚Äôs warm flesh beneath his clothes to hold against Steve‚Äôs own.
. Can‚Äôt you tone this storm down so I, at least, don‚Äôt have to worry about Tony electrocuting himself?‚Äù
His eyebrows scrunched up, his gaze wandering away. Nat leaned in attentively - it was always miraculous to hear these things from Tony.
The door opened wide. Tony's breath caught slightly in his throat. Then‚Ä¶ his lips quirked up into his signature lop-sided grin.
The genius gave Steve another crooked, and yet fond, smirk in amusement. Steve found himself blushing.
‚ÄúDoll, don‚Äôt worry your pretty little head about it. Just tell me where you last saw it and I‚Äôll be sure to catch it.‚Äù
Tony breathed deep and hard in relief. His cock was all shrivelled now, trying to climb back into his body, but he couldn't care less about that right now.
He looked at his reflected image on the glass of the wide window, superposed onto the night time view of Manhattan. Then he straightened his stance as much as he could and squared his shoulders. He was short for an alpha. But he was well built, all compact muscle. Maybe his own image should have looked foreign to him, but it didn‚Äôt. It felt familiar. Even with his ‚Äòalpha scowl‚Äô and tight shoulders.
He didn't really believe the guy would take the deal, because they'd never let any dominant into the room with Tony before screening him to within an inch of his life to make sure his motives matched Fury's. The dom was probably a perfect SHIELD drone that never did anything wrong.
But the night of the fundraiser he had seen Tony under an entirely new light. The sexual instinct Tony‚Äôs heat had woken up in him was transitory. It was strong yes, but still, sex alone wasn‚Äôt the reason he had started to look at Tony through new eyes. It was learning about Tony‚Äôs secret and everything that came after that.
Exactly at 12 o'clock on the dot, Tony served the pasta. Simple penne with cream and mushroom sauce out of a ready made packet, with sad looking basil leaves on top with grated parmesan that simply did not look nearly as elegant as it did in the book. The pasta had turned out soggy and all clumped together so Tony had ended up having to try and seperate them by hand. Eventually he'd managed to produce one somewhat proper looking plate out of it and was now nervously waiting for the verdict, standing there only in an apron and a cock cage, rubbing his hands.
"You're gonna spank me now aren't you? Or wash my mouth with soap? Come up with some weird humiliating punishment?"
"I said language. I don't really mind your attitude in the field but in here, my submissive is going to be respectful at all times."
With that, a big hand cupped Tony's balls with a finger pressed right behind them and the palm around his cock started to really work him.
"No. You have to trust me Tony, I have to earn that trust. If I let you get away, you'd never trust me as your dom."
‚ÄúGo to R&D labs today. I want you to stay there and keep working on learning about the tech. You‚Äôre strictly forbidden from trying to pry information about yourself. I want you to familiarize yourself with the people here first. If you want to make friends, I think the guys down in R&D will be happy to have you around and help you. It‚Äôs also better than flirting with young agents to get info about SHIELD‚Äôs projects. ‚Äù
The Captain stopped and Tony closed his eyes, preparing himself for the shame that was about to follow.
"Hey Steve, I'm done, where do you want me to leave the shirts?" he asked as he walked upstairs with arms full of coat hangers.
He jumped into the ambulance and saw the look on Coulson‚Äôs face just before the doors were shut. Then he turned to look at Tony. Tony was looking at him with clear relief. Steve smiled at him and tried to swallow the ominous feeling that told him the situation would get much worse before Tony got better.
Then came the part about Agent Romanov and Agent Barton, which, after the Norse god story, fell a bit flat. Steve thought Tony only needed to meet Natasha in person and to watch Clint in action to understand why they were on equal ground with a Norse God on a battle field.
"Look, about last night. You shouldn't pay attention to what I say after a spanking like that. I wasn't myself, I spill stupid crap sometimes when I'm out of my head. It's dumb really."
"Yeah.." Steve replied and walked off towards the bathroom without glancing at the breakfast Tony had laid out.
"Settle in. You have ten minutes. After that I want you to come to the living room, completely  naked."
Coulson had whisked Tony away, no doubt to get him to crack and find out what Steve hadn‚Äôt been telling him on his debrief. Steve had warned Tony about Coulson, and Tony was far from stupid, but still Steve worried.
For all his outward apperance of a casanova, Tony Stark was a man who believed in freedom and despised the abuse the current culture was forcing the omegas into. Steve highly respected that.  Compared to the 40‚Äôs, he could see the huge progress in omega rights but the wider access to information had also opened his eyes to the true scope of the abuse omegas went through.
He licked along Tony‚Äôs throat, then bit harshly. Tony keened but held still, his hands came to a halt with his fingers still firmly dug in Steve‚Äôs shoulders but all Steve felt was the surrender of his prey. He could taste the nuances on Tony‚Äôs skin and feel the tendons stretch under his teeth. It must have hurt but Steve wanted it to hurt just that little bit, to make Tony remember, to mark him.
When the car stopped, Tony startled to see when Rogers said 'home', he meant his own home, not the Stark tower.
"Did anyone physically hurt you or threaten to hurt you, or threaten a loved one, a family member? Were you in any way unable to say no without harm to yourself or anyone else?"
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long story. And one that I‚Äôm not sure I know the details of. I don‚Äôt want to mislead you. Maybe it‚Äôs best if you remembered on your own.‚Äù
Immediately Rogers reached out a hand to touch his hair, finger brushing back the carefully touseled look. Tony felt a little bit like a pet.
What sort of alpha had he pretended to be? Pepper had told him that he had been a good man. The press knew him as a very generous and loving alpha to Pepper. They had told him about the charities he worked on. Those sounded good. But he couldn‚Äôt even picture himself..
"On your front." Steve's command was simple and direct. Tony rolled over and wriggled his butt with a smile over his shoulder.
He stayed inside the omega though, even when the aftershocks had faded. He let go of Tony‚Äôs shoulder and lowered himself down on the bed, and pulled Tony close.
He was completely exposed, nothing to hide, for once. And for no other reason then Steve wanted to look at him. His hole twitched, now much more conscious of the gaze that traveled over his body when his focus shifted from urgency to compliance.
Pepper gasped and Tony turned to look at her. ‚ÄúLady, you seem nice, and I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt know you.‚Äù
‚ÄúDid I?‚Äù He asked, his mind working fast on what he should ask about first. ‚ÄúSay, Dr Banner, have we ever worked together?‚Äù
"Wanna make sure I'm appropriate at all times?" Tony said sarcastically, even as he dropped his clothes on the bed. He didn't even see Rogers step inside, he simply felt the swat to his bottom.
‚ÄúShit. Agent Coulson‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve froze, very obviously caught in the act of cuddling Tony Stark on the couch. The scent of distressed and content omega was distinct in the air, since Tony opted out of using cologne in his own house since the accident.
‚ÄúTony.. Your amnesia has complicated.. some things.‚Äù Steve started and at that Tony did give him his full attention.
"...known all along. We never actually said we were together. Everyone just assumed. Not my problem if it makes you guys look like a bunch of gossipy school girls. I guess that's the professional hazard of sticking your nose into peoples private lives. But seriously, Pepper is family. She's just happy that I'm happy."
"Because I'm not going to fuck you over the spreader, you're clearly nervous about not having control over the situation and this whole thing is about trying to take back control. Not going to happen. Now come here before I come and get you."
"You were being a spoiled brat." She said as she fixed the cufflink, but she was smiling. Tony shrugged, "Steve said something along those lines too. It's part of the Stark charm."
But he pulled himself together fast, not wanting to lose his chance at finding out about the amazing adventures of the Iron Man. The name still sounded a little ridiculous to him, but what Banner was talking about sounded like the coolest stuff ever.
"Good boy." he said. This time the praise didn't feel as condescending. Well, it did, but that wasn't so bad.
Dropping his mop and bucket for a moment, he took the penny to his room to tuck it in a safe pocket. When he returned to pick up his mop, he was whistling to himself.
"Uh well, I don't know why that would make you slam Rhodey around but.. Um I remembered I had some things I had to take care of. So." Tony shrugged.
‚ÄúAre you alright? I mean, I was trying to see if there was any pain, or anything broken, I can‚Äôt see in this dark but you took a pretty hard hit.‚Äù
The alpha would have none of it. Instead Steve grabbed Tony below the thighs and lifted. Their chests were pressed together and Tony‚Äôs legs wrapped around Steve‚Äôs waist. The omega was hanging onto Steve‚Äôs neck for dear life, all the while moaning and pulling the alpha still closer.
Steve let out a breath over Tony‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright. I know you Tony. You‚Äôre always curious and not really good at following orders. I‚Äôm not exactly surprised. Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù Then he gently pried Tony off of his chest to look into his face, one hand carefully cradling Tony‚Äôs jaw. He felt his heart miss a beat when Tony leaned his head into his palm ever so slightly. His cheeks were flushed, and he looked at Steve with bright, scared eyes.
‚ÄúOnly until you get your memories back.‚Äù He said before making any other move, his voice came out deep and low anyway. Tony nodded his head the tiniest bit, like he was afraid of dislodging Steve‚Äôs grip. Steve tightened his fingers just a fraction and Tony‚Äôs breath hitched, the scent of arousal spiked, nowhere near close to how Tony had smelled during his heat but still enough to make Steve forget where they were. This time it was different to Tony‚Äôs heat, this time Tony was offering himself to Steve. He wasn‚Äôt unattainable. He was begging for it.
Steve came to a stop when the Turkish officers let them pass, Coulson was there in less then a second, already speaking into his comm device, followed by an army of paramedics. Steve could hear Coulson give orders to pull intel teams back, as Captain America and Ironman had both reached the border.
Steve guided him to what Tony assumed was the starting point, then the Captain's footsteps walked away from him.
‚ÄúLook I know you want me to say yes, Steve. But I..‚Äú He pulled his hand back from Pepper‚Äôs loose grasp, his tone lost the tinge of anger, going soft once more ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what this shield is you‚Äôre talking about. I don‚Äôt know where I am or.. ‚Äù
You guys know how writing is, if you've written stuff and it gets lost, its a huge motivation killer. I like this story and I don't want to abandon it completely. But I really need to rescue my notes from the hard drive. I don't know how long it'll take either.
Half an hour later Steve opened the door of his mini-office and led a very relaxed Tony out. He had done nothing more than putting the other man down, touching him, providing contact and silence. As willing and tired as Tony had been, he had gone down very fast, lying still under Steve‚Äôs exploring hands as Steve resolutely ignored both their erections. But Steve hadn‚Äôt shied away from touching him, even leaving little bite marks, just under Tony‚Äôs collar bone, where the edge of his shirt would hide it, or on the edge of the arc reactor, his stomach, just under Tony‚Äôs belly button‚Ä¶ He had touched Tony until the omega smelled like Steve the faintest bit, not enough for anyone else to notice but Tony himself and of course Steve. Tony had first lied back, shivering occasionally, and moaning, when he couldn‚Äôt keep quiet anymore. Then he had started to relax, to accept Steve‚Äôs touch, becoming familiar with the way Steve chose to handle his body and giving in. Steve thought it was beautiful. While he had buttoned Tony‚Äôs shirt back up, he had already been planning what he wanted to do to Tony when they were alone at home, what he would allow himself to do, and what he wouldn‚Äôt.
I did my research for this chapter. Meaning, I looked at wikipedia, thats all... So if you know about how body temperature works, please let me know and I'll totally fix the numbers. But even if they are wrong, I'm sure you'll get the general gist of the situation. Still, I appreciate corrections.
"I'll.. uh.. I'll run my tongue all over your cock first, I.. um I'll lick into the slit, gather every bit of your precum. I bet you taste delicious.. And I'll lick and suck your balls.. Untill you're all wet and- and you can't take it any more, that you wanna grab my hair and want to force me down on your cock.. But then I'll swallow you whole, right to the root, until my lips touch your balls.. I can Steve, I can do that.. I'll swallow around your cock.. You'll feel my throat trying to work it. You can touch my throat even and feel how you fill me up.. Oh.."
Tony‚Äôs eyes grew bigger for a moment then he frowned, looking down at his hands, where he was letting Pepper hold one. The room was silent for a while yet Steve could almost hear millions of questions running through Pepper‚Äôs mind. Finally Tony spoke. This time his voice wasn‚Äôt soft, but Steve could tell he was angry and was trying to hide it.
Tony already knew the answer but he was used to ignoring unconvenient truths. So instead he just blew his nose rudely into the tissue. Steve didn't even flinch.
‚ÄúOh, I spent the night.‚Äù He said easily and put the coffee down in front of the colonel, he couldn‚Äôt help himself but feel a little self-satisfied at the colonels expression.
"No really. I'm better off standing. In fact maybe I'll go for a walk." Tony moved to the door but at that moment the door opened to reveal Colonel James Rhodes, who pushed Tony inside and closed the door after himself.
Tony didn‚Äôt seem to mind. Actually Tony didn‚Äôt seem to mind anything. He didn‚Äôt even talk much, aside from asking for more, or another bite of pizza, or to call Steve‚Äôs name. On some level, Steve knew maybe it should be worrying but for some reason he wasn‚Äôt worried. All he could smell in their now inseparably mixed scents were satisfaction, contentment and happiness.
"What is this TRH?" Tony demanded, annoyed that two of his supposed teammates were in on something that Tony had been left out of. Fury must have been planning on cutting him out for a while since he'd never heard of this TRH thing before.
‚ÄúYou seem to be in a good mood today.‚Äù Steve commented when he swallowed his last bite and reached for another slice from Tony‚Äôs lap.
Intense pleasure shot through Tony's entire body, starting a warm tingle at his thighs and ending like a punch at the tip of his cock, he felt Steve's skin on his and his orgasm tore itself from the root of his balls, strong like he'd never felt before. Tony shook apart in his dom's hands with each wave of come that burst out of the tip of his cock.
The question seemed out of the blue but it told Steve what Tony‚Äôs primary concern was. Tony was afraid that Steve had taken advantage of him in his heat.
Steve had said he was ok with Tony being an omega and despite acting like he didn‚Äôt care, Tony cared. He cared about the Avengers and no matter how much he hated the fact that Steve now knew, it was a sort of comfort knowing that his team leader was aware of his greatest weakness. Still his contradictory emotions about the guy weighed heavily on his mind. He didn‚Äôt want to seek the comfort he had tasted as Steve had carried him, his mind kept shying away from the memory after playing it over and over during his heat and even after.. The sexual part was easier to deal with. Steve Rogers had the body of a god, he was an alpha, Tony could handle imagining his huge cock and what he could do with it. But the rest was trickier. Sex was a simple concept for him, he could get release wherever he wanted. The unmatched comfort of the scent and touch of an alpha was a different matter entirely.
"Don't tell me you didn't fuck your boss Barton. Some hot dom on dom action.. Nothing wrong with that, it's the 21st century." Tony was mostly aiming for making Barton uncomfortable but it didn't seem to work, because Barton simply nodded.
Until finally, someone deigned to tell him a guy named Bruce Banner would be coming down to the R&D to work on a special project involving gamma radiation.
"What things? For gods sake, you could have gotten lost, kidnapped, killed! I didn't know where you were! Pepper have been calling everyone we could think of and no one knew where you were Tony!" he said after he was sure Tony was unhurt and very much here, as well as accepting of Steve's touch.
‚ÄúUh.. I don‚Äôt want to be insensitive or anything but.. Tony‚Äôs scent.. I mean the heat scent, there‚Äôs something different about it.. ‚Äù
But there was nothing. Absolutely nothing, no sign that Tony had clutched at him and pleaded, almost got raped, writhed in agony as Steve watched.. No sign that Tony was angry that his secret had leaked out. Not even contempt. Tony didn‚Äôt even ignore Steve, at least no more than usual. He made his usual inappropriate jokes, strutted around  and was generally both terribly annoying and amazingly brilliant.
"If you keep giving me lip about it I'll have to think of a way to make you less eager to question every order."
"You'll be cooking dinner too, but for now, I want you to make me a sandwich. Half a plate of pasta is not going to do it for me. You can make one for yourself too if you want."
Someone needed to take the trash out, it was almost full, and starting to smell. Tony also knew how the recycling plants worked very well, so he knew he'd have to at least rinse the stuff before putting it in recycling. After that his mind engaged in how to do things, and how to do them right. So after his 5 minutes were up and Steve wandered into the kitchen, Tony had emptied the trash can, washed and put the boxes in recycling and had started to go through Steve's recycling pile, creating 3 seperate piles, while thinking about how he'd need a better system for #7 mixed recycling.
The Captain America who was holding him in place with a single hand fisted in his hair right now and basically radiating threat from every pore, making Tony's inner submissive beg for Tony to just yield, give the dom what he wanted. It would just be so humiliating but so blissful.
Steve's hand closed around his balls that were dangling between his thighs like an offering in this position. Then the hand moved even lover to stroke Tony's cock. It was already slick. Tony's moan turned guttural.
Fucking hell, but the cage was starting to get painful, he could feel his cock pressing firmly against the plastic bars now, his flesh bulging, unable to get erect.
Estimated 100 meters to the impact point. 2 more antiaircraft weapons, 1 chopper approaching in 3 o‚Äôclock and a fuck load of men swarming around the facility from the trucks that still kept coming in.
It had hit so fast, he had barely managed to finish his speech. Tony knew a normal heat shouldn‚Äôt hit him like that but he wasn‚Äôt normal, was he. He had been stupid to play it so close. He should have known better. He should have stayed home. But the event had been so important. And he had set up his infallible safety measures in the form of Pepper, in case he needed to ditch suddenly, and Happy, again, in case he did very badly need to ditch suddenly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell him, after the heat.‚Äù Steve decided. ‚ÄúAnd you find some sort of middle ground, should we give him a lower dose? Shouldn‚Äôt we? How will this effect Tony? Will he go into heat again soon?‚Äù
"Why are you taking this so personally? I am trying to do you a favor here!" Tony yelled in frustration.
baby boy, you're the only one for me, Sweetheart. The only one for me... You're so precious, you're so good! My sweet boy" he peppered kisses all over his baby's face.
Just go ahead and call Pepper when she‚Äôs already on my ass about two new upgrades I‚Äôve got to finish for Stark Industries, so that will certainly make things
A small piece of happiness came, though, when the team, one by one, came by to tell him that they had forgiven him for his mistake. Although it relieved him, it wasn't the news Steve sought after. Even his runs in the morning with Sam couldn't silence his anxiety. He tried boxing, he tried swimming, he tried sparring with Thor, Nat and Bucky and still,
It became so bad, that Bucky and Sam had to set alarms for the amount of time Steve could spend on his electronic devices before he spiraled further into a sleep-deprived, news-hungry jitterbug.
Tony turned with his soft brown eyes gazing vulnerably back at Steve. He had a small, hopeful smile donning his face.
Steve brought the tiny genius into his lap, holding him close. He pecked a sweet kiss to Tony‚Äôs cheek.
A melancholy sigh left Steve's lips as few tears fell from sea-blue eyes, but the baby continued to smile, hoping to make the alpha happy.
He searched Tony's eyes. Tony saw something in Steve's eyes that he was too scared to linger onto. The air crackled, or maybe it could've just been Steve's imagination, but he couldn't elaborate on it, because all too soon, Tony pulled away and he walked to the trunk of his car.
Tony was running on ten cups of coffee within the span of six hours on his second day of pulling an all-nighter. He had J.A.R.V.I.S on mute ever since this afternoon after his fight with Nat when the AI suggested that he call James Rhodes or Dr. Banner down to the garage.
It was Tony's nano-tech arc reactor that he'd shoved into Steve's hands the day he'd touched back down to Earth.
Steve cradled his boyfriend gently against him, kneeling on the floor while the lightning sparked up the shadows.
A bristle of Steve's body at the mention of Doctor Stephen was not lost on Tony. The brunette internally rolled his eyes at that.
Right now, I just have exams coming up and before that, it was dealing with writer's block and working on my mental health, so I'm sorry it has taken so long, but please hang on and bear with me- I will complete and update this story, I promise!
As he dusted off, still keeping a weary eye on Nat, he looked up to see a very sleepy Tony! He was rubbing his eyes adorably like a tiny kid!
It took a few seconds for Tony to identify her and her familiar scent. But soon, his shivering stopped as Nat gently ran her fingers through his matted curls and let her hand rest on his cheek.
"Hey, no, hey, no, no Tony shh‚Ä¶ shh, shh," Steve cooed softly. He began rubbing Tony's arms gently, tapping the scientist's chin to look up into his eyes.
He let his voice travel to a whisper, smiling fondly at His Love before settling down so sleep could wash over him too.
But Steve leaned down to kiss him sweet and slow, cuddling his small genius close, so that they were nothing but an entanglement of limbs binding together. Tony lost himself in the kiss. Sweet, slow and romantic. Not building towards anything; just a small reminder of endearment- of love.
"Done," Steve answered, his face as stoic and serious as ever. It lit up something in Tony's heart to know he still cared so much.
‚ÄúOh, come here,‚Äù Steve hugged him tight, not caring for the oil rubbing off on his shirt or the slight wet spot on his shoulder, telling him of Tony‚Äôs tears.
The Norse God's thunderous voice echoed throughout Natasha's entrance hall, accompanied by the gigantic
Steve tossed the bouquet onto the side cabinet, letting his hands wave into a frenzy. "Still doesn't give me any excuse for my actions," he pressed.
‚ÄúShould he move back to the tower? Must anything be altered? What is he allowed to eat and drink? Has-?‚Äù
Smiling, he leaned in to give Tony a small hug-and-pat on the shoulder. As their bodies connected, however, he felt how Tony almost sunk into his grip- limp and exhausted.
‚ÄúPlease, Miss Potts, I need you to take a few deep breaths, alright?‚Äù Stephen breathed in and out with Pepper until hers evened out.
Steve's voice broke through Tony's reverie. He shook his head, side to side and looked around Steve's suite...
"Thank you, Daddy," he mumbled quietly, while Steve gently rocked them again in a slow rhythm, "I love you!"
He gently lifted the genius to his feet, noticing the pain shooting up Tony's body as he walked. Steve might not be a science genius like his boyfriend, but he wasn't stupid. Tony had told him of his father's drinking habits and he mused that this night must've been pretty bad.
Nat sighed in relief. She collapsed into a chair, rubbing her face tiredly. Wanda sat down next to her and cradled Natasha's hands in hers, bringing them up for a gentle kiss.
The pair suddenly crashed back down onto the mattress and Steve clutched a laughing Little Tony to his chest, snuggly, and blew a raspberry into his neck.
He had spent every day and every night drinking in the crisp, honey tone of that voice once he realized that he was in love with the owner of said voice.
In the second it took for Tony to peer into the box, it took another for him to almost faint to the floor!
"The funeral was a small affair... Only the team came, and Pepper, Rhodey and Happy. Stephen also made a brief appearance and‚Ä¶well, there didn't seem any reason for us to hate one another anymore‚Ä¶ There was one thing he came to talk to me about, though. He said that Tony‚Ä¶"
Steve stood quiet and thoughtful. No doubt about it that Natasha‚Äôs words carried truth in them, which is what scared the captain the most‚Ä¶
Catching up with Steve, they both climbed into the Merc, leaving the world of racing behind for the night.
"You know, ever since you'd gotten that haircut, you've become a real jerk like back in the 40s, you know that?" huffed the captain. He turned to face Bucky, his expression as stoic as ever. Bucky rolled his eyes, "No, I'm the friend telling you that after seven months of torturing yourself, it would be good for you to rightfully apologize to the man and get some closure, at the least, for both of you."
"Of course," he whispered softly, "Oh, of course, Tones. I'm here. I'm here now, it's okay. It'll be okay, don't worry‚Ä¶ C'mon."
He buried his face in Steve's neck, but mumbled one last thing before dozing off under the covers, cocooned by Steve's warmth.
Getting ready the next morning to go see Tony, Steve decided to make the omega some brownies. He just pulled them out of the oven, humming to himself, when the phone rang.
Tony‚Äôs breath hitched. Steve shrugged, still gazing at Tony with love in his eyes. Tony launched himself into Steve‚Äôs arms, snuggling close.
Tony outright laughed, heartily, "Relax, Steve! I'm just messing with you! Hahaha, I'm sorry, it's just a force of habit"
Crossing the workshop to the kit, Steve thought about how he could enter this situation. Tony had his pride and his stubbornness, so this wouldn‚Äôt be easy.
Tony's sniffles grew softer, but he didn't separate himself from Steve's chest any sooner. He needed to feel Steve's skin under him. Feel his uniform. Feel his
Tony found himself smiling at the nickname and his heart throbbed with the love he had for the man above him.
About fifteen minutes and thirty seconds later, Steve found himself on the floor! He was pinned up, right against the wall with Nat's leg kicked up and her knee jabbing harshly at his chest!
"Just like that, Honey. Yeah... just like that; let me hold you. Let me show you how much love you deserve, okay?" Steve whispered.
Steve rolled his eyes, even though Tony couldn‚Äôt see and slowly reached in and, one by one, he placed the five mice in the plastic box. He put a few sunflower seeds from his nibbled trail mix in there as well.
If there was one thing that was always constant with Steve, it would be the ratio between his stress level and his degree of acting. No-one could keep a cool like Natasha, so Steve, try as he might, had his cave-ins.
Steve squeezed his hand reassuringly, ‚ÄúI sometimes get scared of sleeping too. I get nightmares of this all being a dream or a hallucination and I‚Äôm stuck in the ice again as the cold washes over me. I hear Peggy‚Äôs voice, but I can‚Äôt answer‚Ä¶ So, I know it‚Äôs scary, but I‚Äôll stay with you.‚Äù
Tony clasped at Steve's shoulder blades and rocked his hips against the bulge in Steve's black jeans.
Stephen's eyes sharpened, piercing against the wall of pride the blonde tried to form around himself.
Steve-- trailing behind him like some sort of scared and lost little puppy or anything. No, Tony still had enough dignity in tact to not let his paranoia get the better of him!
Tony was a warm, solid bundle in his arms, fit perfectly against his chest. Like two puzzle pieces finally connecting. It felt so good to feel that. The mechanic's arms clutched fistfuls of Steve's shirt as if he was afraid the blonde might disappear too quickly.
"I'm gonna love you," Steve declared, never breaking his eyes away from the scientist's, "And you don't need to be scared, Tones. You're not gonna disappoint me. I don't care what anyone thinks, you're perfect to me."
"Seeing as how he came into the hospital, I suggest the space that you give him last a little longer, wouldn't you agree?"
And then it all came back into him. Like the shock you feel in every nerve once you plummet to the ground in a dream.
Closing his eyes, Tony shook his head, ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt say that to me if‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre going to use it against me, Steve. Or if you don‚Äôt really mean it. I just-‚Äù
The tension was thick enough to cause some visitors to scrunch up their noses and leave the passage, the scent of Alpha pheromones high and sour.
She gave Tony one last peck on the forehead and soon enough, quiet snores began to fill the living room. She rested Tony‚Äôs head in her lap and pulled a blanket over his sleeping form.
Natasha rolled her eyes as she imagined the aftermath of Tony apologizing consistently for being so much trouble. But the team understood. And anyway,
His eyes were closed and a dopey smile donned his face. She chuckled, wiping away his sweat-ridden curls.
it my life's work to cause you all anxiety," Tony protested, "You all signed up for it when you decided to be involved in a genius superhero's life."
She leaned against the wall, trying to seem calm and collected, staring down the corridor, but Steve could see her restlessness. She and hospitals didn‚Äôt exactly agree, especially with the whole ordeal of Fury faking his own death. And now her closest friend was in critical condition on top of it.
The brunette breathed out steadily, "The camera only shows Nick's back to her, but he turns around and goads her into a hug, smiling. In the end, Nick breaks that prejudice against foxes and becomes a cop alongside Judy... They become partners! ..."
He squeezed Tony in one last hug, before swiftly lifting the scientist into his arms in one lift! Tony squealed, clutching at Steve while the soldier chuckled, carrying the love of his life bridal style towards the compound.
‚ÄúI suppose you know now,‚Äù Steve whispered, his breath hitching with every tear-filled cry, ‚ÄúI suppose you know now how much I-‚Äú
The man shrugged, "I guess‚Ä¶ I mean - I- I don't really know. It's all kinda fuzzy, but I remember this feeling, like‚Ä¶"
So my first work on AO3 is complete. Kudos and positive feedback is always appreciated. It was really my first time writing every tag mentioned, so I hope I hooked you in on the atmosphere and tone of the story - I hope I conveyed that right, but expect more fics in the future (with, hopefully, a better writing technique! üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô)
The uncertainty remained there, but a strength lay underneath. A brave determination that always inspired Steve.
Steve ultimately decided to let the matter go, thinking that Tony was just recovering like the rest of the team.
Tony‚Äôs wide eyes met Bucky‚Äôs shocked expression. He froze beneath Steve. A millisecond passed in which a kaleidoscope of emotions passed between both of them.
"I forgive you!" Tony sobbed into the kiss, "I... I f-forgave you a while ago a-actually. But... but I j-just didn't th-think it would still hu-hurt so much!"
"I love you so much, too Daddy! I thought you- I thought you wouldn't--that I'd let you down- I didn‚Äôt-"
The coil inside his stomach snapped.His whole body went slack against Nat‚Äôs. He hummed gratefully as her seed soothed the deep ache within him.
‚ÄúI know you all are superheroes and you make it your life‚Äôs work to protect the city and more, but I will not have you making a scene and disturbing the patients and staff!‚Äù she hissed.
His tongue was adorably sticking out the side of his mouth and his brows were furrowed in concentration as he sketched the 'blueprints' for another invention that his toddler mind had thought up. Being little didn't stop Tony from being the genius that he was, even back when he was a toddler himself.
His breath came in hot puffs over Tony's face. Steve's lips were red and swollen and a light, pink blush spread over his face.
Dressed up in leather jeans and a jacket with studded rings and a choker necklace, she was absolutely
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to, Capsicle. I was just processing. I believe you. But you just have to realize that I‚Äôm going to disappoint you as a friend, or other.‚Äù
Tony, currently turned four years old - physically and mentally - was sitting quietly in the tower's living room, currently watching some cartoons and drawing at the same time.
Steve visibly had to shake his head to clear it. Instead, he just tried to focus on the sleek, black car driving closer.
When she pulled up that afternoon, Pepper gave a chaste kiss to Steve, squeezing his shoulders reassuringly. She hugged Nat tightly, thanking them for looking after Morgan while she attended to SI.
Because he knew amongst that teasing tone of his daddy, Steve was showing his pride for Tony-- saying how, despite everything, his baby was still such a strong and good man.
‚Äúyou look delicious babydoll. You enjoying that?‚Äù Steve asked, all inhibitions forgotten by the sounds the other made. Hand making its way down his pants.
‚ÄúNow, I believe you were told to make me come.‚Äù He had barely spoken the words before he was flat on his back, Steve‚Äôs bulk weighing them down.
‚ÄúGood morning friend steven!‚Äù Thor‚Äôs voice sounded, and Steve soon located Thor with his  arms around Bucky and Natasha.‚ÄúBucky and Natasha told me they‚Äôre considering dancing classes. As Natasha used to do ballet.‚Äù
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
‚ÄúHmmhmm.‚Äù Tony wriggled his butt and Steve couldn‚Äôt hold back on the little moan that escaped him. Then Tony started working, but from time to time he would clench his ass which made Steve‚Äôs cock throb with want.
Steve spent the next hours restlessly thumbing the pages of a book, thinking of Tony, and then his phone rang. It was a millisecond before Steve picked up.
‚ÄúListen, I can do damage control. Steve makes Tony happy, like truly happy. They‚Äôve been in a commited relationship for three months now. Surely, the press would be delighted to know Tony Stark has finally settled down, and even supports a minority‚ÄùPepper said, and Tony was so glad to have pepper on his side.
Steve was pulled into that universe where you‚Äôre half asleep and half awake, you can‚Äôt quite open your eyes, but you can hear things and hum occasionally. Sometimes you wake up, and sometimes you don‚Äôt
They had matching grins as they got ready for the day together, giggling as they stepped into the elevator and made the ride down to Tony‚Äôs office. Happy dropped off their Starbucks breakfast not much later, raising an eyebrow when he found Tony on Steve‚Äôs lap.
The alarm blared and shook Tony from his, frankly delightful, sleep. His mood turned even more sour when he realised what the alarm was for. The packed bag of Steve‚Äôs belongings being an extra reminder, it got a stink eye from Tony, just for that.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so beautiful Tony, you have no idea what I want to do to you.‚Äù He whispered in Tony‚Äôs ear, biting lightly on the man‚Äôs earlobe. A full body shudder ran through Tony‚Äôs frame.
Soon, he was fingerfucking Tony with three fingers. The Brunet's voice was hoarse from screaming his pleasure, but still whining when Steve pulled his hand back.
‚ÄúSteve!‚Äù he smiled brightly, jumping into his boyfriend‚Äôs arms as soon as he had dismounted the bike.
He smiled when he heard the telltale ping of a text message coming from the living room while he was cooking. He took the finished plate of broccoli puree and sausages to the dining area and grabbed his phone.
‚ÄúI get to take you on a date first?‚Äù Tony asked. ‚Äúwe can do the talking stuff while having good food and then get to the extra good stuff?‚Äù
‚Äúyou‚Äôre just saying that because I promised to ride your dick.‚Äù Tony joked, and then kissed Steve.‚Äùjust kidding, I know you think I‚Äôm beautiful.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you couldn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Steve smiled, softly caressing Tony‚Äôs hand, making the other relax. Steve let Tony feed him bits of waffle and they talked about their friends and family. Steve learned that Rhodey was colonel James Rhodes, who had known Tony since his MIT days. Then Tony listened to Steve describing Natasha and promptly decided that she needed to get drunk with him and have a girls night. Before they knew it they had eaten all the ice cream and it was already late afternoon.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing the best we can to track him down. If you have any information whatsoever, you have to let me know now, Steve.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Steve said, positively beaming. A customer entered and Sam went to tend to his needs, giving Steve the opportunity to slip back to the atelier. Today he had a session with Thor, one of their fixed models. He often modelled for Bruce, who was a quiet painter who painted nudes and landscapes.
‚ÄúOh and make sure the footage of earlier this morning and what we're about to do now are not able to access except by me.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh Tony, you‚Äôre so sweet.‚Äù Steve sighed and kissed and hugged Tony again.‚Äùbut you know I need to go back to work...‚Äù
He hurried towards the elevator when he saw Steve‚Äôs bike turning the corner of the street, ready to meet him down in the underground garage.
‚Äòhmm hello sugar, got more treats for me?‚Äô the text below said, Steve bit his lip and decided to just go ahead with it. He pulled his pants a bit lower so you could see the head of his dick peeping from his boxers and took a picture, which he sent.
He heard Tony talking, so it was probably the phone of the genius that had pulled him from sleep. He blearily opened his eyes when Tony sighed.
‚ÄúAuwtch.‚Äù Bucky flinched. ‚Äústill, he was into it and he had a great body. Why you ignoring him, Stevie?‚Äù
‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs okay, you have to go and sort this out. I understand that. I shouldn‚Äôt have kissed you without checking if it was safe.‚ÄùSteve said regretfully.
It wasn‚Äôt a long drive, and they stopped in front of a very cute restaurant that looked like it was very expensive.
Steve tightened his grip a bit and Loki moaned like a real slut, before going limp and just taking the pounding Steve was still giving him. His eyes rolling up in his head. Tony grinned and gave in to the lustful haze as well, kissing down Steve‚Äôs back while fucking up in that tight heat.
‚ÄúYessss.‚Äù Tony hissed, his flushed cheeks becoming even redder and his moans growing louder. Then he opened those Bambi eyes again and Steve was so gone for him. He studied Tony‚Äôs face, intent on drawing him later to remember this moment by.
