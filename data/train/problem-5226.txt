It’d started well. Really, it had. That was until chatter simmered down, PowerPoint slides were clicked through, and things actually began to take shape within the momentum created. Castiel found out the hard way that the faces behind globally known companies didn’t turn out to be ones worthy of admiration, but rather exactly true to their name given: ‘faces’.
“Y-yes?”
Outside his previous house are two cop cars, there’s one officer at the door while another one walks towards him as soon as he turns the engine off. “Castiel Novak?” he’s asked immediately.
It dawns on Castiel soon enough that these are powerful and dangerous men, and each one of them is protected by a personal body guard, guns visible in an unspoken display of threatening foreboding.  “Where’s Mr. Winchester?” he grits out eventually.
“Please- please leave me alone!”
“Don’t!” Dean snaps. It’s already too late when Castiel realizes it was directed at Teddy running up to the small puddle and not at him, but what difference does it make? He’s scared out of his mind for the punishment sure to come. A nearly one hundred pound dog having another go at pushing him into the corner isn’t exactly helping and Cas just loses it.
Oh, shit’s about to go down and surprisingly, Dean is ready for it. In his opinion, he did nothing wrong. Ketch shouldn’t have disrespecting him by damaging the part of their deal that was Castiel and that’s final. Mr. Winchester believed and still believes himself to be king of the castle. They want a war? Fine, they’ll get one.

Of course she wouldn’t be able to reach him, the first and only time he’d called her was today, on a payphone no less, and then he hung up on her after basically avoiding her questions about the people he was potentially involved with.

. Castiel finds it to be both a blessing and a curse because it does facilitate coming back to work, they can just slip right into the previous flow and pick up where they'd left off, but on the other hand it does sting.
“For fuck’s sake! I need you to get over it! Don’t you get it?”
Cas is quick to divert the situation though, briefly explaining about his empty house, the shock of having police show up, etcetera. He even smiles at Dean when the latter gently takes his hand in emphasis of the play-pretend.
“But how?”
“He wanted you to get better!” Gabriel snaps back at him, suddenly glad they decided to meet up somewhere quiet and not in a full restaurant like last time. “We
“Gabriel! Hey, I-“
Cas stays quiet after that, he knows he’s constantly walking on thin ice and that the moment he manages to mess up whatever fucked up agreement they’ve got going, the CEO will not hesitate to terminate it, throw him out to the wolves. And Castiel will already be reeking of blood in that case.
As owner of Winchester International Co., one of the most successful and rapidly growing companies reaching far beyond the terrains of America already, the young millionaire was becoming a known player in the field, right along the top dogs and best of the best, much to his own delight.

He doesn’t remember being led into yet another different room, each door they pass making the music fade and the world quieter until there’s nothing but the sound of ragged breaths against his heaving chest.

of alcohol since Friday night. He got dressed and went to class, chugging coffee like water until the fuzz cleared from his brain.
“You ask me a question,” Sam explained. “And I have to answer it truthfully.”
"Jesus Christ, Sammy," Dean gasped, thudding his head against the doorframe. "Way to give a hello."
“Shit,” he blurted, “what did I do last night?”

The elevator dinged cheerfully. Castiel entered the elevator, and then, after a moment’s hesitation, pressed on the button for the second floor.
From the backseat: “Truth or Dare?”
Dean sighed. “I dunno. I guess I’ve just been confused.”
Castiel stepped in close enough to cup Dean’s face, and gently nudged his chin. Their lips met softly, cautiously—just a taste before Castiel was drawing away.
“What’s your name?” Castiel said, instead of answering to any of it.
my favourite food, like seriously
“I’m going to sleep for a week,” Castiel murmurs, sighs, curled up in the passenger side.
“Nothing to see here,” Dean warned, with a familiar thread of protectiveness, and they dispersed.
“And always remember to use protection.”
"So, what," Dean mumbled, "You're still, ah. In love? With—" He paused, searching for a proper word. "Wolfsbane guy?"
It took him longer to fall back into conversation this time. Dean waited, waited, waited.
"It's okay," Sam said. "Really. I get it, Dean, it's okay."
“Okay,” Castiel said, slowly lowering his defences and seeing Dean relax as he saw it. “Fine. What did he say?”
Dean laughed—breathy with disbelief. “Yeah, okay,” he said. “But I’m gonna buy it, anyway. I’ll wait here for you while you get your stuff, and then we can head to the studio together?”
Castiel’s gaze turned into a bit of a glare. “Is there something wrong with that?”
Judging by her wry smile, he didn't conceal it very well. “Oh, you know, the usual. Offer free food—free
Hesitation flooded him suddenly. He settled back down. Let a noise escape him, a little like frustration and a lot like despair.
“Good,” came the response. “Let’s just say Dean isn’t supposed to be friends with me.”
And it was so goddamn
“Hey,” Dean said, voice heading closer. “You okay?”
On a normal day, he’d be able to go a hundred miles without a single word, perfectly happy to jam along to the familiar crackle of his cassette tapes and the purr of the Impala, the barely-there breathing from the passenger seat and the soft snores of the occasional once-angel in the backseat. But there was something about today that made him antsy—made him tap his feet impatiently along the gas pedal through a roadblock and grimace at the too-bright sunlight streaming through the window. Made him flinch just barely, nearly imperceptibly, at every shift and rustle of thick trenchcoat from behind.
Dean looked at him. Didn’t calm down, though; didn’t think he ever would ever again.
Hannah had long brown hair and curvy lines for eyes, and she just adored the boy next door. So much so, in fact, that she felt her tummy begin to rumble and a cough blossom in her throat, and up it goes, out it goes, a tiny little rose, coughed up in the palm of her hand. And the boy next door didn’t adore her back, so the flowers started growing, more and more, until little Hannah had just too many to bear. So Hannah went to the doctor, and the doctor said,
Too late; they’re already out the door. The air is freezing and both of them gasp a little as it pummels them in shock.
“Well,” the man said,
Now you're. You're." Dean frowned, losing his train of thought. He tried again. "I didn't know it was me. When I realized it was me, I was so surprised. So shocked. But now, looking back, it was so obvious."
“Why not a kick buggy?” Cas ranted. “A tackle buggy?”
Castiel stepped into their room, steps unfaltering. He stopped at where he always stopped to hang up his coat. He did a quick, casual scan of the room, and dismissed it just as quickly.
absolutely,” Dean breathed, and Cas was right there again, not an inch of space between them and it was just the way Dean liked it, just what he needed, Cas kissing him hard and Dean kissing him back, feeling giddy and high and drunk on sunshine for the rest of the day.
Peter from senior year had asked her to prom with a bouquet of lilies. John Winchester had ridden up to her house in a motorcycle and an open seat, and Mary made her choice within seconds.
Then Castiel felt the bed shift as Dean rolled over. Heard the faint creak of the mattress as Dean shuffled closer. Felt an arm come up around him and gently, tenderly, pull him in. Dean’s hand was resting on Castiel’s stomach, uncovered save for a threadbare t-shirt, fingers lightly curled.
Dean sighs. Lets it settle into his bones and trickle through his veins and sink into his skin, like a tattoo or a scar. “Yeah,” he says, and he suddenly feels like he’s teetering on a knife’s edge to crying, which is just—ridiculous.
The guest answered, but Dean didn’t hear them. He couldn’t hear anything, actually, over the sudden pounding in his ears.
"Of course, I know that, I know you can," and Dean sounded like he was pleading all of a sudden, "but you'll tell me if something is really wrong, right? Cas?"
His mother said, “Darling,” and bent down to kiss him on the forehead. “Maybe she doesn’t, but it’s still a beautiful flower, don’t you think?”

’ his mind yells at him. He can’t.
“What else you gonna do with it? Please don’t try to pawn it in some scrawny shop. It was my father’s.” No matter how hard Castiel tries to find sadness in those words, he doesn’t find any, nothing but nonchalance and emptiness when spoken about the late John Winchester.
“Why is he interested all of a sudden?”
She shrugs and partially dismisses his comment as she goes right back to folding the clean laundry. “He’s just, how you say? Estúpido.”
Or maybe it had been, in a different sense of the word, because he can almost feel Mr. Winchester’s lips on his when he’s abruptly pushed away and their bodies go back to being separated. This wasn’t a light switch being flicked, this was lightning striking at full speed.
was the one that called the cops.
Playlist so far:
“Calm down, jeez. I get it, you’re a drug addict.” Castiel wants the words to sting, his secret should have stayed hidden and the name calling should hurt, but strangely enough, Mr. Winchester’s words are somewhat comforting. The man believed him, reassured him, and it makes Cas’s hyperventilating settle just the tiniest bit in relief.
Of all the things he could have said ‘because you’re an addict, that’s why!’ was probably not the best one. But as most bad choices in life, they’ve already been made by the time we change our minds. Dean can’t take back what leaves the man before him quiet in defeat, he can only throw in a feeble attempt at getting it all to make sense to Castiel. Why doesn’t Cas just see it?
If only Mr. Winchester would be there, he could protect Castiel from harm, or so Cas wishes to believe. He knows it’s messed up to think that but it’s all the comfort he can cling to as his body shivers from the cold and the pain still rippling through his chest. “He’s here” someone announces upon entering the room. When Castiel turns around to see, he recognizes Mr. Lafitte immediately and soon enough, Mr. Winchester follows behind.
He stumbles, entirely on purpose, and runs straight into a certain green eyed CEO. “Oh, no, oh, I’m so,

walks in.
Now, Teddy might not have even noticed him, too wrapped up in escaping whatever duties a dog could possibly have, but the lady Cas had currently only been introduced to via voice does. She stops dead in her tracks at the bottom of the stairs where Castiel is still glued into place.
Cas can barely hear a thing over the club’s obnoxiously loud music. It’s perfect. Though he does wonder why the guy he face fucked in the bathroom only minutes ago (Darrick? Darion?
That was what made Castiel pick up his phone and dial the numbers.

And, just like that, once he started noticing, he couldn't stop.
obviously meant Dean had to keep talking. “Remember the last time we played Truth or Dare? That was fun.”
“Hmm,” Cas said. “I think I like tackle buggy a lot better.”
Dean tried to speak, made a faint creaky noise; tried again.
“You want a plate?” she said. “A fork, maybe?”
“So I take that as a yes, then?” he coaxed.
Ignoring him, Castiel stomped over to the table, grabbed the pie tin, and then shoved it towards Dean. “Have it, then. I hope it tastes

well—Cas would never tell where his lunchbox ended up.
okay, scratch that, the wedding planner had suggested it and Dean had to remind himself that they’d paid her good money that didn’t include a hospital bill—not to mention all the standing and talking and the stupid tradition that said they couldn’t see each other the night before, which was just plain mean, and all the dances he’d doled out for the guests to cheesy 80s love ballads until the balls of his feet ached when, really, all he really wanted to do was to dance with Cas.
“So why did Bobby,” Dean started in a feathery whisper, but Castiel shook his head and shook Dean, again, and Dean fell silent and let him speak.
Unpaired soulmates were rare, but not impossible. One with colour and the other without. It wasn’t like Castiel had a visible reaction the instant their eyes met—and with Dean’s luck, it wasn’t a far fetch.
been listening for the past three days.”
When Dean offered to edit the essay for him, or act as a rubber duck to bounce ideas off of, Castiel (who had accepted the offer multiple times before, and accepting them with the solid knowledge that it would quickly diffuse into a volley of bantering and quick flashes of conversation, accompanied with laughs and nudges and bright, shocking eyes) shrugged and said, "I've got it, but thank you," and ignored the queer look Dean directed at him for the minutes after. Grammarly was a much less entertaining beta.
“I can make cereal,” Sam said, chin jutting out.
Castiel hummed. “Some. I didn’t make a big deal out of it.”
“Okay,” Dean whispered. Steeled himself for a moment. “Here we go.”
When he woke up in the morning, Castiel was gone, and so were the surgery papers.
"In your dreams, lover boy," Castiel would respond, and Dean would elbow him in the side in that exact spot that made him flail and fall over, and the banter would form and fall like summer rain, easy as that.
"Sorry," Dean said. "I know. Reciprocate it, get over it, or surgery."
but the words collided in his throat and what came out was nothing but air.
“That had been,” Castiel admitted. “Until now.”
Oh, so they were actually playing now. Great. “Uh…”
“Music,” Cas eventually answered. “It’s beautiful how a combination of various vibration frequencies can induce such strong emotion in people. Throughout the eons, humans have used music to express their feelings, from simple enjoyment to therapy and catharsis.”
"Don't be stupid," Dean said, and was it the scent of Cas's shirt or the last shot of tequila that just hit? "You're him. You're Cas."
Dean rolled his eyes. "Yeah, dumbass, of course I checked my closet. It was the first place I looked."
“Thanks,” Dean gasped, and chugged it down like it was his life force. It tasted like heaven, cold and wonderful, down his throat.
When he opens his front door to retrieve the ever growing pile of newspapers, letters and leaflets, he nearly stumbles over the cardboard box discarded on the steps.
to make it all go away and he succeeded, or so he thought.
“Shh,” Dean shushes instantly and tries to soothe the man in his arms by pressing soft kisses to the sweaty dark hair while quickly making his way to the set of waiting cars. “It’s okay, you’re going to be okay” he whispers over and over, and Cas believes him. “Let’s go, Benny. He's burning up.”
* Chapter 24 : Way down we go - Kaleo
Goodbye, sir.”
But he seems to be the only one.
It’s far beyond an acceptable time to be outside and asking lone pedestrians for directions without being clocked as a paedophile, but does he have a choice? Castiel hasn’t the slightest idea of where he’d been driven to earlier that night, doesn’t know if they’re even in the same state anymore. Rubbing his trembling hands over tired eyes, he makes his way to the exit, surprised to see not even the tailor nor the owner are in sight any more but he knows better than to touch anything, even in the dark does he know those price tags easily surpass six digits.
"You must lick honey from a thorn, if you are to survive this night."
“No, sweetheart, no. You don’t have anything to be sorry about, okay?”
to tell me.”
Castiel’s heart is erratic as he waits for an answer and it’s not the fever. His brother obviously complete ignores him.
Mr. Winchester is quiet, which is highly unusual for the man. There always seem to be orders, remarks or comments but not tonight. Every time Castiel dares glancing over, he’s met with a face turned away from him, the always straight shoulders now slumping a bit as if they’re succumbing to defeat.
* Chapter 09 : Miracle - The Score
“Cas, please! Fucking wake up!”
“Okay, if you’re sure. Don’t forget to text me the address!”
He wants out, wants to get away from there as quickly as possible. Luckily for him, the way Mr. Winchester is still standing up and showing no intention of having a seat at their table makes it clear for everyone that he’s there to take Castiel home with him.
“I can’t- I can’t afford this.” He’d already whispered multiple times as the tailor measured every inch of his frigid body, not paying attention to him in any way. All of it feels so unnecessary and out of place. The way gloved fingers trail along three piece Fioravanti suits, how Jean Patou’s ‘Joy’ hangs in the air pleasantly, even the pencils are designer and it makes Castiel feel like his own skin isn’t worth enough to be touching anything in the private room of this haute couture house.
“No,” Castiel says a bit softer, “that’s not what I meant. Just… don’t overdo it, okay? For your own best will. Otherwise I’ll have to start worrying about you worrying too much. Does that make sense?”
He doesn’t even flinch when Dean unbounds him.

Trying to explain that he knows the way up to the office is futile, these two body builders seem brainwashed into escorting him up to the fourteenth floor and personally delivering him to the CEO like a wrapped present, bow and all.
“And?” Oh, for fuck’s sake. He turns his head away in annoyance for a second before snapping his eyes back up to meet those resting amidst a thousand freckles. “And what?” The response comes out a little more agitated than he’d expected, apparently it was harder to contain your frustrations when there’s a power hungry shmuck trying to beat you into submission with nothing but a smooth tongue and a gaze that makes you squirm.
“No.” Is all he gets for an answer, Mr. Winchester still indulged in his dining and not even granting Castiel eye contact like he’d done for the past forty-five minutes. It was unnerving and dehumanizing to be treated like a dog.
“No.”

The faces around him are downright unrecognizable with how blurry his vision is becoming, his knuckles turning white where he’s gripping the doorframe as if it’s a lifeline. That damned doorframe. All it does is remind him of the fact they’re not even letting him go out of his room.
I don’t need to tell you what will happen if you don’t show up, do I?”
"Je ne sortirai pas des lignes tracées par les corbeaux blancs."

* Chapter 07 : What he wrote - L. Marling
That comment seems to hit Mr. Winchester somewhere deep inside. It’s not hurt, Castiel is still convinced this man is utterly incapable of actual emotions, so that’s impossible, but it does make something falter in the previously well kept together green eyes. It’s as if a realization set in, as if Dean only now noticed a detail he shouldn’t have overlooked in the first place.
“Only one time. When he a young boy, I hit him. La chancla, you know?”

Castiel doesn’t realize he’s made a mistake, doesn’t have any reason to believe he did something wrong, until he sees it flicker across darkening eyes; threatening clouds of an impending, restless storm trekking fast. It gallops upon the greens, approaching just as quickly and thundering ahead of time to make sure he’s frightened before it even hits.
* Chapter 02 : Broken bones - Kaleo
“Hmm.” Dean nearly growls, leaning forward on his desk as he takes a long, hard look at Castiel, only talking again when the latter visibly falters under the pressure. “And here I was, thinking I’m paying you with my kindness and generosity, even after you caused me a great deal of hurt. Am I wrong, Mr. Novak?”
But the attention shifting towards her seemingly causes a ripple in the aforementioned peaceful atmosphere. She stands up, turns away from Castiel’s gaze and gives him nothing but a barely audible mumble that doesn’t even resemble an actual answer.
* Chapter 08 : Mercy - S.Mendes (acoust.)
“Fuck, yes.” Ketch breathes out as he pushes further and further. “No wonder that American prick kept you as a play thing.” What is it with these men and relishing in another person’s suffering? Castiel had questioned if it was just Mr. Winchester who carried such cruel urges but as he lay there, being pounded between sobs and cries, hard thrusts slamming into him without stopping, the last of his hope for the world to carry goodness leaks out of him like the liquids trickling down his thighs.
With nothing else to do besides enjoying his little victory, Castiel heads back home. If Mr. Winchester truly was so desperate to have his ‘servant’ by his side, he should have let Cas into the building that morning and not have his security block the door with two hundred pounds of ego. His loss.
“Stupid?”
And fails.
“Alright, love, I believe you. But you have to understand what it looked like.”
“No.”
“No, really. How are you feeling, Cas?”
!” Castiel spits. “Yeah, and Mr. Winchester with all his money and his ‘I will make you disappear if you don’t listen to me’ fuckery. Real scary. Why doesn’t he just kill me then, huh? Huh?!”
in the weeks that followed.
The hard smack against his cheek stings long after it’s been delivered, easing only when a pain greater than the blow takes its place under the form of a hand roughly grabbing his hair and trying to pull him closer between open legs. “Please, no- sir.”
but he considers it. He considers telling her everything down to the last gruesome detail through the sobs and the tears and the humiliation, even if he has to beg for it, even if it would mean life long under witness protection, he doesn’t care, Castiel just wants to go
He hangs up without a second thought. Having been ordered around, forced to suffer financially and brought to tears had been bad enough during daytime, and even though he knew it was undoubtedly up for repetition today, it would have to wait till the sun had actually risen for it to get a grip on him. The digital numbers indicating five-thirty in the morning said enough; Mr. Winchester could kiss his ass.

The door locking behind him has him desperate for air instantly.
“Oh!” Dean said.
"I love you, darling."
"No."
“Uh,” the man said. “About that.”
Cas gritted out.
“Castiel! Wait!”
“It was my mother’s idea,” Castiel said. “She had daisies for my father until he loved her back.”
“Oh,” Dean said. “Me too. I mean—” He flushed, finally tore his eyes away from the canvas to look at Castiel. “Your eyes. They’re my colour, too. Blue.”
“Yeah,” Dean said, suddenly fuelled with surety. “But this time, I’ll throw it up on the
Dean rubbed at the slow steady throb of his arm and glared, weakly.
His parents helped him carry all his luggage from the back of the car into the dorm. Or, that was their excuse, seeing as Castiel only had two suitcases, both of which he could very easily carry on his own. His sister, Anna, slouched in the backseat texting her friends with the Wifi from the building. (Anna, as far as Castiel knew, didn't have any flowers at all.)
He saw Cas at the end of Chestnut Drive, halfway to where they split for their separate ways home. Perfect.
“Right,” Dean muttered. “About that—listen, Bobby, I’m sure you know, but I don’t know if you know
Dean chewed on his lip and tried to think of the best way to respond to his little brother in a way that wasn’t, Maybe he doesn’t know that. Maybe he’s just a sad, sick person who misses his wife so hard he can’t think. Maybe Heaven isn’t real.
“No punchbacks means free for all,” Dean, who had been trained in this for over sixteen years, informed Cas, before punching him again.
“It’s alright,” the man said, and took the coat back with a grateful smile. It turned into a look of concern when he saw Dean in his t-shirt. “Did you not wear a jacket today?”
You could go eat out a fireplace and get a better experience.”
Dean’s face was desolate. “What do I do?”
Castiel sighed. "Yes," he said simply.
Pie tins littered the tables, empty and crumb-spackled, upturned on the tablecloth and all over the floor. Stray napkins spread themselves all around the aftermath. At the end, there was a girl—blonde hair tied back in a loose, fraying bun.
At the gates, Castiel was met by four of these guards, who greeted him with something that wasn’t quite hostility, nor was it politeness either.
"Aww, you’re too sweet to me," Dean cooed, still with that grin, still with that sparkle in his eye. "After all, who wouldn't love a face like this?"
“Ow,” Cas said pointedly. Not even sounding surprised.
Dean evaded the question with a sugary smile. “Anyway, you were saying?”
Dean pursed his lips. Watched Castiel for a while, and then suppressed a long-suffering sigh before stepping closer.
“Of course you’d meet your soulmate in freakin’
“Hm,” Castiel said. “Well—fine. Either way, I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
“I did—but your father loved me back. He loved me back, and the daisies stopped growing.”
Once Cas was settled next to Dean, he was looking around with a fluttery excitement, kicking his feet once against the front of the car before settling down. “I like this game,” he declared.
Dean inquired about the presentation Cas had today and Cas struck up a conversation about meiosis and mitosis and whatnot, and Dean easily let himself be lulled into a gentle haze by the cadence of his voice, low and melodic and soothing. All the while, his mind was ticking away as he kept his eyes steady and fixed on the intersection in front of them. Any moment now.
“Back with me?”
Dean chewed on his lip. “A lotta reasons,” he finally said. “Dad might be sleeping. You don’t want to wake him up, right?”
good friends with you. I should introduce you two someday.”
"Me?"
“Right,” he breathed, his heart suddenly pounding inside his chest, echoing in his eardrums. It was impossible, he yelled at himself, shoving it down. He was there when they did it, peering through the windows after sneaking past the nurses. He saw the tubes going down Castiel’s arms, his chest, his fucking throat.
“Is Dean not there?” he asked, and the man looked away. His fingers twisting in front of him, his weight shifting back and forth between his two feet.
Cas detached himself from the dash. “But I’m not done.”
And then the anniversary of Mom's death came and everything went to shit.
Dean helped Castiel up from the floor. Castiel’s knees were still shaky, but Dean wrapped an arm around him and steadied him. Castiel refused to look at the destruction he left behind in the toilet; knew that the petals were so dark they were black, knew that they were slick with blood.
With the help of the girl at the cashier, Dean picked out a hefty-looking Stephen King novel, because Sam grew up covering his eyes at every scene in a horror movie and it was henceforth his duty as a big brother.
Castiel twists around to grab another pretzel from the table. He pops it into his mouth before taking Dean’s hand and letting himself get dragged all the way across the room, the few remaining bedraggled guests easily parting in their wake.
Dean was breathing hard. His vision was a little blurry; he shook his head to clear it before facing Castiel dead-on and meeting his eyes, bright blue bewilderment.
“Good,” Dean said fiercely, and then a thought popped into his head, one that made him go all sharp and achy inside. “Is that why you were crying? Did Chad do something to you again?” Maybe it was
“Dean,” Dean told him.
“Oh,” Cas said. “I remember you, now.”
Sam said. Dean shot him a look through the rearview mirror.
“Dare,” Cas said.
Dean froze, hurt pouring off of him like heat waves. Castiel could feel it gnawing away at him, like starving rats at a pile of flesh, and he cringed and sighed.
“Of course,” Dean said, frowning a little. “That’s my job.”
of camaraderie). A look at the window revealed that it was already starting to get dark, too; the start of before-supper sunsets and the promise of (oh, joy) even colder temperatures.
“You never fell in love since then?” Castiel said, sounding skeptical.
"All I could see was how much you were hurting, and it hurt me so much to see that, it was so fucking bad, Cas. But then—but then—but
don’t,” Prince Dean Winchester said, walking closer with every step backwards Castiel took. His arms were outstretched like a peace offering.
Castiel squared his shoulders to calm his just-jittered nerves, and opened the door to the carriage.
But Cas was still crying, his head bent down so that Dean couldn’t see his face, couldn’t see his bright blue eyes, and Dean had never heard him cry before; he was usually always so quiet and the only time he ever raised his voice was to tell Chad to give him back his eraser because he needed it for the spelling test.
Castiel waited, saying nothing.
Mom would roll her eyes and bat his hands away from her hair and tell him to stop it, will he? And Dad would laugh and pick her up and spin her around in the kitchen while they made dinner together and Dean would jump on the couch until they told him to stop.
“Dad,” Dean tried again.
“Hey,” Dean says softly back. He tugs on Castiel’s hand, just a little, until he gets the message and scoots across the seat to rest his head on Dean’s shoulder instead. “If you fall asleep on me, I’m carrying you over the banister.”
“Dare,” Dean said, because he
“I can’t just turn it off.” Not after sixteen years of craned necks and squinty eyes zeroing in on the nearest pudgy-looking car, the split-second twist of a torso packing the hardest punch one could muster across the passenger seat. Their dad called it reflex training. Sam and Dean called it war. Dean’s arm still twitched every time he caught a glimpse of those round headlights.
“It’s okay,” Cas said. “It doesn’t hurt more when you touch it. Just… all the time.”
“Hi,” he said back dumbly, feeling a ridiculously-wide smile stretch across his face at the sound of his name on Castiel’s tongue. “How are you feeling?”
“Of course,” Sam said. “Well, truthfully, I was pretty awed. I didn’t
“What?” Cas said again.
He put the sticky note into the pocket of the trenchcoat, meanwhile giving them a quick search, and found nothing but a single loose receipt for a large coffee at the local cafe with a blueberry scone. No name, no number.
Dean stiffened. “That’s different.”
“Isn’t that a coincidence?” Castiel murmured. “But you didn’t come talk to me. In fact, you ran—out of the building.”
Dean cleared his throat; got tired of looking at the mirror and turned around to face Castiel fully.
"For now? Get over it," Singer said curtly. "I'll give it to you straight: right now, you've got two ways to go. You can get over it, and the flowers will get rid of themselves. Alternatively, you can get surgery—which I wouldn't suggest, considering the potential complications."
it was again, that rumble, that sputtering engine like the heavens singing down.
"Out," Dean said, and shut the door in Castiel's face before he could hear the response.
It was Castiel smiling patiently and ignoring Dean when he sang way too loudly in the shower. It was Castiel quietly replacing all the empty toilet paper rolls instead of chucking them at Dean's head from the back. It was Dean looking over to Castiel from across the couch, and instead of looking back, Castiel was nose-deep in a book.
John didn’t say anything for so long Dean began to feel cold sweat prickling at his neck.
“But what if there’s another?” Dean nearly didn’t recognize his own voice, furiously tamping down that soft glowing hope, that
that and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but—if you really don’t want to go, just tell me honestly. I’ll figure something out, maybe go half and half or something, I’m sure Lisa wouldn’t mind—”
“Uh,” he said, and was shocked at how scratchy his voice sounded, how kitten-weak. “Hey.” Lamely.
"Ohhh," Dean said, pressing a hand to his chest. "Classy. I like it." He sprung up from the sofa and sauntered towards Castiel, who had just finished hanging up his coat. "But, seriously. How was it?"
“Hello, Dean.”
he said, like a four-letter word.
He lost track of time. He wasn’t sure how long it had been, but he realized after a while that the crying had stopped. Cas’s shoulders were no longer shaking, just trembling as he creeped back into calmness.
“Then don’t,” Sam said pleasantly. “There’s enough space up here for three people. I’ll just scooch over.” He smiled, and Dean thought, Fuck.
It was—
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, “But I think that’s
"Have fun," he said instead, and didn't wait up. (He woke up an hour later to vomit into the toilet, but Castiel wasn't home yet, and even if he was, it wouldn't make a difference. Might've made it worse.)
Cas processed that. “Isn’t that redundant to be put into a game? I thought that was the typical response to a question.”
“It’s soft,” Sam said. “And, um, bright. Kind of warm.”
“Dare,” Dean called out.
“Careful,” the man said. A pair of hands came up to meet Castiel’s, cupping the baby bird and gently taking it from his palms. Castiel felt the man shift behind him, standing up higher until his hands were above Castiel’s and by the bundle of twigs.
so blue it was nearly black, the night slowly leeching out the colour, and in a few minutes it would be nothing but darkness but for now it was blue.
“Hey,” Dean said one night. “Whatcha’ reading there?”
and I just. I guess I just really,
jealous you can’t see red,” Dean shot back.
“It’s not,” Dean whispered, and watched Castiel flinch.
Sam’s forehead scrunched up. “Why?”
“Nothing,” the nurse said. The tag on her chest marked her as a volunteer; pre-med, maybe. “His vitals were all excellent. There were no signs of concern or resurgence.”
“I thought you said you didn’t want to dance again for the rest of your life.”
Dean nodded fervently. Tried to lower his eyes in the demure, puppy-innocent way Sam seemed to have mastered that could send any adult looping around his little finger; the one Cas had picked up recently, too. Dean seemed to be the only one who couldn’t get the hang of it, and it didn’t work now, either.
“Alright,” Sam said. “I dare you to… let Cas drive the Impala for five minutes.”
He remembered when he used to think the scent was nice. It smelled like kerosene, now, and burned just as much.
“I’m usually much smoother than this, I promise,” Dean said.
When he tried to step back, Dean stepped forward. And then again. And then he echoed that sound, and his hands were on Castiel’s face, in his hair, pulling him in fast enough that Castiel stumbled, nearly slipped if not for the arm that wound itself around his waist, crushing him into Dean’s chest, crashing their lips together, slippery with the rain.
“Pie,” the man corrected. “And it was second-highest.”
“Come on, you don’t have to be all uptight like that. You excited?”
“I’m fine,” Castiel said.
“I’m Dean,” he said. “I’m in your class. I sit behind you.”
Beth nodded, eyes still teary from her outburst. "My mother told me that you only get surgery if there's nothing else left. If that's the only way out. Usually, the love will go away on its own—like us, Castiel. Imagine if I had gotten the surgery! I would've been so different. Maybe we wouldn’t even be friends now."
“Mm. Goodnight, Dean.” Castiel leaves a lazy, smacking kiss on Dean’s shoulder before his lips go slack with sleep.
So if there was a free coat in the middle of the library, hell yeah it was a free coat in the middle of the library. Dean strolled out of the library whistling.
When Castiel finally caught up, the man was standing in front of what appeared to be a crowd of untrimmed bushes, wild and overgrown. They were in the backs of the castle, the dark and unmaintained corners.
Dean chuckled, and then laughed, and then said, “Wait—hold on, you can stop now.”
“I was exhausted just looking at you two,” Castiel agrees.
“It’s fine, dude,” she said. “I get it. It’s pie. If I hadn’t had, like, five pieces already, I’d probably be demanding it right about now too.”
“Out of
“Relax, will you?” she murmured, smirking a little. “You’re all coiled-up like a wind-up toy.”
His eyes, drifting lazily, caught on something next to the panel. A poster.
A pause. Timidly, terrified, Dean looked over his shoulder at Castiel—to find him smiling.
“I’ll give you twenty for it,” he muttered.
He sounded incredulous, lined with disbelief. “You didn’t.”
“I hope you realize that starting an affair with the Prince is
(And then plane tickets and phone calls and facetimes, late nights, sore eyes, headaches, inside jokes and new people and new worries, never this difficult, never this much, all whispered through a speaker in the dark. Diplomas and mortgages. Chapels.)
“Throw it out,” Dean said. “Hell, burn it. I’m sorry I brought this up, I know it’s not something you want to remember. That anyone would want to remember.”
"It's too late," Cas said. "It already happened, Dean. I already got the surgery, there's nothing to do now."
it sounded with finality.
“The flowers were for you,” he said, and the words hung in the air like an anvil before crashing down on them both.
"Christ, it's like you've never heard of the disease before," Bobby said dryly.
“You do?” Dean said.
“Leave me alone,” his father said.
Sam said, big eyes watery and accusing as he stared up at Dean from his position, cross-legged and cross-arms and sprawled across the dirt. “Wanna stay and play with Isobel.”
Castiel smiled at him. “It was a friend of mine’s—Anna. She had this cat who just
After jostling a few people after not looking where he was going and a few hasty, whispered apologies, Dean finally made his way to the hall dedicated to Castiel, where a panel read his introduction.
Dean was sure his face resembled a tomato, but he looked up—at Castiel. Castiel was already sketching, it seemed, the pencil in his hand so fast it was nearly a blur before suddenly, abruptly slowing to add a single line or two. It was oddly hypnotic to watch, no sound in the room save for the barely-perceptible scratching of graphite.
“How are you going to get it all the way up there?” Cas said, but he was teasing, now, eyes bright.
“Absolutely not,” Dean immediately said, face like Castiel just dropkicked a puppy. “And leave you at home alone? On Prom night? What kind of best friend would I be?”
“I’m glad you didn’t,” Castiel commented, rinsing out his palette and brushes, carefully wiping off the handles with a cloth.
Finally taking his hands off of Castiel, Dean fixed him instead with a piercing stare.
Sarah sighed. “Nevermind,” she said.
When Dean reached the door, he held a hand out to knock, and then stopped; looked into the window, instead.
“That pie is rightfully mine.”
Riddled in his thoughts, Castiel was suddenly jerked into awareness by a startling sound.
it, Dean,” he snapped.
Sam got a look on his face that was equal resignation and reluctancy. “Dare,” he said stiffly.
And it just got easier. Dean learned to let go, and the rest just followed.
“Always,” was Dean’s warm reply. And Castiel felt himself sink into it, even though he knew he would drown.
Three people, Dean, and it’s an
“Ten minutes,” she said.
“This is just because I can,” Cas said. Kiss. “Because I want to.” Another kiss, and Dean was going to drive this car right off the highway and into a ditch and he didn’t even care.
“Nice to meet you, Katrina,” Castiel said. “How are you finding this evening? Enjoying all the art, I hope?”
It wasn't cute when Dean was rubbing Castiel's back while he threw up what seemed to be an entire barrelful of flowers into the nearby bushes. It wasn't cute when it got exponentially worse, until all Dean could see, think of, talk about (not to Cas, of course not to Cas, but all of his usual frat friends got a hefty earful of Dean's worries), were those dark purple flowers. Wolfbane. The smell followed Dean into his dreams.
“I didn’t get it all,” Castiel said, his voice nothing more than a spiderweb, it was so soft. “I’m sorry. I am. I couldn’t stand it. The thought of getting rid of them all, getting rid of everything I felt for you, forever and so deathly permanent—I just couldn’t.” He paused, and when it was clear Dean wasn’t going to cut in (couldn’t; he couldn’t even breathe) he took a deep breath and continued. “I asked them to remove the flowers that were in my system. Just so I wouldn’t be throwing them up all the time. I didn’t let them take the rest away. Not the source. Not the root—pun not intended.” He tried to smile, but dropped it quickly. “It’s okay, though, isn’t it? I got better. It’s okay, now.”
“Thanks, Gabe. I appreciate it.”
If it wasn’t for Gabriel’s phone call-
And that’s not a coincidence. Castiel might not have found any useful information on this ‘Ben’ person, he did find out this week was the station’s annual retreat when looking for Donna’s phone number. He wasn’t going to walk straight into a police station while under the watchful eye of Mr. Winchester's numerous staff members, that would be signing his own death sentence, guaranteed.
Besides nodding absentmindedly, Paula doesn’t seem as if she’s going to answer that question and Castiel begins to feel as if he’ll never know. But then she scoots a bit closer, hushing her voice even though they’re the only ones home, and whispers “el diablo”.
The line disconnects before he can even protest or ask questions.
something but for the past three hours he’s been stuck in the same corner like a scolded child.
He doesn’t know but that’s not the important part here.
That night, Dean goes to bed perfectly content after a quick session of jacking off, his power over the blue eyed man entrancingly intoxicating.
Then again, it was clear this wasn’t your average household, nor was Dr. Beaumont an average practitioner, rather a privately owned doctor paid thousands to pamper everyone of the Winchester family beyond what was strictly necessary and Castiel had to admit; he could be worse off.
So as Castiel pushes the sweat soaked sheets away from his aching muscles to face yet another unpredictable day, he equally puts aside what images had been haunting him the hours before because men like Mr. Winchester take what they can get and if the breakfast buffet is composed of vulnerability still hot from where it had been brooding, who knows how much closer that would bring one’s time of death?
“This,” Mr. Winchester grits out before aggressively grabbing Cas’s hand and pushing it right against the hardness clad in expensive, tight fabric, “you know what to do with it, don’t you?” But Castiel yanks his arm back as hard as he can, firmly shaking his head and watching the capitalist in fright as he tries to scoot away impossibly further. “No, no, please, don’t.”
“What?” Sam said again, this time an instinctive rhetorical response rather than an actual question, and then, “No. No! What are you, in third grade?”
“Okay.”
“There you are,” he murmured. “Just got a little lost, didn’t you?”
Castiel felt something stir inside him, like lava lapping against cracked stone. He watched their fingers brush as they exchanged phones, and the scratching in his lungs spread up to his throat and he thought,
ed, its mouth wide open and eyes tightly closed. Wings still pinned firmly behind its back; it couldn’t even fly yet.
Cas got into bed with him, and Dean didn't know what to do. He just didn't know what to do. He pulled Cas closer, and felt his heart break a little and breathed a little easier at the same time.
Dean was stunned for a second. “Sorry, what?”
“I’m willing to forget about it if you are,” Castiel offered, and Dean stared for a second before realizing, belatedly, that this was an olive branch.
“It’s okay,” Castiel said.
“For what?”
“So,” the man began, a few steps in. “You’re here to be a knight, huh? You excited?”
"And then I'll die," Castiel said. The words fell flat on the floor between them like a gavel, or roadkill.
The sunset was still beautiful afterwards, but for some reason, it hurt Dean’s eyes just a little when he stared for too long.
“That Prince Sam is only sixteen, but already a revelled member in diplomatic discussions,” Castiel said next. The man—Castiel didn’t even know his name, he realized, but it was strange to bring up in the middle of a conversation anymore, so he remained silent—seemed to be rather knowledgeable, knowing enough about the castle to not be an intruder nor stranger, enough that Castiel let a bit of his true curiosity slip into the conversation.
When Castiel had to excuse himself in the middle of writing his midterms to fling himself out of his seat, covering his mouth desperately as he scrambled across the room and towards the exit—when he couldn’t even make it to the exit, sinking to his knees and clutching his stomach as he shuddered through waves of pain and he vomited and vomited and vomited—
“No, it’s not.”
Cas said.
“That’s not fair,” Dean said, barely breathing. “You’re not allowed to do that.”
"Dean," Sam said, hesitantly. "I think—I think Dad should get the surgery."
For the next five minutes, Dean went through a myriad of opinions involving Cas’s hair and Cas’s hands and Cas’s body against his, all of which he violently shoved back into that damp, dark, dusty back drawer in his head.
“You’re just jealous you can’t see purple,” Sam singsonged. His eyes were bright and giddy.
“I did—but why not tell me still?”
and takes a step back, dips his head down slightly, extends a graceful hand (or as graceful as he can be with the buzz of champagne fading away with the dregs of exhaustion seeping back in) towards Castiel.
Dean was flummoxed for a second. “Me?”
A startling amount of maturity would be a repeat trait in Sam, Dean soon realized, as he shot up in mobility, speech capacity, and vocabulary (“It’s revolting!” he had cried the first time his mother tried to feed him asparagus. His mother had frozen in shock. His father had exploded into guffaws). Shortly after Sam learned to crawl, he learned to stand, and after that, walking came as easy as a breeze. Soon, Sam was tottling all over the house, knocking over pots and pans and tearing apart Mary’s cooking magazines and generally causing chaos in the house, trailing with a delighted giggle and a cry of joy.
"Fine," Castiel would reply, every time. And if Dean sounded a little more anxious than usual, a bit more unhinged, he would glance over, notice, and shoot him a small, brief, warm smile. "Really, Dean. Thank you."
"I know," Dean said morosely.
“Careful,” the man said (up with those eyebrows again). “You keep talking like that to everyone here, you could offend someone powerful.”
Yes, I’m a fan—saw your art exhibit and all. Loved it. Really—introspective stuff.”
“Good,” he said, hoarse, and tried again. “M’fine. Just, um. Worried.”
I swear, she has infinite energy.”
“You’re on stage three,” he said, and Castiel jerked, blinked at Dean with surprise in his eyes. “I researched it, you know. You throw up more than twice a day, your coughing is persistent, now, and I’m willing to bet that there's going to be blood, soon." There was something akin to fire in his eyes, an emerald flame. "What is it—no,
The song ended, and a slower song filtered in. A classic. Around them, the crowd's murmurs grew low and excited, pairs reaching out for each other’s hands and dragging them away from the snack table. Meg came closer and Castiel’s arms went around her as she turned her head to the side, pressing her cheek into his chest. He wondered if she could hear his heartbeat, and tried to push his apology into the pulses. She was perfect. She was stunning and snarky and sharply, passionately kind and everything Castiel wished he wanted. Throughout the venue, the lights grew soft and dampened; pinks and reds and purples swirling into the walls.
“You want me to
Castiel's torso came into view, monochromatic and blurred, white bone and dark cavities piecing together a picture of ribs and spine and lungs. All throughout the image were dark, splotchy masses, like ink splattering across paper, like a tumour had multiplied and grown.
Dean curled up in his bed alone, the smell of flowers in his sheets.
“This is such a bad idea,” Castiel said, his voice whipped by the wind. He could barely see in this awful storm.
“Good,” Castiel said, curt and with the slightest edge.
The surgery. The long, awful surgery that stirred everything up and brought it exploding to the surface. “I wish you never got the surgery,” Dean said, and it was a lie that sat bitter and bloody on his tongue.
Dean grinned. “Oh, Cas.” And now that it was
“Ten minutes,” Dean confirmed, and watched her reverse for a moment before turning on his heel and sprinting for his life down the streets, running calculations in his head. It had been five, nearly ten minutes, now, but Cas always spent a while in the library after school and liked to idle near the entrance when Dean wasn’t there to bug and nag at him to hurry the fuck up, they were wasting away in this building, what the hell was he waiting for? A written letter of dismissal from the principal?
For God’s sake, Castiel didn’t even know what he
“We can be quiet,” Sam mumbled.
The new Castiel said, "Sorry," when Dean got a cold from falling asleep on the couch without a blanket. The new Castiel bought Dean cold medicine and left it on the counter for him before leaving to study in the library. The new Castiel said, "I can wake you up, next time, if you'd like? Or get you a blanket?" when Dean, too tired and sick to mask his thoughts, let his mouth run loose.
Dean said, “What is?” so quietly it was amazing that he heard him at all. Or maybe he’d just imagined it.
"Well, up you go," Singer ordered, and Castiel obediently followed through the routine check-ups before the x-ray was fully developed. Afterwards, they crowded around the mosaic of monitors and watched as the results flickered onto the screen.
It could’ve been anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour when Castiel cleared his throat and stood up. With a sigh, he stretched his arms up to the ceiling, tilting his head from left to right.
After that, with the few flowers Castiel got before that morning of Dean’s birthday, Dean would stay relatively quiet about the whole ordeal, but his curiosity would always win over in the end. He’d meander over to wherever Castiel was working that night and watch with fascination as he smoothed the flower between the pages of the book and shut it tight, stacked half a dozen textbooks on top.
next to him, followed by a solid thwack to his bicep.
Dean wondered, sometimes, if it could’ve been different. If things could have been different, if he’d just been a little bit faster on the uptake, a little bolder, a little wiser, a little less oblivious to what had once been standing, bright and glaring and blinding, right in front of him. If he’d just done things the tiniest bit differently when it wasn’t too late, when the wolfsbane in his fingers were fresh and so soft and accompanied with thousands more.
“Mom,” Dean said, “How do flowers grow inside you?”
“So you know how dangerous this disease has gotten? How far it’s progressed?”
“Please look at me.”
“I didn’t mean,” Dean began helplessly. “Nevermind. This works.” If you ignored the fact that Dean’s hands were ratcheting up a tremble against Cas’s calloused fingers. “Okay, next, gas. We’re on the highway, and there aren’t too many cars, so this should work. See my right foot on that pedal? Just ease up on there and press down. Not too hard.”
With a word of thanks and a quick farewell, Castiel was once more on his way.
“You were—you didn’t—I just—”
“Those rules are
of a coincidence—
When he spoke again, it was with the utmost care. “I just never really got the chance.”
“Any,” Dean yelled back, glancing at the road and drifting the Impala slightly to the left so that there was ample space between the car and the guardrail. That would be one hell of a roadrash.
When Dean woke up after falling asleep on the couch with a crick in his neck and a chill along his side, he thought, the old Castiel would have woken me up and teased me about my sleep deprivation. The old Castiel would have brought me a blanket.
Dean's lips quirked up at the sound, shoulders falling from tension just the fraction. "Is it that guy who works at the coffee shop?"
“Did you like that story?” his mother asked him afterwards, smoothing a hand down his sleepy head.
"As if I’ll party at all."
couldn’t put up with me for long enough to even marry. Not a single one—I didn’t get to keep a single one.”
A few short seconds later, the elevator lurched gently beneath his feet, and the doors swung open. Castiel stepped out, and, feeling anticipation building with each step, made his way towards the lobby. Maybe they had blueberry—that was his favourite. The cafeteria cooks were incredible with their pastries, and Castiel could feel his mouth watering by the time he entered the lobby. Was it just his imagination, or could he actually smell the pie?
to find a catapult alright, but Dean
“Yeah,” Dean said. “Why?”
Dean scrubbed at his eyes, glanced at his phone, glanced at the half-crumpled scrawling of notes, and promptly decided that it was time for a brain break. Maybe a four-hour brain break.
Dean took one hand off the wheel to snap his fingers. “Exactly!”
Sam was waiting for him at the top of the staircase, his hands resting on his lap and his eyes lowered at the shadows cast onto the carpet from the streetlamps outside. He looked up when he heard Dean approaching. “What happened? Is Dad okay?”
(But, in twenty-twenty hindsight, Dean could see, now, the sparks of desire. He could see, now, the way he pinched them off, stomped on them until they were nothing more but ash, before his consciousness could even register. Maybe it was karma that made them erupt into flames, now, when it was too late. Or maybe Dean was just too tired, too drained, to hide it any longer.)
Tom gave Castiel another smile; easy, friendly. “Dean sounds like a good guy,” he said. “Even though he doesn’t love you back.”
Castiel laughed. “I’m sure.”
“Ah, no,” Dean said, and coughed. “It’s for my brother. He’s a huge fan of you. He’d probably, uh, pass out or something if he met you.”
Dean’s own fingers twitched, and he reached out, but hesitated at the last second. “Can I, um.” Cas didn’t like people touching him, not even Miss Penny.
ing,” Charlie yelled, sparing only a second’s attention to look back before throwing the thought away in favour of chasing after Kevin, who was laughing ahead of both of them, legs pumping to clear the distance back to their classroom. Their teacher was at the door, busy ushering all the other kids inside, helping them take off their indoor shoes and hang up their hats and pull up their socks by the ankles.
“Modelled?” Castiel said, eyes rising to meet Dean’s. “I’m surprised.”
"What's wrong with Cas?" he'd demanded. (Later, he'd told Castiel he hadn't asked Bobby about him specifically, and he was only half lying. He hadn't meant to, really. It had just... come out.)
Dean watched Cas and swallowed. He really wanted to hug him—but Cas
“I love the snow,” Dean admitted.
Dean grins. “Told ya.”
Tom smiled. He had a nice smile. “Yeah. Hey, Castiel. You look good.”
Together, they stumble out the car, into their home, up the stairs—neither of them carrying the other because if they’d tried, they were so tired they’d probably drop them, and wouldn’t that be a nice end to their wedding night?—into their bedroom. Dean unbuckles his belt, slides out of his jacket, clothes puddling on the carpet along with Castiel’s as he follows suit. Castiel yanks on his tie with a frustrated growl; Dean chuckles and comes closer. He undoes it for him while Castiel unbuttons Dean’s dress shirt with clumsy fingers, one by one.
“Please,” Dean said, and he really was pleading, now. “I just want you to be okay. I care about you, you know that. I care about you a lot.”
Dean's laugh was loud and carefree in a way that loosened something inside Castiel. "Nevermind, then. Can you do the dishes?"
Sam looked dubious, like he had been planning on helping Dean carry the bags up to his room, unpack, and then kick his roommate (the email had told him Castiel Novak, and Dean had thought, what kind of name was that?) out before moving in himself.
“I’ve got it from here,” he said, grabbing his luggage.
"Right," Castiel would say, and snort, and roll his eyes.
“Really?” Castiel sounded genuinely piqued, looking over at Dean with that piercing gaze of his. “Why?”
“Because,” Dean said, and scratched his head. “Because you love someone.” Ms. Smith had read a book on it in class once, Dean remembered, something about roses and a boy next door. Dean recalled asking Ms. Smith why the girl hadn’t just stopped loving the boy next door, because if she got sick because of the love, couldn’t she just get rid of it? Ms. Smith had looked upset, but Dean hadn’t known why. “And they don’t love you back.”
“Don’t worry,” he said. “I told you, I’m a friend. I’ll explain everything to Dean.”
"Oh, that one. Did you check your closet?"
“Next time he’s mean to you,” Dean said, “tell me, and I’ll steal his lunchbox again.”
“I suppose,” Castiel started. “It’s an honour to be chosen.”
“Why don’t you take a seat?” Bobby said, leaning against the door of the office and eyeing Dean’s twitchy stance.
Cas looked pleased. “Your turn,” he said.
Sam was unmoving. “You did the same to me before.”
He spared one look towards the classroom, where Miss Penny was nowhere to be seen, now, the door still propped open and a ricochet of chatter coming from inside the classroom. He turned away from it and began to walk determinedly towards the source of the noise.
Sam insisted on coming with him, and even though Dean had groaned and rolled his eyes and said,
Dean met Benny’s family through a barrage of loud messages and cursing voicemails that Benny paled at, shakily pushing Dean away as he clutched the phone in his hands. He said he was sorry, and that he would come back as soon as he could, he promised—just as soon as he sorted this out, he could make them understand, he was sure, he just couldn’t do it over the phone and he couldn’t possibly tell them to come over here. So Dean kissed him goodbye at the airport and clung to him one last time before he stepped through the security gates and Dean never saw him again.
“You won, sweetheart,” Mary had said to him so gently. Though, the sadness when she continued? That will haunt him forever. “You won, sweetheart,
” Lukas had said on the phone roughly a week after the facts. That was when Dean finally decided to take a little trip west to deal with the situation himself because his own bodyguards apparently weren’t capable of doing so themselves.
He’d panicked initially, tried to cover up his body like a fool but what good would that do him? There isn’t any level of vulnerability more intense than standing completely naked in someone else’s shower while the host himself waltzes in as if he, well, owns the place.
“It’s alcohol-free.”
* Chapter 06 : Horns - Bryce Fox
His hands stop just short of Castiel’s cheek, almost as if they’re demanding permission for once.
“When you’re done crying and whining, I want a fresh cup of coffee. Black, no sugar, quick delivery.”
Song for this chapter: 'way down we go' - Kaleo
Murder? That Castiel knew already. But what about physical abuse? Torture? Rape?
“We’re here, sir. Please remain close and do as our men say until you are safely inside.” They sneak around as if they’re on a special ops mission despite the house literally only being a few feet away but Castiel has to admit that if he’s forced to maneuver in the dark, he’d rather do it with these trained people by his side. If only they’d tell him what the fuck was going on.
