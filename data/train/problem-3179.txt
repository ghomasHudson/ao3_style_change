Dean tilted his head. He didn’t know this man. Didn’t want to believe a word he was saying and yet something in his gut was telling him, he should listen.
“Yeah, of course,” Castiel replied, still distracted, “And you can tell me how exactly you’ve managed to trick my brother and fake my death.  Just so I know that he won’t come knocking at the door trying finish the job himself.”
Anael nodded. “So, you’re not going to do this.”
It was at that moment when his eyes began to play tricks on him. The shadows started to dance up ahead, crawling closer in the shapes of beasts and monsters. Like they were chasing him. Hunting him, like his brother wanted. He was certain that weeds had begun to entwine around his ankles, it felt like they were wrapping around him, trying to capture him in one spot. Castiel’s breathing was heavy and he felt disorientated. He frantically glanced around, at his dimly lit surroundings, before just running. He darted straight ahead, not knowing where he was actually heading. Unsure where he was even going. Not able to clear his mind to remember Dean’s directions.
Anael raised her eyebrows and leant back in her chair, she carefully placed her cup down on the table in front of them. It clinked on a saucer as she did so.
He turned his head in the direction of the busy bar, it was loud and he could see Charlie mingling in the middle of a bunch of people. Most of them were other students. Cas wasn’t surprised that Charlie was back on her quest to find a girlfriend. It was something she often did when they went out as a group and though she hadn’t had much luck yet, she was positive this method would help her find someone in the future. She caught Cas’s glance and beckoned him over to join her, but with a polite smile Cas shook his head. Charlie turned away, back towards a girl she’d been talking to with blonde hair and Cas watched as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ears. He found it quite strange that all of his friends were searching for relationships right now when they still had so much time for that. Cas wasn’t really interested in love or relationships and Charlie had always said it was because he
“Who?” he asked, though he was already certain he knew the answer. He didn’t need to hear Dean say it and didn’t want to force it upon him either. He knew Dean had meant his brother. It was why Lucifer had wanted to talk to the hunter yesterday. Why Dean had been a shell of himself afterwards. It was clear this was taking a toll on Dean, who was usually so relaxed and cool headed. The Dean in front of him was a panicked erratic mess. Castiel wondered if Dean’s red, puffy eyes were from lack of sleep or something more. Dean usually kept his emotions buried, often built up a façade but this had shaken him and cracks were beginning to show from his emotional barriers.
Hesitantly, he picked up a spoon and scooped some of the delicacy into an empty bowl, before taking a mouthful. He wasn’t sure what he was eating and he couldn’t determine the texture, but it tasted delicious. It was like nothing he’d ever eaten before. It was so much better than the dry, boring and bland foods Lucifer had made him eat back at the Castle. Castiel immediately took a second mouthful, barely stopping for a breath in between.
Dean chuckled; he would now believe anything was real after the day he’d had. He carefully reached out for Castiel’s hand. Entwining their fingers.
“Fine,” Dean stuttered, though Castiel wasn’t convinced.
“When I first saw him, I was surprised by how short he was as well,” added another.
“But there is a way to break this curse, Your Highness...” Crowley tried to stop the words unravelling out of his mouth, but he couldn’t, “If Prince Castiel is kissed by a true love, he will be awoken.”
Castiel had to do a double take in shock, he slowly let go of Dean’s grasp and frowned.
So this is quickly going from good to bad...
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, we're getting to some intense stuff and angst in the next few, so the happiness at the start was a light breather!
“Try some, there's loads left!” A female voice said, and Castiel turned to see the red-haired girl smiling at him brightly once more.
Dean stormed down the hallways of the Castle. The past few days had been the only times he’d actually been inside and it seemed just as big and confusing as he imagined. He knew he was likely to end up getting lost as he trailed down one corridor and climbed up a set of stairs towards another. Dean wondered about Castiel’s opinion of the place, growing up trapped within the walls with only the guards and an evil brother for company. He told himself to ask the Prince if he saw him again.
When they arrived at the market square it was as busy as ever, but it wasn’t at all the same. It was much quieter, everyone was talking in hushed whispers and avoiding eye contact with each other. There was almost complete silence when people started to notice Dean, it made him uncomfortable. People knew how close he and Castiel were, they’d probably caught drift of Lucifer’s original plan somehow and now they were gossiping and gawping at him when all he wanted was to be alone and mourn.
“Donna does make a mean pie,” Dean said, his voice cracking slightly. He awkwardly beckoned for Castiel to follow with his head and after a moment of consideration Cas decided he would. They both trudged over to the group and Charlie cheered when she saw them. Everyone was laughing at something dumb Sam had said. Dean instantly burst into hysterics and not long after Castiel ended up laughing too. Donna handed them both bowls with large helpings of the pie and Castiel watched as Dean’s face lit up. The rest of the night was a blur. Everyone exchanging stories. Sharing the love.
Dean shook his head with a grin, slightly embarrassed that Cas knew him so well. Slightly embarrassed he hadn’t realised that nearly everything they’d end up doing for the next month would all be part of some act despite the fact this had been his idea. His drunken idea. At least they both knew it was fake, so anything that did happen couldn’t blur the lines of their friendship. Actions like that were all an act, so things hopefully wouldn’t be awkward when the whole scenario was over. His heartbeat was still faster than he’d like it to be so Dean picked up one of the sugar packets Cas had been playing with and twiddled it between his fingers as a distraction. He flickered his gaze back up towards Cas, who still looked pretty pleased with himself. Dean scoffed, but couldn’t help looking at Cas with full admiration.
Crowley trailed off as an image began to project itself onto the glass. The mirror displayed a view from outside the Castle, within the grounds, focusing on a small and rusty Well. The sun shone brightly in the sky and glimmered off the water from inside it. An array of colourful birds were perched on the roof of the well. They were singing a blissful song and attentively paying attention to someone. A figure of a young man now became visible on the mirror. He was knelt down, beside the well. Lucifer rolled his eyes already knowing who it was. Jealousy sieging control of him.
“I knew it,” Dean uttered and he was off again.
Whilst he was still free.
“Come on Dean,” Sam said, rolling his eyes at his brother, “We both know what's going on here. Don’t make me spell it out for you.”
Dean let out a shaky exhale and placed his hand over Castiel’s. It was still quite warm but was cooling by the second. Dean thought he could hear the faintest heartbeat, but was unsure if it was just his mind playing tricks on him. Hoping was a dangerous game. Dean felt the tears prick his eyes and this time there was no way to hold them back, they tumbled down his face uncontrollably. Dean couldn’t bare the site of Castiel like this and instead looked up to the heavens, like he was praying, wishing for a miracle that he knew wasn’t going to come.
“Ouch,” he mumbled to himself, peering at the sleeves of his shirt which were now covered in dirt and small remnants of blood. He glanced around at his surroundings once more, slightly dazed.
“Okay,” Castiel replied, with a laugh, “Now why don’t you tell me a tale from your little adventure, which is why you came here anyway,” Castiel rest his head on his hands and peered up at Dean. Dean wrinkled his nose and grinned.
“Okay....”
“Dean didn’t lie about his eyes though...”
Dean didn’t reply for a moment and Cas was prepared to hang up when he heard his best friend’s voice once more.
“Cas...you’re....you...” Dean stuttered, not quite able to process what had just happened.
Then he bit into the apple.
The silence and emptiness in the room were making things worse for Dean and all he could focus on were the voices screaming inside his head, trying to form a decent plan to get out of this mess. To save Castiel, because if he didn’t go along with this-he knew someone else would. He let out a shallow shaky breath and suddenly an idea began to formulate in his mind.
“I can’t believe I trusted that Winchester to do this...of course why was I so stupid...I guess some jobs I have to carry out myself.”
On the fifth day of Castiel’s stay things were going to be different. The hunters needed to go out on a hunt, otherwise they would end up running out of food and stock. Castiel would’ve loved to have gone with them but he knew it was safer to stay back and mind the house. He sat at the table sipping his beverage from a mug and watched as everyone packed their equipment and started to leave the cottage. Dean hung back and glanced over at Castiel as he slowly placed his duffel bag over his shoulder.
As always, thank you so much for reading,
Lisa would most likely being going too, so there they could carry out the reason why they had even agreed to do this in the first place. The reasons Cas believed they were doing this. And in this month, he could spend plenty of time with Cas, because after they inevitably pretend to break up from their fake relationship, it would seem weird if they hung out as much immediately after.
“Oh wow, what a heartfelt apology,” Cas jeered back sarcastically.
“Just like I told you last time, I don’t think I’m ready yet,” he stated, “My focus right now is on our people, my heart is for them and only them right now. And besides I don’t think I'll ever have ‘true love’, brother.”
“Because of Dean?” he asked, his voice higher than normal.
Suddenly, a bush just in front of Castiel began to rustle. He snapped his head around in the direction of the sound instantly, clenching his fist tightly in fear. He didn’t know what to expect, he wondered if somehow Dean had failed and Lucifer had already sent someone else after him.
Castiel sulked back in his chair. He would always ignore the lists Lucifer provided him with as his brother had the most bland and boring palette known to man. He swallowed back the sarcastic reply he wanted to give and instead decided it best he remained civil.
“We should, Sammy,” Dean replied, his voice quiet and empty, “And we should take Castiel home to his people too...to say goodbye.”
Cas replied, sarcastically, avoiding any eye contact with Dean to make sure Dean knew he was annoyed at him. Dean let out a quiet wheeze.
Cas tried to remain serious but couldn’t help chuckling. So basically, everyone could see that Eileen and Sam were in love with each other but them. They were so oblivious it was quite funny. Maybe Dean was right, maybe this would push them together like Cas was already planning to try do.
Castiel let out another long yawn and realised he was blinking hard to even keep his eyes open. He glanced around at the beds once more and noticed initials were carved into the headrests. One specifically stood out to him.
Castiel shook his head at Dean’s final words, trying to hide the up turning corners of his mouth. Dean just raised his eyebrows, the grin still plastered across his face.
Charlie pouted in her seat.
It's coming...
Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath before thinking long and hard. Anael was right, he had to do what he thought was best, and yet the only thing that seemed right to him was helping Dean. Because she was right, Dean was his friend and he wanted him to be happy and that was really all that mattered to him. He’d get to spend more time with Dean too before the inevitability of Lisa returned. Maybe it could benefit him too.
The market square was a busy place. Loud and messy. Full of people either trying to trade or enjoy themselves with the company of others. There were Stall owners yelling competitively to see who could spare the best deal on a wide range of fruit and veg, whilst horses' hooves clicked against the cobbled floor as they impatiently waited for the return of their owners, who themselves were most likely on tavern crawls. Music and laughter could be heard from all around as many of the townsfolk gathered in the village as respite from their busy daily schedules.
Lucifer nodded in acknowledgement and let out a deep sigh.
Most of which, centered on wondering if Dean was okay.
In the evening, everyone gathered at the table and ate a meal together. Castiel found the experience rather fascinating, as all of his eating experiences had just been him and Lucifer, sat in mostly silence, in the dark and dingy dining hall. But here everyone was joking and laughing. The fire was lit causing the room to glow, giving the place a real homely feel. Sam and Eileen were practically sat in each others laps, feeding one another and heavily flirting. Charlie would glance at Castiel and roll her eyes at the sight, but it was clear she was joking. Donna and Jody had cooked the meal and were taking compliments in from Bobby with pride. Everyone was smiling. They were enjoying themselves. Castiel found that he was enjoying himself too.
To be loved and to have love, that was what Castiel had said. Castiel wanted to be loved. Dean couldn't get that thought out of his mind.
Cas had woken up early and decided to go for a run. He’d remained sober, so the events from last night were vivid in his head. He tried to shake them but Dean’s words rang clearly in his ears.
“And now, a special sort of death for one you say is so fair,” he trailed off, before placing the remnants of the apple in his cauldron, “A poisoned apple.”
They stood there for a second longer. Dean ran his hand through his hair.
Dean turned to face Cas, who was staring at his phone screen. Cas held his phone up to Dean’s eye line so he could see the plethora of texts that Charlie had sent him, asking where they both were and informing them that they were late. Very late. The last text was a bit of cry for help as she apparently starting to feel very much like a ‘third wheel’. Dean chuckled to himself, imagining Charlie stuck alone with Sam and Eileen. The pair were probably just staring at each other longingly like usual and Charlie, no matter how much she wanted them together, probably wanted the ground to swallow her whole.
Lucifer had now stopped messing with his bowl and was sat up straight, arms folded, eyes on Castiel. Castiel shivered and gulped, making his Adam's apple bobble in his throat.
“You’re safe here, kid,” He said, “I’m Bobby.”
Castiel crouched down slightly so he was level with the young foxes and smiled.
Castiel’s pupil darted around a bit as he glanced down bashfully.
Cas wakes up still annoyed, the night before vividly in his mind.
“Why don’t we go back and see what the two love birds are up to?” she said, “If they still haven’t gotten their act together and announced their undying love for each other I’m going to have to lock them in a room or something soon.”
His words hung in the air for a moment. Dean shook his head slowly but his heart had already skipped a beat. Countless memories flashed before his eyes, all of them of him and Castiel. When they were younger to the present. From the time they first met as children to the other day when for a moment Dean thought they were going to kiss. Dean had never noticed the look in Castiel’s eyes, full of admiration, he’d always ignored it because it felt like it was too much to assume the Prince ever felt that way. Could want a guy who was just a hunter in that way. But this was Cas. He was different.
Dean’s house was messier than Castiel had first expected, with clothes and pots and weapons strung everywhere. He tutted and shook his head before deciding he would clean up a little whilst waiting for Dean to return home, as he was supposed to. It would also resemble a thank you for saving his life, though he would still need to pay Dean back at lot more in the long run.
He exhaled, taking a second.
Castiel's expression was dumbfounded, and it took him a moment to recollect an answer.
Castiel reluctantly glanced around at where they were. Properly absorbing the surroundings for the first time. He had never been this far out of the Castle walls. He had never seen the forest this close up and never in his dreams had he imagined this would be the situation where he’d get a chance to. It hadn’t even happened in his worst nightmares.
“I thought he’d be taller,” one voice said.
“Get rid, how?” Crowley questioned, his voice low and tamed, “You could just exile him?”
Cas smiled to himself as he watched Dean bundle through a crowd of people and walk over to the bar. He could still hear Sam and Eileen next to him still deep in conversation and he slouched back into his chair at ease. Maybe Dean was right, tonight would be one of the best nights ever. He closed his eyes. He probably should’ve taken Dean’s offer up with the cocktail, if it wasn’t too late, maybe he could go order with him.
“I’m always here. You just don’t notice,” came Gabriel’s reply, he didn’t take his eyes off his laptop screen, “I told you I have no friends, apart from Anael, so I like to spend my time here. It’s peaceful, I can write and I’m helping out a local business.”
Dean slowly shook his head. Still trying to avoid Lucifer’s full attention.
It wasn’t long before something caught Castiel’s eye. A flash travelling across the sky. It was a shooting star.
“Ouch...ouch...Castiel you have wounded my ego,” Dean teased back.
Dean could’ve murdered him right there and then, his right hand tightly gripping the handle of the dagger. He was ready to lunge forward, give that son of a bitch what he deserved. But he stopped himself. He wasn’t like Lucifer. He wasn’t a murderer. Castiel wouldn’t want him to do that.
Trigger Warning in this chapter for mentions of John Winchester and implied past abuse.
“I can’t...not here,” Castiel raised an eyebrow, confused at Dean’s admission. Dean glanced around and lowered his voice before continuing, “Meet me tomorrow, just outside the castle walls. I need to tell you something. Something big.”
Dean loved Castiel with every fibre of his being, and he was going to try and save him once more. Even if Crowley’s words weren’t true, Dean was going to try. Dean peered up catching the eye of Crowley once more, there was a glimmer as though he could tell that this was going to work. Crowley nodded at the boy, wishing him luck but also reaffirming his words.
Sam finally made his way over to Dean and before Dean could even respond he pulled his brother into a tight hug.
There was clear sarcasm in Castiel's tone but that didn't stop the twinge Dean felt in his gut. He tilted his head in Castiel’s direction, biting his lip, trying to hold back a nervous laugh.
Dean fumbled around in his pockets, looking for his fake ID. It was cold outside and he’d rather be inside the bar with his friends than stuck outside in the dark, but the fairly impatient looking bouncer in front of him was certain on not letting Dean in without proof of identification.
“I’ll be fine, Dean. Don’t worry about me.”
Lucifer and Castiel sat at opposite ends of the table for dinner, which they rarely even ate together. The long table had countless amounts of empty chairs, making the whole scenario seem daunting to an outsider. Lucifer usually sat on a throne at the head of the table, showing off his power and emphasising to his brother who is in charge. Castiel normally is seated as far away as possible, otherwise Lucifer feels threatened by his presence.
Zachariah looked over at Castiel and then down at the coffee, and took it from his hands.  "I did just finish mine.  Could use a top off."
"I would pick Bobby or Ellen too, but we're not allowed to pick our parents."
.  Dean covered his own face from no one in a moment of embarrassment.  How had he let that happen?  Sure he was a pretty drunk last night, but he wasn't the blasted one.  He had no excuse to tear up like he had.  He suddenly had to get out of there.  It was time to meet Charlie for coffee anyway.  He quickly grabbed his keys off of the hook and threw on his leather jacket and bookbag before going out the door, hoping that Benny would wake up and go to his own class before Cas did.
and opened the door slowly and quietly, hoping that whoever was out there wouldn't see them.  The door was cracked ever so slightly, but they could still see what they needed to.  Dean felt Cas put his hand on Dean's shoulder and peak his head under Dean's arm to look too.
He could hear Bobby laughing from behind the paper that he had picked up again.  Ellen responded, "Honey, it's important that you complete all the sacraments.  If for no other reason than to make me sleep better at night, baby."
Dean nodded and sighed so hard he thought that some braincells came out.  "Very unfortunately", he muttered.
"DEAN?!" Jess gasped
Dean wiped his face with his sleeve and looked back into Castiel’s eyes before pointing to his eye, his heart, and then back at Castiel.  A communication that he witnessed his mom and dad use throughout his whole childhood.  He didn’t care that everyone could see it.
Dean learned that Castiel was a freshman like he was, but that he lived across campus in the suite buildings with these two.  Gabriel and Baz were confirmed on time, but Castiel never had a chance to in high school because he spent his sophomore year abroad through his high school's French department.  The three of them had actually grown up together, and their parents were in a prayer group together.  They were all incredibly religious, but in the not loving and cuddly way that Ellen and Bobby were.  They changed the subject quickly to Dean once that fact had slipped out of Baz's mouth.
Suddenly Cas took a deep and frustrated breath, and without looking up said, "If you want to sit down, just do it, I'm not sure why you're waiting for an invitation."
"Yeah," Dean said quietly, "That's right."
Castiel flinched at the nickname.  No one had ever called him Cas.  Not once.  He got Cassie sometimes when his family was yanking his chain or trying to make him blush, but never Cas.  It was always Castiel.  And here was this boy, someone he's never met, in his kitchen, touching his dishes, and calling him whatever the hell he wants.
"Cas?" Dean called out, running back over to his friend, who was laying on the floor, more water getting on his clothes, and then slid onto his knees to grab Cas's head, "Are you okay, champ?".  Cas's face was tight in a grimace with his eyes closed like his was in pain.  Dean pet his hair back from his forehead and continued, "What hurts, Cas?  How can I help?"
"Yessir", Castiel replied.
Finally, Castiel picked up a stained baseball t-shirt and sighed, "I don't understand how so many of these items are completely unwearable.", he complained, "These people are homeless!  They don't need clothes with giant stains on them or holes.  People should be donating clothes that are still in good condition.  Just because they don't have houses, doesn't mean they don't deserve to be clothed properly."  Bela, Ruby, and Dean all just looked at him for a minute.  He looked at the three of them, "I apologize for the suddenness of that comment, this is just the 10th shirt with a stain like this in it an it's incredibly frustrating."
She slumped a little in her chair, looking a little defeated.  Her expression was thoughtful as she chewed on the inside of her cheek.  After a few moments of silence, Charlie finally asked Dean to start from the beginning, as Dean predicted she would.
Cas knew that Dean was getting hard too.  He could feel it pressed against his leg and he knew that he should be doing something for Dean too, but having not done this before and not being used to pleasure like this, he was frozen and his thoughts were fuzzy.
Dean pointed at the girls as they ran passed him, "You know these two?"
The stranger took a second to breath out his start and then cracked a smile, "You really gon' hide with your head peakin' out like a 5 year old?"
Balthazar just sighed for what seemed like 2 minutes straight and then looked up at the ceiling, "Being a junior in college can eat its own ass, that's how it's going.  I can't wait for us all to drink our own weight tonight."
"You broke our pet nun", Balthazar chuckled into the phone, "He's still vomiting in the bathroom as we speak, kitten.  What the hell did you do to him?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean smiled, "I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna have to raincheck that one.  I have a test at 8."
Gabriel and Baz began to boo incredibly loud and Balthazar took his arm off of Dean to move it to Gabriel's shoulders as they walked ahead of Dean and Castiel into the cold night air.  They started mooing instead of booing and both Dean and Castiel started to chuckle.
Cas's expression softened and he took a deep breath.  He moved his hand from Dean's chest, to his left hand, which was laying on his side against the driveway underneath them.  Dean's breath surged and he held it.  Cas grabbed his lower lip in his mouth and looked down at Dean's hand before saying, "I wish I could take your pain away."
Dean was almost running the entire way home, so excited to wash away the anxiety and exhaustion from this hellish week of studying and preparing.  He tripped over himself as he walked in the door of his room and started stripping immediately.
Dean sighed before lifting his head and looking at Castiel again, who was now wearing an incredibly fond look on his face, his smile spread from ear to ear in a way that said
Dean folded his lips into his mouth and created a thin line on his face as he tried to push the violent thoughts out of his head.  It was a good thing that Cas lived so far away, because Dean would have probably killed the guy if he had ran into him after this.  "What did he want?"
Kelly's eyes fluttered as she averted his look.  "I'm sorry.  I just don't want you to get hurt, that's all."
Dean didn't know.
He could tell that Cas was getting close.  Dean picked up his head and saw Cas with his eyes screwed shut, his mouth agape, and his breaths labored.  Dean whimpered at the sight, trying his best not to grind himself into Castiel.
"Yeah but then
Castiel’s eyes were the size of the moon as he realized what was about to happen, and Dean flashed him a wicked grin just before leaning down over him and attacking him with tickles and quick sweet kisses on his cheeks and nose.
Dean thought about it for a minute. He had no clue.  He had only been at school for a month, the end of the year seemed a million miles away. "I think I heard Benny say at some point that we finish in early May, but I'm not 100% sure.  Why are you asking?"
Dean spent the next twenty minutes recounting memories from his childhood.  He told Castiel all about the time that the family went to Disney World and Sammy managed to get lost in Magic Kingdom, the time that his parents ended up sneaking Dean into a rock concert and Dean cried, and the time where Sam and Dean had snuck out of the house when Sam was only eleven and his father caught them at a high school party.  The both of them were a mess of tears and giggles as Dean told these stories, and Dean felt like he was soaring.  He had never talked about his parents this much with anyone, and although it was scary opening up, Cas allowed Dean to do it in a way that made Dean feel like he was protected and safe.
Cas looked at Dean for a minute and then looked back down at the stack of plates underneath him, "That's fine, Dean.".  Cas flashed a tiny smile by raising the corner of his mouth.  Cas picked up the plates and started to scrape them off into the garbage can.  The shrieking sound of fork on porcelain was the only sound in the air for a few moments until Dean heard the rest of the family turn on the TV two rooms over.
There was some slight ruffling up ahead.  It sounded distant, but not so distant that Dean couldn’t catch up.  Dean sent up a silent prayer that it wasn’t a serial killer or a wild animal and took off in the direction of the noise.
Enjoy, and thank you to those of you leaving comments! It means the world <3
you don't wanna just hang out here with me during the break?", she asked, knowing full well what Castiel's answer was going to be.
Their Christmas was hectic as usual.  Everyone on the block stopped by the house to get a slice of Ellen's homemade pies and the house seemed more and more like an inn for about a week and a half.  It was nice, though.  The house was always more alive when there were more people there, and he hadn't seen a lot of the usual suspects since he had left for school in August.  He finally got a chance to catch up with his friend, Ash, from high school, and had his promise to come visit him on campus sometime.  By the time the holiday had ended, Dean was about two crescent rolls away from turning into one himself, and he was prepared for the new semester with lots of new clothes, movies, and books to bring back with him.
Dean looked down at Cas fondly as his head leaned up against Dean’s chest.  Dean smiled as he looked at Cas’s hair pressed up against his sweater when he was suddenly shocked out of his loving gaze.
"I'm not sure yet.  Cas seems really freaked though.  He said he didn't know where else to go.  I brought him into the back porch and I'm gonna go bring him this so he can tell me.", Dean gestured toward the plate he was holding.  "He's forming a black eye, so this can't be good."
Balthazar squealed and clapped with glee, "Who or what brought this on, sweet cheeks?"
Dean could feel his neck and face start to heat up as Cas moved his lips down slowly to his jaw and then down to his neck more.  Dean held his breath and felt his arms move from his face down and around Castiel’s back as Cas kissed him.  Dean’s hands traveled on the surface of Cas’s shirt and lightly squeezed his somewhat soft sides.  Dean exhaled as Cas darted his tongue out against Dean’s rough stubble when suddenly Cas jerked back hard and let out a little squeak.
Dean just smiled, deciding for once, not to avert his eyes.  "Nothing."
Cas lifted his hands to his face and groaned again, "Oh Dean, I still can't believe it.  I feel so awful about it."
"Oh definitely.", Dean agreed.  "I was about one beer away from passing out and Sam would have been terrified.  He let me have it when we got home.  I didn't know it then, but he was protecting me."
If Cas could bother to be embarrassed, he might have cared that he was about 10 seconds into kissing Dean and was already to moan into his mouth, but he didn’t have it in him.  All he needed was Dean.  Now.
Dean rushed into his room and changed so fast he actually slipped a couple of times.  His socks on the slippery hard floor mixed with his frenzy were a recipe for disaster.  Once he finally had everything he wanted to wear on and ready to go, he could hear the voices of everyone in the house exchanging pleasantries in the living room without him.  He raced down the stairs, thankfully for him, with shoes on this time, and zoomed into the room with the rest of them in time to see Ellen hugging Cas tightly.  Cas made eye contact with him and Dean chuckled.
“So you probably remember me from my High School Musical moment on the bus today”.  The group all chuckled and Dean instantly started to feel better.  Humor always made him less nervous.
That's when Dean's door was shoved open and Cas and Dean flew apart.  Cas blinked multiple times in surprise of where they had been and then looked at the floor and back at Dean.  Dean almost fell over.  Ellen stood at the doorway, her mouth parted slightly in her own shock before she shook her head quickly, trying to remind herself of why she had walked in in the first place.  She cleared her throat and put down the laundry basket filled with folded clothes down on the floor.  "I brought these up from the basement and washed them.  They're Dean's old clothes.  I noticed you were a little smaller than him so, I decided to bring you stuff from a few years ago so you weren't swimming." She smiled an awkward smile.  She looked at Dean apologetically before pivoting on her foot and exiting, leaving Dean's door open.
Dean could swear he heard Cas gasp as quiet as a mouse as another tear fell onto his cheek.  Cas pulled his bottom lip in between his teeth and sighed, his blue eyes almost looking silver with his tears surrounding them, and repeated the motion back to Dean.
"Only because you begged like a big giant baby," Dean giggled as he threw a balled up napkin at his friend.
Dean shrugged, "I guess I don't blame them.  If I had the chance to skip, I would too."
Finally, Cas picked his head of up Dean’s chest and looked down at him, his blue eyes twinkling in the bright sunlight.  His fingers were still lightly tracing the lines of Dean’s jacket as Cas grinned softly and muttered so softly that Dean almost didn’t hear, “I heard you call me baby ya know”
Castiel watched as Dean shoved his hard leather gloves back on his truly exquisite looking hands, and shifted his cowboy hat a little before winking at Castiel and leaving out the front door.
"It's about god damn time you showed your face 'roun here, boy."
Sorry, it's a pretty short one folks.
Gabriel just winked.
Cas was reading something, intently.  His brow was furrowed, and he wasn't looking up at all from the pages as his eyes darted back and forth rapidly.  He was leaning back in his chair casually though, radiating so much confidence in such a small action that Dean almost wanted to run in the opposite direction and just go home.  His attendance record could take one absence, right?  Dean quickly spun around out into the hallway.
It took them about an hour to get it all together and Gabe and Balthazar just laid down on the ground around the half way mark and just let the rest of the group do the work.  Chuck definitely saw them, but didn’t seem to want to argue with them enough to say anything about it.
"Hey, don't worry about it.  I've had to drag Benny's drunk and
They were standing at the door waiting for Bela's friend to let them in when the door flew open.  A guy with sandy blond hair opened it and his eyes widened and he grinned, "Bela!  Ruby!  Other dudes!"  Dean could tell he was under the influence.  He wasn't sure of what it was he was under the influence of just yet, maybe a mixture of things.  "I'm glad you made it!"
Dean shut off his screen and left with his coat in his hands after squirting himself a few times with his cologne to mask the alcohol coming out of his pores.  Thankfully it smelled worse than it felt.  Maybe he was getting too good at hangovers.
This is kind of a short one, and there isn't much story progression per say, but it provides a lot of insight and character information.  I'm sorry that I'm a little slow in my plot progression but, it feels more realistic to me when you get a chance to see these kinds of interactions unfold.  In my experience anyway, these types of things actually end up taking this long because people can't get out of their own way.  I understand though that it's frustrating to read through in a fic setting though. I appreciate your patience greatly, however, and I hope that you'll stick around to see it all unfold.
Gabriel coughed a few times in an attempt to recover from the blow and Baz had tried to hide his smile and laughter by folding his lips into his own mouth and looking out the window.  Dean carefully looked over at Cas, who was looking at the ceiling now, with a look on his face that said,
Suddenly, Castiel heard soft snickering coming from the bonfire.  His head jerked up, worried that he would find two homophobic assholes laughing at him and Dean.
Dean finally spoke, after what seemed like 50 years on the ground with Castiel, "My fathers", he breathed out.
Ellen crooked her head, "As in a confirmation sponsor?"
Cas blinked and then looked up to Dean, who putting his backpack down on the floor in front of the seat next to Castiel, and suddenly he looked mortified.  "Oh, it's you!  I am so sorry Dean, I didn't mean to be so rude.  I thought it was someone who was too nervous to ask me to move down or something."
Blondie leaned over his smaller friend's lap to whisper back at ACDC, "Cassie, would you please relax?  I know that it is medically impossible for you to remove the stick from your ass, but you need to liiive a little, beautiful."  Blondie dragged his hand against Cassie's jaw.
Castiel whipped his head up from his bag and glared at her for a minute.  That memory still stung.
"Eat me" Castiel responded, not yet lifting his head.
Dean softly treaded his fingertips across the ink on the index card and smiled like a giddy 13 year old.  Cas could have easily texted him, but instead he left a note.  How cute.  Dean decided to pick it up and put it in his nightstand drawer.  He didn't want Benny to come home and read it.  Maybe Benny had been there when Cas wrote it, but Dean quickly deflected that thought, not wanting it to ruin the moment.  That's when his phone started to ring.
Cas smiled sadly and let Dean help him up.  Cas stumbled once again, but managed to stay on his feet.  He was swaying as he patted down his pockets when he sighed, frustrated.  Dean looked at him in confusion before Cas explained, "I don't have my ID."  The realization hit Dean about why that was a problem.  He looked down at his watch, which read, 2:15am.
."  Dean mouthed the words to Cas dramatically from the table, trying to make Cas laugh, and he was successful.  Cas chuckled and continued to watch Dean as he moved closer to Cas.  Dean hated how cheesy he felt as he thought,
"Woah, woah there buddy" Dean said, putting his hand on Castiel's back as he chugged, "Careful with that thing"
Once it started to get late, Dean could tell that Cas was exhausted.  He knew Cas would be too polite to say he was going to bed when everyone else was still up, but Dean knew he needed to go to bed.  He stood up and walked over to Cas, putting his hand out in front of him and said, "Alright, champ, let's go get you set up upstairs."
When he turned into the kitchen, he found the intruder, standing with their back turned, looking through a pile of mail.  They were wearing a black hoodie and jeans, with the hood pulled up over their head.  Dean inched closer, his pulse quickening as he lifted the bat into swinging position.  The person turned as Dean was only about half a foot away from them.
“Sh, Dean.” Castiel said as he slipped down Dean’s zipper and looked up at Dean with sapphire eyes, “I’m gonna take care of you now.”
I feel like y'all need to know that this video is what inspired this fic....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzTgPcE7BZc
Benny rubbed his head and smiled up at Dean politely, "Alright, brother.  Have a great break."
"Is that so?" Castiel replied, glaring over at Dean, who's asshole grin was directed toward Castiel directly now.
Benny just looked between Dean in the panties, horror creeping across his face as he came the embarrassing realization of what was happening.  "Hey, I'm sorry, cher, I totally didn't realize that they had flown over there.  I was so focused on keeping it quiet since you were going to be leaving so early today-"
Dean's face darkened with crimson, both with embarrassment and internal panic.  Before Dean could respond or go into a full mental breakdown, Gabe decided to actually answer with some sincerity.
Cas stood up after taking his coat off in the seat, and reached up above their heads to put his backpack up in the cupboard for luggage.  Dean's eyes just happened to glance over at that moment, and caught the sliver of Castiel's torso peaking out from his shirt pulling up with the high reach of his arms.  Dean could see the line of dark fuzz trailing from his belly button to the waist of his dark blue jeans.  Dean could feel all of the saliva leave his mouth and his mouth parted slightly.  For a second he forgot to breath as he watched Castiel struggle to shove his backpack into the small space.  He was standing on the highest possible point of his tiptoes and the backpack was still trying to fall down on top of him.
Cas rolled his eyes and then looked at Gabriel, his expression searching for answers from his older brother.  Gabe put a hand on Cas's shoulder, "Honey, there is absolutely zero chance that he doesn't like you.  In fact, I thought that maybe you weren't into him and you might just be getting off on teasing the poor guy because of your lack of action at this point."
The two of them started to finally catch their breaths, their frenzy of giggles and laughter slowing down into small chuckles until the two of them were just breathing slowly and laying together on the cold wet ground.  If he were with anyone else, Dean might have been bothered by the dampness seeping in through his clothing, but with Cas resting on him like this, Dean could find it in him to be anything but content.
"Hey, sleepy" he said quietly enough into Dean's ear that only he could hear.  Chills ran down his back from the smoothness of Castiel's voice at that noise level, and lifted his head up to be met with Cas smiling softly.
Castiel didn't even look at his brother before his elbow jammed as hard as it possibly could into Gabriel's rib cage.  Dean's face was on fire.  This bus ride had only been going on for 5 minutes and they've already had a handful of uncomfortable moments.  How were they gonna last the full two hours?  Dean realized that it was unlike Gabe to make comments that blunt about the two of them in from of Cas.  He usually said those kinds of things to make Dean uncomfortable when they were alone.
Castiel always sat on the very end of the row, furthest away from Dean.  Dean was usually there first so he would just sit in any random seat, and then the group would find him and sit right beside him, but Cas never failed to sit as far away from Dean as possible.  Dean even tried to switch it up, and through him off guard by sitting at the end of the row, closest to the isle, and Cas
Wow.  Cas was already wasted.  Dean supposed that it made sense.  The bottle of tequila was about half way gone, and Dean probably only had about 1/4 of what had been drunk.
Sam shrugged, "Well, you and Jess both know how to do it, so why bother learning?"
Dean was happy that the first song wasn't overly sexual or romantic in nature, because he just wanted Cas to have fun, without any other possible meanings coming out.  This song did that.  Cas changed from swaying to moving his shoulders along as well, and Dean took the cue to use the dish towel like it was a cane in his dance number.  With that, Cas lifted the faucet of the sink and turned it around so the back of it was to himself and brought it to his mouth like it was a microphone, while at the same time, cleaning off the dish that he had just washed before passing it off to Dean.  The two of them continued to sing and dance as the song continued and lead to other songs on the playlist.  Dean could feel his heart growing by the minute.  His Cas was back.
The more Cas thought about Dean though, the more he thought about the possibility of the two of them being together.  Sure, he had always fantasized about it when he was with Dean and even when he was on his own, but he hadn't actually thought about it in a real way until the almost kiss that happened in Dean's room a few nights ago.  Then there was the time on the kitchen floor, and then of course, the moment that Cas had just walked away from.  There was an actual possibility now, and Cas wasn't sure what to do.  What if Dean just thought he was attractive and was looking for a hookup?  Cas had never done anything like that before, and Cas knew that doing something like that with Dean would be catastrophic considering the actual feelings that he had for Dean.  Pretending that they weren't real and allowing Dean to take him as a casual lover would be damaging to Cas, as much as he might want to give in.  What if Dean just felt bad for Cas because of what had happened with his dad and so he was just going along with Cas out of fear that he would upset him more?  Or, the worst possible option of them all, what if Dean actually liked Cas as Cas liked him?  Cas's giddy and soft expression was now twisted into a thoughtful and confused one.  He was still squatting amongst his belongings when he heard a voice call out to him from a couple feet away.
The program not only included the courses, but provided opportunities for community service and the week long retreat that are required before confirmation.  Reading about all of the stuff he had to do was making Dean less and less excited about it, and he was already dreading it the second he found out about it.  But, he loved his mama, and his mama loved Jesus, and his Mom, Mary, would want him to do this for Ellen.  Dean twisted his father's wedding band in his fingers before clicking on the enroll button and officially signing up for the pain.
" Balthazar asked Cas, glaring daggers.
Cas was laughing so hard it almost sounded like screeching, and maybe some of it was.  He flailed around under Dean, trying to wiggle his way out of Dean’s grip while simultaneously trying to shove Dean’s hands off of him.  Unfortunately for Cas, Dean was well versed in wrestling and he had a firm grip on Cas.  Dean demolished Sam every time, and Cas was way smaller than his little brother.  There was no way he’d get his way here.
Dean was surprised, "On a Sunday?  Don't you all have classes tomorrow?"
Dean took a deep breath and smiled before pulling Cas into him and whispering back, "Welcome to God Camp", and kissing him passionately.
Balthazar and Gabriel's laughter just got louder as Cas ran out to the hallway bathroom to vomit again.
Dean opened his mouth to say that he didn't see it, but instead he heard Bobby's voice come from the kitchen.  "Joanna Beth, do you really think it's wise to be cussing this close to leaving for church?"  Jo rolled her eyes in exasperation as he continued, "Anyway, your other heel is in here by the washer."  Jo's eyes lit up and she ran into the other room to find it.
P.S. Just a reminder that I actually went to God Camp as a teenager so, all the shit that they do here, I actually had to do with a bunch of my peers as an awkward 16 y/o (even the bus singing)
"  Cas slid his hand down Dean's cheek, to his neck, and then to his chest, "'
"Have you chosen a sponsor yet?" Sam chirped.
Before Dean could think another thought, Balthazar and Gabriel were both ungracefully climbing over their seats to come sit beside Dean.  Balthazar started stroking Dean's hand and Gabriel grabbed Dean's backpack and started to look through it.  He grabbed Dean's Anthropology text book and looked at it thoughtfully, "Shut up, we are not in the same class on Thursday!"
edit: hey so that note at the end was for chapter 1 and i can't get it to go away so idk y'all
This chapter is a little emotional guys.
Even though Dean figured that's what happened, hearing Cas say it, especially with that must pain in his voice, felt like someone had grabbed his heart with icy fingers.  Dean's hand curled into a fist and his knuckles turned white under the pressure Dean was putting on them.  "Where is he now?"
Dean still felt like a zombie when he walked into their religious ed classroom.  He looked around to the sea of depressed and zoned out expressions of his classmates and felt a little bit better that he was not the only one suffering.  He slinked up to his seat and rested his head on his desk until the rest of the crew made their way in and Cas tapped him on the shoulder.
Dean curled his dirty but strong fingers around a glass from the cabinet and brought it down in front of the faucet.  Castiel could feel his lips part and a small breath leave them as he watched Dean's adam's apple bob in his parched gulps.  Sweat was running down his neck and into the tip of his white tank top, which was also covered in dirt, with small pieces of hay sticking out in mismatched places.
Castiel was wearing a dark blue hoodie and jeans.  He was wearing matching blue converse and he had managed to scrunch himself up so that his book was in his knees, which were brought up against his chest all in one seat.  His hair was in its usual mess, but it was significantly matted down against his forehead today, its dark color and closeness to his eyes really bringing out the bright blue against his irises.  The book looked worn, like it had been read several times.  Cas had the front cover folded behind the rest of the book.
Continue to stay safe out there and as always, enjoy <3
Dean was instantly filled with fury.  Why was Cas black and blue?  What the hell happened?  Instead of answering, Dean just leaned forward and cupped Cas's face in his hand gently, careful not to hurt Cas further since he had gone for the side with the bruise.  He traced his thumb lightly on Cas's cheek bone before he uttered, "Who did this to you?", his tone hushed.
Dean shoved her off of him with a grin, "Dick".
"I don't even know what that means, so I'm gonna go ahead and say no." Dean replied, getting irritated by his lack of understanding.
Cas was still reading as intently as he had been the first time Dean had walked in, except there was a significant difference in how far he had gotten into the book.  Cas had gotten a lot in during those few minutes.  Dean was impressed.  He adjusted his shirt nervously and made his way up to the row and tried to think of something cool to say.  When he got up there, though, all he did was look at him.
With some spit rolling down Castiel, he was able to jack him more steadily, fisting him earnestly and sucking what he was sure would turn into bruises against Castiel’s neck.  Castiel was moaning and hissing like porn star and it was only making Dean impossibly harder.
, no no no no, Cas, seriously, no."  Balthazar looked flabbergasted.  Cas gave him a confused look.  Baz continued, "
Cas swallowed and his eyes filled with tears as he clenched his teeth and brought his hand to Dean's opposite cheek and stared for a minute.  "Damn right."
Castiel swallowed, eyes still wide, "I've never actually been to one of these before" he admitted, "I actually had no plans on coming until you said you wanted to come."
Dean patted her back and laughed at the state of his friend.  "How late were you up last night?", he asked.
Dean snorted and Castiel's face blushed in embarrassment.  Balthazar leaned back so the four of them could hear him and whispered, "Oh fuck, we're not gonna last long guys.", when Chuck cleared his throat obnoxiously loud to get him to stop talking.  He took the hint and looked around awkwardly before taking a huge gulp of coffee.
Yes, this is something we really did when I was at God Camp.
“You’re up, kiddo.” Chuck clarified.
Charlie sighed and looked up at Dean.  She put her highlighter down, "That's kind of a good point, man.  Why don't you go home and take a shower or something before religious ed?"
Finally, the chorus began, and all of Dean’s attempts at not getting emotional broke down and he felt his chest collapse on itself.  He managed to get the words out as tears streamed down his face.
Also just as a warning, I usually write from like 1-4 am because I'm stupid and what is sleep.  So if there's part that is weirdly written or doesn't make sense it's because I'm surviving off of one braincell like a caveman lol, so please let me know so I can fix it when I'm less tired.  That's also probably why I stopped when I did.  Like I said, a bitch has to sleep sometime.
All three of them laughed together for a while before they were finally able to calm down and breath normally again.  Finally, Gabe stood up and held his hand out to Castiel before standing him up.  He patted Cas on the should and said, "Be brave, brother.  Tell him how you feel at God camp."
Balthazar, who had taken his spot on the floor on the other side of Cas, reached his hand out to poke Castiel's side.  Cas flinched away from him and yelped at the jolt before Balthazar sternly said, "Say what you mean by that right this second."
Dean sighed and leaned the bat up against the kitchen wall, "I'm sorry, dude.  If I knew it was you, I would have been much less alarming about my presence."
Cassie looked up at him with remorse in his eyes, but still a hint of humor in them too.  It seemed like no matter how annoyed he was with them, he still thought they were pretty hilarious.
"Yes sir" he answered, and bounced over back over to his seat with a giddy grin.  Gabe reached across the space between them to high five Dean.  "That was awesome, dude."
Dean reached across to Cas quickly and threw an arm around him, shoving them both through the crowd that had seemed to double since they had arrived.  Dean trudged through to get to the door when he saw Bela and Ruby a few feet away from them.  Bela laughed and Ruby called over, "Oh no! Mother Theresa's gonna blow!"
Jess must have felt the change in his body and broke away from the hug, "Everything okay, buddy?"
So, I realized I accidentally said that the retreat was a week long in previous chapters.  I totally meant a weekend long.  They're usually the whole day Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday.  I went back and fixed it, but if you're reading as the chapters come out, I wanted to let you know that it was a mistake here so you weren't confused.  If you see the mistake anywhere else that I missed, please let me know! This is what happens when you only work on your writing from 1-4 in the morning.  We love trying to be coherent with little to no sleep.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and swallowed hard.  He felt Cas brush his thumb across his knuckles and whispered, “You got this baby” and pushed Dean forward.  He slowly made his way up to the picnic table and looked out upon the crowd staring up at him.
Dean snorted and walked over to Sam to help, "You would think after all these Sundays you would have learned how to tie a tie by now."
“Cas, oh my god, are you okay?”
, Cassie mouthed to Dean, and Dean just smiled at him and mouthed,
He shoved his tongue into Castiel’s mouth ungracefully.  Thankfully, Cas moaned into his mouth as a reply, clearly liking what Dean was doing, or he was just really good at faking it.  Dean was starting to feel a growing wet spot in Castiel’s underwear.  It was about everything he could do to not start grinding his pelvis into Cas and coming in his jeans.  Dean wanted to make this about Cas though.  Show Cas how much he meant it when he said he had loved him only a few minutes ago.
Dean hesitated as he started to walk toward the door.  There was a bright purple pair of panties that had been thrown in the corner of the room near the door.  Dean scrunched up his nose in disgust and confusion as he grabbed a pen from his back pack pocket to lift them from the ground.  He hadn't slept with anyone since the beginning of the semester, so he knew they weren't his responsibility.  They must have been from recently, because Dean was just noticing them for the first time.  How the hell did they get all the way over here?  Dean turned around and walked a few steps back towards Benny's bed with the pen still holding the panties up in the air and then dropped them on his friend's head.  Benny blinked his eyes open again and picked them up off of his face.
"Yeah, we heard Dean gave your little heart a startle." Hannah, poked her finger into his chest to punctuate her point.
The craziest part of all of this is that Dean was not a shy guy.  He never really felt uncomfortable talking to anyone in normal situations.  He was usually confident, even when he was trying to pick someone up.  He was a total flirt with everyone he was interested in, and very rarely folded in social situations.  Why was this giving him such a hard time?
Dean’s head snapped up and his eyes widened.  He felt Cas squeeze his hand and then heard the roar of Gabe’s laughter.  “W-wait what?”, Dean managed to stutter out.
Suddenly the music was cut off.  Balthazar and Gabriel were suddenly pulling the two of them over to the couches and chairs in the center of the common area and sitting them down with them.  "Cassie is blushing", Gabriel pointed out, "Baz look!"
After a few minutes, Castiel got up from his seat to go to the bathroom, letting go of Dean's hand gently.  Dean deflated a little bit, wanting it to return.  That is, until Cas leaned down before him and kissed him on the cheek before descending to the back of the bus.  Dean almost fell out of his chair.
"I'm sorry, Dean. I can disinvite her."
"Shall we play a game, bitches?" a cheery female voice comes over the intercom. Castiel blinks at the loudspeaker for a very long moment. He had steeled himself to sound casual when Dean would answer, now he's thrown off the rails.
"Yes. Thank you."
"We'll see," he deflects. He can practically feel that Dean is rolling his eyes. Castiel wets his lips. "There might be a small chance that we could have breakfast together in the future," he says as nonchalantly as he musters. He'd have to push his eating window to the morning and have dinner early, but that's a problem for future Castiel. He's way too excited about the news he learnt this morning from Nora.
"So, Garth wasn't free, huh, brother?" Benny breaks their silence, and his lips curl into a wide grin. Dean feels the urge to punch his old pal and wipe the smirk off his face. He was the one who drove Castiel away, just because he is a sore loser.
"I hate you," Dean calls after him.
He shakes Castiel awake before he exits the bus. The confused look on his face is worth a mint. Dean grins all the way to his apartment.
"Forget it! But that's just short-term accommodation, right?"
Castiel nods. "Will his health insurance pay for this?"
Dean's head falls on Castiel's shoulder. He holds him there, no words needed. It's been an exhausting week for both of them.
Dean groans and slumps on the sofa. "I'm so sorry, Sam. I didn't mean to crash your birthday."
She hits Dean with the tea towel. "And you didn't say a thing? Here I am, still worrying about you after…" she trails off and glances at Castiel.
shirt. The tears start flowing again.
Dean makes a surprised noise at the back of his throat, and Castiel chuckles. It sounds appropriate, nearly warm. He presses a last kiss on Dean's forehead and settles down between his legs.
Dean chuckles. "Picking you up. It's past six." Castiel's lips fall into a silent 'o'. "Ready to go?"
"No! No," Castiel chuckles. "Nora got promoted to some important-sounding administrative thing. And she's asking around who of us might want to take her place."
Jo scrutinises Dean, and he squirms under her gaze, although he tries hard to cover it up with a wide grin. But he doesn't fool Castiel. And Jo neither, as it seems.
Castiel blinks several times, then shakes his head. Is Dean asking him out? No. It's just an evening with friends. But still. They are all strangers, and he knows Dean for 48 hours now. He doesn't seem strange to him, although there might be anger thrumming under the surface. It spills out of him when things go wrong. But Dean has himself tightly under control. It's more due to Castiel's experience that he senses the small tendrils that otherwise might go unnoticed.
"I like men who earn their money with honest work," Mr Novak states, giving a man with blond, shoulder-long hair a stern look. Dean senses that it's less a compliment directed at him, more a disguised scolding for the other man. But the blond looks unfazed. Stoicism seems to run in the family.
"Of course, you did."
," Gabriel snickers, already tipsy. Castiel turns his gaze down and clenches his jaw at that.
He feels Dean's eyes on him in every spare second, but the night is busy, and they both are working through their breaks until Jody comes for the shift changeover, and Lisa and Dean play their usual game of chicken to avoid running into each other.
His phone beeps, and he looks at Lisa's message, a video of Ben throwing a touchdown. He sends back a thumbs up. It doesn't hurt as much as it used to just a few weeks ago. But the morning shift is already taken, and he doubts that Judy will give it up. She has a bunch of teens at home to bring through puberty.
"Are you sure? Because it feels like we're drifting apart instead of getting closer." Silence spreads between them for a while until Dean sighs. "I've been sitting here for the last hour, ready to pick up something at a 24/7."
Dean seems so free after having a label for who he is. He even came out to Sam and Rowena, who were wonderfully supportive. It looks so easy, and still, Castiel can't follow his example. How can one be proud of lacking emotions? He was always told that he was robotic. He had always been angry back then, but the others were probably right.
Castiel nods in understanding. "Let's get our Sunday cuddles."
Castiel pulls himself up, his hands slightly trembling when he reaches out to touch Dean's arm. At least, his boyfriend doesn't flinch away from him. A spark of hope blooms in Castiel's chest, but he pushes it to the side.
"If you keep on doing this, I'll come," Castiel pants above him, and Dean smirks around his cock.
"Allies?"
"She's way out of his league," he hears himself say, not knowing where this is even coming from.
is more than satisfying," Dean retorts, never shying away from a playful banter.
Dean is proud that he is so disciplined. He didn't miss a single night of work despite feeling shitty most of the time. It's not a physical need so much anymore, more the distress of finding other, healthier habits when he usually would have disappeared into the staff room and taken a slug of booze. Castiel takes over some of his tasks at work, everything that doesn't keep Dean's mind and hands busy, basically. And in the low traffic times, he kisses him behind the slushy machine, just to keep him occupied. It's not that Dean doesn't notice. He simply accepts the help in silence. That alone is hard work. Dean's not used to letting other people take care of him.
"I'm not sure if I agree. It always felt like something else I couldn't control. And my partners always thought I was aroused by them, even though it just may have been too tight jeans or something." Castiel breathes a sigh. "I had a boyfriend whom I tried to explain to that I don't enjoy sex the way he does, and he used my erections against me. I hated that my body betrayed me."
Dean stares into blue eyes for a long moment, then cards his hands through Castiel's hair and shakes his head. "You're perfect."
As if he wouldn't know already what a fucking freak he is. His ex had made that pretty clear before he collected his belongings, moved out of Castiel's apartment, and in with his new boyfriend.
His boyfriend greets him with a kiss that takes Castiel's breath away. Dean is such a good kisser, and he knows it, judging by the smug grin on his face. "Missed me, sweetheart?"
No, he can't talk about that with her. She's not his therapist. And that man only prescribes him pills against his anxiety. Pills from which Dean doesn't know anything. Just like about his living situation or the fact that Castiel is broken beyond repair, that what they are doing right now is basically everything he feels comfortable with in bed.
Castiel's mouth falls agape. "How—?"
Castiel chuckles softly and hums in agreement. "But first, maybe we should go get some sleep?"
Castiel takes a sip of his coffee. "And you thought I would, too?"
"Scrambled eggs with bacon okay?"
Castiel frowns at that. "I don't know why Dean would—oh."
Usually, Castiel would be relieved. He doesn't like it when people stand too close or drop innuendoes. But Dean pulls him into his orbit, literally. The man already called him out twice for not keeping his personal space. But it's difficult not to draw closer when the shop is empty and every single job is done.
Dean gets up and kisses him goodbye once more. "No," Castiel says, still drowsy. "I'll see you home."
"But you're cooking for me all the time." Dean grabs his hand. "Let me do this for you."
"Starting tomorrow, Your Highness! Loser takes the other out to Giovanni's."
There is no answer, and Dean closes his eyes. This is it. If he can't even keep Castiel—the man who has been in love with him for a decade and still didn't leave his side—then lasting love will never find him.
What would his mother say if she saw him now?
"Hey," Dean says and pulls him into a hug. "Your body is perfect as it is. You don't have to lose anything. If it happens—fine. But you're close to your normal BMI. And Charlie said the whole formula is shit anyway. You're healthier looking. You're moving a lot. That's more important than a number on the scale."
He thinks of the night before when he got ready for his second shift. He brushed his teeth and looked at himself in the mirror, already dressed in the blue vest. He had smiled at himself until he felt his mood rising. It had taken him less time than usual. Probably the filled stomach. Not being hungry for once was rather nice. He shouldn't criticise Dean's eating habits. Eating food from a dumpster isn't safe and healthy either.
Dean imitates her, his Scottish accent so far off that he ends up laughing about himself. Castiel joins in. Dean is mesmerised by the unfamiliar sound, by the wrinkles around Castiel's eyes and the cute way he crinkles his nose.
"We're not working until Sunday," Dean says and rolls his eyes, regretting it immediately. Castiel was right. He isn't fine. His head is aching, and the world moves a little too fast for his liking.
Dean white-knuckles the steering wheel. "Nah. We're adults. I guess she's ready to be around me again. Which is good."
It's still hard to believe that this man wants to be his, saw his very soul and fell in love with it. Dean still struggles, but he's tired of running away from himself, from love in the fear of losing it. Castiel is his best friend and the third love of his life. Hopefully the last.
"Still in love with you, buddy."
Dean frowns and opens his mouth but thinks better of it. "Good night, Cass. Enjoy your night off. See ya tomorrow."
"I—I'd understand if you wanted to break up with me."
Castiel nods. "It's wide open for the holidays," he replies. He saves the nervous swallow until Hannah and Dean have turned to the trunk to get out their luggage. These are going to be long torturous two days.
Castiel shrugs. "I like having my plushies here. I like looking at them when we cuddle."
All three men laugh.
Castiel loved the little baby Yoda right from the start. He likes everything soft, cute, and wholesome, no matter how often Dean teases him for being like this. Castiel might be a battle-tested soldier, but he's also a softie. Especially when it comes to Dean.
"You didn't!?" he snorts.
"Hey, man. How're you doing?"
would change. But no. He didn't enjoy sex with men either—neither vanilla nor rough nor kinky. He tried it all, mostly to please his partners. But it wasn't enough.
Castiel is up from his chair in a split second. "Let me talk to him first. Did he try to steal something?" Lisa shakes her head. "Alright."
Yes, their circles have widened over time, with Jody and the girls, Charlie and Dorothy. Still, happiness isn't really part of their lives. They might get glimpses of it, but…
Castiel licks his dry lips. "Tea is great. Coffee gives me heartburn." He takes the offered mug and smells the fresh scent of peppermint and lemon. "Never thought you to be someone having tea in the cupboard."
Dean chuckles. After work, he could always bounce off the walls, too hyped up to go to bed for hours. "I hope you're not becoming an insomniac like me, man. I'm too old for this shit," he says in his best Roger Murtaugh impersonation.
"Kevin forgot to give them to me. He brought them around when I called him."
Maybe Dean is an asshole, but he has pulled Sam from the edge too many times to count. This is too good to be true. Happiness doesn't find a Winchester. Not in his experience.
"You're kidding!" Dean laughs. Castiel loves that he never sounds as if he were laughing at him, although he probably does. "Are you working Friday night?"
"I'm talking about you throwing your lunch away!" Dean snaps. Castiel gapes at him, cheeks turning crimson in an instant. 'Good,' Dean thinks. He deserves that after lying out of his ass.
"That's all I ask of you. Let's sleep. Tomorrow will be another long day."
Charlie nods and pulls Castiel in a tight hug that he doesn't know how to react to adequately. But it doesn't matter, they hold each other up for a long moment until Sam rings the bell and helps Castiel to struggle Dean into sweatpants and a shirt.
She quizzes Castiel about his upbringing, family, and career. The others join in the questioning, and Castiel feels anxiety crawling up his spine, threatening to spread into every part of his body.
He's a bit nervous about Dean finding out that he didn't throw the food away. He would die of shame for sure. But he hides the backpack in the reefer in the back of the shop after restocking the fridges in the front. No reason for Dean to open it. Castiel should be safe until he'll go off duty. He can't wait for his breakfast. His stomach is already growling.
Castiel sits up and stares at him with widened eyes and swollen lips. He's so damn beautiful and everything Dean ever dreamt of.
His boyfriend simply smirks. "You're right, angel. You deserve your own name."
"Told you that we sometimes ran out of money. Hustling pool wasn't always successful, so I turned tricks, now and then. As I said. I'm a bad boy, doing illegal stuff." He chuckles. It sounds hollow.
Castiel frowns. Even he knows that this was weird, but his analytical mind is interrupted by everyone getting up and moving to the dining table where the game is already set up.
"Um, yeah. Just give me a minute to finish this and talk to the employees from the evening shift."
"Because…" Dean starts, but trails off.
Dean chuckles as he cleans up the mess he made. "Yeah, yeah. Don't get too sappy on me. That's just the wedding getting to ya."
"I haven't been on the front, really. Nora wasn't as good with the paperwork as I expected her to be."
"Was it so obvious?"
"Hi! How're ya doin'?"
Castiel breathes a sigh. It's too late for such a conversation. Or too early. "Listen, Dean, hang up, and tell me this when you're sober, okay? You're wasted and probably won't remember a word come tomorrow."
She puts a hand on his arm. "I don't want you to hide. I went with you to pride, didn't I? I'm not ashamed of you. I didn't understand then that it was no different to being straight or bi. But I do now. If you can forgive me, maybe we could start over again?"
He looks back at the bride and groom. Sam presses a kiss into Rowena's hair. From afar, they are a cute couple with the difference in height and the unconventional age gap.
"I didn't mean to. It just happened." Castiel nods again.
Castiel shakes his head. "Earlier or later I might have told him myself. I mean, Charlie already knew. I would have liked to do it myself, though."
Castiel stares at her.
"He had the impression that I was your roommate."
Dean turns to the bearded man that just saved his boyfriend's ass. He tries to place who this person might be. His British cousin, Crowley, maybe?
Castiel's lips twitch into a smile. "Nope. That would be you."
Castiel takes Dean in—his slumped shoulders, the tightness around his eyes, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jeans. But he mustn't concede. Not this time.
He takes a deep breath before he returns to the living space, where six pairs of eyes look at him expectantly.
"Crying like the big brother, who raised a wonderful man and has to let him go to live his own life. Crying like a lonely man, who hasn't been touched intimately for ages."
The group chats for a while. Castiel tries to follow their conversations, but he doesn't know the people or events they are talking about, so he mainly enjoys the accidental touches between him and Dean.
Castiel furrows his brow. "What are you talking about, Dean?"
Jo snorts at the formal language. "Be right back with your burgers. Have fun guys."
Castiel smiles at him. "Good." He closes the till and walks over to Jack, who is restocking the chocolate display. "Hey, Jack. How was your first shift?"
"I know," she says and pulls him into a side hug. "I know. And he does, too. Just sleep over it. Tomorrow's a new day."
"We should buy you a winter coat, angel."
"Mmh. Bees are fascinating creatures. I used to have a—"
Castiel's voice pushes Dean over the edge. He lets out a strangled moan. His ears are ringing from the effort to keep the noises in. He's not sure how successful he was.
Castiel cups his cheeks and brushes the tears away. The gesture is so tender that Dean cries only harder. He loves Castiel's tenderness, the way he touches him as if he were precious. With Castiel, he could be soft, and knew it was nothing to be ashamed of but welcomed with a smile.
"I'm missing you, Dean. I know, I messed up. This… I took something beautiful and destroyed it."
Dean stares at her for a long moment. "Nah, I'm sure he'll drop it. It simply gives him a sense of control. That's all."
," he grunts.
Dean chuckles. "I love you, man. That puts you in the top 10 of my people-to-be-worried-about list. No, but serious, Cass. I'm okay with you fasting. But I think you should be more flexible about it, maybe put a cheat day in it now and then, play with the eating window. I get that you wanna be good to your body, but that ain't the right way. You tend to do things with all your heart. And that's awesome. But if you're hiding that you're not eating? Sounds like a red flag to me."
She slumps down onto the couch next to him. "It's just labour pains. You two never really had the rosy phase at the beginning of your relationship. You have to figure yourself out while getting to know each other. But you'll get there."
Castiel smiles shyly. "So. You want to repeat what you said last night or…?"
But he promised Dean. He needs to prove to his boyfriend that his diet isn't getting out of hand, that he can be normal for him, at least on a holiday. It reminds him of all the Novak family dinners when he was asked to stay quiet about his private life, or the holidays spent with his boyfriends' families.
Dean has never owned so many things before. Even in his year with Lisa. He had always known that he was only a guest in her life. He lived in her house, loved her son, mowed her lawn. Maybe that would have changed over time. Maybe a year is simply not enough to create an 'ours' from 'mine' and 'yours'.
He doesn't understand why, but he trusts Dean, feels a connection. And that in itself is a miracle. Castiel has met his fair share of people, who abused his dire straits. A healthy meal, a hot shower, and a warm bed often came at a price. And he was willing to pay it now and then, to feel human again between the hunger and the cold and the filth.
"You're forgiven. Now leave it behind, okay? You weren't fully yourself."
"Thanks for inviting me. I really appreciate your kindness."
"Labour Day tradition. And now that Baby's up and running, it'll be the best in years," Dean proclaims. Castiel raises a questioning eyebrow.
Dean finds Castiel on his desk, the laptop screen mirroring in his glasses. "Can we talk?"
Dean raises his eyebrows. "You really got the full rich kid experience." He slumps down next to Castiel.
"What are you? Huggy Bear?"
"Just have the runs. I'm good," he lies. Castiel seems to swallow it.
A word and a blow. No pun intended.
"Yes. First time that both of us were single." He puts a burger on her bun and hands her plate over.
He takes the offered hand and Castiel's smile grows wider, just like Dean's heart. Castiel pulls him slowly into his arms, lets him settle against him, and rewards Dean's head leant against his own with a gentle brush over his back.
Castiel's heart is racing against his ribs. He knows that he'll have to address his past earlier or later. 'Band-aid off,' he decides.
Dean cautiously kicks the door to his bedroom open and enjoys the view welcoming him. Castiel looks so soft in his sleep, the ever-existing frown on his forehead relaxed, his nose pressed into Dean's cushion, probably searching for his scent. The sight makes Dean's heart ache in the best ways. God, he had forgotten how beautiful and precious these little moments are.
He feels Charlie's lips in his hair, pressing a tender kiss into it. That's usually his job. He's the older one, the comforter, the big brother she never had. He really fucked this up if the roles are reversed like this. Why did he open his stupid mouth?
Whenever Dean uses words like this, he isn't sure if he means them like any other person or if it's just a set phrase. Even after three months together, he still doesn't understand Dean's relation to sexual attraction properly. His boyfriend most definitely experiences more in that department than Castiel, which isn't hard as he feels absolutely nothing of the sort.
It still feels strange to say and think that. But this is their house. Castiel's and his. Fully furnished, a back garden with a bee-friendly meadow, and a huge garage at the front for Baby and whatever eco-friendly monstrosity his partner will be able to talk him into.
Too much has happened in the last 48 hours, and he's still trying to catch up, despite the heaviness of his eyelids and the weariness of his muscles.
He takes the pills and swallows them. He can't even remember how they got home. He hasn't been wasted like that in years. Why did he shoot himself off like that?
"Cass," he breathes, voice hoarse and small.
These damn green eyes! Castiel doesn't understand it himself, but something about Dean makes him want to do stupid things. Him! A person who doesn't even know where to sit in a group of people he barely knows without breaking some unspoken rules. Not sober, at least.
Castiel's hair, so neatly styled when they started work, is a beautiful mess now, and the five o'clock shadow framing his jaw looks good on him. Dean sighs. The first person catching his eye since Lisa and it's a weird, dorky, little guy, who acts as if he had just fallen from the sky and doesn't get Dean's brilliant jokes. What is wrong with him? Not that he would start anything with a colleague again. Or anybody, really. He has learnt his lesson.
"I didn't, Castiel. I said I was surprised that she went for someone younger. That's all."
"Mmh, you?" Dean answers quickly. He doesn't dare look at Castiel. It's pathetic, but he so wants him to want it, too.
"You can, if you'll do the dishes," he retorts.
"He's okay."
He takes a deep, unsteady breath. "I don't want sex."
Castiel gives him a lopsided smile. "You're well prepared."
But Dean pinches him in his butt, tells him that he looks devastatingly handsome, and rutted against him more than once in his sleep. Maybe Dean
Castiel looks at Dean who motions him to get out of his sweater before he leaves for a moment, just to return with a measuring tape.
“I didn’t know myself, until today. I was as surprised as you,” he manged to choke out. Lucifer raised his eyebrows, not fully believing the words that had left his brother's mouth.
“Why do you spend so much time at this well?” Dean asked, ducking his head, “I don’t think you’ve ever said.
Dean didn’t want to reply. He just wanted to focus on getting back to the house.
“Yes, you do.”
Love, Leah <3
“Okay but remember what we said?” Dean added.
Castiel just kept running. His panting loud. His legs aching. He ran and ran until there was no longer any path left and he just kept going until he reached a tree stump. It looked like it had belonged to an ancient oak tree. Castiel made his way towards it, resting his hands on one of the many visible rings. He paused for a breather, almost choking on his own salvia, remaining on lookout to see if whatever was chasing him had followed. Luckily, he couldn’t see anything suspicious and decided he could give himself a few extra minutes to catch his breath and figure out where he had to go from his current location to reach the house Dean had told him about.
Cas glanced out of the window beside them. The sun shone through onto the side of his face. His ocean blue eyes glimmered as they reflected the light and Dean noticed one of Cas’s curls had fallen onto his forehead. Dean sat back admiring his friend. Watching as the thoughts whirred through Cas’s head. He’d often done this, just observed Cas from a far. He didn’t know why he did it but he could never stop himself from doing so, every now and then his eyes would just linger on his best friend for longer than they probably should. Dean kept his focus on him until Cas promptly turned his head back and Dean in turn had to awkwardly look away.
His words were blunt and dry, even though he hadn’t intended them to be. Castiel was just nervous. Lucifer could still be lurking around any corner.
Cas hadn’t yet realised how seriously she was taking this ‘get Sam and Eileen together mission’ but it was clearly stressing her out. Eileen and Sam just watched on, slightly confused by Charlie’s outburst. Cas began to wonder how Charlie would take the ‘news’ about him and Dean, and even how she’d react if it was ever revealed that it wasn’t real. But all he could do was think of these scenarios because the plan was already in motion and he had no time to back out. The door to the restaurant had opened behind them and a gust of wind blew inside.
Ah, we're here at the final chapter!
“Thank you,” he said, “Thank you so much.”
“Want to know a secret?” he asked, tilting his head, “We are standing by a Wishing Well.”
“Just get everybody to come now,” he called back, “Hunts over, they need to come back home.”
“Here he is,” he said as Dean entered, instantly holding his arms out for the wooden box. Dean heaved out and reluctantly handed it over to him. Lucifer raised his eyebrows at Dean, who was once again attempting to avoid any eye contact.
“Where’s she gone?” Cas asked, raising an eyebrow, gesturing to where the girl had been before.
Dean ducked away, unsure how to approach the subject.
Cas didn’t know what to reply- how to reply. This was the second time Dean was proposing they ‘fake date’ and this time he was completely sober. Cas didn’t know what to think. Or why he was thinking at all. Why was he even considering this? Should he be considering it?
“I wish you well, Mr Winchester,” Lucifer said, taking another sip from his wine glass. Dean stood up, out of the chair, and hastily made his way towards the door. He needed to get out of the room fast, any longer and it would start becoming hard to breathe. Dean lifted his hand towards the door handle.
Castiel waited a few moments before speaking again.
The sun began to peer through a gap in the curtains and the birds were singing a cheery, early morning song. Castiel stretched his arms up above his head before slowly opening and rubbing his eyes. For a moment he had forgotten where he even was, until the memories of yesterday came crashing back too him. He groaned, realising he'd fallen asleep for longer than he had intended too, before opening his eyes.
Cas could practically here Charlie wink at him down then phone and laughed.
At this admission Castiel raised his eyebrows. Dean had never told him where he lived before and honesty, Castiel had never really thought about it either. The concept of Dean living in a cottage in the woods, probably alone, was rather intriguing to him. Especially as this was often a scenario he had dreamt of for himself. Spending his time in a vintage house, somewhere lost and out of reach. Living amongst the trees, with the various creatures that resided in the forest as his neighbours. Despite Dean being a hunter, this wasn’t how Castiel had expected him to live. He wanted to make a joke about it, or comment on it, in an attempt to make Dean laugh, but he knew with the situation they were in that it was not the time nor place.
“Dean?” he questioned, but Dean didn’t stop until they reached a specific spot. It was a fork in the road. If you went one way the path led you straight back to the Village and Castle, the other led you deep into the woods. It was a barren route, not often used by the villagers. The shrubs and trees nearby it had become overgrown and it wasn’t well lit or labelled. Take this path and you were more than likely to get lost-unless somehow you knew the way.
Castiel shrugged his shoulders and Dean nodded attentively before letting out a small laugh.
“I’m always here for you, Cas.”
“Wow, I didn’t see that coming...I thought he’d...” she paused, “I thought he was over that and has moved on...”
Castiel now held the apple between both his hands and was staring at it with full intent. He was so focused on the apple that he didn’t notice the maniacal grin spreading across the senior’s face. The voice in Castiel’s head was now screaming at him to stop but before he even realised what he was doing he brought the apple closer to his lips. If the man was telling the truth all he had to do was make a simple wish. He knew what he wanted; it was something he also knew would never actually happen. Something he could never have. But if the apple was magic then maybe...maybe his wish could finally come true.
Whilst their three friends began debating about when ‘Dean and Cas had happened,’ Dean tapped Cas shin with his foot to get his attention. Cas turned to see a smile spread across Dean’s face. He mouthed ‘good job’ to him before winking and turning away. Dean seemed to be good at keeping his cool in this situation and seemed perfectly able to lie to their friends. Cas, on the other hand, didn’t and was worried about when he’d crack. He didn’t really like lying to them. He felt bad. The only weight off his shoulders was that they’d never have to know the truth because in a month it’d be over. Dean would have Lisa and they could both pretend it had never happened. Dean must’ve sensed that Cas was anxious, as he placed a supportive hand on the top of his thigh.
Poor Dean...He's now a man on a mission.
The truth that it was nowhere near Castiel’s heart. It wasn’t even a human heart; it was one from a wild pig which he’d gruesomely had to cut out in the middle of the forest. He could still hear the pig's squeals and there was a twinge of guilt in his stomach. Dean Winchester was a hunter, he had been all his life and yet this was the first time he was doubting his profession. Maybe it was because of the magnitude of what he had to pull off. Or the fact Dean Winchester knew he wasn’t a murderer and yet he had to pretend to the King that he had killed his best friend.
“You going to be okay?” Dean asked, lingering in the doorway, “I could...I could stay with you, if you want?”
“Compliments to the chefs!” He announced after a few mouthfuls. He looked up and winked at Donna and Jody, causing everyone to cheer. Castiel joined in because it felt right. He snook a glance at Dean who seemed much more relaxed and at ease too. Everything felt right.
“Listen Cas, you should do whatever you think is best. Whatever feels right for you. Listen to your head, not your heart. But Dean’s your best friend, I highly doubt he wants to use you, I promise.” Anael said her hand hovering between her head and heart to signal what she meant. She flashed him a supportive smile, which Cas couldn’t reciprocate.
“Looks like you managed to get here then,” Dean teased, pulling away from the hug, “In one piece.”
Charlie’s face changed instantly, her mouth opened wide and her eyes flashing with disbelief.
Lucifer slowly pulled open the lid of the box and his grin widened once he saw what lay inside. A red and bloody heart. One which he believed to be Castiel’s.
Thanks for reading,
Cas looked back, not sure whether Dean was being serious or deadpanning him.
“You need to run. You need to hide,” Dean finally announced. Castiel’s expression instantly changing to something between confusion and horror.
Castiel chuckled at Dean’s comment before humming in agreement. They stayed there, losing track of time, gazing up at the stars. Castiel, the young Prince, and Dean, the hunter, holding onto each tightly. Making up for lost time. So lost in the moment, they’d forgotten they weren’t exactly alone until Sam and Charlie decided sneak off and leave them be.
“Crowley,” the man responded, “I want to thank you for saving me.”
“Well, I don’t think I’d be awake right now if I didn’t,” Castiel confessed, “I always have. I just thought I could never have you.”
They took a moment, just the two of them, in silence. Their breathing in tandem, their hands intertwined. Dean pressed another chaste kiss against Castiel’s lips.
Lucifer mulled over his suggestion for a minute before nodding.
As long as Lucifer didn’t pick up on his coup.
Cas couldn’t understand why Dean had done it, nor did he really want to know. Deep down he knew the most likely scenario was it had been done in an attempt to make Lisa jealous. Dean often didn’t think straight when he was intoxicated and this was most likely one of them situations. Cas could recall a time from when the two of them were younger, and they’d both found Mary Winchester’s whisky cabinet. They had managed to get so drunk that the whole night was a blur. Mary had found them upside down in the living room, both complaining about the worst headaches they had ever head. But the most embarrassing part was finding out on Monday that they’d somehow prank called their teacher and said some things they deeply regretted now. Apparently it had been Dean's idea and he had taken most of the heat for it, but Cas couldn't say if that was true or not, he couldn't remember anything from that night. It was the first and last time Cas had ever drunken alcohol, and he'd sworn to be sober ever since.
Dean swallowed hard; his words harsh and loud. He was trying so hard to hold back any signs of emotions.
Eileen and Charlie left together, with Charlie secretly giving a Dean and Cas a thumbs up, a smile beaming from ear to ear, she hoped and believed Dean’s encouragement would work. The plan was in motion. Sam was going to take a ride home with Dean and Cas, but hopped into the back seat of the impala without saying a sound. Cas presumed he was mad at Dean for what he’d revealed in the diner. Cas sat shotgun, beside Dean, and watched as Dean observed Sam in his rear mirror. Sam had a blank look on his face and seemed to be deep in thought over something. Dean stared the car engine with a roar, and turned to Cas before once again mouthing- ‘good job.’
“You’re obsessed with cleaning that,” she said, as she sat down opposite him, almost tutting.
“Anyways...we should catch up. You can tell me about what I’ve missed round here whilst I was gone and I’ll tell you some of my amazing hunting stories,” Dean stopped, “If that’s cool with you, Your Highness?”
“Help me open the door,” he grunted back.
Dean was stood at the bar as expected. Next to him stood shorter woman, she was laughing almost hysterically at something dumb Dean had probably said. Dean had a wide grin spread across his face and his eyes were almost fixed on the girl in front of him. Lisa.
“Yes, I’m sorry about that,” Dean started, moving so he was in front of Cas, therefore making eye contact inevitable, “But I need a favour.”
Castiel was left alone, again, at the table bewildered. He sighed and decided to finish his soup. He didn’t want a princess. And he didn’t need a Prince not right now, and even if he did, he knew what he wanted was something he could never have.
He glanced back at Charlie and Sam, who watched on confused but a glimmer of hope in their eyes. Dean’s shoulders dropped and he let out a heavy exhale. His gaze fell on Castiel and the corner of his mouth upturned. Dean placed a hand beside Castiel’s head and closed his eyes.
“You can have me.”
I'm not entirely pleased with how this chapter plays out but at least Lucifer is gone! I started to show some of Dean's grief in this chapter but they'll definitely be more in the next one as he starts to accept the situation...
Dean had expected a coy answer like that and just nodded once more, before reaching into the pocket of his pants and pulling out two silver pieces. He placed one in the palm of his own hand whilst carefully reaching out to hand Castiel the other one. Castiel looked up at Dean, before reaching forwards and taking the coin from between his fingers. Their hands brushed against each other, though they maintained an intense eye contact.
Dean pulled away from the hug and started to fiddle with the sleeves of his shirt. Sam looked down at his brother, he knew Dean was hurting and he wanted to help but nothing he could say or do would change the situation.
Time felt like it stopped when Dean reached the house.
Love Leah <3
Thanks for reading,
“It won’t?”
“Now if you’ll excuse us, me and Cassie need to talk.”
“Oh, Crowley,” Lucifer sighed, “It’s not what I’m going to do.”
Dean gulped, which Lucifer took as an invitation to continue on. He rubbed his fingers around the lid of the box, tracing around the spirals.
“I don’t need to,” Castiel replied, “I’ve already got everything I could want and need. A family. A home. You. Maybe I was wrong...to be loved and to have love...maybe if you find the right person, the right group of people...that love overpowers all.”
Crowley watched on as this continued for a few minutes, as Lucifer went from his pacing to flickering through the amass of books lying on his table top. He was focused and searching for something specific, Crowley daren’t ask a single question. He did not want to be involved in Lucifer’s plot, nor did he want to incriminate Castiel even more.
Both boys burst into hysterics. Dean throwing his head back and laughing more than Cas had seen him do so in a while. His comeback hadn’t even been that funny but it was nice to see Dean like this and to be spending time with him. Cas wouldn’t admit it but he had missed it being just them and now he’d be spending a lot more one on one time with Dean in the future.
Sam and Eileen replied almost in tandem. With Eileen explaining how she presumed she was going with Charlie, as friends, without a date and Sam saying he wasn’t even sure if he was going to go. Their hands almost moving in tandem. They both looked down instantly, embarrassed, when they noticed they’d answered so in sync.
The group ate their meals in pretty much silence. Charlie kept flickering her eyes towards Dean and Cas, as she still tried to wrap her heard around ‘them’. The only time anyone spoke whilst eating was to laugh at Sam, who had just posted the most cringeworthy and cheesy Instagram post and caption ever. Something about how his meal (pancakes that were covered in more fruit than Dean had ever eaten in his life) were the only things here that were sweeter than him. Dean decided to keep some comments to himself.
“Would you like some?”
“I need a drink,” he repeated, before sauntering off.
“It’s Dean. Of course, he’ll be fine.”
“Yes...he...I...” Dean stumbled over his words; he didn’t want to admit it but he also didn’t want to believe whatever lie Crowley was trying to tell, “Yes he is. I’ve seen him. I found him. I can’t get the image out of my head.”
Castiel whistled whilst he worked. Washing the pots and pans until they glimmered. Hanging the clothes up on pegs around the room and storing anything that seemed out of place in a grand wooden chest that sat by the door. By the time he was done he felt rather exhausted. Castiel fell back on a chair almost breathless. He pulled off his royal blue jacket and hung it on the back. It was quite dirty after his adventure and he’d have to clean it when he had the time. Castiel had positioned the small wooden chair he had sat on so that he could look out of the window. So, he could have an inkling of when Dean was back. The sky outside was almost pitch black and a few stars sparkled in the deep night. Stars were another thing Castiel had always been mesmerised by. The way they shone so brightly and lit up the night sky. Constellations making pretty patterns. He’d learnt that the stars could be used as a guide to lead someone home. He wondered if Dean was following them.
He raised a hand towards the birds to bid them farewell, making sure he did it carefully so he didn't startle them. Castiel then turned and ran out of the courtyard gates heading straight towards the town.
Lucifer's spell is quoted from the Disney Snow white movie, I just had to adapt it to suit a transformation into an old man over an old woman.
“Where’s Dean, by the way?” She pushed herself onto her tiptoes and began to crane her neck around the room.
The mirror shook slightly against the wall as this alleged revelation shocked Crowley.
Castiel and Dean had been friends since they were young. It was rare for a Prince and a hunter to be so close, and his brother Lucifer definitely frowned upon it, but Dean had been the only child Castiel had ever been in contact with at the time they met. He had found Dean interesting and mysterious. Someone who didn’t live in the village exactly but still worked for the King. A boy who would go missing for weeks on end, but then arrive at the castle covered in cuts and bruises with the most intriguing stories to tell him. Wild adventures that Castiel could only dream of. Dean had said one day he’d take Castiel with him, if he wanted to go. And he did. Castiel wanted to go on a hunt, an adventure with Dean and the other hunters more than anything, but he knew he couldn’t. It was too dangerous for a Prince. It wasn’t allowed. Castiel wasn’t allowed to leave the safe walls of the village. He could only imagine the meadows, rivers and forests that were out there. The blissful peace of nature.
For a moment, the sensation was amazing. The man had been right it really was the best apple he had ever tasted. Castiel swallowed his first bite, smiling, and was ready to take another when the world started to go blurry. His head started to pound and he felt slightly dizzy. Things were spinning and his legs started to feel numb. Weak. He could no longer keep his balance. He tried to speak, say something, ask the man for help but the words wouldn’t come out.
And before Castiel had time to reply Dean had darted off, leaving the Prince to just stare bewildered at where he had been. Completely in the dark to what the future held for him.
Dean felt himself becoming lost in Castiel’s eyes, an ocean of blue that was gazing back at him with so much love and admiration. He was caught off guard when Castiel surged forward and their lips were pressed together once more. Dean moved his hand to support the back of Castiel’s head and melted into the kiss. It was much better than the first, partly because Castiel was awake this time. But it was also passionate and full everything they had wanted to say to each other over the years but never did. Castiel had wrapped his arms around Dean’s torso and he was certain he was never going to let go again.
He pushed his sweaty hands into his pockets and instantly turned to leave the room, as he was doing so, he could hear Lucifer mumbling to himself-though none of it was very clear or coherent. It stopped once Dean heard the lid slam back down on the wooden box.
“But where do I go?” Castiel asked, tilting his head to try catch Dean’s eye once more.
He scoffed. It was.
Hey! To help myself get over the final I decided to write a few deancas fics based roughly upon Disney movies and fairy tales and this was the first one I thought of. I haven't written a fic in a while so this is probably going to be really messy, so apologies for that but I hope you enjoy it! I already have most of this fic written already so I'll try my best to update this daily!
Cas chuckled at what had been said, but shook his head. Dean tilted his own and flashed his signature puppy eyes at him which he often resorts to when he wants something. It was clearly in a playful manner, so Cas just laughed it off.
“And it’s Prince Castiel, to you.”
“I have a plan. Don’t worry about me,” Dean moved his hand to a satchel hanging from his midriff and tapped gently on it. There was a hollow object stashed inside, creating a knocking sound. The box. Castiel was unsure at what Dean was suggesting, but knew there probably wasn’t enough time for a defined answer.
“Cheers Cas,” Dean responded, fiddling with the straps on his bag, “I’m only looking out for you, man.”
Castiel’s eyes fluttered open, a small smile spread across his lips.
“So, it was you guys following me?” he asked, letting out a relived sigh, “Well, whilst you’re all here...don't suppose any of you know where I can find a cottage?”
Dean began to make his way through the crowd of people in the square. Pushing past large groups who were joking, laughing and drinking together. Uttering 'excuse me,' only just loud enough to be heard. He eventually managed to push his way to the front of the crowd and could now clearly see Prince Castiel. He was sat on a small wall that surrounded an extravagant water feature in the centre of the village. He wore a pristine white shirt with a deep blue jacket over the top, complimenting his royal golden sash. Castiel was talking to a young girl, no older than five, who twiddled her hair round her finger as she spoke to the Prince. She stared at the young man with all the admiration in the world. Dean found himself giving Castiel a similar look, before snapping himself out of his daydreams and carefully positioning himself behind them.
“.... yeah, they really are blue.”
Love Leah <3
Dean felt like he was holding his breath. Like time was moving in slow motion. He had an uneasy feeling, a sense of where this conversation was heading.
“Are we forgetting he’s a Prince?” Someone else said, “Are we not supposed to bow down to him?”
“What a nice...box,” Crowley commented to try deviate the tension from the situation, “What exactly are you going to do?”
Cas walked into the restaurant. He took a deep breath and he strolled towards the table where his friends were sat. He felt slightly apprehensive and it was only now dawning in him how difficult it’d be lying to them. To everyone. Charlie was anxiously drumming her fingers on the table, whilst Sam and Eileen were in some deep conversation. When Charlie noticed Cas approaching, she jumped up out of the booth and brought him into a brief embrace. When she pulled back it was clear to Cas that she was rather annoyed.
Re writing parts of this au that are in the forms of texts and social media interactions is something I'm really enjoying but there is most likely grammatical errors, so for that I apologise.
Dean tilted his head and grinned.
This chapter is kinda sad and angsty up until a point. So I'd like to content warn for mentions of alcohol though Dean doesn't actually drink anything but he definitely wants to.
“Right, so I’m going to tell you what just happened on the last hunt. And it just so happens to be probably the most exciting and interesting hunt I’ve ever been on. Honestly, it's going to blow you away,” Dean started, raising his eyebrows in a smug manner. He opened his mouth to speak once more but was cut off by the sound of heavy approaching footsteps. Castiel turned in their direction instantly, slowly followed by Dean. There, in front of them, stood King Lucifer. His brow was furrowed and his arms were firmly folded across his chest. His outfit was all black, and Castiel was certain there was a menacing look in his brother’s eyes.
There was a bit of laughter from the end of the bed and Castiel shot his head in that direction. It was coming from the red-haired girl who was flashing him a cheesy grin.
“Dean? Is that you?” A voice called from somewhere inside the house.
Whilst he waited, Cas walked over to his brother’s table.
“Come on Crowley, I know it must pain you to admit the truth,” Lucifer stated, his voice a purr full of confidence and arrogance, “Prince Castiel is dead. I am the fairest in this land.”
He had finally won.

Castiel leant forward and pushed the window open onto the latch. The cool summer breeze rushed inside and Castiel closed his eyes for a moment to take it all in. Letting it blow against his face. He smiled before opening his eyes again and glancing out of the window once more.
“WAIT WHAT!?” came a screaming Charlie down the phone, but Cas refused to spill any details no matter how much she pushed. Eventually Charlie gave in and wished Cas a good night before hanging up. Cas chuckled to himself at how invested Charlie was in her friends love lives, maybe next they should try help Charlie with hers.
“So, when are we going to tell our friends we got together?” Cas asked, messing with the sugar packets once more. Dean leant back in his chair, folding his arms as though that would make it easier to decide.
Dean didn’t know what he had expected to hear, but that was certainly not it. He let out a sigh and decided to store it with the many other bizarre things that had happened today, then strode towards Castiel’s bed, expecting Crowley to leave the room. He didn’t.
He finally reached Gabe and Baz, grabbing both of them with an iron grip.  "Where'd he go?"
Anyways, enjoy the chapter!
Dean snorted and quickly covered his mouth as Cas's face lit up into a mischevious smile and snickered quietly with Dean.  Castiel whispered again, "So that's now
Ellen was quiet for a minute.  "Everything okay, Dean?"
Hope you enjoy, and a tremendous thanks to those of you who take time out to comment.  It really means a lot <3
He took out Dean’s throbbing erection, feeling it pulse in his hand.  It was leaking a bit at the head and Cas was already salivating just looking at it.  No wonder Gabe and Baz had had that inside joke going for so long.
"Oh yeah" Cas answered, "I have three other siblings."
Dean’s eyes fluttered open, confused and startled by Cas’s sudden movements.  Cas had sat up completely and was now straddling Dean’s torso.
At lunch time, Dean made it a point to go and sit with Cas and the other two.  It had felt like an eternity since he had talked to Baz or Gabe, and he was dying to have conversations with people that weren’t on his team.  Dean and Cas sat next to each other on the picnic table bench and ate while Gabe and Baz talked.  The other two were unaware or simply didn’t feel the need to point it out, but Cas and Dean were holding hands under the table.
Positive: Cas was sleeping in Dean's bed
It had been about two weeks since the party and Dean and Castiel were doing great.  Their night of vomit and tequila seemed to break the final piece of ice that seemed to be standing between them.  Dean was still pretty unnerved by the fact that he had talked about his parents with him, and with very little prompting, cried, but Cas never brought it up. Everything that had happened that night as well as the day of hanging out and coaching Castiel through his hangover that happened after, seemed to bond them, and they started to hangout outside of religious ed more.  Castiel didn't seem to feel anything but friendship for Dean, but that was perfectly fine with him.  He was happy to have the time at all.  Sure, it felt like a punch to the gut every time Dean was reminded of how much he was into Cas, and by extension was reminded that Castiel was just his friend, and would probably be nothing more, but he decided to let that fuel his appreciation of him rather than dwell on it too much.
The rest of the day seemed to go on at a glacial pace.  Dean wasn’t sure if that was because the activities were incredibly boring, his group hated him immensely, or because he was doing everything he could not to march over to Cas and rip his clothes off.   They continued to play stupid games and Dean’s team continued to lose, but Dean tried his best not to get too upset about that.
Dean surged forward with his whole body and grabbed Cas's face with both of his hands and pulled him into himself, looking right back into his deep blue eyes as he finished the song with Cas in it's final chorus, them both belting their hearts out and moving their bodies to the music, not breaking eye contact.  As the music fizzled out into its final notes and into silence, Dean was out of breath and so was Cas.  They stood there for a second, not talking, still looking at each other, as the music changed to a different song.  Up until this point, Dean had only pure thoughts about Cas.  Sure, they had been a little sex driven in moments when he got a brush of skin against his own, but they were relatively innocent.  This moment was different.  Dean was about five seconds away from throwing him against the wall and slamming his lips onto Castiel's.  Dean swallowed and looked down at Cas's mouth, which was parted and pink in Cas's exhaustion from singing and dancing like they had been.
Dean looked over and saw the tears poking into Castiel's eyes at the kind remark.  Ellen quickly added, "Wait, you don't call your mom, Mama, do you?  I don't want to take her spot."
"Wait, did you get your ears pierced?!"
let Gabriel and Balthazar sit between him and Dean.  Dean figured that Cas must not like him very much, but knew that the other two were entertained by him, so he just tolerated Dean.  Why else would Cas continue to treat him like he was contagious or something.  Dean decided not to let it bother him.  He enjoyed Gabriel and Balthazar's company too, so he just decided to deal with it as is.  Afterall, he was thankful to get to spend any time with Castiel.
The next day proves to be an interesting one for both of them.  Castiel is puking, sweating, and wants to die.  Dean is avoidant and weird.  Dean goes to Gabe, Balthazar, and Castiel's suite for the first time.
10:00am?
Dean leaned over to Jo and slurped his spaghetti again, this time even closer to her and she slapped his shoulder in protest, "You're disgusting!"
Dean raised his eyebrows, giving Benny a,
At that, Chuck cleared his throat and turned on the projector.  The PowerPoint slide was entitled, "Your Journey to the Sacrament" with a picture of the crucifix underneath.
This was the first time since then that he and Cas had actually talked to each other this close to normal since it had happened.  Dean felt warmth start to crawl across his chest.  He'd forgotten about how nice it was to talk to Cas, even though it was just one sentence.  Of course, it was still a little weird but, ya know, baby steps.
"Ace," Castiel repeats, his warm voice wrapping around the syllable like around a piece of fine chocolate. "I do not even try to masturbate. It's frustrating and mostly leads to soreness. I don't get why anyone would jerk off of their own free will."
Dean is so handsome. Castiel may not be interested in what's between his legs, but he could listen to him for hours when he's talking about his brother Sam or his father's car that he is restoring replacement part by replacement part, and hopes to get running soon. Even this LARPing thing sounds fascinating.
"Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you, Cass. I made breakfast."
"Who is the handsome angel here?" Rowena asks, and Castiel looks around who she might mean. She snickers and stretches her hand out. "Nice to meet you."
There are things that Castiel doesn't allow himself to do. He learnt that there are things that non-partners simply don't do. So he takes what Dean gives him. Brushing hands because they always stand too close, crooked smiles, long looks, and reluctant hugs. It's enough. For Castiel, Dean and everything that makes him him, will always be enough.
"I wouldn't marry her if I didn't."
At the reception, Castiel doesn't leave his side. Dean wavers between happiness that his man isn't ashamed to be seen with him, annoyance that Castiel plays his keeper so that he isn't tempted to drink, and worrying, because his boyfriend declines the niblets and only ate a single forkful of wedding cake.
Castiel grabs the garden gate with gloved hands to steady himself. "You bought me a garden?"
"As I said. Nothing special." Dean rolls his eyes. "I'll show you at home. I prepared a PowerPoint presentation."
There is a long pause before Sam answers. "I panicked and said pasta salad."
"Cass, honey." He trails off in a quiet moan. "Please, don't."
Dean opens his mouth but he is too shocked to react. Castiel steps closer, and after a moment of hesitation, he leans in and presses a kiss to Dean's temple ever so softly. Dean feels like crying. He doesn't think he deserves this display of affection after what he said.
"Oh, shit, Cass, that's…"
Dean's hearty laugh vibrates through Castiel like shock waves, diffusing the dark thoughts clouding his mind. Nothing can be really bad when he can make his boyfriend laugh like this.
He ponders if a good night's sleep would be worth the heartache of working with Lisa again. He had switched shifts when they split up. They parted as friends, but some of her words were still stinging, and Dean needed to protect his once more broken heart.
Castiel presses the call button and dries his palm on his jeans. They are still a bit stiff from hand washing them. No matter how often he rinsed them with the showerhead, he didn't manage to get all the laundry detergent out. But he could hardly turn up at Dean's game night with either unwashed clothes or empty hands, could he?
"Go home to your soon-to-be wifey."
"I'm sure they get along just fine." He presses a kiss on Castiel's lips and the lunch box in his hand. "You sure you wanna take the bus?"
"What? No! Have you been raised like this?"
"The twins aren't sleeping." He smiles as if that were a good thing.
Not that the guy couldn't defend himself. Dean loves his strength and his grace, the way he can morph from proud dad to avenging angel in a split second. Claire loves it, too. Dean suspects that she sometimes produces situations for him to go all protective father for her. And Castiel does so gladly.
Castiel freezes. "I didn't…"
It hurts, too. The aching of longing. The pining that catches him in the most unexpected moments. Dean is beautiful inside out, and Castiel tries not to dream, tries to build a life beyond his best friend. And he does. He has other friends, people who are like family to him, even though they don't share blood. Like Dean's brother Sam, or the neighbours' kids Jack and Claire for whom he is kind of a surrogate father. He has Kelly and Charlie, Rowena and Hannah. He knows he's blessed.
"That used to sit looser, right?" Castiel nods. "Good. I can do that. You'll be the best-dressed man at this party."
"We'd love to," Hannah says. "And you are always welcome at ours, of course. We still have some of your stuff, after all."
"Good news. You'll never have to see it again." Dean furrows his brow. "I gave it to a homeless teenager. It's better than no coat at all, and I can wear several sweaters at once, so…"
"No buts. There is no excuse for his behaviour, and you know it."
"Yes. The whole entitlement treatment." Castiel looks at his hands. "Dean, I'm not like them anymore. Life has humbled me."
"I'm full," he says and empties his water.
"Ah, dammit!" Dean presses out and throws his angel onto the bed. "I'll show you how manly I can cuddle." And with that, he starts tickling his angel until both their stomachs ache from laughing, and they end up as a pile of sated limbs.
Dean hums and takes a sip from his coke and watches Castiel taking a bite from his burger, his eyes rolling back as he moans around the food. Dean shakes his head and chuckles. He's happy that his boyfriend enjoys their dinner.
Sabine
he adds in his head. He puts on a smile nonetheless.
"How is he doing?" Nora asks Dean at night four. Usually, the manager is never in the station so late. Her ex must have the baby overnight.
"You're spoiling us, angel."
"He has better and more important things to do than hanging out with us dweebs," Dean retorts.
Dean pushes a hand under Castiel's shirt, caresses the skin there. "I want to feel you, Cass. Please."
Dean tries to see it as a positive sign that Castiel didn't chuck him out on his ear. He decides to give him space.
Maybe if he goes on a late-night run…?
"I didn't mean to…"
They meet in a gentle kiss, still rattled by the revelations of the day. There'll be discussions to be had, boundaries to be drawn, and compromises to be made. But those can wait.
"Already met him."
Charlie looks at him with her stupidly kind eyes, and Dean knows she won't let this go. "You don't have to sleep with him. Just be upfront with Cass. I'm sure he'll understand."
Anna furrows her brow. "Are you okay, Dean?" she asks concerned.
"I'm feeling good, Sammy. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink a beer or two."
Castiel smiles at him a bit forced. During the seasonal festivals, the cops are rather hard on those who sleep behind the shrubs. He's lucky not to be one of them anymore. He'll do everything in his power to never go back.
"I'll sleep in my room tonight," he presses out and slams the door shut. He falls on his bed and cries angry tears into his pillow.
"There are needs beyond everyday necessity, Dean."
"Good afternoon," Castiel replies, but there is no teasing tone accompanying it.
A thousand questions are running through Dean's head, piling up in his mouth like cars in a chain-reaction collision. But he doesn't get them out. Not when they exit the bus, not on their short walk to the Gas-N-Sip, and not during their astoundingly busy eight-hour shift.
Dean can see that his boyfriend struggles against the impulse to run. He touches Castiel's face tenderly. "Where did your mind stray?" he repeats Castiel's earlier question.
"Postcards? Like from family and friends?"
Dean sighs and runs a hand over his face. Sometimes, his boyfriend is as timid as a fawn. "Cass—"
"Cass?"
Dean turns his head and looks at his boyfriend. His face is so open and inviting that Castiel needs to swallow hard to even form the next words.
of sex, and sometimes, I see you lick your lips or lean forward, and the thought of that in a sexual situation arouses me. But, if I have the real deal, I just can't. I either lose my boner or I just don't get off. It's fucked up. I'm sorry."
Castiel's eyes shoot up, a tender blush rosing his cheeks. "I didn't—" Dean raises an eyebrow and Castiel deflates. "You make less money than me," he states nonetheless.
He feels Dean's worried eyes on him, and so he grabs a hot dog from the pile. If he eats it very slowly, no one will catch on, he's sure. He meets Dean's eyes as he takes the first bite. His boyfriend grins when Castiel's eyes widen at the delicious taste.
"I was nine. Everyone wants to be a firefighter at that age," Gabriel says, grinning mischievously. "And it's not as if I burnt the house down or something."
Dean holds him back when he moves away. "Can we just watch 'Constantine' and...?" He nods in the bed's direction.
"No need. Hannah will bring my old one on Christmas. Gotta go now. Love you." Castiel presses a last kiss to Dean's lips and then hurries to catch his bus. Dean smiles after him.
Castiel shakes his head. "You're feeling 'good' because you don't feel the full blow of the symptoms."
Castiel shakes his head. "Bees are attracted to the colour purple, blue and violet, too. That's why many flowers grow in such colours, to attract them."
"How… how did Castiel react when I said it?"
"Thinking about what? You two?"
Dean glances at him, heart in his mouth. He spoke his truth freely for the very first time. It should be invigorating, but all it did was punch the air out of his lungs.
Castiel lowers his voice in hope that Dean gets the hint. He knows that they are already watched by some guests from the middle of the table. "He would adapt. Just like I did."
Castiel smiles. He's content and the night is calm. Sam is driving and for once, there is no ghost to salt or apocalypse to stop. Maybe that'll change tomorrow, but he doesn't think about that now. He relishes Dean's body leant into his side, his cheek brushing against his collar, and the soft caress of his breath on the skin of his neck. He savours the quiet snores, Dean's hand that ended up between their thighs, their bumping knees and Dean's scent, intoxicating in a way no angel was ever meant to experience.
