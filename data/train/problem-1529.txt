But he also felt a lot of pleasure. It even increased when John switched on the thing in his arse and the beads started to vibrate and rotate. Sherlock was close when John stopped everything. Sherlock just sagged and panted into the gag. He had problems breathing because his nose was clogged.
“Such as?” Mycroft really wondered what he wanted to bring.
“What the hell is my darling brother doing?” Mycroft swore staring into his computer at the breakfast table. Greg read the paper in the meantime and grinned behind it.
“What…” He ended in John’s embrace.
„You couldn't have known what happened to me. I gave all the signs that I liked what we have done. And I did like what we have done. But you were crowding me. And I couldn't, I wasn't ...“ John shuddered and crossed his arms over his body.
“He tracked my mobile and found me in a B&B not far away. I trusted him to find me because I had no money and told the innkeeper that someone would show up for me.”
Such things had never been done to John, most of all not by a man. He never had been on the receiving end of this. It was intoxicating. He closed his eyes and gave in completely. His arms went around Sherlock’s waist and he touched his skin by moving his fingertips over it. This made him moan into his mouth.
What was he supposed to come up with now? Sherlock had no ideas left.
When he had Sherlock under him again, he tore apart the tee and tied his wrists on his lower back. And then he used a second stripe to blindfold him. Sherlock shamelessly rutted on the mattress and John rudely pulled him up by his bound wrists.
Only now he called the ambulance with the Afghan’s mobile. He scattered some contents of his med-kit all over the guy including his bloody gloves.
“Gregory…” Mycroft groaned cupping his face and leaning down to kiss him. He looked into his face and saw how uncomfortable he was. He reached out and took a Kleenex from the coffee table. He wiped his face clean using several more.
“Very good. Now, tell me the last thing. What about the dirty talk?” Now Mycroft shook his head.
“I should hope so.” Mycroft said looking hopeful again. Greg smiled.
“Don’t worry. It needs some getting used to but when you have sorted it out, it will be amazing.” Both men looked at Sherlock and Mycroft who were buried in their documents, laptop screens and mobile phones.
“Which destination would you advise?” John asked.
“This was very good, Gregory. Thank you so much.” He smiled and it made him look a completely different man.
John shook his head. Was he going mad? Really? His thoughts and fantasies were spinning while he stared at the too thin and beaten body in front of him.
“Can I come along?” He asked and Greg grinned.
“Answer me!” John licked his lips.
“Let me hear you. Don't hold back.” This was a new order and Sherlock wondered what was going on. But he let out a clear moan when his prostate was touched after a long time of being ignored.
“I thought so.”
“Yes.” John grinned and pocketed his wallet.
“What do you mean?”
“Slut?” His head shot up and he fell on his knees.
“Perfect! There are places in the basement. John, go ahead.” But John shook his head.
“Eat, pet.” Sherlock finished his meal and looked up.
“Yes, slut. I have changed it a bit. But don't you worry.” He cruelly laughed.
“You like her.” He stated on their way back to the house. Sherlock turned his head.
Suddenly he realised that Gregory was staring back at him with a raised brow.
“Perfect! Lead the way!” Sherlock walked into his bedroom and opened his drawer. John looked inside and smiled.
“Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!” He loudly swore and dashed into the bathroom.
John didn't kill the DCI. He could have but right now he held the tranquillizer gun and it was more important to go after Sherlock. Surely, he could have killed him with his bare hands but he felt more like going after his slave. The bloody policeman wasn't important. And he could always kill him after he had secured the bitch. His bitch.
Combined with the contractions around his cock the sight made John come instantly. After he was spent, he slowly pulled out and fell to the side.
“It’s a bloody mystery.” He muttered and placed the mug on the counter. Then he pulled some papers from his bag and handed them over to Sherlock.
“Very good. I will better be going then.” Mycroft stood and they hugged.
“You may need to punish me. Sir.” John straightened his body and Sherlock slanted his eyes.
“But that’s the way I like it!” Sherlock sounded shocked.
“Really?” Sherlock smiled but he looked sad.
He knocked on the door and soon they heard the thumping moves from behind it. John opened and looked at them. He recognised the DI from the investigation but he hadn’t seen the other man yet. His eyes rested on him a bit longer. What a fucking beauty …
“Come closer.” Sherlock ordered and John kept looking at him.
Upstairs he politely knocked and heard Gregory's answer. He turned the knob and entered. And there he was turning around. He stilled and Mycroft closed the door.
“Oi, lovebirds! Found anything, Sherlock?” Greg stepped up and John turned around raising a brow.
“Anyway, it took me some time but finally my brain booted up again. It just needs some exercise.”
“What’s going through your mind, love?” Suddenly there was John standing in front of him.
Greg placed the bag on the nightstand.
“No!” He hissed the one word and it surprised Sergej.
He needed to explain it to John later. He hoped John would still be there. Perhaps, he would leave and meet someone in a pub. Perhaps, he would meet someone who would sub easier than he, be less complicated, with fewer triggers.
The waves rode over him again and again. Blinding white lights were before his eyes and he blacked out for the second time when Mycroft made him orgasm and then extended his orgasm until he came wildly for the second time.
“What do you need?” He softly asked.
“You brought wine. That’s nice of you. Give!” He held out his hand and his strong fingers closed around the bottle. Mycroft let go and shed his coat. Greg took it and hung it up by the door.
“Yes, he really looks so cute inside the crib covered by baby-clothes or simply an over-sized diaper holding a rattle.” He replied.
“Sherlock never fell in love before. Except for his work, of course. But he never had anyone.”
“And we want you happy.” Greg replied.
“Come on, Sherlock. You need to shower and then we are going to have lunch.” He held out a hand and Sherlock took it.
“I am sorry. I kept watching until you had fallen asleep. I wanted a drink. I was selfish again. I am sorry.” Sherlock said.
Greg had stepped up to John in the meantime. They glared at each other.
check online. Suddenly John yawned.
“And I will make your waiting worthwhile.” John grinned and Sherlock stopped the pouting.
“My feelings?”
Sherlock didn't move or look up and John sat down.
“What am I supposed to do?”
“I hope you don’t mind, mate, but I need to talk to Sherlock.”
He talked to the receptionist at first to get a wash bag for him and had it brought up to his room. He also had his minibar stocked up. Then he talked to DS Grant to get a hoodie, t-shirts, and track pants for him. At last, he called Mycroft from a quiet corner in the hall.
“So, finish this scene and then we will proceed after a little break.” The man nodded his approval and turned fully towards Sherlock again.
He estimated the time until John’s return and decided he had enough left. He removed the rope around his genitals and while pulling and stroking, he alternately pulled the right clamp. He came with a yell when he pulled the clamp off quickly.
“Yes, Master.”
“You can trust him. You will be absolutely safe with him. No harm will come to you. I won't allow it.”
Sherlock was only a bit drunk. He took the opportunity to take what he wanted. And he wanted John. He knew he wouldn’t leave him behind so he acted a bit wild. He knew John would wonder if he’d throw up. Sherlock slurred a bit more than needed and clung to his body. And when he had John beneath him, he relaxed on top of him.
“That's good, isn't it?” Mycroft asked.
“No, he still waits and doesn't understand why he has been sent away. You can be happy he is such a stubborn man, too. I believe he really likes you. He doesn't want to lose you, Sherlock. Do not destroy this. You have found a friend, a good man, and perhaps there might even be more for you in it.” They looked into each other's eyes.
“Yes, how couldn’t I? He is simply perfect.” Now Sherlock cleared his throat.
“Well, that’s always good, isn’t it?” He turned away to get a dressing gown. Mycroft followed him.
“Yes, we can!” Greg exclaimed and poured the whiskey.
“Perfect suggestion, pet!” He took a smaller piece of rope and hooked his fingers behind the hem of John’s boxers. Then he pulled them down and let them slide the rest of the way down to his ankles. John stayed where he was.
“Yesterday he wasn't well. He cried a lot when telling me about his past and why he denied my brother his wishes. I understood his reasons. Now my brother is on the way to meet him. He will be surprised but they need to talk. I don't want them to break up. It just can't be.” He sadly shook his head.
John sighed while kneading the dough for a bread he wanted to bake for dinner.
“I see ...” He stayed close to him anyway. He didn't see anyone but he sensed them. This was dangerous. Sherlock walked down some stairs into a filthy basement where a rat-faced guy sat at a desk. He stood at once when he recognised Sherlock.
“What?” Sherlock grinned.
“You are not expected to do anything, Myc. I would like to go together with you and look for new stuff but you don’t have to if you don’t want to.” Greg smiled.
John woke at once and he knew he had missed his appointment at the hospital. He was wide awake again.
Sherlock had also noted his clothes on that day; if he had worked a shift, a double shift, or none at all.
“It or he? You seem to be very confused. I fear, I might have given you too many pain-killers.” Ian sadly shook his head. John looked up at him. It took him several minutes to relax into the bedding.
“I expect it to stay by my side. You are not to leave me alone at any time expect when I order it to chat up other people. It will dance with me and have dinner with me. It will talk nicely to my associates. There may be a public fucking, I am not sure yet. Does it think it will manage?”
“Yes, I agree to it for tonight. What about your cock, balls and a plug?” A nod followed and this time John accepted the non-verbal agreement because he could see his excitement.
“How long will the effect last?” The doctor looked at him again and estimated it quietly.
He walked into the kitchen and found the plate. There were different fresh biscuits and he looked at them before taking one with lemon. He carefully nibbled and found them delicious. He wondered if he could make Dr Watson bake for him, as well.
He was quick and efficient. He was working very quickly and chopped like a kitchen machine.
Mycroft was a genius. He was perfect. Greg wanted more. Greg wanted all of it. Everything he had to give; he would take it happily.
“It has been perfect for me and will be rewarded. But first it needs to get out of here.” Sherlock was moved into a bathroom down here and showered. He didn't like the bath because it had white tiles. It was white.
“You will find out time come and if more things in here need to be changed, we can manage it later.” Greg said.
Surprisingly Sherlock pulled him close and both men stilled. Sherlock stared into John’s eyes.
“You lost weight since last time. Doesn’t Sherly feed you properly?” John didn’t react to Moriarty’s statement over the speakers. Moran tired him out over the time. He knew he was allowed to play a bit, but James couldn’t be bored. So finally, he just caught him by the wrist and turned it around. John screamed and paled. Moran let go and took him into a bear-hug from behind. He held him close with one arm and the other was on his crotch. He rudely pressed his cock.
“You didn’t give him a good reason to stay. You just held him back. He didn’t like that.” Sherlock tried to explain.
“Yes?” It was clearly Ian but he didn't sound very polite. At once Sherlock felt bad. He was a submissive after all. He cleared his throat.
The place by his side was empty and he couldn’t hear any noises.
After breakfast, they rode back to London using one of Mycroft’s black sedans. John had always wondered if they belonged to him or the government or if perhaps it was all the same.
Ian stood in front of his door and closed his eyes for a moment. Then he straightened up and knocked.
“Can’t wait…” Greg got up still rubbing his behind. It gave Mycroft certain ideas.
He looked around again and decided the place was perfect.
Then Sherlock actually filled his plate again half full. John was extremely pleased and ate some more, as well, even though he had had the snacks in the pub. He was careful with the wine though because he already had a pint.
“How do you feel?” John asked looking him over since he was naked over the blanket.
“Let me help you. You do trust me, don’t you?” John looked at him.
“Molly Hooper would go at people laughing about you with her scalpel.” A small smile tugged at Sherlock's lips.
“No! No, Sherlock. It was John's fault. He did all this. He became mad and I still don't know why. We probably will never find out. And as far as I am concerned, you became my friend and I need you to understand that I am not holding a grudge against you.” Sherlock carefully looked up and a tiny smile was back.
“Much better.”
“No, he isn’t. But he is also seeing my brother and trusts him with everything.”
John tried to talk himself out of it.
“But what about the traitor?” Greg asked.
“Look, one and a half hours. If you make it, I promise a reward. If you don’t, I will punish you. I won’t only let you soil yourself on that blanket. I will also leave you there. Perhaps I will wrap you into it.”
“He never just fucks around as you so eloquently put it. He always has a purpose. Before you came into the mix, he used his body to gather information. It didn’t matter to him. Just transport, you know? But now, there is you. You will never get rid of him again if you do it right.”
All the time John watched him from his armchair pretending to work on his computer. Everything looked good so far. The moment when everything cooked and simmered, he set up the table. He used a table-cloth and linen napkins. He even chose a candle holder and filled the decanter. He had a last look and was pleased with himself.
“An hour? How much blood did you take?”
“OK, just wait a minute, please.” He made some coffee and added milk. Then he came over and sat in the second armchair opposite of Mycroft. Expectantly he looked at him. He reeked of power, authority, and even more power.
“Any children?” He shook his head.
“Yes, until he found you.”
“How the hell should Greg know what you want?” Mycroft asked wanting to push him forward.
He changed the gag into a rather large ball-gag, then lifted him even higher. He hooked a thin rope to his nipples and pulled them down to the ground. Another length of rope led from his Prince Albert down to another hook. He pressed another button on the remote and his legs were forced apart. Then he was lowered down again and he adjusted the ropes leading to his nipple-rings and groin.
“He’s got a range of one to ten. He won’t leave his flat for less than a seven.”
They looked at each other and grinned.
“Nothing at all. You fell asleep. You were dreaming and moaning rather shamelessly. You woke, looked at me and swayed upstairs.” John blushed and Sherlock smiled.
“Biscuit, too.” Sherlock said and already reached out. Greg handed him a biscuit and he devoured several ones before he focused back on Greg.
“I love you too. Very much. I can't ever lose you.” Mycroft relaxed in his hold.
John joined him again still a bit wet. He approached him and looked up at him. Sherlock swallowed.
“Thanks, mate. This is nice. Here, there is something left. I can keep it, can’t I?” He asked.
Sherlock went into the bathroom to wash his face and freshen up. His nose was clotted and he blew it several times.
“You will be on your own again. You will observe and deduce again. But it will take time.” Greg said.
He hurried upstairs and into the living room. Sherlock turned around playing.
“What do you want to do now?” Greg asked getting comfy. Mycroft had a thoughtful expression on his face and stepped up.
John thought about a mask but perhaps another day. He had to remind himself not to do too much.
“I am feeling good.” Sherlock said all smiling. He slowly moved down on his back looking up at John who pulled the blanket off their bodies.
It didn't take long for the two men to come back. Sergej clapped his hands and clearly enjoyed the sight. Then he leant against the wall and waited for the scene to begin.
“I will set up a video feed, so you will always know what is happening. But you will stay here with Greg. This place is safe. Please, you two have to promise me you will stay here!” He looked at them.
John got ready for the day and was dressed in a smart suit when Sherlock swayed into the kitchen looking for him. He was clad in trackpants and a sweater and warm socks. But he hadn't showered. And he was panting.
“John? What do you feel?” No reply.
“Mate.” He roughly whispered close to his ear. Greg's shaking hands came up and held him.
“I solved the case, of course.” John sighed.
If his brother could see him over CCTV, he would laugh right into his face. Luckily, he was busy with Lestrade.
“Ok?” He muttered and disappeared into the bath. He hadn’t seen this coming.
“Bend over!” The man ordered and Sherlock did it. He pushed his legs apart and a massive plug was moved into his behind. Sherlock felt something brush against his legs and knew it was a tail. The thing got hooked to the harness.
“I'll talk first, shall I?” Sherlock said and Mycroft only nodded. And Sherlock talked. He told him everything about Greg and his night and day. Mycroft listened to everything and when he was done a bright smile was on his face.
“I’ll have it picked up.”
“Can't you find out where he was going to?” But Greg shook his head.
With every stroke he landed on his body and with every push inside his arse he told him he was lost forever. He was in permanent pain and couldn't look straight anymore but he never lost his hope.
“Yes.”
“Yes, but I could still kneel and suck you off with a blindfold on and cuffs around my wrists. Or ropes.” He tried to understand.
Greg reached out and rubbed over his nipples. He twitched and Greg saw the impressive bulge inside his trousers. He smirked and rubbed there, too.
„Much better...“ Sherlock smirked. He reached out and touched the straightjacket. His arousal became obvious right away. Their eyes met over the boy's head and John nodded his approval. He would get one fitted for him.
“If there are any problems, if you are unsure or need help, you call me. I will place some of my men around the house for protection. We can't trust his anymore. You don't have to worry about them. They will patrol around and sit in their car. They won't enter. If someone does enter the house again, call me! Did I make myself clear?”
He took the rope away from his wrists and picked him up. He carried him into their bedroom and placed him on the bed. He got a towel and washed the cum off his body. He also placed one underneath him because it leaked from his hole.
Greg had done the dishes since he had no dishwasher because his ex-wife took that with her, too. He wiped all the surfaces and stored the bottles Mycroft had brought. He also washed the bedding and put them into the dryer in his flat’s basement. Luckily, no one else used it but it was late already. He had to wait until it was done because it was his only set.
Sherlock felt sick. Helpless and in pain. He screamed but he didn't.
Suddenly, it knocked.
“There is something you want to tell me. Something more.” Mycroft said pulling him close again.
“Why do you even have to ask?” They slowly walked upstairs and Greg disappeared first into the bath. He just shed his clothes and had a quick wash. He also brushed his teeth. He slumped towards the bed scratching his arms.
“Very good, love. See you later!” Sherlock grunted a reply and listened to John leave the flat. He heard him jump down the stairs and started to press his arse down until he started to feel good.
“DI Lestrade, Dr Watson. He is asleep.” She whispered and gestured for Greg to follow her outside. He cast a look at Sherlock but followed her. John was approaching the bed and took the folder with the medical documentation. Blood pressure, heartbeat and pulse were still a bit high but not dangerously so. The injuries in his behind had been treated. They didn't have to sew him up but he was raw and digesting wouldn't be fun for a while. The welts on his back wouldn't leave scars.
“He has known for a long time. Before me. So yes, I would like to join you.”
He groaned loudly around Sherlock and pressed forward some more.
“Hey, what’s up? What are you thinking about?” Mycroft’s head shot up. And it just came out.
“If you let me see, I could probably create an ointment for you. I am a very good chemist, you know?” Sherlock offered.
“You ordered dinner for us? What kind of dinner?” He slowly walked deeper into the flat followed by his beauty.
John stood to make a chocolate mousse. Right when he put cream on top, Mycroft opened the door. Greg looked up and a broad smile came up. But after a second it was gone again. Mycroft looked at him and tilted his head. His eyes shone. He shed his coat and placed his umbrella by the door.
For days on end, they were running away. They never saw any helicopters or military. They actually felt rather safe.
“Stay still, slut!” He smacked his face once and John closed his mouth and stood still.
„You know, why don't we shove him directly into the cage? We can roll it back with him inside. We can also poke him a bit.“
“Where have you been? You were only to bring the present. What did you do?” Sebastian approached him.
Only a few minutes later he realised that John was staring back at him. Obviously, he was expecting more orders. His pupils were dilated. His eyes were blown.
James knelt in front of him and shoved his knees apart and opened his trousers. He got out his prick and rudely pulled and squeezed it. And his body betrayed him. He got hard and he sobbed. Snot and saliva ran over his chin making James laugh. He got up and picked up a cane. Silver, of course, it was. He hit his body with it and at last he also hit his prick. Skin burst open and he screamed high-pitched.
“When thinking about what John Watson did to Sherlock, I can't be anything else but angry. He calls himself a dom but what he really is, is a mean sadist torturing the ones who just love to give out their love and devotion, who enjoy being dominated. I always loved my wife but in my younger years, I tended to be very strict. Too strict because she left me.” He drank some more.
Sherlock hailed a cab and soon the car was racing down the streets of London to get rid of him again as soon as possible. When he reached home, he looked up to their windows. A warm flare was behind the glass and the curtains were half-closed. He smiled and opened the door. Mrs Hudson wasn’t in since he couldn’t hear her TV. The door upstairs was open and he stepped inside. With one move he shrugged out of his coat and hung it up on a hook at the door. His scarf went the same way.
They had talked to each other and Sherlock had tried to explain what he wanted. John had listened to him and agreed to something simple, something they could try out.
Their bags were already on their way and Sherlock took them from the guard. He even thanked him. Security guards were important and he had learnt earlier not to mess with these men and women.
Ian was regularly visiting, too.
He needed to stop this. It didn't help. And John wanted him to be of use. He would try and enjoy his time in London.
“Johonn?” Sherlock hiccupped making John look up. Only then he realised that Sherlock was quite drunk. It was endearing and John had to smile.
“I know. That’s why I am holding you back. You look great. Wonderful. Beautiful.” Slowly, Sherlock turned his head.
“Your presence is scaring my little brother. He is afraid of you.” Greg looked at Sherlock and saw Mycroft was right.
John banged the door closed and pulled a face.
Sherlock became restless and tried to move and speak. John let him do this for a while until he stopped again. He whined under the mask and strained his body. Again, there was no reaction.
Mycroft kept watching him. He wondered if everything was really fine and decided to talk to Sherlock later and find out what he could do.
“Come here, please. Eat and drink with me. Later we can have fun.” John quietly laughed but sat down. He slowly started to eat. He couldn’t remember when he had had something like this.
He watched Sherlock getting dressed. He had bought him a three-piece-suit and it looked wonderful on him. He arranged his hair himself and put it together in his neck. He looked amazing.
Suddenly he snatched his bony wrist and pulled him close. His arm was pulled up behind him and his body pressed against the man's. Sherlock tried to kick and bite but he only laughed. His free arm wildly moved when the man's lips closed over his mouth and his tongue invaded him. He fucked him with his tongue. He bit him and groped his behind. Sherlock felt his arousal.
“Hm…” Sherlock hummed and thought about it.
“Please. John, please. I need to come. I am hurting. Please? Please? John?” John felt his own prick swell again when he listened to his pleas.
“Do you want to have sex with me?” He asked and made Greg blush.
The next morning John slowly woke because he felt watched. He blinked his eyes open and met Sherlock’s piercing glance. A small smile tugged up his lips and they locked eyes.
But it was so nice. What Sherlock did was so good. He felt so good and he opened his mouth for him. At once Sherlock's body straightened and he was held by his neck. Sherlock nibbled at his lips, sucked them, and then sucked his tongue. And John returned the kiss. His grip on Sherlock tightened to almost painful and he straightened up, too. He moaned into his mouth and closed his eyes again. He clawed his tee and hair and made Sherlock moan in return. Their kisses became wet and hot and dirty and rougher by the minute.
“I don't know what to say ...” John turned away and murmured:
“I bet he was supposed to be somewhere else.” They looked at each other.
“I am a doctor if you care to remember.”
“I am still dirty and smelly. Let me shower. Then we can talk about what to do.” Greg quietly said and smiled.
“What about …” Sherlock shook his head.
He heard him talk but couldn’t understand the topic or find out whom he was talking to. He simply waited for him to come back. He hoped he didn’t have to leave now. Greg really wanted him to stay for a while longer. He wanted to have dinner with him and he also wanted to grope him some more.
“No, it is surely not a myth. I have seen people fall into subspace. Some do it quickly and with some, it needs time and special treatments. You were close a few times and I wondered what held you back.”
John had lost his temper with him and Sherlock had pushed him off the bed. The yelling had reached another level and John had left. Sherlock moved after him and accused him of running away. He had been ignored. He stayed behind. He went back to bed but sat leaning against the headrest. He was angry, sad, and confused.
“This won’t fit you, Sir.” Suddenly a female voice said right beside him. Sherlock didn’t even turn his head.
“Absolutely.” Sherlock smiled and John quickly agreed. She left with a huge smile on her face.
They stayed for a few hours and before they left, John again checked on Mycroft while Sherlock freshened up. He returned with the bandage halfway off and was trying to get it back on.
Greg knew he wouldn’t be able to take him into his mouth. He had to use his hands. Perhaps he would start training secretly with a dildo. At home alone.
“I was at work and when I got home, he wasn't here. He didn't leave a message and his mailbox is on.”
“I see.” He rolled out of bed and went into the bathroom which was empty by now. He found a wrapped toothbrush and used it. Then he walked downstairs where Greg was rummaging in the kitchen and Mycroft hovered close.
He had lost a lot of his strength due to the silver being used on him. In here, all the devices were silver, too. It kept hurting him without a break. And it sucked the power out of him, enabled him to use any magic himself. James Moriarty very well knew what he was doing and made this Sebastian do it for him.
"You know, I never want to run into you when you're in a bad mood, John Watson." But he was grinning when he said it. John grinned in return.
“Very good, John. Do you have any questions so far?” John had to clear his throat again.
“Has it occurred to you that perfect, at least your version of it, might not be what I really need?”  John’s question back was nearly as quiet.  “Have you ever thought that what we had, the cases, the running, even the body parts in the fridge, were exactly what I’d been hoping for?”  Sherlock neither looked up nor replied.  John let out a soft sigh and stood, carefully walking over to take Cecelia from Sherlock’s arms.  The motion finally forced him to meet John’s eyes, their color a golden hazel from the firelight.  He watched the wrinkles form around John’s eyes as he smiled.  “Get to bed soon.  I don’t care if it’s just transport; we’ve got research to do in the morning.”
“Yes, he seems like that kind of sort,” McGonagall replied with a small snort.  Almost instantly, however, she returned to her usual sober self, regarding John carefully from across the room.  “I know the subject of your parents is a sensitive subject, John, and I’m loathe to bring back what’s best to be left in the past, but unfortunately I have little choice in the matter.  My news is somewhat good, however – it would appear we have more concrete evidence on who was responsible for their deaths.  From what you’ve just told me, it seems as though I came to inform you none too soon.”
The two links in the work are to images of the inspiration for the beds they have at Hogwarts.  Also, if the description of Doyle sounds familiar, it's because he's visually inspired by Robert Downey Jr.  Because reasons.
Normally as a third year student John wouldn’t still be living in the halls, but they were the cheapest option, so when last year’s flatmate moved on, Sherlock Holmes was chosen as his replacement. Beyond his name and that he was a second year chemistry major, the stories were all he had before he met him. Regardless of how or why he was there, however, he was absolutely stunning, and hence, John was fucked.
"I want to see you," John suddenly said, eyes darting up from her arm to her face. "The real you, not this picture you've painted of the Mary I thought I knew."
“You sure?  You’re awfully pale.”  John shifted his hand up to feel Sherlock’s forehead, rubbing his thumb there in a calming motion.  Sherlock’s eyes slid shut and he nodded, careful not to knock off John’s hand.
Sherlock’s only reply was a nod against John’s shoulder.  For a long moment, the three of them simply sat there holding each other close and whispering reassurances.  Suddenly, approaching footsteps caused John’s head to shoot up and he glanced around them frantically, snatching up his formerly discarded wand once more.  He let out a sigh of relief when he spotted Harry running toward them with a pair of Aurors flanking him.
Well shit y'all.  I got some seriously amazing responses to this last chapter, both here and on ff.net.  Not gonna lie, I was feeling really awful about my writing the day I posted that chapter.  I had just been rejected to my choice Creative Writing Masters program, so the reaction I got on chapter eight was seriously just what I needed.  I have since applied to a few other schools, so here's hoping something works out.  Anyway, time to put you out of your cliffhanger misery.  We've got some action going down in this chapter, and I look forward to seeing what you think!
“Buildings!” she cried, louder than she ought.  The students sitting closest to them turned to watch them with a mixture of annoyance and amusement.
“Anything else you think we should add?” John asked as he picked up a long beaded necklace. Sherlock dug through a different box and pulled out a black leather whip that reminded John of the day they first met. While John was lost in reminiscing, Sherlock searched for a plain belt and used it to secure the whip to his waist.
Sherlock allowed John’s words to wash over him and felt himself succumbing to sleep in the warmth and safety of his arms.
“Daddy, that’s gross,” she declared as she climbed down and scrunched her nose at them.
“God, John,
“I’d do anything to help,” James replied, seeming to remember their purpose and pulling away from Mycroft.  The two still remained seated closer than typical for a pair who had just met, and John noticed that Mycroft’s free hand had at some point moved down to rest on Thor’s head, but neither made a motion to move further away from the other.  James looked away from Mycroft long enough to nod at John before turning warm eyes back on Mycroft.  “If you think I could do any good, I’d be honoured to give it a try.”
Niall stepped up to John’s side and John passed him the note without a word. As he read through it, all of the colour drained from his face. “There’s been nothing this bad so far. The other notes were suggestive, sure, but this…I mean, this is threatening direct violence! And how’d they learn about your personal information? The audience isn’t permitted to know more about you than your first names.”
“Nothing as personal as what’s in there, that’s for sure,” the first woman muttered, shooting her companion a glance. “We let them lead the conversation for the most part, waiting for them to develop the world for the evening and following their lead. I know I didn’t even tell anyone my age, let alone where we live.”
“The work’s not the work without you, John.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John raised his head to shoot Snape a small yet grateful smile.  He waved a quiet farewell to Dumbledore and McGonagall and led Sherlock away by the hand.  They made it all the way to the entranceway before either made a sound.
First of all, I am so sorry if you're hurting or angry over what happened on Sunday.  I'm right there with you.  But I'm definitely not stopping my writing in this fandom - if nothing else, it's going to get me to write even more in defiance.  So I give you an offering: a bit of smut, a bit of argument, and a lot of the boys doing what they should: talking it out.  Love to all of you.
“Hmm, I wouldn’t say overreacting,” John muttered, starting to trail kisses along Sherlock’s neck.  “Jumping to conclusions, maybe.  Overthinking things, definitely.  But it’s a worry anyone in your situation would have.  I’m sorry I didn’t realize sooner that it was bothering you.”
“You should talk to Madam Hooch about helping out with the Hufflepuff team sometime,” Albus said once he got his breath back.  “They could use it.”
Minerva McGonagall pays Baker Street a call.  Sherlock deduces, Mrs. Hudson frets, and the case is on.
“Excellent, you went into the Restricted Section.  Backgrounds on known Death Eaters?”
“So it was a rejection,” Sherlock muttered.  His face remained blank, but his shoulders sunk at the news.  “I wasn’t going to attend Hogwarts regardless.”
“Well, it’s perfect.  Thank you.”  He heard a crash and giggles from the kitchen and groaned.  Reluctantly, he shifted around Sherlock and rose to his feet, intent on going to investigate what trouble was going on in the other room.  He placed a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead and smiled when his eyes closed at the move.  “Happy Christmas, love.”
Sherlock gave him a small, jerking nod.  “The bit with the roses seems to be the final touch to let us, you specifically, know that she’s involved.  Though inscribing ‘blood traitor’ on them seems to be sending an odd sort of message, both to us as well as Harry and his Aurors.  Obviously it’s meant to have some sort of meaning, but whether to them or you specifically is uncertain.”
Sherlock sniffed and looked at him out of the corner of his eye, a small smile on his lips. “I’ve had a wide variety of cases throughout my life, John. You never know what might be required.”
“What are you waiting for, pet? I missed you and now I want you!” John said and Sherlock swallowed. He quickly shed his clothes but folded them neatly. He didn't want his anger directed at him. Never again.
Meanwhile, John felt his pulse.
He also saw how gentle Dr Kim was with Sherlock. He only flinched once and Dr Kim stroked over his hips to calm him down. Finally, he injected some cream directly into his body.
“So do I. I trust you to make suggestions for us on how to handle ourselves for a certain period of time.” Greg looked at him for a few seconds and then asked.
“That’s good, isn’t it? You deserve it so much, Sherlock.” Mycroft quietly said.
“I damn well know that, Ian. I bought him from the damn agency where I always rent from. I have never asked anything and I am not asking now. He once told me though that he had been abducted when he was high. He was a user and living on the streets. They found him and saw his looks and they took him. They trained him and then I came around and since they know what I like they offered him to me.” John sighed and drank.
“Very good. Yes.”
“You have to trust me, Greg. Please? I will tell you but not on the phone.”
“Oh, please. Don't look like that.” Sebastian grinned. He finished his wine and finally stood.
“Eat, Myc. Please. You have lost weight.” Sherlock said seriously. Mycroft sighed but took a plain toast and a few eggs.
John hit him ten times and Sherlock’s voice was rough. His face was blotchy and he cried and sobbed. But he also counted and thanked his dom. John actually looked very pleased and dropped the whip.
“Fine, I guess?” He didn’t look at John. And John didn’t want to push him, so he just turned back into the kitchen to clean up. After a few minutes, Sherlock stood behind him.
Sergej lifted him off his body and placed him on the sofa. He wasn't moving but his pulse was fine. His eyes were open but unfocused. He had gone under.
“I don’t know if I can transmit diseases. I am sorry, John, I didn’t think of the possibility.”
“What?” He looked around and again at Sherlock. Suddenly he remembered.
“Do you understand what happened and that it wasn’t his intention?”
In the end, John had found the heavy thing. He had cleaned it and carried it downstairs. He fitted the tree into it. The tree was actually taller than he was and it turned out not to be easy to handle this one all by himself.
“Greg, could you get my backpack? Send someone back through the cave. I left it there. I brought clothes for my little brother.” Greg walked downstairs and send a soldier away back through the passage-way.
He also listened to the noises Sherlock produced to know when he was about to appear. And when he did appear, he was already clad in one of his finer suits. John raised a brow.
“You are a good man, Sherlock Holmes.” Sherlock had the decency to blush. It made John laugh quietly. “You are also very, very adorable.” His voice was getting rough and Sherlock cast his eyes.
“Would you mind?” John’s finger moved over the fabric of his dressing gown. Sherlock’s hand came up and pulled the belt open. The robe parted and John’s eyes widened. He had seen Sherlock naked before but never like this. He was so beautiful. It was breathtaking.
“Yes.”
“There you go, this was very good, John. Now suck and move your head. Do that several times and press your lips around it. Continue to suck and lick while going down. If you think you need to gag, you have to suppress it. Breathe through your nose. Proceed.” John sucked and started to bop his head. Sherlock was impressively large, had a massive cock. Soon his eyes started to water, his jaw hurt and he drooled around his penis. Sherlock looked down and became even harder.
In the meantime, both Mycroft and Rogers were racing over the beach. There were only a few people who watched them and he had a great time. They stopped after a while and waited for Greg. Mycroft looked quite a bit dishevelled and even Rogers did. He was still shielding him all the time. Mycroft used the time to enquire about their rooms and other things.
A few weeks later John had moved in and occupied the upstairs room of Sherlock’s flat. Sherlock was happy and so was John. They didn’t want to talk about love or such but they felt great in each other’s presence. They had great sex and John wasn’t even limping anymore. He even had started to blog for real. He wrote about Sherlock’s cases and Sherlock enjoyed being praised like that.
“I had the weirdest dream. I dreamt of Greg and Mycroft.” Sherlock chuckled.
John chuckled.
“This remains to be seen.” Sherlock replied and made a beeline around the tree to reach his bedroom. The door banged close and the wall shook.
He came back out from under the blanket and licked his lips. He sat on his heels on the bed and his dom pulled him down by his hair.
“Perhaps you should talk to him.” Sherlock thoughtfully said.
“I am not betraying Gregory. I love him. But I need to know.” He seemed more relaxed now and stood.
“I wondered if I had exaggerated but you looked so peaceful. I am glad you are ok.” He sounded relieved.
Sherlock was paralysed. He couldn’t move. He could only stare. John’s head was bloody and so was his face. His shirt was torn and he had lost one loafer.
“Kneel!” He yelled into his ear. Sherlock was a dom and therefore didn't flinch. He simply knelt. He wanted to avoid any provocations.
He even felt better and woke up completely. The burning pain from the welts on his back kept him alert. He brushed his teeth under the shower and afterwards John applied some ointment on his welts and bruises.
“Leave me the fuck alone!” He approached him and stared into his eyes.
“As you wish.” Greg poured the wine and filled the nuts into a provided bowl from the bar. He brought everything back and sat with him. He watched him sipping the wine and crunching on some nuts. He didn’t speak though.
“Excuse me? Was this a
“Have a look into my bag to the right. I know you wondered why I have brought three bags. Well, one bag isn’t meant for clothes.” He smirked clinking the cuffs.
Greg was able to swear via text and Sherlock pulled a face. He owed him and he knew it.
“Sherlock?” John asked moving around. His head hung low and John knelt down to look into his face.
“I will be right with you.” He returned to his sub and cuffed his arms in the front. He hooked him up so he stood stretched out. The heels were still on his feet and the corsage still sat tight around his waist. A spreader-bar connected his ankles and was hooked to the floor.
“Mr Holmes, Dr Watson, welcome to Wilshire Hall. Please, follow me inside.” He turned around and, on his way, up there; another man came out and took the car keys from him.
“I already knew you were special.” Sherlock took John’s hand and pulled him back into his arms. He huskily whispered into his ear.
“You may pamper me after having tried something new in bed.” They locked eyes.
“Perhaps we should have tested it on Anderson.” Sherlock thought and let his fantasies run wild.
“Now, Sherlock, I'll leave you be for now. But I will be back. Take a rest, you will be needing your strength!” They left and Sherlock looked at the closed door. The pain kept pulsing through his body but he knew this was only the easy part.
“It’s because of our bond and because you are mental.”
“He threw me out.” Ian told him.
“I think he realised how close it was this time. And he regretted something he didn’t do before.”
“This is not London.” He said and yawned. John grinned.
“Yes, much better now.” He reached out for him and was pulled up. They kissed again, slowly, and languidly. Sherlock moved his lips over his throat and neck looking for his jugular. He sucked on the spot and then bit down. John moaned and closed his eyes again. It didn't even hurt. Sherlock suckled for several minutes and John's head fell back. He blacked out.
They left him alone for more than one hour. Then he got a rather friendly slap on his arse.
But his mind also made him even more attractive. Sexier. He very much wanted to fuck him right here and now.
He knew though he had to help his dom going through the motions. Distract Sergej with his actions.
“Of course, I can hear you thinking. Your facial expressions are obvious.” Sherlock insisted.
“Are you all clean and proper?” John asked when Sherlock knelt in front of him.
Sebastian returned home to James Moriarty who sat on his recliner as if it was a throne. He still looked sick, his hair was a mess and he was wearing pyjamas and also one of Sebastian’s old tees.
“Well, well, John. I can’t tolerate that kind of behaviour. I think you need to be taught a lesson.”
Only then he walked upstairs. He saw it kneeling on the hardwood with the dress draped around him. His hair was still open and his hands were folded on his nape beneath it. Simply perfect.
“This is Mycroft Holmes speaking. I would like to set up an appointment.”
“I can see you are restless. What do you want to do?” Sherlock took his hand.
“I will be very boring, I am afraid.” He said suppressing a yawn already.
“If what?” John raised a brow. Sherlock swallowed.
“You don't get it, do you?” He shook his head.
The only thing he could do was wait. Wait for his brother to rescue him.
“Are you sure?” He quietly asked.
“I have a doctor in several fields such as medicine, surgery, chemistry, biology and even psychology. Never mind history and politics.” Greg's eyes widened again. He actually was in awe.
“Tonight, I will eat a lot.” He said all of a sudden and Greg grinned.
“What was that?” He asked dangerously quiet.
Lucky him Sherlock had to slow down due to construction work. He almost looked angry but rode slowly and orderly through everything.
Mycroft shook and whimpered by now and this was a sound Greg would never forget. Never.
Mycroft explained his problem and Sherlock actually did have an answer.
“Always…” Sherlock rasped out and closed his eyes again. John frowned.
John kept him on edge for what felt like hours. After a while, Sherlock had to rest his head on the mattress but John kept going until he finally came. He couldn’t control his body anymore and pressed back up, pressed his arse into John’s face and screamed his lungs out when he became undone.
“I love you very much. Let's go and get the food.” They looked at each other. Mycroft simply smiled.
“I am not lazy…” Sherlock muttered. “I am simply resourceful with my strength.” John laughed loudly.
“What's up? Do you want to leave?” Mycroft longingly looked at Greg.
“If you say so?” He turned away. Sherlock looked at his back.
When he returned from the bath, freshly showered, and cleaned out, he found the man and at once dropped down on his knees.
“Well, shouldn’t we have a look upstairs?” He was giving Sherlock the opportunity to take over. Someone must have briefed him very thoroughly.
Greg sighed. Mycroft was just like Sherlock. And since he knew what Sherlock would have wanted but never said, he expected the same here.
When he returned out of the bath only clad in his birthday-suit Moriarty licked his lips.
“We are rather close. He stayed with me for a longer period of time when he had just gotten off the drugs. He didn’t want to stay with his brother and he knew he wouldn’t manage to stay on his own. So, he stayed with me. I agreed because my wife had just left and I was so alone.”
“You feel like a bloody virgin, bitch. You are so tight.” He groaned and kept slapping him while he pushed faster and faster into him. He dished out no pleasure, he never touched his prostate. He just hurt him. He shot his load into him and quickly pulled out making it hurt a lot.
“Jesus!” John thought and closed his eyes. He tried to relax. He was not gay. Wasn’t he?
“Yes, actually I did. But I feel bad about it because I did it without my dom present. He will be angry with me...”
“No, it is not. It shows me how deeply you care and I almost feel sorry for having been so hard on you.” Greg replied. The words made him look up and into Greg’s open face again.
“Yes, of course you will. We talked about it. Eight o'clock sharp. See you later.” Sherlock carefully touched Ian's hand and smiled.
“Make an educated guess, John.” Sherlock pulled the blanket from the back of their sofa because he was cold now after having eaten the ice cream.
„I do know that. But you were on top of me and opening my trousers. You were holding me down and wouldn't listen to me. I know you thought it was a game but it wasn't.“ Sherlock buried his face into his hands.
Then, all of a sudden, John coordinated his moves and at the same time twisted his nipple, bit into his testicle, and pinched the head of his cock.
His brother actually wanted him happy and wanted him to have a companion, a friend, even a boyfriend.
“Are you feeling better?” Sherlock quietly asked. John hummed.
“What I always do. I am cooking some lunch.” John looked over his shoulder but Sherlock wouldn't meet his eyes.
And John saw everything. His eyes slanted while he listened to Sherlock. God, his voice did that to him. He became aroused. Hard and erect. And Sherlock talked not realising what was going on in front of him.
“Kneel!” He suddenly yelled and Sherlock instantly fell down. The man stepped up and so did John.
“You look like you are going to be sick, Sherlock.” John sounded sceptical.
“OK, that’s nice. And what else?”
A technician checked why the mobiles hadn’t worked and found something was disturbing the signal. He found the transmitter by scanning the area and switched it off. He bagged it to have it examined.
“You said, he is a weapon by himself. We have to be careful. Several of your men need to take care of him while I snatch Sherlock away.” Greg said.
“Very well. Captain Watson, Mr Holmes, could you please wait over there for the police?”
He whimpered from behind the gag. John let go of his cock and took the blindfold off. He needed the look out of these bleary, teary eyes. Only when he started to wail and wouldn’t open his eyes anymore, John let him come. He pressed on his prostate, rubbed over it, while at the same time he pulled and pressed his cock.
He turned his body and pulled his legs under getting on his knees and out of Sherlock’s hold.
“You were jealous.”
“Yes, Master.” He answered hoarsely. He wondered if he could convince the man to buy him. He said his last personal slave had died. So, he must need a new one, right?
“Yes, but only because I met Greg and he stopped me. I was sad when you threw me out. I didn't understand.”
Finally, he realised that he needed a wash and a visit to the loo. He slowly stood and entered the bathroom. He showered and washed his hair. He hissed when the foam ran over his welts and bruises. John had only superficially taken care of his wounds and Sherlock hadn’t minded. Now he paid the price.
“Does it speak other languages?”
“Very well done, Anthea. I will tell the others. Thank you.” He hung up. She really was the best.
Ian thought he had the graze of a cat, a very large cat. And he smiled. God, he wasn't just falling love, he already was in love with the man.
Now he held a list with things John wanted. Needed. Whatever. He had written two lists. Probably divided into low and high shelves. Sherlock snickered but didn’t show it.
“Yes, DI Gregory Lestrade.”
“I must have been good then.” He grinned and his words were soon enough confirmed.
His brother surely wasn't worried about him, was he?
He returned into the main room and found Sherlock just closing the door. Then he watched him carefully hanging up the garment bags. First, he took John’s with the uniform and really handled it very carefully. John had to smile.
“Pray tell what you want. I am out of my depth already.” Mycroft poured a whiskey and only when Greg cleared his throat, he handed a tumbler over to him, too.
Inside the bath Greg quickly and quietly opened the door to the bedroom. His eyes widened when he found the former bedroom gone. All the details that had been simply Sherlock were gone. This was a brothel, a Victorian brothel, with many implements being used for BDSM.
“You know how to reach me. Do it without hesitation, understood?”
“If you don’t like it, I could buy another one?” But John shook his head.
Sherlock licked a long stripe over his neck making him shiver and moan. Sherlock pressed his lips between his neck and shoulder-blade and sucked. He marked him and would leave a bruise. John felt his guts coil and his spine tingle.
“You really care for him, don’t you?” Sherlock nodded.
“But you will certainly be present?” He asked.
“Who made you a vampire?” Mycroft chuckled.
“How do you even know that John is renting him out?” She held his searching eyes and just stared back. Then she sighed.
“You do love him, don’t you?” John once sobbed but nodded.
“John, you may get up now. Hold it and proceed as being told. I will be waiting outside.” He took the empty bag and binned it. Then he grabbed his clothes and left the bathroom.
“We agreed on that. I won’t just change the rules I agreed to. Please, don’t be scared about it.” Sherlock relaxed again.
Sherlock stumbled a few steps through the room until he bumped against a wall. He used it to rub off the blindfold and now John was almost shocked. He had never witnessed such behaviour. He had had panicked subs but not like this. He slowly followed Sherlock and let him do what he needed. And then he would punish him.
“Oh…” John made a weird sound.
“I wondered if you’d go out again. I felt, I hoped, you would stay because I didn’t want to be alone.” Sherlock quietly said moving deeper into the sofa. John turned his head.
“Yes?” He tilted his head while Mycroft clung to the hem of the blanket.
“Sure, I'll be right back.” John heated a mug of blood for him and spiced it. For himself he made a tea. He carried both back and set them on the night-stand. Sherlock took his mug and held it. He stared into it for several seconds before he started to talk.
He wondered how long it would take him or if he would even manage.
“Tomorrow you will have your own room to work in.” Sherlock smiled.
“I need to talk to you.” Ian finally said worrying his lips. Sherlock sipped his wine and leant back into his chair.
“Why?” It was the only word that came to mind.
“Don’t worry, I know him. It’s all fine, you pay next time.”
The 'obviously’ implied at the end of the sentence is an indication enough for John to open the box without muttering another word. It holds a pair of high-quality tan leather shoes in a size perfect for his feet. John abruptly removes his own shoes to try this exquisite foot wear while Sherlock side-eyes the whole procedure with pretended disinterest.
He sets Sherlock’s head back, covers his eyes and with his right hand, picks up the syringe. Slowly, he injects the required amount of local anesthetic solution into the most posterior part of his maxilla on both sides. Sherlock feels a slight pinch for a moment but relaxes back down immediately. He lowers the syringe and places it into the used instruments tray.
Sherlock almost runs outside into the waiting area and drops his head into his hands. That was not how the plan was supposed to execute. How on earth can
Linda walks in a second later and after having one look at him, she raises an inquisitive brow. John shrugs as if nothing happened. She seems unconvinced but doesn’t dwells further. Once the setup to carry out the procedure is complete, John retracts Sherlock’s mouth and begins with the surgery. During the whole procedure, Sherlock remains quiet except for making a few irritated sounds. He has known the man for nearly 10 minutes but by God, does John misses his sinful voice.
'Oh no no no. That is gonna take about an hour and I am already desperate to get out of here. Besides, my shift is over. Mike will be here in a minute. Ask him to handle this.'
John finally huffs a breath of relief as the last patient walks out of the door. Three cases of restorations, one root canal and extraction of mandibular second premolars for orthodontic treatment. Overall, it had been a dull shift but he was more than eager to welcome the indulging scents of coffee and cinnamon for a change.
‘Right. The impaction isn’t so deep so it wouldn’t take so long. But just for the safe side, I will need to inject a long-acting anesthetic drug.’
John inches back a little with a wide grin on his face. He looks into Sherlock's eyes which are lushed with a haze as if he has been drugged again.
'Uhm...I...I have pain in my lower jaw that only occurs at night.'
The urge to smooth away every edge of his broken skin overtakes him. He lightly kisses that spot again and again and with every kiss, there is a silent whisper of
'You bet Lestrade that I can’t flirt. So I am trying to “
The only thing he comes up with is a 'Thank you.' He snatches the paper from John's hand and turns to stomp outside.
'What's the case?'
'Impacted maxillary third molars.' John shakes his head.
Sherlock lies on his couch the next evening and mulls over the idea of reciprocating John’s gesture. He should buy a gift for John too to portray his thankfulness but the lack of experience in such a field proves to be troublesome. A quick scan through his mind palace becomes insufficient since John already has almost everything of general use. He turns over in a rather irritated fashion and tries all over again.
He draws near to Sherlock and in a low whisper, asks him about his current state to check the level of his verbal responses. Sherlock halts. He turns towards him and taking advantage of their closeness, nuzzles his nose against John’s. A slow, drowsy drag across the side of his nose and cheek as if he is drawing patterns into John’s skin. John stops breathing.
It starts off as a chaste kiss, but Sherlock delves in for more. John is caught so off-guard that he stills at once. He captures John’s upper lip between his own and struggles to suck it but is unable to do so. Both his lips and tongue feel heavy. A disgruntled sound leaves his mouth. He tries again and fails. He looks up at John with a frown to understand this mystery.

Just one last time, he assures himself. Its been a whole week since he had his extraction done but for some reason, he cannot forget about that dentist. The worse part is that he remembers everything, down to the touch of his lips against his own.
- - - - - - - - -
He didn’t stay long but it was enough for Sherlock to formulate at least 13 different deductions about the man, each one of them peculiar from the other. Fascinating.
Sherlock slowly opens his eyes and sees a slideshow of emotions running over John’s face. There is guilt, concern, grief, embarrassment but most of all, there is
'So Sherlock. What can I do for you?' His tone is laced with professionalism. Sherlock's heart sinks. Maybe John doesn't remember anything at all or maybe it was just a dream, he thinks.
'Oh yes of course.'
It’s more of a breathy exhale than a name, like he has finally come to life. John stops dead in his track. Somehow his other hand had reached up to hold Sherlock’s face from one side and now he is standing too close to him, his lips an inch away from Sherlock’s. The cold air released from Sherlock’s mouth rushes over his own when the realization hits him.
‘Sherlock, please.’ John looks up at him and clears his throat again.
‘Alright. But be careful.’
‘So you’ve never been to a dentist before, I gather?’
Succumbing to an uncontrollable impulse, he raises a hand and his fingers graze against the damaged skin of Sherlock’s eyebrow in a feather-light touch. Sherlock freezes instantly and his lids drop with the weight of pain that has nothing to do with the wound on his eyebrow.
Sherlock just stares at him. He endeavours to come up with something. Something that would make John understand that he likes him. That he has been thinking about him for a whole damn week. That the only pain which keeps him up at nights is the time he has to endure without John now that he has met him.
(See the end of the chapter for

John figures it would be a better idea to focus on the surgical procedure instead before this man gets anymore beguiling for him to handle. He takes a good look at his radiograph to determine the extent of impaction and association with other anatomical structures.
John nods as if he totally understands this made-up problem. He picks up a sterilized mouth mirror from his operating table and asks Sherlock to open his mouth. He does as told. Although he worries that John might be able to hear his loud beating chest from this close proximity. John examines his oral cavity and is not entirely surprised to find everything normal.
'Helping you make a decision. Isn’t it obvious?’ John huffs.
'I am not, dear. That X-ray clearly shows that you need to get it extracted. I remember I got my wisdom teeth removed when I was only 18. Unbearably painful. Ah!'
‘Sherlock Holmes and flirting? I think you’ve drunk way too much, mate.’ Lestrade puts down his glass and cackles over John’s remark.
As soon as he steps into the shoes, his height raises a considerable amount and he rubs his feet against the sole to find out why. The shoes are extra padded in the heel region to add a few inches to the height of its wearer without causing discomfort.
‘How are you feeling Mr. Holmes? Oh, you’re not allowed to speak yet. Just nod or shake your head. Are you still feeling disoriented?’ Sherlock nods.
‘Does it hurt?’

'But Dr. Stamford is not available tonight. He called half an hour ago to inform that he has a family emergency so he won't be able to make it. And I wouldn't insist but-' She leans in closer and brings down her volume to a hushed tone. '-that man out there? He definitely needs a checkup. And after he's done here, I might even refer him to a mental health specialist. God. He is a menace. He has already brought two patients on the brink of tears and if you delay it anymore Dr. Watson, he's gonna turn this place upside-down.'
'Dr. Watson. I've come... I've come for another check up.' is all that leaves his mouth.
The surgery takes about 25 minutes and finally after extracting a small piece of root, John places gauze against the wound on both sides. He increases the concentration of oxygen to reverse the effect of nitrous oxide.
'Well that was a first.’ John remarks in a playful tone when he has gained his senses back. Sherlock cracks a private smile and just stares at the ruffled state of his lover. It’s an endearing sight to witness Captain John Watson flushed upto the tip of his ears.
Quietly, the man gathers him into his arms and just like that, the dam he had been building around himself for years breaks open. He shatters all over again and his entire being gives up. But the man makes him lie down across himself and holds him close not to let a single piece fall away. Once he has broken down completely, that man picks each one of his pieces and mends it back with the touch of his fingers and the caress of his lips. He melts into this familiar warmth and after a long enough time, breathes. Instead of the rustic smell of blood and dust, it is a scent of all things beautiful. Like love and hope and laughter. John smiles. A long-wretched soldier has finally arrived
'Mmm. New cologne? Smells good.’ He steps back with a satisfied grin and walks away just like that, completely oblivious to John’s frantic heart rate.
'Alright Linda. I am about to take off. Make sure Mike rechecks the history of Mrs. Waltham again. I don't want another patient lying on my chair the next morning.'
‘Why can’t…mmm.. I kishh you John..’ He pouts. John puffs out a hot breath.
It’s been twenty minutes and he still can’t decide the right dress to wear at his colleague’s upcoming wedding. Standing in front of the mirror in the living room, he places another shirt against his front.
Sherlock casts a look at John and sits back with a smug grin, extremely pleased with himself. John knits his brows together and releases the breath he had been unconsciously holding.
Sherlock is holding an elegant silver box showcasing a set of black cuff links with the organic structure of adrenaline molecule carved on it. He is at a loss of words to precisely explain how besotted he is by such a meaningful gesture.
, John thinks and rises on his tiptoes to kiss that hurt spot.
‘Sherlock I have to examine your teeth before I start anything. This is just a mouth mirror.’ He holds up the said instrument for his confirmation. Sherlock relaxes a bit though John can still notice a tense line across his shoulders.
John steps out of the bathroom all flushed when he accidentally collides with a yawning Sherlock.
A corner of his mouth twitches up into a genuine smile. He folds the prescription and places it safely in his front pocket. For the first time in his life, he is actually looking forward to relish a dessert without caring. Why would he? He needn't worry about visiting another dentist again. Not when he has gotten one of his own.
‘Ah! Mr. Holmes. You may put your documents aside and seat yourself on the dental chair. I’ll be right with you in a minute.’
. He raises his other hand and gently ruffles through Sherlock’s wild curls. Sherlock snuggles deeper into his palm. John rubs his thumb across his cheekbone in a soothing manner. Lost in the trance of this adorable man-child, he forgets that he needs to dial down the concentration of nitrous oxide. He keeps massaging Sherlock’s scalp until a minute later, the realization hits him.
Mrs. Husdon shrugs off her memories and focuses back on the stubborn man in front of her who is forever reluctant to care about his own self.
John writes down a prescription of necessary antibiotics and painkillers and hands it over to Sherlock. He gives him detailed instructions about post-operative wound management and by the end of it, Sherlock gets frustrated enough to just walk out of the place without gazing back. John calls after him but too late. Sherlock had already gotten into a cab which drives away just as he steps onto the kerb. To say that he feels utterly defeated would be an understatement. He lets out an exasperated sigh and walks back into his office.
A canon-compliant of The Hug scene from the lying detective.
John does a futile attempt to rub away the wetness on his face and looks up at Sherlock with bleary eyes. Sherlock’s gaze is blooming with concern and something else. Something he has seen before many times but it never hit him before like it does at this moment. One of his eye is displaying the colors of an abstract art. Black, blue,
'Oh - ouch.’ Sherlock runs to him and grasps his left hand to inspect the damage. He trails his fingertips over the scalded areas of the back of his hand upto his forearm, without uttering a word. John hisses into the quietness as he touches a tender spot and Sherlock’s eyes flinch in a way as if he is the one who got burnt. He switches his attention to the left side of John’s face without really meeting his eyes. John stills under his scrutinizing gaze. It’s so delightfully unsettling to be the sole focus of this glorious being that John forgets all about the dreadfulness of this night.
John, he hardly needs to be the only consulting detective in the world to draw the final conclusion.
‘Piss off.’ John breaks into another fit of giggles.
'Is that what this was all about?’ The mirth in his voice is barely concealable as he brings himself closer to Sherlock. John raises and rubs his nose against Sherlock’s scrunched one in a slow and deliberate motion, while murmuring
Sherlock’s face lit up with excitement at the news.  “I was under the impression that Muggles couldn’t even approach Hogwarts, let alone enter it.”
John took his hand and gave it a squeeze before stepping in front of everyone.  The room quickly fell silent except for Cecelia humming to herself as she lay on her stomach on the floor, kicking her feet and colouring with Thor at her side.  Everyone else watched John expectantly and Sherlock placed himself close to John’s side for reassurance.
“Don’t worry about that, Mycroft can take care of whatever might be involved.”
Teddy grinned in return.  “I do not pity anyone who has to deal with a metamorphmagus child.  It was bad enough when I had temper tantrums later on; I can’t even imagine what it was like when you couldn’t even ask me what was wrong because I wasn’t old enough to talk.”
“Two wars,” Sherlock mumbled, and John could feel him shaking through their linked hands.  “My God, John, no wonder you were such a mess when we met.”
They made it as far as the edge of the Forbidden Forest before Sherlock pulled them to a stop.  They stood panting just where the trees met the open grass of the grounds, Sherlock squinting to try and see into the growing darkness.  Once John caught his breath, he placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to get his attention.
before trotting down the stairs, his thoughts more on Sherlock than the park.
“Are you trying to tell me I can’t take my beautiful boyfriend out for dinner without a specific reason?”  Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the tops of his cheeks turned pink.
“Yeah, this is Sherlock.”  John’s face warmed at Molly’s words.  “Sherlock, this is Molly Weasley, Ron’s mother.”
She nodded reluctantly and returned her attention to her bee on her lap.  John looked back up to find Albus and his friend with their heads bent together talking.  Before he could do more than open his mouth, Sherlock stated, “Yes, that’s his friend Scorpius Malfoy.  I’m surprised we’ve never met him before, given – “
“When’s the last time you ate?” John asked in a low voice as Sherlock lowered himself to sit cross-legged on the couch.  His eyes remained fixed on Cecelia’s head poking out from the silver and black fabric Sherlock had chosen himself.  The wrap was one of various necessities that came from an overly invested Sherlock in the months leading up to Cecelia’s birth.  He dove himself into dedicating all of his free time towards baby research until he was satisfied that Baby Watson would only have the best.  The wrap, a shimmering black that almost appeared dark blue, was spotted with stars echoing the night sky and had been one of the more useful items Sherlock purchased during his enthusiasm.
He found the helmet next.  Wedged into the back of the hallway cupboard, John usually ignored the black shape, hidden away amongst the chaos, and ought to have so now as he searched for the pile of new towels Mrs. Hudson had brought up earlier in the week.  This time, however, the sheen of it from the light behind him forced him to lean back down and pull it out.  It was a helmet, completely black, with slick lines and an even darker plate of semitransparent shielding across the front.  Once he had a proper look at it, he realized the finish was a duller matte than the shine of the light made it out to be, but it had been cleaned to remove even the slightest edge of a fingerprint.  Though he’d never seen it before, John could tell it was used and used often.
“Sherlock, hold on.”  When John entered the sitting room, Sherlock instantly froze in his desperate search.  His eyes were wide in a combination of hope and confusion and sought out John’s.  “Babe, I really don’t think this is the sort of conversation that should be had on the phone.”
“That’s not part of the deal,” Kit muttered down at his nails, making his boredom with the entire situation clear. Michael laughed again, with a hint of sheepishness, and shifted just enough to block Kit from John’s view.
Her eyes grew wide in surprise and she glanced around before realising that Sherlock meant for her to approach.  She tentatively walked over and he patted the stool next to him, waiting patiently for her to sit.  When she did, he passed his mobile to her and began to explain it in depth.  She ran a finger over the buttons, her mouth round in fascination, and they quickly drew a crowd of interested bystanders.  His sandwich forgotten, Sherlock explained to the small group the purposes of his mobile and his hopes to eventually make it work in the magical world.
Shockingly the flat appeared much as it always was.  The clutter, organized in precisely the way that Sherlock saw fit, still lay scattered throughout the room, the scull still on the mantle, the furniture amazingly intact.  Sherlock himself was buzzing with restless energy, just finishing buttoning his suit jacket as John entered.  He paused in his pacing when he noticed John, currently stormy grey eyes lighting with excitement.
“We should probably let her sleep,” John whispered, his voice hoarse.  Sherlock lowered his leg while nodding, but he kept his fierce grip on John’s jumper.  Pulling him to the door, John fumbled briefly to turn out the light without looking or breaking too far away from Sherlock.  The corner of his mouth cricked up in a wicked grin as he pulled the door shut.  He ran his eyes up and down the full length of Sherlock’s body, pulling him against him to speak directly into his ear.  “Care to move this somewhere more comfortable?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“How’s your skin feel?” John asked, breaking the comfortable silence. Sherlock picked up his fingerprinting kit and used the brush to apply a bit of powder to the handle, letting out a hum of acknowledgement.
Shaking his head, Sherlock moved to John’s side and began preparing his own tea.  “You haven’t…I got distracted and fell asleep in the rocking chair.  It was nothing you did.”
“Your turn now,” John muttered as he adjusted his balance and brought one of his hands up to Sherlock’s cock. He squeezed it around the base just a little too tight and Sherlock whined, his Adam’s apple bobbing close to John’s mouth as he swallowed. “You’ve been tempting me for the last hour now, you gorgeous thing, and I deserve to see you come apart.”
Or perhaps our first,
Eventually his growling stomach and aching feet forced him to find a pub to rest and eat. He wanted to give Sherlock space to himself before returning, not to mention make sure he wouldn’t just walk into their room and kiss him before he had to face him again. As he waited for his food, he sent Sherlock a few texts, apologising for interrupting him and reassuring him that it was all fine. Sherlock didn’t respond, though John didn’t expect him to. He couldn’t imagine how Sherlock was feeling; John knew he would be at least slightly horrified if their roles were reversed.
Sherlock easily worked one finger into him and moved on to two, an expression of focus similar to when he was close to the end of a case on his face. John centred all of his attention on watching Sherlock’s expressions, hoping to calm his raging body by focusing on him instead. It worked until Sherlock’s finger brushed John’s prostate. John let out the groan he’d been holding and Sherlock smiled in triumph, watching John as he massaged the gland carefully. His hips jumped up with every shift of Sherlock’s hand, rubbing John’s cockhead just barely against Sherlock’s stomach every time. Each movement was just enough to tease John a little bit more, causing him to let out barely audible whines each time it happened.
He’d only started at the clinic about a month before, enough time that he was beginning to get comfortable with his coworkers but not enough that he felt as though he could say no when the boss asked him a favour.  When Sarah started to throw out random comments throughout the week about decorating for Christmas, John knew he would inevitably end up being asked to help in some way.  He tried to keep mostly to himself while at work, friendly if approached but without actively seeking out companionship, but Sarah in particular had grown attached to him over the few short weeks.  Consequently, when John’s lunch hour came around that Friday and he heard a knock on his door, he suspected it would have something to do with her plots from earlier in the week.
“It is, and it will be.”  When Sherlock continued to stare down at the floor, John came to his side and wrapped an arm around him, reaching up to kiss him below his ear.  “You’ll get there.  You’ve barely done any spells before, Sherlock, and I just asked you to do a NEWT level one.  You can’t be expected to master all of it right away.  That’s why we’re going to work on it together, yeah?”
“Not anyone, not really,” John explained.  Sherlock picked up the bag John put down and brought it into the kitchen, John following.  “There are Apparation shields as part of the protection I put up around the flat.  Unless given permission, there’s only a handful of people who can Apparate in or out of the flat, and even then if it’s not either of us, an alarm will go off to let us know it’s happening.”  When Sherlock glanced at him, he shrugged and shot him a tiny grin.  “I put you on it too, figuring we’d get you set up with a license for it eventually.  If you want.”
Mouth gaping open, John snorted out a disbelieving laugh.  “That was…fuck, that was brilliant.  You’re amazing at that, whatever it was.”
Sherlock nodded, but his mouth and the bridge of his nose were contorted into a frown.  “Yes.  I didn’t expect to feel so emotional over leaving, particularly since we’ll be back.”
“Hello dove,” Mummy said, rising to her feet to hug Sherlock.  He accepted it without comment, proving to John that he was more affected by the conversation about to take place than he let on.  She smiled when she spotted John and pulled him into his own hug, surprising yet delighting him.  “How are you doing, John?  How’s your little one?  Settling back into Baker Street well?”
“I wouldn’t expect that to be what you really want to know.”  Mycroft turned and the brothers’ eyes finally met.  “What did you learn?”
Guyssss this is the end!  It's been such a fun run with y'all, but the conclusion of a long fic is always both exhilarating and depressing.  But good news, I have plans for at least three one shots in this universe (two that take place prior to the series and one set not long after Dissendium) and I'll once again be using November of (hopefully) this year to write the next story in the series, Prior Incantato!  Until then, you can always find me on tumblr at futureofthemasses, and I hope you enjoyed.  :)
Breathing deeply, John nodded.  “Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Flip around and lay down, yeah?”
“A Squib, of course,” John huffed, losing the battle with himself to run his hand through his hair.  “So which family are you from?  If you’re dishonoured, it’s got to be one of the ones that think they’re better than everyone else.  I swear to God if you end up being a direct relative of Mary’s…”
Sherlock attempted to shoot her a smile, but it ended up turning out to be more of a grimace.  “Thank you, Minerva.”  With a final nod of thanks from John, they began to make their way slowly back to the hospital wing.  Sherlock expected John to take him directly to the wing to see to him and was surprised when he unlocked the door to their flat instead.  He led Sherlock to the sofa and pulled down the blanket that normally rested along its back, draping it over Sherlock’s shoulders before guiding him to sit.  Placing a kiss on his forehead, he headed into the kitchen to make them tea and allow Sherlock to have a moment alone to collect himself.
“Go ahead, it’s all set up in the kitchen.”  John shuffled over to place a kiss on Sherlock’s lips as the kids raced in to get their food.  “Your gift is beautiful.  Did you do it all yourself?”
Snapping the book shut, Sherlock shoved it aside onto the table and pressed himself into John’s space.  “Yes!  What did you have in mind?”
Gazing across the room seemingly in thought, Sherlock absentmindedly tugged at the rope. “I’ll use Vatican cameos again, although I doubt I’ll use it.”
Despite himself, Sherlock felt his mouth gape open in shock.  He’d known that John’s parents were dead, but beyond that, there was little John would share about them beyond very passing comments.   This new bit of knowledge of John’s past raced through the pathways of his mind palace into the area reserved specifically for John, filed carefully into the gradually growing folder regarding John’s childhood.  His forehead furrowed in consideration as his mouth closed into a tight, thin line.  “Mudblood…obviously derogatory, meant as an insult, most likely in regard to the individual’s upbringing or lineage…but I’ve studied your family tree, John, there is no obvious reason why any of the typical prejudice groups of society would be inclined to insult your – John!”  Sherlock was interrupted by John jumping to his feet and dashing towards the Leaky Cauldron.  “John, what on Earth – “
John slipped it back into his pocket and licked his lips, wondering how best to guide the rest of the conversation. Deciding that bluntness would be best, he cleared his throat to catch Sherlock’s attention. “You’re aware of what we’re doing tonight?”
“Sorry,” Sherlock muttered, though there wasn’t much apology in his tone. Almost immediately he leaned back down to run his tongue down the middle of John’s breastbone. John’s reply stuck in his throat for a moment and he unconsciously sunk both hands into Sherlock’s hair.
Before anyone could reply, the doors opened to reveal a slightly chaotic office.  Desks were ordered into a seemingly consistent pattern, but it looked as though the various papers and materials sitting across them were strewn about carelessly, allowing them to be easily shared amongst workers.  Chatter echoed through the long room, occasionally broken up by a random shout or laughter.  The three visitors were mostly ignored as Mycroft led them through a path between desks, earning the occasional glance but passed over for whatever task was more important.  John nearly had to drag Sherlock away from the desks they passed, his interest constantly distracted by the potential magical cases.  The office, besides the occasional burst of magic, reminded John of New Scotland Yard, causing a rolling sense of comfortable purpose to settle in his shoulders.  With a hand firmly pressed into the small of Sherlock’s back, he shoved the man forward until they reached Harry’s office.
“Not now, Cecelia, the feast’s about to start,” John said in a stern voice.  He relented slightly when her shoulders slumped and wrapped his arm around her.  “We’ll try to find all of them after, okay?”
Nodding, Sherlock led them both down the stairs to collect more of the bags.  In a few minutes, they had a pile of luggage congregated in the middle of the sitting room.  Sherlock stood beside his armchair, arms crossed over his chest as he studied the bags as though they were one of his cases to be solved, before kneeling down and starting to open one of them.  When he gaped down into it and realized its size belayed little of its depth, he frowned up at John in stunned confusion.
“This isn’t the only scar I need to worship,” he murmured, situating Sherlock so that he sat between his legs with his back to John’s front.  For a long and quiet moment, John simply stared down at him, taking in the massacred skin.  He had seen the jagged marks a handful of times since Sherlock’s return, but this was the first time he focused on them.  They never talked about how they happened, for both of their preferences, yet John wanted to turn their memories into something more pleasant like what Sherlock had done with his own scar.  He leaned forward to rest his forehead against the back of Sherlock’s neck, his face just close enough for the nape hairs to tickle, and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist tightly.  Sherlock raised his arms to rest over John’s, his hands settling on top of his.
The box remained still on the table, the rest of the shop equally unaffected.  Sherlock lowered the wand with a heavy arm and set it on the counter.  His face remained blank in an attempt at indifference, but John saw his fist clench and release at his side, an echo of the same motion John did when agitated.  Ollivander either didn’t notice or chose to ignore it as he placed the wand back in its box.
“My mum’s favourite.  There’s a forest right next to Hogwarts and these are the only Muggle developed plant to thrive on their own in there.  They don’t have a particular purpose in any spells, but I always saw Sprout giving them a particular spot of attention when she saw a bush of them.  Even if they’re not useful, they’re fine to look at, and always remind me of my two homes, in the Muggle world as well as the wizarding one.”
He eventually found the classroom, the all black door stark against the cream of the corridor walls.  Before knocking, he peered in through the window to search for Olivia.  Her tawny head popped up in the far corner, waving a book in her hand and talking avidly with three of her classmates.  John smiled to himself and rapped his knuckles on the door, quickly ducking out of view in case Olivia looked his way.
“I’d hate to disappoint you by acting too out of character,” Sherlock replied with a small grin.  Ginny eyed them with raised brows, a tiny smile curling at the edge of her lips.  Mycroft merely smirked before setting a delicate hand on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry gave Ginny a quick peck on the cheek before turning to John.
When John woke the next morning, it was to a bed devoid of Sherlock Holmes.  He might have thought Sherlock simply had gotten up before him, but his side of the bed was exactly the same as when John fell asleep the night before.  He stood and stretched out his spine, stopping to finally turn out the light before making his way out into the rest of the flat.  Sherlock wasn’t in the kitchen or the sitting room, so after setting the kettle on its pedestal to boil, he started up the stairs to check for him in Cecelia’s room.
,” Sherlock sighed and fell back on him so they were connected once more.  Neither paid much attention to how long they stood in the clearing snogging, thestrals butting occasionally at their elbows in a bid for attention, but eventually John forced them apart.  Sherlock’s eyebrows knit in confusion, but he was reassured by the warm expression on John’s face.  With a nudge of his head back in the direction of the castle and a confident grasp of his hand, John led them back up to the school.
“Seriously, love, are you okay?” John asked, cupping Sherlock’s face so he could guide it up and look into his eyes.  “You’re acting strange tonight and it’s freaking me out a bit.”
Doyle shrugged his free shoulder, a broad grin spread across his face.  He gave them a mock bow, yanking at Cecelia’s arm in the process.  “Fletcher Jones, at your service.  I knew you would figure it out eventually.”
The bonding came back to John easily and he worked at a measured pace, checking with Sherlock on every tightened knot with either a glance or a squeeze to his hip or thigh. Sherlock moved with him perfectly, realising which design John had chosen quickly and predicting John’s movements. On his fifth knot down Sherlock’s front, John shuffled around to face him to work around his cock and balls. He decided not to remove Sherlock’s pants, both to preserve some of his modesty and to create additional friction against his groin. With a bit of work, he shifted Sherlock’s clothed cock and tied off the fifth knot, positioning it between his balls with Sherlock’s cock in the hole the two ends created.
Sherlock laughed, still holding onto John’s hand.  John was looking at him oddly now, no doubt wondering if the stress of this moment had made him lose his mind.
‘And a truly disgraceful amount of self-pity.’
“I didn’t know dragons could take on human forms.”
She looked at him keenly and then tucked a bead into the strap of his medkit where it folded over his shoulder.
-   Harriet Beecher Stowe
“…I cannot protect you from this, Brother Mine.  But you know the one who can.”
There’s a long-suffering sigh and then the light smacking sound of a pair of lips pressing to a (still mostly hairless, John despairs of Rosie ever wearing the ridiculous amount of barrettes Mrs. H had showered her with on her last birthday) forehead, followed by childish giggles.
John wasn’t sure just what the dragon could repay him with, chained here like this.
A tail uncoiled, scales so dark a green they were almost black glittering beneath the muck and foul waste clinging to it.  John scrambled backwards instinctively, hands reaching for a sword he no longer had.
“What do they normally say?”
“My name, John.  My
Besides.  If he was to be useless now, at least he could do one last good thing with his life and protect a creature who was wondrous and brilliant and who deserved to be free.
There was simply nothing better than watching Sherlock’s cheeks warm and flush after John’s managed to fluster him with something.  He waited patiently for the other man to process this bit of suggestiveness, busying himself with making tea one-handed with Rosie on his hip.  She tried to help out by knocking the sugar bowl over with her foot and then attempting to stuff a dry teabag in her mouth.
Rosie’s giggles turned into pouting once she cottoned on to the fact that she was the ‘one’ in question.
John wanted to mutter into the folds of Sherlock’s dressing gown.  He laughed instead, pulling back once Rosie began to fuss about not being the center of both men’s attention for a record thirty seconds.
“I can’t protect you from this,” Mycroft said, the clipped words echoing off the tile in 221b’s small kitchen.  “I’ve tried too many times already and they are suspicious of my motives.  They want you bound to the Summer Court.”
Sherlock waved his hand in a dismissive gesture.  “Sleep.  Sleep’s boring.”
“Who else would it be?” Sherlock sniffed, the words emerging hesitantly, like he knew the language but had a little trouble with the workings of human lips and tongue.
“I’ll leave you to think it through, then.  Sunrise at the airfield.  Oh, and Sherlock…”  He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the table.  “For old time’s sake.”
“No nap, Da.”
So he fought against the poison of the iron, the way it lanced into him like a spear and slashed jagged red lines of pain into every breath.  And when Mycroft gave him Rosamund Mary’s true name (he suspected as an apology, though it was never stated as such) he used it to ruthlessly expose her purpose.  A spy from Underhill.  A ‘compatriot’ of Moriarty, a servant to the Queen, meant to quietly dispose of Sherlock and his human pet so that the Unseelie Court could avenge its lost knight.  When he commanded her to forget she had ever known John Watson, she could do naught but comply.
“We were going to get married.”  Tight skin across knuckles.  A laugh like broken glass.
“You’re a dragon,” he blurted out, the absurdity of the words twisting his lips into a grimace.  There were no more dragons, not in any areas populated by humans.  Dragon hunting had gone out of style when John was a boy, having been either hunted into virtual extinction or driven out into elven territory and magical wastelands where humans didn’t dare to venture.  How in the world had this one managed to survive here in the heart of Pandathaway?
They’d been working on colours lately.
“She’s inherited your appalling sense of colour.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.  That’s the whole of it,” he said triumphantly, sketching a bow and releasing John’s hand.
*No need to panic,* Sherlock said.  *I’m very clever, you know.  I’m not going to let us get caught.*
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” he said, “come home to me.  Come home.”
*Your wizards captured me when I was but an egg and when I was old enough to make flame they brought me here and chained me.*
Mary Morstan was a changeling.  Sherlock knew it from the start but he did not know why she was a changeling until she had put an iron bullet in his abdomen.  Iron in the gut would have killed him, did kill him, except that there was John not knowing that Mary was a changeling and if Sherlock died then no one would be there to tell him.  And Sherlock could not let John be devoured by a changeling.
“I don’t understand,” John confessed and oh Bright Lord, that was the back of the t-shirt right there.  The thing that would protect them both.  John wouldn’t understand, because humans didn’t, they couldn’t.  And yet he would see.  He was so practical about these things.
*Was it?  That isn’t what people normally say.*
John shouted internally, but it was too late.  He was hit in an instant with the memory of sitting in filth, the stench and the sensation causing him to immediately double over and deposit the contents of his stomach into the dirt at his feet.
“Definitely not boring,” he muttered under his breath, a grin quirking the corners of his lips.
The ‘night’s watch incident’ was a tidy way to put ‘getting thrown out of an inn and almost arrested’, wasn’t it?  John snorted and folded his arms.
And so he watched the trap unfold, dreading the moment it would snap shut.  Yet he had not counted on John Watson.  The very effect of John Watson on Sherlock was astounding.  Sherlock, who had been interested by mortals but never cared for them.  Sherlock, who had been enticed at first by Moriarty’s cruelty but then repelled by it, simply because it focused for an instant on John Watson.  Sherlock, who had flown to Mycroft’s door with Moriarty’s blood on his face, pleading for a way to save John Watson from notice as Mycroft’s minions quietly cleaned up the mess on St. Bart’s roof.
“That’s the teakettle, Watson.  And it’s Sherlock.  Shhhhhher-lock.”
“We don’t lick dust motes, Watson.  Your father frowns on it.  Despite the fact that it’s mostly dead epidermis, sand, and dander which is hardly toxic at all and quite harmless.  Now, this lichen would make you quite sick if you were to ingest it so you must never touch it or put it in your mouth.  See the bright colour?”
“Dust motes.”
It was difficult to stand there across from John Watson, watching the straight back and set shoulders of the man broadcast his anxiety and anguish.  John Watson was a practical man.  He wouldn’t throw a fit just because the British government saw fit to cart away his best friend.  He would meet the enemy like a soldier, even if the enemy happened to be a rather luxurious private plane to Eastern Europe.  He couldn’t quite look at it though, nor could he quite look at Sherlock.  Instead, he shifted nervously, as though searching for something just out of grasp.
he asked as he drew his dagger and knelt in the murky sludge.
*Sherlock.  Oh yes, please.  John, you’re stupendous-*
“You.  And Rosie.  And the tea.”
He was a practical man.
Of course he took advantage.  Sherlock in the Summer Court,
“The game is over,” John whispered.
Wanting to whirl about in glee, Sherlock settled for darting down to bestow a kiss, right onto John’s cheek.  The soldier looked startled but not disgusted and his hand rose to cup the skin as though it were a wound to coddle.
“I know what she is, Mycroft.  Do you?”
The dragon slapped its tail into the mud, sending a splash of it into the air where it promptly got flamed into ashes.  John got the distinct impressive that the dragon would’ve been rolling its eyes at him if it could.
It wasn’t until midnight that Sherlock opened the envelope to find a card with a riddle upon it, like the kind Mycroft used to give him when he was young and going mad from boredom.
The last time John brought up the fact that Rosie wouldn’t be able to pronounce silent consonants until her front teeth came in a little more Sherlock had glared at him witheringly and told Rosie that she was to ignore
He glanced over at Rosie who was quietly watching them from her chair, a crayon clutched tight in her chubby fist, bright eyes taking in everything.
"Coming!"  John said, moving hastily to catch up.  It was only when he reached the other man that he realized that he wasn't limping at all, and hadn't been since he made the decision to step into the dragon's prison.
“I didn’t think you liked jewelry,” he said, frowning.
*Free!*
“You’re a sodding
“Da!  Green,” his daughter said, pointing triumphantly to the book of lichen propped up on the table.
“I could rip the sky open in front of them and they still wouldn’t see.”
“Stubborn as your father,” Sherlock said, and he sounded so fond that John couldn’t stand to fake sleep any longer.
John Watson was a practical man, which is why he tucked his gun away into the desk drawer of his beige bedsit and did not look at it too long.  He knew he would need it for something but he hadn’t decided what something that was just yet.  And then he met Sherlock Holmes and his too sharp face, his too strange eyes.  He heard the violin wail and weep beneath those too long fingers.  He heard the man be just a little too rude and more than a little too clever and he knew exactly why he had kept the gun.
And Sherlock chafed his wrists and smiled bitterly.
There was a pause and then the nausea vanished, leaving John to gasp and wipe his sleeve across his mouth, the smell suddenly muted to something bearable instead of the overwhelming stink it had been.  The dragon’s eyes pinned him in place, shifting in colour before seeming to settle into pale blue.
“I know that.  I know you wouldn’t,” he protested, shaking his head.  “That’s not why I—”
*Of course I can read minds.  I know a lot more than just your name.  I know you’re a soldier recently invalided home and dismissed from service due to a grievous arrow wound to your shoulder.  Your sister welcomed you home but you’re hesitant to stay with her, possibly because she drinks far too much, more likely because of her strained relationship with her lover Clara who likes you far more than she should and who thinks your limp is psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.  Satisfied?*
“John, come take a look at this!”
*There are certain compounds available at the market that can dull the senses.  Powders and tinctures made by the same kinds of wizards that chained me.  It would be ironic indeed to seek comfort from their potions, but they are effective.  Those who keep me here have used them before to subdue me while conducting repairs on the aqueduct.  If you could get some for me I will repay you.*
“No, you aren’t.”
John felt a searing pain around his neck and almost screamed aloud, but the agony was smothered before he could lift his hands to his throat.
A gout of flame suddenly roasted the slop to John’s right and what he’d thought was a mound of garbage shifted and growled.
“What that?”
The dragon blinked and tilted its head, looking for all the world like an overgrown puppy.
*Help, it’s a dragon.*
Still blushing, Sherlock took a long sip of tea and then retreated to his microscope, away from John’s suggestive grins.  Well satisfied with how his ‘unwinding time’ was progressing today, John eased himself into one of the kitchen chairs and cuddled his daughter on his lap.  It might not have been the way he’d imagined his life turning out three or four years ago, but he had to admit that he’d rarely ever felt so satisfied, so grounded.
Days later, Sherlock finds a little velvet box in the trash.  There are two rings inside, one of burnished gold and one of cold iron.  Sherlock puts the iron ring on his finger until it burns a scar onto the pale flesh.  He wants the reminder.
The sentiment caught like wildfire in London.  Enough that Sherlock’s draw to the place was too strong to shatter and Mycroft could no longer keep him in the Summer Court.  He could no longer castle his king.
Before leaving for the airfield, Sherlock slipped the card into his pocket.
Sherlock sniffed and pretended to ignore them both in favour of staring into his microscope.
“Geen, Suhl.”
John thought, and then gripped the chain.  Nothing happened, no burning, no pain.  There was still no pain when he brought the butt of the dagger down on the chain, nor when—on the seventh strike—the link finally broke.
“If I tell him,” Sherlock spat, “and he believes me then the veil is torn. It is the last straw, and justification for binding me to
He underestimated John Watson.
There was a short pause and then the sound of something being moved, followed by Rosie’s dismayed cry and Sherlock’s chiding voice.
*So, will you get me those potions then?*
And then it seemed like the dragon folded into itself, wings wrapping around the scaled body and shrinking down until it was no larger than John himself.  When the wings unwrapped, there was a young man standing there instead, quite naked, with dark curly hair and strange pale eyes.  The wings settled over his shoulder like a leathery cloak.
The information rained down on him like hailstones, pummeling him with the pain of the arrow thumping into bone and muscle, the sound of Harry’s slurred accusations as he bailed her out of the squalid little cell she’d been sent to sober up in, the scent of Clara’s perfume when she hugged him goodbye.  Dizzy, John stumbled forward and leaned on the fencing that separated the dragon and the sewage basin surrounding it from the rest of the space.
Except that wasn’t quite true.
He didn’t ask what happened.  He didn’t much care.
was John’s dazed thought before he realized that anyone looking out their window right now would be able to see Sherlock floating in his full glory above the sewage basin.
*Yes, I am a dragon.  And you are John Watson.  And this the ground.  Are all humans this stupid or are you more dimwitted than most?”
“I entrust it to you,” Sherlock said, and then he was gone into the plane before John could blink.
“Oh for God’s sake, find me some pants then, if they’re so important.  But be quick about it.  They’re going to notice that the sewage is building up eventually.”
There was silence for a long while in the flat.  And then, haltingly—
The problem was that Sherlock refused to hide himself, even a little.  His features were too sharp, his eyes too strange, his fingers just a little too long.  He was far too clever, far too rude, and he coaxed sounds out of his violin that weren’t meant to be heard by human ears.  Not human ears that wished to stay attached to their heads, that is.
*Why should I stop it?  Your kind brought me to this and yet you’re too cowardly to face the reality of what you’ve done.*
John thought as loud as he could.
anyway.”
“Geen!”
If he fled, right now, into the plane he could leave without seeing this.  Without breaking his own heart with the sound of John’s voice.  But he couldn’t make himself let go.
When Sherlock had declared himself bored with the Underhill beyond measure, Mycroft had begged him to come to Court.  He plied him with riddles and tasks and spying games and Sherlock had rejected them all in favour of London’s thick smoke and grey buildings.
Sherlock roared, tossing its head and flapping its wings twice before rising into the air, sludge dripping off of the scales to reveal a long, sleekly scaled form.  John thought for an instant that the dragon would immediately fly off, eager to be away from the site of its captivity for so many years, but Sherlock hovered in the air for a few minutes before sending a stream of flame directly at John.
A laugh burst from John’s mouth at the dry sarcasm in the dragon’s delivery and he had to tamp down on a fit of giggles, shoulders shaking with the effort.  The dragon flicked its tail, seeming pleased and somewhat bewildered by John’s amusement.
“That’s settled then.  We’ll have our tea and you can finish up with the lichens, seeing as Rosie’s interested in the result.”  Or at least her scribbles were of the green variety and could very well look like a poisonous lichen if you squinted.  “And then it’s a lie-down for all of us.”
*No.* It reluctantly agreed.  *Not your kind.  You’ve strong moral principles, I can see.  Very well, John Watson.  If you’ve not come here to taunt me, they could you perhaps do me a favour?*
“I need some air,” John muttered as he pushed back into the crowd, ignoring Harry’s puzzled calling of his name.
“…Sherlock?” John ventured, gaze settled determinedly on the burn scars marring the man’s pale neck instead of—well, elsewhere.
A shrill whistling cuts through the quiet and John can hear Sherlock’s muttered curse before the noise cuts off sharply.  Luckily, Rosie’s more into the questioning phase than repeating what everyone says [“And a good thing too, with the rate you swear around her,” Sherlock had snapped when John teasingly brought up the idea of a swear jar for him.  “I’m hardly the one to worry about in that regard.”] and John waits for the little voice to pipe up, right on cue.
“Of course you didn’t.  How do you think so many dragons survived the great hunt?  Ah.  You didn’t think any dragons had survived the great hunt, did you.  Well, not many did, but there are still more of us among your lands then you might expect.  Now, shall we go?  The ambience here leaves much to be desired.”
And no pleadings from that point on could persuade Sherlock to come home.  Still there were things the human realms couldn’t give him and times that the dull, unseeing eyes of the people he surrounded himself with tore at his mind, shredded him and infuriated him.  Why couldn’t they just think?  Why was he the only one clever enough to see the things that lay plainly out before him, like script on paper?  He drowned his frustration in opium, the only drug that would work as well on fae folk as on the humans, and lost himself in the colours a while.  It seemed like minutes.  It seemed like years.  And when he finally emerged from the softened edges of his mind he was in his brother’s house with the raw, red burn of iron around his wrists.
*Idiot.  It’s magic, of course.  If I try to melt the chain or pull myself free it burns me.*
“What?”
John Watson had been a practical child.  When his grandmother told him that the pixies would stop leaving twigs and bits of grass in his shoes if he gave them a gift he didn’t stop to wonder if pixies were real, nor did he dream of capturing one or taking photos with his camera to show Harry.  He simply put a bowl of milk and some bread and honey (he had read that they liked honey especially) on his windowsill and went to sleep confident that tomorrow morning he could slip his feet into his shoes without a nasty surprise.  When he found a coin in his shoe instead he didn’t accuse his grandmother of planting it there, nor did he decide to repeat the experiment to try and catch the culprit in the act.  Instead he bought himself two licorice whips and felt quite pleased at having solved the problem.
“How can I pass up the chance to take tea with my two favourite people?” he said as he hefted Rosie out of her chair and into his arms, bouncing her up and down in time with her giggling.  “Although I will be taking my nap later.  As will this one.”
The dragon,
“Never said anything about sleeping,” John pointed out.
Ah, and now John was looking adorably confused.  He should have that expression put on a t-shirt, splashed across his chest like a protective talisman.
He didn’t know what she meant until the next evening, when a bullet was busily pushing its way through the muscle of his shoulder, drawn there like a magnet.  The bead in his strap shattered on impact.
*My flame could never harm you, John Watson.  Please hurry.*
A lot of things used to be.  No sense dwelling on things he couldn’t change.
“Vanished in the ether for many years.”  Sherlock placed a cautious hand on John’s shoulder.  “Likely you never knew her at all.  She was an imposter for as long as she knew you.”
“Harry is Teddy’s godfather, so even though Ted’s grandmother was the main one to take care of him, Harry was still a big part of his childhood.  I wanted to be a part of that too, both because of my friendship with Tonks and since we both lost our parents to this war.  Plus Harry needed someone he could just sit and have a conversation with after everything, and in a lot of ways so did I.  It all just sort of happened.  When Harry had Teddy for a weekend, I would come over and we’d chat while watching him together.
“We were told your magic wasn’t strong enough to attend Hogwarts,” Violet muttered, shaking her head in disbelief.  “Your magic shouldn’t be any stronger than mine.”
“I’ve never been here, but John has.”  Sherlock turned back so that he was watching his shape move around through the spaces between the seated owls.  “He was in the Order and fought in the war.  And as soon as he was finished with one, he threw himself into another.”  Shaking his head, he frowned at his reflection.  “I don’t understand how he’s done all that on top of putting up with me, but he’s fantastic for it.”
“I’m sorry this happened,” he said quietly, shifting a finger to run softly over it.  “I could have saved you then, if I was carrying my wand, but instead – “
“The Mark can be concealed with makeup and certain concealment charms, but of all of the times I ever saw her change, it always remained,” Snape replied.  “I do not know if she actively kept it or simply could not remove it, however.”
“How is the supply of pepperup potion?” Sherlock asked.  “We might as well help John with his work in the process, and I don’t believe I’ve ever taught Cecelia how to make it.”
For a long moment, the pair of them simply stared at each other, taking in their outfits. In addition to the tight trousers, Sherlock wore a shirt similar to a waistcoat, dark charcoal in colour with thin black pinstripes almost invisible until the light caught their sheen. Around his neck he wore a stark white cravat stuck into the waistcoat’s high collar, the colour blinding against the rest of his dark attire. The only other colour came from the row of shiny silver buttons than ran along his left side, pulling the waistcoat tight to accentuate his waist. His arms were mostly bare, a hint of black sleeve poking from where his shoulders curved down to his biceps. John forced his eyes up to Sherlock’s face to see him nodding with a slight frown.
As he drew closer to Slughorn’s classroom, an abrupt sense of unease settled into his stomach.  He attempted to ignore it, certain it was a result of his last incident with Doyle.  He refused to allow the event to dictate his actions and continued on with determined steps and an irritated scowl.  A shape darting out of a dark corner ahead of him made him jump in surprise, however, and as he stepped back away from it he felt a sharp poke directly into the small of his back, forcing him to freeze.
When neither man continued for several moments, Dumbledore cleared his throat significantly.  “Have you any thoughts of where she might have gone to after John found out, Severus, if Mary is in fact Abigail?  Family or friends who might have taken her in, perhaps?”
“Where did you find this?” John asked, his voice sharp and demanding.  He continued to scan the pages as Sherlock answered.
“Do we know who these men were specifically?” Sherlock asked, turning to direct his question at Harry.  “We heard at least one of their names before John took them out.  Travers.”
Knocking down the kickstand and clamoring over the bike, Sherlock scrambled back into the garage and returned with a silver helmet.  He tossed it at John and returned to his bike, nodding his head at John to tempt him over.  John settled the helmet on his head and strode over to swing on behind Sherlock.  His hands automatically settled on Sherlock’s hips below the jacket and he felt him stiffen momentarily in his hold.  Before he could ask if he was okay, Sherlock straightened and hastily buttoned half of his jacket and shoved his own helmet on.  In seconds, he had set the key in the ignition and revved the bike into life, shooting them out into the street fast enough that John had to lunge forward to grasp Sherlock fully around the waist.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at John’s use of the plural and John took the opportunity to gently pull out of his grasp.  He shook himself and nodded, moving in a slight daze back into the kitchen.  “Breakfast, then?  And practicing magic?”
“How is this even here?” Sherlock muttered, his eyes enormous.  “There are solid buildings in this area, I know it, and yet we passed through a single wall and the entire environment has completely changed.  How did they manage it without any Muggles noticing?  Don’t they realize it’s here, feel it, hear it, anything?”
He left Sherlock rummaging through the first bag to go into the kitchen.  When he grabbed the kettle, he felt his wand shift in its holster under his sleeve.  Shooting the closed kitchen door a quick glance, he yelled over his shoulder for Sherlock.  Moments later, Sherlock was at his side, John’s worn copy of
John nodded and James motioned for Thor to stay.  She cocked her head at him briefly in question, but when he patted her head in reassurance she sat positioned where she could watch the stairs.  Cecelia squirmed and attempted to wiggle over towards her, but John steadied his grip on her, much to her dismay.  Sherlock glanced up at John through his lashes, his head barely raised enough to meet John’s eyes.  “You’ve had him stashed away this whole time while James and I have been talking, haven’t you?  Waiting for me to break down so you can bask in your success?”
John Watson groaned, one hand in his own hair and the other grasping around in the blankets around him.  He soon discovered the bump underneath them that was moving in steady up and down motions and clutched at it desperately through the fabric.  Sliding his other hand down the side of his face and neck to tuck it below the blanket, he guided it to the figure between his legs.  Fingers found a mass of curls and he dug into them, causing a muffled moan to sneak out from the opening in the blanket his arm had made.
To distract himself from overthinking the upcoming evening too much, John spent a good part of the day cleaning the flat.  Sherlock amused himself making a potion and Cecelia crawled around after John, occasionally undoing the cleaning he tried to accomplish.  At around half four, John emerged from the bedroom wearing one of his nicer jumpers.  He cleared his throat as he approached Sherlock so that he wouldn’t startle him.  Sherlock hummed in reply, studying his potion carefully.
John’s returning smile radiated affection.  “Yes you will.  It’s what we do – get ourselves into mischief just for the other so we can both come back home.”  He reached out a hand to take Sherlock’s in a tight but brief squeeze before taking a step back and Apparating away.  Sherlock let out the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding and stood frozen until the sound of Ginny clearing her throat caused him to jump.
“Actually,” Sherlock cut in sharply, spinning to flounce himself into his chair and steepling his hands, “he’s brought us a case. He was in the middle of explaining when you interrupted.”
Dr. Watson, meaning that you either wish to take both of us on for a case, which is unlikely since your stance indicated the bearing of news of some sort rather than an outright question, or you wish to speak to one or both of us directly.  Since you mentioned both names, I suspect you are looking either for the pair of us or John individually.  Seeing as I have never seen you before in my life, I’m leaning slightly more towards just John.  However, John Watson has not resided at 221b Baker Street for nearly two years now, leaving me to doubt how close a connection the two of you have – or, rather once had – if you haven’t been informed of his most recent address, let alone the various supposedly significant life events that have occurred for him.  Therefore, not a case.”  With that, Sherlock flopped himself down into his armchair, violin sprawled lazily across his lap.
“Maybe not traditionally romantic, but we aren’t exactly traditional, are we?”  John’s smile grew as he tugged Sherlock along, eventually stopping him at the entrance.  The normally automatic doors were closed, the café to their left dark, and only a few employees stood about preparing to close for the day.  One of them spotted the pair and approached, John pulling him aside to explain.  The employee’s face brightened, his eyes darting toward Sherlock with an amused grin, and he soon led them inside.  Sherlock watched John rather than their surroundings, far more interested in studying him as they made their way down two sets of stairs.  At the bottom, they were greeted with an older style Met car behind an empty podium.  Sherlock gaped between it and John for a moment, John smirking up at him in excitement.
“Ha, clever of you, Smith, I’ll give you that.  But something’s gone amiss; Holmes has got the Ministry involved.”
Sherlock nodded and moved Cecelia off his shoulder.  “As I told you yesterday, I’ve never been involved in anything close to a real relationship.  Dates, occasionally, and moments I suppose you could refer to as one night stands – “
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” John muttered, just loud enough to be heard.  Cecelia sat up quickly to gape at him while Sherlock crossed his arms with a glare.
John took the hand and gave it a firm squeeze.  “John Watson.  So you said you’re headed for Saint Neots?”
that the big guy in a red suit who’s got her all excited about Christmas is a fake.”
“John,” Sherlock muttered.  As soon as he was sure Doyle was incapacitated, John shoved the wands into his pocket and rushed to Sherlock’s side.  He cradled his face in his hands with a gentle touch, his eyes darting madly over him in search of injuries.  Sherlock sighed as his eyes fell shut in relief and he sagged into John’s hold.  John wrapped his arms carefully around Sherlock to pull him close in a reassuring yet loose grip.  Sherlock, in contrast, gripped his hands in the front of John’s shirt and pulled him in as close as he could.
From around his shoulder, John spotted the corner of a book that caught his attention.  He leaned around him to snatch it up, uncovering a plain looking book whose cover was worn with age.  Its spine, though showing no signs of having been opened regularly, appeared ripped and faded as though other books had been moved around it more than it had ever been noticed.  More than anything, however, its title intrigued John.  Though the letters were worn, he saw something about Hogwarts and his excitement grew when he opened it to the title page and read it in full.
barely have anything to do with it.  Your problem seems to be with Mary, Jones, and she’s long dead.”
When John went up to bed that night, Sherlock was still sat in the middle of the sitting room floor surrounded by papers. His attempts at sleep were interrupted by the continuation of the images that distracted him throughout the day, culminating in a reluctant wank in the hopes of calming himself down. Even that only worked for so long, as thoughts of Sherlock’s hands being the ones on his skin in little more than forty eight hours seemed to increase his desire. After tossing and turning for hours, he finally succeeded in falling asleep, although the day’s images simply followed him into sleep.
“I wasn’t meant to go to Hogwarts,” Sherlock suddenly announced.  John froze in his ministrations for the briefest second before continuing it with a bit more force.  He remained silent while Sherlock recounted what happened at Hogwarts in a quiet voice.  When he finished, he sighed and leaned his head back against John’s shoulder.
“What are we reading?” John asked with mock curiosity.  Cecelia curled up until she was settled in his lap and propped the book up for them.
“MUM, can my friend Sherlock come to Halloween with me and Harry?”
“Leave Cecelia out of this,” Sherlock snapped.  Caring more about getting away from him than whatever threat his wand held, Sherlock wrapped his free hand around Doyle’s wrist that clasped his wand.  He tightened his grip, digging his fingernails into the tender skin below his palm, but Doyle seemed unaffected.  If anything, his expression turned more amused the harder Sherlock fought.
John shifted Cecelia into a more comfortable position and leaned forward.  “Right, so here’s what I’m thinking…”
“It’s real, Sherlock, trust me.  Kipping down for the night won’t change any of this or take back me telling you.”
OKAY. I'm sorry I had to get lectury on y'all but it was for all of our own good. Just use common courtesy, think before you comment, and we'll all be good. I want to have a good time with this too and it's hard to do that when comments make me uncomfortable! I love y'all and want to keep going with this story but stuff like that makes me want to stop. Anyway, ON WITH THE FIC. There are a couple of links included in this chapter to the things I found on the internet that inspired certain aspects of it.
“What now, Papa?” she asked, facing him as she skipped backwards.  Sherlock sighed as he walked behind her, his hands deep in his trouser pockets.
Turning slowly to Stephen, Violet shook her head.  “Not as far as I remember.  Your brother is unique, not unlike you, but he’s never shown any signs of having it himself.  He always seemed fairly unimpressed by magic, as far as I could tell.”
attached to him, aren’t you?” Niall’s surprise turned into smug satisfaction as he grinned. “I told Ian that blog of yours was more affectionate than simple friendship. They sound just like half the letters you used to write to all of those crushes of yours.”
“Best in the UK.  Nearly everyone at Hogwarts got their wands from him.”
Mrs. Hudson continued to gape for a moment, eventually catching herself with a slight shake and a gesture behind her.  “Ah…yes, well, one of them, yes.  Come with me, dearie, he’s just upstairs.”
John drew his arm up over the top of Sherlock’s on the sofa and trailed his hand over to Sherlock’s nape, giving it a light squeeze.  “Hmm, perhaps.  I might even be inclined to give you a private show.”
He soon discovered what had gotten them so excited when a knock came at the classroom door.  Miss Hart, one of the other year four teachers, waved eagerly at the tiny window, gesturing between their teacher and something behind her.  Sherlock’s teacher, Miss Jones, broke out in a smile and stood from her desk.  “Okay everybody,” she declared, loud enough to be heard over the students’ talking to bring them to order.  “Clean up whatever you’re working on and go back to your workstations, please.  Miss Hart and her students are here to work on our big project!”
Wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, John buried his face between his shoulder blades.  As he rubbed his cheek against the rough skin there, he felt Sherlock stumble slightly to keep himself standing.  He turned to attempt to look over his shoulder at John, but all he could see was the top of his silver head.  “John?” he asked, his voice tinged with concern.  John smiled and sniffled a bit, the noise causing Sherlock to shift around so that they were face to face.  He ran his thumb under one of his eyes, catching the hint of tears that were attempting to fall.
“Da, Papa!  Grandmum Weasley sent me a new jumper too!”  John took it to study it better and she instantly rushed back to her pile.  The jumper was a lilac purple, the giant knitted c in the middle a darker shade.  He folded it back into a square and rested it on his lap with a shake of his head.
“John dear,” she said when he stopped only a few feet away.  “What a pleasant surprise.  Lucky me, to finally get to see the golden child, even if it’s not me you came to visit.”
The case kept Sherlock busy for the two days it took John to organize everything he needed.  While Lestrade had him spending his time flitting between crime scenes and Molly’s lab at Barts, John snuck off with Cecelia in tow.  They headed out around the corner and down the road towards a tiny café, Cecelia’s pram completely covered to fight off the rain that raged down on them.  John attempted to keep his collar up and hood down, but inevitably by the time they arrived he was drenched through.
John readjusted steady grip on his wand, shooting out his free arm to make sure Sherlock remained behind him. "We only learned about Jones and Travers a few hours ago. They had only just found Yaxley and Rosier a bit before we got to Azkaban."
“What have you done with them?” he muttered at the floor.
!” John shouted as sparks of varying colours lit up the clearing.  He scrambled at his sleeve to wrench out his own wand, muttering a quick, “Protego Totalum!” as he swept his arm in an arcing circle around them.  A brief silvery bubble hovered over them before the sounds of the spells abruptly hollowed.  “Stay here,” John sternly said in Sherlock’s ear before jumping to his feet, flinging a spell at one of the men.
‘Oh yes. I am a consulting detective. The only one in the world.’
With that said, he disappears into the same room without waiting for a response from Sherlock. He stands there befuddled.
John nods, and if his insides just flipped over this bizzarely intimate gesture, he is going to blame it on post-chase adrenaline.
But how is it that he is standing at the door of 221b and the man there just glances at him once and averts his gaze, as if it physically hurts to look into his eyes for more than a second. May be it does because the next moment, a lonely tear runs along his cheek down to his neck, leaving a wet trail behind. It is perplexing that he is the wounded one and that other man aches on his behalf.
‘Hmm. Alright, open up.’
Sherlock’s eyes nearly roll out of their sockets as he huffs out a breath.
He places the instruments on the operating table and pushes a stool forward to sit on it. The slight clattering of instruments compels the man to uncover his eyes and sit upright. John takes one peek at him and intuitively looks away. There is something different about this man. The whole aura around him smells of finesse and poise. Yet it’s the mysterious eyes that caught John’s attention. He picks up his file instead and skims through his medical history.
Sherlock opens his eyes and this time, he turns around and kisses him.
John steps into his aura and without a hint of hesitation, he presses his lips against his own.
'Oh and don't forget to follow your prescription.' He screams from a distance and then walks away to attend another patient.
Follow me on
John chuckles.
It's soft. Tender. And not what Sherlock had anticipated at all. He is struck for a moment, unable to discern reality from day-dreaming again. But John presses once more and everything else blurs into the background. His lips move own their own accord, against his better judgement.
Except for the fact that he doesn't know how to utter a word the moment he opens the door into his room.
, this is not what I meant.’
'It’s quite alright.’ Sherlock replies in a sleep-laced voice. There’s something ungulpable about his tone that John isn’t able to figure out. It’s…velvety. Or maybe he is just mistaking the softness of his voice for something else. His trail of thoughts is broken when Sherlock leans in close to his neck without a warning and inhales deeply.
‘Ofcousrse I do. It was extraordinary. It was quite extraordinary.’ Sherlock blinks again on cue.
He plans out the whole scenario to go to his office again, apologize for his juvenile behaviour and walk straight out of the room. Everything is perfectly prepared. The whole speech has been rehearsed at least 28 times before he enters his office. He has got it all under control.
‘What the hell do you think you are doing?’ Sherlock asks in a furious manner, dumping all niceties aside. John is taken back for a second.
'Is it working? A meaningful smirk streches across John’s lips as he continues his course along his jaw.
‘What do people usually say?’
'Dr. Watson, I am afraid you can't leave. There is a patient outside and I insist Doctor, you need to check him.'
‘Oh shit!’ He rushes to reduce the amount of gas flow to an optimum level. Sherlock nearly cries at the loss of such cuddly comfort but John turns back to him in an instant.
Sherlock nods his head and John can hardly overlook the gratitude dribbling from his eyes. He smiles and picks up the mouth mirror. Just when he is about to insert it into Sherlock’s mouth, he bats his hand away.
‘Sorry what? Did you just say serial killer?’
The hot liquid splashes onto the left side of his body and the cup gravitates straight to the floor as he abruptly turns around.
‘You have just returned from a military dental camp in Afghanistan. The tan line around your wrists plus the way you hold yourself up is evident of your time spent with the army. I was initially confused between Afghanistan and Iraq since multiple underdeveloped countries were selected for dental awareness camps but based on most recent data, Afghanistan is more likely. Affiliation with military services grants you with a much needed dose of adrenaline even though you’re satisfied with your job here. It’s less cumbersome and you get to take off early which is baffling since you don’t have anyone to return to. You’re single and haven’t had a relationship for a long while.’
A minute later, he leans closer to Sherlock and uncovers his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
'John… Are you - are you flirting with me?’ Sherlock exhales with difficulty.
It’s maddening how the whole situation made him vulnerable enough to let down his guards and let the affection he always held for this man flow through. But he can’t..he can’t do this. He probably has lost the right to be even standing in such an intimate position with this man, given what happened the last time.
John kisses the words out of him yet again and for the first time, he didn’t even have to lift up on the tip of his toes.
masterpiece.
John raises a hand to massage the back of his neck and along the line of his left shoulder, probably because it got strained enough for the day. Sherlock traces every movement with his eyes and plans to investigate further on this matter that discomforts John.

She punctuates every word with the hint of an underlying threat. John stares at her wide-eyed and wonders who the heck has managed to frighten her otherwise calm assistant.
