“I know they do,” John says with a smile. A wild, predatory smile that is so out of place in this conversation that Sherlock’s teeth hurt.
John is heroically not explaining to Sherlock just what he thinks of him and this stupid plan and this stupid not-mafia-gang of his, but only because he feels his life might hang in the balance. He is, however, putting together some choice phrases to use in his rant when (if) they get out of here.
"Sherlock, please tell me this isn't the Mafia. I don't want to be murdered by the Mafia."
She's in his living room, sitting in John's chair.
“She drugged you and stole from you,” John replies. “That’s not how a friend behaves.”
That’s right. That’s what he needs to think about, rather than Sherlock’s smell. He needs to focus.
He could point out that the cheating started before Mary wrote her little letter of goodbye, so John’s moral high-ground is shaky at best. He could tell John that he wants this – desperately – but that he’s not willing to do this with anything standing between them.  He could ask so many questions. But he doesn’t.
“It’s not about that,” John said patiently.
He sits down and reaches for Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock stares down at their linked fingers.
“I can't think of anything,” Sherlock muttered, “that you could give me that I can't already have.”
Sherlock was the first to break the silence.
It'll be fine.
John squeezes his hand again, as the lights come back on and passengers all around them start stirring.
Not after all this time.
"Naturally," answers Sherlock, as if he'd just been looking over the classifieds.
"Yes?"
“You are baking the cookies and you are eating the cookies,” he ground out. “Or else.”
Maybe she’d not only been distracting Rosie.
"You'll have to take care of him," she says after a while.
He's followed him into the room before John has turned out the lights., slipping into bed without a word. He's not using his phone this time around. He's just there. Lying stiffly under the covers.
John valiantly resisted the urge to throw his book at Sherlock’s head.
Those signs are secondary to the hurt in John’s eyes as he stands there, now, shoulders slumped. Secondary to the slight trembling in his fingers as he dials Molly’s number, begging her to be on standby to take Rosie.
And then he nodded slowly. “Right. Pretend it didn’t happen.”
But he's still not sure what exactly happened there.
Sherlock is left alone and wondering what the hell ostrich feathers have to do with anything.
The ghost of John’s baby lingers in the room.
Of course.
Sherlock doesn’t even think before pulling his hand from underneath the coat and licking it clean, but the moan from John sounds like it’s something unusual. Brilliant, even. Extraordinary.
The silence in the kitchen was deafening.
He does
Sherlock exhales heavily, once he's sure she's out of earshot.
John picks up a few things in the kitchen and moves around the living room while Sherlock plays. He takes a shower (because a day spent on the move in London can make you seriously icky, even without any close calls with criminal gangs).  Still, Sherlock doesn’t speak.
He can see him in the window as soon as 221B is in sight. Tall, thin and holding his violin, playing something that John couldn't for the life of him recognize, even if he could hear it.
“Your list.”
Sherlock's skin is warm under his fingers, and John cradles his best friend’s face, his thumb stroking his chin.
He doesn't care for this constant comparison. He doesn't like thinking too much about what things were like for John while he was away.
"Mary, you do actually know who my brother is," he says later that night when she turns up later that night. "And what he does?"
Sherlock didn’t look up. “I’ve never had any problem with regular Hobnobs.”
This is surely what Ella means by "trigger."
He hardly notices when Sherlock removes the bottle of lube from his hand. He does notice, however, when Sherlock's finger joins his mouth. And he absolutely notices when a long finger slips into him, easily, and Sherlock's mouth finally leaves him.
Before he could reach it John was on him. His hand gripped Sherlock’s wrist tightly and his voice dropped low.
rude.
So John didn’t feel too bad about waiting. Sherlock wasn’t in any particular danger. He was in the flat with John, so he couldn’t be safer, really.
When Sherlock gets into bed a few minutes later, John doesn't turn towards him. He does, however, edge closer to the centre of the bed until they're touching from shoulder to toe.
John is already on his third, and the seat-belt signs haven’t even been turned off.
Sherlock stared at him in horror.
"So, to paraphrase - No." He huffs a humourless laugh. He doubts she’s told John about the baby either.
"You are magnificent, John," Sherlock whispers in his ear, which is all wrong, since John didn't do anything at all. All he had thought to do was to use the lube for a spot of mutual wanking - he didn't even have the imagination to try anything like what the mad genius next to him had in mind.
"No, you didn't… Did you?”
Neither man glanced at the cage. John didn’t dare breathe.
John, yet again, gave up. He was late for work anyway.
They’d moved from casual banter and into… something else. Because now the silliness was gone from the conversation. The levity had evaporated.
Sherlock glares at her – she has the nerve to giggle.
This time, John knew, Sherlock would not offer that particular service.
Sherlock's breathing has sped up a bit and it makes John pretty terrified to realise that even Sherlock is afraid. Crap.
Sherlock is so long and so lean, and John allows his hands to drift from shoulder blades down to his impossibly narrow waist where he encounters warm skin underneath Sherlock's thin t-shirt.
"But you do! And I know you don’t believe me but I… I care, Sherlock. So, like you helped prepare my wedding, let me do this."
"What about it?"
“I said I was sorry. And I am.”
There was a silence on the phone, lasting several seconds, no doubt intended to allow John to ponder the foolishness of his entire existence.
He puts himself to rights as much he can and uncaps the water. It is cool and welcome and helps him gather his thoughts, a bit.
“Don’t be stupid, you can’t make the tea.”
Sherlock looks pained. "Are you sure you want to talk about this?"
In the end he just mirrors what John did to him. Firm grip, quick wrist movements, eager kisses. And in 78 seconds John Watson has come all over Sherlock’s hands. John keeps eye contact throughout, looking as if Sherlock is the greatest thing ever. It’s every exclamation of “brilliant” and “extraordinary” rolled into one look.
"No problem," Sherlock replies in a low voice.
John smiled at Sherlock, who thankfully didn’t seem to take offense.
Dozens of voices flared up in John's memory, the ghosts of girlfriends past, each telling him that he never seemed to shut up about the great Sherlock Holmes.
"Well, you could always move up there," Mycroft said musingly. "At least one of you. If one of you had a permanent residence there you'd probably fall within the parameters of the current law regarding residents."
“I said: I'm not a child.”
She appears a little stung at this. Maybe she liked playing the little housewife?
“Yeah, hi, Mycroft, it’s John.”
In the evening Lestrade calls, and Sherlock decides to take the case, even though it's barely a five, because he'd been wanting to get samples from an interesting ditch in the area.
“But just think…” John said. “A whole week of total immunity. We could do anything in the world. No consequences. “
Never was.
Almost.
But still. Still - John couldn't stop looking at those long fingers, usually engaged with something or another, now slack and idle. The palm open, like it was waiting to be filled.
“I mean,” said Sherlock, “what if you don’t care two hoots for Santa Claus? What if you need immunity from someone else?” His voice dropped even lower. “What if the most outrageous thing you could think of isn’t an offence against Santa, but rather someone else?”
John wasn't sure which one of them had made it.
He'd understood the playfulness in their interaction. Been intrigued at Sherlock's obvious interest in punishment.
was both the consulting detective and the client. He was sure he had all the evidence – it was just a matter of lining it all up and connecting the aforementioned dots.
John didn’t think he imagined that his back arched the slightest bit, presenting his backside even better.
John is sure that he sometimes does it without John ever waking up, shifting from nightmare to deep slumber without realising it.
He couldn’t tear his eyes away.
"As I said, it’s not about what he likes and what he doesn’t – it’s more fun for you to figure that out for yourself anyway – but just a reminder not to neglect it. Lots of people do, you know, and that’s a shame. It’s not just something that’s a part of the foreplay, it’s just as good as the main course."
It varies, how good John is at ignoring the little voice. He recognises that he might not be in the best frame of mind right now to deal logically with it.
As he disappears the flight attendant covertly drops two bottles of water on John’s vacated seat. And a small note containing her phone number and the name of her hotel is also included.
He certainly didn’t make out with people in the back seats of cars when he was a teenager.
Maybe she'll just close this chapter in her life and never think about it again. Not really.
And if it wasn’t fine it could wait. For a bit. Until Sherlock woke up.
“Are you sure?” he asked him. “Because I told you – there will be consequences.”
think if they
But still, it
"Good. So you'll know that the only reason you haven't been arrested yet is his idea of a filial..."
John, as ever, remains clueless that any of this has happened.
“Oy, did you just call me old?”
"Don't we need a pre-nup?"
John needs to figure out a few things:
"Of course I know."
That's not quite true, he thinks, as pictures of dark hair and white skin flash before his eyes. Janine was quite fit, after all. You'd have to be blind not to notice. But still. It's the sort of thing mates say to each other.
These feelings – obsessions – whatever – were getting completely out of hand. John figured he really needed some professional help in getting his head around his absurd matrimonial situation. So he ordered an appointment with Ella.
But still.
John did some quick calculations and it dawned on him out that since the two of them had met, they had actually spent much more time apart than they ever had together. He’d never thought of it quite like that. Sherlock was such an all-compassing presence in his life. It was a strangely sobering thought.
“It’s a bit like making out on the sofa when you’re a teenager,” John says with a relaxed grin as he allows his hand to sneak under the Belstaff. “Or maybe the back seat of a car.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.
“I’m interested. Is it that you don’t care or don’t know?”
John had never really understood the phrase about going weak in the knees – but he did now. The sheer relief of it was mind-boggling. It felt like they were releasing more than a century of pent up emotion and desire. He felt dizzy, overcome – and incredibly, overwhelmingly aroused and happy at the same time.
John stared at him for a moment, trying to judge if he was being serious. Then he slowly rose from his chair.
He takes his sleeping pills before he goes to bed as he normally does. In the living room he can hear the faint sound of Sherlock typing on his laptop.
“Well, you’ve found out that she was… What she was. It can mess you up. Knowing that your ex was something other than you thought she was.”
He inched closer to Sherlock.
They’ve settled in Sherlock’s bed and turned off the lights when John asks what he’s been wondering.
"I could guess," Sherlock said with an amused glint in his eye,"but it might seem a little vain."
uncivilised.”
He can recognise what he's doing. He can watch himself avoid thinking about the main topic that's crowding his head. He knows that he's focusing on Mary because that allows him to ignore the big issue. The thing that he spends most of his time thinking about how he shouldn't be thinking about it.
He stays in the city centre. Sometimes he doesn't leave the flat all day. But last week, Sherlock offered him to join him on a case, and John accepted.
What he does is drag off most of his clothes, swallow a couple of his sleeping pills, and crawl into bed. Not on his usual side of the bed, but on Mary's side. What has, very recently, somehow become Sherlock's side of the bed.
"Yes and no," she says as she crosses her ankles. "You’ll be there for him, this time around. But you'll also serve as a reminder of how he's gone through this before. Your presence will remind him how he has been betrayed before. Abandoned. You'll need to do something a bit better than taking him along on cases and showing off for him. It won't be enough. Not when he'll be doubting everything he is and everything he's ever done. Being a second fiddle won't help him with that. You'll need to cast him in a central role."
"We'll be fine," Sherlock bites out.
"I'm sorry," he finally says. "About today."
“I’m sure…” John cleared his throat. “I’m sure that you’ll be able to find a loophole. You usually are. Somehow. In this case I’m guessing you’d be able to persuade the relevant parties to your way of thinking. Maybe about the Santa immunity actually being universal. For those seven days.”
be this tender with his one night stands. Surely he doesn’t cradle their faces like this. It is inconceivable that he’d also make these fragile little noises as he kisses
But instead of grinning, as he expects, Sherlock frowns.
But now – sleep. And cuddling, possibly. In a bed.
"I think I'll book an appointment with Ella," he says in the end.
“Legs shoulder width apart, please,” John said, and he could feel his mouth going dry.
"As if,” John snorted. “You'd probably have designed a computer virus to destroy all digital evidence of the hat if you hadn't known that you could."
“Maybe next time. I don’t think I could stand to go through too many steps at this point.” He hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock’s pants and tugged them down.
"Wasn't really suited to a life of crime - probably good for her to realise that now rather than later."
Sherlock knows all about surveillance. He knows how tedious it is, how time consuming, how – sometimes – downright humiliating it is.
everything.
He doesn't question this instinct, doesn't examine it, refuses to think about it. And in a while he's asleep.
He promised himself that he would always be able to look John Watson in the eye without flinching.
“By the way,” John gasped between kisses, “I really don’t think that Santa would’ve taken offense at this, no matter the time of year. Christ, do that again.”
This little voice makes the same suggestion every time John makes a decision. It's been whispering in his ear for years. Should he buy yoghurt or regular milk? Well, either is fine - or he could just go home and shoot himself. That sort of thing.
Sherlock grunted.
John covered his eyes with his hand and sighed. As much fun Sherlock could be when he was tipsy, he was much more fun when they were both tipsy. And really – this was several drinks past tipsy.
opinion, was I?”
He swallows, thickly.
Besides – he couldn’t look at it. How could he? Sherlock would
His laptop, however, is standing on the kitchen counter.
He's taken John's usual spot in the bed and is reading something of his phone screen.
John squinted in the darkness.
“Are you having someone over?”
need to use a timer to figure out how long four minutes took…
He sank back against Sherlock, mindful to put most of his weight on the side where his ribs were uninjured.
And he could feel, every second, that Sherlock was a man, and somehow it didn’t matter. His stubble, his lean, hard body, his towering height – it absolutely didn’t hurt. This was the best kiss John had ever tried, not despite it being with a man but because it was with Sherlock.
Mary, thankfully, does not follow.
"What do you want," John asks, looking up at Sherlock and smiling.
"I'm going out," John says, taking his laptop with him without waiting for a reply.
He doesn’t want them to be the sort of
He's not sure how it would help, but the thought certainly appeals.
Of course he'll take care of John. Like she did, when he left John. Only this time Sherlock will be there for him. This time he'll be the one John can rely on. This time Sherlock will do everything right. This time Sherlock won't be the villain in the story.
John cleared his throat and inched his chair back.
And he feels out of character. His heart is still beating furiously in his chest but he hopes he's exuding calm.
He was going to keep ignoring her, to retreat into his mind palace and wait her out.
He stares at the sleeping pills for a while and ends up grabbing the bottle and swallowing two. (He's a bloody doctor - he knows how to responsibly mix sleeping pills and alcohol, damn it.)
And there it was. That deep moan, ending in a shuddering breath.
After a moment Sherlock turns on his side and carefully cradles John in his arms.
was better than the one right after you jumped of a building to your bloody and horrible death…” Sherlock winced but John kept going. “I also seem to remember one where I was recently engaged and had recently discovered that you weren’t dead after all and I was both furious and elated but I had no idea which parts of my life I was furious with and which made me feel elated. So yeah, not a lot of warm fuzzy feelings about Christmas. So I’m reclaiming them. With my list.”
He was getting good at therapy. He held nothing back but rather told her, in an organized manner, everything about the touching and the tea making and the Tinder-fiasco and how being not-divorced from Sherlock was somehow very different from being not-married to him.
Nothing they hadn’t done before, but as soon as Sherlock was discharged from the hospital it became clear that the invisible force-field of Sherlock’s personal space needed to come down. John needed to support him up the stairs. He needed help getting on his shirt. He sometimes needed support just moving around the flat.
"But anyway, she wasn't close to him. Not exactly in his closest circle."
Well – that’s a lie – but that laughter helps them pretend that it is. And that’s good. That’s glorious.
John will be a mess.
"Sherlock, I'm serious. I worry about him."
Such as – just to name a completely random example - erections.
It doesn't matter, anyway. It's all in the past.
There wasn’t really room for the hand to move up further. It was pretty high up to begin with, and Sherlock can – to his shame – feel himself hardening. A blush steals over his cheeks and he shakes his head.
He didn’t even know if Sherlock looked at porn. Theirs had never been that kind of friendship, no naughty jokes or laddish comments. And if Sherlock looked at porn John didn’t know what sort of porn it was.
Not all
That dye job is honestly awful.
"Blow-jobs. The key to your happiness with John. Really, the best way to get him to agree to anything, to forgive anything and to generally get him in a pleased and pliant mood."
. He would know within seconds and that would give him all sorts of wrong ideas and that would be Not Good. So John wasn’t in any position to look at the gay porn. Even if he’d wanted to. Which he didn’t.
The smile makes a brave appearance on John's lips but doesn't manage to get anywhere near his eyes as he agrees. "Yeah. Right. She might."
"Yes, well, I'm sure he'll do excellently in finding some, after you leave. He did before he met you."
Sherlock likes Mary.
“Ah, look who didn’t delete Christmas songs! Now, that proves that you think Santa is important. This is positively sweet!”
But he should've known, he thinks as Sherlock's hands inch under his hips, urging him to raise them further. He should've known that Sherlock wouldn't be squeamish about anything, that he'd want to try everything, taste everything. And then John doesn't think anything at all anymore, because Sherlock's tongue is there, moving up from his balls. And John is making all sorts of embarrassing noises, but it's okay because Sherlock is making noises too - noises of interest and greed and joy and arousal and that makes the whole thing even hotter, as his tongue sweeps over John's hole, making it twitch and shiver. Oh, god, John had forgotten that sex could feel like this - if he ever even knew.
“I…” He licked his lips. “I was just…making conversation. I think?”
He could almost feel the other man tense. He could see his shoulders hunch, his legs inch together.
“Santa,” Sherlock said, “sounds, in this case, more like my brother than any benevolent distributor of judgment with questionable dress sense. Which is a chilling thought.”
Reginald the otter munched on his herring, grabbed his favourite stone and decided to take a short nap as the humans had finally left him alone. Then, he thought, he might start plotting his escape from this blasted cage. He was sure he'd heard somewhere recently that these days there was some sort of an immunity deal going on.
The thought was too much to bear.
He is therefore not quite as impressed as the regular person might be when Mary slips into the seat next to him on the tube the next morning, as if she’s just managed to magic up his location in all of London and can stroll up to him like it’s the easiest thing in the world.
Sherlock stands perfectly still in the living room. The silence is unnatural for a man who usually has no filter between his brain and his mouth. But then Sherlock has been displaying unusual restraint in the verbal department lately.
And John glides his hands into Sherlock's hair and this is all so wonderfully simple - not complicated at all, not something that makes everything messy, but something that helps John make sense of everything else.
“Who are the barbarians?”
“Barbarians… Stupid, stupid, barbarians. ”
"That?" Sherlock still had his eyes firmly on the bees.
The relaxed mood has evaporated.
Sherlock wonders if Mary is right next to him. He has no idea how the Watsons are communicating these days. What Mary tells John, what he feels after the Christmas from Hell – anything.
“Distributor of judgement and
“Ah, well, the night is young,” Sherlock said as he shifted beneath John, his whole body relaxed and his voice languid.
John, never much of a tech wizard, decided it was time to download Tinder to his phone.
Sherlock stared at him with undisguised horror.
“I didn’t know,” Sherlock said quickly. “I really didn’t.”
John was still a bit hung over, he hadn’t had anything for breakfast and he would like to get through this conversation and carry on with his Sunday. With proper holiday cheer, thank you very much.
John was used to not understanding things.
Sherlock pretends to mull this over. "He says it’s fine."
He should, John reasoned, treat this like a case. Like
And when Sherlock joins him there, he doesn't question that either.
To be honest, most of his life revolves around Sherlock Holmes. And that's tricky.
But he doesn't kick Sherlock out either. When night falls John turns off the telly, goes to a closet and recovers a blanket that he hands to Sherlock.
He won't be able to talk to John until she's gone. He can't look him in the face and pretend that he doesn't know that his world is about to crash.
Eye contact was completely beyond him. But looking away seemed like such a failure that his gaze settled instead on Sherlock’s lips. That was a nice compromise, wasn’t it? His lips. They seemed nice, those lips. Plump. Just, a really solid pair of lips. Nothing to complain about there. John could just keep his eyes on those and he’d get out of this situation.
“Yes,” he says. “It’s been good. My work…” He clears his throat. “It goes better when you’re there.”
And behind those secret thoughts are the ones that Mary whispers in his ear. The filthy thoughts. The ones that suggest that John would be everything Mary promises. That Sherlock could, somehow, have everything John Watson has to offer. That Sherlock could taste him everywhere and learn all his sounds.
He left her office with a sad shake of his head.
It’s resting there, quite high up, and there is a hard look in John’s eye.
“Good," Sherlock's lips curled into a soft smile. "Now, fill the kettle and start it.”
Signs of infidelity. Boring. Pedestrian. Typical. The secrets most of the population carry with them usually are. Sherlock has almost stopped noticing them.
So when John came home and Sherlock refused to stand up from his place on the sofa to help him put away the groceries, he didn’t put up a fuss.
He noticed that the CD that had been rattling around in their stereo had gone quiet. There was no sound in their living room, except for the cackling in the fire. The lights on the Christmas tree were the only electrical lighting in the room, twinkling happily, not knowing that their season was quickly coming to an end. Tomorrow they’d return to their dusty box.
. And that's nothing he's willing to apologise for.
John thought he’d probably need weeks to fully process this.
"Ah, but the client wouldn't like that, would she?"
He couldn’t help, though, thinking that there was certain reason to assume that he wouldn’t need the chocolates. That he might need to be planning not only for rewards, but also for the… Consequences.
Sherlock is certainly overwhelmed. The kiss, sweet and soft is also incredibly erotic, what with John’s hand being just millimetres way from Sherlock’s straining erection.
He's walking through Kensington Gardens, shortly before closing time, when she materialises next to him.
John’s vow to Mary has already been broken.
"Due to a small bureaucratic mishap, John, it appears that you and Sherlock are still married."
"I... I think I should go to bed," is all John can say as he downs his glass, still thinking about the tiny white coffin.
“It never occurred to me that they were
This is his elegant solution. To give Sherlock the opportunity to ask John to kindly sleep somewhere else tonight. To take his erections and his snuggling and his nightmares to his own bedroom, thanks.
Sherlock can feel John looking at him.
He sent Sherlock a couple of texts but didn't get any reply. He left for work feeling unsettled and nervous. He had a feeling that something was about to happen, and that he wouldn't especially like it when it did.
But it doesn't take forever. It just takes moments, really. Much too short for him to enjoy Sherlock's hands in his hair, to admire his trembling thighs and to revel in the sheer power he feels over his best friend, the cleverest man in London.
He wasn’t unusually dim, but living with Sherlock Holmes meant that you tended to be three steps behind.
Right?
His voice is raspy, like it hadn't been used for a while. Or if it has been used, it's been misused.
The sigh on the other end was audible.
"You'll do the thing with the eggs and the ginger and the... Whatnots?"
It works - Sherlock lights up like a lightbulb (familiar with the case even if he has no idea who the minister in question is) "John, surely even you can see..."
close, though.
Well. No. Not boring. But not relevant right now.
He glares at Olive as he walks past her.
Finally Sherlock looks up.
Clearly, Sherlock must be aware how their physical proximity affects John. Sherlock notices everything. If he was interested, it would be the easiest thing in the world for him to initiate... Something. The fact that he doesn’t speaks for itself.
!) just to keep the status quo in Baker Street?
He's even sent Nurse Idiot a letter of apology, at Ella's suggestion. Sarah called him later that day, seemingly overjoyed to get some sign that he hadn't gone completely round the bend. She’d clearly been worried that she might never reclaim this particular member of staff.
"Sherlock?"
John’s right hand slipped between Sherlock’s legs and took a light hold of Sherlock’s bollocks as he sucked all the harder.
"There'll be others," says Sherlock, sounding so confident that John feels warm all over.
surprised to find Mycroft and Sherlock both inside, Sherlock staring at the floor, Mycroft looking annoyed. Even more annoyed than usual. John couldn't actually remember seeing the brothers in quite this close proximity before. It was unsettling.
"Ah, you’re a genius, but you do have your blind spots, dear," says the woman who murdered him and winks.
This is one reason Sherlock can’t bear to contact him yet.
"So, Mycroft has Janine, the whole thing has been shut down, and no member of the Moriarty family is any concern of ours anymore?"
Mary clambers onto the roof and sits next to him, staring over the city landscape.
“Sure I can. I have someone who I understand is at my beck and call.” Sherlock smiled. “I’ll remote control you.”
Sherlock looked wary when he inched into the living room.
“In that case his assistant probably hates us.”
He feels better. Knowing that she isn't out there. That she isn't charming some other poor fucker. Starting a new family under a new name. Isn't out there shooting people.
He managed to drag Sherlock to his room, and dumped him on the bed. He pulled off his socks, and pulled a blanket over him, and was about to head to the kitchen for a much needed cup of tea when Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
“THAT THEY’RE NOT BARBARIANS!” Sherlock bellowed with unexpected force and then deflated just as quickly, looking young, lost and very, very, drunk.
But still, John made do. He trudged on, hell-bent on holiday cheer. He couldn't even understand why Sherlock was being such a Grinch about it - he hadn't been the last time they'd been living together. But now he seemed to have an angry bee in his holiday bonnet.
“Sherlock,” John said in a low voice. “I'll be here.” And he quickly grabbed Sherlock's hand and held on to it a few seconds.
"Well, it's a bit late now, isn't it?"
Sherlock's leg was much better. The cast on his arm had come off. He no longer needed intimate assistance. They hadn't stood this close for days.
"Think about what I've said. I'll be in touch."
"As I was saying," John said with an exaggerated sigh, "I know some things, but not much. For example, I was thinking...since I met you, you've never gone out with anyone."
It felt strange – body parts didn’t belong in people’s mouths. It went against something primal – but it also felt absurdly right. John struggled to make everything fit, to keep moving and keep sucking and not making a total fool of himself by choking. He allowed one of his hands to slip behind Sherlock and he grabbed his arse. He could feel Sherlock’s muscles straining, like he was fighting the urge to thrust – to fuck John’s mouth – and that was even hotter than all the rest.
"What
"I mean it, Sherlock. He was so close to giving up when I found him. Back then. And having gone that close to the brink once? It only means he now knows the way. It won't take him as long the second time to find himself there."
“It’s easy. Just start by getting up.”
By doing so they showed enough of their hand for Mycroft and his lot to ferret them out. The last operatives were… persuaded to fill in the last pieces of the picture Sherlock had already assembled of the whole web. Everything is obvious now. Even Mary’s role in it all. And that’s why she’ll be sneaking off sooner rather than later.
"I know," says Sherlock.
"We never managed that bed,” John panted.
An invitation that Sherlock seems eager to accept.
He wonders why Sherlock is here. And why he's this considerate.
And then John’s hand lifts from Sherlock’s lap and he turns away. Sherlock can feel the air disappear from his lungs.
"I suggest you try the cookies," he added. "They're pretty good."
“Don’t spoil it,” John said as he nudged Sherlock with a socked foot. “What would you do? Anything at all.”
“Within reason,” he found himself saying. He'd long since learned the wisdom of not giving any open promises to Sherlock. And then he regretted the words as soon as he saw some of that interesting light in Sherlock's eye go out.
“But… What could I possibly suspect you of? Why might I think that?”
Craig is quicker than MI6 when work like this has to be done and Sherlock is in a hurry. He needs to go lay a trap for one of the few people he’s ever called a friend.
“How was your day together?” John asks, stirring milk into two of the cups.
Sherlock tries to recover from the hit as two of the sailors hold him up, pinning his arms to his back. “Sorry… what?” Sherlock grunts.

Lestrade answered, “There’s nothing that has been found yet, but we are looking for it. There’s has to be one.” At that very moment, Sherlock clicked ‘enter’ on his laptop, sending out the mass text message. Mere seconds after Lestrade’s false statement several phones including Donovan’s and Lestrade’s went off alerting them to a single word message: ‘Wrong!’
“You have no idea.” Mike replied, thinking John was referring to the Potions laboratory at Hogwarts; he really hope John wouldn’t blow anything up here.
"Merlin! This is going to be bloody awful." Several minutes later, Mills dropped the file on James desk. He open it. He grimace within moments of opening it.
“Ah, but you couldn’t bear to be anywhere else. That’s not the John Watson I know.”
“Not truly. He usually only helps with cases where there’s clearly muggle criminals attacking magical folk. Don’t need to go breaking the statue of secrecy now.” Mike stated heartily.
Shaking his head, Mike dismissed the topic and continued, “Last I heard, you were abroad somewhere, getting shot at by muggles. What happened?” John answered simply, “I got shot.” Mike seemed taken aback.
“I, occasionally, do some potions work for the Auror department, determining which potion, how effective it was and where it was brew and so forth.” Mike stated, moving off the corner. “On more than one case however, it’s been a muggle chemical used to commit the crime. I was sent over to Bart’s to figure it out. Bump into him from time to time. Can figure out what I am looking faster than I can so get his opinion on it.”
“This one did. Will you come?”
“Well, don’t commit suicide.” A shock expression crossed the reporter’s face. That was not the reply she was expecting at all. Covering the mic, Donovan whispers something to Lestrade. “Obviously, this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions. We are all as safe as we want to be.”
“Thank you.” Greg took off down the stairs, hurrying back to his crime scene. Sherlock watched the DI leave, as if waiting for something.
“Yes, I am. Planning on staying too, I have a flatshare in mind.”
“Oh?” said the man, his grey-green eyes flicked to John before returning to Mike. “Thank you.” He stood, walking over to retrieve the phone from John. As he did, Mike introduced him. “This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end. Does that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”  He gave a small, fake smile to John, enjoying the man annoyance.
Trying to get as much out of this being invalid thing as he could, he continued “Couple of biscuits, too, if you got them.”
Sherlock gazed at him, a look of curiosity in his eyes “Anything interesting?” Sherlock asked.
“Well, that sounds like quite the adventure. How about we head over to the Leaky Caldron and you can tell me about your life among the muggles.” While Mike wasn’t quite the last person John would tell about the war, he wasn’t on top of the list either. However, it would be nice to have someone to chat with over lunch.
“Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, is giving me a deal. She owes me a favor.” At John’s curious expression, he continued, “Few years back, her husband got himself sentence to death in Florida. I was able to help out.”
“Hmm, yes.” John looked up at the taller man, untroubled by his closeness.
"Well. The sooner we start, the sooner we can close it."
“Hi, John! Mike told me you are in London.” Mels greeted, her smile shining through her voice.
“How did you know about Afghanistan?” John asked.
“I’m... It wasn’t working for me.” She replied. Molly was looking anywhere but at him.
John returned to his bedsit that afternoon. He remembered well the eventful discussion with Sherlock Holmes, his potential flatmate. As he sat on his bed, the text sent from his phone came to mind. Pulling it out, he checked the message: ‘If brother has green ladder, arrest brother SH’
“Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much” John replied, the words coming out practiced, used to saying what was wanted to be heard about the war and the conflicts.
“And you read my writing underside down,” She replied. After a pregnant pause, she continued “see what I mean?”
“Teaching, now. Potions. Bright young things like we used to be. Merlin, I hate them!” Both of them chuckle thinking of old Professor Snape and how he seemed to abhor children. John had been horrible at Potions, his record for blowing up the dungeons defeated only by a Neville Longbottom, a Gryffindor student several years behind him.
“You just wrote ‘still has trust issues’?” John accused.
“A bit of trouble too, I bet.” Sherlock watched John’s face closely, waiting for the key to achieving his assistance.
“What’s wrong with the landline?” Mike asked. He seemed off, almost nervous.
“Not in a police car. I’ll be right behind.” Sherlock replied.
“We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t know where we are meeting. I don’t even know your name.” John challenged.
“It’s Andersen.” Greg signed.
“Ah, what! Who would want me for a flatmate?” This made Mike chuckle yet again, much to John’s confusion. “What?” John asked.
“Ah, Molly.” He greeted. “Coffee, thank you.” The man stared at Molly. “What happen to the lipstick?”
“Sherlock, please” He grasp the other’s hand, shaking firmly.
“What do you think?” A smile had crossed Sherlock face for a moment.
“Yea, well, just ignore that.” Donovan insisted. “If there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I am going to bring this session to an end.”
Without hesitation the DI replied “Braxton. Lawrences Garden.”
“Four. There’s been a fourth. There’s something different this time.” Sherlock said, his attention directed out the window.
“Then who said anything about flatmates?” John glared him down.
Upon checking her phone, Donovan stated “if you all got texts please ignore them.”
Doctor John H. Watson was no ordinary man. An army doctor and former soldier of the Queen’s army home from the fight in Afghanistan. No self-respecting Muggle would believe you though, if you were to say he was a wizard. Yes, John Watson seemed quite the opposite of magical.
Harry knew he needed to direct them if he was going to get this done. "Moriarty, Mills." Both heads snap his way. Gone were the playful expressions, eyes now watchful. Harry dropped the case file on Mills' desk. "I need this to resolved carefully. No mistakes. The Minster herself is expecting results." Harry turned on his heel once Mills had picked up the file.
Clearly frustrated, Donovan called out “One more question.”
Mrs. Hudson smiled at John. “Hello, come in.” She greeted.
“Both of you” Mrs. Hudson asked, worry evident in her voice. Sherlock turned, looking her straight in the eye as he approached.
John breathed deeply, his eyes dilating “oh, God, yes.”
He was engrossed in reading about The Science of Deduction when his phone rang. John quickly answering upon seeing the caller ID. “Hello, Mels.” He greeted. Mels Mills, another old friend from Hogwarts, and his only Slytherin friend from school. Mels wasn’t as popular in Slytherin as she should have been due to being Muggleborn, so naturally she had turned to other houses to find friends.
“How did you even meet that man?” John asked, wondering how the paths of his very magical friend and such a curious muggle had crossed. John was quite blown away by him.
With a grim smile, John replied, “Nothing happens to me.”
“How do you feel about the violin?” the man questioned. John look at Mike, confused at the change of subject. Mike smirked, giving a small shake of his head.
“The body of Beth Davenport, junior minister of transport, was found late last night at a building site in greater London.” Sally Donovan sat calmly in front of two dozen reporters, all vying for the latest story. It not every day a Politian turned up dead. “Preliminary investigation suggests this was a suicide. We can confirm this apparent suicide closely resembles those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.” All three victims were projected above the detectives’ heads, their deaths showed for the whole world to see until forgotten in fifteen minutes when Doctor Who starts. “In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked. The investigation is on-going but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.”
“I’m not a Nazi!”
John wrinkles his eyebrows as he looks down at the chocolates. “Sher....I....” It only takes a moment before John figures it out. His face goes a bit pale and he flips the box lid over to read it again. His face gets its color back immediately and then some, turning a nice shade of pink.
“See!” Sherlock almost shouts.
“Yes, But you both say it’s better when I make it.” John smiles crookedly at Sherlock.
“Maybe you should hold onto the wall for a bit. Until you get your footing.” John suggests, moving them towards the wall.
“I...Alright.” John sighs, and pats his thigh. “Rosie, Love. Come here.”
He turns to see John, watching them, holding a tea towel. Sherlock steps forward and John uses the towel to dry Rosie’s hands.
“It’s alright. The war is over. Let them take you to Germany. They make nice cars.” The door to the cabin shuts and the corner of Sherlock’s mouth turns up and he turns into the room. He brings his hands up to his mouth, scanning the room and sees a radio on the far wall. He goes to it quickly, switching it on and fiddling with the dials. He picks up the mouth piece and speaks into it. “Mayday. Mayday. My name is Sherlock Holmes. I’m on the SS Queen Anne.” They radio whines in response and he turns the dial again. “Ship in distress. Mayday. Mayday.” The radio whines and a broadcast comes through.
John glances over at Sherlock, who was stirring his cocoa with his candy cane lazily. “Um... no. I think we are going to rest a bit. You go have fun.”
Putting the towel over his head, he dries his hair, making it stick up all over. He pulls the towel down, drying the drips and dampness from his beard. As the steam starts to settle in the bathroom, John gets a whiff of what smells like smoke. He sniffs again just to be sure and is about to call out to Sherlock when the shrill whine of the smoke alarm in the kitchen starts sounding.
Like clockwork, at 3:51pm, John shuffles through the door with a babbling Rosie. Sherlock can hear them struggling with the push chair, but he stays where he is until he hears them reach the landing at the top of the stairs. Sherlock darts to standing.
John gives him a small smile and stabs a piece of chicken. Rosie pounds on her tray and shrieks because no ones paying to her.
Sherlock had emerged from his room dressed for the day, wearing his normal trousers and jacket.
“No, no, Watson, that’s not for eating.” He bends over to take away the soggy paper. Rosie grunts when he takes it away, then looks up at him with teary eyes.
“I think there’s been a mistake. I think the mistake is mine.” Sherlock mumbles, staring off in thought.
“Deutschland uber alles.” The sailor says scathingly before spitting.
“Yes, Daddy, I’ve been waiting all day.” Rosie says crossing her arms.
Rosie spots the wrappings still in Sherlock’s hand and lunges for them. Sherlock holds it out of her reach as he walks into the kitchen to toss it in the bin. He closes the bin lid and Rosie lets out a frustrated grunt.
“Perhaps you should ask your father yourself.” Mrs. Hudson suggests, collecting their plates. Rosie shakes her head and downs the last of her tea.
“Oh that sounds wonderful! I remember when my sister and I went ice skating as girls. We had so much fun! We would get Hot Cocoa after.” Mrs. Hudson beams, taking a sip of her tea.
“Sherlock always performs an experiment when he wants an answer to a question. That’s what I plan to do.” Rosie sets down her cup.
Surprisingly, for how little he ate, Sherlock had a bit of a sweet tooth. John struggled to get him to eat a full meal, but he was always sneaking sweets. Small cakes and biscuits from Mrs. Hudson. Candies that John left on the kitchen counter. Sherlock told himself it was just to keep his blood sugar up during a case or an in depth experiment. He even kept a package of marshmallows hidden high in the cupboard where John couldn’t see them. The big ones, perfect for roasting and melting. Sometimes, when John was out, he’d put one on a fork and toast it over the flame of his  Bunsen Burner. Only because it made it easier to eat, not because he liked the gooey sweetness. Not at all.
Sherlock groans and bucks his hips, pressing up into his own fist, his hole squeezing around the tip of John’s finger.
“Watson... Rosamund... Your father and I, we do love one another. But we’ve only just... discussed it, recently. We were trying to decide when and how to tell you.” Sherlock explains. Rosie is almost bursting, while she quietly lets them explain.
“Never heard of me?” Arms grab around Sherlock as the men start dragging him backwards. “You’ve not read John’s blog? Everyone reads John’s blog. Even me…. On occasion.”
“What?!” John and Rosie say at the same time.
“And did he show up?” Rosie asks.
“Sherlock, don’t you think you think you should clean up this mess before John and Rosie get here?”
“Oh, John…. What’s he done this time?” She gives him a worried look holding Rosie close.
“Can I go around by myself, Daddy?” Rosie asks skating around them.
“Love you, Darling.” John says returning the kiss.
John twists his mouth. “And yesterday?”
“Clean up, then we can take Rosie down to the park to see the ducks?” John lifts his eyebrows in question.
“I know, but it’s important for Rosie to have traditions... with her family.” Sherlock  says with a small smile. John nods and starts ripping the wrappings off the package. He opens to find a plaster mold handprint ornament kit.
Sherlock looks up at him, then. “I meant what I said before. You and Rosie are always welcome here, when things get too difficult or even when they’re not. This is your home, too.”
Sherlock flopped down into his chair pulling his phone out of his jacket pocket. He pulled up a blank message to John, staring at it a minute before typing it out.
“Since Tuesday night you two have smiled at each other approximately 27 times. And those are just the times I counted. Mostly Daddy, you smile at Sherlock, but Sherlock smiles at you when you aren’t looking.”
“John did live here. For an extended period of time as I recall. He knows my habits.” He answers as he walks over to examine the plate.
After fixing a full breakfast for Rosie, Sherlock and himself, he had asked Sherlock if he minded watching Rosie for a bit so could take a quick shower. They had just finished a case the night before, and John had been too exhausted to do anything other than fall into bed the night before. He had gone down to retrieve Rosie from Mrs. H just as she had woken up.
“It’s been a while since we’ve been to Angelo’s.” John comments glancing at Sherlock.
Angelo nods. “Well then, anything for my favorite little family.” He grabs three menus and walks them over to the table in front of the window. Rosie sits facing the wall, making sure Sherlock and John were sitting across from one another.
It was 3:27pm and Rosie was vibrating with energy. She sat on the sofa, ready to go, with her hat and gloves on. And John was still not home.
She glanced every few seconds at the telly, which was playing a stereotypical holiday themed cheesy romance movie. It was a ‘Love on the Ice’ marathon. The couple had spent half of the movie accidentally running into each other in the town square during the Christmas light lighting ceremony, at a mutual friend’s Christmas party and then in front of the shop where they had literally ran into each other, sending their purchases flying. The girl finally asked the guy to meet at the skating rink in the town square. He had agreed and now he was clinging for dear life to the side of the rink. The girl was laughing at him, (good-naturedly, of course). He reaches out for her hand, they stumble but she catches him and they end up staring into one another’s eyes.
The captain is holding his ground in front of the ships wheel, surrounded by Nazi soldiers. Directly in front of him is a Nazi officer, his back to the door. He’s short, probably the shortest man in the room, but all eyes were on him as he spoke in German to the Captain.
Mycroft.
“Do you have a case for us, Watson?” Sherlock asks, his eyes narrowing. John snorts, but Sherlock shoots him a glance and he quiets, looking at Rosie.
“You’re going to wear that to go ice skating?” Rosie asks.
Rosie, who had her skates on but still unlaced, hobbled over to Sherlock. “Oh come on, Sherlock, please! You promised!”
“Yes, Love. How about Friday? The surgery closes at three so I’ll be home early. We could go to dinner first?” John says. Rosie jumps up and down, squealing.
“Lock too?” Rosie asks him. John’s mouth sets as he brushes his fingers through Rosie’s blond curls.
“Hello, Rosie, Love. Please don’t tell me you sat in that spot all day? That’s where I left you with your cereal this morning.” John says coming to stand over her. She grins up at him.
“Though her exact position was kept a secret in fear that spies might give her up to the Axis, it’s been reasonably determined that she was just south of the Plantagenet Bank when she went missing. Less that 60 feet of water, yet she was never found.”
John tears his eyes away from staring at the molded chocolates to glance up at Sherlock, who was looking more and more apprehensive. “This is you?”
Sherlock holds the wall and starts shuffling along, John moving along next to him, waiting to catch him again if he fell.
He didn’t even hear the next morning when Mrs. Hudson brought up some tea. He finally emerged from his thoughts around 10:00 am to find a cup of tea next to him, cold. He took a sip anyway and made a face.
“Aye.” The captain answers pulling up to take another swing. Sherlock manages to get one hand free and pushes the captain’s hand down.
“Aye?”
“Sound asleep.” Sherlock reports, taking the glass.
“NoPe.” Rosie pops her ‘P’ looking out the window and trying not to grin. The cab pulls away from Angelo’s and heads to Somerset House.
Only it didn’t quite work.
When it was time to shape the cookies and Sherlock decided that this was prime time for a long, hot bath John didn’t say a word.
He could remember holding his mum's hand on a number of occasions. The first day at school, in the crowds downtown before Christmas, when walking on the beach during some holiday. But he could  never remember holding his dad's hand. But there - at the end - he had. When his dad seemed beyond both hearing and seeing and was slowly slipping away, John had held his hand. Just to reassure them both that he wasn't facing the journey ahead alone.
To top it off Sherlock was in a right mood, breaking cutlery, torturing his violin and sleeping more than was healthy.
"Well, clearly my client's twin was sleeping with the leader, which led to her murder. It wasn't a case of mistaken identity at all."
He picks up the phone once it's stopped ringing.
And all Sherlock can think is:
That sort of people lobbied against pornography, argued about how it was degrading for everyone involved in making it and filled the heads of the consumers with wrong and dangerous ideas about sex.
"I know that you won't be able to manage this alone.” She pushes a mug of tea into his hands. “I mean, you won't pull this off all by yourself. You'll need a lot of help from John to get to where you two are going. Which is as it should be. But John needs to know that you two are headed in the same direction. And he won’t be trying to steer the two of you in any direction if he keeps thinking you’re asexual."
Sherlock holds himself rigid and doesn't look at John. Which is good, because John can feel that he’s gone bright red there in the darkness.
"And where are those minions now?"
But he can’t seem to be able to put his objections into words. Can't even broach the subject.
"You're cute when you're all dramatic," she says with a smile as she wraps her scarf around her neck. "Oh, and for the record?" She glances over her shoulder. "We've never really tried the hardcore BDSM stuff, so I wouldn't know about the handcuffs. But given a little more time I'm sure he would've been willing to try a bit more than the traditional blindfolds and ostrich feathers." She winks at him and disappears down the stairs.
But in the end, it had all turned out for the best. When the pieces fell to the ground they slotted together. Into something new but still recognizable. Something lovely, even, but fragile. Like it was yet to be completed.
"Nightstand," Sherlock gasps. His eyes have closed and his head is thrown back, and John has started to wonder if he'd be able to come from nipple play alone. But that's a theory to test at a later time, now he wants to get Sherlock out of his pyjama bottoms. He wants to smell, he wants to touch and possibly even taste.
to get us sorted," Sherlock said. "That was the whole point of him. He promised to get this undone. Quickly."
The wedding night was spent in a high chase on snowmobile. The next afternoon they flew back to London, pleased with a job well done and a handsome fee from Mycroft in the bank. The event was hardly spoken of again, except in jest, when fighting over money or household chores.
But those thoughts are - as they've always been - forbidden. But now even the very awareness of them is tainted. They, the most private of musings, feel as if Mary has her fingerprints all over them.
Surely "they" can't move anywhere.
Sherlock is gone again.
He’s wanted this.
"Sherlock?"
“I’m sorry. It’s none of my business. I just wondered. How far you’d be willing to go. For a case.” It sounds feeble even to his own ears.
"John, there's been a small complication."
The following morning John felt like he was acting in a boring, hyper-realistic indie film as he and Sherlock sat in silence at the kitchen table, rigidly going through the motions of a shared meal without speaking.
"Cheers."
And so John sits there, on the sofa, feeling every inch that separates them, pathetically counting down the minutes until they can go to bed and touching will be allowed again.
All he knows is that John is kissing him – finally. And it doesn’t feel like horniness or revenge. It feels soft and full of promise.
He makes a grab for the nightstand, rummages about for the bottle of lube and as he twists away from Sherlock, he can feel him go for his back.
It's not a date, he tells himself. He's just being nice. He's thanking Sherlock for taking care of him for the past few weeks.
But he couldn’t accurately recall the feel of Sherlock’s lips on his.
He scoffed when John ordered himself a cinnamon latte at Starbucks.
"Well, it did work," John felt duty bound to point out.
But tonight everything still felt magical and beautiful. This odd, in-between time hovering between Christmas and a brand new year stretched out between them. It felt like they were floating in a place that didn’t properly exist. A place of immunity.
But he doesn't.
He sighed, downed the rest of his beer, and made his way home. He needed to get his head around this.
When John and Sherlock will have confirmation of where Mary will run to they’ll need to leave quickly. Molly is the more able-bodied Godmother and John knows that she won’t refuse.
Mycroft, however, spoke.
"I know,” said John and frowned. “But you…you said some other stuff as well.”
"And why didn't we call Lestrade? Surely we've seen enough criminal activity in the last hour to involve the Met."
Sherlock said nothing.
And neither would anyone else.
"You could also stay," he says. "If you're that concerned about how he'll cope with you leaving."
John blinked at him.
The alcohol had made his mind sluggish and difficult to manage – and yet the drunkenness seemed to open up some possibilities that hadn’t been there before. He had a feeling Sherlock knew where this conversation was headed, but he certainly didn’t.
"You can't afford it," says Sherlock, again without looking up.
However, he notices his hands shaking a bit when he pours the wine.
"Thanks." John tries to say more, but he can't. And it doesn't matter, Sherlock understands anyway.
“Christ, you almost gave me a heart attack. If I'd been armed...”
Sherlock feels flushed and he’s sweating. His heart is thundering and his mind is racing. One layer of it is trying to calculate the airplane’s precise location based on flight duration, speed and wind. Another layer is sorting out everything it has on file about A.G.R.A. for the meet-up with Mary, learning the layout of the city, going over a few language lessons. Making plans and back-up plans and alternate plans. But the strong undercurrent of his mind, threatening to drown everything else out – that’s all John.
At least John didn’t think so until he found Sherlock drunk in the sitting room at two in the afternoon.
"Sherlock!" John is speaking through his teeth, battling the urge to tear at his hair. "We agreed. No aiding and abetting criminals! No matter how interesting the puzzle!"
But SHOULD a landlord ask the question, John can't very well say that, could he? Not while looking at Sherlock's face.
He is trembling and not even sure why. Fury, yes, certainly. Humiliation, partly. But there is also a jumble of other stuff and he would very much like to go back to his non-feeling state of the last few weeks. He can't deal with a meltdown now. Especially not a meltdown that everyone seems to have been expecting, god damn it.
“I have no idea what I’m doing,” John warned him, as he nuzzled Sherlock’s groin with his cheek.
He got the wine and John put his rice-masterpiece on the table along with the curry and it was lovely. Civilised.
The next kiss is greedier. Sherlock wants to feel everything. His fingers tear at John’s shirt, eager to touch the soft skin underneath it, and he licks and nibbles John’s lips, his jaw, his neck.
John jerked upright in his chair and scrambled for a gun that wasn't there before he realised that Sherlock was slumped on the sofa and was silently watching John.
Sherlock stilled under his touch. John wasn’t sure, but he imagined that he could feel him holding his breath.
He leaned forward in his chair, until his knees tipped over and onto the floor. In another situation with someone else, John might have waited for Sherlock to make the final step. He might have sat there and watched him struggle, thinking that this was Sherlock’s move and he wouldn’t interfere.
Drinking alone, John thought, was becoming a rather distressing habit in the hours since he'd learned of his ongoing marriage to Sherlock.
"Will someone," he grit out, "tell me what the bloody hell is going on?"
Sherlock came out of the bathroom, his curls damp and his skin flushed, just as John carefully moved the hot cookies from the sheet and on to a plate. He’d put on some Christmas music, the kettle had just boiled and he’d set the table for two.
"Of course it's not the Mafia," Sherlock whispers between clenched teeth. "It's just a little gang. Mafia wannabes at most. I don't expect them to become well known for another four or five years, at least."
Another option, a little voice whispers, is to go for the nightstand drawer. To go for his gun. To take the option that would neatly solve all of his problems, once and for all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock isn’t comfortable talking about this sort of stuff. But he tries.
Staying in works better, anyway, John thinks. More casual. More privacy. Not THAT sort of privacy, just enough privacy to discuss things. Classified things. Things he should've talked about to Sherlock weeks ago, but was unable to.
Sherlock's injuries were healing. Sherlock didn’t need as much help.
They pick up some food on the way home and eat in front of the telly. It feels relaxed, in a way that nothing has since before Magnusson, and oddly domestic.
He let his eyes wander over the bookshelves, half-looking for a suitable book, before his eyes landed on that damned Moroccan slipper. Excellent. He grabbed the slipper and tipped out its contents before turning back to Sherlock, who was still facing the wall, head bowed, like John’s hands were still holding him in place.
They stumbled together into Sherlock’s bedroom, and standing within Sherlock’s most private place in the world John felt almost overwhelmed with the potential of the moment.
But Sherlock persisted, even though the alcohol was clearly about to overpower him. For a recovering addict he had a surprisingly low tolerance. “Promise, John? It really wasn’t my fault.”
"Yes, I imagine he loves you still," he says, his sentences as stiff as his posture, there upon the roof of 221B with the woman who won John Watson's heart and tried to murder Sherlock.
How does a man proceed, following this sort of a revelation?
His hand was already in the air, flying downwards for the fifth smack when he fully registered that he was hard.
Sherlock stares at him, at loss for words.
He can hear Sarah ask one of the receptionists to clean up the tea in his office.
"Seriously," she says, as she starts up the kettle. "It's important. It's important to him."
"Well, John, this has been a long time coming, hasn't it?"
But Sherlock doesn’t care about her.
"Nope," Sherlock says, popping the p. "And really, John, you should try to be a little more ambitious in choosing passwords for your online banking needs than you are with your email."
After a prolonged silence he gives up on his idea of a heart to heart. He grabs for a topic from the newspapers at random.
“Come on, Sherlock. We’ll talk in the morning. Or later tonight. Whenever you wake up. Okay? Up you get.”
c) If John decides this is all a horribly bad idea - does he have to break up with Sherlock Holmes? (Because John isn’t eager to try sex-less life as a permanent lifestyle choice.)
“Yeah, sure, it’s a thankless job trying to civilise me, I’m sure everyone wishes I could be just a bit more like you, eh?”
"I know," said John. "I happened to get married there myself. Lovely place, excellent polar bear, top-notch snow mobiles. Would recommend it to a friend. Sorry you couldn't be there."
He rubs his temples as he makes his morning cup of tea. He's getting a headache.
John decided not to dwell on it.
"Blow-jobs, Sherlock."
And then he glared again, every morning after that, when Sherlock gleefully pointed out the coal someone had taken great pleasure in placing inside John’s stocking.
Well, yes, he did. He knew his way around a hospital; as a doctor, a family member and a patient. So he read Sherlock's file, he fiddled with the bed-settings, he sent texts to Mycroft and Lestrade updating them on the situation (“upsetting but not dire”). And then - then he waited. He sat there and waited next to the man he'd just declared his husband.
It's good, isn't it?
aware of it yourself, aren't you?" She peers her eyes at him. Like she's trying to measure the levels of his self-ignorance.
"What do you mean?"
Again, he doesn't stop playing.
"It's curious," he says instead, "that up here, where no-one can hear us, you still use your English accent. Even though we both know that it isn't yours."
Sherlock seems to understand the phantom of candles in the room, though, when he looks at the table John has set for them. His eyes linger on the table, as if to figure out what is missing.
When they sit down, the atmosphere is oddly formal - almost tense.
Well. He might be ready to give up on love. Maybe. But he isn't ready to give up on sex just yet, thank you very much.
"Mrs. Hudson doesn't text," John points out.
John could feel himself get dizzy.
“I could ask you to do all the shopping for a month, but...” Sherlock shrugged. “You already do that, don't you? Should I ask you to give me free access to any one of your possessions? Because that would be pointless - I hardly consider limited access to be a problem as things stand.” John glared at him.
“Why? You’ll do it regardless.”
He knows that she likes to see him wrong-footed. She likes to see him confused. She almost gets off on it, to have Sherlock Holmes, supposed mastermind, baffled. Because of her.
Sherlock could answer in so many ways.
“Most things are,” John agreed as he edged into the flat. “What did he do?”
And so John does. Sherlock doesn't disappoint, his sigh when John's lips touch him is almost broken, his taste is deep and intimate and when John has done enough licking and mouthing and takes him as far down as he can, John feels as if they were made for this, as if he could do this forever.
He’ll just have to go out there and be Sherlock Holmes for John.
He can almost smell the coals, the lamp oil, the filth of the nineteenth century – which is not a comforting smell on board a small metal tube that’s supposed to carry you high above the ground for thousands of miles.
She stands up lightly and moves towards the window. She's wearing some cross between civilian clothing and her assassin-wear. It's black and tight and probably easy to move around in, but doesn't really stand out.
"Right. Okay. So it should all be sorted quite..." John trailed off and then glared at Mycroft. "Been aware of it for quite some time? What does that mean?"
His breathing is erratic and his throat feels tight. And through it all… John holds him. One hand is still hidden under the coat, but the other one wraps around Sherlock, his cheek rests against Sherlock’s forehead and he just… holds him. Like he can understand just a little bit of what happened. Like he cares.
“It is. But it doesn’t make the receiver feel any more obligated.” John gives him a crooked smile.
*                        *                      *
John stands, leaving the box on his chair and standing close to Sherlock, helping him with the buttons of his shirt.
“I said… Take off your clothes.”
Rosie puts her chin on her fist, looking dreamily between John and Sherlock. “Tell me about the first time you ate here.”
“Aye, you can put me down, man. But I’ll not let go of this wheel. So till we meet in hell!” The captain spits at the officer. The officer gives a short command in German and the solider standing next to him fires his pistol that was trained on him. The captain falls and slumps to the side, still gripping the wheel.
“The point of gift giving is to give and not expect anything in return,  is it not?” Sherlock says a little confused.
John turns and thumps back down the stairs to his room in ‘C’. He had moved his bed and his clothes downstairs last year when they had decided that Rosie needed a room of her own and a bit more privacy. Well, it was more like Molly had hinted that maybe Rosie need more space to herself. They had cleaned up and repainted ‘C’ within a week and John moved his things downstairs.
Sherlock’s face falls and he rolls back on his heels, bringing a hand to his mouth. There’s sound of keys in the door, and men speaking German on the other side of the door. “Hello? Hello?” Sherlock ducks into a darkened corner of the room as the man enters and steps into the darkness, only a small lamp lighting up the radio as the announcer continues.
John gives her a bewildered look. “Water.” He states. “For all of us.” Angelo nods and leaves to get their waters.
The cabbie helped Sherlock get the tree down from the roof and left Sherlock standing among his bags and boxes from the Christmas shop.
“Then what kind of uniform is that then?” He takes another hit to the side. “Sprechan Sie Deutsch, ja?”
“John, I know you said you didn’t want to fuss over Christmas or gifts this year. But Mrs. Hudson said that a baby’s first Christmas is an important traditional milestone. So I purchased a few things for you and Rosie.” Sherlock picks up the medium octagon shaped gift on the table and hands it to John. “This ones for both of you.”
John sighs happily and stands to head into the bathroom. He returns a few minutes later all buttoned back up, carrying a warm, wet flannel. He leans over Sherlock again, dipping in for a soft kiss, wiping up his chest and belly.
“If I would’ve known it was that easy, I would’ve had you over every night.” John jokes.
Right. We’ll be there.
“No, just a bit anxious. I’ve been waiting for you all day.” Sherlock says a bit breathless.
Sherlock sits back in his chair, steepling his fingers again. “Try one then.”
“...ring, making spirits bright.... that is how it goes, and she liked it..... sleighing song tonight! Oh! Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! Jingle all the way....” John stands up with Rosie on his hip and bounces her around the room, singing and poking her in the stomach, making Rosie giggle. Sherlock watches them and the corners of his mouth turn up.
“What’s that? Eh?”
“Are you going to play some carols for us, then?” John asks with a crooked smile.
Sherlock is hoisted up and then set down on a hard ship deck, the rain pelting down around him. His face is patted by a cold clammy hand and he coughs, spitting up a bit of bitter ocean water.
“What’s that?”
“Thank you, Daddy!”
John leans up to kiss him softly. Sherlock tries to dip his tongue in to taste the chocolate in his mouth, but John pulls back too soon. He finishes unbuttoning the shirt, then straightens it on Sherlock’s shoulders.
Rosie thinks a minute. “Do you think they are in love?”
They move into a lit hall, with papered walls and thick decorative carpet underfoot. Luxury Liner.
“Yes, Bee, Fire is hot. Very good. That’s why we mustn’t touch it.” He pulls his marshmallow off the fork and looks it over before popping it into his mouth.
“What is going on? Anderson?”
“Inconclusive. Not enough data to support your hypothesis.” Sherlock cuts in, steepling his fingers under his nose.
“I rather like it when you smile at me.”
They return shortly, with three hot cocoas with a candy cane in each one. John passes one to Sherlock and sits next to him. Rosie sits next to John and stirs her cocoa with her candy cane.
“I guess so, Daddy.” Rosie frowns a bit but sits and starts unlacing her skates.
He grabs the throw blanket off the back of John’s chair, spreading it out on the floor in front of the coffee table. He sets Rosie in the middle of it and goes to fetch her bag from under the coat rack. He returns to Rosie’s side and sits cross legged next to her. She looks up at him with interest.
Sherlock takes a few more bites before picking up his plate and taking it to the sink. John joins him at the sink to rinse his own plate.
“There’s another?” John raises an eyebrow.
Rosie skates around and passes them before they even make it to the first curve. She makes another lap and skates up to John as he an Sherlock are making their way around the first curve. She was having a good time skating by herself and going fast, forgetting a little about her observations of Sherlock and John.
“Love you, Sherlock.” Rosie says giving him one last squeeze.
“So demanding. Maybe I should start leaving her down with Mrs. H, again. She’s learning bad habits from you.” John says with a smirk as he stands to face Sherlock.
“Excuse me.” The man holds his ground. Sherlock looks down and his eyes almost bug out of their sockets.
Sherlock clears his throat. “There’s a shop in Soho. Where they do the casting. I.. thought maybe you would like it. It’s alright if you don’t.”
“It was lovely. I’m sure she’ll come to appreciate it as she gets older.” John takes a sip of his whisky. Sherlock gives him a shy smile. “This is nice. It’s been a while since we just sat. Enjoyed each others company.” John says taking another sip of whisky.
Sherlock frowns. “It’s not just me. It’s a business. They have other clients. As I said, John, if you don’t like them just say.”
Sherlock looks up at him quickly. “We can take those stale Hobnobs to feed them!”
He takes time to clear the counters of stray experiment parts and laboratory supplies. When he finished, he looked at the clock on the kitchen wall and it read 3:26pm. He rebuttoned his sleeves and put his jacket back on before going back into the sitting room to wait for John and Rosie to arrive.
John looks at Sherlock for a moment. “Yes, I did. I still do.” Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to blush. A waiter comes to the table with their food. They eat quickly, with Angelo checking on them a few times. When they finish, John insists on paying even when Angelo tells them it’s on the house.
“I think you’ve been spending to much time with Molly Hooper.” Now it’s Rosie’s turn to roll her eyes.
“A whole lot of nothing.” Craig starts to get more animated. “I pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the DIFC’s satellite which early this morning sent a picture of a ship which suddenly appeared in the middle of the Atlantic.”
“Time to finish the ornament.” John says, startled. Sherlock grabs Rosie up off the floor and follows John into the kitchen.
“Yes, that’s fine. Be careful.” John answers. Rosie skates off, joining to other skaters rounding the rink.
“Where’s Daddy?” Rosie asks picking up her cocoa and sitting next to Sherlock.
“I don’t speak German.”
Oh. Sure. What time?
“Gran?” Rosie calls out.
“It looks lovely.” There’s a crash from the kitchen as Sherlock drops the tea canister.
“Daddy doesn’t like it when you roll your eyes at me.” Rosie states flatly.
“It has.” Sherlock gives him a small smile. (Rosie misses that one.)
“In the Fuhrer’s Secret Service?”
The smoke alarm still screams as Sherlock drags a chair over to where John is, stepping up onto it with his sticky foot. Sherlock presses the button and it stops beeping.
“Hi Daddy!” She beamed.
“Granny H said she had a roast on. She said for us to come down to fix a plate at 6:00.”  She calls to them.
“Do you think that Thai place we used to order from is still open on Christmas Eve?” John says pulling out his phone.
John rolls his eyes. “That’s impossible.”
“Is this a magnifying glass?” John asks lifting it up to the light.
“I’ll make us some tea. Why don’t you and Rosie go into the sitting room? She has some toys in her bag.” John says. Sherlock gives him a small smile and adjusts Rosie on his hip. He grabs a raspberry biscuit on his way to the sitting room.
John collects their skates and returns them to the rental counter, while Rosie laces up her shoes.
“You’ve taught her so much. Maybe we shouldn’t smile at each other so much.”
“Please.” John steps back to let Craig in.
The man holding him reaches into his pocket, pulling out his wallet and pulling out one of the ridiculous business cards that John had made up. “Sherlock Holmes, Private Detective. Sorry, never heard of you.”
John glances down at his phone and there’s no reply from Mycroft. He stalks over the open door to the flat. “Mrs. Hudson!” He bellows.
Rosie heads upstairs to change into her pajamas and by the time she gets back downstairs, John and Sherlock are already in their chairs, a fire going in the fireplace.
“Dinner?” Sherlock’s face goes blank. John shakes his head.
“Sure, darling, it’s not too cold out.” John says pulling up the zip of his own coat.
Rosie decides to intervene.
John’s lips hover just over Sherlock’s. “Sit back in your chair. Leave the shirt.” He gives him one last soft kiss.
John finally comes with long drawn out groan, working himself over and painting Sherlock’s chest with long heavy ropes of cum. John slides down to the floor again before his legs give out and nuzzles into Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock’s hand finds its way to John’s hair, playing through it. John’s eyes flutter closed.
“Well, you can relax. There’s no war. Not in the Atlantic, anyway.” Sherlock says.
Sherlock hands him the second package. “This is for Rosie.”
Rosie turns her attention back to the telly, where the latest couple was walking through the park for their date at the skating rink. They were walking quietly side by side, stealing smiles at eachother.
Rosie does as she’s asked and goes to sit on her fathers knee.
“Your usuals, then?” Angelo asks.
After about a twenty minute ride, they pull up in front of Baker Street. John hands Rosie some bills out of his wallet and lets her pay the cabbie as Sherlock climbs out and opens the door to the flat.
“I’m not acting strangely.” Rosie defends.
John does, lifting the lid, then a thin piece of tissue paper that lays on top. Underneath are three medium sized molded chocolates. One dark chocolate, one white chocolate, and one milk chocolate. They were molded in an odd shape, sloped to a ‘v’ in the center with a wrinkled, bumpy surface on the inside.
“You’re the one instilling tradition. You have to teach her the words.” John says picking Rosie up to sit on the chair with her on his lap.
“But I should have. I am sorry, Sherlock.” John says catching his eye.
“Sherlock’s in trouble, Mrs. H. Can you sit with Rosie, please? She’s just woken up from her nap. I’m not sure how long I’ll be. If she gets to be too much, call Molly or Greg.” John grabs his coat and shrugs into it. Mrs. Hudson goes and picks Rosie up from the floor.
The captain steps up to Sherlock again. “I’m done foolin’ about. There’s a war on. And in it or no, I don’t plan to lose me mind, nor me ship, to the likes of a jackal like you.”
Sherlock nods. “I will.” Mrs. Hudson retreats back down the stairs. Sherlock pops the raspberry biscuits into his mouth as he makes his way to the bathroom. He stops short grabbing the bin, and scoops the mess from the table into it before heading into the bathroom for a shower.
“Come on, Sherlock. It will be fun. Rosie will be disappointed if you don’t.”
“So your saying the Queen Anne just disappeared?”
“Oh, you speak English do you? How’d you like for me to knock you into next week?” John fists into Sherlock’s borrowed uniform, shoving him back.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, putting the instrument under his chin.
“Oh look at that, we’ve made Sherlock smile. Take a look Rosie, it doesn’t happen very often.” John says, stage whispering into Rosie’s ear. Sherlock rolls his eyes dramatically as he puts the violin and bow down in his chair. John grins at Rosie as he turns to take her into the kitchen.
“Maybe you could ask Molly to take you, the next time you stay over with her.” Sherlock offers as he and John take seats in their chairs.
“John..” Sherlock’s fingers dig into the arms of his chair as he struggles to keep his hips still. John pulls back with another filthy slurp, adjusting his position and leaning in again. He leaves kitten licks in a circle around Sherlock’s rim, before attempting to wiggle his tongue inside.
“Bugger! JOOHHN!!” Comes Sherlock’s loud bellow through the door, accompanied by a squeal from Rosie.
“I know... I’m sorry for that.” John says softly. “For all of it. I never said...”
“Aww... do we really have to go already?” Rosie whines.
“No.. no, it’s not September 3rd. It’s November 16th. Look.” Sherlock pulls back his sleeve, showing the date on his watch.
Sherlock and Rosie meet John at the rental counter and they exit out onto the pavement. Sherlock steps to the curb to hail them a cab. Rosie climbs in first, and John and Sherlock after her. John puts his arm around Rosie as the cab pulls out into traffic.
“Sherlock, when was the last time you ate anything?” John asks.
“I like your smile too.”
“Oh. Alright.” John looks over his shoulder at Rosie and then to Sherlock who shrugs sheepishly. Rosie looks back at the telly, her couple was now sitting tying their ice skates sitting side by side on a bench. The girl pulls her laces tight and snaps one of them. “Oh, shoot!” She exclaims. The guys gets down in front of her on one knee and the girl blushes. Rosie giggles. The guy ties the girl’s skate with the broken lace, secure enough for now.
“It’s wonderful!” He beams.
On Friday, the Love on the Ice marathon ended and picked up with Coffee Shop romances. Rosie collected data and scenarios, just as Sherlock would do. John left for work at 7:45 to catch the tube, leaving Rosie with toast and tea. Sherlock was still in bed when Rosie finally packed up her coloring things at 11:30. She knew Granny H would want her down for lunch, and she was going to take a shower and get dressed after.
“You took a mold of your arsehole and had chocolates made for me?” John almost laughs.
at him.
“What’s our current position?” Sherlock asks.
John starts spooning out some noodles for Rosie onto her high chair tray, while Sherlock starts digging into his curry straight from the container with his fingers.
John hangs his coat after a long day at the clinic and shuffles into the kitchen to switch on the kettle. He can hear Sherlock moving around faintly in the bedroom before the door opens and he strides into the kitchen. His arms find their way around John’s waist and he nuzzles into his neck from behind.
John turns and moves over to her. “What’s all over your face...and all over the floor? Sherlock?” He turns to Sherlock, who has taken the smoke detector off of the ceiling. “Oh no! You leave that up there. WITH the batteries IN!”
“No, ‘ock, NO!” She repeats, her eyes tearing up. Sherlock panics and grabs a shortbread biscuit off the plate on the table, handing to her. Rosie gives a semi-contented sigh as she shoves the biscuit into her mouth.
“Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock calls as he tries to get through the front door with the tree. He left it in the foyer and went back outside to collect the bags. When he got back into the foyer with the bags, Mrs. Hudson was coming out her door, wiping her hands on a tea towel.
“You two have been shut up here in the flat since Christmas. It would be good for you to get out.” John comments. Rosie jumps up.
“Deustchland uber alles? Hold on…” Sherlock tries to pull back.
“I gave the original images to Sherlock so he could use them as navigational aids. He was in a hurry.”
“Can I at least change into some jeans?” John asks hanging up his coat.
“Peace? It’s September 3rd, 1939, man. Hitler has entered Poland. We’ve been boarded by goose-stepping hooligans, so don’t speak to me of peace, lad. Tell Mother England.” The captain says angrily.
Sherlock lets out a soft sound, his leg twitching. John chuckles, pulling back. “Jumpy?”
“Maybe I should what?” John asks looking up at him. “Start coming round more?”
John almost barks out a laugh but it comes out more like a puff of air. “What’s this?” He looks up at Sherlock again, whose face has changed a bit. John can see the apprehension behind his eyes.
“EADS UK-DMC2 100k swath imaging. You’ll have to find someone with the Ministry of Defense to get it.” Craig answers.
“I say we cut him open and see what color he bleeds!”
“In the kitchen, dear!” Mrs. Hudson calls back. Rosie walks through the sitting room and back to the kitchen, where Mrs. Hudson was laying out lunch of tuna salad sandwiches and apple slices. Rosie takes a seat at the table swinging her dangling legs.
John nods. “Sherlock’s been a part of our family since you were born and we just wanted you to know that this won’t change anything.” John tells her.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “We’ve told you 100 times before.”
“I do. And I love you, John.”
“That’s one story.”
“Let’s give him the heave-ho!”
Sherlock gives the cabbie the address of the Christmas shop he researched online. Once there, Sherlock successfully picks out all of the items needed to decorate a traditional Christmas tree. Plus a few additional items for the flat.
“We want the table by the front, please.” Rosie states. Angelo looks at John.
“My good little doctor.” Sherlock smiles to himself, going to the desk to work on his laptop.
The captain pulls back, hitting him again. “Speak the truth, man!”
Rosie sat on the floor of 221B surrounded by sketch pads, colored pencils and coloring books of every type. The sketch pad was open to a half drawn picture of Sherlock in a Christmas jumper. She was currently coloring an anatomically accurate picture of a heart in the Human Body coloring book that Sherlock had given her for Christmas. She had one of her father’s old, outdated medical textbooks open to the middle pages with the clear plastic overlays that illustrated the flow of blood through the heart. She was copying the flow of blood with red and blue colored pencils.
John bends to pick up the box. “We’ll just have to save it for later.” He replaces the tissue paper and lid.
“We could open the other presents?” Sherlock suggests, handing Rosie back to John.
Rosie steals a glance into the kitchen.
“That’s why I suggested, Sherlock. Anyway, here are the biscuits for your party. I’m headed out to my sister’s now. The flat looks lovely.” She reaches out the squeeze his forearm. “Do you need anything else?”
“I love you, you know that?”
“I had a nap in the shower today....” Sherlock avoids John’s eyes.
"Oh, but it's Rosie's first. She's almost a year old. She'd be so lovely with all the lights and colors. And Father Christmas and you know how she loves your music. You could play her Jingle Bells..."
“The Queen Anne? The luxury liner.” John confirms a bit bewildered.
“Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh! Hey!” John belts out the last line, throwing his free arm out. Rosie squeals and cackles. John turns to face Sherlock, who lowers his instrument, smiling widely at them.
All the color drains from Sherlock’s face as he stands up straight. “John...” he whispers, panicked, then louder, “John!”
John pulls back, looking up at him. “Touch yourself for me.”
“Somerset House.” Rosie tells the driver.
“If you’re so concerned, John maybe you should...” Sherlock snaps his mouth shut.
“Or I could put her down here? If you don’t mind. She’ll sleep anywhere.”
John smiles and takes the last steps towards Sherlock. He puts a hand on his arm. “No, I’m not angry, Sherlock. It’s...” They are interrupted by a thump and a rustle of the tree, followed by Rosie whimpering. They turn to see Rosie, sitting  flat on her bum in front of the tree. One of the silver balls rolled away from her. They both move to her and Rosie looks up at Sherlock with tears in her eyes. She points at the tree and babbles to him. Sherlock reaches to pick her up.
Sherlock stood by the window tuning his violin in the early morning light. He had been composing a lot of the last few months, working hard on a piece for Rosie.
John huffs, holding his towel in one hand and reaching across the kitchen table with his other, to switch off the gas to the Bunsen Burner.
“Easy boys! Easy! Steady up! Hold on mates! He’s almost up! That’s it! Give him a big pull! That’s it! Don’t drop him now. Come on. Pull him over. Put your backs into it!”
“Wine.” Rosie says quickly.
“Did you sing?”
“Yes. Repurposed, I believe is what the shop attendant said.” Sherlock says with a thin smile.
He runs his tongue up the center of Sherlock’s cheeks, smearing the melted white chocolate over his hole. Sherlock lets out a soft sigh, leaning his head back on the chair a bit but still not taking his eyes off John.
Rosie shrugs. “I don’t know. They smile at eachother a lot. I’ve been counting. Twenty two times since I started counting on Tuesday evening. Mostly it’s Daddy smiling at Sherlock but Sherlock smiles at Daddy when he’s not looking. Or if he gets a text from him during the day. If they are already in love, that would explain that why Daddy doesn’t go on dates.”
John looks down at the box and picks up the milk chocolate one, holding it up and looking it over. “Mmm... this does look like you. I can see it now.” John runs a finger over the bumps and ridges, before bringing the chocolate to his lips, looking across at Sherlock. He bites slowly into the chocolate and white vanilla filling oozes out from the second half. He picks up a second chocolate and drizzles the filling from the first over its center. He sticks the point of his tongue into the center, licking over the furled mold, licking up the filling and melting some of the chocolate in the process. Sherlock lets out a stifled whimper.
Lestrade hands Moriarty Sherlock’s wallet that he had left in his clothes. Moriarty looks at it and gives another order. The men holding Sherlock start dragging him out the door again.
She clicks her tongue. "Christmas is in three days and you boys haven't decorated?"
“I believe they are, yes. They were last year, if you recall.” Sherlock adds the last bit quietly. John had been here on Christmas Eve last year. He had stayed with Sherlock for a few months after he had been shot... by Mary. John had gone back to stay with Mary after they returned from the Holmes family Christmas.
Rosie looks out her window taking up as much of the seat as possible and pretending she’s not there.
Sherlock nods and smiles into his whisky as he takes a sip. “Merry Christmas, John.”
“What do you mean?”
“Of course, my love. It makes it more romantic.” Angelo gives her a wink and heads to the back of the restaurant. Rosie giggles.
One of the sailors scoffs. “Is that a name? Sherlock?”
Sherlock does as instructed and together they press Rosie’s hand down onto the wet plaster. She squirms and Sherlock has to hold her tighter. She pouts a little when the plaster squishes between her fingers. John lifts her hand up and she looks at the plaster on her hand and then holds it higher for Sherlock to see. She grunts and then babbles.
“Let’s hurry, Little Bee! Your father is taking us to feed the ducks! Let’s get you cleaned up.”
John steps into the sitting room putting his phone in his shirt pocket. “What? What is it?”
“Waiting for the murderer to show up.” John says, with a bit more composure.
“Case!” Rosie squeals back. They can hear Mrs. Hudson answer the door and there are heavy steps on the stairs. John stands and goes to open the door to the flat.
"I wish to purchase a Christmas Tree." He said matter-of-factly.
The girl at the checkout looked up from her magazine.
“Honestly, Watson, you’re much to old to be to be entertaining yourself with such drivel day after day.” Sherlock says entering the sitting room, fresh from the shower, buttoning his cuffs.
“What?” Sherlock almost stammers and swallows trying to make a neutral face.
“Daddy, can we get hot cocoa?”
John shoulders between Sherlock’s legs, spreading them a bit more. Sherlock looks down at him as he puts a hand on the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, sliding up and then back down towards his knee.
John leaves kisses along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh as he watches his finger disappear into Sherlock. “Mmmm... your so loose and slick.” John’s free hand moves down to palm himself through this jeans, before undoing his button and zip and pulling himself out.
Sherlock is standing near the table lifting his bare foot, melty marshmallow goo stringing from his foot to the floor. Rosie sits covering her ears from the loud scream of the smoke alarm, still with a huge grin on her sticky face. The Bunsen Burner is still lit on the table, with its flame on full blast.
“I thought you might like to make a handprint ornament with Rosie. The shop attendant assured me that it was a tradition that many people do on their child’s first Christmas. Though, I’m not sure why.” Sherlock says knitting his brows. John chuckles and starts opening the box to the kit.
“Good, Gran. Dad and Sherlock are taking me ice skating tonight.” She says taking a bite of apple.
“I’m afraid so, Watson. Your father said it’s getting late.” Sherlock starts unlacing his skates.
Sherlock is lifted off the deck and to his feet. The man holding him starts to drag him towards the railing. “How’s about another dip in the Atlantic, Dirty Jerry?” The man shakes him. “Oi! What you got to say for yourself. Jerry, before we throw you back in?”
"That'll be £59.99."
“This man is mad!” says another.
“No!” Rosie says loudly. “No! ‘ock, No!”
Rosie spends the rest of her week, working in her coloring books. She successfully finishes the portrait of Sherlock in the Christmas jumper and hangs it on the fridge. (John sees it after work one day and gives her high praise. She beams, Sherlock blushes.) She gets four more pages of her human body book done, one page, the circulatory system, took her all day Thursday and part of Friday morning to finish. She used John’s text book again to get the flow in and out colored correctly. All the while, watching movie after movie.
An officer steps into the room, wringing his hands in his hat. “Sir, the Germans, sir. They’ve taken control of the bridge. Steering a course for their homeland.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock looks at him a little confused as he hands him a damp rag to wipe up Rosie’s hands and face.
“Alright, my dear Watson, off to bed.” Sherlock says patting her back.
"No. I'll be fine." Sherlock said.
“Mycroft? Where are they taking me? Brother Mine, help me!”
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson thought I ought to. She was being... helpful.” He corrected himself before saying something not good. The corner of John’s mouth turns up. “I know you said you didn’t want to celebrate this year but I thought... for Rosie.” Sherlock stumbles over his words a bit. “Are you angry?”
Sherlock sits quietly while John rips the wrappings off. He opens the little box to find a glass antique doctor’s bag ornament.
“You’re such big men now, but just wait until you get to Russia. I hope you gentleman like the cold.” Sherlock spouts off. One of the soldiers knocks him behind the head, knocking him out. They drag him down the hall, through the ship and out onto the rainy deck again. Sherlock comes around as they start hoisting him up the stairs to the bridge. He struggles with them a bit but they manage to get him up the stairs and through the door.
“My name’s Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock clears his throat a bit. “Maybe some of those shortbread biscuits for Rosie? And the chocolate ones that John likes.”
John turns to Sherlock and points a finger, the corner of his mouth turning up. “See. I told you. Bad habit.” Sherlock throws up his arms, his mouth dropping open in mock innocence. (Rosie counts that as smile number Twenty Three.)
“Yeah!”
Sherlock doesn’t answer and John lets out an exasperated sigh.
Sherlock looks down at his hands. “You should take her home then. So she can rest.”
“Fuck.. thats beautiful, Sherlock. Bring yourself off for me. Show me how much you want it.” John pants, looking up
Moriarty speaks with one of the soldiers before addressing Sherlock directly, but in German.
Sherlock squirms and pants. “Please, John.. I want you inside me..”
Rosie runs in and Angelo greets her at the podium with a big hug, lifting her off her feet. “Hello Rosie, my love. How are you today?”
John gives him a soft smile. “Thank you, Sherlock. Baker Street will always be my home.”
Rosie stands smiling smugly at them. “I think you’re going to have to hold his hand, Daddy. So he doesn’t fall.”
Sherlock moves abruptly, reaching for a  black rectangular box from under his chair. He holds it out across to John. John sets down his cup, taking the box.
On the landing stands Craig, the hacker that lent Sherlock his dog for the Six Thatchers Case. John had only recently gotten around to typing that one up.
“I took the wrapping paper from her because she was trying to eat it.”
Sherlock sighs but then starts in on the beginning of Jingle Bells again. John turns Rosie to face him, standing her on his knees. He starts to sing along with Sherlock’s playing, bouncing her a bit.
“Not a case, but an experiment. I’ve been collecting data but the results aren’t... they’re not enough to prove...”
"Awww, alright, mate. You don't gotta add the sob story." The cabbie gets out and together they manage to get the tree strapped to the top of the cab with the twine provided for free in front of the garden centre.
He pulls out a small rubbery Giraffe (“That looks unsanitary.”), a set of pink and purple plastic teething keys (“Stereotypical.”), her plush rattle (“We will not be playing THAT game today, Watson.”), and finally the plush bumblebee that he bought for her at the toy shop. Rosie claps and gurgles when he pulls it out of the bag. He smiles as he hands it to her.
Sherlock walks with Rosie back into the sitting room and sets her in John’s armchair. He gets his violin out of its case and starts to play Jingle Bells for her, humming along as he rocks in front of her. Rosie gurgles happily as she watches him, sucking on her biscuit. Just as he reaches the end of the song, John lumbers up the stairs with Rosie’s high chair, going through the kitchen door to set it up next to the table.
Sherlock smiles a bit and is about to say something in return when the alarm on John’s watch goes off.
John alternates between soft kitten licks and light pressure, loosening Sherlock slowly, the way he knows he likes it. Finally, his tongue slides in and he wiggles it a bit, looking up at Sherlock. Sherlock’s eyelids flutter, his head listing back and his mouth open, panting quietly. Too quiet.
Craig hand him the paper he had been holding. “From the Defense Intelligence Fusion Centre’s IMINT mid-latitude imaging radar satellite.”
“Oh, is that where you ordered from?” John says a bit distantly, rubbing the back of his neck. “Do you still like the Green Curry?”
“I’d better go help him.” John rolls his eyes a bit.
“John! Did you put the batteries back into the smoke detector?!” Sherlock bellows at him.
"I'd like this one." Sherlock announced.
John sits back turning the box to read the text on the lid. The gold letters read “Edible Anus: Fine Belgian Chocolates”
“It’s not a party.” Sherlock mumbles.
Shutting off the shower, John opens the shower curtain and grabs a towel, starting to dry himself off.
John clears his throat before shutting the door. “Are you sure you don’t want to sit in the middle, Rosie.”
“Me? On top of you?” Sherlock squirms next to him. “You got in last.”
“Fafast.. Mallow. Hot!” Rosie agrees with a squeal.
Sherlock spent the rest of the night perched on his chair deducing and collecting all of the possible ways John would react when he and Rosie arrived tomorrow evening.
John looks at Rosie. “Sherlock’s right, you know. You can’t eat the wrappings from the presents.” Rosie huffs out through her nose.
Rosie squeals and claps her hands. “Loud!”
John nearly falls over in his haste to leap out of the tub and wrap the towel around his waist. He wrenches open the bathroom door and darts across into the kitchen.
"I've purchased a tree. We'll need to strap it to the roof." Sherlock tells the driver.
“No!” Rosie says quickly. “I want to go to Angelo’s. We can walk can’t we?”
Plans tomorrow afternoon? -SH
“I’d like to present my data first, if that’s alright.” Rosie says timidly. Sherlock nods.
Mrs. Hudson came up a few hours later around 12:30 with the three batches of cookies on a large plate. She sets it on the kitchen table, pushing some remnants of an experiment out of the way. She makes a tsking sound and turns to Sherlock who was tuning his violin in front of the window.
“You thought Sherlock was so clever, didn’t you, Daddy?” Rosie smiles between them.
“Alright now we can press her hand into the mold.” John says, reading the instructions again. Sherlock goes to hand Rosie to him. “Why don’t you hold her, then I can press her hand down.” John says. Sherlock gives him a blank look. “Just turn her around and hold her around the middle.” John says with a smile.
“Daddy, Papa, Bee see ducks?”
“It’s your party. What now?” John wipes up Rosie and let’s her down from her chair. She toddles out into the sitting room.
“I’ve got an ID. In my pocket.”
“Who dear?”
“He did. And then we chased him half way across London.” John grins at Sherlock who rolls his eyes.
He pops a piece of gum into his mouth as he approaches Sherlock and the soldiers holding him.
“It was only a few blocks. And I only did that to show you that your limp was psychosomatic.” Sherlock waves his hand. John blushes and takes a sip of his water to cover it.
John leans back into Sherlock, turning his head back to look at him.  “Mmmm.. you smell good. New shampoo?”
Sherlock looks almost grateful as he closes his fist around his leaking cock, his eyes rolling back.
Rosie squeals. “Hot!!”
Sherlock appears at the end of the sofa, his violin under his chin. He starts playing the piece he had been working on for Rosie. John smiles softly up at him and then back down at Rosie, who was rubbing her face, fighting sleep. John gives her a kiss on the forehead before getting up to start a fire.
John redoubles his efforts, pulling his tongue out and resuming the teasing licks and light pressure, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s arse cheeks. Soon Sherlock was a writhing, sweaty mess.
Rosie was squirming so John sets her down and she toddles back to the table, grabbing the wrappings from the presets and shakes them about. John smiles as he watches her and then looks back at Sherlock, who’s was watching him.
John watches him as he taps a spoonful of rice on to Rosie’s tray and she grabs a handful stuffing it into her mouth. He spoons some of his Garlic Chicken onto his own rice as he watches Sherlock shovel food into his mouth with more gusto than he’d seen in years.
“Wow? You’ve cleaned up in here too? It really must be Christmas.” John says from the door way.
The sailor leans towards the captain. “We found him in the water, sir. Don’t know nothing about him. I think he’s a German.”
“Whadda ya say Rosie? Should we hang our ornaments on the tree?” John asks, bouncing Rosie on his knee a bit. He takes Rosie’s ornament out of its box and stands with her moving over to the tree.
“Mmm. Yes, please.” came Rosie’s reply.
“How can I say no to such a beautiful Little Bee?”
The taxi stopped in front of Camden Garden Centre and Sherlock paid the cabbie and got out. He entered the garden shop, which had been one of the top results when he had searched online for "where to buy a Christmas tree in London".  He approached the young girl at the checkout.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson!” Sherlock calls after her. He manages to get the tree and all of his purchases up the seventeen steps to the flat.
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea. “Mmm. It always tastes better when you make it.” He says. John blushes a bit.
He moves down the hall and ducks through another door way finding himself in a ballroom with a party going on. A live band is playing and couples are dancing, all dressed in 1930’s style clothing. Sherlock weaves through the dancefloor, taking everything in. He looks up at the singer on stage. Her make up is different and her hair up, but it’s Anthea, Mycroft’s PA belting out ‘Jeepers Creepers’.
Rosie goes back to coloring the thin lines of the nerves of the legs. Faintly, from the kitchen she hears...
Maybe they never dated.... because they were in love with eachother! Her nine year old romantic brain whirred with all the possibilities. Her cheeks pinkened and she tried to look interested in her coloring again. How could she find out? What did Sherlock always do if he wanted an answer to a question? Perform an experiment. John and Sherlock enter the sitting room.
The quick movement rouses Sherlock a bit. “Wha.. John?” He looks confused for a moment until he sees John’s quickly moving hand. Sherlock shifts, letting his shirt fall open more. “Oh... yes, John. Cum for me.” His hands move around John’s waist, pushing under his jeans to cup his arse.
Sherlock nods, closing his mouth. They approach a door, labeled “Captain” and one sailor knocks. The door opens and the captain stands on the other side. He eyes Sherlock. “Aye? What’s this about then?”
“Of course it changes things! It changes everything!” Rosie beams. “You’re in love! Now we can be a proper family! We’ve always been a family but now it’s real.” She turns and gives John a big hug. When John releases her, she scoots off his lap and climbs into Sherlock’s lap to give him a hug as well.
Rosie went upstairs to her room and grabbed her slippers, knowing Gran would scold her for coming down with bare feet. She slipped them on and then bounded down the steps to Mrs. Hudson’s door. It was cracked and she pushed it open.
“There she is! Are you ready to head home, Rosie Love?” John asks.
Rosie takes a deep breath, gets the chair from the desk and sets it facing the fireplace, between their chairs. She takes her tea from John’s side table and sits. John chuckles but Sherlock looks at her seriously.
“No..” John sits forward in his chair a little, shaking his head. “...no, they’re wonderful. It’s absolutely filthy and mad. But wonderful.” John bites his lip, smiling.
“I had to steal this uniform, John, please…” Sherlock reaches after him, but there is a commotion at the back of the room and the Anthea look-a-like on stage stops her song to point at him and yells in German. There’s a gunshot and the dancing couples duck and scramble from the dance floor.
“Right.” Craig answers, catching his breath.
Sherlock twists his mouth. A muffled cry comes from the sitting room. They enter to find Rosie sitting on the throw blanket, rubbing her eyes.
“Go on then. Quickly. Two more before your Father comes back.”
Rosie slips off Sherlock’s lap to give John a kiss on the cheek. “Love you, Daddy.”
“Craig, umm Sherlock’s not here.”
“It’s amazing how alike you two are sometimes.” Sherlock drawls.
Sherlock complies almost instantly, scooting so that his bottom rests on the edge of the chair, and reclining back. John  scoots forward also, pressing kisses to the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, working his way up to where his balls where nestled between his legs. He noses past them, running his tongue along the crease of his groin.
Sherlock turns to move away from John, his feet immediately slipping out from under him, his legs splaying like a baby giraffe learning to walk. John reaches out to catch him and Sherlock collapses into his arms.
While John and Rosie hang her ornament on the tree, Sherlock quickly rips into the third wrapped box. John hears the ripping and looks over as Sherlock takes the last ornament out of its box.
“So we can go?!”
“I’m not.” Rosie counters looking back at Sherlock sternly. John had seen many of these battles at home to know better than to let them go on. It just caused a several hour long strop from the both of them.
“For me, please?” John says a bit quieter.
The uniformed man steps up to the radio and leans on it to switch it off. Sherlock emerges from the corner quickly, trying to knock him out against the radio. This changes the radio broadcast to an upbeat Andrews Sisters song.
“I’ll just make us some tea.” John heads into the kitchen smiling to himself.
“I’m not a child, Watson. I don’t need to be lead around...” were their simultaneous replies.
John sits in his chair, twirling his phone and bouncing his knee. Rosie sat on the floor, playing with blocks and clutching her stuffed bee. John gives her a soft smile before, unlocking his phone and looking for messages that weren’t there.
John’s tea cup clatters and he sputters choking on his tea. “Rosie...” John starts a bit frantic.
“You.” Sherlock looks down at him.
“That’s quite enough of that, don’t you think?” He continues. “I’ve been looking for this ship.”
“That’s wonderful, Sherlock.” She runs her hands over the needles of the tree. “It’s lovely, Sherlock. Nice and full. John will love it.”
“Alright, Little Bee, keep your hands back. We’ll never hear the end of it from your father if you burn your hand.” Sherlock pushes a marshmallow onto the tines of a fork and turns on the gas burner.
“Oi!” The sailor holding him turns him roughly, fisting his coat. “How’s about you shove a cork in it, mate? All right?”
Rosie can barely contain a squeal as she watches them. A few other skaters pass them distracting John. He clears his throat helping Sherlock to stand again.
“You are.” Sherlock stares at her harder.
Sherlock looks up at him. “John, you shouldn’t worry about me. You have Rosie to care for now.”
A Nazi soldier approaches Sherlock, pointing a gun at him and yelling in German. John stands off to the side still. “He says put your hands up.” He offers helpfully. Sherlock puts up his hands and two soldiers grab him pinning his arms.
“He went to Bermuda and chartered a powerboat out of Hamilton Harbor. I tracked him on the satellite for an hour and a half until a storm blew in and obscured all transmissions. That’s what you’re looking at.”
“No, John. It’s me, Sherlock.”
John straps her into her high chair and gives her another shortbread biscuit to entertain her while they wait for the food to arrive. Sherlock enters the kitchen carrying Rosie’s sippy, just as the door buzzed.
John looks down at the paper, which is just a printout of what looks to be a blank radar screen. “I don’t understand. What am I looking at?”
“The other presents?” John asks, sitting back on the sofa. Sherlock retrieves the three gifts from under the tree. “Sherlock, we didn’t get you anything.”
Sherlock is slowly pulled into consciousness by a pressure under his arm pits. Rain spits at his face as he’s lifted out of the water. He hears yelling somewhere above him.
Sherlock can’t help but roll his hips. “God... John...”
Sherlock tries to lift his head to answer but not before he takes a heavy boot to his ribs. He grunts and rolls to his side, still coughing up water.
She steps up to him so he can kiss Rosie goodbye. “Be good for, Nana, Rosiegirl. Daddy will be back soon.”
“Aye, that’s a damn good question, lad. I’m waiting for a damn good answer.” The captain sets his jaw.
“Dashing through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh, o’re the fields we go, laughing all the way, HAHAHAHA.” John bounces her higher on that part and she squeals.
“Alright, Watson. What did your Father pack for you today?” He starts digging around in the bag shoving aside spare outfits and fresh nappies.
“Fine. Rosie sat in front of the television watching romantic drivel. I managed to work a bit on my article on the Benefits of Beekeeping in the city.” Sherlock explains.
"THANK YOU, Mrs. Hudson." Sherlock says a little forcefully. "But John stated that he did not want to celebrate Christmas. I do not wish to cause him more anguish with Mary being gone."
“Marshmallows? Sherlock, it’s nine thirty in the morning.”
“No... it wasn’t.. we weren’t...” John feels himself blushing a bit for some reason. Sherlock rescues him.
“He only just got tired of waiting for you. He’s making us tea.” Rosie explains.
“No. I want the three of us to go. It’ll be fun.” She states.
“And shortbread for Rosie.” They say in unison. Sherlock grins and John chuckles, looking away. The kettle whistles and they both jump a bit. Sherlock starts to attempt to make the tea one handed with Rosie on his hip. John comes to stand next to him and takes the tea canister out of his hand.
He washes and then lets himself relax, sitting down and letting the water run over him. He must’ve fallen asleep because the water runs cold and he jolts awake. He shuts off the water quickly and gets out, shivering. He dresses quickly, putting on a dark green shirt and his best trousers, followed by his jacket.
“But you don’t.” John cuts in. “Sometimes you don’t sleep or eat for days. When was the last time you slept?”
“You’re welcome. Thank you for the chocolates.” John stands and looks down at him.
“How’s the blood flow of the heart coming?” He asks looking at the picture of the human heart.
Sherlock pays and she wraps up the pot to keep the dirt from spilling. He takes the cart out to the street and hails a cab. When the cab rolls up, Sherlock approaches the driver's window.
“Thank you!” Rosie gives Sherlock a peck on the cheek and heads back out into the ice. She does two quick laps and when she returns to the bench, John is back in his spot on the bench next to Sherlock.
“Daddy and Sherlock. Do you think they’re in love with eachother?”
John starts stroking himself quicker, sucking a mark into Sherlock’s skin. He lets his eyes wander over Sherlock’s throbbing and softening cock. His eyes follow a dribble of cum as it runs down the side. He feels the build up and just before it hits, he scrambles to his feet, leaning over Sherlock and bracing himself with one hand on the back of the chair.
John makes a bit of a slurping noise, swallowing before licking over Sherlock again. His tongue swirls around, licking up most of the chocolate, before he pulls back and looks up at Sherlock, taking another bite out of the chocolate.
"If you hadn't noticed, John does not live here anymore. He also expressed to me that he did not wish celebrate this year." Sherlock replied coolly.
“Into the Bermuda Triangle.” Craig pauses and John just stares at him. “And reappeared this morning at 6:49am GMT.” Craig finishes.
Sherlock played for hours and his tea sat, growing ice cold. He thought about what Mrs. Hudson had said. Soon Rosie's piece morphed in God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman,  then Silent Night, and then Jingle Bells. He put his violin away in its case and went to his laptop.
Air raid sirens can be heard behind the radio announcer.
“As am I, John.”
“Eager to have me taking over all your space, are you?”
Mrs. Hudson grins. “Oh yes! And the raspberry ones too!” I’ll make a whole batch up for you! You love the raspberry ones.” She heads off towards her kitchen to get started.
"What? Oh no way! You can have them deliver it ya know." The cabbie says.
The last was a dark green Fraser fir that was potted and not cut. It was about as tall as John and had fuller top branches than the others. It's sign read "Needle Retention: Excellent".
“Good? Isn’t it, Little Bee?” Sherlock gets another marshmallow out of the bag, putting it on the fork. This time he holds it closer to the flame and it catches fire. He pulls it up and watches it burn a moment before giving it a good strong blow to put it out.
After some internal debate, Sherlock decided that the Fraser Fir would be appropriate for Rosie. Small, full, excellent needle retention and potted so then Mrs. Hudson could keep it year round if she wished. He found a push trolley and carefully placed the tree on it and pushed it to the front.
Rosie let’s out and excited squeal, wiggling on the tabletop. “Mallow!!” She giggles.
“It’s not a party.” He answers stealing one of the raspberry thumbprint biscuits off the plate. “And, no Mrs. Hudson. Thank you, for the biscuits.” He leans down to give her a peck on the cheek. “Merry Christmas.”
Both Sherlock and John snap their heads towards Rosie.
Mrs. Hudson looks up at him. “You bring him home again, John.”
Sherlock backs up and sits back down in his chair. John retrieves the box from his own chair and kneels down in front of Sherlock. Sherlock’s feet are still caught up in his trousers, so John untangles his legs, one foot at a time. The trousers get tossed aside, the belt clattering on the wood floor in front of the fireplace.
*                  *                  *
Sherlock bites his lip. “I hope so.” He let’s slip.
“Mmm. Did you two decide on dinner?” John asks.
Rosie watches with excited giggles and Sherlock holds the marshmallow over the flame. The closest side browns, and Sherlock pulls it back, touching it gingerly with his free hand and blowing on it.
“But I want to hear it again.” Rosie pouts a bit.
“My name’s not Jerry.” Sherlock finally answers, a bit weakly.
Something had been changing between them for a while. Something unspoken, something inevitable had been on the brink of happening for weeks. Months, even. Perhaps years.
His John.
"No longer a concern," says Sherlock and John can see the shadows of Russia, Serbia, India and Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara?) in his face as he says it. And suddenly he aches from the loss of innocence in his friend.
"And this little philosophy of yours isn’t something you think I should "find out for myself?" when I, supposedly, embark on a sexual relationship with your husband?"
"I told you. John and I don’t need any help."
"I... I think he does." She hesitates. "On some level."
John thought it was perfectly obvious why he needed a little extra dose of holiday cheer this year.
John could hardly wait – although he was personally rooting for the stripper-idea.
He waited.
It's absurd, how that can make him blush there in the dark. This stupid, mundane, domestic idea of grabbing John's hand. In public. Or at home. Without either himself or John taking any notice of it, because it's such a common, unremarkable event.
And Sherlock’s face was moving in interesting ways as he pondered the question.
He found his flatmate where he was busy writing case notes on John’s fresh stack of blank Christmas cards.
"We need to talk about sex."
"Yeah, okay, I know more about you than the fact that you look good in a deerstalker, but..."
And it is brilliant – but it is also sad. Because now it’s over, this single, shining moment that Sherlock was given. And they need to focus again – on the subject of John’s wife.
Home-made naans? Who even did that?
But he can't really feel much interest beyond that.
Did Sherlock notice John's proximity and feel really, really uncomfortable? Or was it, perhaps, the other way around? Was Sherlock disgusted and disturbed or was he...
"Why on earth do you need to tell them anything at all about us?"
Oh, god, I'm always promising to finish this in the next chapter, and then I keep rambling on. Sorry! But yet again, I'll now promise that the smut (and the end) will be in next weekend's update.
Isn’t it pathetic, Sherlock thinks to himself, that this clumsy, emotionally murky incident is the best thing that has happened to him?
John is used to it, after all.
Like their kiss, inside that glacial cave in the middle of nowhere.
"Oh, God."
His voice sounded hoarse and distant. He could feel Sherlock nodding against his skin and yet they didn’t move. John’s hands kept trailing up and down Sherlock’s back, wandering up into his hair and then hesitating over the waistband of his trousers before moving back up.
He ignores it.
(He explained this to the receptionists. Told them to try to put everything that required a personal touch somewhere else. They knew and loved Mary and pitied him. He gets all the warts he wants.)
Besides, if she asked John he'd tell her that Sherlock had never once been considerate towards him in all their years together.
Sherlock doesn't stop playing.
"We need to move," he says one evening as they're going to bed.
“The barbarians!” Sherlock’s eyes were wild and imploring. John squinted, uncomprehending.
John shrugged it off as he winced in sympathy as Donovan struggled past them, looking vaguely green and heading for the loos.
"John probably thinks you are, you know."
“She’s hardly my ex.”
“Can I…?”
John moves up the bed, to slump next to Sherlock and they look at each other - John still covered in come, Sherlock red-faced and flustered. And then they break out in giggles - like they have so many times before, but never like this. And this shared moment of joy, more than anything, convinces John that this will be okay. This will be more than okay, this will take their previous friendship and amplify it. It will strengthen their bond and it will - well - it will most certainly provide John with the best sex of his lifetime.
They walked up 221B in silence and didn’t talk about it. John made a point of not being in around dinner, so the idea of sharing a meal wouldn’t come up. He sat alone in a dingy pub and munched on soggy chips and felt sorry for himself.
John is a bit dismayed that all he needs to move house is a black cab. People his age should require moving vans. But he doesn't. Never has, really. So half an hour later he locks the door of his and Mary's house behind them.
He heaved on Sherlock’s arm and managed to raise him to an upright position. This close he could see every line in Sherlock’s dejected frown and John felt the tug of real worry. Sherlock had a flair for drama – especially when it came to his brother – but most of it was bluster. He didn’t usually look this… defeated.
Gay porn!
"What are you thinking about?"
And that's how they end up squeezed together in the wannabe Mafia's wardrobe. While ritualistic killers hold what sounds like a routine staff meeting.
And he's off. Describing digital tracking, mad chases, endless deductions and a fiery showdown, where Janine (Janine!) was apprehended, operating the whole thing from her cottage in Sussex Downs.
“Mmhm,” Sherlock said against his lips, grinding his hips against John's in a way that made it obvious that the bed would come in handy sooner than later. “But I wasn’t really that fussed about
Maybe this is as close as Sherlock can come to asking?
She was supposed to uphold the values represented in The Guardian, to believe in the power of meditation and women’s rights and to march against nuclear weapons. That was the sort of person she was supposed to be. And that sort of people – that sort of people didn’t support pornography in any way, shape or form.
Reginald, the otter, made a disgusting sound in the corner. One of the herring John had put in there with him had presumably been decapitated.
Sherlock doesn't move.
“Sherlock, I’ll make this right. I… I promise. I’ll sort myself out. And I’ll come back to you. Once everything’s been cleared up. Okay?”
“Let me make this perfectly clear,” John growled. “We made a deal. About you either complying and getting a reward, or getting punished for not playing along. Now, you can back down anytime you like. You can tell me that we aren’t playing right now. You can sit down at the goddamn table with me and pretend to eat a cookie. But if you outright refuse, there will be consequences.”
John slowly bangs his head against a nearby wall.
Sherlock was looking at John over the rim of his book and John realised that he’d just chuckled out loud.
They were sitting in their chairs, like so many times before, when Sherlock spoke. John was deeply immersed in his novel and hadn’t been thinking about phones, women or sex so he needed a moment to make sense of the sentence.
Only, in this case they could poke as much as they liked and would find everything as perfectly legal and proper as anyone might wish. It was of no matter to them if John and Sherlock were the type of couple that didn't hold hands.
This is his first time on a plane since his aborted exile. He finds that he doesn’t like it.
“No, but you're still human,” John said, “as much as you like to pretend that you're not. Humans work in a pretty simple way. When we do something and the result is pleasant, we'll likely do it again. So I'll give you a reward for helping me make our home nice and pleasant during December, and you'll get something you'll like in return. In addition to all the niceness the experiment will create in and of itself. Therefore - you'll probably be more willing to do this again next Christmas. It's a win-win situation.”
“Okay, Scrooge. We need to talk.”
He reads the news sites, takes a shower, nibbles on whatever he finds in the kitchen. And then, in the silence, he comes to a decision.
When John wakes up again, he is alone.
"What?" Sherlock scribbled down a no-doubt-thrilling apiary fact.
voice. “Because then it didn't matter. Because I thought it was over before we even reached British soil."
"Might as well," sighs John.
. Sort of. He wouldn't go as far as to say that he doesn't know and doesn't
Sherlock didn’t reply.
“Yup. And remember. A nice reward for you if you do good. A nice reward in ADDITION to all the lovely holiday cheer my list will bring both of us.”
? After everything?
"Well, the pickings in my inbox were slim. And we needed one last case." Sherlock is rifling through some papers on a side table, occasionally snapping photographs with his phone. They’re in a creepy old warehouse, and this appears to be a staff-room of sorts. Other parts of the building house weapons, stolen goods and some forgeries. John is actually rather impressed with the ambition of these criminals – they’re not afraid to branch out, apparently.
