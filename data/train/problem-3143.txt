“Right,” Sam agreed, reaching up to curl some of Jessica's messy hair behind her ear, “Papa will be back before you know it, Jess.”
Jude almost tackled both of his parents with a giant hug, yanking them close with both of his arms, before turning to dash for the vehicle across the parking lot. He couldn't wait to see the car up close.
“But I swear, from this moment on, I will do everything in my power to make you feel the same amount of love and happiness that you make me feel,” Clare vowed, “When you're sad, I'll cheer you up. When you're worried, I'll calm you down. When you're scared, I'll protect you. If someone pisses you off, I'll kick their ass. No questions asked,” Clare grinned, which gained a few more chuckles from their family, “I swear that I'm gonna love you, and only you, for the rest of my life, Jude. There's literally no one else on this Earth that I would rather be with than you. Whatever you need from me, you've got it. My heart, my soul, my mind, my present
“Whoa! That thing is uglier than a shaved donkey,” he muttered.
“Ah! Feel that summertime breeze? It smells like fun and adventure,” uncle Gabe hummed, smiling real big as he looked around the park.
“I love you too, Gracie,” he replied.
Uncle Gabe winked at Jessie and she snuggled her white bunny under her chin.
Jude took a moment to think while he chewed a particularly large bite of his food. Castiel couldn't help but be reminded of Dean when witnessing their child eat. Jude and Dean had the same mouth and jawline, and appeared almost identical when chewing.
“Jude,” Dean began in a warm, low voice, “Daddy... Daddy is very sorry about what happened in the gas station.”
“Ah! There's my wiener now,” Papa proudly announced.
. That felt so
“I know –”
Dean gasped out loud and attempted to get up but ended up falling back over because his ankles were still tied together. Cas saw what happened too, and flew over to vaporize both demons on the spot, causing the area to fill briefly with light. Dean shielded his eyes and turned away, unable to stand the brightness. After the shine dimmed and it got quiet, Dean raised his head to search for Cas.
Castiel blinked strangely at the man's words. Good job? What was Dean praising him for?
“Okay,” Dean said, “So, what’s so wrong about a new species being made?”
After his solemn words, Ollie turned around and started walking away without even saying goodbye. He had left the keys for his mom to take his car. And even though all the adults were shouting for him to stop and come back, no one went after him... No one except Jessica.
“Jude!” Daddy gasped, sounding so worried.
“Thank you,” Ollie mumbled, unsure of what else to say.
“Yep. Go and get your coat, son,” Dean replied.
Cas lowered his head, making his blue eyes look misty and full of authority.
Jude felt his own heart drop with disappointment, but he tried to look on the bright side. At least they knew the general area that Michael was in. That was better than nothing, right?
Jude eventually caught sight of a shadow moving closer and he raised his head to see who was there. But when he looked up and saw Dean, Jude's blue eyes widened with distress. The kid immediately started to wiggle out of Cas's arms, pushing against the angel's hold to slide out of his coat. When Jude's boots hit the floor, he hugged his stuffed bee and quickly walked away, going over to sit at the table in front of Jessica. Warm tears pooled in Dean's eyes, blurring his sight and making a large lump form in his throat. There were a lot of times in Dean's life when he felt like a monster. But this? Seeing his own son flee from him in terror? This definitely took the cake...
“Especially when you’re in drag,” Sam hummed.
Meg gave Rowena a flat look as she shoved the bottle back into her pocket.
“It sounds like the book ended up at the Philadelphia History Museum,” he informed.
“Hey. Watch your mouth when you’re talking about my seraph. He can still smite your ass,” Dean warned playfully.
The brief silence that followed Jude’s statement seemed to finally get Jess’s attention. She carefully rolled over to look at Jude, and Jude could see just how much she’d been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy, her nose was pink, and her cheeks were lined with wet streaks. The sight made Jude’s heart ache.
It wasn't long before hot wet streaks were flinging across Jude's heaving stomach and chest. Specks of white come speckled some of Clare's body too, but Clare didn't seem to mind. He was too busy kissing Jude's neck and holding onto him tightly. Jude lingered in his orgasm for as long as he could before he started to flinch with sensitivity. He had to force himself to let go of his own dick so that he could fully embrace his fiance.
“My apologies, Dean. I wasn't aware of -”
Dean's face fell a bit after hearing the angel's request. It seemed as though he wasn't expecting Castiel to have such a specific list of items. But before either of them had time to amend their words, the sound of a snap echoed from the hallway – and everything Castiel requested suddenly appeared on the table beside them. The angel looked down at the steaming plate of food in wonder before glancing toward the sound of the snap. Gabriel was leaning into the kitchen from the hall, wearing a joyous grin.
“I think you'll wanna hear this,” Bobby persuaded.
“Gabe?” Bobby repeated, his face skewing in confusion, “Why get him when Cas is standin' right here?”
She nodded to answer, seeming too shy to say anything. Jude totally understood how she felt. Being in a room full of people could be a little overwhelming, especially when you’re so small. The crowded bunker study only made Grace more bashful. She hunkered down on Jude’s shoulder as some of the family walked in to meet the other half. Bobby and Crowley, with drinks in hand, had been talking to Michael and Adam near a bookshelf. Jane and Rowena – both wearing matching red dresses – were arranging cake and presents on the table in the center of the room. But Michael and Adam’s daughter, Katherine – four-years-old, just like Charlie – was the first to notice the new arrivals. The little girl flew from one part of the bunker to the other, flying over to greet Jude first.
Uncle Bobby and uncle Sam were trying their best to wrangle Crowley as he rolled around. They were shouting over his groans, asking him to hold still and calm down, but it wasn't helping. To add more confusion to the chaos, Bobby's three hellhound dogs were whimpering and barking, bewildered and frightened by the commotion. In the meantime, uncle Gabe and Jessie were trying to clean Crowley's wound; dodging his flailing arms in order to pat the area with warm water. Jude thought that was strange. Why weren't they healing him with their grace? They could take care of it in no time flat! Why were they just washing it off?
Having heard Jude's voice like a prayer, Papa instantly flew into the kitchen. He appeared by the metal island in the middle of the room – and the moment Jude looked at him, he could tell that Papa was extremely unnerved. His eyes were large, he was spinning around urgently, and when he spotted the two boys, he dashed over to grab their shoulders.
“Maybe the cereal gave her an upset stomach or something,” uncle Sammy said.
“Gabe just sent me a weird text message...” he answered.
“Papa brought me in here to keep you company,” she mumbled.
“Hey, Jessie,” he whispered, “Did you have a bad dream?”
“And if you ever need anything, all you have to do is pray and Papa will come back. Okay?” Gabe asked, looking down into her eyes.
“Can I help you, fellas?” he asked, voice weak.
"Dickie," Sam shouted, his voice echoing down the bunker corridors, "Here, boy."
“You sure you're alright, buddy?” Dad asked suspiciously, like he was trying to cover up some insecurity, “It sounded like Darkness was some pretty rough stuff. Do you need to talk about anything? Need some pie?”
the way through...
A smile slowly spread across Sam's mouth as he stared down into Gabriel's gorgeous eyes. He was so grateful that Gabe didn't have any hard feelings toward him. It seemed like Gabriel had missed him just as much as he missed Gabriel. With another deep breath, Sam finally lowered his head to bring their lips together. This kiss was softer than usual; less sexual and more emotional. Sam pulled away after only a few seconds so that he could touch the rim of Gabe's sweet mouth with his thumb.
After they finally let go of each others' hands, Clarence came to Jude's Dad next. The sight of Clarence stepping so close to the end made Jude's panic spike again. Oh, no! Clare was so close to saying goodbye! So close to
"Hey, little man," he smiled, drying his hands on a dish towel, "Wanna do me a favor?"
Jessica's frown slowly faded away and she blinked up at Gabriel in wonder.
Hoping to entice Ollie to keep going, Jessica lifted his shirt farther up; exposing more of his torso so that she could rub it all with her hands. His skin was so warm and smelled so good. She couldn't wait to see the rest of him in person – but Ollie carefully tugged his mouth away from hers. He panted a little in the dark, but kept his hands glued to her back.
“Sweet. We'll pile in the Impala and go,” Dean agreed, “What do you say, lil' man? Sound like a plan?”
Instead of answering the question, Sam walked over to show Dean the phone. It was a text – from Bobby's cell phone number, of course – but the entire message only consisted of three letters:
that you
“Cas,” Dean repeated in an urgent whisper, finally gaining the angel's attention, “Shh, baby, you've gotta stop screaming.”
Jess wrapped both arms around Rowena's slim waist and sighed happily. There was always something so wonderful about having another girl around. Across the island, Clarence shook his head with a scowl.
“Gabe, we need to get out of here before someone sees us,” Sam said urgently.
,” they finished with clapping.
“Good morning, you guys,” Jessie smiled as she walked in to sit at the table next to Jude.
“Y – yeah,” Jude carefully answered, unsure if he should address the fact that he could see more than just hellhounds with his new glasses, “I, um... I like them a lot.”
“We aren’t,” Cas replied, making Meg briefly look at him in confusion. “I intend to interrogate this one. Gain as much information as possible.”
Before another word could be said, a waitress appeared at the table. She was carrying a plateful of steaming flapjacks and a bottle of syrup. Dean blinked himself out of the staring contest with the trickster to glance up at her.
With the smell of Cas's scent potent in Dean's nose, the man closed the distance between their mouths, forcing their lips to touch and tongues to slather. Dean savored the kiss, knowing he was going to have to watch the angel disappear soon. The taste of Cas's mouth was already sending jolts toward Dean's crotch. It still amazed Dean, how just a single kiss from Cas could get a boner started in his pants every damn time. Did Cas have magic 'erection' powers that he didn't know about or something? Shit, Dean could practically feel the veins in his dick filling up. The man forced himself to pull back before he turned any harder.
' sound it made as Dean dug around to pull out its bones caused Gabriel to gag.
“Wh – where did you get that?” the king asked.
Dean grinned and chuckled a bit, beaming as he turned in a slow circle to take it all in. Perhaps this was like stepping into a memory for him; like going back to a time before he became a father. That notion seemed so bizarre, now. After being Jude's parent for so long, Castiel couldn't imagine what it was like to
“Yeah. That about sums it up,” Bobby nodded.
Dean's mouth actually fell open a little. Lucifer knew Jessica by name? But how? Shit, did he know about Jude too? How the hell did Satan find out about the Winchesters' kids? Was he able to pick up angel radio in the cage or something? And what happened to Michael and Adam? Why was Lucifer alone? What the hell?
“Try his fake FBI number,” Dean instructed as he pulled out his own phone, “I'll try his Coroner number.”
A tear slipped from the corner of Jess's eye. How could Papa be so proud of her when Jude's terrible situation was all her fault?
Dean nodded before leaning over to kiss the top of Jude's head – and Cas's parted lips.
“You said Dickie wasn't allowed in the car,” the archangel mentioned, raising a finger, “but you didn't say anything about his friends.”
Crowley gave his red-head mom a sideways glare, obviously offended by what she said, but Bobby was the next person to speak. He sat Dickie down on the floor – after which, the dog ran straight to Jessie's feet where he walked around her in worried circles – before pointing out another problem.
“No,” Dean instantly denied, “No, Bobby. I already told you. I don't want any magic cast on my kid.”
Crowley paused to bring his other hand up, revealing a metal flask in his hand. Bobby watched him place the flask on the table, feeling completely lost.
“Good for you, kid,” he muttered.
“Cas!” he cried, hoping that his husband was unharmed.
Dean tried his best to hold down a glare. Did Gabriel
“She just showed up and gave me her scythe. Said Lucifer tried to take it from her,” Gabe quickly explained.
For almost half an hour, Dean and Cas opened presents for their kid. Dean did most of the unwrapping while Cas stacked everything on top of the kitchen table. So far, their baby had received plenty of things he really needed. Bobby bought him a bassinet, seven boxes of diapers, and three cans of formula; the good kind of formula, not that organic crap. Sammy got him a high chair, a stroller, and a play pin; the portable kind, that could easily be broken down, stowed away, and moved. And Gabriel got the baby pacifiers and tons of baby clothes, plus a few of those funny onesies, including some that read '
! It's gonna be amazing!”
Though she really wanted to kiss him on the mouth, Jessica restrained herself and only kissed his cheek. She didn't want her parents to see it; especially not Dad, who was still on the fence about the whole 'sex' comment earlier. Ollie let go and winked afterward, a subtle way of saying that he was thinking the same thing, before giving her hand a squeeze and turning to join his mother. Ms. Jane held onto Ollie's jacket sleeve as she led the way into her store. Jessie watched them both go, realizing that it was soon just her, her parents, and their dog standing on the side walk.
“Indeed, you have,” Cas smiled, “There appears to be a few more at the top of the hill as well.”
The only thing Dean could really do now was wait. Cas – or, at least, the King-of-the-demons version of Cas – seemed like his only ally. From their first conversation alone, Dean knew that despite his harsh exterior, this Cas genuinely cared about Dean’s safety. Otherwise, the angel wouldn’t have healed him after stabbing him. But none of those demons were going to help, that was for damn sure. Every single one had it out for him, including Meg. Ugh, just thinking about Meg pissed Dean off all over again…
“Did someone move my toothbrush? I couldn’t find it,” he blurted.
Ollie's mom must have been feeling the same blandness that Jess did, because she didn't say much during the trip, which was pretty unusual. Jane was always a social butterfly in any situation, but maybe everything that happened had affected her, too. Was the Darkness too scary for her? Was Grandpa too intimidating? Were Michael and Lucifer too much for her to handle? Which part of the Winchesters' celestial lives was the most shocking to Ms. Jane? Though it intrigued Jess, she didn't ask. She figured it was a little too soon to strike up a conversation about it right now.
Sam knew that the mention of their daughter would help persuade Gabe to let him come along. And almost on cue, the archangel's golden eyes softened and his planned argument eventually resulted in a defeated breath.
Jude, Jessica, Sam, and Dickie were all sitting at the motel table when he walked inside. They had cleared most of the junk off the surface so that everyone could play together and Jessica's small plastic tea set was neatly arranged on the table, saucers and all. Sam – who was wearing some sort of crown made out of construction paper – was already sipping on his pretend beverage while Jessica poured invisible tea into Jude's cup.
“Whoa...” he breathed, gulping slightly, “I'm sorry, Jay. I don't know what came over me... I just had to have you. Maybe it was the sexy glasses, I don't know... I'm sorry.”
"Oh. Dancing. R - right," he nodded, looking so flustered and adorable.
“Your daughter is very beautiful,” she complimented, making Sam's skin crawl, “She has your intelligence and fast reflexes. She has Gabriel's strength and wit. The two of you have made a precious life together and have given her a wonderful start... But Jessica will require more than just love and support in this life, Sam. She is the daughter of an archangel – the highest ranking nephilim to ever come into being. And she is very rare, because she is the first of her kind. No other archangel in existence has ever bred with a human before. Not Michael. Not Raphael. Not even Lucifer. Gabriel is the only one to have ever produced an offspring with one of our father's creations.”
“Nice to see you too, honey,” Lucifer winked, “Consider yourself lucky. I’ve never kissed anyone in my life.”
the hell – was
Sudden worry clouded over Dean as he watched Cas glaring at Gabriel. Wait, Cas had been hurt? When? Where was Dean when it happened? Who hurt him? As the questions piled up in Dean's mind, Cas finally released Gabriel's stare to step back. The angel walked over to Dean and started brushing the food off his shoulders. His sapphire eyes were focused on the man's clothes; furious, pained, and unwilling to meet Dean's stare. Protective concern was coursing through Dean's veins as he clutched Cas's coat.
“It was a perfect answer, Dean,” Cas corrected, his breath brushing against Dean’s wet lips as he spoke, “Thank you.”
“You sounded like you were in pain,” Clare pointed out in suspicion.
resent you, Cas. That little guy loves you with all his heart,” Dean assured, caressing the side of his angel's face, “Just like I do.”
On that hopeful note, Cas swept out of the room and closed the door, making the lock click back into place behind him.
“Hell yeah! I play the guitar,” he quickly admitted, “I have, like, three of them back at home.”
“Faintly,” Cas nodded, his low voice flat, “I recall it being far to the North-West, but without knowing our current location, it would be hard to decipher... Let's use the bones from the werewolf corpses.”
“We, um, we did that yesterday,” he stated, still trying to get a grip on reality, “I came to see if you would go with me to invite a few people in person.”
,” he commented in a whisper.
“The warlock lied to us,” Cas boldly informed, “Death did not create the curse. The warlock did.”
Panic flooded Clare's body like a broken dam. Oh, shit. She was
Jessica and her Papa both gasped and covered their mouths at the same time. Marry?! Wait a second, what did that mean?
! Panic burst through Jude's whole body as he instantly scrambled to stand up from the bed and pat around his pockets and the black comforter in front of him. Oh God, where did it go?! Jude must have lost it when he was rolling around in his sleep or something! Oh, no, what was Clare going to think?!
“That's not perfume,” Sam blurted on the other side of Gabriel, “That's... just the way he smells...”
Even though Sam said that he wasn't being manipulated by Gabriel and that he really liked the trickster or whatever, Dean still had a hard time believing it. This asshole had put Sam through a lot of shit since the day they met him, and Dean didn't see it ending anytime soon. The archangel shrugged as he stepped toward a booth near the window. His cheeky grin returned when he swept some of his blonde hair back and eased down into the seat.
hearing Clarence say all of these things. The worst part was that none of it was true! Clarence wasn't trapped in a circle. He was free to be whoever he wanted to be! Jude pulled back just enough to take Clare's tear-stained face in his hands.
“Yeah. See, it sounds like the portal he’s trying to make has to be built in a specific location, so that it will join the other side in the exact same spot,” Sam explained.
sweet. Clare just went on and on about how much he loves Jude and how he never wanted to be without him... It was so romantic.”
“Bunker’s ready,” Dean explained, showing his car keys, “I’m driving. You guys want to ride with us?”
Gabriel smiled humbly as he patted Oliver on the back. The kid was giving him the hug that he never got to give his own father and it made Gabe feel all warm and fuzzy inside... The bedroom door squeaked lowly nearby, making Gabe and Oliver both turn to see who was coming in. A tiny blonde head of hair poked its way into the room and Gabe smiled at his daughter's beautiful face.
“Have a karaoke challenge!” Gabriel added with a grin, popping over to stand on the other side of Jessica, “And a Disney Princess Cosplay Contest! And we're inviting Jane, too!”
Jude and uncle Gabe both looked toward the sound of Jessie's shout and saw that Aunt Rowena was crumpled on the ground, holding her face like she had been hurt... And Raphael was stomping toward Jessie with an angel blade in his hand, backing her away from the rest of the fight. Fear and fury flew through Jude when he saw the mean angel trying to get Jessie alone. Raphael was going to hurt her! No! Jude couldn't let that happen! Jessie was his buddy! His best friend! He had to keep her safe!
The dogs piled out of the Impala, flowing out like liquid from a cup. Castiel was utterly confused watching the animals scurry out the driver's side door. How did all of those canines get into the car within the short amount of time that it was left unattended? The cluster of dogs poured all over the parking lot – before turning their attention to Dean. The man was rendered completely vulnerable as they all suddenly dashed toward him, barking and wagging their tails. The canines swarmed around him, knocking him down in order to lick his face and make obscene motions against him. Castiel was nearly frozen in shock and anger, unable to fully believe what he was seeing.
Uncle Crowley's head tilted and he blinked a few times.
! Don't hold back, baby. Please, Cas!
of the strands being pulled out by the root. Holy shit, that must have hurt! Clarence winced a little, but then held the chunk of blonde toward Rowena. The witch seemed pretty surprised, too. She only blinked between Clarence's freshly-plucked hair and his grinning face.
Jessica muffled a giggle with the sleeve of her hoodie, apparently finding Oliver's jumbled words hilarious. Sam smiled back at her, feeling so relieved. He loved hearing his daughter's laugh. And Oliver
Luckily, Dean's smile remained intact.
But when it came to
Sam was almost panting by the time Gabriel made it close enough to touch him. The archangel's hands slid up Sam's bare chest and the man thought he was going to lose it. Ugh! That felt so good! But where did all this random horniness come from? Sam knew it had something to do with the bubbles, because he could feel it swirling in his lungs with every breath he took.
The angel let go of the woman's hand as quickly as possible, which dropped it back out of sight. His statement seemed to turn the conversation a little cold, as Juanita and Jane shared a quick, private discussion in Spanish. In the meantime, Dean leaned over to whisper in Castiel's ear.
Cas’s smile returned at full power as he stepped closer to kiss Dean once more. The man savored the flavor, closing his eyes to fully taste the angel’s soft lips.
“I know,” Jude answered, gazing down at his own glowing belly, “I’ll pick one out for her… as soon as we get to a safer place.”
Gabriel gulped. Okay, Sam had some good points there – especially the part about Dean killing him – but Gabe stood by his decision. And luckily, Jessie was on his side, too. Their daughter reached across the table to place her hand on Sam's arm, giving him that 'baby bunny' look that she was so good at.
Jude shuffled over to her bed and sat down like a heavy rock. Papa must have known what was bothering him, because he paused to ask,
Cas took a deep breath and exhaled slowly as he traced Dean's bottom lip with the edge of this thumb. His blue eyes briefly glanced toward Jude at the table before returning to Dean's stare with wisdom.
The man's voice was deep and accented, though Jessica couldn't tell which country it was from. He was obviously talking to Rowena and Jess was glad. Because, at the moment, she couldn't find the nerve to turn around. Beside her, Rowena gave a giggle.
Gabe glanced at Sam beside him, who was shutting the engine off. Both of them seemed equally entertained by their daughter's feisty attitude. Sam shot the archangel a subtle look – which clearly stated '
Ollie nestled back into his seat to keep eating, but Jess couldn't stand the mess anymore. She shook her head and grabbed a napkin before leaning forward to swipe the sauce off the edge of his cheek. He watched her do it, leaning in so she wouldn't have to stretch so far. While their faces were close, Jess could see that he was searching her face with admiration.
“I know you boys've already got your hands full,” Bobby began, his voice low and eyes still wandering, “with the babies, and the angels, and whatever-the-hell-else you've got goin' on... but I really need your help with somethin'.”
“Th – thank you,” the angel breathed.
“Jessica,” Cas said, “I assume that Charlie was a surprise?”
After what happened at the tiger cage, the adults decided to take everyone onto the train and head to the other side of the park. Ollie was really excited when he heard they were going there because he knew the unicorns would be on that side. The train ride was really fun because they got to see all kinds of other animals as they rode through the zoo. Dickie stayed still in Jessie's lap the whole time, seeming happy that she decided to carry him so that he wouldn't have to wear a leash. Jude really liked the train ride, too. He sat next to uncle Cassie and pointed out all the animals that they passed with a huge smile. Jessie was so happy that everyone was having a good time.
“I don't give a shit what he's trying to be,” Dean interrupted, keeping his eyes fixed on Gabriel.
Jessica's smile grew as she nodded.
He held the angel’s soft fingers as firmly as possible as he led the way back out of Jude’s room and down the hall to the study. By the time they made it there, Bobby, Crowley, and Rowena were all mixed in with the rest of the family, sharing greetings and swooning over the babies. Clare noticed that Meg stayed directly behind him as they entered, most likely using him as a shield against Crowley’s stern glances.
picked the color!” Jessie added.
“Well, then let's crack this sucker open and take -”
is gonna have it even
It was his necklace. The charm on it was glowing white.
The female demon looked like nothing but skin and bone. Her hair, which looked like it hadn't been washed in quite some time, was laying thickly around her hollow face. Her mouth was slightly open and Jude almost thought she was already dead, but her chest was slowly rising and falling. She looked like a starved, exhausted, sickly creature... and it sadly reminded Jude of the first time he saw Clarence...
The angel nearly leaped up to grab Dean by the arm, unintentionally causing the baby to stir to life inside his grace. Dean's eyes widened at Castiel's sudden outburst and he stared back at him with concern. Castiel could not let Dean do this. He couldn't let Dean be the one to cut him open, especially if something went wrong. Dean would never be able to live with himself if he had to bear the weight of Castiel's death.
Farmers were a rare gift to mankind. But they could not compare to the greatness of hunters.
“I don't know,” Sam admitted, feeling terrible.
Dean could feel his own tears forming. They blended in with the rest of the hot water dripping from his face. Dean may have helped the king a little bit, but it was the king who sacrificed himself to save Dean’s life…
“Dammit, Sam,” Dean grumbled, climbing out of the vehicle in a rush, “This is the kind of shit I'm talking about!”
“Hey, moose-cakes,” Gabriel hummed, shuffling across the hotel room to tap on Sam's shoulder, “Did you see those brochures for the zoo at the front desk when we came in?”
Sam instantly lifted his head from Gabriel's body to look across the room – where he saw his three-year-old nephew standing in the doorway. Blood drained from Sam's face as he stared at Jude in horror. Oh, shit! Sam's hands were still clamped on Gabe's mouth and crotch. Jude's blue eyes were fully focused on his two uncles, who were standing half naked in an inappropriate pose. Oh God,
“I think all this hard work calls for a reward, don't you?” he smiled.
“Nobody is going to take you away from us, sunshine,” Gabriel promised, leaning over to stamp a kiss to her forehead, “Did this happen while you were asleep? Did you see them in your mind?”
While Papa and uncle Dean went to go look for a camera, Jessica noticed a figure standing at the entrance of the study and turned around - and was surprised to see Clarence. The lanky guy, with his stringy hair a mess on his head, must have come over to see what everyone was talking about. Jessica was actually excited to see him up and walking around. He had been avoiding other people for way too long.
“Thank you, Papa. I love you so much,” Jessie whispered.
to talk to the baby? But why? What could he possibly say that was any different than what Gabriel was rambling on about?
Jude stared down at the cards in his own hand and wondered the same thing. Each card had a different picture from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory on it. Jude looked along all the faces and smiled. He couldn't wait to watch the movie with Jessie when they got back home...
“Because when I first got them, Papa told me that I should give one to somebody special. Someone important to me. That way, we could each have something to remind us of each other,” Jude explained, too shy to look anywhere but at the toy in his hand, “This is going to sound silly, but… I kinda hoped that if I gave you one, it would make you homesick and you’d come back to me… Wait, that doesn’t make sense…”
Saying his name seemed to be enough to move everyone else into action. Jessica, Jude, and Oliver all glanced toward each other before scurrying over to group together. They all took one last look at the warlock, making sure he was
“Eat... me... Singer...” the demon wheezed.
Oliver’s face turned almost as red as his hair. The kid gulped and looked away bashfully, as if he just realized that he had said something extremely private out loud.
“A baby,” she repeated, smiling as a few tears slipped from her eyes, “My – my first baby. It's a baby! Papa, I'm gonna have
"Ooooh," Clarence hummed with a smile and a nod, "Zeppelin, huh? They've got some good songs. I've tried copying the riff from 'Whole Lotta Love,' but I'm not too good at it."
“So, no. You don't have a son. Clarence belongs to
“So he would tell him as well,” Cas finished, bobbing his head with clarity, “I understand.”
Jude nodded, feeling excited to learn everything he could about him. Uncle Gabe softly patted Jude's knee again with a comforting touch before tilting his head and saying,
adopt a couple of bone-head Winchesters. And they both turned out alright.”
hard to find. When he first got the key to the place from a guy at his doorstep – an encounter that Bobby barely remembered because he had gotten drunk off his ass after a successful ghoul hunt and wasn't expect visitors – he figured that he would eventually get around to investigating the bunker. But his was the first trip he had ever taken to get there.
The angel's feet slowed to a stop at once and he turned his sight toward the shining object. It was in a glass case, high upon a top shelf. At first, Castiel assumed that his eyes were playing tricks on him. There was no way that what he was seeing could be real. But, after stepping close enough to inspect it properly, the angel was surprised to find that it was perfectly genuine. The shining object in the glass case was made entirely of
“Me too. I've only been once, but I know you're gonna love it. They have rides and games and everything. Like Disneyland. Only much smaller. And cheaper. And with more emphasis on crops,” he rambled with a grin.
The mention of marriage created an uncomfortable shift in the air. Oliver let out a breathless chuckle and shook his head again, sliding his knees up to his chest to loosely hug them.
“This is a piece from one of the Pyramids in Egypt,” the angel explained. “I couldn’t tell you which one, because they were destroyed by the time I made it there, buried in the desert sand like a sunken ship. This was all that was salvageable.”
“That's a list of everything Jessica will need to have done before she can be properly enrolled,” he explained, “Once all that paperwork is out of the way, she can start.”
Too late? Dammit, what were they going to do to Dean? Take him somewhere and kill him? Neither one of his beloved Castiels would like that very much… The first voice was quiet, only sniffling a little like he had a bloody nose, but then muttered under his breath.
Dean took the time to glance up at Cas – where they both gave each other soft smiles and blushes – before turning back to give his brother a truthful nod. Yep, it was a boy. A tiny little Winchester who was destined to have Cas's gorgeous blue eyes. The minute Sam got his answer, he turned to give Gabriel a huge grin.
before you would even step in and help -”
"Fine," Jude forced himself to say while rolling his eyes, "Just put those things away."
“Dammit, kid,” the archangel spat, “Don't ever scare me like that again.”
!” Gabriel whispered, looking terrified.
“Until I what?” Jane asked.
“Oh, I get it. It's fine. I'm still getting used to the salvage yard,” Clarence respectfully assured.
“Why?” Castiel asked.
“It's not your fault -”
Clarence cut off Jude's sentence by plunging their mouths together. Jude hummed a little bit and closed his eyes as he felt his fiance's hands roaming all over his clothed body. While they kissed passionately, Clare was tugging at Jude's shirt, pulling it up so that he could touch Jude's back and chest.
Jude immediately tightened his hand around Clare's, feeling his own eyes tingle with tears. Somehow, he felt like Clare had taken the words right out of his mouth. Jude was grateful for Clarence, too. But he was still curious. He wanted to know how Clare did it; how he fought Darkness so easily. Now was his chance to ask.
“So, which dress do you like, Charlie?” Jess asked, gesturing toward the massive wardrobe.
“Yes, I believe it will,” Cas nodded, stepping around to face Dean and look over it again with a smile, “I'm not sure why our son has such a fondness for this 'Superman' character, but I'm glad he is able to draw strength from it.”
For a small second, Dean forgot how to even breathe. Holy shit! It was a chrome dick! The same dick he fantasized about all the freakin' time! Every tiny detail of it was absolutely perfect, veins and muscles glimmering in the light. It was entirely chrome. And it was so damn
“What exactly are you trying to find here, Dean?” he mumbled.
“He wants us to begin the process,” the new angel said.
Jess smiled at the thought as she fed her hungry baby. The kitchen settled down for a few minutes after that. Papa finished making Dad some pancakes while Dean and Cas talked quietly behind Jessica. Though she tried to focus on feeding her child and staying out of their private conversation, Jess couldn’t help but overhear a few concerning things.
He was alive and well and he loved hearing Dean's voice! He loved hearing his father talk to him!
“But, my vessel's body temperature is within normal levels,” Cas said, making a weird face, “Does it feel heated to you?”
"Why aren't
Bobby gulped under Crowley's intense stare. There weren't many people in the world that had the ability to make a mighty full-grown hunter like Bobby Singer feel like a small red-faced school boy. But Crowley had somehow managed to do it. Bobby couldn't remember the last time his cheeks had flushed with heat and his heart raced with nervousness. But no matter how quick-witted and clever that demonic bastard was, Bobby was bound and determined not to let Crowley get the best of him.
Poor Castiel, right? ;D I, like Jessica, own a vagina. But unlike Jessica, I have never pushed a full sized baby out of it. So if anything in this chapter seems unrealistic, it's because I have yet to birth a child. (Maybe one day though, right? Lol) ;D I know Jess's pregnancy went by super fast, but I figured her powerful grace would cook a baby up in even less time than Gabe's. ;) And Charlie Jane is here! Yay! :D I hope that Jude and Clare's first dance wasn't too overshadowed by Dean and Cas. I just figured that Jude wouldn't mind sharing the spotlight a little, and Dean and Cas never had a first dance, and Dean really wanted to play Elvis for Cas, and – yeah. Excuses, excuses. XD I promise that Jude and Clare are going to get a real first night together soon. Their Honeymoon is going to be absolutely amazing. :D And I added another chapter to the end of this part, so that I could cram in all the fluff that I wanted to include. So there are two whole chapters left to go! :D I hope you guys are still enjoying the story! Thank you so much – seriously, so much! – for reading this super long fic! I really hope that it continues to make you smile, some hundred chapters in. XD I love you guys! The next chapter will be out soon! :D
Sam gulped in the dark. Keep him company? The man's eyes flashed up to inspect the rest of the bed, where he discovered the empty sheets. Gabriel was gone. Sam, Jess, and Dickie were the only souls in the room. A small dose of panic mixed in with Sam's worry as he held his child close to his chest. Where the hell did Gabe go? And why didn't he wake Sam up to tell him he was leaving?
"Can I try them on?" she asked.
“Looks like you need a shave, little man,” Dad joked, briefly touching Jude’s cheek, “You’re starting to look like me.”
“Thanks for watching the kids… Grandpa,” Clare smirked.
Hearing Clarence call him a girl's name again made anger flare in Jude's chest. He reached out and pushed Clarence's hip, making the guy finally stumble off the bed and catch himself on the bookshelf. In the process, Clarence dropped his bowl of cereal and spilled milk everywhere. Jude gasped when he saw the white fluid soaking into his fresh superhero sheets. No! Those were just washed! Now they were going to have to be washed again! On the other side of the room, Clarence stood up straight and looked at the mess, but his expression didn't change. He only shook his head and met eyes with Jude over the ruined sheets.
“Far from it, sidekick,” uncle Gabe sighed, “One day, out of the blue, our Father vanished. We didn't know where he went, why he left, or what we were supposed to do without him. And... It was especially too much for me to handle... so I left, too...”
Cas and Dean shared a small look of concern. Why did Jude want to talk to Dean alone? Was something wrong? Though he was clearly worried, Cas gave Jude a nod and a gentle smile before affectionately squeezing Dean's arm and walking out. His absence left the two of them alone in Jude's room, which looked so much brighter and cozier with Jude in it. Hoping to get to the bottom of his son's distress, Dean carefully squatted down until he was at perfect eye level with Jude.
Jude raised his head at the sound of the low voice nearby. To everyone's surprise, Michael had followed them into the kitchen. The archangel's face was beaten up pretty badly – bloody nose, bruised lip, swollen eye – but it didn't seem to hurt him. In fact, of what Jude could see of Michael's facial expressions, the guy appeared more sad than anything. Still resting inside Jude's hug, Clarence slowly lifted his head up to look at the archangel too. He didn't say anything though, because he was still under the calming effects of Jude's grace.
“Hey there, baby bunny,” he smiled, “Thank you for staying with Daddy while I was gone.”
Jessie immediately nodded and giggled, filling the room with the beautiful sound.
"Y - You're playing my song," Jude blurted.
The handsome demon took a large breath and finally faced Jude. He held up the blueish white potion and briefly pursed his lips together.
“A pregnancy test?”
“Alright, guys. There’s something serious we want to talk to you all about,” Dean began, pointing toward the boys near him, “Jude and Clare have been trying to have a baby.”
“What's up, sidekick?” Gabe prompted.
Clarence was so overwhelmed by the sound of Jude's voice and the sight of his handsome, familiar face that he almost burst into tears again. Jude had flown to his side and blasted Caldwell across the room, even though he hated flying and fighting more than anything. The demon nodded to answer the angel's question, but before he could speak, he noticed a figure running toward them. Caldwell had gotten up and was now running toward Jude – with the blade raised over his head.
“What happened, Jude?” Jessie asked with a worried face.
After accumulating his grace again, Lucifer delivered another hard blow to the same spot. This one caused the flimsy cabin to quiver on the ground, but the wards remained. Again, thunder rumbled from the sky, and eventually made rain start falling. Lucifer ignored the minor inconvenience. He didn’t have time to worry about being in a wet vessel when there was hell to be paid. He figured that one more giant crack would be enough to break through the protective invisible wall, so he gripped the scythe tight and began to build up his power.
“Absolutely,” Castiel nodded, “Good night, brother. And thank you again.”
” Cas boomed in Enochian, narrowing his eyes into slits, “My son. Gabriel. The cage. Where are they?”
“Of course you would know, aye?”
“What did you dream of?” he asked, edging his thumb against Dean's cheekbone, “Perhaps I can comfort you, Dean. What sort of vision disturbed you?”
“Damn, Jay… You look so good at this angle,” he breathed.
Gabriel could tell that his nephew had not only experienced how awesome an Enochian aphrodisiac could be, but also appreciated it more than anyone else that had accidentally tried it. Though, giving the kid more did seem kind of dangerous. Maybe Gabriel could make a new, less potent batch for Jude and Clare to use. Not wanting to disappoint a fan of his work, Gabe winked and gave the kid a sage nod.
“No, sweet lamb, it’s nobody’s fault,” she cooed.
“I'm sorry,” Jude almost whispered, “I just... I wanted to f – feel you inside me.”
Jessica suddenly lurched up from the table and turned to stumble through the bar. Papa's heavenly voice kept singing, ringing through the whole place, but she was trying to get away from it. Because he was breaking her heart. Jessica darted passed some smiling drag queens, feeling her way through the building. She eventually came across the exit and took the way out, leaving behind her Papa's beautiful voice and all the happy people. Outside in the parking lot, it was dark and quiet. The harsh atmosphere eerily reminded her of the terrible dream she had the night before. This was what she had to look forward to. She was going to trade her wonderful, lovely life for this bleak, lonely existence. What an awful deal!
Even though he knew it was true, Jude still shivered at the confirmation. Just outside the cabin that Jude was on the verge of giving birth in was the same angel responsible for the destruction of the bunker…
“But, Dean,” Castiel protested, feeling confused, “if we do not -”
! Ollie's hand eventually fell away from her lower half and he came crashing down on top of her, softly burying his face into her mess of blonde hair on the bed.
The sound of Gabe's approval sent jolts to Sam's own hard cock. He bobbed his mouth along Gabriel's hot shaft, keeping his eyes open to stare at the lower part of Gabe's stomach. A few inches below the archangel's navel and just above his blonde pubic hair was a very familiar scar. The horizontal line was faint but still visible on Gabe's skin. It was the only scar his body refused to heal; the aftermath of their daughter coming into the world. Apart from his hypnotic golden eyes, this scar was Sam's favorite part of Gabriel's body. It was like a memorial to everything they went through to have Jessica. And it made Gabriel even more beautiful than he already was.
As soon as he heard Cas's voice, Jude leaped out of Dean's arms. The toddler instantly scrambled for Cas, reaching up to hook both arms around the angel's neck and hug him tight. Cas gently cradled their terrified son against him but his eyes remain locked on Dean, wanting answers.
The little boy laid his cards down and climbed out of his seat to walk across the hotel room and get to Jessie. He could see her face when he rounded the end of the bed and it made him worried. Her eyes were closed but her nose was all scrunched up and she was moving around a lot. She must have been having a bad dream.
“What happened?” Dean asked.
“Yeah, Moose. Sounds good to me,” the archangel answered.
“Michael,” he beamed.
him. It felt like the two of them never had a chance to be alone and talk anymore. Things kept getting in the way of their personal time and Dean missed having Cas all to himself. The days of taking his angel and hiding away from the rest of the world, even if it was just for a few hours, seemed long gone. And, dammit, Dean really wanted them back.
. God, he loved Gabe
“We, uh, we built a portal,” Bobby admitted.
to sleep in the same room together.”
Surprisingly, there was pure honesty in Clarence's voice. It seemed the demon really was fine. Still, Castiel wondered...
After witnessing Dean's smile return, Castiel nested back into the crook of his arm. Many thoughts were passing through the angel's mind while he lay naked on the blanket with his favorite human. He briefly pondered on the splendor of his father's creation, and recalled the jar of raw honey that Dean had purchased for him, and acknowledged how perfect his first date with Dean had been.
“Deal. I've got a lot of moose-time to catch up on,” Gabe agreed, squeezing Sam closer to his side.
“Wh – what should we do, Dad?” Jude squeaked, looking to Dean for an answer.
“R – really?” Jude asked, feeling a little creeped out.
Not long after everyone started to settle in the cabin and the sun went down, Bobby, Crowley, and Rowena arrived. They were all a little less cheery then before, for obvious reasons. Jess and her Papa came over to greet them, though Jess found it difficult to look Bobby in the eye. How could she stand to see him when she was partly responsible for the fate of his beloved dog?
A war cry rang out somewhere in front of Sam and he looked up just in time to see Dean and Cas mow down a pack of angry creatures. Sam had no idea what kind of monsters they were until he noticed that Dean was deliberately cutting their heads off. And that their necks were painting the ground with pitch black goo.
” Dean sputtered, shocked at Bobby's interference.
Seeing the unicorn must have made Jude feel better too, because he and Ollie grabbed each other by the arm and shared a laugh before racing each other to the car. On the way there, Jessica caught sight of her Daddy leaning close to her Papa. His big hands crept over Papa's shoulders and he bent down to nuzzle his mouth next to Papa's ear.
“In accordance with law of our ancestors,” Gabe read, “the pistachios – sorry,
“Uncle Gabe?” Jude's voice sounded so squeaky and small in the silence, “Why are we in this place?”
Before Jude could even finish his sentence, Clarence was stepping away from the group and entering the study to kneel down next to Rowena and Crowley. The guy clearly didn't want to talk about anything that was happening, even to Jude. Dean turned around to give his son a half hug along with Cas.
Crowley turned to face the other four men in the study, raising his head up higher to look among them all. But Sam noticed that he stuck his hands in his suit pockets, as if hiding nervous, jittery fingers.
“There is no son here,” Jude barked.
Jude instantly raised his head and reached out to feel the spot Clare had been laying in, noticing that the bed was still a little warm. That meant that Clare had only just left, but where did he go? To the bathroom or something? He wasn't taken by the warlock again, was he?
When Cas mentioned Gabriel, Dean knew exactly what he was talking about. A few weeks earlier, the Winchesters learned about a massive asshole named Asmodeus. The dude was some kind of Knight of Hell who had tried to take over Crowley’s throne once or something. Crowley recruited their help in hunting down and killing the bastard, but when they raided his little corner of Hell, all they found was a bunch of destroyed spell books about making a portal – and a severely traumatized archangel. Not only was Gabriel – the trickster who died helping the Winchesters stop the apocalypse –
“Wh – what is it?” she asked, “Papa, is it bad?”
“You are... always so tight at first,” Cas mentioned, his voice dripping with arousal.
“But, you... You still have it,” Dean said, feeling waves of emotion start to crash over him, “You've held onto it all this time? For three whole years?”
“If we make it out of this, you're getting the greatest blow job of your life,” Gabe hummed playfully into Sam's ear.
“Fine. Whatever. Just make it quick,” the older Winchester grumbled.
"No, but I'm sure he's okay," Sam promised, able to see the concern building in his daughter's eyes, "I'll see you guys at breakfast."
A tiny 'woof' came from their left.
“Don't move,” the angel warned, his harsh tone sending an electric pulse to straight to Dean's dick.
“Can we start now?” she practically begged, putting on Sammy's signature puppy eyes.
“This?” he murmured, “I acquired it when I gave birth to you, Jude.”
"You go ahead and finish that, little man," Dean allowed, stepping back to admire the sight of his son's pink cheeks and dopey smile, "I'm gonna get some Chamomile tea with honey for your Papa."
“What if the demons see this?” he asked.
? Again, Dean searched the spot his son was pointing toward, but he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. There weren't any glowing men in the area. Just a bunch of college kids, old guys, and dads with their children. Still, Dean stared as hard as he could, hoping to see whatever his son was seeing.
Cas stopped talking for a second as if the memory was too painful to put into words. Dean was stunned. Not only was he dead in this universe, but Sam was, too. Dean couldn’t imagine surviving without his little brother. Part of him was glad that they at least died together here. Luckily, his Sam was safe and sound back home. At least, Dean hoped…
“Alright, assholes, how are we gonna lock this shit up?” Clare asked in a short tone.
“That Japanese steak house up the road,” Clarence called, “Don't worry. I'm buying.”
“Maybe we should start looking for a place, then,” he suggested, sounding hopeful.
Castiel smiled and pulled the man into a tighter embrace, remembering all the wonderful things Dean had said to Gabriel.
She was being honest. There was no point in lying to Oliver. He would be able to see right through her, anyway.
both of you.”
Hey guys! :) I'm sorry if this chapter sounds a little awkward or rushed. I knew that switching between so many different povs would be weird, but I hope it's still readable and enjoyable. Lol. :D I think that of all the characters so far, Oliver Thomspon may have the greatest willpower. I mean, not only was he felt up and begged by his fiance to have sex in an airport, but he also got naked and sat in a tub with her, and
dead, right? He can't come back, can he?” Sam asked.
Even as Dean's mind was assaulted with thoughts narrated by John Winchester, his presence was finally noticed. Cas's ocean eyes caught sight of him and widened dramatically. The angel instantly sprang up from the island, grabbed a near by mug, and headed toward his husband. Dean barely had enough time to notice that Cas was wearing one of his Led Zeppelin t-shirts and plaid pajama pants before he was greeted with the angel's moist lips. Unfortunately, Dean barely felt the kiss, because he knew he was unworthy of having it...
To Clare's surprise, Meg actually smiled. She hummed a tiny, hidden laugh and shook her head.
“They seem content. Steady heartbeats. Lungs are working. They have decent room to move,” Michael paused to smile a little before looking up at Jude, “Your daughter is enjoying the pizza.”
Rowena giggled and blushed again before turning to prance back up the steps, making her velvet dress swish around. Bobby and Crowley stayed quiet and still until she was all the way out of sight. Once they were alone again, the demon took a large breath and hung his head in front of the old man.
Sam smiled in delight before heading into the room first. Dean held the door but paused to offer his hand to Castiel again. Overcome with joy, Castiel slid his hand back inside Dean’s, where it belonged, and allowed the man to guide him into their Heaven. Dean kissed Cas’s knuckles as he went, making the angel’s stomach flutter.
,” Dad sang softly.
The demon could barely think straight. His heart was pounding, his eyes were watering, and he had a sudden urge to break something. His breath picked up and he began to pant like he was on the verge of a panic attack, which made Jude jump up from the bed and grab his arm.
“Oooh, Cas, you're such a
Dean waved off the archangel, watching him carefully open the door to his and Sam's room and prance inside. Once he was alone, Dean faced forward to start moseying down the corridor. He was already eying the last door on the left, hoping that an certain angel in a trench coat was just beyond it. Would Cas be waiting there for him? Would they finally get to be alone again? Or did he still have that kid hanging off of him? Dean grimaced toward the floor at the sudden thought of her. Those terrible feelings she gave him were back, making him feel worse. God, he really hoped that she had made it home okay...
“It's okay,” Jude said, voice no longer trembling, but steady and relaxed, “I'm not afraid. I can do this.”
“Give me that!”
Crowley only raised an eyebrow at Dean's threat. Even though the man was being dead serious, the demon didn't seem to take his words to heart.
“Thirty-three to be exact,” Gabriel added, leaning forward as well, “So, should Cassie and I blow them away now or wait for old-man-river to show up?”
“Hey, I'm gonna need that peach back when you're done,” the archangel called, causing Castiel to look in his direction, “and it better be in perfect condition, too!”
Gabriel took the time to look back down at his daughter's precious face for a moment. He gently brushed some stray strands of blonde hair away from her forehead to admire her beautiful eyes – good grief, they were carbon copies of Sam's – before pressing his lips to one of her soft cheeks.
“Why?” Cas blurted, his eyes narrowed and head tilted, “Why would you make that kind of deal with him?”
Ugh, his words weren’t coming out very clearly. Oh God, what if Cas couldn’t hear him? What if those demons got passed Meg and dragged Dean to the inferno room, just like they wanted?! On the floor, Dean tried to wiggle away, kicking his joined legs like a fish out of water. He could hear Meg’s panting voice and stabbing sounds, but he had no idea what was going on – until he felt a pair of hands grab his hood and yank it off.
Luckily, Cas seemed to be feeling the same way. The blue eyed angel only smiled a few times, and spent the rest of the dinner gazing at Jude with that forlorn, worried-mother look. Dean eventually sat his drink down and leaned over to comfort his anxious husband.
“Alright look, Singer. We love you
next to him. The angel's eyes were closed and his mouth was open slightly, muttering quiet snores with every breath. For a few minutes, Dean simply blinked and searched Cas's face, watching him breathe in and out as the sunlight gradually brightened the room around them. The man couldn't recall ever seeing Cas sleep before. The dude was an angel. He didn't need to sleep. It was only after stealing a glance toward the glowing blanket between them that Dean realized that the pregnancy must have been causing Cas to feel sleepy.
Michael?”
Nearly everyone chuckled at uncle Sam's misinterpretation of Dad's words, save Jess and Papa. Jess only shook her head and rolled her eyes, but Papa appeared a little confused and offended that uncle Sam would call Dad names. Uncle Gabe eventually pulled Sam further along.
“The journey to Hell,” Michael answered, wearing a look of defeat mixed with annoyance, “I loath saying this... but we will need Lucifer.”
“Can you give me a minute alone with your dad?” Clare asked.
“Eh, sure, Castiel. You're welcome, I guess,” Gabriel sighed, “But you need to make Dean drink that water, okay? We don't need anymore leg-humpers around here. Dickie is bad enough.”
“Here.”
“But...” Ollie squeaked, sounding sad as he followed everyone out, “What about the unicorns?”
“Jeanette taught me how to paint them,” he said, voice much lighter, “She was one of the women I grew up with... She was painting something on a canvas one day, and I think I stole one of her brushes and started copying her by painting on the walls,” he chuckled a bit, “She didn't scold me, though. She actually knelt down on the floor with me and started brushing flowers on the brick. I don't know how long we spent down there. It was almost like a mural by the time we were done... Man, I wish you could have seen it, Jaybird. You would have loved it...”
,” he said, caressing Castiel's stomach with his fingertips.
“I should probably warn you of what to expect before you go in,” the demon hummed, eyes fixed on Gabe, “When Michael and Lucifer were tossed into that cage twelve years ago, it wasn't in the most stable condition. We've put spells around the outside of the cage to accommodate for the reach of their grace, so don't get too close. I would recommend staying five feet back if you want to remain on the outside of the bars. Otherwise, they can transport you inside. A few of my men found that out the hard way...”
“Oliver,” he began, “I don't care what's in this bag. And I don't mind you hiding stuff in the bunker. But if you're going to do it, at least tell one of the adults about it, alright? We don't keep secrets around here.”
When he realized he was alone on the doorstep, Dean shook himself from his own daze to chase after the little blonde jerk, who was already half-way down the spiral staircase in the control room. The rest of Dean's family, with the exception of Jude, stood around below, watching the stranger barge into their home uninvited. Clarence - if that was even his real name - took a dramatic deep breath and looked around at everything and everyone as he wandered in, eying the Winchesters with hints of humor and interest on his face.
“How's that, buddy?” Dean asked.
“Things were never easy after our Father left. Of course, you wouldn't know that. You left, too,” she spat bitterly, “But those of us who remained tried to cope and bring about some kind of order. It started with a council of high-ranking angels. Michael, Raphael, and a few others. For a while, the makeshift democracy ran smoothly. Until we sent Castiel to save Dean Winchester from Hell...”
making them count,” Sam slurred against Gabe's skin as he softly raked his fingers through the archangel's golden hair, “I'm not gonna let you go until our time is up.”
Oliver chuckled, feeling hot moisture swell in his eyes. He was really going to do that? He had always wanted to build a real fort...
Without a word, Michael stepped over and tapped two fingers to Jude's forehead. The archangel's silvery grace shined for a second before releasing Jude, leaving him completely sober. Jude stood up a little straighter and coughed, blinking as he looked around at all the faces staring back at him.
Dean glanced back to see that Sam was on his feet and holding both bloody hands out to Gabriel. The short archangel whimpered and winced a bit – acting like an injured five-year-old, rather than an ancient being – but eventually let Sam raise him up.
“Yes,” Castiel answered, confused by Gabriel's horror, “and Dean had two. Brother, what is wrong?”
The archangel started tugging the tall man away without another word, determined to make it to their room as soon as possible. Though his heart was pumping sudden arousal through his veins, Sam took the time to glance back and give his departing uncle a wave.
“I see. And which version of this complex emotion are you referring to? I was under the assumption that there was only one,” Crowley growled, his eyes turning into slits.
Dean was moving again, pulling Castiel around the corner into the corridor that led to their bedroom. This time, an almost inhuman groan burst from Dean's mouth and he had to stop and push Cas against the wall again, grinding his manhood firmly against the angel's. Even through several layers of clothing, Castiel could feel his husband's erection. And the sensation nearly caused him to gasp in shock. Dean was so very
at me...”
Gabe didn’t reply. His grip on Sam’s shirt only got tighter.
Castiel smiled as he released his brother, still feeling a rush of emotions.
“Did you have fun last night, Cas?” Dean casually asked, petting the angel's thigh under the table with his eyes still locked with Gabriel's golden stare, “because it sure sounded like you did.”
“Is everything alright, Dean? What happened? What did he say?” Cas asked in a panicked blur.
“Jessica, it's alright,” he promised in a whisper, making her look him in the eye, “Daddy won't let them take you. But you've got to fly away, okay? You've got to -”
“Now,” Dean breathed, “What do you say we ditch this messy kitchen, throw on a couple of cowboy hats and have some fun?”
“What is it, Dean?” the angel asked.
From the time he was little and all the way through his shitty teenage years, Clarence rarely ever thought about having a father. He had so many moms around – all seven witches that took him in, plus the real one he was searching for – that he didn't care about having a dad. It never really occurred to him that there might be some man out there that looked and sounded like him. And once Crowley confirmed his father's death all those years ago, Clare had a defined answer. The guy was dead. Good. That meant the 'family drama' was over before it had a chance to begin. Clare never wanted to meet the guy anyway… or so he thought.
Jude didn't say anything. He waited for Clare to continue.
Sam edged his way over to stand against the wall opposite Dean, bracing his back against the flat surface and taking deliberate breaths. Sammy still looked scared out of his mind, pale and wide-eyed with his fingers nearly trembling at his sides. And the kid had every right to be afraid. Because Dean wasn't sure exactly how he was supposed to react to all of this. The piercing hornet stings were starting pissing him off. After a few ticks of silent staring, Dean simply opened his hands in disbelief.
can fly, too.”
Daddy dropped to his knees on the ground and Jude crashed into him; hugging him so tight that his arms hurt. Daddy hugged him back just as hard, holding him and making crying sounds while he kissed Jude's face. He was so happy that Jude was back, but Jude was really excited! He couldn't wait to tell Daddy what he did!
*quickly slides into riot gear* Yes, folks, we've reached the lowest, most emotionally-challenging part of the story. Please don't hurt me too badly! *braces for multiple assaults* I believe that, even in the show, John's voice is probably the mouthpiece for Dean's doubt and anxiety. And whenever that bastard starts talking, Dean ends up making all the wrong choices. :( When I was writing this chapter, I realized that Dean was sort of acting like Woody from the first Toy Story. Meg is Buzz, Cas is Andy, and Dean is jealous as hell. ;) I think it's funny how even though Meg hasn't done much of anything since her reappearance, every other character views her from drastically different perspectives. Cas sees her as a forlorn friend, Crowley sees her as a selfish whore, Clare sees her as a mom in the making, and Dean sees her as his potential replacement who has come to steal his family away. Weird how humans all react differently to things, huh? :) And speaking of characters, in case you couldn't tell, Ollie and Jess's little girl is kind of like Charlie Bradbury reincarnated. XD (Get it? 'cause she's a girl? With red hair? From Supernatural? It's all connected!) ;D By the way, spoiler alert, Clarence will probably call her 'C.J.' XD With all that said, I hope that this chapter wasn't too emotional for you, and that you will continue the story to see how it goes. ;) Thank you all so much for blessing me every week with your amazing and thoughtful comments! I absolutely love hearing your individual stories. :) Thank you so much for touching my heart! :) The next chapter will be out soon! :)
“Are you sure you don't want me to take this off?” Sam asked, gesturing to the bow tie.
Uncle Dean placed a pie on the table – closer to his own seat than anyone else's – and stepped over to pat Cas's shoulder.
“See?” Lucifer panted, grinning as he held Adam’s fragile head in a tight hold, “It’s so easy make someone compliant… All you have to do is take away the thing they love…”
“I still feel really bad about Angel biting you yesterday. So Crowley and Rowena helped me enchant these for you,” he explained, “If you wear these when the hellhound is around, you'll be able to see her.”
"You... you guys actually screwed each other?" Clarence blurted, looking between Jessie's parents.
our high priestess in a garden of rosemary... On a hill... Uh, something about a grave made out of hardened clay... Yadda, yadda, yadda,... Ah-ha! It says here that they laid their book of untempered magic to rest with their coven leader.”
Jude felt the heat surge on his face. Why did Dad still have to call him little man? He wasn't little. He was about to get married.
. Stop squirming, little Raven. I don’t want to hurt you,” Lucifer purred, petting her face with his free hand, “I just want to know where your scythe is. Is it in your desk? Some kind of filing cabinet? In the – ?”
“Pop and I will take this home for you, Jude,” Dad promised as he began to roll the map back up.
break it,” Clare concluded, starting to pull Jude toward the door, “Thanks for the tip.”
“Cas?” he whispered.
The man turned to look at the blue-eyed angel next to him. Cas had placed his hand on Dean's shoulder and was staring at him with soft eyes. He looked very wise all of the sudden, as if all the millenniums of time and knowledge were present in his stare.
Jude gently guided Clare to the vacant seats, but Clare had a hard time taking his eyes away from the archangel across the room. The concerned look on Michael’s face was kind of starting to piss Clare off. Why couldn’t he just be happy for his nephew, like the rest of the family? Was he really going to be petty and jealous? …Or was there something else?
The three angels dismissed Cas and came for Dean, glaring as they charged. Dean raised his own blade in preparation to stab the one in the middle – but Cas tackled them all out of the way. They fell into a huge pile on the floor before blinking out of sight. Dean was suddenly alone in the room, panting and holding his blade. Where the hell did they all go? Did they fly away or something? As Dean looked back out into the hall, he could hear noises coming from below his feet. The angels were now fighting in the lower part of the bunker.
“No?” he repeated, “What do you mean?”
! Your mouth is s – so
,'” uncle Gabe boomed in a deep voice, “But the little pigs said, '
“You'll understand in due time, Gabriel. Have some patience,” their Father winked, “In the meantime, keep taking care of each other and counting your blessings.”
He swiftly exited Sam and Gabriel's room, glad that no one was in the hallway to see him. Once the door closed firmly at his back, Dean strolled over to room 69b and used the same key card to get in. The man took a deep breath when he entered the room, filling his nose with the scent. Ah, there was that heavenly smell; the smell of Cas and sex and leftover pie... Their room was still partially destroyed – which made Dean kind of wonder why the hotel staff hadn't come in and tried to make a fuss about the broken window at least – and slightly cold. But, again, Dean dismissed the state of the room to focus on his plan.
“That means
Jude nearly gasped at his friend's comment. What? How did Ollie know what 'sex' tasted like? Was he just being nice by agreeing... or did he lose his virginity during the Darkness fiasco, like Jude did? Uncle Sam probably wondered the same thing too, because he nearly choked on his own cake before spinning to stare Ollie down.
“You are alone,” Darkness growled forcefully.
. The rest of my meaningless life is already planned out. But I will never,
After tidying up her black hair, Ms. Jane walked over to the bed to kiss Jessie's forehead. She bent down to peck a kiss to Jess's belly too, and even leaned over to kiss Jude's temple, which made him smile. Uncle Gabe got a kiss on the cheek from her, but Ollie received the biggest kiss of all; a long hug and smooch on his freckled face.
All of the Winchesters glanced amongst each other in wonder. What kind of spell was he talking about? How would it apply to everyone and still be able to help Jude fly? Dean and Castiel were already leery to agree to such a strange procedure. Before anyone could formally acknowledge the suggested spell, Bobby shuffled forward to gesture to the back of the garage.
The little girl scooped the shining dog up into her tiny arms, where Dickie gave a cheerful bark and licked her cheeks. Jessica giggled and shook her blonde head away from the dog's playful tongue, filling the room with the delightful noise.
Clare flailed his hand back and forth, trying to get rid of the pain. Jude reached up and grabbed it, lighting up his own fingers with his grace. The angel’s celestial touch took away all the pain and made the blood disappear. Clare looked down at his own hand in wonder, still amazed that Jude could heal him so fast.
Sam shot his brother a mild glare.
Jessie started talking, but Jude didn't hear a word she said. His cousin's voice was drowned out by another voice in his head. It was deep and quiet, but had an undertone of urgency.
family of hunters helped me find her. I waited my
Dean's eyes furiously whipped back and forth between his child and the ill-mannered demon at the fridge. What? No. Hell no. Him?! Clarence? No way! Dean could have swore that Jude liked girls, because of the magazines! But Clarence was a guy! And he wasn't even human! He was a
Dean took an easing breath before turning to look fully at Cas's face. The angel's baby-blues were on him already, boring into him with passion. Ah, shit. There was nothing else on earth that could put Dean at ease quite like looking into Cas's eyes. He didn't have much personal experience with it, but Dean assumed that this was probably what it felt like to
Another dose of terror shot through Jude's body, but he forced himself to nod. Stage fright or no, he wasn't going to let anything stop him from saying his vows to Clarence. Jude swallowed again and briefly released Clare's hands so that he could dig out the paper in his pocket. It was slightly crumpled up and had multiple scribbles; resembling a physical version of Jude's own feelings at the moment. Once he had the words on paper in front of him, Jude reached his free hand back out to grab Clare's. It took him a few seconds to find his own voice.
The door to the right suddenly opened, gaining everyone's attention. Another angel came into the room and immediately walked up to the others. Dean watched the interaction, listening closely to figure out as much information as he could.
Dean felt pretty sure about his own conclusion... until he saw a somber look drift across Chuck's face. The guy exhaled and looked down at the table sadly, as if he was confronted with a painful truth that he didn't want to acknowledge.
raped her and left her to die. She never wanted me. She was forced to have me. I was a parasite. I was a
Castiel glanced back to his older brother, who seemed hesitant to accept their Father's invitation. The seraph could understand why the archangel would have difficulty forgiving their Father for 'taking a step back,' as he called it. But against all odds, Gabriel actually stumbled forward to wrap his arms around God's vessel. Castiel stood by and watched the loving interaction with warmth in his own heart. He had waited to see such a sight for so long...
“Is – is that – ?!”
Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Oh boy. Oliver had probably taken a wrong turn or something and ended up lost among the stacks of mangled cars in the salvage yard. Sam reached up to pat his daughter's shoulder, wanting to give her some reassurance.
“Sorry, baby bunny,” Gabe said, reaching over to pat her back, “I promise I won't mention your dad's 'joystick' in front of you anymore.”
The twins seemed content to hear that answer. They loved seeing everyone get together. Just like Jude did. When the blue Impala pulled into the bunker garage, Jude and Clare were able to see that Jessica and Oliver arrived ahead of them. Jude’s cousin and best-friend-in-law were getting out of their truck, Jessica taking extra time because of her rounded stomach. She was on the third day of her second pregnancy and shining like a golden lamp. Jude smiled at Jess through the windshield as the car rolled to a stop, but she only smirked and shook her head at him.
After fleeing the presence of the Winchesters, the devil stood gawking at the scythe for several minutes, catching his breath in an abandoned warehouse. It was
“Hey! I said stop talking to him,” Dean barked again, shoving Gabriel back, “I don't want your annoying voice to be the first thing he hears! I mean, you know, if he can hear anything... Can he hear things, yet?”
Sam was suddenly walking away, so Castiel quickly followed him. Was it possible that Sam had been acquainted with him, as well?
“No Prime Ministers!” Sam called from across the room.
When the guy pointed at Dean and everyone's eyes shot to him, he tried his best to look calm and composed. But it was hard to do when he was drenched from head to toe and shaking violently from being dangled in midair. Luckily, his pitiful appearance seemed to finally snap Cas out of his rage. His bright glow dimmed and he blinked repeatedly at Dean with deep blue eyes. There was an apology raising up in his expression, but Dean preemptively shook his head to dismiss it. Cas didn't need to apologize for flying off like that. Hell, if Dean was able to fly, he would have gone straight for Jude too.
All of the boys bobbed their heads in unison too; even Ollie, who couldn't actually fly anywhere. Bobby nodded with them and gestured to the kitchen.
“Yeah. That’s right,” he smiled.
“Clare,” Jessie smiled back.
“Maybe. But she ain’t made of porcelain. It’s alright to handle her,” Bobby assured, “Go on and lift her up.”
Dean swallowed roughly, glancing at Cas with surprise. Oh, shit. Cas was using that voice again, the dominating tone that never failed to give Dean a hard-on. The angel looked absolutely fed up with the archangel's shit and Dean was glad to see it. Maybe Gabriel pissed off Cas just as much as he pissed off Dean...
Jude gulped. So the guy
“So, you’ve had sex?” he asked bluntly.
The dog next to them raised his head and perked his ears up when his name was spoken, making Jessica giggle in amusement. She let go of her bunny and blankie and hopped down to turn and face Dickie, who tilted his head back at her.
Dean only hummed and backed against Cas's hand, sliding himself further onto it. He was glad to know that Cas liked being inside of him just as much as Dean liked having him inside. The angel probed the man's ass for a second to loosen up the ring of muscle before adding another finger. Dean gripped the bed sheets tighter in his hands, loving the wave of tingles that inched up his back.
Morning came pretty fast. It felt like Jude had barely closed his eyes when Papa stopped by his bedroom to wake him up. Pop wished him a good morning and explained that Jane was on her way over with some of her family, who were going to stay in the bunker overnight. The news was kind of a surprise, but it didn't upset Jude nearly as much as Clare's absence did. Jude figured that the demon would have sneaked back into the bunker during the night, but he didn't. And Clare's disappearance made Jude curious. What in the world was his fiance doing? Did Bobby and Crowley have him running errands or something?
Just as Clare stepped over the threshold, something grabbed onto Jude's free hand. The angel gasped and turned around to see that Caldwell had reached as far as he could inside the trap to grab Jude's hand, keeping the boys in the room.
Before Dean could argue, Cas disappeared from the spot he was standing in and the bedroom door across the room closed. Dean glared at the knob for a second, pissed that he was being treated like a child. What if someone dangerous had followed them into the bunker? What if Cas got hurt – or worse,
“You always were slow to catch on,” he mused, nudging Castiel's side, “Do the clothes not make it obvious enough? No? Then, fine. I'll put it in a way you'll understand,” Gabriel cleared his throat before continuing, “Sam is to Gabriel, as Dean is to Cas.”
“Can we still check in this late at night?” he asked.
! The baby was there, fresh out of Jude’s womb, still covered in blood, screaming loud enough to fill the whole kitchen. Though his own arms felt numb, Clare curled them tighter around the naked little boy and tried to calm him down.
Before he answered, uncle Gabe raised his hand and let a small golden light shine from his palm. With the light, Jude could see lots of bars all around them; over their heads, below their feet, and at every side. It seemed like they were in a giant metal box inside a dark and empty building. The sight made Jude burrow himself deeper into his uncle's side and shiver with fear.
Clare thought that the muscles along Dean's jaws might pop at any second, because the guy was clenching his mouth so tight. His hands were even balled into fists as he watched Cas sigh and walk toward Meg. Once behind her, Cas attempted to calm his husband by giving him one of those, '
Gabriel instantly unwound his arms from Sam's neck to pick up their daughter.
"Me too," Sam replied to the phone, "Anyway, I'm really sorry for messing up your night with Jess... And I was wondering if maybe you would like to take her out on another date soon, since I ruined the first one."
At first, Jude only turned around slowly, as if he was taking in his surroundings. His face remained expressionless, though; eerily blank in the glow of the fire. When his head raised to look at Cas with those empty eyes, his feet started moving forward. The closer he moved to the fence of flames, the more Dean's heart thumped in his chest. No, he was getting so close to the fire! If he passed through, he could die!
“I read that it is normal for twins to be born prematurely, due to limited space in the womb. It’s likely what attributes to their small size,” Cas explained.
. That must have felt so weird and cool… An expression of delight rose on Jude’s face as he looked back to Clare.
“I love you,” Jude mumbled against the top of his Papa's shoulder.
The sound sent Dean's heart racing. Son of a bitch, Cas was
“To the most beautiful angel in the world,” he toasted, “and to our honeymoon, which has been pretty good so far... You know, other than almost getting ran over by a scooter on the sidewalk.”
As if on cue, uncle Bobby's three hellhound mutts came running in from the study to investigate the intruders. Peter, Willy, and Humphrey all seemed equal parts excited and confused to see the teenagers standing in the kitchen. But looking down at the happy dogs made Jessica feel like throwing up. How could they be so happy when something so horrible was happening?! The blonde girl swayed around a bit before backing up to fall into one of the kitchen chairs. She let out a tiny sob as her eyes refilled with warm tears. Oh, God, what if her parents were dead? What if that fog of darkness killed them? And all her uncles? Papa and Cas were graceless, now. They were human. And while she didn't know what the darkness was, Jessica knew in her heart that four humans couldn't stand a chance against it...
Dean looked to his brother, who was sitting across the table. Sammy had that ‘all knowing’ look on his face, like he had every ounce of confidence that the angels were okay and doing a great job.
Shit,
For a few seconds, Bobby was at a loss for words. His hat? That was it? That was the only thing Crowley wanted? No, that couldn't be right. This offer had 'bullshit' written all over it. There had to be some strings attached somewhere. Demonic deals always came with lots of strings. Especially Crowley's deals. The demon just stood there with a grin on his face, seeming pleased with himself.
“No,” Cas snapped, firmly shaking his head toward his frantic brother, “Our Father put that portal here as a permanent escape route for all humans. It appears whenever one is close by -”
! Ugh, this was happening
“I knew you would ask for that one, Jess,” he winked.
Bobby huffed a weary sigh and tilted his hat up a bit. Boy, there was no hiding the truth from a demon, was there? Crowley must have smelled his desperation from a hundred miles away...
” Gabriel rejoiced loudly.
"I sure did, honeydew. What a copy-cat," the archangel grumbled, "It's okay, though. I was the best looking Willy Wonka there, right moose?"
Jude smiled again – damn, he looked so good when he wore a smile – and blinked shyly up at Clare from under his long eyelashes.
It was a little strange seeing Ollie again. Jude hadn't seen or talked to him since the Halloween party, which felt like such a long time ago. Lots of things had happened since then and Jude wasn't sure how to start a conversation with his best friend. Should he talk about Clarence? Or Ollie and Jessie's ruined dance? Or the Harvest Festival date they went on? Luckily, it seemed like Ollie knew exactly where to start. As soon as he stepped into the bunker, his smile dimmed and he scanned the lower room to make sure that no one else was around.
Jude hoped that his words would be enough to at least make Clarence turn around. But the demon didn't move. He just sat there like a statue. Jude took a deep breath. Maybe he had to try something else.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean bit down a moan and closed his eyes for a second. Hearing Cas’s voice slip effortlessly into a different language did inhuman things to him. To encourage more Enochian speech, Dean hummed a little and quickly slipped his hand down to start wiggling Cas open. The angel hooked both arms around Dean’s neck in approval, meeting his mouth fully.
“Sorry to interrupt,” Michael began politely, carefully guiding Adam closer, “I just wanted Adam to meet his niece in person before the wedding started.”
Now that they were back in Bobby's house, Dean took a moment to breathe and look around. The first thing he noticed was that Clarence was free from the rug. Jessica had broken the symbol and let him out, and now he was pacing the floors with his hands on his head and tears in his eyes. Jane and Oliver Thompson were both huddled together at the kitchen table like a couple of terrified children. Gabriel was standing on his own now, having taken his grace back from Jess. His leg was healed and his face was clean, but pain was still written on his face. Sammy was lingering close to Gabe's side and casting suspicious glances at Lucifer, who was eying them both down from across the room. A crowd of familiar faces surrounded Dean, but Jude was gone. And for a second, Dean thought that he was dreaming. This couldn't actually be happening. Did he fall asleep in Purgatory? Was this a nightmare? This had to be a bad dream...
The man eased into a comfortable position with Castiel, laying on his back and snaking an arm around the angel next to him, before turning his sight toward the sky above.
Sam added on the last part just to make it clear that he wouldn't be repeating the awful mistake he made the night before. On the line, Oliver gave a squeaky, high-pitched laugh.
Dean and Jude both looked to the doorway, were Cas was standing silently. Neither of them knew how long the angel had been standing there, but judging by the wetness in Cas’s blue eyes, Dean figured it had been at least a few moments. With a wholesome expression, Cas walked over with open arms, wrapping Dean and Jude into a large group hug. Dean savored the moment, enjoying the mixture of Cas and Jude’s scents. It only stopped when Jude pulled back to cover a deep yawn.
Dean narrowed his eyes. Another one? What the hell did he mean? Another man? Another hunter?
"'Night, Jude," she said, "I'll see you in the morning."
The man reluctantly raised his head to look toward the direction the sound was coming from. For a brief moment, Dean was paranoid enough to think that Gabriel had been spying on them and wanted to ruin their moment by calling just to piss him off. But after listening to the phone ring again, Dean was convinced that it had to be Sam or Bobby. Because if Gabriel really wanted to ruin a moment, he would have done something a lot more drastic than a simple phone call.
“Daddy,” she whimpered, beautiful eyes filling up with tears, “D – Don't let them take me away!”
“Sorry, baby,” he muttered, “All we can do is hang on for the ride.”
“What is it?” he inquired.
!” Bobby begged, his voice cracking a little, “Why can't ya just
Dean could feel his heart picking up speed in his chest. Oh, no. He wasn't going to like where this conversation was going. Chuck must have seen the horror on Dean's face because he quickly backtracked.
As soon as the four of them were in a close cluster, Papa wrapped one arm around Dad's waist and the other around aunt Rowena's before flying out of the bunker. Jess already had her arms around his shoulders, so she was able to fly with them. Their small group landed on the sidewalk in front of Ms. Jane's store in Lebanon, where they were bathed in warm morning sunshine. Jessie blinked a few times to adjust her eyes to the bright light, but giggled when she caught sight of the store to her left. Lots of mannequins wearing dresses and suits were in the front windows, sweetly beckoning people in with stylish designs. Just seeing the shimmering fabrics made Jessie excited. She couldn't wait to try some dresses on!
“Are you sure this isn't too... You know... Homo?” he whispered, shifting around in Gabe's grasp.
“Agreed,” Singer nodded sagely, his sadness slowly being replaced with hopefulness, “I say we head back to my place and talk to Crowley about it first. He might be able to give us some advice.”
In response to her dad, Charlie started another string of ‘Da-da-da’s. The adorable sound made smile return to both of her parents’ faces. Jess and Ollie both admired their baby for a moment before looking back to each other. Jess couldn’t deny that everything Oliver said was true. She was going to have to face the fact that they couldn’t live in the bunker forever… but maybe not right away.
“Here,” Jude panted, breaking the otters' paws apart so that he could hold one out to Clarence, “S – Something to put in your new room when you get home.”
Though he seemed surprised to see Grandpa Chuck standing right in front of him, Clarence didn't move a muscle. He only blinked toward Jude's grandpa in wonder.
“Whoa,” Ollie breathed, “What time is it here?”
“You want to name our son Gibson?” he clarified.
“Yeah, I guess it is,” Ollie nodded.
' :) I know that doesn't have anything to do with Destiel, but I thought I would share. :) Thank you so much for reading!
“I always do,” Clarence replied with a tiny wink.
“We’re out of time, Dean. We must go,” Cas said.
“I'm sure Papa called ahead and made arrangements,” Jess sighed with a smile, “Come on. He told me the hotel was nearby.”
“Cas is right. I've seen way crazier spell ingredients than that,” Dean agreed, “What we really need to focus on is the sigil.”
The Winchesters were suddenly facing a giant indoor water slide.
Papa paused to look at the lady on the computer and smiled again.
Cas paused and Dean could tell that the angel was holding back his emotions. He continued to face the wall as he spoke, as if it was too painful to look at Dean.
Sam closed the motel door at his back, sealing the hunters away from everyone else. Once they were alone with Bobby, Dean shrugged his shoulders and gave the old man a questioning look.
. It’s
"H - hey, Jess," he said as softly as possible.
Jude gulped down the taste of watermelon and cradled his own warm stomach. Even though he felt like exploding with panic, Jude forced himself to take slower breaths. The last thing he wanted was to put his children in harms way. If staying calm would help keep them calm, he would do whatever it took.
“Oh,” the angel realized, “It was fairly simple, actually. Dean's semen entered my grace during anal intercourse, resulting in the creation of our offspring -”
“Well... I've gotta hand it to my baby rabbit,” Gabe sighed as he blinked down at the warlock's corpse, nudging the dead guy's arm with his foot, “She really knows how to make someone dead.”
' He knew he needed to put it in a way that wasn't so obvious. Maybe mask it with a personal question.
For millenniums, Castiel had pondered his own worth. He struggled to discover what his purpose was; the reason why his father had created him and the duty he was destined to carry out. And when he rescued Dean Winchester, Castiel assumed that he had found the answer. He thought that his purpose was to be with
Sam vehemently rolled his eyes and dug a huge hand into his popcorn, but left his crotch open for the taking. Gabe briefly rubbed his hands together before unbuckling the rest of Sam's belt and carefully reaching in to pull out his cock. Sam's dick was massive; a literal moose cock, even when it was soft. But after all the sex they'd had over fifteen years, Gabriel was used to its huge size. He brought his mouth to the precious member as soon as he laid eyes on it, kissing it 'hello' and giving it a few tugs. Gabe's actions were rewarded with a few low grunts from above.
“Can't you
Jude's heart leaped into his throat. What?! That was
“What?” the demon eventually spat.
“But I don't want to hurt you,” Ollie insisted, “I want to make you feel good.”
“Until you can learn to control yourself, young man, you're gonna wear a leash like a normal house pet,” Papa ordered.
“’Night, Clare. I love you,” the angel hummed, closing his eyes.
“You like Nirvana?” Clare asked.
Jude nodded.
Chills raced across Sam's body. Anything? A million different scenarios involving a desperate child and an manipulative adult seemed to flash through Sam's mind. And every single one made him feel sick...
“Him,” Jude said, using his finger to point, “That glowy one.”
“Hey, Cas. How are you feeling?” Sam asked.
suit. Jude had never seen him in a suit before, not even at Ollie's graduation. And,
“So, somebody's gotta cut themselves open?” Dean assumed.
“Well. If it isn't Mrs. Dean Winchester himself,” Meg hummed, her voice sporting the same sarcastic tone that Castiel remembered from the past, “Did you bring a board game with you?”
“Anyway,” the man mumbled, trying to get back on track, “I didn't call you here to chit-chat about nonsense. I called you to make a deal.”
But as soon as he came back to his senses, Jude panted and blinked toward the ceiling. His first thought was of what just happened. Clare had slipped back out of his body and was now leaning on his left side, looking down at Jude's glowing body in awe. Jude carefully stuffed his grace back into his body, making the room go slightly darker again. And after it was gone, he sat up a little and held his hand back to his stomach.
Castiel reached forward to pick up the cool jar of honey, watching the amber goo slowly slide along the glass. Staring at the perfect hexagon tubes made the angel feel strangely better all of the sudden. Maybe dying for someone else wasn't such a terrible thing. Giving Dean a son was an honorable act and one that Castiel felt humbled to be a part of. Besides, he was more afraid of leaving Dean alone than he was of death itself.
” Crowley snapped.
“Nuh-uh, Jessie. It's scary,” Jude disagreed, burying himself inside Cas's coat to hug the angel's thigh.
“Oh? Do tell,” he encouraged.
“Alright, scroll-keeper,” Dean mumbled condescendingly, “What
“Some
“He's... he's perfect, Cas,” Dean whispered.
At once, every person in the kitchen glanced among each other in concern before following Adam out of the room. He led the silent group down the corridor and into the TV room adjacent to the study, where the large screen was tuned into the national news. Jude filed into the room behind his parents, feeling Clare’s hands on his shoulders as they both peered around to see what was happening. Several clips of raging fires flashed across the screen, each more devastating than the next. And over it all, a news reporter’s calm voice spoke.
Though he felt like running to the bathroom, Clare lingered in place and held out his hand. Rowena reached out with a fresh needle and poked the tip of his middle finger – and the sharp flash of pain that shot through his body made Clare gasp in shock.
“Well, this morning, it felt like I had to puke,” she explained, “but nothing came out. I just felt really sick to my stomach. Then, when we ate dinner, I really
The baby didn't reply to Dean's voice. He only gripped the man's finger a little tighter and stared up at him with eyes that resembled Cas's. Oh, God, Dean was never going to be able to resist those beautiful eyes. Dean raised his head to look at Cas, feeling like the happiest man on earth. Cas smiled back as best he could while he held pressure against his own wound. The angel was crying too, making his pale face glisten with tears.
“Keep trying, Dickster,” Dean encouraged as he passed by.
Staring into Cas's blue eyes somehow reminded Dean of his conversation with Bobby and how much it meant to hear the old man's wisdom. Man, Bobby really deserved some credit for being such a good dad. And maybe Dean could do it by passing on the old man's name to his son...
“He means push,” Jess explained.
After he gathered his thoughts, Sam knew that he needed to share them. The only problem was getting Oliver to listen and take it to heart. Why would the kid want to listen to Sam now, after everything he'd done?
“I have no idea,” the guy huffed, fingers shaking around Sam's arm, “Maybe to save us for later? Torture us? Kill us slowly? Who knows how ancient cosmic beings work...”
The broom in Sam’s hand came to a complete stop as he raised his head to give the kid a flat look.
“Y – you and Meg? You guys are – are together or something? She’s your – your queen?” Dean stammered, still blindsided by the thought.
“Wow... You had my baby,” he almost whispered between panting breaths.
The smile on Sam's face grew as he watched Gabriel rip the tube out of his hand and snap his own fingers together. The rest of their clothes vanished with the use of his grace, leaving them both naked on top of the plaid comforter. Sam's dick was almost standing at a full erection, but it looked like Gabe was still working on his. The archangel's cock was bobbing above Sam's stomach, flicking around like it wanted attention. And of course, Sam couldn't help but give in to it. He kept glancing between the moving dick and Gabe's face, waiting to see what the guy planned to do.
The person on Bobby's doorstep was Clarence's birth mother.
Dean and Sam slowly took their seats across from Bobby and watched him open up the cooler to dig around inside. The old man pulled out a cold glass of beer and snapped the cap off before taking a large swig. Afterward, he crossed his arms and glanced between the Winchesters and the angels.
“I hope you guys have fun,” he smiled, “Just remember to use protection, alright?”
“Grace?” Adam spoke up, sounding intrigued.
From the moment he heard the word 'faggot,' Jude wasn't in control of his own body. His grace appeared on its own, lighting up his skin and eyes with an electric shade of blueish-white, and he immediately spun around to deliver a vicious right hook to Clarence's face. It wasn't until he heard and felt the
“H – hey, guys,” Ollie offered, finally breaking the silence and raking a hand through his wild orange hair, “I'm glad you made it back.”
“We're coming,” Sam assured, reaching up to shut the trunk.
Sam opened his mouth to add something about reapers taking each others' places as Death, when his phone started ringing. He shifted around to grab the cell out of his pocket and held it up to see who was calling. Oliver Thompson's name was on the screen, but instead of feeling annoyed as usual that he was calling, Sam felt kind of eager. He actually wanted to know how the kid was doing now that they were all back home. Sam swiped the answer button and held the phone to his ear.
Clare slowly nodded his head, but his eyes grew suspicious. Jude's fiance was clearly unconvinced. Still, he didn't pressure Jessica to talk. He just stuck his hands in his pockets and looked around the parking lot.
“Who gives a shit about the freaking world?!” Clarence interrupted, voice high and angry.
“Oh well. It still had pigs and wolves. Good enough,” uncle Gabe shrugged, “Now, which story should we tell next?”
“Perhaps Bobby is in need of comfort, Dean,” Cas suggested, sounding hopeful.
” Daddy yelled, crawling as fast as he could across the ground, “
“C – cut?” Ollie squeaked.
die. Is this Heaven or something?”
” Sam gasped in surprise.
“I – I don't know what's wrong with me,” she admitted.
Papa only laughed and nodded, getting up from the bed to go over and explain the whole story to Dad. In the meantime, Jessica's attention was diverted to the person who entered the room next – and a gust of relief swept through her soul. The bright orange hair was a dead give away. Ollie was back! But he looked a little drained. It was like he had just run a marathon and was now tuckered out – only, instead of smelling like sweat, he smelled like alcohol.
“What do you think, Cas?” he muttered.
“Gabe, stop it. This is serious,” Sam grumbled.
“Oh, lighten up, Mike. He'll be fine,” Clare promised, waving a hand toward Adam, “We'll just move him to my house and -”
“Don’t worry, kid. I’ll give you a kick-ass name,” the demon promised, “And I’m sure Papa Jude will give you a sweet name too, little girl. You guys are in good hands.”
“I’m okay, little man. I promise,” he assured.
After they finished their drinks, Dean, Sam, and their angels walked Bobby back to his hotel room. The guy was as drunk as a skunk, stumbling around like a newborn giraffe, but Dean made sure the old man made it safely to his bed. Once Bobby was taken care of, Dean made a point to give his little brother a hug; holding the guy in a brotherly embrace for at least a few seconds. Seeing him die –
“Ah-ah-ah,” Asmodeus said, tightening his hold on Sam’s neck and making him squeak, “If you try to kill me, I’m takin’ this young’in with me…”

“Actually, Clare,” Jude muttered, his cheeks burning red again, “I was hoping that... that
Cas was overwhelmingly grateful that his husband was finally sleeping, but he was still worried about Dean's well being. Castiel had no idea if the spell was truly finished working its lustful magic. Dean still had a fairly large, reddened, throbbing, and very much overused erection, which seemed like a bad sign. The only person who would know if Dean was truly alright was the person that had crafted the spell. Castiel needed to ask Gabriel if the effects had worn off, preferably before Dean woke up and felt the need to penetrate Cas again.
“Look, you pathetic bastard. This is the last time I’m going over this with you, so pay attention,” the second voice snapped. “We’re gonna take this ‘Dean’ thing to the inferno room and burn that tattoo. Then, one of us is gonna possess his meatsuit and hide in that room full of junk. And as soon as we’ve got the king alone,” A loud whack came from somewhere nearby, which sounded like metal hitting stone. “… we kill him. And finally take this place back.”
Dean and Cas finally made it to the car, where the man gently unhooked their pinky fingers in order to pop the trunk and put everyone's luggage away. Dean caught sight of Cas gingerly placing the leather case – the case that contained their new chrome toy – near the back. Off to the side, Bobby was suddenly trying to fight his way out of Sam and Gabriel's grip.
When Castiel reentered the bedroom, he found Dean talking on his cell phone. The man had put the call on speaker while he walked around the room to get his own clothes. For a moment, Castiel was taken once more by the sight of Dean in nothing but his underwear. The tight dark fabric accentuated his thick thighs and waist, making his backside look extra inviting. The angel firmly closed their bedroom door behind him when he entered, wanting to keep the lovely sight all to himself.
“Well, we didn't exactly 'chip in.' It kinda came with the bunker,” Sam casually mentioned.
“I will always watch over you, Dean,” the angel promised in a whisper.
The little girl's sweet voice seemed to calm Gabriel and Sam's heated discussion. Both adults took breaths and averted their eyes to their daughter, where they saw her curious expression staring back at them. Sam was the first to clear his throat.
“I'll go get you a drink,” he offered to Meg.
"You're different than I thought you'd be," Clarence hissed behind him, sounding disappointed, "You're too soft... Just an innocent kid... I guess you have your faggot parents to thank for that - "
“Yes,” Cas answered for Jude, looking so proud, “Life is being created in Jude’s grace as we speak. I felt it with my own.”
“We love you too, Cas,” he muttered, after which a touch of playfulness sparked in his eyes, “Now, how about we get back to our 'date'?”
Sam stifled a small chuckle. Wow. Ollie was taking this thing way too seriously...
Dean barely had time to turn around and see the person before they reached out to touch both Winchesters on the forehead. Dean blacked out instantly.
The ridiculous appearance of her handsome fiance mixed with the very concerned delivery of his question made her laugh out loud. She finally understood what Ollie was doing. He was trying to get her to laugh on purpose; to make her feel better, even though he didn't know why she was upset. Wanting to play along with his silly charade, Jess scooped up some purple bubbles and wiped them across her own face as well. The two of them sat with bubble beards in the tub, facing each other with smiles.
Jess chuckled a little.
– that everything is gonna be okay. (You know Gabe would never let anyone get away with hurting his moose.) Thank you all so, so much for continuing to read this story, even though it's so angsty. I love you all! :)
“What in the hell happened out there?”
Oliver’s argument briefly got caught in his throat as he eyed her in surprise. He curled Charlie closer in his arms and struggled for words for a second, blinking at his wife with his mouth open, looking like an excited fish. Then he gulped and glanced away with a blush.
Jude watched their interaction with a smile of his own, seeing Adam look down at their joined hands with studious eyes. The guy raised his head to look at Michael's face again afterward, this time with an expression of realization.
No sound came from inside and the door stayed shut, separating Dean from his child like a cold barrier. Again, Dean knocked on the door and sighed.
“The vampire is feeding on elderly women from nursing homes,” he informed, “and I think we can catch him if we monitor one of the buildings.”
“What did he look like?” Jessica asked, probably assuming that he was the same guy they were after.
The moment he mentioned her name, Meg turned to look toward the table – and Dean spewed his alcohol everywhere. Michael, Adam, Cas, and Gabriel all ducked away to avoid being covered in the fermented mist. After the commotion at the table, a few of the guys stood up to brush the liquid off their shirts and they noticed the rest of the people in the kitchen too. The two groups paused to stare at each other in silence for a minute, each confused to see the other. Rowena eventually walked toward the table and Sam could see that there was fire in her eyes.
Jude's heart thumped hard in his chest the whole way to the laundry room. He could barely see over top of his wet, bloody sheets, but he wandered in the general direction anyway, too lost in thought to care about running into walls. Part of him was so mad at Clarence for saying that awful word; for getting Jude mad and making him punch him in the face. But at the same time, Jude was also shocked and impressed with his own abilities. He had no idea that he could hit someone so powerfully; that he had
Jude's mouth had run completely dry, but Clare's mouth was able to restore some moisture. Their lips collided in a firm but caressing way; tongues slowly inching out to meet. The spicy, heated flavor of the potion was still lingering in Clare's mouth and it tasted so good. Jude closed his eyes and let himself get lost in the sensation of his boyfriend's kiss and felt Clare's hands tugging up his shirt. Jude willingly started helping discard his own clothes. Even though his heart was beating fast with anxious arousal, his face was blazing hot, and his hands were shaking, Jude wanted to keep going. He had waited for this moment for a very long time and was eager to show Clarence how much he loved him...
“Yes,” Cas agreed, pointing toward a set of trees nearby, “I remember seeing it on this ridge.”
“Shit,” Dean breathed, letting go of Cas to look down at his own hands in embarrassment, “I – I’m sorry, man. I… just had a really bad dream –”
“I – I'm so happy!” he cried, “My babies! You're all grown up and married, now!
As two of them – and Dickie – made their way through the map room to get to the rest of the bunker, they could hear small giggles and the voices of their brothers. It sounded like Dean and Cas had both kids rallied in the study, doing some kind of activity. Dickie bounded out in front of his owners to investigate the scene, leaving Sam and Gabe to wander in behind him.
The rest of their group glanced at Clarence in the dim light, all sharing the same look. How could Clare be so calm right now when the world was falling apart? Jude gulped, realizing that it was probably because Clare was used to it...
Dean huffed a breath of aggravation, seeming distressed by the lack of answers.
The Winchesters all piled into the Impala, looking like some kind of weird carnival side-show because of the costumes they were wearing. Uncle Sam's big antlers kept bonking people in the head by accident, after which he said long strings of '
“Focus on what, Dearie?”
Dean glanced proudly along Castiel's astounded expression before lowering his head to join their lips. The angel kissed him with as much affection as possible, reaching up to hold him close. Castiel was considered to be part of Dean's family; not just

Because he was going to have to marry Clarence some day...
Jessica blinked up at her papa with large eyes, soaking in his every word and action. Sam stayed silent as Gabriel went on, waiting to see exactly how the archangel would explain this topic.
Sam wandered back into the study with his little girl but hesitated at the entrance. Dean and Cas were sitting at a table to themselves, clinging to each other and whispering like they were trying to hold all of their broken pieces together. Crowley and Rowena were leafing through a few open books on a different table, quietly mumbling to each other about spells, witchcraft, and demons. But Bobby was walking over to meet Sam with an aged look on his face. Peter, Willy, and Humphrey all followed their owner and paused to sniff Dickie when they were close enough. But Dickie didn't seem interested in his hellish offspring. The older dog just sank down to lay on the floor in defeat, which made his pups whimper in confusion.
“He'll tell us when he's ready,” Dean predicted, “In the meantime, our kids have some eggs to find.”
“Thanks for taking me to get my nails done, Ms. Jane,” Jessie said, lifting her head to look at the pretty lady next to her.
"I don't approve of that demon-child being in the bunker," Cas stated flatly.
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean cried out, close to orgasm already, “You feel so good.”
“It's probably no big deal,” Sam replied casually, hoping to ease Gabe's mind.
! Why did Ollie have magazines with naked ladies on them?!
“Oh, no,” he breathed, sounding so frightened.
“I’m going to make the incision,” Papa announced.
Jessica nodded and hugged her stuffed bunny close to her cheek. Dickie was draped over her stomach in a protective and comforting manner, which only affirmed Sam's worry.
Sam let out a hollow laugh, high-pitched and full of dread. Surprise party? Yeah, it was a real surprise alright...
Jude brought up Clare because he was the only thing that Jude really had in common with Meg. Though, Meg didn’t seem to mind. She only nodded again and glanced toward Clare, who was helping Rowena reach a cup out of the cabinet.

,' wanting to keep his boyfriend as calm and comfortable as possible. He had no idea why Clarence suddenly wanted to tell Jude all about his past. Maybe it was the courage potion that he drank earlier or something. But he didn't have to keep going. Jude only wanted him to be happy, not upset. How could Jude make him happy again? Were there any parts of his past that were happy?
Sam was, of course, still camped out in front of Jessica's closed door. At this point, the guy slightly resembled someone who had just been bitten by a zombie; as if a disease was slowly taking over. His face was pale and weary, eyes were red with dark circles, lips were chapped, and the wrinkles on his forehead were deep where he had been frowning so much. Dean actually felt pretty bad for his little brother, seeing him sit on the floor with his legs crossed and head resting in his hands. His ass was probably killing him.
“Dean,” the angel whispered to himself, shaking his head, “Please hurry...”
After the tender exchange, the king took Dean’s hand and held it out toward his double. Cas, who still held Dean by the waist, gently took Dean’s hand when it was offered to him and gave the king an understanding look.
Jude was the defective one. He always had been. And always would be.
,” Dean purred, “It sounds like you need
“Hey, baby bunny,” Sam whispered, reaching out to brush some of the blonde hair out of Jess's pretty face to see her properly, “Are you okay?”
“Where the hell have you been?” Bobby huffed, feeling rage trying to get the best of him, “These boys have been looking for you since they were little kids and now -”
“I've been to the dock and it's completely empty. But from the looks of it, this place is crawlin' with demons,” Bobby sighed, not even bothering to say hello, “I know our policy is to kill on sight, but I reckon we should try catchin' a demon and talkin' to it. Maybe interrogate our way to the location of that 'devil' fella.”
“I like this story!” Jessie smiled.
Jude gulped. Whoa, Clare wanted to do it? He wanted to have sex? Right now? In the middle of the day? It was really unlike him to want to have sex on a whim. But Jude couldn't deny him. He looked so desperate and
” Papa exclaimed, looking equal parts excited and terrified, “Oh my Dad, okay! Okay, okay, okay, okay! Be calm! Stay calm!”
While Bobby embraced the kids, Dean caught sight of the dogs on the floor. The three hell hounds found their father's basket, but Dickie obviously had no intention of sharing the goodies inside. The Jack Russell gave his canine sons a tiny growl before grabbing the basket handle in his mouth and dashing away with it. Peter, Willy, and Humphrey all chased their dad out of the room with wagging tails, seeming determined to steal his stuff.
Clarence seemed to accept Jude's reply. The demon guy sighed a bit and started scratching his arms again, which made Jude feel worse. He wished that there was more that he could say to encourage Clarence.
“B – Billie?” Papa asked, “What the hell happened to you?!”
Jude gulped and turned to look up at Clare, feeling like he was on the verge of panicking. Oh, God! The Darkness was coming again! Where were they going to go? What were they going to do? How could they run away from something that could surround them in seconds?!
The angel leaned over to plant an affectionate kiss on his child's forehead before standing up and venturing back toward his and Dean's bed. Since Oliver was asleep, Castiel saw no problem with dressing for bed in the main part of the room. He quickly and discretely pulled the damp black T-shirt up over his head and straightened it out to study the rainbow words written on the front. It was very nice of Gabriel to make everyone a keepsake from this family trip. Castiel would cherish it forever...
