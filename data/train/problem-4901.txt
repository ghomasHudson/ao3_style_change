“I know, I...I’m sorry, Tony, I can’t,” Steve said dejectedly before biting his lower lip. The sorry sight made Tony’s heart pump painfully and the smaller man loosened his stance and closed the distance between himself and the captain.
“Yeah and I’m a superhero. Nice try,” Tony retorted, keeping his guard up. The captain paused and then slowly lowered his shield to the ground and raised his hands in the universal sign of surrender.
Steve blinked, moving his singular gaze from Tony to Bucky, who was staring hard at him from the chair beside the hospital bed. “Right, sorry about that.” He’s had a hard time focusing on anything besides the man tucked under his arm since the attack. Since he didn’t have any plans to move out of Tony’s weak grasp, he needed to rely on his friends to take care of a few things.
Tony sprung forward so quickly that he almost tripped over his own two feet. He knelt by the bed and opened up his laptop, just to confirm that it wasn’t some kind of trick. A yellow sticky note stared up at him from the keys.
Eyes still closed, his fingertips dug more insistent into his temples, slightly relieving the pressure that had built up. It wasn’t enough though. Tony needed some caffeine in his system if he had any hope of making it through the day without tearing the heads off of one of his students for so much as
His lawyer, Matt Murdock, had informed him the next day at the reading of the will that Howard and Maria had managed to update their will
He stood up and walked over to Tony, shooing away the scissors so that he could run a hand through Tony’s new cut. “I went into hiding, and that’s where Steve found me. I guess the Avengers had gotten a tip from their friends in the government.”
“Fear will go a long way in this business, son.” He agreed before his face grew more serious. “This job will take over who you are, so you’ll have to decide the kind of leader you want to be, you’ll have to figure out how to control the chaos that lies within.”
“Is…something wrong?” Steve finally asked. The hesitant tone was nothing but sweet, but Tony was irritated to death by it.
Tony’s breath hitched as he was flopped down in front of the dash. Had the situation been different, he would certainly have raved over the technology of Star-lord’s ship. Today, it barely registered in his brain. His eyes were focused on the approaching planet he called home, looking awfully frail in the vast expense of the galaxy. For all he knew, he could be the only one left. Pepper, Rhodes, Happy, Bruce, Fury, his old team could have all evaporated like Peter did. Cap also could be gone. The thought jerked his worn out heart violently. Out of reflex, he clutched his empty left pocket where he stored that goddamn excuse of a phone for two years.
“No, thank you. It’ll go to waste on me.” Steve paused and continued, uncertain. “You should probably put the breaks on that though.”
“Oh Tony, I was looking for you.” And there was the reason. Usually, Tony would have been thrilled by the attention but today, he was irritated by it.
“I want us to have a home...I want us to have…that,” Steve finished pitifully as he pointed meekly at the painfully pure sight in front of them. The soldier sighed before burying his face in the crook of the other man’s neck. Tony's shoulders sank and bit before he replied.
“Nothing, Steve.” The tension in Steve’s jaw sent alarms flaring in his head. Tony was starting to forget why he didn’t want to talk in the first place. They had barely started dating, the beginning having been all but easy and fun. Steve, bless his soul, had just integrated a new century where, apparently, being into guys was not punishable by death. Now, barely a month later, they were somehow dating. Kind of. It started with a drunken kiss his par, and then Tony avoiding Steve like the plague, damaging the team’s performance for a long week before they talked and worked it out. Jan might have helped. A lot. God, did she help. Tony thought the hardship was behind them but now, they were in a dispute and he had no idea how they got here or what they were fighting about. Well, in the pit of his stomach, he knew what was wrong. But, like a stubborn child, he wasn’t going to tell it to Steve.
. I wasn't satisfied with the second chapter so forever_jimin helped me rework it. I hope you guys like the new version and feel free to let me know what you think.
The symptoms mysteriously dissipated the next morning and the renewed energy gave Tony an uncontrollable urge to cause trouble. After a cup of coffee, he was feeling vengeful and sent drones down to mid-town where he previously got his butt kicked. The streets were usually pretty quiet on Sundays so with some luck there would be no civilians around. He didn’t want the Squadron to be distracted by a spontaneous rescue mission. Tony took his time slipping on a fresh under armor and walked onto the suit’s assembly platform. His drone attack was live one of his projectors and, as of now, they were barely holding off. Albeit a bit annoying, it didn’t matter much; it just meant he wasn’t going to miss the party.
“You okay there, soldier?” Tony had to force his expression to be neutral since his faceplate went off to god knows where during the whole gamma shebang.
As his vibrant armour pod came into sight, Tony got up to his feet, grunting as his used armour whined and rattled and pulled the manual eject of the suit. The pieces of metal peeled off his body, some damaged parts scattering messily on the dusty ground around him. Upon observation, his under armour was also quite damaged. The body tight suit was now stretched and ripped at multiple places and sagged against his frame like an old cloth. Tony could feel Steve’s scanning gaze upon him and tried in vain to hide the more compromising rips as he fought back a blush. As the telltale whine of the pod got more pronounced, Steve finally got the memo and took a couple steps back as the armour pod arrived and landed gracefully. Tony let it scan his biometrics and, at last, a fresh suit of armour started to wrap around his body.
Tony shifted, noticing Steve's hiss of pain even as his head throbbed.  "You're hurt," Tony said, trying to move off Steve.  His head ached, but at worst it was a concussion and he'd worked through those before.  If Steve was hurt, he had to be proactive or Steve would try to do everything himself.
He asked Williams to wait at the perimeter and walked to stand beside Tony.  "Is that...?" he asked, not quite able to vocalize the question.
enjoy listening. Tony's voice was animated and rich when he was talking about something he was excited about. He hadn't wanted Tony to
warned him off.  He probably should have tried again later, or at least waited until Tony was comfortable talking.  He sighed, figuring Tony's apologies would probably work so long as Steve himself owed them.  Considering his own human nature, that might be unlikely.  "Sorry," he said contritely, hugging Tony a little tighter.  Neither of them were very good at this, it seemed.
He moved down and barrel-rolled across Steve's wing tips, his heart pounding with added adrenaline.  The pump was over-working again, but he didn't care.  He flew straight at Steve, whooping as they both turned at the last second to miss each other.  They flew in circles a few more times before landing, Steve gracefully, and Tony with a clunk.
"The record did not say what happened after.  It stopped when the spell was cast.  It is likely none of the dragons survived," Wanda replied.  "But the hydra will sleep, that much is certain.  And the ones who left the city will be safe."
But he wasn't alone.  He had Tony and the others, and as long as they were happy, Steve himself had a home.  That was enough to fill up the chasm even if Tony didn't love him back in the same way.  He still loved Steve as a friend.
It was dark now, the crystal on his wrist long since gone dead.  He knew vaguely that he should be hungry and that thirst would kill him before that.  He felt numb though, only the cold seeping through his bones reminding him he couldn't follow Steve yet.  He couldn't even feel Steve beneath him anymore, his fingers thick and ungainly as he groped blindly for Steve's horns.  He couldn't find them.
They were working on things in their own way, and there were always snags, but Steve counted himself the luckiest hologram alive as he kissed Tony's temple, rubbing soothing circles into his back.  They could only watch from afar right now, but Steve was confident the kids would be okay.
Steve didn't look happy, but he let go of Tony's wrist.  Tony stood and moved off of Steve, regretting it immediately.  Steve had been warmer than the cold air.  He called the armor, but after a minute of waiting and still no response, he quickly got back under the parachute.
Steve nodded, pushing away the disappointment.  "Could you tell him I'd like to speak with him if he's up for a break sometime?"
Steve mentally shook himself, then draped an arm around Tony's shoulders.  Tony tensed as Steve started to lead him out.  He relaxed slowly, and Steve put it down to being surprised.  Steve let out a small breath, glad he hadn't overstepped.  Tony could be a hit or a miss when it came to his personal space sometimes, as Steve had learned over the past few days.
"You never talk this much," Tony said finally, glad there was only a slight note of hysteria to his voice.
"Only when I don't have my notebook," Steve said sheepishly. "It's a bit bulky to carry around, so I don't always bring it. Plus it'd be kind of rude to just start drawing when I'm supposed to be listening... overtly, anyway."
money.  Because the board needs to be that much richer.  Never mind morals or my reasons for stopping," he said, leaning his head against the table as anger slipped into his voice.
"I..." Steve replied, uncertain how to respond.  Meeting the mother of Tony's best friend would be strange.
like it hadn't since before the War.  That was bad.  So was the aching in his ribs and the intense pain in his left leg, but his chest was currently the most worrisome.
to it.  I remember my life before I was a dragon too.  It's just such a jumble right now that it's hard to remember which is which."
"And then I can show you the stars.  The real ones, not just the memories in my head," Tony promised.  "A proper sky out in the country where you can actually see without the smoke."
"If you insist," Stark said with a very put-upon sigh.  "But when you finish your degree, you will be getting a raise."
It glowed softly, giving off a faint light that Tony could only just make out. He couldn't believe it.   "You went to get it back," Tony said.  He turned the crystal in his hands as his throat pinched strangely.  He swallowed hard.  "Steve, those caves were freezing!  Why did you go back there?"
"Thank you," Steve replied, absently sorting through his schedule to see when he'd be free to visit the Tower.
"Kids these days.  No appreciation of the classics," Tony muttered, letting her pull away.  "Now, tell Grampa Tony what's wrong."
Steve struggled to stand, bleeding onto the cold ground.  The dragon name-feeling - Silver, red, and black.  Radiating warmth like the pits of lava in the middle of the dragon house, comfort and protection of the forest.  The darkness of a crystal-less night, dancing, and salty wit.  It resonated in the cavern like a scream.
"The hydra will not leave these grounds.  I will make sure of it," Wanda promised darkly.  "I searched the mural for how they were put to sleep the first time.  There is old magic there.  It will work a second time, and it will be safe again."
"The frequency to find Steve in the time vortex is through his shield," Tony continued.  "I've attached that and as much information on Kang as we could find.  The video of my fight and transcripts of the other fights are all there too, so have fun analyzing how we all screw up.  Mostly, this is all just to save time if you fail.  Give us less time to make things worse, like we always do.  I wish there was more advice I could give you, but every time line has been so different that it's hard to tell where-"
"I meant..."  Steve hesitated, but it seemed like Tony was going to make him say it.  "Take your helmet off.  Please?"
"I..." Tony said, wincing as he coughed again.  There was liquid in his throat.  He was sure that wasn't a good sign.
"Why?" Steve asked, feeling way out of his depth.  "I can understand that Howard could be a sore topic, but why would he start a fight and push me away?"
"I suppose he's pretty enough for a human," Steve said.  "But I still question your choice in partners, Sam."
As Steve cleared everything away on the tray, he was already forgotten by Tony who was muttering and toying with holograms as he finished the last of his sandwich.  He looked a little goofy like that, gracefully changing the projections with one hand and stuffing his mouth with the other, only pausing to call out orders to JARVIS.  Steve smiled, wondering how many people got to see Tony like this, lost in equations and his own brilliant inventions.  Tony's brown eyes flickered over the numbers and the light reflected back in them, making them almost glow.  It made Steve's fingers twitch for his art pad, though he doubted he could recreate the colors even on a tablet.  He felt a fondness that...
Susan winced as the shield wavered.  "85% and holding," Tony said.  "Let's take them out before they get another hit like that."
The knock at his door sent jolts of pain through his abused brain; he could hear the door creaking open and Steve realized he hadn't closed it properly.  He looked up to glare at whoever interrupted, then ignored his nausea to stand as he saw who was at his door.  "Ms. Potts!  I wasn't - I mean -"
The sergeant escorted him up to the third floor and a nurse pointed him the rest of the way.  He opened the door cautiously, stepping in to see a black man lying on the bed.  He was bandaged up and had all sorts of machines hooked up to him that Steve didn't need to know their purpose to guess it was serious.  He swallowed and sent a quick prayer for his recovery.
"His wounds are healing," Ms. Potts said, carrying a tray with two mugs and a cup of juice.  She held out one mug to Steve.  "I asked JARVIS how you liked your coffee."
Steve eyed the bottle of whiskey.  It was about half full, but he had no doubt it was powerful enough to do the trick.  It was the absolute last thing Steve needed.  His stomach wouldn't thank him, but his nerves would.  He didn't drink very often, not when he was supposed to be the model of the law for a lawless crowd, but he could feel the pull of the bottle.  It'd stop the memories from rushing around in his head, even if just for a little while.  That was a dangerous sort of thought around these parts.
"I know," Steve said, sending Tony the affection he craved.  It was growing weaker, but still there.
Sure enough, Peggy and Sharon started a soft humming with wordless thoughts that Tony couldn't quite translate, but he could feel.  The melody was earthy and deep, beautiful in ways that made Tony long for a proper dance partner.  One that he could hold on to while the band played real slow, with a heady perfume that was sealed with a kiss.  Wistful, almost, like the one that got away.
"Captain, there hasn't been a time when Stark wasn't a problem," Fury said, pointedly looking down at the tray.  "And I hear that you've been trying to get close to him."
"Come out, Mr. Stark.  You won't get very far, not without your armor."  That wasn't the leader of the Ten Rings.  The voice was different.  Wrong.  That was...  Tony shook his head, trying to clear it.  Whoever it was, they were right.  He needed his suit.
Tony didn't have to be told twice.  Steve was the one holding his head, his tail curling possessively around Tony's feet.  After actually drinking some of the water, Tony tried to sit up.  His vision started to tunnel grey when he did and he leaned back against Steve.  "The hydra-"
Before Steve could say anything, either to confirm it was a date or to berate Tony, his phone beeped again.  Tony absently opened the message and to Steve's great shock, this time there was a faint blush on
"Sounds great, Suzie," Leo said, earning him a scowl.  "Still hate that name?  You haven't changed."
"I'm..."  Leon said, keeping his eyes on the floor.  He should be better than this, but he couldn't bring himself to say anything more.
, but I wasn't.  I came home with black eyes and got another for it because I wasn't some steroid-buffed idiot."
"You're supposed to be War Machine, not some handicap," a very familiar voice said where Kor'la'vin was supposed to appear next.  The disappointment was exactly how Susan remembered it.  She'd heard it for so many years...
"You have one week, Rogers," she said.  "Then I'm bringing Clint in.  And no, your wounded puppy dog eyes will not work on me.  Now scram.  I've got soup to eat and a Russian novel to finish."
"Turn back around," Tony said.  He forced anger into his voice, but he suspected it came out more like begging.  "Steve, I can't-"
Looking at the clock told him it was way too early for his run, too early for him to even move from his bed really, but he hated sticky sheets.  Once he had changed them, he was already awake and a bit hungry, if grouchy about it.  He pulled out his tablet, figuring he might as well read a bit.  It might calm his mind, and it would definitely distract him from thinking about how much experience Tony had.
No one could be seen in the small meadow they crashed in.  They must have over shot the bastard, momentum carrying them forward and leaving the shooter behind.  Tony only hoped they were far enough away, because Steve needed help.
Natasha just hummed a soft agreement.  Steve felt like he was intruding on a private moment, but he couldn't bring himself to leave either.
Susan screamed in frustration, shooting again and taking a blast to her back that made her stumble forward.  Not the canon, thankfully, because at this range that would have taken her out.  She let some of the back-mounted missiles fly to keep Kor'la'vin from having time to charge the bigger gun.
Tony felt the pain in Steve's right wing as if he'd been gutted.  He gasped, yanking on the tentacles that refused to budge.
"I don't remember the lyrics.  All of those pop songs run together," Tony muttered.  "I'm sure I'll regret it if I look them up later."
Everything was about trust recently.  Steve sighed.  They both looked well enough.  "Alright.  I'll let the others know you're both okay."
"Come on," Iron Man said, moving around the desk and taking Steve's hand.  He tugged Steve along to one of the chairs, and Steve sank down into it, feeling like it was either too soft or he was too tense.  "Steve, what do you always tell Clint when he starts looking moody and withdrawn?"
Shoutout to QueenE who totally agrees with me that it would be hard to see Steve with someone else. Even though that's how it went down in the movie, I didn't think I could write it. Anyway, I hope you liked this chapter! Let me know your thoughts :) All kudos/comments are really, really appreciated. Because y'all are awesome.
“Are you lost, Pet?” Rogers repeated from their first meeting, bringing back the feeling of deja vu. He took a few steps forward, clear eyes roaming up and down Tony’s body like he was imagining him in the revealing piece from earlier. “Sometimes, fighting is futile. You have to accept the situation. The faster, the better for you.” Rogers shrugged, lips twitching upwards in amusement. “You can either make it hard for the both of us this year, or take part in the adventure that fate has brought you.”
If he let himself try to go along with Rogers’ deal, if he didn’t fight him at every turn, what was the endgame here? Would he simply live in this compound? Building and creating his designs in the workshop while Rogers did God knows what?
“What is this, twenty questions?” Steve bit out, nails digging into his skin to keep from snapping at his friends.
She checked her time, twelve minutes left. Natasha holstered her batons and moved across the room, using the mechanical lock pick to thrust open the doors to the vault. She grabbed the two duffel bags from the floor by the entrance and started stuffing them with stacks of cash. When those were full and thrust into the trunk of the van, she grabbed two more and filled those as well, emptying the vault. Her watch gave a seven minute warning, so Natasha took the flashdrive from her pocket and stuck it into the port to the computer resting in the main office.
Tony blinked. What the hell? He narrowed his eyes, tucking his cup closer to his skinny frame and leaning back in the chair. “I take care of myself just fine, thank you very much.
“Now you’re getting it.” He bopped her on the nose with his index finger and winked. The waitress came over and took their orders, giving them an appraising look before heading back to the kitchen. Tony frowned as he watched her. “She totally thought we were together.”
“Yes!” He answered quickly, not wanting to give the soldier any time to back out. “Can you come into the workshop? I have everything set up.”
Tony leaned in, his elbow on the table and a fond expression on his face. Steve’s chest warmed at the knowledge that that look was directed at him. “Bucky has been with me since I was scrawny. I got into a lot of fights as a kid, and couldn’t actually hold my own. He was my muscle until I gained my own. Then he just became my partner in crime.”
hurt, and he wasn’t ready to wake up yet. The light persisted. Why was Steve trying to wake him up? Didn’t he know that Tony was exhausted?
“Why would you think I know anything about the Avengers?” He argued hotly, putting on the best show he could by writhing in his restraints. “I didn’t know who they were when they saved me from Hydra,
“Bruce, what did you find?” Steve asked, a sickening feeling worming its way into his stomach. He had already pushed up from his chair, leaning his knuckles against the wood in front of him.
After tying the laces to his new wing-tipped shoes, Tony opened the door to reveal Clint. The blonde grinned and nodded approvingly, offering his arm. “May I escort you to dinner?”
“You took something of mine. That was your mistake.” Steve was commanding and authoritative, and Tony recognized his tone from a few days ago when he insisted Tony needed protection. Fuck. This must have been what he was going to explain.
Steve rolled his eyes. “We’ve got plenty of time before I need to take over your responsibilities, old man. I’m perfectly happy watching you scare your enemies into submission. I’m planning to ride that wave a little longer.”
After a few silent beats, Steve dropped to his knees, reaching out to lightly grip Tony’s downturned chin and turn it towards his own face. “Tony. Sweetheart. Do you trust me?”
He had no idea why the hell this was so important to Steve, but he didn’t dare try to argue again. This was a man on a mission. “I don’t know, a few months now? It started around January. But it wasn’t...I don’t know. I didn’t start feeling
Steve’s gaze softened considerably, and he reached out to intertwine their fingers, rubbing the pad of his thumb over Tony’s knuckles. “Your family’s butler.” Tony nodded and Steve pressed a kiss to his temple and turned back to the laptop. “It’s nice to meet you too, JARVIS. Though I will do everything in my power to make sure that you always,
“I guess I could be convinced,” Tony said, a bit breathless but then lowered his gaze. “Look, Steve, I’m sorry…”
“I’m Steve Rogers,” the captain said. Steve, just like the blondie in his dream. Today was getting weirder and weirder.
“I’ll take that as my que to leave,” Tony said before blasting away, narrowly missing Hyperion’s fist. As he found his footing again, Doctor Spectrum raised an arm, obviously ready for fire.
“No. No, Tony, I can’t.” Despite his best efforts, anger spread like wildfire in Tony’s chest and he ripped himself out of the comforting embrace.
“Who?” Tony stayed quiet and after a pause Steve said, “Are you talking about Vapor?” Tony blushed furiously and tried to scurry away from Steve’s hold. When he failed to do so, he averted the blue gaze and clenched his jaw.
“I have to,” Tony said, his voice colder than intended. Steve replied by hugging him harder, making Tony’s chest ache.
“Who said this had anything to do with cleaning?” Steve mused, making the genius gasp in a mock shock.
“Come on. What is it, Tony?” As he was met with more silence, Steve bowed his head in exasperation and chewed at the split on his bottom lip. “Tony, I can’t mind-read. What. Is it?” Steve reiterated, annoyance now clear in his voice. Tony tensed a little. He knew Steve would never use his strength against him, especially when he wasn’t in armour. But still, all those years with Howard and Obie thought him that that tone meant trouble and, sometimes, pain. Unconsciously, Tony squeezed himself into the closest corner, unsuccessfully trying to move away from Steve.
“She kissed you.” Tony blurted out, feeling the heat of anger and humiliation rise in his body, coloring his cheeks despite his best attempts to curb it. He tried to look away, but Steve had chosen that moment to lift his chin, forcing eye contact.
« You fainted. » Nebula said simply as she approached him. She paused, looking like she had a lot to say and, at the same time, did not know what to say. Finally, the cyborg breathed out without uttering a word as the weight of the recent events came crashing down on both their shoulders. He looked down at his hand which was still covered in Peter’s ashes.
“So I’ve been told,” Tony flirted. He was rewarded with a concealed snort as the woman left to tend to other patients. Steve took that opportunity to come by, having apparently also received the seal of approval from his own paramedic.
. His felt his face tense up in a sob, yet he was unable to cry. He brought his hand to his chest and clutched it protectively. For a moment, they both stilled in a silent mourn before Nebula spoke. « We’re almost there. From what I gathered your team, The Avengers, were in a sector of your planet called Wakanda. » Tony simply nodded, his head too full and heavy to formulate any coherent phrases. He tried to get up from the bench he had been lying on, but without the adrenaline, his legs failed him and gave out under his body weight. Before he could hit the floor Nebula caught him. « You should stay down. » Tony eyed her and pointed towards the pilot’s chair. « Bring me? » Tony whispered Nebula simply nodded and complied.
He has never cried in front of the team. But the feeling of massive loss, of fear, of failure came crashing down on Tony like a tsunami, breaking his last barriers. Steve responded by gripping him harder, making his wound protest again. But Tony didn’t care. He just squeezed harder and nuzzled his face into Steve’s neck, inhaling the familiar musky scent and sobbing without saying a word.
“You make it sound horrible. That’s not what happened.” Upon Tony’s questioning gaze, Steve sighed and looked away bashfully. “I think…we had the same dream.”
Hyperion had lasered the trap and sent his team into a force field cage by the time Tony turned the corner. Upon seeing the captured heroes, an uncontrolled manic laugh bubbled out of his chest.
“I dreamed of you, you know. I thought I was going nuts when you showed up here, as if materialized from my subconscious. And boy is my subconscious accurate, right down to the jaw grabbing.” Steve’s eyes widened comically, and Tony snickered, he liked that look as well.
“You found me. What can I do for you, cap?” Tony asked as he stepped into the elevator with Steve trailing him close behind. Steve paused, obviously considering something and Tony felt like he was going mad, his mental struggles showing under the form of impatient jittering.
“ Still got a bit of time.” Tony let out a surprised yelp as he was suddenly flipped onto his back and pinned down by Steve’s strong frame.
Today had been full of promises. He woke up this morning, feeling fresh after a reasonable amount of sleep, with the perspective of an evening date with Steve. That was before S.H.I.E.L.D. called.
Tony investigated the footage later and identified the criminals who showed up in the dimensional rift. Hawkeye, Widow, the God of Crime — really, the person who comes up with these names should be trialed for crime against humanity — the Hulk, Falcon and the Captain.
“Ok, I’m going to leave first. Cap, could you lead the team back to the mansion with the quinjet?” Tony said as he was already a few meters off the ground. He really wanted to go home, now. Steve seemed to hesitate, and Tony knew why. They usually left together as Steve really enjoyed the experience of flying with Iron Man. But Tony really wasn’t in the mood for that and, to make his point, he started hovering away before the captain said, “Sure.”
“Steve?” Letting go of a hand, Tony carefully slid a hand under his lover’s chin and tilted Steve’s face up towards his. Tony’s breath caught in his chest at the sight of those wet blue eyes.
“You need to come home first,” Tony said, unconsciously tracing an invisible “p” with his thumb. “Please. Reconsider the accords,” Tony pressed hopefully. Steve turned his head, gazing into the wall for a moment as he nervously chewed his bottom lip. The blond head finally dipped as the broad shoulder slumped. Tony’s heart was racing and had to fight against his own nerves to prevent his voice from shaking.
« Where’s my crew? » Rocket said sharply, snapping the moment. Steve loosened his grip just enough to be able to turn his head. Tony stayed quiet and the alien avoided the raccoon’s gaze. Rocket closed the distance between him and the alien and repeated. « Where. Is. My. Crew. » When he was met with silence again, he yelled. « Nebula, goddammit, where is my crew?! » The said Nebula squeezed her eyes shut before talking, her tone almost too soft to be heard.
," Leo snapped, shocking Susan.  He'd never snapped like that before, not at her.  "I don't need both-"
"Suzie," Leon said, and Tony could hear how choked his voice was.  "Kes can't perform miracles.  The crystal-"
"Only usually to the healers," she replied, taking the steps easily.  "Or if the old or wounded have problems flying."
"Yes, Ma'am," he said, swallowing thickly around the lump in his throat.  He touched her cheek and her nostrils flared before she moved away, guiding him through the cave as her tail released him.
"Then you better get my good side and be better at drawing kissing than you are at giving an actual kiss," Natasha teased. "Seriously though, you can tell them no kissing if you want. Do what you're comfortable with. Drawing your teammates making out is kinda weirder for you than it would be for someone who doesn't know us personally."
Tony looked up, trying to follow the line of the tentacles.  That was when he finally saw the skull hanging in the air above him.  The eight tentacles that held him in place came out from the bottom of it and Tony felt sick as one of them reached around the joints on his neck.
After pouring some syrup over the waffles, Steve took a bite.  "This is really good," he said, impressed.  It was mouth-wateringly good.  Once he could think properly again, he was going to have to sit down with Tony and come up with a tactic that would get Rhodey to make them more often.
"Thank you, JARVIS," Steve said, putting down the files as he rolled his shoulders.  "Would he be available to speak with me now?"
And Steve's voice.  Steve's voice that he wouldn't be able to hear again.  He'd known something was wrong from the start, but he'd pushed it aside.  The voice was wrong.  The voice was one he
She cried onto his shoulder, not caring if he was an AI or her however-many-great-grand-father in the flesh.  It was her code, but she had never imaged how
"Come on," Steve said, putting an arm around his shoulders.  "We can sit and I'll tell you about the others."
Steve grabbed his uniform and quickly stripped.  He didn't put on all of it, but the under armor Stark made for undercover missions would be useful.  Despite the lack of full uniform, he grabbed his shield, because he could use its comforting weight on his back right now.  "I'm good to go," he said, swinging the pack onto his back.
"You're stuck with me, actually," Sam said, head going down to look over Tony's leg.  "We sent the head healers away with the rest of the civilians.  But I've had a lot of practice with bad wounds on the battle field."
," Steve said, hugging Tony against him.  "The man who created Iron Man.  Who does what Iron Man does, but takes none of the credit.  I fell in love with you too, ya punk."
Tony watched Kestrel and Susan through the monitors as they worked, glad the two girls were talking again.  He had kept watch in case he needed to intervene with a quick excuse, but little Rhodey patched things up far better than anyone with 'Stark' in their name ever could.  He smiled as Kes teased his Little Bear about Leon.
Steve swallowed, then brought Tony into another hug, kissing his temple.  The fact that he could kiss Tony now was something Steve wasn't going to get over any time soon.  "Have I mentioned how proud I am of you today?" Steve asked, because this close he could feel Tony trembling.
"I'm not leaving you, damn it!" Tony shouted.  "Now don't be an idiot and help me put pressure on the wound."
Allowing himself a moment of satisfaction at Kang's grunt of pain, Steve prepared for the next attack.  It was very short-lived, unfortunately.  No sooner had he regained his balance, Steve found himself caught in a green bubble.  He pounded at it with his shield, realizing he was now hovering in mid-air.  The bubble stayed strong, refusing to break or yield.
Bruce didn't look convinced.  He took in the state of Steve's uniform critically, and Steve was glad neither his ribs nor his leg showed outwardly.  "Steve, I like to think we're past the point of lying and keeping injuries secret," Bruce said.
?  I can list the number of people who do on one hand and one of those actively tried to kill me.  So if you're looking for Iron Man, he's not here anymore.  Find someone else to ride off into the sunset with, old man.  You'll be happier for it."
"I'm not asking you to trust me, Captain," Tony said, picking up a wrench.  "I'm asking you to leave me alone, because I'm not telling you anything more.  I know which one I'm actually likely to get."
"The original pilot of the War Machine armor," Cap confirmed.  "He was paralyzed after one of our fights.  It took a while, but he never let his injuries define him.  He held the line with us against
"I'm... sorry," the blue dragon said, looking at Tony finally.  Then he launched himself into the sky in a way that must have hurt his shoulder where Tony had shot him.
"So here is your warning, me Number Nine," Tony said.  "Who knows what will happen if Steve lives.  I've never been around to figure that out.  But now that we know it's coming, we can prepare for the Skrulls and the Kree.  It won't happen like Kang says.  But we...  Fuck, we've failed so many times.   I don't know if we can change it.  But you can at least bring him back into the time stream alive if you do it right.  I..."
The elevator ride felt longer than normal, but Steve knew that it was just in his head.  When he got down to the lab, he knocked on the door, but it didn't open.  The keypad was completely black as well, none of the usual lights lit up.
Red, gold, and gunmetal grey.  Fire of the forge and passion.  Science and the wonder of the unexplored.  A lone star burning all alone in the moonless night.
The silence this time was more comfortable, and Steve allowed himself to enjoy what contact Tony would permit.  He could live with this.  Maybe someday, Tony wouldn't need an old relic like him.  But until then, Steve was going to stick with him and put his stubborn head to good use.  He was bound to make more mistakes, but he wasn't going to give up.
"I've missed my friend a lot lately," Steve said, smiling through it despite how much the word 'friend' cut him.  "Maybe you know him?  He's a real wise cracker who walks around in a tin can all day and always knows the right thing to say to make me feel at home."
Any reply Tony might have had was stolen from him as the air was ripped from his lungs.  He gasped for breath as Steve dove, blacking out without the suit to protect him at such fast speeds.
Steve sighed as Iron Man left, hunching over the chair to put his face in his hands.  He'd really botched that one.  He closed his eyes, swallowing back the hurt that threatened to block his throat.  As if his night couldn't get any worse...
-"  The name was spat out with a viciousness that surprised Steve.  "He didn't help.  None of us realized the rat bastard was the one who was double-dealing."
The temple was easy enough to find and much faster to get to than when Tony was going by foot.  He landed with a clunk in the empty courtyard where he'd dropped Viper off.  Steve had a lot more trouble with the trees as he tried to drop down, and Tony could feel his frustration as yet another branch scratched him.
Red, gold, and gunmetal grey.  Fire of the forge and passion.  Science and the wonder of the unexplored.  A lone star burning all alone in the moonless night that connected them both.  "Tony..."
Tony quickly pushed down the worry for Viper, living alone in a rusted temple.  She said she'd be safe there, and he couldn't afford to think too much of her around the dragons.  "Maybe it's just a cold winter coming?" he asked, not sure if they even had seasons down here.
Steve sighed.  His morning wood had at least died with those thoughts.  He should probably find some way to move before Tony woke up, but he couldn't bring himself to.  His arm was wrapped around Tony's waist and letting go of this rare moment of human contact was beyond him.
Steve let out a low rumble.  It didn't sound fully pleased, but it did sound better.  "Uh, sorry for attacking you.  Again," Steve said sheepishly.
He needed to get close.  Steve threw his shield again, angling it so that she'd have to dodge towards him, rather than away.  He rushed her.  She tried to avoid it, flying up, but not fast enough.  The shield caught her in the leg, shaking her off balance, and Steve grabbed her foot, anchoring her in place and using her shaky balance to throw her down.
"What?" Steve said, eyes widening in surprise.  "How did - I didn't strike out," Steve lied.  Then more truthfully, "And that's not why I'm asking."
Tony to give a sharp bark of laughter.  "They'd never find us in this storm," he said, curling closer.  His head was pounding, and he just wanted to sleep.  The thought of sleep would normally have worried him, especially so soon after a panic attack.  But if he was asleep, he wouldn't have to shiver so damn much.  He couldn't quite feel his toes anymore, even if he was practically curled up in Steve's lap in the darkness.
"You look unfairly good still, aside from the eyes," Ms. Potts said cheerfully.  "But I'd recognize hangover eyes anywhere."
Tony swallowed.  They couldn't be that far.  Not more than ten minutes' walk if he estimated right.  That was twenty minutes Steve would be by himself.  "I'll come back," Tony promised, hating himself for having to make it and the fear that Steve tried to bury when he said it.  "But you need to keep pressure on the wound."
"You haven't been the same since these guys moved in," Happy said, his eyes narrowing at Steve again.  "Just remember, boss.  If these superhero friends do anything to you-"
He didn't hesitate to follow the order, grabbing his away bag and stuffing in the nearest clothes he could find.  "Sitrep?"
"So tell me then," Tony said, using every trick he knew to get around the pain.  "What's a pretty doll like you doing in a place like this?"
"Tony!"  Steve's voice rang through his mind and Tony quickly found himself wrapped up in Steve's wings.
The skull shattered into thousands of pieces as Viper screamed, and Tony had the great pleasure of watching the tentacles drop lifelessly to the ground, some of them still flaming.
"We all are, Rhodey," Tony said.  "And that wouldn't make a difference to him, but we can keep it our secret."
"More looking to woo a genius," Steve replied, stepping into Tony's space as Steve congratulated himself on the line.  Much better than Tony's attempts at flirting with the butterfly had been.
"As I said, it is not necessary that you do," Wanda replied.  There was a general air of mystery around her that unnerved Tony just a little.  "Your future is shrouded in calamity, Tony Stark."
There was anger in Pepper's voice, and he pat her hand absently to show that it was okay.  She deflated a little, her shoulders slumping as her hand slipped into his, clutching at it with a bruising grip that could have rivaled Steve's.
They fell into quiet after that as Susan waited for the hover train to come.  She liked having a quiet moment before missions started, getting there early if she could, since it gave her a chance to calm down when she got too wound up.  It was a good four hours before the train was supposed to come, but Cap didn't want to take any chances that they might slip out too early. She didn't mind waiting, even if that was more time for her to contemplate her failures.
"Bucky?" Tony asked, looking away.  Something changed in Tony, but it was so subtle that Steve almost missed it.  Even now, Steve couldn't quite pinpoint whether it was the sudden tension in Tony's shoulders or the cagey, darting glance away that tipped him off.  But for the first time Steve
"You don't know that," Steve said again, his voice a low growl.  "We could have found a different solution."
"You should eat your soup before it gets cold," Tony said, his voice tight, but he leaned into her just a little instead of pulling away.
Shaking his head, Steve unlocked his phone then tapped at the link she sent him.  It was a Tumblr post, which made him wary, but he figured Wanda was sending it to him for a reason.
Even in the 40s, that was a pretty ominous phrase.  "Okay?" he said, wondering if he'd screwed up on the field.  Technically, he and Natasha were running the Avengers, but Rhodey was not only a higher-ranking officer, but also older and more experienced.  Steve knew better than to brush that off, especially if it was something in the field of air support.
Steve kissed him again, because that appeared to be a good way to get some peace and quiet. Tony only grumbled a little.
"I can call someone to come and wait until they arrive," Steve amended, realizing his misstep.  "You were awake under there.  And alone."
"Baseball innuendo?  Really?" Tony asked, trying not to laugh at how ridiculous a goof Steve was being.  It would only encourage him.  "America's golden boy dirtying America's favorite past time?"
So did the sergeant.  As he radioed in to find Tony, Steve looked around.  There was another airman missing from their escort, so at least Tony wasn't sneaking around.  He checked his phone and typed out a quick message to Natasha, filling her in.
"Natasha?" Tony asked, the lack of nickname giving away his uncertainty even when his voice sounded steady.
"I need to get back to work," Tony said, his shoulders hunched in a line of pain and fury.  Steve knew Tony wasn't angry at the person who did this either.  "I need-"
"This is First Lieutenant Li.  The warehouse has been evacuated, Captain," a voice told him.  "There's too much in the warehouse to abandon it, however.  We've been fighting them the best we can, but-"
With a sigh, Steve gave up on the Rhodey drawing for now.  He'd return to it later when he was more focused and could give it the attention it deserved.
at," Iron Man said, and Steve sensed he was a little hysterical.  Not even the mechanized voice could hide the small note of fear.
Rhodey didn't show that he'd seen, but he slipped a tablet he must have brought to appease a bored genius into Tony's hand as stood up, a clear message backup that Tony never used, but always appreciated.
Steve looked up from the drawing he was working on, knowing he was busted.  "People have pictures of you from the Avengers' fights, sir," he said.  Fury was in a hoodie with sunglasses, looking for all the world like he'd been living under a bridge for the past few years.  Steve knew that wasn't the case, thankfully, but the disguise was useful.  "And your obituary ran in the papers with your name."
Given how much Stark had been drinking, Steve was surprised the man was so deft with his keys getting in.  Steve almost always had to open the door for him, usually having to check Tony's pockets for the keys.  "Thought you were drunk," Steve muttered.
Here is the second chapter as requested by some of you! First of all, thank you all for the comments and the kudos, wow. I did not expect that; you’re all awesome. A special thanks to
Steve heard himself yell « TONY! » and before he could register his own mouvements, he was already running at full speed. Tony barely had time to look up before being knocked away from Nebula into a fierce hug. « Tony. Oh, Tony, I thought you were dead. » Steve said his voice breaking as he kept on mumbling and crushing the smaller body against his, making Tony’s wound scream in agony.
I needed to get this out of my brain or it was going to be the death of me (or more accurately my school year lol). It also fits several prompts on my 2018 Steve/Tony bingo card, I have yet to choose which one. The rating will probably change as the story progresses.
“...do you have to go already?” Steve asked carefully, his grip tightening around the slimmer waist. The genius ruffled the blond hair, earning a groan of protest, before rubbing the tip of his nose in the soft locks.
“Well, sorry. I…I guess drank too much after all,” Tony said, avoiding Steve’s gaze. As he started to distance himself from the other man’s warm chest, Steve pulled him in by the jaw again and kissed him hard. Their tongues intertwined like in his dream and the reminder mixed with the hotness of the kiss made Tony moan uncontrollably into Steve’s mouth. Without breaking away, Steve lifted the smaller man by the butt, forcing Tony to grab on with his arms and legs, and turned their positions around. Tony was now pressed against the console with his arms locked around Steve’s neck, pulling him furthermore into the kiss. They finally broke away after a moment and Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s. The proximity seemed odd, as they were mere strangers only moments ago, but also unbearably soothing, intimate and familiar. Tony licked his lips before speaking again.
“Hey, people who break into my house have no say on my alcohol consumption habits,” Tony scoffed as he made his way back to the console Steve was leaning against. In his brilliant drunken state, Tony’s tired legs wobbled a bit as he approached the other man. Before he could trip over himself, Steve caught him, the sudden tug sending the content of his glass over both their connected chests.
Tony tried to remember the previous fight with the douche ego-alien, but the more he tried, the faster his foggy mind spun in and out of focus. Hyperion might have hit him harder than he thought.
“No, I did not, sir.” Without replying, Tony rose in a hurry, clutching his mouth as he bolted for the nearby bathroom. He barely had time to get to his knees when his empty stomach contracted, and he gagged on a disgusting mix of acidic coffee and bile.
Steve was suddenly very glad she hadn't known.  Though 'racier photoshoots' were definitely relevant to his interests, knowing her, she'd have sent them at a horrible time.  "I've been doing fine on my own," he said, hoping it came out sincere and not defensive.
Breakfast was a much more pleasant affair.  Peggy had kept her promise about getting more vegetables and Tony was used to rationing, so having no meat on the table wasn't a hardship.    After breakfast, Steve took him to the cave and stood guard as Tony went back to find his armor.  Tony was a little glad the cave was too small for Steve to fit into, because the walk back was the most private his thoughts had been since he met the dragons and it was no small relief to be alone.  Not that he was trying to
"I'll keep that in mind," he said, and by the look on her face, his tone was probably still on the stuffy and judgemental side.  He ignored her laugh and went back to drawing Rhodey.  He would finish this picture even if it killed him.
"Anyone ever mention how bull-headed you are?" Rhodey said with a sigh.  "Notice anything about the quantities, Cap?"
"Yeah," Steve said, giving Tony a small, lopsided grin before ducking his head.  "Ya gotta problem with that?"
Peggy touched his cheek once and he allowed himself to lean into it briefly before bracing himself for the pain.  Peggy had steady and gentle claws, but there was no helping some of the pain. Thankfully with Tony's guidance, it was a quick job.
"Yeah," Steve said, going through the same memories.  "She's alive.  Sharon might not be for much longer though, if she keeps trying to sneak out into the battle with us.  Peggy'll kill her herself if she keeps that up.  She's only twelve and she wants to go to war.  She sounds American, by the way.  They moved to the States when she was young."
could handle Tony at his worst, Steve was determined to make a go at it.  Maybe it was for the best though, if Tony really was in a mood.
Okay, Steve was putting a stop to this.  He pulled Tony closer to him, ignoring Jan's knowing gleam and Tony's confusion as he shifted until he was between them and put his hands on his hips.  He prepared a stern lecture that would stir their patriotic guilt.  "You can't-"
Tony stopped cold, and this time when Steve stepped close, he welcomed the contact.  "Get the kids in here."
Now wasn't the time to think about crashing and ice, however.  He had a robot invasion to stop and he had to do it without the rest of the Avengers for back up since Iron Man was AWOL.
He jumped when arms snuck around him, the bond growing stronger with the contact.  Steve was pouring emotion through the link - love and affection that made Tony both shaken and angry.  "Don't-"
his technology in those robots, and whoever's behind it is actively framing him.  I'd say he's got an interest in finding this guy as much as we do.  You can send Iron Man to talk to him."
.  At least he hadn't been discovered, but he could feel his own anger building.  "Is that what you think I'm here for?"
"You've got your memories as a human," Tony teased gently as Steve's arm braced around his back.   "Should be a piece of cake.  You really want to lead like this though?"
Steve's tail did not let Tony go.  Tony pat it reassuringly.  "Steve, it's fine."  Then he pressed his good hand against the tail and thought about the stars on a calm night with the ocean's waves as the only music as they rocked the Lady Dorma soothingly.  "Shh.  It's okay."
He set her down just outside the gate, letting the suit disengage.  It was, thankfully, much easier to get out of the suit than to get in.  Tony knelt down in front of her once it released him and waited for her permission before taking her ankle in his hands.
There was a strange stillness to the armor.  Iron Man was rarely ever still, and it was something Steve had come to associate with things that upset his friend.  "Not personally," Iron Man said, the mechanized voice without any of the usual inflection.  "He was...  He and Mr. Stark didn't get along.  He wasn't- Never mind.  Going to the gym this late at night?"
"Thor, Mr. Stark says Dr. Foster's phone isn't on and he needs her on the line, ASAP," Iron Man snapped.
"Maybe check on him?" Bruce asked hesitantly.  "We're worried, and I'm kind of missing the guy I was getting to know.  He might talk to you."
He didn't fight the hands that were wrapping around his waist and pulling him back.  Slowly he became aware of Tony yelling, "-reckless
Tony laughed in a way that sent heat down to Steve's belly and lower.  "'Cause you won't sleep at all if I take you to yours.  Don't worry none about your virtue, Sheriff.  I'm just putting the big hero to bed."
"It's fine," Steve said, pulling him back down to kiss his nose.  Tony settled back in Steve's lap with a small laugh, but the desperateness from earlier had broken, replaced by a softer mood that allowed Tony to loosen his grip on Steve's shirt and sigh contentedly.  "Third time's the charm?" Tony asked quietly, thinking back to the McClane curse.
Electricity shot out from the edge of the bubble.  Steve cried out in pain, unable to move as green electricity raced up his body.  Pain roared through his extremities to his core, but he couldn't move to hunch over and protect himself.  It burned through him, like fire on his nerves.  Was this it?
"Intervention," Rhodey said more grimly, setting a plate of waffles in front of Steve.  The omelette was still hot too.  When Rhodey didn't say anything more, Steve figured he was waiting for him to try the food.
"Yeah, yeah.  Enough with the sappy stuff, Winghead," Tony said, but he lingered in Steve's embrace, and his voice cracked.  "Let's just get this over with."
Getting the jet ready required little effort, mostly just letting the pilot know and letting her take care of things.  Steve did watch the movement of the armor carefully, because the last thing they needed was for even a piece of that, as maligned as it was, in the hands of people like the ones who had kidnapped Tony in the first place.
"To be fair, that's usually rule number one for most people," she said, nodding softly.  "There's one final thing, and this is one of the most important.  I can only guess at what you heard, but you are going to need a lot of patience to deal with Tony.  I can guarantee you he
Steve got off him, but cautiously, like he still wasn't convinced that Tony was telling the truth.  "I couldn't sense you in there," Steve said.
Steve sat up, breathing heavily as he clutched at the sheets.  He swallowed down bile.  Out of all his nightmares, he hated that one the most.  Dreams of the ice left him trembling.  Dreams of Bucky's fall had him waking up in tears.  But this dream left him with nausea and sickness that had him leaving a trash can by his bed just in case he couldn't hold it down.  He swallowed again, closing his watering eyes.
"Tony!" Rhodey said, hugging him tightly.  Kes was quick to follow, and he pat both of their heads awkwardly.
He'd been alone in the ice, even if he didn't remember it.  He didn't want anyone else to go through that.
Carefully, he put his foot on one side of the crack and his hand on the wall.  Nothing happened, but he held still.
The thought of Peggy set Steve doubly wrong-footed.  It hit him sharply how he missed her laugh, and he had to close his eyes a moment to push it away.  Tony didn't need his problems as well.
Susan took a shuddering breath.  No fix.  She should have known that.  She did.  She wasn't that naive anymore and she...  she knew that.  It just felt so.... heavy.  She leaned against the cliff-face where she waited for the convoy, gravel crunching under her feet.  It was dark, which wasn't helping either.  Sure, she could see in the dark, and she wasn't afraid of it any more (and she hadn't been, no matter what Leo said - not since the second grade), but that didn't mean she liked it.
It should have warned Steve off, but he didn't know if he could get up the courage to start this up again later.  "You could," Steve replied, tracing the casing to the repulsor in Iron Man's palm before moving back up again.  This had been building between them for a while, and Steve swallowed as a different kind of terror took over him.  It was followed closely by hope, because he knew Iron Man had been responding as well, and he hadn't shied away before.
The fight was vicious.  The devil man had a gun and deadly accuracy that was only foiled by the dragons' agility in the air.  But there wasn't enough room to maneuver, and it was too cold for dragon fire.  Without their best weapon they had to chase a small target with a deadly gun, and both of the dragons were bleeding heavily.  Steve had a hole in his wing that made every movement agony.  The devil man aimed for Steve, but before Tony could yell the silver dragon barreled into the devil man.  The gun went off and he could hear the dragon scream as they tumbled precariously close to the edge of the abyss.
“How much time?” Steve asked eagerly. Tony grinned, the blue intensity of Steve’s eyes making his heart flutter.
“Are you kidding me right now? You slammed the emergency breaks to ask me how I was doing? Are you out of your mind, Steve?” Tony ranted. He was beyond tempted to call J.A.R.V.I.S. again, but with the way Steve’s big annoying hand was hovering above his mouth, he knew it’d probably be a repeat of the previous edition.
Then again, why not. It’s not every day that your dreams objectify themselves and Tony was nothing if not opportunistic.
“You are not wrinkly, Tony,” Steve said into the smaller man’s ear, sending a wave of goosebumps down Tony’s neck.
“I am only here to talk, Iron Man. Please hear me out.” Tony hesitated and, after deciding that he really didn’t like intruders, held his stance. From where he stood, he could see the captain’s jaw work as he slowly moved one hand to his face and removed his cowl.
“You know, I think I can’t get any cleaner than this,” Tony huffed as he felt Steve smile against his neck.
« Tony? » When the smaller man didn’t respond, he pulled back a bit, realizing that Tony had gone completely limp in his arms. « Oh god, Tony? Wake up. Tony. » Things shuffled around him and Nebula hurried to his side. « He’s severely wounded and has lost a lot of blood. We have to get him help as soon as possible. » And, for the first time since the arrival of the ship, Steve noticed the blood soaking through Tony’s clothes and cursed. « We need to get him to the medics. » He said as he picked up the genius as gently as he could. « Don’t you dare leave me, Tony. Not you too. »
“Tsk, remind me to design you better next time.” Shooing away the nearest holograms, Tony headed to the bar for a much-needed drink. The first sip sent the heady and complex perfume of his aged whiskey through his pallet, instantly soothing the raw edges of his nerves. Tony sank into his nearby computer chair and observed the few remaining holograms that brightened the dark hide-out. Tony sigh and tilted his head back. The footage felt alarmingly foreign to him.
Tony thought. Steve, on his side, merely waited, blocking Tony with his imposing frame while assuming a casual stance. After a solid five minutes of silence, Steve sighed.
“...goddammit, GODDAMMIT STEVE!” Tony yelled uncontrollably. The billionaire leaned once again against the window and tried to calm down. As his eyes focused once again on the children, Tony’s heart sank. He whipped his head back toward Steve who, having not moved from his previous spot, was currently facing away from him.
Tony woke up with a start, gasping like a fish out of water, the sudden movement jerking his stab wound. His laboured breathing eventually settled down enough for his vision to come back and he took a look around him. Before he had the chance to fully come back to his senses, a voice startled him.
« This is my crew’s ship. They’re stupid but it’s unlike them to come unannounced. » said the raccoon. As if on cue, the ship’s doors opened and Steve and Thor stalked forward, shield and hammer in hand. A few moments passed before two shapes materialized themselves. Steve’s breath caught in his chest. There was Tony, supported by an alien looking woman.
“Why not, Steve? It’s been a year and we’re still stuck in the same goddamn loop! I can’t-” Tony interrupted himself, trying to take a second to unclench his tight jaw and sore hands. “I’m trying, Steve. My best. Why don’t you - do you even see that?” Tony finally said incoherently. The other man was now slumped against a wall staring blindly at the floor.
His arrival was welcomed by the ear-piercing scream of a little girl — or a little boy, who was he to judge — and Tony noted that there were more civilians than expected. That was going to complicate things.
“And you underdressed,” the genius replied before returning his attention to the children outside. They both stared in silence for a moment before Steve whispered softly.
“I’m fine looking apparently,” Tony quoted, trying to cover his growing frustration with humor. Upon receiving a puzzled look from Steve, he realized the whole act was probably not very convincing. Tony could have said something else but he just, well, didn’t feel like it. Steve, being Steve, just stood there, eradiating awkwardness and indecision.
The ship looked alien, if that wasn’t stating the obvious. The Wakandan guards, at least the ones who were still alive, were already forming a perimeter around it. Steve arrived beside Thor and Rocket who were standing the closest to the ship. « What’s going on? »
Tony’s slower brain took a moment to compute the new input. Steve’s hand was still covering his mouth and, feeling mischievous, Tony licked the broad palm. Steve pulled his hand away only to be caught by the smaller man as Tony finally leaned in and kissed him. When Steve stayed unresponsive, something inside Tony laid down and died and, in an attempt to cut his loses, he started pulling away.
“...mmm, what time is it?...” Steve mumbled, his tongue still numb from his slumber. The super-soldier reached blindly towards Tony and pulled the other body against his, nuzzling the tender skin of the smaller man’s neck.
What is the use of not talking anyways? You’ve been throwing me the cold shoulder ever since we shook off the gamma radiations. Do you really expect me to mind read? That’s non-sensical,” Steve ranted, and Tony knew he was stretching the other man’s patience very thin. After a moment Steve sighed and, to Tony’s surprise, brought him into a tight hug.
“I…” Steve followed him and tried to pull his lover into an embrace from behind. Rage flared in Tony’s chest and he jerked away nearly elbowing Steve in the chin.
“Tony, why won’t you talk to me? Did I do something wrong that made you think I’m not reliable?” Steve asked, his voice trailing, becoming softer and softer. He sounded very heartbroken and Tony felt like an asshole.
“Come on. I need to get out, I’m getting more wrinkly than I should be,” The genius said, turning off the water before walking out of the shower and wrapping himself in a fluffy towel. Steve’s strong arms wrapped around him, effectively stopping the drying process.
“I want to be home...with you,” The captain said in a tone laced with vulnerability, Tony felt his stomach twist into a knot. The smaller man remained silent, his jaw clenched tight as he tried to maintain the regularity of his breathing.
“Well, that’s not creepy at all. Are you a fan or something?” Steve laughed, the sound making a soothing warmth spread at the base of his reactor.
Tony thought and bolted towards Steve only to be electrocuted by this…thing. The current ran through his body, spreading a wild fire of red-hot pain, paralyzing his muscles. Tony hated today.
Today was such a bad day. He barely made it out of the superhero team’s grip – a bit more and he would have had to accessorise a bright orange onesie, not that fashion was a priority in jail — and now he might have a head injury.
“Thank you, Iron Man. I know how this looks. Breaking into your base was not my first choice. You have my apologies. I’m, umm, the captain,” the other man said awkwardly, tentatively shifting his stance towards Tony like a nervous teenager. Tony rolled his eyes, walked forward and boldly presented his hand to the captain. The other immediately shook his outstretched hand.
« They are gone. » Tony flinched in Steve's arms and hugged him harder while Rocket just stood there. His mouth opened and closed, making little noises, but no words seemed to be coming out of him. « I’m sorry. » Nebula finally said, her head dropping as her lips were pressed into a tight line. Thor kneeled next to Rocket and brought him to his chest, petting his head. « I’m sorry, rabbit. » And then a heavy silence settled and no one dared to move for a little while. It took a second for Steve to register that Tony was still. Too still.
“Okay, you win. Take me to bed, Steve.” Steve gave him a startled look and then broke into a warm laughter a mere second after as the reference settled in.
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve pressed on and Tony was about to lose his mind. Was Steve experiencing brain damage after the gamma transformation? Tony was ready to bet good money on that one. He tore his face away from the constricting hand and glared at the blond man.
“Oh no you don’t,” Tony muttered to himself before blasting the energy core in his enemy’s palm. With a whining noise, the energy core sent waves of power surges, casting a pulsing yellow light around the armor…which was now red and gold?
“Not at all,” Tony said, stubbornly not looking at Steve, feigning normality even as he spat out the words. Steve huffed and shifted a little bit. Suddenly, the super soldier reached over and slammed the emergency lockdown of the elevator. The cabin jerked and came to a halt, and Tony cursed, bracing himself on the rails as he momentarily lost his footing.
“Actually, you pried my jaw open and shoved your tongue into my mou--hmmf,” Tony protested as Steve covered the chatty mouth with his big hand.
“I wasn’t expecting visitors,” Tony called back, raising his right repulsor towards the source of the voice, his increased heart beat the only thing betraying his surprise. A man in a black uniform came out of the shadows, shield in hand, and Tony immediately recognized him.
This chapter moves kind of slow since I needed to set things up for the next phase of the action. It took me a while to figure things out and select the ideas I found interesting. I still don't know how long it'll be but I think it’ll be a lengthy one if I want to spell out everything I’ve thought about.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., bring out my live-combat recordings dossier.” When met with silence, Tony drew in a deep breath and let his heavy eyelids close for a minute. Great, now his A.I. was taking a nap.
“Oops, messed up your costume, my bad,” Tony laughed. Steve didn’t say a word and gingerly removed the glass from Tony’s hand, placing it down on the console behind him, out of Tony’s reach.
Tony felt insane. There was no way, from day one, that Steve was ever going to meet him halfway. He turned his back on Tony once already and it was now painfully clear that it was doomed to happen again. Heartbreak hit him like a lightning bolt and he wanted to run. He had to run. Consumed by a wild panic, Tony quickly wiggled into his shoes without bothering with his socks while grabbing his briefcase and suit. As he bolted for the door, Steve caught his arm. Tony, who was on the verge of hysteria, had enough adrenaline to break away from the super-soldier’s grip. The genius ran down the narrow staircase like a madman, nearly toppling over a couple of times as he struggled to find a steady footing in his frenzied race. When he finally sped away in his car, one thought was playing on repeat in his head.
“The captain.” Tony brought both repulsors up. “You know, I really don’t like surprises. What are you doing here?”
I do have a beta now (yay)! But as always kudos and comments (or corrections) are appreciated! I know chapter 3 is very late but it's on its way...Thank you for your patience! ^^;
“We are back online, sir.” Tony breathed a sigh of contentment. The broken pieces of armour had been gathered by the pod’s as Tony started to hover, testing his boot jets for fun. He might be a little armour-dependent. Just a little.
“I like to be surprising,” Steve said as he retorted with a light slap on Tony’s left butt cheek, making the smaller man squeal. Tony mumbled unhappily as Steve kissed him apologetically.
“Really?...” Steve breathed out as he traced Tony’s knuckles with a soothing finger. The genius smiled lightly. Tony grabbed his lover’s hands and started rubbing small circles onto the big palms.

This was the guy he saw in his dream. But how? He had never met the captain in person before today. Taken aback, Tony finally lowered his stance and retracted his face plate. Relief was so honestly written on the captain’s face that Tony found himself relaxing despite his own will.
“You give me no choice, Tony. Whether you talk to me or we stay here.” Steve was evil. Tony had decided that now. Supervillain grade evil. He crossed his arms on his chest defiantly and look away realizing he must have done something similar when he was 5 years old.
“I’m fine. Did you find anything?” Tony lied. Which was all kinds of pointless considering he was lying to his own creation.
“Sir, I believe you have fainted. Do you require any assistance?” Tony slowly rose, fighting against the stiffness of his back and the screaming pain in his neck. He was still a bit dizzy, faint and alarmingly aroused. As the information of his dream mixed with his current reality, a wave of nausea rode through his belly, overwhelming the remaining sexual impulsions.
“I don’t want you to go.” Tony closed his eyes, suddenly invaded by a conflicting mix of defeat and agitation.
“I still don’t understand how you can be so convinced something is wrong,” Tony said, twirling his empty glass of whiskey by the rim.
“Error. I cannot identify the files you are requesting, sir.” Tony frowned as the beginning of a promising headache bloomed behind his closed eyes. That’s not good. Regaining some composure, Tony took another drawl of liquor and got to work, determined to get to the bottom of this. His memory was foggy, but he could have sworn he had several dossiers dedicated to battle archives. As he typed away, his vision started to give, and, despite his best attempts, darkness swallowed him before he could think of finding a more comfortable place to rest.
“What else happened in your dream?” Steve asked again, more urgently this time. Even with his lowered inhibitions, Tony wasn’t so hot on the idea of sharing his wet dreams.
“Hun?” Tony blinked at his own hand. He swears he was wearing dark blue a split second ago. Looking around, familiar figures appeared within the limits of the golden light. Tony had seen those faces before. They were well known villains.
Anyways, he already made the bad decision of removing his stuffy armor — with the exception of his gauntlets, he’s stupid not suicidal, thank you very much — so drinks it is. With a little bit of a stagger, Tony got to the bar and refilled his glass.
