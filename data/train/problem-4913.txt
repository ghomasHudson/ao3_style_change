a crab.”
“What’s two plus two?”
Still chuckling, Dean says, “Oh man, I think there are some podcasts out there you’d really enjoy. People with money do stupid things with it is the general answer, though.”
“I’d be a pretty shitty nurse if I just let a dude with amnesia walk out of here without even trying to figure out who you could call.” Dean says, scrubbing his sweaty hands on his sweatpants to try to dry them off. Doesn’t work -- fuck, he needs a shower, and probably some more sleep. Night shift is a bitch. “Seriously, don’t worry about it. I’ll let my brother know we’re gonna stop by tomorrow at some point. You should get some more sleep, let your head rest a bit longer.”
When he gets to his room, exhaustion sweeps over him like a consuming tide, racing up his spine. He sits down heavily on the mattress, undoing his boots and kicking them into the darkened corner where the light from his lamp doesn’t reach. Stares at the shadows on the wall. Very carefully doesn’t think about the empty space in the bed behind him.
"It was my choice, Dean. I did it for you. It's always been you." Dean reaches out for Castiel's hand and his fingers are freezing. Dean looks at Castiel with worry.
We're starting to get into the meat of the story, barely. I don't know how I feel about this chapter. I hope ye enjoy!
“Like hell,” Dean says through gritted teeth. “We're bringing Cas back. No thanks to you. If this is why you're here, then nice seeing ya." He turns away and starts walking toward the table displaying the spell contents.
“Oh, god,” Eileen whispers.
Castiel slowly opens his eyes, looking at Dean. The cerulean stands out against the crimson spattered across his face and Dean grins, bursting with happiness. “Cas!” Dean kneels next to him, placing a hand on his shoulder.
Dean looks up, confused. “Huh?” She smiles at him, knowingly.
“Wait, you’re Jack?” Claire says.
“I love this song,” the dark-haired bartender says as she pours four shots of vodka.
With tears in his eyes, Dean responds, “That’s not true.”
"What the hell are you doing in my kitchen?"
"It's possible," says Sam. "Maybe he has taken himself out of the narrative, but what if he's helping us still by guiding us through this vision?"
A moment passes and Claire steps forward. "Do whatever you have to do. Let's get this over with."
Dean almost reaches for the book. “Something catch your eye, Dean?”
“Dean,” Sam says, hushing him. “Jack? What’s going on?” Sam walks closer to him.
"You haven't had one of those since you were like in your twenties and yellow eyes was after you. Why the fuck now?"
“Oh, silly! He’s here you just can’t see him with your regular eyes! You need your second pair of eyes,” she says with wonder.
“Whoever is listening, please let this work. With everything that’s happened, this has to work. It needs to work.”
“How does it feel knowing you came all this way to say I love you and it wasn’t good enough?” Dean grimaces as the Shadow connects another fist to his cheek. His left cheek is swollen and bright red.
"Hello, Dean."
"Dean," Sam starts. "You're giving up way too easily. There is always another way. Don't you always say that?" Dean doesn't respond. "I know how it may seem hopeless but we have options. We have the resources to continue the search to save him. You can't give up now, Dean. This is Cas."
"Hey, Sam," he replies, still eyeing the jar.
Dean glances to both her left and right. Both spots are empty. “No one else is here.”
"I meant pie," Dean confirms with a satisfied smirk. "Now, I'm gonna go eat me some of that pie."
i really enjoyed the end result of this chapter, but it was a bitch getting it all together lol I have a feeling everyone will be happy by the end of it :)
Everyone gathers in the infirmary to prepare for the spell. Sam collects a large bowl, some witch hazel, a couple of candles, the artifact, the book containing the incantation, and the syringe for the extraction. Eileen stands next to Sam as he lights the candles. Claire and Kaia sit at the far end of the room, spectating.
He grimaces at the bottle, squeezes the neck so hard his knuckles blanche, and throws it across the room, into the kitchen. It lands by the island, shattering to pieces, with a deafening crash. Dean feels his eyes burning and hot tears gathering at the corners. Before he realizes, Dean is grabbing all the glass bottles and throwing them into the kitchen. In his fit of rage, Dean throws one bottle too high and it shatters against the side of the kitchen table. Glass spreads across the floor. He doesn't even register the intensity of the mess until one bottle knocks off another, shattering it at his feet. He stops throwing the bottles, breaking from his trance.
Dean swirls the dark-honey tinted liquor in his glass. He flicks his eyebrows up before taking a swig. “I have a long drive tomorrow. I need to get some rest.”
"What is that?" Sam raises an eyebrow.
Dean had hoped the alcohol would impair his subconscious enough to avoid the nightmare. Beer hasn't been strong enough, nor tequila, or vodka. Whiskey is his last resort and apparently it does jack-shit.
"I'm starving," he says, marching toward the kitchen.
Dean sighs, and face palms. He's too exhausted to whip up a recap at the moment. Jody quickly runs down a summary of the situation at hand - Castiel being in the Empty, Jack being the new God, and the brothers working to save Castiel.
He grabs his head and shakes the images away. Groaning in pain, he sees he's on the floor. He must have fallen while the vision took over. Eileen is at his side, freaked out. She's signing, "Are you okay?" over and over again.
"Yea." Sam breathes.
Dean quickly turns at the sound, almost losing balance. “What the hell?”
“You can’t win this, Dean,” the Shadow laughs. “I’m an undead cosmic being, and you’re a pathetic human.”
"I know about Cas." Dean's eyes widen slightly. "At least I know there's more to the story. You didn't tell me everything and I know whatever happened is eating away at you." Dean gestures to dismiss Sam. "Dean, I know you. I can see it. I know when you get like this it's because of something close to you." Sam pauses. "I also read some of your crumpled up papers." A dark look crosses Dean's face. Almost like he wants to punch Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean's eyes are closed, begging for sleep as he nods. "Yea."
There is a secret stash of whiskey in his man cave that Dean hid for emergencies. And this constitutes an emergency. He walks to the wall, removes a Star Wars poster from the fifth movie, and pulls out a few bricks, revealing the beautiful brown bottle of Jack Daniel's. Not his favorite but Dean was in a rush when he bought it a couple of weeks ago before they defeated Chuck just in case anything went sideways. Also, in case Sam found his stash at least it wouldn't be his good whiskey. Popping the cap off, Dean takes a long swig as he stumbles toward the couch. Sam should be home soon.
Castiel sneers in response. The image is so jarring to Dean that he has to swallow down a gasp. “No, it is. You don’t know all the times the angels tried to make me something I wasn’t. They never accepted me. You and Sam never did either. The pathetic thing is the lengths I would go for you. For Sam. For Jack. I used to think my sacrifices meant something since my life didn’t. That meeting you meant something. Now, I realize what a collasal mistake that was.”
Underneath, one of the books has a bookmark in three different places. There are a few crumpled up papers on the desk and around the floor. Sam picks one up and unravels it.
“It’s hard to explain. Just see for yourself, if you’re interested,” she trails off.
This story is evolving to something bigger than just a fix-it fic....oops. I didn't have anything in this chapter in mind until I starter writing lol but angst/pain is where my heart is content. Then followed with a happy ending. So buckle up :)
. He's thinking of "I love you's" and "Goodbye, Dean" and black goo. He's thinking of how the image of his best friend disappearing into a black mass of nothing is seared in his memory forever. He's thinking of how he didn't get to say goodbye, or anything really, and now he never will.
Dean shuffles down the staircase of the bunker, and is met with a warm welcome from Miracle. He grins as he barks in greeting and jumps up, twirling around with excitement. “Okay, boy,” he coos, trying to calm down Miracle. “When was the last time someone gave you any attention?” He kneels down and rubs both sides of the dog’s face. Dean looks around, scanning the library. It’s vacant aside for the books piled on the tables and thrown haphazardly on the floor. “Sam? Eileen?” Miracle whines, and Dean ruffles the top of his head before standing.
Sam searches Dean's face for any kind of sign of self actualization or will to live. "Why does it matter? I can still strive for that with you alive. We both can," he adds.
I hope you guys are liking it! Let me know what ya think :)
Dean clicks the arrow for the next page, and it shows an error message. His brow creases  in confusion. He clicks the refresh button and the message appears again. He clicks four more times. The message remains on the page. Dean grows frustrated. He slams the laptop shut and stands.
He clears his throat, making his presence known. "Claire, are you sure about this"
“You can take my bed. I have to go to work in an hour,” Alex offers, drying a pan.
“So,” Dean starts.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hm,” he replies.
Lucian accepts the photo and closes his eyes. "This should do just fine. I detect enough power in this photo." The warlock collects a wooden bowl, some bones from the human skull Dean notices earlier, a handful of witch hazel, and a small empty jar. Lucian places the picture of Castiel to the side. Dean doesn't recognize the language the warlock mumbles as he tosses the ingredients into the bowl. Mist begins to roll above and out from inside. Lucian picks up a jagged knife from the desk and slices his palm. A few drops of blood fall upon the picture. Dean gives him a puzzled look.
“Are you kidding me? I’ve been calling you for weeks! Bring him back!” Dean marches to Jack, completely dismissing the spell.
Castiel can feel the surge of power from the Mark of Cain. He’s fought its influence for months but the last few weeks have become unbearable. His grace is dwindling and he can feel himself changing as the Mark slowly consumes him. Demonic whispers of violence and murder fill his head. Castiel claps his hands on his ears, trying to smother them out but they only intensify.
“I’m sorry what was that?”
“Oh yes, Castiel. Castiel, the angel who defied Heaven and lost everything. The angel so love-sick with humanity he couldn't be a good soldier anymore. The angel so
The young girl plays with a strand of her greasy hair, and looks to her right. Dean snaps his fingers in front of her. “Hey!”
"Sam," he warns. "mind your business."
"I said no Sam."
******
Eyeing her, Jack grins. “I'll guide you. I can't intervene but I'll tell you what to do."
Dean licks his lips. His mind is swirling with apprehension, yearning, and disdain. Every fiber of his being knows this is wrong. Every nerve fires off throughout his body, telling him to turn around and leave- go home. And yet, he stays. The house creaks in silence and it makes Dean's stomach turn. The smell of incense lingers in the air. It reminds Dean of moments after a rainstorm. When the atmosphere is still thick with moisture and grass drips with the afterthoughts of the storm.
in his head for a few moments. But he's met with silence like every other time. Dean accepts this and wipes his tears away, picks the cart up, grabs the broom and dustpan from the kitchen and picks up his mess. He can't have Sam see what a hypocrite he truly has become.
“And what exactly is it?”
"I don't know. I'm just thinking about Cas, about Jack."
Dean drives and drives and drives. He has no destination, but right now the road is welcoming. He runs his hand across the Impala’s steering wheel, slick, smooth and familiar. He almost forgets the feeling of driving his Baby. The trees and asphalt blur in his vision. The only thing Dean focuses on are the yellow lines on the road, but even those begin to blur as well. Dean squeezes his eyes shut for a moment and azure eyes stare back at him.
"I see. With your friend on another plane of existence, meaning not on Earth, it makes things more difficult. My hallucination spell can possibly break the boundaries, but it may be painful." Lucian looks up and down Dean. "But I'm sure you could handle it. The tea won't allow you to converse with him. You'll only see him. I can also throw together a spell. I will need a few objects from you, though." Dean squints at the warlock.
Dean glances back and forth, unsure of the answer.
Sam grabs the coin on the table and holds it out to him. "Both of you come back in one piece, alright?"
The demon saunters toward Dean with a smirk. “Hm, maybe.” Dean’s face lightens up.
. Wiping his nose with his sleeve, Dean notices a few tear stains on his shirt.
Eileen's face falls as she holds a plate of french toast, bacon, sausage, and lots of syrup. Then one plate of regular scrambled eggs with toast for Sam. She sits the plates on the table and watches Dean leave. "Is he not hungry? I made his favorite." She says.
“What do you mean you know a guy? Like drugs?”
"It is. I'm the one that dragged you back into this life, Sam. I'm the only one keeping you here. Let me give you an out."
Dean stares at Lucian. The air grows thick as silence clouds the room. Lucian is smirking at Dean. “I’m not selling my soul to you.”
“The hell are you thinking? I told you to leave this shit alone. We have a way to save, Cas!” Dean says, voice steady and his jaw tense as he advances toward Sam.
“Eileen found it. She and Sam have been the brains behind this operation. I’ve been-I’ve been dealing,” Dean says, avoiding Castiel’s eyes. His guilt and shame rise to his throat, bubbling like acid.
Nodding, Dean makes his way to the portal and carefully steps through. Swirling darkness engulfs him as the passage to the Empty processes his entrance. His head continues to spin from the spell and confusion overcomes him as unfamiliar images of Castiel begin to form in his consciousness. Castiel standing before him crying and saying something. Then, clear as a bell, "I love you," and the memory of the confession comes rushing back.
Jack looks to the side, as if he’s looking to someone for reassurance. Amara appears in front of Jack, visible only to him, and nods. “You need to stop the spell.”
Claire gets up from the table and pauses. “Whatever, it’s not like he was my dad or anything.” She turns and marches upstairs.
“I think Heaven is strictly for human souls, and the angels watch over them until they die,” Jody reassures Alex.
Dean reaches down for the same pie again but his face is met with a cold surface. Sam smothers the pumpkin pie in Dean's face, laughing. "You know what, I do feel better!"
Dean gets up, signaling he's done with this conversation and takes the notepad with him. He doesn't even acknowledge Eileen as she brings breakfast to the library. "The case is pulled up on my laptop. I'm going to get ready." Dean turns the corner and is gone before Sam can reply.
“Cas,” his name is breathless and tight. Constricting his throat tighter, Castiel’s eyes are blank with rage. “Stop, please,” Dean gasps as his eyelids flutter.
“What have we here?” The demon peers around to face Dean. “A Winchester. Well, I feel honored.” The demon is possessing some young twenty year old kid, most likely a college student. He was probably Sam’s age when I pulled him from law school, Dean thinks. The demon straightens his dark suit jacket as Dean eyes him carefully. “So, are we just going to have a staring contest or do you have an offer to make?”
Suddenly, he feels his stomach growl and Dean realizes he hasn't eaten since about noon today.
Jack walks to Claire, and stops at her side. He faces the brothers and Eileen. "She's the tether." He points to Claire.
“Thanks,” he lifts his glass up in appreciation and then takes a drink. The liquid burns as it flows down. He sucks a breath between his teeth and releases it slowly. “Damn.”
“Something like that. I do offer other services as well.” Dean gives him a strange look. “Get your mind out of the gutter, Dean. I mean magic. I provide services other than the intoxication of magic.”
“What? No! We’re getting out of here together!”
"Why are you so cold?"
She shushes him. “Yes, like drugs. Jesus, you don’t have to announce it. Cops come in here all the time.” Dean swallows the last of his whiskey.
Dean downs the remainder of his whiskey and orders another glass. “Damn, you’re pretty popular tonight with the ladies. Though, I can’t say I don’t blame them,” the bartender says.
Eileen blushes and laughs at Dean. "I don't kiss and tell," she winks at Sam as she kisses him on the cheek. "Who wants breakfast?"
Several miles pass and Eileen surrenders in her attempts to understand what's happening. So, she opts to stare out the passenger window, withdrawing her attention from the road. When a sudden jerk from the Impala forces her to the side, it causes her to shriek in surprise. Dean zooms forward and whips around in front of another vehicle, stopping it - stopping Sam. Tires screech against the asphalt, leaving rubber burns. The Impala is parked sideways, blocking both lanes of the road, but Dean disregards it. Both brothers hop out of their vehicles.
“Cas, no. It’s really me. I’m here to take you home,” Dean pleads. The stream running through his chest, connecting him and Claire, tugs and burns hot. He turns back to the flowing light, struggling to hold the connection.
After a moment, Dean’s eyes open. He coughs from the pressure around his throat. “Might want to lay off the spinach there, Popeye.”
For a moment, Dean sees a flash of contentment then the angel shakes his head. “No. I know humans can’t exist here. The real Dean, my Dean, couldn’t be here.”
“He can’t! He’s mine, Dean. Our deal is unbreakable. Non-negotiable. One angelic being for another. You’re little journey was all for nothing.” Meg’s voice taunts.
“I want to talk to Rowena," he demands.
Dean. And you're
“And they can heal people with it, right?” Kaia asks, and Dean nods in return, his eyebrow creased, curious where she is going with this. “Could someone have angel grace, but not be an angel?”
Castiel eyes Dean with a knowing, sorrowful look. “Dean, I didn’t mean to hurt you with what I confessed. I’m sorry.”
“Dammit,” he whispers to himself.
"I don’t care about your opinion. I’m in this now." Dean glances at Jody, pleading for help. She shrugs, knowing there is no stopping Claire Novak when she has her mind set on something. “How does the spell work?”
“No," he gently sits the coin down and looks to Dean. "Your intention with Michael’s grace was to compress its power and rip open a portal to the Empty. That would have destroyed his grace and you’d have lost your tether. Your connection back to Earth and you’d die before you even stepped into the Empty,” Jack retorts.
Dean shakes his head. “No, no. Doesn’t work.” He mutters to himself. Dean runs his fingers up and down the glass, mindlessly.
“So what exactly does this spell do?” Claire asks.
Kaia hesitates before continuing. “I told Claire we should call Jody, but she insisted we could handle a few vampires. A few turned into a nest and things got complicated.”
He quietly shuts the front door and is back on the highway toward Lebanon. Dean pockets his phone and dials Sam’s number.
“Right, but Michael, a fucking archangel, flaunted my ass - twice. There’s gotta be some juice left in me. It’s worth a shot,” he sounds almost hopeful.
“And what high price do these poor bastards have to pay you?”
“Hey!” Castiel yells, turning the Shadow toward him, piercing the diamond into its chest, disrupting it.
Dean stands and laughs with a bitter shake of his head. "You honestly believe that? Come on, Sam. The kid has a new sense of almighty. We, you, me and Cas, we are now left in the dust. He said so himself. You're just having some freak migraine."
“Then we’ll cross that bridge.” Dean pats his brother on the cheek and gives him a knowing look. “Come on.” All three separate into the two vehicles. Dean in the Impala, Eileen and Sam in the other.
Sam glances between Claire and Dean. “What an unexpected surprise. Hey guys.”
“I want to see, Cas,” he finally blurts out. He relaxes his shoulders. Dean doesn't notice he had them raised slightly.
"What kind of spell?"
Dean’s eyes flick back and forth between the demon’s, searching for a hint of deceit. “The fuck does that mean?”
Dean slowly sits up, removing his feet from the table. He swallows, and glances around the room. Eileen and Sam are giggling quietly. She shoves his arm in response to Sam’s remark. Dean pulls the laptop closer to him, and continues to read.
Dean has realized his mood swings are ridiculous lately. At one moment, he's super depressed and doesn't care about anything. He honestly doesn't care if he lives or dies.  The next moment he can't wait to see what life has to offer. It's as if his brain doesn't know how to comprehend what Castiel's sacrifice means to him. His thoughts can become so tangled and incoherent Dean doesn't know how to act - what to say. That's why he started writing down some of his thoughts, and then thought how much of girl that made him and crumpled the papers up. Right now, he can really use a moment to write down his thoughts.
“Okay. What exactly was it? Kaia and I-”
“What can I get for ya?” A petite, dark headed woman with bright, blue eyes asks from behind the bar. She actually resembles Pamela Barnes in some aspects. That makes Dean smile earnestly.
"Fine," Claire deadpans, looking at Dean in her peripheral. He’s mindlessly twirling a lump of spaghetti, staring at the gap forming on his plate.
“Cas, please. You don’t want to do this. This isn’t you.” Dean holds his hands up in surrender as Castiel looms over an unconscious, bloody Sam.
"What?"
Lucian drops his hands and Dean slumps to the floor. His eyes flick across the room as thoughts swirl his brain.
Dean releases the demon, slowly in bewilderment. “What?” He says more to himself.
"No." Dean can hardly stand from the high of the spell.
trigger warning for my attempt at a sensual scene lmao it's not heavy at all
“And the grace?”
******
“Hey!” Dean says.
The demon dramatically turns, as if he needs to walk away when he can just teleport. “Wait,” whispers Dean.
“Claire!” Kaia rushes closer, dying to hold her.
"No, see I know my baby brother. So I know that is your sad Sam face. Fess up, what's wrong?"
"Good morning," Eileen joins the boys in the library.
Lucian nods. "So, you want to speak to him? Hm, that makes things more interesting. Is this friend of yours on the same existing plane?" Dean eyes him. "So not the veil. Heaven?" Dean doesn't answer. "Hell perhaps?" Dean glances to the side. Guilt rises in his throat.
“Dean, I understand your anger. But I’m more than just my old self now. It was difficult to find a balance. But with some help, I think I know now.”
Dean’s eyes widen and his expression falters. “No, no. No, it’s just me.” He sighs. The sound of Castiel’s voice saying, “I love you” replays in Dean’s head. “Why?”
Dean jerks up, shaking his head from thoughts of sleep. "I found us a case," he replies.
The demon stops, tilting his head. “She doesn’t take house calls.”
His bottom lip shakes in hesitation as he stutters. "I just need to see him. I have to tell him something," he speaks softly.
“I can handle it.”
“So a part of Castiel has been with me this whole time? He saved me.” She looks at Kaia.
Standing up, facing the Shadow, Dean deadpans at its remark. “Eat me, Nickelodeon.”
Breathing heavily, clutching his chest, he looks up at Claire. The blue light follows Dean's movements as he slowly stands. "You need to hurry, Dean." Jack reminds him.
He slows the car and pulls over. It's quiet. The Impala's headlights shine ahead, revealing an empty road. A bit of fog hangs loose above the ground. Dean sighs. He needs to get out of his head. There are too many thoughts and he feels like he wants to scream. Dean picks up his cell phone and pulls up Castiel's contact. His finger idles over the call button. Click. The line rings. And rings. And rings. And rings. There's a pause before the recorded voicemail answers.
Dean finishes the last three slices of pizza, underestimating how hungry he had been. He watches a few dumb YouTube videos for a while, to keep his mind off things, waiting for Sam to wake up. Dean is tempted to grab a beer from the fridge but decides against it. He needs to be as sober as possible for the hunt, for Sam. If Dean were to go alone, he would not care. Not at this moment anyway.
"What was that?"
“Yea, I’m getting the whiskey,” Alex says, standing up.
Sam stands, with Eileen in tow. She helps him up by the arm. "You're wrong. I know he's not like Chuck, and stays away, but he still cares. I know he sent me this vision to help us. All of us," Sam stares at Dean's glare of hopelessness. "I have faith, Dean."
******
Yawning, Sam says, "What are you doing in here? You should be in bed."
"Didn't we-Dean we just had breakfa- nevermind," Sam gives in and follows Dean through the crowd.
"I just can't," he says, defeated. "All my memories are important."
Dean ponders his answer and let's it slide. He picks up one of the pies and offers it to his brother. Sam declines. "Dude, you gotta at least try it."
Castiel scoffs. Dean grabs his cheeks and stares intensely. “Listen, I’m not leaving without you. I’ll carry you over my damn shoulder if I have to. We’ve fought our way through worse. Right? I’m not going to let some slimy pile of shit stop us.” Dean smiles, trying to reach Castiel.
Dean's head is still somewhat fuzzy and heavy. His ears are no longer ringing and his vision is back to normal.
Alex laughs and sets the tray of toasted garlic bread on the stove top. Kaia is setting the table as she looks toward the front door. Claire joins her before squeezing her arm lightly and planting a kiss on Kaia's cheek. Dean catches the gesture and glances at Jody, who is smiling earnestly. Removing her oven mit, adding a few extra touches to the spaghetti, Alex announces dinner is ready. Jody pulls out a bottle of wine and five glasses. She usually doesn't like the girl's drinking underage, but due to circumstances it's fitting.
Apprehension flows through her veins thick and heavy. She glances down and motions to speak but uncertainty dries the words in her throat and she struggles to meet Dean's eyes.
"You don't need to say anything."
A few clicks and searches show there's a local mysterious killing.
“When an angel possesses a human, they leave behind traces of their grace.” Then, Dean has an epiphany.
He wipes a hand across his face, trying to erase the images of Dean saying goodbye, of Dean's hand dropping as he took his last breath, and the image of lighting his own brother's pyre.
“She just needs time,” Alex says and begins to clear the table.
"Wait. You said angel grace?" Kaia inquires.
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice...a mail." A tear falls down Dean's cheek. He needs to hear Castiel's real voice. He needs to see him again. Touch him.
“Let’s hope that doesn’t happen.” Jack’s face is somber as he eyes Claire.
Dean places the pen next to the notepad after a moment. He wipes his nose with his flannel sleeve. Not many tears fell but his nose is running pretty good. Out of all of his thought entries, this one felt the most cathartic. He sometimes pretends that Castiel can hear him read the words to himself or even hear him as Dean writes the words. Just as Castiel heard his prayer in Purgatory. But he doesn't. He won't. The empty is a dark and torturous place.
"Stop. Okay just stop. We are not going on this hunt. If you want to be suicidal, fine, but I'm keeping you out of danger. You are always so quick to jump in front of a gun or blade. Do you still care that little about yourself, Dean?" Sam searches his brother's eyes. "What about that job paperwork on your desk? You must have cared at some point. Wanted to live!" Dean is quiet. Sam sighs. "Cas wouldn't want you to die. He died to save you, remember? So, what I am going to do is bring Cas back. Are you going to help me?"
Still giggling, the girl looks toward Dean. Her eyes are black from the enlarged pupils. Dean wouldn’t even know the color of her iris’. “You don’t meet him, silly. Not with that anyway.” She points to his hand.
“Besides, we have no way of knowing if that was the last of it. For all we know, it could have been depleting over the years and that was the last of its mojo. Not worth the risk.” Dean finishes off his whiskey. “Cas, wouldn’t want you dying for him,” he says softly.
“So that, that whole thing outside, it was just-”
But now Chuck is gone, so this is real.
Sam pulls the covers off and walks toward the kitchen for a glass of water. The bunker is quiet, peaceful even. He still hasn't gotten used to calling it home, not really. The thing about a home is, four walls don't constitute it. Family is similar. It's not based on who you're related to but who loves you and has your back. Family, a home, whatever they are things you build around you. He had learned that long ago.
Once again, he calls Castiel. Even though it's pointless. Even though he looks like a widower who can't let go. He calls Cas. The voicemail picks up again and Dean listens but he decides to not hang up. Not yet. The dial beeps, waiting for a voicemail to be recorded and Dean is still. He breathes in, motioning to speak, but stops. He hangs up. Anger rises in his chest.
Dean isn't too surprised to see her here but is happy for Sam nonetheless. "Morning, Eileen. I hope sasquatch here didn't take up the whole bed."
“Hello.” Jack appears before them, with his hand raised in greeting.
Dean reaches a curled up Castiel, disheveled and bloody. His trench coat and suit are ripped to shreds, revealing deep gashes on his skin. Halting in his tracks, Dean gapes at the site of Castiel. He is motionless, and small under Dean’s gaze. His heart stops, afraid he’s possibly too late. Then, a painful cough escapes past the angel’s lips.
The paper becomes wet with a few tear drops.
He eyes the pointed end, and swallows. “God, I hate needles.”
"Because in this hunt you die, Dean," Sam blurts out. Dean stays quiet. "You die and I have to go on without you. You leave me and I have to live a life without my brother."
“Well, then no more time to waste,” Dean says and positions the needle above his arm. He slowly injects it, and withdraws a large amount of grace, filling the entire syringe. He retracts the needle, and begins to feel lightheaded. “Think this is enough?”
“With all the research we have been doing, it’s been a bit difficult to keep up with groceries. So we didn’t have anything to eat. He’ll be back soon.”
do you provide?” He changes the subject.
“We go way back. It’s important. Take me to her.” He states plainly.
"I can sense it. There isn't much, so Dean will have to work quickly to find Cas." Jack turns to Claire, his eyes somber. "I have to let you know this won't be easy. It will be painful. The remaining grace will act as a conduit to another dimension full of pain and despair. That will flow through you, and you two will be connected. The further he goes-"
“Everything mystical or cosmic related. I know a great amount. It was my job at one point. Where did you even find it? Last I saw of that, Abraham was tossing it into a river. Not sure who gave it to him.”
"We're ready," Sam calls to them. Claire looks at Kaia and they share a longing look, eyes buried deep with love, understanding but masked with concern.
"Why?"
It’s knuckles land on Dean’s face again, with another incoming but he blocks it. Dean gains the upper hand once more, throwing a few punches until the Shadow twists his arm, pulling him to the ground. He grimaces as white-hot pain shoots through his arm. Castiel remains weak and motionless. His chest tightens with agony as he’s forced to watch Dean suffer. The Shadow kneels above Dean with a sadistic grin, gripping his jaw. “I’m going to enjoy this.”
“No! Dammit, Dean. This is how you and your brother always complicate things. Just accept this and put me in a damn box.” Castiel squeezes his eyes, feeling the power of the Mark rise again.
"I-I don't know. I thought it was a nightmare, but last night the same images played in my mind. I went all day yesterday feeling a sense of deja vu. The pie fest, reading the case, even eating breakfast."
“Hey, sweetheart do you have anything stronger?”
Dean takes in her appearance.
“I hope so.” Sam grabs the syringe and starts to twist off the needle but stops. He looks up in shock.
“We’re almost there.”
“What are you talking about?” Claire asks.
“Dean, you don’t belong here. I made my decision to save Jack and I would do it again,” he grins. Tears form in both of their eyes. Pulled apart once more, but Dean shakes his head, refusing to accept it. “I appreciate you saying it back,” Castiel softly says.
"My blood is the key ingredient. It helps bind us, so we stay connected during the spell," he clarifies.
He knows it is a long shot but everything else is coming up dry. He scrolls down swiftly reading the pages, when something piques his interest.
The room is silent. Dean and Jody are both glaring at Claire, but with a hint of relief and confusion. Alex is pouring her third glass of wine. Dean begins to reach for his whiskey in his jacket pocket, until he remembers what is actually inside. Claire finally makes eye contact with Jody. “Is anyone going to say anything?”
"I'm not-" Sam begins, but Dean gives him a look.
******
“I did.”
“She’s in pain!” Kaia cries.
Sam twists the needle from the syringe and pours the grace into the bowl, mixing it with the other ingredients. The contents form a mist upon contact. Before starting, Sam looks to Eileen and she nods. "In antiquis regnum et tenebrae recludo coram!" Sam recites. The Enochian on the artifact glows red hot and the diamond shape pops up. The mixture in the bowl begins to boil and the mist flows up, swirling high then stops. A bright, white stream of light shoots up from the center of the bowl and passes between Dean and Claire. Stopping five feet away, a rippling goo begins to form. The portal opens.
A moment of recognization crosses Castiel’s face and he immediately lets go. “Oh, god. Dean?” He shakes Dean slightly. “Dean!”
Dean is taken aback. “No, Cas. This is real.
"No, I need to go back! I didn't get to tell him. I hardly said anything! Take me back!" He demands.
Claire crosses her arms, and rolls her eyes. “I can be of more use than that, and you know it.”
“Do you have access to the Empty? Can you make deals that involve it?”
Twenty minutes after Claire’s nose bleeds, no more incidents develop. Kaia’s knee shakes anxiously, awaiting Dean and Castiel’s return. Her heart cannot bear the thought of losing Claire again. Suddenly, the flowing light flickers and Claire convulses. Everyone jumps up, running to her.
Dean stares down the demon. His green eyes flashing a dark olive with anger. His jaw clenches and he tightens his fists. Dean lunges forward, gripping at the demon’s collar and slams him against the Impala. He leans in, almost nose to nose as the demon smirks.
"It wasn't enough time. I need more. Do it again!" Lucian ignores Dean's demands. "I said, do it again dammit!"
“A mirage, yes. Don’t assume I’m some type of deceiver, Dean. I need all my clients to be willing. I offer a one in a lifetime experience. I take consent seriously. Also, I’m against violence,” Lucian says pouting his bottom lip.
“Stop saying that!”
Realization crosses Dean’s face.
Jack lowers his gaze. “I know. I’m sorry, Dean. My choices have been uncharacteristic. I see that now.”
Dean slowly sips down the blue liquid. His head becomes fuzzy, he starts seeing double, and suddenly he feels the warlock grab both sides of his head. All of Dean's senses disappear. He can't feel his body. He's floating. Like in his dream. The ribbon is carrying him again, except he's surrounded by darkness. And he doesn't feel warm. Everything is cold. Dean flutters his eyelids open and is alone. Castiel isn't here.
A white-hot pain shoots through Castiel’s right arm, causing him to lose composure. He grasps his arm and doubles over. Dean wants to reach out to him, but is afraid. He’s afraid of his best friend. Then the pain is gone almost as soon as it erupted. Castiel straightens up and his gaze is dark.
"Cas," he breathes. Not able to reach out or hug him yet. Dean blinks and sees two Castiel's for a moment. He shakes his head to clear his vision. "I have so much I want to say."
“Something told me to bring my Dead Man’s blood nail bomb. It slowed them down, but,” Kaia steals a glance at Claire. “Not without Claire getting hurt. I got out in time, thinking she was right behind me. I turned back to the warehouse and she wasn’t there. So I started to panic and ran back inside. The vamps were mostly cowering in pain, except one had Claire pinned.” Kaia tucks her hair behind her ear, and swallows deeply. Dean sits up, concerned even though Claire is sitting right in front of him. Kaia recounts that evening.
He tosses his duffle bag on the war table and advances through the bunker, carefully stepping through the maze of books. As he passes each room, Dean is met with silence. There are no signs of a struggle. “Sam!” Reaching for his phone, rounding the corner of the hallway, he hears soft laughter. Dean walks toward the sound. It’s coming from his man cave where light from the TV illuminates the room. Inside, Eileen is texting while Pineapple Express plays on the screen, audio silent replaced with subtitles.
******
"Cas?" Eileen offers. Sam nods.
Kaia’s gaze follows her. “I-I’m gonna go check on her.”
“Take me,” Dean steps forward.
“We’re not discussing it. Sam, get the supplies ready for the extraction. Eileen, keep an eye on these two. I’ll be back.” On the ride home, Sam explained Dean’s plan to Eileen. That he possibly has fragments of grace from the archangel Michael, and is willing to undergo the extraction process. She is still somewhat puzzled by the procedure but quickly adapting.
“Circumstances were different,” he pauses. “We don’t have anything on the reaper’s blood. This is it. We’re so close to the finish line, Sammy. I need you with me on this.” A beat. “Sam?”
“What? No, it’s fine. Watch whatever you want. Speaking of Sam, where is he?”
"Her connection? You mean the angel grace?" Kaia asks, and Jack nods. "We weren't sure she had any left in her."
Dean's gaze falls to the floor. He's quiet for a moment, processing this information. "You live a happy life?" He barely says.
"Yeah, me too," Sam perks up. "I think I found something that screams our kinda thing. We should head there after we eat breakfast. It's not too long of a drive." Dean finishes as he places the cooked bacon on some paper towels and grins from ear to ear. Sam just watches as his brother starts on some scrambled eggs.
“Stop! Okay, just stop. I’m tired of your games. I know this isn’t real,” he sits up, with exhaustion written on his face.
"No offense or anything, you are cute, but you look like shit. I see a lot of people, everyday, and I’m pretty good at reading people - comes with the job. I can tell you’re hurting. I won’t begin to guess who hurt you or what, but,” she trails off. “To be honest, it looks like you've been to Hell and back. I am just asking because you look like you could use a pick me up." She leans forward, speaking softly, "I can get you something stronger than whiskey. Not me personally, but I know a guy.”
Lucian nods. “Cas? Is he a friend?”
"At least enough until you feel the effects of the spell begin."
"He hasn't answered any of my damn prayers since two months ago. Why would he start now?"
"No, really I'm good."
“Fuck,” he says under his breath. Dean grabs Castiel by the arm and helps him into the Ma'lak box. He clenches his jaw as he stares down at his best friend, knowing this is the last time they’ll be together. “Wait, I just need to say something. I love you too, Cas.”
"I'll do it." They say simultaneously. Dean gives Claire a look.
“Oh, uh, no lucky lady.”
Dean shakes his head, processing it again. Every emotion he experienced in that moment smothers him as the blanket of darkness clears and he steps into the Empty.
Dean grabs a hand towel and wraps it around his left hand before returning to the broom. The kitchen is just about clean. Within about 5 minutes, all the glass and spilled whiskey is gone. Almost as if it never happened. Dean places the broom and dustpan back in the corner and trudges through the hallways.
Forks scrape against glass plates in silence. Alex glances between everyone before her, feeling the tension, unaware of the situation. Kaia places her hand on Claire's thigh, silently asking if she's alright through concerned eyes. Claire doesn't respond in any form and doesn't need to. Kaia already knows the answer. Tearing a piece of garlic bread off, Alex asks, "How was the hunt?"
Dean clenches his jaw. "I don't know. Not all angels were good. A lot of them were dicks, but I don't know if that constitutes them going to Hell."
Then, a flash of images of Sam and Dean dressed in their normal FBI threads quickly blink by. Another image of them at an abandoned barn fighting some strange, masked creatures. Sam recognizes the mask from Dad's journal. And then a burst of images, showing Sam and Dean fighting these creatures appear. They're vampires! The brothers are winning, slicing the vamp's heads off one after another. The last image shows Dean pushed against something sharp and…
"So there's a Hell for angels?" Kaia says absentmindedly. She glances at Claire and then Dean.
"Alright, what is it? What's got you so down today?"
"I have this picture. I don't have any of his belongings though," he says slowly and extends his hand. His gaze never leaves the picture.
The demon remains unprovoked. Dean pulls out the demon knife, threatening him. Eyeing the blade, the demon answers. “Alright, alright. I don’t know this for certain. I have just heard rumors, okay. Demons talking. But apparently Rowena was visited by the new God.”
Castiel and Dean watch the Shadow gasp for air as its original dark form materializes and slowly crystallizes, freezing it in place. The two share a look before Dean steps forward and lightly pushes the frozen statue. Slowly, it falls to the ground into pieces. Dean huffs in surprise and glances at Castiel, both smiling. The two, finally alone and reunited after everything, share a look before wrapping their arms around one another. Dean squeezes his eyes shut, pulling the angel as close as possible. Castiel, eyes blissful, clenches onto Dean’s jacket. They stay close like that for a long moment, neither one wanting to let go. Then, sudden vibrations erupt throughout the Empty, throwing the pair off balance.
Dean's head feels like he went ten rounds in the ring and lost. His ears are ringing. "What did you do to me?"
"Uh, yeah." He's not honestly sure if everything is okay.
“Careful now, Dean I like it rough," the demon taunts.
"Mhm. Is that all you were looking for during the early morning?" Sam asks, eyeing the covered notepad. Dean notices and quickly turns it over.
"That's my only offer."
Footsteps echo as Dean joins the group. He glances between everyone, staring back at him. The silence is deafening, with apprehension cloaking the room. Dean plasters on a fake grin and walks up to the table. He reaches down and carefully picks up the large syringe.
Dean smirks. There was a time when he would never admit to liking this song, but not anymore. “I love this song too,” he agrees.
Sam texts Eileen and tells her he wants to make up for the date they missed months ago. She agrees it has been too long and tonight would work for her. Sam doesn't want to make promises, as the day is still young, but they plan for their date tonight at 7. Dean teases Sam about it even though the two are already a couple. Saying things like, "don't do anything I wouldn't do" or "make sure you use protection." Sam just sighs and shakes his head.
Dean has an internal war within himself on whether he should pack it up and go or replace his weapon and follow the strange girl.
“What’s the difference?” Dean asks, eyeing the necromancy book as Lucian flips it over and over. His throat feels dry. His palms are tingling and it’s not alcohol this time.
"Son of a bitch! What the hell was that?" He says, straightening up, regaining his composure.
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice...a mail." Dean closes his eyes at the sound of Castiel’s voice. He only speaks for two seconds but Dean hears every syllable. His brow creases and he clenches his jaw to bury the pain. Dean hangs up. He calls again.
"I've tried everything I can think of, Sam. Everything! Praying, research, calling Rowena. She doesn't answer. Jack is off grid. I've tried! There's nothing. He's gone!" Dean's voice cracks. He swallows down the pain. "We have to accept that. And however I deal with it is my business. So don't give me those judgy eyes like you are now." Dean says pointedly.
"I tried everything! I can't save you! There's nothing left! How could you do this to me, you son of a bitch," Dean cries. He places his hands on either side of his head, thinking. "Jack! How can you just leave us? We need you. Cas needs you! Fuck this all powerful, all knowing God bullshit. We're family!" Dean tosses the cart over. "Isn't that enough?" He pauses and glances around for a moment. Nothing. "Dammit, Jack. Why won't you answer my prayers? I need some help!" He cries out and slowly sits down. "I can't do this on my own," he whispers between his sniffles. He begs over and over again
An excruciating sting spreads through Dean’s chest as the Shadow presses down. It’s fingers deepen into his skin like claws. He cries out in pain, wincing. Castiel yells, “Dean!”
Dean glances between Eileen and Sam. Fiddling with a loose string on the end of his flannel sleeve, he sighs. On one hand, he'd love to see Castiel again. He'd do anything- to hug him and tell him all the things he didn't get to say. But on the other hand, he's so tired. So very tired. There are no leads. And he's lost all faith in his search to save Castiel.
"I couldn't pick just one! Come on, Sammy we're at a pie fest. What do you take me for?"
Holding her wine glass with both hands, Alex stares at the middle of the table - overwhelmed. "If angels are from Heaven, wouldn't they just go to another Heavenly realm in death? Why would they go to a hellish dimension when they die? They're supposed to be good. Doesn’t make sense." Tears almost form in her eyes as she wonders how the hell could she make it to Heaven if an angel can't.
"Me?"
“Jack?” Sam says in disbelief.
Dean reaches into his wallet and pulls out a wrinkled picture of Castiel. He's standing against Dean's bedroom door, almost blushing. The memory of Dean wanting all three of them to wear ugly sweaters for Christmas one year begins playing.
Sam continues, ignoring Dean's comment. "I know you're trying to bring Cas back. I want to help," Sam offers.
Sam turns to the portal, stunned. “No. No, no, no, no.” It’s gone.
"Right. Can I have my picture back?" Dean points to the desk where the contents for the spell remain. Lucian gestures him forward.
Dean walks toward the bookshelf. A word on one of the book’s spines stands out to him from the others. He reads the full title as he steps closer,
Dean lays his head on the table from exhaustion, but doesn't shut his eyes. He won't risk falling asleep. Instead, he focuses on counting the books on each shelf to his right. Then, once he's done with those he counts the ones on his left. Dean notices some of these books, he nor Sam even use. He doesn't know half of the content in these books. Unfortunately, Dean underestimated how counting can cause drowsiness no matter the subject at play. His eyes begin to drift when Sam walks in with loud footsteps.
Dean downs the rest of the whiskey and moves to the couch. His head is heavy with exhaustion and mind thick with alcohol. His worries surface as he dwells on the possibility of the spell failing and losing Castiel forever. He dwells on the absence he feels within him and his heart aches. His eyes start to burn behind his eyelids and he clenches his jaw, swallowing his emotions. The kitchen light shuts off and he hears footsteps recede up the stairs. He’s alone, drowning in his thoughts. Dean squeezes his eyes tight, willing sleep to overcome him. Soon, he drifts off into darkness.
A few girls, confidently and bravely, approach Dean periodically throughout the night. Each one, he easily lets down. His younger self would be kicking him right now. In fact, twenty-seven year old Dean would jump at any chance to have sex with all of these women. Now, though, everything is different. The last girl, she has a few too many, becomes a bit too touchy with Dean. He has to continuously remove her hands, but when he glances away in embarrassment, she moves in to kiss him. He doesn’t reciprocate, and the woman pulls back, spilling with apologies. Dean assures her it’s fine and “we’ve all been there.” She nods in acceptance and shuffles away. No more women approach him after that.
“I won’t do anything stupid, Sam.” He walks up the staircase and the bunker door slams.
Claire grins at his naivety and shakes her head. “Nothing.”
“Hello, I’m Eileen,” she introduces, with a small wave, feeling slightly weird.
Sam reads the case on Dean's laptop and begins to feel nauseated. He has a bad feeling. He, again, has a sense of deja vu. Two days in a row, it can't be a coincidence. It's like there is an itch at the back of his brain, crawling to the surface, wanting to show him something. He feels a headache come on and the pain is similar to when he used to get visions as a young adult. The pain grows stronger as the itch continues, pulling toward his frontal lobe.
"I'm not- it's nothing. I just needed a drink. A break from research, but I'm on my way home." Sam huffs, tells his brother to be careful and they hang up.
Sam awakens from his nightmare, disoriented. The visions of seeing himself grow old, having a family and dying feel all too real. The beginning of his nightmare is fading and somewhat fuzzy but he remembers Dean making an appearance. He remembers seeing himself fight alongside his brother, killing some vampires, a normal hunt. Then his memory clears and the image of his brother impaled against a wooden pole catches his breath.
Dean walks through the open field under the moonlight. He notices all the people lying on the ground earlier are gone. All the shady looking cars have disappeared too. He wonders if all of it is an illusion. Dead leaves crunch under his boots as he reaches the Impala. He glances at his watch; it reads 3:12. The leather seat of the car squeaks as Dean sits. He pulls out his cell phone and sees thirty missed calls.
Sam swallows past the dry lump caught in his throat. He glances at Dean, making sure he's still asleep. Dean briefly shifts, pulling the pillow closer. Sam relaxes and picks up one more crumpled up paper. This one appears fresh, as if Dean wrote it tonight.
“I just like to get to know my patrons while they visit me. In case they become regulars,” she says as she pours a light beer from the tap for another man at the bar.
Please leave a comment to let me know what you think! I really appreciate everyone that has so far. Constructive criticism and ideas are welcomed as this supposed to be a play on the finale! Thanks for the love <3
The noise startles Dean out of his shock and he blinks. To his left, a foot away, he eyes the small jar half full of the blue liquid. Dean must have dropped it during the spell and the jar happened to land right side up. Dean swiftly reaches for it and clears his throat before standing.
‘You don’t really want a courthouse wedding, do you?’ Dean asks as they lie in bed that night.
‘You changed me, Dean.’
Cas gets up during the meal to go and refill the jug of water. Dean leaps up and follows him into the kitchen. As Cas stands by the sink, Dean mindlessly places his hand on the small of Cas’ back. It’s been three weeks, and tiny things like this still send Cas’ heart into overdrive. Sam sees Dean’s gesture through the open door and has to fight back a smile. Neither Jack nor Eileen see a thing. Sam spends the rest of the meal smiling and laughing at every opportunity. Sam won’t say anything until Dean tells him. This is a conversation that needs to be had on Dean’s terms.
‘Fifty dollars,’ she replies. ‘I’ll throw in that vase your husband is admiring for free.’
‘I’m in love with Cas. And Cas is in love with me.’
The thoughts he’s been having about Cas over the last few weeks – hell, over the last few years – aren’t friendly. They’re the thoughts of a man in love. Dean is in love with Cas, and he knows it. He isn’t quite brave enough to say it yet, but he is increasingly certain that Cas loves him back. Dean can’t stop thinking about Cas’ confession. Those aren’t words that can be taken back, right? Cas can’t have changed his mind. Dean thinks he can see longing in Cas’ crinkled eyes, but maybe he’s just being hopelessly optimistic.
‘I’m so happy for you guys,’ Sam goes on.
Taking a deep breath, he turns off the tape deck and gets out of the car.
Dean works on. The house is nearly done. The interior has been painted and furnished, and the plumbing is sorted. Dean was ridiculously proud of this. He’d never let himself dream of a life like this, with everything neat and tidy and clean. He’d wanted a life like this so much, and now he had it all. As a kid, he’d struggled to put his attention to one task, instead preferring to flit between fifty eternally unfinished projects doomed to gather dust. But something motivates Dean to care about this house, a new feeling he can’t quite name. He loves making this house a home for him and Jack and Cas. God knows they deserve it.
It isn’t quite what Cas was planning, but he’s up for it. He likes seeing Dean in swim trunks. Cas drives them to the river, and Dean is obsessed with the way Cas rests his hand on the shift stick. Cas is the only other person he trusts to drive his Baby. As they always do, they leave her by the bridge and walk upstream. Cas spreads a towel out in his usual spot and takes his shirt off. Dean sits down on the towel. ‘Aren’t you going to swim?’ Cas asks.
‘I love you,’ Cas says.
Night falls. Someone puts Taylor Swift on and they’re tearing up the floor, twirling and stomping until they’re breathless. Dean Winchester is holding hands with Cas and dancing to Taylor Swift and he doesn’t care that people are watching. He wants them all to see how happy he is, and how in love he is. Most of all, though, he just wants to dance with Cas forever.
Dean looks down at the floral plate in his hands, burning to tell the truth. Suddenly, he knows he has to do it. If this moment passes, he’ll go fifteen, twenty, thirty more years without telling Cas how he feels. He takes a deep breath, And another one. And then he speaks.
‘Your first touch saved me, Cas.’
‘Jesus fucking Christ,’ Dean laughs, pulling back for a moment. His voice is low and hoarse and Cas has never heard him sound like this before and he isn’t ashamed to admit that it’s really hot. ‘Cas, I didn’t know you had this in you.’
Cas looks up, eyes wide. ‘Congratulations, Dean,’ he says in a perfectly measured voice. ‘Thank you for telling me. I know that it can be –’
Dean wakes up first. The morning light filters through the half-drawn curtains and pools like water on the polished floorboards. Dean yawns, then realises that there is an arm draped across him. He blinks, and shakes his head slightly to push the dream away, but the arm doesn’t move. Dean slowly rolls over. Cas is lying right there, fast asleep. The faintest scruff dusts his strong jawline, and Dean wants to reach out and brush his fingers against it. No, he doesn’t. That isn’t what friends do.
Every night, Dean lies in bed and imagines making a move. Some nights, he wants to do it in three simple words. Other times, he wants to deliver an emotional monologue. which is scary because Dean Winchester does not do emotional monologues. Most often, though, he imagines just walking up to Cas and kissing him again and again and again. Fuck. If only it were that simple.
‘You’re sharing with Dean?’
Cas crowds up against Dean. ‘If only you knew how many times I’ve wanted to do this to you,’ he replies, alarmed to hear just how low and hungry his own voice sounds.
Taking a deep breath, Dean stops this plan in its tracks. ‘Sam, can I talk to you after dinner?’
Dean lets Sam link arms with him, and they begin to walk as the music starts to play.
Jack is brimming with excitement the next morning, bouncing off the walls in anticipation of the arrival of his favourite aunt and uncle. They arrive in the early evening, and Jack is delighted to show off the ASL Cas taught him. Eileen signs back, beaming, and Cas and Dean hug her and Sam. Dean cooks dinner and they eat on the patio. Jack wants to take Sam and Eileen for a walk.
Fall passes in a blaze of red and orange, and then it’s December. The school semester draws to a snowy end. Jack is napping after coming home from pre-school. Dean is rewiring a wall socket in one of the upstairs bedrooms when Cas comes home. Cas comes upstairs, his hair dusted with snow.
‘Will you marry me?’
‘I think we should get rid of the ivy on the front of the house,’ Cas suggests one morning. Dean is painting the front porch, and Cas is holding the tray of paint up for him. Jack is napping inside.
brother!’ Dean says, before deciding that he wants Charlie to be his Maid of Honour. Claire will be his bridesmaid, too. He can already see the whole thing in his head. He and Cas will wear suits, and there’ll be flowers and they’ll rent out the Roadhouse and get everyone together – them and Claire and Kaia and Jody and Donna and Rowena – and dance the night away. He’s going to marry Cas in front of all these people, and he’s going to hold his hand and twirl him round the dancefloor. Dean never imagined getting married as a kid. He thought marriage tied people down and locked them together with abusive assholes. Anyway, he didn’t think anyone would ever want to marry him. He never imagined a life with a husband and a kid and a house, but now he has it and he loves it and can’t imagine anything different.
Outside the house, the Impala is waiting. At some point, unbeknownst to Dean, Sam decorated it with flowers and ribbons and streamers. He tied tin cans to the back bumper with string, and a banner reading ‘Just Married’ hangs off the trunk. Dean looks over at his brother in disbelief, but Sam just smiles. Dean holds open the passenger side door for Cas, then goes around and slips into the driver’s seat. They drive the mile to the Roadhouse slowly, and Cas periodically leans over to kiss Dean. Every time Cas kisses him, Dean honks the horn. All the guests walk behind them, and Cas keeps glancing in the rear mirror to see all the people who turned up to watch him marry the love of his five-thousand-year life.
‘I want Sam as my best man!’
The next day, Sam and Eileen go for a walk in the forest and offer to take Jack with them. ‘Why don’t we give Dean and Cas some time alone?’ Sam suggests, looking at Dean and raising his eyebrows. Dean laughs, and grabs Cas’ shoulder. God, it feels so nice to do that. Cas leans into Dean’s side, smiling, before going over to help Jack lace up his tiny hiking boots. Dean hands Sam a hiking map and Jack’s asthma inhaler, before reminding him that Jack will need help if his bootlaces come undone.
Dean appears at the backdoor, about to step into the garden with Claire and Charlie behind him. Sam suddenly has an idea. He whispers it in Cas’ ear, and Cas nods his approval. Sam strides back down the aisle and offers Dean his arm.
‘I do.’
He prepares to move in. Sam helps Dean pack as Jack bundles himself up in a faded Led Zeppelin t-shirt and rolls around on the floor like a heavy metal burrito. Cas is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly, he walks in and sees Dean stuffing flannel shirts into a bulging duffel. Without a word, Cas turns on his heel and leaves again. That night, Sam swears he hears Cas crying.
Cas goes out first and walks down the aisle alone while the guests are still sitting down and talking. He waits under the floral arch that is set up at far end of the aisle that runs between the chairs set up on the lawn. While he waits for Dean, he talks to Sam and Rowena, who is officiating.
‘I just think the water here is cold!’
Sam and Eileen literally cheer, and Sam leaps to his feet to pull Dean and Cas into a congratulatory hug. Jack just looks puzzled. ‘Weren’t you married already?’ he asks. Dean just steps forward, picks Jack up and presses him to his chest.
‘Hey,’ Dean says, trying to break the awkwardness, ‘let’s go to the river.’ The local river runs in winding bends just outside town, and they drive there in the Impala. They leave the car by the bridge, where there’s a shingled beach where kids paddle and splash in the shallows. Further upstream, the river is narrower and faster, with steep, rocky banks. Cas lays a towel down on a flat shelf of rock and lies down, reading and trying not to look at Dean as he pulls his shirt off and dives into the water. The sun suits Dean, Cas decides. This life suits Dean. He looks so tanned and carefree.
‘But what if I want it to?’ Cas replies, leaning in and kissing Dean, grabbing the front of his apron and steering him to the kitchen table. Dean perches his ass on the edge of the table and Cas pins him there, planting himself firmly between Dean’s legs and kissing him again.
‘We don’t need to tell him anything,’ Cas says. He’s thought about this before.
‘Will do.’
‘I’m so happy for you!’
Once Jack is gone, Dean and Cas sit down at the table in rare silence. For the first time in years – since the immediate moments after Cas’ return from the Empty – things feel awkward.
Dean buys a house in a quiet town with wide, leafy streets lined with tall trees. The house is a mess, with boarded-up windows and a steep shingled roof that sags inwards. The outside was once covered with white clapboard, but it’s now grey and hung with icy. The skeletal gutters are stuffed with rotting leaves. It’s cheap, and Dean’s always looking for something to fix.
Cas rolls over. ‘I kinda want to stand in front of two hundred people and say that I love you.’
Sam sighs. Cas is so old and so wise – and so unbelievably obtuse. Even more obtuse than Dean. Sam knows there’s something between his brother and Cas, and he’s determined to get them to work through it. He can’t live with watching them make heart-eyes at each other. Hell, he’s even seen Dean eyeing up Cas’ ass. ‘Cas, look,’ Sam says, trying not to explode. ‘Dean has literally just put a payment down on a three-bedroom house. I’m sure he’d let you and Jack move in with him.’
Dean won’t stop hunting.
‘I’ll do it. Take it easy, princess.’
Sam thinks Dean and Cas sound like a married couple, especially when Jack is clinging to Cas. Sam often wonders what is going on with Dean and Cas. Something had happened before Cas was sent to the Empty. He has no idea what, but he notices how Dean softens ever so slightly around Cas, how the tenseness in his older brother’s jaw melts away in Cas’ presence. He notices how Cas looks at Dean, how his weary eyes come to rest on Dean’s hands on the steering wheel. He knows that Dean made Cas a mixtape. Of course, he says nothing. What if he’s misread the whole situation? That’d be an awkward mess, and Dean would never forgive him.
‘You have paint on your nose,’ Cas says. Before Dean can respond, Cas raises a hand to Dean’s nose and wipes the paint off with his index finger. Dean can’t stop trembling afterwards, even after he’s turned the heating on.
‘Do you want me to make dinner later? I have papers to grade.’
Dean winces. Friendship is new to him. These fleeting moments where he wants to touch Cas are just moments of confusion. They’re friends, best friends, but nothing more. They live together, for God’s sake. Friends don’t want to touch each other’s faces.
The summer progresses. A new, thrilling urge seizes Cas whenever he’s alone with Dean, which isn’t often – Jack goes to bed late, and is always running rings around his fathers. Sometimes, when Jack is with the neighbours or asleep or playing out with his friends, Cas wants to tell Dean everything. His heart thunders in his chest and his breath catches in his throat and he never says a word. He is standing on the brink of something enormous, and he knows that there’s no turning back once he steps over the edge.
‘Do you, Dean Winchester, take Castiel…Novak to be your lawfully wedded husband?’ Rowena asks, pausing over Castiel’s surname.
For years, Cas has been able to live with his feelings. He’s been able to push them to one side. He can’t do that anymore. He was now never not thinking about Dean. His name, his voice, his body… it all rattles round and round inside Cas’ mind like a fervent and ceaseless prayer. Spring opens out into one of the warmest summers on record, and Cas is thankfully able to blame his frequent blushing on the heat. He never had to deal with this blushing shit when he was an angel. He is shocked at how often he blushes these days.
, and it hangs on the wall. The irony makes Cas chuckle.
‘Dean,’ Cas begins, ‘I never thought I’d be standing here and marrying you. I loved you in silence for so long. You gave me friendship and a home and a family. You made me a mixtape. You taught me how to be human; you taught me how to laugh and how to rebel and how to love. I care about the whole world because of you, because you taught me to care and because I love you.’
‘I’ll bring it up with Dean,’ Sam says. ‘We’ll sort this out.’
Each night, Cas lies in his bed and tries his hardest not to think about Dean, who sleeps right on the other side of the wall. But Dean Winchester demands to be thought about. Although Dean wanders around the house in grey t-shirts and flannel pyjama pants, he sleeps only in his boxers. Cas discovers this one night when going to get a drink of water. He bumps into Dean on the landing and Dean, half-awake, barely looks up. Cas is embarrassed at the thoughts this encounter brings to his mind. He has learnt a lot about desire since becoming human, and most of it was learnt from Dean.
Sam and Eileen return to their apartment, and the school year begins for Cas and Jack, as does wedding planning for Cas and Dean. At first, they pretend they want a no-frills, in-and-out courthouse wedding, maybe followed by a trip to a diner. ‘We’ll just have Sam, Eileen and Jack,’ Dean suggests one Saturday morning, dandling Jack on his knee as Cas makes coffee.
Sam burns with pride at his brother.
‘You should probably get out,’ Dean says. ‘You’re shivering.’
Dean doesn’t look up. The idea has crossed his mind a few times, but he’s never mentioned it. But now that Sam’s brought it up…
Cas kisses Dean and turns off the lamp on his side of the bed, plunging the room into darkness. Dean turns the lamp on his own side on.
‘I love you, Castiel,’ Dean says again, bringing a shaking hand to brush against Cas’ cheek. Fuck, he’s never going to get tired of saying that. Cas’ mouth opens in numb shock and Dean slowly leans in, closing his eyes as his lips touch Cas’. Cas’ mind is completely still, and then it’s not and Dean is kissing him – oh my God, Dean is kissing him so sweetly and so gently and it’s everything Cas has ever wanted and it’s so much more and Dean’s lips are chapped and warm and Dean’s hand is so careful and Cas realises that his own hands are hanging uselessly at his sides so he brings one up to cup the back of Dean’s head and the other rests on the small of Dean’s back. Cas leans into the kiss and tries not to have a heart attack when Dean’s tongue brushes against his own and Cas fucking whimpers and Dean laughs into the kiss and just keeps going.
way. He confessed, and Dean was so polite about the whole thing, pretending it had never happened. Cas can’t hope for anything more than that, but it’s hard not to, especially when Dean calls him ‘babe’ or ‘princess’, or when he wraps Cas’ tie around his hand to pull him close and stare into his blue eyes and ask the most mundane questions about what they’re having for lunch, before breaking into wild laughter. That trick stops Cas’ heart every time.
‘Look, the reason I wanted you to stay back,’ Dean says, ‘is because I want to tell you something. Uh, I’m not great at this emotional stuff…’
‘Strawberry Blonde’, Mitski
‘I’m seeing a therapist, and I’m learning.’
Cas can’t say anything except Dean’s name, curling his hand around Dean’s waist and melting. Cas leans in again and kisses Dean’s jaw, then his neck, then his shoulder.
‘How’s my teacher doing?’ Dean asks, concentrating on the work in front of him. Cas looks good with his shirt and his slightly too-tight sweater, and Dean reckons it’s easier if he just doesn’t pay attention. Cas’ shirt has a subtle pattern of tiny flowers on it. John Winchester would explode if he could see his eldest son living with a philosophy teacher in a floral shirt. But John Winchester is dead and buried, and his opinions are irrelevant.
‘You may now read out the vows that you have written for each other,’ Rowena says.
The rest of the day feels obscenely normal. They eat breakfast with Jack, and Cas goes to work, and Dean takes Jack to school. The rest of the week passes as if nothing happened. After all, nothing has happened, Cas reminds himself. Nothing has changed.
‘You don’t seem that surprised, man,’ Dean replies.
‘Yes.’
‘I like it,’ Dean responds. ‘I think it adds an air of mystery.’
Cas leaves to go and work at the kitchen table, checking in on Jack on his way downstairs. He has twenty papers on the philosophy of John Polkinghorne to mark, but he struggles to concentrate. The image of Dean kneeling by the wall keeps coming back to him – the sweat on the back of his neck, his tanned forearms, his calloused hands… Cas is ashamed to admit – even to himself – that he notices these things. He has loved Dean Winchester for a long time. He raised him from hell so long ago, then been brought back from the Empty by the very man he’d once saved.
Sam and Eileen come to stay for the penultimate week of the summer vacation. The night before they arrive, Jack is asleep and Dean and Cas are lying together in Dean’s bed.
Dean doesn’t dignify Jack with an answer, instead rumpling his hair and pulling him to his feet. Jack flings his arms around Dean’s thigh, and says goodbye to Cas before heading out with Sam and Eileen. Cas stands next to Dean on the front porch, watching them leave.
‘I think I’m allergic to chalk,’ Cas says, wrinkling his nose in a way that makes Dean’s heart stop. ‘The vagaries of being human… Do you need any help with that?’
Dean also knows that Cas deserves better. Cas deserves someone who isn’t scared to hold a guy’s hand in public. Someone who isn’t fifty shades of fucked up, with inherited trauma and a crap childhood to boot. Cas deserves some regular guy, someone whose mind and body aren’t scarred with a hundred battles and a hundred losses.
‘I – I – I know this isn’t the proper way to do it,’ Cas continues. ‘I don’t have a ring, and we never even asked each other to be boyfriends and we’ve only been together for, what, a month? But –’
Dean ducks below the surface of the water, then springs back out and shakes his hair dry. In the distance, Cas looks up from his book and waves. In strong strokes, Dean swims back over to Cas.
Dean laughs and closes his eyes, and Cas wants to touch Dean’s eyelashes. ‘We could go to the river for a swim?’
Cas, Jack and Eileen leave. Dean gets a beer and a soda from the fridge and takes Sam through the house to the front porch. They sit on the bench there, and Dean hands his brother the beer. Sam eyes the soda in Dean’s hand suspiciously. ‘I’m trying to drink less,’ Dean says.
Cas tilts his head and squints at Sam.
Dean realises that he likes domesticity. He likes making packed lunches for Cas every day. He likes fixing his car while kids cycle past on the sidewalk. He likes picking Jack up from pre-school and answering his glorious, silly questions.
‘I now pronounce you husband and husband.’
‘At fucking last,’ Sam says, sighing happily. ‘It only took a hundred years. No kidding, though, I’m so happy for you.’
The morning passes slowly, and Jack is very present, until Dean gives Cas a pointed look and sends Jack to go and play with his friends from down the street. Cas and Dean then sit in the living room, a respectable distance apart.
‘He’s
The four of them are in a motel room. Sam is sitting at the plywood desk, poring over his beloved lore and frowning. Cas paces along the brown carpet, deep in thought. Dean lies on his back on the vaguely grubby bed, muttering about how they should quit philosophising and get down to business. Jack is in the corner, sucking his thumb and pushing a die-cast car across the rug with his free, sticky hand. Cas, Dean and Sam are getting used to having a toddler around. They didn’t expect him to come back as a two-and-a-half-year-old, but that’s what happened and they’re dealing with it.
Dean looks at Sam quizzically. There’s no way he knows, right?
‘And So It Goes’, Billy Joel
‘Oh, you’d love to,’ Dean says, tilting his head to one side and gesturing at his own body. ‘Who wouldn’t want to hit
‘I’m going to be a bridesmaid,’ Jack says, giggling into Dean’s shoulder. Cas looks over and locks eyes with Dean, and he is aglow with joy.
Dean decides he is the neighbourhood hostess. He invites the neighbours over for a cookout and takes delight in picking out the best burgers at the store. He lays coal under the grill with the tender care of a painter and wears a horrific apron – floral pink and grey, with ‘kiss me, I’m the cook’ printed on it – and Cas can barely look at him because he wants to kiss the cook so damn much. The neighbours – a married couple with three young kids – come over with a small crate of beers. Cas sits at the patio table with the adults, talking about schools in the local area while Dean flips burgers and watches the kids roll around on the lawn. Jack gets on really well with these other kids, and they’re playing a game halfway between soccer and wrestling. Dean sees himself and Sam in the children, although these kids seem so much freer. He’s so glad that Jack isn’t God anymore, that he’s just a normal kid living in a small town and playing games on the lawn. He’s so glad that Jack came back to them as a small child with no memories, a clean slate ready to be filled with love and happy memories and day trips with his dads. Dean is doing better than his own father, he reckons. He doesn’t drink himself into a foggy stupor at sleazy bars, or beat Jack. Dean shudders at the thought of ever raising a hand at Jack and is alarmed to find his eyes stinging with tears.
‘Cas?’
That night, they go to a diner. This hunt is like the hundreds that came before it – drab, cheap and characterised by greasy food and mediocre motels. The two men, the boy and the ex-angel sit in tired, companionable silence, eating spindly fries that bend under the weight of their own oiliness. There is nothing new about any of it, but Dean suddenly feels sick. He’s had enough of fights and lore and crappy motels with damp-stained walls and sticky linoleum floors.
Dean kisses Cas goodnight, then turns off the light.
‘Honeybee’, The Head and The Heart
‘Flowers In The Window’, Travis
‘So…’
‘I think I’ll keep you company today,’ Dean says. ‘I know how you feel about swimming.’
‘Should I tell Sam?’ Dean asks.
When Dean isn’t working on the house, he’s lying on his back in the driveway under the Impala. After seeing him at work, people from the neighbourhood occasionally bring him their cars to fix. He refuses payment, but they always insist and give him a bill or a box of cookies. It’s a quiet existence, and Dean likes it. After a few months, he realises he feels younger and healthier. He hasn’t worried about death or demons for months. Sam phones almost every day, and his updates are enough. He and Eileen are having a great time.
Cas has learnt to keep his feelings hidden. He knows that they aren’t reciprocated, and that there’s no point thinking about Dean in
It’s time.
‘I think he’s really happy,’ Cas replies.
Dean stays at home during the days, watching Jack and working on the house and tinkering with the Impala. There is always something to do. He repaints the walls and repairs the windows and varnishes the old wooden floors. He borrows a ladder from the friendly family next door and patches up the shingles on the roof as Jack watches from the ground, chattering happily. There’s always something for Dean to do, even once Jack has settled in at the pre-school round the corner.
‘No,’ Cas says, trying to laugh. For good measure, he adds, ‘thank God for that.’
Dean retreats into his thoughts. A furrow appears between his brows, and he’s always fiddling with a metal bottlecap or his keys or the hem of his t-shirt. Cas notices new, awkward silences in his conversations with Dean. Jack always fills them with lively chatter if he’s around, but it still unnerves Cas. Has he done something wrong? Has Dean figured out Cas’ thoughts and been disgusted? Cas can never ask.
‘I’ve got condoms,’ Dean says. ‘Not that I’ve needed one in three years. They’re in the nightstand, if you want to –’
‘I’m really happy for us, too. Oh, I told Eileen this, but the two of you are sleeping in my bedroom.’
Cas gets a job teaching philosophy at the local high school. Dean knows someone who makes him an envelope of fake diplomas. Any guilt Cas feels over the fake documents fades away quickly. The children love Cas, because the awkwardness that Dean mocks him for endears to teenagers. His utter lack of selfishness means he always goes above and beyond, and never leaves the stragglers of his class behind. The kids laugh at him, sure, but they respect him more than any of their other teachers.
‘How much for the wardrobe?’ Dean asks the woman running the whole thing. He bounces Jack on his hip and smiles.
‘We should get up,’ Dean replies, not moving.
‘Dean, uh, told me,’ Sam says.
Dean looks at Cas, eyes wide with shock.
They both hear Jack moving around in his bedroom at the same time. ‘Shit,’ Dean whispers, ‘what are we going to tell Jack?’
‘Sure,’ Sam says. ‘Eileen, you happy to go with Jack?’
That August, they accompany Dean on a drive around some towns up on the East Coast, Jack burbling in the backseat with Sam. They originally plan on taking Dean round some midwestern towns, but Dean bristles at the idea and reluctantly admits he wants to move up east. Cas and Sam don’t laugh, and instead ring up real estate agents and make plans. Cas gets way too invested in the house hunt, researching each town and property. He’s always talking about insulation and energy efficiency ratings and property taxes. Dean will never say it, but he finds Cas’ ramblings very comforting. Sam never says a word, either, sitting in the backseat of the Impala as Dean and Cas talk about mortgages.
Dean blushes and closes his eyes. ‘We’ll need a bridal party.’
‘Castiel!’ Dean shouts. Not Cas. Not ‘teach’ or ‘prof’ or ‘angel’ or any of the other silly nicknames Dean has for Cas. Three syllables, strangely intimate in their entirety.
They arrive at the Roadhouse and kiss on the doorstep. Then, the party begins in earnest. It starts with Dean and Cas’ first dance, which is slow and tender. Dean cries and doesn’t care that people can see. Then, the booze starts to flow, and Dean is telling Charlie how ridiculously sexy Cas is and Cas has draped himself around Sam’s shoulders at the bar. Crowley somehow puts ‘All By Myself’ on, and he’s sitting on a barstool in the corner and wailing along. Nobody seems to notice or care except Dean, who asks the bartender to send Crowley a glass of wine and his best wishes. Crowley looks up and makes eye contact with Dean, who winks. Crowley almost falls of his barstool, and Claire goes over and threatens to have him banned if he doesn’t start behaving properly.
‘I – I’ve been wanting to move in with Eileen,’ Sam says. He hasn’t discussed it with Eileen, but he’s sure she’d be up for it.
Cas kisses Dean again, and Dean is happier than he’s ever been. He kisses Cas and reminds him that Jack is asleep.
Cas plants roses and geraniums and a Japanese maple tree with fringed red leaves that are a perfect prelude to the approaching fall colours. He also buys a novelty watering-can that’s shaped like an elephant. Dean thinks it’s hilarious. Cas’ eyes light up every time he sees it, and it lives by the back door that opens onto the patio. Jack blows raspberries at it, and Dean can’t help but grin.
‘He raised me,’ Sam says, ‘so I think he’ll be fine. But I do have an idea.’
‘How?’
‘That’s amazing, Dean! I’m so glad you told me!’
Dean cries out again, and his shout almost flashes blue and desperate in the darkness. Cas takes another deep breath and steps closer. Pressing his lips together, he lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder, right where he touched Dean for the first time. Dean’s face relaxes. Cas sighs. After a soft, silent moment, Dean’s other arm reaches over and pulls Cas down onto the bed. It’s a weak, fumbling tug, but Cas obeys. He knows it’s a stupid idea but, in that moment, he just wants Dean to feel safe. Cas carefully lies down beside Dean, leaving an inch or two of space between them. It’s friendly, Cas reminds himself. This is what caring friends do for each other.
‘What do you mean, “at fucking last”?’
‘And rings. I know Sam has your mom and dad’s old rings.’
They wake up at the same time and, after a moment of disbelief at the fact that
Cas rolls his eyes. “Do you really think Chuck would put that much effort into inconveniencing you?” he asks.
“That’s the point! Humans thought merfolk were just a legend for a long time, but when the First Meeting happened, it was proof that the stories and myths were much more factual than expected, and it resulted in huge gains for archaeology, anthropology, historical studies, and magic theory!” Sam has warmed up to his argument now, and his food remains untouched on his plate. “There’s still so much we don’t know, and part of this research could lead to unlocking so much more!”
“I’ve told you before,
“Get it while it’s hot,” she says, smiling, then walks out the door. From down the hallway, Dean can hear the faint sounds of a spatula moving against a pan, the coffeemaker percolating. His phone says it’s nine in the morning. The lamp on his nightstand puts out its standard warm yellow glow.
Dean stares at him, very seriously considering just going into his bedroom and locking his door, falling asleep until Cas leaves again. Because Cas
“You did your best,” Cas supplies.
As soon as he parks, he can tell something’s wrong. The front door to the office hangs open ever-so-slightly, a security risk that Rowena would never allow to happen on her watch. His stomach cramps with anxiety as he rushes over and slips inside, blinking as his eyes adjust to the dark-paneled hallway. The place is a mess: papers strewn about the corridor, the long, luxurious rug bunched up and dragged from its normal spot on the floor, the doors to Rowena’s personal office and the workroom both flung wide. Dean’s heart leaps into his throat as he spots a few thin streaks of blood on the walls.
But first, they have to stop Chuck and save Sam and Eileen.
“You guys are working way too hard,” Dean says, going through the cables and sorting them out on an open table. ECG, power cable, pulse oximeter, USB… it all looks like standard stuff. “And no offense, but you look like shit. Even Rowena looks like she’s about thirty seconds away from just keeling over. Working like this isn’t healthy, Sam.”
Cas rolls his head to face Dean and, oh, shit, he’s suddenly a lot closer than Dean expected. The couch isn’t that big to begin with, but at some point during the movie, they must have gravitated towards each other until they were nearly touching, and now all Dean can focus on is the heat radiating off of Cas, the way their knees would touch if Dean leaned over just a bit more. Cas is only inches away and Dean can see every shade and variation in his eyes, the stubble on his cheeks, the bow of his lips.
“We were wondering if you two had any sort of tracking or tracing spells that could maybe help us find some of Cas’ family or friends, so that way we could contact them and let them know about Cas,” Dean adds. “Figured the two strongest witches in town have to have
Nick nods. “Absolutely. See you around.”
Dean drags a hand down his face, and in that moment he looks so tired that even Castiel, a being who understands the concept of exhaustion more as a metaphysical aspect of the self than as the physical sensations he felt during his brief time as a human, feels it in his bones. “Cas,” he starts, then drops off for a moment, eyes unfocused as he stares at a point over Castiel’s shoulder. He closes them, swallowing hard. “Cas,” he says again, eyes still closed, “let’s look here first. You don’t have to do this alone, and neither does Jack.” He opens his eyes, gaze locked with Castiel’s own, and there’s a deep hurt in them. Along with a deep hope. “Sam and I, we want to help. I swear.”
“I don’t… I don’t know,” Cas says, stricken, and Dean softens immediately.
“Right.” Cas nods.
“Is there anything we can do?”
It makes Cas gasp and close his eyes, thrusting his hips up sharply, burying himself in Dean, who opens his mouth on a moan, letting his head tip back. This is his favorite part--after he’s come, when he gets to feel Cas chase his own pleasure, take what he needs from Dean’s body with abandon. The chair creaks and shifts as Cas fucks up and into Dean over and over, arms wrapped around Dean’s waist, and Dean lets himself tip his head back, eyes closed as Cas loses himself. He groans with Cas as he feels him spill inside him, hot and thick and wet, Cas murmuring Dean’s name like it’s a prayer, like it’s a benediction.
“Couldn’t get Cas to give you a sponge bath?” Sam jokes. Dean turns red, even though he
“I don’t know.”
, three mythical creatures just walked out of the ocean and now Cas wants to have a conversation with them?
His next shift ends close to midnight, and he walks out of the hospital doors onto the silent street. The moon is high in the sky, cold and distant, clouds striated across its face that are beginning to release slow, wispy flakes of snow that melt almost as soon as they touch the ground. It’s a little early for the first snow of the season, but Dean just pulls up the collar of his coat and shuffles to the Impala, eager to collapse into bed as soon as possible.
There’s a knock on the door that evening, and Dean lets Charlie in with a smile. “Nice digs, Winchester,” she says, setting down her backpack and a six-pack of beer (because she’s the best) before throwing her arms around him. “Now where’s this mysterious new roommate I haven’t gotten to meet yet?”
“Cas, please, just --” Dean flounders. His hands feel like they’re disconnected from his body, flopping around on his wrists. “I don’t understand. If you just tell me what you’re talking about, I could help you. I could --”
doing what I love, and I can tell you it’s a lot of hard fucking work. Whoever said that was trying to get people to drink the Kool-Aid.” He unlocks Baby and they both slide inside. The air has a slight chill to it, but the inside of the car is almost too warm from the sun beating down on it. On a whim, Dean slides his fingers through his box of tapes, finding a worn one and pushing it into the tape deck. Night Moves by Bob Seger begins crooning through the car, making Dean feel immediately better.
After cleaning up (with Cas standing just behind him watching with interest as Dean scrubs the dirty dishes at the sink), Dean makes Cas sit on the couch again and pulls out the med kit. He peels the bandages away from several of the more serious wounds that he’d patched up earlier.
Dean chews on his bottom lip for a moment, wondering if he wants to pick this fight again. “Maybe you should consider seeing a specialist,” he says finally, bracing for impact.
There’s an uncomfortable set to Cas’ shoulders that Dean can tell he’s trying to disguise, and when did he learn to read the dude’s body language so clearly. He can’t really blame Cas, honestly; Rowena still gives him the heebs and sometimes the jeebs when she gets into a focused mood like now.
“You’re so getting tagged for babysitting duty someday,” Dean snorts after he leaves. Cas had told him about Nora and her kid, and how she’d very pointedly mentioned that she and her husband don’t get out a lot because they couldn’t find anyone to watch her. “How about you, Samwitch? You seem pretty busy these days. Haven’t seen or heard from you very much.”
“I don’t… Jack didn’t bring him back. Maybe because he can’t. So it, it doesn’t matter. He’s not coming back again. I’ll figure it out,” he lies. To his brother. To himself.
Dean stops and stares at the toddler, biting his lip to stop the laughter that bubbles up inside him. “Let’s not say that in front of Cas, maybe. How about it, kiddo?”
“Dean?” Sam’s voice breaks him out of his reverie, and Dean releases the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding with a gasp that comes out more like a sob. “You don’t have to tell me, if you don’t want. I just… thought it might help. To talk about it.”
Cas squints at her like she’s just asked him a complex riddle. “I… don’t understand the question.”
“Sam is an adult now,” Cas interrupts. “It’s wonderful that you’re so loyal to him, that you’d do anything for your family. It’s one of the things I admire most about you, Dean. But you are not
There’s a man. And a lot of blood.
