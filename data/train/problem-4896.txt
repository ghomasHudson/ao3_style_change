Dean spent the better part of August as drunk as he could possibly manage.  There were long gaps of time during which he remembered nothing.  He definitely
Then Dean changed the angle, and pleasure exploded behind Castiel’s eyes.  “Dean!”
“Dammit, Cas!” Dean moaned, attempting to thrust upward into Castiel, but Castiel moved upward in response, then sank slowly back down again.  He adjusted until Dean’s cock hit his prostrate perfectly, then began another slow drag upwards.
During the third week, Dean’s desperation increased.  He said a prayer to all angels, but got absolutely zero response.  This only made him angry.  He had
Rufus expressed his regret that Dean had died, but his excitement that Dean had died by vampires, because it meant he had won a bet against Bobby, who now owed him a drink.

He could no longer use his humanity to rationalize his overwhelming guilt.  Sam and Dean were human, after all, and they were hunters.  Plus, his own mortality was, frankly, a poor excuse for not trying to fix everything he’d messed up.

Dean wrapped his hand around Castiel’s thick cock and thrusted upward, tugging and twisting just slightly as he did so.  Castiel howled, “Dean!”  Once, twice more and Castiel was seizing up,

Dean’s eyebrows shot up in shock, and he pulled back from Castiel’s hand.
world has a version of Michael that is powerful enough to kill Lucifer.
“Finally,” Castiel groaned, his voice husky.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said.  “But it doesn’t change anything.  You could still walk away if you wanted to, and so could I.  It doesn’t force us to see each other, and it certainly doesn’t force us to feel the way we both do.
Suddenly, they heard Crowley yell, “Laverne!  Shirley!  Get in here!”
No, Castiel would not make a good hunter after all – no better than he made a leader, or, in fact, even an angel.
To his surprise, Sam leveled him with a glare.  “It’s not like you’ve been much better,” he said.
“They like to hear me say their names,” Castiel said, looking slightly embarrassed.
To make his task simpler, Castiel magicked Dean’s boxers over onto the chair, where they appeared cleaned and folded.  Dean snuffled in his sleep, but did not wake.
He chose his words carefully.  He understood that Dean had meant “love” but couldn’t yet say it.  Castiel had no problem saying it, but he didn’t want to put Dean on uneven footing when he already seemed so uncomfortable.  “I care about you, Dean, and I commit to you that I won’t have intercourse or other sexual relations with anyone else.  I’m assuming that’s what you meant when you said you wouldn’t sleep with anyone else.”
“Sorry I ruffled your feathers,” Crowley snapped as Sam lowered his gun slightly.  “But I
“Dean --…” Castiel protested.
Hours later, Sam spray-painted the Enochian angel-warding symbol on the door to their hide-out in Whitefish, Montana.  “Okay.  That should do it,” he said.  “Cas can't see or hear us now.”
“The next item is the Basano vase!” said the auctioneer, a large woman with a flouncy green dress.
There were two other hands raised, a frail-looking woman in the back and another African gentleman near the front.
“So he wasn't lying.”
He should’ve known better.  Castiel would never stay out of the fighting when angels were involved, when he felt responsible.
“Talk dirty to me,” Dean grumbled, but handed over the keys.
“Yes,” said Dean and Castiel at the same time.
“Cas, fight this, this is not you!” Dean was screaming.  “Fight it!”
Dean wanted to go with Castiel, but perhaps not
Benny shrugged.  “Suit yourself.”
“Yeah?” he said into the phone as Sam woke up and shook off his sleepiness.
And yet, Benjamin had been killed with an angel blade.
He owed Castiel an apology, and he knew it.  He had done the same thing that Castiel had always done that had always made him so angry – refuse to trust his friend.  It had turned out the same way it always did when Castiel did it – disastrous.
Well.  That wasn’t so bad.  That was actually… kind of cool.  Then the next question hit, and anger along with it.
anything.
“I know.  I am sorry,” said Ezekiel.
Season 12, Part 4
Castiel accompanied the brothers on the drive back to the bunker.  Sam wasn’t speaking to Dean, and Castiel wasn’t speaking at all.  This was fine with Dean, because he didn’t want to be around Sam, and he didn’t have any idea what to say to Castiel.
He took out his angel blade and in one fluid movement sliced his neck.  It was a small, superficial slice, but Dean still yelled, “Cas, what are you-…”
“I can resupply the Prophet, Dean,” Castiel protested.  Perhaps he could still convince his old friend.
, man.  I thought you knew that.”
While pulling out from in front of Castiel’s date’s house, he was almost hit by an annoying Ford pick-up that had decided to pull in and then back up.  It was only later, after a talk with local law enforcement and some research, that he identified the pick-up as belonging to the man now possessed by the rit zein.
Castiel smiled – not quite a full grin, but closer than Dean usually witnessed.  “Yes, as a matter of fact.  I wanted to make this good for you, if it ever happened, so I watched “
“The Mark,” said Sam.  “I-I guess it -- it just messed him up.  I don't know.”
“I know that, Cas,” Dean said, impatiently.  “Just tell me.”
And as soon as I’m back in town, I would love to go on a date with you.”
“Look, Cas is kind of sick-…” Dean started to say, but Crowley cut him off.
“It took you years to be willing to bottom but you found out you liked it.”
She turned to Castiel, and he stared back at her, seething, but visibly shaken.  “As for you, Castiel, I beg of you, stop this path.  Metatron has been neutralized.  If you want back in, truly, I will listen.”
It had been two months since Dean had last seen Castiel, when he had almost killed Dean and taken off with the tablet.  It had been four months since Dean had last had a real conversation with Castiel, shortly after he had stayed for Christmas.
Kelly was taking an awful long time in the bathroom…
“You’d like to think so, wouldn’t you?” Dean sneered.  “But if Cas and I were going to have a happy ending, we would’ve had it in Purgatory.  It was pure there, you know.  Benny and Cas were both better friends to me than you’ve ever been.  But I had to get back to my little brother, my little brother needed me.”  He shook his head, laughing maniacally.  “And it turned out that you hit a dog and met a girl!  I should’ve just stayed there.”
For now, though, Dean was no longer a demon, and Metatron was successfully in jail.  And for now, that was enough.
“What happened between you and Dean in Purgatory?”
“Yeah, I figured that out when he almost stabbed me with my angel blade,” Castiel said wryly.  “I’m no expert on relationships but I’m pretty sure that’s not normal.”
, for Castiel, Dean would always,
“You do it,” said Castiel, meeting Dean’s eyes for only a second.  Dean recognized shame in ice blue eyes staring back at him.
He was right, and Dean knew it.  Part of him didn’t even
“If I dent her, I’ll fix her,” he said, and he reached around to clamp both hands on Dean’s ass, shoving Dean’s erection fully against his behind.
Then there was the fact that he had
Finally, Sam stood up with an abrupt sigh.  “I’m going to grab food,” he said.  Dean opened his mouth, and Sam added, “I know.  I’ll get pie.  Cas, do you want anything?”
Two months passed.
“You know about that?” asked Castiel.
He felt his end coming quickly, quicker than he’d expected, and grabbed Castiel’s cock so that they could finish together.  He had barely touched it when Castiel clenched and stiffened, groaning out his release, and Dean followed soon after.
Castiel had a point, Dean conceded.
Sam looked at Castiel.  “It's your call, Cas,” he said.
“We’re an hour east of Grand Junction, Colorado,” said Dean shakily.
Castiel laughed.  “Has this ever happened to you?”
After that, there was a stroke of luck.  One of the older residents identified that one of the orderlies was wearing her bracelet, one of the things that had been stolen.  They tracked the stolen bracelet back to the owner of the nursing home, Doctor Mahoney.  He was the famed “Black Hole”, and he had been using Fred’s psychokinetic powers to rob the residents of the nursing home.
Unfortunately, they learned quickly that Metatron didn’t have any knowledge of the Mark of Cain, as he’d previously claimed.
“Contraire, Rodent,” said Crowley.  “It’s a couple’s party, and the host is gay.  You won’t be the only ones.  Plus you certainly look the part.  C’mon, Moose, you can hitch a ride back to the hotel with me, just this once.”  He waved his fingers at Dean.  “Bye-bye!” and he disappeared.
“Yes, but by then you had made it clear how much you hated angels, and sometimes even how much you hated
Castiel looked at Sam, who nodded.  Castiel pulled out his angel blade and sliced Metatron’s throat open.  A white light came out of Metatron into a little glass jar.  Castiel healed Metatron’s throat, and then Sam shot him in the leg.
Dean sighed.  Sam was sick, but he was also more than capable of completing the 8-hour procedure on his own.  Crowley was secure, he’d made sure of it, and there were no other demons or threats within spitting distance.  “Look, I... I'm down with sending the angels back to Heaven, just 'cause they're dicks.  But the demons?  This is on us.  Start the injections now.  If I'm not back in eight hours, finish it, no questions, no hesitation.”
“You’ve been ignoring him for three days, and you called him stupid twice on the ride here!” Sam shot back.
“Right in front of all of us, too,” added Wally.
Castiel’s smile was nearly a grin now, full of pride.  “Oh he did, I’m almost certain,” he said.  “I went to the Empty, which is where angels go when they die, to sleep forever.  And the – the
It was a full thirty seconds before Castiel finally leaned toward Dean at the table.  “Thoughts?” he asked in a low voice.
Castiel situated himself on the bed, Dean’s head still awkwardly lying on his lap.  He heard a soft sigh, and realized that Dean had drifted off to sleep, his face for once peaceful.
Sam looked stunned, but Dean couldn’t tell if it was because he hadn’t known or because he had never thought Dean would actually admit it.  “God, I was so whiny!  I actually gave a shit, but I don’t anymore!  I don’t care what you think, and I don’t even care what Cas thinks!”
During the second week, Dean started to get a little scared.  He became restless, taking case after case for the British Men of Letters and killing monsters with renewed vigor.  He ran a trace on Castiel’s phone, but it yielded no results.  It literally didn’t seem to even
Did you get that out of a porn?”
Right now, Castiel had a mission.  It took Castiel awhile to be sure, but by four hours later he was sure the Colt was nowhere to be found except for possibly in Dean’s or Sam’s room.  Steeling himself, Castiel knocked on the door to Dean’s room.  “Sorry, Dean,” he said.  “Um, I just wanted to return this.”  He handed Dean the cassette tape that Dean had given him some time ago.
When they returned to the bunker, Dean bolted toward the bathroom to shower, and Castiel attempted to get Claire settled.  She had been understandably shaken up by Dean’s actions, and had spent most of the ride back to the bunker watching Dean and Castiel wearily.
So Castiel did.
“Cas,
“Ishim said to come alone,” Castiel tried to explain outside the restaurant.  “He doesn't like humans.”
A black limo pulled up next to them and Crowley’s face poked out.  Dean shoved Castiel in by the tails of his suit jacket, and climbed in behind him with the suitcases.
“He's got a point,” Sam said.
“Cas.  Hey, man.  So, about that date…”
Castiel shivered.  And he knew, somewhere, that he was too overwhelmed, that this was too good to be true.  But it didn’t matter, and he surged until he was fully in Dean’s arms.  Dean pulled him tightly against him, until they could both feel each other’s hardness, which was nowhere near what either of them wanted,
Dean was sleeping soundly beside him, his right leg touching Castiel’s left, and there was something very human, very domestic, about waking up beside him.  Was this what other couples did every day?  The last time he had needed to sleep had been over a year ago, after the beast spell, and Castiel realized that he had missed waking up next to Dean.
“Huh?”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably, and Dean threw him an annoyed look.  There was really no reason for the angel to be sitting closer to the amalgamation that was Justin and Tyler than to him.  T.L. had been correct – he was definitely turned on, and it was taking all of his concentration not to reach out to the angel.  Still, he was a far cry from attempting to make out with him.  It wasn’t like the ballroom was full of people suddenly spurred on to orgies.
“Goodbye, Crowley,” Castiel growled, advancing on him with the angel blade.
So it continued.
“Here's the deal,” said Dean.  He could be honest with Castiel about as much as possible, he supposed.  “When Sam was doing the trials to seal up Hell, it messed him up.  Okay?  The third one nearly killed him.  If I'd let him finish, it would have.  He's still messed up, bad.”
“You know,” said Dean, increasingly suspicious.  “Why don't Sam and I take it over to him, and you can get back to your mission?  Finding the other half of the demon tablet -- that is priority, isn't it?”
“Through the front door, ya moron,” said Crowley.  “That’s the beauty of my plan.  It’s completely above board, until tomorrow when they realize that the credit card I just gave you is a fraud.”
“I care for you too, Dean,” Castiel said, now smiling fully.  “
Don't you know you're everything I have?
It had been around Valentine’s Day… more than six months ago.
Finally, Dean started shakily.  “So, just so we’re clear.  We’re still…
made Dean’s cock stir feebly.  “Do you have one of your own you’d like to share?”
“You do?” asked Sam doubtfully.
After Purgatory, Dean had immediately slipped back into the relationship with Castiel that he had had before Purgatory.  This included rules about touching, and enforcing personal space.  Castiel had shot him a hurt look on the first two or three occasions after Purgatory that he had berated the angel for his lack of personal space, but had said nothing.
Now you spend your days banging a gavel in a Party City wig and the most interesting case we’ve had in a decade is… vampire mimes.”
It wasn’t like Dean was exactly new to survivor’s guilt, though.  He turned it into fuel for his vengeance against the monsters of the world, like he always had.  He lived life one day at a time, careful to stay out of dark spaces where he had to think too much.
“Not all of them, Dean,” said Castiel.  “Some are just looking for direction.  Some are just lost.”
Dean headed toward the liquor cabinet, because apparently it was going to be
Jack gags a few more times, Kevin rubbing his back absentmindedly as he sorts through the vomit with a stick. “Come on, buddy, just one more…”
“It’s what plays while the stage is being set up for the next performance. It’s usually just some random selection of clips showing some part of the host country. Ours is…” Paige checks her notes. “Ours is in a famous haunted house nearby.”

lunges for Dean, who swipes it out of existence with the fire iron.
Jo watches her for a moment, to see the glitter in her eyebrows and the challenge in her eye. Then she leans forwards in a gentle sway, closing the distance between them and carefully kissing the curve of Charlie’s smile.
There is blood on his hands, and more blood on the rug, and he is shouting with no response. Then, there are familiar hands grabbing him and lifting him away from Dean, and a worried face and a call for an ambulance.
“What do ya wanna know?” Dean asks.
Cas may not remember much about his old life, but he’s discovered that his instincts are generally impeccable. Right now, for example, they are screaming that something is very, very wrong and he feels his pulse quicken. “Dean, what’s going on?”
Cas doesn’t bother replying; he’s found that if Dean has his mind made up about something, there’s absolutely nothing that anyone could do about it. He settles onto one side of the battered sofa, curling his feet up and drawing the colourful, knitted blanket up over his lap. He likes Jody’s cabin way more than he liked living in the bunker. There aren’t so many people there to crowd him and the windows remind him that the outside world exists. Nothing matches, either; the towels are all different colours, the cutlery is mismatched, the decor differs from room to room. He feels like it’s the kind of house he would like, if that was ever an option; one made up of a hundred different little things, a home made like a patchwork blanket.
drunk. But they all still follow them over to the open bar to join the others, Diana waving to get them a round of shots before they even manage to take a seat.
It was now or never.
“I don’t know much about the Mark,” said Castiel.  “None of us do.  But it’s… ancient.  And a great evil surrounds you.”
Castiel knew immediately that they had erred.  There was a
Dean said, “Awesome!”
Instead, he returned to the bunker.  He missed Dean, and felt he had been away too long during this crucial time.
“Castiel, the poor fool.”  He shook his head, shooting Dean another pitying look.  “He used to be a Commander, ya know?  He used to wield all of the power of the Heavenly Host, before he became your little
“You said you got everything you could out of Metatron, right?  So, where on earth are we gonna find an answer on how to stop her?  I don't suppose God's decided to share any wisdom on the matter.”

bomber?” asked Castiel,
For the next month, Dean snapped easily, killed frequently, and drank heavily.  He knew he was being a bear to live with, but he didn’t care.  Near the end of April, he overheard Sam on the phone with their mother:  “No, Mom, I think he’s drunk again.  Yeah, he’s taking the whole Cas thing really hard.  Yeah – no, don’t worry, he’s been like this before.  Cas has disappeared before.  He’s an angel, he’s not like us.  He’ll come back.”
“Well, Bartholomew has a faction we know about, but this could be somebody else entirely,” Sam said.  “We don’t know.”
He never would’ve believed, until Purgatory, that he would find kissing exciting, but Dean never failed to amaze him.  He felt overcome, caught up in the whirlwind that was Dean’s tongue in his mouth and Dean’s hands pulling unhurried at his clothes.  Castiel’s trenchcoat fell onto the floor, and a minute later Dean’s long-sleeved shirt followed.
“You misunderstand me,” said Castiel gently.  “I have put you above my priorities and duties several times,
,” said Dean, smirking.  “We’re in the City of Angels.  The last time we were here, Sammy and I hadn’t been to Hell yet and found out what
Paige can’t help but smile to herself as she clicks her own seatbelt in place. All of these people are clearly a family (even if she has yet to figure out exactly how they know each other), and it’s always nice to have a reminder that found family can exist for anyone, maybe even her.
“We don’t have that many of you,” Sam explains, sliding one of Cas and Dean sat on a car hood. “Sorry.”
“Alex? Jo? You girls still in there?” Mary calls, knocking on the door.
The other man nods, his eyes skimming the crowd. “I get what you’re saying. I hate flying, all I need right now is a hot shower.”
“Look, we’re just gonna get out of here, ‘kay? Go back to the bunker for a few days.” His eyes keep flitting to the doorway, which is currently doing a poor job of muffling the bangs and crashes coming from the other room.
“I’m too old for this,” he grumbles, dropping his face into the mattress. Cas takes that as his cue to quickly retreat to the guest bedroom and pretend he saw nothing.
Paige thinks as she hails a taxi to the nearby arena,
Bobby Singer isn’t nervous. He doesn’t get nervous. He had defeated monsters and been killed by Lucifer himself (among other things), why on earth would a little wedding make him nervous?
“Shuddup,” he replies, shoving the groom out the door and towards the bar. He’s struck with a sudden sense of appreciation that he got to look after these two boys. They may have gone through a metric ton of shit, but they were still smiling through it as always, and without having helped them through it, he would never have the privilege of walking this idjit down the aisle.
Zhertva aborta - failed abortion
“Jerk.”
Cas sits on his bed, feeling like a severely told-off toddler. He considers his options; he can continue packing not-his clothes into a non-existent bag, he can put them all back in the unusually roomy wardrobe, or he can just sit here on his bed surrounded by piles of clothes and wait for Sam to come back. He opts for the latter.
Ellen rolls her eyes but complies, swinging the doors open wide to those waiting outside, waving all the Winchester’s guests in with a smile. Everyone was there; from people they had only really met once, to family, to long lost friends (there were benefits of hosting a wedding in Heaven when your kid is God).
Dean nods. “Have there been any other deaths at Eurovision or with any of the hosts or anything that you know about?”
“You really don’t,” she groans.
Gabriel had been to a great many events, and yet somehow the crowd at Dean and Castiel’s wedding was one of the weirdest selections of guests he has ever experienced. It was like someone had put the names of everyone they had ever met into a hat and drawn them at random; half the people had been dead for at least a decade, and the other half weren’t human (plus, there the select few that managed to fit into both categories). It was rare that an event had both the Queen of Hell, an archangel, God, and a load of salty old hunters, but it was the Winchesters, and he expected nothing less.
Before, Castiel had been able to convince himself that he was better staying away from the fighting now that he was human.  Now, his eyes had been opened to exactly how bad things were.  Since the rit zein, he had done more and more research.  He had actively looked into angel kills and possessions, and the more he saw, the more upset he became.
The silver lining of this arrangement was that Castiel would occasionally become so desperate to escape Crowley for a few days that he was more easily convinced than usual to come for a visit, especially if he was already nearby.  Aside from this fact, however, the demon made their already complicated relationship even moreso.  Crowley never let them have a moment alone, and commented constantly on their relationship.
“There’s rumored to be something called a demon knife,” said Justin.  “I’ve never seen one, but Tyler has.”  The two smiled at each other sappily, and Dean took another drink.  “It’s rumored to kill demons where normal knives will not.”
“Hello to you too,
“Nah, man, you were doing your thing with Hannah and the angels.”  Dean looked away.
The demon sighed.  “Still, it’s not entirely a waste.  Looks like you two have been
“Well, if she's a liar, she's pretty good at it,” said Dean.  “You, on the other hand, kind of suck.”
“Yeah, that would be where the hedonism comes in,” Sam said simply, but Dean shushed him.
Even more oddly, Kelly seemed on board with it.  Earlier, she had convinced Castiel to feel the baby kick, and ever since then she’d been acting differently.  Excited, even.
“Yes Sam?”
Castiel left the bunker in early January to search for Metatron.  The search was slow-going without his wings, and it was late February before he made any real progress.  He remained in touch with both brothers, and learned that they had at least somewhat settled their differences and begun hunting again.
Dean moved to sit opposite his brother at the table.  “You do see something severely wrong here, right?  Sammy, I remember every second of leaving that place.  I mean, I remember the – the heat, the stink, the pain, the fear.  I have that whole ugly mess... right here, and he says he has no idea how he got out?  I – I'm just not buying it.”
to a meeting point
Castiel’s eyes narrowed in contrast.  “Of course,” he said.  “I’m an angel.  When I have to go into battle, it would be highly inconvenient to do so with a massive erection.  I turn the libido off unless I’m in need of it.”
It was several hours later before Toni fell asleep and Dean was able to listen to the message from Cas.
“Two thousand five hundred euros,” said Dean.  His voice was throaty.  Castiel drug his hand up and down Dean’s length, twisting slightly, and Dean let out a grunt that he turned into a cough.
“Well, he was right!” exclaimed Dean.  He looked out the impala window as the dark sky flew by.  It had been a long time since he’d felt this good.  The hip replacement had been a bitch and a half, to be honest.
Castiel began to feel as if he were missing something big.  It didn’t happen to him as often as it used to, but occasionally he still felt as though he had missed major concepts in human customs.  “Dean, I don’t understand.”
“Rowena,” said Castiel.  “It’s some sort of spell.”
Castiel moved off of Dean for long enough to say, “Just my name would be fine, thanks,” before returning.
“Listen, buddy.  Um... You can't stay,” he said.
before.  When Castiel disappeared became Naomi was controlling his mind, they hadn’t been together, not really.  They weren’t talking as frequently, and, if Dean was honest with himself, he had been a jerk to the angel.  He had felt betrayed and suspicious when Castiel stopped texting and calling occasionally, but at the time he had still been trying to distance himself from his feelings for the angel anyway.
“Don't worry about me,” Castiel said.  “What are you doing for Sam?”
“I just found out,” Castiel added.
for Castiel before now.  He had thought he would always have time, somehow, because Castiel always came back.  Now, if his friend closed the doors to Heaven, he
One look at Sam confirmed that he thought the same.  That would explain his irrational anger, then.
Castiel froze, but did not turn to face him.  He looked disheveled but sexy, wearing only his white button-down shirt and slacks.  It was the first time Dean had seen him like that since he’d been living in the bunker full-time, and Dean immediately felt hot despite himself.
“What?” asked Dean.
Dean and Sam still looked at him with shock.
Dean still talked with Castiel occasionally, and even offered to visit, however Castiel always declined.  He knew that his friend was embarrassed and guilty about no longer having his angelic powers, and so he gave him space.  Over time, their phone calls became fewer and farther between.
Castiel sat frozen, shock registering on his face.  A sea of “Heaven call waiting” buttons blinked insistently behind him.  Dean took another breath, and let it out slowly.
…”I mean, Banshees go after the vulnerable, right?” Sam asked after the hunt.  “So why did it go after you?”
“I texted her.  She's working a rugaru case in Texas.  Actually, she never texted me back. That's not the point,” Dean said.  “The point is, we have a ton of driving left to do just to go to a town where there's probably not a case.  But in there . . . Good times.  And time heals all wounds, Sam, especially good times.  What do you say?”
"Thanks, Sammy." Dean rasped out, carefully taking the mug before shutting the door and returning to the center of the room.
I see you, I feel you,
Dean's knuckles turned white and he ground out "You get this from Sam?"
Bobby hugged him for the second time ever, and he held him as tight as he could. They pulled apart just before Dean came through the door. Bobby excused himself and Dean dished Cas a piece of the pizza he'd brought with him.
"Every night in my dreams,
He was halfway through one of the five movies Bobby owned when Dean joined him. He silently filled the glass Dean extended before settling back into the couch.
So, Cas was spending the ride back to Bobby's doing his best to remember the spell while simultaneously ignoring the Winchesters and the tightening feeling within his chest.
Terror flooded through him as his greatest secret was laid out for his family's scrutiny. He closed his eyes and nodded.
He sounded hopeful, and went about clicking through the internet. His eyes went wide as he came across a page, and he appeared to be contemplating the information.
Dean met his eyes; there was understanding there as he smiled tightly. "It's what might be your last few days and you choose to watch Sixteen Candles? You've been spending too much time with Sam."
Bobby sighed, "Of course it is. Christ Cas, why couldn't it have been Sam or another angel? Hell, a demon? Dean's the most stubborn man I know- he's not going to believe an ex-angel loves him. He'd probably bust out the Holy Water and try to exorcise us!"
Silence. Cas slid down the wall, and sat on the floor outside the door. He listened, the pain increasing with every breath he took
He sighed and continued, "Dean loves you, Cas, he really does. But I don't know if it will be the way you need it to be. You're family, though, and I know that if he figures it out he will try."
Everything went black as he fell to the ground.
"And no matter how busy he got he would come for you."
Apparently the late-August air was getting to Dean, because he had shed his outer shirt. Cas swallowed hard. Sweat was causing the already light t-shirt Dean was wearing to cling to his body even more.
Bobby grunted and moved into the kitchen; Cas looked over to Sam and raised his eyebrow in question.
If Cas still had the power to, he would have taken their voices away- stupid witches and their voice-stealing potions.
He gave the older hunter a dark look and Bobby rolled his eyes.
He nodded and shakily moved to a chair. He sat as Sam rushed to get him coffee and a piece of toast.
Leaning half on Dean all night hadn't gotten the message across apparently.
At least this way he could pretend he and Dean were like the couples in those "chick flicks" and could be this close.
He'd barely reached Cas in time last night. He caught his body as he was falling and had frantically kissed him, hoping he wasn't too late.
Cas' heart stopped- I really wish it would stop doing that- and he floundered a bit. He hadn't expected Sam to be quite that honest with him. He closed his eyes, breathing through a flare of pain.
He popped in the cassette, well aware he was breaking a cardinal rule of the car. But Dean didn't say anything until the first song began playing.
Dean looked angry. "Whoa now Cas, what are you talking about?"
"Great. That helps narrow things down."
When Cas woke up the next morning, the pain was thrumming steadily under the surface. Thankfully, it wasn't sharp, so he struggled out of bed and dressed for the day. He made his way to the kitchen where Dean was making breakfast (read: bacon).
A smile twitched on his lips, Singer Salvage yard was indeed home now. Bobby, for all his griping, had readily accepted Cas as his newest "son" when he left Heaven after the Second War.
When Cas woke up the next day, he was huddled on the couch under Bobby's best blanket. Dean must have covered him up before going to his bed.
Sam pursed his lips and said "Yeah, sure thing, Cas."
Sam sighed, "Of course I haven't forgotten, Dean. And what do you mean what am I waiting for? What are you waiting for?"
It was around five that he finally wrote another important note.
'Giving up on me already?'
Cas began writing out every thought, feeling and memory he had regarding Dean Winchester. He poured out the frustration, hopelessness, loyalty, joy, and the love that had cause him to fall hard and fast.
But that was all Cas allowed him to do before pushing him out the door- leaving him alone in the kitchen. He had assisted Bobby with cooking his first four months as a human; he could do this.
Cas glanced at him and passed a note, 'I hope you have a plan for today.'
He turned to see who walked in; of course, it had to be Dean. Cas was covered in flour and dough, his hair was everywhere, and the place smelled like smoke.
Cas huffed, 'I realize my being cursed has slowed us down but I'd hoped my potentially dying was a bit more important than hunting for five days'
Sam nodded and turned to the door, he paused and looked back. "Cas…if this doesn't work out, well, thanks for helping us. Thanks for everything, really."
"What the hell, Sam? What are you waiting for? Did you forget that Cas is in pain and dying right now?"
If looks could kill, the glare Dean shot at the paper would have been sufficient to do so. He nodded and turned to the door, "I'll go get Sam."
Dean leaned forward, placing his head into his hands.
"Where do I begin, to tell a story of how great a love-"
"Whatever, I'm not going to stand here and listen to you justify letting your best friend die. Whether you admit it or not you've been pissy ever since he got cursed. Maybe you want to think about why you're so upset instead of just sitting here while someone who loves you is dying just because you're too scared to admit that you feel the same way."
Cas raised an eyebrow, 'That is your plan? Do you think I really have a chance of success, or are you just trying to keep me occupied until I die?'
He sighed, grateful his breathing at least still made sound.
"Alright, go through the list of commonalities again." Bobby said wearily.
Dean turned toward Sam, "What the hell happened?"
Apparently, the way to any man's heart is through his stomach.
If a bottle of Jack went with him, no one said anything.
Mission: Prince Eric (Dean's name, not theirs) Step One: Cookies
He stomped off into the kitchen, again, for yet another beer; though the sound of clinking glass suggested he was grabbing something stronger this time.
Batch two didn't bake together, but they weren't finished by twelve minutes. Five minutes later, Bobby's smoke detector started beeping.
There was no response, just the sounds of three people breathing heavily. Then a scoff.
'Please give this to Dean.'
Finally, the dough looked- and tasted- fine, and Cas attempted another batch of cookies.
Surrounded by wads of paper and holding six sheets of writing covered in crossed out lines and scribbling, Cas sent Sam a text.
'It seems that this is another possible "last night on Earth." I would like to go somewhere.'
"And he wanted to hang out with you yesterday and today."
He was grateful his sob remained silent.
This is doubly true for Dean, according to Sam.
He blinked away more tears and wrote: 'Where were you?'
He winked and left the kitchen with the cookies. Cas' jaw dropped and he sat down, he laid his head on the table and tried trying to groan.
He set his notes down and pinched the bridge of his nose, "Each victim had one other similarity- some degree of unrequited love."
Slowly, he leaned into Dean's side and brought his head onto his shoulder. He kept his eyes shut tight, not wanting to face the rejection and pity sure to come.
Cas leaned against the desk and placed his head in his hands. Sighing, he focused on the dull ache in his chest.
"He was just doing what seemed right! He wants you! He never would have come back if not for you."
At least…until a clicking sound made both men look toward the door where Sam stood with a camera and a shit-eating grin. Without a word Dean shot towards the door to destroy the offending object but ended up chasing his brother down the stairs, leaving Cas alone to hear Bobby shouting that they were idjits and needed to stop running inside the damn house.
Dean read the note and quickly looked away. For a moment, Cas was concerned he would refuse, but then Dean nodded.
Dean's jaw clenched and he ducked down. The silence reigned and Cas was willing to leave it be for a bit. Really, it's not like pushing it would do him any good even with his limited time.
Cas nodded to Sam and went to the yard, careful to bring his paper with him.
Castiel was sulking; there was really no other word for it. He was in the backseat of the Impala, arms crossed over his chest, and a pout on his face. His head was leaning against a rain-speckled window, the cool temperature drawing his focus away from the brothers bickering in the front seat.
"Hopelessly devoted to you-"
And they would all live happily ever after.
So he was going to die in less than 48 hours and the person he most wanted to be with was going to avoid him because he was going to die and Dean thought there was nothing he could do.
Bobby stayed a while longer, patting Cas' shoulder. He was about to pull away when Cas grabbed his hand and handed him a note.
Dean smirked, "It's okay, Cas. The curse is br-"
Sam looked incredibly uncomfortable as he explained a few ideas. "The key is to make Dean realize it on his own. You can't just come out and say it- he knows about the time limit so it might not count."
Or so he thought.
Wonderful.
What the heck went wrong this time?
Sam sounded so unsure but Bobby, though understanding, simple said, "Boy, you got until the end of the day to figure this out."
Cas met his eyes briefly before shaking his head. None of the dozens of things he wanted to say would come out, even if he wanted them to.
Sam nodded, "Yeah, I do. You're going to go hang out with Dean, and tonight you guys are going into town for dinner."
He finished cleaning the kitchen and went upstairs. Crawling into bed, he tried to convince himself that tomorrow would work.
Castiel's sleep was fitful, the whole night he tossed and turned- barely able to sleep for the growing pain in his chest.
When he received his breakfast, he smiled gratefully before sipping some of the bitter liquid.
If he was finally forced to show his hand and tell Dean about, well, everything, he needed to do it right. Or else he might die…again.
He let himself be lulled to sleep by Dean's steady breathing.
The pain drowned out the sound of feet pounding down the stairs and voices calling his name.
Cas' eyebrows drew together and he huffed in frustration. What is his problem? He's not the one trying to force-feed someone with knowledge of his affections.
A bottle being set beside him drew his attention to Bobby. He smiled and nodded, taking the beverage happily.
Sam wrinkled his nose, a clear "Bitch-face #42" (or, "shut up and stop teasing me, Dean") if Cas ever saw one.
'Something wrong?'
The hunter glanced at him before grumbling a 'morning.'
The door opened and Cas was surprised to see Bobby enter the room.
"Yeah, and use the both of us-"
He glanced out the window and saw the sun was setting. His heart dropped and his stomach clenched. How had an entire day gone by so fast?
Sam looked guilty, "Cas, you know Dean. Any mention of being anything other than straight sends him into heteronormative overdrive."
He rolled out the dough and cut cookies with the pink, plastic, heart-shaped cutter.
He glanced out the window; he probably had about fifteen minutes before sunset. Cas grabbed Sam's arm and nodded his head toward the window.
His eyes snapped to Cas', "Unless…they're already around?"
The first batch of cookies he placed in the oven nearly exploded- he just managed to remove them and save a gooey mess.
Physical attraction had always been second to a balance between logic and emotions when it came to his dealings with Dean, but it had been an increasing problem over the last six months- since he'd become a human. He pushed those thoughts aside; better to not get those hopes up.
Cas smiled and shook his head. He had only done what was right, after all.
Sam nodded. "Seems like it. Those whose curse wasn't broken died at sunset the fifth day."
Cas sat down to watch the sunset outside, enjoying the fresh air. The sun was just beginning to touch the horizon when pain flared and a spasm ran through his entire body. He closed his eyes and screamed silently.
Unfortunately, as the sun sank lower in the sky it became more likely that Cas was, indeed, acting out the role of Ariel in this little farce.
Dean's hands tightened on the keys and he exhaled. "What's there to stick around for? Jesus Cas, what are you even doing with us? Why aren't you out there finding your true love and living 'happily ever after.'"
Dean grinned, "Nah, just making sure she's ready for us to head out in a few days."
He stopped and started many times, facing that rational doubt, but still he pushed on, so absorbed in his task he didn't even notice as the three other men came and left.
Cas had to admit, the entire tape was pretty awful. Dean began fast-forwarding through the songs.
But he simply saved the bacon from burning and ate in silence. Sam came downstairs as Cas was beginning to despair again.
Dean's expression grew stony, "Son of a bitch."
Death was worse than being scrutinized like this…right?
Cas nodded before looking out the window again.
A loud whistle shut the Winchesters up as they covered their ears.
He left the room, closing the door roughly behind him.
He took a cookie and moaned in appreciation. "Not bad, Cas. Bake more of these and even I might consider playing your 'Prince Charming.'"
So that was it, then? Dean knew and wasn't going to say anything? He knew he shouldn't cry, nothing was over quite yet, but he couldn't help it.
Between kisses he murmured things about Cas having girly handwriting and not being allowed to talk to Sam about music ever again.
Sam nodded and left. Cas turned to a new page, completely prepared to write out…everything.
'Why would you assume I wouldn't be with you?'
So now, the seemingly unending string of "idjits" and "what were you thinkings" was reassuring.
He walked the rest of the distance and made his presence known. Dean gave him a questioning look and he gave a half-smile. He leaned against the car, enjoying that he had the privilege of doing so, and wrote: 'Is anything actually wrong with her?'
Sam, it seemed, had a plan. "We're going shopping as soon as you're ready. We have baking to do."
Sam picked out the recipe and explained how to read it. He also gave a quick tutorial on using the oven.
At least this way the ever-sharpening pain was pushed back in his mind, behind a wall of warmth seeping into him from Dean's body.
The next day was spent poring over various tomes and searching the internet for any curses involving loss of voice and potions.
Sam came rushing into the room and removed the batteries before Cas could destroy the horrible contraption. He had to take a break then as another wave of pain hit him.
He sat on the chair and it struck Cas that he hadn't seen the man in two days. Bobby extended a fresh pad of paper.
Sam shook his head, "Dude I have no idea. He just tried to stand up and suddenly…"
He grimaced and made a grabbing motion towards his notepad. Dean immediately complied, handing him his tools.
"Why are you so afraid, Dean? Do you really think he's going to just…leave?"
He frantically began cleaning the kitchen, knowing Bobby preferred that room, at least, stay clean.
If he was going to die because of a rejected love letter, he certainly wasn't going to do it on the floor like some pathetically desperate teenager in a movie. (Not that he wasn't pathetically desperate- but only because he was dying!)
He left the room and Cas watched him go. He sighed before scribbling a note: 'Perhaps we should take a break. We are all on-edge and tired.'
The door slammed shut and Sam stormed past him. He looked down at Cas, horrified to see him sitting against the wall on the floor.
'I will need suggestions.'
Cas had continued breathing, but he was still unconscious.
"It wouldn't matter even if we told him." Sam said quietly. "It has to be true love, Bobby. It has to be a kiss. And, he has to realize it on his own."
Cas scribbled another note: 'I'm going to watch a movie.'
"You're here, there's noth-"
Today was not going to be a good day.
Cas' face fell. Dean left? Knowing that he needed help, Dean still left?
He wiped away the few tears that managed to escape. There's only one chance left, he thought as he looked at his paper. He was going to write everything out and present it to Dean - Maybe it would be enough. Maybe Dean was concerned it was about the curse and Cas could convince him it really wasn't.
A dark look shadowed his face and Dean leaned back over the engine and mumbled "But I guess you probably won't be coming with us."
Too late.
'I don't think I can move, Dean.'
"Okay-"
He never would have guessed he would have bad luck as a human- though he really should have considering the bug bite from his first stint as one- so it came as a shock that he would be cursed on his first hunt.
, but it was… if he was honest, better than he’d expected.  An
“Okay, good,” said Dean as the two entered into the starlit sky.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed.
The next morning, Castiel explained that he needed to leave to find Kelly Kline.
“Father-of-demons Cain?” asked Dean in surprise.  “That Cain?”
So Castiel had resolved a long time ago that the only thing he would receive from Dean was his friendship.  And this was okay, because, as an angel, Castiel once again had control over both his vessel and his mind, and so he was happy with things as they were.
,” Dean insisted finally, stubborn.  “We’re Dean and Cas, and Sam, just like we’ve always been.”
commitment
Dean froze.  He waited on Castiel to disappear.
said Crowley’s voice from somewhere in the background.
Both man and angel were mostly silent, until Sam finally said, “Dean finally told me about everything.”
Castiel could feel the pleasure coiling tightly…
Sure enough, the angel Naomi appeared in front of them.  “I'm not here to fight you, Castiel.  Not anymore.”
“I'd like that,” Castiel said, his heart sinking.
Castiel recognized this for what it was, and he once again placed his hand on Dean’s arm.  When he removed it, the handprint was once again visible on Dean’s skin.
“So,” Castiel said seriously, “You have completed one of my… sexual fantasies.”  The way he said “
Castiel was hard, Dean could feel it now through his dirty jeans.  The angel moaned into Dean’s mouth, and the sound shot straight to his groin.  Dean pinned Castiel against the large tree, thrusting against him wildly.  It created a friction that was both too much and not enough, and still they held on for dear life, their tongues wound together.
this works, Sam – he’s gonna be a mess.  So look out for him, okay?  Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid.”
.  In fact, sometimes, Dean wondered if something would have happened between the two of them in Purgatory if it hadn’t been for the presence of Benny, and the steady stream of monsters they had fought.
Dean wasn’t gay.  He wasn’t even convinced that he was bisexual, although he’d entertained the idea.  He had always noticed when men were attractive, but he couldn’t remember ever being
Two hours later, there was still no cupid.  Actually, the bar was almost empty aside from the bartender and one patron watching the television.  After about twenty minutes, Castiel had gone outside to scout prospective females and bring them into the bar.  Dean thought that perhaps Castiel would do more harm than good at this endeavor, but in honor of their newly repaired friendship, he kept his opinions to himself.  After all, if a cupid was involved, it was likely that this man’s soul mate would find him with or without Castiel’s help; all they had to do was wait.
Castiel gave a reluctant but agreeable look to Dean and opened up the door.
“I believe it allowed me to find my way back to you once I was free of the Leviathans,” Castiel added, still smiling.  “And finally, it allowed me to find you again this time, after the Empty.”
“Of course,” said Castiel, resisting the urge to hug Dean again.
“Wait, you're in danger?  From who, the angels?” snapped Dean, irritation and panic threatening to explode.
“I know they do,” said Castiel defensively.  “But I don't regret what I did, even if it costs me my life.”
Dean felt an odd texture against his left shoulder, and it was the small bottle of lubricant, held up by Castiel’s right hand.
A few people in the audience were breathing sighs of relief, but most of them were either laughing or else looking at their partners with sappy looks like Justin and Tyler.
, and I commit to you that I won’t sleep with anyone else.”
did.  It was a trick demons used to use in battle, though it’s fallen out of style in the last couple hundred years.  They would feed Angel Amore to humans, or even demons in the general vicinity, and the angels would become distracted so that the demons could gain the upper hand.”
Season 10, Part 4
“Cas?” Sam asked, after Castiel hung up, stirring on the couch.
Early the next morning, both Sam and Dean left to chase a lead on Rowena.  Dean wanted to stay behind, but Castiel begged him to leave.  His thoughts were scattered, and he’d spent most of the remainder of the night convulsing.  It would be easier, he hoped, without Dean around to tempt the beast spell.
“What are they doing?” Castiel asked conversationally, leaning against a large tree next to Dean.
Finally, near the end of February, Castiel found him.  A demon now, he had clearly gone mental.  He had decided that all of his descendants – nearly 1/10 of the world – were tainted with his lineage, and had resolved to kill them all.
Castiel’s erection stood proud as he laid the trenchcoat on the hood of the Impala.
Suddenly, there was a voice behind them.  “I am glad to see you are getting along,” said T.L. Laurant.  “I was worried there for a second.  I
“It was for the best, perhaps,” Castiel said. “She was learning about humanity, and how important it is to protect them.  But, in the process, I believe she was developing feelings for me.  She kissed me, and I was unsure how to respond.”
“Yeah, I've been trying to reach out, but for whatever reason, I wasn't at full power,” said Castiel.  “So I couldn't connect with you.”
Shifty, in a way that Dean hadn’t been able to put his finger on at the time.
“Thanks,” Sam said, his eyes dancing.  “We’re gonna name him Dean.”
He smiled sinisterly.  “And it’s the first time I
“A witch?” asked Castiel, rolling his eyes.
He felt something inside him cry out in pain.
Similarly, Dean spent a week determinedly
Dean and Castiel took a ride in the impala.  Cas smiled in the passenger seat, and it was so similar to so many years ago that it might have been a memory…
Castiel didn’t have this confusion.  He knew he loved Dean.  He was comfortable with their bond.  sdsdsasfSFDsSDadsfdsgdsfdafadsfHHHHHHxcCXcxzx
“Is that typical?”  Castiel asked.  “For one person to be mean to another when they’re not sure how they feel?”
flinched away from his friend all night… but it was because he hadn’t wanted to be anywhere near the temptation…
Boring.
The African gentleman was silent.
“Um, his name is Ezekiel.  He's cool.  I mean, I think he is.”
In response, Dean shot forward in an attempt to reach something next to the bed.
“Cas-…”
“What do you want?” Dean asked wearily.
it were, but…”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said.  At least that part was true.  This whole trip to the bunker was starting to remind him of the year he had spent deceiving the Winchesters.  He was determined, though.  Dean would understand, in the end.  He’d have to.
“It’s forgotten, Cas,” Dean said.  “It’s all forgotten.”  Castiel crowded into Dean’s space and kissed him, softly, as though asking a question.  He pulled Dean closer with one hand, curling the other hand into the hair on the back of Dean’s neck.  Dean inhaled, and electricity shot down his spine.
“Yeah,” Castiel said happily.  “I could be your third wheel.”
“Of course,” said Castiel, pulling out a chair for Dean.  “Dean, you know I always appreciate our talks, our time together.”
“If Ishim can help me find whoever killed Benjamin, then I have to,” said Castiel.
There was something odd in Dean’s voice, Castiel registered.  It was lower, huskier than usual.  He must be responding to the Angel Amore, as Castiel had predicted.  The angel held back a shiver of pleasure.  “I’ve… wanted, yes,” said Castiel slowly.  “Not as… potent… as a human, perhaps, at least… not until now, but I’ve…”
Dean moved closer, putting a hand on Castiel’s knee.  He needed… he wasn’t sure.  It wasn’t sex, exactly, or at least, it wasn’t
Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but Joshua stopped him.  “Castiel, do you know why I waited on the sidelines for so long?”
Castiel gave him a look like a kicked puppy, but obediently withdrew his hand.  Dean sighed a sigh of relief.
In desperation, he finally plucked up the courage to ask Dean something he’d been thinking about for awhile.  “Dean,” he said one day in early November.  “Can I ask you a question?”
“What’s this drink?” he asked Justin, more gruffly than he intended.
“As far as you know,” said Ishim.
“No, you're not,” the other angel said.  “They still hold a lot of grudges up there.  But what if I told you, you could come back?  That all your sins could be forgotten?  Forgiven?”
done the same thing.
“I don’t care,” said Ramiel, and there was a crazed look in his eye.  “I don’t care who you are. I don’t care why you’re here.  I don’t care about Heaven or Hell or anything.  I don’t even care that Lucifer’s got a bun in the oven.”
“What have I done to you?!” Naomi screeched at him, incredulous.  “Do you have any idea what it's like out there?  There's blood everywhere, and it's on your hands.  After everything you did -- to us, to Heaven.  I fixed you, Castiel.  I fixed you!”
“Pretty much, yeah,” Dean said.  “How are you doing?”  He didn’t finish the question.
Sam didn’t come back until the next day, and he didn’t say a word to Castiel or Dean about the reason he left.
“He was begging for help and then he just stopped,” said Castiel, his patience wearing thin.  “I need to know if he's still alive.”
Five minutes later, Dean was glad he had stormed into the diner.  He had decided that Ishim was one of the douchiest angels he had ever met (which was saying something).
?” asked Sam.  “Because I really think Cas - …”
“Dean,” Castiel said, finally letting go of him.  “You're alive?”  Thank God.
“Cas, you’re not – are you sleeping with anyone else?”
Dean peeled down the covers and his own boxers as quickly as possible, then started in on Castiel’s boxer-briefs more slowly, uncovering him one inch of skin at a time.
Finally, in early April, Dean, Sam, Crowley, and Rowena worked out a decent plan to trap Lucifer, which predictably went almost immediately awry.  Lucifer was simply too powerful for any trap they knew how to set.  Crowley (also predictably) disappeared as soon as things began to go south, and Dean and Sam were left to face Lucifer’s wrath.
things?  Since
“Dean, I can fix that,” Castiel said guiltily, reaching across the table to do his best.  In fact, he doubted he had enough grace to fix them completely, but he could at least lessen the pain some.
Castiel tucked himself back into his pants, trying to remember when exactly he had unzipped and dropped trough.  That last hour had been the worst, especially after Dean had disappeared, though he had a feeling he had dropped his pants before that.  He slowly put his shoes and socks back on – those, at least, he remembered taking off, shortly after he was handcuffed when his vessel became hot.  He pulled at the remainder of his dress shirt, already partway torn, and it came off in long strips.
“I’m going to go visit Ladyheart’s manager in the morning, and Feathers here is planning to pay a visit to Ladyheart’s bandmate to try to find this mysterious come-back show.”
“What was that?” asked Sam, his eyes wide.
Castiel nodded.  “Tommy is not as well guarded, and already suspicious of Vince.”
Finally, Castiel sighed.  “What do you want to know?”
By June, the change that the Mark of Cain had wrought on Dean’s body and soul was now visible, at least to an angel.  He was significantly stronger, faster, and meaner.  His soul was twisting, demon-like, an undulating mass constricting an otherwise still somehow mostly pure light.
“What’s that?” he asked Castiel and Mary, his eye settling on a bulletin board in the corner.
“What happens tomorrow?”
The child had to die.
Dean frowned, and Castiel could tell that if he pushed any harder his friend would make an excuse to get off the phone.  “When I’m done killing Abaddon, I’ll figure out a way to get rid of it.”
“Blow job,” Dean said, shrugging it off with a grin.  Then, when Castiel still seemed confused, Dean added in a whisper, “Fellatio.”
No, there was
“There is a way we haven’t considered,” he said.
Cas!”
“You’re going to have to pick up the search for Lucifer without me for a few days,” Crowley said.
Upon returning to the bunker, Castiel hadn’t even removed his hand from Dean’s shoulder before Sam shouted, “Dean - THAT'S NOT CAS!”
Castiel stepped backward, realizing that Dean was embarrassed.  “I could go with you,” he offered.
Castiel walked toward the bathroom.  Was he… was he going to shower in Dean’s room?  He knew things were different now, right?  They didn’t do
When Dean looked up again, Castiel was fine, staring behind Dean at Crowley.  Dean swung around to find Crowley holding two broken pieces of Ramiel’s Lance of Michael.
Unfortunately, that promise was blown to smithereens as soon as he entered the bunker, and was banished by a British human woman with no explanation.  By the time he managed to hitchhike back to the bunker from where he had landed, it was late into the night and he was irritated.
of some puffed-up supernatural being-…
“I tried, so many times, to tell you.  But there was always some world-ending Apocalypse that took priority.  First it was dangerous to tell you, and then you hated me, and later on it seemed…”  He looked at Dean pleadingly and started again.  “You don’t like chick flick moments, Dean, and you don’t like angels.  We’ve always been ‘just us, Dean and Cas,’ and that was more than I ever could’ve asked for!  I didn’t want you to think we were something more than you were comfortable with.  This is the first time I even had hope that if I told you, you might still want to see me again.”
“I hitched a ride to Salt Lake City,” Castiel said seriously.  “I have nothing, and my grace is low.  Will you come pick me up?”
“'Cause if you do, the angels will kill you,” Dean said, understanding.
something he could do about Ramiel.
He felt the anger… it felt like when he was a demon, and he had to kill.  His heart seemed to beat in his ears, and he saw red.
How could Castiel not realize that he was the one person Dean had wanted to talk to the most?  That he had been dreading it, dreading finding out that he couldn’t, that it wasn’t real…
Kevin nodded.
Castiel seemed to brighten just slightly.  “You really believe we three will be enough?” asked Castiel.
The Impala swerved first into the other lane and then nearly into a ditch, but Dean managed at the last second to curb his surprise and steer her back into the appropriate lane.  Meanwhile Sam, who had been asleep in the passenger seat, gave an almighty snort and swung around, gun in hand.
“It ain't, ya idjit,” said Bobby.
“I'll watch over you,” offered Castiel.
When he got back to the bunker, Sam explained to him that Dean had confronted the Darkness while he had fought off demons, but the Darkness had somehow managed to escape.  In turn, Castiel explained what had happened with Metatron.
“Dean?” asked Castiel.  They were cuddling, and it was different, Dean thought… but a good kind of different.  He felt safe, and happy.
“Yeah,” he said, nodding.  “Well, that’s usually how it goes.”
“Cas?” Sam asked.
“I...”
kind of night.
“Until you become the monster,” said Castiel, standing up to face Dean squarely.
