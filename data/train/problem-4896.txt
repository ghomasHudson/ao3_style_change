“But do you want me to stop?” Tony croaked as he came up for air, grinning impishly at Steve’s glowering face. He took that as a no, getting back to work, sucking and licking Steve’s cock until Steve’s legs trembled and the aborted jerks of his hips grew into gentle thrusts.
He raised his head so he could see Tony’s face in the throes of passion; his eyes closed and soft mouth forming a small “o” around ardent moans as Steve gave him everything of himself. The love rearing up inside of him was so strong, he felt lightheaded for a moment.
Steve’s grin was so bright, it was like staring directly into the sun. He kissed Tony, hard and deep, leaving them both breathless by the time he drew back.
Steve jumped over the flailing soldier. He had to keep moving, he needed to find his friends, to know they were safe. Blood was running into his eyes, painting the world around him in red. The din of the battle was a dull rumble in his ears, drowned out by the pounding of his heart; pulse hammering hard enough to make stars dance before his eyes.
“Sam and Nat are on that. We didn’t find Schmidt but that dick can suck himself and choke on it. We prioritized finding our men over him and I’ve been looking for you two.”
“I did,” Steve nodded without remorse. “I didn’t like the look of him, he’s probably an asshole. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’d tried to lay his hands on you.”
“I’m so sorry, your Highness,” he ground out between clenched teeth. “I’ll just take my omega and we’ll be on our way.”
A slow smile spread over Steve’s face; it was so wide his cheeks ached. “You forget something, jerk.”
“Fuck!” Tony swore too loudly, but the key finally slotted into the hole and he managed to unlock it just as a hand clamped down hard on the nape of his neck. Tony’s knees went weak as shivers of repulsion made his stomach roil. A strong wave of nausea swept through him when a hard body pressed up against his back, forcing him flush against the door. Salvation was but inches away, but with it firmly shut and him mashed against it, it might as well have been miles.
“I’m still waiting,” Bucky remarked at them when they didn’t react beyond staring at the thick piece of wood and contemplated how close that had been.
“You hear that, Steve?” Sam taunted, latching on to Bucky’s teasing. “Tony thinks Thor has a great smile.”
“I do,” Steve said, reaching up to comb his fingers through Tony’s long, black, hair, arranging the silky mess attractively around Tony’s lovely face. “You?”
“Steve,” Tony said slowly. “This is Sarah’s heart.” He had to look down at the thick, golden chains and the big, heart-shaped ruby attached in the middle of them, framed on white silk bedding. It was the most gorgeous and famous choker in all of Brooklyn, considering the late queen had always worn it around her throat.
He deflated against the bars, harsh pants echoing in the cavernous room. “Fuck!” he hissed, exhausted. What the hell was he going to do?
Rhodes shook his head, smiling. “I’ll see you later, Omega Stark. I’m looking forward to seeing what else you’ll come up with.”
Bodies were everywhere – Doom’s men and theirs mixed together into a macabre display of what the worst of humanity had to offer. It made Steve’s stomach roil and Tony made a gagging noise beside him.
“You’ll be careful?” Tony questioned softly and looked up, meeting Steve’s tender, love-filled gaze.
“ Steve got out just as Tony started to move, and his protest got lost on a garbled groan. Tony rose and fell, arching his back as he rocked back and forth in a rhythm as old as time. His head felt too heavy to stay upright and he relaxed his neck, letting it fall back so that his hair tickled Steve’s groin and thighs, eyes shutting in bliss.
Pulling back, he regarded Steve seriously for a long moment before replying, “I do. Forever and ever. I’ll never love anyone the way I love you, with all that I am.”
“On time,” Tony scoffed and batted at her. “We’re not at war right now, Pep, they can wait another day – three tops.”
“Hold on,” Steve said. “I’d like to know what this was all about. I assume the omega you… told off wasn’t your mate?”
Tony rested there, getting used to the feeling of Steve inside, stretching him wide and touching spots his toys had never managed. It felt so good, his head so filled with the pleasure and Steve, he wasn’t able to categorize all of the sensations properly at once.
Tony grinned up at her, teeth gleaming straight and white in the dim light of the room. “That will be all, Mistress Potts.”
“Yeah, okay,” Tony mumbled. It felt like his tongue was too thick for his mouth and his head was swimming. Steve smelled so good, Tony wanted to rub himself all over him and take his knot deep and lock them together forever.
“It still would’ve been nice to have you at my side instead of knowing you were giving that upstart omega your attention,” Tony muttered to the floor, even as Steve’s unwavering faith in him made his aching heart swell.
He could feel his orgasm approaching, could feel Steve’s knot swell and grow, catching against his swollen rim until he couldn’t do much else but grind and rock, slowly locking them together.
He’d been stripped of armor and shield as soon as they’d caught him – leaving him in his short loincloth and sandals to trudge the long way to one of Schmidt’s lairs – hidden deep within the mountain range separating Brooklyn from Bronx.
With flourish, Stone whips the cape from the omega’s head and shoulders, revealing a truly spectacular beauty of a man. His long, glossy black hair is free and falls down over his shoulders to his waist. He’s dressed in a waistcloth of silk in greens and blues, similar to Tony’s but shorter, his body adorned with gilded bands, chains in gold and silver and jewels. He’s slim with good muscle definition, not a blemish on his flawless, caramel colored skin and his face is so stunningly good-looking, Tony’s teeth ache from clenching them so hard. But the most striking fact about the young omega is his eyes. Bright blue and rimmed with kohl, they stand out starkly against his dark skin. Aside from Steve, Tony didn’t ever think such a beautiful person existed.
Tony can’t believe his ears. Of all the pretentious, conceited crap he’s ever heard, this takes the crown. And then a thought strikes him like lightning from a clear sky. Suddenly it’s all so clear, Stone’s plot unfolds in his mind’s eye – like a ripple effect from a stone thrown into a still pond. The deed for transfer of ownership, no one but Steve meant to know about it, fucking Hani, and Stone… doing someone else’s dirty work.
Chuckling, Tony slumped into Steve even more, his head coming to rest on Steve’s shoulder. “I wanted to surprise you.”
“What do you think we converse about during our matches?” Thor answered, dryly. “Friend Steve’s prowess as a warrior is growing, for sure, but he is yet no match for me. We have to entertain ourselves with something while sparring.”
“Mm-hmm. Keep telling yourself that. I don’t understand why you just don’t accept his courting.Why do you resist it when both of you could be happy together?”
Steve frowned. Huh. That was interesting, considering he felt the exact same way. He made a mental note to ask Bruce to examine his blood later.
The crazy son of a bitch nursed grand delusions of starting a whole new race of super-people – bred from the best men and women they could get a hold of. The fact that most of the people were blond and blue-eyed wasn’t even the most disturbing part.
Steve snorts, amused, and slowly raises his hands to cup Tony’s shoulders. The calluses from many hours handling both sword and shield make Tony shudder with pleasure.
“Pregnant?” Steve croaked huskily into Tony’s neck, not daring to lift his head and look Tony in the eye as hope so strong it had him tearing up swept through him.
“A boy and a – “ Steve’s head spun again, and it wasn’t all from more than two weeks of little food and water and emotional exhaustion. He had to sit down.
Steve’s hand slams the door shut again and he crowds Tony up against it, strong arms wrapping around him and holding him tight. “Calm down, Tony.”
“My mother’s,” Steve confirmed with a sad smile. “My father commissioned this for her on the day of their claiming and she wanted me to give it to my mate, when the time came. That’s why I didn’t get to see you the other day, at the feast. I was busy arguing with my father over you. For the nth time, I might add.”
Steve laughs and joins him on the bed, and Tony silently makes a new vow to himself. As Steve kisses his way down Tony’s chest and stomach, Tony swear he will never let his old insecurities get the better of him and doubt Steve ever again. He will trust the love he feels for his alpha and the love Steve has for his omega.
Tony was grinning now, too. “I call it black powder. Packs quite a punch even in small amounts. I’ve a few ideas of how we can use it to make long-range weapons with three-times the destructive power of a trebuchet.”
Steve let out a long, relieved sight. “Thank you, sweetheart.” He pressed his lips against Tony’s forehead and they remained like that for a moment, soaking in the other’s scent and love before their separation.
“You can’t stop me,” Tony told his alpha stubbornly. “I won’t fucking allow you to go out and fight that megalomaniac bastard without me!”
Tony’s head shoots up. Stone stands before him, a self-satisfied smile on his face as he hungrily stares down at Tony’s.
Tony had just been about to swallow a mouthful of water but at Bruce’s words he choked on it. Sputtering and coughing, Tony eyeballed Bruce disbelievingly through watery eyes.
“I’m really cranky in the mornings and I hate to be told what to do. I can be a bit stubborn, I won’t tolerate bullshit or kowtow to idiots and I absolutely refuse to cater to your every whim.”
Stumped, Tony stared unseeing at the side of Steve’s neck, disbelieving. “You still want to court me?”
They sat like that for a long while, entwined and joined in the most intimate way, basking in their happiness until they could go out and shut everyone ever doubting them the fuck up.
“He can’t, Fury,” Steve said apologetically. “I’m just showing him around and then we’re expected to have dinner with the diplomat from Queens.”
The blow came so fast, Steve had trouble seeing the alpha’s fist as he punched the omega right in the face. The omega went down like a bag of bricks and Steve moved before he knew what he was doing. In seconds he was on the bigger alpha, hitting him square in the jaw. He took the man by surprise and sent him reeling but he recovered fast, facing Steve with a growl. Steve growled right back and readied himself for an ugly fight but before he could do anything, Bucky was between them, holding out his hands.
Tony slowly unraveled the red silk bow and peeled back the expensive wrapping. Revealing a small, nondescript box, it gave no clue to what it held within.
Steve eyed Tony and his armor. “How hard did you hit him?” he motioned with his chin at the dead man.
“This is your doing,” Tony accused. “Loki, of all people, would never write a letter to me and all but tell me I’m going, with Patrick, and staying there for a few weeks.”
Tony smiled back, pleased and flirty. “Consort Stark is so inclined, your Majesty. What did your Majesty have in mind?”
Tony’s smile was small and a little private, as if he was thinking of a joke only he was privy of. “I’ll always come for you, Steve. You’re stuck with me for as long as you want me.”
“Do you ever have to explain yourself to someone after you’ve said no?” Tony’s voice was saccharin but underlaid with a deeper, colder tone. “I know you’re not stupid, Steve. I shouldn’t have to explain myself - to you or anyone - but here we are and I’m sitting here, looking like an unreasonable bitch who doesn’t know what’s good for him. Right?”
“My ploy,” Stone says slowly, like he’s talking to a child. It makes Tony’s hackles rise. “I never thought I’d be able to come between you and your king. But look.” He makes a sweeping motion, encompassing the two of them. “Here we stand. You, me… alone.” Stone takes a step closer, making Tony back up. He does not want Stone any closer than this.
“But I want you,” Tony said, helpless. “I-I’m in love with you, Steve! I’m scared as fuck and I don’t know what to do with that but I’m so fucking in love with you I’d let you do anything to me!”
A relieved expression stole over Steve’s face and he exhaled shakily. It was like all of his bones just melted away and he sank down on top of Tony, resting his weight on his elbows at each side of Tony’s head, but enough of him pressed against Tony to make him feel enveloped and safe in Steve’s embrace.
“Aye,” Thor said with a great sigh. “He is the omega my heart has chosen. It makes me a fool I suppose, as he has yet to speak even a word to me, despite my most ardent attempts to woo him.”
Stone gives an enraged sound, his voice garbled when it comes out, “You broke my fucking nose you fucking- “
“We promise. Just look,” an elderly woman reassured as she helped him to his feet and turned him to the mirror behind him.
Steve smiled. It wasn’t a pleasant smile. “See, that’s where you’re wrong,” he said in an echo of the decked omega. “I can’t stand by and let my subjects suffer unwarranted punishment. I want you to tell me what your mate did that made you feel the need to… discipline him in such a manner.”
Steve groaned at that and claimed Tony’s mouth in a fierce kiss, as if he couldn’t resist the pull between them anymore. It was different from all the other times they’d kissed; more potent, stronger and deeper than Tony was used to. Had Steve held back before? The thought sent a wave of want and longing through him, strong and undeniable, his knees almost buckled. Steve’s hands snaked around his naked back, gliding over his oiled skin with relish, plundering Tony’s plush, welcoming mouth with such fervor it made Tony shiver from the heady pleasure coursing through him.
Steve leaned back and took Tony’s face in his hands, softly encouraging Tony to look at him until he could stare deep into Tony’s eyes, thumbs stroking wet cheeks lovingly.
“No- yes, but it’s not what you think,” Steve amended when Tony glanced at him askance. “Patrick’s friends, Adam and Davy- “
“There, at the north edge,” Tony told him again and pointed. “Bucky’s got a broken leg but Nat got him to safety. I stumbled over Clint and sent him to them. I think something’s wrong with his hearing, he just stared at me and I had to shout really loud for him to hear me.”
“I don’t think your nose is broken; it looks more bruised.” Steve said and touched the tip of his nose carefully.
Tony wailed when his climax slammed into him out of nowhere, with the force of a ballistic spear, vision blurring, no sound able to reach him as he was drowned and lost in a vast ocean of pleasure. He dimly registered Steve’s voice rising into a roar of triumph and wetness filling him along with the knot swelling anew, but it was all background noise at that point, not important enough to try and rouse any kind of coherence for.
“Saving your ass.” Tony’s smile was wobbly and Steve had to kiss him. He didn’t care if he was dirty and dressed his rags; he had to get his lips on Tony. It felt like he couldn’t breathe properly without Tony’s lips against his. Tony didn’t seem to mind, kissing back just as passionately, not caring about the sour stench from Steve’s unwashed body.
“I want to take you to bed and make love to you all night,” Steve breathes into Tony’s hair, lips caressing his forehead and brow. “I want to hold you in my arms and fall asleep with you snoring in my ear and know I get to wake up to you tomorrow. And the day after that I want to do the same thing again. Over and over, for the rest of our lives.”
“If we cut them off at this canyon, we can effectively herd them against the river through this small passage here.” Natasha pointed at the map spread out in front of them. “We’ll bottleneck them here and they’ll be forced to fight a losing battle or drown in the river.”
He deflated as the will to fight drained out of him, leaving him with an empty sensation that felt a lot like loss. “I don’t want you to send me away.”
At that, Steve’s face softens and his eyes shine with love. “I’ve talked to the physician more than enough to know what to expect when you get older, sweetheart. I want to take care of you, to do that I need to know about… what did you say? Crap like that.” The grin curving his mouth is boyish and a little shy both; it reminds Tony of the boy Steve had been, back then, the boy he’d given his heart to so many years ago.
“I won’t allow it!” Tony growled angrily. Steve thought Tony might even be a bit hurt, going by the way his eyes misted over. He didn’t dare to voice this thought, however. Tony’s hormones were already out of whack enough as it was, Steve didn’t need to put fuel to the fire.
“I’d punch anyone daring to try,” Steve promised grimly and with a giddy giggle, born out of pure joy, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s shoulders and pulled him down over him on the bed. The sound of their happy laughter and kisses filled the formerly, lonely space Tony had inhabited for so long by himself.
“You’re an asshole,” Patrick told his brother sulkily while getting to his feet with an annoyed expression.
“Really?” Tony wanted to make sure. “Can I take Bruce with me? I don’t want to leave him alone in the forge.”
“I think we should move on, Steve,” he mumbled with a nervous look around them. More and more people were beginning to recognize their crown-prince; it wasn’t that hard after all. Steve was tall, blond and blue-eyed - inherited traits from his mother - in a country where the most common traits were short stature, dark hair and dark eyes.
Steve didn’t feel reassured at all, especially when a beam from the ceiling chose that moment to come crashing down right behind them.
“That’s the heat talking,” Steve panted, a fine sheen of sweat covering his face and Tony could make out through his hazy sight that Steve was trembling all over. “I refuse to do anything to you without your consent, Tony.”
Then, to Steve’s astonished horror, the omega spat right in the alpha’s  face and said, “Go fuck yourself, you fucking disgrace of an alpha.”
“You just watch it, Stark!” Rumlow shouted. “Next time I see you I’ll make better use of that fucking mouth of yours!”
“Leave the forge to me, my love,” Tony giggled and scooted up so he could take Steve’s mouth in a soft kiss. “You can just stand and look pretty while I make wonders.”
Raucous laughter from just outside of the main door had the servants snap out of their admiring trance and they quickly filed out of the small, servants entrance behind them, giggling and wishing him good luck and happy Claiming.
Patrick fidgeted and refused to look at his father. Steve had a suspicion he’d said something he shouldn’t have and Rhia had most likely called him out on his bullshit.
Tony stared hard into Steve’s angry eyes, gearing up to keep arguing when the anguished glint in them pulled him up short. Steve was livid, for sure, but Tony could see how hard he tried to mask the fear fueling his actions in this moment.
That made Tony laugh. “That’s actually kind of romantic, Prince Thor. You’re giving Loki what he wants without even talking to him.”
Tony spoke with a clear and confident voice, his eyes staring right into Steve’s very soul. “This is my gift to my King and mate; may your days be blessed. It is my most sincere wish that this will become a symbol of our nation and our vision of a peaceful, prosperous future.”
“I wager it will only take Hani another hour to charm your king into bed, don’t you think?” Stone’s smooth voice drops an octave lower, rumbling in Tony’s ear and making goosebumps of revulsion break out across his back when the other alpha comes impossibly closer, his chest a hair’s breadth from touching Tony’s arm.
“Uh…” Tony tried to make his way back from the pleasant haze of pleasure he’d slowly slipped into. He squinted and thought for a moment. “Since two years ago?”
Yeah, what business did two, poor omegas have at the castle at a feast thrown by the King himself in honor of the tournament and its champion?
Finally, Tony deflates, breathing heavily with sweat running down his neck and back. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he whimpers. “Why didn’t you trust me?”
“You don’t believe omegas need an alpha to vote for them, handle their money and monitor every aspect of their lives?” Tony wondered, skeptically. He’d never heard an alpha say a word against the restricting laws concerning omegas.
“The feast. In the castle. With all of the nobles in Manhattan and some from Asgard too? That feast?”
“You said it was okay!” Steve roars. “I did it to keep Stone in the dark until tomorrow. I planned to reveal I knew everything to him and then toss him out with my fucking shield stuck to his forehead!”
Inside, Patrick and Rhia stood toe to toe, screaming at each other for all their worth. Peter sat on the floor beside them, taking in their anger with a wide-eyed stare, lower lip wobbling dangerously. They were so absorbed by their fight; they didn't even notice the audience in the door.
“I threw something together in the lab before I came here, it’s fine,” Tony assured him. “We still have plenty of time.”
Tony had to laugh through his tears. “I’m a hot mess and I love you so, so much, Steve,” he finished on another sob, shaking with the strength of it.
“We were discussing the merits of omegas as soldiers in our last lesson,” she said primly, right on cue, “Patrick had a lot to say on the topic and I told him where he’s wrong. He didn’t like it.”
Tony’s smile was blinding, clapping with the others in a deafening applause and in that moment, Steve didn’t care about the crown, his subjects or his friends – all he could think was:
Tony’s heart was breaking. He wanted to say yes so badly, wanted Steve to sweep him off of his feet and claim him and marry him and make good on his words and change the world for all the omegas in Brooklyn.
“You’re a fucking troll.” Tony had to laugh, charmed. He couldn’t even find it in himself to get mad. “You followed me here, didn’t you?”
“Uh…” Tony glanced at the alpha – what was his name again? – “I-I don’t think that’s a good idea,” he hedged, trying to be diplomatic. The alpha wasn’t pleased and Tony could almost see the sum of gold he was promised go up in smoke.
Hani didn’t seem to be in a hurry to let anyone – alpha or beta – claim him. Steve and Tony weren’t about to force him when he clearly wasn’t ready. They were content to let Hani keep on teaching the kids; he was so far the only one who’d managed to last for this long.
Steve ignored him and guided him inside his bedroom, gently helping him until he could sit down on the edge of the small bed. Steve backed up like he’d been scalded as soon as he’d made sure Tony wouldn’t tumble ass over kettle down on the floor. He stood in the doorway, shifting his weight from foot to foot, hesitating.
“I’m not going anywhere!” Tony hissed hotly. “I can’t leave when Schmidt is basically standing on our threshold.”
Tony snorted and before Steve could stop him, he darted ahead, running and jumping over bodies on nimble feet towards safety. “Fat chance!” he threw tauntingly over his shoulder.
“I won’t make you tell me, Tony,” Steve promised solemnly. “The forge is yours to command as you wish. I can’t really claim I know much about forging; I’ll leave that to you.”
“Everything okay?” Nat whispers when he comes closer to her, where she stands guard beside the door with Clint on the other side.
The alpha paused and took a good look at Steve, eyes widening when he recognized him. Steve could hear the calls from guards; someone must’ve alerted them to the altercation and they were on their way to intervene. The alpha clearly heard them too because he relaxed and backed up, bowing his head in false acquiescence to Steve.
“Steve!” Tony sobbed so hard it racked his whole body. He shuddered as Steve, with his gentle hands and gentle voice, lifted him up and held him close to his chest. He couldn’t tell who was shaking worse, him or Steve, but he cuddled up close in an attempt to burrow under Steve’s skin as he was carried inside.
Steve had been more than happy to cater to Tony’s expressed whish of staying for a moment longer. He’d stood back after the introductions, smiling amusedly while Tony curiously hovered right behind their factory chief, Nick Fury, as he’d argued with the chief-engineer, James Rhodes, and Happy, the foreman, about calculations or something of that nature. It’d flow right over Steve’s head but from what he could understand, the catapult wasn’t working as it should.
“Put him in a cell and keep him there. I think he needs to cool his head for a while,” Steve ordered when they were done.
The crown was cold and heavy when it was placed upon his head, heavier than Steve had imagined – as if it came with the weight of the whole kingdom and its people; their lives and wishes now Steve’s responsibility to lead and defend to the best of his abilities.
“I refuse to wait another day to claim you,” Steve told him seriously. “I want all of Brooklyn to know you’re mine.”
Now, fifteen years later, Steve never went anywhere without Bucky a step behind, ready to back him up in case of trouble. And, Steve had to admit as he made his way through the crowd towards the center of the commotion, he had a knack for getting into trouble on the best of days. Bucky swore behind him and clamped a hand on Steve’s shoulder, halting his steps where the throng of people began to thin. Steve caught a glance of a large man and a smaller one in front of him, before Bucky stopped him.
Tony freezes in the middle of fastening a band of three, interwoven gold chains around his throat, more of a choker than that of a traditional collar.
Clint snorted. “Please. It’d take a week before you’d come crawling back, begging us to take your helions off your hands for a few hours.”
“Thanks, handsome, but you can stand down now.” Not waiting for a reply, Stark turned to the omega cowering on the ground. He was shaking and muttering and flinched when Stark crouched down and gently placed a hand on his shaking shoulder.
He turned his back on Steve and started to climb over a pile of bodies only to come up short when Steve’s hand grabbed the back of his gambeson, not allowing him to get any further.
“Yeah,” Tony croaked. He got up on shaky legs, wobbling dangerously and he nearly fell but Steve caught him before he could crash to the floor. The moan Tony let out when he found himself pressed against Steve’s hard body was entirely involuntarily.
Steve took a deep breath, the blush slowly receding from his face. “I would like to give you this gift and get permission to court you,” he repeated sincerely, a hopeful smile hesitantly curving his mouth.
“My shield!” Steve exclaimed, the sight of it with its white star filling him with such relief his knees turned weak.
He knows Steve, he knows Steve would never take another omega into their relationship, let alone into their bed, even if it’s common practice. After more than twenty years as mates, Tony knows Steve on such a deep level, some days it feels like they can read each other’s minds. Bucky and Clint always complain about their ability to talk with glances and looks instead of words, and most days Tony can’t even say they’re wrong.
“I get stuck in my own head and forget about things like eating or sleeping when I’m working and I’ll most likely forget your birthday or our anniversary.”
“I think you should,” Tony answered loftily, bursting out laughing when Steve gave a mock growl and tackled him to the floor. Suffice to say, they were a little late for dinner.
He had no idea how long he’d been in this hellhole, but if he’d make an educated guess, he figured it had been at least two weeks since their capture. The cell was small and dark, damp glittering on the walls and the air so cold Steve’s breath misted every time he exhaled.
Bucky stirred after a couple of hours; groaning and whimpering intermittently as he tried to get up from the floor. Steve could only watch helplessly from his pallet, the thin blanket he’d wrapped around himself barely able to hold the worst of the cold at bay.
The nervousness he’d felt earlier had evaporated, leaving behind a desperate need to feel Steve inside of him, to have his knot locked tightly inside, filling him to his breaking point.
Steve focuses on old battle wounds, skimming over them one after other. “These are the proof of someone who is a brave, loyal and fearless warrior, who never flinches or backs down when he needs to stand up and fight to protect his people.”
“It’s actually one of the things I love most about you, your Highness. You’re also infallibly kind, brave, righteous and one of the best men I’ve ever met.” Tony lifted the collar out of the box, offering it to Steve. “Put this on me?”
“No!” Steve exclaimed, sounding both angry and hurt. “I think I would remember, you know, if I’d been invited to the Claiming, which I was not!”
“Hail King Steven!” Yinsen rumbled as Steve rose to his feet and turned to face them; his feeble voice amplified by the acoustic of the room. The gathered people stood as one and said, “Hail King Steven!” in a thundering echo, the bells up in the tower above the throne room ringing out their joyous message to the rest of the city.
“Friend Tony, then,” Thor nodded. “But think of my words, will you not? You have nothing to gain from keeping him and yourself miserable.”
Steve smirked victoriously when Tony’s gaze snapped to his. “Hi there,” he said, pleasantly, like his thrusts weren’t gaining momentum as his knot diminished inside of Tony, making it easier for Steve to fuck his thick cock in and out of Tony’s sensitive opening with increasing vigor.
Tony looked at him like he was a moron. “Could I squash myself into this if I was?” he wondered, a hand indicating the armor, which definitely wasn’t wide enough to accommodate a pregnant person. “The kids are safe in Asgard.”
“Do you have the- “ Steve hissed out of the corner of his mouth, never taking his eyes off of Tony. He was a sight to behold; dressed in a waistcloth of blue silk, honey-brown eyes rimmed with kohl and adorned with all of the royal jewels in blue and green Steve had chosen out of the vault. His hair was a mass of silky, black, strands cascading down to the middle of his back and he was so fucking gorgeous, Steve’s dick tried to make an untimely appearance. He barely managed to suppress the persisting arousal in his loins.
So came it that Yinsen, the bishop of Manhattan, crowned Steve king with as much pomp and splendor he could muster, squeezing every drop of ceremonial gratification out of the long hour it took him to bless Steve, himself, and everyone else in the throne room.
Tony had concluded, since Steve had started what could only be a siege on him, that Steve could be a scary fucker when he put his mind to it. Stern paled and took an unconscious step back, eyes darting around the shabby foyer the longer Steve stared at him.
“Sorry, Tony,” Sam said without sounding sorry at all. “I can’t commit treason just because you’re fat and unhappy about it.”
“Can’t let me take the lead for five minutes even before taking over,” Tony huffed, adjusting the angle of his hips so the head of Steve’s cock glanced over his prostate on every pass.
Tony loved every second of it, raising his hips to meet Steve as best he could, encouraging moans echoing around their bedroom whenever Steve slowed down in his ardent worship of him, shouting praise to the Gods and whoever else was listening, as he wound his legs around Steve’s pumping hips, clamping tight and holding on.
“Look at yourself,” he orders in his softest voice. Tony refuses at first, just to be contrary. They both know he’d do anything Steve asked of him. At length, Tony does look at himself, gaze critically running over the scars littering his body, over the crow's-feet at the corners of his eyes, of the grey starting to creep into his beard.
The serious glint in Steve’s blue, blue eyes morphed into a playful one in a heartbeat, and Tony’s stomach warmed in anticipation. “Until then,” Steve said, “I’ll just have to overwhelm you, over and over again, and make sure you can’t walk straight tomorrow.”
“I’m fine.” Steve ignored Bucky’s grin and Sam’s snickers. They could take a long walk off a short pier as far as he was concerned; Steve was even going to be so kind and point them in the right direction.
Tony would never admit to anyone how his stomach erupted with thousands of butterflies when the door slammed open and Steve was carried inside on the shoulders of his friends and various nobles. They all stopped in their tracks when they caught sight of Tony and a hushed silence fell over them.
“None of that.” T’challa pleaded before he focused his attention on Winter, who was partially hiding behind Bucky’s leg.
Tony took a step back. He took a deep breath. He gave himself a mental pep talk. 'You got this Tony'. He pulled his shirt over his head. That was the easy part. Steve had seen his chest countless times. Steve was smiling sweetly at him. He reached for his shorts next. Should he pull the shorts down first and then his underwear or should he just pull them both down at the same time? Rip it off like a band aid right? Just pull everything down, he told himself.
“You’ve met him?” Steve realized. He had to remind himself that their children told Tony everything first.
Tony tried not to tear up or allow his emotions to get the best of him. “Believe me, we’re so happy to have you back.” Then they sat, facing each other.
Today she was at Morgan’s in her room with her and Torunn. The girls attempted to watch a movie to get Morgan’s mind of it, but it seemed like every movie they chose had some pregnant character in it. Amelia just resorted to playing some music in the background while they talked. Steve, who was practically living at the Stark Mansion had gone out of his way to make the girls a bunch of pastries. The chocolate chip cookie Amelia had just eaten melted in her mouth and she had to give Morgan’s dad his props. He truly was the better cooker – and baker between him and Tony. No question about it.
Steve was embarrassed and feeling guilty. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair what he’d left Tony to deal with. A 2-year-old, a 10-month-old and pregnant with twins while he was out having fun with his friends and ended up sleeping with one of them.
“Wanna use the bed?” came Wade’s suggestive tone. A shiver ran through Peter’s body for two reasons. One, Wade had scared the hell out of him. And two, he was getting sexually frustrated.
Mother’s Day came and on the day of, Morgan, Peter and Morgan’s kitten, Binx woke up to find Tony busying himself on the back lawn. There was a crew of people setting large tents up on the lawn, chairs and tables and containers of food being displayed among other things. Peter and Morgan had been woken by the commotion even though their rooms were a few floors up. They shared a look upon discovering their mother’s whereabouts before Morgan had to ask, what was happening.
Tony sighed, putting the knife down. “Pep. Tell me I did the right thing here because Peter hasn’t stop guilt-tripping me for it.”
Sam pulled his hair back and kissed his bare neck. Bucky whimpered at the sensation, his eyes fluttering and his knees weakening as one hand travelled down to his harden cock. Bucky turned around, smashing his lips against his husband’s. He mumbled his name as he pulled away. “Don’t you have work?” he asked.
“So, you weren’t working with him?” Harley chimed in. He figured he might as well ask, since his sisters had just ruined his wedding.
Carol ignored his response altogether and got back to the initial discussion. “I didn’t cheat on your father and neither did he. I met someone but I didn’t do anything with her.”
Morgan was a little caught off by the question. She tried to put the incident behind her, but she supposed Stephen had just been recently caught up with it all. “I’m great. Much better.”
“What?” It came out playful and extremely nonchalant. He didn’t believe that for a second. Tony thought it was a joke. It was a funny thing to say while at the appointment which was initially for an egg count test. Oh, the irony.
“That sounds like the early stages of a relationship.” Pepper teased. Carol got quiet. It did sound like that. "You're starting to remind me of Steve and you-know-who."
“How stupid can you be?” The boy doesn’t seem the slightest bit offended, so Steve continues. “I don’t want Tony. I just want my son back. I only got 3 days with him.” And Steve wonders why he mentioned the last part when it was clear, the kid was too far gone to sympathize.
And Tony turned around to face him at that, taking his face into his palms capturing his lips with his own and slipping his tongue pass his lips. “You most definitely deserve some.” Tony whispered against his lips. Steve’s hands found his ass. “Right now.” He finished.
Daniel had taken half his savings as it was ruled out in court. They'd only been married for 8 months when things fell apart. Tony was heartbroken because he really thought third times the charm, this would be the last time.
Tony glared at Tate at the mention of his infidelity and Tate realizes he needs to object. “Your honor. I don’t see how any of this is relevant to the case.”
“But who actually killed Hammer? Who pulled the trigger?” Peter asked. That’s all that mattered and what could have been a possible motive. He saw Harley retrieved his phone as it made a notification sound.
Tony was a crying, sobbing mess now and Maria quickly came to his aid, handing her son some tissues. “Stop making me cry.” He sniffled and everyone awed. “You make me so happy Steve. I am so thankful the universe chose me to be your lifelong partner and I am so excited to spend another
Winter was a happy child and Steve remembered clearly the day she was born. He found it a bit strange that they had named her Winter, knowing what Bucky had gone through in becoming the Winter Soldier. But Bucky explained that he couldn’t change the past. It was what made him, him as unfortunate as that was. He’d learned to forgive himself and move on from the darkness that came with the memory and wanted to give the word a new meaning. And what better way was there than to give the name to his and Sam’s miracle? Now every time he said the name Winter, he thought of their daughter. Steve thought it was kind of poetic after all was said and done. Sam actually cried more than he did during the birth.
“Fine.” And another kiss before he stood up straight and away from Tony’s face. “You want me to take the tray?” He noticed Tony had stopped eating.
“The Goddess of Thunder.” Loki announced “And the Goddess of Deceit. Very impressive,” he commented, as Nertha straighten her attire and Torunn took her seat by her Uncle again.
Or any couples you'd love to read more about? I am open to suggestions. I love this canon-divergent universe that I've created so far 🥰
“Where are my manners?” He caught himself. “Remy LeBeau.” He stated, handing her one of the cards. Amelia hesitated for only a second before she let the card pass from his fingers to hers. She wasn’t aware that the man before her was subtly influencing her actions with his powers. He watched her carefully gauging her reaction. He saw a small spark flash by within her green eyes and she was none the wiser, flipping the card over to examine it closer. It was a black heart. Nothing special about that.
Nathan was saddened at the memory. Today was the anniversary of that day; the one-year anniversary of the unfortunate day they lost their baby and Nathan remembered that he and Morgan wanted to get out of town for the day and have a small memorial to honour the child they could have had.
Steve backed away from Stephen, welcoming Maria with a hug. “You look lovely Maria” he paid her the compliment and she returned the favor.
His last words hit the nail on Sam’s coffin, and he hated himself for doing what he had. “Babe. I just wanted to be sure.” Sam supplied but that didn’t help his case. It made it worst.
“I was going to tell you and Peter once we figured it out…I…” Steve was struggling to find the right words. He wanted to sort everything out with Sharon before he told them. He wasn’t aware Tony knew. Sharon must have said something.
Maria had cooked and she was almost through setting the table when Friday announced that Steve was here. Morgan and Peter were already taking their seats at the table and Maria was placing the final dish on the table.
Maria continued. “Howard and I had tried for years.” Morgan could see she was reflecting on the memory. “We got so lucky with Tony. So so lucky.”
They got to the hospital quickly through one of Stephen’s portals. Harley, Morgan, Peter and Anna followed behind Steve as he held a bleeding Tony in his arms.
Peter kept hitting Wade’s chest until his words became murmurs and eventually, sobs. His heart was aching, and it hurt too much to cry anymore. He couldn’t break free. In the same way that Peter was unable to break free from caring for and loving Wade.
Steve walked in, through the clearly unlocked door and successfully interrupted their conversation. The couple pulled apart quickly, wishing one of them had at least bothered to ensure the door was actually locked, before divulging into their previous plans. Steve must have heard it all, but Anna only panicked for a minute and gracefully, composed herself as she watched her father manually locked her room door, without Friday’s assistance.
more than his husband, at the time in any case. Tony took a moment, to compose himself. This always made him emotional. No matter how much he swore he was over it. “It just wouldn’t do me any good to hold on to that hatred.”
Tony’s eyes widened and his lips allowed a little gasp to pass between them. “You wouldn’t mind me possibly keeping his baby?”
“Lately?” Sam asked, sarcastically. Steve turned his attention to him. “Steve, you knew what she was like before you started this thing. Buck and I told you.”
Carol became a little defensive. "I'm nothing like them. I didn't cheat." She reminded her. She and Valkyrie though they were very much attracted to each other hadn't acted on their emotions.
Steve sighed and held his arms open for Anna to slide into the embrace. “I tried.” He whispered. It was so unfortunate his two youngest had such horrendous taste in men. What he wouldn’t do to get rid of Wade Wilson and Remy LeBeau. He would be civil though, but he would never fully accept them.
He was not alone and the sight of him dancing with a tall, slender, black-haired man as gracefully as Thor was carting Tony around, made Tony’s heart clench painfully. Tony knew betrayal intimately - he’d felt its sharp claws dig into his soul far too many times over his short life-time - but it had never felt like being un-made. Like Steve had literally reached inside of him and ripped his heart out with his bare hands.
“Do you have any… stuff?” The way Steve blushed was adorable, Tony loved the fact that Steve could remain shy in a situation like this.
Bucky’s laugh was dark and cruel. “How are you gonna manage that, huh? You haven’t busted us out yet and I’m already short one arm. I kinda want to keep the other where it is.”
“That’s not what I meant.” Was it Tony’s imagination, or did Steve sound a little pissed? Well, good. Tony was pissed too now.
“B-but you screamed so loud!” Peter cried, the tears streaming down his cheeks obviously distressing Patrick, who flailed for something to say. Rhia sighed loudly and elbowed Patrick out of the way.
“Yeah.” Peter scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “I’m sorry mom. You were right.” Tony smiled at that. “I should have never been hanging out with Wade in the first place.” Because Wade had disappeared – per Tony’s threats – and broke his heart in the process. And Peter was getting teary-eyed and Tony gladly wrapped his baby boy in a hug. “I’m sorry.” He mumbled.
Stephen could think of a couple reasons, so he began listing them off in his drugged state. “We’ve been together for months,” Stephen whispered. “And you still haven’t told me you love me…”
“I just…” Peter could hear him searching for an excuse right then and there on the spot. Peter folded his arms
“Peter.” He recognized Wade’s voice. He’d hardly ever said his actual name. It was always some nickname. “I missed you so much.” He continued and Peter could feel himself sinking deeper into the hug, into the comforts of his presence. He missed Wade so much, his body was saying one thing and his mind another. He snapped back into his senses. Wade had left him. For four months! Peter hadn’t heard even a little peep from him. Wade was radio silent, MIA, unreachable, untraceable. So how dare he come back, hugging Peter like nothing happened? Like everything was okay. It wasn’t.
“Karen! Override!” Peter shrieked at the mention of Deadpool. It wasn’t going to help the situation if his mom found out what Wade did for a living. At least not right now because talk of Deadpool ultimately meant talk of Spiderman.
, only a second later. It sounded better in her opinion. It flowed better. And once again, as luck was on their side, the name was available.
“Your sister doesn’t want to go to college. Wonder where she got that idea.” Tony said, before exiting the room to finish setting up the dining table with his mother. He asked Peter to join him solely so Anna and Morgan could talk.
“Thanks.” He stated, pulling himself into an upright position so he could get a better look at what Steve had made him for breakfast. He thought he heard a little crackling sound from one of his limps - a sign his age was catching up with him. Steve would have told him, ‘he was being ridiculous’.
They break from court and Steve knows they’re losing by a land slide. Nova’s last resort is to have Steve take the stand and appeal to the court from a hurting mother’s point of view. Steve agrees without a doubt. He’ll try anything to win Nicky back. Steve leaves for the bathroom and sure enough Tony’s latest boy toy follows. The boy is short and small. Brown hair and even darker eyes.
“Please?” He begged this time. It made Wade smirk as he reached over to grab some lube from Peter’s bedside table. He didn’t want this to hurt any more than it would have to. He spread some over his erection and some on Peter’s waiting hole. He positioned himself and slid the head in slowly, meeting so much resistance, Wade had to bite his lip to stop himself from coming in that moment.
“Hey sweetie.” Tony noticed, her as she entered the room. He acknowledged her and beckoned her over to join him. He got up to hug her, something he couldn’t stop himself from doing every single day. It was his reminder that she really was back in his life. Anna rested her chin in the crook of his clothed shoulder, savouring her mother’s hug. She never thought she’d ever get to know her real parents.
“We had a deal.” He reminded her. She paused for a second before resuming the task at hand. “I helped you with your baby situation. Time for you to pay up.”
Nertha pleaded with her eyes to Jacob for him to wait just a while longer before she released him from the mind control. She enjoyed being dotted on. Jacob shook his head to express his disapproval. He wasn’t having it. Nertha rolled her eyes and interrupted Harley’s speech with the wave of her hand, ending his enchantment. He blinked a few times and then he looked from Nertha and Jacob to the containers in his hands, asking what was going on. Nertha gladly retrieved both containers from Harley’s hands and they levitated around her as she exited the room.
“Justin Hammer.” Rhodey provided. With the mention of the name, memories of Justin Hammer resurfaced in Tony’s mind. So that’s the
Loki had been tossing around in someone’s bed a few minutes ago when he remembered Tony’s annual Christmas Party. He flew into his clothes and conjured up a few gifts before pulling up a portal to the Stark Mansion. He ended up on the floor below the first time and then cast his spell again to get to the floor where the party actually was.
Professor Xavier wished them the best of luck and Anna was grateful for the home he’d given her when she was all alone. Now their family was complete, and the DNA test results that were presented in the next few days only further solidified everyone’s assumptions. Anna Marie, now officially Anna Stark Rogers, after some paperwork was in fact Steve and Tony’s long-lost child.
“You can’t just abandon her Steve. She’s pregnant. With your kid.” Bucky lectured. “You were sleeping with her. It was bound to happen sooner or later.”
Tony’s face was the first thing Stephen saw when he woke up. Tony was alerted of Stephen’s consciousness when he heard him groan. Stephen was rushed to the hospital the night before. It was scary for him. He cared for Stephen. He didn’t want to lose him; he’d grown pretty attached to Stephen after 9 months of being in each other’s lives.
Morgan’s birthday was April 26. Tony knew she wouldn’t be in any mood for a party, but it was her 18
“Hey.” Tony whispered. Stephen tried to sit up and groaned again, holding his stomach. “Don’t move. Your stomach was pumped a few hours ago.”
Tony and Steve managed to patch things back up following the loss of their daughter. They consoled each other as they grieved. Tony had never fully forgiven Steve for his infidelity, but they needed each other more than ever after their loss.
Stephen was finishing up with his toiletries while Tony discussed the new information. He didn’t mind hearing about the investigation because he worried for Tony’s safety, but he did not want to hear Steve’s name being mentioned in
They’d have to figure this out at some point but for right now, he begged her not to mention this to Tony. He didn’t stay to hear her response. He needed to leave. He’d cheated on his husband and couldn’t even remember it.
“I have to get to the funeral baby.” Tony released himself from his hold and straighten his clothes. “See you later.” He added, before walking out Stephen’s hospital room.
” Tony whispered, extending a hand. Did he trust him? They’d only known each other for a matter of minutes; but strangely enough, he did. Steve did trust him.
“Pete.” He spoke when he finally opened the door and let his son in. He guided him to the two seats by his fireplace, that weren’t facing the bed. “What’s up, honey?”
They talked for a while with Azari and Winter lingering close by and soon Michelle and Ned joined in on the conversation. Peter’s phone went off. It was Wade and he excused himself, disappearing into the party.
“Miss Caffrey. Unless you have any evidence that can prove these records invalid.” The judge addressed her and Caffrey stayed quiet. “Then you may continue Mr. Tate.”
“She’s still a kid.” Steve justified. What was he supposed to do if he saw his little girl hurting like that?
“For now, yeah.” Wade said boldly. Peter blushed. He had to accept. Wade never failed to let him know he wanted kids with him one day as did Peter. They finished up with the dishes when Wade spoke again. “I love you Peter.”
Peter stood as well; he and Morgan then looked over the document. Morgan had flipped the screen and zoomed in so they could see more clearly. That was definitely Natasha Romanov’s gun. It said as much, all detailed in a SHIELD report dated only two days ago. This discovery still didn’t actually place her at the scene of the crime, but all signs and evidence were pointing to her and Remy LeBeau.
Morgan and Peter gave her a similar look and Anna soon joined them in laughter. For the longest time it was just them, the three Stark-Rogers, then she came along and now a new sibling was on the way. And they weren’t greedy, money-hungry, self-entitled individuals. It was just what was always promised to them from birth - written in Tony’s will long before Harley was born.
Tony pulled off his cock with a pop and emerged from the covers, his eyebrows knitted together in worry. “Really?” And Steve couldn’t think anymore, couldn’t think to continue the conversation with Tony still drawing him closer to the edge.
Everyone kept telling her it was going to get better; that she was going to get pass this. And she was trying. She really was but she couldn’t stop the hurt from coming. It was always there. So how? She asked with her eyes. How did he know she was going to get pass this?
“See. I’m not exactly over her.” Michelle sighed, covering her face with both her hands. Peter reached out and patted her on the back, letting out a chuckle.
“It’s okay.” Tony provided, touching Steve’s arm to get his attention again. “We honestly were just as surprised as you guys are.” He could tell by looking around the room. “But you know, it just happened...”
Jacob didn’t miss a beat in his response. “Are you going to tell me you guys fell out of love?” He’d heard that cliché line before. He watched one too many rom-coms with Amelia. It was the same thing in every movie; just different characters.
Peter held his head in his hand. All this new information was giving him a headache. How could his parents hide these things from him? If he hadn’t asked would they had said anything? And how would he know what to ask anyways? It made him wonder, what else were they hiding?
Morgan scoffed. “Okay. Ew.” She seemed to genuinely want to throw up. “Talk of any of our brothers is off limits if its sexual.” Amelia couldn’t agree more while Torunn was grateful. She hated to be reminded that the person she’d given her virginity to was also the subject of so many past affairs, one of such being with a horny Lila Barton.
Carmelita Camacho was beautiful. She was about the same height as Peter, all dark hair, brown skin and dark eyes. She truly was a sight and her presence made Peter feel inferior, uncomfortable and maybe even a little jealous; jealous that she’d been with Wade. She’d seen parts of Wade he still hadn’t. She was with him first in every sense of the word and Peter was second best, felt like second-best.
He adjusted the cap he had on, pulling the rim lower to shield his eyes. “Sure, until he realizes who I am.”
Their eyes met and that one look made everything clear. She knew that he knew. They had a kid together.
She got interrupted by an irritated Steve, who shook her hand off in the process. “Will you just stop?!” He was loud enough to draw by-standers’ attention, and he quickly apologized. “Look, I’m sorry for being so awful to you especially right now after you’ve just lost your aunt. I haven’t been fair to you and I apologize. I will be there for our daughter, but I need you to understand Sharon that I can’t be with you.
“Hey.” Steve whispered, angling Tony’s face so he could see him. “You want me to get you another slice of cake?” Food always cheered Tony up. He nodded, pecking Steve’s lips. “I’ll be right back.”
“Peter.” He whispered, into his hair. Wade had limited his usage of nicknames for Peter since his return and became more touchy-feely than ever before. It was adorable. Peter pulled his head out of the crook of Wade’s neck so he could speak.
“More than made up.” Amelia confirmed, running her fingers throw her boyfriend’s head of brown curls. Jacob groaned.
“Never.” He only ever had eyes for her even when Harley tried to pressure him into his lifestyle. He wouldn’t put her through the heartbreak his mother went through and hadn’t recovered from. He kissed her to validate his point.
Bucky was sad. He didn’t have a short temper like some people. His anger always diminished into sadness. After finding the DNA test papers, Bucky had cried, wounded by the distrust his husband had in him. He went about his daily routine, but the revelation weighed heavy on his heart. It hurt. He had never loved anyone else. He had never been with anyone else, but Sam thought otherwise.
Peter rolled his eyes, swallowing his own arousal. He decided to change the subject. “I half-expected to see countless pictures of myself in here.”
Steve flipped out at that. “Why would you lie like that?!" What ever happened to doctor-patient confidentiality? He almost launched at Gonzalez who pulled back in shock. Nova hurried to calm him down because this outburst was not going to help their case.
Peter was dumbfounded, and Morgan almost broke her neck with how fast she spun around. Did she hear that right? She looked around at everyone. Everyone else must have heard it too. Carol, Pepper and Rhodey were the only people that didn’t seem fazed by it. They must have known.
He had to tell Steve before anyone or anything else. How he’d tell Steve though, he still didn’t know.
“General check-up would do.” Tony suggested. That was what he had already decided anyways. He wouldn't just not show up.
“Need you here.” Harley whispered, staring into her eyes on the screen. He was craving physical contact, for someone to hug him and be there with him. He didn’t want to think about the incident that took place on Christmas and certainly not what had followed.
So, they quickly undressed. Once fully naked, Wade worked a finger into the tightness of Peter’s virgin hole to get him stretched enough to take him. Peter knew it was going to hurt as he bit his lips to deal with the ache a single finger had caused him, but he’d deal with it. Soon Wade set Peter down on all fours and spread his cheeks so he could see his pink puckered hole. Peer was impossibly tight, and he made quick work of eating him out and scissoring him open even more.
Tony drags Steve by the hand and leads him towards the dock on the lake. Tony is holding his hand a bit too tight and Steve is wincing at the pain.
“I love you too.” Steve countered. He kissed him again. “Do you remember our wedding day?” The thought came to him as he was reminded that their first-born’s wedding day was less than a week away.
Morgan heard him though and glared at her brother. Harley was such a degenerate sometimes. He held his hands up in mock surrender and slowly backed away, so much so that he almost bumped into someone. Someone that looked eerily familiar and if the lights weren’t constantly flashing, he could probably make out her face by now. She happened to catch his gaze and immediately called out to him. “Harley. Hi.” Her voice gave her away.
“If anyone should be a key suspect.” Anna spoke, letting Tony go and turning to face the rest of her family. “It should be Natasha Romanov.” Anna explained. “Her gun was the murder weapon and she doesn’t have a legit alibi.” Harley wondered how she knew that as well. That wasn’t public information.
“How could you tell?” Harley worried, wondering if it was that obvious. Jacob gestured to his hands still adjusting his bow tie. Harley sighed, dropping his hands to his side and he heard Jacob chuckle before rising from his seat and joining him at the full-length mirror. He rested a hand on his shoulder.
“It was hard.” Anna took a breath to punctuate her statement. “Growing up without parents.” She explained. Tony’s eyebrows crinkled together in sympathy. “For the longest, I couldn’t understand why I’d be abandoned...” She trailed off. Her eyebrows were slightly furrowed, and her jaw clenched, like Steve. She favoured Steve more even though her and Peter were supposedly identical.
Of course, Harley figured it out. He just didn’t expect him to get back to him for another few days. His first born seemed very pleased with himself and the moment he smiled Tony’s heart melted. Steve couldn’t deny Harley even if he wanted to. He was his twin.
“Really?” Tony asked. He let out a hard laugh, turning his back to them. Hoping to calm himself down. “Are you going to tell me you two were drunk or something?”
Steve pulled out of Tony, who winched at the loss. Steve got an eyeful of Tony’s clenching hole dripping with cum. He groaned in arousal and frustration. Tony sat up, pulling a robe on while Steve dragged on his pants, trying to keep his erection down. They both went to the connected bathroom and tried to clean themselves up. Tony took longer of course so Steve reached Harley first.
“Friday. Call Nathan Banner. Tell him to meet us at the St. Grace hospital.” Tony ordered, watching Morgan cry in Torunn’s hands.
“Okay. I’m offended.” He really was. He thought he looked good today, considering the lack of sleep. Morgan couldn’t sleep which meant he couldn’t either.
“On it.” She stated. Stephen would get the help he needed to get to the ER before he completely bled out. The moment he was gone and everyone somehow managed to get back to the festivities of the party, Steve turned to face Tony and Anna.
After Steve got patched up again, the doctor informed him that everything was perfectly fine. He was good and Nicky was good. They could go home in three days’ time, as per regular hospital procedures. Sam and Bucky stayed by his side as much as they could. Pepper and Morgan came by and even members of the team did too. Everyone loved Nicky, with his baby blue eyes, and little patch of blonde hair and that new baby scent. He was a mini-Steve, Sam’s new name for Nicky.
“I don’t think it would matter though. Once a cheater, always a cheater, right?” Harley finished. That left them with food for thought. What if his dad and Aunt Nat still had a thing going on?
“Torunn has a boyfriend.” Amelia let out. Torunn looked mortified. Morgan looked surprised. Torunn’s never had a boyfriend. None that they knew of at least. Torunn was very confused.
“Happy Anniversary.” He added. Had it really been a year since they made it official? Morgan found herself crying again. He sat the box down on her bed and she joined him there.
“Ah.” Steve murmured. “There’s that separation anxiety.” He knew this was coming. Tony was so close with each of their children in one way or the other. He always made time for them and he always had a difficult time being away from them. Harley was going to be living on Asgard soon, even further away than MIT. Morgan had moved out and even though it was 20 minutes away, for Tony that was still too far. And finally, Peter and Anna were weeks away from being 18. There was no telling where they might go. He really didn’t have any babies anymore, age-wise.
“We’re having a meeting without Anna?” Peter pointed out once he entered his brother’s room and didn’t see his twin.
“Not so bad yourself.” Tony reciprocated, dragging him over to where the kids were hanging out. “Come. I want you to meet the kids.” Morgan, Harley and Peter were standing by one of the food tables eating and conversing with their friends and each other. They had made an effort to stay together upon Tony’s request so he could introduce them to Stephen and vice versa.
Tony sighed, almost feeling sorry for him. “Stephen. You need to go.” His voice had hardened, as he faced the man who was still causing issues in his and Steve’s relationship. He heard Stephen take a breath. Tony thought he was finally going to let it go until he was pulled in by the waist and kissed on the lips.
“I have morning breath.” He explained, covering his mouth. Steve howled with laughter, kissing him again and Tony melted away in it.
He did find Maria in the kitchen but was surprised to see Wade Wilson seated on one of the barstools. He instinctively did a double take, wondering if he was just seeing things after being surrounded by continuous magic for the past two months. But no, Wade was actually there, eating his grandmother’s cooking with not a single care in the world.
“You’re a smart woman Virginia Potts.” He snarked, giving her the once over. “That much is true.” She watched his eyes return to their original state and shift over to the left of her as their daughter entered the room.
Why was the universe screwing him over like this? He couldn’t answer that question even if he wanted to because Kayla came knocking at the door. He was inside for longer that he should be so he dried his hands and decided to join Kayla again.
“Your honor. If I may speak freely,” he began interrupting both lawyers. Judge Brooks allows it. Tate and Caffery pause and allow him to speak as well.
“What a bitch.” Carol began, whispering the last word as she remembered the kids before them. “I always sensed there was something off about her.”
“We used a condom,” Morgan began. Nathan was sitting on her bed, in her room. He came over as soon as Morgan texted him the news. He didn’t care that is was the middle of the night. She needed him. Morgan was shocked, she just showed him the test and he held her in silence until they fell asleep together. They would discuss it in the morning.
Peter spoke first. “Mom,” he said it slowly. “This is Wade...Wilson.” Tony got an eyeful of Wade’s face. He stared for a while before he addressed Friday.
“Yeah.” Steve answered, kissing Tony’s cheek. “We’re moving forward.” In every sense of the word and Steve could not tear his eyes away from the man he loved now and always, the mother of his children.
This went on for some time until Steve saw Peggy entering the room with who he soon learned was Tony Stark.
Sam respected his decisions. He grabbed a few of his stuff and left. Winter couldn’t understand why her father was leaving their home. Bucky promised to explain to her later. He stayed at a hotel that night, regretting doing the one thing that got him kicked out of his home, had put his family in a bad place and wounded his marriage with Bucky.
“Bullshit!” Stephen screamed, shooting up from his seat and frightening Tony in the process. “Why do you still love him?!” Tony did not appreciate all this shouting he was doing but if he wanted the truth, he’d give him the cold hard truth.
Stephen heard and was about to respond when Tony re-emerged from the kitchen, plate and glass in hand. Tony helped share Stephen’s plate and Tony was grateful when a voice was heard over the clinking of utensils against plates. It was his mother.
“Yes.” He said honestly. He couldn’t lie about that. His mind and his heart wouldn’t let him. Stephen seemed to visibly wince from the confirmation.
Tony was smothering him in a hug. It was the third one in an hour. Harley was whining about it. “Mom, please stop. I’m not a baby anymore.”
“How could I forget?” Tony answered. “I was only 6 weeks post-partum. I still had a pouch. My breast ached and I couldn’t stop crying. We had sex later that day and it hurt so bad. The absolute worst day of my life.”
Harley address the sister he was sure of. “Morgan, this couldn’t have waited until after?” He looked at Torunn looking distressed and concerned, her eyes had return to its normal state.
“I should hope not. I’ll find her and speak with her afterwards.” Thor concluded, motioning for everyone to continue with their meals.
“Because you’re still not over Uncle Thor.” Jacob dared say, all too quickly and he regretted instantly. That was a touchy subject. That was a low blow. That was right below the belt. That was uncalled for. He overstepped, on his own mother for that matter and he knew that wouldn’t sit well with Carol. She was always the stricter parent. She didn’t take any crap.
“I had a conversation with Remy.” She began after swallowing a fork-full of her own salad. “It made me realize he’s not as bad as I thought him to be.” Pepper provided. “He really isn’t such a bad guy.”
Then Friday was announcing that Stephen was in the elevator on the way up and Peter couldn’t be happier. He’d gladly trade out talk of his relationship with Wade for any drama that would likely ensue when Stephen and his dad were in the same room. But why was Stephen here, on tonight of all nights; on family dinner night? He wasn’t family. Steve had asked out loud and both Morgan and Peter shrugged when Tony had left to go meet Stephen.
Stephen huffed and disappeared into the en suite before he said something he would regret. But Tony was riled up and couldn’t fathom the reason he would be behaving this dramatically. “Why are you so mad about this?” he shouted. “I found out that my ex didn’t cheat on me by his own will – the sole reason for the destruction of our relationship,” his voice lowered as he walked towards the open bathroom door, grabbing a robe that was hanging nearby to cover himself. “I had the opportunity to be with him.”
“That’s not me, Peter.” Michelle replied. Peter knew that. That was more of Harley’s vein line of work. “I actually kind of like him,” and she was smiling. Which was good; she’d been hung up over Amelia for far too long now when Calvin was standing right there with arms wide open.
“That’s quite an exaggeration, brother.” Loki patted his back and pulled away from Thor who was smiling like a child who just got some candy. Sif appeared behind Thor and he let Loki know that Sif was with child.
Steve sighed and Bucky picked up where his husband left off. “I really think you should focus on the new baby right now.”
She liked to send Harley to get her things. Poor Harley can’t say no. This time she was sending him out to get her some ice cream. Harley hopped to it and Jacob was left with Nertha. She casted her striking green eyes upon Jacob’s hazel ones. She knew he had a burning issue. She was waiting for him to say something.
He wondered. “It is written all over your face, love.” She explained, holding that face between her hands and pressing their foreheads together.
Remy’s memories of her came to the forefront of his mind as Amelia refreshed them, reverberating things said before. “She was involved with Uncle Steve because of Hammer. She’s dating Uncle Bruce.”
“Cum babe. Cum.” Steve told him, before he took the cock all the way down his throat again. Tony released and Steve savoured the taste while he swallowed all of it. Once Tony had finished spending himself, Steve removed his fingers and put them in his mouth to taste his favourite part of Tony all while Tony watched him.
“How’s he doing?” Peggy directed her question to the woman in charge, ignoring Steve’s presence all together. It was all just an act however, so no one would suspect that she was having inappropriate relations with him.
“Careful or you’re going to burn a hole through Strange’s head,” Natasha remarked sneaking up on him, like the spy she was. Steve didn’t realize he was glaring.
Carol Danvers-Rhodes arrived on the 4th floor of the Avengers Compound’s main building; except it wasn’t called the Avengers Compound anymore. It was Tony’s and once upon a time, Steve’s family home. The entire compound was remodeled into a large home with a large lawn for Tony and the kids. The only thing that stayed the same from the good old Avengers days was all the suits of the now retired avengers sitting in showcases in the basement. Risking their lives every day to save the world wasn’t easy and after all was said and done, everyone decided to settle down with their families and for once, just lived for themselves. Avenging put their kids in danger every day.
“But who?” Pepper wondered aloud. “They’ve already gone through their exes and we know none of them could have done it. They were all accounted for on the night of.”
Stephen understood. “I can leave, we can reschedule. I wouldn’t want to impose on your family time.”
He opened the door without looking through the peephole because he was convinced it was Bucky. It wasn’t Bucky. Tony stood at his door, his back turned to him. He turned around, his arms folded over his chest when he heard the door open.
Tony threw up for the second time that morning. He flushed the toilet, washed his hands and brushed his teeth before he was left staring at his reflection in the mirrors of his en suite. He wondered why Steve hadn’t woken up yet and more importantly, why Steve hadn’t realized he was pregnant yet. He was way past the 7-week mark at which he’d normally figure it out. Tony wondered if it was because he was pregnant with Stephen’s child.
“Stay with me Tony.” He whispered so only Tony could hear. Steve could see his eyes, opening and closing from time to time. He had to assume Tony was going in and out of consciousness.
“What else could you have thought in that situation?” Steve inched closer to him. “You had every right to.” He’d cheated though it wasn’t by his own will, he’d still done it.
“Geez!” Steve shot up, walking in circles with one hand on his hip and the other brushing his hair back. “Did he force himself on you?” He stared at Peter who looked completely mortified. “Tones, did you call the cops?”
floor where the large Christmas tree was surrounded by gifts, in a separate room from when the party was kept last night. Tony’s hired cleaning crew was already busying cleaning. Everyone exchanged gifts. Loki gloated about having the best gifts for everyone. Peter agreed. Harley found Torunn and handed her a gift. “Here you go, Princess.”
“Yes. I promise.” She added. “I just wish I was there with Tony when he fought Hammer.” Natasha would have loved to be there to have her chance at teaching Hammer a lesson but him being in SHIELD’s prison for life would have to do. She knew Fury would ensure that life for him was always hell on earth.
Steve was a little concerned, but he tried to not have his fear of Tony ruin his joy. He was ecstatic these last few days. His due date was right around the corner. SJ was almost here and everything was ready for him, thanks to Sam and Bucky. With their help he had also figured out names for SJ. Steve was torn between Nicholas and Hayden.
“Dad.” Peter’s voice made them pull apart and stare at him. Tony was resting his head on Steve’s shoulder and Steve’s brows were furrowed. “I don’t need to see...” He gestured to his parents, “...whatever was happening here.”
Wade then, pulled out a bit and slammed back into him. Peter became a frenzy of moans and whimpers and a few sobs, but it was clear how much he was enjoying it all. So much that minutes later, he used his super strength to flip themselves over, putting Peter on top, still impaled by Wade’s member. He started grinding, trying to find a rhythm that worked for them both and once they’d found it, Wade moved his hips to move in sync with Peter.
It took some time, as expected, for him to wrap his head around everything. He inevitably resented Natasha Romanov and for a time, his parents Tanya and Misha.
Tony directed his next words to him. Steve was looking way to happy with himself. “Steve,” he started, “I don't know if you haven't caught on yet or you're just choosing to omit this, but Stephen is my boyfriend.” Steve’s smiled faded and Tony carried on. “So, I’m also going to need you to respect him as well because he's a part of my life now whether you like it or not.”
Steve engaged in a soft lullaby for the baby in his arms. He kissed the baby’s forehead, pushing its little strands of blonde hair out of the way.
Harley moved the screen around, so it was displaying Peter’s suit. “I’m trying not to think about my dad’s situation.” Jacob caught on. Amelia had told him about Steve and Nat. “I don’t even know why it bothers me so much.”
“Huh?” Peter asked. Wade kissed his cheek and Peter turned to him as his face redden and a smile appeared on his lips. Peter was then able to process the words that had been said seconds ago. “I miss…” but Peter trailed off, his eyes saddened, and Wade knew to offer some comfort by maneuvering around the laptop and smothering him in a hug
Morgan went on to explain. “Two people infiltrated SHIELD that night.” She reminded her brothers. “I think one of them was Remy LeBeau.”
Steve was grabbing his keys from where he left them on the kitchen counter when his favourite child entered the room, a gift in her hand.
“I hacked SHIELD. That information hasn’t been publicly disclosed yet.” He peered up at them. “And it just came in on my phone.” Harley explained as he held his phone up and a projection with a recent report popped up from SHIELD.
Harley stopped his eating from the small plate he still had in his hand. Morgan raised an eyebrow and Peter looked from his mother to Stephen in the span of two seconds. Well that was unnecessary, Morgan wanted to say and she looked at her siblings. She knew they were thinking the same thing. Tony was rolling his eyes and Stephen eventually let out a smile and a little laugh seeing the look on their faces. Everyone managed to crack a smile in the end however and soon all three Stark-Rogers kids had disappeared into the party in search of their friends.
Sam had grabbed one too many plates and Tony had caught wind of it. “Sam that’s for the mothers.” He lectured.
He lay Tony flat on his back and made love to him, moans passing his lips with each thrust Stephen made. When Stephen had finished inside him, they lay side by side trying to catch their breaths. Tony’s phone went off again and he reached over to the nightstand once more to retrieve his phone. Stephen didn’t stop him this time.
They both leaned closer, Peter raising his hand to remove the mask and Wade stopped him as soon as he started pulling at it. It snapped Peter out of whatever trance he was in with the realization of what he was seconds away from doing dawning on him. He was going to let Wade kiss him.
“If you see any change in her,” He began. “It’s by her own accord.” Though he did try to manipulate Amelia, her own free will was stronger. Remy had told himself he should have known that. This was his daughter after all, and she had his powers and more. She was stronger than him; he knew but he’d never admit it.
He flipped them over, staying buried inside her as they shared another heated kiss. He finally pulled out of her when he felt his eye lids getting heavier, but he kept his hands in her hair as they slumbered.
“First of all, no one showed up to the airport to get me.” Jacob started. Harley listened to his friend complain about his first day back home. They’d flew down for summer holidays, but Harley got home a week before Jacob did. He was projected from his phone on a holographic screen before him. Harley was down in his mother’s lab tinkering with Peter’s Iron Spider suit. Shuri had made plenty of improvements on it but Harley wanted to add a couple of things. Harley was the only one that was surprised indefinitely by the revelation – his little brother was Spiderman. Morgan had a hunch for a while.
“Not even in your dreams.” Harley jeered, appearing behind them. Morgan joined as well before they went their separate ways. Steve said his goodbyes and Tony shot him a sympathetic look before leaving him with the likes of Sharon Carter. He made his bed; he’d have to lie in it.
“I’m happy he’s happy.” She was still going. Sif looked indifferent. She wasn’t sure if she should believe Carol Denvers could ever be happy for Thor since he married her.
Nathan ended up voicing his and Morgan’s concerns and suspicions to his father. Bruce didn’t take too well to the idea that Natasha could have been working with Hammer to hurt Steve and Tony and/or any of their children. He didn’t want to believe that; instead, he allowed her the benefit of the doubt. He’d question her specifically and directly about the situation prior to forming conclusive thoughts.
Remy then removed the glove and caressed her check, anticipating the pain but was pleased to say it never came. Anna stared at her, asking with her eyes. “Nothing.” He responded, finally kissing her full on the mouth. “Missed you, ‘chere.”
“Really.” Tony provided, grinning at his younger son. Then he and Steve looked around the room gauging the other three’s reactions.
“Hi Uncle Steve,” came Lila’s voice. She sounded ashamed. “I’ll just get dressed and leave.” She bolted to the bathroom without a response and was out within two minutes, dressed and out the door in a second.
Amelia butt in. “Please don’t answer that if you’ve been with Calvin. I don’t want to picture that.”
Steve remained quiet a minute longer. “Yeah. I do.” He took a strawberry from the tray and Tony shot him a look, a bit agitated by Steve’s audacity to steal the food he had made
Tony and Steve stared at each other. No. They weren’t present during the drawing on the blood sample nor could they possibly be at the lab when the sample was examined.
Family is so important Tony. We always need people's support and the great thing about it is that we can choose who we call family.
But Remy didn’t forget. He knew his girl well. He knew what she was capable of. She was extremely powerful. “You don’t have to. Not with me here.” He stated, pressing their lips together briefly.
“A trick? A spell?” she mocked. “What do you think we are?” It was a rhetorical question. Jacob didn't plan on answering anyways. “We’re not witches or wizards. We’re Gods.” She whispered as a green glow emitted from her body outlining her figure.
“I don’t need your judgement, Virginia Potts.” Carol taunted. Pepper laughed. She hadn’t heard anyone utter her legal name in years. “It works. Let’s not question it.”
And everyone grew quiet. Steve had said that so nonchalantly as if it wasn’t the biggest bombshell ever dropped within their family. Strange stopped nursing his nose and stared in astonishment at Steve. Sam’s face was pure shock. He looked to Bucky. Did he know? He was equally surprised. Clint and Laura were staring at Steve in disbelief. Amelia and Torunn were frozen in place.
“As if I need a man or woman to make me happy. Not everyone is lucky enough to find a Tony Stark.” Nat quipped.
“Absolutely not.” Natasha could say with confidence that she didn’t kill Hammer. “I wanted him to rot in prison.” She pulled out her chair and got up, walking towards the kitchen with her almost empty plate and Bruce couldn’t understand why an innocent person would be reacting like that.
“What’s going on?” Anna directed her question to her twin. She had been forming a closer bond with her older sister as opposed to her twin. Peter thought that to be unfair and made sure to spend as much time with Anna as possible.
“Steve.” Bucky started, kneeling before Steve and holding on of his hands. “I know you don’t want to talk about this.” Steve made a face. He knew what was coming. He’d mentioned it before. “But, you’ve got to press charges.”
But Steve wouldn't let him think on that for long as he took Tony’s glass from him and set it down on the coffee table along with his. Then he was scooting closer to Tony and pressing a kiss to his waiting lips, tasting the remaining droplets of his drink. Tony tried to deepen the kiss - it was the usual reaction - but Steve pulled away and found his bare neck next, suckling on the soft skin.
“Yeah.” Carol agreed. “We should all go.” And that gave everyone the push to move off and head out. Even Tony, Stephen, Morgan and Peter headed inside. Morgan and Peter were sharing a knowing look. They’d have to tell Harley.
“Am I?” Tony responded, not able to control the grin that was spreading across his face. Besides the pregnancy issue, being with Steve again did make him so happy. And was he glowing? Maybe it was the pregnancy, maybe it was just being in a healthy relationship with Steve. Maybe it was both. “I am, aren’t I?” He hummed, munching away at his salad. Pepper smiled at him. “How are things with you?” Tony wondered. He was such a bad friend for not checking in on her recently.
Harley thought. He decided though to just let Torunn be, offering to get her a drink from the bar, so he didn’t have be near Jaime any longer. Torunn accepted, telling him what she wanted, and Harley left for the bar.
one in those two weeks but he really didn’t need everyone and their mama or his mom to know yet if things didn’t work out.
It was days after New Year’s Eve. 2017 was finally here. Everyone went to their separate homes and school had been reopened. Peter and Morgan were currently in school and Harley and Jacob went back up to MIT; Harley left with a bandage wrapped around the wound on his arm from Clint’s arrow. Clint had found out about him and Lila. He had tried to put an arrow through him. And like Steve had said, no one tried to stop him except for Tony. He couldn’t stand the sight of his precious first born being hurt. Harley was glad Clint managed to only graze him. Steve informed Harley that if Clint wanted to actually hurt him he would have because he never misses.
“The boy is out.” The doctor shouted, placing the baby on Tony’s chest. Peter. Steve cut the umbilical cord while Peter screamed and flayed around looking for warmth and comfort. Tony kept him wrapped in the blanket, moving some of the gunk out of his face and brown hair. His little eyes weren’t open yet. Not long after the doctors took Peter and weighed, measured and cleaned him off among other things before placing him in a transparent hospital bassinet. Steve only left Tony’s side momentarily to be with Peter, talking to him.
Steve gave him the once over, his eyebrows furrowed and his jaw clenched. He just couldn’t stand him. “What game are you playing here?”
“I wish I could stay in you forever.” He caught his breath. His cock still nested in his hole, beads of cum slipping out.
“I’m not. I just.” Carl paused. Jacob awaited her response. “It’s hard to explain. But I love your dad. We love each other and we’re working it out, so I’ve been at your Aunt Pepper’s for a while but we’re okay.” She said the last part with so much sincerity, Jacob wondered who she was really trying to convince; him or herself?
He held his hand out for a handshake and Stephen took it without hesitation. “I’m Johnathan Doeran.”
Tony was joined by Steve on one of their home’s back balconies. The air was warm but bearable and Tony was enjoying it. Steve held him at the waist from behind, rubbing circles on Tony’s bump. He then reached around to press kisses to his cheeks as Tony complained about something. Typical for the start of the 2nd trimester.
“I kill for sport. Dare I say, I get high off the feeling and I know she would enjoy it too but she's just too pure. That must be your good parenting kicking in.”
“Tony and Steve’s kids seem to have that effect on everyone.” Clint gestured to Lila in the yard who was now walking and talking with Nathan.
“I don’t know.” Stephen responded, his hands in his lap as he sat by Tony’s bed, watching the rise and fall of his chest. It was hard seeing him like this. Only Tony’s evident breathing could settle his mind; a reminder that Tony was still alive.
“Uncle Thor isn’t going to like this.” Harley murmured. He was right about that. A knock on their door paused their conversation. Loki joined them moments later.
“Nicky is happy with me and Tony. We’re a family.” The kid explains and Steve can’t stop himself from smacking him across the face. The kid uses a hand to cover the area and he’s left in shock.
So, Steve knew Anna was working with Hammer at some point in time. Hammer had kept tabs on her as she grew up, considering he was the one who kidnapped her mere minutes after her birth and placed her in foster care. By the time, she was 16, he’d roped her into his plans. He had convinced her to go after her parents; he convinced her that Steve and Tony had abandoned her, and they deserved to pay for that. While Remy, who loved her so intensely would do anything for her and saw it as a way for them to gain a couple billions while they were at it.
Steve fell and the crow roared. Air was hard to get as he lay on his back, panting and with blood running into his eyes. His opponent leaned over him; wooden hammer raised over his head to deliver the victory blow. Steve gritted his teeth through the pain blooming in his side, where Thor had managed to get a hit in. His ribs screamed and with a roar of anger, Steve rolled out of the way when the hammer fell. It hit the sand hard, showering his back with tiny pebbles.
Tony swore, long and dirty. “That’s fucking it. I don’t want him hanging around with those two little assholes anymore. I don’t care what he says, they’re not good for him.”
“What are we doing here?” Tony muttered when a couple of nobles – alpha and beta and filthy rich from the looks of it – walked past them, glaring holes into their skulls. Bruce shrank in on himself and it seemed like his merger with the tapestry was about to be a success.
Steve heard the commotion even before they rounded the corner, where he and Clint came down the corridor towards the kids classroom.
“It means…” Steve reached to stroke his lower lip with a calloused thumb. “When you know, deep and true in your heart, that I’ll never willfully hurt you, you’ll give yourself to me wholly and trust that I’ll take care of you.”
“Your Majesty, I present to you my desert flower, brought here from the scorching sands and sun baked hills of the south: Hani.”
“Aye,” Thor said and took Tony’s hand, laying the softest of kisses on the back of it. His long beard and moustache tickled. “I would be honored if you’d join me in a dance, Omega Stark.”
He just needs a second to gather his composure. If he can bury his bruised, bleeding heart under pragmatism and facts, maybe it can’t hurt him anymore. Tony has always waited for the other shoe to drop. For over twenty years, he’s prepared himself for this possibility, and now when it’s here, it’s so much harder to be reasonable than he thought.
Tony said that she got it from Steve. They’d agreed to disagree in the topic for the sake of household peace. Peter had it too, but unlike the other two, he was more diplomatic and always stayed out of their arguments. He would make his points when everyone had calmed down and could listen properly.
Ignoring the chanting crowd and all of his smarting injuries – small though they may be, they stung like hell – Steve climbed to his feet and raised his shield. It was made out of sturdy wood and had saved his skin more than once in previous tournaments. Thor was by far the biggest competitor he’d ever faced off against, but it didn’t stop Steve from challenging him time and again.
Steve makes an amused sound. “I’ve known you for far too long to believe that, my love. You,” he reaches out to hold Tony’s chin between calloused fingers, “always have something on your amazing mind. That’s one of the things I love most about you.”
“I’m kind of a slob,” Tony began slowly, still crying and smiling at the same time and not giving a fuck. His heart soared, filled up with hope, love and a healthy dose of fear for the future. “I can’t cook, I can barely boil water without burning it.”
Somehow, despite his upbringing where everything was a commodity to be bartered and sold to the highest bidder, Tony had always refused when his father – fucking Howard – had tried to sell him to some horny alpha panting after him. Despite knowing love was something that happened to others – never to him – Tony had chosen to guard his virginity with tooth and claws, holding out for some intangible notion that it was too precious to just sell and discard like yesterday’s trash.
Steve was deep in depression, his children assumed. He’d stopped shaving or getting his hair cut. He never left the house and he indulged in as much junk food as possible. The one productive thing Steven Grant Rogers had brought himself to do these days was working on his art, but his pieces were always melancholic. He was unhappy.
birthday party to be better than hers. Last year she was a mess, dealing with the aftermath of a miscarriage, dealing with losing a baby, she and Nathan had fallen in love within the short time they had known about him/her. She wondered what that baby would be like, had they survived. It would have made them very young parents, but they knew they were going to be supported. She sighed.
“Maybe there is an affair going on.” Morgan put forward, covering her mouth with one of her palms as she thought about the situation. “Maybe they have some history.” Some history her and her brothers didn’t know about, but “Anna might know about it.”
Then Nathan entered the room looking freshly showered and a plate of food in his hand. Maria kissed Morgan’s forehead and left the two alone. Nathan approached her and sat on her bed. She turned to him and Nathan went about handing her the plate.
“I don’t know Sam.” Bucky said, irritation laced in his voice. “For as long as my heart stops hurting for not being trusted.”
month. It was getting harder to do everything by himself. Bucky noticed that and started to spend more time at Steve’s house so he could help out. He intends to move in with Steve once he gets closer to his due date. And Sam, who has grown attached to Bucky wants to tag along like a lost puppy. Steve was against the idea when Bucky first brought it up because he didn’t want his friends, to uproot their lives just to move into his tiny apartment with him. Bucky said it would only be for a few months. Just long enough for him to figure out this parenting thing and Steve couldn’t complain.
So Steve helped Tony back into his clothes, and he kissed him, letting Tony taste himself. “I missed you.” He whispered against his lips and Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. He was picked up bridal style and Steve walked them to the elevator. “I missed being inside you.” Steve said by his ear as they stepped into the elevator. Tony’s cock twitched and his hole clenched at his words. He missed having Steve inside him as well.
Anna thanked Torunn for her kind words. She tucked a bit of her white streak of hair out of the way. Morgan then cleared her throat, leaning forward and breaking Harley’s gaze on Torunn.
Being a husband was easy. Nothing changed but titles. Harley loved Torunn unconditionally so taking on the husband role was easy. Being a Prince – a Prince, husband of the future Queen of Asgard – was hard. He had to attend Council meetings and provide input on how to rule. He had to rule. What did a mortal like him know about ruling? It was a bit irritating at times and he reached out to his best friend for some sort of advice, but Jacob Rhodes could only say so much. How does one rule a nation, a kingdom, people? He also tried his best to hide this from Torunn. He wasn’t happy here, but this was his wife’s home. This was her kingdom, so he told himself to
Natasha had of course, taken offense. She was just as clueless as he was. When Steve and Tony had briefed her about Hammer, Nat went to Bruce first, confiding in him. She was relieved but so broken, only the thought that Hammer would be locked up for life eased her mind. He couldn’t hurt anyone ever again. And then she’d heard the good news from Steve that Paige had been found and joined her family. She was happy for them and damn anyone that tried to destroy a perfectly good and stable family.
Morgan cracked a smile. “Thanks.” She wiped away the stray tears. “You nailed the big brother talk.”
“This is news to me.” Amelia said, turning to Michelle. Then Amelia was kissing her on the lips, slipping her tongue in. The other girls stared in confusion for a minute. “So does that do something for you?” Amelia questioned when she pulled away.
“Okay then that would make Aunt Nat guilty as well.” Peter reminded her. Morgan had brought her up with no proof or cause for murder.
“Dad’s an artist,” Morgan informed him. Stephen glanced across at her. Steve was proud of how much pride was in her respond. She really was her father’s daughter.
“No. We’re together.” Steve showed him the rings on his ring finger as he met his eyes for the first time. Tony looked upset.
He didn’t want to be there. Mother insisted and once the kids had caught wind of the situation they wanted to attend as well. The service was longer than expected. Peggy’s work at SHIELD and Stark Industries was highlighted. She had lived a full life. Her children said their piece, Maria said a few words about her longest friend and Sharon managed to sneak in a couple words about her pregnancy with Steve somewhere in her speech.
Tony hugged him. “I’m sorry.” He mumbled his apology in the crook of his neck as he stood on his tippy toes. Steve pulled back to stop himself from tearing up. He was really hurt, and he wondered what he had done to deserve this.
“Are you two actually fucking?” He shook his head. “Well why are you two still sneaking around?” She didn’t understand why, when everyone had moved pass the entire Hammer situation and her parents had sorted out everything for them.
“What are your powers?” Harley wondered aloud. He hadn’t spoken with her much yet, but he wasn’t opposed to knowing his new sister in person as best he could before he’d have to head back up to MIT in a few days.
And so is Tony. Steve can vaguely make out the figure of Bucky, dragging Tony off of him and getting a few punches in before Tony flees the scene. Then Bucky is calling out to him, telling him to stay with him but Steve doesn’t think he can. It would be easier to just let go.
“Tony.” Steve was teasing, stopping his nibbling and placing chaste kisses on the area. “What do you want, Tony?”
Steve sighed, scrolling up to look at all the messages he had sent to Tony in the past few weeks since the incident at the lake that were never answered.
“I promise you they do Tones. They’re just not kids anymore.” He whispered by his ear, but that only made Tony sadder.
“There were three voices Harley.” He clarified and Harley finally met his hazel eyes, a smirk forming on his lips. “You’ll never guess who the third voice belonged to.”
“We’re not dating, Morgan” he explained sadly, “So please stop going all ‘mom’ on me. I’ll tell you when I’m ready. Can you respect my privacy until then?”
“I didn’t know that was today.” Stephen remarked. Tony thought he should have known. It was all he could talk about for the two days which prevented Stephen from asking about Steve, but his boyfriend wasn’t an idiot. He knew Tony was purposely avoiding any discussions on that topic. “I’ll get dressed quickly.” He finished.
“Only for you.” Steve promised. He settled between his thighs, shoving two fingers into Tony’s mouth for him to get wet before he put them in his hole, curling them as he did. Tony moaned, his eyes rolling back in his head. He reached a hand out to grab Steve and stroke his length. Steve whimpered at the contact. If Tony kept this up, he was going to cum too soon. In a matter of seconds, Steve replaced his fingers with his cock and sunk painfully slow and deep into the warm, wet clenching hole. Tony’s eyes opened to meet his. It was so intoxicating and sweet and tight, that every time he got a taste, every time he was inside him, he wanted nothing more than to let it all go. But Tony gripped his cock and Steve couldn’t move. He wasn’t certain if he was doing it unknowingly or intentionally.
Hela backed away from the window, standing before them. She was dressed in green and black as per usual, a cape dragging behind her on the floor. She pushed her hair back, unfazed by it all. “Now brother. You should have realized. That woman had no good intentions. You can just smell the malicious intent on her.”
“You’re beautiful, Tony.” Steve commented, pulling him into a hug. Tony was taken off guard. But his sobs ceased and he reciprocated the hug.
“You didn’t answer my question.” He pointed out, sitting on the ledge. Then Peter remembered Ned. “Ned? Sorry. I’ll text you later.”
Amelia nodded. Torunn snickered at their responses. “Have you two forgotten I have to find a suitable husband? I’m practically taken as well.”
“I think you're even more beautiful up close,” he repeated the words Wade had said to him that one-night weeks ago that they almost kissed. Peter could see his lips curl into a smile for the first time and he pressed his lips to Wade's cheek briefly.
And now Peter was being painted into a corner. Steve was going to absolutely flip out. “Well…” he began. Steve looked at him expectantly, as did Morgan and Maria. Tony on the other hand, was clearly amused.
Bucky and Sam are helping Steve out of the car and into their apartment after getting back from the hospital. According to the doctor that had treated Steve, Steve’s neck muscles were severely bruised. His vocal cords had been grazed from strangling. He was being put on vocal rest until the chords and muscles had healed on their own. The doctor estimated a week of healing. A week of not talking; a week of liquid meals because he wouldn’t be able to physically consume any hard food and a week of full body rest. The incident had put a toll on his body and the baby. SJ narrowly survived. His heartbeat was weak when they arrived at the hospital that night but SJ was already a little fighter. He fought for his little life and his heartrate was back on track in no time, beating stronger than ever. He was perfectly healthy.
“Fuck.” He grunted and swallowed each delicious whimper that would pass Tony's lips. Had Tony been any tighter, Steve was sure he'd cum undone, right then and there.
“What babies?” Tony wondered, his eyes darting back and forth at his 3 children as Friday’s voice in his ear announced Steve’s arrival.
“Aren’t you minutes away from getting married – to the Goddess of Thunder. Married into a family of Gods for that matter?” Jacob reminded him as Harley grinned at his reflection and occasionally smoothed out his hair.
“You’re not still telling people we dated, right?” Tony carried on. Tony had given Hammer a chance after his non-stop harassment and it took less than half a date for Tony to realize he didn’t want anything to do with him, romantically or otherwise. A couple months later and he had met Steve and Justin couldn’t stand seeing them together. He tried to win him over. That didn’t work and so he aimed to destroy Stark Industries instead. They’d fought only once before this and Tony spared his life allowing him to be held in prison. He’d served his time. He’d been released recently, and Justin was claiming to be a better, changed man. Clearly those words held no weight. Tony wouldn’t hesitate to kill him this time around if it came to that.
“Oh. That’s Aunt Nat.” Amelia provided, and he awaited her full name. “Natasha Romanov. I told you about her.”
“Get your hands off my son.” Steve and Tony shouted at the same time. They glanced at each other and Peter grinned smugly at her.
By the end of the ceremony, after no objections – not from Nertha or Lila or any Asgardian, the couple exchanged rings and finally sealed the marriage with a kiss. The minister then presented them to the audience as he had Harley kneel to have his head adorned with his new crown. Moments later, Harley rose again, and he looked out at their audience.
“Yeah. Why not?” He wanted the two most important people in his life to meet and he could already tell they’d get along well.
Tony pulled away from her and looked to Steve who hadn’t taken his eyes off him since he walked in. “Tony. Just call me Tony.” He held out his hand to shake Steve’s. “Nice to meet you, Captain.”
“I’ll go get the blindfold,” and he got up and ran up the stairs before Tony could form words. Every time this happened he realized how much this spoiled the mood. No it didn’t take much to get back in the mood with Steve’s thick big cock on display but he just wish it wasn’t lost in the first place. And Tony got to thinking about what Steve had said, those nights ago. 'When are we going to do it without the blindfold?' When? He couldn’t hide this forever. He deserved to know. And when was a good time like the present. He shouldn’t put it off any longer. And if Steve wanted to leave him, he’d just have to deal with that and say, 'hey. It was good while it lasted'.
Tony tensed but responded coolly given he wasn’t facing him. “Again Stephen. None of your business.” He then paid for his stuff quickly and headed to the exit.
“Together?” Anna gave her a look of genuine confusion. Remy told her nothing was going on there. Strictly business, he had said so vaguely so she really had no clue what was going on there.
Peter hesitated for a second. “I am. What about you? I’ve never seen you around here before.” Deadpool stopped circling him and stood behind him. He was closer than he was before and Peter didn’t think that was possible. This guy really didn’t know personal space and Peter couldn’t bring himself to take a step or two back.
“Yet you two were spending a shit ton of time together afterwards. I couldn’t even go through my heartbreak in peace without seeing you two together.” Tony’s eyes got glossy and tears threaten to fall. It was one of his most painful memories, besides being kidnapped in Afghanistan all those years ago. He was pregnant with Peter the day he found out about Steve’s infidelity and he struggled with his pregnancy from that point onwards. As a result, he had a difficult labour, to the point where his heart had stopped for a while.
The four of them were walking away when Nicky looked over his mother’s shoulder and shouted, “Bye Tony.” Yeah. Nicky didn’t need him in his life. He had 3 loving, capable parents already.
The conversation ended there, due to Amelia’s presence. She left with Remy, leaving Pepper to appreciate his kind comment about her good parenting and if he had any ill intentions towards her or Amelia, she couldn’t see it.
“Maybe to go then?” Justin suggested, picking up both glasses and handing one to Stephen. Stephen thought for a second before he took the glass and clinked it with Justin’s.
Bruce hushed her. He knew how much she hated herself for breaking up Steve and Tony. Steve had even blamed her at one point. He was adamant Natasha must have done something to him because he couldn’t remember anything about that crucial night.
“But you still love him.” Stephen stated, walking pass him and back into the bedroom. Tony bit his bottom lip nervously, thankful that they weren’t facing each other.
“I don't.” Carol had to stop lying to herself. “Valkyrie and I are just getting to know each other.”
He could feel his own cock suffering between their bodies and his hole being abused with each thrust. He hadn’t even realized he was coming until, Steve released one of his hands and reached down to touch him, he stopped kissed Tony and put his hand at his mouth to taste Tony’s juices.
Tony knew he didn’t mean that, and he was saddened because he did care for Stephen and now things were over.
Peter and Harley watched them together. "I promise, I'm no golddigger." Steve said in the direction he hoped they were still in. "I'm not leaving your father anytime soon."
, as Steve put it. Which Peter found hypocritical considering they married after a year of dating while it had been over 2 years for him and Wade. Regardless, they went through with it, Steve and Tony tried to be supportive and they gifted them one of the guest houses on the property if they wanted their privacy.
“But it makes me really excited to find out what next year has in store for all of us.” Tony paused, ready to close but, “Before I forget,” He glanced at his first born and Harley eyed him suspiciously. “Harley is getting married next summer.” Applauds rang throughout the room and Tony wished everyone a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year as the clock stroke closer to midnight.
“I almost didn’t recognize you. You look – you look great,” he commented. He hadn’t been able to be alone with Nertha all night with Hela lurking close by but all grown up Lila would do.
“She’s distant. There’s something dark about her.” She stated. “And I was so surprised when I found out she and Jacob broke up.” Amelia had left Jacob devasted when she broke things off with him after being together for almost two and a half years. It was sudden and completely out of nowhere according to Jacob. He could have sworn she was happy with him because he was with her. They were planning a future together and she just showed up one day, claiming they weren’t right for each other and that she never loved him.
All the attention on his hole, left Peter’s erection twitching beneath him and he used a hand to get himself off. It wasn’t helping and he eventually moaned out, “Please Wade, just…” He was trying to find the right word. “…fuck me. Please.”
Steve glanced at Nat upon hearing that and at Tony. He was staring back at him. Was he thinking the same thing? Did his act of infidelity happen for a reason? No. It was just a stupid mistake.
Everyone left except Pepper, Carol and Rhodey. They sighed because just like that the wound had been reopened and they'd have to pick up the pieces like they did 17 years ago.
Sharon struggled to get her front door open. She had a bunch of grocery bags in each hand and her keychain somewhere in between. She was returning home from the supermarket and the doctor's office for her check-up. Steve had come along. He’d been in attendance for every appointment thus far. She wanted him with her all the time, but this would have to do for now. He was very involved when it came to the baby considering his obvious hatred of the situation. Steve hadn’t hesitated to let her know, that he didn’t want a baby with her. He avoided her for the first couple of weeks and then some more after the incident with Morgan but since then, he was there for the baby. Sharon’s doctor appointments were the only times she saw Steve. He was going to be there for the baby, but never for her.
“And if I talk to a guy, you guys want to kill him.” Peter almost shouted. “I know he’s older. I know it looks illegal, but I’ve never done anything with him. Wade’s a good guy.” Tony and Steve wished they could believe that. “And if you guys just gave him a chance and got to know him and trusted me...” Peter trailed off. The room was flooded in silence again.
?” Wade’s latest nickname for him. Wade was whining. He wanted them to save themselves for each other.
“I’m surprised.” That was Tony’s kindest way of saying he was very much disappointed. He still didn’t look at her and Morgan could feel the tears falling down her face. She was crying. She doesn’t cry. It must be the hormones, right? She wasn’t crying because she knew she disappointed her parents, brought shame to them, ruined her future. She was supposed to take over S.I. Her name would be slandered. People would find out. It would look so bad on her parents. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers’ teenage daughter was a complete fuck-up. Not even Harley had ever messed up this badly and he was sleeping with any and everybody.
Steve drew his tongue out of Tony’s mouth, pressed his nose against his and stared into his brown orbs as he came, shooting wave after wave of cum inside him with each sloppy thrust. Tony gasped and Steve captured his bottom lip between his teeth. Neither of them moved. Steve tried his best to keep his weight off the twins. He stayed buried inside him as his cock soften and Tony pulsed around him. He didn’t stay soft for long which made Steve give him a look. A look that said he wanted to go again. Tony gave him another look in response.
And Steve grabbed his face, kissing him intensely prior to picking him up bridal style. “So are we having sex down here or do you want to do it upstairs?”
“Honey.” Tony whispered, scooting over to Peter’s end of the sofa and reaching out for him. Peter flinched. Steve’s worried expression soften a bit as he took his seat by Morgan again.
“Just stopped by to make your mother breakfast – in bed.” Steve half-lied. Morgan wasn’t buying into it though.
Harley thought for a minute. He’d heard part of Jacob’s conversation before he walked it. His parents had announced they were getting a divorce to him and his siblings almost 4 years ago. He was 16 at the time. Morgan was 14 and Peter was 13. It was safe to say Peter took it the hardest.
“Very.” Hela added. Nertha was happy to hear that and Hela did love a good family fight. It was harmless fun. Thor would beg to differ. We can’t fight amongst ourselves, he’d say. Torunn smirked at her cousin and Nertha scoffed.
“I pity you. I truly do. And I hope you come to your senses before you end up in a lake too but with a weight holding you down. Tony Stark has never loved anyone but himself. You’ll never be a family. Not with him and sure as hell not with my son!”
“I want this.” She informed him, standing between his legs. He pulled himself up and she initiated another kiss. His hands stayed on her naked waist while her hands lingered in his hair.
Justin knew it was his cue to moderate the conversation between him and Stephen. Gary had done the first part of his job. “You got kids?”
“I mean…” Michelle trailed off. Amelia was surprised to hear her even talk again. She scanned the room noting all her friends’ reactions. Even Torunn couldn’t deny what Lila had said. Morgan was the only one that looked away when her eyes reached her.
Nat finally spoke up, coming to sit by Nathan. Bruce followed. No, he wasn’t the pregnant one, but he needed support too. “You guys are okay. Everything happens for a reason.” She whispered to him.
Tony reached down to touch himself and Steve swatted his hand away. “No touching.” He reprimanded. Instead Steve used his thumb to rub his clit in rapid circles.
“I want to get to know you, Tony.” Stephen carried on. “All of you, if you’ll give me the chance,” and he brought Tony’s hands up to his lips and kissed his knuckles.
The next time Steve and Tony saw Nat, Tony had the arc reactor in his chest and Nat was a full-blown Russian spy. It had been a rough two years. When she returned, she brought Director Nick Fury and Agent Barton. Then Bruce and Thor came along and Fury wanted to form the Avengers. Thor’s brother was on the loose wreaking havoc and Fury wanted all 6 of them to stop him. Tony didn’t want any part of it. He only wished to stay at home and care for his kids. But then Carol reminded him that it would be a waste to not use his powers to help people who needed it. He used his kids as an excuse of course and Rhodey convinced him otherwise, told him to look around. They all had kids. They had to do this for their kids so that they could have a safer world to grow up in.
Pepper noticed it. “You mean, you outgrew him.” Amelia didn’t respond but Pepper took her silence as all the confirmation needed. “I know you don’t need my advice. You’re an adult now and I’m not saying you should get back with Jacob but harnessing your powers, being a superhero doesn’t mean you have to abandon family, friends, people you say you love.”
Dr McIntosh found the baby just as easily as last time, and Steve and Tony watched in awe at the sight of the baby. Tony was supposed to be 11 weeks along today.
“And we’re afraid – I’m afraid of any of you ending up in that type of predicament.” Tony spoke up as he focused solely on Peter. Peter was starting to feel guilty for still seeing Wade behind their backs, but Wade wasn’t like Peggy. He would never take advantage of him; Wade was different, and Wade happened to love him. Peter’s cheeks burned with embarrassment.
“You’ll be the death of me.” Steve confessed when he could form words again. He pulled his soften cock slowly out of Tony. He saw him wince and his hole was red and puffy still gaping for something to hold onto and Steve’s cum leaking out of him.
Steve sighed. He was avoiding Tony because he couldn’t stand to see him with Stephen Strange and he fell into depression. “I knew you were okay, the kids told me.” He said it nonchalantly, trying to put on a brave face. “And I figured you were happy with your new fiancée. Tony Strange.” Steve spat, staring at the ring on Tony’s finger.
Dinner was good. The atmosphere was so cheerful and positive. Conversations flowed freely and easily, and no one was going at it with each other. Everything said and done was genuine. Morgan didn’t know the last time she had a family dinner in her home that was this positive. There weren’t fights. No one was ever at another person’s throat with a knife – so to speak – but it could never be this passive at the Stark Mansion.
“Never know until you try.” Stephen quipped, slipping a hand into his pajama pants. Tony grabbed the hand that was descending, shooting him a glare.
“Okay. I’ll let that slide because I did kind of oversleep,” she confessed and that wasn’t the usual for Morgan Stark Rogers. She never missed a beat. Everything needed to be perfect. She was super uptight, but Tony eased her out of that the day he noticed that his only daughter was turning into a female version of Steve Rogers. She often mimicked everything her father did as a child and Tony being the complete opposite wasn’t having that. She needed a balance but now she was 70% Steve and 30% Tony.
“Don’t,” He warned. “Hold it.” He took his hand away from his clit and focused on his thrusts; each one going deeper and deeper into his warm, wet cunt. Tony was frantic. Steve was about to explode. Literally.
The message was from Stephen fucking Strange and Tony knew he had to respond or his lack of, would indicate a confirmation.
“I do like you.” Torunn confessed. Her chat with her Uncle Loki in December came to mind. No point hiding her feelings. Maybe he would return them. They were getting married after all.
“Well, I just met him last night but he’s cocky, full of himself, definitely thinks he’s better than everyone. None of us really like him.” He was referring to himself, Peter and Morgan. “But if Mom likes him then I guess it’s whatever.”
“Baby. I’m not Steve. I’d never do that.” He assured him as he strolled towards their bed and joined him there. “You’re stuck with me.” He quipped, kissing the only man he’s ever loved.
“We are. I’m almost finished here.” She motioned for Carol to walk with her, making their way to the elevator. Pepper was still typing away on the tablet in her hand as their conversation progressed. After some time, Carol inquired about how the party planning was going.
Maria turned the chair around, so Morgan was facing her. “I know honey. I promise you though, it gets better.” Morgan didn’t know how it could ever get better. When would the pain go away? When would she stop feeling guilty? When would she stop blaming herself for losing the baby? She and Nathan hadn’t even decided what they wanted to do. Maybe that was their karma. They took too long to decide, and the universe took their blessing away.
“Well, Morgan and I don’t know how to feel about it. And it’s so strange; it has nothing to do with us, but we can’t help thinking about what our mom must have been feeling.” Peter went on. He looked up at Wade. Maybe this was too much information for him to handle.
“Dead people can’t bother you or mom.” She went on, pressing deeper into Stephen’s flesh as she focused her eyes on her mother, who seemed to be encouraging her with a glimmer of sadistic joy in his matching brown eyes.
She and Nathan were in his bed some time later cuddling and going through his photo albums together. They looked at his baby pictures, kid pictures, family pictures over the years. Family pictures with his mother’s side of the family; family pictures with Nat’s side of the family too. Nathan pointed everyone out as they went along. Morgan knew most of Nathan’s immediate family – the Rosses but there were also a few faces she didn’t recognize. Nathan didn’t hesitate to fill her in.
“Harley. I was wondering if you’d like to lay with me?” she spoke softly, approaching him and placing a hand on his cheek before kissing the other.
“Okay. I need some proof here.” Steve started, leaning against a set of counters with Tony by his side. “How did you three decide that your sister, your own flesh and blood was a killer?”
“Good morning sir,” FRIDAY announced through the speakers in Tony’s room. “Morning Friday,” Tony replied, eyes still closed and unconsciously reached out to the other side of his bed. Of course there was no one there, another morning of waking up alone. He somehow always forgot that Steve Rogers wasn’t his husband anymore and it had been a year since the divorce was finalized. Three years since he last had sex. Three years since someone else pleasured him, he thought, finally opening his eyes and reaching into his bedside table drawer for his vibrator. He pulled down his pajama pants and started massaging himself and an inch away from inserting the vibrator when Friday spoke again.
“Thank you, Anna.” Torunn said, getting up so they could share a hug. Harley followed suit. He knew things would look suspicious if he didn’t play nice with his sister and he didn’t need her or anyone else thinking something was going on.
Morgan rolled her eyes. “I’m sorry, okay?” She tried. “Look we should have a family dinner, all of us.” They could address all of this.
“This is why I got inseminated.” Pepper protested. “I didn’t want to deal with any man.” Pepper was briefing Carol on what took place when Remy LeBeau showed up at his house and introduced himself to Amelia. The incident left Amelia to believe her mother had lied to her about her conception. Remy wanted to meet and talk so she gave him the benefit of the doubt and met her for coffee and talk, they did.
Stephen knew what was coming so he didn't give Steve the chance to speak further. “Let’s do a DNA test. You owe me that much.” He bargained. It was really that simple. If they could prove him wrong then…maybe he could try to move on from Tony.
Steve wondered how Stephen had reacted to that. He would pay to see that but he didn’t dwell on that thought for too long though or question it out loud. This was the opportunity presenting itself if they wanted to try working things out and get back to where they use to be. Together and happy because they never stopped being in love.
Harley was in complete awe of everything about Asgard. It really was a stunning place, that shimmered in gold when the rays of light hit it just right. Loki was the first member of the royal family waiting on the steps of the palace to greet Torunn and Harley. Torunn greeted her Aunt and cousin next. Loki hugged Harley, Hela said a brief hello and Nertha smirked at him. Harley sucked on one of his teeth to keep from saying anything degrading before the King and Queen. Nertha was now one of his least favourite persons in the world but maybe he should thank her for what she’d done. He probably would have never turned his life around had she not subjected him to mind control.
Tony couldn’t hold back his tears as he walked down to meet his Steve. They hugged when they were face to face and shared a kiss prior to turning to meet their audience’s eyes. Tony laughed. Everyone was wearing pajamas too.
“It doesn’t matter to me.” He lied. It did. It meant everything and he’d be crushed if the baby wasn’t his. But this was Tony’s choice to make. Tony’s decision. Tony’s body.
Steve entwined his fingers with Tony’s. His back was pressed up against Steve’s middle and Steve was leaving kitten licks and nibbles on his ear. Their eyes were closed, and they were at least three layers deep under the multiple bed sheets.
"Steve is great." Tony explained. "He's moving in tomorrow. You'll get to meet him. You'll see he's a good guy." He insisted. "He's
“Couldn’t let you win, little brother.” She smirked, heading in the direction of their mother. No, no she couldn’t. She always had to win. Good to see the old Morgan was back, however.
“I’m really so sorry, Anna. It was crazy of me to even think such a thing.” She explained, pulling Anna into a tight hug.
Steve released his hand, turning him around so he could walk him out of the party and unto one of the balconies attached to the 4
Harley grinned at her and patted the barstool next to him, when they stopped kissing. She took the seat. He rose from his seat and began sharing a plate from the food dishes on display. “I made you breakfast.” He explained.
“It’s been years, yeah. But you know things never got better after that.” Bruce fixed his glasses, ending the conversation with that last statement and Nat went looking for Tony afterwards.
Gamora, Peter Quill and Nebula were fortunate enough to make it Tony’s Christmas party this year. Tony had started the tradition back in 2012, the year the Avengers had broken up and parted ways. The guardians did try to be in attendance each year but saving the galaxy always got in the way. This was their second time around and of course they couldn’t all be in attendance, so they took turns.
Steve snarled, hands circling Tony’s waist in a bruising hold as he pulled Tony down, hard, on his cock, keeping him still as Steve came in his ass; cock pulsing in time with Tony’s galloping heart. The warm, wet feeling of Steve’s cum deep inside him, the savage expression on Steve’s face, his teeth bared in a snarl, was too much for him and Tony erupted, cock untouched, cum spilling out and painting Steve’s heaving abs with sticky, white streaks.
“Steve!” the man yelled, arm waving as he came closer. Steve could make out the simple, red gambeson and the brown leather pants the man wore. That wasn’t right. Steve hadn’t seen anyone on this field wearing at least some armour. What was the man yelling about?
“It still looked like flirting to me,” Tony mutters sullenly, pleased and appeased, but still feeling petty about the whole thing. Steve releases him with a sigh and pinches the bridge of his nose.
“What’s that?” Steve asked absently, more interested in Tony neck, kissing and nipping at the soft skin until small marks blossomed, than Bucky’s relationship status.
Steve chuckles and leans in to press an achingly tender kiss to Tony’s lips. “He’s probably hoping to persuade me to give him the small strip of land at our north border, the one with the little river floating through it? He’s wanted that land for years; maybe he thinks if he entices me with a sweet, young omega, I won’t notice the deed for transfer of ownership he’s snuck into the pile he gave me this morning.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Bruce replied dryly. “Maybe the fact that Steve invited you and you’re so in love with him you can’t deny him anything he asks of you?”
“He won’t kill anyone if he’s left for dead,” Tony said. “Now, get everything ready and send Loki here; last I saw Patrick was with him.”
Tony doesn’t need to open his eyes to know Steve’s smiling. “Then you told him to go fuck himself and he punched you in the face.”
“This is amazing,” Fury stated when Tony was done. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Why haven’t we done it like this before?” he demanded sharply, turning to Rhodes and Happy.
Tony snorted. “You could say that. I never could’ve imagined that you’d be this huge troll with the driest sense of humor, or that you’re the stubbornest man in the country.”
“Then where does that leave Anna?” Harley wondered. He knew she was up to something, but she couldn’t pin her to anything at this point.
Harley laughed. “I’m serious. She knows and I didn’t say I was using these contacts. I just know a few single people. Like um…” He started speaking with one hand before it rested on his chin. “Like…Lila Barton.”
Pepper wanted to question her further, when she realized she was already running late for work. “Whatever gets you out of my pyjamas and out of my fridge.” She bid Carol a farewell and headed out her front door. "See you later."
Ellie became a buffer to expel any tension in their conversations. Anna could understand Wade’s nature, but she just wasn’t used to individuals trying to touch her and if Wade knew of her powers, she was certain he’d be more cautious.
Rhodey got some assistance from a nurse and Tony asked for Sharon’s room. The receptionist informed him of such, only getting the floor number out before he was hurrying to the given floor via the elevator. He rushed through the halls stopping at each room, now wishing he had stayed to hear all the receptionist had to say.  But Tony couldn't wait. He was itching to share everything which had been revealed to him in the last couple of hours. The cause of Steve’s infidelity, the real father of Sharon’s child and most importantly, the possibility that their daughter – thought to be dead after all this time – may be alive.
Since the night of the incident, Nathan hadn’t left Stark Mansion. He was there as Morgan went through her grief. Right now, Maria was staying with Morgan. Nathan had left her side unwillingly to take care of his basic needs per Maria’s requests. Peter and Torunn were in school and Steve and Tony were somewhere else in the building, no doubt close by.
“When Aunt Nat and I made up, we made a joke about going to SHIELD to teach Hammer a lesson for messing with our family.” She provided. “I told Anna about it.” Because why wouldn’t she share that joke with her sister. “But she
Tony wanted to have a family dinner. His children were resenting him except for Anna, and he knew it. When Morgan arrived at the mansion for dinner, she was surprised to find the dining room empty. She called out, a homemade dish in her hand and a response came from Peter as he joined her in the dining area.
“This isn’t your baby.” Tony stated. He didn’t know how many more times he’d have to say it for Stephen to understand. Still he ignored him.
Harley interrupted him and spoke his next words harshly. "But you're not my father. I don't care if you marry him. You don't get to call me that. If anything, since I don't even know you, you should be calling me Mr Stark."
“He’s the father of my children – my four children.” He reminded him, folding his arms over his chest. “We co-parent –” Peter and Anna were still under 18. “– and we’re friends.”
. Harley worried about that at times; Torunn was no doubt going to outlive him. “But if you ever need to get laid, I still have a few contacts.” Harley smirked.
He wasn't sure how he'd tell his sons about their new sibling yet but in the meantime, he needed them to respect his future husband. He absolutely loved Steve and prayed everyday that he wouldn't leave him.
They shared another hug and parted ways. Amelia returned to her conversations with her friends and he made himself scarce, aiming for the exit.
“Hey.” Her voice caught his attention as he stood by her open front door, awaiting Amelia’s appearance. He refrained from entering her home, even though Pepper had invited him in before. He preferred to wait outside. Pepper would write it off as strange, but she respected his wishes and never pushed it. “Can I ask you something, Remy?”
Carol spotted Pepper giving out orders to people, in preparation for Tony’s annual Christmas party in less than two months. “Hey” she approached her, “I thought we were still on for lunch today.”
TAGS, WARNINGS and RELATIONSHIP TAGS may be refering to the Past, Present or Both! They might be only mentioned, done in real time OR both. I'll also be adding more tags as I go along...
Anna stared at him for a second, wondering if she should answer him genuinely. Tony encouraged her, when she looked his way. “I could kill you – drain your life force.” Her voice was small. “That is if my skin touches yours long enough. I could steal your memories and
“Yes Tony, you did the right thing. The guy was what? Almost 30?” Pepper started. Tony nodded. “I would have done the same thing had it been Amelia or Calvin.”
“Mr Stark-Rogers.” Wade greeted him, shrinking at just his very presence. Very few things scared him, and Tony Stark-Rogers had newly become one of them.
Torunn looked stunning. She stood before the full-length mirror in her dressing room admiring how well her handmaids had prepared her for her special day and her friends surrounded her. Morgan was busy elsewhere; Cassie Lang was stooping behind her as she fixed her dress’s elaborate train and Lila Barton was adjusting her crown but had yanked a little harder than need be. Torunn groaned as a result of it.
“No Steve.” He confirmed. He got up and placed a kiss on her forehead. “You should rest Aunt Peggy,” he walked away from her and directed his next words to his mother. “I’ll be outside mom.” He knew she’d want to stay a while longer with Peggy. She was one of her only friends.
“Oh, that’s just rich!” Tony exclaimed. “So, how’s Sharon?” Everyone knew Steve was still sleeping with her. Sharon made sure everyone knew. Steve stayed silent so Tony used the opportunity to make his point.
“Her royal highness, Princess Torunn of Asgard, Goddess of Thunder,” the minister spoke. “And for the first time, His royal highness, Prince Harley of Asgard.”
“Hey.” Tony whispered, holding onto his upper arm. They were both dressed in black as per traditional funeral attire. He held no animosity towards Steve. “Can I ask how you are?”
As the party progressed around the couple, Harley kept an arm around Torunn’s naked waist, thanks to the design of her dress and pressed kisses to her lips while hiking up the front of her dress in the front. Fortunately for the two, the table and its cloth concealed their fondling from everyone’s eyes. Torunn felt warm fingers on her inner thigh and a moan slipped from her mouth into his.
While the party went on and Peter finally got what he always wanted, Anna had gone in search of her boyfriend. She thought Remy might be waiting close by to wish her a happy birthday but somehow, she found him walking away from her Aunt Natasha. It angered her, which left her to ask, once he was in earshot,
“Carol, if this is your way of getting close to Thor and Sif –” because Rhodey wasn’t buying that. Not for a second.
“Torunn’s coronation was a success.” And there were plenty of outsiders present. “I wouldn’t worry.” He reminded his wife, beaming at her but Thor seemed to had forgotten that drama always followed the Stark-Rogers family somehow.
Dr McIntosh glanced back at the screen for a second. “We’ll have to do an ultrasound to be sure.” Tony nodded, still in shock as she led him into another room. He really wasn’t expecting this kind of news today.
“Thanks Pep,” Tony began pouring them both a drink when they reached his office. The room was all glass and Tony stood at one of his windows admiring the view of New York City, below.
Amelia was Pepper’s daughter. Morgan was as close to her as Pepper was and still is to Tony, best friends since birth. She and her brother Calvin were family, like the cousins the Stark-Roger kids never had. Amelia was almost the spitting image of her mother with even brighter red hair and her mother’s calm and collected personality.
“Well, I made an appointment today for the doctor’s.” Tony informed him and Stephen’s face lit up. He wanted this more than anything else in the world. “It’s just an appointment to see if I have any eggs left and what my options might be otherwise.”
Steve had found out first and told Tony the night he and Stephen had broken up. He’d sent him a simple text, hoping they’d get a chance to discuss it in person, soon after. Once they had that conversation, it was Tony who sought Anna out and spoke with her one-on-one, the day they had a recent family dinner. The day, he and Tony decided to rekindle their relationship, officially. Morgan and Peter had cut that conversation short, however and Tony made up an excuse,
“When we were younger – before you moved in, Amelia had the world’s largest crush on Peter Quill. It was insatiable.” Torunn glanced at her and then back at Morgan as she continued. “I thought she’d finally gotten over that. I mean we were 10.”
Steve then pulled out his phone and texted Tony to ask how Peggy was doing. He also had plenty of missed calls and texts from Sharon, but he wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction of acknowledgement. He tried to break things off with her a few days ago and then she dropped a bombshell on him. She was pregnant and Steve didn’t know what to do anymore. Sam had laughed at him and Bucky had yet to say anything about it. His words were clearly lost on Steve.
Tony looked away. He felt guilty for hurting him. He knew Steve had felt like they were on the verge of rekindling their relationship, but Stephen was still in the picture and he still had feelings for him. He was happy with Stephen. Really. He sighed, whispering his name. “Steve –” He was interrupted.
He managed to make it outside the room this time. His phone went off signaling a new message. It was Steve.
She knew her parents meant well. She knew in her heart that they still loved each other but her Dad had broken her Mom’s trust all those years ago and things could never be the same again. She did miss that. But for now she would live vicariously through the Banners. She just needed to soak up all this positive family energy a little while longer and that’s why she chose to spend the night.
Bucky instinctively ran his fingers through her curls with his other hand as she only had a headband holding back her mane. It always surprised him, at how much hair she had. Sam, on the other hand, wasn’t. He would just point at Bucky who hadn’t had a proper hair cut in months and was currently sporting armpit-length hair. Sam loved it though. He loved to yank at it during sex.
, but I wouldn’t put it pass you.” She baited and Anna lunged at her, pinning her to the ground. Steve then swooped in, pulling Anna back.
When the line went dead, Jacob found Harley venturing into his room. He noticed there was something a little off about Harley but maybe he was just hangover. He’d spent all night out with Nertha. Harley had become very preoccupied with Nertha as of late; more than the usual.
Tony opened his mouth to speak but the words wouldn’t come out. He was happy he had found Stephen but if he was going to blow a gasket, get angry, make a scene, get loud whenever Steve was mentioned, was it worth it? With all this jealousy, hatred towards Steve nested deep in the relationship when Tony had chosen Stephen and not Steve. It wasn’t a fresh start. He felt more hurt than happiness with that burden weighing them down.
“I’ve ran it by him a few times. Your father has selective hearing.” Tony explained. Peter could understand that. Steve only ever heard what he wanted to hear.
Peter dared to roll his eyes. “Okay. What about when she isn’t here?” Wade struggled to find an answer. His hold on Peter’s waist loosened. “Did I do something wrong?”
“Funny you should ask.” Someone said. Tony knew that voice. The person joined them at the wedding arch, sporting a very large baby bump. Tony wasn’t expecting that from him. “Yours truly of course.”
“You’re dating doctors now?” he took a breath. “Who are you? And what have you done with Anthony Stark Rogers?” The mention of Rogers stung but he had to remember he never got around to changing his name again following the divorce, so legally he was still Anthony Stark Rogers.
That ticked Jacob off and within a second he had her pushed up against the closest wall, his right arm pressed firmly against her chest to keep her in place. Nertha was strangely turned on by it all and she licked her lips, noting that Jacob’s lips are only an inch away from her own. She wouldn’t mind spending a night with him.
“No, asshole,” he simply said. His calm was such a stark contrast to the alpha’s rage, it took Steve’s breath away.
“I won’t claim you this time, Tony,” Steve panted harshly. His eyes were wild, pupils so enlarged they had swallowed all of the blue Tony loved so much. His hair was a tangled mess around his face and his cheeks a tantalizing red. His body against Tony’s was like standing in front of the forge, pouring heat into Tony’s and amplifying the roaring fire burning in his veins. “I’ll stay and help you, Gods help me, because I love you too, and it would kill me to leave you like this when you need me.”
“You’re - such – a - dork!” Tony all but yowled when Steve put his back into his thrusts, hips pistoning into Tony so hard he could swear he saw stars. All thoughts of hurt feelings, angry words and why would Steve think he never got to lead, blew away in the face of Steve’s passionate love-making. He didn’t let Tony catch his breath or give him any chance to protest, simply pouring everything he was into blowing Tony’s mind away with each, fierce thrust.
“Stop!” Tony strangled out around the blood in his mouth. “Don’t do this!” They shouldn’t touch him; Steve would kill them and then him for
“Harem.” Steve snorts derisively. “Even if I had one, what would I do with it?” He’s silent after that, letting Tony finish the second braid and start weaving the third and final one. Tony’s never been one for quiet, but he can’t help but enjoy this tranquil moment, the pause from their daily responsibilities too precious to waste on arguing. It seems like Steve enjoys it too, because he sits quietly while Tony works and tries to push the rising sense of dread down and not let it overtake his thoughts completely.
That was not what Stephen wanted to hear. “Are we breaking up?” Stephen’s voice had faltered. Tony could hear his unwelcomed sadness.
Maria’s voice broke her train of thought. “I had countless miscarriages before I had Tony.” She confessed. Morgan didn’t know that.
Torunn and Harley looked on. That was a couple they never saw coming. Though they supposed, no one could have ever imagined that. They both knew Jacob was a good guy though and Nertha had good qualities. They could make each other happy if things worked out, regardless of their personalities and backgrounds and the 5-year age gap between them. And that was all the couple could ever really ask for, for Harley’s best friend and Torunn’s cousin. Everyone deserved happiness.
I'll understand if you don't like this chapter. It wasn't my best work but thank you so much for reading! Reviews, Comments & Kudos are always welcome! 💛💙❤
By the time, they had the reception that consisted of mostly breakfast and lunch items. The thought was long forgotten especially when the Grandmaster of Sakaar made an appearance, doting over Loki and what he could only assume was their baby.
He knew he repeatedly hurt Tony but he never cheated after the first time. He knew Tony deserved better. He deserved better than him and most of all, he deserved happiness. Nothing else had ever been easy in his life. Why should he add to his pain? Steve finally opted for, “We never…never again.” It was just that one time, that one stupid mistake that cost him everything.
“You didn’t let me finish.” He pulled Steve closer if that was possible. “One of the worst but one of the best.” He kissed Steve and Steve grasped Tony’s ass, raising a leg as he did to nestle the tip of his cock inside Tony. “I’d do it again…” He trailed off and Steve mumbled in agreement.
She and Bruce sang him Happy Birthday as best they could; Nat more than Bruce being the better singer. They sat on either side of his bed and Nat ran through the events of the day per his requests. They had made his favorite breakfast. They each got him a gift and he wanted to spend the day with Morgan before they had dinner together, later that night.
“Then there are individuals like you who need two partners.” Pepper sighed. It was a little peculiar, the whole polygamous relationship but that was Carol's lifestyle and Rhodey's and Valkyrie's. “That is probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard of in my 44 years of life.” Carol had a little smirk etched on her lips. “Are you three planning a three-person wedding too?”
Once inside and the case had been introduced, the judge offered Tony’s lawyer, Lance Tate to speak first. Nova Caffrey may be one of the best, but so was Tate.
“I think Morgan’s losing the baby.” He whispered and saying the words alone was painful enough. Why was this happening?
Soon her husband joined her on the balcony. “It looks good.” Thor commented, standing by her with an arm around her waist.
“Don’t forget she needs to be home by 10 am tomorrow.” Carmelita finally uttered in full, unadulterated English to Wade. She stooped to Ellie’s level to hug her. “Nos vemos mañana, nena. Te quiero.”
Pepper understood. They talked about you-know-who a lot. “As much as I wish they weren’t, they are.” She sympathized with Carol. She tried to omit the name from the list every year but Tony wasn’t having it. “Tony wouldn’t be happy if they weren’t invited.”
“Remember I told you, me and most of my family found out who my dad had the affair with all those years ago.” Wade could recall it.
“I’m such a big fan.” Justin lied and he saw Stephen’s interest grow in his eyes and his smile. “Yeah. I work over at the Margot Robbie building at the hospital. We love you over there.” Then Stephen was turning his entire body to face him, and Justin used that opportunity to sit one bar stool closer to him.
Torunn snatched the knife sheathed on Loki’s hip and threw it in Nertha’s direction. It went flying past Nertha’s face and her eyes widen in horror as it missed her by an inch, cutting off a couple strands of her dark hair. Nertha fired back in an instant, levitating Torunn high up above them. Loki and Hela watched in amusement. Then Torunn’s eyes began to glow as she summoned enough lightning to target Nertha and give her a shock. Nertha screamed in pain upon impact, dropping Torunn to the ground. The princess caught herself, landing on her feet. She pushed a lock of blonde hair that had fallen out back in its place.
“I know.” Bruce was there to hand her tissues and push her hair out of her face. Bruce was always so supportive in everything. She couldn’t love him anymore than she already did even if she tried. “I knew in my heart you wouldn’t hurt them like that; not intentionally. We’re good now.”
“You don’t have to do anyone. Just go on one date with him. From what Christine’s told me, I think you guys would make a good match.”
Pietro and Cassie joined Morgan’s circle of conversation which included Torunn, Amelia, Lila and Michelle – all the girls who secretly lusted after Pietro Maximoff. They hung unto every word that passed his lips as he spoke about his worldly travels whether their significant others were present or not.
“I missed you too mother,” Torunn responded. She then turned her attention to Hela, hugging her Aunt before she could deny it. “No Nertha?” she questioned.
“It’s me honey.” Peter seemed to have recognized him, gladly taking the finger Steve had extended and calmed down a bit.
“And Dad’s work is phenomenal. Tremendously good at what he does.” Morgan added. Steve grinned at his daughter. Yeah, she was forever his favorite child. He didn’t ever have to ask her to make him sound good, she just did it on her own.
Just a heads-up if the format of this chapter looks any different compared to others, I've been on vacation and have been subjected to typing on my phone.
“Because she’s not Paige.” Peter put in, finally joining them. The members of the Asgardian royal family were lingering nearby. Tony instantly started worrying.
That’s why Harley was irritated by the fact that Jaime Kozlov, Natasha’s nephew was getting more of Torunn’s attention than him. Everything was fine until Lila Barton came over with the guy, stealing Torunn’s attention from him. Lila had scoffed at the sight of Harley but greeted Nathan and Torunn fairly before introducing Jaime to them.
“Oh dad.” And Morgan got up from her seat so she could be by her father’s side. They shared a heartfelt embrace and she couldn’t prevent herself from getting a little teary-eyed in the process.
Steve collected Tony and led him into the room after everyone else but not before checking to make sure he was doing okay. Tony felt fine. Their children were just driving him up the wall at this point. For being, if not almost being adults they were terribly childish.
Steve sighed not bothering to give a look through the peephole to see who was there before he opened the door.
Torunn cut him off, holding onto one of the hands that were cradled her cheek. Harley dropped the other one and stared at her few concerned eyes. “I know but what if I gave up my place in the line of succession?” Her brother, Prince Magni would be next. A male heir as the Asgardians were so used to having.
Stephen had access to his home. He could come and go as he pleased so it wasn’t a surprise that he was exiting the elevator now onto the 3
“Last week.” He answered way too quickly. “I took the kids to go see my mom. We all helped her out with her garden and –” Tony rambled on until, she interrupted.
“I didn’t know we were re-instating guards for the royal family, Father” Torunn wondered, looking to her father. That had not been a thing since Odin’s reign.
“You’re a part of the X-men?” Peter questioned his newly found twin. It was another family dinner night and the entire family was seated at the table in the Stark Mansion. They’d only gotten Anna back a week ago and everyone was doing their part in making her feel welcomed into her family. That included anyone with the name Rogers or Stark and of course Torunn whom still lived at the Mansion.
she thought. “Does it matter?” she asked. Anna had heard it from Morgan. She was close with her older sister; they shared many things with each other.
Morgan concluded that Nat might have been the one who killed Hammer and Remy must have been the other person at SHIELD the night it happened, that’s how he must have found out what Nat was doing. Natasha was after all, the one who was determined to pay Hammer a visit but never followed through.
“Yeah. I'm not the smartest person but I know I like Peter and I want to be with him. One day. When he’s older of course. I'll wait for him.” Wade chimed in, subconsciously reaching out for Peter’s hand and squeezing it for comfort. Peter took it willingly.
“When Sharon told me she was pregnant, I was angry, furious but the more I thought about the baby, the happier I was. The thought of holding that little life, caring for them, it made me so happy.”
Steve wanted to hold him in his arms and tell him everything was okay like he used to when he had episodes of PTSD and he wanted to apologize for all the pain he caused him. He had stayed with him and tried to move pass it but of course him staying in contact with her didn’t help the situation. Tony thought he was still cheating and after 9 years, he caught Steve in a moment with Sharon Carter. Steve explained nothing had happened but it was too much for Tony to handle. They became on and off for the next few years for the sake of their kids. But Tony got fed up with the situation and ending up filing for divorce for the sake of his own sanity. Steve signed, unwillingly and it was just finalized a year ago after 3 years of processing.
“I’m sorry for doubting you.” Tony sniffled. He’d been silently crying with each revelation he made.
"It's a promise." Harley assured him. His father didn't deserve anymore heartache. He wouldn't let it happen.
“You’re right. Congratulations.” He tried to sound sincere, but Tony wasn’t fooled. He also decided that he didn’t care much as he joined the checkout line, but Stephen was still close by. “How far along are you?” He questioned.
The baby boy came into their lives with a head full of Steve’s exact shade of blonde hair and a matching white streak like his sister before him, Anna. The couple worried their son might have a unique power as Anna did. It surprised Steve and Tony still, that this rarity had happened a second time but it was something that made their baby boy unique if his exact replica of Steve’s features were anything to go by. No way in hell he could have been Stephen Strange's son.
“Definitely better than Strange.” Morgan agreed. Steve grinned at her. “I’m always on your side Dad.” That he was always sure of. He hugged his little girl tighter.
Ellie peered up at her father under long lashes. “Very bad words…about you.” Her eyes were apologetic as she pointed at Peter. She pulled the same face Wade always made whenever he was trying to apologize.
Steve was at St. Grace’s hospital. Sharon had gone into labour earlier than expected. Rhodey had accompanied Tony to said hospital with the goal of getting his wounds – earned from the battle, treated. Tony had neglected his.
Steve shook his head, handing him another tissue from the box that had been resting on his coffee table before them. His living room was relatively dark except for a lamp by the sofa on a side table. Tony hadn’t gotten a chance to survey the room properly upon his arrival as he’d never been over prior to this night. The apartment was lovely however, from what he had seen; it felt like Steve as odd as that sounded.
“But at this point,” he went on. “I’m thinking that we should just stop trying and let things be. We already have Winter.”
“No.” He assured him, quickly, after which he trailed off into silence. He maintained this for only so long before he forced himself to fess up. “I’m a virgin.”
“I worried I would be nervous, but I am very excited, mother.” And Torunn beamed with said excitement. “I love him.”
“I’m sorry.” Morgan took a step towards her parents. Since no one was speaking, she’d gladly break the ice. “Did you just say Aunt Nat is the woman you cheated on Mom with?” She paused, narrowing her eyes at her father. “Aunt Nat is the homewrecker?” For a lack of better words and she found Nat among the crowd, looking ashamed of herself. She came forward and so did Steve. “You’re the person that made my parents’ marriage fall apart?”
He didn’t want a relationship with his birth father and he needed time to forgive his birth mother for he already had a family and he had no intention to come back to the U.S. after this visit. His family wasn't there and Lila Barton was eager to move back with him to his home country.
The moment his butt hit the chair he had to ask, “Why didn’t you tell me Strange was here?” Sam skimmed over the guests until he spotted Strange by a table across the lawn sitting with Tony. They were holding hands and Strange was whispering in Tony’s ear from time to time.
“Talk to me Tony.” He begged. Tony straightened up, wrapping his arms around Steve. Steve welcomed the embrace, being careful not to squeeze too tightly as he lifted Tony’s feet off the ground.
“Nice place, guys.” Jaime commented, taking in the decor of Nathan and Morgan’s new home. His Aunt Natasha and Bruce had picked him up from the airport and this was the first place he wanted to go. Nathan had talked so much about his place with Morgan, it made Jaime eager to see it and Morgan was proud of it, after weeks of decorating. The trio got comfortable on one of their sofas before Nathan left them to go tend to a meowing Binx – their black kitten, their baby.
“Yes Wade.” Peter remarked, rolling his eyes again. “I told you I was a virgin.” He knew this. Wade hummed, pretending to recall that being said on numerous occasions and finally letting out a laugh. Peter silenced him with a kiss. They’d figure it out together, eventually. There was no pressure or hurry. Slow was good for that type of thing and they both had to be ready for it.
“But I was always so careful Buck.” Steve ran his hands down his face before clasping them together under his nose, his elbows resting on the little tea party table set up before them. Clearly, he wasn’t careful enough.
“What?” Tony shouted, ripping right through the centre of the giant armour, and destroying its poorly created and designed, make-shift arc reactor. He landed a few feet away from Justin. He didn’t seem to be affected by the destruction of his armour.
She didn’t respond to him. Instead she directed her words to Tony. “Tony…” she paused. Tony looked at her expectantly. Steve pleaded with his eyes, begging her not to say anything. His efforts were futile. “I’m so sorry…we kind of...” she trailed off and Tony was getting a little concerned.
She got dressed and went in search of him. Her first thoughts were that he was probably in the lab in the basement so that’s where she went. Harley tend to have invention ideas in the middle of the night and got up to work on them right away.
At that point, she pulled herself up and turned to face Bruce. He was smiling at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners behind his glasses. He pushed a stray hair behind her ear. Nat held unto the hand as it rested on the side of his face.
“Mimi, can I ask what happened between you and Jacob?” She began, watching her daughter grab a bottle of water from the fridge.
“That’s terrible.” Morgan sympathized. She had so much freedom. She’d probably lose her mind if her parents started dictating her life again like she was a kid. So maybe being the daughter of a King and Queen wasn’t all it was cracked out to be.
and Tony gave birth four days later, a week after his due date. When Tony went into labour, Steve had rushed to the hospital to be with him, learning about it from his mother-in-law, Maria. Tony was too far gone on anaesthetics and in pain to argue with Steve when he had asked him specifically to not be in the room when he had the twins.
Sharon was only a second away from tears that spurted from anger. A baby wouldn’t keep Steve Rogers in her life, wouldn’t keep him with her romantically, so what would?
Tony shook his head. Steve rested him on the only other piece of furniture in the art studio, his sofa. Tony wasted no time in dragging Steve’s pyjama pants down his legs, revealing his painfully erect cock. “For me?” he questioned, his eyes big and doe-like.
“Hey Tones. What’s up?” he said it all casual and innocent like he didn’t know what he had done. Steve got closer than he really needed to be and Tony couldn’t just let that slide.
I mentioned a blonde checking Bucky out in Chapter 13 (2nd scene) when he was at the bar with Steve & Nat. That blonde was Justin Hammer. That's the only reason I mentioned that observation made by Nat 😊
“Thank you.” He replied, smiling back at Stephen as he headed out. Stephen could feel his mind already hatching something else up. He couldn’t lose Tony to Steve. He wouldn’t allow it.
“Thank you, sweetie.” Steve was glad they could move pass this. He didn’t like having her or any of his family against him.
Morgan could feel the hint of a smile forming on her lips. Maria loved Tony so much. There wasn’t a doubt. After all her pain and sorrow, she had got her baby in the end.
It was painfully awkward when Tony retreated to the kitchen to get Stephen a plate. Steve spoke up first, merely grumbling under his breath. “I thought this was a family dinner.”
Nat caught on, grinning back at her. “Sounds like a plan.” She responded, jokily. It was good to be on better terms with Morgan again.
And Tony entered the room again, providing answer. "Because Steve's blind." Peter and Harley looked at each other in surprise. "He's never really cared about all that stuff and so I'm positive, Steve really loves me."
Nova knows this isn’t looking good for Steve but that doesn’t deter her. She gives her opening statement before calling Pepper Potts Stark to the stand. Pepper is asked to repeat the court oath, swearing to state only the truth.
Minutes later he was called into Dr McIntosh’s office. Kayla McIntosh was a long-time friend at this point. They first met when Tony was carrying Harley and though he only had three pregnancies, a friendship and mutual respect grew from that and they spent plenty of time together as any pair of friends would. She was now rising from her chair to hug Tony. She looked the same, since the last time he’d seen her – still brunette and short – well a few inches shorter than Tony at least.
Steve was left pondering on his marriage with Tony that fell apart after 15 years and ended legally after 18. Sharon knew it. She’d chosen this date intentionally.
She made to walk away again, and Morgan grabbed her. Her palm ached but she would endure it if she could get the information out of Anna.
“Yes. I know what you’re thinking right now.” Wade remarked and Peter’s eyes widened. He did it again. “I’m kidding,” he confessed sitting by the ledge of the building. Peter followed suit, keeping a safe distance between them. “I followed you home a few times.”
Justin Hammer sat at the bar. The same one Stephen Strange liked to visit, every day after work for a drink or two around 10 pm like clockwork. Justin already had a drink in hand when Strange walked in and sat two barstools away from him. He ordered a whiskey and Justin started to put his plan into effect. He retrieved his phone from within his jacket and pretended to read a message that got him a little ticked off.
