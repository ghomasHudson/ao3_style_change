He chugs whats left of the bottle and winces, "Ugg-"  he then goes to lay down on his bed. After Twenty minutes he's feeling calm and relaxed, "Finally.." he sighs, looking up at the ceiling. Waiting for Castiel. He doesn't realize how much time has passed until the front door slams and his body shoots up into a sitting position. Did he fall asleep?
When their eyes meet Dean says, "Dad's right-" and swallows the food in his mouth. "I was gonna pee my pants-" he hiccups, "I almost peed-"
"Yea, s'good birthday." Dean leans in, hesitates but kisses him on the cheek anyway. "Thanks, Cas." he says and walks back inside.
"Come here!" he calls out to him and sets down the weights by his feet. The teen was hesitated to come over since things between them were strange, mostly because he wanted to fuck the boy into the mattress but it was proving to be a hard task to accomplish when the boy is so easily spooked.
Cas' throat hurt like hell suddenly and he grabbed Dean's brother into a deep embrace. "I knew I would like you Sam." he whispered privately in his ear. "Thank you. You just gave me the world." he pulled away with a hidden wink only meant for the younger Winchester. Sam Smiled.
Dean sighs, pushing his nearly full bowl away. "Cas slept over-" the man looks over his shoulder from where he stands in front of the stove. "Nothin' happened-" his uncle is still looking at him. "We made out a lil'-"
but that wasn't going to stop him from assuming that they would be spending most of their time having sex behind closed doors.
Meg could always count on the doctor welcoming her to work with a bright smile that showed off his perfect teeth or a cup of coffee waiting next to the keyboard of her usual computer. If she was lucky, maybe some flowers would be given to her on a special today but today wasn't one of those but she did expect to see his smile. The smile that let her know if he was okay or not, it was his thing.
"I took Dean to get a Halloween costume-" the mechanic laughs and lets him go. "Did you know he wasn't in school today?" he shrugs and reaches for the bag on the table. Castiel bites his tongue once more and goes to check on the boy- he was in his room, looking at a bruise on his hip. "How'd you get that-" his voice is full of concern.
"Yea yea." John huffs, taking out a few twenty dollar bills that were supposed to go towards his son's school supplies and clothes. "This better be the good stuff." he flicks the small bag with his index finger. His eyes look up at his dealer, "What are you standin' there for?"
Castiel licks his lips before inching closer to Dean's neck, placing soft kisses on his creamy skin- he loves the sharp intake of breath Dean takes. "You smell good, Dean." the tip of his tongue dips a little into his ear, he retracts it quickly and nips at his ear lobe. Dean ignores him pretty well until he sucks a small love bite on his neck, near his shoulder. That's when Dean moans.
Dean's eating chips on the living room sofa when there's a knock at the door and instantly he thinks it's weird, it's around the time Castiel comes home from the hospital but why would he knock. He has a key. He sets the bag of chips on the coffee table and gets up to get the door.
Dean broke in tears too, shoulders heaving up and down but he had to remain somewhat in control for Castiel. "Cas-buddy...You're gonna have an amazing life I know it...You're gonna find someone nice and hopefully marry them and have some real cute kids-"
Dean moans again, climbing on the bed anxiously once he's stripped his clothes and starts off with the man's thighs first. He laps at the still cold and white creamy liquid all over his skin. Every time he licks, he makes a sucking sound because that's what hes doing to the older man's skin. He gets carried away, basically french kissing every inch of the man's body that is covered in that sticky sweetness. Dean couldn't help but this that if come tasted this good, he'd swallow it.
Dean blew out all of his candles after making a wish, surprisingly he didn't forget to this time around. This year was a big improvement to the last few years and can only hope for a bright future from here on out.
"You just gonna ignore me forever then?" John sips his coffee, they finished eating a while back. Castiel wanted Dean out of the house as much as possible, it was good for him- so he wasn't in any rush to leave the fast food restaurant. Though by experience, he knew John must be itching to go to the shop already and hide his head under the hood of someone else's car.
“People fall in love.” an eyebrow raised. “You’re older, I knew you must have had other boyfriends or girlfriends.”
"Leave me alone!" He ran off into the apple orchard, upset over his mother telling him that this stay could be final. He didn't want to stay here. California was a better place for him. There was more people like him there.
"I'm home-" he calls out once he lets himself in through the door and quickly finds the father son duo on the sofa. "I brought pizza-"
"We're getting somewhere. You were abandoned by your mother and then your father- it created this fear inside of you that whenever Castiel leaves your side,  it makes you believe he won't be coming back." Dean nods, he'd known this deep down. "We can work on this in our next session-" she writes in her notebook and he knows their time is up.
Dean opens the urn, handing the lid to Bobby before he slowly pours his fathers ashes on the earth. Some of John stays where he's poured, the rest of him floats in the air- carried away by a soft breeze until John Winchester disappears into nothing. Dean shivers, Castiel and Bobby do too. "-all done-" Dean wipes off his hands on his black slacks, he really hated dress pants. They made him feel- well, they made him feel like Castiel. "-let's go!" he walks towards the truck that was parked off in the distance. They follow him.
Dean's therapy appointment draws near and he drives to Robin's house to pick him up, the evidence sitting heavy in his pocket. Like clockwork Dean runs up to the car after he'd been there waiting not even two minutes. "Hey-" he opens the door and gets in. "What-" he says, taking one look at him.
"Please, Bobby-" aside from the panic looked on the teens face, he's oddly calm. "Bobby please don't hurt him-"
Dean sighs, he wants to kiss too but Castiel would kill him. He'd be dead if he found out that he allowed Jack in the house at a time like this. "Don't we all." he says shyly. "When's your baby sister due?" he changes the subject.
His eyes carefully examine his surroundings- he hadn't noticed how drenched in sweat he'd been. His jeans had been soaked through just like the shirt he took off had been.
Once he's done in the shower, Dean goes into the bathroom to clean up and he takes his sweet time in there too. The warm water hitting his skin feels amazing, so amazing that he gets hard though he doesn't intend on rubbing one out there. It had been a while since he's watched porn and tonight he's in the mood, especially since he won't be giving any to Castiel tonight.
Castiel blushed, Dean looked like he loved the sound of his last name attached to Castiel's first. " Go on, They called your name. Cas Winchester. "
Dean whined, “Yeah for sure, but- I like you in a...Okay I think you're hot as fuck.” he didn’t know if he was saying things right. He just wanted Benny.
"Sorry-" Castiel says quietly, mostly to the boy. He walks down the drive way and disappears into his car while John goes to the kitchen to look for something to eat. Dean stays by the open door- watching the car drive away. He didn't know Castiel at all, not really since he'd only been around a few short weeks but he didn't exactly want him to go away forever.
John rubs lubed fingers on Castiel's hole before he pushes in slowly, "Know you wanted this for years-"
Dean smiled faintly. “Right. Yes. Twenty.” He reached over to grab Castiel’s hand and kissed his knuckles once, green eyes gazing into blue eyes. “Happy birthday. I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was your birthday or I would’ve sent you a gift.”
"It's near work." Castiel defends, "Are you feeling better?" they both haven't forgotten about the lube they picked up on the way there.
"Alright, I need to go-" Castiel smiles, "Before-" Dean nods, knowing. "Goodnight baby, I love you."
Dean slows down, he's panting. His face buried into Castiel's shoulder. Dean didn't have an orgasm, only Castiel. He thinks he's okay with that, having had one earlier. This started off just as teasing for Dean, not thinking Castiel would actually go so far as to
Dean shrugs and hops off the bed- what a shame, he actually wanted to continue kissing. "I'm kinda bored now-" he says.
"Good boy-" and the bearded man is off, but not before taking one last slice of pizza with him and a handful of candy.
Castiel knows this first hand because the teen almost did just that a few times, when they were at their worst. "I know baby-"
Once they've checked in, things are awkward and silent as Castiel moves around the room unpacking the few things he brought for himself and for Dean. After all it was a short stay. He couldn't wait until morning so go buy that damn water heater to replace the old one and just go home.
When the bearded man finally excuses him from the kitchen table at almost midnight, he heads off into the shower to hopefully wash off some of the guilt he's feeling. What do you know, it doesn't work and he's feeling just as crummy about the whole thing even after scrubbing his body clean.
Castiel doesn't worry, he knows what he means. He knows their relationship isn't threatened. "We'll figure this out. You're okay." he rubs up and down his back, "It's been a month, We'll get some more blood work done and see where you are."
Castiel looks at his cell phone in the dark, "It's time to go baby-" and elbows the teen. "It's getting late-" but he's not budging. "I want to go home so we can fuck-"
Dean swallows dryly, "I bought these today-" his fingers tug on the lacy waistband of the panties. "Do you like them?" the question is asked innocently.
Dean hiccups before answering with the God honest truth. "She kissed me-" another hiccup. "On my cheek-" and the man nods with no intention of doing that right then. "Can you do it-" he had to fucking ask for it, didn't he.
Castiel sits down next to him, playing with his food. "I'm worried about you, Dean. Everything you told me, I can't-"
"I love my step dad." he admits, watching her reaction but her face doesn't change. "Did you hear me? I said I-"
"Bad kitten." Castiel slaps his cheek gently, Dean moans louder. The bulge in his Jean's now evident so Castiel unbuckles his belt, yanking it off his pants and letting it fall to the floor with a loud thump.
Castiel's holding the teenager in his arms while they watch a movie in bed when they hear something in the house. He's been hearing it for a while now but ignored it. When Dean heard it too, it became impossible to ignore. "You hear that too, don't you?"
Castiel straightens up enough to get some room between them, enough to pull off the teens boxers. "Are you comfortable?" his hands hook behind his knees and push until he's bent in half, only then down he lean forward. "This okay?"
Jody does her best in keeping her patient grounded and feeling safe while in their session. When Dean calms down enough he says something that happens to make her eyes well up with tears as well.
Castiel already disliked this 'Dean' person. "Castiel is my name but I go by Jimmy sometimes...sometimes Castiel gets me bullied."
Castiel's heart melts, "Sure-uh-" he sits down at the kitchen table with his laptop and iced coffee. "-do you mind playing here while I do some research?" he asks and Dean agrees, before he sits next to the man he goes to grab his homework so he can do it at the table. "So, you chose homework over toys, I'm impressed." he comments. They work side by side in silence for about an hour when the boy asks him what he's doing on his computer.
Dean nods frantically, his hand now on the mans hips, helping him up and down. "God-" he groans, "Your ass is so good, why's it so friggin' good-" the sounds of their skin to skin contact was sinful enough, add the moans the man was making were
Dean is about to knock on the door, but instead just yanks it open and steps inside to find the place glowing in sparse candlelight. "Cas?" he looks around and finds him standing in the living room. "Uh, what're you doin' in the dark-"
Sam perks up on the sofa, "My mom's leaving out of town for a few days-" Castiel nods, looking at Dean now- his arms are crossed at his chest.
Dean thinks that it won't be a big deal if he just pours a little bit of water into the bottle and he shakes it a bit before putting it back in it's hiding place. "Aghh-" he whines again, "Fucking-" he catches himself mid curse and goes to sit at the table with his head in his hands.
The teenager takes his sweet time heading next door because he has no idea on how to do laundry, much less use a washing machine and he's got a hunch that he's about to get a really long tutorial on how to use one.
Castiel bit his lip at the stern-ness in the man's voice. " Yeah okay. " He was feeling warm inside again, in his stomach.
"I smell like ass, move." Dean tries to push past him but Castiel kisses his cheek. As if he was trying to kiss him on the lips but missed. He's blushing now. "What's that for?"
Dean struggles, "Four, I think-" he isn't scared- he loves being man handled and dominated by Castiel. He hasn't been given anything he can't handle yet and he's grateful. "You're hurting me-" he plays along because his dick is hard once again.
"Don't wanna-" he says from where he was laying on the couch and sucking his thumb even though he was eleven- it was a comfort thing.
Once at the fast food restaurant, Castiel orders while Dean takes a seat at a booth near the back. He looks over at the boy every now and then while he waits in line to order to make sure he doesn't run off somewhere. Just by the look on his serious little face, something was definitely wrong with him. If he wasn't sick, what other problem could he have? He's only eleven. Once he's ordered and has their food, he joins the boy at the booth.
Castiel groans, chest heaving and Dean rests his forehead against his shoulder as they both try to catch their breath. "That what you had in mind?" he asks eventually, his fingers carding lazily through the the teens short hair.
good. When his orgasm starts building low in his stomach, he pushes down his boxers to his knees so he can really work himself over.
John crouches down in front of his son, opening his arms so he could give him a hug and it surprised them both since he was not the hugging type, but Dean ran into his arms anyway. He almost felt betrayed by that, but the boy didn't know his father like he did. Unless he actually did, he didn't know for sure.
Bobby laughs, "You fell asleep, nothin' wrong with that- not like you were doin' anything." he stirs the eggs in the large pan. "Still comin' down-" he then sighs. "-won't be able to get any work done, it's flooded out there-"
"Gonna cum-" John's body stiffens as he unloads everything he's got inside of the younger man. It's not long before he pulls out and removes his hand from his mouth.
"Is it the hotel?" Dean nods, "I know it's unfamiliar but it's nice, isn't it?" Dean nods again. "Why don't you get in baby, I'll come join you in a minute-" Dean gets into the large tub and leans back against it, enjoying the warmth of the water on his skin.
"Maybe if you just kissed her, I could forgive you but you had to friggin' fuck her! Cas, for fucks sake-" he groans in despair, "Your dick probably has female gunk all over it now- Ugh!" he kicks at an old tree stump with his boot in anger. "This is fuckin' bullshit-"
The dark haired boy was sitting on the edge of the bathtub, wiping his eyes to pretend he hadn't been crying. "Go away."
"Dean." Castiel is at the table with a cup of coffee, looking  like he hadn't gone to bed at all. He
That night Castiel shares the bed with Dean and doesn't let him out of his grasp. "I'm sorry, Dean. I saw that hickey on your neck- I thought you cheated on me again." he sounds insecure.
Dean laughs bitterly, "I'm not your fucking boy- you made my life hell. You stupid son of a bitch, I should kill you right now!" the rifle is aimed at his biological fathers head.
"Yes?? What the fuck." Castiel opened his mouth but closed it before he would say something he would regret.
Their eyes meet, both of them are teary eyed and that's when Bobby walks in with the box that contained a few items for the vehicle they were working on. "Dean? You alright boy?" and he looks completely ready to come to his nephews aid if needed.
By the time they had unloaded the tree from the top of the car, some hot chocolate was well deserved. Though Dean got teary eyed after a while because his father didn't go tree hunting with them and Castiel gave him a kiss on the cheek in exchange for a cute smile.
"-when I'm ready, can I tell you everything?" he doesn't understand, "-everything that happened with him. I tried to tell you when he left but you didn't wanna hear it-"
Bobby takes a step back, "I never once seen a cat round' here-" the teen shrugs, making kissy noises at the thing. "Guess ya really want it-" he notices the box on the floor by his feet.
"Like you said, Cas. She's a good girl and good girls don't give it up until their wedding night." Castiel gulps and looks into Dean's eyes, "I'll just fuck her senseless then, right?"
"Don't wanna wear a suit-" he whines and starts stomping on a family of ants that crawl by with his boot.
“What?” Dean rasped, blinking away the sweat that was falling into his eyes  down from his forehead. “Cas I-.” He couldn't finish his sentence, deciding to ignore what was said and keep up the painfully slow and deep pace of his thrusts.
"Oh my-fuck." Castiel huffs out a harsh breath, "I-I can't even-" he pulls the boy up by his arms and kisses his forehead- the only inch on his face not covered in white. "You're so good for me."
The teen carefully gets out of bed for a shower since what else was there to do at this ungodly hour. The shower was nice, water felt warm hitting his skin which helped him relax a little. Maybe he'd be able to get some sleep now that he was
Dean worries his lip anxiously, "Yea, okay-" and steps inside the home- the screen door bumping painfully into his hip on the way in. Once inside the privacy of the kitchen, he lifts his shirt to see his midsection, noticing the bones on his body sticking out the slightest bit. Like they did
"I'm hungry-" he says quietly, which grabs the attention of the older man who hadn't noticed him walk in until just then. Castiel doesn't say anything, just moves away so the boy can do his thing. Dean looks at him every once in a while as he makes himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a single slice of bread. The guy looked drunk so he comments on it. "Are you drunk?"
"Hello, Dean." he smiles, giving the boy a small wave before meeting John's eyes in the kitchen, who nods. "Yeah, guess I am."
"There's plenty, Dean." Castiel says, wiping his hands and mouth on a napkin. He's had two slices himself. No way in hell was Dean going to eat more than a grown man. Sam's only had one slice himself, but to be fair he had also made popcorn and he'd been munching on that too.
One of his neighbors walks by with her dog, she sees him smoking and he can see her shaking her head ever so slightly.
The teen sucks on his finger until it's wet with saliva and his hand goes down between his legs, it's uncomfortable. He can't reach so he does what he always did when he was fucked by his step dad, he bent himself in half and held his legs up and spread apart. His wet finger probes around his hole and he flinches, sucking in a breath. He's rubbing his role, until he begins to press against the sensitive button and it pops in. Just the tip- but it feels nice. There's no pain. Dean starts to jack himself off with one hand while his finger is in his ass. He doesn't dare use more of his finger than just the tip- but the burn- the pressure of it, is still amazing.
"Mornin' Bobby-" he mumbles when he hears the heavy footsteps of his uncle approaching. "Hungry?" Dean just about cracked a whole carton of eggs into a large sizzling frying pan. "Made plenty so bring your appetite." he turns around and brings the still popping pan up to Bobby's face and serves him on a plate.
"I didn't mean what I said last night- I was mad at myself, I could've killed him." Dean stays at the doorway in case he's told to go away. "I'm sorry-"
and he's going to hell again for even thinking that. He slips out of the house for work before they wake up because he can't stand to face either of them yet.
Castiel smiles, knowing he had a pretty large cookie less than two hours ago. "That's alright-" he stands up, clearing the table and wraps Johns burger in foil for him to have when he pleases. "Why don't you go take a shower, you have school tomorrow." Dean nods before he goes to do what he's told- the kid was pretty compliant, never gave him any trouble at all.
A nurse writes down his weight and height, then takes his blood pressure on his good arm before a doctor comes in.  The doctor asks how he hurt his arm and what had be been doing beforehand. He hadn't wanted to order an x-ray since it would only add to the hospital bill, so a cast was in order since his arm didn't appear to be broken.
"Yea, I heard. It's all over the news. So what, am I under lock down?" he lays back again, "I'd rather be stuck at home."
Dean quickly moves to get himself and spider man under the covers next to Castiel who finds the new closeness uncomfortable but
Once at the house, Dean goes up to his bedroom to rest and Castiel sits at the kitchen table on his laptop. It's not until he realizes it's been a hours and he hasn't heard a peep from Dean, he gets up and goes to check on him. "Dea-" he stops, Dean's crying completely audible from the hallway.
The man tried to resist. "Well I'm 26 and your parent's would kill me if I showed you." he hoped that would end this conversation. If only he would be that lucky.
"Awesome-" he says sarcastically. "-so we'll be married and I'll be stuck at home taking care of your love child while you're working all day-"
"Open your mouth-" Derek instructs when he refuses to open wide for the dentist, the guy's large hairy hand is on his shoulder so he opens up. As soon as the needle goes into his gums- he begins to whimper uncontrollably. Again everyone ignores him until tears start streaming down his face, no one noticed or they pretended not to notice until Derek speaks up. "Heyy-" he talks softly next to his hear. "You're okay, the worst part is over-"
Dean closes his eyes, scrunching up his nose at the sensation of his father touching him so roughly. He really didn't like being grabbed this way, though he didn't know this was wrong so he never told anyone. Not a teacher, not Sam and definitely not Castiel. Now with his mother gone, his fathers evening cuddles had become a lot more hands on and more frequent. "Mom-" he whines.
Not long into the storm the electricity had gone out and Dean walks into the living room and finds his step dad there, looking down at his phone. He plops down heavily on the couch. "I was on the computer before the power went out, couldn't sleep."
Dean's eyes widen before looking down, seeing that he was nearly done with his lunch anyway so he thinks it's okay to leave and quickly goes to his bedroom. Castiel sighs loudly before getting up and clearing the table, putting the dishes in the sink and stuffing the boys school work in his backpack so he doesn't forget it on Monday when he's got that big test.
They must have watched a few hours of television before John's patting him on the thigh, "Let's go to bed-" and Castiel has no choice but to let himself be guided to their bedroom for whatever hell awaits him behind a locked door.
Sam nods before perking up in his seat, "Anyway- " there's a big smile on his face now because he's excited. "You're not gonna believe it but I got into all AP classes this year-"
The program was great, but he never felt comfortable anywhere and it's part of the reason why he likes helping his uncle. It's like working from home because it's safe there and it's comfortable, most of all he's around
They're exiting the movie theatre when someone calls out the mechanics name. They both turn around instantly and John notices one of his buddies from the shop, he's instantly grateful to not be holding the doctors hand. Now he can pretend he was just out with his buddy.
Dean nods, "Yea-" he grabs way too many of paper towels to dry his hands off with, then his face. "Nothing matters anyway- if I get arrested, whatever-"
Dean shrugs and continues, like he's been wanting to get things off his chest for a long time. "I would beg to go home when I was in school- I wanted my mom so bad, all the time. She'd come get me but I never felt better. I never felt like my parents were my parents-" He wipes the tear that just fell, "I made up a story in my head about my real parents, that maybe one day they'd come get me but they never did so I gave up on that. I was friggin' miserable Cas-"
Castiel didn't have to look at the boy to know that those laser green eyes were on him constantly. "What-" he says in a very annoyed tone of voice. It's not the kids fault, it's his for even letting himself get carried away on a freaking daydream that something could happen between them.
Castiel did manage to get a glimpse of his throat, "You're fine-" smiles. "How about some ice cream?" of course he had to mention the promised treat.
"Need help studying?" Castiel asks the boy who was sitting on his uncles recliner on the porch. Dean ignores him or maybe didn't hear him- his eyes were glued to the wooden fence. The day had been a dark one with storm clouds hovering above and the wind was a slight hot breeze. "Dean?"
The next time he sees him, he looks more aware of what's going on around him and that brings along some peace. Castiel smiles at him faintly when he sits back down, even takes his hand to hold onto.
Although Castiel cut ties with him suddenly 2 months ago and ran out of him, he did want to give things a try. It would take a good long while before he could trust him with his heart. For now he just wanted to take care of Castiel and show him the good things in life. Maybe buy him a new car or pay for him to live in an apartment. He loved the idea of Castiel living with him but knew it was a bad idea. Especially so soon.
Dean giggles, "That tickles, Cas-" he squirms under the heavier man that now pins him against the warm sand- "Cas-" he sighs then, his warm lips kiss at his neck and it feels amazing to him. "Ugh-I like that-"
Dean stops biting his nails to look over at him, bitch face disappearing instantly to be replaced with a softer look. "I didn't wanna leave, alright-" his words sound tight and squeaky, like he might cry at any point. "Why can't we just be ourselves and stop friggin' hiding-" his boot kicks the dashboard in front of him gently but it was still enough to get a hard glare from his stepfather. "Sorry-"
Dean hiccups cutely, shaking his head. "I was thinking about you-" another pretty hiccup, hands reaching down to tug his shirt over his knees as if to hide a certain
and so is Dean. He knows because his breath is hitching in his throat and he's whimpering softly like he's always done when hes going to come. "Look at me-" and he does, green eyes look down into the blue abyss in his. "Tell me you love me."
Castiel looks pensive for a moment, "You're right. We should do this more often-you know what, every few months- we'll come visit."
There they are, both his father and baby brother, Sammy. They're waiting for him at a table and he quickly rushes over to sit down in front of them. "Thank God-" he huffs in relief, all he wants to do is cry to them about how bad he wants to go home. His eyes land on his brother, "How you doin' Sammy?" but decides against breaking down since it'll be much harder to pull himself back together when they get to leave and he stays behind.
Dean was already dressed in something comfortable but warm so they head out instantly and he sleeps the entire ride to the hospital. When they finally arrive, Castiel guides Dean into the large building and into an empty ER room.
They have so much talking to do, about their future and what's going to come next for them. Of course he's aware that his love is younger and may not want kids right now and he would never pressure him for anything. Even so, discussions must be had and they need to happen soon.
Dean almost wants to laugh, but he's made peace with his father's death already since he's not seeing or hearing anything anymore.
Dean lifted his hips a little to pull the sheets from under him, still covering his front. "You promise you won't tell?" he looked him in the eye.
He gives up and decides that he's just being ridiculous- he did not die in his sleep. He's alive, he has to be and he's fine. Castiel sits down on the couch and turns on the television, nothing but static appeared on the screen. "The hell-" he sighs, shutting it off because the sound of white noise was too much right then. His eyes look around the living room in boredom until he realizes his computer surely works.
"Ugh-" Dean moans as he tries to ride Castiel's cock, it's somehow been freed by one or the other- Sam kisses his neck and shoulders while Dean eases down on the girth that is his step father. "So fucking big-"
Dean takes the mans hand and sits down, practically on his lap and Castiel wraps his arms around him to keep him safe and warm. "Fuck-" he curses softly, eyes closing. "I love this-" and looks over his shoulder at the man he loves who is snuggling him from behind. "I love
Dean was in a terrible mood because his uncle was in the hospital and has been for a few days now, not only that, but Castiel wasn't around much. Derek wasn't around either but why does he even care about him.
"I mean, what did you think I did all day?" there's a pause. "Here, I help Bobby and there's stuff to do but back home- Jesus, Cas. I was dying before your eyes and you didn't even notice."
More often than not, Castiel’s downtime between donors during those few hours is spent talking with Dean. It’s not a lot of time, but there’s a perverse amusement in watching Dean manually prevent himself from talking with his hands.
Nodding, Castiel enters in that answer along with all the rest. Finally, they’re back to blood pressure.
Still, knowing better than to pile back on the tension before a shoot, Dean drops the subject and acts like he accepts the non-answer. He checks himself over a little more, but really, he’s good to go. Alphas don’t take much prepping, even a cockslut alpha. As long as he passably smells like an omega, albeit one who was 3D-printed, he’s ready.
While Dean steadies himself, Castiel loosens his grip. His arms drift lower to Dean’s waist, the better to guide his center of gravity. And Dean stares at him, silhouetted by the motel lights. Beyond Dean, the gap in the window blinds has vanished.
After the ice, the lube doesn’t come close to feeling chilly, even without Castiel warming it. Castiel pushes more and more inside him, punctuating some with an ice cube, wriggling in more with a warm finger. Dean pushes back with trembling thighs and controlled breathing. He circles his ass, working Castiel’s finger, then fingers, increasingly toward his sweet spot.
The dumbest grin takes over his face as he pets those layers. His ass, he knows is in good condition; Cas has repeatedly sworn to as much. But his
“You’ve told me so much about it,” Castiel continues, steering Dean toward the Honda, and Dean makes the gasping noise of a man dying at a comedy club.
While they’re in line for Jack to sit on Santa’s lap, both Castiel and Kelly are running low on stories of generosity. Castiel starts giving examples of his regular donors, the ones whose regularity has become a touchstone in Castiel’s life.
Castiel has had a few months of considering loss, and the chains of events that can come from loss. It’s more practical than maudlin, but people tend to misunderstand if he tries to talk about it. Every Friday, he still thinks about Dean, and he hopes Dean is all right, despite whatever may have befallen his grandfather.
Dean rides the shaking giggling mass that is his mate, until he’s laughing too, until they’re cracking up together. They wheeze and giggle, set each other off, and repeat the whole thing at least twice more. It takes Dean half a minute after all that to realize the ref hasn’t checked them because Michael and Adam decoupled out of sheer confusion.
Castiel learns of this in his post in a border town. The letter comes from King Michael himself, and commands Castiel to prepare to return to the capital within the month. With the war at a standstill, Castiel must train for the inevitable tournament to win his omega. Such is the Winchester way.
dumbass,” Dean shoots back. “I’ve got an equal opportunity ass, that doesn’t mean omegas don’t do it for me too.”
Dean offers him the tether of the tie, and Castiel threads it back between his legs again, looking at Dean for a nod of approval. With his other hand, Castiel starts on his belt but stops when Dean shakes his head.
Running through the at times excruciatingly familiar steps of getting donor from reception to needle stick, Castiel lets the back of his mind race. Going out for drinks sounds like a date. Going out for coffee sounds like a date. A movie is definitely a date. Watch a sports game? What if his lack of knowledge bores Dean? All of his knowledge comes from Jack, and Jack’s games.
“Should I call you ‘Jimmy’?” Dean asks, not that he’s expecting a real name. Jimmy Angel has a reputation of inscrutability.
“Before I put the labels on, once more: name and date of birth?” As he asks, Castiel pulls on a fresh pair of gloves.
Castiel hooks his foot beneath the spearman’s fallen weapon and kicks it at Ava while backing away. A minor distraction, but an opening enough for Balthazar to fill. Where Ava falls, Gordon steps in close, slamming into Balthazar, the pair grappling.
“I can see that,” Castiel says, inspecting his abused tie. Putting the sex towel down first, he rolls Dean back over, taking care to turn him in the direction that loosens the twisted binding on Dean’s wrists. That done, Castiel runs one proprietary hand down Dean’s arms, across his chest. Down his stomach. Through his pubes.
Castiel quirks a tiny, somewhat pained smile. “Most of my family wouldn’t attach their circulatory system to a machine for hours on my behalf.”
Holding back a laugh at the sight of him so desperate, he quickly lubed up his erection, loving the feel of the cold liquid against his warm length. He then gripped Dean's hipped and pushed forward, breaching the ring of muscles. Dean released a gasp and shifted, breathing heavily. Cas could feel the warmth of him and then remembered to ease Dean just a little. He reached out his grace and felt Dean immediately relax at the sensation.
Sam was frowning as he looked over Dean's shoulder at the closed door. Dean folded his arms across his chest, not really wanting to get into it all just yet, but knew it was coming. His heart sunk in his chest as Sam locked eyes with him, clear concern outweighing the frustration he had been feeling.
Dean swung his gaze to the rear view mirror and caught Cas's blue eyes with his own. He hadn't been expecting Cas to be watching him and it instantly threw him off. Those blue eyes held so much anger within them and he knew it had nothing to do with those pesky feelings the guy had. He was still angry at being outnumbered.
Sam didn't wait for a reply. Instead he brushed past Cas and out of the kitchen. He thought about shouting to him about the food, but thought better of it. He needed to discuss things with Dean. Needed to understand exactly what he wants, especially before he makes his final decision. He knew he was going to say goodbye, but if Dean really was done with running and he loved Cas as much as Sam was proposing, then he'd be stupid to let that go.
His eyes are forced shut and so is his mouth. When they open again he can see clearly, can still feel the pain in his chest, but its too dull to care about it. Then he pushes the limp body of the girl off him. He sits up, but it doesn't seem like he's sitting up, it feels like someone else. Then he's standing and he can't remember moving. He wants to fight the demons that are now staring at him, want to charge them. He's free and he's got his weapon in his sock. But when he tries to make his limbs work, they don't obey and realisation comes to him. He's possessed by this Christie bitch if that's her real name.
Realisation hit him full force. It had taken everything in the angel to tell Dean he couldn't go there. But why? Why would he cause them both unnecessary pain like that? At the time he hadn't wanted to know the reason, at the time he was too consumed with his own anguish, he was too concerned with getting the hell out of dodge, not wanting Cas to see him break down.
Dean waited for the answer. In his mind he could see Cas frowning, contemplating the question. “He… he promised he wouldn't run. So… it...”
Dean nodded his acceptance and waited. Castiel couldn't look him in the eye, couldn't bring himself to. He knew what he'd see there, fear of what was going to be said. He took in a deep breath, bracing himself for the answer that would surely follow. “Did you mean it?”
Cas's confusion cleared and a small, shy smile graced his lips as understanding clouded over his eyes. “Yes. I do. And that makes you happy?”
“I-” Dean licked his lips, sending a jolt of arousal through Castiel, making him tighten his grip on those wrists that he still had pinned to the wall. It was a nervous gesture that Dean was displaying. The fact that he had no idea what that tiny action had done to Castiel just made that arousal grow. He held back though. He couldn't lose control. Not now. “I could never hate you, Cas.” His voice was breathy and it made Castiel's heart flutter.
Sam did the same as Cas, thumbing through the pages, until he came to a stop. The book lay open flat as his brother's eyes scanned the page. “Cas?” Sam whispered, looking up to him with something that looked like pure horror.
He was now an inch away, feeling the other man's breath on his skin, feeling the warmth of it. He placed a hand on Dean's face, he heard the sharp intake of breath, could see his wide eyes and his parted lips. He wanted to kiss him so bad, but he had something to say first. He searched Dean's face for any sign of resistance and when he found none, he whispered, “Just so we're clear, I will always want you. Nothing, and I mean nothing will ever change that. Do you understand?”
Dean's smile dropped for a second. A small, petty part of Castiel mentally punched the air in triumph. “Because that's what all dick's do, Cas, they lie.” Dean looked all smug after that. Castiel couldn't take it any more. The anger he felt for Dean in that moment was unlike anything he'd ever felt before. The unwelcome urge to punch him again crossed his mind. “Shall we go then?”
He shoved past his brother and moved down the corridor. A small twinge of satisfaction shot through him at the sight of his brothers shocked expression. He could hear his brother hurrying behind him, trying to keep up. Dean found that amusing considering he was a lot taller than him and should have no trouble taking longer strides to stay on par with him. “Don't you want to know where we're heading?”
A small determination pushed its way through and his eyes hardened. He moved to the bathroom door, unlocking it. His brother looked up at him, his brow furrowed in concern. Dean ignored him, the determination still twisting in his gut. He grabbed his jacket of the back of the vacant motel chair and pulled it on. He grabbed his keys. Without looking at his brother, he mumbled a 'I'm going out' and left.
Inch by inch Dean pushed his throbbing cock inside until finally he was completely sheathed inside of his gaping hole. For a moment there was no movement and Castiel allowed his thoughts to wonder again. He wanted to turn around, wanted to gaze upon Dean as he was overcome by pleasure. He wanted to show Dean that he was head over heels in love with him, that he was doing this for him.
“I came to realise, Dean, that if I killed you, right here, right now, Castiel would be lost to us. Its better this way. Its better to everyone, humans and angels alike, if you all die.”
His eyes caught sight of a woman. She was drinking alone. Her eyes searching. His own eyes roamed up and down her body. Her jeans clung to her slim legs, her red, strappy top pushed her breasts up. Dean's breath hitched as he watched her small fingers push her straight blonde hair behind her ear.
The look on Castiel's face is a broken one, "-the guy sent me to the ER once." and shakes his head as he flicks the tab on the mouth of his beer can. "Still, I never left him-"
"Stop staring at me." he says after a few minutes. "There's pasta on the stove." he gestures to the kitchen "If you're hungry."
Dean lay in bed awake in bed while Castiel slept peacefully next to him. His face was angelic and soft. He smiled. That night he made loved to this young man for the first time, sex wasn’t usually a big deal for the 36 year old before. But now… things felt different.  He liked Castiel very much and didn’t want to ruin it.
"He's my uncle-" Dean says, "-he calls me every few days to check on me." Castiel nods, listening to the boy explain. "He has a beard."
Dean closed the gap between them and pulled the younger man onto his lap, one hand reaching around to grope his ass. The steering wheel digging into Castiel’s back, he gasped. Every time Dean ground up against the cock that was straining his jeans the steering wheel made another jab into his lower back. It wasn’t unpleasant.
He's been home a few hours and Castiel gets in before his dad does, as usual. Castiel comes by to his room to check on him- also, as usual. "Hello, Dean." he smiles until his eyes crinkle in that friendly way his blue eyes always did- he leans against the door frame.
Dean hands his friend a stick, he has one too and reaches to poke the cats stomach. Sam noticed how he only cared to poke her in the stomach, and also noticed how his friend was almost as skinny as he was. "What do you think she ate?"
Eventually Castiel's hand makes it's way to his thigh, squeezing and stroking him. "Cas-" he peeks up through his lashes. "What are you doing-" the large hand on his lap finds  his hand, their fingers hooking between each others. "Cas-" lashes flutter against his will because this was feeling a lot like a real date, not that he's ever even had one of those before.
After he investigates each room in the house, he's now regretting having rented the large old home and is fondly missing living at Bobby's, because there's strength in numbers, three under one roof is better than one. Once he's sure the coast is clear he locks up the front door, back door and double checks that all the windows are closed. He didn't consider what Dean had said earlier, he'd already forgotten about that in his haste to finish his meal.
Sam and Castiel sit, they're already chowing down and Dean hasn't started yet. He's so into the movie, "That guy kinda looks like you, Sam." he points to the screen, at the guy looking for his sister.
"Yes baby-" the sound of his balls slapping the teens plump ass was loud in the quiet room, "-what do you wanna tell daddy-"
"Really?" Dean looks into his blue eyes, he won't admit it but it got him a little emotional. Castiel nods, "Can't live without you either, Cas."
Dean scoffs in disbelief at how cold he can be sometimes, "It's not drama, Cas. It's her friggin life were talking about here, she just wants my support-" there's a moment of silence. "Poor girl, must be scared to death right now-"
He can't ignore the pleading eyes so he continues, "They have this heat down there, it's so warm...and wet-" Dean gulps, "And it opens up for you like a little flower, it's so pink in there." Dean blushes, "And when she comes, it's different than with a guy. It's more of an, internal orgasm type of thing that happens."
Bobby took Dean to the diner for breakfast before his therapy appointment and the boy does nothing but sulk and pout in the truck the whole way. Can't
Tommy is just as amazed by this man now as he was when he was sixteen years old. "I-" he's visibly trembling, on the verge of tears. Regardless if he was now an adult and going to college part time when he wasn't working at the library in town, it's as if being in the presence of this man brings him back to his childhood. "Jimmy-"
After a few minutes he felt his breathing even out, felt his heart slow down and he felt a little calmer. He peaked a glance at Dean and reeled back in shock, letting his hair go. Dean was sat crossed legged in front of him, concern etched upon his face and Cas had to gulp past the lump again. He didn't want pity, not from him. He wanted him to need him, to understand what he was trying to say, what he needed. He took in a shaky breath. “I'm sorry,” he whispered. The shame was starting to build up as the realisation of what he'd done crept into his mind.
Why hadn't he done this to begin with? Why hadn't he given Cas the comfort he needed. Slow realisation came to him. This is what he needed. He needed this comfort. The comfort that his brother couldn't give him. He in turn buried his face into Cas's neck. He deeply inhaled the smell that was just Cas, and this alone was enough to comfort him. A few tears escaped as the pain that had been clawing at his insides slowly eased off. Yes, this was what he needed.
Castiel sucked in a sharp breath. The hope sprang forth again and he tried desperately to push it down. He can't hope again. Never again. “You do have feelings for me?” he whispered, needing to clarify that he was on the same page. He closed the distance once again between them, their eyes staying connected. Castiel felt his heart jump at the closeness. He should back off, should protect himself, but the pull was to strong. He needed to be close to him. Needed to be near him.
That's exactly what he did before he could talk himself out of it. He landed in the same room Dean had kissed him, his eyes instantly fixated on the wall where he'd been pinned against. The room was eerily quiet and it sent a shiver down his spine. He gazed around the room with his blue eyes and they caught sight of Dean. Still on the floor where he'd been thrown to moments ago. Breathing hard. Tears rolling past his closed lids and down his flushed cheeks.
“I can't live without you, Cas. There's no two ways about it. When I said I was done running, I meant it. I love you. I love you so much that it physically hurts. I need you and I need to try and make this work. Not just for me or just for you, but for us. I need there to be an us.”
Words were exchanged. Then his mother was there. Then she wasn't. It all happened so fast. The tear closed itself, with Mary and Lucifer on the other side. His mother was gone. Cas was gone. Sam was the only constant thing left. But it wasn't enough.
“I-” Dean's eyes darted from side to side. That was it, that was the end of Castiel's heart as he knew it. Dean didn't know what to say, he didn't know if he wanted this. Castiel, not once, thought those words were true. When he'd called him a coward it was just a way to get Dean to hurt just as much as he did. It was petty, he knew that, even more so when he said that Dean didn't want this. He thought he did, especially after last night.
The deep throated scream startled Naomi. She hesitated, tearing her eyes away from Cas, darting them towards him, her eyes glinting mischievously. His feet were glued to the concrete floor. He knew he should move, to try and stop her. But he couldn't. Frozen in fear. This is what this feeling was. Fear. He'd felt fear before, of course he has. The many times he'd lost Sam, or about to lose him. The many times he'd almost died himself. The many times he'd witnessed his nightmares. The many times he'd lost Cas, or almost lost him. But this time was different. He was in love with him. If he lost Cas now, he would lose himself too.
But Dean did what Dean always does. He pushes people away out of fear. Fear. Of course he was fucking terrified, he was terrified that Cas didn't love him any more, that he didn't really miss him. He was terrified that Cas would leave again. He was so fucking scared of getting his heart broken again. The walls he'd spent years building had crumbled, and it had only taken a few minuets. Now he could feel them slowly rising again.
“Cas is right, Dean.” Sam's voice echoed from across the room, where he was stood with his arms crossed, eyes narrowing in on them. He'd stayed silent up until that moment.
The anger is burning through him now like a hot poker. He doesn't care about that. Not at the moment. He needs this to get personal. Slowly he starts to move towards the angel, but stops immediately when Cas takes a step back. The realisation hits him full force, the anger dimming a little bit, but still prominent. Cas doesn't want to be near him. “I called for you.”
He felt a hand grip his shoulder, the heat surged through his t-shirt and onto his sensitive skin. He gasped at the contact and slowly turned to face his angel, who had his head tilted, confusion now evident in those eyes.
Dean swiped at his tears, trying to form his thoughts into words. He hated anything remotely to do with expressing his emotions. He needed to do this for Cas, Cas needed this from him. “I can't feel this way any more.” He stood and slowly moved across the room, afraid that Cas would disappear on him again. He once again wrapped his arms around the angel, pressing his chest against his back and leant his forehead into his shoulder blades. He felt Cas stiffen with tension but he didn't move away. Small mercies. “I've missed you, so damn much,” he whispered.
He got into the front seat of the Impala and waited for Dean to return. He finally emerged twenty minutes after Cas left. What had taken him so long? He faced out of the side window, refusing to look the hunter in the eyes. He could feel the concern pouring off him, but he refused to give in to him. Refused to show him just how much his words pierced his heart.
With his heart in his throat, he watches from the outlines as Cas contemplates his request, his blue eyes searching his face as though he is trying to figure out a very difficult problem. The silence stretches on and it takes everything in Dean not to push more. Cas needs his patience right now, not some miss-guided anger.
He allowed his thoughts to roam to Sam and Jack and he wondered what the younger Winchester was telling the kid, wondered how he was explaining this. But right now he couldn't go to him, couldn't make Jack understand. Dean needed his full attention and that's what he would get.
“We need to get Sam to the car.” He couldn't have this conversation, not now, not ever. It wasn't going to happen. He couldn't hear Cas shoot him down. Fear pushed him to continue. “Need your help, Cas. Can't move him on my own.” He started to lift Sam's top end, gripping him under the armpits, but when there was no sign of Cas helping, he looked up at him. Dean's breath was caught in his throat. Cas's eyes had darkened, anger swirling within them, making them a darker blue.
He searched three bars and no sign of Dean. On the fourth bar all urgency and concern had left him as his eyes caught sight of Dean. He had a girl pinned against the wall, kissing her deeply and hungrily. The pain shot through Castiel like an iron fist. He could feel his heart shattering into a million pieces. He knew Dean would never want him. He knew that even with Dean knowing about his feelings that this didn't change anything. But knowing it and seeing it were two very different things. This pain was different to all the others he'd felt since his revelation, this was a type of heart break that had him rooted to the spot, that had him want to scream and run and hide all at the same time. This was the type of heart break that made him want to punch something just to get that relief from the torture. This was the kind of heart break that he didn't know he could come back from.
“You don't have to, Cas.” His voice is also broken. Pain filled. Cas's eyes narrow, the pain still evident.
Another hour later, with his searches bringing up nothing, he sends Cas out to scout the town in his beaten up truck. Cas doesn't argue, of course, just leaves with a silent nod and for the first time since his arrival, Dean can feel himself breathing easier. Sometimes the compulsion to reach out and touch him in some intimate way would become so strong that he would find it difficult at times to refuse it.
Cas closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. When he opened them again, all his suffering was evident and still Dean chose to ignore it.  “I betrayed you, Dean. I thought you'd hate me. I thought-”
Cas went to pull away but Dean gripped tighter, not wanting to let him go. The panic was filling him again. What if this was the last time they ever saw each other. He cursed himself for being so silly and clingy. He's never had a problem letting Cas go off into battle before, so what's so different this time? Because you're in love with him, an annoying little voice piped up. Yeah, he was but that wasn't the only reason. They've barely gotten started and he couldn't lose him now, not when they were so close to being what they both wanted to be.
Dean smiled then. A brightening up the room smile and Cas couldn't help but smile as well. They were really going to do this. But a new nervousness swept through him. It had been too long since they had done anything, since they had been together, it had been months before he had died. Would they still remember how to be with each other?
He blinked back the tears. He couldn't think about this any more. He looked at the man in the hospital bed. The man he loved with all his heart. It didn't matter if Dean didn't love him back. He didn't care about any of that any more. He just needed him to open his eyes. He just needed to see those green orbs. He would give up everything and anything for that.
How the hell was he going to look at Cas the same? This was different now. This wasn't thinking about Cas and what Cas wanted to do to him. He knew Cas wanted him in every way possible. But Dean had been the one to imagine it. It shouldn't be like this. He shouldn't feel this way.
He stumbled backwards as Cas started pushing him further towards the bed. He'd expected the panic to set in again, like last time, but it never came. He was enjoying this too much. He was enjoying the feel of Cas caressing him with his mouth.
Cas's eyes widened slightly, mouth hanging open. Dean knew, in that moment, that Cas had no idea what had been going on in Dean's head when he was passed out. All the angel could do was nod his acceptance.
Unable to hold his rage back, he punched the tiled wall. Pain shot up his arm and the sound of bones cracking echoed through the bathroom. He bit his bottom lip as tears sprung to his eyes. Shit. He should not have done that. He most certainly had broken it. Another thought pressed forward. If Cas sees this, he's going to want to heal him. That means touching, that means closeness. Dean didn't know if he could handle that right now. At the moment he needed to be as far away as possible from him. But on the other hand, he couldn't not have Cas heal him. First it would raise suspicion in his brother which would ultimately lead to a chick flick moment. Secondly he kind of needed his hand if they were to go up against another angel.
The guy turns to the two alphas who will be taking him down—two to Dean’s one, the better to show off how hard Jimmy is to subdue—and asks, “Who’s mouth, who’s ass?”
His smile bright and pleased, Castiel again squeezes Dean through the coat. “You need me to hurt you.”
“Lie down with me,” Castiel says. He takes the matter out of Dean’s hands by simply lowering himself down, Dean still atop him. They both groan as their bodies separate just an inch too far. Dean fumbles down below, but to no avail.
“Sounds good. But won't it find a way to get around it?” Sam didn't seem as optimistic as Dean, in fact he seemed quite the opposite.
Dean couldn't help his eyes going wide with shock. He hated it here. He didn't want to be here. Dean slowly started to back away, his eyes filling with tears that threatened to spill. That drink he was thinking about having earlier didn't sound half bad now. He just wanted to forget. He wanted to run. But he promised. He'd made a promise and he needed to prove to Cas that he was willing to try, even if he hated being with him.
His eyes were still closed as a lone tear escaped. Castiel reached out with one hand and gently wiped it away. “Look at me, Dean.” It took Dean a few more moments and a couple of shallow breaths later, he finally opened his eyes. Castiel forced himself to remain calm as he looked at the concern written in those watery, green eyes. “I know you're worried. I am too. But this is something I have to do. Please. I need to know your okay with this.”
Dean sucked in a sharp breath, his eyes dropping to the floor. When he spoke it was barely a whisper and Castiel had to strain to hear it. “I feel things for you, Cas.” Castiel mentally cursed himself at the small twinge of hope that spiked. He shouldn't hope. There was a reason Dean was angry at himself and he knew Castiel wasn't going to like it. “I want you so badly that it hurts.” He locked eyes with him again, and the sadness there made that hope disintegrate, being replaced by his own sadness. “But…” And there it was, the dreaded but. Castiel forced himself to maintain the contact, made himself press harder into Dean. He needed to hear this. Dean sighed. “I don't want to hurt you.”
Forcing a smile, he knew what he had to do, what he had to say. “Of course.” It should have been that obvious. He'd said he would be there when he awoke, but he knew, deep down, that wasn't actually the case. There was a very high possibility of him flying off and not looking back. The deepened frown upon Dean's face showed just how much that was a possibility. As always, he saw right through his smile, right through his positive, confident answer. He tried to think of a way to elaborate, tried to think of a way to explain what he'd been thinking all night, but nothing came to mind, nothing that wouldn't upset the man before him.
Carefully, gently, he raised Dean off his cock and he felt it slip wetly from the heat, could feel his own release seep out, dripping onto him, but he paid it no mind. Dean moved willingly, landing with a soft thump onto the mattress, pulling Castiel with him. Both of them led on their sides, facing each other, breathing heavy, legs intertwined, hands linked between their sweaty bodies. Dean reached up with his free hand and brushed away Cas's sweaty hair from his forehead. He watched with fascination as Dean looked upon him with so much adoration it took his breath away. He had never seen such a look upon his face before and it both frightened him and made him happy.
A tingle ran up and down his spine, goosebumps travelled across his flesh as he looked into those bright blue eyes. His cock twitched in his pants and a delicious feeling settled in the pit of his stomach.
Cas reeled back, breaking their contact, his eyes wide. “Dean… You don't have to. I know you're terrified of this.” He gestured between them.
“No. I was a shitty person. You deserve so much better than me, but… but I'm too selfish. I can't give you up.” Tears welled in his eyes as the truth poured past his lips. He placed a kiss on Cas's again, this time a short, sweet, loving one. Cas hummed.
The pain of leaving his best friend standing there, made his heart ache, made him want to scream. This is exactly what he was trying to avoid. This heart break. On both sides.
It had felt like forever since he'd first touched the break, but finally the car came to a stop. He could feel the tension in the car and he quickly remembered Cas. He looked over his shoulder and instantly calmed to see he was okay, confused, but okay. It was stupid really. Cas was an angel and a simple car crash wasn't going to hurt him, but he had to be sure. Then he glanced at his brother, to see an equally confused look on his face.
Nobody said anything, each casting their eyes across the job at hand. This was going to take too much time, time they didn't have. Shocking him, Cas released his hand, and Dean fought against the urge to chase after him as he made his way across the piles of books. He fisted his hands at his sides and took in a deep breath to calm himself down. He was being needy and he hated it. Never, in all his years of relationships, has he ever felt like this. Maybe it was because he'd thought Cas was dead and that grief was still pulling him down, drowning him. Or maybe it was because there was an imminent threat just up those stairs and behind the metal door. He shook his head, pushing those negative thoughts to the back of his mind. He would deal with this issue later, first they had to survive the night.
The man has wide eyes and Sam knows he's trying to think of something to get away. Its going to be no use though, she's too strong. What kind of demon isn't affected my holy water? In his line of work, with everything they've been through, he knows there are plenty out there. But still? He thought that she was just some lowly demon who'd gotten lucky by bagging a Winchester. Clearly not.
“I'm sorry, Dean.” Oh, so it was Cas who had decided to speak first. He should have expected an apology, all the guy does is apologise for something.
“Someone wanna tell me what's going on?” He sounded annoyed and frustrated. He was the smart one and he couldn't figure out what was going on.
“Everything okay?” he asked softly and Dean wanted to be sick with how much concern it held. Or was it pity? He didn't know and he really didn't care. He had enough guilt without Sam passing judgement on him as well, he was doing a good enough job of that himself. Dean shook his head, indicating it wasn't okay, but he didn't want to talk. But Sam continued as though he hadn't seen anything, and Dean had to hold in a frustrated groan. Will his brother ever listen? “Cas asleep?”
Cas cringed and ignored him, his mind drifting back to Dean and prayed to his absent father to keep him safe. That's all he needed, Dean back in one piece.
Understanding shot through him. Cas was protecting himself because he was afraid Dean was going to reject him. After everything that had happened he should reject him, he should tell him it was a little to late now. Their time had passed and they should just move on. But he couldn't. He still needed him, still loved him and after losing him… He couldn't push him away.
He didn't know how he was suppose to get past this. He didn't know how he was suppose to act around Dean any more. The best thing to do was to get rid of these feelings, another thing he didn't know how to do. He hated not knowing
“The hell it isn't, Cas.” Dean sensed the bubbling anger within his brother, the frustration turning poisonous.
He thought it would never end, thought he would keep going forever. Never had he felt something so strong. He finally slowed his hips as did Dean. He released his hand from Dean's softening erection, feeling the stickiness there but not caring in the slightest. His whole body hummed with satisfaction. He was still buried deep within Dean, could feel his hole clenching and unclenching. If he didn't move, he would become hard again.
“I – I don't care what your called.” His voice sounds funny, scratchy, but he doesn't break the fierceness that's in his eyes. He doesn't allow his weakness to show. He remembers the knife that's in his sock and decides to wait, wait for the opportune moment.
“Yes. Would it be okay if you made him something to eat?” Sam's eyebrows shot up into his hairline in shock.
The baby was close to being born now. Lucifer was going to find his son and claim him as his own if they didn't act fast. Sam was desperate, trying every trick he knew. But finally, after days of searching, finally they found them. They had found Cas. Dean drove with urgency, his foot pressed to the pedal, desperate to see him again, to make sure he was okay, as okay as he could be anyway. He hated himself for that, though. This wasn't about Cas, or him, or them. It was about saving the world from the most dangerous being that would have ever existed. He couldn't help it though. The worry wormed its way through, setting up home inside of him.
Dean was willing to try again, was willing to give him another chance. That should have made him happy, should have made him soar with joy. Could he promise this? He really thought about it, really and truly thought long and hard. The silence stretched between them and Dean waited patiently, knowing that Cas really needed to think about this because neither of them took promises lightly. He really needed to mean it if he was going to promise.
Castiel knew someone should break the silence and he desperately tried to think of something to say. “You should be resting.” He was quite pleased with himself at that statement. It stayed in the safe zone and it was the truth, he should be back in bed, sleeping if that was possible.
Cas hesitated, opened his mouth as though to protest and then dipped his head in resignation. Then he was gone. And Dean crumpled to the floor, unable to keep himself upright any longer.
“If you're not here to kill me, what are you here for?” Cas asked, his voice full of curiosity and confusion as he cocked his head and frowned. Dean almost burst out laughing at the sight, it was so familiar, so Cas, it didn't seem to belong there in that moment.
Dean should have been honest with his brother, with himself. He wasn't in any rush to have him back. Yes, he missed him. Yes, he wanted to feel him, touch him, kiss him. But the longer Cas stayed away, the more he had time to think, to regret it. No, he didn't regret what had happened, he just regretted the lead up to it. Shame filled him, guilt plagued him. He loved Cas with all of his being and somehow he felt he didn't deserve any kind of love in return. Cas was too pure, too loyal, too everything and Dean just didn't feel like he deserved anything from him.
“Really? Aren't you, like, scared of it?” He kept his voice soft and wary, unsure if he actually wanted the answer.
Cas opened his mouth a couple of times, unsure of what he should say, and if it had been any other situation, any other time, Dean would have laughed at the sight. He sucked in a sharp breath as Cas reached up and stroked the back of his hand down his cheek. It was such a loving gesture that Dean felt the urge to pull away, to recoil from it, his thoughts returning to their original factory settings – he didn't deserve this. He chose to stay, chose not to move as his heart rapidly pounded against his ribcage, bursting to break free.
“I haven't known for long. But it's always been there. In every memory of you, of us. It's there. Faint. But...” He shrugged, unsure as to how he should end that sentence. He was nervous now. Cas still didn't want this, did he? Course he wouldn't. Him loving him wouldn't change anything.
But these demons were smart. Cas wouldn't try anything, not as long as he was in danger. He glanced back at the demon hovering over him. She was crouched next to him now, her own knife point touching his throat. It was warm compared to his skin, but it sent another shiver down his throat. She was still looking at where Cas was and still with that damn smile.
Disappointment ran through him. He didn't want that, he needed to know now. The grief was still too raw, too real. Before Dean could even blink, Cas was pushing past him. Panic replaced the disappointment. He couldn't let him go yet, he couldn't go back to the real world, not without knowing.
He rounded the doorway and was startled by what he saw. His shock made the mug slip slightly in his grip, it made his blood freeze in his veins, it made his breathing cease, it made the colour drain from his face.
He reached up and gently stroked the back of his hand down the rough stubble on Cas's cheek. He was warm and a shock of electricity made him shiver. “You died, Cas. I stopped hating you. I just, I missed you so damn much. I hate that I still feel this way. I hate that I still fucking need you. But, God damn it, I really fucking do.”
The tie came lose and Dean threw it to the side not caring where it landed. Cas broke the kiss again and Dean's eyes dropped to the angel's red, swollen lips. God, he looked so sexy like that. Hair ruffled, lips parted slightly, lust in his eyes. Cas bent his head to the crook of Dean's neck and started sucking and biting. It was hard and it hurt slightly. But Dean didn't care. The act sent goosebumps travelling across his body, sending shivers up and down his spine. He groaned again, pleasure filling his voice. He fumbled with the buttons of Cas's white shirt, the desperate need still coursing through him. He could feel his heart speed up as Cas moved down over his collar bone.
He knew what he was offering, knew that he truly could make him forget. But did he want to? Would he be rid of this constant pain? And what about Cas? “What about you?”
He jumped up, ignoring how much his body hurt. He made a beeline for the large room and came to a halt at the sight before him. Sam was breathing heavily, hatred curling and twisting around him as he stared at… Naomi's body. Not Cas. It hadn't been Cas. His eyes caught sight of Cas's surprised eyes. He was alive. Relief and happiness filled him to the brim, pushing all thoughts and doubts and fears far from his mind.
He turned to leave, then collided with a solid form. Cas was stood before him, his eyes full of pain and love and so much more. Dean swallowed past the lump in his throat. He can't cry, not now, not in front of his brother and Cas. “Why?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You don't have to understand. You don't have to be okay with this.” Dean was getting angry again. Who was he angry with? Himself or Castiel? “I strung you along, made you think there could be something more.”
“That's not what I want!” Dean yelled, his face turning red from frustration. Castiel's eyes widened in shock. He hadn't expected that to be so easy.
Sam furrowed his brows in worry and looked at Castiel. Castiel just about managed to keep his face stony and impassive, not wanting to alert the younger Winchester of anything being wrong. Dean would most definitely not want Sam to find out about any of this. Dean returned a few minuets later, a key in his hand, Sam grabbed their bags and Castiel followed them both into their room.
“We have nothing left to say, Cas.” Dean sounded exhausted and Castiel felt that urge to go to him, to ease him, but he knew it wouldn't be welcome yet. Dean was tired of having the same argument, was tired of repeating himself, and now he was resigning himself to that fate. Castiel had never hated himself more than he did in this moment.
Cas glanced at him, his eyes nervous. Dean decided there and then that the best thing for both of them was to play dumb, to pretend he didn't have clue as to what Cas was talking about. There was no point in panicking, not until Cas gave him a bloody good reason to. “What isn't?” He kept his voice soft, hoping that he came across as curious and not scared shit less.
“Because I've ruined everything. I should have kept my mouth shut.” He watched as the shock left Dean, watched as understanding crossed his perfect features. He wasn't going to deny it, Castiel could see that, could see that he knew he was right. He allowed Dean to gather his thoughts. He watched as Dean's eyes drifted from his eyes, to his lips and back up again. Castiel would love nothing more than to give him what he wanted, but he couldn't. He couldn't go there again.
Immediately Dean pulled free, his cock slipping wetly from his hole, his grip from his hips gone. Castiel allowed himself a moment to think. Dean would be confused, he had agreed after all, he needed to think of what to say. But nothing came. All he could think about was this empty, numbing feeling in the depths of his chest. He was so deeply in love with him, and Dean didn't feel the same. The reality came crashing down around him. This was just another conquest to Dean. Just another willing body for him to pound till he lost all control. That was it. Nothing more. Castiel tried to stop the tears from flowing, but they wouldn't. They wouldn't go away. It was as if they were compensating for the emptiness he was feeling. He couldn't face Dean like this. But time had worn on for too long, and Castiel had no choice to face it, to face him.
Dean shot him a dirty look before staring down Cas again. He couldn't let Cas do this. If anything happened to him, he would never forgive himself for it. He wouldn't survive the pain. He knew that. But he needed Cas to understand too. He was painfully aware his brother was stood right there, but he couldn't care less at the moment, his main priority was to get Cas not to go on this suicide mission. “I understand, I really do, Cas, but...” He fell silent, his eyes softening. He took in a large gulp of air. How the hell was he going to express what he was thinking?
He was about to ask how he should proceed with that plan when the sound of a startled gasp behind him made him freeze, his blood running cold. He turned to find Dean, staring at him with wide eyes, no not just him, both of them. He heard Sam gulp, nervously. If Sam was nervous then maybe he should start to panic. Nobody said anything and the need to fill the silence became too strong to ignore. “Hello, Dean.”
While everyone reads and discusses every chapter, the teen sulks on the couch while sitting next to his step father. The whole ordeal must have lasted almost two hours before the women start yawning and Castiel calls it quits for the night.
Dean lays down finally, on his side. "Why are you in here?" blue eyes look up at him with the same angry look he'd gotten back in the cafeteria. "Sorry, never mind-"
Dean pulls away, his hands roaming the strong chest in front of his face due to the height difference. "You're so sexy, Cas-" he's looking up through wet lashes. "Like, so fucking sexy-"
Castiel swallows dryly- "Real heart breaker- aren't you?" Dean smiles, "Any more little girl friends I should know about?" When his eyes bore into his soul he caves.
"Good boy." Castiel rubs his fingers through Dean's hair- it makes him whimper. "I know you miss me-" Dean nods. "I miss you too-I know you want me to kiss you but you're-"
Castiel leans back on the couch and sighs. Bobby was paying attention to the news on the television and Dean just looked terrified, storms always frightened him ever since Castiel's known him. He leans over, "Don't be scared sweetie." he whispers and he nods, giving him an
Dean's still on his phone, looking through his phone when Castiel leans in again to kiss his neck. "What are you doin'- gotta go soon-" the man doesn't reply, just keeps kissing, eventually giving his neck a soft bite. Dean moans, "Ugh fuck-" he pushes Castiel back, "Seriously, don't start what you can't finish."
The teen notices the older mans blue eyes are focused on his lips so he licks them, "Yea-" his voice is so soft. Blue eyes look up to meet his, "-would I have been your type?" they both blink, not breaking eye contact and both of them completely oblivious to everyone around them chattering about. "Out there-"
"I don't like where this is gonna go-" she crosses her arms at her chest, looking up at him expectantly.
Dean rolls his eyes, wishing he could express himself better. "Yea, whatever-" the man leans close and asks him when they will talk about Gordon or his father because they haven't discussed it much. "Not yet-" he states softly, "I'm scared to-"
Dean and Bobby thought they were being haunted by John Winchester and they mentioned it to Pastor Jim when he stopped by for coffee- they were assured it was just in their heads, that grief makes people experience all sorts of things. Dean couldn't resist the urge to snort at the mans logic.
On Sunday, Dean finally calls him and he quickly picks up the phone while having breakfast. "Dean-" his tone of voice is overly loving because he's unable to keep it casual.
"Yea-" Dean whispers, they hadn't heard the thunder outside, or the rain since the volume on the television was too loud- so when the power went out, it scared Dean pretty terribly. "Cas!" he shouts even though the guy is right there.
"Fine, Ma'm. Jo around? She hasn't answered my calls-" he's aware he's being a bit possessive but he can't help it. He feels all primal towards her now that he's been inside her.
When Castiel sleeps in the next morning, Dean gets worried. He goes into the kitchen and makes the guy a bagel and some coffee. Castiels Go To breakfast. Balancing a small plate and a mug of coffee he knocks on the bedroom door. When there's no answer Dean opens the door to find Castiel awake, looking at the ceiling, "Hey." Castiel looks at him, he moves to sit up in bed. "I made you breakfast." he smiles, coming inside the room carefully. After he sets down the plate and mug on the nightstand he reaches into his pajama pockets and pulls out a small bottle. "Got you these."
Castiel bites his lip, "Keep going-" he's so fucking hard, even with the teens knee against his crotch. "You're doing so good-"
When Dean finally pads down the hall, he pauses and looks at Castiel on the couch. "S'early- why you up?" he freezes, suddenly alert. He notices that Castiel is fully dressed, with luggage. "Why do you have luggage, Cas?"
They're browsing the empty grocery aisles without saying much to one another until Castiel decides to ask him how he's doing. "Dean-" he slows his pace down a little bit, "I'm glad you decided to come with me, but why?" the teen shrugs, it really can be hard getting anything out of him at times.
"Wild life isn't the same as a human being." Castiel sighs, "We're not killing anyone, please drop it."
Dean shrugs, sitting up because he does want the soup- "I love him." he blows on it before using the large spoon to take small sips.
Castiel's phone starts ringing loudly in the kitchen, "Shit!" he peels Dean off once again and runs for it, answering the call "Hello?"
Castiel saw the tea cup and couldn't help but smile when he was supposed to be mad. He forgot why he was.
They got in line, Both of them looking at the enormous menu on display before them on the wall. " What is all this shi- "
He'd never let himself become his father, even if he ever happened to lose the love of his life. Then it has him thinking, what if he falls in love with Castiel? Would he become so broken that he'd ruin the lives of everyone around him?
Castiel pulls off his shirt, pants next before he's working on pulling off hers completely off her body.
"Shut up-" they share a brief kiss. "You're sexy-" his fingers run though the mans dark hair that now has some gray to it, not a whole lot but it was there. "So fuckin' sexy-"
Dean and Bobby sit down for pizza on the couch that night and they watch the weather girl on the television warning their county about a possible tornado tonight. "Fuck Bobby, the weather around here sucks." he bites into his second slice of pizza, "It's always a damn tornado warning or severe thunderstorms." His uncle just shrugs, he himself was on his fourth slice of the cheesy pie. Once it had started raining Dean had changed the channel and they end up watching some show about zombies that had peeked his interest until a certain character was introduced- "This is boring, night Bobby." he gets up and heads for his room. Bobby assumed he left because a guy popped up on the screen than looked just like his father. Negan or something- what a strange name, though he did like his baseball bat covered in barbed wire.
"Don't do this to me-" he says aloud, softly. "John, you better go-" the lights flicker once more and actually shut off for a good half a minute before they come back on.
Dean trembled, "Hey-hey Cas. Go...I love you, Don't forget." he gave him one final kiss, putting his all into it because it was the last, and pushed him gently in the direction of the car.
The tiny thing looked like it had been mailed to death by something, dried blood and leaves had been matted into her dark fur. The teen actually crouches down in front of the small animal and begins to cry over the loss. As bad as it may sound, It wasn't really about the cat, he did like her a lot but this was pent up grief over his father choosing to come out right then.
The moment he exits his car, the mechanic slams the front door before walking down the street in a hurry. He doesn't even have to wonder where the man is going, the bar around the corner was the only place he goes to on foot.
"Good, because I feel like you just got me pregnant." and he says that seriously, "Whew-" before sitting up, wiping his sweat dripping face with the towel he'd been thrown earlier.
Castiel sits next to him, digging into his own burger. "Take your time, there's no rush." Dean nods.
Jack sniffles, "I had a baby brother named Adam, before Eve- but he didn't make it. Adam died in my moms tummy, that's why I was so scared when my mom was in so much pain-"  Dean doesn't know what to say, so he just pulls him close and holds him for a few minutes- it wasn't long before Kelly called him to come home for dinner.
The teen opens his second gift which turned out to be a couple of new flannels and some jeans among a few other clothing items. He was just happy that it was his style and that he could actually wear this stuff out. There was a small period of time where Castiel failed miserably at dressing him, they must have went through a few
There were times where it was touch and go but he always chose to stay because Dean is nothing like his father, there's a big heart and a kind soul underneath all that anger.
"You're pathetic-" Castiel lets him in through the door, he hadn't taken offense to the comment because he knew he was- come on, he brought
The teen nods in understanding, knowing the kind of damage his father must have done to him. John has beat the man up, raped him and played around with his mind for a long time. They still haven't really talked about how his ex lovers death had affected him, if at all. But it must have hurt something awful, why else would Castiel get himself drunk the same night they found out that John had died.
Dean gulped, inching closer to the man. “I have to be honest…” he started, “I like you. Really really like you.”
Dean started to run too, he was crying but had a smile on his face. When they stood face to face the boy buried his face into the leather of his jacket, inhaling as much of his scent as he could to survive on.
As the night progresses, Robin is actually the first to leave since she is the youngest out of the group and Dean walks her out to her mothers car. They share a hug that lasts a little too long and Dean has to pull himself away, looking warily into her eyes because this behavior is a little
Castiel nods, "I feel horrible." almost on instinct, he grabs a washcloth and begins to bathe Dean like he used to a few years ago. Dean takes the washcloth so he can finish cleaning himself up.
The man in the suit didn't so much as listen to the cashier when he told him how much the total was, simply handed him his
The drive to the hospital in town where Castiel worked was a quiet one. No one spoke, mostly out of worry- Bobby stays silent the whole time, his eyes were closed and you could just tell by looking at him that he wasn't doing well at all.
"Likewise, Dean Winchester." Castiel sighs, "I rarely used to cry before meeting you. Now I cry when I've hurt you-" his fingertips brush along Dean's short hair, "-I cry when you've hurt me. I cry when I'm worry about you- when you're sick or sad." he smiles fondly. "And yet I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world."
"He was hurt pretty bad so maybe in a few days-" and he says that without an ounce of guilt or remorse before he gets under the covers with his son. His hands are kneading his plush thighs while his son whimpers uncomfortably.
"We'll see about that." she bites back. With that, she returns to her seat in front of the computer and Castiel leaves.
"Next weekend?" Castiel looks over at Dean, then Bobby- who nod in agreement. "Great, I'll pick you two up on Friday."
Castiel laughs, "What you're feeling is called Cabin Fever, it'll pass. Now go." he points at the door but the boys are already climbing into bed with him. "I'm not doing this again-" he says as the greedy duo kiss his bare chest and he's instantly regretting getting into bed semi nude.
Dean strips off his shorts and boxers, kicks them out of the way. After taking a deep breath he pulls on the panties, the back part is a little uncomfortable since it's a thong. "Chicks really like these?" he asks himself, picking at the wedgie he's got. Dean goes to his mirror and checks himself out, he pulls off his shirt too and now stands completely naked there, wearing a lace thong. He appreciates that it's a thicker type of thong. Being the shit he is, he goes to Castiel's room. Knocks a few times.
Dean sighs, "Maybe when I was younger- he'd take care of me, still does. He treats me like a baby sometimes-"
"Oh my-" her eyes roll back in her head before her head hits the couch pillow behind her. "Oh my God you do it so good-"
It’s not hard, but it is loud. Dean rolls his face with it, moaning with the hit, then taking it back in the other direction. When Jimmy immediately follows up the backhand by gripping Dean’s throat, Dean knows for a fact Jimmy’s watched more than his fair share of Dean’s videos. This is one of Dean’s bread and butter combos, and fuck if it isn’t a new burst of arousal to have an omega doing it to him instead. This isn’t an alpha dominating him to prove who’s the better alpha; this is an omega taking what he wants because he
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam says, taking his beer from Cas before patting him on the back. “You two have fun.”
So clearly, Dean can picture the way Cas considers this: eyes narrowed, head tilted. “Open the package. Look at them. But do not put them on until I call you.”
When Castiel attempts to sit separately, Dean shifts and drags Castiel’s legs back over his lap. Dean drums atop Castiel’s thighs with loose, nervous fists. “This is gonna sound maybe a little weird,” Dean says.
“I should find a suitable belt for this,” Castiel muses. “Bind it around the back of your head and keep you trapped with your mouth around my cock.”
“Yes,” Cas says. “Your panties excluded, of course.” He lays his head back down on Dean’s shoulder, kissing Dean’s clavicle en route.
He knows exactly what’s going to happen if he follows the plot, and exactly what Cas is gonna arrive to when he inevitably comes to check on Dean and Sam.
Castiel presses close to Hunter, serving as a barrier. He catches Gordon’s sword against his shield, pins it there with his own weapon, and opens himself up to any number of unarmed counter-strikes from Gordon… had not Hunter taken advantage of the opening against Gordon instead.
“Thanks.” Hunter drinks first. Castiel forces himself to ignore the sight even before Hunter begins to wash the limited parts of himself he can reach.
Castiel sighs, one of his full-bodied groans. “I was right not to tell you. I thought it was obvious.”
He walks around in a slow circle, mouth falling open as the cloth shifts against him, as he shifts against it. It’s so fucking good. It’s
“Given that you are such an integral part of the framework of my life, I want to make that official.”
“Everyone stay together,” Jake Talley orders, and they do. Castiel keeps to the rear, the better to observe what is, temporarily, to be his team. Balthazar insinuates himself forward to better reconnoiter, and Hannah remains at Castiel’s side.
“Everyone, this is Castiel. He has the most real field experience out of all of us,” Prince Samuel states. “Forward group, you will listen to his tactics. He’ll join you, along with two of his fighters. They don’t know who I am, and we’re keeping it that way. The rest of you are with me.
“Yeah, well, I know you like feeding me,” Dean says with an embarrassed huff, as if he planned this.
“You can ignore it,” Castiel suggests. “I meant it when I said I’m happy being with you. I don’t need sex or romance.”
Today, Castiel doesn’t announce the results aloud and simply enters them in. As he does, he sees Dean fiddling with the buttons of his sleeve. “Do you need a hand?”
Once up, Dean kicks off the remainder of his pants, the tearaway clothing having made only half of its exodus. Back to the wall, he pants, “I wanna watch you fuck me.” His eyes dart down to where his own jizz and Jimmy’s slick drips and slides down Jimmy’s inner thighs. “God, you’re so fucking hot.”
Still, Cas holds on a long time when Dean hugs him goodbye. When Dean pulls away, Cas tugs him back, thumbs hooked into Dean’s belt just the way that always melts Dean’s brain.
Jimmy stands still for it, wafting annoyance, arousal, and anxiety all at once. Slowly, he hugs Dean back. “Stop calling me ‘baby,’” he mutters into the lapel of Dean’s bathrobe.
Dean nods. “Yeah. Yeah. You, uh.” He shoots a thumbs up at Hannah through the glass door. “I… gotta go install some shit in a kitchen.”
Smelling each other is a hell of a thing. Always has been, regardless of the push for scent blockers on scene. But now, mated, it’s something else entirely. Smelling other alphas, knowing Cas is naked under that robe, it smacks Dean’s instincts around something fierce.
“Yeah,” Dean says slowly. “The librarian is hypothetical. Me doing the asking, that’s the real part.”
“Hello, Commander,” Alistair greets Castiel. “Are you ready for me to break you while your little prince watches?” He nods toward the royal box behind Castiel. “I can practically smell him from here. Can’t you?”
“Very good,” Castiel says, reaching for his thermometer. He clicks the rod into one of the many waiting covers before holding it out to Dean at mouth height. “Temperature check.”
Castiel has a little think about this, and naturally he does it staring directly into Dean’s soul. “I’m saying I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I thought we just agreed on this.”
In a remarkably practiced display, the respective halves immediately begin to argue with each other. Prince Samuel seizes two of his fellows by the arms and tugs them away, off in Hunter’s direction. Castiel follows his lead and draws the twins in the opposite direction. As he does, he manages to catch Balthazar’s eye and nod.
“That’s why I’m here,” Dean says, Dean promises, and he shuts the bedroom door behind him on his way out.
“Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Metallica,” Castiel recites, having seen Dean in band t-shirts for all three, “but sometimes your phone screen displays Taylor Swift songs.”
Castiel kisses him down against the floor. He pulls back too soon, but he pulls Dean with him, tugging Dean up to his feet and—bizarrely—out of the room.
Dean opens his mouth. He plays his tongue out over his bottom lip, just barely. A soft cushion, a place of Castiel to use.
Castiel folds his coat and sets it atop the Impala’s roof, the spot already wiped relatively clear. Then, adjusting his internal temperature, he lies down on the mound of snow.
Castiel exhales hard through his nose. Inhales dust, blood, and Prince Samuel. Perhaps there’s some royal quality that makes Prince Samuel smell like family, vaguely similar to the way King Michael does. This is easier to focus on. Calmer.
Castiel looks up accordingly, blinking, refocusing on Dean’s makeshift embellishment. He looks Dean up and down. He licks his lips, swallows, and licks again. His breathing goes ragged, somehow louder than the music.
Castiel points with his blade, indicating the center of a new and growing alliance. The fighters in the arena have dwindled far enough to make Alistair’s point for him: unless the remaining combatants unite against Prince Samuel’s group now, the weight of superior numbers will crush them. “Do you know that alpha?”
Dean hums an approving sound and lets his hand be used. He curls himself tighter around Castiel, drags Castiel further beneath him. The steady pressure at Castiel’s back turns Castiel over, onto his stomach. Dean’s leg over his drags Castiel the rest of the way under Dean.
“I think that’s what HR is for,” Castiel answers, still hellbent on thinking of something to invite Dean to.
“Gonna feel so good when you fuck me, s’all I can think about, just you slamming that cock up in me. No knot gonna stop you in place, Master’s gonna hammer me all the way through,
Limp and shaking, Dean lets himself be used. With grunts and groans, he begs to be used, unable to keep going on his own. Castiel fucks into his mouth. Fucks him deep and fucks him hard. Dean’s lungs and brain and blood agree that it’s time to pass out, that there’s not enough air, but the white-blue glow in Castiel’s eyes disagrees. It overrules reality.
Cas wipes his face with the heel of his hand. “Apologies. I shouldn’t, I shouldn’t have done that, I’m...”
They get that fixed quickly enough, and Castiel rattles through the remaining questions with the pace of a busy waiter listing the day’s specials. Fortunately, it seems Dean Winchester is the type to crack a grin when asked if he’s had sex with a man in the past three months, or engaged in sex work in the same length of time. It’s a bunch of
With clear misgivings, Hannah obeys. On her own initiative, she removes her waterskin and tosses it to Castiel. She and Garth hoist Gordon up between the two of them. Bewildered and limping heavily, Balthazar follows them out at Castiel’s gestured command. On his way out, Balthazar wobbles into the side of the gate. It was the right choice.
“Because I’m in the graveyard,” Cas answers. “The ingredients they’re missing are all from extinct creatures, but if they carry out the dream summoning, that won’t matter.”
“Your pulse is still on the high end,” Castiel notes. “It’s not high enough to be serious, but it’s something you may want to mention to your doctor.”
At the front of the box, there stands a timekeeper candle in a tall, glass case. By the gleam, timer nails have already been struck into the side of the wax, ready to drop and ring out upon metal. How long the rounds? At this distance, it’s difficult to say. The servant with the horn will certainly let them know when the time comes.
“Have to say, I wouldn’t mind getting in on that ass,” Benny muses, dragging Jimmy’s focus and snarls back to him. “Whoa, hey there.” Benny laughs, holding up both hands. “Seems like you got a big enough a slut there to share.”
Almost sleepily, Castiel opens his laptop on their bed and gestures for Dean to join him once he’s changed. Castiel loads up some mutually approved pornography and instructs Dean to sit on the other side of the laptop facing him. Once Dean’s in place, Castiel proceeds to jerk himself off, his eyes flickering between the screen and Dean’s increasingly straining panties.
Too quickly, the evening slinks away. So much of Castiel’s time with Dean escapes in fleeting, three hour intervals, and tonight is no exception. Technically, that’s six hours they’ve spent around each other today, but the first three no longer feel as if they count. When Castiel mentions this, Dean promptly announces he has nothing pressing he has to do tomorrow.
“Oh.” Despite what Castiel himself would insist, being a mature man of forty, Castiel absolutely pouts. “I’d assumed…”
“I maybe asked their blessing,” Dean admits. “Don’t worry, I said I was asking over a quiet night in, to not freak you out with a public proposal. Totally silent on the BDSM stuff.”
“No. They couldn’t take the sexual debt and wanted to ‘do something for me’ more often than I wanted them to.”
“Uh,” Dean says. “Okay?” He coughs despite there being nothing wrong with his lungs; Castiel checks regularly. “Not exactly sure what you slipping into something a little more comfortable is going to do to help.”
With a wary eye trained on Castiel, clearly waiting for an outsider to usurp him, Jake Talley positions the group according to their strengths and reaches. “And when I say pull back, we pull back,” he finishes. He looks pointedly at Castiel.
Still, there’s a general vibe when the pair look at Dean, and even Benny to some degree. Like Dean’s become a worthless piece of crap for liking the way Benny bends him around and gropes his ass.
“I’m loving the list, babe, but I’m still not telling.” Dean rinses out the pan, rinses the suds off the bottom and his own hands. The pan goes in the drying rack, but he doesn’t go for the dishtowel, instead planting both hands on the lip of the sink.
Hannah forms a wall at his back, sharpening his focus ahead. Castiel hears the shouted directions of which way they are to move, which alphas they are to strike down. When Hannah shouts, Castiel turns, and Balthazar becomes the wall.
Dean pats around the interior of his brain, but there isn’t a snappy retort to be found. He drinks. Clears his throat. Drinks again. “And you wanna, uh.” Dean gestures vaguely with the beer bottle. “Formalize this.”
“When you’re mine,” Castiel instructs quietly, “when you’re all the way mine, tell me you’re ready.”
They kiss goodbye, firm and sincere and much too quick. They shove each other on the shoulder as they part, physically pushing off from each other like a swimmer racing away from the edge of a pool.
They do the dialogue a couple times, the better to get multiple angles, and all the while, Jimmy holds the back of Dean’s shirt. Jimmy breathes on the back of Dean’s neck, and the omega starts standing closer and closer. There’s not much for Dean to smell, what with both of them wearing the same scent, but maybe Jimmy’s not having that issue. Dean probably missed a spot on his back.
Excruciatingly aware of his own too-wide eyes and too-hot face, Dean leans back. Stares at Sam in the desperate attempt to avoid looking at Cas.
“That’s it,” Castiel praises, voice low and thick and deep. He strokes both sides of Dean’s face, soothes the burning ache of his jaw. “Open your eyes, Dean.”
“And,” Dean makes himself add. Makes himself interrupt. Because this part, this is crucial. He swallows. “I gotta be kneeling.”
Cas lets out a happy hum. He squeezes Dean’s hip again before letting go. “Anything else for the dishwasher?”
“I told you to suck me,” Castiel growls. He pulls out his thumb to shove in two fingers instead, longer and deeper, twice as thick. Dean chokes anew. His head spins. His dick hardens. His vision takes on flecks of light, sparks of darkness as he hyperventilates.
He wonders about what Dean would be like after, the best part. Would Dean be a sprawler, his body a weighted blanket across Castiel’s? A cuddler, wrapped around Castiel from the back, or pulling at Castiel’s arm to drape Castiel around himself instead? Would he be too ticklish for Castiel to stroke his sides and touch all those mundane yet intimate places that boyfriends, not friends, are allowed to touch? Would Dean be comfortable enough in his own skin to allow naked cuddling, that unadulterated closeness? Would Dean let himself be held that way without demanding more?
“You don’t even sleep, asshole.” Yawning again, Dean relocates his hand to the back of Castiel’s head. Dean stretches out, his legs framing one of Castiel’s, his chest and crotch pushing against Castiel’s middle.
With that tiny bit of preamble in place, Benny and the other alphas pop up with what will probably become comedic timing, given Gabriel’s editing history. Dean again hits his mark, shepherding Jimmy behind him, and he exchanges less than brilliant repartee with the thugs about to have themselves a little party.
“I’ve already lost,” Castiel says, but willingly accompanies them. Going up the wooden stairs hurts, though. Gripping the railing with his right hand, Castiel has to haul himself up with each step. To his tired body, the staircase seems a better seat than many. He forces himself onward.
Whining, Dean thunks his head back against the floor. The pull on his knot. The sheer vibration through Jimmy’s body and the air.
Dean sits in the canteen, and Castiel ostensibly returns to work. Most of the other donors have the expressions of people refusing to comment, but the full blood donors are out the door quickly enough. Meg clearly can’t wait to start teasing him, and even Hannah looks back over the dividing wall from time to time.
“If I can smell you, so can others,” Castiel replies. “That’s what Gordon meant, you defying the natural order.”
Castiel throws back his head and sighs. Still holding Dean in place, he pushes deeper, pushes all the way in until Dean kisses him to the root. That gets a groan, low and approving.
“Yes,” Castiel says, because that ought to be obvious. “When family members donate for a loved one and that loved one dies anyway, the donors often blame themselves for not doing more.”
There’s an abrupt flurry of footsteps pounding down the staircase inside, the screaming carried with it. After only a brief bit of tumblers turning in their locks, there’s Cas, pale except for the dark bruises beneath his eyes, hair flat and oily where it isn’t sticking up wildly, his t-shirt stained with who knows what. In his arms, he bounces the human loudspeaker that is his godson.
“Please let me suck my fiance’s dick,” Dean begs, playing it up, and Castiel’s eyes go so very round, so very dark. “I want my future husband’s cock in me, please, baby.”
Hunter eyes him with a confused measure of suspicion, but he smiles back readily when Castiel surprises himself with a grin.
His timetable on asking Dean to hang out shifts accordingly. Dean typically remains in the canteen for five to ten minutes, instead of the recommended fifteen. The narrowed window of opportunity bodes poorly.
“Something wrong?” Castiel checks, breaking an abruptly shallow kiss to look around. It’s a liberal town, but two men openly kissing at night might still have cause for concern.
Eventually, they sit themselves down. Eventually, they have those important talks, and Cas takes his Plan B. Eventually, they do a lot of things, but for now, Dean laughs and laughs, kissing his mate’s wide grin.
The noise trickles out around Castiel’s fingers, a keening, hitching whimper too desperate to be sexy. Mortification blazes though Dean, hotter than his dick, hotter than Castiel himself, but Castiel simply nods.
“Okay.” Castiel closes his eyes briefly, visualizing his new route past several grocery stores, and decides which one. “I’ll see you in half an hour, traffic pending. Love you.”
Castiel takes care of the snowplow’s contribution well before Dean finishes a single side of the car. When Castiel gets up, shirt and pants clinging wetly to him, perpetually steaming into the dark, Dean stares. Castiel smiles faintly in return; he must look very strange.
The other alphas both indicate where they’ll be fucking him, and in which order, and Jimmy just nods, like that’s the full extent of everything they have to talk about. The other alphas don’t even seem to disagree with that assessment, either.
Dean bites his lip once more, but doesn’t immediately say anything. Instead, he sighs and pushes up his sleeve, then pointedly waits for Castiel to do his job.
Prince Samuel pays him no mind, gesturing for Castiel to follow. Castiel complies, shaking his head faintly at Balthazar. As Castiel passes him, Hunter pats his shoulder in parting. Castiel looks back in time to receive another nod, but then Prince Samuel draws his attention toward where they’re headed.
at him, in that way Cas has, in that way only Cas has. But this way is a new way, because this one is close to tears.
“No one’s a crazy cat guy,” the guy says in way too calm a tone. “But sometimes, people abandon their pets to a known cat lover, and that can build on itself until there are too many for any one person to care for. Which is why the local shelter has an outreach program of people like me, to drop off supplies. Most of the cashiers here know what I do and let me know when someone else buys an unusual amount of cat food.“
Castiel removes his fingers from Dean’s hole. He breathes on it once more, making it twitch around nothing. He pats Dean’s ass with his left hand, a firm swat that’s still a far cry from a true spanking. “Beg, Dean.”
Dean stands close, his legs framing Castiel’s knees. He takes Castiel’s hand for him. Brings that touch around to grab his ass, to grab it hard. Again, the mesh itches in that faint, new clothes way, but with Castiel staring up at him, the itch bothers far less.
Attention torn between Castiel and the approaching line of alphas, Hunter mutters, “Yeah? And what do you do to the ones you catch?”
When it’s time for Castiel’s afternoon break some twenty minutes later, Dean’s still in the canteen, juice box on the table in front of him, along with two empty bags of Cheez-Its. Dean’s eyes snap to Castiel shortly after Castiel looks at him. Dean sits up straight, practically standing at attention while seated. Sure to smile, Castiel waves with an ungloved hand before heading into the office that doubles as a break room.
A loud laugh, hard and good and grinning when Hunter slaps his hand on Castiel’s good shoulder. “Cas, you are… I don’t even know what you are.”
Dean puts his acting face on. He delivers his lines. He hits his marks. Jimmy’s character is less character and more Jimmy: clearly thinking Dean’s character is an idiot for wanting to take a shortcut down this alleyway. The “alley” in question only has the one faux-brick wall, the main camera situated perpendicular to it.
Jimmy breaches him in a stretch almost as good as two of his fingers. Longer, thicker, yes, but less dexterous, less able to immediately press and rub where the rubbing is good. Hotter too, though, so hot. Dick so hot with blood and intent, like having Jimmy press part of his heart inside Dean.
“And given that I’m now ‘over the hill,’ I realize I’ve neglected certain guardrails.” Castiel shifts on the couch, turning to face Dean directly. “There are things in life I thought I’d have in hand by now, or at least further underway. But while we’re close, there are things we don’t discuss that I think we should.”
Benny turns around at Dean’s silence, and what with being Benny, shoots a wink at Jimmy Angel. Who already looks more thunderous than aloof.
“I don’t know what the item is,” Cas answers without hesitation. “Your reward. If I don’t like it, that’s akin to punishing you, and I don’t want to do that.”
As for the flouncy ones… nothing looks right. Maybe if he had a soft, cozy sweater instead of all his Henleys, that might work. His wardrobe isn’t exactly full of soft pink and white frills. And it’s not like he
Sam jerks his hand in a tiny wave, and they both head off in something way closer to a hurried retreat than a scurry toward sex.
Dean’s prostate orgasm fails to come before Jimmy does, but Dean doesn’t even care. His ass can take a few poundings more, and that’s just talking about today. He’s a professional, and he has the stamina of one. And if no one’s ever bothered to let Jimmy fuck them long enough to teach him how to do it right, then Dean’s gonna be a lucky bastard, getting to teach him from scratch.
Normally, Dean would reject that out of hand, but Sam’s been harping on about this for ages. “Okay, deal. What’s the bet? Pool?”
The tiny pair, black lace over black silk, fully crossing the line from underwear and into male lingerie.
The horns blow, and rather than try to jog back to Prince Samuel and the few others remaining of their group, Hunter slows and stops. Castiel stops with him.
He scans the tables, most already occupied by two or more. He looks down the line of booths, seeing backs of heads and faces in an alternating order. The muted TVs mounted to the walls at various angles have subtitles on, but there’s music as well, making it all the harder to listen for one specific voice beneath the general hubbub.
“Thank you,” Castiel says primly before going through the routine pre-donation steps. “Dean Winchester, January twenty-fourth?”
Refusing to look, Dean shakes his head. Bad enough to have his subconscious do this to him in his sleep.
“I should tell you something,” Castiel says with a groan, his cheek set against Dean’s chest where they sprawl on Dean’s couch, failing to watch TV.
Looking at Castiel somewhat furtively, Dean asks, “So like… If we were both there, watching porn, jerking it… That’d work?”
With a slow, proprietary inspection, Castiel’s eyes trace Dean’s shaking thighs. They linger on the damp spot.
Dean puts both hands down on the kitchen island, no doubt putting a pair of sweaty palm prints onto the surface. “I, um.” Keeping calm. Being terrified, but keeping calm. “I got you something.”
“And I love you,” Dean continues through it. “And I fed you, and made you coffee with sugar in it, and I love you. Know I already said that, but I get guilty sometimes, ‘cause I don’t tell you enough. But your good boy doesn’t get guilty, your good boy gets better, so I’m saying it, I love you.”
“Got it,” Dean says before doing as bid, carrying his plaid shirt instead of putting it back on. Castiel goes back to work, but he does see Dean as he leaves, stopped by the door to give him a wave.
Rolling his eyes, Castiel reaches up to cup Dean’s face and pull him into a chaste kiss. The temperature of Dean’s face is proof enough that Dean must have been standing out in the cold for a few minutes or more.
“Yeah, not happening tonight,” Dean says, licking his lips, staring at the package. “Should I… I mean…”
“Wow. You’re really hot.” Dean steps back in the slush, some of the heat flush fading from his face. “I mean. Body-wise. I mean. You just, uh. Keep doing that.”
A few more donors and covering for Meg during her break, and it’s time to detach Dean. Pulling on a fresh pair of gloves with the change of patient, Castiel nudges Dean’s shoulder with his wrist.
“I asked Bobby,” Castiel says. “For the graduation party, I said we’d need a moment alone and he asked why and I told him and he hugged me. Then he called Sam, and Sam helped me with the ring-”
The boy’s form had been good despite the youth of his face. Barely presented at thirteen, but very steady for his age, training with older squires, young alphas of sixteen or more.
Once more, Castiel tries not to study him too hard; he’s aware his bedside manner can be disconcerting at times. For that reason, he keeps his focus on Dean’s arm. Dean’s musculature might be well-defined, but this vein isn’t quite so obvious. It takes Castiel a few moments longer to be sure before drawing his lines, and Dean doesn’t comment on this.
Cas visibly gropes around for the pieces of this mental jigsaw puzzle and slaps two together. “If you’re deliberately earning ways of being a good boy, I’m not sure it counts as much.” He thinks about that a little harder. “I’m not sure.”
Eyes closed, ears alert, Dean hugs Castiel tight around the waist. Careful about sensitivity, he keeps swallowing to a minimum and minds the placement of his tongue. Going soft, Castiel’s cock turns from hot to warm, from attractive to endearing. He’s smaller, softer. Vulnerable. Dean’s mouth becomes a sheath, a hideaway, a place of safety.
“Tell me about it. Scheduling Friday afternoons off to come here is the closest I get.” As he speaks, Dean’s tone becomes less sulky, and yet the sparkle of friendly teasing never returns to his eyes. It takes away so much of that green shine.
Ahead of him: Alistair in full armor, broadsword swinging. Ahead of them both: Hunter in chain and leathers, sprinting toward the rail. Ahead of them all: a shouting crowd and the half-empty royal box.
The boy would be grown now, perhaps twenty-three or twenty-four. The alpha brother may yet be twenty, and some alphas remain unmated for a very long time, political pressure or not. Should the brother be picky enough, Castiel might remain unconcerned by this matter for a decade, long enough for much to change. It’s a thin hope, but still a hope.
“Up front,” Castiel agrees. It puts him on the side of their group away from Prince Samuel and Hunter, puts him facing enemies, his own body forming the border between enemy and ally. It also allows him to see Alistair diagonally across the arena, the alpha’s tall helmet purposefully unmistakable. Given that the arena is a rectangle, it does put Alistair and Prince Samuel’s group nearly as far apart as possible.
“You don’t have to do anything. I’m only talking about options.” With that, she passes Castiel the pillow he’d used and picks up a throw pillow for herself. “Ready to wake up Jack?”
Dean grimaces, looking down at his bandaged arm. “Sorry, I know it’s weird to ask at work, and I went ahead and did it anyway-”
“A lot of people fuck after funerals, it’s not that weird,” Dean continues. “So... yeah. A couple months late on the timing, but. Not that weird.”
“Then to you, stranger,” Castiel replies, with only the slightest hint of a bow, “I would be ‘Commander Novak-Shurley.’”
“What? Oh, no,” Dean says, his signature flush coming back in full. “I mean, like. Y’know. Gay culture shit. Triceratops going clubbing, T-Rex trying to put on those beads they hand out at Pride with his huge head and tiny arms, that kinda stuff. Pterodactyls doing theater, stegosaurus playing D&D.”
“Sir,” the costumed man says in the tones of a severely underpaid mall Santa, “is there a reason your son wants me to give you blood?”
Cas wastes no time in turning Dean away from the rest. “Drop,” Cas orders, and Dean’s right there with him on the plan.
Bitterness pushes Dean through the dishes and into the fridge in general. What he sees basically confirms what the peanut butter and jelly clinging to the knives had attested, and this is why Dean is boiling pasta and melting cheese when Cas staggers back downstairs.
A few more full blood donations later, Castiel unhooks Dean as well, prompting him to hold gauze. Still familiar with the routine, Dean complies almost before Castiel can ask it. Now, at least, much of the tension in Dean’s arms has receded.
“I- Never mind.” He sets his hand on Castiel’s shoulder in a vague attempt to ground himself, or maybe to ground Cas. “You’re not dying, Cas.” It’s only while waving his finger in Castiel’s face that he realizes he should maybe ask that question. “You’re not dying, right?”
“Dude!” Dean shouts at him across the flimsy barrier of sturdy half-walls, holding up his own phone and pointing at it.
Castiel stares down while the crowd screams daggers into his ears. Unable to face the arena, his eyes seek out Jack in the stands and find the boy standing in his chair, shouting his lungs out, arms waving in frantic delight.
“I’ll bring some stuff over tomorrow,” Dean says, closing the freezer door. “Fast stuff that actually counts as food.”
“This is wrong!” Gordon shouts, now to Prince Samuel. “He can’t be on the field. I never agreed to this!”
“We got this,” Dean says, pulling Cas forward into a deeper stretch. They sit on the floor, legs spread wide, taking turns drawing their partner forward and down. “No one’s got what we got, ‘cause I’ve got you,” Dean adds, the closest thing he has to a pep talk.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel says quietly, eyes on Dean’s arm. “That was all unprofessional. I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
Closer to twenty minutes later, when Dean demands to be the little bowl, Castiel heaves the exact same sigh.
Cas groans out something less like a no and more like a dramatic complaint. He rolls his head back, though, and that’s all Dean needs.
Bending Dean backwards over his own restrained arms, Castiel doesn’t acknowledge Sam in the slightest. “What is your mouth for, Dean?”
Finally, ten minutes before his appointment, Dean walks on in. He waves and smiles at Castiel before speaking to Hannah, and Castiel takes him early. In the processing room, Castiel flies through the regular questions but has to slow down for the thermometer and the timed process of taking Dean’s pulse and blood pressure.
Rather than the traditional joust, Dean Winchester has selected instead a melee. The omega, famed for his emerald eyes and cupid’s bow lips, has such a surfeit of suitors that the only efficient means of deciding among them is battle.
The past few months of frantic experience have taught him that his prostate needs at least ten minutes between orgasm and fucking, but Castiel has spoiled him. Orgasm means Castiel playing with him, toying him open. Orgasm is no longer the end of sex, barely the middle of it, and Dean should get an anal plug next, instead of more panties. He should stick that up his ass, cover it up with one of these silky bastards, and make Cas only look, not touch.
Back out in the main room, patiently waiting to be drawn on and then punctured, Dean has his flannel off and folded in his lap, on top of the light jacket he’d already removed. Down to a band t-shirt, he is clearly a man used to wearing many layers, but looking at him, it’s hard to imagine Dean having body image problems. Between his chest and his arms, Dean’s a very fit man, and the softness to his stomach is that of someone who eats well.
Black button down with the deep red, obviously. Matching anything to the black lace proves more difficult, with the black shirt already claimed, but an unbuttoned white shirt is a potential contender.
Castiel sucks in a hard breath. Exhales slow through his nose. Risks a look at Dean. “I love you like this.”
Coming back into the donation room, he immediately looks to Dean, and here at least is confirmation: Dean’s staring back. Dean immediately closes his eyes, but the quick, guilty eye contact was enough to prove Castiel isn’t simply being paranoid. What it means beyond that, Castiel has absolutely no idea.
The man tilts his head, eyes narrowing in confusion. “But you bought the most cat treats last month.”
In a one-two combo, Jimmy grips Dean by the hair before slapping his face. Dean rolls with the telegraphed motion, crying out more from the surge in Jimmy’s scent than he does from the impact. “Your knot isn’t good enough,” Jimmy tells him, although the motions of his body reveal the lie. In reaching forward for the slap, Jimmy pulled off him, but Jimmy’s ass comes right back down, seeking out Dean’s exhausted boner. “You haven’t earned a good fucking either, but choking you would stop the begging.”
“Nope.” Then, right before Cas can press the button: “Wait, you’ve got, like, five mugs in the office.”
Putting his jeans back on is borderline sacrilegious. A band t-shirt and his leather jacket make it at once worse and better, if Dean thinks of them as subterfuge.
It’s horribly uncommon. It’s a level of generosity I hardly see from most of humanity. Some people use the time to watch movies without feeling guilty, or even to nap. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to listen to your music for a few hours undisturbed.”
“No one hurts you like I do,” Castiel adds in his blunt, almost conversational way. “And I don’t hurt anyone as much as I hurt you.”
Sitting down and with nothing particular to do, Castiel instead thinks. For approximately ten minutes, he thinks, interrogating himself and his own reactions. Frowning and coming to what feels like a reasonable guess, he pulls his phone out of the phone drawer and texts Kelly.
“What do I win?” Castiel asks rhetorically, pulling the blanket up over Dean’s lap and laying the top edge over his chest.
No matter what Dean does, no matter how he tries, there’s nothing to be done. Castiel only nudges Dean’s knees farther apart with each failed attempt, until there’s no telling whether Dean’s tears are of frustration or the immense pain of his legs or of the agony of tight, wet jeans tugging against his dick.
Body singing in tune to the music now coming from Castiel’s room, Dean readies himself in the bathroom. His finishing touch feels silly, now that he comes to it, but Castiel’s larger bathroom allows Dean the extra few steps back from the mirror, enough room to see more of himself.
Hunter cranes over Castiel’s shoulder to see, his breath hot where it can slip through to Castiel’s sweaty skin. A piece of strange distraction bubbles up through Castiel’s mind at that, but he takes it, breaks it, and puts it aside. Hunter still carries the faintest hint of omega scent with him, that token hidden inside his armor, hidden beneath the arena’s dust; that combined with simple sensation is reason enough for Hunter’s breath on his neck to bring him chills.
“I love you,” Castiel promises, words that can’t reach him, and smites Dean from the inside blazing out.
“Do you not want me?” Dean interrupts. He crowds forward, unable to prevent it. “Look, I get not wanting to tank your career, saddling yourself to one partner-”
“Do anything good?” Dean asks as Castiel hooks him up yet again. Castiel talks about as much as he can about Christmas and New Year’s with Jack’s grandparents, and their continuing, ill-founded conviction that he and Kelly will “settle down properly” someday. Dean’s laugh is a little forced in response, but after all, Castiel
“If you want my come, ask for it,” Castiel commands, both hands now gentle against Dean’s scalp. “You’re right, we do make you ask for what you want, don’t we, sweet boy?”
“The omega was young, with parents yet to allow courtship or claiming,” Castiel continues. “Regardless, I have never seen nor smelled another to sway me away. I swore to wait. I am still waiting.”
Dean whimpers until he can’t, but he does not nod. Bursts of color stain his vision, even as it darkens.
After a dozen more seconds of staring into Dean’s soul, Cas says, entirely without any transition: “You’ll never be as old as I am.”
“Glad it’s you I’m paired up with, brother,” Benny murmurs into Dean’s ear, freakin’ reading his mind.
With only a few more hours until morning, Castiel remains in place. He inspects Dean’s hands. He studies Dean’s face. He breathes in Dean’s scent. He thinks about innumerable things, though Dean would blush to hear what percentage of that infinity remains focused on him. Blush and bluster, full of reflexive anger, his signature preemptive defensiveness.
Those start to put Dean’s hackles up, but Cas soothes those hackles back down. The focus required in changing positions while tied also helps; it tugs on Dean’s knot, and both of their scents take a turn back towards horny as Dean settles down, back arched up to let Cas kneel over him, then lying down to let Cas kneel atop him. Together, they massage Cas’ thick thighs.
“Eat,” Dean orders, way more testily than he wants to be. He goes back to the stove and dumps the remainder from saucepan to tupperware. Keeps the lid off, lets the steam out, has it sit on the counter while Dean washes both saucepans. He digs through Cas’ fridge and pantry, and there’s not a lot of good options for reheatable meals.
Two weeks later, there’s a name on the schedule Castiel recognizes. Today, Meg’s the one to process Dean Winchester, and Dean keeps looking across the donation center as if hoping Castiel will rescue him from her. Meg’s bedside manner is far more abrupt than Castiel’s, which is saying something, but she’s hardly about to hurt anyone. Beyond the harm of a needle prick, at least.
Castiel draws the ribbon from its knot. From its loop around Dean’s neck. He clenches it in his hand as Dean leans back and pets the ruffled sides of the panties.
“Stay close for the next horn,” Castiel tells Hunter. “You’re not the first I’ve found on the battlefield.”
Dean’s stuck in boxers under pajama pants, the pull-string double-knotted, but the firm ass against him is entirely, infuriatingly naked.
In the next five minutes, she must be unable to text back, and Castiel finishes his break without reaching a true conclusion. Asking Meg or Hannah these things isn’t as helpful as asking Kelly.
“I dunno, man,” Dean says with half a shrug. “When I don’t need a funny sonovabitch who listens to my crap and tells me his crap while looking like a hospital gift shop teddy bear, I’ll let you know.”
Before he knew it, they were pulling into there motel. He turned to gaze at the man next to him. That amazing, fantastically sexy man. His eyes wouldn't meet his. Was he uncomfortable? Maybe he hadn't meant to kiss him, maybe he regretted it. That thought sent a jolt of pain through his chest. He fought the urge to rub against it, clenching his hands into fists, his nails digging into the palms.
“Hmm...” The creature's lips vibrated against his skin. Dean caught sight of Cas who had now narrowed his eyes, his fists clenching at his sides. It was like he was trying to hold back his possessiveness over Dean. Dean could see the fight in him, could see it had taken great strength for him not to attack, to pull Dean away from this revolting thing. If it had been Dean, he would have already given into that fight, causing chaos in its wake. He admired the angel in that moment, his heart thumped again with the relief that Cas was able to hold himself back… for now. Who knew what would happen if Cas had sprung on the Shadow in that moment.
He wipes the tears from his face and pulls himself off the floor. He sweeps the room with his eyes. Completely trashed. He couldn't bring himself to care, not really. He needed a beer… or something stronger. His mind is still swirling with thoughts about his feelings and what he should do with them as he walks into the main room and grabs his whisky. He can feel Sam's eyes watching him, probably worried, but he couldn't care less. He needs a drink, he can judge all he wants. He pours himself a generous amount of whisky, keeping his back to his brother. He knows his eyes are all red and puffy from where he'd been crying and he knows Sam will jump all over that band-wagon the moment he turns. He takes a sip of the liquid, feeling it burn as it makes its way down, finally coming to a stop in his stomach, warming it. He let's out a pleasurable sigh at the feeling.
Rage. So much rage zoomed through him, setting him on fire. What was he angry at? Chuck for ignoring him, yes. Angry at Cas for leaving him, for choosing that Kelly bitch over him, yes. But most of all, he was angry at himself. He could of stopped him, he could of done something, anything to stop this from happening. Instead he'd let his brother take control, he'd let Lucifer stab the only person he ever truly loved with everything he had. Now it was gone.
Dean attempts to stand on shaky legs, but falls back down to the soft bed. He grumbles a curse word under his breath.
This feeling, it was just sexual attraction, that's all. There were no feelings involved. And Dean knew that if he was ever going to cross that line, he needed to have feelings as well. But he didn't have them. Would probably never have them. He wasn't the type to just fall in love easily. This isn't love. It's as far away from love as it could possibly get.
The sheets rustle as loudly as Dean’s breathing, as full of heat and damp as those hot breaths. Dean rocks against him. Into him. Dean holds him tight through the limited traction and leverage memory foam can provide.
“It’s down to three months, yes,” Castiel says, his mouth still working while the rest of him goes to some thoughtless, thrumming place of discontent. He pulls up a calendar from the menu bar of the laptop and quickly flicks back.
Serving as a shield, Balthazar stays to Castiel’s right. Serving as a wall, Hannah remains behind him. The motions of the rest of the raiding party fit together only roughly, marking Castiel, Hannah, and Balthazar out as a tight three-person unit amid the greater group. Their captain shouts out which direction needs reinforcing, and this is how they turn. This is how they travel, working their way clockwise around Prince Samuel’s group, toward the wall.
Castiel screws up his face. Nods. Strangles the shit out of the ribbon in the effort not to touch himself. Dean hasn’t even told him not to.
“Whatever group needs to fall back, falls back,” Jake Talley tells her, as if this ought to be obvious.
Dragged lower and folded backward, Dean can only stare up at Castiel, looking up and up until his throat becomes a straight line down, a straight passage down that Castiel fills inch by suffocating inch. Panic fires in Dean’s brain, not for air or safety or logic, but the terrified sensation of his lips stretched too far, his teeth too much bared. Castiel won’t like it, it won’t be good, Castiel will get his cock all the way down Dean’s throat only to decide it’s not worth the bother.
Once they’re both warm, if not presentable, Jimmy leads the way back to the omega dressing room, gripping Dean securely by the hand. Gabriel shouts after them that the no sex in the dressing rooms rule still applies, but Dean does them both a favor by pretending not to hear. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t, but some good heavy petting will definitely be called for.
Grumbling, Castiel digs up the remote from between the two of them and starts scrolling. Finally, he says, “
For now, Dean simply deposits Jack into the high chair at the table, confirms that the kid isn’t going to flop out, and starts doing the dishes. He hears the shower turn on upstairs and steadfastly Does Not Think About anything the shower might imply. Namely, nudity and Cas, together. Because there’s being a horny piece of shit, and then there’s being a horny piece of shit while his best friend is grieving the alleged love of his fucking life.
“Dream summoning?” Sam repeats. “Cas, most of the stolen stuff works for dreamwalking. What do you mean, summoning?”
He could make Cas sit there and watch. Make him stare at the flouncy layers or the silken stretch. Maybe the lacy pair is exactly too small, maybe Dean will be falling out of it with every step, oh dear, and Cas will have to stay put, hands to himself, as Dean adjusts the scrap of fabric time and time again.
Looks like for all Jimmy claims to be a fan of Dean’s “jubilant” acting style, the guy’s still got some basic alpha-on-alpha bias that needs working on. It dims Dean’s mood more than he’d ever admit, but again, Jimmy Angel isn’t Dean’s problem.
Tammy smiles at Dean gently, sympathetically. “My sister just came out too. It’s okay, you don’t have to be so nervous.”
“Whuh?” Dean asks. Reality fits too well into his dream—a horny mess of jerking off and jerking off, and yet never being able to feel it, let alone come—before he puts two and two together and realizes the dick in his hand isn’t his own.
Prince Samuel nods. “We separate from here. We don’t regroup until you need to fall back, or we need reinforcements. Don’t nod, don’t confirm. Last chance to talk before we split.”
,” Hunter agrees, and his name absolutely suits him, from teeth to blade. The magnificence of the righteous. The glory of the just.
He smacks their mouths together. No teeth-on-teeth collision, but it ain’t soft. It’s nothing a first kiss should be, just deranged instinct freaking out in one concentrated direction. Cas’ mouth is a little open, going in, so it’s wetter than Dean had expected—hoped—but whatever mental lever that unclenches Dean’s jaw has gotten stuck. Dean’s closed mouth against Cas’ open one, bumping right up into the guy’s face.
The part of Dean that flushes and squirms, that part gets drowned out by the confirmation of reality itself. Good person, bad person; that isn’t tonight’s debate. Tonight, the question is
Already laughing to himself, Dean relinquishes his hold on Cas’ face to instead offer his hand. “Nice to meet you.”
“I can be very hot,” Castiel replies, already slipping out of his trench coat, and Dean pulls back so abruptly, he nearly slips.
“I- There’s no reason to apologize,” Castiel replies, although the words sound suspiciously like a lie once said aloud. “He’s your grandfather, not mine. I was only worried how you were taking it.”
“I’m,” Jimmy starts to say. He pauses. Still doesn’t turn around. Beside him, Hannah fidgets with a product of some kind. “I’ve seen some of your work.”
“I’m upset,” Castiel states, feeling it keenly, his mouth a hard line. Through his windshield, he sees Hannah climb into their own car with a small wave. He nods back.
His nerves buzz in confusion, his lungs bewildered, his heart galloping. He chokes and chokes perpetually, except he doesn’t, he controls it, he learns to control it by letting it happen. He can flutter his throat.
Under the flag of that peace treaty, Castiel cracks open Dean’s bedroom door. The sliver of light that escapes over his head and into the room lends enough illumination to easily spot the pajama bottoms tossed on the unoccupied side of the bed.
Cas rolls his eyes but nevertheless switches out of his regular between takes bathrobe and into the silkier costume robe, the sort wrestlers wear. Except theirs have more of a jersey aesthetic to them with their surnames hyphenated above the symbol of their respective designations. Well, their acting surnames. As far as credits go, Hunter Ryder and Jimmy Angel are now the Angel-Ryder couple, and having it emblazoned on a pair of matching robes has Dean grinning his face off.
Castiel nods very seriously before tucking Dean’s jacket around his legs anyway. For an unnerving instant, Dean freezes, forcing Castiel to wonder how far he’s overstepped.
This week is busier, but Castiel does get that time to calm himself. He also gets that time to fully realize he still has Dean restrained and attached to a machine he can’t detach himself from without excessive bleeding.
“Uh, right.” Dean clears his throat. Looks around. Remembers that the cooling body was there the entire time, unlike, for example, the bed that vanished and dropped him onto concrete. “Where are my clothes?”
As Castiel pulls out for the last time, the muscles of Dean’s throat shift and strain back into their proper conditions. His lip tingles, an unnoticed split repairing. The ache in his jaw lessens, enough for Dean to catch at the head of that massive dick, to beg at the sweet spot beneath it before Castiel takes it away entirely.
“Then it’s not dishonest.” Kelly replaces the couch cushions while Castiel folds back up the guest sheets.
When Gabriel waves a hand and tells them to stop, they do. Ever the gentlealpha, Benny helps Dean back up onto his feet and even asks how his knees are doing.
Rolling his eyes, Dean starts to read, only to wind up missing the rest of his TV show by sheer inattention.
“I know,” Jimmy deadpans, and Dean almost breaks character laughing. “Turn around anyway. I don’t want you thinking you’re earned the privilege of biting me.”
Fighting the impulse to cover his mate with his entire body, Dean instead pulls back, demonstrating for the camera how the tug of his knot makes the tight rim of Cas’ hole bulge. All Dean has to do each time is tug and not fall out.
By unspoken agreement, every alliance begins to press back from the center of the arena. Castiel looks back to find that Prince Samuel’s group has secured a spot by the arena wall: protected on one side without being boxed in. The raiding party shuffles back toward them, taking up a position adjacent to Prince Samuel, not the walls. Threats in only two directions, for Prince Samuel. Standing with Balthazar beside him and Hannah behind him, Castiel is in much the same position.
That gets a bit of a chuckle. “Okay, fair.” Dean clears his throat. “And it’s—I wasn’t lying, I meant it when I said I don’t have to have sex. I, you said you were ace, and I thought, y’know. If we went long term. Whether I could hack it. I don’t know if that’s presumptive or weird or normal for this, but, uh. I figured, should probably sort that one out first. Or maybe just, I dunno, ask you to do shit as friends and do the celibacy thing until I was sure, or… fuck man, I don’t even know.”
“For this alpha has bequeathed the greatest courting gift unto my son that he has ever desired,” King John continues, now gesturing to the lone figure standing in the arena. Standing with fear tightened into defiance. “Victory.”
“Might be a weird question,” Dean muses as Castiel presses gauze against Dean’s first arm. “What’s your opinion on people asking each other out at work?”
From that day on, Castiel withstands the gifts of textbooks and travel logs. He navigates an extremely confusing period of determining whether it is Samuel or Dean Winchester who he is meant to be pledged to. He endures the relayed snatches of poetry written about his alleged love but does, at least, learn that the omega is Dean.
The next few words are lost beneath the jubilation, but continue into flowery praise of the local competitors. Different sections of the stands applaud at different names, but the praised alphas surrounding Castiel don’t acknowledge these accolades. Good. It wouldn’t be wise to draw such blatant attention to their alliance.
Though Dean’s color had evened out as time passed, his eyes closed and his feet tapping to whatever music was playing in his ears, Dean flushes again. Nervous about making a fuss, Castiel assumes.
Castiel squeezes him hard, a frantic, full-bodied hug, before rising up on one arm, before jerking it and jerking it as Dean fills up the condom.
The strain of prolonged combat visibly delaying his reaction, Hunter pauses before grinning, the expression visible in his eyes. Through the wide slit of his visor, sweat shines on his face, beading in the dust on his skin. “Whenever I can get away with it.”
“No, fine, whatever.” He shrugs and turns away, heading out of the kitchen and to the stairs. “I’m gonna try to put him down for a nap.”
Castiel leans over and secures the button of the cuff for him, the texture of the flannel made strange through his gloves. “There.”
Once it’s unlikely Dean’s looking, Castiel opens his eyes to look instead. From this position, he can still see the motel room window. The lights are off inside, but there’s a gap in the blinds that wasn’t there previously. Castiel gives Sam a pointed look. The gap in the blinds doesn’t waver.
“Yeah, one sec.” Phone and headphones already out, Dean spreads his jacket over his legs and covers his chest with his flannel. “Brought my own blankets this time. No tucking necessary.”
Slowly, mournfully, Cas looks up at him. “He said he could... get you to do that,” Cas says. Gestures at his own mouth. “I told him not to.”
Finally relaxed, possibly having been asleep, Dean blinks open his eyes before turning off his music. “Awesome.”
you cool.” This is stated with the confidence of a child who has always had Castiel as a role model. There are worse fates.
Nodding, Castiel sticks the appropriate labels in the appropriate spots. “Make sure you grab something from the canteen before you go. You can sit in the reception area if there isn’t enough room.”
Castiel looks down at the pouch in one hand and the row of testing vials in the other. Maybe that’s what’s unnerving Dean. “Of course. I’ll be right back.”
Dean Winchester dutifully shrugs out of his plaid button-down—an odd layer choice this close to summer—and offers his left arm, pushing up the sleeve of his t-shirt right-handed. A quick wrap, pump, listen and release later, and Castiel nods. Draping the stethoscope over his shoulders so as not to forget it in this closet of a processing room, Castiel informs him, “Your pulse is slightly elevated, but nothing out of the normal range.”
With his eyes squeezed shut, Dean might even believe that. Then he hears Castiel’s shoes hitting the ground. Feels Castiel lying down beside him.
“Dude, it’s fine,” Dean says despite having looked disappointed earlier. “You’re swamped, I get it.”
is hardly the term when unconscious or groaning alphas are bodily dragged from the arena. Boots scratch furrows through the dust, and blood waters that barren field.
“I brought headphones, I got my music,” Dean says before pulling out his phone and patting it. “Guessing it’s headphones time.”
“It’s fine, Hannah,” the omega answers in a voice Dean has only heard before on film. Still absurdly deep, though: method acting, or his real voice? “We’re about to get fucked in front of each other. I hardly mind sharing a dressing room.”
Inside—outside—there is a curtain. The scenting curtain, which from the outside shields Queen Mary, Princess Madison, and Prince Dean from voyeurs.
As Dean sets about the familiar work of blowing his mate, he hears both Michael and Hester taking wildly different approaches to their omegas. Prepping the hole instead, probably working in some stretches. But no, not for Cas. They keep him tight, though Dean does pull Cas’ ass cheeks wide as the camera circles around to take a look. Cas leaks and leaks, but his only concession to arousal is to widen his stance and growl with his hand buried in Dean’s hair.
, Castiel nearly lies on instinct. Old reflexes die hard, especially when they may yet have cause to live.
“Ignore him,” Castiel tells the group, and Balthazar releases him with a roll of the eyes and a gesture of faux-apology. “You. Jake, was it? Are you the captain?”
Cas keeps watching him, because that’s what Cas does. Keeps their shoulders pressed together, because that’s what Dean started.
“Yeah, but, hear me out: when we’re old as shit, we’re gonna have the best produced sex tapes ever of us being young and hot. That’ll be- Oh, great, thanks.” Dean accepts the change of costume from today’s assistant and shows it proudly to Cas. “And we get these!”
King Michael rises from his throne. “Walk with me,” he decrees, and Castiel follows him away from the hushed whispers of the throne room, a thousand rumors birthed with his one utterance. They enter the private hall behind the throne.
“How do you want to play this?” Dean asks. “Pretty basic script for a double gangbang, but that bit before we get jumped, how do you want to play it?”
An hour passes with nothing terribly unusual occurring. One potential blood donor has to be sent home due to insufficient iron levels, and the other two go just fine. It’s a steady rate of people coming in, something to be grateful for on many levels.
He doesn’t mean to. In the part of his brain not tied up in the desperate demands of his body, Dean doesn’t mean to use this simulacrum of his best friend as a sex toy. He really, truly doesn’t mean to, but the simulacrum doesn’t listen to Dean’s waking mind.
“This is nearly everyone,” Prince Samuel says, gesturing for everyone to round up in a tight circle. From there, Prince Samuel goes around the circle, naming each in rapid succession. He introduces Castiel to his group. Andy and his twin Ansem carry blunted sword and dagger, followed by Ava with the daggers alone, Jake with long sword, Lily with a mace, Max with sword and shield, Scott with a spear, and Gordon with another long sword. That’s enough names to remember for now, and Castiel promptly forgets the names of those remaining in Prince Samuel’s group.
Eyes wide, Sam stares between the spill and Dean’s rapidly healing palm, at the thickening haze of something more than dust that follows Dean’s hand. “Okay, you summoned a nightmare.” Sam breathes out hard. “We can handle that. We-”
Castiel steps forward, removing his helm as is proper. Without the ability to raise his left hand, the simple action takes on new difficulty; the attached chainmail aventail pulls off his cap and tugs at his hair. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees King John reach over to peer behind the curtain.
“Yes,” Castiel answers, more than slightly confused. When he looks to Kelly for clarification, she looks back at him as if Castiel is the one responding surprisingly.
“The process is similar, yes,” Castiel answers. “While your blood is out of your body, it will cool somewhat. You might start to feel cold, which is why we have blankets. Also, the anticoagulant upsets some donors’ stomachs, which is why we have Tums. Ask for either if you need them. I’m also going to warn you that it’s your last chance to use the restroom for two hours.”
Then Dean pulls his face away from Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel focuses entirely on something else. Perhaps in the process of falling, perhaps from the cold, Dean’s chapped lower lip has split. The dark spot of blood stands out against his otherwise pale lips, his increasingly cold face.
“Back off, boys, we’ve got a mating porno on our hands!” Gabriel calls out gleefully. “Cameras in, everyone shut the fuck up, this is money in the bank!”
Beneath the trench coat, Dean cannot thrash. He can’t break free. He cannot breathe. He can only stare up at Castiel, lungs and dick about to burst.
“Say that again,” Cas tells him, eyes bright, and the fucking nerd takes goddamn notes as Dean points out the obvious.
“First, that an alpha shall be considered defeated when they are no longer capable of fighting! Any alpha who surrenders or can no longer stand shall be considered defeated!
, so, again, please be patient and perhaps go read any of the other 50+ works I've written in this fandom.
when I fuck you.” He switches sides and pulls at Dean’s hip, positioning him for the camera’s benefit, before repeating the process.
“My grandfather,” Dean says again. “My dad’s dad. He’s got cancer, and the chemo beats the crap out of him. They said he needs platelets, so.” Dean shrugs awkwardly, clearly avoiding moving his arms. “Here I am.”
With his hands once again freed, Dean covers his face. There’s no point. He remembers exactly how this dream went.
Grabbing weakly at the headboard, Dean somehow manages to lift himself up, to sit back against Castiel’s dick, his ass cradled by Castiel’s hips.
One of the assistants attempts to come forward with the lube, but Jimmy’s scent flares, and they both tense up over it.
Dean Winchester leans forward a little to put his lips around the thin metal rod. He looks at Castiel very intently until the thermometer beeps.
Jack scolded, Kelly returns to the kitchen to check on the green bean casserole and meatloaf. With nothing left to do, Kelly is finally forced to take a moment to stop and stand next to Castiel. She nudges his arm with her shoulder.
The scent, the sound, the connection of skin-on-skin, all of it has Dean turned on past any capacity for real acting. All he has left within him is submission play, begging his Master for mercy, for forgiveness, for a harder fuck, and all of it incites Jimmy to take Dean even rougher.
Castiel’s training intensifies, and it is at last suitable for the rocky terrain of their northern border to Lucifer’s territory, and even some of Raphael’s. He fights on foot, armed as best suits him, armored as best fits him, and he trains with a minimum of two partners. These, he plays off each other: one foe permanently kept in the middle, the nearest attacker serving as a shield.
“Oh,” Cas says, frowning. He comes over to Dean and wraps him in a tight hug, water still dripping from his hair and into the collar of his bathrobe. Cas holds on tighter still. “I think you’re right.”
A big thank you to Ltleflrt and Vyc for beta'ing, and to all you lovely people who have read this far.
That gets Dean a hard dick back against his face, softened by a thin cushion of slick fabric. Dean inhales deep and long. The fingers in his hair stroke him down.
“You let me whenever you want me taking the reins,” Dean points out. “Maybe think of it like… that time you had me come up with the best weekend vacation.”
Thursday night, the lasagna is finally gone, thanks to Cas’ relentlessness and many reheated lunches. After staring blankly into the fridge, Dean bites the inside of his cheek before making a dickish kind of food joke. He slaps some lunch meat and cheeses down on a wooden cutting board, adds a couple gherkins and pickle chips, then adds some pepperoni and olives for the hell of it.
Dean’s eyes widen. He scrambles to sit up and the trench coat lets him, just a coat. It falls down to his lap, piling against his stomach, over his soft dick.
“You were cold last time,” Castiel tells him flatly. “I’ll put this on your legs for now, and we can pull it up when you need it.”
“If it’s the one I think it is, all the dreamer has to do is bleed into the offering bowl after all the contents have been burned completely to ash. The last ingredients stolen should take time to burn, I don’t think you’re too late yet.”
Cas lets him go. Shuffles away to sit down at the table with a groan. Starts talking to the baby with exhausted fondness.
Music pounds from the wall speakers. Strangers chat around them. From the booths, at least two children are fighting over crayons and place mats. It should be too loud, but Dean’s presence helps calm the noise.
Throat working, Dean can’t do much more than pat Cas on the back while pulling back to grab some tissues off the bedside table. He sticks those in front of Cas’ face. Cas takes them. Pulls back, faces away, and uses them.
“Dirt can help, too,” Castiel adds, not knowing what else to say as Hunter scentmarks himself with Castiel’s sweat.
Still, by the end of the short tussle, both of them are breathing hard. They leave the alpha on the ground, accepting the dropped weapon and her cry of yielding.
Castiel rubs his left hand over Dean’s ass, the metal a welcome new sensation. “Hm, no. I don’t… Not enough restraint, Dean.”
“No offense,” Dean says more than once, “but there is no way I’m sleeping, knowing you’re staring at me all night. Besides, you’ve got better shit to do than holding still for six hours.”
It’s Cas who starts to wane. With each new check, he winces with the pain of clenching down. He holds Dean’s gaze with the same steadfast determination he holds Dean’s knot, but even Cas has to blink eventually.
There’s a split second where Dean thinks the slight to Jimmy’s acting chops was small enough not to be noticed. Then Jimmy’s reflected expression hardens.
“Dean, whatever nightmare this is, this is just a nightmare.” Sam puts himself between them, eyes on the approaching faux-angel as every crate in the warehouse rattles, as every light bulb explodes. “This isn’t real.”
Dean takes a good look around before giving Sam three options, less because he’s feeling generous, more because Sam circling back to ask for a back-up, actually single option would mess with Dean’s game.
All alphas present give their grumbling consent while Jimmy stands apart, untouched and untouchable.
Dean opens his mouth, and Castiel guides him back down, pulls him even further. Castiel pushes until Dean taps a rapid double-tap against Castiel’s ass, and only then does Castiel ease up.
Today, however, Dean simply returns to the task at hand with nothing more than a grumbled, “Just don’t melt my car over there.”
The announcer turns to the royal box, gesturing to where King John now stands. King John holds up both hands, and the entire arena hushes into silence.
Dean seizes around him. Clutching hands, framing legs. The comforting softness of his stomach stiffens against the small of Castiel’s back. His cock turns stiffest of all.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean says in a quiet voice, as if this is some unnecessary, almost guilty indulgence. Each time Dean acts like that, Castiel plays into the months-long joke all the more, constant in the hope that this will be what makes Dean finally relax.
,” Castiel snaps. “If I was dying, would you want to have an active role in taking care of me or would you be too overwhelmed?”
“Just five minutes,” Dean says as Castiel bundles various limbs around him. “I get a turn too. Unless you’re bored already or something.”
“No.” Taking his heart in his hands, perhaps more literally than he’d prefer, Castiel lays his hand atop the back of Dean’s.
Neither Prince Samuel nor Hunter immediately reply. Everyone in their group shifts instead, forming a line to hold against Alistair’s growing group.
“His father refuses to have the omega mate until his younger alpha heir is mated,” King Michael says, nodding to himself.
Back in their bedroom, Castiel tugs on Dean’s belt loops, drawing Dean along as Castiel walks backward to sit on their bed.
It’s a quick hold, there and gone, entirely appropriate in terms of PDA in a professional setting, and Castiel immediately wants it back. Instead, he has to pull back, squeeze Dean’s shoulder, and simply say, “Hydrate.”
This last finally jogs Castiel’s memory: he had been surprised by the omega on the training grounds during their visit. He had only seen the boy from a distance, but the deference of those around him had proclaimed the omega for what he was.
The minor show of coordination fails to intimidate the opposing line, but several let their weapons dip in exhaustion.
Once more, they walk through all the regular questions, from illness to travel to sexual contact. This time, upon being asked if he’d had sex with another man in the last three months, Dean answers, “Unfortunately, no” before winking.
“More if you actually bite him,” Gabriel counters. “Not to rush that decision for you or anything, but if you did that tomorrow, the paycheck would reflect that.”
Hands shaking, Dean pulls Cas in. Shifts on the bed, kneels up on the bed, the better to get Cas to lean against him.
An unseen force grips Dean’s knees, a force very much shaped like a pair of warm hands. As Dean strains against the grip in his short hair, against the bindings on his wrists, his knees begin to drag themselves apart. When they’ve spread as wide as they can go, wider than his dick and his jeans agree with, they stop.
After, shaking, Castiel wraps himself around Dean’s back. “I’d fuck you, but I don’t want to reward bad behavior.”
Nodding with the utmost seriousness at the Very Important Business of fingerfucking an alpha open, Jimmy begins. As much as Dean would love to watch the look on his omega’s face, the stretch is too immediately satisfying, and he has to put his head back down. Though Jimmy seems unaccustomed to both lube and the angle of doing this to someone else’s ass, this is someone who knows what he’s doing once inside.
Drying his hands on the dishtowel, Dean licks his lips. “So, uh. You know how we’ve been working on me asking for the stuff I want?”
Dean takes the second monitor out of Cas’ hand. Tries to. It ends up as a mutual hold, not quite a tug-of-war.
Clearing his throat and standing tall, Prince Samuel continues in a more formal tone, “A melee’s not a war, but today, all of you will take it just as seriously. This is for my brother’s happiness, which is my happiness, which is that of your future king. Prove to me my trust in you is not misplaced.” Prince Samuel looks around the circle, catching each alpha’s eyes one combatant at a time. “Any questions?”
