“Your limp was psychosomatic in origin, but the shoulder wound must have been devastating.”
“‘Well,’ I thought, ‘Shinwell Johnson’s good enough to do a job for Mr. Holmes,’” Miss Winter went on; “‘then mayn’t I be?’” She stood, stooping, as if the movement pained her, and drew her arms protectively before herself. “I thank ye, sir, for yer kindness, and I hope ye won’t mind it that I passed the money on to one as needed it more’n me,” she said —
The particulars of the arrangement made that morning soon became obsolete, for while Holmes initially meant Miss Winter only to draw information from women servants, or from lady clients too bashful to confide their troubles unless one of their own sex was present, we learned quickly that she was even more clever than hot-tempered.
Opening up the shop:
(and within him his real voice rejoiced, for
“To be my plus-one at social events with Rockham. Of course,” Sherlock said, nodding, setting off another round of retching. “Yes, I can see it. He provides cover, making me look even more innocuous” — he was mimicking Jim’s wide-eyed look rather well, he thought, given the unfavorable circumstances — “than I am.”
John’s at Baker Street a couple of afternoons each week; after that first trial, he brings Rosie as a matter of course. Eventually, because that day it is raining and the strap of the bag with all the baby kit has pulled his jacket collar away from his neck, so the rain has got down his back, and maybe it would be nice to not be so much of a donkey so much of the time, he asks Sherlock for permission to store some baby supplies — “Nappies, wipes, some baby food?”
What cesspit of spiritualist nonsense had he dredged that word out of? “But in your case the entity, though linked with you, is not in possession.” Sherlock took a moment to admire his own simulacrum of bogus expertise.
Thinking:
I was roused at an early hour from my study of the fungi of Aberdeen by Mrs Hudson, who had admitted Wiggins. The urchin presented me with a parcel containing flour, from which protruded a slip of paper, cut out of
Not in Rye! I knew perfectly well that Watson was not in Rye; he was, in fact, in the village of Aldbury.
I sighed, and surrendered. Quite often, with Holmes, I find myself sighing and surrendering — almost always, admittedly, to our mutual profit, so I cannot complain. “To have eight arms, like the octopus in that drawing you were studying.”
This wasn’t going so well, was it.
John has to concede that it isn’t, because Sherlock is tracing a forefinger around the edge of his foreskin where the head of his cock is just coming up, and John has quite strong sense memories of that cock filling inside his mouth, of Sherlock holding John’s head still and sliding himself back and forth while John opens his mouth wider and closes his eyes, coughing maybe on the first flush of salt at the back of his throat . . . And this. The
Holmes had no other cases, nor even any prospective clients, just then, but this didn’t trouble our pocketbooks: the times when we found ourselves searching every corner of the flat for stray ha’pennies were long past. It occurs to me now that in none of my tales of Sherlock Holmes have I described the economies to which we were often put in those days. I have given, I think, the impression that we were habitués of Simpson’s from the start of our association, but of course it wasn’t so. To consider the example of tinned meat, I will only say that neither Holmes nor I will have it in the house. And I remember the precise date of the morning when, in dressing myself, I realized that I need no longer sleep with my spare trousers under the mattress but rather could without incurring financial anxiety send them out to be pressed.
The soldier produced a small book, flimsy, printed on cheap paper and stapled together by hand. “This’ll do, yeah? Fadil gave it to me, but it’s his, I mean he wrote it. — Poetry,” he said heavily. “I don’t know Arabic, but he wrote in some of the translations for me.”
“Come back for your shilling,” I called after him.
“You know you’re bleeding all over Her Majesty’s roadbed?”
“— except, of course, in the one respect that matters.” Sherlock’s gaze slides down from John’s face. “But — ”
“Did you know her?” John asks. How much pain is it possible to experience, simply as a result of hearing thoughtful words quietly spoken? He’s long past the
John has just spoken the last word of Tranquilium when he sneezes; reaching for a tissue, he strikes the hanging bell charmed to produce Reflectio, so the Tranquilium he just cast is turned back on himself. But John hasn’t got migraines and does have normal levels of TKDT; the spell brings an abrupt halt to the neurochemical interactions that govern his magic.
“Oh, I’ll check, you’d best believe it. And — Will, is it? I’ll be looking into you, too. I might find, say, that you and Melinda are already acquainted. In which case — ”
Then he had lost his magic and his work, but that loss was nothing to do with Sherlock. All right, in some corner of the multiverse where he and Sherlock had never met, other events too would have changed. Maybe he wouldn’t have stepped into that particular corridor at that particular moment. Maybe he’d still have his magic. But then, in that universe of No Sherlock, he’d still have the limp, as well. So he was better off for Sherlock; as long, of course, as you discounted the grief.
This memoir being for my eyes only, and for Sherlock’s, I need not supply extracts from the passages he read that night.
“Unless you’ve got a better offer.” Watson was smiling; a little mental review informed Sherlock that there had been a delay between his “Oh” and his “Yes, all right,” therefore he must supply a deflection so as to avoid arousing inconvenient interest: “Sorry, just a bit shaken,” he tried, which led to a series of worried questions about head impact and loss of consciousness before Watson nodded once and said, “Right, up you get,” and hauled Sherlock off the ground gently and, considering the disparity in their sizes, with remarkable ease.
I could continue reciting the benefits of his presence at Baker Street, but the fact is that at the date of which I write he had most inconveniently learned of the existence of an adult cousin, a married woman living in Hertfordshire, and had gone haring off to visit her, wittering on about how glad he was to have discovered he had living family and so on and so forth. It was tiresome, the more so because the season was late winter and the flat was cold.
Sherlock thought, watching him go,
John nods. “It’s — it was one of my better spells.” If he hadn’t managed to turn it on himself, Mrs. Walthamstow would likely have been migraine-free for months.
“Well,” Rockham said, after a moment. “That’s ... reasonably astute, if it turns out to be true. And — again, if it turns out to be true — I can see why your skills might prove useful. Not easy to verify claims about the inside of her head, though, is it.”
Her gaze on us was fierce. I am not sure that it had occurred to me, before this moment, to admire her courage.
“Come on,” John Watson said, sounding amused, “stand up, so the rip hangs straight. I’m not much of a tailor but at least we can get you home without a breeze blowing through your tackle.” And then he blushed.
Sherlock’s well-learned disdain for the manipulations of “health professionals” asserted itself.  “Spare me the attempt to build rapport.”
“Your powers of impersonation are indeed remarkable,” Holmes replied, “but —”
“I think so. They left that note, and he had taken . . . twenty grams, wasn’t it, of alprazolam. If I find the same in Mrs. B. . . . well, I think they just wanted to make the drowning easier, you know?”
“Are we?” Sherlock said.
Indeed a gleam had come into his eye.
John has a question, too, one that seems at once stupid and vital: “Where will she go?”
Sherlock opened his mouth to say “Sherlock,” and then closed it again. They were walking almost arm-in-arm now, like a pair of Victorian gentlemen. Their strides didn’t quite match, and every few seconds one of them jostled against the other — this if nothing else should have been annoying, was annoying in fact — “Will,” Sherlock said eventually. “Will Vernet.”
Maybe Jim had played one of his videos for the webmaster, too, for Sherlock discovered that the counseling service’s site now appeared very early indeed in search results. One Saturday, and then again the following Friday and Saturday, and then on four separate days the week after that, Jim's morning minion arrived bearing not only Sherlock's ration of heroin but also a piece of paper with a client's name, an appointment time, and “Subject of Appointment.” By midsummer, Sherlock was seeing almost no walk-ins at all; a new sign on the front door advised prospective clients to visit the website should they wish to see the counselor. The sign went up on a Monday, and on the Thursday Sherlock learned that he was now booked two weeks ahead. Scarcity creates demand: this was not news.
arrives. Or whether Sherlock will want him to say anything.
“My God,” she said. “Has that been here all this time?” I made to help her to the sofa, but she had already collected herself; she waved me off, giving no sign of her discomposure but the deliberation of her movements as she hung up her things.

“But I haven’t got any jobs available,” Rockham said, and
— and saw to Holmes. The truth was that I had been eager to taste him from the beginning, but the telling of my voluptuous imaginings had taken precedence. With what greed I filled my mouth with him, how I worked him with my hand as I sucked and licked him, how I lifted my head away from him to tease at the opening of his cock with the tip of my tongue, and with my finger, and how he cursed me and seized my head to bring my mouth down upon himself again; how he spent, shuddering, afterward caressing my face so tenderly, until he urged me up to lie alongside him and kissed me with the kisses of his mouth . . . I will never have enough hands, enough cocks, enough mouths for all I want to do to him. I will never have enough tongues with which to tell him how I adore him.
“One. Putin has been selling his people a version of the Stab in the Back for years now.

“No,” Sherlock replies. And, scornfully: “I’m astonished that you ever believed such tripe. It was public revulsion toward

I pointed to the fire.
John Watson gave him a sidelong look. “Will Vernet,” he repeated, scoffing. “That would be your MI6 cover name, would it?”
John can’t think of what he himself might hope, for Rosie. When Sherlock rescued him from the well, and Rosie was brought to him, it seemed impossible to take any action other than to hold her close to him; he let her go only to Sherlock, and then only because Sherlock pointed out that he would develop hypothermia despite the shock blanket unless he put on the fresh dry clothing that had also been brought. John could see the logic of that. He had a child; he ought to protect himself from hypothermia. He would not have believed how difficult it could be for a grown man to tell himself this, to force his arms away from that small body, to raise his head from where he had pressed it against her shoulder, to dam the stream of “Oh, God,
“But, Mum, Beakley’s
Jim nodded toward the guard on his left, who went out and came back a moment later with a bag, which he slid across the floor toward Sherlock.
Ellis. I do have some respect for civil liberties.”
John cast aside everything but love. He took Sherlock in his arms.
“Mm,” Sherlock says, “now you’re biting your lips; I think”—and he wraps a hand around his cock, just holding it, which always drives John crazy, the thought of Sherlock feeling himself harden in his own hand—“it’s time you got your clothes off, isn’t it.”

“The kettle’s yours.” Sherlock has followed him out of the bedroom; John didn’t even hear him move.
had a pair of extra hands now,” I said, “you could set one pair behind your knees and use the other two to do this — ”
“Off,” Sherlock says in a few minutes, rolling halfway over to emphasize the point. John flails about for the discarded pants and manages to find them and wipe both himself and Sherlock off before he is even as much as half asleep. This would be reason to congratulate himself, which he is vaguely doing as he drifts downward, only of course he is interrupted by Sherlock, sounding perfectly awake and alert, and saying,
Holmes and I
But old men digress.
Superglue includes neither lavender nor clove but it smells, not quite pleasantly, like a combination of the two. It’s unmistakable. John has time to think how funny it is that just this once, his train of thought should be as fast as Sherlock’s, and then he feels sick to his stomach, and also as if he might faint.
Normally the minion didn’t react to Sherlock in any way, but this morning the power was still out, so he gave a contemptuous little
) but —
He tilted his head. “Who do you expect may come through that door?”
. . . The morning light was low and slanted and the air had cooled. Sherlock’s coffee had gone bitter, so he gulped it down to avoid tasting it. He tasted it anyway, so he ate some leftover chips to clear it out. The difference between the condition of having two bags left and the condition of having one was remarkable in its starkness. Between one and zed a gulf yawned, yet how easily it might be leapt over. The laundry would wait; Sherlock pulled on his jacket and made his way to Camden Market.
he said, wordless. He rested his hands beside himself; the blue-veined crooks of his elbows seemed to glow in the flickering light. His breath shuddered. His prick grew hard and his legs opened to me.
Even so I might have put him off, only that I had seen pass across his face a shadow of hurt. Holmes may pretend to court a housemaid, in the service of a greater good; he may, again in the service of good, resort to any number of trifling stratagems; but I have never known him to attempt to manipulate my feelings, for any reason. If I saw him look hurt, and saw him swiftly conceal the hurt, that is because he was hurt, and sought to conceal it. Of course I surrendered — though with the greatest trepidation, and not without mounting a rearguard action.
led me to a certain volume of literature, a particular favorite of ours. I felt sure Watson could be referring to nothing else, and while I remembered what word appeared on page 53 — appeared quite alone, owing to the poor quality of the book’s printing — I thought it best to check.
I didn't want to use a real living artist in this fic, but Jill Rosenzweig, whose work Sherlock is unwillingly moved by, is based closely on
He doesn’t, yet, think about the other question, of what he is meant to say to Sherlock, either now or once
Calm and rationality have ever been my watchwords, and my attachment to Watson is and has always been perfectly reasonable. He is not unintelligent, so he provides an acceptable sounding-board when I am working through a number of lines of thought concerning a case. He is appreciative of the violin, although he sometimes insists on hearing music-hall tunes that bring Mrs Hudson and Wiggins and even the tweeny into our sitting-room to form a sort of domestic gathering. I was never formerly subject to these.
He is a physician, whose skills have proven convenient more than once given the risks attendant on my profession.
Once the repairs to Baker Street have got past their initial phase, during which the air is full of particulate matter, John makes the experiment of bringing Rosie along; he and Sherlock work around her in the sitting room, while she stacks blocks and sweeps them down again, laughing. “Watson,” Sherlock tells her, “your studies of structural engineering have clearly been deficient to this point.” He had tended Rosie before, at Mary’s urging — her urging of John, that is, for Sherlock, though he had been tentative at first, had never seemed reluctant. The windows are wide open to spring and to the sounds of quotidian London; that morning, Mrs. Hudson moved back in from the serviced flat where Mycroft had been putting her up. Sherlock and John are drinking coffee from Speedy’s (new furnishings and kitchen equipment also paid for by the British Government, Personified) into which they’re trying not to spill any wallpaper paste. Sherlock turns away from Rosie’s construction project, then turns back again, frowning, to cup the back of her head; his fingers reach ear to ear. Not so much as two seconds has elapsed before he returns to the wallpapering. He doesn’t say anything about the moment, and John doesn’t either.
were demonstratively heterosexual — tonight, indeed, he had accessorized with someone blond, who just at present was allowing her skillfully-augmented breasts to brush along his arm while he moved one puffy hand in slow circles against her arse — but he also had a long history of what the
The thing is, John’s heart had lit up in the first moment at Barts, when Sherlock had done no more than glance up from his spellwork to say hello.
Sherlock thought,
The coils around John’s arm tightened, barely, then relaxed. A snake joke! John laughed. Ran a finger down the serpent’s throat, scratched lightly at the smoother, lighter-colored scales there.
Mycroft's geopolitical predictions draw on an exaggerated version of our reality. I found Tim Marshall's book
Wiggins’s broken fingers niggled at him, but he had two bags left, and plenty of Jim’s money. Tomorrow was another day.
Look back, and the woman following you up from Hades will vanish into nothingness again.
The soldier could fill that in for himself, and filling it in for himself would make him believe it more strongly and ignore what he surely knew, to wit that there was already a scientific understanding, to wit that everything Sherlock peddled amounted to a load of bollocks.
He had written his letter to Lord Curzon before breakfast was done, and so great a hurry was he in that when Meg the housemaid came in to clear our dishes away, he sent her off to the post office instead. It was with the greatest difficulty that I prevailed upon him to let me make a copy of the letter first, and grateful I was that he had written briefly and to the point, for while I wrote he sighed and drummed his fingers on the table and then sighed again, until I was tempted to finish by sending him to stand on a stool in the corner like an errant schoolboy. It would have been no use to point out to him that the mail to London would not go for another two hours yet.
— making Oliphant stifle a sob. His hair had been well cut, but the cut had grown out to shapelessness: “It hasn’t been long, has it,” and then “So young!,” because it wasn’t a divorce (the ring) and it wasn’t a dead pet (no hair on the clothes) and it
He stood beside the empty silent road. The moon, having been full the night before, should have begun its decline, but it rose full again, and the road lay silver before him. He watched along it, expecting at any moment to hear the Wild Hunt, but there was nothing; and then nothing; until, at last, just as the ground began to tremble, there, black against the moonlight, was a raven turning cartwheels in the air, at play.
People who phoned for appointments arrived, as it were, pre-convinced, even more thoroughly than those who had just spotted the sign and rung the bell on impulse. Sherlock shook their hands and told them how very welcome they were and how very glad he was to be able to offer his services.
On his way out he reached as if to pat Sherlock on the shoulder, then drew back just before contact would have been made, with a look of distaste. Sherlock couldn’t tell whether the look was real. He lay down and refrained from rubbing at the place on his shoulder where the touch would have come.
At this Jim’s face sharpened, as if a veiling had fallen aside, and something with foul breath showed itself for an instant before being put away again. Sherlock could not help himself: he took a step backward. Jim smiled. “Not friends? Okay then! Will, meet your new boss” — and he touched two fingers to the center of his own chest, lightly. His right canine had caught in his lower lip but as his smile grew wider the flesh was freed.
She circled John once, twice, thrice; and was gone.
Whether he had concealed the relief when his hope was borne out — that was another matter.
For Sherlock's withdrawal, I drew on a number of first-person accounts I found online. I learned about the three kinds of twilight from the Yearly Sun Graph for London, which you can find
Woman must have made that plain — and because Miss Winter’s work lay out of public view, so too did the changes in his views. Hence his exasperation on the day in 1917 with which this account begins.
The fix he’d been given in the car had now receded somewhat. Sherlock saw that his deductions were banal, also that he was taking the long way round to what any idiot would already have known: to wit, he had been kidnapped. The question why anyone would want to kidnap
Doctor?”
The soldier wanted to know what had happened to his friend in Iraq. The friend hadn’t been a soldier, he had been an Iraqi civilian, a translator, and they had met in Mosul; the soldier stared at the wall of Sherlock’s office and said, “And we, we —” and “I understand,” Sherlock said, it was essential to sound neutral, the soldier would be out the door like a shot (ha) if he found himself in tears —
The catastrophe strings itself together like the life-undoing inverse of that trivially lucky throw everyone makes sometimes: the chewed-up pen cap ricochets off the end of the bookcase and onto the windowsill, whence it bounces onto the rim of the waste bin just so, and in. Nothing you could replicate, however long you tried.
But Sherlock doesn’t.
If I’m right, we’ll make a great team. And if I’m wrong, well — ” He set his index finger pointing upward under Sherlock’s jaw. “So it goes.”
An alley, a startled tavern full of smoke, through the kitchen with a woman’s voice shouting after them “Leg it, Sherlock!” and then, heard faintly because they were already out the back door and halfway up a ladder to the adjacent building’s roof, “Who’s your new friend?” On the roof they caught their breath; then — Sherlock? — peered over the edge and tsked. “Still venturous? Good” — which turned out to be because they’d been followed too closely to lose their pursuers, who were even now to be seen surmounting the two buildings that bracketed the roof where John and Sherlock stood. There were four of them, and they had knives.
If it mattered whether the potion or the water came first, Sherlock would have said so in his note. John opts for potion first, in case it tastes bad.
Holmes, having read this over, reminds me that I have omitted a surprising pendant to Miss Winter’s tale. A day or two after her visit it occurred to me to wonder aloud how, given that she had only just left Newgate and had no money, she had managed to acquire the plain but well-made clothing in which she had called on us.
“And you can’t stay.”
Sherlock glances away. “An apology? — But why, if you feel it’s the correct course?”
Sherlock might have thought, had he been given to lofty thought; then suddenly Orange Jacket was visible in full, a hundred meters off and across the way from a longish interval of handsome red brick, aiming himself through heavy traffic at the Warren Street tube station; and now Sherlock did have a thought:
Sherlock’s attention on John was, like Sherlock’s attention on spellwork, or an autopsy, or mundane or magical crime, absolute; John, anyway, was already enthralled. Sherlock seemed as inevitable as rain or hunger. They had become lovers that night, and only a week later John had moved in with Sherlock, to the flat in Baker Street. Was this too precipitate? Perhaps it was: for, a year later, John has found himself invaded by unease.
he raised his head and stood and pissed and washed and dressed himself, because there was no one with whom to plead.
As one, we turned to her.
John’s rational mind offers.
Not only the so-called respectable poor excited his compassion. As we made our way home after the concert, quite late, we were importuned by a young man, a lad really, who — to put the matter bluntly — had nothing to sell but himself. (Curiously, we were nowhere near Piccadilly, where boy-prostitutes generally ply their trade.) Many men, of course, respond to any such overture with contempt; some few resort to violence. Holmes thanked the young fellow as politely as he would have a lady who had offered him a cup of tea — and then pointed out to him a constable in plain clothes who was stationed perhaps fifty yards further along and who, by good fortune, happened to be looking in the other direction just then.
—unfurl —
and wouldn’t wish to hear them.
He leaves the tired mother’s finger and travels, waveringly, upward, in the air, not exactly free, but freer, in the air, at last, to where he will have a friend, up in the open space.
For himself, he looks in the mirror and tries not to think the words “old” and “lost.”
Beakley hops right up.
The fox wheeled and leapt.
An Army man does see a great deal, so such things were not altogether foreign to my experience. Sitting beside the lady in question, who was by way of being a colleague of Holmes’s, was another matter, however. I hastily gave the album pages back to her.
The riders came on fast. He could not flee. Their hounds ran ahead of them, red-eyed; their horses had eyes of flame; he tried to see the riders but could make out only cloaked forms. Perhaps it was just as well he could not see their faces, he thought. He shook with terror, or else with the fever of the other world that he was so near leaving.
One day, John catches Sherlock’s expression as he, Sherlock, tucks Rosie into her yellow raincoat: it’s the careful concentrated look he might wear as he dropped reagent from a pipette, and the sight makes John laugh while, also, it squeezes his heart. Sherlock’s forty, and his unearthly beauty has worn away at the edges, but, as if in recompense, he seems at home in the world now, as John can never remember being.
“I’ll get another.”
On reflection, I thought (2) would be “wet,” not “water,” as making a closer parallel with “dry,” and similarly, in (3) the bellows had simply been the closest Watson could come to clueing “bellow” without deafening me. But as for anything further, I was chagrined to find myself at a loss.
Outside the pet supply store where the tired mother buys lovebird food, there appears a table laden with information about Greater London Lovebird Rescue. The table is set up and run by a young woman who used to be part of Sherlock’s Homeless Network and who now, being no longer Homeless, is simply part of his Network. Mysteriously, she and it manifest themselves about an hour before the tired mother goes lovebird-food shopping, and then unmanifest themselves a few minutes after the tired mother has bought the lovebird food and left the shop, having been offered, and having eagerly taken, a flyer:
As far as Delia Smithson was concerned, Sherlock had already demonstrated his supernatural perceptiveness, but even if she’d only been halfway sure of him, he would have found it easy to guide her toward perfect faith.
Holmes and I too sat for some time in silence. — It happens, from time to time, that one has the sensation of powerful currents, flowing unseen, beneath one’s feet.
“Perhaps you remember that not three minutes ago I told you I was conducting an experiment.”
“Oh,” said Sherlock, “it’s Christmas!”
“Oh, so that
“I used to ramble about London, being unable to afford most other entertainments, and naturally I soon discovered the booksellers of Holywell Street.”
“Aaaaaaand, you know, this has been kind of a probation thing we had going on, so far.”
Nautical twilight now, but the electricity still hadn’t come on. Cramp. He stumbled to the toilet and got himself seated. When he ran the edge of one hand down his back, sweat sheeted off: his hand hydroplaned like a car braked too sharply in heavy rain.
availed himself of toast and eggs. “We’re all looking forward to seeing the Doctor again, Mr Holmes,” he said, with his characteristic indistinctness. It has not yet been possible to teach him not to talk with his mouth full.
Jim let himself in at ten past nine.
“Well, Will — doesn’t that sound funny? Well, Will, well will wellwill. Something like a birdcall. I think? I don’t know that much about birds.
A black curl stirred, as if touched by the breeze of a beating wing.
“Not to Delia, though. You’re in her past now. Once a few days go by, no more top of mind for W. S. S. Holmes. Soon she’ll stop talking about you at all. Well, unless her symptoms come back, of course, but you can’t count on that.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. Cold shuddered through him; the room tilted. He took two steady breaths, fending off nausea. “You learned of some incident or other in which I demonstrated my ability to see through an attempt to deceive or to conceal motive. You want me to function as a human lie detector — or, no, that’s not it; you can detect lies perfectly well yourself. . . . Yes. Someone as good at reading the evidence as I am can ipso facto tell people what they want to hear. I can, in effect, cold read. In addition my accent is that of the educated upper middle classes. I sound, shall we say, credentialed.
“Why — ”
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, and then Sherlock could fix.
(How much I loved him in that moment! And yet I loved him at every moment, and with all my heart. Perhaps the paradox supplies an instance of those multiple infinities proposed by the mathematician Cantor, whose work Holmes has on several occasions attempted to explain to me, alas with small success.)
If the world were perfect, Beakley could go to live on the African plains where his relatives must once have lived, but he would not know how to conduct himself there. A wild baby lovebird learns how to be a wild grown-up lovebird. Beakley never got these lessons. If he must be a lovebird in a cage, then at least he can be a lovebird in an immense and interesting cage with some bird friends. What might the first item be, on Beakley’s list of “Things I would like in a friend”?
“Mr. Putin’s aims are more easily accomplished,” Mycroft went on, “if he can push Europe and the UK into tearing ourselves apart. So far his manipulations of public opinion and of political processes are succeeding admirably. But although I am certain of the general form the next stage will take, we remain in the dark with respect to the specifics of how he means to achieve it.” He turned to the chairman of the JIO. “Tell us, please, how many of your most valuable agents in place have been arrested and executed in the past six months.”
“Ah-ah-ah”: a tenor, speaking from closer to Sherlock than his own leg was. “I need your attention, Will.”
but he bit his tongue, and Jim smiled wider than ever and said, “What, did you think I don’t know that’s a bastardization of the findings? Give me some credit, Will. —Actually, give me a lot of credit.”
Rockham gave the blond woman’s bum a final pat and detached himself from her. Sherlock let a piece of his attention follow her stroll over to the drinks table, just in case. He had a moment of fellow-feeling: navigating Rockham’s whims might be less dangerous than navigating Jim’s, but job security was equally lacking. “Melinda,” Rockham said. “I pick Melinda.”
Maybe Sherlock is just baiting him. He’ll take the potion, nothing will happen —
“Shouldn’t we introduce ourselves first? Well, of course, I already know you.
“Oh! This is too much, it really is too much!” He was looking positively ferocious now; the bees might go as far as the Antipodes. I went to his side and took the paper from him.
It was Miss Winter, of course, who forced Holmes to revise his opinion of her sex. He inclined at first to think of her as a sport more or less in the Irene Adler mold, but she would have none of it, pointing out over and over what women were enabled to achieve whenever some small constraint was lifted from them. I believe that, equally with the force of her argument, it was her courage in maintaining her position although her opponent had the power to deprive her of her living that swayed him.
When Miss Winter had done, she sat down again, and in her own voice — though still in those refined accents with which she had surprised us — said:
— and showed his shining clean belly.
with it, it’s just —
“I can stay,” Sherlock answered. His right hand had come to rest against the side of John’s neck.
“I’ll give you a minute to get in the room, shall I?” John says to the space where Sherlock had been standing. “So, you know, you aren’t locked out when they inactivate the old cards. Because I’m considerate like that.”
, and John brings up as much spit as he can and licks wet all over Sherlock’s balls, the underside of his cock; he pushes Sherlock’s thighs flat apart and bites at the pungent crease where inner leg meets pelvis, making Sherlock yelp and leak.
He closed his eyes, counted five, then opened the consulting room door, smiling, and said, “Welcome!” to the woman sitting in the corner chair.
Bathtub. Puke into the bathtub.
“Oh, fuck off,” Sherlock said, keeping his eyes closed. “Talk talk talk talk talk. Why would I want to ask you any questions when I already know the answers?”
Sherlock, who didn't know, till John told him it was so, that the earth orbits the sun; Sherlock, who couldn't name the prime minister of the UK; Sherlock, who had never recognized a single pop song in the soundtrack of any program on the telly. Sherlock, who claimed no subject was of interest to him unless it had directly to do with solving crimes.
“Of course,” I agreed.
” and Sherlock, braced over John and parting John’s thighs to fuck him, had nevertheless managed to shrug — as though it was nothing. To heal a spell injury like that, just incidentally, as a by-effect of some other, and presumably absorbing, activity entirely.
“Yeah,” John says, “thanks, I’d appreciate that” — hearing his own voice muffled in his ears, himself flung as if in a fast current.
The disguises, the feints, the sob stories, the misdirections and the plausible smiles: they were the trouble. John felt always on him the chill of
At Baker Street.
. After all, Sherlock spent his entire childhood and young adulthood not conceiving of even a hypothetical friend for himself: the world was simply as it was, and he was simply a person who had nothing to do with the notion of a friend. It’s no great surprise that five ordinary children are incapable of imagining that a winged creature might prefer a life different from the one provided.
“Be still,” I said, and bent to kiss him.
He glares at her.
To spot the target would have been easy, even if Sherlock hadn’t seen his photograph, because Rockham was so exactly a
Maybe he already did.
John was looking at an elegant spell to make legible traces of DNA that had degraded seemingly beyond hope of recovery. That was a feat in itself — but more astonishing yet was the spell’s structure, for it directly incorporated mundane science. Such a thing should have been impossible. He knew what expression of amazement he must have worn.
The tech, looking worried, begins to apologize. Ms. Walthamstow, who grasps the implications only a moment after John himself has, says, “Oh, my God,” three times. John slides down the corridor wall and puts his head between his knees.
“Anything!”
Jim applauded softly. “You’ve got it! — Oh, and Will. You should get yourself cleaned up, you stink, you’re disgusting, I really. Don’t. Like it.”
out of John, borne on the sound of his grief, poured the gift of his finally unshielded heart.
“Really, John, is this a riddle, or a charade?” I asked, when the demonstration had concluded.
A good opinion of a margery-boy’s character! Perhaps my readers will scoff at the notion. But that was Holmes — he understood all too well what expedients men, and boys and women too, may seek when overwhelmed by troubles, and how little we ought to judge them. Too, I had been watching Sherlock Holmes for many years by then, and while my powers of observation would never equal his, I had advanced enough to admire the dexterity with which he had slipped half-a-crown into the pocket of Roger’s jacket. Roger would feel the coin’s weight, later, and perhaps wonder at his good luck.
The meeting had not devolved into a shouting match, or at least not yet; there was that much to be said, although the Assistant Undersecretary for Operational Effectiveness had, over the past half hour, acquired quite a remarkable stabbing pain in his temples. “The most likely significance of all this evidence — ” he began, but was cut off by the Foreign Secretary, who could not seem to keep it in his head that the Assistant Undersecretary was only fictively his junior:
O’Malley nodded to Bewick. They zip-tied Willis’s hands behind his back, and then Bewick took out his garrote.
to which Watson replied,
Sherlock didn’t say, resentful and contemptuous of at least one of the people in the room. He said something else, which was “When?,” and tried to keep the fear out of his tone.
Sherlock had nearly finished re-creating his flat from memory when the front-door chime sounded. The time was 9:30; at ten, he could go upstairs and fix and lie down and for a few hours stop gnawing at the tail of his own thoughts; the words “Shoo, get out, can’t you see I’m busy” were on his tongue before he was brought up short by the knowledge of what Jim would do if he breached the terms of his servitude.
“Yeah,” John says, and, a little taunting, “You get what you asked for”; he takes a grip of Sherlock’s balls to remind him to stay in place and brings his mouth down over his cock, down, all the way down till the head hits the back of his throat; comes back up till he’s covering just the head, dips his tongue into the slit and pushes at it; Sherlock’s hips hitch, earning his balls a yank from John’s motionless hand wrapped around them—“Bloody
Sometimes John catches Sherlock looking puzzled. Perhaps hurt. Then he smooths his expression and turns away, so quickly that, if Sherlock were anyone else, John would think he didn’t want to be caught watching.
“No,” I said. “But, Sherlock — ”
Lying down in the dark was not an improvement, and calling to mind the experience of rehab had been a mistake, because now the memory of Sherlock’s last conversation with Mycroft — no, of the last lecture Mycroft had delivered to him — was playing on a loop:
A wad of notes bound with an elastic round flew into Sherlock’s hands. Twenties, ten of them. “My clothing and shoes.”
John would like Sherlock to get the hell out of the bedroom while he finishes dismantling his life, but whether he asked or ordered or begged Sherlock to go, it wouldn’t matter: he would still be displaying a vulnerability he no longer wants this man to see. Shoes, pants, trousers, vests, shirts, socks. He had come out of the army with not much, and not much is what he still has: the cow skull, the Cluedo board, the books, the crockery are Sherlock’s. John closes up his suitcase and buckles his rucksack. He looks over the kitchen, just in case.
insincere. Every facial expression, every posture, every turn of phrase — they are all consciously learnt, with the aim of presenting myself as what I am not.”
for of course every secondary school history text had its three or four paragraphs about the animates, illustrated with a photograph of one such unfortunate and concluding with two lines about the abolition that invariably included the phrase “public revulsion.” The animate in the photograph was never exactly good-looking. But also was never ...
“Was he — ”
things, not yet.
He can hear himself:
Rockham looked interrogatively at O’Malley. O’Malley scoffed. “We went through the flat with a fine-toothed comb, Mr. Rockham. Found a locker key for a health club, sure, right on the hall table where you’d expect. Nothing in the locker. And nothing under the kitchen sink, for Christ’s sake, of course we checked.” He gave Willis a shake. “Inside the loo tank, too, you little wanker, in case you were thinking of sending us there next.”
“Namely, that my limp was psychosomatic.”
She had almost no education. During her four years in service she had gleaned a little general knowledge of the world — but only a little;  she came to us woefully ignorant. Once she had money and occasional leisure, she read with an avidity that surprised me (it didn’t surprise Holmes; he understood her better than I did), but of course she could never entirely make up the deficiency, and at times it gave her trouble with respect to a case. In later years this was the one circumstance that would reliably draw out a fit of temper.
His fever declined all that day; but in the evening it rose again.
Sherlock didn’t say. By the sink he could see a small stainless-steel dish, a jug of distilled water, and an NHS-labeled box of disposable syringes. How long had Jim been preparing all this with Sherlock in mind? “You’ve taken some pains to make sure I fall in with your plans for me. All right, I’ve fallen in. But it’s difficult to see why this project is worth the time and money you’ve already invested.”
“That concludes this meeting.”
I blush still to recall its title:
The performance would be more impressive if Sherlock didn’t look her way, so he didn’t. “All right,” he said. “To begin with, her real name isn’t Melinda. She’s Eastern European, Polish or Czech I would guess — ”
ETA: It turns out that posting a work in progress ... doesn't work for me, in that it just about paralyzes me with self-consciousness. I am not abandoning "Guilty," but I won't post more until the whole thing's done. Hopefully, that plan will enable me to finish sooner than I could if I went on posting chapter by chapter. If you've read this far, I apologize for leaving you hanging, and I promise a happy ending.
But old men digress, and the burden of this account is not a melancholy one — far from it, though it begins with some unease of spirit. So: Holmes and I were lovers, and still almost in the first new flush of ecstasy. Almost. For while I enjoyed our mutual caresses with my body as well as with my heart, there gnawed at me the awareness that another world of eroticism existed, that by nature I belonged to that world, and that I dared not express to the man I loved beyond all other persons — beyond even my life — my desire to engage in pleasures less commonplace than intercourse
Hareton looked gratified — of course, Mycroft reflected, the Home Secretary was out of his line of sight, so he couldn’t see her close her eyes and blow a silent breath out of her pursed lips. “This nation,” Hareton continued, “has granted you an enormous amount of covert authority — this, on the basis of your” — here he assumed an ironic mien — “unique intellect, wide-ranging knowledge, and unparalleled ability to extract accurate information from limited and ambiguous evidence.”
He was always careful to watch from under his lashes, because it was best to assume that Jim's surveillance ran to low-light cameras.
Rockham backhanded him. "Don't fucking call me Andy."
Sherlock — still muzzy from the heroin despite the reaction that sound had set off in him — floundered for a moment until the subject of Jim’s question became clear. “A hybrid, given that I’ve already told her the situation calls for an atypical exorcism.” Under his breath, he added:
“Watson, are our relations then to be considered in the light of a mutual easement?” S. exclaimed upon reading this.
“With not a moment’s hesitation! Too high to roll over, but you know how I found out your name.
The JIO chairman had remained in his seat. “Is Walter going to reenter suddenly, hoping to catch us in the middle of something compromising?” he asked once the latch clicked shut. And, when Mycroft shook his head: “I keep expecting him to question the reality of climate change.”
It was Thursday morning. Willis was standing between O’Malley and Bewick — for a given value of “standing.” His head hung down and there was blood, mostly dry, on the front of his shirt.  “I didn't steal it,” he said, “I don't know who took it,
“Electrician,” Sherlock said; then his long-overtaxed governor failed, so that what he heard himself say next was “Obviously, and not one of your direct reports but an employee of a firm whose owner you control. I take it there will be no more power outages.”
At A&E John gets an MRI, blood tests, tests of his ability to do simple magic. A child of three should be able to make a foam ball two centimeters in diameter hover in the air for seven seconds; a child of eight should be able to make the ball ricochet for at least two minutes between the walls of a testing chamber five meters by five meters. John can do neither of these things. The portions of the neocortex that should be lighting up on MRI when he performs a spell remain stubbornly dark. There is no detectable TKDT in his blood.
’! Had you indeed ever so much as visited that city, Dr. Huche? For otherwise I must condemn you as a fraud.”
Delia Smithson, naturally, assumed that he had paused to consider her problem. “Do you think you’ll be able to help?”
. The Sun Graph is the coolest thing
Sherlock could find, in his mind’s ear, the sound of himself, small, asking questions: Of his father, concerning the lives of bees; how the illusion worked by which paint on canvas could represent the movement of ocean; why one sometimes toasted cumin before grinding it, and sometimes didn’t, and at other times left it whole. Of his mother, how to find the area of an irregular polygon; why blood turned brown as it dried; why, if rust and fire were both types of oxidation, did metal not burn as it rusted. Of Mycroft: where Mycroft was going; whether Sherlock could come too; why school was so boring; how to make friends.
said Watson’s telegram, arriving later that morning. The solution of the puzzle having come to me, I amused myself by participating, though I had to concede the greater cleverness of the original’s wordplay:
“And you weren’t feeling bashful at all, you wicked creature!” he said, and kissed me yet again.
time as farce?
“It makes no sense to destabilize a nation where so much laundered money is, literally and figuratively, banked.”
“But — ”
“See? Even as a junkie, you’re quick. Imagine what heights you can aspire to once I get you cleaned up.”
“And then?”
The soldier nodded. He did not look up. He was holding his right fist in his left hand, close to his body.
“Oh, thank God!” she said.
“I’d clasp your hand in greeting,” Sherlock said, “but as you see I’ve no hand to spare.” He shuddered; John caught him up before he slid to the floor, hauled him into his room, and arranged him on the bed.
“Fine words butter no parsnips, Wiggins,” I told him. I meant to review the fundamentals of careful observation, but we were interrupted by the arrival of a telegram from Watson, and by the time I had read it and written out a reply, Wiggins had absconded.
I looked narrowly at Wiggins, and found that I had to congratulate myself on my success in teaching him the art of feigning nonchalance that is so essential to the detective. Mycroft had sent over a basket of tropical fruit, including a pine-apple; Wiggins having never previously encountered this botanical form, I deemed it helpful to his further education to learn how to dissect one, and sent him away with the guts of the thing, instructing him to do whatever he liked with it.
To the woman whose mother had died of Alzheimer’s three years past without their ever being reconciled: “She’s free of pain now,” Sherlock told her sincerely, “and it’s as if the dementia had never been.” Where was the lie? The dead didn’t suffer, being dead, and all the suffering they experienced in life evanesced with that life, had been less than smoke long before the body cooled. The lies could come later, having accreted plausibility to themselves thanks to that slippery not-untruth.
Sherlock takes the food out of Beakley’s bowl and scatters it around his cage and then covers most of it with some pieces of plain paper he unearths from among the Legos and stuffed toys and whatnot. Beakley watches dully.
“Oh, no, I think we’re still at the stage of hypothesis here.”
of him; it’s a funny thing to realize I owe a sort of debt to him, for if he hadn’t had his way with me I might still be a lady’s maid. But you’re wondering whether I
He pressed his mouth against the back of his wrist, like a mother putting her lips against her child’s brow, and swallowed the long
Sherlock bristled.
Watson’s telegram arrived somewhat later than the previous three, which was perhaps as well.
“Yes!”
There is a separate aviary, in sight of the large one but smaller and quieter, where newcomer birds may acclimate. The photograph of this aviary is accompanied by some brisk text explaining how carefully potential adopters are scrutinized.
Sherlock says, “But — ”
Jim had been smiling and popping his gum; now his face went still, he tilted his head, and Sherlock thought,
Sherlock burned with fever.
“A moment,” said Rockham, with an edge. “I’m not done. Why, exactly, did you come looking for me tonight? Me, as opposed to any other entrepreneur, and tonight, rather than any other time?”
“This” was a man in a boiler suit, staring at the floor and carrying a toolbox and a heavy-duty extension cord.
“You’ll have to learn one thing, Miss Winter,” he replied.
Jim said, “I knew you’d be good at it.”
it?” Delia Smithson did not sound entirely displeased by the idea.
But the fox was a shadow and then gone.
aggression? So the trick would be to manifest deference without weakness, to claim Rockham’s attention as if by right but without issuing a challenge.
I had my second cup of morning tea in hand and was looking out over the wet garden — the clouded light that had followed the rain made all the flowers seem to glow, like so many colored lanterns — when, at a muffled exclamation, I glanced over to find Holmes scowling at the
If you had asked John, before they became lovers, what Sherlock was like in sleep, he might first have scoffed—only for the sake of form, of course, for the sake of joining in Sherlock’s self-mythologizing—at the notion that he slept at all. Second, soberly, John would have predicted that Sherlock was a restless sleeper, waking in starts throughout the night; getting up, sometimes, to prowl.
There was a bag of coffee in the refrigerator. He rinsed out the French press, made himself a cup, and fixed at the kitchen table while it brewed. Seb, or whatever his name was, hadn’t blown a vein, at least, but all the same it was high time to develop genuine ambidexterity, a useful skill in many contexts . . .
Or: “Watson, you appear fretful. Perhaps the jigsaw puzzle is unsatisfactory, and a walk in the park would suit. . . . Bread is bad for the ducks, but fortunately we are well supplied with porridge oats.”
Sherlock says, again in that tone John has never heard from him before; “and then, so to speak, its reversal.” There’s something almost tender in his expression, John decides: this might be what Sherlock looks like when he’s genuinely impressed.
John stood up, carefully, and brought his wrist where the raven could grasp it. How strange, he thought as she settled herself and fluffed her feathers, that the arrow seemed to have passed right through her and that she had not been killed. Carefully he opened one wing, then the other, meaning to discover the wound and perhaps bind it with a torn piece of his shirt. How fine and soft she was to the touch, how warm the muscle of her broad wings. Metacarpus, radius, ulna, humerus: all intact. The raven neither struggled nor pecked at him, only turned her head to watch his moving hand and his face. John thought what damage she might do with her great beak;
Sherlock says, “But you aver that you experienced strong emotions at those times.”
John awoke with the knife at his right hand.
The trousers were Jim’s, when you came right down to it, not even Sherlock’s own. Jim had chosen them, Jim had paid for them, Jim would replace them with another pair to suit the persona he had made Sherlock assume. Sherlock reached behind himself for the chair and sat in it.
You need never have doubted the outcome of that night: you are, and have always been, the delight of my heart. And, for which much gratitude is due, a far better lover than you were a pornographer.]
It took me but a few moments to pull the locked strongbox from under my bed — my former bed — and to return to Holmes’s side with the book I had secreted there.
“Now consider, if you please, the present condition of the United States, and that of Hungary, and that of Poland, and tell me again that I overstate the threat to the rest of Europe and to the UK.” Mycroft smiled and leaned back, soft as silk, hands folded over his waistcoat.
Duane Oliphant made a second appointment. He thanked Sherlock; he turned the handle of the office door; he stepped out onto the pavement, dropped into the stream of people, and walked toward whatever destination he desired.
Thinking:
and, specifically, signaling to Rockham
I found my voice.
(Mycroft had replied, “If I knew, then, believe me, I would tell you.” That had been a long time ago, before Sherlock had discovered how to enhance his solitude with heroin.)
“Or maybe not,” the stranger went on, still looking at John.
(See the end of the chapter for
John thinks Lestrade was wrong, all those years ago, when he thought Sherlock great but not good. Sherlock treated Jim Moriarty’s crimes as puzzles, but he competed with Jim by solving them, not by committing murders even more clever. The difference now is not that Sherlock’s become good but that, having survived Sherrinford and with it the failure of all his attempts to shield himself from feeling, he seems to have concluded that there’s no point in having any shields at all; he is, though sharp-tongued as ever, extravagantly tender. “Watson,” he says one morning when she launches herself at the pen as he makes notes, “Watson, it is time we began nurturing your artistic sensibilities,” and goes out, returning half an hour later with a package of crayons and a sheaf of blank newsprint that he sets before her with a flourish.
A laundress, bristling, straightened from her steaming tub and glared at him.
What?
It was probably pointless to sever one puppet wire when he was kept dancing by so many. But Sherlock didn’t go to Warren Street on Sunday.
Jim disposed himself on the psychotherapeutic sofa in the consulting room, in an arrangement of limbs suggestive of the vapors. Sherlock had three and a half thousand pounds stuffed into an A10 envelope and this he fished out of the drawer he kept it in. He was glad of his choice of envelope: he could hand it over, keeping hold of one edge, and hope that skin wouldn’t touch skin.
“Why didn’t you tell him?” Because Holmes had not mentioned Piccadilly, nor had I; but I did wonder at his failure to enlighten Roger, for the boy might have found at least relative safety in numbers, and eventually even made friends.
“So remember: String. Them. Along. And that’s it for today’s lesson! No knuckle-rapping this time, and I know how much you appreciate the forbearance.”
Sherlock reminded himself that he was covered in cold sweat already: so there was nothing for Jim to notice. “I was struck by a cyclist on the Tottenham Court Road. There’s an NHS clinic nearby, so — ” He retched. The nausea was also real.
“. . . I suppose so. Nothing out of the ordinary.”
Then the shakes again, the toilet again. After his bowels had emptied themselves, not that there was much to get rid of at this point, he got hold of the duvet on the floor—he had the forethought to brace one hand against the doorframe, so though bending down made him dizzy, he kept his feet—and dragged it to the bed. His sweat had soaked the sheets days ago and more than once. They stank. His pillow stank. He buried his face in it and pulled the duvet over him. He wanted some heroin. There was no point in wanting his father or mother or brother, so he didn’t. He slept.
Like many who have faced one of Holmes’s courteous interrogations, I imagined that by revealing a portion of the truth I might be able to conceal the rest. I said, therefore:
In other ways, just as Sherlock’s flat was like any serviced flat, the business was like any business. W. S. S. Holmes, Practical and Spiritual Counseling, had a pretty website, dotted with inspirational prose and illustrated with a photo of Sherlock, retouched so he didn’t look as though he’d spent every waking minute for two years acquiring heroin and then, when he acquired it, shooting it up. And somewhere a PA replied to email inquiries and answered the phone.
Silence.
. . . Sherlock would drink any amount of tea in the morning, with toast if it wasn’t one of the occasional days when he liked to annoy John by proclaiming — preposterously, and John had cleared away plenty of sandwich ends to prove it — that he never ate when on a case. His habits around tea were erratic: sometimes he brewed it properly, with loose leaves in a pot, but he was just as likely to drop a bag of PG Tips into a mug of boiling water and let it stew there while he drank. He never seemed to mind that by the time he got to the bottom of the mug, the tea had gone bitter and cold.
There had been a time, a few centuries past, when Mycroft could have rid himself of a fool like Hareton with a whisper in a king’s ear — though, sadly, he could have whispered into only one royal ear at a time, and the chances were good that the Hareton-equivalent would simultaneously be whispering in the other.
Everyone on Lestrade’s team seems perturbed and unhappy about the case, so it doesn’t seem likely that any of them would help turn it to tabloid fodder, but someone somewhere at the Met must have a friend at the
“— but, as I’m sure you’re aware, this is an unusually complex case.”
“And now you’re going to see what it’s like to put that cleverness to use. I’m making a bet. I’m giving you a little hit of your new drug, Will: making the marionettes dance. I think you’ll like it. Better than heroin. Better than
There was a passage he had never noticed before, narrow, making a dogleg just where the shadows of buildings grew deep.
Sherlock did not trouble to watch him pedal away, but instead took hold of the lanyard around the short authoritative man’s neck and turned the badge to read it.
” she added, with emphasis.
He was never going to get away, and the best he could hope for was that when Jim was done with him the end would come with him kneeling somewhere anonymous with his hands tied behind his back, and a bullet to the brain: perhaps Jim had that much sentiment.
mincing manner,
that his anyway-rather-dull lover is, in fact, now entirely and literally mundane; anyway, there’s no point in talking. But Sherlock follows him into the bedroom and leans against the wall just to the right of the doorway. The room’s one window faces east, so in this late afternoon the light is soft and indistinct; enough to pack by, though.
“Can we abandon the pretense that anything about this situation is voluntary on my part?” Sherlock had forced himself to use just half his remaining bag, so as to have a top-up in reserve in case none was immediately forthcoming from Jim; six hours had passed since then, and Jim’s routine was wearing thin.
wash through him. But when he got home he found that Sherlock had left the milk out all day to spoil.
The body — if “body” is the right word — lies on the wooden walkway along the Ladies’ Bathing Pond in Hampstead Heath; in this exceptionally raw late December, it might have been there for days. The solitary walker who spotted it is sat leaning against the wall of the changing room, her knees drawn up to her chin. She looks bewildered — as well she might, for no one there, not even Sherlock, has seen anything like this before.
“I don’t even believe in this,” the soldier said. He sat perfectly straight facing Sherlock, but Sherlock was fairly sure that the soldier was not seeing him, or anything else in the room for that matter. No prizes for guessing what sorts of images made up the slide show in the soldier’s mind. Imagine, an entire city ruled by instances of Jim.
When he has caught his breath, John will raise himself on one elbow and, by whatever light the street and the moon provide, watch over Sherlock. If the moon is full and they have not drawn the curtains, Sherlock’s lashes will be visible against his cheek, fluttering perhaps through dreams.
Enlightenment at last. “I squatted down.”
This exchange had had its genesis twelve years prior, in the early spring of 1905. I have published only one case from the early years of this century, for in 1903 came the change in my relations with Holmes that I have already mentioned; afterward, try as I might, I found it impossible to write about him without there creeping into my prose a certain tone, revealing far more than was wise. This narrative will eventually find its way into the vault of Cox & Co., along with accounts of a few cases that may perhaps be found instructive or amusing at such time as Holmes and I are both beyond the reach of scandal or law.
“Chills,” Sherlock said, because to say this was not explicitly to beg.
“Yes sir.”
The serpent wound itself up onto Sherlock’s breast and raised its head to look at John.
“‘Weird,’ huh? Not that it’s any of my business —”
Regular users of heroin may become more sensitive to pain. In the past couple of years, Sherlock had had more than one chance to experience the phenomenon, so he wasn’t surprised when Dr. John Watson’s lidocaine didn’t quite stop him feeling the antiseptic, the cleaning-out of the laceration, or the stitches going in. He distracted himself by studying Watson more closely. The doctor’s limp was, or perhaps had been if this morning’s preoccupations succeeded in curing it, psychosomatic. But from the vantage of the examination table it was easy to see that — Oh, yes. “You’re naturally left-handed,” Sherlock said.
. At the moment, also suffering. John bit his lip and took up the snake.
Although he doesn’t have nightmares anymore, sometimes he talks in his sleep. He can hold entire conversations, which is how he accidentally tells Sherlock about one sad fragment of his life, or really someone else’s life, that he believes he forgot about, or let go of, months and months ago. Then he drifts back into the deeper countries of his night, outside which Sherlock must impatiently wait till morning to question him further.
is John thinking? Where can it spring from, this bone certainty that what he needs, Sherlock will provide?
With a little shake: “We’re partners, John. You should confide in me.”
Another silence fell; again, Mycroft broke it. “You all” — he let his glance skip over the Prime Minister’s secretary — “know what to do. Repair your broken intelligence networks. Develop new informants. Assign your best people to examine the reports and surveillance data we do have. My specialists are of course hard at work; I and they shall require frequent updates from you. Let us hope for the gift of sufficient time to avert whatever catastrophe Mr. Putin and his agents have planned for us.
Sherlock says, “This doesn’t — ”
The man had put his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, and now he addressed himself to the bicyclist: “Look,” he said, “you’re not hurt, whereas the man on the ground bleeding obviously is. Your bike’s fine, his leg needs stitches. Off you go, then, yeah?”
—Really, it is absurd to find myself playing coy, considering the subject matter of this account, and considering that it will be seen by no one but Holmes during our lifetime! And when, after all, the day in question brought to an end
John spends a few nights on Mike Stamford’s couch while he files the paperwork to register as magically disabled. The intake worker can’t conceal her dismay when she comes to the space on his Work Capability Assessment indicating what extent of magical ability the claimant has left; well, that’s all right, John thinks, since he can barely conceal his dismay either.
“Bang in the Uncanny Valley, yes?” Sherlock says. “There were better ones, of course, but the overall standard was not high.”
bedroom) to pack. Sherlock’s eyes went wide briefly when he saw John, so he knows, has deduced it that quickly, John thinks, or, perhaps worse yet, his extraordinary magic somehow enables him to overleap the need for chains of evidence and logic and just
A woman next to Sherlock glanced between him and Jim, frowning. She could not have heard Jim’s opening line, and Jim, having run through his pantomime of dismay, had unwrapped a stick of gum and was chewing it with evident pleasure; Sherlock’s face, then, was the telltale. “Well,” he said, “that’s quite interesting,” but he could hear himself, thready and unconvincing; he turned back to look at the entryway of the Tibetan shop and forced himself to relax his shoulders and assume an expression of phlegmatic curiosity. The gray-haired man, the detective, was bending sympathetically now toward the girl who had been at the till the day before: she sat in a folding chair, wringing her hands. She would have opened the shop this morning to find Niall. Impossible to tell, from this distance and with the body hidden inside the police bag, how he had been killed. A knife, most probably. Gloves would account for the lack of fingerprints on the handle, of course, and it was easy to picture the killer, shaky with the novelty of the act, cutting himself. As he pulled the blade, for example, from the dead or dying torso, he might have loosened his grip . . .
Sherlock sniffed at him. “You must at least be of measurable intelligence; can’t you tell?” And, when John Watson looked at him blankly: “Think. You approached me where I lay in the road after the Lycra Lout struck me. And . . . ?”
In the dream that had woken John that night, everything began as it began in reality. He was with Sherlock. They were in the mortuary with Culverton Smith, and Sherlock’s beautiful hair hung about his face in greasy rags. Sherlock was in every way disordered. His mind was in disorder, the armor of his perfect black suits cast aside, his fingernails grimed, his trainers stinking of unwashed feet. He took up the scalpel and lunged for Smith, John got hold of him, yanked him back, shoved him up against the wall of refrigerated dead, grabbed away the scalpel, slapped him. As in life, so in dream.
