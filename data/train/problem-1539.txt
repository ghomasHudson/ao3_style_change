He threw John down onto the kitchen table, John’s back hitting the worn wood with a crash. Sherlock swept what little remained on the table away with a fierce arm, more candles bouncing to the floor. John smelled sulfur as the flames flickered out. The room grew darker, save for the strobing of lightning outside. Sherlock hauled John’s legs over his shoulders and fucked him mercilessly. Thunder crashed. The rain tore against the windows. The wind howled alongside John. It felt as if the whole island were breaking apart and Sherlock was fucking him just right, pounding home at exactly the right spot again and again and again. John gripped at the table, nails scratching into wood. The both of them were slick with sweat and shining from the oil. Everything was wet and messy. Sherlock planted his hands on either side of John’s head and leaned forward, bending John near in two. John’s body bowed, head tipped back. He took Sherlock deeper. He screamed.
John let out a noise that was part groan, part whimper. His lips moved, mouthing out a curse that never found sound.
“Anyway,” Sherlock continued. “Impulsive behavior coupled with a mild alcohol problem made it difficult for him to keep a steady job in his youth but suited him nicely to fall in with the criminal element. A few odd jobs here and there. Good money. But his conscience always tugged at him. He never wanted it for his future, always looking for a way out.”
“Not necessary,” John said, handing the laptop back to Sherlock. “So. You’ve got the rental company narrowed down. But how exactly is the killer going to want to come after us over all the other people renting cottages at the moment?”
John had very little control over the smile that spread across his face, but he tried all the same. “So I’m moving into your bedroom, then?”
“Good,” he whispers. “The security system has been dismantled. This would be an awfully quick excursion if it hadn’t been.”
“He hid out in here,” Sherlock said. The rock walls took his voice, made it sound rough and booming. “He anchored his boat soundly and he waited. He scaled the cliffs when he thought we weren’t watching. He took his time.” John didn’t have to look at Sherlock to know that he was impressed.
John was calling his name, grabbing him, pulling at him. His hands were on Sherlock’s arms, along his chest, on his face. His eyes were darting across Sherlock’s body at a dizzying speed.
“What I mean is,” John said, the warmth of the wine making him feel as if words were leaving his mouth without permission, “if I was to be in a relationship with you, it would be because I knew
Then he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, bluer than the whole of the sky and more beautiful than the universe that surrounded them on all sides, and decided it might be worth the risk.
past it,” Sherlock snapped. “You’re getting married. You’re moving out. Any attempts at pretending that you aren’t absolutely gagging to do so insults the both of our intelligences. And some of us care about our intelligences.” He’d made a full lap of the sitting room at this point, ready to dip back into the kitchen.
John’s lungs were burning. The whole of him was burning. It felt like being back under the waves, spun around in the current, not knowing which way was up. He couldn’t breathe. He didn’t need to breathe. “Move,” John panted. “I need you to move.”
Mrs. Hudson did not appear to be hurt or in danger. She looked, instead, very angry. “John Watson,” she hissed. “What have you got to say for yourself?”
Sherlock tugged at John’s pyjama trousers and John scrambled as best he could to pull the rest of his clothes off. The bed creaked and clattered and John cursed. His trousers were still dangling off one ankle when he felt slick fingers at his arse and froze, gasping.
“Just checking on you,” John said. “You might remember I said I’d do that periodically. Headache’s back, I take it?”
Sherlock shook his head. Plan 17 was not a viable plan, no matter how much his brain argued otherwise. The pain was making him restless, but each time he shifted in his chair it felt as if a knife sunk into his chest. Or, more precisely, a bullet. Sherlock uncrossed and recrossed his legs, trying to find a position that ached less. However, all positions ached an equal amount. He winced, trying to exhale quietly enough for John not to notice, not that John was noticing much of anything at the moment. His brain reminded him about Plan 17.
John felt like he had been sliced in two. He was fairly certain he was bleeding out, soaking the sheets and the skin on Sherlock’s back with all that used to be inside him.
John needed Sherlock to kiss him, a real kiss. He needed to feel Sherlock’s lips on his, Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth. John needed to taste him, every bit of him.
it had crossed his mind. Earlier in the evening, he’d considered not telling her about the stag-do; he had been drunk, it was a year ago, and he’d spent most of that year not remembering it. Not really lying, that. Still, the thought of a lie that big made him sick to his stomach. He couldn’t have lived with himself, he knew. And after tonight—well, there was no way he couldn’t confess to this. This was too big, this was intentional. This was infidelity, plain and simple. This made the other lie, the stag-do lie, look like a little joke in comparison.
John exhaled, a loud, shaky thing. It still wasn’t a question, but he nodded all the same, eyes stubbornly planted on Sherlock’s hand.
It was still technically twilight outside, the sky a rich navy rather than a pure black, but the inside of their cottage had lapsed into full darkness. Finding the matches was a challenge, and even aided by the light on his mobile John managed to bump into every table and chair in the place. Sherlock, on the other hand, moved like a cat in the darkness, slipping upstairs before John could even light the first candle.
The sitting room was empty. The kitchen was empty. Sherlock’s bedroom was empty. John wasn’t thinking it. He
John felt a heat slide down the whole of his body. His groin pulsed, nearly moaning at the revelation. “You…” he swallowed. “You touched yourself?”
Somewhere on the island, Fitz was going mad, howling and yipping and snarling and running off somewhere, after something or other. The sound coming out of him was genuinely surprising for such a small dog, and John nearly jumped.
The mobile was silent. John could nearly see Sherlock on the other end, his teeth grinding together, jaw tensing and lengthening.
“You…” John’s memory was starting to piece itself back together. He remembered the boat, being tied up on the floor. He remembered the Taibhses and their guns, threatening Sherlock. Demanding the flash drive. They were going to kill Sherlock, John remembered. They were going to kill the both of them. “The Taibhses...”
“John Watson,” Sherlock said, his eyes glowing green against the pale blue of the twilight, “I will love you until the day I die.”
“Sherlock,” John said. “What…” he closed his eyes, opened them again, searched for the words, “happened? Just now. What’s happened here? Between us?”
As I mentioned after the first chapter, there IS a real family that manages the tours and guests on the Island, but it is not my intention for the O’Sullivans to represent them. I know nothing about them and I hope to god they never, ever read this. (And if they happen to be reading this right now...hello! I’m sorry.)
John sighed. He twirled his fork around the pasta and popped it into his mouth. “It’s delicious, alright?” he said, mouth full. “Still delicious. Still my favorite.” He swallowed with great effort. “And you’re still dead.”
we will,” Sherlock said, leaning against John’s back with his arms around John’s chest again, having long since recovered from the spontaneous kiss. John tucked his arms around Sherlock’s, gaining his footing a bit more with this whole
Sherlock gasped, and his whole body went rigid against John’s. John could feel Sherlock’s eyelashes flutter against his hair as he blinked himself awake. For a moment, Sherlock’s panic seemed to intensify as his brain took in his surroundings, his breathing kicking into overdrive and his heart hammering against John’s back. Then he returned, his muscles slackening slightly against John.
Indeed, John looked panicked. His skin was pale and his eyes were bloodshot and his hands were trembling. The whole of his body seemed to tremble, now that Sherlock was looking—he was practically vibrating with tension. If Sherlock had his way, he would have crossed the distance between them and wrapped his arms around John, held him close until the panic melted out of his body. However, Sherlock very much did
“Well,” Angelo said, brightening once more. “It is always good to see you. Especially after such tragedy.”
Sherlock sat back on his heels. His eyes were on John’s groin, where John’s plumping cock bobbed over his bollocks. “They kicked you here too?” Sherlock asked, although it didn’t sound much like a question. He ran a hand over John’s cock, over his bollocks. He glanced up at John, eyes a mix of anger and pain.
Sherlock seemed to have been awake for ages, clearly had already washed up, and likely already had his morning tea. John, it would seem, was to have none of those things.
“No,” Sherlock said. “But he’ll need regular access to it. He doesn’t come with the tours, and the O’Sullivans certainly don’t ship him over. No, this is someone with his own means of transportation to the island.”
John laughed. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, running his hands over the slick of his back, rapidly growing cool in the chill of the room. Sherlock shifted onto John, resting his head on John’s chest and grinning up at him.
“They know it’s here,” Will said. His voice was shaking now, teeth nearly chattering in his skull. “I tried to keep it from them, but they know now. If I can’t get it to them, they’ll come for it.”
Sherlock still wasn’t meeting John’s eyes. His eyelashes seemed damp. John found that he missed Sherlock’s eyes. This was all a mess—a giant bloody mess.
He pulls back but keeps his hands on your face. His eyes are the color of the ocean at midnight and you drowned long, long ago. “It is entirely possible,” he says, “that I love you too.”
Mrs. Hudson carried on smiling at him. “That one doesn’t like to stay here, now does she?” Her tone bordered on pity.
Dew had settled onto the grass around him, and his trousers were almost completely soaked. His hair was wet, plastered to his head. The soft breeze from the day before had intensified into a proper wind, sweeping over his body and chilling him. He groaned, rubbing at his face. None of this was an ideal way to wake up.
John wet a flannel and set to work on cleaning the wound. “You’ve got to be more careful, Sherlock,” he said. “And let me
Sherlock shook his head. “No flights for her from here on out unless absolutely necessary. Too much security. Too many cameras. Too much time trapped in a metal tube, hurtling through the air with a person who is possibly out to murder her. Ground transportation is safer, more controllable.”

When they returned to London, John moved himself and Rosie directly into Baker Street, barely taking the time to gather their things from his old flat with Mary. Mrs. Hudson had been thrilled. John asked Sherlock no fewer than a half a dozen times if he was sure, reminding him that he could refuse, that introducing a baby into the flat would bring chaos and disruption, that John was more than willing to take things slowly if Sherlock wished. Sherlock, however, had never been so sure of anything in his life.
John was interrupted by a grinning Angelo, sweeping over to the table to collect his plate. “Did you enjoy your meal?” he asked.
. He couldn’t speak those words of course—no language and all—but he made a little noise, a grunt of sorts, which he thought was quite impressive for his current stage of evolutionary development.
You spy him at a ledge, peering into a window. He’s got his little tool in his hand again, the one he used to pick the lock on the back door. He slips the shining thing under the window pane and cracks the window open with a firm jerk of his arm. You curse.
“Ugh,” Gilly said, waving a dismissive hand as she sipped at her coffee. “I don’t want to talk about Sherlock right now. Let’s talk about something else.”
“It’ll make for an awkward Christmas morning,” John said. His voice hitched as Sherlock’s tongue darted behind his ear. He refused to open his eyes.
There was traffic leaving the city, of course, but Sherlock wove through the cars with a speed that suggested he believed they were somehow impervious to physical damage. John flinched and clutched at the armrest, trying to restrain himself from shouting, cursing, or otherwise doing anything that might distract Sherlock in his endeavor to swerve in front of other cars, leaving only centimeters of space between them. John had offered to drive several times before, but Sherlock informed John that he drove like a gran. That settled that.
—and I couldn’t do anything to save you. I wasn’t fast enough, or clever enough, or convincing enough, or…” he swallowed, everything in him burning alive, “
smiles that meant he was using all his strength not to say something that would get the two of them sent back to London, while John tried out a more authentic route. “We’ll do our best,” he said.
John sighed. It was certainly too goddamn early for any of this. “Again,” he said. “We’re just shamming for a case. I’ve still got a girlfriend. Gilly, remember?”
Gilly blew her nose into her napkin. She rubbed at her eyes with the back of a hand, smudging her mascara ever so slightly. “I believe you,” she said. “I do. I believe you.”
be a mark. Sherlock ran his hand along John’s side, down his hip, curving around his arse to reach the entrance to his body.
Mary shook her head. “It isn’t,” she said. She cleared her throat. “And he…” She nodded in Sherlock’s direction.
“You don’t know,” John said. “Because you’re a dog. But,” he nodded in the direction of the loo again, “if you’d wanted… If you’d felt… For as long as I’d...” he gestured vaguely, then poked a finger at Fitz, “you’d be grinning like an arsehole too.”
“If I don’t stop,” Sherlock said, “I will fuck you. Make no mistake about that. I will slide my cock into your greedy little hole and I will fuck you until you can’t breathe. I will touch parts of you that have never been touched, I will make you feel things you’ve never felt, I will make you lose yourself, and you will never be found again because I have you. I have you now, John Watson. You are mine and I will never let you go.”
Ah. So Sherlock’s plan was to literally knock on the front door, then. John wondered what he was doing hiding out behind the house.
, even from across the way. John walked closer, dumbfounded. As soon as the cat saw him, it sprinted away, a cloud of fur in its wake.
“And you know my history,” Gilly said, dabbing at her smeared mascara with a finger. “You know I’ve been cheated on before. You know how my bastard of an ex lied to me over and over again, how he had all those girls behind my back.”
“You just told me Sherlock asked you to be his boyfriend,” Gilly said. A fat tear rolled down her cheek.
John shot back cursory responses to Gilly’s questions about dates and venues and color themes, hoping that would quell the sheer volume of texts. Every time his mobile chimed, he jumped, thinking it was Sherlock. He wasn’t sure his heart could take much more. He tapped out another text to Sherlock.
Then Sherlock separated from him—just barely, no more than a few centimeters—and touched at his shoulder and sighed against his lips and suddenly John was drowning again, devoid of air. He fell back against the mattress and watched Sherlock’s smile turn sad around the edges. Sherlock tipped forward and landed on his side next to John. John rolled over, paying no heed to the mess sliding off his stomach and onto the sheets between them. He wrapped an arm around Sherlock and pulled him closer, pressing their lips together once more. He wasn’t done kissing Sherlock—not by a long shot. Sherlock tucked his hand into the small of John’s back and it was still slick with their come and John heard himself make a whimpering noise that was just beyond his control.
Sherlock paused, stunned. He blinked. Once. Twice. And then he surged forward and his mouth was on John’s, forcing John’s lips apart and pushing his tongue inside and they were kissing,
“I’ll have Will come by tomorrow,” Darren said. “He can take it back. Take it to the veterinarian to be cremated.” Darren glanced at John, looking guilty. “Do you think you two can get the sheep in a tarp? Get it down to the harbor? There’s a wheelbarrow by the café, and with two of you it shouldn’t be too terrible.”
John wrapped a hand around the nape of Sherlock’s neck. He pressed their lips together softly, gently. “You can think whatever hare-brained thing you want,” he said. “You can think that narrowing the contestant’s choices down from three somehow creates a one-in-sixteen likelihood of being correct. You can think that the real prize of the lot is the goat. You can think that Monty Hall was secretly a cross-dressing mermaid who sea-witched his way into growing legs and running a game show. I don’t care.”
He scanned the field. All the sheep seemed to be present and accounted for, with no new carcasses to be found. Down on the sands at the edge of the island, John could just make out a line of grey blobs—the seals, resting themselves all in a row on the beach. He glanced behind him and spied the two donkeys grazing at the top of the hill. He even thought he saw a rabbit dart into a burrow. All living beings on this island were here, save for Sherlock.
John sipped at his whiskey. He could feel the warm burn seep through his body, relaxing muscles that were tired and aching from the hills he was unused to climbing. The fire was warm and the candles bathed the room in a flickering glow. John could feel himself growing hazy.
The property manager walked over to them and extended a hand. “Hugh Stoneton,” he said, grinning. “Pleasure to meet the both of you.”
“He had a family once,” Claire said. “He never told us much about them, but we know he had a wife and a daughter. Something happened, and I think they split up. I suppose he just wanted to get away from all that. Some folks are like that, after a split. They look for a change of scenery.”
“Five-point-five-six NATO bullet,” he says. “Fired from an M16 rifle, most likely. Entered in between the pectoral and deltoid muscles.” He peeks around at your back, looking for an exit wound. “Lodged into the scapula. Required surgical removal. Removal occurred just off the battlefield, with sub-par equipment. Sub-par medical staff. Sub-par sterilization procedures. Staphylococcus infection, and a bad one. You experienced fevers. Vomiting. Delirium.” He looks away from the scar then, up into your eyes. “They didn’t think you’d make it.”
John lifted his arm from his eyes. He glared at Sherlock, standing defiantly by his wardrobe, staring at him with purposeless anger in his eyes.
Mrs. Hudson shook her head, looking as if John said something so mind-bogglingly stupid that she hadn’t the first clue how to respond.
John opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again. He was looking for words, and Sherlock hoped that he’d never find them because they were unlikely to be any good. John’s words would only take him away and Sherlock needed him here, needed him here always now because what they had just done had forged them together in some inexplicable way and if John left he would rip out a large chunk of Sherlock and Sherlock was reasonably certain the blood loss would be fatal.
It was a little unsettling, John thought, how quickly he grew accustomed to sharing the island with only Sherlock and a smattering of sheep. It wasn’t
“Well,” John said. “He might have done. If I’d given him time. But…” John’s eyes dropped to the mattress again. “I saw him hit you. And…”
John’s hands gripped Sherlock’s face. They were cold and wet. Sherlock could feel John swallow, his lips still so close. Sherlock didn’t dare open his eyes, couldn’t look at the expression on John’s face.
Sherlock wrapped both of his arms around John’s chest and pressed his forehead to John’s back and John supported their weight on his forearm, his hand still lazily stroking his cock, whimpering quietly. Sherlock could feel John’s heart thundering against his cheek and was certain that John could feel his as well. The both of them were pulsing and raw, giving off so much heat it felt as if they might send steam into the night air.
John retrieved his own plate and sank down on the sofa. “Right,” he said. “Doesn’t exactly help me eat, though.”
John sighed. His hands flopped to his sides, fingers curling into fists. “Are you trying it now?” he asked. “Trying to get under my skin? Because if you are, can you please try it on a day when I’m not covered in pig stomach? I’m a bit used up at the moment.”
John was about to try his hand at a joke when the boat lurched again, tipping up and slamming over a wave. John felt the ground go out from under him momentarily. His hands dropped from his knees and scrambled at the deck, searching for some sort of purchase.
John sighed and smiled despite himself. The smiles were hurting less and less as the night wore on. “Why not?” he said.
John started the kettle and munched on an apple while Sherlock finished up in the loo and Fitz cleared his plate. Despite the confusion that still seemed to linger in Sherlock’s expression earlier, John felt oddly joyful—a mixture of post-coital bliss and general exuberance at the developments between himself and Sherlock—and nearly had to stop himself from bloody humming out loud. However, he certainly didn’t have the capacity to stop himself from grinning like some sort of lunatic. He caught Fitz—having finished with his food—sitting at the table and looking at him oddly, licking bits of beans from his snout.
“Right,” Claire said. “I’m going to go check on Conor, then.” With that, she took off back across the field, heading for the little white houses in the distance.
“Yes it is,” he says. “To the keen eye, the world holds no secrets. All that there is to know about you,” he runs a hand down your chest, your waist, your hip, “is written across your face, your body. Your clothes. The way you carry yourself. I look at you and I know you.” And he does, of course. Know you, that is. It feels the same as him shoving inside you the other night outside the pub, that nerve-screaming sensation of
John said one afternoon. The two of them were lying on the sofa, having a rest while Rosie napped upstairs. Sherlock’s head lay in the center of John’s chest. John’s heart beat evenly against his ear.
“Let’s say,” Sherlock whispered, “as a thought experiment, that you and I were behind one of three doors.”
” The wounded man poked at John’s cheek with the muzzle of his gun. “Remember what we said? Don’t do anything stupid. Unless you want to see how many bullets we can put in your friend before he stops wriggling.”
John grabbed at his hand, examining the bottle. “Mouthwash?” he asked. He laughed again. “Why in the bloody hell do you have mouthwash?” He peered into Sherlock’s coat pocket. “Are you Mary Poppins?”
“Breathe,” said Sherlock. “Breathe, John.” But Sherlock seemed as if he were having trouble breathing himself, his body shaking atop John’s, panting through a barely-functioning mouth.
When the bandage was set, John leaned back against the toilet, doing his best to steady his breath. The fight seemed to have gone out of his body. His eyes were closed and his arms dangled at his side. Sweat dripped from his forehead and his vest was fairly soaked through. Sherlock peeled his gloves off and lifted himself from the ground, hovering in front of John with an extended hand.
“I’m listening,” John said, but he wasn’t. All he could hear was the blood thundering in his ears and his own brain screaming at him to tilt his head to the side, to catch Sherlock’s mouth on his.
John tried at another forkful of food. It was getting easier, but only by degrees. “This is another apology, then?” he asked, motioning towards a lump of rice.
John had never been particularly afraid of heights. As a child, he would climb whatever trees had low-hanging branches, scaling his way up until the limbs got too thin to hold his weight. He and his friends would dare each other to perform dim-witted tricks on playground equipment, doing flips on the tops of slides and walking atop the jungle gym without hanging on. He had nearly fallen more times than he could count. He and Mary once took a trip on the London Eye early in their relationship. She had gotten a little short of breath towards the top, clinging to his hand with sweaty palms. John had never even gotten nervous. However, at the moment John felt as if his heart was in his throat. He could hear his pulse ringing in his ears. His gaze darted between Sherlock and the cliffs to their immediate right, the sharp plunge into the rocks below, the unforgiving waves. It wasn’t a short fall, nor was it a survivable one.
When John turned towards Sherlock, he was surprised to see that Sherlock had opened the bottle of wine Hugh brought them. Two empty glasses sat near the bottle. John raised an eyebrow at the scene.
You could get beer at the Tesco, you know. Much cheaper there. You could buy a six-pack for the price of one pint and drink it at home in front of the telly. However, something about that just smacks of defeat—like admitting to the robots that you’ve surrendered to their rule. You’ve decided you aren’t real after all and will start living as such.
John drifted back into consciousness with the recognition that every part of his body hurt. His neck was twisted, his shoulders were stiff, his legs felt as if they’d been stretched beyond their capacity, and his back was complaining at him very loudly. Even his arse was sore; John was not particularly sure what that was all about. All of that was dwarfed in comparison to his head, which was practically screaming at him, a fuming tirade echoing between his temples that would make a sailor blush. He wasn’t completely sure he still had a brain hiding somewhere between his ears—everything felt dried up and worthless at the moment. His mouth was the bloody Sahara; he would have murdered a small child for a glass of water. John pulled his eyes open and immediately regretted the decision. The room was white and glinting and bright, too bright, impossibly bright for whatever time of day it was. John had no idea what time of day it could possibly be.
Sherlock shushed him. “I am merely of the opinion that having a thunderous conversation while trying to remain hidden from any potential burglars is quite counterproductive to our purposes,” he said.
“Here’s one,” John said. “Little girl’s dog went missing a week ago. Her mum said he was hit by a car. She says she can still hear him barking, as if coming through the walls.” He glanced up at Sherlock. Sometimes Sherlock liked it when the request came from a child. Sherlock didn’t move. John scrolled on.
John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s chest and pulled him upright, shifting back on his heels so Sherlock was on his lap, sitting on his cock. He thrust up into Sherlock, slamming Sherlock down onto him. Again. Again. Sherlock gave a yelp but grounded his knees on either side of John’s thighs and set a rhythm, bouncing himself on John’s cock as John drove upwards harder, harder, harder. He kept his hands on Sherlock’s chest, guiding him, meeting the harsh rhythm that Sherlock set, speeding him up. Sherlock’s body jolted with each collision of their bodies together, the air knocked out of him, all sounds coming from him harsh and involuntary. Sherlock reached an arm behind him and grabbed at John’s hair, pulling at him hard enough to rip strands from his scalp. John latched his mouth onto Sherlock’s neck and sucked hard, biting and licking in turns. Sherlock might have a mark there for weeks afterwards and John bloody well hoped he did.
“And they certainly don’t care about the sheep,” Claire said. “I know they’re just sheep but…” she shrugged, “it’s the principle of the thing, isn’t it?”
John laughed, despite himself. “Well,” he said. “I can’t get rid of it. It doesn’t remind me of you. It’s safe.”
Sherlock blinked at him, his whole body still. His eyes blazed in the moonlight, narrowed in on John. He studied John with an almost predatory fascination.
You stare at him. You certainly hadn’t noticed any of that. “That’s incredible,” you say. “That little trick of yours.”
Sherlock forced himself to nod. It took a moment for his head to agree to move in such a way. “Okay.”
“It was lovely,” John said, tugging at Sherlock—who already had his eyes planted on the café, slipping into investigation mode.
The only sounds to be heard were the rustling of the wind, the lapping of waves, and the occasional bleat of a sheep.
Sherlock shifted, pulling a solid object out from under his back. The bottle of lubricant, long since forgotten. He pushed the thing into John’s hands. “Bedside table,” he said, gesturing with a lazy finger. John was closest to the bedside table now; Sherlock could no longer reach. It didn’t matter in the least.
You know you shouldn’t approach him—it’s not the sort of thing people do in this city—but you approach him all the same. You walk with your sea-legs bobbing on the train compartment as it rocks back and forth and you make your way over to the straight-line man with the deep-sea eyes, heart in your throat.
that John seemed to possess. He didn’t point out that John and Mary were spending most of their time away from each other as of late, driven apart by forces greater than the birth of their child. He didn’t point out that John stayed awake at half-three solely to text with Sherlock, that he seemed happier talking to Sherlock about nothing than he had in months. Sherlock didn’t point out any of that. He wasn’t an idiot.
John rolled himself as much as he could, his hands pressing into his back as he turned himself to peer at the person behind him as his eyes adjusted to the low light. It was one of the men from earlier—pale and bald and utterly nondescript, save for a small scar just at his cheek. The man sat heavily on the back of the boat, a gun propped lazily in his lap. His arm was stretched across his chest, a hand pressing into a makeshift flannel bandage on his shoulder. Blood leaked through the flannel and smeared across his fingers, down his arm. He was breathing heavily, his face contorted.
you. You’re so used to not being seen (machines don’t notice people) that the whole of it is deeply surprising. The man had deep-sea eyes, the kind that could either be blue or green depending on the angle of the sun, and his brow furrowed at you like he hadn’t expected you to drop even half a quid into his cup. You give him a little wave because you understand how this city can be. You’re a bloody doctor and you’re reasonably certain the whole of the population would trample you to death if you happened to be standing in front of them and an open Tube compartment. You can’t imagine how they treat the homeless.
“It’s not that he faked his death,” John said. “It’s not that he lied. It’s that he left. It’s that I—apparently—meant so little to him that he didn’t even think twice about tricking me into thinking he’d died, flying around the world on some little—” He shook his head. The word
Sherlock smiled, and then they were kissing again. John wrapped his hands around Sherlock’s face and Sherlock’s mouth opened against his and he tasted like the sea. John let Sherlock fill him, wash against him. He could breathe with Sherlock here—on top of him, against him—and nothing hurt. Sherlock whimpered against him and John kissed the sound from his lips. As far as John was concerned, the two could stay here forever.
Mrs. Hudson trotted down the stairs before them, smiling and shaking her head. Sherlock adjusted the lapels on his suit as John grabbed his jacket. This bit was always dizzying—the click and strobe of the cameras, the overlapping slew of shouted questions, the suspense over wondering exactly when Sherlock would snap and try to make a reporter cry. No matter how much Sherlock insisted on hating it, he seemed right in his element, dazzling everyone with his genius while John stood at his side, trying to keep things in order as much as possible. Still, there was nowhere John would rather be than by Sherlock’s side in all the madness, permanently.
Sherlock researched all of the different routes into Poland by car or train or bus and calculated out probabilities while John felt largely useless.
“Okay,” John said. “So I’m asking now. You were in a relationship up until right before you met me?”
fake,” he said. He stopped at a picture, a close-up of the woman’s face as she smirked at the camera. “The reason her face is angled in this manner is because she has a large blemish on her right cheek. The photograph only captures her face because she has gained five pounds and doesn’t want anybody to see.” He scrolled to another picture, one of her smiling over a pint. “She hates that beer,” he said. “She won’t finish it.” He scrolled again, stopping on a photograph of the couple smiling in a forest. The caption read,
“It wasn’t right,” Sherlock said. His fingers shook slightly against John’s shoulder. “If it meant leaving you, it wasn’t right. I never should have left you. I never should have had you think I was dead. I should have found another way.”
,” Sherlock gestured at the little tree blooming out of the top of the stone structure, “is the only one.”
The O’Sullivans were nice enough to provide food and other supplies for the two of them while they stayed on the island, and Claire went ahead in a small boat to get their lodgings set up for them. Sherlock and John followed on the passenger boat with Darren and an eager-looking Conor and Fitz.
“I know you didn’t want me to say it again,” John said, swallowing through a lump in his throat, “but I can’t. I can’t go a life without ever saying it to you again.” John felt his voice start to fade out, but he pushed on. “I love you, Sherlock,” he said. His eyes stung. His throat burned. “I love you so much. I’ve loved you from the moment I met you. It was so large and so obvious and I must be the biggest idiot on the planet that I didn’t see it.”
"What are we supposed to do," John asked, "now that this has happened?" He looked as if he very much expected Sherlock to have an answer.
John’s cock was nearly purple against his stomach. A slick line of preejaculate stretched from the tip of his cock to his stomach and Sherlock’s mouth watered. He bent low and ran his tongue over the glistening slit, tasting the tang of John’s precome in his mouth. John nearly screamed, and Sherlock felt John’s arse clench around his fingers. Sherlock grinned and repeated the action, swirling his tongue around the head of John’s cock. John’s hands flew to Sherlock’s hair, fingernails digging into his scalp.
“Yeah?” John hissed, stepping in closer to her so Sherlock wouldn’t overhear. “Then who exactly was it for, Mary? Because it certainly wasn’t
“They’re hideous for the environment,” Sherlock said. “And wholly unnecessary in the city. I’d much rather have the goat.”
Stepping outside to the loo to clean his teeth was a rude awakening, the dark of the night and the chill of the wind in stark contrast to the warm glow of the cottage. John washed up as quickly as he could, trying not to think about how unpleasant the cold shower would be the next morning. The cold woke him up a bit, but as soon as he stepped back inside the cottage and began climbing the steps to the bedrooms his body got the message and he could feel sleep nudging at him before he could even lay down. He trudged into the bedroom.
“You’ll keep the gun on you at all times tomorrow,” Sherlock said. “Even when minding the tourists.”
“They were going to kill you,” John said. His breath wasn’t fully back yet and his throat still stung from the water, the choking. His words were hoarse, effortful.
Mrs. Hudson did not appear consoled by their responses. “Why are they hanging on my wall?” she asked.
“And then I got back,” Sherlock said, “and I had lost you. I’d lost you. I’d never had you. I would never have you. I’d been wrong.” He shook his head, his voice shaking. “It was worse than torture, being wrong like that. I’d rather have been back in that Serbian prison.”
He could feel John looking down at him. Even with his eyes closed, he could sense John’s smug grin. “So you
“You’re cold,” Sherlock said. “You’re shivering a bit. You keep rubbing your fingers together.” Sherlock looked around the room, as if realizing something about it for the first time. “It’s cold in here.”
,” Sherlock said, “or if he has any accomplices. We must keep up the act at all times,” he swallowed, a moment of discomfort flicking across his face, “even if we don’t want to.”
“To see if we can’t get the killer to come to us,” Sherlock grinned and passed the computer over to John. “What do you think of this cottage?”
“Right,” Sherlock said. He knew all of this. He had absolutely no idea what was wrong with his brain at the moment, why all he could hear in his own head was screaming. He wondered if he suffered some long-term effects from that concussion a while back after all. He fumbled with the pouch, tearing it open and nearly dropping its contents all across the floor.
He loved Sherlock, John realized. He loved every little thing about him, even the infuriating bits. It wasn’t his mind playing tricks on him or excessive neurochemicals due to physical touch or any degree of acting. He’d loved him since the beginning, and at the moment it seemed to be the most obvious thing in the world.
The flash drive was tight in Sherlock’s fist. “I’ll need to know he’s safe,” he said. His voice wavered through the speaker. “Unharmed. You give him to me. I’ll give you the flash drive.” He paused, swallowed again. “I promise.” John heard the conviction in Sherlock’s voice, the resolution. He would do it, John knew. Sherlock was prepared to give the Taibhses their flash drive back, let them sail off into the sunset if he thought it meant that John was safe.
Sherlock’s hand shot out. He grabbed at the empty air. He forced his eyes open, searching for John. John caught Sherlock’s hand, perching on his knees just in front of him. He had that
Claire and Conor stopped at a cliff, waiting for the two of them. Fitz was off in a field, chasing a rabbit. As John approached the cliff, he saw that the terrain overlooked a moon-shaped curve of a beach, a strip of white sands broken apart by dark rocks that lumped along the shoreline. As far as John could tell, it was the only bit of beach on the whole of the island.
“He’s not the Holiday Killer,” Sherlock said. “Hugh possesses neither the intellect nor sophistication to carry out serial murders.”
“Um,” he said, straightening the pages in his hands. He picked up some of the papers that had fluttered to the ground after Sherlock kissed him, trying to put them in order again.
Sherlock kissed him again, a proper kiss, slow and sweet. He slipped out of John with a little whimper and settled himself flat on John’s chest, their bodies slick and messy, fitting together just so. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back and Sherlock tucked his head against John’s neck, sighing each panted breath away until their heartbeats slowed as one.
Sherlock wrapped a hand around John’s face, fingers slipping into his hair. “For the most part,” he said. “As I said, I become carried away.”
John glanced at Sherlock’s screen. He was looking at a photograph of one of the victims at what appeared to be an office party. She stood with two of her coworkers. They had their arms around each other, smiling. One of them was laughing.
“If I don’t stop,” Sherlock said, “I’m going to sink my fingers into you. Just one, just at first. I want to feel you on my fingers again, slick and tight and hot. I want to stroke the inside of you, slow at first, then faster. Faster. Faster. And then more, more fingers until you’re screaming from it. You won’t come like that, you won’t come until I’m inside you, but you’ll be desperate for it. My hands will make you desperate for it.”
,” Sherlock yelled back, staggering towards the man. John tugged at his coat, doing his best to hold him back. He was not being very successful.
Sherlock sat back next to him, paying little mind to the water that surely did a number on his nice trousers. He leaned in close, their arms touching.
label is a bit of a misrepresentation as well,” he said. “They’re not related, so far as I can tell. They just share a vision.”
“Bathrooms are just out the back door,” Claire said. “Toilet. Shower. No hot water though. Best to get used to cold showers.”
Mary bent down slightly, as if telling the gravestone something in confidence. “I promise I’ll take good care of him, Sherlock. I’ll treat him very well.” She laughed again.
Darren steered the boat into the opening of the cave, the little putters of the engine echoing off the rocks. Conor climbed onto the bow of the boat with Fitz, looking around in wonder.
“Shit,” John said, dropping Sherlock’s wrist to shut the bedroom door and drown out the light. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
John set his half-empty wine glass on the table with a bit more force than strictly necessary. “You did,” he said. It was one of the early times the two of them dined here after some case or another, and Sherlock hadn’t so much recommended the dish as practically ordered it for him.
Sherlock looked at John once more, his brow furrowed in a way that suggested John’s question was so inanely obvious that Sherlock was confused by the very act of asking. “Of course it was worth it, John,” Sherlock said. “It was worth it a thousand times over.”
“You’ve been on my mind,” you hear yourself say. The words seem to leave you against your will, and you curse yourself for ever having learned to speak. You certainly cannot be expected to make eye contact after a comment like that, but you can tell he’s still smiling.
You’ve got spots dancing behind your eyes and a steady stream of whimpers coming out of your mouth, pitiful little noises. Your cock slips from his mouth and he stands, towering over you. So close. He’s got his cock out of his trousers and he’s stroking himself. His eyes are on you. He raises a hand to his mouth and spits the whole of your release into his palm, brings the slimy mess down to his cock and starts wanking himself with such fervor his whole body shakes. He’s wanking himself with your come and
So Sherlock reached out to John—a perfect arm’s reach away. He touched at John’s vest, grasping the worn fabric in his fingers. The vest was old, Sherlock knew. Purchased before the two of them ever met. A thing well-acquainted with John’s body. Sherlock slipped his fingers underneath the fabric, familiarizing himself with the smooth skin of John’s side. John moved his hand to Sherlock, running his palm along Sherlock’s chest, against his ribs. John’s hand was soft, his fingers kind. His eyes were still on Sherlock’s.
He stepped out of the room, moved towards the bedroom. The room was dark and just as silent as Rosie’s.
“There’s a stone beehive with a tree growing out the top of it,” said John. “Only tree on the island. Worth a look.”
The John in his head—the one who wasn’t really sitting cross-legged on the floor beside him—already knew this. He nodded. “We did,” he said.
“You know,” Sherlock said. “Over half of the comments on my blog post agree with my position. By your logic, that means you ought to switch from your original argument. You have a higher probability of being correct.”
“Ta,” John said, wondering how having to wait at the one outlet on the island for his mobile to charge would impact Sherlock’s mood. He walked with the O’Sullivans down the hill and Sherlock followed after, looking bored.
“We’ve just solved one,” Sherlock said. “The case of the inconsolable child. Perhaps you can write it up while she sleeps.”
John’s hand was starting to lose its rhythm on Sherlock’s cock, his muscles stuttering just out of his control, and Sherlock replaced John’s hand with his own as he moved even faster against John. John flopped back to the mattress, catching himself on an elbow and gripping the sheets in tight fingers, panting as he thrust harder into Sherlock. His head lolled back, dipping in time with Sherlock’s movements against him. John whimpered and moaned underneath him, the whole of his body red and shimmering. Sweat dripped down his temples, his neck, his chest. Sherlock could nearly taste him. John’s eyes were dipping closed, mouth open, his panted breaths gone ragged. He looked to be in unspeakable agony. Sherlock moved faster, rode him harder. John cried.
Mary sighed. “I was saying,” she said, “that I’m going out with the girls tonight. I might not get back until late. Are you okay to do dinner on your own?”
A faint spray of rain began falling just outside the greenhouse, tiny droplets pitter-pattering against the thick glass.
he was coming through the ceiling,” he says. He seems far too excited about the prospect of coming face-to-face with a bank robber. “I
Sherlock's hands were on John’s back, digging into his shoulder blades. “Not this,” he said. “I don’t want this.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. He grabbed at the blankets, pulling them over his shoulders and removing his back from John’s view. John could feel his roots shriveling, receding into nothing. He took a deep breath. Another. Another. It didn’t seem to do very much.
what her name is,” Sherlock said. “Her name could be Engelbert Humperdinck for all I care. You’re supposed to be helping me with the work, John. What’s the point of you if you aren’t
John found himself alone in the room, blinking and dazed. He could hear the faint sounds of Sherlock moving around below, opening the door and apologizing to Fitz for making him wait and rummaging through the kitchen, looking for something to feed him. John could still feel Sherlock’s lips on his and could bloody smell remnants of Sherlock on his body and the whole thing had a bit of a ghostlike quality to it, the invisible traces that lingered after a person was long gone.
John took Mary to Sherlock’s gravesite. It was a fairly big deal—John hadn’t been back himself since Sherlock’s funeral. He couldn’t bear the sight of it, the slick granite slab boasting the name of a man who should never be stuffed underground. It was time, he figured, for him to visit again. He and Mary had been together for some time now. He decided that he loved her. He bought a ring. He was going to propose.
Sherlock—of course—did not, and by the time John managed to wrangle the pages out from underneath the cushions of the sofa he had received about a half a dozen increasingly impatient texts from Sherlock.
“Christ,” John breathed. It felt as if the room were twirling around him. His brain skittered as if on ice, trying to make sense of it all. Sherlock had jumped, had pitched himself off the roof of Barts, the act that started his two-year quest to disable Moriarty’s network, for
“Yes. Wow,” John said, releasing her to adjust his tie. “It’s hot in here. And loud. Is it loud?” He pointed off to the side. “I’m just going to pop out—”
“Yeah,” John said, feeling his face burn even though Sherlock couldn’t see him. “That’s what I mean, Sherlock. I wanted you like mad. And I feel like an absolute bastard because the whole time we were talking I was hard as a rock and wanking like some bloody teenager and you were just—“
Sherlock kissed John’s smile, feeling his lips part but his smile remaining. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and sighed against him and kissed him with all he had. Sherlock settled himself against John and took him in, tasted him, their bodies pressed flush together, tucked in each other’s limbs. John’s smile was still on his face as they separated, but it had an awed quality to it, as if a part of him had only recently realized he wasn’t still dreaming. Sherlock smiled back, nipping at John’s lower lip.
The woman cast a dubious look at his hand but gave it a go anyway, pulling on his hand as she heaved herself to her feet. With John on one side and her friend on the other, the woman was able to hop her way along the hill, flinching only slightly at the effort. They walked slowly, moving down the hill as carefully as possible. This was certainly not a place to be injured, John considered. The hills were unforgiving and cared little about the stability of one’s ankles.
John sighed. “Fine,” he said. “But keep the criticism constructive.” He crossed his arms over his chest, peering down at his screen. “Mr. and Mrs. Thompson had a problem…”
“That is a nonsensical premise,” Sherlock said. “Masquerading around in a falsehood is and never will be the simpler or the more logical choice.”
John didn’t mind when partners were physically affectionate with him; indeed, he rather liked it. Still, he usually had his limits. He could hold their hand for a bit, but after five or so minutes his hand would get hot and he needed to let go. He was comfortable with hugs, but if they occurred too frequently he would grow grouchy. He didn’t mind the occasional cuddle, but he often found himself needing his own space. With Sherlock, it felt different. With Sherlock, it felt as if it would never be enough. When Sherlock’s arms dropped away from his shoulders this afternoon, John immediately missed him. He loved the feel of Sherlock’s fingers entwined with his and would gladly go through life with the use of only one hand if it meant Sherlock was on the other. Even now, with Sherlock less than an arm’s reach away from him in bed, John wished he were closer. He wished he could pull Sherlock in, wrap his arms around Sherlock until the two were pressed together at all points, nearly a single unit. His arms nearly itched with the desire.
His fingers started along another scar, this one running just over the dip in Sherlock’s spine. The skin over the spine is sensitive, John knew. That one would have hurt. He felt a sick anger slip over his body, a desire to rip the limbs off of whoever did this to Sherlock, a feeling that was momentarily at war with just how grateful John felt to have Sherlock in front of him, warm and mostly in one piece. He pressed his lips to the raised line of the scar. He felt Sherlock tense against him.
“You boys have fun,” she chirped as the two of them gathered their things. “Some time away in the countryside, just the two of you, seems like exactly what the doctor ordered.”
Sherlock made a disgruntled noise but didn’t argue. He followed John back to their cottage, grumbling about the lack of progress for the day.
The kitchen looked like a crime scene, evidence of a struggle. The table was shoved to the side and one of the chairs had been tipped over. Cups and containers and beakers were knocked on their sides, rolled out of place. There was broken glass everywhere.
John looked down at the beach, aghast. Now that he was looking, he could see that several of the things he thought were boulders were moving, flopping around in the surf. He could make out puppydog-like heads and slapping tails, even a flipper or two. There was actually quite a bit of movement, in fact—seals flopping through the surf on their bellies, rolling themselves to the side with their flippers, even tousling for a moment when a mate got too close. Whenever a wave came in, the lot of them lifted their tails in the air, as if trying to keep dry. John smiled. He had never seen this many seals in his life, and it was astounding that they were just a few hundred meters away from him at the moment.
“I don’t care what you do,” Sherlock said, although from John’s angle it looked as if he said it to the sink.
“No,” John said. He picked at the label of the jam with his thumbnail. “It’s...nice.” Sherlock’s eyes remained glued to the ground, and John happened to find the jam particularly interesting at the moment.
“You don’t think I’d know how long we’ve been together?” Sherlock asked. He was teasing, but there was a hint of
Conor settled at Brennan’s side as he started the engine and steered the boat back towards the mainland, already keen to tell Brennan tales of how Sherlock Holmes and John Watson caught a werewolf on the island. Sherlock and Fitz moved towards the back of the boat, standing at the stern to watch the island as it grew small in the distance. John started to follow, but then turned back, glancing at Brennan.
, John?” He grabbed at John’s shoulders, spinning him about the room. “It’s been so obvious, this whole time. The flash drive is
Sherlock—the bastard—slowed down, slipping into John with painstaking movements. His lips hovered just over John’s—teasing, vengeful.
“Nothing’s exactly changed,” Sherlock said, “now has it? We’re going back to London. Back to the way things were. Before. You’re still free to leave, should you choose. And you should.” Sherlock blinked, the smallest flinch darting across his face. “Nothing’s changed.”
John was far too tired to be touched by whatever sort of gesture this was, but he was also far too tired to put up any sort of fight. “Fine,” he said. He motioned up the stairs. “Let me get changed first.”
, it sounds like he was certain no wrongdoing actually took place and is much more interested in buying your silence.
“Keeps me warm,” John said. He did his best not to dwell on the notion of Sherlock tugging at his clothes.
Sherlock pushed himself off of John, hovering over him with his hands planted on either side of John’s head. “And I love you,” he said.
Conor had called the wet of the rocks, and John found the term adequate for the hill as well. He nearly felt his feet go out from under him a few times before he met up with Sherlock.
John almost didn’t see him at first. He was perched on the ground, his knees drawn up to his chest. He looked small like that, a dark, slender dot of a man. He didn’t seem to be doing very much of anything, just sitting on the ground and looking up at the domed structure. The beehive wasn’t doing anything of interest, merely sitting there as always, the leaves of the little tree that grew out the top of it fluttering in the wind.
“Right,” John said. “You need to get some rest.” His hand abruptly left Sherlock’s hair and he sat back on his heels. “Try to sleep it off. You’ll have one hell of a hangover tomorrow, but I don’t think you’ll be any worse for the wear.”
“You could have said no,” John said. “You probably should have said no. Why didn’t you say no, Sherlock? Leave me to sort out my own mess?”
As if on cue, the waiter walked by again, smiling at the table. Sherlock grabbed at John’s hands once more, proving his point.
John come. He no longer cared that John was married, that John had a child on the way, that John wasn’t even
You glance around you. You didn’t get a good look at Black Jacket’s face, but he seemed to be a lean sort of man. Sandy hair. There are a few blokes in the pub wearing a black jacket, but none of them seem to have the same build, and none with sandy hair. Of course, the supposed bank robber could always be wearing something besides a black jacket.
“Yeah,” John said, hearing the bitterness in his own voice. “She is clearly skilled at running away.”
“Something Sherlock Holmes doesn’t know?” John let out a noise that was likely meant to be a chuckle. “I’ll have to take note of the date and time. Record it in the blog later.”
Sherlock ran his hands along John’s sides, traversing the motley assortment of marks from the Taibhses’ boots. “Does anything feel broken?” he asked.
That was how they drifted off to sleep, sweat slowly drying on their bodies, damp hair going wild in the humidity of the room, wrapped up in each other as if they had no need for anything else. Completely real, and in total agreement.
Sherlock furrowed his brow. He knew all of this, surely. Sherlock knew everything about everything. However, Sherlock didn’t seem so daft as to ask John why he was telling him all this.
John sat back on his heels. “It’s probably just a sprain,” he said. “When you get back to the mainland, ice it and elevate it. Should feel better after a day or so. Try to keep from hiking up any major mountains in the meantime.”
Sherlock finished drying himself and stepped from the tub, towel dangling loose at his side. John moved forward. He placed a hand on Sherlock’s temple, peering at his face.
Sherlock still had John’s face in his hands. He seemed to be collecting data, cataloguing the feel of John’s skin against his fingers. “Yes, you should have,” he said, and then his lips were on John’s once more.
“There’s nothing between me and Sherlock,” John repeated, although for the first time out of the hundreds of times he had spoken that sentence, he felt it to be not entirely the truth.
“It’s obvious,” Sherlock said, flinging a hand to the side. “It’s always been obvious. Your back was to the wall when you first moved into the flat—broke, invalided, unemployed—and your back was to the wall when you moved back—divorced, depressed. You tell me you
, so close, the match burning but the fire not catching, not yet not yet not yet. Sherlock’s fingers were in him and his bollocks—tight and aching—dragged against Sherlock’s wrist and his cock brushed Sherlock’s arm with each thrust and it was all so good he could have cried from it but it still wasn’t enough. John pumped his hips harder against Sherlock’s hand, whimpering into his mouth.
The journal slapped to the ground as John took off towards the field, his feet pounding along the grassy path. Ahead of him, he could see a trail of white, a line of sheep on the move in a herd, all heading in the same direction—or rather, all running away from the same thing.
Without warning, a figure burst from the bushes, tearing through the yard and towards the forest. Sherlock cursed and sprinted after the figure, gaining ground rapidly.
“Yeah,” John said, answering as if it were a question anyway. “Bit loud. Thought I’d come down and…” He actually wasn’t sure what his plan was, other than to get away from the spot where the nightmare had been. “Have a cuppa,” he decided. He moved to the kitchen, groaning slightly when he remembered that the cottage did not have electricity and—as such—did not have an electric kettle.
By the time John heaved himself onto the roof, panting and aching but still glowing, the music had stopped. The night was silent; even the rush of cars seemed to fade away. John pushed himself over the ledge and rolled onto his back on the rough tile of the roof, allowing himself a moment to catch his breath. The stars hovered above him in greeting. It was nice to see them again, so close and loud. John pushed himself to his feet.
You sit up, watching him as he practically leaps into his trousers. Every bit of skin slipping into clothes and away from your sight is breaking your heart. You’re losing him once more, and you categorically are not ready.
“The case is over,” John said. “You’ll be wanting to sleep. That’s your pattern. You only sleep out on the sofa when I’m in the sitting room. Which, at the moment, I’m not. You prefer your bed to the sofa, anyway. So get in.”
He looks at you as if you just asked the most idiotic question in the world. “Of course,” he says, gesturing to the various spots on the floor where your clothing fell. “I’d quite wondered why you weren’t already dressed.
Mrs. Hudson smiled, her lips pursed into a secretive little smirk. “Well,” she said, “it was rather obvious, now wasn’t it?”
He felt as if he might be sick. He folded in double, coughing, catching himself with a hand on the wall. Another memory—his palms pressed to a wall, fingernails digging into the brick, holding himself upright, pushing back against—
Sherlock moved the head of his cock around the rim of John’s hole, teasing. “You’ll keep quiet?” he asked.
“When you came back,” John said. “Back from the dead. When you found me in that restaurant. With Mary. Were you wanting…” John swallowed. “Did you want to…be with me?”
“So,” John said. “I’m not saying that what you did here was excusable, because it certainly wasn’t. And I’m not saying that you haven’t done plenty to fuck over our marriage, because you certainly have. But even if you hadn’t done any of those things,” John shook his head, “we never would have worked, Mary. I was never going to be entirely yours because I didn’t come to you that way.”
The wind picked up a bit, teasing John’s hair from his face and pricking at his eyes. In front of him, he could see Sherlock’s curls rippling in the wind. His coattails fluttered. The sun still shone brightly upon them, but there was a much more distinct chill in the air. John zipped his coat up to his chin and sunk his hands in his pockets.
“Probably not,” Sherlock said, “considering that ghosts—I am afraid to report, my dear Watson—are not real.”
John was not going to think about how he nearly stayed. He was not going to think about how he nearly shucked his clothes right off again and crawled back onto the bed with Sherlock. He was not going to think about how he nearly pushed Sherlock down on the mattress and kissed him until the broken look was gone off his face, preferably forever.
“Good,” the man said. He turned, gazing back at the island. “I’ll see you soon, Mister Holmes.” With that, he pressed
“How about this?” John asked. He was starting to get to the old cases now, ones that probably had already solved themselves. “A woman’s husband up and vanished—just
“I understand what this is, John,” Sherlock said. He remained facing away, his scarred back a wall between them. “Trust me, I of all people understand. I understand what it’s like to be lonely. What it’s like not to see a caring face in your midst for months at a time. I understand what it’s like to realize that you crave the presence of another person so palpably you would near kill for it. I understand how it can play tricks on your mind, how it can make your thoughts turn to the nearest potential partner, the only constant you had in your life before, and think…” Sherlock swallowed. “But it isn’t real, John. It’s just a trick. The dolphin and the fisherman. It looks convincing, but it is fake. It is in everyone’s best interest to simply move on.” Sherlock’s voice dipped into something sour. “Something I doubt you will have any difficulty with, in the end.”
Sherlock sighed, a noise he hoped would communicate that he was too tired to relay all the ways he could tell that John was lying. “You’re going back to her,” he repeated.
. And later, right before we—” Sherlock waved a hand, “you asked me if I knew how long you’ve wanted this.”
“I can’t leave,” John said. “We’re on a deserted island, remember? Need a boat to get to the mainland. And I don’t exactly fancy a swim at the moment.”
You’re rendered down to blinking again. It feels a bit like open-heart surgery, this. Skin peeled back, ribs cracked open, soft pumping bits cooling in the evening air. His eyes are boring into you, and he doesn’t just
He moved forward, catching Sherlock’s lips with his own. He didn’t want their last kiss to be the last. He hadn’t been prepared. He needed warning before it was all to be over, so he could take care to remember the feel of Sherlock’s lips against his, the way his breath stuttered when John moved his tongue just so.
“I’ll charge it when I get back to the cottage,” John said. He slowed, glancing behind him to Sherlock, who seemed thrown off-kilter by his departure. “I trust that you won’t manage to kill yourself while I’m away?”
Bed. The most likely conclusion was that he was in a bed. This led Sherlock to believe that he was not, in fact, flying, despite how much the whole of his body felt like it was.
John sighed and walked over to the laptop that Sherlock left sitting on the desk back when he was capable of complex motor functions. John lifted the lid and tapped at some buttons. He leaned against the desk, the weight of his body resting against his right palm as his left scrolled through something or other on the computer. His brow furrowed. He frowned. So many voluntary movements, so many muscle groups activated. How lucky John was.
“Just bringing up the post,” Mrs. Hudson said, a bustle of energy striding through the door into the sitting room. “You’re both up so early this morning, I thought—
“He has,” the man says. “He’ll take a Newcastle.” It’s what you were drinking before. It’s what you order every time you come here.
“Do you remember anything from last night?” John asked Sherlock as the two of them looked for a cab outside of New Scotland Yard. The street was impossibly loud. How had John never noticed how bloody loud London was?
“You’d look at them, of course,” Sherlock said. It was a rather obvious thing to say. The wheels in his head skidded over a puddle.
Sherlock cleared his throat. He turned his back to John in a way that seemed purposeful, pretending to examine the photographs of the mutilated sheep on the wall. “A valid perspective, I suppose,” Sherlock said. His voice sounded a bit odd.
John swallowed. “Is that how you got…?” John gestured with his chin, hoping it would be enough of a communication without actually having to speak the word
When Sherlock’s hand wrapped around John’s cock, John let out a cry that was louder than the rain. He tightened his own hand around Sherlock’s, guiding him as he stroked, smearing oil down his cock until the taut skin shone in the candlelight. The touch would become too good too soon, John knew. He muttered something to Sherlock, some message of urgency. Sherlock’s eyes flickered and his hand dropped lower, disappearing between John’s legs.
“And do you?” Sherlock asked. He couldn’t hear his own words over the spray of the falls, the screaming in his ears.
“I am afraid to tell you,” Sherlock said, “that your analysis of the situation has led you to erroneous conclusions. It wouldn’t be the first time—surely you must be used to it by now.”
Sherlock sank his mouth into John’s and John made a contented noise and slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist and then Sherlock wasn’t aware of anything else, not the hum of the city around them, not the honks and screeches of cars passing by, not the hoots and jeers from the pedestrians and flat-dwellers in the area, not the red and blue lights flickering onto their faces from the police car parked at the end of the alley, and certainly not the uncomfortable shouts of the policeman, trying to get their attention as he slowly approached.
“I’m not sure you’re as skilled as Toby,” Sherlock was saying to Fitz, “but we’ll give you a try all the same.”
John washed up as quickly as he could and munched on a piece of bread while he donned whatever remained from the clean clothes he brought. He hoped that they would catch this sheep killer sooner rather than later, before one of them would need to attempt doing the wash in a sink. John certainly wasn’t willing to attempt to wash Sherlock’s posh clothes by hand, and something told him Sherlock wasn’t about to put forth the effort either.
