And then there was James Moriarty. The only man in the town other than Sherlock himself that was single and uninterested in female attentions.
"Put this on, the wear your button-down overtop and leave it untucked and open." Sherlock turned back to the mirror on his wall, fussing with his hair again. He watched his brother in the mirror as he glared at the shirt for a moment before pulling at the buttons of his shirt.
“Hey Mate! How’re you feeling?” John blinked against the harsh hospital lighting, pushing himself into a sitting position.
He felt the burning heat of the falling rock brushing against his back as his vessel narrowly evaded it.
"No. No. Absolutely not. No." John laughed, shifting closer and nuzzling into the crook of Sherlock's neck, searching for that one spot he had found the other day that always made Sherlock turn into a quivering mass of limbs. "J-John-"
“Shut up! I’m in the middle of something!” He snapped, sending her a dark glare before turning his attention back to John.
The young man’s lungs stayed clear and the infection started to fade, but he still didn’t wake up. John was beginning to get concerned when he heard a soft moan come from the pale boy. He stopped reading and sat up, pressing the back of his paw to his cheek, testing his temperature. Sherlock had developed a fever shortly after John had cleared his lungs.
“It’s not like the dramatizations, is it little brother?” A voice cut through his mind, the ghostly image of a man, not much older than himself, appearing before him. “There’s no huge spurt of blood, you don’t go flying back into the wall. It just, happens.”
Sherlock’s chest seemed to cave in on itself, nearly tearing his heart in two. Mycroft was right, he saw it back on E3. When John was talking with Mike, he looked sad, but there was a hollowness to his eyes that Sherlock had wished away, not acknowledging it.
“Yes, but I want to hear you say it. I can only imagine what it sounds like in that dark voice of yours.”
He didn’t mind the prep, having his hair and makeup done, being shown what was expected of him and where he was supposed to go. He found it relaxing.
"You look lost." Sherlock started at the voice that had appeared at his side, cursing himself for getting distracted. He sent a glare at the new-comer, his mind screeching to a stop as his eyes met steel ones. "Something wrong Gorgeous?"
He must have passed out, because he was shocked to consciousness by the clinking of fine china and the excited whisper of a child.
A/N I made Irene Adler the wardrobe because she is gay (in the show) and if she is the wardrobe that means she is essentially stuck in the closet....;) hahaha
Sherlock set his phone on the desk in front of him, leaning back in his chair and chewing the side of one of his fingers.
"They don't now. I made it very clear that anyone who says anything remotely close to that again will wind up just like him." Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but was distracted by John's lips pressing against his own. "You're mine, Sherlock Holmes, and I don't like sharing my things, not even in people's minds."
“Y-You?” He heard Mikey’s voice, but didn’t turn, trying desperately to ignore his friend. “H-How- I-I don’t-” John heard a scuffle and a soft grunt, but continued fighting with the ropes.
“The thought of living, of fighting through every day like I have since I was a teen, makes me so tired. I don’t want to do it anymore.” John continued to press kisses to Sherlock’s lips, even though the Siren was fighting every urge to respond. John was the only being in the universe that could shut Sherlock’s mind down with just a kiss and he knew it. “Tell you what, let’s go get that burn healed, then I will give you one week to try to talk me out of it-”
His hands tangled in Sherlock’s curls and he pulled the Siren’s face to meet his own in a tender kiss.
"He wouldn't, and if I suddenly decide that I need to leave, I know that John will drop everything to get me out of there. I'll be fine Mycroft, the whole Rugby team is going to be there, so if anyone messes with me, I have a small army to back me up." Sherlock could see the concern in his older brother's eyes, and pushed down the urge to hug the taller boy. "Come on, they're waiting for us."
“Hush, My Love. I’ve got you.” John felt himself being lowered to the floor of the deck and tried to cling to Sherlock, a faint hint of panicked confusion cutting through the pleasure and arousal. “I’m here John, trust me.” He nodded weakly and let himself be lowered, missing the contact to Sherlock’s body.
“Not him personally, but my old patrol had to confiscate a few of his ships once. He brands everything with a red spider.”
"How dare you? I am not obtuse! I am more of an acute-" Sherlock kissed him again, pushing him back against the car and pressing against him.
“Oh, sod off with that shit! ‘You’re going to hurt John’. Of course I’m going to hurt John! That’s the idea, isn’t it? Everything I do leads to people I love getting hurt, it’s the only thing I’m good at!”
"S-So do you." Sherlock stared at the floor between them, shuffling his feet and fussing with the sleeves of his shirt.
“Can we please discuss this later?” The pain was excruciating and he knew it was only going to get worse when Mike took his sample. Mike nodded and knelt before Sherlock, pulling out a small Med Kit and inspecting the wound. “Take from the burn, not the cut.” Mike looked at Sherlock, concern and fear in his eyes. There was no doubt he recognized the seal.
“What’s wrong?” John looked at Sherlock, his mind reeling. A small flutter of paper in the top corner of the folder caught his eye and he pulled the sheet out, revealing a hand-written note.
"Just do what feels right Love. I'll tell you if I don't like something." John didn't give him the chance to respond before he lowered his lips to catch Sherlock's in a kiss that made him dizzy with arousal and lack of oxygen.
“Hey, hey, it’s alright. You’re fine. You’re fine. Stay still, I had to drain your lungs of fluid and you have been fighting off infection for a few days. Your chest is going to hurt like a bitch for a while.” John spoke in soothing tones, keeping a gentle pressure on the boy’s shoulder to stop him from escaping.
"With what money? Your rent? I'm sure you'd rather spend that on alcohol. What is your poison? Whiskey?" The woman's jaw clenched and she blinked rapidly, standing and collecting her jacket. "Go home, Ms. Watson, give up chasing ghosts."
“Is he responding to any stimulus?” She asked, sounding more confident than Sherlock had imagined she could. He shook his head, pulling his hands away from John’s unconscious body to allow the timid girl to check him over.
"What- what was that about?" Sherlock asked breathlessly, still grinning widely. John leaned against the tree, trying to calm his racing heart and laughed the adrenaline still racing through his veins.
"What the fuck is happening here? Why is Eurus in the men's loo?" John snapped, spinning to face his team. The grins and laughter of the other boys faded as the weight of his anger reached them. He ripped the towel out of one of the boy's hands, moving to stand in front of the girl.
"Hey Babe! Come on in, I'll be finished two shakes." John led Sherlock in, clearly not the slightest bit self-conscious about his state of undress. "Just toss your stuff anywhere." Sherlock stood in the middle of the kitchen, shifting awkwardly on his feet as John disappeared into the bathroom.
“Why did you leave me?” He asked, his voice wavering as he remembered the hurt and pain he had felt when Sherlock hadn’t been there when he woke up.
“My, my, what did this to you?” Sherlock whimpered as the man poked at the bleeding wounds. “Was it those nasty wolves I always hear out there?”
“You haven’t even said hello to the man you are going to be fucking in a few hours!” Sherlock growled, spinning to face John and snapping a hello at him. John felt a flash of irritation, not used to people treating him this way. He was about to say something when he saw Sherlock visibly freeze, his shoulders tightening and his head springing up.
"Yes, Daddy." He whispered, a thrill tracing his spine as he heard a soft groan fall from John's lips and felt his fingers tighten around his hips. He pulled back enough for John to catch his lips in a rough kiss, all teeth and tongue.
John let him fall before his could finish that sentence. He grinned as he heard the sickening thud of a body connecting with the stone below.
“I-I know.” Sherlock glared at the floor, chewing at his bottom lip and bouncing on his toes. He looked so young, and it made John want to take him in his arms and comfort him. “C-Can I- can I try something?”
"We've long passed the standard of Parlay Mr. Holmes, I am bound by no laws. Therefore, witnesses are not required for our conversations." John reached for the bottle of whiskey he kept hidden in his desk, reserved for special occasions. He grabbed a pair of glasses and poured himself and Sherlock a drink, handing one to the younger man. "You are safe in here Mr. Holmes."
"Fuck, Sherlock. You- you're gorgeous like this babe." John's voice was rough and breathy, and his teeth scraped along Sherlock's ribcage, sending a thrill along his spine as his mind tried to warn him
“Sherlock-” A deafening siren sounded, causing John to crumble in pain. Sherlock pushed off the deck, grabbing his friend and covering his ears. The sound was causing the energies around their vessel to vibrate.
“I’ll be there in a minute Love.” The Candelabra responded, climbing onto the table beside John and sitting on the edge.
"Fuck." He cursed, turning to the wall and slamming his fist against the wall. "That's why you're here, isn't it? You're here to take me in."
When he was finally cleared to go home, John had to fight to get the whiny man out of the building without pissing off the entire staff.
"Nothing happened John. I'm just tired, and I missed you, and I just want to go home." John kissed him sweetly, cupping his cheek tenderly and smiling up at him.
"Other than the most amazing, gorgeous boyfriend anyone could ask for? Nothing at all Love." Sherlock's blush deepened, and he gently swatted John's shoulder, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to John's lips.
When the chorus started, John sang along, slightly off key, and a touch too loud, but it made Sherlock giggle so he kept going. By the time the chorus ended, Sherlock was laughing loudly and shaking his head, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
"How about, we don't worry about it right now? There's no need to rush anything. It will happen when we are both good and ready. Okay?" He felt Sherlock nod against his shoulder and turned his head, pressing a gentle kiss to the boy's temple. "Alright then Tiny Dancer, let's get going, yeah? We both have practice to get to."
"Yeah, that's Sherlock." He waved at his boyfriend, who timidly waved back. "Hang on, I'm going to see if I can get him to come meet you all." John dropped his towel on the bench next to his friend and jogged across the field, coming to a stop before the bleachers and placing his hands on his hips. "Hey."
“You’ve aged well.” Sherlock whispered, stepping closer to John and brushing his fingers along the shorter man’s cheekbones.
It took another ten minutes before he was steady enough for The Beast to continue working on his wounds.
“Because this is what I do John!” Sherlock shouted, gripping at his curls and pulling. John could see the panic in the younger man’s eyes and suddenly understood. “I say things and I hurt people and I don’t give a fuck about who I hurt!” Sherlock’s chest started heaving as he appeared to forget how to breathe. His long legs gave out and John caught him before he could hit the ground, gently lowering him onto his knees in the middle of the cold street.
“Sounds good to me.” John turned back to where Mike had been standing, only to find his friend gone and a white folder in his place. He reached back and grabbed the paper, opening the folder and reading over the Medical Data written inside. “What is it?”
“Just, go to bed.” Lestrade grumbled, hopping off the table and stalking out of the room. “And stop yelling at your husband, he takes it out on me.”
"Sorry Love. Just, promise me you'll take it easy yeah? Stop when it starts hurting, and call if you need a ride."
"I never would have pegged you as a bossy bottom." John laughed, pressing kisses and leaving marks across Sherlock's chest.
Suddenly, a low, thrumming note pulsed through the air and John broke the kiss with a gasp. His body was filled with an overwhelming sense of pleasure that moved and vibrated with the pulse of the note.
“I know, but you can’t. Not with three broken ribs and a concussion-” His words were cut short as Sherlock spun him around and pinned him against the nearest wall. He winced as his head struck the unforgiving surface, but any protest he may have had was kissed away by the skilled lips of Sherlock Holmes.
Suddenly, the angle of John's thrusts changed, and Sherlock's back arched again as a cry was ripped from his lips.
Sherlock studied the boy as he began fighting with the cuffs that were keeping him pinned to the bed.
"No!" The boy swung his fist, flinching when he heard glass shattering. He stared at his hand, watching the blood run down his wrist, disappearing under the too-big sleeves of the coat.
"Bedroom then?" John pulled Sherlock close and nuzzled against his jawline, pressing barely-there kisses against his skin. Sherlock shrugged timidly, his cheeks darkening as he avoided John's gaze.
“You can recognize the symptoms of a torture victim when you’re one yourself.” John’s voice was unsteady and he stared at his trembling hands, fighting the wave of memories that threatened to assault him. “I was out on patrol when I got grabbed by a pair of rebels. They tossed me in a P.O.W. camp and let their men play.”
"Oh! Of course! I don't know how I missed it!" John grinned, watching as his lover jumped out of his seat, hurrying across the room and digging through another stack of files. He grabbed a file, spinning back and shoving the papers at Lestrade, grinning proudly. "There, that is all the proof you need to arrest Donaldson." Lestrade looked skeptical but relieved, taking the file and opening it.
There was a few moments of tense silence before John let out a loud snort of laughter, clutching at his sides and whimpering as his stomach started aching. Sherlock hid his face in the sheet, blushing and well on his way to a full-blown pout.
"No! He didn't attack me, verbally or physically. Sherlock attacked him. If you guys go after him we could all get in shit. Stay out of it Greg." Sherlock could see that Greg wanted to protest, to defend his captain, but the other boy simply nodded. John then spun to Sherlock, the frustration and concern in his eyes nearly making Sherlock ill with guilt. "Same goes for you. Unless he attacks you physically, you stay away from him, got it?" Sherlock blinked rapidly, glaring at the floor and nodding slightly.
“But John, we have a bit of time. Just let me-” John caught his wrists and spun him so the lanky man was pinned to the bathroom door. Sherlock let out a soft gasp of pleasure at the action, growling as John pinned his wrists above his head.
"If you wish for the Parlay to be fulfilled, then stop tugging on your ropes. You'll injure your wrists." John spoke, loud enough for his voice to be heard over his crew. The pale man's eyes met his and a chill ran down his spine.
“If it were Sherlock asking you would stay.” John’s chest tightened painfully, but he couldn’t bring himself to deny the words.
“So, this is what you want? The shell of his brilliance? You want to have him nearly dead and unresponsive, just so that he won’t be with me?” Moriarty spun to face John, fury on his face. “What’s wrong? Jealous that I don’t need some twisted song to get Sherlock’s love?” The Spider growled and stepped closer to John, trembling with rage. “How much does it piss you off? Knowing that I’ve made him writhe, and that he’s let me, willingly?”
“You wear registration army fatigues in your soldier kink videos, and you carry yourself like a soldier, even when you aren’t filming. Your haircut is only slightly longer than regulation, you prefer it longer but don’t like change, so you keep it at this length. That injury was made by a large gun, sniper rifle probably. You aren’t old enough to have been a cop, so that leaves army.” John blinked at the young man behind him, holding his gaze in the mirror. Sherlock blushed and looked away, glancing around the room as though avoiding John’s eyes.
“How long did you father beat you?” Sherlock heard the moment his words hit John. His bookbag fell heavily to the chair and the air in the flat turned thick.
“A Chimera.” The Beast froze, confusion spreading over his face. “That’s what you are modeled after. A Chimera. Well, minus the fire breathing part. You are part man part beast, aren’t you? That’s how you have all that medical knowledge. You were human once, but not anymore. You were cursed somehow, you and your staff. Something in that room keeps you like this, that’s why your castle won’t let me in there. You are hiding behind your curse, trying to keep me at arms length. What are you hiding oh Master of the Haunted Castle?” Sherlock was certain he was going to die now. He had always been ridiculed for his abilities, and now he had just deduced a creature that could kill him without a second thought.
“What the hell man? You- you’re dead?” John watched as his friend tugged at his hair, stepping closer to Sherlock as his face fell. “W-When did it happen? Does Mycroft know?”
"J-John- n-no- pl-please d-don't-" Sherlock felt John pull his fingers out gently and shift so he was hovering over Sherlock's body. The emptiness was shocking, and Sherlock squirmed, lifting his hips and tugging on his hair. "John- John please-" Soft lips pressing against his caught his pleas and slowed his mind.
"I'll see you later Gorgeous." John left, bidding farewell to the rest of Sherlock's family and stopping to give Mrs. Hudson a quick kiss before stepping outside.
“He’s going to be fine. His body is responding to stimulus, and he is breathing on his own.” Molly assured him as they watched Geoff lead in the team of EMTs. She pulled Sherlock out of the way and chattered to the professionals as they surrounded John, trying desperately to help the young man.
"What do you want Baby?" John asked, his voice a dark growl that made Sherlock's mind spin with lust. He loved hearing John's voice when he was aroused, the soft, soothing tenor becoming a rich and dangerous sound that did confusing things to his body.
"No, I uh- I had a plan." John laughed, reaching out and fixing the boy's scarf, which had gotten twisted around itself.
"So needy, and I've only just started with you. This is going to be fun." John grinned against his skin, finishing with the shirt and moving on to teasing open Sherlock's trousers. "You know, we're going to have to move if you want me to take my clothes-"
When he was out of the locker room, he heaved a sigh, letting himself fall back against the wall. He rubbed his hands over his face, fighting to keep his anger down.
“I run his brother’s security force.” John looked shocked, and Sherlock just shrugged. “Small universe eh?” Gavin laughed, his relaxed tone helping Sherlock calm down slightly. “So it’s true then? You got nabbed by The Spider?” Sherlock nodded. “Shit Mate, he marked you?” Sherlock nodded again, blinking away tears. John looked as lost as before, though he seemed to be more concerned with the fact that Sherlock was fighting tears than anything.
“Y-You still want to die.” Sherlock felt the change in John’s body as soon as the words left his mouth. The man’s smaller frame tensed and he sighed heavily, pulling his hands away from Sherlock’s face and rubbing them roughly over his own.
Sherlock drew his knees up to his chest, trying to keep his breathing steady. They had only been dating for a little over a month, and Sherlock had no reference as to how fast things were supposed to go. He was on the verge of a panic attack when his phone buzzed.
“Sherlock!” The haunting voice of The Spider filled Sherlock’s head, splitting his mind painfully. His legs burned where the mark should have been, and he pulled at John’s wrists.
"Yes John." Sherlock kept his eyes trained on the floor, not looking up as John sent George on his way, or when a tense silence followed. "I have to go." He mumbled, stepping away from John and turning, planning on making a quick escape. A firm grip on his elbow almost stopped him, but he pulled himself free.
“I-I can’t- I-I need- I need to get back.” Victor kept pressing soft kisses to his face and lips, but the pulsing in his wrists had returned and was making the affectionate touches feel miles away. “Please, I-I need John-” Victor’s movements stopped and he pulled away, a deep sadness in his eyes.
“John? Who is this John?” Sherlock was vaguely aware that he was calling out for the beast, but he couldn’t stop himself. The pain had stripped away any filter he might have had.
"Speaking of Harry, where is she? Mum asked me to pick her up." Sherlock frowned at him, cocking his head to the side.
“I had an idea about that actually. You need electricity to manifest, right? What about a laptop plugged into a socket?”
“Was I right at least?” Sherlock asked, his voice sending a thrill along John’s spine, one he hadn’t felt since before he left the army. He brushed aside thoughts of his former commander and focused on not trembling.
“I understand. Thank you for your assistance Mr. Watson.” He started to turn away, promptly tripping on the carpet and nearly falling. John caught him by the arm and spun them around, this time, Sherlock was the one pinned.
“Let me finish John.” Sherlock snapped, rolling his eyes in a way that was purely Sherlock Holmes. “When I woke up, I was angry, hurt, and confused. I had a voice in the back of my head screaming at me that I had fallen in love with someone I’d never met. All I knew, was that I had failed in killing myself and was now missing a year of my life, a third of which belonged to a faceless man I apparently loved.” John was fighting back tears and could see that Sherlock was doing the same.
“Yeah. Whatever is tainting the tissues is keeping scarred tissues from healing. When exposed to intense Sonic technology the tissues heal temporarily, then return to their original state of necrosis.” Mike looked away from his screen, the sounds of keys clicking filling the silence.
John's yelp of shock was cut off by Sherlock's lips crashing against his own. The sword clattered to the ground as Sherlock released John's lips, his hands resting on either side of John's face.
“I-I have t-to move y-you.” John felt breathless, his chest heaving as Sherlock started to pull him forwards. It was difficult walking, the air feeling heavy around him. He was dragged for a few feet before Sherlock stopped, hesitating for a moment before quickly gripping John’s shoulders and spinning him around. John felt a strange pressure against his back, but before he could question it Sherlock had captured his lips with his own in a bruising kiss. The contact sent electricity jolting through John’s shorter frame and he moaned against the other man’s lips. He fought to move his arms, finally managing to get his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, tangling one of his hands in the dark curls and sliding the other down to rest on the thin waist. Sherlock moaned at the touch, pressing impossibly closer to John. They broke apart, breathing against each other’s lips heavily.
"Right, sorry." Sherlock mumbled, reaching for a long, black coat and grey-blue scarf before reaching past John to open the door.
“Hey Mikey!” John called, waving at the shorter man. He laughed as Mike all but ran to them, colliding with John and nearly knocking him over with the force of his hug. “It’s good to see you too.” He yelped as Mike pinched his side harshly, flinching away and rubbing at the bruising skin. “Oi! What was that for?”
Standing beside Mikey was a tall, thin man, almost inhumanly beautiful, with dark curls and too-pale skin.
John had been in this house many times, he had seen these walls almost every day since the first time he had picked up his Tiny Dancer so many months ago. Tonight felt different though, there was a tension in the air, and a sadness on his heart.
“Nah, you love me.” John winked at him, not missing the crimson tint that rose over the pale man’s cheeks. He fought back his own blush as his own words registered in his mind. “S-sorry I-”
“Fascinating. And you’re certain that they had no tests or procedures done when they were there before?”
“Mycroft is Death, every body has a limit to how long it can function without a soul. The longest I have seen a body function with out a soul is five minutes. The longer it sits, the more strands of time fray around it. John was at the three-minute mark when Mycroft restored him. Once time separates from the body, it can’t be restored by anyone except Fate, and Fate never gives up her dead.” The sounds of sirens filled the air, pulling Sherlock from his thoughts. He looked worriedly at John, feeling fear grip his chest as he thought of the frailty of humans.
“He loves you.” The vaguely familiar voice of Mary filled his thoughts. He set Sherlock’s body back on the bed and turned to her, preparing to beg her forgiveness.
“Wait, y-you’re- no.” John felt his knees weaken as realization struck him. The spell had worked. They had summoned Father Time.
"Do you still have a tracker in my jacket?" The sigh he got in answer sent a flare of irritation through his mind. "I need you to track it, and tell me where it's going right now."
“John?” He called, stumbling from the bathroom. The flat was dark and empty, no one had been there for years.
“Dude, what is the worst that can happen?” Greg laughed and placed another beer in front of the med student.
“I love you.” John felt Sherlock tense in his arms and he pressed more soft kisses to the younger man’s shoulders and neck.
“So, you’re Captain Watson?” The same man that had summoned Sherlock earlier asked, glancing at him as he nodded. “Good, you and Sherlock will start out over by the mirror. Don’t really have much by means of a script, so just go with whatever flows.”
“Under the bed. There is a small leather case. If I am bound to anything, it would be that.” John nodded and scurried off to try to find the little case. When he found it, he unzipped it, gasping at the contents.
"I can't help it, the way you move is just- there are no words." Sherlock blushed darker, and felt his mind start to close, his brain going into overdrive at the thought of his dancing arousing John. "Hey, stay with me Babe." Sherlock blinked and forced his eyes to meet John's, digging his nails into his palms to keep himself from disassociating. "There you are. You okay babe?" Sherlock nodded, chewing on his bottom lip and shifting uncomfortably.
“J-John-” There was a softness to the once broken voice now and John knew he had his lover back. He smiled at the pale man, kissing him softly again. This time, Sherlock responded, sighing as John gently licked into his mouth. “I-I’m so sorry John.” He whispered against the ex-soldier’s lips, mumbling through the barely-there kisses.
It was silent in the flat as Sherlock stormed off to his bedroom, planning on avoiding his flatmate for at least a week. He threw himself onto the bed and burrowed under the blankets, wishing he could melt into the sheets.
"Yes, please John. Fuck- please!" John laughed and caught Sherlock's lips in a rough kiss, biting at his lips and sucking on his tongue as he tugged Sherlock trousers and pants off.
“Sherlock? Talk to me man, did it work?” Mike’s voice filled the silence, pulling Sherlock from the fog of pain.
John loved the curiosity of the creature, and gladly answered his questions. He found he quite enjoyed talking to Sherlock, his mind was fascinating and watching him swim amongst the stars was breathtaking.
"Barely. They're trying to flush the drugs out of his system and get him stabilized, but they're not hopeful. He's in rough shape Sherlock."
"You looked bored, and I didn't want to disappoint you." John blushed, staring at the grass between his feet and kicking at the ground anxiously.
"Good?" Sherlock could only nod, clenching his fingers tightly at his sides. He had no idea what to do with his hands.
Sherlock watched as the creature handled the medical equipment with the precision of a surgeon. He readied a needle and some thread for sutures, as well as sterilized some bandages and his claws.
A shocked and terrified expression passed over the other boy's face, and he hid his face in his hands, trying to tug his foot away from John's grip, but failing as he tightened his hand around the thin ankle.
"J-John- John please-" John growled and tightened his grip in Sherlock's hair, tugging him closer and attacking his lips harshly.
He fled into the forest, the blackness amongst the trees pulling him deeper into their cold embrace.
"Oh, right. George." Sherlock yawned again, stretching languidly and derailing any sarcastic comment John might have had. "What does he want this early in the morning?"
"Because you're beautiful." Sherlock blushed, smiling softly at John's words. "Happy Christmas Love."
"Oh! Christ, I'm so sorry! I-I didn't- I didn't realize-" John stepped further away from Sherlock, processing the new name in his mind. "S-So you-you're-"
His vision quickly faded to black as he collapsed against the floor, feeling the weight of unconsciousness taking over his joints.
"Twenty-eight." John flinched as a voice appeared behind his shoulder. He turned to see Sherlock, blushing lightly and fussing with his coat. "The uh- the atomic number of Nickel is twenty-eight." John glanced back down at his paper, filling in the question quickly before shutting his books and sending Sherlock a smirk.
“Unfortunately, yes. They met on set one day when Mycroft came to sign some contracts. Have been together ever since.”
“No one controls Fate Sherlock!” Sherlock sobbed and crumbled against the firm chest of his older brother. He was pulled from his grief by the sound of a strangled breath being drawn in behind him.
He pressed John up against the brick wall of the alley and kissed him roughly, tugging at his clothes.
Panic gripped his chest and he tried to sit up again, sobbing in agony and fear when Mikey held him down.
“Goodbye Mikey.” He whispered, turning away and starting to loosen the ropes that held his ship in place.
John made his way up the stairs, quietly cursing Sherlock and his unwillingness to help with the shopping.
John turned and climbed back into his Star Sailor, leaving Sherlock standing alone and breaking on the dock.
He cried out as his head connected with the wall. He was being pinned by none other than Sherlock Holmes.
"Wh-What was that for?" John asked, his voice breathless and happy. Sherlock blushed, shuffling his feet and staring at the floor between them.
"Answer me, Sherlock. Did Anderson do this to you?" Sherlock nodded, closing his eyes tightly and trying to keep his breathing steady. John pushed away from Sherlock, tugging at his hair and breathing erratically. "Fucking cock-sucker! I'm going to kill him!" Sherlock blinked at the angry boy, trying to process what was happening.
“Hello!” a familiar, sing-song voice broke through Sherlock’s thoughts, sending panic lancing through his chest.
Sherlock felt terror rise in his chest as the object turned to face him, moving as though it were alive. The base changed to the legs and feet of a human and it walked towards him.
“Yeah- yeah sorry, sorry, just choked on my tea there. Y-You want me to come back?” John had never gotten re-cast before, and to get a call-back to film with Sherlock Holmes again was even better.
“If you ever leave me like that again, I’ll kill you myself.” Sherlock chuckled, his smile filling John’s heart with light for the first time in weeks. “Now, I know the spell to bring you back, since your body is still alive. But only if you really want to, I don’t want you to feel pressured into anything.” Sherlock leaned down and kissed the shorter man, a deep, passionate kiss that left John’s toes curling against the cold tiles.
"He is Harriet's older brother, we met at a show." Sherlock was pushing his eggs around his plate, looking bored and uncomfortable.
“Of course Love.” Sherlock nodded and flickered out of sight, reappearing on the other side of the bed. He furrowed his brow and motioned with his hand, using his ability to manipulate objects to move the blankets. He adjusted them so they were lying flat and even on the bed, the only disturbance being John’s body lying beneath them.
"They've met me John, last year when they beat me in the locker room." John felt his heart break at the terrified expression on his boyfriend's face and reached for his hand, pulling him close and cupping his cheek.
He felt the nausea rising in his throat and was prepared to race for the bathroom when his foot knocked against an empty bucket. He didn’t have time to question how it got there before his body started to expel the leftover alcohol in his system.
John had been awake for two days, and had been fighting Lestrade the whole time. He claimed his name was Jacob Brownstein, and that he had been mugged on his way home.
"Do you want it to be a date?" Sherlock wanted to say yes, but the memory of how much Victor had hurt him pressed at the back of his thoughts, making him hesitate.
"Well sir, not exactly." John spun to face his First Mate, Mikey. The short, heavyset man flinched at the action, fiddling with his hat and staring worriedly at the color.
"Sherlock, you're overreacting-" John flinched when a shoe came flying at his head. His boyfriend spun to face him, a glare on his face that bordered on manic.
He was in a huge room, the walls lined with shelves upon shelves of books. The entire ground floor was a lab, filled with expensive scientific equipment and supplies.
He prepared Sherlock quickly and thoroughly, loving the whimpers and moans he managed to pull from the taller man as he pumped and scissored his fingers into the tight body beneath him.
Sherlock dove through the air, using his song to propel himself faster towards the now-unconscious human. He reached the human and manipulated what little energy was left in the empty air to stop his fall. He wrapped his arms around the unconscious man’s chest and hauled him back towards his vessel.
“I’m back.” Sherlock jumped when he felt a firm hand squeeze his shoulder, comforted slightly at the sound of John’s voice. “How many times has Mikey asked you out since I left?” John took his place beside Mike once again, smiling at Sherlock.
“Holy shit.” John whispered, pushing himself to his feet and stepping closer to the Siren, his jaw open in shock. He reached for his Med Scanner out of habit, the doctor within him wanting to heal the horrific wound.
He chose his weapon and turned back to John, a small, black serrated blade in his hand and an evil glint in his eye.
“John!” He had less than a second to register the voice that suddenly filled the room before he was yanked out of the chair. He yelped as he was dragged from the room, squirming against his attacker’s grip. Mycroft was shouting furiously, but John wasn’t listening. His soldier instinct was kicking in and he tried to fight back, but his mysterious attacker had him by the back of his jacket’s collar.
“Thank you for your lack of assistance. I will figure something else out-” He turned to walk away, but was stopped when Irene grabbed him by the elbow.
“Thanks Greg.” John’s voice was sincere and he grinned at Sherlock, clearly excited that they had a new plan. “I owe you one.”
“His heart- it- it stopped.” Gavin cursed, running his hands through his hair and pacing in the small space.
"I got a scholarship for The Julliard School of Dance. If I accept I will be moving to New York in September." John felt cold fingers grip his heart as Sherlock's words registered. "You're going into the army, aren't you?" John drew in a shaky breath, nodding silently and pressing a soft kiss to his boyfriend's hair. "We're going to be okay, right John?" Sherlock sounded so scared, his voice small and shaky, breaking John's heart as he shifted, pulling the other boy up for a soft kiss.
When they arrived at Sherlock's door, John leaned against the railing of the porch, smirking up at the taller boy as he fumbled with his keys.
Curled into a ball between the wall and the toilet was one of the younger students in John's class, her hair matted to her forehead as though she had just left the shower and a bruise purpling on her cheek.
“John, please, don’t do this again.” John sighed, feeling a sense of familiarity wash over him. Less than a year ago, they had been having this exact conversation. He fought with the ropes for a few more minutes, his hands shaking violently.
"Yes, and last night they were two rooms away while you were balls-deep in my arse. You didn't mind then-"
"I didn't know they were there!" John tugged at his hair, fighting to keep his breathing steady. He had been dreading meeting Sherlock's parents since they started dating, and this was not how he pictured it going down. "Babe, this- this isn't good. I-I think- I-I'm just going to sneak out-" Sherlock grabbed his hips and tugged him closer, nuzzling along his collarbone and running his hands along his sides.
"Fuck me!" Sherlock flinched at the curse. It wasn't the words that bothered him, he was quite fond of cursing himself. It was that specific combination of words coming from that particular mouth, that always gave him pause. Because it never failed, his mind always answered,
It was a week after the recital before John saw Sherlock again. His mother had called, asking if John could pick up Harry from practice as she had to work late.
“My brother banished me, or have you forgotten that?” Sherlock snapped, sending the man a cold glare through the camera. “I would be shocked if you did, you were, after all, the one that flogged me and escorted me from his planet.” There was silence from the other end for a long while before John’s tablet dinged.
"Ready Tiny Dancer?" He didn't give Sherlock time to respond before pressing his finger into him, pulling a soft keen from his chest.
As the minutes passed, John became very aware of the fact that Sherlock was clearly not enjoying himself. The boy kept fidgeting in his seat and looked bored before the meal even arrived.
"I just want you to be happy." John rolled his eyes, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to Sherlock's lips, smiling fondly when he pulled away.
“Precisely. You have already lost far too much blood today. Fall now.” Sherlock felt his body fall, connecting roughly with the stone stairs. “Focus Sherlock, you need to stay focused. You will slip into shock if you don’t fight.” Sherlock pulled forth the memory of the dance with John, focusing on the feel of the Beast pressed against him. “The pain will start soon, don’t run from it, embrace it Sherlock. Keep fighting.”
“Whatever do you mean?” Sherlock’s tone was dripping with feigned innocence as he appeared beside John, a mischievous glint in his eyes. “I’m not doing anything My Love, it would appear that the front door has stopped working again. You will just have to stay with me.”
"Not really. Though it's a little unnerving to think that she just had-" John silenced him by gripping the back of his neck tightly and pulling him down for a deep kiss. Sherlock whimpered into the kiss, his hands coming to rest on John's hips and pulling him closer.
“I’m serious John. If you have no intention of letting me save you, then leave now.” John closed the distance between them and started kissing Sherlock again. The Siren could feel the weight of the emotion John was pouring into the kiss and felt tears slip from his eyes as he dropped his hands to John’s waist and kissed back.
Sherlock was touching him. Sending sparks of cold electricity dancing along his entire body and causing him to gasp.
“The man my father spoke of.” John made an affirmative sound, his curiosity piquing. He didn’t push though, letting Sherlock speak at his leisure. “You may have heard of him, he is in the industry. James Moriarty.” John couldn’t help tensing at the name.
"I didn't sleep with her, Sherlock." John's voice was rough and Sherlock could hear the pain as he spoke. "Why would you think I wanted that?" Sherlock felt fresh tears start to fall and he covered his face in his hands.
"Hey, it's just me Love." John's mumbled into the skin of his neck, calming Sherlock's nerves almost instantly. "Didn't you hear me calling you?" Sherlock blushed, shaking his head and turning in his boyfriend's arms, leaning down and kissing him softly. "Oh Tiny Dancer, whatever am I going to do with you?" There was a sort of mocking fondness to John's tone that pulled a blush along Sherlock's cheeks.
At first, nothing happened, the herbs started to burn, and the room started to fill with an unpleasant scent.
John jolted away from Sherlock when someone cleared their throat by the door, leaving him unsupported against the wall. Sherlock slid down so he was sitting on the floor, pulling his knees to his chest and hiding his face, praying whoever it was hadn't heard what John had just said.
“Sher-” He felt his knees give out and would have hit the ground if Sherlock hadn’t caught him. He felt Sherlock lift him off his feet and carry him to the sofa, his world spinning as he fought to breathe.
"How not good would it be if I brought a girl home for John?" Lestrade choked on his coffee, glaring at Sherlock as he fought to expel the hot liquid from his airway.
"It's Greg, but yeah." John laughed, motioning to the seat across from Sherlock. "Mind if I join you? Or are you expecting your boyfriend, what's his name, Markus?" Sherlock felt his chest tighten at the mention of his recent ex.
"J-John- John please-" The older boy started moving his hips faster, the angle of his thrusts changing just enough to ensure he hit Sherlock's prostate with every action.
"J-John-" He gasped as he felt his boyfriend latch onto his throat, sucking and biting at the skin there. He heard someone saying John's name and glanced at the group of girls that were whispering and staring. "J-John- s-stop-"
"Bedroom, now." John whispered breathlessly, pulling Sherlock to his feet, leading him down the hall.
Once John had passed out in his arms, Mike gently laid him back onto the mattress and pulled his phone out, leaving the room quietly and answering the call.
“Sounds good, call or text if you need anything.” He was almost out of the room when he heard Sherlock’s soft voice calling his name.
“Oh, look at that Time, you found yourself quite the brave little soldier. That gun will do you no good Dear.” John held his ground, not even trembling. Fate was right, he was brave.
John's heart jumped into his throat when he felt Sherlock's breath ghosting over his cheek and neck, and he fought the urge to kiss the boy. The fresh scent of lilac and sandalwood filled his nostrils and he caught sight of Sherlock's cheeks darkening again.
He could never remember why he chose this town, but something always told him to stay. An insistent urge to remain.
He gasped and arched his back when he felt a wet heat engulfing his member. John pinned his hips to the bed with one strong hand as he worked, making soft noises that only served to make Sherlock's head spin with arousal.
“Automatic basically means that all you do is move a leaver to show where you want to go. Manual is what I do; using brute force to turn the ship. It’s more dangerous and a little harder, as most of it is strictly guessing, but if you know what you’re doing, it’s far more accurate.” John tossed the wires back to the crate he pulled them from and smirked dangerously at Sherlock, winking at the Siren. “It’s also more fun.” Sherlock grinned back at him, pushing off the deck and swimming a loop around the boat.
"S-Sorry- sorry- no, don't leave! Just, since when do you talk like that?" Mycroft blush deepened and he smiled sheepishly.
"I can't believe you've never seen White Christmas! It's a classic!" Sherlock had no idea how they had gotten onto the topic of Christmas movies, but he couldn't bring himself to care one way or another. "My Mum and I watch it every year. That and Miracle on 34th Street."
"Since when do you give me fashion advice?" Mycroft grumbled as he changed into the outfit Sherlock had chosen for him. Sherlock finished with his hair and turned back to face his brother, grinning brightly.
"Think I can make you come twice?" Sherlock was trembling and his breathing was becoming erratic. He could see the question forming in Lestrade's eyes, and avoided his gaze. He finished his deductions and breathed a sigh of relief, hoping he could leave now.
Sherlock’s body had gone into shock, his internal organs failing and his brain shutting down. The doctors had tried to revive him, but to no avail.
“Yes, yes, it worked.” Sherlock pulled John close, tugging his now-still hands from his face. “John’s injured but alive.”
“I may be, but I refuse to subject John to anymore of your abuse.” With that, John was pushed out the door into the night air.
"The date was not boring John. I just tend to shut down when I get anxious. It's a defense mechanism." John watched the boy for a moment, trying to wrap his mind around the fact that Sherlock Bloody Holmes was his date.
"Sorry-" Sherlock hurried to fix his laptop as he finally cleared his airway. "Sorry, I'm alright." John looked concerned, chewing on his bottom lip and rubbing at the back of his neck anxiously. "I just- I didn't expect that." Sherlock blushed as John smirked and leaned closer, glancing at what Sherlock assumed was his bedroom door briefly.
Sherlock gently placed Rosie on the ground and tried to scramble away, ignoring the protests of Mrs. Hudson and his body.
He could feel the tell-tale signs of his body surrendering to the pain and didn’t bother fighting the darkness that took over his mind.
He looked up at John, to find the other man scribbling in his notebook. He shrugged it off and returned to his inspection of the corpse.
"Mrs. Hudson!" John flinched and looked up the stairs, his breath catching in his throat as his eyes landed on his date.
He grabbed Sherlock’s thin frame, pulling the unconscious creature close just before the rope attached to his waist was pulled tight and he was jolted away.
"I-It's fine." Sherlock mumbled, forcing his eyes to stay above John's waist. He still wasn't sure if he was ready, and he didn't want to give John any mixed signals. "I-It's my fault, really-" John silenced him with a soft kiss, smiling fondly when he pulled away.
There was something about talking over text that made Sherlock less shy. He knew that John enjoyed it when he shared his thoughts, but could never seem to bring himself to say them out loud.
John worked him open slowly, taking care to stop when he noticed Sherlock's body tensing in pain or discomfort.
Sherlock fought back the tears that tried to fall. He knew that he had done nothing wrong, but that didn't mean that John would believe him.
When they found her, she was chattering excitedly with her partner, whose name was still escaping John's mind. Harry caught sight of them and gripped the boy's elbow, dragging him over to where John and his mother were hovering.
"I bet Greg would figure it out. Think he would watch?" Sherlock coughed to hide the whimper that tried to fall. John had inadvertently discovered his minor exhibitionist kink one day while Sherlock was sucking him off in an alley.
By the time John arrived at the studio, the halls were filled with students and teachers, all crowded around to see what happened.
Then again, towards the end it had begun to feel as though Victor's entire reason for existing was to hate what Sherlock loved.
"What do you want Love?" John's voice was soft and wavered slightly, and it was then that Sherlock realized that he wasn't the only one that was nervous. Sherlock timidly cupped John's face with his hands, leaning down to press a soft kiss to his boyfriend's lips.
Halfway through the movie, Sherlock's phone rang, and the name lighting up his screen made his chest tighten painfully.
“That’s right. I’m impressed.” He looked at the creature before him in awe. He hadn’t expected that. “Anyways, I just thought I would make sure you were feeling alright. I will leave you alone to rest now. Good night Sherlock.”
It was a lengthy process, and Sherlock’s status didn’t waver. Once John finished, he leaned back, taking the young man’s pulse and checking once more for fluids. When he was satisfied, he called Mycroft back in. reassuring him that he had cleared the fluid, and that he would keep an eye on his status through the night.
John and Sherlock peered in the window of Angelo's watching the couple stand awkwardly for a minute. When Greg and Mycroft started laughing and moved to sit, John let out a happy crow and spun to face his boyfriend, grinning happily.
Sherlock Holmes was practically a god in the industry, and they wanted him to work with him. John took a steadying breath before making his way into the studio. He had been asked to head straight for room 221B for prep, and he felt himself relax.
“I’ve got you John.” Sherlock’s voice wavered with the Song that played with his Life Force, and John dropped his head against the Siren’s pale shoulder, whimpering as the shocks of pleasure coursed through him.
“Well, according to the book, we add the ingredients over the watch, we each cut our palms and let the blood drain over everything. Then we burn the whole thing while saying the words
A soft gasp fell from his lips as Sherlock's lips ghosted over one of his nipples. He threaded his fingers in his boyfriend's hair and closed his eyes, dropping his head back and cursing quietly as Sherlock timidly teased him.
“Right, well I’ll see you at Baker Street then, Gorgeous.” John winked and smirked at Sherlock, pulling a flush along his neck and face, before wheeling his way out of the room.
"Tell you what, if you come with me to the dance, and behave just long enough to snog on the dance floor and make that prick Anderson jealous, we can come back here and do whatever you want. Sound good?" Sherlock sighed, kissing John again before nodding and reaching for his coat.
"I'm your prisoner, remember? Am I to be sent to the Brig? Or will you keep me bound here in your cabin so you can fuck me whenever you want?" John spun on his heel, glaring at Sherlock.
“Sherlock stopped flinching.” Greg grinned and motioned for John to sit in the chair next to him. Once John was settled, Greg sat on the table facing him, wincing as his joints creaked.
“Brother Mine. You finally remember me.” Sherlock nodded against the neck of his sibling. “I have missed you little brother.” Sherlock heard a shuffling behind him and removed himself from his brother’s arms, turning to face John.
"Fine, I'd like to get to know the young man who had his hands all over my baby girl." John snorted as Sherlock recoiled, pulling himself out of Harry's grip and blushing deeply.
"I'm not your housekeeper, I'm your God Mother, Silly Goose." Sherlock blushed again, huffing in irritation before descending the rest of the steps to stand before John.
Despite the embarrassment of John's younger sister hearing them, both boys were asleep shortly, wrapped tightly in each other's arms.
“Your shoulder.” John rubbed absently at the joint, feeling the poorly healed skin under his fingers. “That scar is less than a year old, and you carry yourself with the confidence of a soldier. Also, your Energy Bow is military issue, but not the latest one.” John smirked, knowing he must look like a gaping fool. “What happened?” At that, John’s heart throbbed painfully and he looked away, the smirk disappearing from his lips.
Sherlock watched intently as John maneuvered the ship through the stars, measuring distances with his hand and deftly avoiding any meteors or salvage that threatened to crash his vessel.
"No it's not, Sherlock. He could have killed you." Sherlock sighed, pulling back slightly and cupping John's face gently, leaning down and pressing a soft kiss to his forehead.
His brother was sprawled out on the bed, shirt lying on the floor along with George's. The other boy was straddling Mycroft's lap, his face a mask of irritation and embarrassment.
“Haven’t you heard Time? Fate’s a cruel bitch. John Watson belongs to me, and that will not change.” With that, she was gone. Sherlock felt his chest tightening as he realized what had just happened. He had lost John to Fate.
"You're a mess." Sherlock snorted at John's words, shaking his head and pushing at his chest, his legs beginning to ache from being in that position for too long. John caught the hint and lifted him off his lap, Sherlock whimpering as he felt John's limp member slip from his body.
"God, no! Absolutely not. I refuse to be treated like an infant-" John silenced his protests by leaning up and pressing a firm kiss to his lips. Sherlock sighed and leaned into the kiss, whining softly when John pulled away.
"Not with a boy, but I did some research and I'm pretty sure I know what to do." Sherlock nodded, doing his best to relax.
“I was wondering if you would join me for dinner? You look absolutely ravishing tonight.” Moriarty stepped into Sherlock’s personal space, causing the young man to blush and push his hand against his chest.
"But it's been-" John pressed a finger against Sherlock's lips, his face a mix of frustration and pain that made Sherlock's chest ache.
John watched as Sherlock raced away, tugging at his hair and fighting for air. Sherlock was going to die out there, and there was no way he would let him save him.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I’m only having a bit of fun. John may like bananas, but I don’t.” Sherlock blinked in confusion.”
"If you say happy, I'm going to have to swat you." Sherlock pulled back, confusion filling his mind at the frustration he heard in his boyfriend's tone.
"This is only the third volume. I own all ten." John's jaw dropped and he stared at the book in awe.
"I'll see you tomorrow?" John asked as he walked his boyfriend off the field, ignoring the whistles and laughter of his teammates.
“Just sign the papers John. You won’t get very far in this industry without backing, you know that as well as anyone. What I’m offering you is stability. The same stability that my brother has.” John stared at the papers in his hands, worrying at his bottom lip and bouncing his knee.
Sherlock watched his friend as he spun, the lights from his imaginary galaxy glittering in his dark eyes. There was a child-like joy on his face and it made Sherlock’s heart light. He wanted to give John that joy again, he wanted to give John a reason to live.
"Oh, most definitely, asked as soon as we walked in." Sherlock felt the tips of his ears start to burn and avoided the gazes of the team, turning his gaze to the new ring that adorned his finger. "It's called a Claddagh." John mumbled, pressing a soft kiss to the skin behind his ear. "My father wore one when he first started seeing my mother. If you point the tip of the heart facing you, it means your heart belongs to another. Facing out means you're looking." Sherlock smiled, twisting the silver, heart-shaped band on his finger and watching the purple stone glinting in the disco lights. "It's just a promise ring, but when I get back, if you wanted, we could make it an engagement ring." Sherlock nodded, kissing his boyfriend softly before resting his head on John's shoulder.
He turned and raced up an old flight of stairs, trying to ignore the creeping realization that made itself known in the back of his mind.
“Oh, look at that. The Ice King’s little Captain has come to save him.” The taller of the two snarked, sending John’s soldier instinct into overdrive. He straightened, reaching into his bag and instantly finding the pistol he kept hidden there. “Come on Captain Watson, make him squeal like you did in the video.” John clenched his jaw and readied himself for a fight.
"Not if he knows what's good for him." Sherlock glanced up at his boyfriend shyly, unable to contain the smile that pulled at his lips. "You okay Love?" Sherlock nodded, letting John pull him to his feet.
“Y-yes I’m fine. Everything’s fine. Sh-should I go talk to John?” This was new territory for Sherlock and he had no idea what to do.
“Binding the will of Father Time? What happens if it works?” Molly sounded slightly nervous, so John wrapped his arm around her and gave her a comforting squeeze. There had never been anything between them other than friendship, but John always felt a little bad for the timid girl. She seemed to get her heart broken quite frequently, even though she was the sweetest thing John had ever met.
"Hard to forget a face like yours," the boy met his eyes again, looking up from under his eyelashes and licking his bottom lip slightly, "Daddy." Sherlock felt his breath catch in his throat and forced a cough, avoiding the boy's gaze. "Ah, never been the one receiving end of that one, have you?" Sherlock flinched when he felt a weight settle on his shoulder, blinking up at the boy who was now standing over him.
Even though they had been dating for nearly a week, Sherlock was still incredibly shy when it came to most physical contact, and John normally didn't push him, but today his adrenaline was still high from the practice, and Sherlock looked good in his baggy t-shirt and tight jeans.
"Please John, I-I want to." Sherlock whispered, nuzzling into John's hand. He glanced up and met John's eyes, reading the concern there. "I-I want you."
"I'm coming in guys!" Harry's voice came from the other side of the door, and John yelped as Sherlock dislodged him, sending him tumbling to the side. "Dad called, said you've been ignoring his messages." John groaned, dropping his head against the mattress. "You've got to talk to him eventually John."
"Please? I'll make it up to you. Remember that thing you wanted to try?" Sherlock stiffened slightly before groaning, throwing his arm dramatically over his eyes. "Is that a yes?"
“That atrocity you used is symbolic. This one is important.” He snapped, holding the watch in one hand while hovering his other hand over it. “Now, I am going to slow time, only the person I have been bonded with will be able to move outside of time. When I reset time again, I will make sure the other two will be able to tell who it was.”
“I belong to no one.” John growled, stepping out from behind Sherlock, drawing a gun and pointing it at Fate. Sherlock felt a pang of amusement and fear.
John stopped singing, suddenly overwhelmed with the thought that Sherlock was there, dancing with him, beneath the stars. The beautiful dancer he had been crushing on was laughing and grinning because of him, and John was certain he had never seen a more stunning sight.
John’s smile was intoxicating and his voice was calming. He was attractive by human standards, and he carried himself with a confidence that made him look taller than he was.
“Oh, I’m not looking to make you cave. I’m just killing time until he gets here.” John laughed again, a hollow, broken sound that seemed to give even Moriarty pause.
"Good, we have lots of time." John laughed as Sherlock pulled him off the car, opening the door and pushing him into the back seat.
"Is there anything else I can get you John?" The waitress, John thought her name was Mary or something like that, asked.
"What uh- what's she being subtle about?" His voice shook slightly, and he prayed Sherlock wouldn't notice. He knew the answer, but he prayed Sherlock didn't.
"Where the fuck have you been?" Sherlock flinched, blinking away tears as he heard the pain and anger in his boyfriend's voice.
He brushed it off at first, his mind rationalizing the events by coming up with barely plausible theories. It was a breeze, or he moved too quickly. They didn’t fit, but they were better than the alternative.
“He’s dangerous, John. He killed thirty people because he was bored, then he ran off to join the Spider’s forces to spite his older brother. His brother, the army, and the Spider all want him dead.” John’s eyes met Sherlock’s and the Siren could see the pain and confusion there. “I know you care about him John, that’s why I told you to get the hell out.” John turned his eyes back to the tablet, his brow furrowing. “Oh, don’t give me that look Watson. I can see how you look at that man, or whatever he is. You care about him. I can only hope he is dangerous enough for you.” The video flickered off and the screen filled with data, but Sherlock could see that John wasn’t watching.
“Grab my Med Kit. There is a Sonic Set in there. I can repair the damage with it.” John’s voice was curt and he avoided Sherlock’s gaze.
"Why not? It's not like it's your first kill, you're a Captain in the Royal Navy. You don't get that ranking without having a whole country's worth of blood on your hands."
"What are you going to do? Arrest me?" John shifted in the bed, his head cocked to the side and an empty smile on his lips. "You have nothing to charge me with, and even if you did, you could never make them stick."
After a long while, John managed to haul himself and the unconscious Siren back onto his Star Sailor. He made a bed for Sherlock out of a pile of ropes and blankets, his long frame taking up most of the deck.
Sherlock tried to watch the show, he honestly did, but he could only focus for a few minutes at a time. The Doctor would say something witty, making John laugh and sending Sherlock's head spinning wildly.
"Happy Christmas John." John kissed Sherlock again, smirking at the sigh that fell from the younger boy's chest as he licked into his mouth.
“I used to read it to him when he was a child. He loved hearing about the adventures of Bilbo and the Dwarves.”
Greg was instantly by their side, scanning his eyes over Sherlock skeptically for a moment before John saw the recognition set in. John could feel the tension pouring off his boyfriend, and saw the shame forming on Greg's face.
"I could say the same for you Mr. Holmes. You used to swing your little wooden sword and spin your little tales of how you would be the most feared pirate captain to ever sail the high seas. You used to curse your parents when they talked of you taking over the command one day. What happened to that little boy eh?"
"Yeah, that was pretty cool Bug." John glanced at Harry's partner, offering the boy a shy smile. "I-I'm John, by the way." He offered his hand to the boy, who blushed slightly before taking his hand in a firm grip.
Sherlock placed his headphones in his ears, trying to block out the sounds of the crowded coffee shop. Victor had always hated this place, though Sherlock never knew why. He enjoyed the homey atmosphere, and the owner, Mrs. Hudson, was an old family friend.
John tightened the mainsail rope, tethering the ship to an energy pocket so they could rest for the night. He looked out off the edge, watching Sherlock as he swam amongst the stars.
"-Because I-I'm definitely not- I-I mean- I've th-thought about i-it-" Alarm spiked through John when he noticed Sherlock's breathing become erratic and he reached across the table, taking his boyfriend's hand.
“What did he mean by; ‘show me a good time?’” Sherlock asked, speaking for the first time in a while. John blushed furiously, busying himself with organizing his kits. “I am not familiar with this phrase.”
Before John had the chance to react, Sherlock had stepped back, leaving John reeling and breathless. John rubbed his hands over his face, trying to control his breathing. This wasn’t supposed to happen. He couldn’t start anything with Sherlock, not when he only had a couple of weeks left.
John was sitting in Sherlock’s lab, holding the leather-bound copy of the Hobbit the young man had refused to part with.
“God, Greg. What have I done?” The other man came closer, sitting on the floor beside Sherlock and rubbing his hands over his thighs and sighing heavily. “How can I fix this?” Gavin was quiet for a long while, the silence of the room only broken by the machines keeping John alive.
“Here we go.” He whispered, picking up the sterling silver blade he was to use for the ritual. “Watch the door. Warn me if someone is coming.” He inhaled and drew the blade over his skin, wincing as the blade cut him. He let the blood drain from his hands, chanting a few words in Latin as he soaked the herbs in his blood. He then moved closer to Sherlock’s body and lifted his hand, slicing the palm and letting the blood flow and mingle with his own and the herbs. Once there was enough, he wrapped Sherlock’s hand tightly and set the bowl on his chest.
When they arrived at the restaurant, the owner, an overly-friendly man named Angelo, gushed over the teens, even placing candles between them.
“He can’t hear you.” Moriarty stepped close to Sherlock, grinning coldly up at the Siren. “You like the song? I spent weeks perfecting it. Exactly tuned to manipulate the deepest points of his Life Force. His mind is gone, and he will do whatever I want him to.” John felt his blood run cold when Moriarty pressed his lips to Sherlock’s and kissed him. The Siren didn’t respond, but also didn’t fight.
“I’ll miss you too Love.” Sherlock smiled and leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to John’s lips. “I’ll be back soon.” He left before the pale man could lock him in again.
When Sherlock got home, he sat in his chair, thinking about John, and how drastically his life had changed in a single day.
They giggled helplessly for a minute before Sherlock managed to compose himself. He lifted his head and stared down at his blogger, who was smiling fondly up at him. He dropped a soft kiss to the tip of John's nose. John blushed and giggled, placing a hand on Sherlock's cheek and kissing him softly.
They stopped before the classroom, Sherlock turning to face the boy that had escorted him to class. He was short, shorter even than John, with a round face and stocky features.
“Who the fuck do you think I am, Hermione Granger?” Sherlock snapped, rolling his eyes and placing his fingers against his chin in a steeple. “That watch you used has nothing to do with me. It was just symbolic.” Greg looked lost, and John moved to check on his friend’s hands.
"Get fucked, Freak." Anderson snapped, sending Sherlock a glare. John sent Sherlock a warning glance before he could snap back. Sherlock sighed, rubbing a hand over his face and smiling snidely at the officer.
"Two weeks from yesterday." Sherlock nodded, wiping his eyes hurriedly and sighing roughly. "Sherlock-"
“Well shit.” John grumbled after a few minutes of reading. He looked up and caught Sherlock’s eyes. “Your burn is tainted with the blood of one James Moriarty.” Sherlock felt a wave of nausea grip his stomach at the thought of having Moriarty’s blood under his skin.
"See anything interesting?" To anyone that didn't know John, they wouldn't be able to hear anything wrong in that statement. But to Sherlock's ears, his tone was laced with suggestion and teasing, and it sent a jolt of desire through the detective. He tried to glare at John, but judging by the way the blogger smirked and licked his lips again, he had failed.
“Yes. We were slotted to film together and there was a connection. Or, he said there was at least. It was my first year filming so I took any job I could get.” Sherlock went quite for a long while, the only sounds filling the bathroom were water splashing and John pressing soft kisses to Sherlock’s neck and shoulders.
“What the hell are you talking about Sherlock? You’ve only been in the coma for a year.” Sherlock stepped back, looking terrified and uncertain. John shook his head, blinking rapidly a few times. He tried to speak, but there were no words.
Sherlock felt his cheeks burn and he shifted in his seat, his mind supplying an image of John that he really shouldn't be thinking about when there were people around.
Pain was the first thing John felt when he came too, a burning sensation lancing through his shoulders and spine as he blinked his way to consciousness.
Sherlock stood, his body trembling and eyes filling with tears. He reached for his coat, already sensing that John was going to want him to leave. Victor had found his hair pulling kink disgusting.
"That was horrific." Sherlock mumbled into the crook of his neck, making him laugh. "I'm sorry John, I thought Mycroft was going to be at Geoffrey's overnight-" John pulled back, cutting his boyfriend's words off with a soft kiss.
"God, you're a bloody git sometimes, you know that?" John growled against his lips, sucking and biting the bottom one as firm hands pressed his hips back against the mirror. "You know, I've been here for an hour, watching you dance."
He released Sherlock's arm, lowering himself back onto his chair and grabbing a chip, smiling up at the boy.
“I’m not going anywhere John.” The Prince grinned and leaned up, pressing another kiss to his new husband’s lips as the music continued to play.
It had been just over a week since they had agreed to take things slow, and the prospect of being alone with John for a whole weekend made Sherlock slightly overwhelmed.
“Fine.” The door finally swung open, Sherlock finally releasing it. He had started practicing with his abilities, which usually meant locking John in various rooms and preventing him from leaving. “I don’t know why you have to go see this friend. Am I boring you already?” John sighed, stepping close to Sherlock and offering him an understanding smile.
“Such a good boy. Come up here Gorgeous.” Sherlock climbed into his lap, straddling his hips and tucking his face into the crook of John’s neck. “God you’re perfect. Let me help you with that.” He pulled open Sherlock’s trousers and took him in hand, relishing the gasp that came from the young man.
“I will explain everything later, but first I need you to tell me how to sail this damned ship.” John blinked, blood flowing steadily into his eyes. “John, please. We are running out of time-”
“Jesus, Sherlock.” He propped the lanky man against the door, taking care to avoid jostling his ribs. Sherlock leaned against him, pulling him close and latching on to John’s pulse point, biting and sucking hard. It took all his willpower to pull himself out of Sherlock’s grasp. “Sherlock, come on. Let’s get you to bed.” He batted the pale man’s hands away from his trousers and slipped under his arm, trying to haul the pile of limbs towards the bedroom.
“No. I’m taking you to bed, then you are going to get lots of rest. Then, once you’ve healed, I will let you do whatever you want to me. Deal?” Sherlock’s eyes darkened, and he leaned forward, trying to kiss John again. The doctor pushed him back, pulling an irritated whine from the young man. “Deal? If you don’t behave I will take sex off the table, understand?” Sherlock froze before nodding, his face darkening. “Understand?”
John turned out to be a horrible dancer, he fell several times, and kept missing steps or landing on Sherlock's feet.
Sherlock shook his head, frowning slightly. He wasn't beautiful. He was lanky, bony, too pale and way too thin. His bones stuck out at odd angles, enhanced by weird, wiry muscles.
“John, you need to calm down.” Mikey’s voice was soft and he was reaching above John’s head, pressing a button and flooding John’s system with a sedative. John could feel his joints becoming heavy and his breathing start to slow. “I’m sorry John, you can’t abuse your body like this, you haven’t finished treatments-”
“This John, does he love you?” Sherlock’s chest seized in a heavy sob as he nodded. “And you love him in return?”
"Hmm, nope. Don't want to." Sherlock sighed and pushed at John's shoulders, his cheeks burning hotter as the girls started giggling.
“Sherlock! You need to calm down! You’re going to hurt yourself!” The Candelabra kept getting closer, so Sherlock kept trying to push away.
"No, I don't. I told him that he was going to leave Mum like that, then he could lose my number too. Tell him to get fucked." John yelped as Sherlock swatted him, sending his boyfriend a mischievous grin. "That all Bug?"
“No one deserves this Sherlock. You didn’t do anything wrong. He tortured you, forced you to do those things. You had no choice, and forcing yourself to suffer won’t make the regret go away.” Sherlock’s eyes filled with confusion and he furrowed his brow.
Sprawled out on the mouldy floor was his consciousness, pale and thin, obviously strung out on too many drugs. The sickly frame was shivering and muttering uselessly. He knelt beside the body, feeling an overwhelming sense of gratitude that John hadn’t met him when he was like this.
"Sorry, but I-I have to do this." The confidence in the boy's eyes was quickly replaced by panic and fear. "If- if he finds me-"
“If I give you one week, I’ll fall more in love with you than I already am. I wouldn’t survive losing you.” John sniffled and Sherlock tasted their tears mixing together on their lips.
“They’ll do worse than that Mate. They’ll kill you, and ship him back to the Siren Palace.” That wasn’t good, Sherlock tried to hide the concern that made his chest tighten. He couldn’t let anything happen to John.
“Well, well, looks like the good doctor is awake.” A strange, almost melodic voice cut through the fog and made the fire behind his eyes burn brighter. “Good, it was getting so, boring.” The blurred image of a man filled his line of sight and John felt a hand grip his chin, forcing his face up to meet dark, empty eyes.
"Well, you got me under here, and I'm still waiting for my kiss." Sherlock rolled his eyes but leaned down, pressing his lips timidly against John's.
"Can we just go to the dance now?" Sherlock pushed the door open, sliding out into the cold evening air. John pushed down the stab of hurt in his chest and followed his boyfriend, grabbing the taller boy's arm. "John-"
“I don’t know. Maybe they were forking around.” The Candelabra laughed at his own joke, but all John could manage was a tight smile. Greg noticed instantly and stepped closer. “What’s wrong John?”
I would tell you, but Mum is home and I would really rather not have her barge in on that conversation – JW
For years, he had faked emotions, living empty and cold. Then a strange Siren saved his life and brought back a part of him he never thought he would ever get back. He truly loved the Siren in his arms, and for the first time since he was seventeen, he felt the burning sensation of love returned coursing through his veins as Sherlock grinned back at him.
"Protect me from what?" Sherlock smirked as the boys eyes widened, feigning fear and innocence better than most children could manage. "Am- Am in danger?"
"Remember to breathe, alright Love?" He whispered, resting his hand on Sherlock's cheek as the younger man nodded. He watched Sherlock's face as he pushed in, reading the varying levels of pain that flashed over the man's face.
"Why are you defending that-" John stepped closer to Anderson, the boy who had, no doubt, started the whole attack.
"Hey, are you free Saturday?" Sherlock furrowed his brow, but nodded anyways. "Perfect, you're coming over to mine and we are going to watch White Christmas." Sherlock glanced up at that, cocking an eyebrow at the grinning young man across from him.
A loud gasp escaped Sherlock as he felt John's mouth gently take the tip of his erection in his mouth, sucking softly and sending shocks of pleasure along his spine.
“No, no don’t speak. The wolf got your throat and the Master doesn’t want you to damage your vocal chords anymore than they already have been. I am assuming this is a long shot, but can you write?” Sherlock feebly nodded, hearing the surprised sound the mysterious voice made at that. “Excellent. That will make communicating with you easier. There is a pad and pen by your hand. Can you reach it?” Sherlock glanced down and saw the pad, taking it painfully in his hand and nodding.
"I want you to ride me until your legs give out, then I'm going to flip you over and fuck you until you scream." John's eyes widened and his breath stuttered, and Sherlock felt his erection jump against his thigh and smirked.
John grinned, leaning up and catching his boyfriend's lips in a deep kiss. He stepped forward, crowding Sherlock back against the table. He gripped the back of Sherlock's thighs and lifted the taller boy onto the table, chuckling softly at the gasp that fell from Sherlock's lips.
“Hang on a minute.” The Beast sprung up from his chair, racing from the room and leaving Sherlock alone.
“John? Sherlock?” A new voice came from the doorway, pulling more memories from the dusty, abandoned corner of Sherlock’s mind. He pulled away from John, looking towards the voice and saw Mycroft, his older brother, standing in the door.
"So? No one else is here, I can have you here, on the table, over the arm of the sofa, wherever I want." John tugged the sheet off Sherlock's hips, sucking a dark mark into the skin of his neck as he pulled the other boy close.
"Backseat, I have something for you." John climbed out of the car, ignoring the slightly irritated huff the other boy sent him. He slid into the backseat, reaching into his jacket pocket and breathing a sigh of relief as he felt the item he had hid in there. Sherlock also slid into the backseat, his cheeks slightly flushed and an amused smirk on his lips.
"Overreacting? John, my dance partner has a broken leg! The competition is in three weeks! I have no one to practice with, and this competition counts for over half of our final score-" John gripped Sherlock's wrists, prying his fingers out of his hair and pressing soft kisses to his knuckles.
They chatted about bees and music and art for hours, Sherlock starting to let his walls down a little more each time John laughed.
They had started this relationship shortly after John moved back to Baker Street, and were finally getting past the awkward, I-have-no-idea-how-to-do-this stage. John always insisted on talking through anything that came up between them, especially things revolving around sex. Not that it was necessary, neither of them really had any major kinks to negotiate.
"Harriet left about an hour ago, said she was going to walk home." John blinked at Sherlock, shock and frustration filling his mind.
“You remember the story?” Sherlock asked, suddenly turning to face John, the concern evident on his face.
“Sherlock!” His voice was a broken whisper as he stumbled over to the bed, falling to his knees and pulling Sherlock into his arms.
"Sorry Love, maybe next time." An idea made it's way into his mind and he pinned Sherlock down, ignoring his protests. "When's your birthday?"
“He’s dead Sherlock. Well, he will be soon enough.” Sherlock could hear Molly and John’s other friend starting to panic as he fought the tears. He looked back up at his brother, this time noticing the pale form of John’s spirit hovering by the taller man.
“What is the difference?” John grinned and adjusted the sail slightly before securing the rope. He headed to the back of the boat and pulled out a bundle of wires and chords.
Just a note...I know nothing about the porn industry so if I have some details wrong about how it works I apologize...Enjoy<3
“I killed you. If I hadn’t- hadn’t wanted to try and fix you-” A sob caught in his throat and he reached for the ghost, knowing he must look insane, trying to touch something that wasn’t there. “Gods, I miss you. I need you here.”
"John! Stop distracting Sherlock! We have to practice!" John grinned, tearing his eyes away from his blushing boyfriend to glare at his little sister. Harry and Sherlock had been slotted to dance together again, so that meant that John had an excuse to watch them practice.
Greg handed him the large needle, holding his hands close to give John the extra light he needed. John took a steadying breath, pressing the needle against the pale skin. He hated doing this without anesthesia, but Sherlock was out of time.
“You would be correct Miss Mouse.” John glanced around the room, suddenly feeling incredibly nervous. “There is a way to tell, but it’s can be dangerous.”
Once his body stopped emptying itself, he stood on shaky legs and stumbled to the bathroom, emptying the bucket into the toilet and rinsing it out. He brushed his teeth, avoiding his reflection in the mirror. He must look like shit.
John hadn’t been lying about making him eat. Mrs. Hudson had woken him a few hours after the beast had left him alone, pulling him from his terrified dreams with gentle words and soothing sounds. He was grateful for her kindness, her mindless chattering helped him to calm down enough to keep the food down.
"M-My bag, l-lubricant-" John hurried to his feet, catching Sherlock's lips in a rough kiss before crossing the room to rifle through Sherlock's bag.
"I love you." He mumbled, his cheeks burning with embarrassment as e slowly came back to reality. Even though they had been intimate, Sherlock still felt uncomfortable initiating physical contact. John grinned and leaned up, catching Sherlock's lips in another kiss, leaving the dancer breathless and dizzy.
“You don’t fuck with Time!” Sherlock spun away, gripping his fingers in his curls and growling in frustration. He suddenly turned around and pointed at John, stepping closer with a dangerous smirk on his face. “Except for you, you can fuck with me all you want.” John flushed, his mouth opening and closing in shock. He had been hit on by men before, in clubs and whatnot, he had even snogged a guy in a bathroom stall one time, but no one as attractive as Sherlock. The tall man winked at him and lowered his finger. He turned his attention to Greg, looking vaguely annoyed at his presence. “You’re still here?”
“No. I must have dropped them.” Sherlock mumbled, stumbling to the black door and pounding on it. “My Landlady should be home.” Sure enough, the door swung open to reveal a sweet older lady.
“You are letting him go?” Mycroft was practically screaming at John, pacing as well as he could in front of the Beast. “You can’t just let him go! He won’t make it out there! You saw what happened to him the last time!”
“Pick your favorite page. Your favorite image your ancestors drew.” John’s brow furrowed in confusion, but he followed his friend’s demand, flipping to his favorite page in the book. He handed the open book back to Sherlock, still feeling slightly lost. “Why did you choose this one?”
"I told you, I was bored." John gripped Sherlock's shoulders and spun him around, slamming him back against the wall and tangling his hand in Sherlock's unruly curls and tugging. "And I love making you so desperate."
"Such a good boy." John growled, biting and sucking a dark mark against his sternum. Sherlock's erection pulsed, dripping precome onto John's hand as a fresh wave of arousal washed over him at John's words.
"Yes, I did, and I'm trying to show you that I don't think we need to discuss it. I was over-tired and frustrated and I snapped. I'm not taking it back and if you are uncomfortable with it then I suggest you look for another flatmate." Sherlock pushed past his friend and started for his room, he had left his phone on the table by his-
He dropped his phone to the floor when an image of a grown man dressed in a nappy while sucking another man off appeared on his screen. He scowled as John laughed, embarrassment painting his cheeks crimson.
“What I want to show you is downstairs, I’ve got to carry you for a bit, but as soon as we get past the stairs I have a wheelchair for you to use.” The creature stepped forward and held out his paws. Sherlock thought for a moment, debating with himself. The logical side of his brain was screaming at him to not trust him, that if he went with The Beast he wouldn’t see the light of day again.
“God this is weird.” Greg laughed as he placed his bag on Sherlock’s bed, glancing between the unconscious form on the bed and the ghost beside him. He had been out and about, gathering supplies and preparing. His phone went off, signaling the arrival of his boyfriend, Sherlock’s older brother.
“Sherlock!” He shouted, stepping towards the angry young man. Sherlock froze, spinning to find John. He saw him and grinned, a bright smile that looked out-of-place on his pale, lifeless face.
“Ah! So he does speak!” Mike laughed, causing Sherlock’s cheeks to warm. He would never get used to how easily the human body reacted to things. “You know, less outright gorgeous.” Sherlock’s cheeks burned brighter and he glared at the half-empty plate before him, unsure as to what to say.
He made his way out of the room, quietly walking down the hall. The ceilings were high, the walls filled with detailed paintings and intricate tapestries. He studied the artwork with a sense of awe, wandering the halls aimlessly.
John, ever the observant one when it came to what aroused Sherlock, chuckled as he stroked Sherlock faster.
“What’s wrong Honey? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” The pair stepped inside, closing and latching the door behind them. Sherlock stumbled backwards, his eyes searching for something he could use as a weapon.
"Hey, don't think about that right now Love, let's just have fun, and we can talk about it later, good?" Sherlock nodded timidly, offering John a smile that was just a little too sad for Christmas day. "I love you."
A tall, thin, pale young man was tied to the mast, hands bound above his head. He was shouting at one of the crew members and tugging on his restraints.
"Hey Love." Sherlock turned to face the other man, trying to determine how long he had been crying. "Brittany's gone." Sherlock nodded, the nausea returning.
"What the- oh, I'm going to kill you Watson." Greg growled, trying to turn and bolt. John laughed, grabbing his friend by the hips and shoving him forward. "I swear to God Watson, you and your fucking boyfriend-" Greg fought to escape, but despite his shorter stature, John Watson was incredibly hard to fight off.
“Redbeard!” He screamed, knowing it was futile, that the horse was probably long gone. He grabbed a large stick and scrambled to his feet, swinging at the beasts. His stick connected with the jaw of the leader, the broken bones in his wrist grinding together painfully. He realized his mistake as soon as wood connected with flesh.
“John, John please. Don’t- don’t leave. I-I’m sorry. God, I’m so sorry.” Sherlock was mumbling against John’s lips, tears slipping from the corners of his own eyes and he begged for John to stay. “I lo-”
"N-Nothing. I said nothing. Just, pick up the files." John frowned and stepped closer, his foot catching on the chair. He grabbed his foot and cursed in pain.
“No, I can feel him manipulating the energy in the flat, so he has power. He’s just ignoring me.” John sipped the cold beer that had been placed in front of him, determined to not leave the pub until he was too drunk to miss Sherlock. “I miss him Greg.” John’s friend looked at his own beer awkwardly, still not fully sure how to handle John and Sherlock’s relationship.
Mike obviously hadn’t gotten the ‘No Emotions’ memo, as he spent the entire night flirting with, and clinging to John. It was obvious John had an emotional connection with the other man, as he flirted back.
"Sherly is the best dancer in the whole troupe." Harry stated, wrapping an arm around Sherlock's waist and pulling him in for a hug. The taller boy looked shocked and slightly uncomfortable at the contact, quirking an eyebrow at Harry before reluctantly placing his arm around her shoulder.
As Harry's partner sprung out of their original position, and John felt his jaw drop open in shock. Harry was dancing with a boy, a tall, thin boy that John recognized from his class.
"John, why are they whistling?" John stopped and spun, pushing Sherlock against the stair banister and kissing him deeply. The Rugby team let out a chorus of approving shouts and whistles, but Sherlock was too lost in the intoxicating confidence of his boyfriend to care.
Sherlock, brilliant as always, seemed to read what was going through John's mind. His cheeks darkened and a timid, sly smile pulled at his lips. He stretched dramatically, letting out a soft moan as his joints popped softly. John felt his mouth run dry as he watched Sherlock's little show, and he shook his head, tugging his jeans on and doing his best to scowl at his boyfriend.
It was a short journey, but Sherlock stumbled three times and very nearly ran into the door frame. His mind was spinning, making it difficult for him to focus on anything other than John's hands.
Victor would have yelled at him for being tardy, called him a moron or something just as degrading. He shook his head, he didn't want to think about Victor anymore, not when he was supposed to be meeting John.
His lips were red and swollen, glistening with saliva and pre-come. His normally pale eyes were darkened with lust, the pupils blown wide.
“Nothing that concerns you Mr. Stamford. Thank you for your help. You can assure Mr. Watson that his Med Bills are paid for and will be covered until he is no longer in need of medical assistance.”
The Spider had a fast ship, but John’s little vessel was smaller and quickly outran the massive boat.
It was soft, tender, and loving. John made sure to put every ounce of emotion and love into every movement, every kiss, every touch.
"Come back to bed John, I'm still bored." John choked on his breath, his cheeks burning at the thought of being with Sherlock sexually while his parents were waiting for them.
“Get off!” John managed to worm his way out of Sherlock’s grip, shoving the younger man away before stalking off. He was hurt, angry, and just needed to be alone.
"I thought I told you to leave him alone?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, tugging at the hem of his shirt and blushing. "Sherlock-"
“So, you’re pretty quiet.” Mike grinned at Sherlock, leaning across the table. “Not exactly John’s type, he does tend to go for people that are a little less-” He waved his hands at Sherlock, a gesture the Siren didn’t understand.
“Goodbye Sherlock Holmes. It’s been fun.” John hardened his tone as he turned to walk away, only getting a few steps before Sherlock gripped his elbow and threw him back against the wall. He fought as Sherlock grabbed his chin and kissed him harshly. “Get off me Sherlock.”
They parted ways far too soon, Sherlock could have stayed talking to John until Mrs. Hudson closed the store, but the other man had to work.
“He’ll live, I’m not going to promise a full recovery though, there was extensive nerve damage to his hands-”
"You got accepted into the basic training program." John dropped his hand, pain and sadness washing over him. Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the seat in front of him, blinking rapidly as his breathing became shaky. "Wh-When do you start?"
There was a part of Sherlock that was excited about graduating, finally escaping the daily hell of school.
"Alright, we'll be right down." Sherlock hung up the phone and spun to face his brother, forcing a confident grin on his face. "Come along Brother Mine, our chariot awaits." He started to hurry out of the room, but was stopped by a firm hand on his elbow.
“What do you remember?” John rubbed at his eyes, wincing as the I.V. in his hand pulled uncomfortably.
Sherlock met John at Rugby practice, setting aside the overwhelming fear of being rejected to pull his boyfriend in for a tight hug.
As much as John enjoyed the prep, he hated the awkward minutes leading up to filming. Those moments when he was passed around, inspected by the directors and instructed on what to do.
John’s guidebook was old, not like the new digital ones most of his comrades used. His had been passed down through his family tree, hand drawn maps and diagrams, showing just how much humans had discovered throughout the centuries. He gingerly flipped through the pages, unable to resist the urge to read the notes and stories his ancestors had written.
John released his hair and started tugging urgently at his trousers, pulling them open and slipping them down as far down as they would go.
“Are you fucking kidding me?” The new voice caused Molly to shriek, spilling her wine and latching on to John’s side. The smoke was starting to clear as John pried the terrified girl off his arm and stood, looking around trying to find where the voice had come from. “A binding ritual? Of all the rituals, you could have chosen you had to chose a binding one?” John found the man the voice belonged to, and felt his stomach hit the floor. The new man was propped against the doorframe, all limbs and curls. He was dressed in a black suit that fit him perfectly, and the pale light of the candles accentuated the harsh angles of his face, making him seem almost alien.
John let out a whimper of shock and pleasure as Sherlock pushed him back against the door frame, tugging at his shirt and biting at his lips.
“Pleasure to actually meet you in person Mr. Watson.” John smirked and waved slightly at Mycroft, his discomfort reaching new heights. “I must say Sherlock, I’m slightly jealous. You appear to have landed quite the doctor.” John choked on his breath, lapsing into a coughing fit.
Massive black tentacles wrapped around the vessel, tipping it dangerously and causing John to slide across the deck.
"John! Seriously stop, I'm going to urinate on you." John laughed harder, but stilled his actions, simply holding the detective. The doctor pulled back slightly and kissed Sherlock deeply, still laughing against his lips.
"I'm a pirate captain that controls a fleet of ships nearly 20 wide. I would be concerned if you didn't know my name." The young man smirked, a glint of mischief in his eyes. John felt a flare of danger in his gut. This strange young man had piqued his interest to say the least. "You have me at a disadvantage though, I've yet to learn your name." The young man licked his lips and chuckled.
He didn't know how many more of these Christmases he would have with Sherlock, but he silently vowed to make every single one of them as amazing as this one.
"Stay here Dearie, I'll be right back." Mrs. Hudson left, leaving Sherlock alone for a few minutes before returning with a small black bag.
"I know, but everyone needs to see White Christmas, and I don't want to wait five months." Sherlock felt a smile tugging at his lips again at the boyish grin on John's face. "What do you say? We can get take-away, curl up under heavy blankets and watch the best Christmas movie ever?" Something clicked in the back of Sherlock's mind, and he felt panic start to rise in his chest.
“Oh, that’s up to John to decide Dearie. Why don’t you ask him next time you see him?” Sherlock frowned at the sandwich on his plate, picking at the bread. “What’s wrong Sweetie?” Mrs. Hudson’s voice was soft and she hopped closer to him. He sighed and pushed the plate away, no longer hungry.
A firm knock at the door startled both boys, John sitting upright and Sherlock popping up from under the blankets, his cheeks red and an overwhelmed scowl on his face.
"My brother is not dead, Mr. Holmes, I know it. Please, look at his case." She left the file on his coffee table before turning and leaving his flat.
"Okay Love?" He debated nodding, just sucking it up and taking it, but it was painful and he didn't want to upset John again. He shook his head, whimpering as John slowly slid the finger out.
“So, how does this whole ‘harnessing Time’ thing work? Is that pocket watch like a Time Turner or something?” Greg asked, pulling Sherlock’s attention from John. The taller man looked irritated at Greg’s questions.
They ran through the streets of London, giggling like children and never releasing one another's hand.
When they arrived at the school, John drove around to the far back corner of the parking lot, taking care to keep away from any other vehicles, while still staying under the streetlights.
"Sher-Sherlock- there was a fight- in- in the studio-" John slammed his books shut, grabbing his bag and racing past Mikey, his thoughts a mix of anger and concern for his boyfriend.
They both had until the end of the week to complete the bet, so when Greg called them out to help on a case, he decided to use the opportunity to win the bet.
“There is no need to thank me or repay me Sherlock. I don’t know how long it will take for you to heal fully and I don’t want you to get bored again. I think you reacted to something you inhaled up in the far wing.”
"M-Mrs. Hudson insisted I be prepared for anything." John's cheeks darkened as he laughed, returning to stand in front of Sherlock, lubricant in hand.
John went about setting up the lab, feeling slightly awkward knowing Sherlock was just there, watching him work. The ghost kept writing out instructions about how he wanted everything laid out.
"Well, I wouldn't say that." Sherlock's head sprang up almost comically and he stared at John with wide, shocked eyes, his lips parted slightly. "I mean, I'm seventeen. A bit early to be deciding something that important, no?" Sherlock seemed to be frozen, the only movement was the rapid blinking. "You alive over there?" Sherlock shook his head, snapping his jaw shut and blushing.
"It's none of your concern, Greg. He's just jealous because he wanted Sherlock to go to the dance with him. Tell the guys, if anyone bothers him without valid reason, they will have to deal with me."
"She won't let you go until you agree." John offered, laughing at the distressed expression he received.
"Your brother went missing fifteen years ago, Ms. Watson, the odds of finding him alive are abysmal."
"Alright, I'll text you before then." Sherlock nodded, feeling his chest tighten at the thought of not being able to kiss John goodnight. "Goodnight Tiny Dancer." Sherlock smiled, like he always did when John called him that, and chewed on his lip.
"We- we're on t-the- the floor." John chuckled softly, moving back up to kiss his boyfriend deeply, pressing him back against the floor.
“I know, that’s why we have to be quiet and get the samples quickly. They’ll kick us off E2 if they see him.”
"Mrs. Hudson!" Sherlock called from under his blankets, his chest unpleasantly tight. He was due at John's in an hour, but he couldn't bring himself to leave his bed.
“I don’t know. He was unconscious, then the machines started screaming and they kicked me out. They won’t let me back in and they won’t tell me anything-”
“Oh, I think I’m going to enjoy this.” He whispered, kissing John softly before straightening up and walking towards the door. John watched, trying to collect himself enough to respond. “I’ll see you soon, Captain.” Sherlock winked and spun out of the room, leaving John more flustered than he could ever remember being.
"J-John?" Sherlock wrapped his arms around his boyfriend, burying his face against John's neck and sighing.
Sherlock stood in the entrance, hair sticking out in various directions and a dark, angry-looking bruise on the side of his neck. The sheet from the bed was wrapped around his thin frame, making him look dishevelled and gorgeous and well-fucked. John grinned at the younger boy, opening his mouth to comment on Sherlock's appearance.
“I know you’re bored, but you don’t seem to like any of my suggestions. What do you want to do?” John yelped as Sherlock gripped his arm and pulled him back onto his lap. The pale man latched onto his neck, nipping at the skin and pulling a soft, needy sound from John’s throat.
"Fine." John crowed and flipped himself and Sherlock over, moving to rest between the dancer's thighs before he could react. "J-John-"
"Can I help you with something?" Sherlock tried for harsh, but the words came out softer than planned. Something about this Jim boy was making him uncomfortable.
"No! John- stop that!" Sherlock giggled and tried to squirm away. John laughed because he knew the boy wasn't really fighting him, Sherlock could easily knock him off if he really wanted to. "W-Wait- John wait-" Sherlock shoved at his shoulders, and John let off the patch of skin on the boy's neck that he had been worrying into a nice mark.
“What do you think will happen when Time dies? How do you-” John cut Moriarty’s words short with a bullet to the brain.
“You won’t make it, Dear John.” Moriarty growled above him, drawing John’s attention from the young man. “Did I forget to mention? If I can’t have him, no one can.” Moriarty reached around the back of his trousers and pulled out a shiny silver pistol.
“John likes bananas, if you catch my drift.” Sherlock blinked, processing what she just insinuated. He blushed as the words set in. “And going by your reaction, you are quite the fan of them too.”
Sherlock looked nervous, pulling at his jacket and glancing around the ornate room. John stepped closer, rubbing the back of his neck and running one of his fangs along his bottom lip. He had learned a long time ago to not bite his lip.
John was leaving, taking off to go get shot at somewhere across the world, while he was heading to New York to dance at some prestigious academy.
"I know Mate, but it won't matter if John is happy if you're miserable. Talk to him, find something that will work for both of you." Sherlock nodded, his mind spinning as he pushed himself out of the chair, thanking Lestrade and leaving New Scotland Yard.
"I-I'm sorry." He mumbled, cursing the fact that he couldn't discuss such things without freaking out. He hid his face in his hands and fought the tears that tried to fight their way to the surface.
He memorized every emotion that crossed Sherlock's face, cataloguing every sound as the younger boy came, spilling between them just before John pulled out and added his own mess to Sherlock's.
“Never would have pegged you as a submissive Mr. Holmes. I think I might enjoy this.” He tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hair, enjoying the moan that fell from the man’s lips. He pulled until Sherlock’s lips were hovering just above his, not quite touching, but close enough to feel each other’s breath. “Look at you, so desperate for just the slightest taste of me. Is that what you want Sherlock?” The younger man nodded, crying out as John tightened his grip on the dark curls. “Answer me Sherlock.”
“Hmm, attractive and sassy, you are a catch.” Moriarty ran his eyes over Sherlock’s thin frame, his eyes darkening. “I am interested in you because you are smart. You are the smartest man in this town, and you deserve to be with someone that can handle that brilliant brain of yours.” The man stood, straightening his suit jacket and nodding at Moran. “You need someone that can satisfy your needs.” Sherlock jumped as Moran slammed the door, ripping it painfully from his hand before shoving his back against it.
“H-How- I-I thought-” Sherlock smiled fondly and closed his eyes, letting John touch him. Anger flared through John’s body and he slapped Sherlock, sending the Siren sprawling against the deck of his ship. “You fucking shit!” He snapped, glaring at Sherlock as a stunned expression took over his features.
“Until the end of my days, My Beast.” John grinned and leaned up to capture Sherlock’s lips in a tender kiss.
Then, John's arm draped over Sherlock's shoulder, and he abandoned all hope of knowing what was happening to The Doctor and his companion. He slouched further into the sofa and curled against John's side, feigning interest in the show as he listened to John's heartbeat.
His computer dinged, notifying him that someone was trying to message him. He swung out of bed and grabbed the laptop, opening his messenger app before he could stop himself.
“I warned him.” He muttered as he returned to his work. Killing didn’t bother him anymore, not after the war. He finished mixing the ingredients and grabbed the dagger, pulling the sharp blade across his palm and letting the blood flow. He glanced at Sherlock, quickly taking stock of the man lying on the ground. His wound was bleeding fiercely, and his body was starting to convulse due to pain and blood loss.
The voice filled the flat and startled Sherlock. He collapsed to the floor, looking around helplessly as he tried to find the source of the voice.
"I must apologize about Mrs. Hudson, she keeps forgetting her place." Sherlock glared back at the lady, still clearly embarrassed. "Housekeepers should speak when spoken to!"
“Yes, well, it’s a pleasure to meet you Mr. Watson. There is no need for you to worry about moving your stuff, I have no intention of returning to the flat.” Sherlock watched as John’s face fell. The young man fidgeted uncomfortably and swiped his thumb over his nose.
He quickly righted himself and caught Redbeard’s reigns before the horse could run. He soothed the panicked animal before surveying his surroundings. They had fallen down a small incline, revealing another trail. Despite his better judgement, Sherlock decided to follow the new trail in hopes of finding a house or town where he could stay and rest.
"Yeah, but you aren't anymore. And I'm not too keen on the thought of you having to keep quiet while I take you apart." Sherlock felt his knees go weak at those words, and let John lead him out of the party, once again losing himself in the confidence of his boyfriend.
He cowered in the corner as the door swung open to reveal an imposing figure, black horns glinting in the candlelight. A rumbling growl filled the room, causing Sherlock to tremble.
Pain filled Sherlock’s being, drawing him back from the darkness. He tried to scream, tried to call out for John, but nothing happened.
"I would have my men do nothing more than take you down to the Brig. What happens to you down there is none of my concern, as I said; I can't hear anything from my cabin."
"B-But-" John held up a hand to silence the other boy, sending the rest of his team a dangerous grin as they approached.
“You’re welcome Brother dear.” A new voice came from behind John and he spun, grabbing his gun and preparing to defend Sherlock. Mycroft stood in the doorway, looking horrendously unimpressed. John lowered his gun and scowled at the older man.
"Fuck you're gorgeous. Look at you Sherlock, hard and leaking again even though you just came in my mouth." Sherlock keened as John let go of him, gripping his hips with both hands and changing the angle of his own hips.
“Why does the castle crumble like that?” Sherlock asked one day, after another piece fell to the ground. John thought for a moment, trying to find the best words to explain.
John made quick work of his own shirt as well, throwing the clothes in the general direction of his bedroom before scanning his eyes over Sherlock's now-bare chest.
John led Sherlock over to where his team had gathered, introducing Sherlock to the boys, all while keeping a protective arm around the boy's thin waist.
He threw himself onto the bed, feeling a violent sob welling in his chest as he clung to John's pillow. Gavin had been right, he shouldn't have done this. But it was too late to turn back now, so he crawled under the sheets and let himself slip into his pain-fueled tears.
Sherlock was wearing a dark purple dress shirt and tight black slacks, the fabric clinging to his thin frame perfectly. He wasn't wearing a tie, but looked no less posh for it. His face was tinted with a dark blush and he was glaring at the woman, who tutted with amusement before scurrying off, leaving the teens alone in the foyer.
"Don't worry Mr. Watson, I won't be filing any charges against your friends." John blushed, anger rising in his chest as he thought of what his teammates had done.
“In a manner of speaking. We were married.” Sherlock looked at her in shock. “I figured he had left that part out.” Sherlock looked back and saw John, clinging to his lifeless form.
He was carried down a large set of stairs he vaguely recognized from his little venture the other day. At the base of the stairs was an older wheelchair. As promised, The Beast dropped him into the chair and pushed him through the halls.
"J-John- we- we don't- we n-need-" John smirked and dug into his pocket, revealing the packet of lubricant he had grabbed earlier. "Oh-" Sherlock's cheeks darkened and he smiled shyly up at John. "Y-You knew I'd- that we would-" John chuckled and shrugged, kissing him deeply as he ripped open the packet and slicked his fingers.
“They’re idiots.” He grumbled before walking on, Sherlock following a decent distance behind. “You alright back there?” He asked after a while. Sherlock whimpered as they reached the top of the stairs. He was getting dizzy and the pain was higher than it had been all day. “Sherlock?” The rumbling voice had started to fade as he lost the function of his legs, tumbling down the stairs.
“You!” Moriarty shouted, a blast of power flying from him, knocking Sherlock and John back. “Why won’t you just accept that? It’s always going to be like this! You and me!” Moriarty was screaming now, stalking closer to Sherlock and drawing an intricate handgun from his jacket. Sherlock remembered that dagger, he remembered how painful it was when it tore through the skin and muscle the last time he had been shot with it. It was the only gun that could kill him.
Sherlock covered his mouth with his hand, blinking back tears as he remembered the panic in the boy's face.
"I have a passport, government identification, and three years worth of taxes that say my name is Jacob Brownstein. Your 'evidence' isn't worth shit, Detective Inspector." Lestrade growled softly before turning and stalking out of the room.
Sherlock tried to focus on his work, but found himself distracted by thoughts of John. The Beast was different than he had initially thought, kinder and far gentler than Sherlock would have thought possible. He was lost in thought for a while, until he heard the clinking of the Candelabra’s feet on the stone floor. He glanced over, watching Lestrade as he clambered onto the counter next to Sherlock.
He adjusted the pliant body beneath him, lifting one of Sherlock's long legs over his shoulder and positioning the other around his hip, lining himself up so just the head of his erection slipped into Sherlock's body. When he felt Sherlock squirm, trying to press against John further, he shifted his grip, pinning the other man to the bed roughly, smirking down at him.
“Because I don’t want you to.” John let out a humorless laugh, tugging at his hair and blinking back tears.
He pushed the book aside and shuffled closer to Sherlock, never more certain of anything in his life as he watched the Siren’s eyes grow wider with every move he made.
“Must you provoke him? I just got you back, I’m not really too keen on losing you to Greg’s-” Sherlock cut him off with a deep kiss.
Sadness lanced through Sherlock's heart as John glanced up at him, licking his lips in that way that made his heart race and his head spin.
"N-No- please don't stop Daddy. Just- just hurry-" John shushed him and Sherlock felt the fingers move faster within him, his other hand pushing Sherlock back against his chair and moving to tease his nipples.
Sherlock turned out to be an interesting flatmate, conducting crazy experiments and whining about being bored. John began to wonder what happened to his curious flatmate. He did lots of research on ghosts and quickly came up with a plan.
“John!” He screamed, feeling his throat burn with the force of his cries. Moriarty’s blade froze before it struck it’s target, both him and John turning to look at the young man.
John guided Sherlock so he was lying on his back, slipping one of his hands under the hem of Sherlock's t-shirt, making him tremble.
Over the next few weeks, Sherlock slowly started gaining his strength back. His thighs healed first, allowing him to walk around freely. His chest wasn’t healing as well as any of them hoped, the wounds seemingly unable to close. The infection tried to flare up three more times, but each time, John managed to halt it in its tracks.
“I’m done.” His voice was soft and broken, but he saw how the words struck Sherlock as though he used his fists. “I-I thought I could- could do this, whatever the fuck we are, but I can’t. I’m sorry.”
"Don't be sorry Babe, just remember to breathe, yeah?" Sherlock nodded, biting his lip anxiously. "You know, you can touch me if you want." Sherlock's hands twitched and he blinked up at John, feeling lost and helpless. "What's wrong?"
“Oh, right, I must have deleted that.” Sherlock winked at him again and slunk over to a chair that was collecting dust in the corner. He waved his hand and the chair suddenly changed, looking as though it was brand new. He dropped into the chair and stretched out, grinning smugly at John.
John kissed and bit at the skin of Sherlock's chest as he slipped each button from it's hole, teasing Sherlock's nipples as they were exposed. Sherlock shifted his hips, grinding back against John's crotch and moaning as he felt the hardness pressing against him through too many layers of clothes.
"He wants to know when Mycroft is getting back." Sherlock frowned, propping himself up on an elbow and looking lost.
"No, nothing's wrong. I just can't get over how gorgeous you are." John stated truthfully, his heart racing as Sherlock's cheeks darkened further. "Can I- can I kiss you?" He whispered, smiling softly as Sherlock seemed to tense against him. "You can say no, that's fine-" His words were cut short by a timid press of lips against his own. It only lasted a moment, but it was sweet and perfect.
“Please, Sherlock don’t. Y-You love me, remember?” Sherlock’s eyes hardened and he stepped closer to John, gripping his hair and placing the tip of the blade under his chin.
“Good. See you then.” The line went dead and John felt a wave of uncertainty wash over him. He sat at the kitchen table for a while, worrying at his bottom lip and debating whether he should go or not. He jumped a little when he felt Sherlocks arms wrap around his chest. He hummed appreciatively when he felt his lover start to suck a mark onto his shoulder.
“No, that Sherlock died when we were eighteen, didn’t he?” The ghost sighed heavily and mirrored Sherlock’s actions, sliding down the opposite wall. They sat quietly for a moment, remembering their days in Uni.
"I'm the Captain of this vessel boy. You called for a Parlay, consider yourself lucky I'm even talking to you. Parlay is only honoured between pirate captains, not Naval Officers. So, speak before I have Greggy here take you downstairs." He leaned in close and growled into the ear of the pale man. "We've been at sea for a long time and my crew is rather lonely. My cabin does an excellent job of blocking out screams from the Brig." He could feel the tension in the younger man's body grow.
“Please Sherlock- p-please, I-I need-” His words were cut short when Sherlock slowly pressed into him. John’s jaw dropped open in a silent scream and his head dropped to the deck as he was filled. The song swelled, lighting his body up with another swell of crackling energy. They both groaned as Sherlock became fully seated within John’s body, Sherlock stilling his hips to give the human a moment to adjust before moving again.
"Why would taking you for coffee be unfair?" Anger flashed across Sherlock's face, and for a moment, John was afraid he was about to get punched, but the moment was broken when the waitress appeared, placing the chips between them.
“No! I have to help John!” Mike stopped untying Sherlock’s wrists and stepped around him, a look of concern in his eyes.
“Not like that. Mikey and I, we went through a lot together. He was there when I was shot, followed me home when I was discharged. He’s my best friend, and the only one that didn’t treat me different after I got back.”
“I should buy you a tiara.” Sherlock blinked in confusion, causing John to giggle some more. “I think you would look cute with a sparkly tiara sitting on those curls.” Sherlock blushed, unsure how to respond. “Not that I don’t think you look cute anyways, in fact, I think you’re fucking gorgeous.”
“Oh, pish-posh my dear. Where do you think, my son learned his deductive skills?” She winked and walked away, leaving John in a state of shock. Sherlock looked as flustered as John felt and the soldier stepped forward, gritting his teeth.
"Yeah, I uh- I guess that is my name, isn't it?" The boy blushed, smirking up at Sherlock timidly. He looked so young, the smirk on his lips giving him a child-like appearance. "What should I call you?"
"Good enough." He released Sherlock's hair and dropped to his knees, pulling Sherlock's trousers and pants down and taking him into his mouth.
“It’s not safe John. Take Sherlock and run.” With that, Mike turned and hurried back into the compound. John turned and sent a scared look back at Sherlock before pushing past him, heading for the docks.
“Bloody genius, you are.” Sherlock found John’s Kit and slid it over to him, keeping his distance. He sat against the far side of the boat and watched as John struggled with the Sonic Kit. His finger slipped, the skin tearing on an exposed scalpel. Sherlock hurried to his side as John cursed, covering his hand and wincing.
“Alright.” There was annoyance in Lestrade’s voice that made Sherlock chuckle. He liked bugging Gavin. “Have you talked to John recently?” The question shocked Sherlock out of his thoughts and he had to struggle to contain the flush that threatened to take over his cheeks.
"I-I don't know w-what to do." Sherlock mumbled, his cheeks burning with embarrassment. He felt John take one of his hands and place it on his side. The contact sent a thrill through Sherlock and he moved his fingers so they lined up with John's ribs.
“Hey, Sherlock?” He spoke as softly as he could, hoping he wouldn’t scare the young man. “Hey, talk to me Sherlock.” The young man whimpered and he clenched his eyes tight, his fingers twitching against the sheets. “Come on Sherlock, open your eyes.” The young man obeyed, prying his eyes open. John saw the fear fill his face as he tried to move away.
"Fuck! John-" John reached up, shoving his fingers in the unruly curls and tugging Sherlock's head back.
“I love you.” Sherlock whispered as John’s boat started to fade from his sight, taking with it the only being that ever truly cared for him.
Sherlock woke to find himself tied to one of his kitchen chairs. His chest was aching and he could feel the dried blood pulling at his skin as he fought the bindings. Moriarty had knocked him unconscious before leaving, planning on going after John.
Anderson had been bullying Sherlock for most of his high school career, so this was nothing new. Sherlock lowered his head and closed his eyes, trying to will the other boy away.
“I owe you the world young man. Keeping my son healthy, saving his life from those nasty thugs.” She gripped John’s face in her hands and pressed a sloppy kiss to his forehead.
“He is bisexual.” Sherlock blushed and looked at the ground, shuffling his feet. “Now stand still, I have just the outfit for you.”
“Like I said, Chemistry isn’t exactly my strong suit so this just kind of sits here. It’s yours if you want it.” Sherlock spun around in his chair, looking at the beast behind him in awe.
“Fine. I was asked to come and see when you can return to work.” Sherlock’s arms tightened around John’s waist.
“No, you stupid git. I never said I didn’t want to, because God, I do.” He was still slightly breathless and couldn’t resist leaning in and kissing the younger man’s pale neck. “You have a minor concussion, three broken ribs and an open wound. Sex will cause more harm than good.”
“And if it doesn’t?” Greg hesitated, he had been trying to avoid that question.  Sherlock nodded, stepping close to the bed and climbing on, lying down so he disappeared into his physical body. “If I don’t wake up, tell John I love him.” Greg nodded, blinking away the tears as his friend’s spirit faded away.
“I’m already hurt John, what more could I do to myself?” Sherlock snapped, pulling himself to sit next to John. “Can I see the book?” John hesitated, pulling the guide tight against his chest before handing it over to the Siren. Sherlock ran his fingers over the cover, gently opening the pages and smiling at the drawings he saw there. The Siren looked back up at John, his eyes glinting with mischief. “This book is amazing.” John grinned proudly, enjoying the expression on Sherlock’s face.
“I can’t.” John nodded against Sherlock’s neck, tilting his head back and capturing Sherlock’s lips in another soft kiss before stepping away. He reached into his pocket and handed Sherlock his phone.
There was no point in looking for the boy, it had been fifteen years since he had been taken. If he wasn't dead, then he was probably trapped in a sex trafficking ring.
The boat shot through the stars towards the Hope, propelled by disrupted energy waves. John tore off his shirt, the slightly loose fabric catching on the ropes, and tethered himself to the Mast.
Then John’s timeline started to fray. It was subtle at first, but Sherlock noticed immediately. John’s body was dying, Fate was taking him and Sherlock couldn’t stop her.
“Take me out and show me a good time, like you did back on S13 and we’ll call it even.” Mike winked and laughed as John blushed. “Alright Mate, see you soon.” John signed off and tucked his Video Cell back into his bag.
“Sherlock is special Seb. I must have him.” Sherlock felt an unpleasant chill trace his spine as he hurried on.
“You ran away when he told you he found you attractive.” Sherlock pursed his lips, trying to find the right words.
John had decided to wear nothing more than his pajama bottoms, and was currently bustling about his room, organizing his Rugby kit and bookbag.
“What type of person does John, as you say; ‘usually go for then?’” Sherlock’s curiosity won out over the discomfort of conversing with Mike.
He felt darkness flood his senses as he lost consciousness, relief filling his mind as he welcomed death.
Mycroft, for all his irritating flaws, always took care of Sherlock, making sure he was safe and treated well.
The nurse was finished bandaging his cheek, and John waited until she had stepped away before closing the gap between them. He stopped himself before he could grab his boyfriend, reminding himself that Sherlock had been in a fight, and was probably in pain.
“He had pneumonia once as a child.” John nodded and started cutting the bandages away from his chest.
“Are you asking me to meet your parents?” Sherlock hesitated, shifting closer to John’s side and trailing his fingers along the smaller man’s chest and stomach. “Sherlock?”
“Break the seal, break the link.” Sherlock nodded, tracing the burn with one of his long, pale fingers. “What if I heal the burn? I don’t have the equipment on me, but if we can get to a Med Bay I could use my clearance to gain access to it.”
"Take your coat off, stay a while." John quipped, taking Sherlock's bag from him and setting it on one of the chairs before gripping his hips and pulling him close. "Hey Tiny Dancer." He whispered, leaning up and catching Sherlock's lips in a soft kiss.
"Seriously? You guys are sticking up for this freak?" Sherlock felt tears welling in his eyes at the harsh words.
“Lie back. You had a nasty fall, you shouldn’t be moving right now.” A deep, smooth voice came from the edge of the boat.
A whimper escaped Sherlock's lips as he felt a cold, slick finger press against his entrance. John pulled off his erection with an obscene sound, sending a smirk up at Sherlock.
“No. There’s one more step.” He grabbed the bowl and poured the smouldering ashes over the unconscious form, chanting in Latin all the while.
"I love watching you dance." John growled in Sherlock's ear, placing a soft kiss just under the corner of his jaw, grinning when he heard the dancer's breath catch.
As his mind drifted into unconsciousness, he heard the rapid beeping of heart monitors screaming for assistance.
"We haven't been friends in fifteen years Sherlock." The taller man frowned, eyes flicking from John's eyes to his lips for a moment before he suddenly moved.
Within minutes, Sherlock was whimpering loudly, his body relaxed and open as John teased his prostate.
“Eighteen days. My company tracked me down and got me out. We were ambushed on the way out. They didn’t walk away, I did. Took me months to recover then when I did, all I could see in my friend’s eyes was pity and fear.” John looked up and met Sherlock’s eyes, blinking away the tears and taking a steadying breath.
He was hanging off the tallest tower, scrabbling for purchase against the roof. Moriarty stood above him, blade in hand, apparently talking to The Beast.
"Shut up, he did not. Now, smile and be charming. I know you can." They finally arrived at the table, and Greg made an effort to keep his eyes trained to the floor. John and Sherlock kissed and exchanged their greetings, and Greg stood as still and straight as possible. "Mycroft, you know Greg, right?" Greg forced himself to glance up, smirking timidly at the elder Holmes sibling.
"Perfect, we'll come out here for the night, and I'll fuck your beautiful brains out." Sherlock's cheeks darkened again and John laughed, kissing his boyfriend once more before standing, grabbing their shirts and handing Sherlock his.
“That’s better.” John growled as he started stroking Sherlock again, adding just the right amount of pressure. It only took a few more pumps before Sherlock was coming, spilling over John’s chest and hand with a cry. He collapsed on top of John, breathing heavily and trembling. John held him through the aftershocks, whispering praise in his ear and rubbing his back.
“No!” The harshness in Sherlock’s tone shocked John, and he looked up, instantly reading the distress in the Siren’s eyes. “If you heal the cut the seal will be intact. If the seal is intact, Moriarty can find me.” The Siren sighed, wincing as he lowered himself to the deck. “If Moriarty finds me-” He ran his finger through his hair, tugging harshly.
He shot Sherlock a dangerous grin before leaping to the end of the ship, pulling the sail tight and making the boat do a hard turn. He heard Sherlock’s yelp of shock and laughed, adrenaline coursing through his veins.
He stayed there, unmoving, until John came back, his hair no longer dripping and his chest covered by a ratty old t-shirt. He grinned up at Sherlock, who blushed and returned the smile timidly.
"Sh-Sherlock! Jesus, not right now, I just finished!" John moaned, a boyish grin back on his lips as he held the phone just out of reach. Sherlock tried desperately to get his phone back, his mind spinning with panic and his cheeks burning at the way John's voice sounded.
“What’s wrong John? Not used to people standing up to you? I’ll bet no one’s done that since you stood up to your abusive father. How old were you the last time he touched you? Fifteen? Sixteen?” John was crying now, tears falling freely as he stood still, ever the soldier, taking the abuse like he used to.
