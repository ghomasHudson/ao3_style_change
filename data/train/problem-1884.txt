"You don't need to leave" John quickly intervened, his attitude dropping once realising who he was speaking to.
"Yes?" Sherlock's voice came out huskily, John could have came at the sound, oh, this was a new side of him.
"Ah, is she okay with that? I would have invited her but I thought this was more of a couple thing to do, without children"
"Oh, no, no. I'm actually about to head home, Craig is taking me out for dinner tonight. It's our wedding anniversary, not that either of you would know that, considering neither of you attended my wedding"
, John and I will retreat back to his home and I'll be staying there until my flat is refurbished and then who knows, the world is very unreliable place. Anything could happen"
And John grinned at that, an evil yet satisfied smile that Sherlock couldn't even bare to make a comment about. Instead, he watched as John slid down slightly, his hands at work to undo his belt, soon his button and then his zip and as he practically yanked at the material, he had never thought this was a sight he would see.
Sherlock had no idea what he was doing, that was evident to them both but as John pushed down into his lap in a force for friction, Sherlock instantly met his movement. The low moan that escaped his lips was enough for John to cum on the spot although he didn't ( even if he was old and it was probably expected ), to hear the detective unravel beneath him was like nothing else.
"Is that so?" He inches just slightly closer, still enough room between them to fit somebody in between.
"It's just a matter that your father and I forgot about - I guess we got so distracted by the good evening we were all having, we forgot that we had plans" Sherlock lied, straight through his teeth yet it did the job.
"You-" Sherlock attempted to speak, his voice cracking, he clenched his eyes shut as he forced words to escape "you"
Sherlock's breathing seemed to simmer from the touch of John's hand, almost like it sent a wave of relief over his body. It shouldn't have, considering he was the cause of this all.
"Okay, enough" John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose "we don't have time to argue over who's fault it was - Rosie go and get a shower, you have school in half an hour and Sherlock, go and get dressed, you have work"
The question sounded so soft and out of place that it left John momentarily perplexed. “P-pardon?” And then everyone’s eyes were on him.
’s many ivory bridges. The other man’s hand was still smoothly operating John’s plectrum covered fingers, the soothing thrum of music continuing on. It came to a scratching halt when the blonde felt Sherlock’s spare hand snake its way to his inner thigh.
It didn’t take long before the culprit was back in John’s sights. The figure was violently pushing themselves through the crowd, eliciting surprised shouts and angry protests from the many innocent bystanders. Fortunately for John, this meant he was neither slowed down by the hordes of people in the street, nor did he have to try and carve a path for himself through them all, unlike his assailant.
John’s breathing stilled as he strained his hearing, listening out for any other sound to confirm his suspicion that he was not alone. The thick silence and blinding darkness of the night enveloped his senses as he bit his bottom lip in concentration. For the briefest of moments, he began to think he was imagining things until he caught the unmistakable whisper of a sword being drawn from its
"If you keep this up then Mother will surely be rid of you", she whispered, squeezing her fragile frame through the
pillow. Letting out a sigh, he threw the sheets off his still sweating body and stood up to stretch. Taking a moment to look around, he reflected in the way his new room differed to his previous one. Sherlock had insisted that he move from the servant’s quarters to be next door to the dark haired man, not that John had any say in the matter. Nevertheless, John couldn’t say he missed being holed up in the small dark space he had grown accustomed to for so long. His new room was large, bright and airy, with various potted plants dotted about alongside beautiful paintings hanging from the walls. He even had furniture and a futon bed. The only thing he disliked was the uncomfortable pillow, but it was yet another item on the list of things Sherlock said he would get used to. John took a moment to appreciate his new surroundings, but couldn’t help feel a little misplaced. He made his way for the
“It’s better this way, John.” He sounded so very sincere; the apprentice was keen to believe him. “You wouldn’t let me examine you before.” His voice was low and gentle, and John felt soothed by it. His fears however were renewed when the dark haired man moved his gaze away from John’s own to make tracks down his body, stopping at his crotch.
before turning to his companion. “We should go before more imbeciles turn up.” He began making his way down the narrow street with the expectation that the blonde would obediently follow, but John remained exactly where he was.
A heavy pregnant pause had descended soon after Sherlock’s departure. The two blondes remained exactly where they were, avoiding each other’s eyes to squirm uncomfortably. Both of them were sporting an impressive shade of crimson on their cheeks.
Sherlock blinked. "I want you to distract him." He clarified before a brief pensive look crossed his features. "Although I suppose seduction can be rather distracting."
And now John was really starting to worry. He had taken note of the dark haired man’s withdrawn demeanour and had been observing him for about a minute. He followed Sherlock’s line of sight out into the moving crowd, but could see nothing of any interest. He frowned, feeling the need to poke his companion back to reality. He decided his voice would hopefully do the trick instead. “What is it, Sherlock?”
John let out a small yawn as he softly flopped down the stairs from his room. It was late, maybe two or three in the morning? He wasn't sure. He was still half asleep and needing to piss. However he faltered when the smell of cigarette smoke reached his nose, which he wrinkled in response. Attempting to blink himself awake, he made for the living room where he found Sherlock slumped in his armchair. His leather jacket and flat cap had been left discarded carelessly on the floor beside him, revealing the almost skin tight white cotton t-shirt underneath. John gulped, leaning awkwardly against the door frame of the entrance to the room. They both remained perfectly still for nearly a minute, the blonde haired man watching the brunette expectantly. Sherlock's eyes were hooded and fixed on the floor in front of him, as if his mind were elsewhere.
upwards over his head, Sherlock's own connecting with the horizontal bamboo beneath him. For a moment, they struggled for dominance, each sword trembling under opposing forces. John's grimace then turned upwards into a smirk as he shot out a leg from where he was crouched, spinning it out in front of him in the hopes of catching the dark haired man off guard. To his dismay, Sherlock had seen the movement before John had enough time to fully execute the move, jumping backwards out of his reach.
"You are?" He knew all too well that his colleague had been attempting to give up for a while now. John smirked at his flatmate's arrogance as Sherlock blew a cloud of smoke at the older man. He waved it away, glaring at Sherlock as he did so.
sliding open. Both John and Molly stared in horror, the colour completely drained from their faces. Sherlock was stood dripping wet in the doorway, completely naked.
The silver haired man shot an incredulous look at Mycroft only to be met with a pair of raised eyebrows. Lestrade let out a frustrated sigh, standing aside to let the two behind him step forwards. "Donovan and Anderson."
He barely had enough time to process what the other man meant by that comment, when he removed his now saliva covered fingers from John’s face, pressing against the blonde's entrance. His body instinctively flinched away. “Lube...!”, he gasped as one of Sherlock’s fingers traced the outside of his hole. He threw a pleading look at the detective and was met with an expression of indecision, as if Sherlock wanted to make yet another smug comment, but also wanted to cradle John softly in his arms. He removed his hand from his entrance to briefly fumble in the back pocket of his leather trousers. He soon produced a small unmarked bottle of clear liquid, popping it open with his nimble fingers and expertly emptying a sizeable globule into the palm of his hand. John would’ve remarked on Sherlock’s ability to do all this one handed, but he was distracted by the other hand that was teasingly working the head of his cock. His mind was abruptly brought back into the room with the sound of the bottle hitting the floorboards, as Sherlock flippantly tossed it out of his hand. He then returned it to John’s entrance, pressing his lube slick palm into him. “It’s cold…”, murmured John. The glare Sherlock shot at him made him realise that he had said this out loud. He firmly pressed his lips closed only to throw them wide open as he felt a fingertip push into him.
Molly hunched her shoulders, cautioning a quick look around them before leaning towards him to whisper. “What’re you going to do?”
"And the time before that", John croaked. He was grateful for Molly's sympathy, but uncomfortable with the attention. He'd learnt to keep his head down to stay out of trouble, preferring to avoid people than seek them out. He shifted awkwardly, glancing up at the door. "Do you reckon anyone else heard?"
The blonde eventually caught up with him, wobbling as he made his way over to the other man’s side. “Sherlock, I can barely walk in these.” He gestured to his
in his hands. "How do you know all this?!" He shouted, tears of anger and desperation peaking in the corners of his eyes.
Lestrade pointed at John, nodding as he did so. Sherlock rolled his eyes, pulling out a cigarette from an ornate metal case that was sat on his desk and lit it with a match. The other detective groaned, "You bastard, you know I'm trying to quit!"

John wanted to scream. He wanted to shout. Thrash away and cry angry sounds of protest. But when their hands met the strings of the ornate instrument before them, he was spellbound. Together, they created the most beautifully melancholic tune John had ever heard. He watched his own hands as his teacher made them dance effortlessly across the strings. He was completely transfixed. They shared a long moment together of simply creating an endless stream of gracefully sombre tunes. And their song continued on and on and on an-
with tobacco. The smaller of the two fiddled with the three plectrum in his hands, staring uselessly at the sheet music his teacher had placed in front of him. John didn’t even know how to read music let alone play. He considered plucking at least one of the many strings when Sherlock rose and made his way over. The blonde gulped at the sudden movement and lack of communication. He was unable to read the blank expression on the other man’s face, let alone manage to catch his eye. He blinked in confusion when the dark haired man walked right past him in favour of standing behind his apprentice. A moment passed before John began to squirm awkwardly.
As she took the hat from his hands, the guest turned to look at her. “Thank you.” Molly couldn’t stop herself from snapping her face upwards in shock; she wasn’t accustomed to being addressed directly unless it was to be ordered or punished. They both locked eyes for a brief moment before the
He glanced over his shoulder, but looked away in embarrassment when he realised Sherlock had been watching him with keen interest. “Erm...”, John clutched at his damp clothes as he spoke, “Would you mind-”.
It was then that Sherlock crossed over to the desk to grab a soft black leather cap, placing it firmly over his dark curls, while at the same time, removing a pair of fingerless studded black leather gloves from his jacket pocket. As he delicately placed them on each hand, John couldn't help his eyes from widening at the sight of the complete look.
The smaller man let out a small splutter of a noise at the question. He felt like his raised eyebrows were almost touching the ceiling. He must have looked pale because an expression of concern suddenly appeared on Sherlock's face.
He blinked, remembering his purpose. Straightening his posture, he forcibly looked at the other man as he addressed him. “Tell me?”
roof tiles felt comfortable, but it was worth it for the view. Perched at the very top of the House, he wrapped his arms around himself, not wanting to catch a cold. The edges of his worn
John lifted his hand to block out some of the invasive light that was now burning his eyes. Then he caught sight of a figure running towards him and he recognised the bounce of curls bobbing up and down. It was Sherlock.
"Yes", came the other man's curt response. He glanced down from his nose at the tea. "I'll be leaving shortly".
The dark haired man teased his cock and entrance for what felt like hours and John savoured every second of it, not wanting to climax and thus break the spell. As his mind began to drift and ponder how long he could keep this up for, Sherlock's head suddenly jolted downwards to the base of his dick, hitting the back of his throat. The blonde's shout of surprise soon turned into a groan as his flatmate began to bob his head up and down, taking every inch of his member into his mouth. He could feel Sherlock's finger press deeper and deeper into him with each stroke of his cock. The unusual feeling of being penetrated made John want to squirm, but he felt physically and mentally drained, allowing himself to be probed by his flatmate.
“John!” He shouted at him from afar, his voice quieter, but panicked when he arrived by his side. “Are you alright?” The blonde was about to reassure him when his teacher cut in. “You’re hurt.” He eyed John’s wounded leg with such scrutiny that the apprentice almost felt ashamed for having failed to avoid the injury in the first place.
, he kept reminding himself. His thoughts however were disrupted when Sherlock knelt beside him. If the smaller man turned his head now, their noses would be touching. He resolved to stay perfectly still, as if the other man wasn’t even there.
behind them, which were now rapidly making their way towards John. Despite a valiant attempt to swerve out of their way, one of the blades managed to slice open the top of one of his arms. He hissed, wincing in pain as he clutched at the wound. Regardless, he did not break speed nor stumble from the impact. The figure ahead took a brief moment to peek over their shoulder – John just about caught the look of panic in their eyes. They sharply turned around a corner only to be knocked backwards with a sudden clang. The blonde stopped dead in his tracks, blinking at the now semi-conscious body lying in the dirt. Out from around the street corner came Sherlock. John couldn’t prevent the wide grin from spreading across his features. He puffed his response, “Nice shot.”
, he straightened his posture to peer upwards at the sky. There were no clouds to be seen – it was a pure hot summer’s day.
Sherlock grabbed John's aching erection through the cotton of his still damp boxers, smirking at the mess he'd made. "Did I scare you?", he prodded mockingly.
“Hush now.” Mycroft snapped, to which Lestrade threw his hands up in frustration. The dark haired man breathed calmly through his nose and slowly opened his eyes, “Are you sure about this, brother of mine?” He kept his tone steady and calm.
Sherlock blinked, which John took as a yes. He retreated away from the door frame, through the hall and into the kitchen. The living room felt too tense for him to enter.
with gold cranes stitched into the silk. The blonde stood to remove his wet robe, but faltered when he remembered the other man was still in the room.
His head was throbbing when he awoke and everything was still fuzzy. There was whispering outside the room in the garden. Two people were hurriedly exchanging urgent words. The smell of tobacco reached his nostrils.
John and Molly caught each other’s eyes as they sneaked a quick glance at one another. Neither of them said a word for a short moment, causing Lestrade to sigh loudly in annoyance, “Well I guess you’re both to be punished then, eh?” He started to turn away when John stood forward.
Sherlock grinned at his brother, “We wouldn’t have it any other way.” Flicking his eyes over to the frustrated silver haired man, he gave him a cheeky wink before turning to disappear out of the room.
The look of shock suddenly vanished from Mother’s face, replaced with a cool calm expression of confidence. “Really now, brother of mine, what would the local towns people say?” He lifted up his
; their dress was the antithesis of one another. They subconsciously avoided each other’s eyes for a while longer before the dark haired man spoke again.
John placed the bamboo stick against the wall. He’d just finished scrubbing his own blood off it, having attempted to clean blood off himself too. He had struggled to reach to the welts on his spine, awkwardly trying to bend his arm back in an effort to dab at them with a damp cloth. He sighed from exhaustion and allowed himself to sink to the floor, wanting to catch a brief moment to himself before heading back to continue with his chores. The washroom was warm, with steam dancing about the ceiling. John briefly let his eyes drift shut to revel in the newly found solitude before snapping them open and leaping to his feet. Lestrade had practically throw the
“Oi! Watch where you’re bloody going!” Roared the rotund man behind the bar, but the figure continued to fumble wordlessly. Had it not been for the shock, John would’ve grabbed the intruder, but by the time he had registered the situation, Sherlock had thrown the figure off of him who then haphazardly turned to sprint away into the crowd.
And with that, Sherlock downed the tea in one swift swoop, tossed the cup aside and shot forwards to smash their lips together in a fervent kiss.
There was a moment of intense silence. It was broken by the sounds of them both erupting into a fit of giggles.
, she thought. She prayed no one would notice he was missing, feeling grateful for the way in which Mother seemed aghast and therefore distracted by their guest.
Sherlock trotted off out of the room and down the hallway. "Don't wait up!", he called back, as he flew down the staircase and out of the flat, presumably into the waiting cab outside.
John happily munched away at his hearty bowl of ramen, taking pleasure in the large quantities of food he had been supplied with ever since he began his training. It certainly made a nice change from the scraps the servants were forced to divide amongst themsevles back at the House. A pang of concern flashed inside him however – his associate was doing his usual of smoking-instead-of-eating routine. John wanted to pressure him into eating at least something, but he knew his words would be met with some kind of arrogant snipe so he resigned himself to slurping down his noodles.
John felt a twist in his gut as embarrassment flooded his entire being. Dropping the ladle, his threw himself to the floor. Falling to his knees with his hands outstretched and his forehead touching the ground, he was about to beg for forgiveness when he heard a
“It was clear to your female counterpart just now that she’s aware of how much you loathe this place, more it’s people above all else. You struggle being made to be around so many of them all the time because you’re used to being alone, more likely abandoned. Despite your general dislike and probable distrust of others, you fear being left with no one around you. Why? Because you weren’t always alone, not until that fateful day where something precious was taken from you. No…”, he stopped to take a breath, his eyes widening in excitement, “No, it was someone, wasn’t it? Oh it’s always more interesting when it’s someone!” He continued his ramble, “But who was that someone. A lover perhaps? Or maybe a family member, possibly a brother. You two were close, inseparable even, apart from when you were forcibly separated, of course.” Sherlock placed the palms of his hands together to delicately rest his chin on top of his fingers. “And now you’re here. You were sold to this House when you were young, barely in your teens. You’ve had years to plan an escape and been given every opportunity to do so, and yet there you stand. Why stay? Because you think you have more chances of finding your brother in the heart of the city in lieu of randomly searching for him on your own, wherever he may be.” Then he squinted, “There’s anger there too. You want revenge, don’t you? Find your brother, find the person who took him, punish the culprit.” Sherlock relaxed into the warm water, “And that’s why you haven’t left yet.”
just in time to prevent his opponent's weapon from connecting with his neck. Sherlock used their proximity to whisper into his apprentice's ear.
, he waved the match out before John had the chance to make his way over. “Wait...!”, but it was too late and he was plunged into darkness once more. He grumbled his annoyance as he felt his way over to the other man. Following the smell of the smoke that emanated from his pipe, John placed himself beside Sherlock and the two sat in contemplative silence.
from the wide eyed men in the room. John however didn’t notice – his own eyes were glazed over as broken memories of his sister shot through his mind, accompanied by shouts and screams of fear and protest. Despite this, his body continued to dance, flowing through the well-practised moves from muscle memory alone. All of John’s senses appeared to be dead as his mind succumbed to its onslaught of pain and terror from his many reimagining’s of his sister's kidnapping. The only thing that seemed to keep him grounded was the sweet melancholic tunes of Sherlock’s
. The colour then drained from his face upon realising that not only had he fallen asleep on Sherlock’s shoulder, the dark haired man had also carried him to his room and undressed him.
next door slide shut, John let out a loud sigh. Realising that his already calloused hand had been accidentally cut open with the razor, he cursed under his breath. Grabbing a nearby roll of bandages, he wrapped them around his bleeding palm. Tossing the blood stained razor aside, he quickly found another and made for the corridor. He was just about to leave when he noticed Molly was half slumped against the wall, as if struggling to hold herself upright. Worry shot through John as he crossed over to her, “Molly, are you alright?” He placed a reassuring hand on her arm, causing her to instinctively flinch away. John frowned.
It was the second time that morning that Mycroft gawped at his brother. The blonde had now lost count of the amount of times he had done exactly the same. Suddenly, a jolt of panic shot through him: was Sherlock about reveal John for who he really was? He gulped, twitching his nose in anticipation.
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock’s voice continued. John tried to pinpoint the exact location of the voice when he felt the rickshaw bounce somewhat. His teacher had jumped out of the carriage to spin around to John’s side of the vehicle with lightning speed. Offering his arms forward, he smiled softly, “I’ve got you.”
“Ah…”, the smaller man breathed, his quivering hands being slowly crushed by Sherlock’s long nimble fingers. He was about to yank them out of the other man’s grasp when the dark haired man stood with a
“Drink.” Sherlock commanded. The blonde blinked in confusion at him, glancing nervously back at the cup of tea. The dark haired man let out a frustrated sigh. “Anytime, John.” That snapped the smaller man out of his confusion.
Before he could follow that thought any further, he heard a familiar voice call from behind them. “Sherlock!” It was Lestrade. A small number of armed men were following him in tow – John presumed they were hired
"Don't." The blonde just about managed to gasp, his voice sounding a lot more fragile than he intended. But Sherlock continued to ignore his protests in favour of stripping the sedated man right where he lay, vulnerably sprawled across the floor. John wanted to punch him square in the jaw, but the effects of the sedative made his body heavy and limp. He could only watch in horror as the dark haired man pulled away at his
John tried to protest, but his words came out as an incoherent garble. He feebly attempted to twist out of Sherlock’s grasp, but was firmly held in place under his unforgiving hold. Still the blonde wriggled and writhed against the other man’s body, letting out a gasp as he felt his
Sherlock ignored the cuss in favour of calmly taking another sip of tea. John blinked; most people leapt when Lestrade bellowed, let alone swore.
“I should…”, but his words trailed off when he saw tears trickle down Molly’s cheeks. He was about to pull her forwards into a reassuring embrace when she turned to run out the room. John tried to follow suit. However upon reaching the corridor, he barely caught a glimpse of her disappear as she shot round the corner and out of sight. Her soft sobs were barely audible as they faded into the distance. He stood dumbfounded for a moment before recalling his duties. Pushing his concerns aside, he slid the
John’s prior annoyance crumbled; instead feeling a sense of awkward gratitude. “Th-thank you…”, he blushed, grabbing the
, but his head still felt heavy. His eyelids fluttered and his head flopped back into the pillow, the heaviness of sleep rushing through him once more.
This time when John woke, his mouth and eyes felt painfully dry. A persistent throb presented itself in the front of his skull and his limbs were plagued with a dull ache. Furrowing his brow, he blinked several times as he attempted to recall what happened the last time he was conscious. He remembered Sherlock’s smell, his hands, a tight embrace. Then the sensation of lips against his own and overwhelming measures of ecstasy tinged his memories. He recalled hands, lots of hands. And unspeakable things being done to intimate parts of him. John reflexively poked out his tongue in an attempt to wet his lips, but it was in vain. Shoving the cloud of muddled thoughts aside, he set about finding himself some water. He was about to get up when he caught the distant sound of a floorboard creak.
His words were met with a sigh. Then soft hands were gently cupping both sides of his jaw to slowly tilt his face upwards so their eyes met once more. Sherlock had never touched John like this before. The blonde felt a rush of emotions flood his very being: shock, awe, wonder. His eyes sparkled when he caught the warm comforting look he received from the other man. Sherlock smiled softly, “If anyone can do this, it’s you, John Watson.”
Hello all! Sorry for the delay in posting new chapters lately, but I've been travelling for the past few weeks with little time to sit down and write. Anyway I'll be posting more than usual this week to compensate so I hope you enjoy :-)
"So" John starts cautiously, sitting himself up slightly "does that mean you haven't worked out his next move yet?"
John nodded, his body was over-filled with emotion right now. He wasn't even sure how he was talking at the moment, maybe because it was Sherlock and he had wanted nothing more than to hear the egotistic bastards voice for so long that he waned to hold onto it forever.
"- that is not reality, Sherlock. You knew this would happen, we all did, you cannot expect John to wait around forever - and he didn't, he finally found someone who you didn't scare away, as much as you wanted to. Someone who would allow him to buggar off in the middle of the night to chase criminals with you and now he has, you know that there's no going back"
"Fine" She rolled her eyes, finishing her glass of orange juice before standing "I'm going outside to call Sophie, she'll save me from this love fest"
Sherlock turned to John, returning the smile, he lifted their hands to his mouth and placed a gentle kiss on John's own before holding it against his leg again.
“No no no no! It’s like this.” Then without hesitation, he stood behind the smaller man, pressing his body against his and took his wrists in his hands. “Ok now one, two, three, four…” John sighed again, allowing his limbs to be as limber as possible. He felt like a human-sized puppet, but at this point he had grown used to the constant physical contact from his teacher. He didn’t even flinch anymore when the other man would touch him without warning. In fact, he had begun to find some comfort in his touch. His mind began to wander as he enjoyed the relaxing sensation of being manhandled; his worries seeping away from him for a brief moment. Ever so slightly, he leant his head backwards so that it was close to resting against Sherlock’s chest. “Good. Much better.” The other man murmured into his ear, “Whatever it is you’re thinking about, keep thinking about it.”
, averting his gaze, John blushed. The colour in his cheeks grew when he noticed the riding crop tucked neatly down the inside of his flatmate's long black leather riding boots. He opened his mouth, but quickly shut it. Sherlock however had been observing John's reaction closely.
when I see one.” He broke his gaze to throw a charming smile at Irene to which she happily returned the same look. John squirmed at their intimate interactions. As soon as Irene had delicately slid her hand off of the blonde’s shoulder, Sherlock had placed a firm grip on the opposite. “Well we best be heading back then. My apprentice has a rather busy schedule ahead of them tomorrow.” He gave the man in question a quick squeeze, but John didn’t know what it meant. Before he could follow that thought any further, the dark haired man had removed his hand to turn to bow to Irene. “Thank you so much for having us.”
into the garden. Scrambling away on his hands and feet, John pushed himself as far away as he could from the room, ignoring the scratches of the wooden porch against the palms of his hands. Breathing erratically, he pushed himself up onto his feet as he stumbled out into the centre of the garden, the adrenaline forcing him to forget about his injuries. Uneasily he watched the room from afar, waiting in suspense for his attacker to emerge. Out here, he had the light of the moon to illuminate his surroundings in a dull grey blue hue.
fluttered in the wind, but John didn’t pay it any mind. He was lost in the dim sparkling lights of the city below, listening to the gentle hum of its people in the early hours of the morning. It was still dark enough for the moon to be out in full force. John glanced up to admire its beauty, revelling in how brightly it shone in the star-filled sky. He stared in wonder and slowly closed his eyes, taking comfort in the feeling of his problems being momentarily washed away. He forgot about the House, about Molly, Mother, this random visitor, his chores, his past, his sister Harr-
His teacher gently shushed him, but kept his eyes focused on the lower half of the blonde's body. Then he reached for John's undergarments and the shivering man shivered harder when he felt Sherlock's hands yank them off. Now he was totally bare.
and made for the door. “Outside. Ten minutes. Chop chop.” And with that, he slid out of the room and disappeared down the hallway.
Mycroft chuckled, “Brother, there are matters to discuss of the upmost importance so please don’t keep me waiting any longer.” His brother hummed his acknowledgement as he began to carefully remove his facial hair. Satisfied with his response, Mycroft placed a firm hand on John’s shoulder, causing the servant to snap his head round in surprise. “And you”, he cooed, “Come with me”.
"P-pervert!" Sherlock snapped his head round to meet John's eyes. The blonde would've leapt from the piercing stare he had received, were it not for the drug that was still coursing through his veins.
Mycroft rose an eyebrow, “I see…”.  He snapped out of his stiff stance, his face lacking its previous intensity. “Well hurry up and make yourself presentable, please. I should like for you to spare my eyes the pain of having to look at such a mess of a man.” The man in the tub merely scoffed. “And that god awful stubble…”
parasol, opening it with a twirl and placed it over his shoulder. Quirking an eyebrow at his brother, he continued, “You know I have a reputation to maintain.”
to the room was thrown open. He swallowed the surprised yelp that was threatening to escape his lips as he spun around. It was Mother.
“First time?” John gave Sherlock a quick sharp nod in response, squeezing his eyes shut. Sherlock hummed thoughtfully to himself as he continued to carefully press into the smaller man. John drew in a breath, terror and arousal coursing through him all the same. It took him by complete surprise when he felt a sudden wetness envelope the head of his cock. He cracked one of his eyes open and was met with the image of his flatmate having taken his cock into his mouth. At first, he was merely teased by his tongue lapping at his tender head, but it was enough to send a warm fuzzy light-headed feeling throughout his entire being. A low long moan was produced from deep within him as Sherlock gently sucked on his tip whilst simultaneously pushing his finger deeper inside. He wanted to writhe under his touch, but due to the position his body had been made to endure, he held himself as still as possible. All he could do was blush, whine and leak into Sherlock's mouth.
, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from Lestrade. He continued, "Neither of them will do. Really, brother, I had expected more from you." It was Mycroft's turn to take in a breath, clenching his teeth in frustration. Before anyone had time to comment, Sherlock turned his attention to the only servant in the room, "John, be a dear and pour me another cup?"
“C’mon, Sholto! We’re taking this party elsewhere.” His friends all drunkenly giggled as a couple of them began to playfully and half-heartedly wrestle each other. The others were cheering them on with glee.
John felt a sudden need to shove the other man out of the rickshaw. Instead he decided to take in a deep breath to slowly release through his nose. Clutching at his
“Yes, Si-,” Sherlock shot him a glare. “Ah, I mean, yes, Mr Holmes.” The words felt odd in John’s mouth. He squirmed under the other man’s gaze.
“Yes yes!” Sherlock flung his arms upwards in annoyance, causing some of the contents of the bath to spill over onto the floor. He stood up, climbed out and headed for the mirror. John lamented for the man’s apparent lack of decency, averting his eyes to stare at the ceiling. A blush spread across his face as he twiddled his thumbs behind his back, determined to distract himself. Unbeknown to him, Mycroft had been observing his behaviour the entire time.
John froze, his back still facing the other man. He tried not to clench his fists in annoyance as he turned round to face him.
"How should I know?" John had unwillingly blurted out his response, his face still red from the sight of his flatmate. "I'm not so sure I've ever even seen a leather daddy in the flesh before..."
, he would burn ideas into his brothers head, horrendous and spiteful crimes that he did in fact complete - he was charged with first degree murder four years ago however was released without jail sentence and nobody knows why or how, most likely used the same technique that
"I promise" John mumbled into her shoulder, lifting his head to kiss the top of her head "your Nan will be picking you up and you'll be going straight there, keep your phone on you, I'll call you and let you know everything"
"But Sherlock likes me, he won't mind if I come too. Plus, I don't want to go to Auntie Harry's, she's boring, she just complains about how hard her life is all the time"
"Craig Moriarty, he's thirty eight, lives in Kent, once working in Morgue, around dead bodies, no one would hire him, obviously, due to the fact he's a physcopath - only able to work alongside dead people, spends a lot of his time engaging in conversation with them - after his older Brother,
John found himself sitting in his assigned seat, his food on his lap, not bothering to sit at the dining table - mostly because Sherlock had been doing some sort of experiment involving pigs blood and testicals and he didn't fancy excess blood scattering over his Calzone.
"Sherlock, there's no other way. There's no time to stop and worry, that's not what you do - you focus, you deduce, you understand. I'm asking you to stop and think here, you need to solve this case, your names Sherlock Holmes, so do your bloody job"
The fond memories now a distant memory, it felt. John would close his eyes, remembering tiny details of conversations, bitter filled arguments and petty discussions. Just hoping that he could remember enough so that it would feel as real as it once was. But no matter how he tried, no matter the time he spent, it felt as though it was impossible - it wasn't going to work, nothing would.
"Are you still that oblivious? Even to yourself? Everyone knew you two were in love with one another, John. Everyone. But you were both too bloody stubborn to do anything about it"
"I did, sweetheart" Mrs Hudson nodded, pulling back slightly with her hands still on Rosie's shoulders "I remember when you were born, John and Sherlock had just got back from a case and your mum had rang John 54 bloody times. I think she scarred Sherlock for life"
She sat down on one of the stools, leaning against the counter as John head for the kettle, reaching to get two cups out of the cupboard.
"I see" He nodded, straightening his suit jacket as he let out a soft sigh "very well, then I shall let the appropriate people know that the Notorious Sherlock Holmes has taken his early retirement"
John woke from his nightmare with a jolt, his forehead damp with sweat. Blinking several times, he slowly began to register the dull ache throbbing away in his head. Groaning ruefully, he rolled over onto his stomach to press his face into the plump pillow underneath him. Forgetting whose bed he was in, he took in a generous gulp of air as he buried his nose into the soft material, unintentionally breathing in the now overpowering smell of Sherlock. The scent a shiver down his spine and a twitch to his dick. John frowned into the pillow, pulling up his hands to grasp at it in a death grip. He had begun to chew at his bottom lip in confused contemplation at his body’s reaction when he heard a faint, but distinct whispering coming from the porch. Then the smell of tobacco hit him.
John nodded, taking Sherlock's hand and leading him over to the sofa. He pulled Sherlock in front of him, nodding down at the sofa, his cue to lie down. Sherlock released his hand, kicking his shoes off and adjusted himself to lie down, his back against the back of the sofa, leaving room for John to slot in, in front of him - which he did, John lay with his back to Sherlock's chest, shuffling until they completely touching, soon Sherlock's arm awkwardly made its way around John's waist, the other sliding underneath his head so John could rest against it.
“May I?” He indicated to where John was sitting. Despite his confusion, the smaller of the two nodded, breaking his gaze to focus on the horizon again. Sherlock cautiously made his way over to the blonde haired man, careful to balance himself so as not to fall off the roof. He sat himself beside him, staring with burning intensity. A bead of sweat escaped from John’s brow: he disliked the unwanted examination. He could almost feel Sherlock’s breath when he spoke. “You have questions.”
The blonde cracked his dry eyes open, blinking in confusion. Vaguely noticing the line of drool hanging off of his chin, he tried to remember the exact moment he had fallen asleep.
“Too long.” The warm smile on the taller man’s face looked genuine. John frowned when he caught sight of it, shuffling uncomfortably at the intimacy that was taking place in front of him. It was as if the woman had detected his awkwardness, her sharp eyes darting from Sherlock’s to focus on the smaller man instead. John blushed.
“It was me, Sir. I stopped to take a nap. Molly here was just trying to wake me up, is all. I apologise for my insolence.” And with that, John threw a quick sharp bow to Lestrade. He squinted at the two of them before letting out another sigh.
as delicately as he could, she began talking at him again. “Did you see the state of him? What a mess! I can’t believe we’re harbouring vagabond. Surely he can’t be related to Mother? Not by blood, at least. Who do you think he is? He’s rather terrifying, isn’t he? I wonde-“. She was cut off from her ramble by the sound of the
The ride home was an awkward one. Sherlock had repeatedly insisted on inspecting John’s wound despite his constant protests. Eventually he gave up on trying to bat the other man away and resigned to allowing himself to be prodded. Worrying his bottom lip in annoyance, John looked away into the passing crowd before he felt a sharp pain to which he snapped his head back round. “Ow! What the hell are yo-“
Her eyes widened slightly before she instantly sat up and made her way over to the space beside him, both her and Sherlock were shocked by the gesture - he didn't know he had it in him.
"Yes, because whether you like it or not, I am in fact the one person in this world that you cannot live wit-" he was halted as his phone began to ring in his pocket and he really could have thrown it out the window at that point. "One second"
"- he argued with them until he was black and blue. I didn't understand it, still don't, but one day mum was sobbing and dad was... he was just a mess and I asked why and that's when I found out that he had killed somebody, not purposely apparently, he had attempted some sort of game with them and eventually they took their own life to get away from him. Nobody could find him, he fled the house and we didn't see him for years, that was until you came around, Mr Holmes, it was like you were his target - he was so fascinated by you. He came home, finally, after all that time and instead of being happy to see us, he spoke only of you, about everything you had done. Mum knew it wasn't good, she rang the police but he was gone again before we could do anything and the next time we saw him was when he was in the paper for 'stealing the crown jewels' and everything after that was about you"
"What? That you wanted me to kiss you?" John questioned with an eyebrow raised. "That's why you wanted to come home?"
"Really? Shit - that's, well that's just a strange obsession, isn't it?" Lestrade asked, as he walked alongside Holmes and Watson towards St Barts.
"I don't think you understand. You underestimate the way Sherlock felt for you, as ever, you both had a habit of that, you were never able to express how you truly felt. You know, we took bets the day before the wedding, myself, Molly and Lestrade all bet that Sherlock would tell you on the day. In fact, I still think if that bloody soldier hadn't have been stabbed, he still would have"
"Right" She nodded, not believing it for a even a second. "You know, you don't have to act any different around me. I'm not fussed"
"I think now is better, yes, definitely. It will... Stimulate my brain" Sherlock attempted an explanation.
John and Sherlock pushed past the others in the room and head towards the conservatory where they had spotted Molly, John was first to grab her and pull her into a hug, Sherlock copying his actions.
"Yeah, at night sometimes. I just like to read about it all, I read them a lot when dad got me my first laptop when I was 10, I searched his name randomly and it was the first thing that came up - I never told him. Didn't want him to think I was snooping" She admitted, sighing before continuing "- he just never tells me anything, you know? It's like before you came back he wanted to keep all of that in the past, he doesn't even mention my mum, like at all"
He sniffled, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand as he heard the stairs creak, he wanted it to be Sherlock, he always did, but from the sound of tea wear clattering, he knew that it was Mrs Hudson, right on cue to offer him some tea and some company.
"So you already feel more than he ever could, much more, you have a heart, don't you?" John asked in a faint whisper, reaching an arm out "do you want to lose the one thing that makes you human? Do you want to lose everything you've achieved?"
"You're just going to sit there? This sort of thing only happens once in a lifetime Sherlock, the offer still stands" John pushed, he hated it when John acted with dominance it made him feel so small, yet, deep down, he loved it.
It was dim, the room felt empty, the once colourful array of colours that would light the room in such a way it would be described as lustful, now seeming nothing more than the patterns of - once was.
Sherlock was dressed in a fitting suit, his lanyard around his neck and coffee in his hand. His curls now styled upwards, less adorable looking and more gorgeous. He was flicking through the paper with his free hand, every now and again glancing up to John.
However, Sherlock didn't care, he sat there, eating his Linguine with one hand as his other worked on the test tubes he had lined up.
"Oh, brother mine, please do stop acting so bloody childish and reevaluate this situation. Surely you don't think this is a good idea? No person with a right mind would find this idea even remotely worth the effort or time"
"You're welcome" John chuckled, attempting not to roll his eyes "- Awful, it really is. This is my family Living room, not really the place for Blow Jobs and cum on the rug, is it?"
John soon realised, speaking in short breaths "this was your plan, wasn't it? When you asked to cuddle?"
John nodded, walking over to his own seat, he sat, slightly on the edge so he was a little closer to him. He was still nodding, like a lunatic actually, a strange way to prepare himself for this.
"Shut up Sherlock" John said, softer than before. Placing a kiss on his chest "I have already waited years to do just this, I can wait a little longer, I assure you"
"Sherlock" John groaned, it was supposed to come as a plead, a plead for anything, he just needed something from him.
"Then I can't seem to understand why she would punish you for it, it's unlikely it would cause any harm to the other student"
"Are you both upstairs?" John's voice was clear, his footsteps heard after, one step after the other and she knew he would walk into this scene eventually.
"It's over, Rosie. There's no interesting story to this case, nothing at all, there's nothing to be jealous of - we were at St Barts yesterday evening, he came, we spoke, he's free and then we came home early hours of the morning and went to bed. That's it"
Rosie was about to walk away when Sherlock called after her "Don't spend ages on the phone or you'll waste all your minutes before the end of the month"
"Well, you all did, at one point" and John knew that was a dig, he was expecting it. He knew he couldn't pop round for lunch and not get some sort of telling off from his adoptive mother.
He sat back in his chair, looking up at the door as the handle budged. He rubbed his eyes with his hands as it opened, turning his back to the computer to collect their notes.
"Okay" John breathed, leaning back again. Looking up at Sherlock, he then reached his free hand down, grasping both of their cocks in his smaller hand, Sherlock gasped looking down at John's hand as he began to work them watching as his hand moved smoothly and in rhythm, working them at the same time.
He peered at the clock against the wall, one hour, fifty two minutes and thirty six seconds, thirty five, thirty four, thirty three - he felt his chest tighten, his lungs expanding double size.
Sherlock was extremely conflicted, which was something he wasn't used to - he didn't quite know how to act around his goddaughter, he didn't know if it was okay to sit too close to John or whether he was allowed to act affectionate at all, even if he didn't know how to, he'd at least like to try. But he didn't know what was and wasn't acceptable.
"I knew you were a softie" Greg laughed loudly, reaching up to ruffle Sherlock's unruly locks "C'mon lads, everyone's in the kitchen"
John frowned, his eyes concerned. "What's the matter? Oh god, please don't say you're about to change your mind Sherlock"
"This time last month, it was you in this situation. It was you who was confused, hurt and bewildered by your own emotions" John began, remembering the key details of Sherlock's face the moment he had admitted it all to him "you know how much that hurt, that's why I'm beginning to wonder why on earth you would leave it at that and allow me to struggle with the knowledge of your feelings for this entire month and you doing nothing about it"
"You're wrong. So, so, wrong" He shook his head, slamming his hand against the desk "he is no one, he's always been a nobody - nobody could love him, nobody could even care for him can't you see that? If I kill him, not a single person would mourn him - he deserves to die, my brother died so he could end Sherlock Holmes life and in return, his must be taken"
"I - yes, yes I'm fine. Why do you ask?" He managed to choke out, inching up in his seat so he was sitting up right.
"Well, Doctor Watson, it would happen that Jim wasn't the only Moriarty, in fact, not the only psychopath born to that family. His brother, Craig, is someone I've had a deal of run-in's with. An extremely evil individual, much like our beloved villain."
"Then we'll leave" Sherlock spoke firmly, his grip still tight on John's hand "- John, Rosie and I will leave until you have fixed this"
"Sherlock, for the love of god, for once in your fucking life, shut the fuck up" John growled "I haven't got a wedding to go back to, don't you understand that? You think if I had just got married I would run over here just to say sorry? Of course I fucking wouldn't"
"Mhm, keys, phone, wallet, I'm set" Sherlock nodded, gulping the reminder of his coffee. "I'll be home for lunch today"
"I mean, you can still surprise me but yes, you don't have to prove anything else. I know how hard it is for you to show affection" John spoke, biting his lip as he leaned back slightly, his arms still wrapped around his neck.
"A Thirty something man, suspected of murdering several professionals around London all of which work for Banks, NatWest to be more precise. Very exciting"
John was asleep on the ice cold floor of the third floor of St Barts, Sherlock's jacket wrapped around him to his neck, so peacefully and yet so uncomfortable - he didn't want to sleep but of course, Sherlock had forced him into doing so.
Sherlock's eyes furrowed slowly, almost into a glare until he lifted his laptop screen up and focused - his fingers typing away and his eyes fierce - the game was on.
"No, but I know you two. And I know what you can become, you're Sherlock Holmes and John Watson and the game really is on. Go down there, apologise for storming out like a prick and tell him what you want. After all this time you finally know how he feels, John. Don't spend another lifetime waiting for something to happen"
"Well, that's because he's dead" He spoke firmly, leaning against the desk. "Killed himself, you saw it didn't you? Bullet, right through his brain. Easy way to go, I expected more from him - he always spoke about wanting to feel death and yet he did it the easy way"
John stared in wonder, listening to Sherlock say the words sorry over and over again were like a sympathy to his ears "-and I can assure you, John Watson, I hadn't stopped thinking about you since the day I left"
"Yes, actually, you did. I made sure to tell you all that I wanted nothing to do with the police or any cases, so why you have chosen to turn up here is beyond me" Sherlock snapped, using his fingers to comb his hair back into place. "Are you all really that incompetent?"
"Oh yes! Molly pops round every now and then, you'll love her too. Very good friends with your dad here"
"Jesus, dad, do you not watch the news? You and Sherlock are all over! I was checking Twitter at lunch and there's thousands of photos of the two of you"
He looked at the younger man, a sort of look of spite towards him. How dare he do this to him, how dare he play with his emotions and his life as though he was simply the puppet to his extravagant show of a life.
"Uhm" He opens his lips and closes them, his eyes furrowing together as he thought, it took seconds as Sherlock stared at him intensely and then, it clicked "-Shit"
"None of this is necessary John, please, you should go back to your wedding - you don't... you don't need to explain this to me"
"I'm not the man your brother once knew, in fact, I am nothing of the kind. I'm older now, I am settled, I am in fact very boring"
"So you're having a date?" She asked, looking up at him and tilting her head slightly, her blonde locks falling to the side.
The reply was immediate, something John had never forgotten was Sherlock's ability to text back almost instantly. Usually because his phone never left his hands.
"Are you still here?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, looking to his brother with a look of utter plead to leave "why are you here? Do you not have a country to run or something?"
"Bloody days?" Rosie spat her cereal from her mouth, both noticed how it fell onto Sherlock's arm and John was physically frozen, unsure how he would react, being wary was necessary when he was in detective mode.
"It's fine honey, just get your shoes on - something has happened, I'm sorry, you're going to have to go to your Aunts tonight" John attempted to explain, attempting a smile.
Since turning fourteen, it seemed her attitude had only worsened, she was at the most pivotal time of her youth and everything to her was an effort.
"Jesus, have you cleaned in here?" John asked, turning to look at Sherlock who was stood awkwardly in the middle of the room.
She nodded, surprisingly taking this better than either had expected. She placed her backpack on her shoulder, she walked around the counter until she reached Sherlock - who naturally, turned around, pulling her into a tight hug and copying John's actions by placing a kiss onto her forehead.
"Not the time John" Sherlock shook his head with a fond smile, they both instantly hid their smiles as they heard the footsteps along the corridor towards them.
"I suppose that was because I believed it to be true. John, you have to understand something" Sherlock began, standing to his feet now only a mere few inches from John "- I was a stupid, ignorant and pathetic man. I once believed no one had any right to be around me because I was too brilliant. It was you who brought me to life"
"Wow" John managed to choke out, a smile of disbelief spreading across his lips as his eyes flickered between the scene in front of him and Sherlock.
"Well, I didn't actually go to him, Mrs Hudson insisted I needed help contacting you and as you were ignoring her calls, she said you would answer him, as you always did"
Sherlock's hand followed lower, his finger tips practically grazing the waistband of his jeans. He was unaware if Sherlock knew what he was doing, knowing him, it was innocent, so unaware of how these sought of actions could affect people... Affect John.
"Probably. However, she's not showing it too much, in fact she encouraged me to leave that day" John admitted, stepping under the police line as he attempted to follow Sherlock.
"Good Evening" Sherlock smiled politely, placing his cup down "May I ask what size bin it was that you threw?"
Sherlock closed his laptop, his eyes gazing between the two before stopping at Rosie "I promise you, I will not let any harm come to your father. You'll see him without even a hair missing from his head"
She looked like she was ready to lose her mind at any moment, not to mention the amount of makeup she was wearing, if John had the balls, he would most definitely have told her to wipe it off but he didn't have the balls of the time.
John moved until he was hovering over him, his hands either side of his head, his face only a few inches from Sherlock's and if Sherlock thought he was having breathing problems before, he certainly was now.
"Good, okay" John smiled softly, his eyes flickering down at his twiddling fingers for a slightly second as his cheeks grew a shade of crimson red "nice to know"
"Please, Sherlock" John spoke softly, his eyes piercing onto him "Talk to me, tell me what's going on. I can't help unless you tell me"
"That wasn't the right time or place. I wasn't who I am now, I was a blind idiot with no human emotion or care in my bones, I was beyond the point of rescuing before you met me - it took you a very long time to help me, John"
"Isn't this lovely, all of us together again. I'm glad I didn't die, wouldn't have wanted to miss this" Mrs Hudson delightfully spoke, leaning her head in her hands as she looked at the pair.
John turned, watching as Sherlock paced back and forth with excitement, his navy shirt open as his long fingers attempted the buttons.
"who would have thought there was a heart in that sociopathic body of yours?" John asked, a light chuckle escaping his laugh, mainly from nerves.
"Remember, this was your idea" John whispered as he and Sherlock walked towards the room with the most noise.
"Shut up Sherlock, please" John rolled his eyes, one hand reaching up to lean on the door frame, the other pinching at his nose. "Look, I have just ran all the way from the station - no fucking taxi would pick me up, I'm exhausted"
John looked between the both of them, hoping that at least one of them would say something, anything in fact. He could even be happy with Sherlock making a sarcastic comment about how she's already taller than him. But, what happened next wasn't what he was expecting.
The door swung open and he was met with Mrs Hudson who was covered with a big smile as she caught eyes with Rosie who was standing just behind John, looking up at the hat sat on the rack collecting dust.
"Are you going to leave me hanging? You can't send me away to catch a bad guy and not tell me all the gory details" She urged.
"I just know that it's okay to love whomever you please no matter the gender and I want you to know that I'm okay with whoever you chose. As long as you love them, then that makes me happy. You do deserve happiness too, dad and I'm sorry. I want you to enjoy yourself"
"I'm sure they'd love to hear about the heartless detective who fled from London to save the heart of his best friend" John joked lightly.
"Yes, well, I feel the same" Mrs Hudson laughed, her care-free, infectious laughed, that John would have missed so dearly. "Oh well, life goes on and all that tosh. Mycroft told me that you two have finally made this official, it's wonderful, who would have thought? You were so persistent that you weren't interested in Sherlock, John, I saw right through you"
"Good Afternoon, bare with me a minute I'm just getting your notes up so I can see how I can help you today" He said, absentmindedly waving towards the chair for them to sit.
"Yes but, she came with me that day. That bullet was made for me, not her, I can never forgive myself for that"
"I suppose she just wanted to speak to someone who wasn't her father?" Sherlock suggested, shrugging his shoulders as he turned his body slightly to look at John.
"I give it six months. You'll get bored of it, you always do. You used to get bored after a few hours without a case, you'll never last"
"They can try all they like to provoke me, but I stand by what I said. I'm done" Sherlock stated calmly, taking back his seat. "So if you would all kindly go away, that would be most appreciated"
"Has someone hurt you?" John assumed, his eyes furrowing slightly at the thought of anyone hurting his Sherlock.
"You needed to heal, you needed to grieve the loss of your wife, deal with everything. Mycroft told me that human emotions are difficult and if I really wanted to save you, then the best option would be for me to leave you. Allow you to grieve through the pain that I, caused"
"Come on dear, you need to speak to me" Mrs Hudson spoke firmly this time, now lowering herself to sit beside him on the sofa. Sherlock hadn't even noticed, he didn't consider what he must look like - a incoherent mess, shaking back and forth on the sofa like a mad man.
"We're all very aware that you don't like him" John laughed, pushing himself off the wall "Okay, let's not keep Sherlock waiting. He'll end up shooting your poor wall again"
"Nothing?" John leaned forward, examine Sherlock's answer as though it was foreign to him "why on earth would you do that?"
"Regardless, I am infiltrating a gay club in Soho tonight. Lestrade says my target should be there also. I doubt I'll have any difficulty in persuading him into giving me the information I require". He straightened out his sleeves as he spoke.
A dangerous look descended upon the shorter man’s face. He felt compelled to throttle the other man, but settled for clenching his bandaged hand a little too hard, the pain distracting him from his rage. However his anger was soon replaced with fear upon hearing Sherlock’s next words.
, his thoughts trailed off as he tossed his newspaper aside, crossing the room to the desk to throw open his laptop. Stuck to the screen was a bright yellow post-it note with his flatmate's handwriting scrawled across it. John cursed under his breath at Sherlock's blatant disregard for his property. Plucking the post-it off the screen, he wished the detective would stop using his things, but his thoughts froze as he began to read the note Sherlock had left him:
.” The blonde gulped when Sherlock near spat the last word. The taller man continued, “If I am to train you then I need to know what I’m working with.” He casually waved a hand at John’s torso, to which the blonde squinted at him. Surprisingly, Sherlock looked more uncomfortable than him, particularly when he noticed a rosy pink blush begin to bloom on the taller man’s face.
John pondered for a moment, as if gathering all the information that had just been hurled at him. "So what happens when I've got him distracted?"
Screwing his eyes shut, he balled his fists as the many women around him continued to swirl in a fast-paced flurry, their onslaught of never-ending poking and prodding raging on. John could feel something deep within him bubbling inside, growing more and more out of control. Any moment now he was about to burst when suddenly a sharp twang of a
“We’re not supposed to leave the House at night, remember? What if you get caught snooping around? Think how awful it would be if someone found you. Or worse still, if Mother found you! You’d be beaten within an inch of your life!” She rambled on with a great sense of urgency to her whispers, her eyes darting about the room as if expecting someone to leap at them from the shadows. John rolled his eyes, but smiled. Despite his preference for solitude, he did appreciate Molly’s concern. He gently placed a hand over her clenched fist, attempting to placate her into letting go of his
perched over his shoulder. As per usual, Sherlock was ten steps ahead, too impatient to slow his pace down to meet that of his apprentice. John would’ve requested to hold onto the other man’s arm like last time, but the events of that morning made it difficult for him to even look at the dark haired man. He resigned to continue on in his struggle instead.
John wandered about the House aimlessly, the events of that morning playing over and over in his head. Upon hearing Sherlock’s suggestion that he become an apprentice
The two puffed from the sudden exertion. "Not bad", the taller man returned the other man's smirk, "I do prefer you splayed naked for me though."
coming down to pierce the soft material of the still warm pillow. John panted from the sudden exertion, darting his eyes about in panic, trying his level best to adjust his sight to the darkness, but before he was given the chance to do so, he caught the distinct sound of the pitter patter of feet coming for him fast. Blindly, he leapt in what he hoped would be away from his attacker. This was followed by several swishes of a blade cutting through the night. The apprentice wanted to rid himself of the terror that coursed through him, frustrated by the lack of vision. Suddenly he felt something sharp press against his upper thigh, which was quickly followed by a nasty stinging sensation and the hot expulsion of blood. The shock of being cut caused the blonde to stumble backwards, tearing through the
