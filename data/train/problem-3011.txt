Dean drove well above the speed limit as the sun sank below the horizon. Sam found his phone in his back pocket. It was a nearly 40 year old model. He nearly gave the voice command to unlock it and then remembered that he had to use a pin number. He couldn’t remember the pin exactly but the phone opened on the first try, which Sam was certain was wrong since it was Dean Jr’s birthday he had entered. The phone opened and Sam brought up the GPS app.
“No.” Dean blinked his wet eyes, dispelling a memory that would never be made. Sam was still seeing Eileen, but she refused to come anywhere near the bunker or Dean. Jack and Castiel were gone, and he knew deep down, for good this time.
The t-rex juked to the side with a roar to dodge the glass grenade of holy water Dean flung. Dean took the opening to go to his brother. Sam was grey.
Jowl’s hefty hands wrapped around his fountain pen which he tapped impatiently.  “And the other order of business?”
It was well past noon when Sam joined Dean at the library table. Sam cast a quick glance to Dean’s computer. He wasn’t on the scanner program or his usual porn sites. He was just mindlessly browsing clickbait articles presented by the search engine’s algorithm and his shared location. It was messy for him to not be browsing incognito. Sam sat down across from him,
Without warning, Sam had the lapels of Dean’s jacket balled into his fists, “You said I was sad. Sad Sammie you said. Yes, I was sad. I missed Jack, I missed Cas. But you, you were down right suicidal and tonight was it. You died like a punk. Everything we ever fought for, wasted because you couldn’t deal. Do you know what happens to suicide souls?”
Naomi looked at the janitors pretending to not notice the exchange. She rolled her eyes then pointed to the sticky aura of pain that had spilled out from Dean’s door. The pristine white, quartz floor under it turned necrotic and sizzled. “Clean this up.”
Castiel came back up Dean’s body with the same kisses that led him downward. “I have been wanting to do that to you for so long.”
Thunder shook the barn. Lightning split the sky and defined every warped gap between the slats of the walls. Rain fell in large, crude oil drops that evaporated from the ground into a fog as thick and acrid as the smoke from a burning tire. The night had started high and clear with a full moon, but out of nowhere the weather had turned sinister. The two young boys Sam and Dean had come to rescue were looking from the maelstrom outside to the desperate fight between the monsters and their would-be heroes. Somehow, the howling wind blustered backwards, sucking the inward swinging doors to slam shut. The wood-splitting bang and the children’s frightened cries turned Dean’s attention momentarily.
The ground rumbled. Sam backed up from the shoulder of the road away from the tree line. Rowena flitted into the opposite tree line. “See you later, your majesty.”
The dominating bulk kicked in Dean’s ribs. “You think you can just hunt us down with a couple of pig stickers and a pair of balls! Bullshit!”
“Ah, I was wondering where you acquired your taste for the better things in life.” Dean waggled his eyebrows.
“Dean?” Sam blinked rapidly until his vision cleared. It hadn’t been clear in years. The air was sweet and easy to breathe. The rattle in his chest and the ache in his bones were gone. The steady beeping of medical machines were replaced by birds chirping. He could see clearly without the fog of cataracts. Before him stood his older brother
The highway was just two lanes with a half shoulder on each side and bordered by thick grass that went into the tree lines on each side. The pavement was level with no rumble strips at the edges and no litter anywhere. Sam strolled with his hands resting in his front jacket pockets. He made a mental note to set his alarm for tomorrow morning and try to obstruct his bedroom door’s lock so he could get out at dawn for a jog.
A young man with dark hair and warm hazel eyes sat on the edge of the bed, “You can come in Castiel. He is asleep.”
Castiel had just enough time to raise his head halfway up the mast so that the rush spilled over his tongue and didn’t choke him going straight down the back of his throat. It was a mouth full tasting of Dean’s essence and the ocean. Castiel let Dean’s body down easily from the shuddering orgasm, slipping his finger out and cleaning up every last trace of it with his mouth.
By the time Dean and Miracle made it to the galley, Sam was already back from his morning jog and had breakfast ready. All his favorites with a healthier slant were on the plate; whole grain bread instead of white toast, egg whites only, fresh fruit instead of jam, and turkey bacon. Food recently had lost its flavor to Dean so he really didn’t mind the changes, except for turkey bacon. It was neither turkey nor bacon, a hell spawn blasphemy of Chuck’s only true gift to the world and not even fit for Miracle to consume.
“Knock it off, it's fully stocked.” Dean pulled out a plate with rolled food stacked up like Lincoln logs.
“Okay, good.” Sam threw a poignant glare at Castiel who entered behind Dean and gestured at the refrigerator and pantry “There’s no food and no coffee.”
With one deep breath in and a hard sigh out, Dean robotically settled back against the angel in his bed and forced himself, “So, what shall we do today?”
“You done?” Dean stepped around to the front of his glossy black 1967 Impala in pristine condition while adjusting the waistband of his jeans. He pulled out a bottle of sanitizer from his pocket and offered it to Sam.
Dean stopped him and smelled the angel’s hair and eyed his crotch. He smelled spring fresh and was perfectly unsullied. “Cas, you don’t need a shower. Let me have a moment.”
A fresh bed piled with feather pillows, covered in a cloud like duvet and holding a smiling angel welcomed Dean when he came back in. Castiel flipped the right corner of the sheets back and invited Dean to slip in. A smile normally reserved for pie spread across Dean’s face. The bath towel around his waist was dropped and Dean fully accepted. The angel held up the sheets for him to slip in and Dean turned off the light. Outside the day faded into night and the moon glowed over the woods without the fretful flight of nightmares for the first time in a very, very, very long time.
Naomi expanded her radiant influence and from the blinding light her voice was even toned. “One. Two. Three.”
“Dean?” Castiel said softly from the front room of the house. It felt weird using the name on someone else. He stood so that the figure in the hospital bed set up in the den couldn’t turn his head to see.
“Castiel.” Naomi, once the fierce corrective psychologist of heaven, knocked respectfully on the glass door to the gleaming office that was once hers. “It is happening again.”
Castiel moved in and out while adding drops of lubricant right before each reentry. The second finger startled Dean. Castiel glided it in slowly and rested with both digits down to the webbing of his palm. Dean’s body soon relaxed around them and Castiel started to pump them in and out again adding lube. The third finger made Dean’s breath catch. Castiel let Dean take control on the third finger.
Before the jowls could waggle again, the elevator at the end of the conference room dinged. The rusted doors squealed in their tracks. The fluorescent lights inside the car flickered spastically. All eight pairs of jet black eyes turned in unison. Out stepped Mr. Zack Smith with his trademark smirk pulling at one side of his smug mouth and his own eyes a fiery red.
The forest fell abruptly silent. Sam’s honed ears noticed immediately. Rowena’s cardinal’s head cocked to one side then the other. “Sam, something is terribly wrong.”
Castiel placed his hand on Dean Jr.’s forearm. “His own power has corrupted him. This is for the best. I promise you that he will be taken care of.”
Dean’s hand fumbled for the off button on the antique brass alarm clock and he sat up stiffly from another night of hard, alcohol induced sleep.
Dean cleared his throat. His time as a demon with the king of hell was eye opening, liberating, and exhilarating. When his humanity was restored and he had to step back into his life as a hunter, donning the mantle of responsibility and bravado again felt like a straight jacket. Crowley had promised that their summer of fun would always be their little secret. Dean had been grateful to Cowley for keeping that secret.  But now, here, in heaven, Dean didn’t feel like he had to keep up with the version of himself he had been maintaining in life. He turned to face Castiel, but then his words failed him “Well, you know…”
“Sam!” The impala screeched to a stop. Black clouds rolled in and lightning split the sky. The wind carried the smell of sick, sweet death. The dinosaur leveled its yellow eyes on Sam and then back to Dean then considered the sky.
“No.” Sam said coldly. If he was going to be forced to relive this awful night, it was going to play out much differently.
They approached the front barn doors and kicked them wide open. The children were quickly found in a feed closet and released. Dean was surprised when they turned and five vampires dressed in black with grinning skull faces barred their way to the exit.
“I know.” Castiel stood with his hands in his pockets. He didn’t bother to bless away the filth clinging to him. His subordinate crossed her arms. She was being particularly grating.
“Great!” Dean jumped out of bed and grabbed a t-shirt and lounge pants from the dresser. When he turned back around Castiel was up and assembled, clothes pressed sharply and him smelling fresh.
Dean Jr. acknowledged the complement, but didn’t take it to heart. His namesake uncle, dead before his time, had written glowing passages about the angel in his journal and put him on some kind of awkward pedestal. The angel just scared Dean Jr. He seemed a lot like his own father where the ends justify the means and morality was only applicable when convenient.
Castiel took in a deep breath. Though they were underground he could taste the dawn outside. Dawn had never broken over Dean’s heaven, but this one broke with a glorious light, burning away the bitter miasma that had tainted this small portion of heaven. “And I thought I would never see you, this you, again.”
Castiel watched Sam head off toward the executive bunk rooms and didn’t turn back to Dean until he heard Sam’s door shut. The lock on the door clicked loud enough to be heard in the situation room. When Castiel turned back to Dean, who stood just outside of arm’s length from the angel with a confused and worried look on his face. “I thought I would never see you again.”
“Ladies and gentlemen!” Zack entered the room with swagger. He looked too young to have sway in a boardroom, but everyone there respectfully acknowledged him. The young woman at the head of the room pulled out the chair. Zack thanked her and took his seat.
He scooted up to the table, rested his forearms on the table’s edge and interlaced his fingers. “I have some excellent news.”
Castiel continued his explanation, “I have all the terrible powers Michael and Lucifer had to smite and destroy. I have all the amazing powers to heal and build like they did too. Lucifer at one time could and did bring light and joy to the world. And like Gabriel, I can experience the world like humans do. I think that is the best perk. Though, I wasn’t expecting you to accept me so, um, much.”
“Shit, this guy isn’t even paying attention.” The bulk kicked dirt over Dean. “Kill’em and make it hurt!”
Sam smiled. “You know, this being technically alive thing might actually come in handy in my new role.”
Dean interrupted. “I am so sorry! I was just driving and thinking that if this is heaven then I could change it to more than just what I can remember. So I was thinking about Jurassic park…”
Memories of their last moments together, of Jack walking away, of his own death clawed at his heart. He was weak and he was stupid. He remembered his last job with his brother; how he had purposely gone into the fight not intending to come away from it and to not die alone. His grief had clouded his judgement. Castiel put a soft palm on Dean’s cheek. The memories of his hellish nightmare loop washed over him and the many, many times Castiel had been before him only to be wrenched away. Dean’s breath caught in his throat.
“Who in the hell do you think you are? John Wayne? John Wick?” The largest of the vampires dressed in black leather biker jackets and cheap Halloween skull hoods stood over Dean.
Sam entered the galley and flicked on the light. It was clean and everything was in order the way he had liked to keep it. He picked up the carafe from the coffee maker and filled it with water. Then he reached for the canister of ground coffee. It was empty. Sam tilted it toward the light and there wasn’t even the dust of grounds in the bottom. He put the canister down and opened the lower cabinets to refill the canister from the pantry stock. The cabinet looked fully stocked, but every box, can and bag of staple goods was empty or oddly a solid object like set props. Maybe Dean thought that breakfast kind of made itself every morning. It would make sense because usually when Dean cooked, he made a big production of buying the ingredients and following the recipe exactly even if they had the ingredients already in the pantry. That’s how they had ended up with so many bottles of partially used spices. At least most of the extra spices could be used in simple witchcraft and extra table salt never went to waste.
“Sam.” Dean stood with his shoulders squared, feet apart and machete gripped tight. His brother’s name on his lips was a farewell more than an acknowledgement of readiness.
Sam stopped in front of Dean’s bedroom door. He could hear the murmurs of conversation inside. It sounded peaceful and domestic like the conversations he and his wife Aileen would have on a lazy Sunday morning. The rage simmered down a bit and a soft smile played across his lips. He silently wished Dean a very good morning and went to the galley to wait for Castiel with a cup of coffee.
In the top draw of the night stand, Sam had a bundle of love notes that Aileen had hid in his duffle every time he ended a weekend with her to return to the bunker to be with Dean after Castiel was taken and Jack left. They were there, but the writing was just scribbles or said silly vague things like
Dean ushered the children out and into the backseat of the car. He met Sam at the trunk where he was just tossing his gun back into the trunk instead of putting it back in its place. “Did you have to do that in front of the kids?”
Castiel poured a steaming cup of coffee from the empty carafe behind Dean’s back while grinning at Sam. Sam’s head ticked to one side and then the other in a nearly imperceptible movement.
Dean balked, but obeyed. He slowly got up and turned himself over so that he was on his hands and knees on the mattress. Castiel left the bed to get the bottle from the bedside table. Dean watched him closely.
Dean stood. No situation was going to have control of him. He was taller than the angel and the perspective shift, and his memories of his time as a demon, gave him a jolt of lewd confidence. He brought his lips down upon Castiel’s, this time parting the angel’s mouth so that his tongue could explore. Castiel tasted like honey.
“Sam. Dean.” Castiel greeted them as they came down the iron staircase to the situation room. When Sam saw the angel, he knew this was not the dreamscape of a jin or any other reality bending fiend. This was heaven, Dean’s heaven. Castiel ignored Sam’s glare of daggers and took in Dean’s rigid form standing a few steps up behind Sam.
“When did you start caring about that? We’re Winchesters and this is what we do. Are you going to leave those kids to those monsters for another night?”
The severe looking woman with hawkish eyes sitting next to the man with the jowls tapped her long claws. They were painted to suggest artificial nails, but were not fooling anyone. She sniffed. “There is nowhere you need to be Gregory. All the channels to Earth are still closed tight. Queen Rowena has seen to that.”
The janitors fidgeted with their bucket and wet floor sign as if they were highly sensitive pieces of equipment.
Sam sat back down disgruntled. He poured the milk Dean pulled from the fridge and plunged his spoon in. He twisted his face not sure which was more saccharine sweet, Castiel and Dean’s domestic bliss or the Raisin Bran that tasted more like triple frosted flakes.  Dean was still stuffing his face, “I’m a house hubby!”
“Dean, when I count to three you are going to wake up. You will be at peace. You will know that Sam is alive and well. You will know that he married and has a wonderful son that he named after you. You will know that you are in heaven. You are safe. You will know that Castiel still exists in your world and that he loves you. Are you ready Dean?”
Then the pause button on reality was pressed. Dean eyes, frozen in the wide eyed stare of a man on the edge of death, beheld a glorious, pure light force the barn door wide open again.
“You and your tiny bladder are in the way of progress. We need to get to Canton before those vamp mimes strike again.”
“I’ve got something.” Dean didn’t look at Sam. Dean hadn’t really made eye contact with his brother since they won against God himself and he had lost Castiel and Jack.
Castiel pulled the cereal, Raisin Bran, from the cupboard and gave it to Sam with a bowl, spoon and carton of almond milk. Sam thanked him in front of Dean and made himself a bowl. Castiel didn’t answer the thanks. He stood still and listened to something Sam and Dean couldn’t hear. He sighed, “Duty calls.”
“Wait.” Dean came down the last steps and stopped equal distance between the angel and his brother who had already started for his bedroom.
“Castiel, I have done everything I can. He doesn’t belong here. If this keeps up, he is going to become a demon and we might as well just leave the gates wide open and install an escalator.”
In the corridor of Ward 2020, a couple of angels in janitorial jumpers waited with a yellow commercial mop bucket in front of Dean Winchester’s door, shining the soot like dust off the columns of brass date plaques marking the date of his death. Most of them were the same date on a Tuesday. The door suddenly opened and Castiel was vomited out into the corridor covered in black ooze. A moment later Naomi stepped out of the wall of black miasma framed by the door jamb as if she were walking in waist deep water.
Dean dallied at the table with his breakfast. Sam gave a pointed nod to the dishes and got up to do the chores Dean didn’t have a care to do. Reluctantly, Dean finished his meal and mechanically started to wash the cookware and plates. Miracle got to help take care of the egg bits stuck to the plate.
“Shhh Dean.” The angel turned and knelt by Dean on the floor. She took the mess of a man in her arms and let the light of heaven make him whole again. “Sam’s not here. He never was. Remember he is alive, you are in heaven? You’ve got to stop this.”
“I’m going for a drive.” Dean spun on the stool and stalked out of the galley. The iron door at the top of the stairs at the head of the crow’s nest slammed so that the clanging echo could be heard all the into the galley. Sam was alone in the bunker. He went to the library and got a legal pad and a pen from drawers hidden into the skirt of the center tables. The note started with a series of runes and glyphs then in English read:
“Um, yeah.” Dean ran a hand over the back of his neck. The rolling clouds smoothed to a thick overcast. “Look, I need to take a leak.”
“First.” Zack smiled at the portrait wall where a discrete, small man in janitorial chambray had just finished hanging a new portrait on a previously installed nail. The black eyes of the room rolled to look at the new framed face and then back at the head of the table with the same face. A few mediocre golf claps were all the congratulations Zack received.
“I hate doing this to him, Castiel. He’s only ever done what he thought was best.” Dean Jr. shook his head. He had been keeping his father asleep with morphine and holding him on just this side of death with magic.
By that evening, Sam and Dean were at a pie festival two counties over. When they got out of the car Dean felt what little joy he was able to muster leave him. The smell of fresh pie of every kind hung in the air. For a second, Dean imagined Jack’s bright eyes and wondrous grin as he and Castiel followed him from booth to booth with Sam and Eileen trailing after. Castiel couldn’t enjoy the pie the same way Jack and Dean would, but he would have tasted each one at Dean’s urging. Eileen would have gone with Jack to stock up on the homemade jams and candies to take home.
“Um.” Sam looked at the phone. He hadn’t put in a location, but it displayed a blue line anyways and an ETA. “About an hour.”
“Castiel?” Naomi laced her fingers in front of her like a cradle looking supportive instead of insubordinate.  “Something needs to be done. This is a real threat to Heaven; Dean is a real threat.”
The skin of the t-rex quivered. Its irises expanded to swallow the entirety of its sockets. Dean scowled. He reached into the impala and wrenched a bottle from a duffle in the passenger seat. The clouds roiled in tight circles around the beast. He prowled toward the creature, his voice rising with every word. “
“Shhh.” Castiel ran a firm, warm palm over the back of Dean’s neck, pressing where the spine met the skull and then caressing down the spine.
“I can make him sleep.” She offered, “He will just close his eyes and rest until the second coming.”
Castiel stepped closer so that his knees touched Dean’s. He leaned over and kissed Dean atop the head at the hairline. He smelled of pine forests and smokey whiskey. Dean closed his eyes and let the warmth of Castiel’s lips melt into his skull. The next kiss landed between his knotted brows. Again, the kiss’s warmth melted past his skin. A tingling sensation danced over his scalp and he tilted his face up.
Castiel tossed the funky clothing from the bed and retrieved the pillows from the floor without a word about the condition of the room. He fluffed the pillows and smoothed the sheets with the top corner on the right side of the bed pulled back. With tender motions Castiel ushered Dean to the edge of the bed and guided him to sit. The angel knelt and undid the laces on Dean’s boots and slipped them off. He stood and placed his hands on Dean’s shoulders to lay him down.
Castiel’s Adam’s apple rose and fell. Dean paused. His slutty power play had gone too far. He put the lube down on the nightstand and sat up to meet Castiel’s gaze. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think.”
Sam exited through the maintenance portal his brother hand departed from. Outside the door he found three sizable rocks. He lined them up just off the path that led to the driveway. On the last rock in the row he pierced his thumb with his pocket knife and dotted it with his blood. The note went underneath.
The table looked to the young woman, the only one standing. She smiled nervously, “I’m sure Mr. Smith will be in shortly.”
Castiel stiffly sat on the bed next to Dean. A silence stretched between them; the angel staring at the ceiling and the man staring at the floor. Both held their own hands in their own laps.
Lock picks were a surprising find, but completely useless. The tumblers inside the old brass lock would not be persuaded. Sam gave up on the picks and continued to toss the room. He felt like a creeper.
Castiel continued, “Jack, God, before he left, set some things right and made a few changes. Since all the archangels are either dead or missing, he asked if I wanted to keep watch over heaven. I accepted and so I am now capable of, um, all kinds of things.”
The impala was coming up the road. Dean gawked through the windshield. Sam was flat on the pavement in a pool of his own blood.
He walked, and walked, and walked. The highway was infinitely straight. Didn’t it curve and have a few dips over the hills? Sam’s stomach started to growl. He estimated he had been out for about two, maybe two and a half hours. If he had been doing a pace of about half a mile every fifteen minutes, he was about four or so miles from the bunker. He should have reached the old gas station nearby. He hadn’t seen any mark of civilization, not even a tire mark or the flotsam and jetsam of cars that gets incorporated into the road grit. Sam became uneasy. Should he turn back or press on to see how far this went unchanging?
Dean stopped in front of the shower room entrance and turned to Castiel, “That’s the second time you’ve looked at me like that.”
Dean released first, spilling himself over the top blanket. The pulsing deep inside Dean had Castiel pushing himself as far in as he could go before he let his own release go.
Castiel straightened from his kneeling position and fervently kissed Dean again. With a hardy appetite, Dean returned it. The angel took a moment to scan his beloved soul with his angelic sight. Dean’s aura was still muddy with a black, brown and grey fog swirling about him near the floor, but around his heart and head grew an optimistic ray of sunshine yellow with fringes of courage flickering in campfire orange. From his heart to his loins snaked a ribbon of lustful red. Castiel blinked his angelic sight from his eyes so he could see Dean’s ivy green eyes without the glow of his soul washing them out. His crying had left them red rimmed, but the early crows’ feet at the corners were impishly suggestive.
Dean drove like a bat out of hell. Sam unbuckled as Dean parked the car neatly in front of the spooky, abandoned barn at the end of an overgrown, nearly invisible country driveway. His brother got out and slammed the door. Between the rumble of the engine and the slamming of the driver’s door one might as well play shave and a haircut on the car horn.
-Wow, why are you so worked up? It was just a kiss, after all, right? – Cas changed the look on his face, looking embarrassed. – Cas? Cas… You have been with other people, or huh, angels, before,
And in the next moment, he’s alone. No sounds, no black goo, just him, all of Cas’ words already playing back in his head. The place Cas’ touched feels hot and he sees there’s a bloody handprint on his shoulder. Just like the scar Cas left when he pulled Dean out of Hell. When he lost himself, when he fell, like all those demons and angels always said.
Cas raises one of his eyebrows and there’s a moment of silence. Dean and his big mouth saying the wrong things all of the time.
BAM “But I think I know - - I think I know now. Happiness isn’t in the having. It’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.”
-Sorry. Each Circle of Hell contains and punishes one kind of sin. Like I said, Circle 8 is about Fraud. Circle 7 is about Violence, to others, to themselves, against God. Circle 6 is Heresy, Circle 5 is Wrath, Circle 4 is Greed, Circle 3 is Gluttony, Circle 2 is Lust and Circle 1 is some sort of limbo, where pagans who lived morally lives are, Heaven couldn’t take them, neither did Hell.
him to just do it. Dean kissed him in the most soft and delicate possible way, surprising even himself by doing so. Suddenly, his soul, even smaller with so many pieces missing, was shining gold and green more than ever before.
-Easy there, I may have missed some birthdays, but does that makes me that much of a terrible father?
supposed to be affected by Dean being so hurt, wasn’t he? Dean also wasn’t flattered by being hurt in the first place.
him around, he just did as he was told and drank a whole cup in record time, only to refill it and walk to the table next to Cas.
is in front of him but a lifetime of being deceived still letting his gun in a firm grip pointing to the angel.
That made Dean come back to reality yet again. How many times his mind has scape from it just in the time he has known Cas? How come their talks feel like he was entering another dimension? Is that something angels do? He didn’t want to fight Hell, he wanted to stay there with Cas, hidden so no demons would interfere, and away from Earth where The Apocalypse was about to begin.
-Almost everything is compartmentalized between the angels, including information. None of us need to know everything that’s going to happen, just enough.
Sam is getting better at it. Jack still just sleep when Dean is the one to sing something or tell a story, but he’s fond of Sam now too. Laughs when he does something silly, likes to pull his hair just like Dean taught him.
They didn’t talk much this time. Something changed how they see each other. Cas was thinking about what Madge could have said to break Dean’s soul, he wanted to ask, but he felt like if he did, Dean wasn’t going to be open or honest about it. He also wonders if Dean is starting to see himself. Truly see how pure his soul is. The angel also wanted to talk about it, but his soul was one more thing Dean showed not to want to talk about.
Who cares he liked Elsa and wanted her doll? He looks adorable playing with it. His behaviors are all over the place and don’t make sense to his age or size, but I think he’ll adjust and he’s just a child. That was what I kept telling myself,
Dean’s mind have been going a thousand miles per hour since they left the torture room, but now it seems to be impossible for Dean to understand any kind of information.
-I’m as confused as you are, Dean. I’ve never done any of this. I’ve never even thought about it, because I’m a soldier, that’s what I do, what I’m good at. So, are we really going to talk about it? Because if the answer is no, if we are going to just start a conversation and feel weird and make things even more confusing, we really should just keep going like you said it yourself.
Dean did as he was told. He couldn’t deny, he was so curious. An angel, right in front of him. A nice one, as far as he could tell.
Dean, the righteous man, the most beautiful soul he has ever seen, the man that had so much to deal with in his life like Cas have been seeing while they go thought The Circles of Hell. The man that is so loving, caring, and devoted. He was kissing Castiel, in such a beautiful way. Like Dean was somehow…
I also need to talk about how gender is dealt in this chapter. Is a really short part because I'm cis, therefore I don't have the right to claim anything way to deep about it. The show made a mess when it comes to angels gender, and I know a lot of us are still confused by it, so I used something that I have heard some other fans use as their interpretation. I really hope that what I wrote doesn't hurt anyone, and if you guys see a problem with it please let me know so we can talk about and I can change it to something better.
-Then do it. I don’t want some stranger looking into my soul and saying things about it, and I certainly don’t wanna see this ugly thing myself while I have to go all the way through Hell.
Was Dean scared to death to see someone talk like that to God? Hell yes. Was he damn proud of his boyfriend saying those things to his absent father? You better fucking bet he was.
But he’s almost there, seven of The Circles of Hell were past him now. One more step and he would be were Dean Winchester was, hopeful before the first seal was broken.
-I know, Dean, trust me, I understand, I thought that myself when I was looking for you, but is going to be hard enough for me to get you out, getting all of them by myself is impossible, suicidal even try it, especially if I don’t know how much my feelings for you affect my powers. Besides, not all of them have a body I can put back together to where they can return.
-Dean, go through all of that will break your soul. Piece by piece, but it will. I will need to put all of it back together and then reconstruct your human body.
-Yes, your life had traumatizing moments, but somehow you managed to go through all of it and remain pure. It takes a lot to do that.
-So my soul will be divide like freaking Voldemort. If you ever meet him, don’t tell Sam I know this.
-It’s your soul, Dean – Castiel says with a soft smile, happy that it worked and that Dean could finally see the beauty of his soul.
Dean’s soul was on display again. And again he focused on the black and red part, while all Cas could see was gold and green.
Those comments always make Dean shut himself for a couple of days, only interacting with Jack when it's bedtime, so Sam just stops making them.
oblivious, or stupid. He just has enough trauma and probably several undiagnosed mental illnesses to make sure he keeps this shit burred. Deep,
“What do you want, huh? You already had your bottle, Sam bathed you, your diaper is clean, you have your stupid blanket, you don’t want to be in your crib, we have walked half of the Bunker… What do you want from me?”
he was doing it. He was old, really old, what equals powerful. We really tried to stop him, we just couldn’t do it.
-“Is Hell, the more we stay, the more it can manipulate us into doing what it wants us to do.” – Did he sound like a child? Absolutely. Did he care? Not at all.
“No, I mean… It's… Complicated. His real Dad is like, the worst, and my best friend was going to look after the kid and the mom, but now my best friend is de…” No, he still can’t say it out loud, his throat getting tight, something bitter on his mouth. C’mon Winchester, get it together, deep breath, you can end this conversation without looking like a baby abductor. “Me and my brother are all there’s left. We’re all he’s got.”
I will take him anyway and play doctor to give him a forced lobotomy, with lots of games until he forgets what happened here. You’ll forget that you met him at all and we rewind a bit to create a different kind of Hell marked in your brain. Same origin to your love story, different memories. How does that sound?
He misses being drunk too. God, the things he would do just to be able to go out and drink until he forgets his name, his life, his pain.
-No! Why? – Dean was lost in words. He didn’t know what to say, he just knew he wanted to see Cas – Do it again.
Reality dragged Dean back to his head. He could die. Again. In The Apocalypse. If anyone told him this even two years ago he would shoot the son of a bitch. Well, if two years were Earth years. He didn’t know what was worse, stay in Hell or going back to fight and possibly die and go to Hell again. Even with Heaven being real, that’s not where he’s going after this, is it? Is Heaven even real? Cas is an angel, he has siblings and apparently God is real too, so Heaven exists, right?
-I just had a piece of my soul torn apart, Cas. But, yeah, overall it was better than the last Circle. We should keep goin’, right?
They breathe and calm down, Cas goes check Jack because Dean is not getting out of bed just because they finally stopped being morons, he keeps his word.
He had heard of how humans show affection, but he was never part of it. He liked it. Especially because it was with
A moment passed and Dean sighed. Apparently, Cas didn’t understand a lot of human things and was curious. But how to explain that when even Dean couldn’t understand it?
He didn’t even remember finding Sam, or even putting Jack on his lap, Dean just remembered the picture of Jack safe with his brother inside his head and then he left.
Cas choose The Righteous Man, the unstoppable soldier, the selfless, the beautiful, the somehow funny, Dean.
-I’m telling you man, once I get out of here I’m taking Latin classes, all of this crap would make more sense.
“It’s lovely. I also saw all the guns locked away, and every corner with protection to kids. And the toys, bottles, clothes and plushies.”
-Oh my God, when did we get married to be discussing this like it? Cas, I won’t say yes. You think your family will kick you out because we are together? Fine, you come live with me and mine.
-Yeah, was that really you, or was it Hell making you say those things, huh? Just to torture me, just to give me hope of having someone really getting me and wanting me and then making it clear it wasn’t real?
-I’m a Goddess, and we are in Hell, boy, I can read your mind, I can see your soul. Do you think he can’t? All this melancholy, this self-hatred, all the obvious daddy issues… Do you think he see you in any different way he sees an ant? He’s
Jack can be good with Sam for long enough so Dean can drink a little bit. He doesn’t get drunk, but is nice to have the familiar burn in his throat ever once in a while.
Dean couldn’t be the cause of so much pain to Cas. Not after falling so hard for him, not after everything Cas went through to get him out of Hell, not after making Cas decide to abandon everything and everyone he ever met just to be with Dean. This was to much.
Jack had the cream truck on his hand when he did it. All the build up to the perfect little bobble Dean put around them, all the joy shattered inside of him. Regret from spending so much time with Jack in the garage and showing all the cars running through him.
When Dean walks in the room, Jack is already awake and up, hold on the bars of his crib. He has a smile on his face like he knows what Christmas is and that he got lots of gifs to open.
-Dean! – The angel tried to reach him, but before he could get to him, Dean made a sign for him to keep his distance.
-Why didn’t you guys stop Azazel? I get that you try to do this only when necessary, but a demon bleeding inside of children to transform them into something more than normal humans isn’t worth of a visit from you guys?
Dean could feel all the times he ended up burnt because he had to make sure Sam had something to eat while John was away, but Dean was still too young to know how to cook properly.
-I’m not a demon, I told you, I’m an angel of The Lord and my mission is to take you out of here. It would be best if you just come with me.
Jack is almost talking. He tries to copy whatever the boys are saying in the middle of a fight about something stupid and that’s what makes them stop. They don’t know what to do. People usually try to make their kids say something related to them first. But what would they encourage Jack to say? “Daddy”? It doesn’t feel right. Yes, they’re raising him, but something is missing, like they need permission from someone to consider themselves that.
-Is okay, Dean, I’ll watch over you. We’ll remember. There’s one thing you can’t change, Chuck. Dean Winchester is saved!
-That reminds me that souls being able to be broken in pieces will also mess up Sam’s story. What can I do so the trauma really stick? Maybe… pretend everything is okay behind a protection and suddenly break it? Oh! Make Sam see Lucifer even out of the cage, it will drive him nuts! Yeah, that should be fun. No more souls into pieces. Speaking about Sam, I really want to keep the demon blood addiction going on, but that might be too much, who knows, I’ll look into it later. Maybe he shouldn’t be the main character anymore, this thing between you two has potential. Maybe I should give you more seasons. Oh me, I’m so excited, this never happened before, I have no idea what Castiel here will do. Will that interfere with your decision-making, Dean? I bet it will. Okay, okay, calm down Chuck, don’t think much about it, let it be a surprise, is going to be good, just let him know less things about The Apocalypse, let’s see how he works with less information.
There. They said it. Every single letter, they said ‘I love you’ and none of them was afraid to say it.
How many of them were there because they were born at the wrong time? Or not accepting some sort of rules of a religion they didn’t believe in? Or because of a deal?
-We are in Hell and I’m going to torture you, demon didn’t cross your mind? You’re getting’ lazy, boy. Still, we will have so. Much. Fun.
Here, all the things he could hear, smell and feel back in the beginning of his journey are stronger, louder. He remembers himself that this was one of the deepest circles in perdition, and that should be warning enough for him to be prepared to this.
-Dean, you were tortured by Alastair, Hell’s best torturer, and Lilith herself. No one expected you not to surrender.
They were still in Hell, they had to stop talking and kill some demons along the way, but that just made everything fit even more, once they both were soldiers, they both had been brainwashed into fighting, it just felt good to have someone watching your back. It was a different way friends and siblings would do that, knowing that they would die and kill for each other because the other himself were past been just someone else, they were extensions of their beings.
-Not my problem. I’m dead, why should I care about humankind’s fate? Go on, try to save them, I won’t.
-That’s what I’m trying to say, my siblings are not as patient as you think. They won’t just not approve our relationship, they will hunt us down, we won’t live anywhere, we will always be on the run.
-“I am Icarus. Many people see my death as a tragedy; that is very wrong. In my opinion, they did not tell you, when Apollo gave me wings, they did not tell you that I knew I would burn in flames, I knew. You see, I knew the agony I would face, and as I fell, I knew I did it for the
-Only you could face that. If it’s consolation, I would give anything for you not have to face that. – Dean looks down, suddenly guilty for yelling. Then, a thought crosses his mind.
“Oh, thank you, but we’re fine.” A sharp sound and Dean closes his eyes. Jack was distracted with his rattle, and of fucking course he had to hit Dean the exact moment he has to pretend to have everything under control.
“Are you trying to get as tall as Sam? You don’t have to, you know that, right kiddo?” The smile on Dean’s face after listening Jack laugh was there for a total of 2 seconds. He wishes he could have made Cas laugh more often. Maybe even learn some Enochain, Cas told them a joke once and said it was funnier in Enochain.
-Here, let me help you. – Two of his fingers touched the man’s forehead, and somehow Dean felt the room (at least it looked like one) be filled with some kind of light. It took a couple of minutes for him to notice that the light was coming from him. Some gold and green, but his eyes immediately found the black and red on it too. Like big and ugly scars, craved in what he supposes is his soul.
-Is a place for people and angels that couldn’t chose between good and bad, Heaven and Hell, so they stay there and are torment into making decisions. Since you don’t remember The Circles, I’m assuming they put you back together, like I said, and you will go through all the punishments, again. Everyone in the Ante Inferno is distract enough for me to put you back together.
An awful sound comes from behind him and he knows, he just knows that’s the Empty. This can’t be happening again. Why is the Empty here? He didn’t say it back. He couldn’t say it back because of this, so this wouldn’t happen…
Hell was molding itself to contain Dean, Lilith wouldn’t let him go away that easy, and they noticed it. Circles 3 and 2, Gluttony and Lust got together to punish Dean all at once. Gluttony preventing Dean to move with chains all around him, hooks piercing his flesh; Lust causing storms of rocks, hitting him.
“Every time I tried to go you woke up and wouldn’t let go off my sleeves, and the one time you did, you started having nightmares before I got to the door.”
“Hello, Baby, how you feel about getting some air? I know I haven’t been taking you out lately, I’m kinda busy. I’ll try to make more time for you, I promise.”
“Exactly! Are you seeing someone else here to take care of him? No, so what, you wanna take him with us?”
-It’s complicated, is a human and an angel, we are in Hell, there’s an Apocalypse to be taken care of, is always going to be complicated, but please remember what I told you. I don’t know what this is, but I
They are in bed, breathing fast and short, and God can Cas manhandle him, and God how Dean loves it.
-I want to have you craved in me at all times. My guardian angel, savior, sexy boyfriend, ya know, the whole package.
“CAS! Cas! Cassy!” Jack says the minute he puts his eyes on Cas. He lets go on Dean’s shoulders and almost jumps from Dean’s arms into Cas’ direction.
A confused grin crosses Dean’s face. Talking about it was giving him a headache. He knew deep down how he felt, who he was, but his whole life pointed to the other direction and after that New Years, Dean did everything to keep those feelings buried and hided, even from himself.
-Then how come there isn’t thousands of fanatics being an angelic condom? A lot of them ask for this, don’t they?
And for the first time, Castiel saw what Dean was talking about. Pieces of his soul were marked, like he’s went through a lot.
you, Cas, so yeah, I acted upon my best friend’s dying wish. Wanna know my plan? Raise the Devil’s son until I was sure he wasn’t bad because you said so, and just fucking give up this crappy life. So yes, I did what I thought you would want because I was fucking grieving.”
-You are the only one that can know. Violence is not just about physically hurting someone. Is about any kind of violence in your life. To others, to yourself, both of them being creations of my Father, therefore, the violence is against God, too. I will be able to see it once we get there, but only you can know what you might have to face before we are actually inside of it.
He walks and walks some more, and actually sees some poor tortured souls along the way. He wonders what they have done to deserve be all the way down there. The angel knows some humans are capable of doing awful things, some are worthy of an eternity of pain, but all of those who ended up (well, down) in Hell have really deserved it?
-Look who’s talking. You wanna ignore all the absolute crap your life was? Fine by me. Let’s make up a scenario, shall we? Let’s pretend mommy never died, just a normal family, normal life.
see. He didn’t want to make the same mistake again and lose the chance of touching them, but for some reason Dean felt like that was far too intimate to do in front of someone else.
This kid definitely can understand what he’s saying, and Dean chose to ignore how familiar that curious look on his face made his heart ache. Not so slowly, Jack brought his little hand and gave little pats on Dean’s mouth.
“Maybe the help could include figuring that out too?” She had a nice laugh, he could make some moves and probably have some fun, and still, he never felt less in the mood than right now.
“C’mon kiddo, give us a break, please stop crying, Sam’s hair is going to fall out if you keep this pace and that’s something we don’t want to deal with right now.”
Sam sounds alarmed so Dean lets the hunter inside of him take over. He just passed out last night so he’s dressed and he only takes his gun and runs to the library, making sure Jack’s room it's locked on the way.
Cas looked around. Maybe if they were quick… That could make Dean trust him more, maybe even realize how beautiful
“I thought I couldn’t. He was the reason you… I couldn’t, not at first. Then he was just a child. He grows up like fucking Renesbery or whatever her name is, but still, he’s just a child. He likes the same cartoons I like. He plays with cars and gets excited whenever we go out on Baby. He also likes to play with dolls and for a moment I thought it would be weird but he’s
Inside his stupidly long arms, still wrapped in a towel, the source of the crying and screaming was moving to every possible direction. That was until he saw Dean and decided that that was where he was going, one way or another.
A fight started. They really wanted to get to Dean, and Cas was doing everything he could to not let them. He wasn’t supposed to tell Dean how to pass this Circle, it was important to him to figure it out on his own, he had to have faith. All Castiel could do was buy him some time.
him. Anna used to be my superior for more time, but she fell, now Zachariah is my direct commander. I command some angels myself, like Uriel. He’s the funniest, you would like him.
Cas put himself in front of Dean. He kept his vessel, but put his wings on display. They mesmerized Dean once again.
“I always wondered, ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be, what my true happiness could even look like. I never found an answer. Because the one thing I want… Is something I know I can’t have.” What on Earth Cas can’t have? He’s
But then Sam tells him he found another case, and he’s going since Dean has Cas to help him take care of Jack. He doesn’t leave room for any kind of disagreement and just leaves, like he has an itch that would only be solved if he went out to hunt. Talk about character development, huh?
And he did it in front of his homophobic and abusive father. Nice, Dean! You got the bingo of screwing it up.
Both of them lost track of how long they were there, but finally they got out. Dean had his punishment.
Dean looked in Cas’s eyes. He was really doing it, huh? After years of rejection and self-hatred, Dean allowed himself to do something he wanted to do since he saw Cas’s true form. Everything inside of him was screaming that that was wrong,
And of course, with them being so close to get out, the amount of demons trying to stop them was getting bigger. Both of them fighting side by side had become almost a dance, so coordinate, so easy, like a second nature. Just like all the fights after that when they would scream at each other because putting themselves in front of the other to sacrifice their chance so at least one could get out was not okay either.
Getting to the Ante Inferno took longer than they thought it would, but they were finally there. Feeling so more comfortable around each other at the same time all of it felt new. Discussions and bickering were also part of it, both of them being so stubborn; with the other making them admit sometimes they were wrong, that if they knew each other back then, they would try to stop it, to find other solutions.
-That’s sweet. I really am curious about this, but I have a whole plot ready, so this will have to wait. Can you do this for me, Castiel? Can you be patient? There is more than one love interest to Dean planned already, I was putting some clues about him being bisexual until I was sure that was something I wanted to go with, but now it seems more interesting than ever. Of course, him being repressed and traumatized will make the trick to make him behave like the women heartbreaker that he is. Oh, oh! I can make a male love interest for him
-Is true, we are inside of Greed, we were being greedy, it wants us to stay here forever and we can’t do that, if we do, soon nothing will ever be enough for us.
Dean’s life have always been violent. Every second of it, from the way his mother was murdered to the way he died as hellhound’s food.
Maybe he just had to not talk about Cas with Jack. If he kept his mouth shut, Jack wouldn’t have said his name, and Dean wouldn’t be freaking out. But how could he
They were almost done when Dean saw a baby blue shirt with cursive lettering and the saying “Little Angel” that caught his eye. That had to be the corniest shirt imaginable in this situation. But who was Dean if not a corny bastard? Of course they needed that shirt. He would order a personalized Led Zeppelin shirt for Jack online once they were back home, just to balance things. If he had to do this, he was going to do it right.
Fireworks. The silence was filled with the sound of fireworks, and random people shouting “Happy New Year”. And Dean saw, for the first time in years, he saw something he was blocking so deep inside of him that he didn’t remember it happened at all.
-Yes, a warrior. A good one, I like to think. I have won some important battles as a commander and warrior. That is why they sent me. Other tried and failed, died, so they were hoping I could do it.
-I’m an angel, so everything that makes Hell be, well, Hell, will be focused on you, a human. Those things are going to confront
“So, darn and fregging. Why?” it still took Dean sometime to make sense of what Cas was saying. Until it clicked.
“No. We had a deal, I sang to you once, and that was it.” The little and harmless pats became more persistent. “Okay, fine, you little blackmailer, but it’s going to be some song
Usually, Sam's the one doing the shopping, but Dean was on his own today. At least Jack's calm so far. The first store was a “no, thank you” right away. Who dresses a baby like that? Rich people are insane and that store with
-Is it because I’m in a male vessel? – Cas didn’t want to think like that, but a lot of Dean’s hell was about his sexuality. How with the limited time to get out of Hell he would explain that angels don’t have a gender but when they get a vessel they use what they feel more comfortable with? He wouldn’t change that, for anyone.
-Falling… In an angel falling from the sky kind of way, right? Not the human “falling”… in sentiments kind of way?
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” Tell me I’m wrong. Tell me you have a plan and we can get out of here. Both of us. Tell me. Please. BAM.
The kiss ended slowly, with Dean giving pecks on Cas’s lips like he didn’t want this to stop. There where silence for a while, Dean had his eyes closed and their foreheads were touching.
It feels like little wins all day at the same time that feeling of home, of ‘this is what we should be doing all the time’ gets inside of, Dean hopes, all of them.
-You regret it? – Cas didn’t know how to describe what he was feeling, but it wasn’t nice like what he felt when Dean kissed him.
Limbo felt different from the other parts of Hell. There was this generalized sadness, at the same time it felt more… pure. Felt like they were almost out of Hell, and it didn’t even cross their minds that there was an Apocalypse to be taken care of. All they could think of was being out, being together.
With that Cas gripped Dean by the shoulder, putting his wings out and flying with him to the border of Greed. When they were almost out of it, Cas fell, folding his wings around Dean and him.
What’s that thing they say about start moving the minute you hold a baby? It doesn’t make sense, and if you asked him, he would say it's stupid, but he did it anyways.
The angel washes all of those thoughts away. He has to concentrate, he has a mission, one that was given by Heaven, he needs to save Michael’s true vessel. He doesn’t agree with what they’re doing even though Heaven has a plan. He knows The Apocalypse must happen; Lucifer has to be freed so Michael can kill him, for good this time.
when all Cas apparently wanted was the same thing Dean wanted… The ‘Sunshine’ and probably Sweetheart, or Honey, or
-Only you did, Cas. Is ok, I get it, you’re an angel, I’m just an annoying human who’s demanding things.
“The -- the price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.” Of course the price would be his life, but way say this?
He took a deep breath and went to Jack’s room, Cas looked more lost than ever and Jack had big round tears running his face.
All that wrath helped Dean move, finally, and everything happened to fast. Cas was already by his side since the whole story broke more than one part of his soul. He took Cas by the arm and got close to the demon, putting Cas’s hand on his forehead
This is wrong. Everything in him tells him that this is wrong. This can’t be it. Cas can’t be gone again.
“And she’s gonna kill you, and then she’s gonna kill me.” Just so it can hurt more. She knows it will hurt more if she kills Cas first. If he has to see what he did to Cas, to lose him again, even for just a few minutes before she kills Dean. BAM. “I’m sorry.”
The demon was laughing, and Cas’s heart was breaking. He didn’t want Dean to feel like this, he wanted to tell him that physically fighting was not the answer, not in this Circle where the whole point was to make souls fight for the eternity, but he couldn’t.
Dean couldn’t care less to said battles. It wouldn’t kill them to check up once in a while, right? Take care of some wars, cure some diseases…
-I don’t know where you are seeing a road made of yellow bricks, but the other part of your question… Hell is a place where not only you are judge for your sins, but you have to face them. As if your mistakes and fears could personalize in front of you.
His hands still have some bruises, but he expected that after punching a fucking door of all things. His ego should be bruised as well after properly
In the morning, he makes his way to the kitchen, happier than ever when he sees there’s fresh coffee already there. Also because Cas is sitting there, looking at his phone.
-We can’t stay, is Hell, the more we stay, the more it can manipulate us into doing what it wants us to do.
That seemed to make the bartender back off, and he was loud enough to keep anyone away, what seemed to be what Dean wanted, but now he just feel like picking up a fight. He just need a little excuse to punch someone,
-Well, we didn’t need it for a very long time, like I said. And it can’t be anyone, there are certain bloodlines for each angel.
Eternity. The Universe. That’s what it felt like to both of them while they looked each other deep in the eyes.
It was unexpected, but Dean started crying. He almost never cries. But how could he not? Everything, all the weigh that was on his shoulders for his whole life felt heavier.
Cas was ready to help Dean out so they could keep going, but something else was in the way, the angel could feel it blocking the way out. Dean hadn’t face everything.
-I’m talking to my son here, Feathery. Those bastards didn’t let me in, so I had to walk in the veil for a while, until I come back downstairs, and when they told me you gave up
back, no going anywhere, really. All of this because of him. Because he couldn’t think without having his anger change things into something they never were. He screw it up. Again. God, they’re gonna die here, now, away from the rest of their family because he was wrong.
Dean choose The (Possible Fallen) Angel of The Lord, the glorious warrior, the mighty, the adorable, the cutest of all, Castiel.
“It's okay.” It's not, they both know that. Cas sits beside Dean on his bed and waits a few more minutes before talking again. “I saw the nursery.”
-You’re telling me you haven’t think about kissing again since the moment we stopped like I am? – The angel is shy and Dean could swore that if he were human he would be blushing.
It doesn’t last long though, because way too soon, Jack takes his first steps, and now he wants to walk everywhere, and they need to pay extra attention on him. He likes to bite stuff too, should a baby have so damn strong bites even without teeth? And of course he couldn’t care less to the toys
It was 2000. Finally. Something made Dean feel like things would change just like the millennium did, and so he allowed himself to do something he wanted to do for a very long time. He kissed someone. He kissed someone at midnight, like so many people do. The problem was: John saw it. John saw Dean kiss another man. That almost got Dean dead. John was furious. He was uncontrollable. The things he said… That, combined with had to be the worst beating John ever got him. Even worse than the time Sam ran away on his watch. He couldn’t move for a few days.
-So I could survive! Don’t you think I wanted to go away? I tried to run away so many times, the only reason I always gave up was so Sammy wouldn’t be alone with you!
not to walk among you as much as possible, but sometimes it is necessary. We have battles. We do our best to protect humankind.
The last one was when Dean had to stole food and was caught by the cops. How John didn’t want anything to do with Dean and abandoned him for months. How much he wanted to stay with the new life he had but he was forced to go back to John because after all those years, he knew it was his job to take care of Sam, and Sam would never be safe alone with John, not until he could defend himself.
Sam has a smile on his face that many people would think is like a proud parent who’s about to talk nonstop about his kid, but Dean knows better. He sees himself on Sam’s face. That’s the face of a sibling who cares about a child like a parent would because of circumstances. It doesn’t mean Sam loves Jack any less or that he is less than excited to apparently tell Cas all about Jack. Dean uses that as an excuse to go get Jack. That’s what Cas wants, right?
You can’t really do much without him, can you? Even when you had him by your side, he would always have to “discipline” you, right? What about that time your little brother shot a deer when it was supposed to be you shooting Bambi? You think he still loved you after that? Has he ever? – Dean was tired of it, of always be expected to reach expectations of others, and especially John’s.
you two try this figured this thing out! Love triangle with the amount of trauma he has? Is going to be amazing.
Cas making Dean realize Sam is not a kid anymore, that he knows how important they are to each other, that growing up the only thing they had was one another, but that they can’t keep being so codependent.
– now Dean looks around, trying to find Alastair somewhere, he would probably be laughing – I told you, Alastair, I’m in it, stop trying to torture me, it won’t work.
Jack was so silent now, looking between Dean and the nice lady, doing that thing with his eyebrows that look exactly like Cas when he was confused…
They enter Greed, and Dean immediately holds Cas’s hand. They look everywhere for what should be a threat, but nothing happens.
Something inside of Dean started changing. Maybe Cas is right. He wouldn’t lie, right? Maybe, just maybe, Dean was more than he saw, maybe he was better.
How could Cas explain what he was feeling? What Dean made him feel? How he was starting to feel like no, his siblings many times didn’t treat him like real family, no, God was not a good Father, yes, he wanted to be with Dean and meet all these amazing friends and family of his.
. Yes, I’m Dean Freaking Winchester, that’s why you should do what I tell you to do, I have no problem torturing souls, torturing a demon would be like a bonus.
Cas now had his eyes wide open, a feeling of pure enthusiasm growing inside of him. When Dean felt ready, he opened his eyes, but nothing in the world could prepare him to how he felt looking at the ocean blue eyes so close. It was like they were the same blue he saw mixed with white in Cas’s true form. What he saw when he looked slighted down was even better. For the first time he saw Cas smile. To just complete the best moment of Dean’s life, he saw that at some point, Cas’s wings were back on display, with its colors more bright than he remembered. Finally something from his real form that Dean could
“You what?” The big win with no strings attached actually had strings? Is that what Cas is trying to say? For what? They are going to die one way or another.
-Dean, I promise you, one day I will be able to make you see yourself the way that I do. And is not just me, Dean. Anyone from Heaven or Hell can see it too. That’s why those demons and gods hate you so much, they never saw someone like you, at the same time they wish they were exactly the same as you.
“No, no kid, please don’r cry. It's just… I don’t think I was ready to hear you saying Cas’s name. I always miss him, and you two look so much alike, but you saying his name just make everything so more real, and it hurts. It just hurts too much, Jack. I’m not upset with you, and I’m not leaving, it's just… I need some time.”
think about coming back, about talking to your brother or so help me God I’ll kill you, I don’t want Sammy any near this thing that’s inside of you, is probably contagious. Get out or I’ll burn everything in your room and I won’t check if you’re inside of it or not before I do so.
-Look, pal, I couldn’t care less about your name, just watch, don’t get in the way and let me do my job, alright?
Dean started moving around, he brushed his teeth in the sink close to his door and was going to change his clothes when he really said ‘fuck it all’.
He doesn’t know how, but some of the fights, some of the people and the monsters were there, right in front of him, passing through him, leaving him feeling like he was being cut and burn over and over again, sometimes he could feel like someone actually punched him. His body tried to fight back, but he couldn’t reach them.
like a warrior would kiss someone before battle. Isn’t that kind of what he’s doing? After all, there’s always a battle in front of them, right?
why on earth talk about it with a stranger, as quick as it was. Little fingers started to pull his shirt.
-Weren’t you the one involved in that interaction? I suppose you are the one expected to enjoy it. – A sad laugh left Dean’s lips.
This sound so much better than how they said those almost exact same words before. They were walking close to each other again, not holding hands, but their pinkies touched now and then.
The Circles of Gluttony and Lust, where Dean has to fight both of them at once, and he's not the only one suffering.
-I was trying a luck move. Dean, the only way of getting out of here is if you genuinely want to leave.
-Let’s see how this go. Remember, is not me, I know everything that has ever crossed your head and your daddy’s. – A smile that could make anyone feel disgusted, combined with a singing voice. - This is all him.
Sam left that same day to solve the case, and that leaves Dean on his own to take care of the kid, but hey, he can manage it. Maybe he can open a daycare if he ever truly gets out of the life. Something to keep his mind busy while Jack goes through teenage and thinks he can take care of himself. But right now, he’s definitely growing up way too fast. The last time they bought new clothes for Jack had to be three weeks ago, tops, and now even the big ones are almost small for him.
I'm sorry it took so long to post again, I was busy freaking out with Four Letter Word like the rest of the fandom (highly recommend). This chapter is very short so I'll be posting the next one (also kinda short) right away. I wanted to make them be just one chapter, but I decided not to put 3 Circles together.
If he thought Sam looked bad doing the trials to close The Gates of Hell, now he looks miserable. Dark bags under his eyes, a small red mark on his face that Dean put his money on being a slap mark, and his hair, oh dear god,
Cas nodded, snuggling deeper underneath the covers and feeling a warmth spread throughout his body, or perhaps his soul. “Five minutes.” He repeated with a smile.
Dean kneeled down, feeling a dull ache in his back, remembering the effects of his age from various hunts and the strains it seemed to have on him. But this was nothing - he couldn’t care less as he lost himself to simple nostalgia.
Cas held his hand up for Dean to see, his pointer and middle finger pressed together and he pulled them apart to make a vee, the sticky fluid making a transparent web between them. Dean’s eyes widened at the site.
“He is,” Cas said gently, falling onto his back, Dean propped up on his elbow, looking down on him. Cas raised his hand into the particles of grace and spun his hand around them, creating a flurry of the light-blue power. “We’ve all made him who he is in a way.”
“Let’s deal with that tomorrow,” Cas said gently, seeming to catch on to the idea Jack had in the first place, taking a comforter from Sam’s hands and nodding towards the kitchen. “If you want to bake, go ahead.”
Dean’s eyes opened slightly as Cas now hovered over his, leaning on his elbows on either side of Dean’s head. He stared back up, Cas gazing into his green eyes with adoration. “There you are,” Cas sighed, pushing his hair back and pressing another kiss above his brow.
Jack ran a hand through the soft fluff of a faux fur throw, yawning before answering. “Maybe,” he admitted softly. “I can’t really remember.”
and didn’t pride himself on the fact his abdomen was no longer tight around his muscles. Years of hunting had kept him in shape, but age and well-remembered beers and spirits had caught up with him in some places. Not that Cas could find it in him to care or even be bothered. All of Dean was beautiful, and his stomach was no different.
Dean paused, following Cas’ gaze to the indented vee that peeked out slightly from below the waistband and smirked at him. “Come on, I can’t be the only one putting on a show.”
He gained the courage to drag his tongue up to the vee of his legs where they met his pelvis, brushing past the dark curls framing the skin and painfully aware of how close his face was to Dean’s cock which had hardened further. Dean’s hands were no longer on Cash' back, but gently running through his hair, almost tugging at the ends. The effort of the pull wasn’t there, and Cas decided he’d teased Dean enough.
Cas continued to thrust back and forth into him as Dean trembled beneath him matching his pace with the rhythm of his hips as Cas leaned down to his ear, his pace slowly growing faster. “At any other time,” he said, pushing forward deeply and knowing he hit his prostate as Dean’s hand slipped from his mouth and a whine of utter pleasure slipped past his lips, “I’d want to hear every sound you make.”
Dean rubbed small circles on his skin as they both collapsed, the sudden weight of the early morning and clarity of their release washing over them. Cas pressed a gentle kiss to Dean’s cheek and slowly pulled out, wincing slightly as discomfort washed over Dean’s face.
at that moment. It was numbing in their quiet hideaway, and Dean could feel a blush crawl up his neck as the heat seemed to rise between them. The temperature grew in the many sheaths of fabric and he took off his shirt in a swift motion, trying not to draw attention to himself, but feeling Cas’ eyes rake down his chest and an absolute
“I know,” he told him softly, deciding it was too early to have sex with Dean. He wanted to be fully awake to pleasure him with every bit of love and lust he had. “But let me in the morning.”
“I can do that,” Castiel murmured into his ear, adding another finger in without precaution to edging it one knuckle at a time. He was surprised how easily Dean had taken it as it slid in without restraint, the man’s hips pushing into his looking for some friction to soothe him. Cas used his other hand to push back down on his naval, silently telling him
“You’ll ruin me,” Dean breathed, tilting his head back as Cas began to make his way back up towards his lips, his own desire becoming increasingly tight against his boxers.
Cas pressed a gentle, more chaste kiss against his lips, hoping to translate every bit of love that was pent up in his heart for Dean.
Cas tilted his head at the statement, wondering how Jack had known before remembering that the boy was essentially God now, and he could pick up on little cues most of them weren’t even aware they were giving. It was an unsettling notion that he’d have to get used to.
Castiel looked down at him, his eyes dark and ruined, thrusting deeply and barely able to keep himself together.
Slowly, Cas removed his fingers, trying to cause as little discomfort as he could, but the press of Dean’s lips into a line didn’t pass by him. “Sorry,” he whispered, pressing a sweet kiss to the bolt of Dean’s jaw and pulling the blankets down from his chest slightly. He straddled both of Dean’s legs, lining his slicked cock (which was positively
“About Miracle?” He asked, his tone brightening. “She said she’d bring him over with the girls today. I’ve been waiting to meet Claire and Patience - Alex was busy with the hospital and work - but I miss him.”
Dean winced slightly, apparently having not considered the future possibility. “Maybe Jack can mojo him there?”
Dean blushed at his words as Cas drew back slightly and thrust in. Dean tilted his head back, pressing his hand over his own mouth to hide another obscene moan.
Dean paused, looking at Cas and both of them meeting each other with a knowing smile. It made him feel incredibly strange to have Cas understand something human that Jack had yet to learn. “Do you mean
Dean shook his head, raising his hand slightly, almost as if to apologize. “You’re not so much an angel as you’re just
He smiled, looking to Sam’s room where she’d emerged from, and noticed she was wearing one of his shirts which fell down to her thighs, and a pair of loose shorts that accompanied her makeshift pajamas.
He moved to the head, unable to see the color of his cock but indifferent to a visual. The heat from his lips was enough to let him know Dean was heavy with the need for him. Slowly, he drew his tongue across the flat of the curve and heard Dean exhale harshly from above the covers.
“Shh,” he soothed him, placing another kiss on his lips, followed by several more eagerly returned by Dean. “Are you alright?”
Dean smiled, leaning into the pillows and they were both still in the darkness of the room, hearing the door open outside and a few steps come to their door, a soft rap of someone’s knuckles on the other side.
Castiel would emerge from his designated room about half an hour after the Winchesters awoke once he was certain a conversation would be feasible between the three of them. He’d learned more often than not it was pointless to talk to either of them - but more so, Dean - before they were properly caffeinated. Castiel never slept, but rather would meditate on his bed into the early hours of the morning reflecting on far too many topics to discern. He would think most often about his little family that had managed to find each other after many,
“Here,” Cas whispered, lacing their fingers together in one smooth motion and leaning into him, pressing his lips against Dean’s.
“You have your own syrup.” Jack frowned, a confused expression on his face as Dean shook his head, grabbing another two pancakes from off the platter. “Why do you need mine?”
“Eileen-” he started, before she clamped a hand over his mouth drawing her pointer finger to her lips and signaling him to be quiet. He nodded, her hand still tight over his mouth as she drew it back at his response, her expression demure, but eyes filled with mischief.
She nodded, proceeding to make a similar gesture using her index finger instead of pretending to hold a toothbrush.
Cas exhaled with excitement, reaching down and brushing past Dean’s cock which was still erect and down his perineum to where his hole rested, untouched. He pressed his index finger flat to the tight skin, making Dean catch his breath as he caught his eye for permission one more time. Dean didn’t look away, and he pressed to the first knuckle in, sliding with ease as Dean tried to relax his muscles.
“Next time I take you apart,” Cas said, feeling his balls draw up at once. Fuck, he was close. “You’ll cry out for me, won’t you, my love?”
Dean shook his head, crawling into Cas’ arms and pressing his back against his chest. “The morning,” he echoed, reciting his promise with anticipation. “You’ll… you’ll still be here in the morning, right?”
Cas reluctantly pulled himself from the comfort of the bed and put on his own pants, but walked over to Dean’s dresser and pulled out one of
Dean’s breaths were slowly losing rhythm as Cas slid his finger in and out, going up another knuckle every couple of strokes as Dean adjusted to the slight invasion. He had his whole index finger working its way as he curled it slightly towards Dean’s belly button, searching for the precious spot he knew he could elicit a response from.
“Claire was telling me earlier about how she used to build forts when she was younger,” Jack explained, setting down a pile of pillows in the war room and then moving a side table away to create an empty space. “It sounded like fun.”
If the world had gone still in the moment before, everything seemed to rush back into place as Dean realized what was happening, the graces cooling and burning on his skin once more as he kissed Cas back, the rough sensation of his chapped lips complementing the scratch of his stubble on Dean’s hand which was caressing his jawline ever so gently.
“Hell, yes.” Dean strained, his voice laced with need on the verge of a whine. “I’m ready, Cas, please.”
A sudden thought raced into Dean’s head which made him feel uncomfortable. “D-do you feel disconnected from us? Because we’re human and you’re…”
Dean broke their kiss, his eyes still closed as he pulled away slightly, taking in air before learning back in and kissing Cas’ neck and the scratch against his hand surprisingly pleasant as Cas tilted his head back, his eyes closed as he sunk down into the blankets, Dean moving so he was above him, planting gentle kisses one at a time onto this reverent creature giving himself so freely.
Dean pressed a kiss to his forehead and sat up, Cas resting his head on his thigh, still aware that neither of them had clothes on. He ran his hand through Cas’ hair in soft strokes, twisting his fingers gently around the ends that curled slightly from being unkempt.
Dean exhaled in a pant as Cas began to trail kisses down his neck, pressing wet and increasingly languid on small bits of skin without the harsh vigor of intent he’d desperately wished to apply in many a fantasy, but it was too early for the desire to tense the harshness of his intent.
Jack took a deep breath, looking at both Cas and Dean before nodding and crawling out of the tent, wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck suddenly, seeming to catch him off-guard. This only lasted a moment as Cas hugged him back, Dean watching as glimmers of grace dragged from the air and seemed to mold into the outline of wings around both of their backs, Cas’ enveloping Jack in a gentle embrace. “Goodnight, Jack.” Cas smiled at him.
It was fair to say he still wasn’t used to the novelty of mornings in the bunker or participating in the routine of eating and caffeinating - he hadn’t had to worry about feeding himself since he’d lost his grace after the Great Fall.
“What, do I look like I brought this for everyone?” Dean called out exasperated, as he turned back to Cas and Jack, who seemed to be using a similar angelic power to tack blankets in place to invisible beams he couldn’t see. A hint of energy seemed to glow around the various fabrics, swishing, and tingling as they manipulated it to hold and stay where they pleased. It was memorizing for Dean to watch, as he fumbled with a switch for battery-powered lights Jack had brought from somewhere.
“Look, as long as he stays off the leather seats in Baby, I don’t have a problem with him,” Dean said, holding his hand up in defense.
Dean tilted his head slightly as Cas deepened the kiss, Dean’s hand moving up into his hair, finding it soft and hinting at a couple of grey strands around his temples from the stress of age and life being
He saw a flush creep up Dean’s neck as Cas shivered slightly from the chill of the morning, despite the fact the kitchen was warm with family and the stove.
I was listening to Angel of The Morning by Juice Newton while I was writing this (as well as the steven universe instrumental soundtrack but that part isn't important) and I don't know how to imbed hyperlinks so if you want to play it in the background you can find it on Spotify and youtube - it's a really pretty song :)
He nodded to himself, satisfied the door had shut seamlessly, and backed away slowly, edging away from the room and feeling himself bump into something that let out a small yelp.
Inside the fort, he sat down, seeing it was big enough for about two people to lounge in comfortably as Jack hung up the fairy lights on more invisible grace-made edges that made the interior glow faintly, almost like magic. Light pieces of fabric that looked like tapestries he’d heard Jody’s girls gushing about the last time they’d come to visit softened and draped against the dull comforters and made the whole space feel warm and welcoming.
Dean opened his mouth, finding his throat dry and his words empty, before coughing and gathering a blanket into his hands. “We’re building a fort.” He said, pulling out a chair and grabbing a pillow from the pile Jack had made. “You can help if you want.”
“We’re all happy here,” Dean said, feeling Cas’ thumb brush back and forth across the back of his hand and an ache of adoration travel through him. “Things feel right.”
He promptly took Dean into his mouth, letting it slide down the back of his throat and feeling a rather unpleasant bump on his soft palette as he pulled back to ease the discomfort. Those feelings were quickly erased as Dean couldn’t hold back a soft moan, pulling at Cas’ hair.
His cheeks were thoroughly red and his bottom lip seemed to have small divots in them that had not been there previously. Cas realized he’d been biting down to avoid making noise. He smiled softly, leaning in and pressing a delicate kiss to Dean’s lips who kissed him back with more vigor, clearly awaiting.
“I don’t feel different from the rest of you,” Cas said slowly, “not anymore, at least. We took normal and turned it on its head in a way. Nothing we do can be defined by a certain guideline, in my opinion. I quite like how things are now.”
future, was something attainable now. A chance of normalcy, or as close as one could have in the lifetime of a hunter and former angel of the Lord, was possible.
Cas chuckled, unable to hold back while leaning in and pressing his lips to Dean’s, slowly sweeping his tongue across the hunter’s dry lips. He was humming with anticipation as Dean slowly drifted into consciousness and kissed him back, pulling Cas down against him and running his hands over the planes of his back, almost keening as Cas savored the minty taste of his mouth, teasing him in the worst ways with his tongue.
Dean gasped as Cas pressed against the spongy swollen muscle, rubbing it in small circles. “Fuck, Cas.”
Cas’ hand rubbed circles on Dean’s back, the sensation calming and loving as the lights flickered around them.
Dean nodded slightly, leaning back in to kiss him in their little secluded paradise. It was frozen and motion, humanity and grace, just
“Dean,” Cas breathed, looking down at him and cupping his cheek, moving in to place a deep kiss on his lips, savoring the way Dean’s hands traced up his neck and pulled him closer. “Are you sure?”
The nickname made Cas’ heart surge as he pushed past the first ring of muscle, letting out a slight moan as Dean mouthed his name. He was positive Dean was holding back out of fear Elieen and Sam would hear from across the hallway.
Dean chuckled, looking at the lights and grace and soft textures around them. “It’s just a fort, Cas.”
He nodded, pushing back his chair slightly, taking his plate and snatching the last piece of bacon of Dean’s before grabbing his plate. That earned his eyes sharp enough to shoot daggers from the hunter as he circled around the table, gathering everyone’s empty plates. “Just distracted for a moment,” he answered, nearly letting a couple of forks drop and clatter to the floor as he swerved around. “Sam, you, Eileen, and Jack cooked, Dean and I will clean up. Does anyone want to join me today on a grocery run before Jody and the girls come?”
He paused, meeting Cas’ gaze and wondering if his desires were like prayers to him. If Cas could hear his wants and read into his pining that he’d never truly been able to hide away.
“Okay!” Jack called from outside, his voice cheerful for no apparent reason in the early morning. “But Sam said to come and get you two. Breakfast is ready and he said former angels of the lord need to eat no matter what they may think.”
Dean frowned, dropping his discarded flannel pajama bottoms and moving to his drawer to pick out a pair of worn jeans. “You’re right,” he admitted, stepping into them after sliding the drawer shut and stepping into them. Cas’ heart seemed to tighten in his chest as he watched Dean pull them up to his hips and see how the denim framed his body in all the right places. They both seemed to be growing older with the passing years, but time had only been kind to his hunter, who in his opinion had only grown more handsome.
nice to look at. He shifted his gaze to Cas, whose hand rested on Jack’s shoulder as he stifled a yawn. Dean guessed that using his grace so intensely, even for menial tasks, would tire Jack to some extent.
“Claire and Patience showed me this website, Amazing, where you can order almost anything.” Jack smiled. “They’re pretty, aren’t they?”
“You know, Sam will be expecting us in about an hour,” Cas murmured. “If I’m awake, he’ll be up soon.”
Everyone agreed in various ways and began to serve themselves, Cas spilling a little orange juice as he poured the brightly colored drink. Jack stood almost immediately to grab some paper towels and assist, and Cas couldn’t help feeling a rush of pride wash over him.
Cas smiled, pressing his head to Dean’s chest as Dean’s arms wrapped around him again. “I promised I’d be here,” he told him. “I intend to keep my word.”
Sam would wake first and take a deep breath, stretching while sitting up, his covers falling to his waist (and he would never say it but most mornings he’d have to tug a comb through his tangled hair until it sat nearly). He would continue by crawling out of bed to start a pot of coffee for himself and his brother, pulling out a seat in the kitchen to scroll through his Twitter feed and catch up with politics and trends that he pretended were no concern of his.
“Cas!” Dean exclaimed, pressing his lips together as Cas left Dean’s cock untouched. He’d make him come by his own means. “Cas, I’m close.”
Cas grinned, grabbing another sponge to soap and wipe down the countertops. “Well I promise after Eileen and I get back from the store we’ll spend some time one-on-one before Jody and the girls come over? Will you help me with some of the gardening I have to do on the roof?”
Jack looked over from the stove where he was watching Sam cook, looking at what Cas was wearing with a critical stare. “It is,” he decided after a moment, reaching up to brush a curl of hair that had fallen in his eye from looking down at the pan. “But you’re cold.”
“As long as I don’t have to clean up all the blankets in the morning, I’ll do whatever you guys want. I was planning on sorting through some Tulpa archives in the library and seeing if this recent report in Missouri-”
Cas looked up at Dean, notching both of them were still naked under the covers. “Uh, one minute!” Dean called, watching the door intently. Cas certainly hadn’t locked it after coming back to sleep last night.
“You know as well as I do he’s already dressed,” Cas said, snuggling into the warmth of Dean’s spot, feeling a stubbornness rise at the notion of leaving their room. He was perfectly content to be here with Dean for the rest of the day, no matter how loudly his stomach may have been be protesting.
One was the bitter taste of halitosis, more commonly known as morning breath. He frowned, the taste unpleasant and unaccustomed as he realized he had a toothbrush in the bathroom at the end of the hallway.
He slid his fingers in and out of Dean, increasing his speed only after he was sure he had been worked enough that he wouldn’t cause him discomfort. Dean’s jaw hung open slightly as he breathed without much fluidity.
He turned around to see Eileen leaning against the wall of the bathroom, making him jump with surprise.
He couldn’t hold back a small laugh, shaking his head and opening the door to his room and letting it shut, feeling refreshed, but the familiar rush of tiredness coming back to him. It was only after his eyes adjusted to the dark that he saw Dean was now awake.
Dean nodded his head slightly, his breaths still deep, and Cas positive he was far from being truly awake.
than any of those previous experiences. He was brave and loyal and all the things Cas found himself wanting to replicate in his own life. He was considerate and loved deeply, even if he didn’t always show it. But Cas knew that he could, and Dean deserved to be loved with reckless abandon. He admired that Cas was aching to give him. Especially now, when such admiration could be from pleasure.
Dean’s eyes fluttered as he nearly attacked the spot with the head of his cock pushing against it every time.
The grace particles seemed to dance around them, almost rushing in response to Cas and what appeared to be his emotions as their speed picked up slightly, feeling like embers and snowflakes landing on Dean’s skin at the same time.
-We are talking about The Apocalypse. Lucifer walking the Earth, billions will die. You are our only hope.
A scream of pure agony passes through him, a sound that could only be heard in Hell, the pain in that scream made Castiel feel his vessel be filled with goosebumps. When he can finally find the source from where the sound came from, his hopes are drained, at the same time that he can’t understand what is happening.
Now he’s playing with a rattle in public, trying to distract Jack enough for him to calm down a little. Would demons still be afraid of him if they saw this?
The look of shame in Dean’s eyes was clear. Of course he didn’t think he deserve to be save. He was just a guy, he saved some people here and there, but he did a whole lot of terrible things too. He sold his soul to bring his brother back from the dead. Why would he be worthy of a second chance?
-I think you should try to deal with it when you go back. Your father’s actions and believes shouldn’t define you.
-Is like being a soldier. I have siblings, and each one of us have responsibilities, some of us supervise others. Ishim commanded me once, he’s a good friend, but something happened to him, something
-Man, Alastair just don’t get tired of messing with me, does he? I know you’re probably just some filth demon who’s Alastair’s little bitch and will do anything he tells you to do, but the joke is over, lemme get back to my job, ok? – With that, he turned his attention back to the soul, that started gasping again – But you were creative with the made up name, I’ll give you that.
Dean was fill with a feeling that could only be described as pure wrath. This is the Circle of Wrath, right? He remembered everything that happened in Violence and how John was the cause for more than half of it. Dean started to punch him, with everything he had inside of him.
-Oh you can suck it. – Even Dean was taken aback with this one. – You abandoned us, all of your children, then you abandoned all of your human creation, angels are going insane thinking that letting Lucifer out of the cage to start The Apocalypse is a good idea, billions will die, not to mention the billions that already have. You didn’t care to show up before, why would you care to show up now?
He wants and longs and needs to stay longer with Cas here, inside his arms, but that would be weird, right?
The mission was starting to get to Castiel’s mind, and body. It still fells awkward to be in a human vessel. Jimmy Novak stays quiet and dormant for most of the time, especially after Castiel told him they were going to Hell, humans can’t cope with this most of the time. On top of that, it has been a long time since the angel needed a vessel, but they figured angels entering Hell with theirs true forms would cause some talk among the demons.
It hurts like hell, and that’s something that different from most people, Dean can say in first hand. He’s been through enough to know that the pain from his soul can and will be way worse than physical pain, but this time… this time he can say that somehow everything he was feeling came in both instances, such profound pain in his very core that his whole body was aching. Huh, maybe a profound bond was the exact reason for profound pain at the end of the day.
Dean didn’t seem to figure it out, only wanting to be close to Cas, to feel the angel himself pull the human closer, kiss him deeper, like his life depended on it.
For the first time, Dean didn’t know if he was talking to the demon or to the image of his father, until he decided he was talking to both.
“So now you talk a lot, huh? Yeah, kid, Deenie is sad ‘cause Cas isn’t here and he was going to love this, he would love being your Dad, he would love you properly, in a way I don’t think I can. Deenie just need some time ‘cause Deenie misses Cas. That’s it. I also can’t start talking about myself in the third person, so why don’t you just go to sleep, huh?”
-I’m some sort of energy. Even though I don’t have a soul, what I’m made of can resemble a human soul, but bigger. And wings, you don’t have wings.
-No, it is not. Dean, even with those scars, your soul is one of the purest ones I have ever seen. Its light and colors make it very clear how much love and devotion you have. It is almost as a book where I can read you. All the caring, selfless things you have done. They are all there, in your soul.
Here it is, guys. The last chapter of the story. I will post the epilogue right away. I hope you enjoyed, and hey, maybe this will be part of someone's head canon as part of the show.
“Well, that might just be wishful thinking. He did all that because he loves. Simple like that, he loves Earth, humanity, and family. And he loved you, Jack. I didn’t understand and I still can’t fully comprehend, but he loved you, and believed in you, so… I’m here. I’m gonna stay here until you don’t need me anymore. You’re a Nephilim, so I’m betting you’re pretty powerful, you won’t need two human, broken, getting kinda old, hunters to take care of you. And then I can rest. You’re my last mission, Jack. Cas said ‘paradise on Earth’ is what you can do, so I’m gonna take care of you for him, and then I’m gonna rest.” Dean can’t remember when was the last time he cried this hard, sobbing all the way through his monologue to the baby asleep in front of him, something he just now realizes. He drops the children’s storybook he tried to use to make Jack sleep, using his now free hand to wipe some of the tears, but they keep coming.
It didn’t take Jack too long to curl himself in Dean’s arms, but every little attempt Dean makes to put him in his crib, Jack grabs his shirt and starts crying again.
Dean could feel everything all over again in his body, and he didn’t what to fight back. He was tired. He didn’t want to remember this. He also didn’t want to remember all the times John got drunk and remembered that and all the horrible things and actions would happen again. He thought about given up on a hunt several times after this, making it easy for the monsters to kill him. Maybe he still had a chance of redemption. But if his father were right, he would go to Hell and he didn’t want to risk it. He was already in hell, but if he was alive, at least he could save some people and of course, take care of Sammy.
Dean on the other hand, feels like the worst possibility have become true. So that’s how his soul look like?
“Stupid question, got it. Look, I haven’t got laid in months, babysit for one night man, it's not that hard.”
Dean didn’t know what to say. Seriously. What the fuck was he supposed to say? He wasn’t happy about it, but Cas
bad, or unworthy. This is your father still inside of your head. You are capable of caring, of love, of affection, and you deserve them as well.
The thing is: That was one of the most sublime moments of Dean’s life, that’s for sure, but now he was freaking out. What in the hell (literally) was he thinking!? Kiss an
He has favorite songs and stories now, he stays awake when Dean tells him about Cas, something only them can know Dean does. His favorite cartoon seems to be Scooby-Doo and that puts a smile on Dean’s face. ‘I told you he was smart enough’. The smile always fades away when Sam says the kid is growing his way into Dean’s heart. He doesn’t feel like he can let anyone else make a home in his heart because he’s tired of losing people who are dumb enough to do it.
“Dean…” Devotion. Cas always says his name with a touch of devotion, like every time Dean says something is his fault, every time Dean puts himself down, Cas has this particular tone of utter devotion, like Dean is committing blasphemy, like Dean himself is something sacred in Cas’ head. But he’s not. And Cas has to know this, even if is the last thing Dean does, because Dean doesn’t deserve to have such a heavenly being devote himself to him when he’s the cause of his death.
“Of course.” She also has a nice smile… Delicate, genuine, soft. “So, where’s this really cute baby’s Mommy?”
-Oh really? Are you that naïve? The angels are going to use you and let you die to go back to where you were, where you belong, in Hell, torturing souls, forever.
-What else can you tell me? Those Circles, they are what? Rooms? We just have to walk through the doors?
Dean’s response surprised both of them. Yes, when he thinks about it he still feels weird, he still remembers how John taught him in many different ways that it was wrong, he still knows he’s messed up and that he will have a lot of problems dealing with it. The thing is, when he was with Cas, he didn’t think about that. He didn’t think of anything other than
“It’s okay, Jack. C’mon.” It was like a mirror from this morning, Jack almost jumping into his arms, but Dean couldn’t help noticing Cas’ face. “Cas, I don’t think it’s personal, he’s just used to me doing it.”
Dean, the moment you tortured a soul in Hell, the first seal broke. They have 65 seals to go. And we need to stop it.
Cas didn’t know quite how to explain it. But Dean seemed interested in whatever he decided to say. And the memory of him
-You know, in moments like this I would expect my boyfriend to be serious. Of course, that’s stupid of me to assume, since my boyfriend is you. – Dean was half trying to stop a laugh, half unable to control his smile. – What?
But now Cas is dead and Dean doesn’t even know if he said ‘I love you’ loud enough in his prayer. Dean doesn’t know if Cas heard him. This is wrong.
Now all the way out, looking around, he could see a circle of dead trees. He needed to figured out where he was, how to find Sammy and Bobby, and most of all,
“I’m sorry I can only see you as a mission, kid, I truly am. But everything about you, reminds me of him and I- I can’t. He was my family, and my best friend, and I always thought he was gonna be here. Not here in the Bunker, he never stayed for more than a couple of weeks here, I guess is hard to stay in one place when you’re God-knows-how-old and you used to fly and observe the whole world, damn, the whole Universe. Or when your best friend kick you out and can’t ever find the right way to say he’s sorry… God, I’m so stupid… But still, guess I always thought he would be by my side. I miss him so much… Even the moments we would stay silent for hours, just being there for each other, or when I was drinking and he would be there with me, slowly taking small sips of the beer he
Sam does, Dean is not looking at him but he knows his brother is relived to be able to do it, missing his friend and wanting to believe that that’s in fact him but scared of being wrong and do the wrong move, probably piss Dean of. Yeah, Dean doesn’t have to look but he knows it anyways.
He can still smell the alternative universe, he can feel how cold it was, he can remember Sam pulling him out, he can feel his whole body putting up a fight just like it did in that moment, his mind going ‘save Cas, save Cas, save Cas’. He can still see the light of Cas’s grace getting out of his body. He remembers his knees being extremely sore but all he could do was stay there, right by Cas’s side, begging for Chuck to bring him back even then, even just inside of his head.
not me, at least not until I try to interfere. You will fight and I will be close enough to collect that piece of your soul inside of the Custosanimaer.
-Yeah, why you didn’t try that earlier? You know, when I had to face every moment of violence in my life.
“Sammy, we have been through this, how did you mess up the diapers again? You learned this like, weeks ago.”
-Go where? – Somehow, Dean still had hope. It was just a little, almost dying spot of light inside of him, but he clung himself in that hope – It’s Hell, there’s no way out of here.
-We don’t know, we think so. She lost her grace, and we couldn’t find her on Earth, so that is probably what happened. I miss her, though.
stop it. There’s no real choice here. - Chuck snapped his fingers, and two more people, creatures, were with them. –Naomi here will take Castiel to Heaven and will clean his head; new memories will be in that little angelic brain by the time you meet again on Earth. As for you, Dean, Lilith will take you back and when you get to Alastair, your memories will already be changed.
Dean let go of Cas’s arm and did just what he wanted, what he needed to do for so long. John’s face was almost unrecognizable after a while, Dean’s hand was red with blood. His soul had an awkward configuration, with gold and green fighting against black and red.
-Dean, I don’t own “a cloud” – Seeing Cas using his fingers to say that warmed Dean’s heart and put a beautiful smile on his face, that’s for sure. - I don’t think I can return to Heaven at all.
-Actually, almost nine years in the last part, it will take us what will feel to you one year to get out of here. That is the closest conversion for human perception of time I can give to you.
“How? You’re with him for less than five minutes and he’s quiet. What do you do?” Sam came back with Jack’s yellow blanket with bees all over it, and some fluff green onesie. God, Cas would’ve loved this.
“That’s your business, not mine, just make your boyfriend stop calling my bar, the guy’s determined.”
“Dean. I’m here now. I’m not going anywhere. Lucifer is not here. You don’t need to keep having this nightmare.”
The weird little guy says that like it was easy, like Dean have done this a thousand times. Maybe he has.
Something cold washed through Dean. Of course he would want Jack right away. He choose Jack before, didn’t he? They haven’t talk for even five minutes and he doesn’t care, he’s just here for Jack. Of course. Stupid of him to think otherwise.
He could feel all of that at once. Then it became worst. The first time he killed someone, when he was just twelve years old. That made Dean fall to his knees. He didn’t want to, but John made him, he said it was to protect them, that it was the right thing to do, and he did, like a good soldier, even when everything inside of him told him it was wrong.
When they entered Circle 5, it happened faster than the others Circles did. Cas was right, this was going to look like Violence, cause Dean could see John Winchester standing right in front of him.
Dean was caught by surprise since he was so deep in his thoughts. The angel hide the hunter’s soul again, but that didn’t change the struggle on his face.
