! Of course he is not the boy’s father! Look at the turn-ups on his jeans.”
Sherlock purrs.
At four in the morning, he gets a text.
“You’re welcome.”
“Who’s Redbeard?” John blocks his nose with his forefinger and thumb.
Without bothering to investigate the very promising crime scene, Sherlock goes home and starts to write a list.
He smiles and glances up at Sherlock, who is staring ahead, eyes distant and glassy.
If nothing, his little escape would make him look better in the eyes of the younger Holmes and allow himself the peace of mind that after he left for Cornwall someone would know where he had disappeared.
Sherlock watches John tap his finger against the chair, bite his lip and ponder for a moment before he clears his throat and leans forward, placing his elbows on his knees.
So much for the dreams of proving himself again, then.
He walked to the desk, making sure not to even glance towards the fireplace, and sat down in one of the chairs facing the older Holmes, who at the moment looked both mildly surprised as well as ecstatic by his actions. His brother, when he joined them to sit by John’s right after a moment’s silence, looked only immensely irritated and sat like a petulant child with his arms crossed over his chest, slouching in his chair with his gangly legs spread out in front of him.
“You sure about that?” he smirks.
“Pick a shape. An animal, anything you like.” Sherlock moves his free hand to John’s hip.
John looks surprised.
“I suppose that would be convenient, taken that the main asset is a sort of machine himself.”
It’s still too early.
But then there were times he didn’t even have to try and just went by instinct. Like the one time they happened to arrive home at the same time, and John saw Sherlock from across the street, taking an old woman by the arm and helping her cross the busy street.
John lowers the hand to his chest.
John taps him on the head with the wooden spoon lying in a pot waiting for a sauce to be stirred.
John, the cashier and everyone else around them went silent.
“Lestrade is getting impatient,” John sneaks a peek at the Detective Inspector who is clearly still over the moon for what is happening between the two of them, but would still like Sherlock to “detach himself from John and get his arse over here to look at the not-so-attractive but oh-so-important stiff so we can all go home!”
Mrs Holmes, having decided that eating alone was bad for one’s health and that the gloomy winter nights were passed more comfortably in company, had asked offhandedly who she should invite for supper now that no one was in town, the MacKellies visiting their son in Scotland, the Robertson’s bound indoors by the influenza, and Mrs Morris in her infinite and senile wisdom having deemed public events a personal offence against herself until spring.
“So no casualties?”
Come New Year, instead of the music papers, Sherlock is staring at John’s blog count that has been stuck at 1895 for weeks.
He looked at them and felt ashamed.
“Take care, and let me hear from yourself now and then.”
Sherlock takes the offered spoon to his right hand and the pot to the other, pointedly opens the lid with a flip, dugs the spoon in and puts it in his mouth. He makes a loud
John has mouth full of curly hair. Nothing compared to ear full of tongue tracing the whorls and whispering obscenities involving the bed clothes in somewhere far more comfortable than hardwood floor as well as a whipping sound emitted by something more leathery than the cottony white sheets.
So he gives John reasons, harsh words for why he is standing on the ledge, and John gives him hope, and he smiles.
“Do you remember Paris?”
John giggles.
“Am I expected?” Sherlock asked, sounding defeated.
His back bristles.
“Oh, fuck you, Sherlock!”
It’s his defence mechanism and Sherlock knows it. And he is infinitely grateful.
Behind them in the kitchen, the minute hand on the clock ticks its final minute, and suddenly Sherlock is thirty years old, a new decade of his life has begun, and he is engaged to the boy he has known for twenty-five years will teach him what love means.
“I want to watch cartoons.”
“Why?”
“She is right,” he says to it. “You shouldn’t be here.”
“There is this thing I promised Lestrade I would go to. An auction. Big thing, apparently. Chief Superintendent and some other idiots will be there as well, and Lestrade insists I show my face. Threatened to cut me off the cases for a month if I didn’t. Formal affair. Requires a tux and a bowtie. Tedious. I have to be
He admires the steel-like shell, the fast-moving legs, the overall beauty of the rarity he is holding. He smiles up at John, whose mouth also spreads into a wide grin.
John rolls his eyes and sits down on the coffee table. Mycroft gets up to hand him the folder Sherlock has already refused. He tells about the case, about government official Andrew West and a memory stick full of official missile plans, but Sherlock is not listening. Instead he inspects John from the corner of his eye, pretends to concentrate on his violin, looks at John’s mouth move and make a joke (at which he snorts and smiles).
like Victor.”
Sherlock strokes his cheek.
And when he finally closed his eyes, he dreamt of that blessed calm breathing, but in his dreams it stopped.
“Oh dear,” Mrs Hudson comments from her doorway.
good that would make John unaware of his actions for a while.
The damage is still in the soul and can’t be reached through Sherlock’s skin.
who shortens her name because she hates the feminine sound of her given name) and that he (she) had a long-term relationship, got at least a phone out of it but gave it to John because after leaving his (her) wife seeing the gadget became unbearable.
He glances up when John walks back into the room.
No one really cares.
The prey was gone. A wild beast opened its maw, rows of gleaming teeth flashed and a scarlet tongue stuck out in a hiss.
amount of national pride after what happened to Vic---“
“You sound like the mission should be overlooked by a machine.”
“As you now have suffered through one of my brother’s delightful deductions, Doctor Watson, I believe the Rubicon has been crossed and you can either continue towards the point of no return or turn around and close the door behind yourself.”
But John does not reach for the Sig. His hand goes to Sherlock’s left, allowing his right to stay on the gun, and raises the hand to his face.
“You really think I care about that?” he asked. “You really think so little of me? That I would judge someone because of who they love?”
She’s taken off guard, stuttering.
Well, that ship has sailed, thinks John, after checking a few of the closer yarders' Facebook pages where the pictures of a consulting detective flying head first into the cold water has several thumb ups and even more comments.
Right then, the door to Doctor Mortimer’s office opens without preamble and they both turn to look.
John stares at her, his eyes growing misty.
“Sherlock,” John breathes through his mouth, “please take that thing as far away from the house as possible.”
Sherlock is still stuttering broken sounds when John places his lips on his, a little more than a peck, mouth closed. But it lasts long, though Sherlock has forgotten how to calculate seconds and minutes. Could be a whole week he has been kissing John when they finally pull apart.
Hair grows back and wounds heal, the ones of the soul perhaps slower than those of the body but they still do. Sherlock’s soft curls have long been in need of a good cut, and on a Tuesday he comes home with every strand in order, smelling strongly of rose water John knows his hairdresser ladles in after every trim.
His nose hurt.
“Forgive me.”
Sherlock sleeps for three days. John sleeps, eats and keeps watch in the same bed, only straying into the kitchen and to the bathroom. He has sent texts to Mrs Hudson, Molly, Lestrade and Mycroft (though the last one feels redundant since Mycroft probably has seen everything on the CCTV cameras already) and asked them not to come round or call before he does. He knows he has to be the only one there when Sherlock wakes up.
“Why not?”
So he buried his aching nose into the pillow as gently as he could, looking blearily at John who took a chair, his rifle and the Enfield and sat down so that he was able to see all the windows and doors. He did not spare another glance at Sherlock but took his position as the watch dog without a word, completely invested in keeping both of them alive. Sherlock could feel Victor hovering close by, silent, respecting the circumstances for once.
“Jesus,” John breathes.
He thinks he sounds like he is crying for mercy with the one phrase he alwaystries so hard to avoid.
“That was years ago! Why would she still be upset?” Sherlock exclaims, throwing his hands in the air.
“I... appreciate your concern and am grateful that you took care of me in my hour of need.”
“I dreamt I was shipped straight to Duckburg and dating Daisy Duck.”
Mostly applied to lovers who kill themselves because they can’t be with the person they love. To be united in death. Their love consummated in eternal sleep.
Sherlock startles at the offered t-shirt and crouches away from the pyjama pants. He falls on the bed, his limbs like rubber, movements soft and slow like he is made of toffee. John tries to pry the beddings loose under him and gets a handful of duvet.
Surprise coloured Mr Trevor’s face.
“The old lady running the bar downstairs. Made us drink so much wine.”
He turns around to look at Sherlock who has sat up and is inspecting the wound. It’s superficial, just a graze, but will need stitches and will probably scar.
(He wants to remember this.)
He hits the pavement and waits.
On Christmas Eve, Sherlock fell through the ice.
But John asks it constantly. Just like with his praises, he has used every possible way in the English language to check how he is doing, how he is
He wondered when he had begun to think about him by his first name.
“Just extra minutes to delete. 187,” Sherlock turns back to the tree, inspects the bark, scratches it again with his finger.
“The heart is usually the last to go, all those emotions brought to surface, love, loss, suffering. Delicious noises beaten out of a husband when you torture his wife and children. Juicy, juicy sobs when you cut their throats. It will be even more interesting with you, Sherlock, since your heart is in a special place. It will be interesting to see if you’ll bleed as well when I stick a screwdriver into John Watson’s pancreas.”
It’s a sign John is not grieving anymore.
John doesn’t seem to notice, for he only looks exasperated that Sherlock has once more invited himself on his date.
He gestures at the board. The silence around them persists. Wilkes’ cigarette has burnt out but he hasn’t noticed it. The girl by his elbow sips her drink, eyes moving rapidly between Sherlock and Victor who moves his knight, taking Sherlock’s pawn.
When John finally packs his bags at the clinic and takes the tube to Camden, he is over half an hour late and sweaty from running to get to the address Sherlock has texted him. He has texted him himself several times in turn, but has received no answer and if he didn’t know Lestrade was there he would be extremely worried. But the smile on the DI’s face when John finally huffs to a halt next to him on the road promises something good and Lestrade only raises his finger to his lips and points towards the house.
Until he realises the sheet is see-through.
“John ---“
Oh, Sherlock is going to use this trick to his advantage again later. He is going to shrink all of John’s shirts down two sizes, make John get stuff for him from the highest shelf and steal glances at his stomach and back.
“John, I am a ridiculous man,” he begins.
Sherlock reaches up to kiss his lips and then sits down next to him with a soft grunt. John’s hand goes to his knees to rub the bones soothingly. Moving up towards his thigh, his hand touches a soft bulge in Sherlock’s trouser pocket. He can see the white of the familiar handkerchief peeking out from it.
“What should I say?”
“Loving parents, annoying older brother, went to all the right schools, never missed a meal at home. I’m as regular as they come.”
When Lestrade opened the cell door four hours later, John was asleep once again with his head buried in Sherlock’s lap and Sherlock’s fingers combing gently through his hair.
He goes back into case mode in the taxi, gets out round the corner to the Adler residence and asks John to punch him in the face.
“You will have no feeling in your precious feet soon if you keep showing them under me.”
“No,” John replied, worry colouring his voice. “Are you?”
He hissed at the nurse who was trying to approach John’s bedside carefully, quite impeccably imitating a black viper trying to scare off a possible threat.
Another bump shook the car and Sherlock jerked upright.
When John emerges from the steamy bathroom, skin red and raw, Sherlock is waiting for him under the covers. There is no sighing or frowning, screaming, questions, not even a raised eyebrow. John just climbs in and grasps Sherlock’s wrist with his fingers before falling asleep. For a second Sherlock thinks this an attempt to seek comfort, like a child holding the hand of a grown-up in a strange place.
He moves his hand to his other side, strokes over his stomach and hips, twirls around in front of the mirror, looking for any blemishes on his skin.
going to your death, Doctor Watson,” he ensured John.
John looks annoyed and deflated but follows anyway.
“Sherlock! That’s evidence!”
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders and downed another large gulp.
“Well, I better be off,” he rubs his arm.
John turns his head to look at him.
“Nnnno,” Sherlock stretches the consonant.
John will want tea. And toast. Possibly juice. And eggs.
“Well, we all do silly things,” she giggles.
“At all?”
By dropping his favourite reptile on the floor as he was cleaning the table.
Sherlock looked at him, his coffee still warm but forgotten in his hands. He watched John swim, realising suddenly that last night had been the first time he had called him by his first name.
“Yes, we
It was actually quite beautiful outside. At this time of the day, the sun shone through the leaves, painting everything in gold. Finches flew singing over their heads and settled on a nearby rowan tree to groom their feathers. A crow sat on the top branch, staring at them with its beady eyes. When Sherlock looked up, it let out a raspy caw.
“Yes, I did,” his brother replied, taking back the folder which had stayed untouched on the table, “but our mother raised me better than to just order my baby brother to do as I want without explaining his options to him.”
John looks positively wolfish.
Sherlock lay down on the floor for a second and jumped back up. His voice was like a flight attendant’s giving the emergency demonstration before the plane took off.
(See the end of the chapter for
The grin widens.
He went to the door, took his coat from the stand and pulled it on.
“And am I also to assume that measures will be taken if I say no?”
He didn’t find it amusing a bit later when he opened the fridge door and couldn’t find the liver.
Fingers like ice wrapped around his bicep.
The look on John’s face almost goes unnoticed, but Sherlock is on a roll here and just then Miranda emerges from the ladies and Sherlock pounces at her.
Sadly, the man is already deceased.
“Only Alicia. Just a sec.”
there.”
, but of John and how to make it up to him.
They both look at it at the same time, then back to each other before they both scrabble to grab it. Sherlock beats John to it, snatches up the phone and reads the text.
They have the strawberries for dessert. Sprinkled with sugar and whipped cream. Sherlock eats until he feels the seam of his trousers cannot stretch any more without bursting. John takes the last swig from his beer and goes to make tea.
“Everyone, and I mean everyone, will be after my arse if it comes out that this happened on the job,” Jim says.
He would not be pitied.
Like Mycroft still holds him near and dear, keeps his love for him behind lock and key inside his heart.
“Sherlock!” John bellows, snapping him out of the manic rant. John pulls the shirts he is holding from his grip and throws them on the bed. He takes Sherlock’s face in his hands and speaks calmly.
“What’s my diagnosis? Will I live to see my hand dry again at least?”
Sherlock turns to him, hand still on his side.
“I have made it all go away.”
“Come on then, love,” the woman said and took the boy’s hand again. Walking along with his mother, the boy kept staring behind himself. Sherlock raised his hand to a small wave and slowly, shyly the boy waved back. His mother saw that he was not paying full attention to the cans of spaghetti and turned to look as well.
Fine, then.
Sherlock snatches an edge and places it on his side of the blanket where he has been building the upper half of Van Gogh’s self-portrait.
– was still standing by the fireplace, now leaning against it leisurely, his eyes the exact opposite of his brother’s cold and blue stare which, like his voice, was like an icicle.
John sighs dramatically.
John smiled.
The blind trust John places in him is almost as difficult to believe as his own trust towards John. People don’t usually trust him. Lestrade finds him useful and believes in him, but Sherlock doesn’t think he trusts him. Mrs Hudson would probably trust him with her life but not with the life of her pet canary.
Instead of John’s hurried footsteps, it’s Donovan’s angry huff and a dead silence from the rest that follows Sherlock outside.
) that could be found from an aisle in their neighbourhood Tesco.
The hat that should be warming Watson’s head.
, dear, beloved, sweetheart. The second syllable:
Everyone around them freezes. Sherlock looks distraught, confused at the tears in John’s eyes.
When no case is in sight, they visit Bart’s regularly. On a Monday, Molly has tied her hair up in a new way and is wearing a silk scarf round her neck.
Sherlock inspects him from his spot at the kitchen table. John is sitting with his back to him so he can’t see Sherlock’s stare.
“It is
He had the German soldier’s rifle slung over his shoulder.
. Like he is a child again, scared to death of the monsters under his bed.
They were alone.
”Not good, Sherlock,” he says and walks out after her.
Safe opens, the gun inside goes off and kills one of the henchmen which gives them the benefit of surprise and Sherlock takes everything out on the American who ordered John’s brains to be blown out.
Mr Hartley coughed quietly, and suddenly he looked very much like he would like to be anywhere else.
Mr Trevor was in front of him in few quick strides. He reached out his hands to help him with his coat.
“You have to eat regularly, so you can take the pills.”
He realises he is begging. Might as well. He has already hit bottom.
Mycroft arrives on the next flight, leaves his governmental duties and takes the chance of the ruse being discovered in order to let his brother cry against his stark white shirt.
“Don’t be alarmed,” Mycroft says gently. “It’s to do with sex.”
“No, this time it actually was an accident.”
The curtains aren’t drawn.
She lets out a laugh.
He is back an hour later, arms full of shopping bags.
“Ah, I see.”
Outside, Mycroft offers him a cigarette in celebration of Christmas but really he only wants to soften Sherlock to make him tell him how he knew they would find her like that. He does not tell about the phone in his pocket, mentions it as an unnamed object and turns away.
“You are degenerating, Sherlock,” Mycroft says.
John felt like he had been following a very fast-paced tennis match. His head swam with all the information. With each delivered retort, the brothers had seemed to become more ready to fly to each other’s throats though neither had moved an inch.
Sherlock knows other people watch John, too. He thinks it’s only good, there are too many ways to end the pain he clearly is in, too many temptations to resist, so many feelings for just one man. Best to share it.
equal. Since you could never beat me if we were just using our brains. You people always rely on physical force.”
He had laughed.
“Those are the kind of banalities anyone is capable of.”
“She is a lovely woman. My mother adores her. It is too bad one of us isn’t a girl. They would make sure we were married by summer.”
Sherlock stood outside, frantically sucking on a cigarette, the tortured sound of burning paper wheezing in his ears.
“John, please, get it off!”
DI Lestrade, who had sensed the tension between them the moment he had brought Sherlock in, had wisely stepped out moments earlier. He knew, of course. No sensible police officer would even consider attaching a civilian to his cases if they didn't know everything about their history. Sherlock’s colourful one had been forgiven mainly based on his own prowess as a calculating machine, partly thanks to Mycroft whose ability to appear where he wasn't needed had finally proven useful when he had walked in and given his personal guarantee that Sherlock would not now or ever again fall victim to any illegal substances.
Arriving to the right door, he merely left John with a firm handshake and a small smile before turning and walking back to the direction they had come from. Unsure whether he should just go in or wait to be called, John took his chances and knocked.
“What an idiot I must have been to think that you would.”
“Of course there is! I lived with him in university - “
“Why do you think he named you Raven?” John asked suddenly.
“At him. He never replies.”
He looks at Molly, and suddenly it’s like staring into a mirror. She looks exactly like he feels every time John is angry, tired, going out of the door with a bang.
Lestrade watches John. At first, he does not invite him to crime scenes because he is afraid it might bring back memories and make John break down in front of all the people that still believe Sherlock was a fraud. Then Lestrade decides it does no one any good to treat John like a fragile flower and arranges with the chief for John to come to the crime scenes legally to give his medical opinion and takes him to a pub afterwards.
He tastes like Turkish delight.
That night, he inspects John as he moves around the flat until he walks past him to go to the fridge. When he goes back to the mug of tea waiting on the table, he glances at Sherlock who has turned his eyes to the microscope to make sure John does not see him stare.
“John ---“
He tries to focus his gaze.
Suddenly John realised why he looked like he did not fit in the room. It was not the wild mess of curls that stuck up everywhere and fell over his forehead. Even with his hair slicked back like his brother’s, he would still have been an unfitting addition to the premises.
“Tell him why we have to go. Surely the man deserves it if he is to go to his death.”
Looking back on it, he had been a spoiled child. Pampered by his mother and excused from all punishment by his more than absent father. He had loved it from the first, the silence of the house and the secretiveness of the women when they were left alone in it, his mother and her devoted maids free to do as they pleased, without having to be constantly on their guard for men, to stand up when they came in and only to sit down when they did.
“No John. I said ‘very well’. I can swim, of course, only not perfectly.”
Murray stood up.
Sherlock fiddled with his equipment, sweat dripping down his forehead and nose. He watched John walk to the faucet and throw water on his face.
“All right?
“Noises from the forest, possible enemy contact. Estimated range quarter of a mile. Inform Falconer. Over.”
She glances at him briefly when she sees him move uncomfortably from the corner of her eye.
There was a kindness lurking behind Sherlock’s cool demeanour which at times melted the coldness in his grey eyes and made them glow golden.
Warning signs blaze inside his head.
Mr Hartley sighed.
John turned once again to look at the younger Holmes.
They look at each other in silence until the girl opens her mouth.
“All lives end, all hearts are broken.” He turns to his brother. “Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. It will make some things harder and more painful, but also easier to bear afterwards.”
Mycroft looks up.
John deflated.
“But you are our best hope as well, not only our last. We only came to you now because we didn’t know of your existence. Obviously, my employer went through army records of those who are still actively involved but when our contact informed us about you, my employer literally threw all the other files on the floor. Believe me, sir, I was there. I saw it.”
He stood up quickly, quietly, startling Sherlock out from his reverie, almost making him drop the book to the floor. He opened his mouth, face set into a frown.
“When did we agree that?”
Then he saw John.
“I have to call Ella,” he says quietly.
“No, it wasn’t. At least I hope not,” John chuckles.
The lighter clicked and a small flame appeared
Sherlock takes another stuttering breath.
Mrs Hudson watches John. She lets him stay at Baker Street for as long as she can afford. John does not accept the monthly contributions from Mycroft but always sends them back untouched. In the end, she doesn’t have to ask him to leave. He breaks the news himself and comforts her for going away, hugging her and promising to visit often. He does, and they never speak of Sherlock.
Panzer Division informing Berlin that Case Anton had been successive and France was now occupied.
“I... I needed to hear it. I needed to know that someone could actually be my friend. Someone… real.”
He jumps up to run to his laptop and posts a message on his website for the bomber to see.
John tries to keep Sherlock’s brain occupied and suggests reading, which Sherlock accepts with minimum persuasion, but only if John reads out loud to him. This is established when the first page of
Sherlock wakes with a strange feeling that he has grown several extra limbs during the night. Pair of legs have wrapped themselves around his, and he feels like he is being smothered by an octopus. The ache and the smugness flaming in his stomach remind him of something from the past, something intimate, wonderful.
Everyone tells Sherlock calmly that rules are rules and that he cannot sneak in when he likes. After the fifth time the nurse finds Sherlock in John’s bed, they decide bending the rules a little never hurt anyone and arrange a bed next to John’s for Sherlock to sleep in.
Sherlock contemplates what could be so grave and life-changing John would walk out of the door once and for all. When John turns to look at him again and only smiles, doesn’t flinch under the continuing scrutiny, he hopes dearly there is nothing that will take that smile away from him.
“Are you all right?” he asked kneeling down.
“Who?” John asks.
A hand snatches at him from the corner and he yelps as he is pulled against a trembling body.
“I’m not kissing you with that mouth,” John pulls back. ”You smell of Glenfiddich and raw liver.”
“No, I... I don’t need them.”
He steps back slightly to give John space but when John turns round, face full of wonder and smiling like a child at Christmas, he envelopes John in his arms.
Sherlock snorts.
The job (or the lack thereof) becomes relevant the same afternoon Sherlock learns that John does not like him borrowing his laptop.
Something of the soldier in John came out when he handled a gun, but it stayed hidden as well, lying lurking under his civilian clothing and his slagging posture, indicating that this was a job he enjoyed and performed only to make sure that in any eventuality he would be ready.
He looked nothing like what Sherlock had grown used to, the picture of an ordinary Englishman on his way home to his wife.
“James Moriarty! Is he paying you to have me tied up, huh? Just wait until I get my hands on you, you ---”
Mrs Holmes having disappeared to her room to have her afternoon nap, Sherlock and Mycroft were left alone in the sitting room to mind the fire, chessboard in front of them, a glass of whiskey resting on both of their armrests.
Sherlock himself is soon becoming The Third Most Annoying Thing To Wake Up To At Three O’ Eight In The Morning for John.
There’s a very sad, sickness filled smile on Sherlock’s mouth now that he has been given the chance to dwell in his childhood.
In the early hours of a Wednesday, they sat at the table, John polishing his guns again. After a week of silence, he took any kind of measly task as a way to pass the time and not go insane while waiting for something to happen. The radio hissed quietly in the background, snippets about a battle having taken place in El Alamein making John stop his polishing for a moment before continuing with the task.
“I’ll get you a new one,” he promises.
“One of many,” Mycroft answered quietly.
She takes a folder from in front of her and hands it to John.
I. Did a thesis. And am now a Master of Arts. But since last September my brain has been focused only on translating gendered pronouns and other such things which, while very interesting, have taken me away from other writing. And after graduation the stress of job-hunting and money and such shit have occupied my head. Let us hope that now that I am free from my thesis (though still don't have a job or money and am very stressed out about that) writing the next chapter won't take me almost a year.
He runs outside in his shirt sleeves, goes to the butcher’s who owes him a favour, chooses one of the fattest sows hanging from the ceiling and begins to stab it with a harpoon, naming every internal organ he hits. In Latin and in Greek.
John would do as his mother had done, sit by him and be ready to save him from any horrors that might threaten him. He took him by the elbow and led him to his bed. It was too short for him and his feet were dangling over the end, but the mattress was firm and smelt of John, like the fur hat he had stored away months ago but would wear again in a few months.
The sitting room is cosy and warm, the windows open to the hot summer afternoon. But the table is a mess, full of papers and books, pens and Sherlock’s old magnifying glass, his laptop on top of it all.
“And you seem to think that what makes a perfect partner is only smoking like a small chimney, drinking like a sponge at your parents wedding party and taking only two years tostart writing a note on the lid of the Tupperware if it happens to contain cut-off fingers ---“
She has broken into their flat at some point to leave it there and he has not noticed. What has he been so distracted with? The smells of Christmas covering her smell, the dim lights of the tree making everything darker.
“Come in, Mrs Hudson. Never mind the cocoon. He is in one of his moods.”
A moment later, they could hear Lestrade’s voice calling out nearer and nearer, eventually right next to them in the room. Sherlock, instead of making their presence known by raising his voice, banged gently on the side of the crate, his other hand still lodged in John’s hair.
“I’ll buy you a pair,” John promises. “Mine won’t fit you. We don’t want you arrested for public indecency when the trunks float away in the middle of a lap.”
Cursing, begging, praying inside his head (
“They’re people as well.”
The first time he goes to a crime scene after Lestrade has officially taken him back, Anderson begins to talk loudly about what a
The boy turned a page, glancing up long enough to see who was standing next to him.
And now he knows how horrible it feels. Living your life in love with someone without them knowing it.
“Yes, I’m fine, Sherlock…”
The way he says his name makes Sherlock’s breath stutter. The first syllable: like
“John, what should I do?”
“Watching you cook.”
Victor slipped closer, his fingers reaching out to touch Sherlock’s palm.
The scorn finally vanishes and is replaced by surprise.
He leaned in so that his nose almost touched Sherlock’s.
“You are
And he barely buys any food for his old flat anymore, but brings in the shopping to Baker Street every day after work.
, after mother died. You shipped me off to university as soon as it was convenient for you to pay any attention to my life. You never let me grieve. Always, ‘Stop behaving like that.’, ‘Don’t do that.’, ‘Don’t be an idiot.’”
Sherlock put his hand in his pocket and drew out his magnifying glass. Winking again, he handed it to the boy who took it after a moment, clearly not believing what was happening. The glass gleamed on his palm (
It was not the soldier in John, this sudden change in his mood. It was something more savage, more personal, not something a reasonable serving member of king and country would take to the battlefield.
“God, you look
“And here’s someone you haven’t met yet!” Lestrade raises his voice as a man with neatly trimmed light hair and dressed in the blue forensics suit Sherlock despises appears at the top of the stairs and waves at Lestrade.
Jim hits the breaks and the car screeches to a halt.
“Sorry?”
“Did I really leave such a fleeting expression? Not boyfriend material? But then again, that was rather the point.”
“But you are not just a soldier,” the voice continued. “You are a doctor, so not just some nameless footman trained to endure the frontline of the battle. But the reason for you being here instead of on the battlefield or in some hospital helping the needy indicates that you
“40 years ago today I decided to ask you to marry me.”
None come but he still gets nothing done before John trots downstairs in the morning, wearing his plaited woollen jumper.
Sherlock is leaning in and saying something in John’s ear, while his fingers brush the lobe which is almost covered by the scarf. John flips Sherlock’s nose and kisses it for good measure.
Jim looks at him with a bored expression on his face, like he thinks Sherlock is a pathetic waste of time. He crouches down to inspect him more closely. Sherlock flinches away from him, but winces at the pain.
The group laughs and Anderson glares at Sherlock murderously, taking a swig from his beer.
Sherlock clears his throat again.
“Another love letter for you,” he says cheerily and Sherlock moans.
When John’s phone wakes him up with its ringing (one of the homeless on the other end lying to him about Mrs Hudson being the victim of a fatal sniper-attack), Sherlock has been sitting in his chair just long enough to calm his breathing, pinching his thigh through his trouser pocket he wills himself not to cry.
John looks back down at the papers in the folder.
Mr Holmes of course saw the glances.
“People do little else.”
John held his hand all the way back to 221B, up the stairs and into the kitchen where he sat Sherlock down, made him a cup of tea and toast with strawberry jam on it, took out one of Mrs Hudson’s old aprons and began to fill a large sponge cake with chocolate-and-cream filling with a tad of brandy spooned into it. The gold ring in John’s finger caught the light every so often, making it gleam so brightly it looked brand new or polished within an inch of its life.
He screams again when Sherlock bites his stomach.
Louise Mortimer does not need dim candle light to hide herself. Louise Mortimer would be attractive in bright sunshine or under blaring fluorescent lamps.
“Oh. Well. Okay.”
“What?” Sherlock blinks.
Good, good, Sherlock nods.
In the morning, after changing to a clean shirt from Sherlock’s luggage, he grimaces at the smell of tea on the shirt he is supposed to meet the French ambassador in. But he says nothing, of course he doesn’t. Sherlock is broken down as it is.
He could not practice too often. They were miles away from any population, even the lonely sheep herders did not come here. But making a lot of noise, especially firing a gun, without checking their surroundings was idiotic. No matter what Mycroft said, Germany was still too far away for their practicing to be heard and even occupied France was some distance away. And still his dear brother had deemed silence paramount.
Lady Eva and Mrs Holmes noticed nothing, and Victor attempted his best to engage Mycroft in conversation about current political affairs – to which he replied curtly, sneering at his soup all the time – while Sherlock, having been placed on the opposite side of the table, slid his foot up and down Victor’s trouser leg. When his mother turned to ask him the name of that one philosopher she had been reading about (“Kierkegaard, mama.”), Sherlock engaged Lady Eva in a conversation, detailing the principles of the Dane to the small woman, all the while stroking her son’s calves with his toes.
“I’m an operative, working under a foreign government.”
John’s hands clenched into fists.
Sherlock exhales the cigarette smoke and grimaces.
The frustration of his mistake makes him snarky but he is too out of breath to say anything derisive to John and instead just tells him the truth of pickpocketing Detective Inspector Lestrade when he is being annoying.
He straightened his posture and took the folder from John.
She takes a biscuit, bites down and an expression of pure bliss appears on her face. She turns to Mrs Hudson who is attempting to push a cup of tea at Sherlock and is momentarily very busy. So she swallows the rest of the biscuit, takes another gulp of the tea and points at the file in John’s hands.
“Easier to track them down when I don’t have to go through all the people in your class. I have some very artistic torture methods in mind.”
“And he is not unconscious or in a coma, as you know. He is only under anaesthesia and will wake up soon. You are here because of some very impressive friends who are very hard to say no to while under the strict understanding that you will maintain your calm so as not to disturb the other patients or your friend when he wakes up.”
The cigarette let out its death wheeze and he chucked it into the bushes.
Then he realises John is taking his pulse.
Which makes Sherlock feel like his heart has just dropped into the bottomest bit of his stomach.
In mid-March, just when they have began to prepare the parks for the summer and the fountains are back in business and full of cold, sparkling water, Sherlock slips on the single slimy stone someone has thrown in the bottom of one of the Italian fountains in Kensington Gardens. No matter what certain doctors might say about taking off your socks and shoes (especially when idiot detectives have already shown symptoms of viral infection) or stepping into a fountain to fish out evidence when the mercury is barely above zero, the said idiot detectives still have the tendency to jump in after throwing their socks and shoes at their doctor friend.
And then the moon appeared from behind the clouds and shone over the entire forest and he was able to see his attacker.
“Gotcha!” Moriarty singsongs and John staggers backwards to let go of him, raises his hands above his head so that the snipers can see them.
Sherlock peeks into the last bag.
He is the epitome of home and safety, but at the moment he is nowhere near safe here on Baker Street. With Sherlock.
Without turning, John screams back (and he most definitely has the same early symptoms of laryngitis Perkins took sick leave for),
“Helps me with the violin.”
John grabbed his hand, the sudden small clink of metal against metal pulling Sherlock out of his daze of
Still, Sherlock refuses to let it be taken away from him.
to be.
“I thought you might call.”
“Don’t look at me like that. I am not staying standing up for seven hours.”
John blinks slowly, his jaw working uselessly. With all the oxygen seeming to have suddenly left the room he can’t even form words.
This is what Sherlock has been wanting to explain. It’s still just a thought, but an exciting one.
John comes home and Sherlock plays his violin until he falls asleep in his chair. He has tried to talk about her, trying to ask the questions Sherlock doesn’t know the answers to himself. So when John is finally snoring with the back of his head resting heavily against the chair, Sherlock takes his phone and texts her a New Year’s greeting. Then he slides the glass of whiskey slowly out of John’s grip, takes a sip and pretends he can taste John’s lips on the glass.
His brain felt like melted honey, everything golden and mellow around him.
“Also, you left my flip-flops under the sofa at the Palace,” John notes pulling on his coat as Sherlock rushes through the door, sound of laughter dancing after him like pearls on a string.
He hasn’t heard that for so long, an offer for help.
The flat is completely dark, the curtains are drawn and there is an eerie silence everywhere.
“If one day I ask you to marry me, promise to say yes?”
“Harriet doesn’t get old. She can’t be real.”
“Take this as a friendly warning, my dear. Back off.”
He whips around to look at Irene and Harriet standing in the corner, Harriet’s face buried in Irene’s dress. Her little body is covered in Semtex.
. Sherlock can see the tint on his cheeks even with the crappy quality of the Skype video.
Sherlock looks bewildered. John takes pity.
Sherlock stands at the window, his hospital clothes hanging loose over him. He has not eaten well and the several days of confinement seem to be weighing on him so heavily he is withering away.
With a last goodbye, he throws the phone aside and prepares for the dive.
“If I’d have to punch that face, I’d avoid your nose and teeth, too.”
The light catches Moriarty’s eyes when he turns his head. For a second they look blinding, glowing like they are all white.
“--- but no, not everyone can do what you do when I’m having a rotten day,” John pinches Sherlock’s earlobe so that he winces.
Fast-forward several hours, past the woman dressed in pink lying dead in an abandoned building, a message of
He decided to walk.
“Doctor Watson, is there something funny with my rash?”
“Hold me, John. Please hold me.”
“The most brilliant man I have ever met. And the most difficult one. My employer has ensured the authorities that he is the best man for the job, as our contact has ensured us that you are the best man to yours, that is taking care of
Sherlock sighs.
This has to stop.
“Hello, darling! Daddy’s home!”
The gaze from across the room did not whither.
John tries to blink sleep out of his eyes and free his arms from where they are lodged under Sherlock, who does not move an inch to help him, but leans in when John places his hand on his forehead.
“But as your brother told me the first time we met, and I’m sure you’ve heard all about it afterwards, I miss the war. Whatever the hell is wrong with me actually makes me need it or something equivalent to it, and this is as close as I can get. So no, I am not worried I can’t take it. What I am worried about is whether
Disappointment settles into his belly the minute he sees the tan and the teeth on the man looking at them owlishly. His first impression of the English is two sweaty men jumping in front of his taxi, almost being run over, flashing a badge, only to welcome him to London.
He is already running from everyone else, why not from John. So he leaves him standing alone in the middle of the road and goes to see Molly. She doesn’t ask unnecessary questions, only the one he needs to hear.
Three months and sixteen days later, several weeks of sleepless nights and even more of angry outbursts that shake the roof of 221B as well as 21 dead people later, Perkins the Bomber (as John has christened him in his head. A hurried title, true, and as imaginative as Bob the Builder but serves its purpose and allows him to mention the man in his blog whenever he has time to write up a post.) still remains free, cunning and speedily making his way up to Sherlock’s top 5 of The Most Despicable Human Beings and Most Frustrating Villains Ever.
It seemed such a miracle. Those fingers on the oak wood panels of the house he had grown up in, marking the spots he had touched with his own, searching the ghost of his touch.
It starts after about five minutes of peace and quiet.
He looks accusingly at Mycroft and Doctor Mortimer.
“There isn’t
Afterwards, he thinks a lot about the first time John walked in through the lab doors. Quick glance and he knows John is a doctor, army veteran, has spent time somewhere in the south, has a psychosomatic limp and an idiotic therapist. Borrowing his phone he realises John has a brother (only to find out later, the information accompanied by a sly smirk from John, that it’s actually his
Victor has heard the commotion and run to the courtyard, waving the security guards away, pushing through the crowd of ogling students and teachers. He grabs Sherlock’s shoulders and repeats his name.
He thinks about the cruel, friendless woman he swore he would never be like, looks at John’s retreating back, a lump rising in his throat, and says the only other true thing he can think of at the moment.
Sherlock inspects him for a moment.
“This is our best chance of getting a look at our killer!” he hisses into John’s ear while they are waiting for Sarah to exit the ladies.
John appears with a pot of tea and three cups balanced on a tray. He lowers it down on the coffee table and goes back in the kitchen to get the cake Mrs Hudson baked the day before.
“That doesn’t answer my question.”
The stoic calm emitting from Molly makes him turn to her. She is like this sometimes, ready to stand her ground for as long as it takes for Sherlock to pay attention to her. She has been doing it for years now, she is not going to stop. She is ready to get to the bottom of this, carve Sherlock’s brains out if it will make him talk about what is going on inside his head.
Sherlock’s voice comes out a whisper.
“Hey, Holmes, it’s okay. It’s okay, hey?” Victor shushes.
“John, I didn’t mean it like that, I…”
The mere thought of having to get in with him made John’s skin crawl.
“Yes, sir. And he says --- hand me the linen now --- he says that it’s to do with national security.”
Behind him, Victor lifted his hair away from his neck and huffed a breath of cold air softly against the skin.
“It’s the lack of space. So don’t worry. I’m not going to faint on you.”
He freezes mid-inhale.
She doesn’t give up.
No one wins. No one apologizes. This time, however, John seems to be determined that he is to stay in his chair until Sherlock gives him something that can even remotely be interpreted as an apology with the help of Sherlock-English dictionary.
“I don’t count.”
“MF2? Come in, MF2! Requesting information. What was the noise? Over.”
“Do you think there’ll be more?
But there is such gentleness in his eyes now that tells Sherlock he would not leave. Not anymore. Perhaps a year ago. 13 months, 2 weeks and four days. That’s how long it has been since John killed a man for him and turned to look him in the eye as if in just 24 hours he has understood how to tread the ground round Sherlock. Gentle reminders of politeness, the occasional night spent on the sofa at Sarah’s or Mike’s or just a few hours in a pub with Lestrade, but never leave to not return.
That night, Sherlock sits at the kitchen table inspecting the strong box they found from the remains of the building across the street. Already swiped for fingerprints and having gone through all other standard NSY procedures, John does not believe there is much to find.
Then he is on his knees in front of John, pulling at the straps holding the bomb against him.
He touched his hand on the tree.
He hasn’t heard the giggle since Buckingham Palace and the ashtray.
“Les Tuileries. The days when it rained so hard we were the only ones there.”
“You know, we really have to get rid of this if we want to get anywhere tonight.”
“Could we have a chat?” she asks.
“He’s jealous of my hair. He's obsessed with it because he tries very hard to hide the fact that he is going bald.”
“Had no one to tell.”
He slammed the folder shut.
“Care to join me?” he asks.
So he continues to fake snore (
The pink phone rings.
“Yes,” he answers eventually.
ascending the stairs.
His right hand was still hanging in mid-air, curved as if he was holding someone else’s palm in his, squeezing the invisible hand tightly for support.
His eyes grow enormous at the realisation.
Doctor Mortimer turns around too, looking directly at where Jim and Irene are standing by the large fireplace.
He stares at his shoes and kicks the ground. Once again, Victor has a flash of younger, angrier Sherlock walking round the courtyard with his hands in his pockets, muttering to himself.
“Maybe I’ll try again tomorrow,” Sherlock agrees.
“He is a rich prick. They can always afford to lose a few quid and I never feel bad for taking their money.”
“Are you cold?” Sherlock asked, his head drooping against his chest.
Insulting John never gets him anywhere, only makes him feel worse about himself.
“Stay away from me,” Sherlock whispers.
“Not the most hygienic way to ask someone for their food,” John slid the bowl across the small table and handed the spoon to Sherlock, who gobbled up the soup while John finished his bread and the small salad. When he was done, he wiped his mouth and placed his hand on Sherlock’s knee.
He makes the mistake of leaving once. Only once.
He twines their fingers together and leads on towards the single Chinese restaurant on the street. The lad behind the counter perks up when he sees potential customers approach.
The steps creaked.
“’Usual’?” Sherlock asks. “You think this is usual? Feeling tired all the time? Spams? Staring at a wall for hours because you don’t know what you are doing there, you just know that’s what you
When John doesn’t move, he tries a bit of nastiness. It’s what John is expecting from him at this point, might as well go with it.
Sherlock nods. There are two deep red patches on his cheeks.
“What?” John exclaims. “Go away where? Why?”
“I hate November. I hate this date.”
The person on the other end, speaking through the mouths of his terrified victims, is not something Sherlock wants to become part of John’s nightmares. And since the brave, idiotic,
Victor looks at him with a bright smile, surprised in turn that Sherlock has remembered his daughter’s name.
Still leaning against the back of his chair, he draws out an envelope under one of his books.
“Mycroft can’t help,” Sherlock interrupts.
John seems not to be at all afraid, Sherlock dearly hopes the time limit that will follow the next four pips will allow him to make sure the quiet breathing above his head stays that way. Quiet, even,
Sherlock laughed quietly.
He thinks about the first time he was able to admit it to himself, on his hands and knees on the Persian rug in Mycroft’s office, tears dotting the royal pattern, the mirror reflecting each jagged movement, each torn emotion, and he had no way of escaping it.
“I might have,” Sherlock scrunches up his nose and pokes it into John’s bellybutton. “There was so very much alcohol.”
“All right, all right,” John murmurs softly. “No blankets, no clothes, it’s okay.”
Sherlock hums like it’s the most delicious idea. John turns and descends the stairs.
It’s not her, definitely not her. If anything, Sherlock knows her body, her attributes as a woman. He knows her skin, though he was never able to read what was under it.
“Sherlock, good to have you here,” Lestrade runs to him and shakes his hand. “We’re really in deep with this one.”
He almost misses what John has to say to that.
The child stumbling towards him looks like he could be about fourteen months.
“Sherlock, you have been here for two days now. In all the conversations we have had, and I am not counting minutes ---“
“Well, then. You can start by getting us some champagne.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can hit a target if I want to,” Sherlock said, handing the gun back, holding it far from himself like it was something filthy. “I just prefer to catch my bad guys while they are still alive, so never had any reason to learn anything but self-defence.”
Molly, clearly not having forgotten Christmas but attempting to steer things back to normal, stares at the radiograph of the phone on the computer screen. She thinks it must be his girlfriend’s since he is x-raying it.
The landscape is magnificent in its autumn bloom. The river glimmers in the distance like a thousand mirrors, reflecting the clear blue sky and the blazing sun that still feels warm in the middle of October. The trees have lost only a part of their summer green and the grass is still as alive as it was in June, but one look at the surroundings and Sherlock knows it’s autumn.
He struck a match and put it to the kindling that caught fire instantly (
And cursed his choice the moment Sherlock closed the lid. There was a distinct
“Oh, let me guess, you’ll kill me,” Sherlock tries to sound disinterested, gun still steady as rock in his hand.
The woman is not one of Mycroft’s (though John’s surrendering expression says he thinks she is), Sherlock is familiar with every one of them, and no matter how puny John might believe the secretaries who pick him up to be, Sherlock knows they all have the highest security rate and could kill you with their fingernails in two seconds.
And he wouldn’t have it any other way.
John’s hand staid in his while he stuffed his wallet back into his trouser pocket, the bag of groceries hanging from his arm. The little
“We found Rachel,” informs Lestrade.
Pull.
“Can’t stand social niceties. Especially when they are not very nice.”
It made Sherlock feel like he was part of some secret society, a group of people whose sole purpose was to find and read the most notorious and hard-to-find novels of their time. Even though the thought made him smile to himself, it meant very little in the end. The real reason he cherished the book so much that he had brought it with him here (though hidden inside his radio, if for no other reason than to protect it from his brother’s prying eyes), was the person it had belonged to before him.
“Too much?”
He is still walking on egg shells around John, minding everything he says and does, never even toeing the fine line of balance they have achieved.
“It doesn’t mean anything that Mycroft denied her the pleasure of treating me. You can sign the papers as well,” Sherlock notes.
“Remember what you promised when you were eleven?”
He had no reason to whisper anymore, no bad guys to hear him and it would indeed have been very nice to let Lestrade know where they were so they could
“Seriously?” John asks. “This guy, a junkie? Excuse me, have you met him?”
John glanced up again to draw strength from Doctor Albertson’s steady gaze.
?” John asks Sherlock’s neck.
He thinks a little. Better to go to the very beginning.
“How?”
“Charming. Well done.”
Quiet. Too quiet.
On an afternoon, Sherlock comes home after a night and day spent away because of a date John brought home and who wouldn’t loosen the hold of her mouth on John’s the whole time Sherlock sat at the kitchen table. Now the kitchen is empty of women, only John is there, rummaging around, making something that could be pulau rice but lacks the telltale cashew nuts.
The cashier waved after them, hoping they’d enjoy their dinner and wished Sherlock a happy birthday.
Then there is Lestrade hopping up the stairs, informing him of what he already knows, that there is now a fourth suicide victim, there is something different about this one and finally he admits Sherlock is needed. He gets the case and suddenly it’s Christmas, gifts for all, and he leaves John in Mrs Hudson’s care whilst he dashes out to do what he does best.
“I think he knows exactly where,” she says cheerfully.
Sherlock snarls, sticks his head under the blankets and pokes his cold nose somewhere where it has no business being. John howls.
Sherlock sniffed. It was ridiculous that the man had held onto his winter gear. Idiotic sentiment for an institution that clearly cared nothing about him anymore. Mycroft had been very pleased, for Watson’s sentiment helped with the tight schedule they were on. Buying clothes for Sherlock was a nightmare, unless they were shopping for well-tailored trousers and expensive suit jackets from Savile Row. Having the other half of the operation already ready and in working order lighted up a childish petulance in Sherlock akin to fear of being left behind. So, he agreed to similar gear bought in a bulk just to have the business over and done with.
Their mother knew nothing nor did Victor’s mother. Year by year, Lady Eva became blinder and blinder to her son’s extravagances, letting him do as he pleased and closing her ears effectively from the rumours. She adored her son just as Sherlock’s mother adored hers, and both took active effort in ensuring their sons' happiness.
“He told me some things,” John said carefully.
“How are you?”
They are lying on their backs in the snow on a small hill near John’s home. From there they can see over all the little houses built extremely closely together in the small London suburb, count how many of them have a red slate roof or a black one, how many have had their antenna broken in the recent winter storm. But right now they have their eyes directed towards the iron-clad sky that promises more snow quite soon.
Every fibre of Sherlock’s being was focused on him, his eyes full of panic, gleaming from unshed tears, his jaw tight and thighs quivering.
Pull.
, he thinks when John finally lifts his gaze from the bloody pulp of hands. His eyes are full of fire.
Sherlock’s anger reaches another level.
They keep their communication to the minimum. Jim phones when he needs him and they stay out of each other’s lives outside assignments.
They have a very decent leather sofa in the sitting room that could easily fit two people and a bowl of popcorn in the middle or three people and perhaps someone could hold the bowl. But the furniture is more often than not occupied by Sherlock who takes the space of three people and more with his ridiculously long legs that are without exception hanging over one of the hand rests. (Unless he is sulking which is the time John knows it is least safe to be anywhere near those feet. Even with Sherlock crouched in one corner in foetal position to leave a spot for someone John's size, he would only be greeted by a kick in the thigh if he was to sit down.)
“So why is he playing this game with you?” John asks again. “Does he want to get caught?”
“Oh. I see. Sibling rivalry, now we’re getting somewhere.”
But there is something else as well.
“Excellent! Will you hand me that? I want you to sign my cast.”
Mr Trevor stood at the end of the hall, his hands behind his back, leaning against the banister of the stairs with the same leisured ease he had been showing throughout the evening.
Oh, wait. He already has that.
from John, an attack by a character from a Jewish folk story and a fake Vermeer worth 30 million pounds later, Sherlock sits in Lestrade’s office at the Yard, interrogating the owner of the fake masterpiece talking about something or someone very close to what Sherlock has been describing John that morning: a criminal mastermind who arranges crimes to disappear or to take place, whatever the customer requires.
“Enjoy it while it lasts,” John said sipping from his mug. “There is enough of the real stuff, but sooner or later we’ll have to start managing with the substitute.”
John first notices the rhythmic movements from the corner of his eye. He lifts his gaze and sees Sherlock’s feet shuffling against each other. He has stretched his legs in front of him, crossed his ankles and is waving away happily. Apparently he can’t keep himself still even sitting down.
There is not a hint of bare skin anywhere, the bowtie sitting tight around John’s neck and the jacket covering his back but his muscles are visible, and his face, enthralled by an original copy of Thomas Hardy displayed on one of the tables,
He drops the phone.
Or maybe he took his time, had some fun with the ones with families by waiting until they were away from home, alone in a hotel room, just enjoying a little peace after a long day.
John doesn’t press the matter, for which Sherlock is eternally grateful, but goes back to the file. Sherlock’s phone rings and he is up, calling over his shoulder that Lestrade needs him.
He wants to know if he ever hated her, at least after she separated them to the opposite sides of the house, locked the nursery at night to make sure Sherlock didn’t escape. There was no need, he always picked the lock. Mycroft had taught him how. The first night in the new nursery, the walls still smelling of paint and the coldness creeping into his bed, Mycroft had sneaked to his door, picked the lock in seconds and spent the rest of the night teaching Sherlock so that he would not have to spend his nights alone in the wing of the house that was only used as a storage space. Making sure to wake up early enough to escort Sherlock back to his room before the nanny woke up and came to fetch him, he then returned to his own room, knowing that their mother never bothered his mornings.
John sighs long and deep, squeezes his hands into fists and continues to pace the floor. He almost crashes into Molly, who suddenly bursts into the room, and then into someone else who follows close at her heels. It’s almost comical, the way the closing door first hits the man in the face and how he then almost falls over when he trips and crashes into John.
Sherlock is feeling slightly feverish, or maybe that’s just the spinning realisation that three years of hunting is over and he can once again start to think about the one place he has not allowed himself to think in three years, where the one person he has not stopped thinking about for a second is still sitting in his armchair, doing the crossword puzzle and drinking his tea.
for helping with the German!
He tried to relax, to concentrate, to take command of his senses. Breathing in, straining his ears, squinting his eyes he tried to see around himself, the smell of bile lingering in the cool crisp air.
A sigh. Gathering strength to remind him of the answer.
It is an expected reaction of someone suddenly touching him. No one does that, except Mrs Hudson, and he himself never touches anyone if he can avoid it. It is natural to be quite startled.
birthday, one could for once look clean and orderly, including the only jewel one wore. Especially considering what that single jewel must have gone through in the last year and a half (
In a daze he takes his coat and follows the man out of the door, into his cab and across London to a schoolyard where the man pulls out a gun. Unnecessary, that, and dull, but he continues to follow. All the way upstairs to an empty classroom where they sit down and
“You are not a freak,” John says sternly.
He starts up his evidence wall again (John looks surprised but pleased and calls it his little crafts wall just to show him how happy he is that he is working again) and the wallpaper is soon filled with grease stains from old Blu-Tack and torn off in places by pieces of tape.
So he decides that before John can get the words out of his mouth and embarrass himself further, become awkward round Sherlock (God forbid), Sherlock decides that taking him to see his idiot of a banker acquaintance is better than any other solution at the moment.
Sherlock shivers.
“Sherlock…” he tries.
Escaping the evening before was no use either. For one, he would have to find a place to stay for the night
“Connie Prince’s show is nothing compared to this,” Sherlock retorts before yelling at the young couple with a five-year-old son between them, looking more than happy to be there to tell their most private secrets on national television.
“You said okay. As far as I know that is a more colloquial way of saying yes.”
“I’m sure Anderson is very happy that I’m
“It’s not included in the armoury,” he said, attempting levity. When he noticed Sherlock was staring at his hand, he moved it quickly to rest on the table close to one of the guns he had already dismantled and cleaned before picking it up again and starting over.
Sherlock stood still, barely breathing, sure that the beating of his heart could be heard from miles away by anyone in the forest.
, is what John calls it every time afterwards,
A cup of peppermint tea and a small jug of milk appears on the table in front of them and Victor groans at the sight of it. He gives a wink to the girl and gulps down a mouthful of the tea before adding milk to what remains in the cup. He watches from the corner of his eye as the girl walks away.
It’s one of those moments when you know exactly what the other person wants only by looking at them. John sees need and desperation in Sherlock’s almost transparent grey eyes, and when he slides over him and grasps him relentlessly, John doesn’t stop him. Sherlock hasn’t touched him in months and so he lets him do what he pleases.
She looks at him and suddenly Sherlock recognizes what he saw in her eyes over ten years ago when the mask of a high-quality prostitute fell from her face with the first wail of her child in the next room.
She is sitting naked in front of him, and he sees nothing.
“She does?” Molly sounds terrified.
Sherlock rises stiffly to his knees.
“What have you done with my cigarettes?”
He thinks about that first sound a lot later, that soft flowing
June brought the news of the gas chambers and the 700,000 people dead in Poland. Suddenly, the true horror of the war now so far out of their reach filled the little cottage.
A gunshot tears a hole in the air and through the cabbie’s chest right through his heart. Sherlock almost falls back in surprise and when he turns round to see who has fired, the window opposite is already empty.
that. It was the pool and the chlorine and the snipers and the sniggering little Irish man saying he could stop John Watson like a clock if he wanted to.
“...a dozen feet from the border, yes. Can you believe it? And they just came out of nowhere...”
“He’s confused.”
“No, I laughed because I could imagine how you were at uni. Because it sounded exactly like you are today, except with zits. You pick out every detail and put them together to make a story of what your uni mates did the night before. It’s fantastic.”
And then the next morning there is another one.
Now the only thing Sherlock could move were his fingers.
“No.”
“What does it say?”
John doesn’t reply, doesn’t even look at him before Moriarty sneaks behind him and breathes in his ear,
Sherlock looked up. Victor was smiling, not the playful smirk he put on for everyone, but a genuine calm smile he had ever only shown to Sherlock and even to him only when they were alone. Not even his mother ever received it, and she had been the most important person in Victor’s life.
John squints at him, trying to determine whether he is actually interested or messing about.
“What?”
Mrs Hudson’s mostly chamomile works and Sherlock only shuffles downstairs after several hours, during which John has had time to shower, shave and give the yarders a piece of his mind by writing the case down on his blog and reminding the idiots that Sherlock has once again solved a case for them and only gotten a pharyngitis for his pains. He is lying on the sofa watching telly when Sherlock trots through the door, trips on the loose belt of his dressing gown and lands on John. He has just enough energy to beep into John’s neck before he starts snoring again.
It’s amazing what he will come up with to get John’s attention.
Sherlock eases his breathing to sound like someone who is deep asleep.
John had not had servants to take care of him, so he had been more of an eavesdropper on his mother and Harriet’s lifestyle, also present for even the more intimate moments of two women sharing secrets they usually never allowed male ears to hear. The younger of the two siblings, he had grown up in constant presence of two women, two mothers, two identical people who loved him too much.
“Are you okay?” he asks.
“That’s twice you’ve saved my life,” he whispered against John’s cheek.
“Don’t knock my drinking habits,” John says and gives him the cup Mrs Hudson offered and left on the table to wait. White tea, no sugar.
“Sir, I am honoured to meet you.”
That hurts Sherlock more than his own loneliness, the inability of others to understand him, his inability to understand them.
“Isn’t he sweet? I understand why you like having him around.”
“I could invite him over for dinner,” she had said, her embroidery poised on her lap, the needle forgotten between her fingers. “He is such a lovely young gentleman. It would be good for your brother to socialise, Mycroft.”
“That you lost someone. Someone you loved. And that he... That you... That you are the best code breaker there is and the only way he could get you to say yes was to blackmail you with your past.”
Jim has made him an adversary.
And Sherlock in return answers with the most inhuman way possible,
“Five. A bit small for reconnaissance, even for a detachment unit. I was worried there would be more, but I found where they came ashore and there was no sign of another boat.”
“You too,” John replies when the silence stretches to uncomfortable.
“I thought you’d have deleted it by now.”
“But being a soldier it would be very unusual if I had not.”
Quite a lot happens on November 8th, the year Sherlock is sixteen. First Mycroft stumbles down the stairs on his way to the kitchen, crashing an antique vase on the windowsill. Next he spills his morning coffee on the front of his shirt and bangs his toe against the table leg when he jumps up. Then both Sherlock and his father almost crack their heads open on the slippery driveway on their way to the car. Sherlock’s mother follows carefully behind them, ranting about bad luck and omens and how she is sure the whole day is cursed and next someone will most certainly die. Sherlock of all people does not believe in luck or omens of any kind, but even he might just agree with his mother when he returns home only to hear that John has broken his leg on the football field.
“He created something he thought he could never have. A woman he could desire, and a man to be his friend. They only became violent when he found the real thing.”
The men left in the warehouse close the door behind them with a bang.
It was a mistake.
When the silence becomes unbearable, he folds and looks at John. The softness of his eyes surprises him. He looks for all the world like he actually likes what he sees.
him, I know what he does.”
The gun goes off and John jumps slightly, hands still holding Sherlock’s shivering one over his heart. The bullet goes clean through the glass of the kitchen door and embeds itself into the fridge on the opposite side of the room.
“Apparently not,” Sherlock retorts and shoots daggers at the old lady, who retreats quickly and patters down the stairs to her flat. John stays still, peeking into the flat under Sherlock’s outstretched arm.
“It was. It was.”
“Sorry,” John starts. “I wasn’t…“
. Not
John smiles at him.
He took Sherlock’s hand and led him towards the end of the store and the enticing aroma of freshly baked bread.
The gears grind in Sherlock’s head. He is too into the hunt at this point. Has to wait for a while for the words to register. Look of horror when he understands.
“Amazing!”
“They’ve had me sitting around for so long that they’ve grown accustomed to me, and when you needed a caretaker I was very conveniently there. I came because no one else wanted to!”
John stood quiet in the dark, waiting, listening, staring into the pitch black forest, his gun raised, every muscle in his body tense.
All of it perhaps a well-maintained lie.
Irene Adler interrupts whatever Molly is going to say. Or the recording of her moan does. Sherlock gets a text and every pair of eyes are suddenly on Molly alone.
“How many are there?
“You will do it, Doctor Watson?”
a freak, and don’t you ever dare to say so again. You have schizophrenia, which is not a synonym for being a freak. Those people out there, the ones who stood and watched as you were torn apart by a situation that was not in your control, they are the freaks.”
“You can’t stay here, Sherlock,” John whispered. “We have to get back to the cabin, it’s easier to defend.”
Sherlock hasn’t been able to concentrate after Jim has barged into the room. He has spent some time deducing the man from what he could see from his suitcase and appearance, gotten frustrated on the prospect of having to tolerate another human being in his living space on a day-to-day basis and finally sat down at his desk in front of the window.
“It is
He performs well, gets a round of applause, a
“We cut it down after Sherlock climbed in it and broke his leg when he was seven. Nasty business. The tree was hollow throughout. It was dangerous.”
“Nil,” Victor emphasises with a stomp of his king against the board. ”You just sit in your dark room, fiddling round with papers older than your grandmother, trying to solve a case minds much brighter and more experienced than yours haven’t been able to solve, dreaming that your failure to perform here will be forgiven if you find someone whose victims are already rotten in the ground. My question is, Sherlock, what if you were not meant to play this game?”
It’s not important, not now, and when he runs into the darkness of the alleys and back to Baker Street with John on his heels, he feels the sense of contentment stay at the bottom of his stomach.
do?” John sighs.
Which is good.
Clickety-clack of high heels reach the door. Sherlock lifts his eyes and tries to sound disoriented,
Sherlock picked up the bottle of gun oil.
“It doesn’t fit me now,” she says to John, exhausted but happier than ever as Sherlock rocks the little bundle in his arms and looks at it like he has never seen anything more amazing. “My feet and hands are so swollen she’ll be in university before I’m back to my regular size.”
Sitting in his chair with his knees drawn up, he listens for the door. John finally steps out and the vase falls over, without the desired sound of glass breaking. Only water sloshing and a muffled curse from John. He says something to Mrs Hudson who replies and then he is finally,
Sherlock has started slightly at the sound of the breaking cup but John has deemed it best to keep on going like nothing has happened. It won’t do Sherlock any good to startle at the smallest sounds and John to encourage it by running to his side.
“About what?” he spits out, eyes darting to the men who look like they are flexing their muscles under their shirts, ready to bounce.
“That’s only because you forgot your gloves as well,” Sherlock retorts with no mercy. He picks John’s fingers up from where they’ve been slithering inside his coat between the buttons and breathes warmth on them.
The road is closed, now it’s all dead ends in front of him. No alternative routes.
John doesn’t trust him, Sherlock can see that clearly. So he gives him time, keeps his distance, only calling when he has something he knows John will find funny or interesting.
“This is what I’ve always wanted,” he says between lips pressing into lips. “Make-up snogging.”
Any plan Sherlock could have come up with goes out of the window. He turns back to the corpse, now going through any possible means of how to get rid of it quickly and efficiently, with the least bit of mess. Jim has called him in for a reason. With his knowledge of chemistry they could melt the body in less than half an hour and have it done with.
Sherlock feels ill.
“There is no whipping! This is not a kink. But you are right about one thing regardless of your stupidity. Pull!”
Sherlock is livid. He needs a cigarette or a case or his head will explode.
John has disappeared, she has taken his chair, is trying to inhabit his place in Sherlock’s head as well, she stares at him when he tells her about Coventry and her voice rasps,
Barely able to keep himself from cracking his bow in half, he returns to the window, only to see what he has been waiting for weeks.
“We have it at home,” John said gently, pulling him towards the exit.
John’s gaze flicks behind Sherlock’s shoulder.
Dead men have no pulse.
He knows he can’t dodge it forever. It will all change, the quiet mornings with John in the shower, his ear pressed against the wood. Lazy Sundays of bickering, takeaway and John begging Lestrade for cold cases. John tapping away on his laptop, writing up their newest case.
Murray pulled him into a tight embrace and banged him on the shoulders.
His best shit-eating I-know-best face in place and some stupid popular culture nonsense dribbling down his chin, all to try and intimidate her into thinking she does not have the upper hand.
He pressed the handle down carefully, pushing against the wood with his hand to stop any sound, and pulled the door open.
“I don’t know whether it was me crying so hard or some telepathic brotherly power, but Mycroft found and saved me.”
The newest emotion is something he can’t quite decipher: it’s a mixture of hunger and perhaps a hint of the friendly tenderness but now there’s nothing funny about the way Sherlock swipes his tongue over his lips, nor is John amazed by anything else than the insistent flutter in his belly.
Though clearly surprised by his attitude, Mr Holmes had seen his intentions the moment he had lifted his eyes from his papers. Having assured John his position was in no danger, they had had a discussion which had made John decide the best course of action was not to return to the front door where the officer was waiting for him by the car, but to slip out through the window of the men’s room. Walking briskly along the narrow alley behind the club, looking over his shoulder at every step, he had turned to the right and begun to walk towards East London.
“Could you put something on, please?”
“You scared?” he asks, picking up the pawn and wiggling it at Sherlock.
Sherlock hasn’t heard those words in such a long time.
“She’s doing good,” he says, sipping his tea. “Just started her thesis, which is awful, of course, but it keeps her busy and out of trouble.”
Sherlock squeezes John’s hand over his heart so tight it hurts.
“Fine,” he hisses. “Just as well. You’re useless to me anyway.”
“Mycroft told me to call if you try and kill me or anything,” he smiles sadly.
“Oh, really?” Jim leers. “You are still talking to me, big shot. A doofus, who can’t even get the simplest case solved with all the drugs he needs to take to keep his
“He thought I was a soldier.”
Of course all eyes are on the blonde.
“She’s dead.”
“It’s fine, Murray.”
oh John
He looks down to see his ankles, like his hands, are tied up.
“Molly…”
“Please answer it. I know you are dying to.”
John is shaking his head and looks about as stern as Sherlock must look uncomfortable. He is saying no, too many times, that is way too much of a single word used at one time, but he is also saying it’s all fine.
First email in weeks, and it was sent by a primary school girl with pigtails and a missing pet rabbit!
“What’s so funny?” asks John from the door.
All of them are filled to the edges with Sherlock’s spidery handwriting.
Sherlock mumbles something, pointing at a lunchbox with a half-eaten smelly sandwich he has taken a bite from days earlier.
“I wonder if I could find someone with a passion for Wilde from the Introduction to Victorian Literature tomorrow. A first-year, still unfamiliar with everything important but oddly distracted by the character descriptions of Lord Henry Wotton. You’re not easily distracted, are you?”
“And John didn’t?” she asks evenly.
The man started and looked around himself like he did not know where he was. He took off his glasses again and his hands were already going towards his tie when John spoke,
(See the end of the chapter for
He kisses Molly goodbye. She smiles shyly and blushes, but looks pleased.
“Could you hurt me, Sherlock?”
He tries to remove his hand very carefully from behind Sherlock’s head. Water drips down the towel on Sherlock’s cheek, and he mumbles in his sleep and rubs at his cheekbone with his fist, sighs and grabs his nose between forefinger and thumb.
His clothes askew, one sleeve torn off the shoulder, John’s skin was in plain view. His gnarled scar, the biggest of many smaller cuts and bruises on his skin, stared up at Sherlock like an eye. He placed his lips on it gently and kissed the skin, marvelling how different it was compared to Victor’s unblemished one.
The idea makes him stammer which pulls both of their attention back to him.
Nothing. Neither here nor there.
Jim takes a step towards John.
Mycroft had arranged a car to arrive at exactly two o’clock to take Victor to the station and another one five minutes later to drive Sherlock to Milton Keynes. Just enough to ensure no one could see them together or that Sherlock would not have time to get to Victoria Station.
The seagull holding the treasure swept gracefully past its attacker, dodging every swipe with a slow beat of its wings, like the whole thing was a game to it, something to pass the time. The other kept flapping behind it, desperate to keep up with the pace, finally giving up and sweeping down to rest on a desolate rock peeking from the waves.
Sherlock breathes in for what feels like first time since John walked through the door.
But he leaves the door open.
“Mrs Hudson takes care of you,” John mumbles into the bath water, raising bubbles to the surface. He feels the hand on his stomach, fingers poking at his.
Sherlock opens his mouth again and just then the phone on his chair lights up with a new message.
“You’ve been to war before.”
Irene Adler’s palpable thump against his fingers
The film was okay, but the tune especially stuck in his head and apparently the same happened to Sherlock for there he was, whistling perfectly in sync with the film’s soundtrack. John is amazed at what the man can remember, chooses to remember. Sherlock had lain on the sofa the whole time John was engaged in the film, snorted every time he was looked at and especially loud every time the boy with the scar or any of his friends waved their wands around and muttered something slightly resembling Latin. The film had ended with sounds very much like snores from Sherlock’s corner but his eyes had been open the whole time.
Victor turned his face towards the sun and closed his eyes.
“If you don’t count the two holes he has in his abdomen and the one in his arm, I’d say he is in tip-top shape,” Sherlock snarled.
So Sherlock nestles into the sofa, almost hiding himself in the dusty space between the back rest and the cushions. John looms over him, trying to decide whether he should sneak to see Mrs Hudson and ask her for more of the mostly-chamomile tea and risk Sherlock getting suspicious of why John would not make tea from their own supplies which he knows to be plenty.
He smiled endearingly at Sherlock, touched the now sleeping child’s hand gently and followed the dinner call to the dining room.
, back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her. For a moment, she stays there, leaning against the door, staring ponderingly at her naked toes.
“How much did he tell you?”
John looked back at the open folder in his lap.
He looked up again.
Something hard hit him on the head and he fell down, his gun dropping from his limp hand to the ground, and an invisible but very hard and heavy foot pressed against his sternum.
would I want to stick my dick in Chanel no. 5 and probably get yeast infection on the go?”
Or Sherlock does, but the others are only some ten or twenty steps behind. He is not thinking about who gets the credit from the case at this point. He has been chasing this man for six months. He is so emotionally drained that he doesn’t know whether to smile or to cry when he finally chases him into a corner.
He looks at Sherlock for a while longer, then goes back to the shoes.
John could kiss Mycroft.
“I don’t think they are going to let you back in the Palace after what happened last time.”
“What have you done with him? He has nothing to do with this!”
“You said the victims take the poison themselves,” John pipes up. “So, maybe the murderer talks to them? Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow?”
“Because your mother and father love each other very much and 40 years ago they decided that your intolerable big brother needed an intolerable baby brother or sister to torment and so along came you.”
The man's riffle pressed against his jugular.
So rare that feeling. It sends other memories flooding in. Mycroft, Mrs Hudson, aunt Cecilia, father. And then, the familiarity of the lips reminding him of the red lipstick print above his jaw when he woke up, head hollow from the drug, the imprint of her mouth mostly rubbed on his pillowcase, the skin shining red after he noticed it in the bathroom mirror and scrubbed the stain away with a nail brush.
“The situation is not optimal,” Mr Holmes said raising his eyes again, “but we have no other way of protecting that part of the island without moving resources away from significant areas of defence or without giving out our knowledge of their plan. We have to form a strategy but we also have to be quick. It’s like chess.”
Sherlock looked puzzled.
There’s the snide remark he came for and yet Sherlock doesn’t feel any better. Mycroft’s shoes clicking down the hall beat in tune with the pulse in his wrist, and when he catches a sight of his own dilated pupils in the full-length mirror hanging on the wall, he goes gasping on his knees on the Persian rug.
He stretched luxuriously, his long legs poking out under the duvet, stood up and, without bothering with his own shoes or socks, walked to the curtain that hid the washstand and pulled it aside.
“I wasn’t in the bomb squad.”
There would be no time to pick it up now. His meeting with Mr Holmes had taken longer than promised.
Sherlock smirked.
That night, they stay at Henry’s. John doesn’t take no for an answer, even though anyone can see that this, the night both the dog and the real source of Henry’s nightmares are dead, he will sleep more soundly than he has in a long while.
“How was that reaction?” John asks softly.
There was no way of getting away by crouching on the ground. He stood up and fast like a lightning he began to run away from the sound calling after him, sliding his hand over the barks of the trees, running to left and right to make sure the sounds of his escape were too confusing for the soldier following him to get a direct hit in the dark.
“See,” Sherlock stammers nervously, licking his lips, “I thought you would need something to write things down when you’re on the move. Words. At the auction, you said that God must be a writer because we have so many words. You said that. And notebook is always better than a blog.”
Sherlock’s mother, the hopeless romantic that she was, sighed longingly every time she heard the story of Mr and Mrs Kovács’ first meeting. She welcomed each new child with the same devotion and love she had so far only given to her own children. The eldest was her favourite, a quiet boy of nine whose blue eyes reminded her of her late husband’s.
. Damn that he had to get them wrong last time.
John cracks open an eye he has closed during the few seconds of quiet and squeezed tighter shut when he heard Sherlock sprinting his way into the flat. Sherlock is standing in front of the sofa, staring down at John like he is the lost dodo, looking like he has only understood the importance of this discovery the minute he has found the extinct species in his sitting room.
“For God’s sake, Sherlock, pull yourself together.”
“Doctor Watson,” Doctor Albertson introduced, “Mr Gareth Hartley.”
With the shivers and his patent leather shoes, Sherlock does sound like a tap dancer practicing for an upcoming performance.
“Did you bring your sleeping bag?” John asked Sherlock who was looking at the dusty bedding with distaste.
“You know what I do. Off you go.”
“Gentle enough for you?” Sherlock smirks and digs his fingers more forcefully into the soft flesh.
Sherlock wriggled under him. Very violently. Then he tried to free his arms by flexing his muscles, shaking his arms up, and with a last miserable attempt by trying to wrap his fingers around John’s wrists.
“Get up from my spot first.”
“I thought that because you think God invented all the words I could start off the book and write ‘delusional’ there, but I thought that might be… rude.”
“Are you having a nightmare?” Sherlock asks, not even trying to lower his voice.
John just shakes his head.
A pair of silvery eyes look down at him, the mouth below spread into a grin that makes something tingle at the back of Sherlock’s neck. It is a smile both unnerving and exhilarating, and Sherlock can’t wait to find out more about it.
Worried that she is losing her phone with John walking out of the door, telling the truth to Sherlock and threatening to shoot her himself if she ever comes near him again, she asks quickly,
“We are expecting an attack from Germany soon,” he continued. “A major one. They will try and infiltrate the weakest part of the country. We have received messages...”
They are allowed fifteen minutes. Sherlock spends it drawing on the cast while Mycroft chats with John about the accident.
“If the rumours are anything to go by and a tom actually stole his heart before it got to Stinsford, you’d probably get as
“There is nothing
“You have to sign it,” he says.
Sherlock looked at him from the corner of his eye, fascinated by the scar on his shoulder.
Lately, John has only gone out for a case or to go to work and there is no change in his behaviour, in fact he seems to be happy in his adrenaline-filled life of catching bad guys and eating dim sum at one in the morning.
Sherlock stopped right at the edge of the forest.
He’ll throw up in the toilet, head throbbing with images of everything that might have happened if the Bee Gees ringtone hadn’t started.
Suddenly Jim barges in, face red and hands shaking.
Then comes the day Sherlock has been expecting since the beginning. His phone rings and John’s voice, suddenly so far away, tells him that the jury has declared Moriarty not guilty.
Lestrade and Donovan, accompanied by the SWAT team, stumble on the scene a moment later, stopping dead at the sight of Sherlock, bloody hair sticking to his relatively clean forehead, John still wiping his face and shushing him comfortingly, murmuring sweet nothings, using the steadily dripping tears to clean Sherlock’s mouth.
“Lestrade sent his dogsbody to see how I’m doing? Lovely. Well, I’m sure nobody missed me. You can go back, errand boy, and tell him I’m fine, not on any drugs and almost solved the case.”
And Sherlock purrs.
“So your plan is to let us sit there for God knows how long, listening to messages that may or may not come, and look out for planes.”
John shakes his head slowly, incredulous that anything that has happened could
“And then you left.”
After a moment of silence, John presses Enter for the last time, closes the lid of his laptop and stretches luxuriously. His left foot jerks slightly against Sherlock’s bare ankle.
“I’m fine with it, I really am,” John crosses his arms. “I admire you and what you do. I wish I could be as clever and good at it as you are. For a moment I actually thought you wanted my help. I thought you actually cared about the victims, despite what you said at the lab. So I tried to help. I took the phone from your coat pocket and went through it to see if I would notice something you might have missed.”
Sherlock points the gun at him and John freezes.
“Pipe down, you idiot! We’re in public.”
All Sherlock’s hopes of possibly hiding his past from John at least a little while longer are shattered along with Lestrade’s smug grin. Sherlock hisses in John’s ear, begging him to shut up.
“Maybe you’re just better with chemicals than people,” Jim smiles down at him.
“Why do you think I continue to keep you here?”
“But,” Sherlock continues, “I think it couldn’t be too awful if you accompanied me. I’m sure there will be food as well.”
“You missed the meeting.”
He stares at the saliva-dripping object on the small palm, looks back at the solemn face, and shakes his head. He buries his face back into the book, preparing himself for the crying that is bound to come. But the child stays silent and he lifts his head up, intrigued.
“Why not?” Doctor Mortimer asks. “Is it so hard to believe I am who I say I am?”
So maybe an apology is not enough this time. Maybe this time he will need to do something much more meaningful.
He remembers it all in the morning when he goes downstairs, only to see a flat empty of Sherlock. He takes out his phone to text him, to apologise, but just then the front door opens and footsteps pound upstairs. Sherlock, coat wet and hair tussled, doesn’t spare a glance at him but stomps to the bedroom and slams the door shut so that the nails shake in the hinges.
No one replies.
, John thought to himself. By looking at the list, they could be going to Antarctica for all he knew.
Sherlock smirks.
” John says slowly with his pondering face on.
“You bitch. You’ve been working for him all this time?”
John hummed acknowledgingly.
John clearly gives in, because he turns his head back to the sky.
“Why did you lie?”
Sherlock catches the fourth tongue slip with his teeth.
She almost trips on the heel of her skirt when he crowds close to her and rakes her up and down.
“I’ll get it,” Sherlock offers.
“You can’t be with him 24/7, John,” Doctor Mortimer says gently.
He only lets Sherlock enter and squeezes him tight against his chest before sniffing and telling Sherlock something he says will be the most important advice he will ever get.
He is. Sometimes alone, sometimes with Harriet. Sherlock turns round a corner and he is standing there, leaning against a wall, grinning alluringly, begins to approach him with an air of confidentiality but Sherlock walks past him without looking.
Sherlock arrives to the pool fifteen minutes to midnight. Enough time to refresh his memory about the exits, the windows and how best to enter the pool area so that he is seen clearly but that the gun in his pocket is not.
As the door upstairs clicks shut, the screen of the mobile lights up, informing him that he has one new text.
He was gone a quarter of an hour. Sherlock rummaged through his bag, the books by his bed, the linen and the mattress. Nothing. Not even a redacted letter from a family member or a loved one from the home front. On the second try on the bag, he found a journal full of complex shorthand hidden in the lining of the side pocket.
Victor’s hand in his as he kissed him goodbye at the door.
“It’s your
There are people who call him crazy. They think differently about those words than he does. For him, they are a salvation, a benediction,
Sherlock snorts.
His gaze on Sherlock, honest and open, is so relaxing that Sherlock smiles as well, finally stops to look at John, really look and think how this man, this soldier, suddenly looks so healed. He hasn’t even noticed the cane is gone yet, but it’s as if by forgetting the thing in the restaurant, he also forgot everything it represented as well. Pain, nightmares, self-discipline.
