“Clare,” Jude softly interrupted, kneeling down in front of Clare on a lower step so that their faces would be even, “You didn't do that to me. You never made me feel weak. I wanted to make love to you that way because I wanted to experience it for myself. You're not like those men -”
“Jude!” he gasped.
Sam ignored his husband's snide comment. It didn't take long for the Winchesters to gather in the same room. Cas flew into the kitchen as soon as Sam called for him, looking worried. Dean didn't have time to explain what was going on because the kids showed up right after him. By the time Jude and Jessica walked in together, Sam and Dean were both standing at the stove with their arms crossed, both equally nervous about how they were going to approach this awkward subject. Jude and Jess must have noticed the serious atmosphere of the kitchen because their smiles dimmed when they came inside to see their fathers.
There was a loud sigh of frustration before Dean felt his feet hit the floor. Whoever was holding them had dropped the dead weight, but Dean didn’t move. He was in too much pain to properly break free and fight. Instead, he listened to the best of his ability.
Jude tried to follow Jessie's pointing finger, but he couldn't see very far through the dark haze. The only thing in his sight were a few lit windows, so the building must have had some power. Besides that, the wind was picking up again, making it hard for him to keep his eyes open because of the dusty debris. Jude barely caught that Clare gave Jess a tiny nudge toward the entrance, after which they all started into the hospital.
Cas nodded.
Bobby cut off the guy's question with a sudden kiss, plunging his mouth against Crowley's and reaching up to hold the back of his head. Hot air fogged between their noses as their tongues wrestled together. Bobby could taste a tiny hint of alcohol on Crowley's lips and it only made the man want to dive in deeper; to kiss him longer, and hold him tighter. He wasn't sure how long it lasted – was it a few seconds? A few years? – before had to pull away to breathe. He gasped for breath but stayed close, holding the warm demon against him in the cold weather.
the delicious flavor of Clare's mouth. For a second, Jude was back in the loving arms of his boyfriend with no Darkness in sight.
“What's gonna be in here, Jessie?” he asked, staring at his cousin with hopefulness.
“H – he must have gone into the bunker… what’s left of it… to search for the animals.”
“He flew, Cas,” Daddy said, kneeling down next to Papa on the floor and putting Jude down, “Our son
“He... he has all of his limbs and most of his major organs now, as well as a bit of brainwave activity,” Cas said slowly, talking about the baby, “... but, he isn't moving. If he remains motionless in the womb, I fear that he won't have mobility outside of it, either.”
Before Dad could argue anymore, Papa turned and walked away, probably heading over to be with Jane and Rowena. Jessie kept her eyes on her Dad through the tiny gap, watching his expression fill with anxiety and worry as he fiddled with the socks on the table nearby. For most of her life, Jess thought that her Dad's protectiveness was really sweet. It was nice to be looked after and cared for, especially when she was a little girl. But now that she was getting older, it seemed like Dad had trouble letting Jess do the simplest things on her own. Why did he want to keep her young forever?
“Wouldn't be the first time we've freaked someone out,” Dean shrugged.
How could Castiel ever refuse that begging tone? Though Dean's hole resisted him a bit, Castiel pressed on, entering Dean's body with the force that only an angel could possess. Dean's face lit up at the sensation and he sucked in a shrill gasp. His hands were clutching anything, then; Cas's clothes, his own knees, the bed of hay beneath him. Dean was in a state of pleasure that Castiel could barely comprehend.
“Hey,” Dad breathed, his voice shallow, “I... I guess we still don't know anything, huh?”
Charlie continued to cling to Jess’s shoulder and hair as they rounded the corner to walk into the kitchen. Jess’s parents were both standing at the kitchen stove. Papa was flipping pancakes while Dad poured some coffee. Uncle Dean and Cas were sitting at the table, talking quietly to each other in hushed tones. As soon as Jess entered the room, however, all the eyes fell on her and the baby in her arms. Papa instantly flew himself over to greet them.
Dean couldn't help but glare at the script.
Finally, at long last, Jude felt a genuine smile stretch across his own face. The raging storm in his heart subsided and quieted into a somber mist. Grandpa seemed to sense the change because his own smile widened and he pulled Jude in for a quick hug. Jude closed his eyes, savoring the overwhelming warmth of his Grandpa’s love. All at once, he felt completely at peace. About the future, about his life, about everything. Grandpa eventually pulled away and patted Jude on the shoulder before stepping forward. It seemed like he was about to walk away when he paused again and turned around to give Jude another misty-eyed look.
“Cas,” he almost whispered, so low that Bobby strained to hear, “I'll be honest with you. I never thought I would get married at all. I mean, when I was growing up, I always figured that I would fight for as long as I could and end up dying young, just like the soldier my dad wanted me to be. Plus, after all the shit I've done in my life, I knew I didn't deserve to be happy anyway. I didn't deserve a big family or a nice house. I didn't deserve love. Especially not the heart-pounding, soul-aching, life-changing kind of love... But then, you came walking through those barn doors like a badass and I've been a different man ever since.”
Jude beamed up at his fiance for another second before stepping back to look at the glasses in his hands. They didn't seem very special at all; just black frames and clear lenses. But Jude knew better than anyone how deceiving looks could be. The angel took a deep breath before slowly sliding the glasses on and raising his head to look around. Of course, the first thing he looked at was Clarence... and his mouth slowly fell open again.
“Y – yeah,” Dean huffed with disappointment, “But we’ve gotta try.”
“I’m here,” Jude agreed, cringing slightly from the pain, “Wh – where is everyone? Clare? The – the babies?”
you?” Jane repeated.
“What? Why not?!” Jess snapped, “Pop, she could be dying!”
"But, speaking of relationships," she whispered, glancing between her parents, "Um... Tonight Ollie sorta-kinda asked me to go to a dance with him."
The polar bear exhibit included a huge clear glass that held a lot of water, kind of like a fish tank, and the bears were swimming around and playing in it. Jessica saw that there was already another small family standing near the huge glass looking at the bears, too. There was a mommy, a daddy, and a small baby inside a stroller. Though Jessica was excited to see the polar bears, the little baby in the stroller kept pulling her attention away. He was so cute and small! Such an adorable baby! Jessie smiled and waved at him – and he actually waved back. Aww! What a cutie!
“I love you, Clare,” Jude whimpered.
The look on Sam's face was priceless. Dean had never seen such a mixture of pride, awe, and relief in his little brother's eyes before. A smile was trying to grow across his mouth as he drank in the sight of the little hand clutching Dean's finger.
Clare watched a tear leak from the corner of his mother's eye and slide down her pale cheek as she blinked up at him.
Dean blinked hard a few times, trying to keep the sudden abundance of moisture in his eyes. Damn. Cas was such a loving poetic bastard...
so good. Sam loved him
“Huh. That's, uh, quite an offer,” Gabe mumbled, bobbing his head, “Hypothetically, if I were to say no to this deal, what would happen?”
Ollie, who now looked a little pleased with the fact that his mom just slapped the devil, smirked and leaned forward to tap her shoulder.
“It's alright,” John allowed, opening the motel door for them with a half smile, “You kids have a good night. Stay safe out there.”
“Y – Yeah. All done,” he loudly confirmed to his boss, before lowering his voice and smiling fondly at his girlfriend, “You are an
“Thank you so much,” she said, batting her eyelashes for good measure.
“I've gotta go to the gas station real quick,” he announced, causing everyone to look at him, “Shouldn't take me very long -”
"I love you too," Castiel replied, losing himself inside the forest of Dean's green eyes.
“Ugh! I get it!” Dean grumbled in annoyance, trying to shoo away mental pictures that were attempting to crawl into his head, “I know that part already, dammit! I just want to know
adorable," Papa squeaked, nudging Jess forward and tugging Ollie closer, "Let's get some pictures to commemorate how precious you are."
And this sign came when Jude lit up the entire sky. His holy, snow-white grace shined from every fiber of his being as he stretched his arms up toward the heavens. Just beyond Jude's finger tips, a small portion of the clouds dispersed, revealing a single ray of pure sunlight. The beam of light shined down on Jude's floating form, bathing him in warmth and perfectly outlining his silhouette. Tears threatened to rise up in Castiel's eyes as he gazed at the breathtaking view of his child defeating the most powerful foe in history.
Jessie took a second to glance back at Ollie, who carefully grabbed her hand and gave her an assuring nod, but eventually did as Clare asked. She kept her free hand held out in front of her as she pressed forward and out of the motel door. Clarence held onto Ollie's shoulder as he passed and pulled Jude along, creating yet another conga line of safety. Jude briefly glanced down to see that Dickie was there too. How in the world did uncle Gabe's dog get all the way to Chicago?! Maybe he flew with them and Jude just couldn't see him in the dark.
The part that troubled Castiel the most, however, was that Dean's young face was skewed in his sleep. His tiny chest was heaving a bit, as if he was trying to catch his breath, and his eyes were flickering under their closed lids. During the countless nights that Castiel laid next to Dean, he had studied every aspect of his sleeping patterns. And now, as the angel gazed down at the boy on the bed, Cas was sure that Dean was having a nightmare.
"I brought the camera," Papa announced to Ms. Jane, holding up the clunky device, "I thought we could take a few pictures of the kids before they go."
“Really?” Meg purred, her voice closer than before. “Which soul?”
It sounded like he was trying to get her mind off the chaotic reality of her current circumstances by distracting her with a more mundane topic. Meg held her brown beer bottle between her knees and fiddled with the rim as she answered.
A moment passed by in silence while the angels debated on how to open the gate before Sam spoke again. He was practically whispering, sounding kind of embarrassed.
The bedroom door opened again and Jude and Jessie both snapped their heads up in surprise. Dad and uncle Sam came back inside, followed by uncle Gabe, Papa, and Dickie. Everybody shuffled in and filled up Jude's room with chatter. The adults were all still arguing in hushed voices, except for uncle Gabe. He smiled down at Jude and Jessie when he came in.
“Michael and Lucifer? They’re in the cage together, in Hell,” Dean answered. “Sam and I tossed them in together. Well, Adam was involved, too. You know, our half-brother? He said yes to Michael and Sam said yes to Lucifer, but we got Sammy back out of the cage. I think Adam is still Michael’s meatsuit, though. I don’t know, man. That was so long ago.”
“And we have sex?” he asked again with narrowed eyes.
“Do what? Tell the truth?” Gabe asked, “I could have saved that dog, Sam. One touch from my grace and he would be alive right now. I wouldn’t be feeling like shit.”
“That was Crowley,” he answered, “He and Bobby want to offer Clarence a room at Bobby's house.”
“What did he say?!” Clarence shouted, gently shoving Papa out of the way so that he could come closer to see Jess's face.
“Clarence?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The man scrambled up from the ground and fought to keep his balance as he reached out his hand. He wasn’t about to leave the king behind. Dean hadn’t realized it until that moment, but the thought of the king – the thought of
's knife...
Uncle Bobby and uncle Crowley both grinned back at Jess, looking like the happiest uncles in the world. Papa carefully moved the wooden box out of the way so that uncle Dean could put the next present in front of Jess. It was a gift bag with a unicorn on the front. Next to her, Ollie suddenly shifted around in the seat with excitement.
Dean gave his brother a weary look. 'Normal' kids? Really?
Again, Ollie glanced around bashfully, but Jess didn't understand why. They needed to have sex right now! Didn't Ollie know that?! When his cocoa eyes returned, Ollie blinked at Jess in confusion.
Jude's blue eyes eventually wandered up to meet Dean's and Dean could see a small bit of wonder in his son's bold stare.
, which Jessie assumed was the sound of Jude forcefully nudging Clarence in the ribs, and Clare hissed a tiny 'ow.' Ollie and Jessie stayed in their embrace for a moment or two before she raised her head to look at his adorable face again. Jess could hear the faint sound of Ms. Jane's voice on the phone, rambling frantically in Spanish. Ollie noticed Jess's glance toward the phone and sighed.
imagine losing you... I'm not trying to excuse what I did last night. Your Papa is right, I should have never left the bunker. I feel horrible for making you so upset... I just want you to know that I'm sorry."
“It is not junk, Dean. Not to me,” the angel said woefully. “All of this, everything you see… It is the last of humanity’s good work. The last of my father’s holy creation.”
“I don’t ever want to live in a world without you, Cas. I tried it, and it’s definitely not for me,” Dean explained, carefully sliding the angel back down to stand him on his feet and take his hand. “Look, I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, or the next day, or any day after. All I know is that being without you isn’t an option. And, well, marriage is, um, it’s a human thing. I don’t know if you understand what I’m asking. I just want – ”
“Why are you here, Father?” the angel asked, “Why did you wake the children?”
“Whoa whoa, wait a whistle-blowing second,” Gabriel huffed, glancing between his daughter and Chuck, “Is... is this the secret you guys have been keeping from us?”
,” Jude barked back, “
Bobby blinked down at Crowley's black suit up close, feeling confused as hell. Was Crowley doing it wrong on purpose? The demon had pressed his lips gently against the man's cheekbone, giving his bearded face a quick and careful peck. He let go and stepped away afterward, still wearing that smug look on his face. Bobby was stunned. What the hell was that? That wasn't the way demonic deals were sealed, was it? Why was Crowley being so weird? Why was the guy being so...
“Alright,” Dean said, his beautiful lips pouting slightly as he dug around in his jacket pocket, “This is how it's gonna work. Sam and I are going to do all the talking and you two are gonna keep your mouths shut. Especially you, shorty,” Dean warned, tossing an ID badge toward Gabriel, “No comments from the peanut gallery in there. I'm serious.”
*big giant hugs* As I stated at the end of part 8, I promise that there will be little to no real angst in this part. So get ready for the fluff and humor! (and plenty of smut) ;D I really hope that you all enjoyed this first chapter! I'm sure you all caught the reference, but when Jude first stepped out in his all white attire, Dean was referring to Lucifer's get-up from 'The End.' (Way too much white. Had to change out the ties. Lol) ;D And I know that you might have a few questions about the weddings, but more info will be divulged in next week's chapter. :) And I hope you're ready for some funny situations and character growth, 'cause it's all on the way! :D Thank you guys so so so so much for sticking with this story for so long and sharing your love with me! I seriously don't deserve any of you. You're all too precious for this world! :D
“I think it's time for the rings,” he called.
The anxious demon paced directly outside of the pantry door, listening for everything happening inside. He often flitted his eyes up to glance through the living room window in the distance, making sure that half of the family that had gone outside was still alive. At the kitchen table, Oliver sat with Charlie in his arms and Rowena rocked baby Katherine. Both kids were asleep – which was amazing, considering everything that was going on. Bobby and Meg were sitting at the table too, both watching the commotion outside. But Dean was standing with Clarence. The guy wasn’t pacing, but he seemed just as concerned.
A giggle escaped Jude's smiling lips. A bee hive? Really? That must have been some crazy-strong courage. Jude's eyes dropped back to the bottle in his hands and he just couldn't help himself. He really wanted to see if it worked, but more importantly, he wanted to see what it tasted like... The teenager gently popped the cork out of the bottle and brought it up to smell the contents. Rich hints of cinnamon, ginseng, and clover tickled his nose and made his mouth water a bit.
. The vibrating strings were playing a very specific melody, luring Jude closer like a bear to honey. It was the last verse of 'Hey Jude,' the part with all the '
“Which is why we ended up with fifteen bags of candy,” Sam added bitterly.
Clare couldn’t answer. Instead, he just smiled and held both arms out for his husband as hot tears rolled down his face. Jude all but fell onto the floor with him, happily collapsing into Clare’s arms so that they could cry and smile and cling to each other like gleeful little kids. Clare was sure that the rest of the people in the room were surrounding and watching them, but he didn’t care. He was too overwhelmingly ecstatic to be anything except
was the good stuff? What, no Bob Segar? No Foreigner, Kansas, or Rolling Stones? Not even the Beatles? Maybe Dean needed to reinstate that strike...
Then, with Death’s unholy scythe, Lucifer sought out and murdered all of the priests he could find. Countless pathetic apes were slaughtered before they even saw him, though some managed to beg for mercy before the end. Lucifer did his best to purge the world of all those foolish enough to worship God. The devil knew that his old man had a soft spot for those particular idiots, so he figured that killing them would be enough to upset God. But the big man still refused to show up.
Crowley, as usual, glared after his mother as she and Bobby headed out the door. Their absence left a sizable, heavy silence in Clare's bedroom between him and Crowley. Clare knew where the discomfort was coming from. Though he had never said it to Clare's face, it was obvious that Crowley did not like Meg. If Clare had to take a guess, he would say that Crowley and Bobby's morning argument was probably about Meg, too. Honestly, Clare thought that Crowley was acting a little childish about the whole thing, but he didn't want to bring any of that up. Not on what was going to be the happiest day of his life.
Sam and Gabriel both looked around for Dean and Cas before they finally spotted them near the fireplace. As soon as he saw the rest of his family, Dean wanted to spring to his feet and show off his kid. He wanted to present his little swaddled baby to his brother and show him how beautiful and tiny the little guy was. But Cas's weary head was still resting on Dean's shoulder and the man didn't want to disturb the weak angel. Luckily, Gabriel and Sam came to them instead.
“Good!” she said, “Vamos. We must take all of this food over to the playground before everyone gathers there. And I must pick up the rest of the family from the Winchester's place.”
Cas exhaled and readjusted himself, leaning close to kiss Dean's forehead before rolling back to stare up at the ceiling.
Jude smiled and glanced between his parents as he held onto the steering wheel, pulling a classic 'Dean' pose while he batted his 'Cas' colored eyes...
Cas turned to look up at the other voice that had spoken. There, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed against his plaid-clothed chest, was Dean’s brother Sam. There was a smile on his face as he gazed down at Castiel along with Dean.
Jessica's heart nearly leaped from her chest. Oh. Oh! Ollie was going to do it right now! He was going to propose right now! Jessica felt the urge to turn and look for her parents, to see if they were watching, but she couldn't turn her head. She was too focused on Oliver's lovely brown eyes.
“Whoa, thanks, Jude!” Jessie smiled.
“So, what about Michael?” Ollie asked, his eyes flickering between Jessie and Jude, “Is he, like, your uncle or something?”
Jude could feel his heart surging with pain. The lingering sorrow hidden in Clarence's voice was enough to let everyone know that he was telling the truth. Oh man, that was awful.
“Dude,” Dean called, gaining his brother’s attention, “Have you been to bed at all?”
“Those are their heads,” Jude explained, “I can feel their arms wrapped around each other. One of them keeps kicking their feet… I think it’s the boy. He must have liked the sound of your guitar.”
“Yes. I agree with Dean,” Cas huffed, “We must return to Earth as soon as possible. If Darkness has returned, the entire world is in grave danger. Including our children,” the angel paused and his eyes widened to full capacity, “J – Jude and Jessica are alone!”
“Here.”
“He followed us here on his bike,” Bobby finished, ignoring Crowley's comment.
Oliver couldn't help but be concerned about his new bride. Jessica had always been a 'suffer in silence' type, and that made it difficult to tell how sick she really was. Sharing a bath together – which was quite enjoyable – seemed to make her feel better. But, again, Ollie couldn't tell if her sickness had really gone away or if it was all a front to keep him from worrying. All he could to was keep an eye on his wife and make sure she was as happy as possible on their Honeymoon.
“Oh, you're getting married? That's awesome!” he beamed, “I'll have to see if I can get some time off work to come. It would be great to see Dean and Sam again. Do you guys want to come inside?”
' The voice in his head reminded bluntly, '
“Relax, babe. We're not actually going to hurt him. We're just venting,” Dean sighed, softly patting Cas's shoulder.
“Yeah, Jess?” he replied, not realizing that she was still awake.
“He was my main supplier,” Clarence admitted shamefully, eyes locked on the ceiling, “Usually, our transactions consisted of money... but there near the end, when I was about to go looking for the bunker, I was getting desperate for fixes, so I... I let him touch me to get it... And I hate myself everyday for doing that shit. I mean, h – how messed up do you have to be to let someone screw you for drugs?” Clare gasped, his tears falling faster as his breath hitched, “The worst part, was that I – I was so high all the time that I didn't even feel bad! I didn't feel anything! Even when I was being used, I just laid there and took it! God, what's wrong with me?! Why did I do that?! Why did I let that happen?! What was I – ?!”
Jessica actually gave a tiny giggle at her papa's dramatic instructions. Sam was glad that Gabe was able to make her feel better, but his method sounded a little dangerous. Turning people into glitter? Sure, it would probably be okay to do in a dream. But what if Jessica got scared in real life? What if she decided to use her grace on a real person?
“I... I am a sexy lady?” Cas repeated skeptically.
? Damn, Jessie wanted him
There were a few seconds which Jessica considered shouting to them and telling them that Lucifer was upstairs. She wanted to alert anyone and everyone to the fact that the devil had backed her into a corner and was forcing her to do something she didn’t want to do. But the thought of Charlie disappearing forever made her reconsider. If Jessica was to tell someone, Lucifer would probably fly away prematurely and keep Charlie out of spite. Or worse. He would
had amazing sex with Cas in the process. How could it get any better than that?
"I'm the person your mother used to work for," Crowley answered, "How old are you, boy?"
“Where have you been?” Bobby blurted.
?! When the old man turned to open the back door, Jude slid between him and Meg, wanting to use his physical body as a barricade between Meg and Clarence. Jude didn't care who he had to fry with his grace, as long as his future husband was kept safe.
“So, what's the story, Bobby?” Sam softly urged.
Dean slung Bobby's duffel bag over his shoulder before reaching down to loop his pinky finger around Cas's. The angel smiled at the action and glanced up to meet Dean's eyes with affection. The two of them were leading the way through the hotel lobby to get to the parking lot with Sam, Gabriel, and Bobby following quietly behind. Well,
Dean could feel a grin growing across his face as he sat and listened to Sam and Gabriel bicker like an old married couple. The fact that they actually
! The massive size was a little painful at first, but when Clare started to rock in and out, pleasure slowly started to take over. Clare was so focused on being careful that he didn't seem to be enjoying it very much. Jude reached up to cup the demon's handsome face as he worked, wanting to bring his attention back to the moment. And when their eyes met in mid-thrust, child-like vulnerability appeared in Clare's expression.
“Cas,” he heard Dean’s voice say again. “C’mon, buddy. That’s it. Open those eyes for me.”
Clare's hardy giggle shook the bed they were laying in and the heavenly sound made Jude's stomach tingle. After catching his breath, the demon discretely wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes and replied in a humored voice.
you, remember? She tried to
“I just want everyone to remember that this was not my idea, okay?” Dean said, “So when it inevitably blows up in our faces, I'm not to blame.”
“I'll be back before you know it,” Jude promised with a tender smile, “I love you with all of my -”
it, baby,” he answered truthfully, stepping over to touch the hood of the car, “but... None of this stuff is ours. I mean, it belongs to someone else, doesn't it?”
“It's never a good time,” Bobby replied, sounding kind of pissy, “How are things on your end?”
– and they all would have been crushed to death…
“Gabriel!” he groaned.
The angel was surprised to see the anger carefully melting away from Dean's face. As he stared at Castiel, Dean's glare was slowly easing and his eyes were becoming clear. It appeared as though some large lovely thought had crossed the man's mind as he stood up straight in Cas's arms. Dean looked as if he just realized something that gave him relief.
Jude’s eyes narrowed.
“Don't worry, little man,” Dean called, giving him a big smile, “Papa and I are gonna help you find the rest.”
“Well, if Charlie was any indicator, angel pregnancies are really fast, right?” Clare asked.
“Have fun, Jess,” he said quietly, “I'll see you in a few hours.”
Dean knew he was being pretty straightforward, but he really wanted to know what had came over his angel. The last time he saw Cas that day, the guy was holding a kid on a street corner and looked like a badass hero-warrior that didn't take bullshit from anybody. And now, the angel was like an excited puppy, pawing at Dean's clothes and biting down smiles. It was a drastic change and Dean wanted to know where it came from.
“You require food,” the angel mumbled.
“School?” she repeated, perking up in Gabe's arms, “I want to see!”
“I know,” Jess nodded with a wink.
Sam muted Gabe's yammering mouth with his own lips, wanting the guy to focus on actions rather than words. Their hands were pulling at each others' briefs under the water, tugging them off and letting their bare pelvises meet. A loud groan escaped from the depths of Sam's throat and echoed around the large room when he felt Gabe's thick thighs straddle his waist. Gabe was doing that thing he always did; teasing Sam by rocking his ass up and down the length of Sam's cock instead of letting it in. Dammit! Sam wasn't in any state for that shit!
“Clare,” Jude panted, rocking his hips a little quicker, “I'm really cl – close!”
“Dean, did you know about Michael and Adam’s child?” he asked softly.
“Of course we do, moose! The world depends on it,” Gabe snapped before smiling back at the crowd, “Alright folks, Picture it: Sicily, 1922 –”
Sam smiled as he lowered his head to meet the archangel's mouth again. His cheek stung a bit but it was totally worth it to taste the sweet flavor of Gabriel's tongue against his own. The two of them stayed in their passionate embrace until Sam felt a tap on his shoulder. He gently pulled away to look up and see Bobby standing next to them.
“Nah. I don’t really want to see anyone yet,” Jess admitted.
“Hmm,” Dean acknowledged, sliding a hand over Cas's bare stomach.
Dad glanced between Jude and Clarence and Jude tried his best to make his own eyes as big and innocent as possible. He really hoped that his parents would let him have some alone time with Clare. Luckily, Jude's dad let out an exhausted sigh and turned to look at the blonde demon holding the spare helmet.
,” Jude blurted, pushing up against the door for good measure.
“Anywhere he wants to go. It's his birthday,” Clarence answered simply, still wearing a cheeky grin.
“Thanks. I learned it from the best,” Gabe nodded.
"Oh my God!" Jude breathed, instantly looking away in discomfort and embarrassment, "Wh - why do you have those?!"
“Wha – what happened?” he asked, breathless.
Watching Ollie laugh and cry at the same time made Jess just as emotional and happy. The two newlyweds leaned into each other, both looking down to stare at the glowing skin beneath their hands. There had been so many dreams in Jess's life that terrified her; so many omens of bad things to come and moments that scared her.
“So, how are we supposed to lure this guy in again?” she asked.
“Bobby's behavior is abnormal,” Cas pointed out, leaving Dean's side to venture around the hood.
“I can't imagine what my life would have been like without you,” Clare admitted as he regained his playful smirk, “... and I can't imagine a future without you, either.”
At Castiel's back, the diner windows suddenly shattered, having been blasted apart with a large explosion. In the chaos of people running and screaming, Castiel briefly looked back to see that Gabriel was fighting off the assassins. He was using large bombs of his own grace to keep them away. But the assassins did not seem interested in Gabriel. No, their attention was on
?! This red-headed Scot was Crowley's
“Yes, I heard them,” Jude replied, keeping his voice soft, “But it doesn't matter. The world is being eaten alive and we need to do something about -”
“Are you still sure about this, love?” Crowley asked, searching Bobby's face with dark eyes, “Because now would be an appropriate time to back out. Before he gets attached and all.”
Unfortunately, when Jess got there, she was met with a worrying sight. Dad, Papa, and Ollie were all standing around the map table with pale faces. They were looking down at something on the table, but raised their heads to her when she entered. All of them seemed scared for some reason, lips turned downward and eyebrows curved.
“Fffffanks-giving,” she said, trying her best to repeat it.
Surprisingly, a flicker of a grin appeared on Sam's mouth. He instantly bit it down and nodded, but Jude was able to see that he was hiding humor.
Jessie smiled to herself, thinking about that pretty vase of daisies in grown-up Ollie's hands...
“Happy birthday, son,” Papa said.
“Have a lovely, whimsical holiday, you two,” Rowena sang.
“I'm aware of that, Dean, but I still wish to provide him with comfort,” Papa whispered back.
“Hey!” Oliver shouted.
The three of them - followed by Dickie the tiny Oompa Loopa, who had apparently stolen a skeleton bone from Jane's decorations and was now carrying it around - all journeyed into the main part of the bunker. Dean lingered back to take Cas's hand, the same warm and soft fingers he had been clinging to for most of the night, and noticed their son walking ahead of them. Jude's head was down and his feet were moving fast - but the back of his cape was lifted up, like there was something underneath it.
“Take it while I keep her occupied,” Dean hissed quickly.
Once they got their uncle Michael to finally join the Darkness fight, Jude and Jessica helped transfer their unconscious uncle Adam back to Bobby's house. Not only did they have to fly Adam there, but they also had to take all of the medical equipment attached to him too. They started by moving all of it close to the bed, even placing some of it on the bed with him, to form a neatly compressed package. Michael used his grace to keep electric current flowing to the machines so that they could transport him safely. Jude really hoped that uncle Bobby's study would have enough room to house all of this stuff and the people surrounding it. Otherwise, some of them might appear on top of the desk or something.
he little girl suddenly stopped wiggling in his arms. Sam looked down at her, wondering why she seemed so calm all of the sudden. She was staring back up at him and her usually emerald-copper eyes looked sort of
Less than a week before that moment, Jude had begged for just a single child. Now, he was holding
Jude gulped at the sound of Clarence's voice in the midst of his disturbing thoughts, tightening their fingers together. It was amazing how just the sound of Clare's voice was enough to calm Jude down...
“Of course,” uncle Cas almost whispered, his voice full of love, “It all began when your father was sent to Hell...”
“She gave it to me,” Gabe explained, “Told me to keep it away from Lucifer.”
As Sam and Gabriel glanced between them with hidden excitement, Dean and Castiel shared a look of equal confusion. Why were their brothers acting so bizarre? Had they been waiting for Dean and Cas to wake up all morning? What was so important?
The angel sighed once more and tilted his head back to look at the ceiling again. Ever since Clarence forced his way into the bunker the night before, Jude seemed very unlike himself. He was always running off and trying to spend time by himself, as if he didn't want to talk to anyone. But why? Did Clarence make him feel uncomfortable? What if the half-demon boy made a threat to Jude? Or insulted him in some way? Castiel didn't agree with Crowley's decision to leave Clarence in the bunker. This was the Winchester's home, not a daycare center for unruly teenage demons. There was no reason for him to be here, especially if he was going to make Jude uncomfortable.
“Bobby,” they said in unison.
' again, before the bright aura of his grace lit up the immediate area. The light was coming from Papa's neck, where it looked like he had sliced himself open. The golden glow poured out and drifted into the other glass vile, filling it and making it shine even brighter than Cas's. In the brief space of time that she could see, Jessie spotted Ollie frozen next to her and Jude and Clarence paused in the middle of hiding under the picnic table. She made sure to remember their locations because she knew that she was going to have to grab them and fly away as soon as time started.
“Ah.”
A tiny giggle came from Gabriel's side of the room and Sam paused to look at the archangel, who was grinning with a red face as if he was holding down more laughter. Obviously, Gabe and Jane were going to have lots of fun never letting Sam live down this catastrophe...
“I know what it is,” Sam interrupted, appearing just as uncomfortable, “Just, um. Just look around or something for a minute, okay? I've got to get some stuff.”
“Hmm. This word here is either 'witches' or 'pistachios',” Gabriel said as he followed the guys around the hood of the car.
“W – we will,” Jude promised bashfully.
“Yeah. Until every kid in his kindergarten class starts calling him 'Judy,' and then he'll be stuck with a girl's name forever,” Gabriel mumbled.
There was a moment of silence in which Dean and Jude shared a loving, father-son type of stare; one that Sam always wished he could have with John. Off to the side, Clarence swooned dramatically, tilting his head of stringy blonde hair with a smile.
"That one," Jessie chose, pointing to it on the screen.
“I’m sorry for yelling at you, Clare,” Jude said.
“I was pretty sure I killed you,” Lucifer lightly pointed out, tilting his head to the side.
Meg visibly swallowed as she looked back to Clarence. Jude's answer seemed to make her curious.
“Well, I had an exceptionally pleasant bowel movement this morning. Does that count?” Crowley mentioned, his tone full of sarcasm.
Before another word could be said, Dean reclaimed Cas's mouth. The two of them were kissing hard in the hallway, with Castiel's arms wrapped around Dean's neck and Dean's hands groping Cas's front and back. The man was still thrusting against the angel, moving their bodies in a way that mimicked intercourse, though they were still clothed and standing. Castiel responded earnestly to his husband's motions – until he heard a small 'thunk' to his left.
“Oh… Should I go, then?” she asked.
happy, Cas,” Dean replied, pecking another kiss against Cas's lips as the elevator began to drop, “and
wanted to have sex. But why so suddenly? And how did Gabriel seem to know that it would happen?
Gabriel took a bite out of his candy bar – where did he get that thing? – and shrugged his tiny shoulders with a batty look, doing a perfect impression of a daydreaming teenager. His golden eyes glanced toward their daughter a few feet away an he eased closer to talk lower.
Jude turned around just in time to see Adam's eyes fly open. The young guy on the hospital bed, who had been pretty much a vegetable since the moment Jude met him, was suddenly animated; reaching up to pull the vent out of his own mouth and take the oxygen tube from around his head. He removed everything in a surprised scuffle, as if he was clawing his way out of some nightmarish forest. With all the machines off, Adam sucked in a huge breath and raised to his elbows, where he looked around at everyone in total bewilderment. Jude was amazed. Grandpa fully restored Adam's health just by speaking his name...
“Yep. Still am,” Dean replied, gesturing to the wide hallway. “Looks like you are, too. Welcome home, Cas.”
After the words left his mouth, Jude cringed internally. Ugh, why did he say that? He could have said anything, but
Jude gulped again. Get rid of them? Uh-oh. What did that mean? The little boy suddenly remembered what happened to him and Daddy a long time ago in a gas station. Those two bad guys attacked and Dad had to shoot and stab them both. That was one of the scariest times in Jude's whole life. Did Dad and uncle Sam really do that stuff for a job?
“Yeah, we have to make sure that none of the lines are broken. Which is why I'm suggesting we use spray paint, this time,” Jess's dad added.
“Geez, babe,” he huffed, shaking his head with a smile, “I didn’t even hear you come in… What’s wrong?”
Most of you probably saw that coming, didn’t you? :( (I know. I’m the worst. Believe me, I’m crying with you.) :’( But! Before you write this story off as a complete tragedy, I really hope that you consider finishing next week’s chapter, because guess what? The king’s story isn’t quite over yet. ;) And before anyone makes speculations: No, Dean’s boyfriend and the king did
Uncle Cassie raised his head, looking away from Jess's work on his nails in order to search the rest of the group.
Gabriel beamed smugly at the red-haired kid next to him before he finally stepped to the side, revealing Jude and Jess still kneeling near the pool. When they heard the close voices, Jude and Jess looked up – and their tiny gasps filled the room.
“Yeah, I think he did,” Sam sniffled.
“A prep school? I didn't know Kansas had one of those,” he mentioned.
“And are we all pretty happy?” Gabe asked.
” Dean screamed, hoping his brother could hear him.
“I can hardly wait to hold your little one,” Ollie's mom continued to speak, “Nine months is such a long time to wait, but I will be ready!”
“Come now, darling. Don't waste those tears on me. There's nothing for you to be sorry for –
Just as he was in the verge of falling asleep, Jude felt Clare's moist mouth meet his own. The demon's lips were as sweet as ever; tender and loving as they gently smashed against Jude's. The angel deepened their sideways kiss, enjoying the goosebumps it left on his sweaty skin. Ugh, Clare was such a good kisser...
Though Jude appeared to be slightly unconscious, Castiel still took his distaste for flight into account when returning to the ground. Instead of flying there, Cas simply drifted down to gently land among their family. Everyone swarmed around Castiel and Jude as the angel knelt down to cradle his child's head in his hands. Jude's eyes were still closed, but he appeared to be fine. Dean was the first one to kneel next to Jude, followed by Clarence and the rest of their family.
Jessica took a deep breath as she adjusted the lacy veil around her blonde curls and bare shoulders. She was completely dressed in her wedding attire, standing next to her equally well-dressed Papa at the playground. Both of them were hiding behind Bobby's pickup truck, waiting for the bridal march to start. It wasn't quite one o'clock yet, so people were still arriving and claiming seats. Papa kept pacing and glancing at his watch, muttering curses under his breath.
“But?” Clare prompted.
Sam's blood ran cold and his feet stopped dead in their tracks.
,” Cas whined, voice echoing off the tiled walls.
“He seemed nice,” Clare nearly whispered, “I thought he genuinely wanted to help me. So of course I climbed up in his car to get warm. He asked me where my parents were, I told him that my house burned down and that I didn't have any. He had a bag of drive-thru burgers in his hand, but instead of just giving it to me, he told me to... to touch him first...”
“The dress is for breaking hearts and the boots are for kickin' butt,” uncle Dean added with a smile.
“You – you cannot deliver him, Dean,” the angel denied, trying to come up with a sound reason that wouldn't alarm him, “Because... Gabriel is the only one who can do it.”
Cas blinked toward him in surprise. Once he saw Dean, Cas seemed to relax a little bit, finally letting go of the arms of the chair to clutch his own stomach instead.
“And give you this,” Castiel hummed into Dean's ear.
“I'm not gonna let him hurt you, Sam!” Dean shouted, “You're my brother and I care about you! And I am not gonna stand by and watch you fall into another one of Gabriel's psychotic traps. I'm not gonna let him molest you against your will -”
The bunker was dark and quiet when they made it there, so the other boys obviously weren't home yet. Gabe was kind of bummed about that. He was sort of in the mood to get frisky with his moosie husband. Alas, Jessie helped her papa stumble all the way to her parent's bedroom, for which Gabe was very grateful. He was so full of alcohol that he could barely tell where he was going. But when they made it to the door, Gabriel made sure to give his daughter a giant hug.
Jude smiled, feeling so glad that Clarence's pain was gone. The sight of his smile alone was enough to make Jude feel at peace again. Clare must have known that Jude brought up the flowers to make him forget about his pain, because he seemed really touched by the remembrance of happy childhood memories. After wiping his eyes again, Clarence shifted on the bed to roll over with Jude, putting Jude on his back so that he could hover over him. Jude stared up at Clarence's face in the candlelight, studying his warm eyes with affection.
Jess grabbed the duffle bags from her aunt Rowena and walked over to place them on the far table for the guests, wanting to be of some assistance. Jess planned to go back to the couch to stay out of the way after moving the luggage, but when she turned around, uncle Bobby was standing there, looking directly at her. There was much less sorrow in his gray eyes than Jess was expecting. His lips pursed together in his silver beard before speaking.
“Leave it to me,” he graciously offered, sliding around the table to pat Jude's shoulder as he walked by, “I'll take care of it, little man.”
“Hold on a second. Let's recap,” Gabriel interrupted, sparing a glance among the faces in the kitchen, “Meg was held captive, drugged, raped, and left pregnant on the side of the road. But instead of accepting that she was pregnant, she freaked out, ripped Clarence out of her body, and threw him off a bridge? And his name is only 'Clarence' because of a note she kept in her pocket that she meant to give Cas but never did?”
“I don't want to,” Jude muttered, the fear in his voice making Castiel's heart break.
Dean slammed his foot to the gas pedal at once, hauling ass toward the demons on the corner. He was suddenly acting on impulse, giving his body over to his basic instincts. The sight of the daycare center woke up the hunter within him. The Impala raced toward the four demons and streaked through another lane of traffic to plow its way over a grassy area. The demons had already caught sight of the warhorse barreling for them, however, and they were running for the building doors like bats out of hell.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas mumbled, his blue eyes flickering from Dean's face to the floor.
Jess’s icy hands started to tremble as she clung to the cold metal Impala. Oh, no! She had forgotten the dogs! How could she have forgotten all the dogs?! If they were hurt, it was all her fault.
' in a warm, comforting way... and Jude's hand slowly let go. Clare smiled warmly at the sight of Jude backing away. It was working! Jude heard it! Luckily, Dean kept humming the song and Cas soon joined in. It wasn't long before their whole family – apart from Lucifer, who only stood by and watched – was singing the last verse of Hey Jude, crowding around Jude in a loving circle.
“What were you wrong about, Cas?” he asked.
“D – Dean?!”
“The other demons I've had in my time were such fighters. Always kicking, biting, screaming, clawing like animals. That's why I started to use opium on them. To calm them down... But Meg... She didn't fight,” he explained quietly, “Whenever she stirred from that heavy sleep, she only stared at me. Blinking. Such beautiful green eyes. It was as though she thought she
“Every corner of this place is committed to my memory, Dean. It wasn’t difficult to replicate,” Cas murmured.
by going for a stupid jog or eating a healthy breakfast. No, the best way to start any day was to be bossed around by an angel in a thong...
Gabriel let out a dramatic sigh and rolled his eyes before plopping himself down into the floor beside Dean. They were both kneeling in front of Cas then, hovering between the angel's knees.
“Okay,” he quietly permitted, “We'll go to the Eiffel Tower. But if you puke again, I'm calling your Papa myself.”
“Uh...” Dean said, briefly clearing his throat, “He... he asked you to marry him
Dean held out both items for Cas to take, but the angel hesitated. His glistening blue eyes finally raised up to look at the jar of honey and the sadness only magnified on his face. He slowly picked up the jar from Dean's hand and held it close while he wiped away his own tears. Dean wished that he could say something that would help Cas feel better, but he didn't know what to say. Because he wasn't sure what was making Cas so upset. A few seconds of silence went by – in which Cas stared powerfully at the honeycomb inside the jar – before he looked back at the man in front of him.
Seemingly out of the blue, the storage room door creaked open.
Dean’s mouth flooded with saliva as he gazed dreamily toward the wet, sexy, naked angel in front of him. Maybe Dean didn’t come back home. Maybe that portal brought him straight to heaven instead…
Dean had been monitoring his own facial expressions the whole time, trying his best to make it seem like he didn't know a damn thing about Cas being pregnant. But the moment he laid eyes on that precious little toy, all his defenses crumbled. Son of a bitch. He forgot that toy was in his pocket. And seeing those tiny wings and that soft black and yellow fabric instantly reminded Dean of all the sweet moments he had shared with his unborn kid over the past week; singing to him, feeling him move, watching him grow inside Cas's stomach... That little stuffed bee was the only linking factor Dean had to his own kid right now.
, Cassie. If that's not a dominant word, then I don't know what is.”
"'Night, Jess," Jude replied, giving her warm back a soft pat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gnah! Clare! Ah,
Every soul in Bobby's house was going to fight for Jude until he was free.
“I know,” he nodded, wrapping both arms around Sam's waist, “Take me home, moose.”
Instead of holding up the scythe to defend himself, Lucifer grabbed Adam and held him up as a human shield. The sight of his beloved little human in the path of his own blade was enough to stop Michael’s attack. A horrified expression came over his face and curled his sword strike outward, narrowly missing both Adam and Lucifer. With Michael now standing down, Lucifer raised up to kneel and hold Adam’s head with both hands. He panted and blinked toward Michael, enjoying the sight of absolute terror on his brother’s face.
Dean nodded and gave Castiel one more look of encouragement before closing his eyes. With Dean prepared, Castiel reared back the large scythe and swung it as forcefully as he could. The angel deliberately missed the top of Dean's head and spun all the way around to plunge the sharp end directly into Death's torso. Death never moved, even when the weapon entered his body. But Castiel forced the curved blade as far as it would go, glaring at the horseman through the blur of his own tears. Though he never said a word, Castiel projected all his blatant wrath through his lethal scowl alone.
“It’s an antidote. I keep a fresh bottle made, just incase my mother-in-law makes somethin’ unholy. It’ll get rid of whatever you took,” Bobby explained, holding it out further, “Go ahead. It won’t bite ya.”
“Milk-based powder? Bleck. That doesn't sound very appetizing,” Gabriel uttered, looking disgusted.
“Looks like you're right,” Sam said, leaning into the door to point inside.
“I need you, Gabe,” Sam mumbled, closing his eyes to picture his husband's face, “So please... Whatever it takes... Just get back to me...”
“Why don’t you check for the gender while you’re at it,” Gabe scoffed.
“No, no. That's alright. We can just, you know, go back through the portal,” Bobby mentioned.
Caldwell sighed and looked away, seeming a little shameful.
The thought of Clare knowing Jude so well made a new smile form on Jude's lips.
Dean smirked at Cas's relieved face as the elevator doors 'dinged' open behind them. The man tugged the angel on board and pulled him into a tight embrace. Dean traced his hands along the back of Cas's coat and lost himself in the angel's perfect eyes. Man, how did Cas get so hot? How much time did his dad have to spend making him? A few centuries, maybe?
Yep. Told ya. Worst cliffhanger ever. (Please don't kill me.) lol. :) I know it looks pretty bleak right now, but I promise that this is the worst part of the story. It's only gonna go up from here. :) I hope that Jude's birth wasn't too gross for you. And I know some of you are probably mad at me for making Cas deliver his own child,
While Jude often missed the warmth and comfort of the bunker, he did not miss having to sneak around to get intimate with Clare. His childhood home was often so crowded with people, he and Clare barely got to do anything dirty. But now that they had their own home, they were free to have sex wherever and whenever they wanted. Jude half expected Clare to lead him back into the living room so they could do it on the couch, which was what they normally did when they were in the mood after Clare came home from work. Instead, Clare pulled Jude back into their bedroom – which was lit up with multiple candles. They weren’t normal candles, however. These had blue flames, just like the ones Clare decorated the bunker with when he proposed to Jude. Jude paused their kiss to gawk at the gorgeous setting of their bedroom, fondly approving of how the blue light glistened on the framed map of the world that hung over their queen-sized bed. Clare beamed with pride as he slipped his own shirt up over his head to expose his bare chest.
Before Dean could raise a hand to defend himself, he was bashed over the head with something heavy, and his eyes closed as he slumped to the floor.
Ollie grunted and rolled away from Jess’s shaking hand, fighting to stay asleep. He mumbled something along the lines of ‘Dean came in and got her’, which Jessica found to be ridiculous. Uncle Dean wouldn’t come into their room in the middle of the night to get Charlie. Jess glanced at the clock near the bed, seeing that it was close to five AM. So it was almost morning, but still. It seemed suspicious…
“Hi,” he offered, glancing at the archangel, “Mike, who's this?”
“What did uncle Bobby bring you, little man?” he asked.
! Pretty glitter everywhere!” Gabriel smiled enthusiastically.
Clarence. Jude wanted to be strong and keep his feelings to himself. Because even though Jude was sort of losing him, Clarence seemed more excited than ever about getting a new home. And Jude didn't want to ruin it...
“And no pit stops,” Gabe called after them, “Just straight to bed!”
“I – I'm gonna use the bathroom,” Sam lied, quickly striding toward the door, “I'll be right back.”
Beside them, uncle Bobby and Crowley were exasperated by Clare's lack of discretion.
“Um, sure. Let's go with that,” he answered carefully.
“Yes!” Jessie shrieked, “It looks like they tried to summon the warlock or something, but the garage is empty and the portal is broken! Could they be in Hell? How are we going to get to them, Papa?!”
“H – He... moved,” Dean breathed, feeling moisture swelling in his own eyes.
Clare knew what the Darkness was doing. It was trying to use his past trauma to haunt him; to weaken him to the point that he would give up. But the joke was on Darkness. Clarence relived this nightmare all the time. It couldn't possibly hurt him anymore.
Dean's smile slowly returned as he nodded. As usual, Cas was able to comfort and encourage him all at once. And he believed everything the angel said. With Cas, Dean could do anything...
“Yep,” she smirked, “That's the guitar pick Jimi Hendrix used at Woodstock back in '69.”
Ahh, finally. I think we can all breathe a little better now that the warlock is gone. Especially Clare. ;) I know that his sudden turn on Clare might have seemed a little abrupt, but Caldwell genuinely had no idea that Clare was going to marry Jude. And he was not on board with the homosexual lifestyle. (Sound like Eddie Thompson, much? Lol) ;) And I couldn't help but give that final kill to Jessica, because after everything he did, the warlock deserved to die by a woman's hand. Plus, Jessie really needed that kill. She blamed herself for what happened to Crowley, and now she feels like she righted a wrong. :) I promise that the warlock is offically dead. We won't have to see or hear from him ever again. :) And yay! Crowley is back! The old sass master is safe and sound. ;) I really hope you all enjoyed the chapter! Thank you so much for reading and commenting! The next chapter will be out soon! :)
Castiel swallowed harshly when he saw the look of horror in his brother's golden eyes. Judging by the sheer amount of blood spatter on the archangel's clothing and the look of stunned remorse on his pained face, Castiel realized that Gabriel had stayed behind on purpose to take care of the assassins. He most likely killed them all in order to save his family, even though he clearly did not want to. Gabriel's golden eyes flickered downward to the bloody angel blade in his hand before he cast the weapon away, discarding it with revulsion as if it were riddled with disease.
“No one is at fault, Dean,” Cas instantly corrected, letting go of Dean's hand to touch his face instead, “I'm simply pointing out the correlation between your dislike of flying and Jude's refusal to use his grace.”
“It really works,” Clarence promised confidently, “I tried a sip before I bottled it up, and I was pretty sure that I could fight a hive of bees with my bare hands.”
Crowley sighed loudly as he stuffed his hand further into his pocket and rolled the top of his cane around with the other. Ah, shit. Dean could feel a damn monologue coming on...
“Of course I have, Dean,” Cas replied, “It's my most cherished possession.”
Father. That is madness.”
“Isn't it obvious?” he asked, feeling a smile grow on his face, “We just have to kill Death.”
” the archangel mumbled, “
“Uh... I love you, too..? What the hell's going on?” he asked.
“He's still not answering,” Sam mumbled anxiously.
“It's okay,” Jess whispered only for him, squeezing his hand, “Take your time.”
“This is an outlying suburb of New York City,” the warlock explained, gently leading Clarence toward the front door of the house in front of them, “Clarence, when I asked you to tell me about your life, you mentioned all of the... painful horrors you went through. And I have to tell you, it broke my heart. Knowing that you, my innocent child, had to endure senseless abandonment and rejection, well... It forever changed me. My heart now belongs to you, too.”
Throne room? Oh, they were definitely in Hell. Crowley spent most of his time stuck up on that little throne of his. Dean continued to be dragged for several minutes, passing various groups of chattering demons until he heard a set of heavy doors ‘thunk’ open. The loud sound made him flinch a little bit, but no one noticed him move.
“I know,” Papa replied.
“Don't push it,” Sam mumbled.
painted on his child's face. Jude looked absolutely
After stopping his own flow of tears and wrapping Clare into a tight hug, Jude took one more glance at the empty space next to them. He had just enough time to notice that a bright rainbow had formed in the clouds above the scene before he closed his eyes and whisked his fiance away in his arms.
choose revenge over his own kid! He would
Castiel was able to hear Gabriel asking Jessica a few more questions about her future children as the line went dead. The thought of Jessica having children with Oliver made Castiel wonder about his own offspring. Would Jude and Clarence be just as blessed? Would they, too, be able to have children? Castiel certainly hoped that his child would have the same type of blessings as everyone else. Someday in the future, perhaps.
the one who taught him the dark craft. He was a clever boy. Picked things right up. I was... sweet on him. For a long time... But when he told me he was goin' off to destroy Hell, I told him he was a bloody mad man. In all that time we spent together, I never realized that he was slowly morphing into a nutter.”
“Because I told him everything,” the archangel explained, “and I continue to remind him, all the time, of how we are only alive and well because of the heroic actions of our nephew and his family. And how your victory over Darkness, Jude, has allowed us to love each other without fear or regret... So, yes. It would be an honor to attend your wedding. If it is possible, we will be there. Thank you very much for your invitation.”
Dean glanced back at Cas's lovely face to take in the sight of his gorgeous blue eyes again. It was no wonder why Bobby and Crowley had stared at each other so deeply. That first time Dean saw Cas again, he couldn't help but stare at him for hours, unable to fully comprehend that he was back. Dean's hand tightened around Cas's as he looked back to smile at Bobby. He was glad that the old man was happy for once. Sam and Gabriel seemed just as glad, smiling toward Bobby as they wrapped an arm around each other.
“Gee, I don't know, who was it that took off in his Impala and disappeared for a whole night when he found out that his angel was pregnant?” he mentioned, laying the sarcasm on as thick as he could, “Don't you think that guy could offer Oliver some good advice right about now?”
Bobby only nudged his demon husband and gave him a stern look as if he thought that comment was over the line. But staring at Crowley actually gave Gabriel an idea. The guy was the king of Hell, right? He would know how Lucifer and Michael were doing in their cage, wouldn't he?
“Jessie, y – you've always been my angel,” he said softly, “... Will you... Will you be my wife, too?”
“Please tell Castiel that I'm very proud of him,” he requested with a smile, before pausing to roll his eyes a little, “And please tell Gabriel to stop sending me junk mail. That stuff really clogs up my inbox.”
Oliver hung up the phone before he heard the rest of his father's question. He was suddenly in panic mode. How could this be happening? A ghoul had his father locked him in a strip club and was trying to eat the guy!
Jude's blue eyes widened and darted back to search Clare's face with alarm.
Hoping to ease his child's distress, Castiel eventually climbed out of bed and wandered over to sit at Bobby's desk. The angel's trench coat was hanging off the back of the desk chair and when Castiel sat down, he dove his hand into one of the pockets, searching around for the items he had hidden there. He retrieved both the jar of honey that Dean had given him and the stuffed bee from Gabriel's dog and placed them on the desk. For a while, Castiel simply stared at both objects and allowed his mind to wander.
“Oh, come on, Lucifer. We both know that isn’t true.”
Jane finally turned to walk away and everyone waited by the door until she was out of sight. Sam expected Oliver to become worried about being left behind with a bunch of guys that he barely knew, but surprisingly, the kid stayed as happy as ever. He blinked up at the Winchesters with incomparable joy, holding onto his unicorn with both fidgety hands.
Jude could tell that his boyfriend was excited about Chicago just by the twinkle of determination in his earthy eyes. Clarence was the only person in the room wearing a smile, too. Everyone else was still somber from the events that had taken place – and were
And it was over faster than Jude could blink his eyes. In fact, it was the easiest flight of his life. Jude held still after it was over and kept waiting for nausea to creep into his stomach to make him sick, but it didn’t. He felt completely normal. The only thing he could feel coming from his grace was acute hunger and thirst. Ugh, he needed a meal so badly. Upon landing in the dark, dusty, cold room, Papa immediately reached up to hold Jude’s head with both hands and look him in the eye.
“This thing on?” he asked.
“But we're not. At least, I don't think,” Dean pointed out, pausing to look around, “Where the hell are we? Maybe we
“Do you feel faint? Do you need to lie down?” he asked.
“I only wanted to see him,” Rowena explained with a smile, seeming indifferent to the dangerously angry hunter in front of her, “Fergus kept going on about how sweet and powerful the little tyke was and I thought I might steal him away for a wee bit to see -”
“We always do,” Clare agreed, waving them off.
” Jessica cried again, shaking her head as tears blurred her vision, “I won't leave him!
He hung up the phone and dropped it to the floor before anything else could be said. Luckily, the interruption wasn’t enough to get rid of Jude’s growing horniness. In fact, as soon as his hands were free, Jude reached down to grab Clare by the shoulders and hoist him back up to a standing position so that their mouths could meet again. The tiny ‘mmm’ that vibrated their kiss made Jude ache inside. He stepped out of his pants just in time to topple onto their bouncy bed.
Before anyone could ask question, Rowena reached behind the caldron and brought forth
Though he seemed kind of shocked by her answer, Ollie quickly nodded his head in the dark.
“What's the matter, Gabe? You don't want her to go to school?” he gently pressed.
Michael actually rolled his eyes at Lucifer's comment, but it made Jessie's skin crawl. She hated thinking that the devil might actually get to sit on her grandpa's chair... While everyone stood in the kitchen talking, Jess noticed Jude carefully slide inside the room. His head was down and the sad look still remained on his face. Why was he so sad?
Then, the demonic aura flickered out of Meg’s body. Her hand slipped away from Cas’s face, painting five red streaks of blood across his cheek, chin, and bottom lip from each of her fingers. And she was soundless and still in the angel’s arms. Dean could feel hot tears racing down his own face as he looked from Meg back up to Cas. The angel only sat there with a blank look on his face for a few seconds, seeming unable to process that his most cherished ally and friend had just died in his arms. The blood on his face and clothes made Dean ache on the inside.
“I can't help it, Fergus! You and Robert are both so dashing. I'm witnessing a miracle!” she sniffled back.
The bright morning sun was shining down on the building, but Oliver knew it was going to be dark inside. He stomped up to the front door and swung his ax at the wood near the handle, chopping out huge chunks. Once it seemed fragile enough, Oliver kicked in the door, ripping the wood away from the handle and allowing it to swing open. He stomped his way inside afterward, pausing to let his eyes adjust to the difference of light so that he could see the inside of the building. Empty chairs near the stage were knocked over, several bottles of alcohol were broken on the floor, and the sounds of a scuffle were coming from the other side of the room. With his ax in hand, Oliver tilted his head down and started for the source of the commotion.
“Indeed,” Cas carefully agreed.
In the doorway of the study, Bobby simply froze and blinked several times. It was as if he was trying to process what he just heard, like his brain was attempting to compute the information but failing. After several moments of blank staring, the old man eventually huffed a breath and turned around.
The Winchester brothers both shot Gabriel a brief look of annoyance, but Cas nodded in Dean's hands. After getting his angel's answer, Dean felt confused. How could someone – especially an angel – get sick just from having sex? He and Cas didn't eat anything weird last night. And they certainly didn't shove any foreign objects up their asses... So, what was making Cas so sick?
The guy in the denim jacket slowly rolled his head back to finally look Cas in the eye. When he spoke, his voice was low and full of pity, almost like a doctor with bad news.
“Are you telling me that you're pregnant, Cas?” he asked breathlessly, as if the wind had been knocked out of him.
“I just w – want a baby, too.”
Not only was Ollie one of Jessica's best – and only – friends, but she knew from her dreams that she and Ollie were going to be together for a very long time. It seemed like they were going to be buddies forever. But when Jess made the suggestion, Daddy coughed loudly and stepped forward to wag his finger in protest.
,” Dean shouted through gritted teeth, punching the floor to fight the pain.
Before Dean could react, one of them reached out and yanked his shirt away from his face. Once they saw him, the smiles on the mens’ faces disappeared. They must have known who he was.
“It's okay, Jessie rabbit. No one is ever ready,” Papa explained as he helped raise her legs onto the bed, “That's just the way life goes, sweetheart.”
Sam held up a hand to let Dean know that he was going to take care of it as he stood up and ushered Gabriel toward the door. Bobby stepped out in the hallway too, probably wanting to make sure he got his cell phone back in one piece. While Gabriel started off for a different room, Sam paused to look back at the bed.
“J – just a few minutes,” Jude slowly answered, curiosity getting the best of him, “Clare, What's that?”
Dean was glad to see the look of disgust and bitchiness on Crowley's face. In that moment, everyone knew it was true; that Crowley really did come to thank them for taking out his competition. He was just too proud and stubborn to admit it. And Dean was glad that Gabriel had pointed it out and put that look on Crowley's face. It was flat-out priceless.
While Clare excitedly freaked out over the familiar wooden stand, Grandpa pulled out the drawer and reached inside. He withdrew a small black book from the table, and when he shut the drawer back, the whole table disappeared; fading back into the moist dirt from which it came. But the book remained in Grandpa's hand. Still nice and dry from the rain, Grandpa walked over to hold out the book to Clare with a vibrant smile.
“I will,” Clare answered, sounding determined.
Cas didn't answer Dean's question. The angel was probably too busy turning red and palming at Dean's groping hand to have even heard the words. Oh, but Gabriel had heard them perfectly. His stupid grin vanished for a second before crawling its way back. Dean caught that the archangel did a flicking motion with his hand but didn't think much of it. Maybe it was just some weird gesture for trying to rid his mind of the memory of Cas's moans or something.
Sammy grinned down at Gabe, having heard his dirty comment. The two of them playfully shoved on each other as they made their way around the SUV to climb inside. Sam took the seat in the middle row next to Jessie, which meant Gabe had to take the one in the very back with the two boys. But he didn't mind. From that seat, Gabe could play with Sam's hair all he wanted. Dickie was safe in Jess's lap by the time the last door shut and the engine started up. Dean paused to turn around and smile from the driver's seat.
“Yeah, we should,” Dean mumbled, “Can you reach my phone?”
“I assumed that you would be hungry when you returned, so I retrieved some food for you,” the angel said, holding out the things in his hands.
“I'm not little anymore, Dad,” Jude reminded sweetly as he watched his parents go.
“Will you help me eat this?” Sam asked, lifting his eyebrow, “... Eh?”
Even though she wasn't laughing anymore, Jessica still had a strong urge to pee, and it was only getting worse. Hoping to make it to the bathroom before she ruined her silver bridesmaid dress, Jessica quickly grabbed Ollie's shoulder and the back of her chair to hoist herself up. It was crazy how much her legs had to strain now that she was carrying a little extra weight. Ollie's brown eyes glanced up to look at her face, probably seeing if anything was wrong.
“Wha -?” he managed to say.
Sam and Gabriel stole a quick glance of equal confusion.
“What did the lady look like, son?” Cas asked.
“What are you doing here? I thought you guys were finding outfits for the weddings,” Clare explained.
Even when everyone started to claim spots around her, and she was in the midst of her own fantastic party, Jessica still felt distant. How could she have fun now when she was destined to be alone in the future? What was the point of putting effort into a party that wasn't going to last very long? Wouldn't having fun with the people she loved just make it feel worse when they weren't there anymore? Pretty soon, Jess was staring sadly at the floor again, hugging her knees and listening to Papa, Cas, Clare, Rowena, and Jane all laugh and tell stories. Jess was starting to think that they had forgotten about her too, until uncle Cassie held out a glass of wine toward her.
Dean paused to take another bite from the pie, half because it tasted really good and half because he was trying to stall for time to come up with a good answer.
was the kind of support and love that every father needed to give their children. Sam was such a good Dad. Oliver hoped that someday he could be half the father that Sam was...
“Wait,” Castiel breathed.
. Batman doesn't like killing other people, even the villains... But, sometimes... Sometimes he doesn't have a choice. There are times when Batman has to use a gun, even when he doesn't want to.”
"Lay it on me, buddy," Dean urged, digging into the pie for himself, "Tell me what's eating you."
Jess eventually feel asleep around two o’clock that morning, after changing Charlie’s diaper. She didn’t wake back up until one of her husband’s deep, rumbling snores shook the bed. She grumbled at the irritating sound and rolled over, hoping to drown out the noise by raising the blanket over her ears. But as she rolled, she glanced toward Charlie’s crib – and noticed that one side was down. Jessica instantly sat up and blinked several times toward the crib in the dark, unsure if what she was seeing was true. But the crib was open… And Charlie was gone.
Castiel expected Dean to scoff at his 'human' distress or ask him why he couldn't just heal himself. But – to the angel's great surprise and awe – Dean didn't say a word. He simply nodded and rose from the bed to retrieve their clothing from the floor. The man took the time to step into his own pants and underwear and toss on a t-shirt before striding back to the bed to hold out a free hand to Castiel.
Gabriel was correct. Castiel was in for one hell of a night...
"You keep talkin' like that, and the odds of you cuddlin' up to me tonight will be even slimmer," he hissed on the way by.
“Well,” Gabe began, stealing a quick glance toward Jude and Jess a few feet away to make sure they couldn't hear, “Jane called last night and asked if it would be okay if she brought Oliver over this morning instead of this evening – ”
“Yes,” the demon king replied, “The children will have to search for Michael on foot.”
Meg carefully raised her head to meet Clare's eyes again.
Air vanished from Dean's throat as he felt a gust of wind sweep him away. Cas suddenly teleported out of Bobby's kitchen – and accidentally took Dean with him. The man gasped and held on tight to his husband's broad shoulders, feeling his feet lift from the floor. For a few moments, it seemed like they were flying all over the place. Flashes of darkened scenery blurred around them like crazy, turning Dean's stomach sour with the violent flight. It was like Cas was searching the whole free world for their child; like fire blazing through a haystack to find a needle.
“You destroyed my home, harmed my favorite dogs, threatened the lives of my children… Of course I’m against you. You were against me first,” the golden archangel stated.
“Are you sure that'll work?” Bobby asked.
Dean gulped, feeling like he had the wind knocked out of him. His kid already loved him back? His kid actually got
Dean was thoroughly lost and angered. He didn't like how Bobby and Crowley were staring at each other so intimately. Bobby, whose cheeks were still red, held out his hand, physically demanding his hat back. Though his hand was stern, his face was much more gentle, holding the subtle hint of amusement and playfulness. Dean could feel himself starting to glare toward Bobby. Why was he smiling like that?! At
“Can you give my bee to me?” he requested.
“I guess I'll take whatever I can get, then,” the demon grinned, “Can I at least kiss the cook?”
“It's alright, Cas,” he soothed, “Don't listen to Gabriel. He's just being -”
After hanging up his phone, Jude continued to glance between the road and Oliver’s pale face. The poor guy looked like a zombie; gripping his face with both hands as his mouth dangled open.
“Open it and see,” he urged.
Jessica and Oliver didn't make it to the Eiffel Tower.
“Yeah, but we're not going in,” Oliver assured, “I'm just gonna stop by, show my face, and leave. We might miss laser tag, but we are definitely gonna see Die Hard. I promise.”
Clare's eyes suddenly flashed black.
… He hurt
Sam and Dean shared a glance of astonishment as the girl took a large breath of air. Holy shit, Gabriel had just brought her back to life. They had just witnessed a freakin' miracle! But their amazement was quickly turned into confusion as they watched the little girl begin to whimper and wiggle in Sam's arms. She pushed herself out of Sam's grasp to climb to the floor, where she looked around in fright. Her blue eyes were blinking up at the strange men in horror – before they fell on Cas.
“Hey! You can't go! Come back here!” Oliver called.
“Family?” she repeated, “Cas, I already told you, I'm not -”
belong to him, and Death had no reason to cover for him. Once Castiel said it out loud, Clarence could feel every eye in the room glance toward him. Of course, they were all worried and concerned that he would be upset about hearing that his father was a liar – but Clare kind of saw it coming. Of course the asshole was a liar. Every other man from Clare's past was a liar. What made this shit-heap different from the others?
“Sure,” he agreed, kissing the baby’s forehead before shifting her around and holding her out to Jess, “Here. I’ll let you girls get ready. In the meantime, I’m gonna call mom and ask her if she’ll bring me a new toothbrush on her way over.”
Dean briefly tore his eyes away from Chuck to look down at his son, who was holding up the necklace in front of Dean's bare chest. The same small charm that Dean wore for most of his life was now shining brightly, glowing in the palm of Jude's tiny hand like a beacon. The sight of it was confusing at first. How the hell was it shining like that? Was Jude using his grace to light it up? It was only after a few moment of concentration and thought that Dean remembered what Cas told him all those years ago.
Cas huffed a breath of exhaustion, though his smile stayed.
“Of course, Jude,” Papa said with a small smile as he reached up to cradle Jude's head, “I have healed your father's post-alcohol sickness many times.”
Before they could hear any more of the news report, uncle Bobby's television shut off – and so did the lights in the house. Jude sucked in a breath of air and slid closer to Clarence in the dim room, realizing that the power had been shut off. Bobby tossed his remote away and turned to look at the teenagers with wide eyes. It seemed like he was just as shocked by the power going out as they were.
” Jessie gasped, reaching up to latch both of her arms around Sam's neck, “No, Dad! We can't go home yet! This trip is my birthday present!”
Jude's mouth slowly fell open as he carefully took the bottle from Clare's hand to look at it closely. When the liquid slashed around, more golden tones appeared near the edges that quickly faded back into red. It was so beautiful. Magical. And Clarence had spent several weeks making it. That was so sweet...
Instead of replying, Gabriel just turned Sam around and shoved him back into the motel room, putting him directly in Jessica's view. Their daughter was sitting up in bed with her bunny cradled close, seeming confused about waking up alone. As soon as she saw her daddy, Jessie crawled toward the end of the bed and climbed off to get to him. Sam slowly knelt down and watched her come closer, feeling his own face drain of blood. Oh, man. He was
Through the doorway, Jess could still see her uncle Cas kneeling on the floor and speedily praying at Adam's bedside. Dean had joined him on the floor and was rubbing Cas's back, but his eyes were vacant. He was too lost in his own emotions to really help Cas pray. Michael was standing like a protective beacon on the other side of Adam's bed, staring down at the unconscious guy with a pitiful look from above. Poor Clarence was a frantic mess, demanding answers and courses of action from Bobby, Crowley, and Rowena, but they told him that there was no spell strong enough to help. Everyone was out of options. And with Lucifer gone, their numbers were shrinking too. Jude's rescue party didn't have anything to go on – except the hope that grandpa Chuck might help.
“Marry my son,” Dean answered, letting a smile spread on his lips, “Fix up old cars with Bobby. Help Crowley run things in Hell. Let Rowena pamper the shit out of you. Hang out with the kids. Hang out with us. Live your life the way you want.
Jessica slowly let go of Dickie and took her things to hug them to her chest. She pecked her bunny with a lazy kiss before blinking up at Sam.
“Open your eyes, Jay,” Clare breathed eagerly.
a new baby...
“Me too,” Jess mumbled, biting the edge of her own grin as she hesitantly slid his foot away with her own, “but remember what we agreed on.”
when he came near? Already? Even though they had never even met before? That... that was so
“Papa, Papa! You has to wake up!” Gibson said.
“Jess, you – you're amazing,” he kept going, struggling for words, “You are so sweet, and funny, and beautiful, and brave. You can fly around and punch warlocks in the face, and its so cool... and kind of scary...”
... then, yeah. I want to remember you,” she answered.
A really happy smile slowly bloomed on uncle Cassie's face, making his eyes look so big and blue in the dim light. He stepped closer and gently sat down on the empty part of Jude's bed. Jude and Jessie both snuggled close to each other, getting excited to hear a new bedtime story.
“Nothing, he's fine. Just loves his moose,” Gabe chuckled nervously, “Anyways, I was just about to make us all some breakfast! Who wants pancakes?”
“What's wrong with Dickie?” Sam blurted.
“I did everything I could to get your attention, and now you show up at the last second?! Only
“Dean,” Castiel said quietly.
, Gabe. We can't let Bobby go there alone,” Sam reminded as gently as possible, “Besides, what better way to teach our kids about the importance of the buddy system than by giving them an example?”
Castiel shifted around, feeling a light tap on his face. His vision at last began to focus, and he could see the outline of a face. Not just any face, but the face he had memorized by heart. But it couldn’t be real.
Dean rolled his eyes. Really? Crowley thought he had to make a jab at Cas in order to make Dean comply? The balls on the guy...
“Here. This might make you feel better,” Dad murmured as he reached into his pocket.
As Jude momentarily lay naked and alone, his emotional turmoil ultimately got the best of him. He hugged himself and closed his eyes, causing hot tears to streak down both sides of his face. Apart from Clare, there was only one other person that understood Jude’s pain… and Jude was finally ready to be honest with him.
Dean raised the hem of his shirt to cover his mouth and nose as he crept along, trying to filter out the stench as he breathed. At the edge of the nearest pile of bricks, Dean caught sight of an old truck on the other side of the street. It looked to be in usable condition, as long as no one else was around to claim it. Dean’s head was on a swivel as he cautiously jogged out into the road. Along the way, however, he noticed two figures wandering around in the dusty air to his left. They were talking lowly and laughing, which made Dean think they were friendly. He couldn’t see any weapons on them, but that didn’t mean they didn’t have any. Dean was tempted to call out to ask what the hell happened to this place and if he really was in Eunice, and maybe ask where the nearest gas station was. But he decided against it. They may have been locals, but he had seen enough horror movies – and lived enough of his own life – to know that interacting with strangers in a foreign place was a dumb move. Self-reliance had saved his life plenty of times.
After staring into each other’s eyes for a few more seconds, the two of them plunged back into an emotional kiss. It went on long enough to pump Dean’s erection back to life before Cas pulled back to sigh erotically.
Ollie sighed and looked down at his hands again. Everyone was quiet as they watched him reach into his pocket and pull out his car keys. He sat them on the back of his car and finally raised his head to look at his mom.
“Of course I do,” Papa answered sincerely, though he shook his head, “but this... This is a very sudden and undeveloped plan. Perhaps we should ask Dean if -”
glance, Clarence met eyes with Dean... and raised a middle finger toward him with a smirk. At this point, Dean was already in a state of shock and couldn't properly respond to the playfully rude gesture. Clarence slipped back out of the kitchen without a word, leaving the place as silent as before.
Though he wanted to obey Dean's words, Castiel found that he couldn't stop worrying about it. While Dean shifted around in the bed to grab a nearby bottle of lubricant, Cas tilted his head back on the pillow to glare upward yet again. His eyes were fixed on the gray surface above him but his mind was reeling on the memory of Jude being so distraught. Castiel wanted his son to be happy always; to smile and laugh and feel comfortable in his own home. But how could Jude do those things if a stranger was going around threatening to set him on fire?
“And in three days’ time, the angels will attack,” Cas reminded, blue eyes finally finding Dean’s face. “I intend to get you home before then. Tell me, this portal you came through, how was it made?”
“I love you too, Dean,” Cas whimpered.
The elder archangel smiled politely from inside his dark vessel.
“It's a freakin' roach farm over there,” Dean mumbled.
“Very well,” the angel allowed, “But, even though we are reenacting our last visit here, I don't think we should use any grace this time.”
“Okay. Well, has daddy ever laid a hand on you?” the archangel asked.
“And when, um, when it happens... When they turn celestial...” Sam edged off again, urging Dean to finish the statement.
Yeah, I know. I'm a terrible person. I let Gabriel destroy the Impala. :( But don't worry! Everything is going to work out, I promise! *spoiler alert* The Impala will be fixed. :) Also, I know a lot of you have talked about it, but unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) Cas doesn't find out about Dean planting the walkie-talkie. I wanted to keep Cas on Dean's side for most of this story and I knew it would break his heart, so I kept him in the dark. I imagine that he would react similarly to how Sam acted in this chapter after Gabriel did the booth thing; embarrassed, violated, outraged... but still able to forgive him. Because Cas loves Dean so much that he will always forgive him. Eventually. ;)
“Dickie! You look so
.' But Dean wasn't going to kill the dude. No, no. He was going to do much better than that...
“Well, that makes two of us,” Uncle Gabe sighed, patting Jude’s shoulder, “Don’t worry, sidekick. I’ll gather up some grub. Whatcha craving?”
boning
While the two of them shared a few chuckles, Dickie hopped up into Gabriel's lap. The dog seemed to want to be included in the conversation or something, because he barked once and glanced between his two humans with hopefulness. Gabriel's grin simmered into a smirk as he reached down to pet his favorite canine.
“Bullshit?” Michael repeated.
“Where is Castiel?” she demanded, face void of expression.
from love – born of it, raised in it, and ultimately exudes it – he would be able to wield it like a weapon. And love itself was the only weapon that would ever stand against Darkness. Though we owe much to Jude for acting it out, all of you had a hand in its destruction, simply because you were willing to love and support him.”
for his niece. He, too, remembered what it was like to find out about the gender of his child. Being pregnant with Jude was an experience that Castiel would treasure forever, and he knew that Jessica would feel the same way.
Clarence must have had a pretty boring first night in the bunker, because everything was quiet the next morning.
A quiet '
“Hey, Bobby! They're up!” he shouted outside.
“I love you, son,” Cas whispered, breathing in his lovely scent.
"I'm sure it's great. But I'm not hungry," Clarence huffed, running a quivery hand through his stringy hair, "You go ahead without me, Jaybird. Get your belly full. I'll see you later, okay?"
“Don't listen to him, Sam,” Gabe pleaded, “He's just trying to -”
Michael suddenly raised up from the bed, and Jude realized that the archangel’s expression had changed. He wasn’t worried, or upset, or even mad. Michael’s face was blank; like a soldier prepared for duty. His gray eyes were straight forward, and his voice was soberly calm when he spoke.
you – for as long as this body draws breath and even from beyond the grave. You are truly the love of my life and the reason for everything I do. And I vow to be your partner forever.”
“Yeah,” Dean confirmed. “See, after we put Michael and Lucifer in the cage, some Leviathan broke out of Purgatory and started hassling Earth. Some douchebag named Dick Roman was their leader, we tracked him down to gank him… Anyway, long story short, you and I ended up in Purgatory together.”
“Yeah, it kinda does,” Ollie mumbled in agreement.
. That potion bottle was the same one he left by her side when he went to see her for the last time; when he forgave her for everything she had done to him. Meg wasn't looking for her rapist. She was looking for
“Kill me,” the devil demanded.
“Gabriel,” Sam called again.
With the impending arrival of Jane's family stirring them into action, the Winchesters began to 'cleanse' the bunker. They transferred everything of supernatural origin to the lower levels of their home and sealed it there, hiding it away from prying eyes. With the use of his grace, Gabriel stored all of the bookshelves of the library in the garage, and placed a few rows of beds in its place. He theorized that if they kept all of Jane's family in one place to sleep, they would be easier to 'manage' and keep an eye on. No one disputed the archangel's suggestion. Though, the library looked quiet different with beds instead of bookshelves.
“Ah, That – that feels so good, Dean,” Castiel praised, tugging at the man's jeans.
“Is it supposed to feel sticky?” he asked, turning to look at Gabriel.
In the haze, Dean caught sight of the last demon trying to scramble toward the nearest window. The hunter quickly clutched his knife and ran to grab the demon by the back of his shirt. Dean spun the creature around to slam it against the wall, holding the sharp edge of his knife underneath its chin.
“Yes,” Castiel answered simply, recalling his guilt, “and I unknowingly broke both of his wrists in the process.”
Sam took a quick and shallow breath but eventually met eyes with Gabe. Once their sights were locked, the archangel pulled his frantic moose down with a soft smooch to calm him. And, secretly, he started the kiss because Sam was just so damn attractive when he was passionate about something and Gabe couldn't resist.
“A bird isn't aware that it can fly until it knows it has wings and can use them,” Rowena answered, zeroing her sight on Jude.
Crowley finally looked up to meet Clare's eyes, and Clare only gulped and shook his own head.
. Dean's game face was instantly activated at this discovery and his head spun to look out all the windows. There were people crowded all over the streets. Which group was Gabriel referring to?
Dean nodded and glanced toward Jessica's closed door. There weren't any voices coming from inside this time. Jessica was probably asleep with Gabe watching over her. Dean could tell that Gabriel was upset with Sam last night, too. He and Jess had both locked themselves away for hours, but maybe it was a good thing. A little time apart was just what the doctor ordered.
