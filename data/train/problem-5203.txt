“Yes. Yes. Last night. And yes.” He smiled as he went back to stirring the gravy he’d been making. “There’s breakfast on the table. This all won’t be ready for a while; some of the vegetables need time to cook down, and I still have to wait for the main course to finish baking.”
Tony’s face froze for a moment before his mouth snapped shut. He wordlessly took the offered plate of food and mumbled his thanks. Steve would have sworn his cheeks looked flushed. Was he getting a fever?
He woke early, energized despite the lack of sleep with the excitement of getting things started. He went to the kitchen and started taking out the food he’d prepped late last night. God, he’d come so far. Three months ago he could barely cook an egg, now he was cooking Christmas lunch.
Suddenly, as he was firing, Bucky saw streaks of blue light hit the approaching Germans. Their bodies were instantly vaporized in quick succession. Their cries of pain and surprise died before ever having a chance to be heard. Slowly the sound of gunfire stopped as the shouts around them lessened. The wounded could still be heard as well as the shouts of officers still giving commands, but the chaos had slowed. Bucky and the men cautiously got to their feet.
Tony reached down and removed it, tossing it in the bin before grabbing it to put it on the floor next to the bed. He wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist and pulled the blonde against him.
Yay! Tony and Bucky finally got some one on one conversation! And I finally defeated the dreaded chapter 9! Hope you guys enjoyed this. Next chapter will be up on Wednesday and will have a lot happening in it. Love you guys!
Their sudden intakes of breath were followed by heavy silence, and he couldn’t bring himself to look at their faces so he stared up at the ceiling.
So, Tony began to plan for when they landed. He’d need to find the right bank after they left the base. Then, he’d need to find them a place to stay while they were in London because he was most certainly not leaving it up to the others to choose their lodgings. Like most soldiers they’d probably want to bunk down in a flop or a room over a tavern, and while Tony wasn’t the snob he used to be, he wasn’t staying there. Not when they were about to head back to the front soon enough. So, Tony planned.
“Please!” Steve groaned wantonly, “Please, touch me! Tony, I…” They both moaned loudly at the harder thrust Tony made as he picked up his pace.
Tony may have always hated paperwork, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know how to make it work to his advantage. This was why he hated it. It was a reminder that people couldn’t be trusted at their word and would eventually try to screw you over if it worked in their favor.
“It still doesn’t make it right to give an entire group of people a name like that just because they belong to a country we’re fightin’ against.” Steve said hotly.
Steve smiled. “Spaghetti’s fine, Tony. I’ll even teach you as we cook so you’ll be able to do it yourself without it taking two hours.”
“So that’s how it feels to punch someone’s light out,” Steve quietly said as he dragged the body into a small room behind them. Technically, he was right since until now, he’d used his shield along with his legs to take down the HYDRA soldiers.
“Strange?” This time it was James that spoke. Twice in one morning. He was quite the chatty Cathy today.
“So, Barnes,” Monty began, “how are feeling? You surprised all of us by marching the entire way, but I dare say that you pushed yourself to do it.”
Francesco chuckled. “You are mia famiglia either way Tony.” He looked to Steve and Bucky. “You as well, my friends.”
over the course one night.” She went on as her eyes warmed. “I had honestly been dreading to come home last night. He had been in such a terrible temper when I left that morning.
“No,” Steve corrected, “younger than that. Most of the fellas we know who are forty have lines all over their face and rough skin.”
“I can’t say that you’re broken, Tony,” he murmured, “but if I’ve learned anything from you, it’s that there is nothing broken that can’t be fixed.”
Tony watched the scientist leave with an odd sense of exhaustion. Was that it!? It seemed anticlimactic after all the worrying Tony had done. Could it be that simple? Tony supposed that he should just be thankful things appeared to be working out for him, but it was a bitter victory. Yes, this stage of his plans was on schedule, but the hard parts hadn’t even begun yet.
As if to answer Steve’s question, a flood of new memories entered Bucky’s mind. By now he would have just let them play along the synapses of his brain, waiting for him to recollect them at his own pace, but he paid close attention to these as he hoped to learn how their Christmas went that year.
Bucky could see how right Tony had been in that. JARVIS was far more than a computer system. The events of this night alone proved that to be true.
“It was a long while ago. In a cave.” Tony was uncomfortable. He didn’t talk about this, but Steve and James had done him a kindness and were trusting him by allowing him to be in their home. He owed them as much honesty as he could give. Maybe he’d been spending too much time around Captain America.
Tony’s head was spinning. This was a huge moment and was far more than he’d expected to get. Hell, he’d been prepared to beg and fight and blame and shame the man in front of him just to get a piece of this. But he still needed more. “I’ll absolutely take you up on that, Colonel.”
“There is also a consequence to this.” Tony told him seriously. Consequence? All he could think of was how the neighbor had overheard them. Was Tony worried they’d be discovered again?
“You’re going to be fine.” He said without a hint of doubt, like he could see the future and knew it would be so. “It’s going to work out. You don’t have to worry because I’m going to take care of this until you find another job.”
He felt Steve run his fingers through his hair, and oh, was it soothing. “You have been working really hard lately, Tony. I didn’t think you were actually going to take on the role of my personal assistant.”
Tony seethed internally, but held his tongue. He was here for one reason, and one reason only: Steve. Everything else was irrelevant, especially Howard.
Bucky and Steve both scrambled forward and flung their arms around him, cocooning him in warmth. “We love you, Tony.” Bucky said thickly.
in charge. Their lieutenant was among the severely wounded they were trying to drag back to safety with them, and the other officers that outranked him from the other companies hadn’t made it out of the fight or had already succumbed to their wounds. For some reason the other remaining sergeants deferred to Bucky. He didn’t know why.
Bucky looked at his friend, taking in the man’s serious expression under his signature hat, and felt himself give a half-hearted smile. “If we make it back, then you can thank me, Dum.”
“How Steve? How is it not so bad? Were you listening to my story? I know I can’t use names, but I’m pretty sure I was descriptive enough to paint a pretty decent word picture of what I had to deal with.”
Bucky spread his legs wide for Steve as he crawled between them, exposing himself. The blonde placed a soft kiss on one side of his firm rounded ass and murmured, “So good for us, love,” before he lowered his head between Bucky’s cheeks.
Steve’s eyes were wet as he took a deep, shaky breath. Bucky’s hand reached out to his and squeezed gently, giving comfort, before he pulled it back and silently knelt next to Tony.
Bucky smiled, but he took his duffle back from Tony. He started to protest, but Bucky said, “Not a chance, honey. You may be better, but you’re still bruised. I can carry my own bag. Besides, I don’t want you tired and sore later, at least, not tired and sore from that.”
“For us not to fall in love with him.” Bucky took a deep breath to center himself. Part of him couldn’t believe that he was able to do this. He was having an actual conversation with this group of people, sharing ideas and memories about a man that as of yesterday had been little more than a landlord and technician for his arm. Now, Tony was the half of his heart that wasn’t taken by Steve.
“And they had you for months?” Bucky asked, voice filled with pain, and Tony almost lost it. Here he was crying about three months of torture that made what Bucky would someday go through look like stubbed toe. He wanted to rage at the unfairness of it all.
“Then what took you so long to get back?” Bucky asked him. “We dropped our dates off after you left and still got home before you.”
“I just think you should remember that not everyone fightin’ in this war wants to. Yes, they are enemies, but they are still people. I thought you were better than that.”
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupted, “if you wish to make your appointment, I suggest you leave within the next five minutes. Traffic reports show congestion on your travel route.”
“We were ambushed.” Tony gulped, remembering. “The soldiers around me were shot before they could run five steps. Bombs were falling. I was trying to get to safety when one went off right in front me. I caught the shrapnel in my chest.”
Bucky had never considered himself to be a great thinker. That was a skill more suited to men like Steve and Tony, but he could be practical. He could use common sense, and common sense told him that they were losing ground to the enemy that was pursuing them. They wouldn’t survive another direct fight, so Bucky had decided to stage a little surprise for their tireless enemy.
to be sent back to his time. As he shuddered and tried to stop another sound from leaving him, the two boys on either side of him jerked awake. They looked at their joined fingers on Tony’s chest then up at each other before they both turned to Tony.
“That’s better.” Bucky said as he grabbed the decanter Gianetta had left them to pour the wine in their glasses.
Bucky sighed as he looked at the cloud covered moon. Anything was better than the thoughts in his head. “What kind of story do you want?”
At that moment Bruce entered the kitchen still dressed in his lab coat and clothes from the day before. He smiled when he saw them. “Good morning, James. Steve. No workout today?”
“You should probably tip better,” Steve chimed in his sassy voice. “I’m not your damned waiter, Buck. You can make your own sandwich.”
“Besides, I hate to think that you came all this way for nothing,” she continued, seeming to pause for effect. “Think of this as your
Tony wanted to go over and hold him, but his lap was filled by his other precious boy. Instead, he reached across the table, Bucky’s hand quickly went out to meet his own, and he laced their fingers together.
“Tony, it’s got blood all over the front of it,” Bucky said quietly, “and it’ll be much easier to clean and bandage the cut without the shirt in the way.”
To say that Tony was stunned was an understatement. He didn’t know how to respond to such a thing coming from any version of Howard. Still, he managed to ask, “Like you?”
“Curses, you’re right,” Tony muttered before he groaned. “Oohh, and now I want pie. This day is the worst.”
Tony promptly obeyed as he twirled his fork to collect the thin pasta before spearing a piece of sliced chicken. With the first bite, Tony’s eyes closed as he moaned around his fork. He felt like he’d been transported through the years back to his childhood. Or, technically, forward to his childhood.
“It usually has the biggest bed available,” Tony said when they’d finally entered the room. Sure enough, there was a huge bed against the center of the further wall. “No pushed together twins, just enough space for all of us.”
Steve lied to himself and pretended it was just the water from the shower running down his face and not tears from being so overwhelmed that he felt fractured inside. It was a familiar lie since it happened almost every night. In this shower on his private floor, he didn’t have to be Captain Steve Rogers. He could just be the small, weak little guy from Brooklyn he’d been for most of his life, and no one would know. So he let the water run until it was only water on his face.
“I found evidence of places in this world I’d never imagined to exist, and the people there held a power I could have not believed possible had I not seen it for myself. Some of what I learned finally helped me to perfect what I have been working on for most of my life, providing the key to balance I had not been able to see until then. It was a small thing, but I believe it will make all the difference in the end. Once I find the right subject, that is,” he added to himself ruefully.
“It’s even worse now that I know I love Tony.” Bucky said. “I keep thinkin’ of all these things, and I know it won’t happen, but what if by some miracle
“I know it’s kind of silly, but I really do want to do well at this. Jacobson is a dick, but he wasn’t lying when he said we could barely afford this war.”
“Then let me take care of you,” he whispered as he reached up to loop his arms around Steve’s neck and began a kiss. His lips slowly moved along Steve’s as he gave the other man time to relax. He gently sucked on his bottom lip and ran his teeth lightly over the flesh before he began making his way down to Steve’s throat.
Steve scrambled to obey, trying to turn himself on Tony without letting his cock pull free. Tony didn’t know whether to reward or punish him for that. Maybe both. As Steve finally settled on his knees facing Tony, he grabbed the blondes hips again. “Hands behind your back.”
Tony already knew that Steve had no love for being in the spotlight and speaking to crowds. In his own time, Cap had done it because it was expected of him, but everyone on the team could see that he’d hated being interviewed or answering reporters’ questions at press conferences. “You’re not an idiot, Steve. Don’t listen to that guy.”
! You’re hurt! You could have been killed! I can’t bring myself to give a shit about them right now.”
Natasha’s smile was almost soft. “If you need us to help, we’ll help. Just tell us where you want us and what to do.”
Dugan handed him a canteen. “Drink up, Captain. Everyone else just had their allotment, and you need yours too.”
“Typical,” his friend scoffed as he tried to get more comfortable without much success.  “Tell me more ‘bout those crazy roommates of yours, the genius and the scrappy artist. If you’re not gonna sleep, and I’m not gonna sleep, then tell me story. Anything is better than just layin’ here.”
Steve looked at him kindly. “It’s Ok to like things, Buck. You can ask for things you want and eat things you enjoy.”
Tony winced upon hearing that. He hadn’t thought that Steve would have found a way to let Bucky know he’d been injured, but Tony realized that he should have. He would have wanted to know if either of them had been hospitalized with what appeared to be life threatening injuries.
Steve smiled warm and bright. Tony realized it was the first time he’d ever called their apartment home. “Yeah, let’s go.”
After they’d all piled their plates full of food, the two boys looked up at Tony. Their faces full of warmth and gratitude and
The title for this chapter is obviously from Coldplay's Fix You. There are two reasons. Firstly,the lights mentioned are a callback to chapter three where Tony calls the boys two sources of light. Second, like all the titles it references an important moment for Tony in the chapter. He is still not in a good place, but we know that our boys won't let him stay that way for long. I swear I can hear that song playing in the background during part of this chapter.
fellas. Two people to love him and for him to love. He felt so lucky. No matter what happened to him in this life, he thought, no matter how bad it got, as long as he got to keep Steve and Tony, he would be OK. They would take care of him.
As they moved over the scorched earth, that now familiar burnt flesh smell hit his nose again. The rain had lessened the scent but couldn’t erase it completely. It was easy to tell who had died from the explosions, and who had fallen under Bucky’s aim. His drill sergeant from army training had been right. He made one hell of a sniper.
Tony watched Steve closely as his breathing settled and grew worried at the wheeze he could hear in the younger man’s lungs, but Steve just got up and made his way over to the dresser. That’s when Tony noticed there was a pitcher and two glasses resting on top of it. Steve grabbed them and brought them over.
“We jumped out of a plane for you!” Tony said petulantly, but Steve could tell both Tony and Bucky were amused by this conversation. “I jumped out of a plane that wasn’t even on fire! This is my thanks? I’ve spent years watching out for you brats! The stress alone could kill me!”
Bucky was hunched over on the couch looking like he was desperately trying not to cry. Steve sat next to him, looking lost at what to do for his best friend. Tony’s heart stuttered.
Steve didn’t quite understand what he meant by that. Judging from Bucky’s face, he didn’t either, but Steve would take it as a win.
“I joined the army,” Steve said, and Bucky could see his distraction as his head kept looking around them. That answer didn’t make any sense to Bucky, but he was still a bit drugged.
After leaving the tent, Tony heard a whistle followed by Dugan’s voice saying, “He’s got a pair on him, don’t he?”
“I don’t think you’re giving Tony enough credit, love.” He thought about it some more and sighed, “It doesn’t really matter in the long run though, does it? We can’t let him know, or we’ll probably lose him. I don’t want to damage what we have.”
Steve was trying. The words chopped short through his gasps, but he was getting it. Bucky, encouraged, joined in as he continued rubbing soothing circles.
“Ha-Ha.” Tony answered drolly before he threw back the last of his alcohol, and Bucky watched his throat swallow the burning liquid down. “I have to say that uniform works for you,” Tony said as he rose from the stool and approached Bucky. Once he got close, his voice lowered as he added, “The color almost turns those stormy eyes a sea-green, especially with that hat.”
“Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That’s what you don’t understand. This isn’t about me.”
“I can’t.” He pouted, “Thor said he’d electrocute anyone who touched his ‘mischievous monkey’ mug. Nat said only a badass redhead could use the ‘Breakfast with Blossom’ mug. Bruce claimed the ‘Gang Green Gang Good Morning’ mug, and I’m not about to make him angry.
Bucky groaned above him as he ground his hips against Tony’s face and went even deeper. Tony’s eyes had already begun to water from the deep throating he was giving him, but as Bucky pushed further he felt the first tear fall.
Bucky didn’t feel like a hero, and he didn’t really care that he might be getting a medal that he couldn’t use. All he cared about was making it through this damn war.
Tony was writhing and moaning under him, but Steve kept him still and silenced him with a kiss. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Steve knew he should be careful, and he was trying to be, but the restless, caged part of him was rejoicing. This was so damn good, and Steve felt drunk with it. Tony’s nails digging into him were better than any caress, and the choked gasps against his lips sounded sweeter than any symphony Steve had ever heard.
Steve shrugged. “Sometimes it’s best to get out what’s bothering you before you can really enjoy what makes you happy.”
Tony started to undo the buttons on Bucky’s shirt, kissing along his jaw as his hands moved down. He nibbled on his earlobe before sucking it into his mouth as he pulled out the last of the fabric from his pants.
He took the steps of the stairs two at a time as he raced up to their apartment. His heart was pounding, and he was quietly pleading to any deity that would listen for history not to repeat itself any further.
“How do you know that? Did one of those soldiers say something to you about it? Because I was finally able to talk to them after you reminded them that I’m an actual captain, and none of them had heard of Bucky or met anyone in the 107th. I asked, and this is the closest to the front they’ve ever been.”
“Fuck, I wanna destroy you.” Tony growled as he removed his probing fingers. He hitched Steve’s slender legs up around narrow hips, and Steve shivered at the idea of finally getting what he wanted. Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s back, and he yelped in surprise when Tony lifted him into his lap then began to rise off the couch. Steve clamped his naked body around Tony’s to help hold himself up.
“I don’t mind at all.” Tony told him truthfully. “I could always use some conversation. I don’t really do quiet very well, and I’d probably end up talking the poor waitress’s ear off.”
“That’s not the issue here, Captain,” Tony told him before a soldier near them snorted at Steve’s given title. Tony’s head shot to the side before he snapped at the man. “Shouldn’t you be paying attention to what’s going on outside of this truck? Keep your snorts and opinions to yourself, corporal. Despite his job, the man’s rank of Captain is legitimate, and he is your superior. You should know by now that you can’t choose what the army decides to do with you.”
He then heard Steve give a small cough in his sleep, and Bucky’s mind snapped back to reality. Bucky was with Steve! He loved Steve! And if he kept indulging this warped side of his nature, he could end up losing both men.
Tony understood where he was coming from. This was a nicer place than the boys were used to. Not extravagant, but it was certainly nicer than average. Tony just nodded. “I’ve already taken care of everything.”
“I am, or I was. But I’ve been doing this kind of thing since I was a kid. My father kind of insisted on it.” At Steve’s puzzled face, he explained, “He was an inventor.”
He knew Tony lied to them sometimes. Steve knew that, too, but it was seldom discussed. It was inevitable that they would pick up on it after having been with Tony for so long, but it was complicated. Their partner had a very painful history and didn’t like being reminded or having to relive those experiences. They both accepted that. Tony never lied about the important things. He’d bared all his faults and insecurities to them. He’d kept every promise he had ever made. He was good and kind when he wasn’t scary in his vengeance to those who wronged him or Steve or Bucky.
Silence was the only answer Bucky could hear since he couldn’t take his eyes off Steve as the blonde turned back to him. “I know this is hard for you, love. You’ve had to remember so much in a short amount of time, and it’s got to be confusing after how you’ve been feeling these past months. Two very different parts of you are having to coexist together, but I promise you that I will be here for you. I promise you that I love you no matter what you’ve done or any mistakes you think you’ll make. I’m not ashamed of you, and we will get through this.”
“He’s a good man,” Sam added. “He didn’t have to take us in, and he damn sure didn’t have to give everyone an entire floor to themselves or put so much effort into making each one perfect for us. Hell, I never thought I’d fly again after my wings got destroyed, but he built me new set that was better than the ones I’d had.”
He pulled back to look in Bucky’s artic eyes. They were both breathing a little heavily now. He curled his fingers into the waist of Bucky’s boxers and pulled them down as he sank to his knees, prompting Bucky to step out of them and his pants.
The other man nodded. “Yes, there is a nice diner not far from here. I sometimes go there when I need a break from the walls of my apartment.”
. He hadn’t meant to say it, not this soon. You don’t tell someone you love them after the first time you have sex.
Tony nodded, and Steve quietly pushed the door far enough to look inside before turning back to Tony. “It’s a cell block. There’s row of cages that go back over a hundred feet, but there’s a catwalk above them where I see at least one guard patrolling. I think that’s our best bet if we time it right.”
“It’s not your job to take everything on yourself, either.” Tony corrected him. “You’ve worked hard for years. You’ve taken on so much. You’ve got a lot to be proud of. This isn’t your fault, James. You haven’t failed. You just need some time to figure this out. Let me help you. This isn’t you asking, this is me offering. Friends can do that for each other.”
“Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen,” she said, trying to recover the moment, “and he’s mad enough to brave this airspace. We’re lucky to have him.”
He watched as Tony continued to glower at the men around them as if waiting for another excuse to vent his frustration.
“I know, doll, I know. But you know why we can’t. If Tony found out…” Steve gasped at something Bucky must have done. “If he found out, he might leave. He might not hate it like most people, but we don’t know if he’d be OK living with it.”
He pushed against Steve’s shoulder. “Lay back, baby boy.” He ordered, watching as Steve stretched his legs forward, spreading them wide with his knees bent and feet firmly planted on the mattress outside of Bucky’s opened legs. He laid himself back against Bucky’s chest and rested his head on the brunet’s shoulder. Tony watched as Bucky’s arms came up to hug around Steve’s torso, holding him close.
Tony’s eyes were filled with understanding. “It still doesn’t mean you can’t like or want other things too, or that liking penetration makes you a submissive. People like what they like.”
“No objections.” He repeated. “Do you know how long it took me to wrap those? For like, ever. I’d never wrapped a present in my life, which is also why it looks like they were done by a blind gorilla. Just please, open them?”
So there it is. Tony is officially in the SSR. I look forward to more Colonel Philips because he was fun to write (that salty bastard). I also wanted to give the boys a nice evening with minimal drama before Bucky leaves, and Steve is now a working artist doing what he loves!
So Steve gave Bucky what he needed and kept the focus on him. “I don’t need anyone to take care of me.” Steve huffed.
It was the memory of worrying for Tony that had woken him tonight. Of course, Bucky now knew that the doctors had probably been correct in every injury they’d listed for Tony, only for Tony’s body to mend itself and keep him alive to fulfill the curse. He and Steve would have to tell the team about Tony’s healing abilities when they worked with them later. Bucky didn’t know if it would be important, but he figured Bruce at least should know about it.
“I lost my job.” His voice was so small, almost in shock. “They laid off ten of us.” He squeezed his eyes shut and hung his head, ashamed.
liked watching them. A lot. Maybe this was one of his things? God knows the thought of being watched was one of Bucky’s.
And it hurt, it hurt every time Bucky talked about himself that way. “There’s nothin’ wrong with you, Buck. You’re just different.”
But he couldn’t deny Tony’s sincerity or concern. This was clearly eating at the man and had been for a while. Steve didn’t doubt that keeping whatever this project was a secret had been weighing down his conscience. Tony had to choose between military secrets and his partners, and Steve didn’t envy him that.
Steve ran a hand down Bucky’s back as he said, “I’m not the Steve who lost you either, not really. He drowned in an icy grave. I woke up here lost and alone, and I had to adapt. It took time and work, but I did it. I’m still doing it.”
Bucky looked like he couldn’t believe him, so Tony continued. “Do you remember what I said before we started. I promised you that I wouldn’t judge you for what you like during sex. I love everything about you. You are so sweet and kind and perfect, and I never want you to think otherwise. I told you long ago that I don’t care what other people consider is normal. I want you and Steve, and I will do anything to make you happy. You two are my world.”
“Tell me you need it,” he commanded hoarsely as he fucked his hips even harder, pushing Bucky further and faster into Steve. “Tell me you love it, that only I can make you feel this way.” He needed to hear it. He needed to know that he was just as important to them as they were to him. That this was more than sex. “Tell me how much you love me.”
. Steve calmed himself enough to see the men now staring at abused metal in his hand, and he felt self-conscious.
Tony swallowed his ever growing panic and walked over to the boy. He looked at the stack of papers waiting to be sold.
“He slept on our couch that night.” Bucky said slowly. “The next morning when he got dressed I saw his underwear. I told him…I told him…” He closed his eyes remembering, and Steve’s jaw dropped when Bucky
“I wasn’t any better.” He admitted. “I called him a big man in suit of armor, told him he wasn’t worth the things he prided himself over, that he didn’t care about anything but himself. I told him he wasn’t a hero, all because I’d read a file and made an assumption based on someone else’s words.”
“It’s not a big deal, but I will be happy to tell you after we decide on our dinner. Gianetta will be here soon.” Tony winked before he looked back at his menu. Everything sounded good. He loved classic Italian cooking.
“Thankfully yes,” Tony had said, playing along. “I’m told it looked like my death. Glad they were mistaken. I’m not ready to check out just yet.”
“Then you’re smarter than most,” Howard replied, “but I guess I already knew that.” He sighed and took a drink. “My father founded our company. He was a smart man, smart enough to hire people that were smarter than him. He was good at business, but engineering and mechanics were never his strengths. Still, the company did well enough. It’s the biggest reason I became an engineer. I had a legacy to further. He was always talking about what Stark Industries could be one day, and that I was the one who would take it into the future. Luckily for both of us, I was brilliant enough to achieve his dreams.”
“Well, yeah,” he answered as he picked up the tools he’d used. “It wasn’t much. Just needed to replace a few wires, tighten a couple of tubes, install a new coil. Those kinds of things.”
“I’d honestly be surprised if you could do even that.” The man didn’t miss a beat. “In all my years in the army, I haven’t met a big brain who could properly get his hands dirty.” He turned to Erskine. “No offense, Doc.”
Steve circled a lubed up finger around his hole. Tony didn’t know or care where he’d gotten the Vaseline. All he knew was that he was about to be filled by both his boys.
Like Steve, Bucky’s dick was uncut and already half hard. He could tell it would get even thicker once he was fully aroused. Tony’s mouth watered, but he just leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Bucky’s hipbone before looking up.
The younger man looked up to meet his gaze. Under a worried brow, clear blue eyes shone with a brightness that the wine had given them. “I’m sorry,” Steve breathed. They were so close.
He tossed the used tape into a garbage can and replied, “Thank you,” before he quickly made his way to the elevator. He didn’t even have to tell JARVIS where he wanted to go; the tower’s caretaker already knew and began the elevator’s ascent as soon as the doors were closed.
“Yes,” Erskine nodded. “Strength, agility, enhanced senses, ability to focus, memory retention and many other things. Why?”
Before Bucky even thought about it, he unholstered the gun at his thigh. He swung it around to shoot the phone Clint was holding as he tried to snap a picture of him and Steve. Clint squawked in surprise as his phone exploded in his hand, and Bucky holstered the weapon before nuzzling against Steve’s thigh again. The rest of Bucky’s body had never moved.
A lot of people approved of the match. Tony was such a nice guy that they were happy to see him laughing and smiling while he was out with Ruth, and everyone agreed that the poor woman deserved someone who would treat her right like Tony did. It had been a very good idea on Tony’s part when he asked Ruth if she wouldn’t mind helping him with this little ruse.
Tony chuckled and changed tactics. “Then let me prove I can do more than wipe up the shit around here.”
So things were better. Tony had a purpose. Tony had a job, something worth getting up for in the morning and would take his mind off how much he was beginning to miss his old life. Pepper, Rhodey, JARVIS, his bots, his teammates. It was almost a constant pang in his heart. Steve and Bucky were great. Really. But Tony still felt guilty at the half-truths he told, the omissions he had to make. He was constantly walking a fine line, and it was wearing him down.
“Did something happen today? Are you upset with me?” Tony asked, not knowing what could have caused such a difference in them over the course of the day.
“Good,” Steve murmured as he pushed back to Tony’s face, his hand still pulling at Tony’s hair. His center found Tony’s mouth, and he obediently went to work.
for the maintenance to your arm. That means you want it to happen. I just want to make sure that you’re not confused or upset or hurt by anything I might have to do. If you feel any of those things, it is not alright. Being in pain and scared is not alright.”
He stopped by the corner grocery to pick up a few apples and some sugar. Steve had a recipe from his mother that made the best damn pie Tony had ever tasted, and he was going to beg or bribe Steve to make it again for him. Tony smirked, his internal voice sounding dirty at the thought of
Still, it was different now, and for Bucky, maybe Steve could make the effort again. Once they got Tony back, their partner was sure to know someone who would be understanding and discreet. Tony always knew what to do.
“At least I now know when I will find him.” Erskine smiled. “Thank you, Tony. Though I am sorry that you were stranded here, I cannot deny that you bring me a great deal of hope and relief. It is good to know that I will not only succeed, but that the man I choose will be the right one. It is also good to have someone to talk with about this. Everyone else needs to see and believe that I am completely confident in this project. It is nice to be able to voice my doubts.”
Now Tony had to lie a little. “Yep, from California. My luggage was stolen right after I got off the train here. I was going to stay with my associate until I found a place, but you know, it didn’t happen that way. I put everything into the project, and now I can’t afford to bring my stuff that’s in storage cross-country. Not that I’d have a place to put it.”
) used for the delicate work was resting on the table top, ready to be of service for whenever Bucky decided to show up and admit that his arm needed attention.
“Thanks, fellas,” Bucky said as he sat up to eat. Tony thanked them as well, but they just waved it off.
It was a Sunday. Tony and Bucky were sitting in the living area listening to the radio and playing pinochle. Steve and Bucky had had to teach him the game, both in disbelief that he didn’t already know how to play. Steve was at church, or mass since he was Catholic, and Bucky had been kicking Tony’s ass all morning when Steve came in.
Steve didn’t know how to respond to that because he knew deep down that Bucky was right. He’d lay down the shield today and walk away if that was what he had to do for Bucky. It was just off-putting how casually Bucky said it.
When Tony finally pulled up to the infamous Sanctum Sanctorum, he repressed a shiver. Tony hated magic. A lot. And this was a place of nothing but magic. He could actually smell it in the air and feel it on his skin. Eww.
Steve stared at Bucky, stunned by everything that had been said. It was like they were teenagers again, and Bucky had just given him a good dose of tough love through the verbal equivalent of a swift kick in the ass. And it helped. It helped because Steve had spoken his piece, and Bucky had listened. Bucky, who was the only one who could have broken through Steve’s walls enough to get the words from him in the first place. Bucky, who was the only one who could absolve Steve from the weight of what he’d been feeling.
A few moments passed as Tony listened to the two of them panting before Bucky spoke. “Thank you, doll. I needed that so much. Love it when you take over for me. Love that filthy mouth.”
Steve went to do his signature ‘rub the back of his neck because he’s uncomfortable’ move and winced.
“You didn’t need to go through all this trouble, Tony.” Disbelief still filling Steve’s voice. “We weren’t expecting anything.”
Howard sighed, “But I can respect you for them. You were right about you being the person to call me out on my shit. So, moving forward, I will try to remember that what you are saying is because you are a good man looking out for a soldier’s well-being, and not because you are trying to undermine me or steal this project from me. Does that sound acceptable to you?”
“I mean seriously, if Wong doesn’t know where he is, I don’t see how we’re going to find…Oh, my God! Cap and the Soldier are cuddling!” Clint’s voice was not what Bucky wanted right now. “I’ve gotta get a picture of this.”
Steve watched as the other men looked over to where Tony sat again. Tony was taking apart one of the new German weapons he’d picked up from another soldier during the march. Steve could see his intelligent eyes going over every detail of the weapon as he studied it. His lips moving silently as he talked to himself.
“Of the show,” Tony corrected. “He’s in charge of putting together the show. He is not the boss of you. Don’t forget that. He can’t fire you or punish you, not with Senator What’s His Name fangirling over you.”
Now, it was Steve’s turn to hesitate. “I need to get dressed,” he finally said as he went over to his dresser and pulled out a pair of boxer-briefs. He slid them on under his towel before removing it. He saw Bucky’s brow crease in confusion as he opened another drawer and took out a pair of blue flannel pajama pants, pulling them on before returning to the bed.
Her face looked a little disappointed, but that thought was quickly overshadowed by the sight of the Colonel approaching him.
“I did! And it was much better than the last time I tried at lunch. I made sure they sent up extra utensils and drinks. I still shattered a glass and bent a fork, but I was ready for the glass and drank over a garbage can, so I didn’t make a mess. I was able to bend the fork back. You can hardly tell it was damaged.”
He was quietly shaking as they spoke to him, and oh, he needed to focus his eyes. His lids felt too heavy for that, but he somehow managed. Bucky was soon able to focus on a pair of warm brown eyes that creased in a smile.
He made an effort to put aside time just for Steve after their day in Manhattan. Steve had loved the museum, and Tony loved Steve so everyone was happy. He’d taken Steve to a couple of baseball games, and they’d eaten hotdogs as they’d cheered for the Dodgers. Tony wasn’t a huge baseball fan, but again, it made Steve happy, so he was happy. Sometimes, they would just stay in and play cards as the radio softly played in the background. Those were some of Tony’s favorite moments. Once upon a time, Tony never would have believed this would be something he’d get to have.
“I’m not at liberty to say,” Tony said and before Bucky could object, he continued, “but I’m going to anyway. No more military secrets, I promise. I’m pretty sure that the Colonel wants our dear Captain to be on a special task force. Knowing Steve the way I do, it’s safe to assume that he already has some ideas about who’s going to be on his team.”
Tony’s eyes flashed with heat at those words before he calmed and softly said, “Of course, my sweet boy. Daddy’s going to take care of you.”
“A spy wouldn’t have invited me to eat lunch with him, much less keep whatever documents he was working on in view of me.” Tony answered, knowing he was being tested and was kind of enjoying it. “It’s not like you’d need to spend time with me. I’m not any one important that could be an assignment for a mission, and if you were a spy, you wouldn’t feel inclined to socialize with a stranger from a country you’re fighting to overthrow. I’m not a neighbor that you have to keep up a cover for. You would have just declined my request and eaten alone.”
Tony leaned down to press a kiss on the small of his back and murmured, “I’ve got you, sweet boy,” before he pulled the finger back and pushed forward again.
And Tony watched as Bucky stepped and counted, demonstrating the basic steps. He did it a few times before stepping back in front of Tony and saying, “Ok, hands back up the way I showed you.”
“I don’t have to have a lot of manners to have more than you, Buck. Your elbows are on the table, and you’re not even eatin’ yet.”
Tony grabbed the glass and swallowed half of it. Phillips took a smaller sip as he waited for Tony speak. His mind was still reeling. He’d had no idea this was why Phillips had always been so dismissive of him. In the Colonel’s mind, Tony was a petty criminal, no matter what his talents had been.
“Are you really about to explain Ohm’s Law to me?” Tony snapped before taking a calming breath. “Look, I know you don’t believe I have a right to be here. I know that, to you, I am not qualified to work on this project, but that is not up to you. I obviously earned the right to be here.”
He truly was stranded here, unless some other outside force came to help him. He’d stared down at his hand to the now invisible brand that made him immune to magic, trapping him as neatly as if he’d been in an actual cage.
“I don’t think anything about this is selfish, Tony,” Bucky was shaking head, “but it sure looks and smells great.”
Tony watched him and waited. Steve took a breath then started with the easier admission. “Well, I told Bucky that I really liked watchin’ the two of you together. I mean, I
Fuck, Bucky wanted a job. He hated not being able to pull his weight and making Tony responsible for everything. Tony said it was OK, that he wanted Bucky to get a job he liked, but it didn’t make it any easier. The truth was that Bucky knew he was probably gonna have to settle for some crap job he hated, just like he always had. He wasn’t educated or formally trained in anything so it’s not like he had a lot of options.
Yes, Steve did like that thought. He’d never been able to really mark or move Tony the way he knew the other man would have enjoyed, but he didn’t want to injure Tony. He couldn’t drink a glass of milk without causing damage for God’s sake.
Steve groaned on top of him. “So fucking good. Is this what you’re doing to him, love? It feels amazing.” Steve gasped as Tony pushed deeper, just as Bucky had done to him. He could feel the need to squirm, wanting more and deeper and faster, but he couldn’t ask for it. He just kept his tongue moving, a step behind Bucky every time, and surrendered.
Tony wanted to ask him so many questions. Where had he first gotten the idea for the serum? How did he factor in the combination of technology and biochemistry? Why did he choose genetic enhancement over mutation? So many questions that he could never ask because Tony wasn’t supposed to know about any of this.
“My name really is Anthony,” he began. “Do you really need to know the last name?” Because whatever lie Tony told him would no doubt just get discovered again. The man had already proven that.
“Holy crap. Hating these people aside, this is intricate work.” The Stark said as he analyzed the hologram. “Look right there, Cap. This is the worst of the damage. Those wires are fried and frayed and need replacing. I bet it’s causing all kinds of nerve pain.” A tool was picked up and brought to its inner shoulder joint. The Stark looked at him. “If it’s alright with you, I’m going to start here and see if I can repair or replace some of these wires.” The Stark waited before repeating. “Is that alright?”
Williams scoffed at the threat. “Is that supposed to worry me, ginger? Besides, when I make sergeant, there might not be so many of you Micks around once we get to the fighting.”
They snapped out of whatever remaining confusion they felt, and quickly began removing their clothes. He could feel his arousal growing with each inch of skin they uncovered. How had he pushed them away like that? They were the center of his world. When they were all naked, Tony just ordered, “Bed boys.”
“Sshh…” Tony whispered quietly. “None of this is your fault, sweetheart. Don’t be sorry. I’m just so glad that your safe now. Steve and I went crazy at the thought of losing you. None of that matters because you’re safe.”
Steve squatted down so he could speak more quietly, “I know, Buck, and I will tell you everything. Tony and I both will, but we can’t here, so later.” Steve looked into Bucky’s confused, tired eyes, and his voice broke. “I’m just so glad we found you. When I heard…I couldn’t let myself believe it. Me and Tony would’ve torn this country apart lookin’ for you.”
Something was nagging at the back of Steve’s brain, but he was soon too preoccupied with the reports some of the soldiers came to give him about the number of men that were in the convoy. It seemed a staggering amount to Steve, and he was grateful for every single person that had been saved. Others told him the supplies they had, including blankets, bandages, medications, rations, water, fuel, weapons, and ammunition.
“Sorcerer Supreme Mugwump of the Wizengamot for assholes. He was a doctor, but he had to quit when his head got too big to fit in the operating room.” Tony explained.
At least it came with a captain’s salary. Steve had been floored when he’d been signing the paperwork that they’d given him and seen the amount he would be receiving. Luckily, Tony had offered to invest it along with what he’d been getting from Bucky. Steve didn’t really understand investments and stocks, but he was positive that Tony did. Who knew, maybe it would work, and they’d come out of the war with a nice savings.
Tony relaxed a little more. “I’m glad. After the dinner you made for me, even when I’d been so unpleasant while I was stuck in bed those days, I wanted to say thank you.”
“Of course you got distracted, Tony, it’s what you do.” She sighed, “I’m killing myself trying to run your company. I don’t think having to sign a few papers every week or so is too much to ask of you.”
He turned and kissed Bucky slow and deep, relishing at how languid his sweet boy was. “I love you so much, sweetheart. Thank you for an incredible evening.”
He watched as Steve moved to the refrigerator and pulled out the carton of orange juice. He set it on the counter before grabbing two glasses from a cabinet. Tony sipped his coffee and did
It was Christmas eve. Steve and Bucky had been sleeping for a half hour as Tony quietly got up from the couch. He stealthily moved across the living room headed for the door. As noiselessly as he could, he snuck out of the apartment and began the long walk down the stairs to the basement where he’d stashed his holiday gifts. First he brought up the tree. It wasn’t anything special, but it was green and prickly and would hold some garland and tinsel. That’s all Tony could ask for.
The cold was not doing him any favors. He never realized how much shivering affected your stomach muscles, and his healing wound was really starting to itch. At least he was out of the apartment.
Steve waited and listened as Bucky’s breathing evened out, signaling he was asleep. Steve tried not to think about how Bucky had changed the end of the memory. Just as he tried not to think about the way Bucky was pressed against him.
you became.” Tony chuckled as he moved his fingers in slow circles across Steve’s skin. Thankfully, Steve’s erection had gone down, and he could just enjoy the feeling without raging arousal to accompany it. “Walking on eggshells doesn’t suit you, baby, and I knew you needed to be shown sooner rather than later that you
Bucky’s eyes sprang open at those last memories. His chest was heaving as the thoughts and emotions continued to fill his mind, but he wasn’t fighting it anymore and realized he could stay in the present while remembering his past. He felt tears running down his face, but he didn’t have the capacity to be fully surprised by it.
Right before Steve was about to go on, Tony stopped him and said, “I want you to prepare yourself, Steve. These guys have been fighting a long time. They might not be that, um, happy with the show. It’s a little too cheerful for what they’ve been through.”
Tony met his eyes, then Bucky’s. “Of course, I do.” He answered truthfully, appropriate timing or not, he refused to take it back. He wanted this too much. “I am head over heels, hopelessly in love with both of you. Even when I thought there wasn’t a chance in hell for any of this, I fell for you.”
“Theoretically, it’s supposed to produce a concentrated blast of energy.” Tony told him. “Realistically, I have no way of creating the energy needed to make it work, so at the moment it’s supposed to lay there and look pretty.”
“He’s doing well working as a repairman in the neighborhood.” Steve said with a fond tone. He huffed out a laugh. “It’s almost surreal to think about now. One of the most brilliant inventors ever born making a living by fixing radiators, furnaces and faulty electrical wiring. People around the borough called him a miracle worker.”
Steve was looking at him, his eyebrows pinched in concern. “I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but I think you need more coffee. You’re really out of it this morning.”
They left the tent as Steve heard Phillips snap angrily at Agent Carter to keep something to herself.
“Just like I told you, love.” Steve said to Bucky as he too climbed onto the bed, walking on his knees to stop by Tony’s head.
Bucky started laughing, quietly at first before it grew into the full blown joy of relief. Steve soon followed.  Tony watched as most of the remaining tension in their bodies drained.
Bucky looked to Steve, hoping he would be the one to answer. All of this talking and sharing was still new to him, and he was beginning to feel drained by it. He’d gone seventy years where having an opinion of any kind wasn’t permitted. Hell, thanks to that fucking chair it wasn’t even possible, and although he knew he was now allowed to voice his thoughts without punishment, it was still hard to override the instinct that told him to keep silent and wait for orders.
“The thing I’m most upset over is that the two of you had to worry even more for nothing.” Tony told them as they stood away from the bus station and waited for a cab to hail. “I never wanted you to worry over me, especially not like that.”
He looked at Bucky, and his good feelings vanished. The brunet looked uncomfortable and anxious? Worried? Whatever he was feeling, it wasn’t what Tony had hoped to see.
“We’ve just never had to worry about somethin’ like that,” Steve continued for him, “and I know we only know pieces of your past, but I can understand why you’d learn to react to threats that way. We also know that you would never do anything to hurt us or risk what we have here.”
“Yeah, yeah sorry, I…aahh,” he closed his eyes and scrubbed his face, willing the past to disappear, “I just…need a minute.”
He had barely turned his head to find the source of the noise when he realized what was happening, and everything slowed down in a rush of adrenaline. A huge delivery truck had overcorrected when it swerved to miss an oncoming cab and was about to hit them. He lunged forward to push Joe to the side and out of danger when he felt the multi-ton vehicle collide with his body in a flash of pain. Everything went black after that.
Tony released him taking two steps back, putting himself between the guy and little Steve, just in case Joe’s wounded pride made him attack again. But all he did was turn to glare as he backed out of the alley, taking to the street when he reached his friends.
Steve including Bucky in his worry for Tony made him miss his other partner all the more strongly. Bucky should be here. Tony felt desperate with the need to hold and reassure him that he was alive and would be recovered soon. So Tony just held Steve a little tighter, ignoring his bruising and reminding himself that it was just nine more days before Bucky would return to them. Exhausted and aching from head to foot, it was all too easy to fall asleep after Tony closed his eyes.
Tony then went to the corner grocery he’d seen near the apartment knowing he’d have to carry everything he bought. He saw one of the older church ladies Steve had introduced him to yesterday. She’d greeted him happily as he looked around the tiny market and got some staples he thought would be good to have in the kitchen.
“It’s not that bad,” Tony defended, having recently developed a sympathy for Dorothy. He wasn’t in Kansas anymore, either. “And Judy Garland is lovely.”
“Of course, gorgeous.” Tony said as he stretched a hand to the hard length in front of him and wrapped his fingers around the base. He leaned forward to lick a stripe from root to tip, teasing at the foreskin before dipping his tongue in to play with the head and slit. Pre-come hit his taste buds, and his eyes closed at the salty flavored fluid.
Steve couldn’t understand how Tony saw himself, and while he wasn’t as smart as Tony, he could see the pattern forming. Tony didn’t think he was worthy of love. It was the only time his confidence was shaken, when the emotional armor he must have been building up his whole life cracked just a little.
“Our prayers are with them.” Steve said earnestly. “If there’s anything we can do to help get them into the country faster, let us know.” Bucky and Tony nodded in agreement.
Tony had been lying on the sofa as he tried to read from the newest addition to his personal library,
“That contract is now ended,” the doctor threatened. “You will be obligated to pay your bill in full before you leave; including your treatment, the tests that have been performed and your stay here. The removal of your casts and bindings will also be out of pocket since you are doing this against medical advice.”
They came upon an older looking apartment building. Tony was not feeling the love as they walked up flights of poorly lit stairs. The wooden floors were scuffed and the paint was slightly peeling on the walls. When they finally reached Steve’s floor, they turned down the corridor. They stopped at the second door.
Steve almost rolled his eyes fondly at his partner as he enjoyed the feeling of Tony’s naked skin against his. It was kind of exciting being carried off like this by Tony. He decided to take advantage and circle his hips against Tony’s stomach. The friction felt amazing on his dick as it rubbed against Tony’s tight abs, and he knew it wouldn’t be long before it would get hard again.
They had effectively crippled the isolationist movement that had so far kept America out of the war, and in doing so, they’d signed their own death warrant. They’d also doomed countless future soldiers gearing up for war, American and Japanese alike. Soldiers like Bucky who had gotten in line early that morning and signed their lives away.
James just shrugged. “It was on Steve’s list. I liked Dobby and Luna. Umbridge was hard to read through, that bitch deserved to die. The movies were pretty good, but I don’t like how they changed the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, that they were alone. I liked Harry’s monologue in the great hall being heard by everyone who had fought…”
Steve looked up at Tony. His brow was furrowed in concentration as he soundlessly mouthed words about whatever he was working on. It was a different kind of love than what he felt for Bucky.
As he saw the cannon move to aim towards himself and the remaining men, Bucky yelled, “DOWN!” before he turned and pushed the other two men back into the foxhole.
Of course, he knew Bucky would worry anyway. Steve was still set on trying to enlist despite the argument it had caused when Bucky found out. Honestly, if Tony didn’t know what he knew about Steve’s destiny, he would probably be on Bucky’s side of this argument, but he did know so he decided not to take sides and let them
The man’s attitude changed when Tony pulled out his wallet from his jacket’s breast pocket and said, “I’ll take five rooms with full size beds and a three-bedroom suite for the week.”
Bucky’s attention was directed inward as Steve sat them down on the large couch. He wrapped an arm around the brunet and softly ran his fingers down the flesh arm that remained. The cool metal of Bucky’s left lay tucked between them, growing warmer from their bodies. They passed the remaining hours of the night in thoughtful reflection.
Millie laughed. “I hear a lot from the people at my tables. I’ve heard quite a few of the men talking about the man from Brooklyn who can fix anything in half the time for half the price. People say you’re a genius.”
“Indeed,” the man agreed as he watched him, “I for one never imagined that I would be here, finalizing my work with the chance to see it truly valued for what it could be.”
Tony gasped and coughed around the breaths he took before he could rasp out, “Green. Green, please…I need, need you…”
“Six? Huh, sorry.” He said as he set the box on the table. “Things didn’t go so well this morning. Turns out there wasn’t much that could be done to help me get back home. Tough times and all that. I spent a lot of the day walking around and getting lost in my head.”
“I’ve studied a little of everything.” Tony said easily. “Some things more than others, obviously, but I had a very rounded education. Plus, you’re never too old to keep learning.”
Bucky bent down to pick up some papers that had fallen from Steve’s pocket. “How many times is this?” He asked, trying to control his anger when he saw another 4F enlistment form. “Oh, you’re from Paramus now?” He asked as Steve continued to check over himself for signs of dirt and damage. “You know it’s illegal to lie on your enlistment form, and seriously, Jersey?” He said with distaste.
Tony’s blood boiled in anger. This was so typical of Howard, and Tony had had to deal with this his whole life growing up. Howard hated sharing credit with anyone, just as he resented anyone who was brilliant enough to do something he hadn’t been able to think of first. Tony’s mind flashed to Hank Pym, among many others, who’d received the same treatment from Howard. Those interactions had created bad blood that had lasted long after Howard’s death.
The Avengers realize this is happening because they know Tony is in the past. The rest of the world is just slowly being altered. The more Tony changes, the more there will be to know about Anthony Sutton, but it will take time for these changes to reach the present because every year in between 1944 and 2014 will need to be affected. But like Bruce said, these changes are details. Tony is ADDING history. He cannot change anything major that had already happened before he was cursed.
Tony stopped and looked back at him. His face was cold, and his voice was colder. “You’re the genius, and this is your project, so
“I’m almost scared ask what he said next.” Bucky said wisely. “Tony can lash out with the best of them when he’s injured.”
Tony blew out a breath and looked at both of them. “In the simplest of terms, I would be a hedonist.”
“I wasn’t.” Tony smiled a little sadly. “You don’t get to be a kid and go to college when you’re fifteen. Playtime is wasted potential, at least that’s what my father said. Anyway,” Tony clapped his hands once, breaking the moment, “how about we take this to the other room? We can listen to the radio and play some cards.”
This was a new low. Yeah, in his own time he’d noticed Steve and James’s bodies, had admired the muscles and sharp lines, but this had been different because this was a different Steve and Bucky. They were barely more than teenagers. They’d been so good to Tony, accepting him and treating him like a friend. When Tony had had literally nothing, he’d had Steve and Bucky. Who he’d lied to and used. Now he wanted to use them even more?
“I have to say that I’m impressed.” Tony panted as he fucked into Steve. “You take me so well. Are you going to come again already? I can feel your ass tightening around me like you think I’m going to let you come, but not yet,” Tony released Steve’s arms to let the smaller man fall forward onto the mattress and off his dick with a groan.
“Tony, we appreciate that you feel like you have to work right now,” Steve started, “but please just take it easy for a bit and let us take care of you.”
Bucky nodded in agreement even as he admitted to himself that he didn’t have the first idea on how to save Tony. He may be a lethal assassin, but this was beyond his abilities. Maybe they’d have to kill someone to get Tony back, he could do that. If it was for Tony, he’d kill anyone that stood in the way, though Steve probably wouldn’t like that. It was just the only thing Bucky knew he was good for.
At that, a grumpy sarcastic voice filled the room. “Well, doesn’t it just warm the depths of my heart to see our two resident brains playing nice with each other.”
Steve sighed as his body melted against Tony. “I love you, too. Tonight was incredible, and I couldn’t stand the thought that I’d let you down somehow.”
Steve smiled at the memory. “You were about eight, and you made us rocket ships out of tin cans, cardboard and streamers. We would play space explorers.” Steve said as his eyes burned with emotion from the happy memory. “We had learned about the planets in school, and it was all you could talk about for months. You’d go on about how one day, we’d live on the moon and get to visit Jupiter. You wanted to know what was out there past Neptune. I remember about three years later when they discovered Pluto, you were still so excited. You’d said you were right, that there was more out there to find.”
He’d been up all night working on a new feature for the armor when Jarvis reminded him of his meeting with Strange.
“You can see why I allowed you in, now.” Phillips said. “That project was meant to be the future of the war, and I wasn’t going to risk him following through on his threat just to keep you out over identity fraud. I’d just make sure someone kept an eye on you at the facility. In his argument Erskine told me this project was about second chances. He said this was his second chance to use the formula the right way. Then he told me that it didn’t matter who you were before you got those papers. He said you were important and deserved the chance to prove it.”
Bucky remembered Tony’s story of “upgrading” (Tony’s term) that freezer. The butcher had been in a horrible mood that day, not at Tony obviously, but Bucky supposed marriage problems could do that to a person. “I hope he’s in a better mood this time.” Bucky told him.
“Good,” Is all Tony said before moving back.  He lightly flicked the tip of his tongue back and forth across his perineum, slowly moving up while only playing along the outer rim. Bucky moaned as his hips shifted, desperately trying to get Tony to move to his center. Tony gave his ass a swat to keep him still. Bucky groaned but stopped his movements, giving Tony control.
Tony prayed this would be enough, that their love would somehow defeat everything, that he would be able to keep them.
Steve snorted. “Are you kidding? It was great, Buck!” Then Steve went on to recount the story of Tony’s awesomeness, from his witty insults to his effortless defense against Joe’s attack. Tony had to admit that hearing Steve Rogers describe him in an almost awestruck voice was making his inner ten-year old squeal with delight.
Tony shook his head. “No, that stuff’s tricky. I wasn’t going to risk screwing it up. Mrs. Walsh on the second floor made this. I bought enough ingredients for two large batches. She kept one as payment, and I got the other. A fair trade.”
“It has taught me to see the measure of a man beyond what most people see. I know you are a smart man, most likely the genius you joke of being, so I know you have at least guessed that I am a man of science. Recently, however, I have come to learn of the belief of others in the mystical, a form of the divine outside of Christianity. At first, I believed it was merely a delusion of a psychotic and evil man who used that ideation to give himself an even grander sense of importance. To believe otherwise would have made him even more dangerous.
“Of course I wouldn’t write him off for that! Even if I wasn’t crazy about both of…,” Tony stopped as he filtered through what Bucky had just said. “Did you say we?”
I don't really want to say much more on this chapter because I don't want to spoil anything. So, enjoy? And please don't hate me.
Tony’s world exploded as he came. His vision blurred, and his mind shorted out and all he could do was feel. It was so intense. Steve’s promise of love followed by the order to let go sent Tony flying, and Steve stroked and fucked him through it until Tony felt his hips stop their movement as he cried out and released inside Tony.
“Look,” Bucky sighed before he continued in a lower voice that Tony had to strain his ears to hear, “I’m gonna go find Tony. Just…just be careful. Don’t get yourself arrested over doin’ something stupid.”
Tony sighed as he leaned his head forward to rest against Steve’s now chiseled stomach. One day Tony fully intended to find out if could clean his shirts on those washboard abs. “You’re right, baby. Of course, you’re right. I’m just tired I guess.”
“Next time you two birdbrains go for some afternoon delight, don’t do it in a supply closet I happen to be walking past. Though with the sounds Sam was making, I gotta admit I’m impressed. At least your mouth is good for something other than being annoying.”
“So why aren’t you still there recovering?” Howard had asked, walking around the table. His eyes had gone over Tony’s appearance, taking in every detail undoubtedly.
Tony was an incredible person, and last night had made him so happy, knowing Tony shared their affection. As he turned and watched Tony moving a couple of small pancakes onto a plate before adding more batter, he thought again of how bad last night could have gone.
“Good,” Steve said as he straightened to his knees again. He watched as Steve sweetly kissed Bucky’s cheek then whispered in his ear like before. Bucky nodded and reached to the space next to Tony’s head to grab a pillow then handed it to Steve.
Steve threw a napkin at his face, and Tony caught it laughing. Bucky just yanked it out of his hand and smacked him playfully on the back of his head with it.
“Uuhhnn…” Steve groaned thickly. His breathing sounded strained as he panted in wheezing breaths above Tony. “Yes,” he choked, “fuck…please, sir…”
Then he turned to Steve and answered his question more seriously. “And I chose this private room because I wanted you to myself without having to keep up the constant pretense that we are only friends. It’s not just because it’s fancier.”
Once during these little talks, he’d almost convinced himself that they were looking at him a certain way, different from before. He could have sworn there was something in their eyes as they listened to him talk about his life, but he furiously reminded himself that wishful thinking would only drive him insane.
Bucky thought tiredly. Yeah, he’d hoped to climb a little higher up the ranks than private or corporal, but he’d wanted to get there on his own terms. Now, it felt like he had to work just that much harder to make sure that someone like Williams wouldn’t get there first.
“Um, I think they only know the one song,” Steve said uncertainly and began wishing a hole would open and swallow him in it.
“At this point I don’t really care about the name,” Phillips said as he took another sip. “You could be Susie Sutton for all I care. You see, when I ask who you are, I want to know more than a name. You obviously know how little a thing like that can mean. So, help me do my job, and tell me who you are.”
“Thank you, I was a little worried what with me being by myself in the kitchen, but there’s only been one small fire…Kidding!” He said at their panicked looks. “Just kidding, trying to lighten the mood although now I can see that suggesting a house fire was not the way to go with that.”
“That’s close enough for me,” she said. “It’s somewhere to start. Hopefully, there will be more to find as the day passes. Pull up everything you have on the Howling Commandos with regards to the name Anthony Sutton.”
“How could I not?” the man called across the distance as he looked Steve over. “I have seen all your films!”
Steve appreciated that, but there was something else he wanted to know. “So, if Bucky is submissive and a bottom, is me being a service top just make me a dominant?”
“Holy shit, Stark is butterfly effecting them.” Clint said from his perch on the back of a chair, looking like a spectator at a ballgame.
“There you are, Sweetheart.” It was his Tony, and he looked so happy. Had Bucky made him happy? He liked that thought even as he continued to shiver. “You’re OK, now. Steve and I are right here.”
“I’ll say. They look kinda snug, but I guess that’s how they’re supposed to be.” James shrugged while shaking his head. “Why is there someone else’s name on them?”
“Mornin’ Nat,” Steve said, and everyone else murmured their greetings. Bucky just nodded to her, but she smiled and nodded back.
He entered the bar that was closed to the public at the moment, and spotted Tony sitting on a stool at the long counter. The dark wood of the countertop shone, even in the dim light, but the beauty of its shine could not compete with Tony. He looked like an actor in a movie. Dark, handsome and brooding as he leaned forward, his elbows on the polished wood. A tumbler of amber colored liquid was held in his hand. In his other hand, he held a cigarette.
The guy was hurt, but Bucky could hear him cursing as he continued to kick and struggle in their grip until they disappeared from view. The sound of the metal door slamming shut echoed throughout the prison block.
“You insist on buying most of the food,” Bucky continued. “You say it’s only fair because you don’t cook, but that’s not true anymore. You help Steve cook almost every night and then help with the cleanup. It’s why we won’t take your money for the rent. You do enough.”
With that, Tony turned and began walking to the door. He’d had enough, more than enough, and Steve was at home waiting for him. Just before he reached the door, Howard called out, “What about the tests?”
Bucky had been kind of surprised at the British officer’s sense of humor. It was dry and usually subtle, but in this hellish place, it was very much welcome.
“Like what?” She asked Tony sarcastically, finally glancing at him before turning back to Steve. “You heard the Colonel. Your friend is most likely dead.”
“Good, because I’ve learned from my mistakes, and I’m not going to let a valuable asset to our cause get overlooked again.” The man looked at him seriously. “If you’re ready, then as of this moment you are officially in the SSR. No consulting. No provisions. I can have a lab set up for you by the time we reach London, fully equipped with people to assist you.”
This is me dipping my toe into the smut, but unfortunately we won't be fully diving in for several more chapters. Which is good because writing smut is HARD. And me being an idiot, decided to write an explicit polyamory story for my first time writing. But rest assured it is coming, and it will be the longest chapter to post by the time it arrives since I'm trying to reward your patience through this slow burn.
The others nodded at that. “Sounds like a plan, Sarge,” Dugan said. “I hear we’ll get some time in London before they decide what to do with us. I spoke to the Captain. He’d just finished his meeting with Phillips, and he said they’re gonna be sending all of us for some R & R over there for a while. London means pubs, and pubs mean beer. I’m gonna drink ‘til I can’t stand up.”
“I think we’re the assholes.” Steve said. “You did all of this for us, and we didn’t even think that we should do something for Christmas. We just never really have since we’ve been on our own.”
“Good morning, Tony.” He greeted him quietly. Tony guessed Steve wasn’t awake yet. It was still an adjustment getting used to talking to this James, casual and friendly. It was even more strange when he considered that Steve Rogers was sleeping in while they were awake. That early riser thing must have been the serum.
Tony’s face looked wicked as he smirked at the reaction his words had gotten. “You like that, baby? You wanna be a good little soldier and follow my orders?”
Damn right it would be too late. Tony had never loved Steve’s stubbornness more than in this moment. Steve pulled up his pack and grabbed his shield as he moved to exit the tent with Tony at his heels. Agent Carter followed them as they moved into the open.
“Well, whatever the percent,” Bucky said, “I love that man and his cooking so shake a leg. In four days I’ll be eatin’ army grub.”
“Sorry, doll,” he murmured, almost forgetting the other people in the room. It had been so long since Steve’s eyes had shown with that brilliant light, and Bucky knew he was the cause for both its absence and return. “I’ll be good,” he said without thinking, and Steve’s breath hitched.
“So good,” Tony said as he did it again. His hips snapping up and connecting with Steve’s flesh with a slapping sound. Steve just braced himself on Tony’s thighs as he fucked into him, moaning and panting at the feeling of Tony filling him. Tony’s movements becoming faster as his hands squeezed Steve’s hips on each downward pull onto him.
“Tony,” Bucky groaned when he nipped sharply at where the neck met the shoulder, quickly soothing it with his tongue. He felt gravity take over and push the pants the remaining distance to the floor.
“Early?” Steve answered for James. “Tony its after six. You’ve been gone all day. We didn’t know if you were coming back.”
Without a particular destination in mind, he walked…and walked as he failed not to think of what he’d just heard. The sounds they’d made and words they’d spoken were seared into his mind, playing on repeat. After a while Tony had to admit one thing to himself.
Tony felt horrible watching Steve basically being ignored by his date, his discomfort written plainly on his face.
She looked down and nodded. “It was rather shocking,” She admitted before meeting his eyes again and whispering, “But it’s a relief to be honest. It’s been so hard these past years dealing with everything, and I’d just resigned myself to the fact that it probably wouldn’t get any better until one of us died. I was suffocating and couldn’t say anything about it. But now that he’s gone, it’s like I can breathe again.”
“You wanna come on my dick, sweetheart?” Tony panted as he started thrusting harder into him, nailing his prostate every other time. “Wanna show me how good you are? You gonna clench around me as I fill you up?”
Tony felt like a fish out of water. He’d picked Louise up at the apartment that he was sure she shared with her parents, a single lily in his hand for her. Because you know, he was a gentleman. They’d exchanged polite words on their walk to the dance hall, where he’d told her they’d be meeting Bucky and Steve with their dates.
“Do you mean suggesting room and board?” Monty asked. “Because I know of a few locations that most soldiers stay.” The others, except Dernier who’d never been to London before, nodded.
He walked to the table and poured a finger of bourbon in each of the glasses before he filled the rest with the chilled eggnog. And really, the boys needed to learn new facial gestures because the touched disbelief was quickly becoming too common a thing. They needed to get used to this. Tony was taking care of them, and this was just how life was going be.
“Tony, you don’t have to keep worryin’ over me. I’m fine now,” Bucky told him as he laid on his cot in the tent they’d provided for Steve. Of course, Steve had ordered that some of the men could share it because he didn’t need a whole tent to himself, and the camp was filled to capacity with all the rescued prisoners. More tents were being set up, but they were still having problems housing everyone.
“Never say never.” Tony told him. “I truly believe in you, Steve. I know what you’re capable of, and I can’t wait for everyone else to get to see it. You’re so much stronger than you realize.”
Bucky hurried to obey, and Steve held up a hand to help him into the water. “Come here, love. Let me help you feel better.”
