Suzanne just blinked. “Holy crap so you don’t even know this guy and you’re his contact? Where’s his family!?”
“Text me a list,” Dean said instantly. “I’ll bring you anything you need.” He stepped closer to the window. “Whatever you need.”
Castiel smiled so big his nose crinkled and Dean saw all of his teeth. Adorable. “This is your problem, Dean. You have no
He opened the hose and started rinsing Solomon off. Can’t leave a horse to dry in his sweat, not ever, but especially not in Florida. Poor thing would get eaten alive. He stuffed his phone in his waistband. Solomon arched his neck and snorted right in Michael’s face.
Castiel felt much better after a napping a few hours. He took a shower, and after donning his most comfortable t-shirt and sweats, decided to take a look in the back. The least he could do is bring Dean his ID and wallet.
Castiel opened his eyes. They were very blue, strongly shot with red. He smiled and for some reason Dean thought it wasn’t quite right. “Better than you are I’d wager.” He glanced at his watch. “I’m going to find your nurse and ask her about the ice chips, and it’s time for your pain medicine.” He retrieved something from the wall and placed it gently on Dean’s lap in front of his left hand. “If you need anything, push the red button. This is your call bell.” He went on to explain how the TV worked.  Dean thought this sounded like a canned speech he said by rote.
Dean gleaned at the crumpled fabric in his hand. “Yeah that would be great if it’s not too much trouble.”
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s just me, it’s just us,” Dean tells him warmly, settling next to him on the couch. “We don’t have to do anything,” He reaches along the back of the sofa, dragging the aphgan folded there down into their laps. “Here, lay down with me, Cas.”
Cas always picked up Dean’s left hand and tried to talk him through it. “Hey bud,” he smiled. “I’m Castiel, one of the nurses here. You’re in the hospital. You had a really bad car accident a few days ago and you’ve been in the ICU. You’ve been really sick but you’re getting better every day.”
, you don’t…I’ve been afraid that you’re going to go back to your real life and that I’d never see you again.” He took their clasped hands and raised them to his mouth where he placed kissed on Dean’s knuckles. He carefully squeezed a hug the best he could in this position. “I want you to build a garden out back. Grill me burgers, and visit me at work. I want to meet all the rest of your family, and have you meet mine, although you’ve already met one of them.”
“I know it hurts, Dean, but try for me okay? You’re doing really good, just wiggle your toes for me!” He didn’t want to disappoint Rumbly, like he disappointed everyone else. He breathed. He tried to move his toes. He kept breathing.
“Oh definitely,” Castiel responded. “There is a really good orchard not far from me, maybe—” He stopped himself.
He pulled on clothes and grabbed his keys. He turned back at the last moment and grabbed his ID badge, then he headed out.
Castiel’s grin is feral. Dean’s rather large cock is fully hard now, and Castiel squirms on top of it. The heartfelt moan is music to his ears. Then he leans down close and licks a stripe up Dean’s neck, stopping to nibble on his mating gland. “I’m gonna ride you until I come, Alpha.”
Dean hands off the bouquet to Sam, and reaches out for Castiel’s hands. He leans close, whispering, “You were right, I only needed a first date to know I wanted you for the rest of my life.” He squeezes Cas’s fingers. “You ready for this?”
Turning back to his stack of bridles, Castiel said irritably, “Well after I thought about it, I wasn’t exactly sure that –”
“Uh, yeah, Sammy,” he ignored his brother’s glare. “He caught me finishing up his yard and wanted to thank me with some awesome burgers.” Dean waggled his eyebrows and Jack giggled.
In the barn’s office, Gabriel pulled his phone out of his boot. “Oh ha fucking ha Cassie, “ he muttered. “Michael is going to lose. His. Shit.”
“I was scared,” Cas interrupts him. “I just, I just-” He looks skyward, then, shaking his head, just tells the truth. “I really like you, and I’ve never felt like this before, and it’s, it’s kinda freaking me out a little.” I just really want to be with you, he thinks. A large part of him is so pissed at Jimmy! How could he throw this wonderful guy away like this?
“I know, right? That’s what I’ve been saying for days. How can you not miss someone whose been missing for four days?”
A deep sigh from beside his bed woke Dean from his dozing. Castiel leaned back in the chair rubbing the bridge of his nose.
The pair walked up to the main barn from the dressage ring. Michael liked to check on the horses every chance he had. Horses were well known to be injury prone and if there were any pasture accidents he wanted to know, yesterday! He sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead where it trickled down his face. Florida. He would rather be freezing to death in the South Dakota barn with his brothers but…someone had to keep an eye on Dad. Gabriel and Castiel were too much alike to be separated. And as much as Michael hated to admit it, he knew his younger brothers had continued to grow even closer when Castiel moved back up north.
“You don't understand, Dean,” Castiel said, staring directly into Dean’s eyes. “I refuse to take the chance you don’t know.”  The world stopped, and the only sound Dean heard was his breathing, choppy and shallow.
Dean absolutely would have stood there longer and shouted at Cas some more but a large warm hand clamped on his shoulder and spun him around.
Eventually he noticed that his was the only car on the road. The double laned highway had narrowed down to a winding two lane blacktop that twisted past country stores and closed wineries. He pulled his cell phone from his jacket. No signal. Awesome.
In short, Castiel looked like he’d just walked off a photo shoot. Dean wanted to clear his throat, or say ‘Hi’ or something, but his throat was dry. He thought up and discarded about a thousand things to say in the space of a second. Dean couldn’t help but give the dark haired boy another appreciative glance. So that, of course, was when Cas finally noticed him.
To his surprise the man eventually croaked, “…Dean.” He coughed a few times, which looked like agony. Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes.
The poor napkin Dean’s been tearing up is basically just paper fluff now. “Hey, do you maybe...wanna get out of here?”
Cas didn’t feel guilty in the slightest about window stalking the hot guy. He did feel kind of guilty about letting his lawn get so overgrown, though. He certainly had enough money to hire a lawn service now. The flip side to working so much overtime is that you didn’t have enough time or energy to spend money. Still, it was hard to care about grass when so many people were dying.
The mare turned her head right around so she could peer at Castiel with one eye, then bit the tip of his boot. Castiel rolled his eyes, and nudged his heels into her sides. “Come on pony, time to do some work.” She took a few trotting steps, and then bolted into a gallop.
“Humor me, bro.” He moved to stand next to his brother, eyeing the suspiciously clean leather. “Sometimes it helps to use words.”
In reality, a patient with the kind of injuries Dean has would be sent to the step down unit after the breathing tube came out. The ICU really isn't the best place to recover. Moreover, Dean should absolutely go to rehab to get some strength back.
“I like it too much,” Dean tells him seriously. He takes a step back. “You want something to drink? Beer?”
Finally, Cas managed to look Dean in the eye. “I really liked what you were doing with your mouth. That was…really good,” he smiled a little. “I wasn’t expecting…” He winced and looked at the shattered lamp on the floor. His smile wavered. “I didn’t mean to ruin the um, moment.”
“You were sick,” Castiel said slowly. Wonderingly. His body felt flushed and waves of heat swept from his head down his entire body.
So this was fun to write. The boys just felt like being insecure today! Thank God Gabriel is around to rescue Grumpy Cas from his mood.  Please comment to tell me what you think! I really want to know. Thanks!
“I broke my phone when I threw it across the room,” Castiel improvises. “This is my brother Castiel’s phone. I’m borrowing,” he adds belatedly. “Look, Dean, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean anything I said. I hate that I hurt you and I want to make it up to you. If-if you let me.” He clutches the phone, feeling his heart racing.
Dean pressed his lips together while he let those comments settle. “My turn, okay? A- I drink, I won’t deny that. I don’t do drugs though. Not even pot. B-Home health people, those patients are like really jacked up right? They can’t leave the house?” He waited for Castiel answering nod. “Great. I’m not gonna be trapped in a house, man.” He shook his phone. “There’s this thing called Uber. Or Lyft. I know how to use the app store, promise.”
“Cas,” he says again, maybe just because he likes the shape of it in his mouth, on his lips, “You don’t look anything like your brother.” Then they’re kissing again, lips parting and tongues, god yes, and Castiel is rocking against Dean’s thick thigh pressed right up against his cock. He digs his blunt fingernails into Dean’s skin, drawing a gasp from him. He feels the answering length of hardness as Dean pushes back against him. Both of them are gasping and moaning. They’ve already flung their shirts off to parts unknown and Cas is fumbling with Dean’s stupid jeans-
He probably should have called the cops and filed a police report but…honestly it just felt like a lot of work, okay? So sue him. Dean would have to deal with his insurance company eventually. Castiel opened the glovebox. He found a laminated insurance card as well as a tire air gauge, one of those doodads to break glass in case of emergency and a couple of little green army guys. He used his phone to take a picture of the insurance card, then stuffed everything in there and closed the glovebox.
The other weird thing is that Cas has not had as much, um…experience as Dean might have expected. Which was cool! Don’t get him wrong. But sometimes Castiel’s unexpected startle reactions have led to Dean having to abruptly change course so he didn’t push Cas to do anything he didn’t want to.
Dean brought his left hand to his face tried to swipe away whatever goop was sticking there. Blinking rapidly, he peered down at his hand, trying to make sense of what he saw.  His fingers were covered in a deep maroon sticky liquid.
His rumbly voice in Dean’s ear said, “Is it wrong that I am really happy you hit a deer? I would never have wished you to go through so much pain and suffering, but I am just so…
“Like what, give me an example.” Dean said, tapping the fingers on his right hand against the covers.
After feeding all the horses, Castiel took the gator back up to the main barn and parked it.  Here at the top of the hill the wind whipped sharper through his clothes, and he felt it acutely even through his heavy jacket.  He ignored his discomfort in favor of wandering down the row of stalls, checking on the show horses and older horses who came in at night.
“NOVAK AND WINCHESTER—” Castiel’s head spun around. The hell? Who was coach talking to? “—GET YOUR ASSES OVER HERE…NOW. The rest of you hit the showers.”
“Want to see something funny?” Castiel nudged Sam. He used the picture he’d just sent Dean but opened a group message to Michael and Gabriel. He sent the picture and then:
“Mister Novak?” A tall black man in grey OR scrubs held the door open as he looked around. His ID badge read: John Williams, MD.
Since Cassie was occupied not looking Gabe in the face, Gabe went back to the tack room and grabbed his phone.  Shaking his head he sent a message. To Mikey:
Gabe clucked his tongue. “Man, he looked like dogshit when you got him here. More of his blood on you than in him.” He peered at Castiel. “You back at work yet?”
“I wouldn’t say that,” Castiel said firmly, making Dean meet his eyes. “You are part of a wonderful family. You take care of people who need it.” Castiel pulled away from the eye contact and said to the table. “Dean, I didn’t even realize how alone I was until… well.” He pressed his lips together briefly. “You have made...an immense difference...to me.” Slowly, he reached across the table and covered Dean’s hand with his own. He looked up into green eyes.
“Hey, when I was younger, sure. But I’m in my mid-thirties. I’m not going out trolling or anything. I feel like the holidays mean more if—” He suddenly found his food very fascinating. “—If you’re with someone you care about. Otherwise, it’s just another day.” Dean made himself look at Cas and then couldn’t look away.
“I really want to give you a hug, man.”  Dean waited a beat, expecting some sort of response. When he didn’t get one, that’s when he realized how much he’d fucked up. Cas still had his face turned away, so Dean couldn’t see his expression. Fuck it, he thought and dug in his left leg so he could drag the right one closer to the left side of the bed, where Cas was still perched like he’s getting ready to bolt.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you, I just wanted a chance to thank you in person.” Dark Hair nodded at the glass in his hand.
Castiel stopped at the second stall, leaning over with his arms resting on the stall door. He closed his eyes for a moment, just listening to Beefcake munching on his hay.
“Gabe, my friend, thinks that Dean concussed himself in the accident. Post-concussion syndrome is pretty common after head trauma. I’ve noticed Dean is sensitive to bright lights, and focused concentration like reading makes his headaches worse.”
Dr. Williams nodded. “There was a lot of swelling, and we lost the pulses for a short time. We left the OR and went directly to interventional radiology. The vascular surgery team was concerned about compartment syndrome. Ultimately, the IR team put in a large drain, as they felt that there was a collection of blood that was causing the elevated pressure and contributing to vascular compromise.” He added, “Ortho is following as well.”
Dean felt rather than saw Cas take a big breath and slowly let it out. Castiel took his good hand and squeezed it before threading their fingers together.
Gabe’s phone pinged with a voice message. He played it, and scowled. Michael’s laughter filled the air.
His brother only laughed merrily and clapped a hand on his shoulder.  “Come on kiddo, time to get some grub.”
He lives a relatively quiet and simple life. He’s a single Omega of 35 years. He lives by himself, he has a good job that he doesn’t hate (executive secretary for the Vice President of Finance at the local bank), benefits which pay most of the cost for his suppressants and blockers, a week of heat leave every 3 months and 4 weeks of paid vacation time.
Dean’s eyebrows are somewhere near his hairline. Woops. Does Jimmy hate wine or something? “You know I don’t do wine.” Oh. Kay.
Dean was really sick of Netflix. He was sick of 24-hour news. He was sick of Law and Order. This was the second week of his stay with Castiel and Cas’s first week back at work after his long vacation. It was a little weird still to be here in Castiel’s space when he was at work. At least he could use his right arm a teeny little bit these days. Not to lift anything, oh hell no, but he was under orders to move it around a little more so he didn’t get a frozen shoulder.
“Well, I wanted to be with you too,” Dean says softly and Cas hears muffled sounds from Dean’s end of the call. “Sweetheart,” and Castiel’s heart breaks a little at how hesitant Dean sounds. “Do you, maybe, want to meet me somewhere?”
was Dean’s family? His accident was what, four days ago? Didn’t anybody miss him? Wasn’t anyone worried about him? Castiel was worried sick! He shook his head, irrationally furious at people he’d never met and wasn’t even sure if they existed.
The black monstrosity was exactly where he’d last seen it. Crumpled half in his shed.  He had hired a mason to fix the brickwork a couple years ago when the mortar had started crumbling. He hoped idly that he had that guys number somewhere. Castiel walked around the vehicle slowly. He spent a long time looking at the driver’s door laying on the ground. He truly did not remember doing that. He remembered jiggling the handle and that the door was stuck. He remembered thinking this man is going to die because I can’t open his car door. And then he just…pulled it off.
His appetite wasn’t great, though, and he’d lost a lot of weight. He normally went about 195 and as of this morning he was topping off at 170. He knew this because the night nurses used the bed scale to get his weight every morning. Once he’d cracked 175, a nutritionist had appeared with lots of papers and pamphlets and talked for a long time about protein intake and caloric needs. Turns out you needed a lot of protein for healing and they thought Dean wasn’t eating enough.  So at every meal they brought him supplements in cans, which he mostly left on the tray.
The twenty minutes it took to drive over to Perdition Farm were some of the longest of Dean’s life.  The farm was at the end of a long gravel road that made Dean wince as he drove over it. Tall black fencing bordered the farm, and from what Dean could see from the car, separated the fields from each other.  He saw lots of horses from the road- in every conceivable color: black ones, brown ones, red ones, blonde ones, even some with spots like Dalmatians. One had a dark stripe that ran down it’s back all the way to it’s tail.
“From what I understand, your brother was a hot mess looking for you all over this state. Castiel said that he gave him the third degree! And,” she continued, “I’m pretty sure that he’ll be here before you know it. And won’t he be so proud to see you sitting up out of bed? I’ll make sure he knows how difficult it is after what you’ve been through.” Hannah seemed to produce a box of tissue from thin air. “There you go, wipe your face off, you’re okay, honey.”
Dean Winchester moved back to Lawrence Kansas right before the pandemic really got going. Nobody he knows, knows anyone who’s had covid yet, but the reports out of Italy and New York City were pretty terrifying.  Luckily for him, his brother Sam and his wife Jess, have nice cushy jobs and can afford to hire Dean as their in home nanny for their 9 month old son Jack.
He looped the end of the lead rope through the other side of her halter, and led her over to the fence. He climbed up the fence rails, and swung a leg over her back. “Okay beauty, don’t do anything too stupid, all right?”
“Me too, buddy.” Dean said. He rocked back and forth on his heels like he was hesitating, then opened his arms and hugged Castiel again.
Cas couldn’t concentrate. The ancient manuscript sat neglected in front of him, while the angel idly tapped a pencil against the desk. Something…strange, Cas decided. Not a prayer exactly, and not exactly
Novak’s blue eyes were almost glowing. “The kind that doesn’t feel like work,” he said, turned smartly on his heel, and left.
“There’s no way in hell I’m coming back to town tonight. When I get up this afternoon, I’m gonna start watching Stranger Things on Netflix. People keep asking me if I’ve seen it and looking at me with this ‘oh you poor sweet old man’ expression when I tell them I haven’t.”
Gabriel pulled up the picture he’d snapped of Dean fucking Winchester outside the school’s administration office staring at Castiel like a lunk head, and sent it. He smirked at his phone, waiting for a response.
“Oh, come on, do I feel like company now?”  He wiped his mouth with the hand towel, smearing toothpaste on it, and stomped downstairs to get the door.
Castiel looks out at his family, his friends. He snorts but his eyes are sparkling. “Of course I am. You know I love weddings.”
Please leave me a comment and let me know what you liked and what you didn't. I haven't written anything in a while and would appreciate the feedback. Hope you enjoy, this chapter was super fun to write.
The smallest of snorts. “Your…bedside…manner…is…awful…” Dean gritted out. He felt the warmth from the man’s body as he leaned closer- through the broken drivers window. “Y’name,” he said. “ ‘s y’name.” No deep breaths. Short and shallow wins the race.
“Exactly.” Cas pulled two bottles from the fridge handing one off to Dean and twisting one open for himself. “I think we’re ready.” He flipped the burgers onto the toasted buns and set them aside on plates, then grabbed the fries and doled them out. “If you bring the plates, I’ll grab the rest.”
Dean had been so eager to get Castiel’s cock in his mouth that Cas had totally forgotten all the things they’d never talked about. And Dean was going to be so disappointed when he heard that Castiel was
Over the next couple of days, Dean’s discharge plans took shape. After more discussions with Castiel and, at his insistence, with Sam, Cas agreed to let Dean stay with him for a few weeks. It did actually make sense for some reasons. The orthopedic specialists that had worked on Dean preferred him to stay in state in case of any complications. The University Medical Center had an outpatient rehab center close to the hospital that Sam agreed to drive Dean to three times a week. Sam was renting an AirBNB apartment a few towns over, and planned to spend time with Dean, and doing his own thing.
Bobby had issued this pronouncement over the baked chicken he’d cooked, while Sam shoveled piles of mashed potatoes on his plate and then smothered it with butter. Dean had been caught unawares; a forkful of potatoes and peas dangling from the tines, as he stared at his guardian.  “I mean it, Dean,” Bobby said. “You’ve been worrying about the whole world as long as you can remember. It’s time for you to worry about you.” The older man chewed thoughtfully. “I think if you don’t learn how to do that now, son, that you might never learn it.”
Dean was getting better though. His clavicle was healing well according to the x-rays and he could start therapy on it soon. His right ankle-elevated on pillows whether he wanted it there or not-was nearly normal sized, if still varying colors. The purple bruising extended all the way up to his toes. He could pee and poop (which made the nurses weirdly happy for some reason) and the staples in his head were gone.
“Hey man, you okay? Have you had anything to eat or drink lately?” Joe looked him over thoroughly, and Cas knew he could see the black circles and sunken eyes he was currently rocking.
telling the truth about his ass in breeches. Anyway, this year Castiel was a whole year older than the rest of his year mates. So he was older, and stronger and in spite of his status as an outcast, he was picked pretty early for teams. Which made it much less likely for the in-crowd people to want to mess with him.
He mowed carefully around the overgrown Crepe Myrtle trees, ignoring the impulse to prune away all the dead and crossing branches. He pushed the mower this way and that, making a crosshatch of lines in the lawn. The weather was cool but his shirt was dripping with sweat and he stopped to pull it off, flinging it carelessly across one shoulder,wiping his face with it. After 30 minutes he’s done and he released the handle, letting it shut off.
“I mean, you can stay,” Dean said quickly. He tried to raise his right arm out of habit, and froze with a wince. “I can’t sleep.”
Hands are on either side of his face and then those perfect lips are on his. Dean is kissing him like the world has fallen away and there’s just the two of them in a bubble of perfection. Cas thinks he’s been waiting for this moment his entire life. He licks into Dean’s mouth, moaning against the silky slide on their tongues. His heart is racing and blood is pounding through his system. Dean is sucking on his neck, pulling blood to the surface and licking over the tender skin.
. Everything seemed far away. His eyelids were pried open and a bright light about blinded him. The world snapped back into place. He tried to talk but a weak croak was the only noise that came out. He blinked a bunch of times. His vision was blurred up and his head felt like a silver spike had been thrust through it.
man, was riding a horse bareback up from the field, at what looked like warp speed. Four or five horses thundered behind him and great clouds of dust swirled in their wake. The sound of a stampede preceded Castiel, but when he crested the hill he seemed to relax and sat back on the horse. He moved…he moved like he was part of the animal. To Dean’s amazement, the brown horse Cas rode slowed down and stopped almost right in front of him. Castiel hopped off. He started patting her neck and murmuring to her in a deep voice that made Dean’s stomach twist. The horse shoved her face in Cas’s chest, knocking him back a few steps. Castiel laughed, a delighted sound that was full of joy.
Sam and Jess lived in a 3 bedroom craftsman house which had all the bells and whistles.  It was dove gray with bright white trim.Two car garage, stone columns in the front porch with deep overhanging eaves and visible rafters.  The front lawn was mowed with surgical precision and flowers lined the walkway from the street to the porch.
“You know what, I don’t think I will,” Dean says, cocking his head to the side. His face is carefully blank. He has Cas by both arms now, grip firm on his biceps, holding him in place.
He knew that sometimes nurses cried at the desk after a patient was nasty to them. He knew that if you pissed off one nurse, all of them would be pissed. He knew that nurses went toe to toe with doctors about patient care. He knew that most nurses lived on diet coke, graham crackers and peanut butter. Which reminder- he knew that you can never go wrong by ordering food for the nursing staff.
“I would hit every damn deer in the state if it brought me to you. Crash through a hundred fences, roll down a thousand mountainsides…” Dean smiled as Cas chuckled under him, nearly giggling. “…And every time you ask me to do something, you know what I’m going to say?”
Castiel’s house was a single level ranch with wide door frames and large bathrooms. Castiel sometimes wondered if an older couple had upgraded those things expecting to be needing wheelchairs. At any rate, he was glad for it now because Dean would need a wheelchair to get around. The fractured clavicle was healing well but crutches were impossible at present.
Oh. Dude clearly worked at the hospital. Dean wondered exactly how much the guy worked since he’d been here for four months and never seen hide nor hair of him. Come to think of it, Dean realized, he never saw anyone else over there either. The pimpmobile was the only car in the driveway. Single guy maybe? Dean shook his head, feeling bad for the neighbor.  Difficult enough to try and get by in the middle of a pandemic, but doing it by yourself? Ugh. Dean shook his head. Awful.
This patient was trached and sedated. She had been doing so well after her lung transplant but sadly had caught an infection in her lungs. She was on three pressors, an inotrope, an anticoagulant and an insulin infusion. A bedside dialysis machine at the foot of the bed connected to a giant specialized line in her neck.
When Michael stopped for lunch, he saw that Gabriel had responded with a thumbs up emoticon. Typical.
Sammy sighed. “I just don’t see what the big deal is. Just ask the dude if he wants to hang out or something. Jesus. I mean, people do it every day, Dean.”
“I mean,” Dean said, “That when we were hanging out at Cas’s house last night we was like, you should totally hang out at the barn tomorrow with me.”
“Of course.”  His fingers closed over the little ones in his grasp. Carefully—using just a little grace to ease the way—Cas helped Dean emerge from under the bed.  He watched the boy settle on his knees. Cas stayed on the floor, merely shifting to a more comfortable position with his legs crossed.
“Dude. Are you even kidding me right now?” Dean sounded incredulous. “Who do you think I learned it from?”
Back at the main barn, a slender man with golden brown hair paced back and forth in front of the wash stalls. His black tall boots were clean, but well worn. He wore a heavy winter coat over his riding clothes and carried his helmet wedged under one arm. He greeted Castiel with wide eyes and exaggerated tapping an invisible watch.
coming home and finding Dean watching tv in his living room, or laying down in the guest bedroom. It was…cozy to come home to a house with the lights on, and amazing smells coming from the kitchen, especially when Cas knew damn well Dean couldn’t do any cooking.
Looking anywhere but at Dean, Cas perched on the edge of the bed, his hands clasped in his lap. No, no, no, that was no good, his body language was telling Dean exactly how uncomfortable he was. It was making Dean’s chest hurt to look at. He inched closer, reaching out and squeezing Castiel’s bicep, before sliding his hand down the rest of his arm and capturing his hand. Reassuringly, Castiel slid his fingers through Dean’s and squeezed. Whew. Okay.
“Okay, well I don’t know about you two but—” Dean made a show of yawning hugely. “Gosh, I’m pooped. Shouldn’t have missed my two afternoon naps, right Cas?”
“It would have been fine,” she continued, “but he was REAL MAD and was coming straight up off the bed, like, growling at us and shit, and he tanked his pressure like whoa, and his oxygen was in the toilet.” She shook her head silently. “Worse thing is you just know it was really hurting him to do all that especially with his fucked up ribs. Anyway, while we were getting ready to intubate he started coughing real bad, couldn’t clear his secretions, and vomited.”
Gabriel appeared back in the doorway and Dean hastily removed his hand. He felt himself flushing as he examined the tops of his boots.  A long silence ensued. Dean raised his head and saw the two brothers engaged in a silent conversation. He grabbed his bag. “I better get back to, um, class. See you around, Cas.” And bolted.
to watch this man die because he couldn’t open a god-damned car door! A rush of heat swept through Castiel, starting at his head and sweeping instantaneously through his body. He reached out and pulled the door off the car, flinging it behind him in the grass. He leaned over and unbuckled Dean’s seatbelt.
Novak who never had given Dean his first name. Novak, who sat with him in the back and made snarky comments under his breath. Novak, who showed up at school every morning and ate a truly gigantic breakfast.  Novak who groaned when he got up from chairs and dragged himself up the three flights of steps between first and second period. Novak, who frequently had bruises on his cheekbones or his jawline or his chin, and never ever answered when Dean asked about them. Novak, who liked to give Dean long searching looks as if he was trying to see into Dean’s soul.  And Dean, well…if he returned those long searching looks it was only because he was trying to figure out how anyone’s eyes could POSSIBLY be that blue. It was. Really.
Cas gave report to Meg, the night nurse. He checked his phone in the locker room and found it had died sometime earlier. The ICU must be lined in lead, he thought, annoyed. His cell phone sometimes got kicked off the wifi and spent hours trying to connect back. Except you had to put a password in every time so your phone just kept trying and trying. Ugh. He pulled a charger out of his backpack and plugged it in. He’d missed a message from Dean. Double fuck. He swiped the phone open.
Sam appeared to be stunned. “You hit a deer and crashed into his shed?” His voice rose until it approached octaves not normally used.
Dean had felt Bobby’s eyes land on him. It felt like Bobby was trying to tell him something without actually saying it.  The older man turn back to Dean’s dad. “It’s happening, John. They’ll stay with me until BOTH of them graduate, and not a second before.”  And John Winchester, former marine, for a moment had just---diminished. Like he shrank or something.
“No, no, no. Nothing like that. I can pretty much do for myself most stuff. I mean I’ll need stupid help like with buttons or, no it’s just…”
“I hate this fucking pandemic.” Castiel said harshly, then rubbed his eyes. “Sorry-I. Sorry. You’re right, I just, I had one second and I forgot, can you believe that?” He looked like he was fighting back tears. “I don’t really have a bubble, is the thing. I go to work and then I come home to an empty house. I was thinking about getting a dog before all this started, but now I work so much that it wouldn’t be fair.” He shook his head, looking up at the sky. “I literally can’t remember the last time someone even hugged me.”
He glared at the can of Ensure on his tray table. He carefully picked it up with his left hand and shook it carefully. He pried the tab up, and forced himself to take a drink. It was disgusting. He gave it a long look, sighed, and took another drink. He would do whatever it took to heal up.
Castiel was unsurprised to watch Dean becoming more and more agitated as physicians came in to watch him follow commands. Finally, he said, “Guys, how many times does he need to wiggle his toes? Let the man rest, can’t you see he’s exhausted and in pain?” He may or may not have let irritation creep into his voice.
“I just did what anyone else would have done, Gabe. I’m not special.” Castiel smiled at the barista and took a sip of his latte. “See you around,” he told the doctor.
“Hello Dean,” Castiel said softly. “It’s Castiel. I’m the person who found you after your car accident. You’re in the hospital now. You did really good.” He picked up Dean’s hand hesitantly, then a little surer. Touch was very important for patients. Cas gently squeezed Dean’s fingers. “I hope you don’t mind,” he continued, “but I’m going to stay with you tonight. Your nurse is—” He looked to the white dry erase board and breathed a sigh of relief. “Your nurse is Meg tonight. She’s one of my friends and I know you’re in very good hands.”
I did it! I finished a story! Thank you so much for reading and please consider leaving a comment. I really want to know what you think. :)
Dean received two picture attachments back to back. From C Novak he had a selfie of Cas’s chin scraped raw and bleeding. From Sammy he got a fucked up picture of blood all over one side of his face.
Dean stared at his lap morosely until Castiel tapped him on the left knee to get his attention. “If it makes you feel any better, I truly don’t mind. I’d rather do that than suction a trach. Secretions.” He shuddered dramatically. “That’s gross. Shit is fine.”
One ridiculously bright morning in late August, Castiel pulled into his driveway with the sense of something out of place. On autopilot, he grabbed his work bag and got out of the car. The smell of freshly mowed grass lingered in the air. Half asleep, he walked up to the porch and methodically began removing his clothes. He toed his shoes off and stuffed them in the plastic grocery bag he kept on the porch. He pulled his scrub top off over his head knocking his sunglasses from their perch on his nose. He picked them up, idly noting the blades of grass scattered across the  porch. He stopped and looked out into his yard, confused. Something was definitely different, he just didn't know what and was too exhausted to figure it out.
to see his horses. He wanted to bicker with Gabriel in the indoor arena while Gabriel blew into his hands to warm them up and Cas complained about his legs being noodles. He wanted to listen to Beefcake munch on hay while he mucked his stall. He wanted to see what kind of bitchface his little mare had in store for him.
Thursdays were always heinous, and it carried through from one shift to another. The cardiac surgeons had a full OR of scheduled cases, the thoracic surgeons had a full slate and so did vascular. Not to mention that Thursdays were notorious for always having an emergent transplant come in. Of course, unexpected admissions happened. Someone would be at home and then WOOPS, their Aorta dissected. Or, more commonly, someone codes in the hospital, gets resuscitated and then needs an immediate ICU bed.
“Motherfucker,” Castiel muttered, keeping his head turned to avoid the tracheal secretions and re attached the vent tubing to the trach. “Give me shit any day.” He glared at Jess as she finished rolling the patient to Castiel. He held her carefully, making sure the multiple IV lines didn’t get caught, and that the vent stayed connected.
“Want to show you the orchard on top of the mountain. Make you a pie.” Dean heard way Cas relaxed into this new dynamic. His deep rumbly voice settled something deep within Dean. “Want to go wine tasting. Take you to all the breweries. Hike Old Rag. Camp in the Shenandoah. Want you to stay,” he finished, sounding almost shy.
At that, Novak snorted.  “Well, Dean, you’re not wrong.” That signaled the end of the conversation apparently, as Novak hoisted his messenger bag up to his shoulder, wincing just a bit, and then split.
“So, you don’t have a mate yet, do you have a boyfriend? Or, girlfriend, I don’t judge.” Dean smiles like it’s a loaded weapon.
“Dean, I don’t…” Castiel’s voice broke a little. He looked away and swallowed. “I don’t know if you’ll like me as much once you get out of here. I don’t want you to be stuck with me while-”
Cas chuckled. “Um, yeah, otherwise nobody in this place would get a wink. Let me check in with your night nurse. Be right back.”
Just like that, Dean relaxed and seemed a world lighter. “Hey, let me get your number?” He took his phone out of his pocket and unlocked it, pushing it over to Cas.
No one answered. Cas wandered through the Bunker to the kitchen. A yellow post it note was stuck to the refrigerator.
Of all the classes Castiel had to take he dreaded gym the most. Not because he wasn’t fit, because he certainly
Castiel couldn’t help having…doubts. After all there were things Hannah didn’t know about Dean. Just like there were things Dean kept to himself. Cas didn’t want to presume by asking anything. The other thing was, Cas really
Dean waited patiently at first, then impatiently as time passed and his phone remained stubbornly messageless.
“I know you are, Dean. But it’s okay. I will keep you safe.” He nodded, then held out a hand. “Won’t you come out?”
Cas scooted closer. Dean took a moment to breath in his scent. Clean, so clean. Carefully, Dean reached around Castiel until he gripped the other man’s shoulder and tugged him close. He rubbed his thumb reassuringly over Castiel’s arm. Dean rested his chin on Castiel’s head, now tucked between his shoulder and neck. “See? Better, right?”
Compartmentalization, he reminded himself. Castiel took some deep breaths. He clocked out and headed home.
How did this guy always seem to know what he needed, Dean wondered. Save my life, great but the fact he sticks around and hangs out with me in the hospital…Dean knew he should probably find it…weird…but mostly it felt…kinda good.
One August morning Dean had finished with the mowing and sat on the porch, wiping his face with a bandana and chugging ice water as sweat dripped down his back. He leaned back in the white wicker rocking chair and sat his glass on the rail. He heard a car coming down the street and blinked as the enormous Lincoln Continental pulled into the driveway next door. Dean leaned forward. He had never seen the mysterious neighbor at all, even after all these months, and he was curious.
“You’re getting better Dean. You’re young and strong, and you’re going to be just fine. You just need a little time. Just keep breathing, you’ll be okay.”
Dean stood up and handed his soiled shirt over. He quickly pulled the clean shirt on, feeling much better. He chuckled, sitting down on the black leather sofa. “I’m just gonna shoot my brother a text so they don’t wonder where I am. Oh, and if you call this a mess I’m a little scared to see what you call clean.”
“Cas,” Dean says again, and his voice sounds funny, sounds thick somehow, and he draws back just a little, just enough so that Castiel can look right into his green eyes and--
He wasn’t running. He wasn’t. Stadium of fans notwithstanding. Dean Winchester turned onto the first highway he could find. Where he was going didn’t matter. Nothing did. After tonight his career as a country singer was over, plain and simple, and nothing he did would change that.
Cas is still pretty sore from last night but the suppressants are well and truly gone now, and his body’s biology is for once helping him out. His ass is tingling and he feels a tickle of dampness start. His vision is tinged gold at the edges and he knows his eyes have turned. His Mate is here, and they’ve jump started each other’s cycle.
“I found you in my backyard, managed to get you in my car and took you to this hospital. Don’t worry, it’s the best hospital in the state. I’m Castiel, by the way, in case you forgot.”
The lines on Sam’s forehead were out in force as bitchface#4 came out. “Thanks for the pizza. Text me when you get up tomorrow,” he said to Dean while giving him a
“Dean, I’m. So sorry. My…anxiety got a hold of me and I think I may have had a small panic attack. You…you helped me get through it. How did you know all those right things to say?”
Dean sighed and gingerly leaned back. The thing in his neck turned out to be a huge IV line. Every time he moved it flopped around and made the stitches pull. Hannah had already redressed it once today and it was not an experience he cared to repeat anytime soon. Scowling was also to be avoided. He had no idea how he had nearly scalped himself in the accident, but they’d told him he had a nasty ‘scalp lac’ that had required a lot of attention. They had tried to glue it shut, but eventually had just stapled it. So he was going to look like Frankenstein.
He screamed again when they laid him on a stretcher. Too many people around him, and he was so cold. Why were they cutting his clothes off? Pinches on his arm followed by the sensation of cool. His teeth chattered. Beeping. So much beeping. Words passed over him that made no sense. Rumbly voice was somewhere. What was his name? Casper? Cass?
He yanked it open, expecting Gabriel or Michael. But hands stuffed in his pockets, Dean fucking Winchester stood on his front porch.
Dean shucked off his jacket and laid it over the back of the couch.  He sat down at the other end of the couch from Cas.  When he looked up, Cas was staring down at his phone with a murderous expression.  “Listen hey, if it’s not cool, I can go…” Dean really did not want to leave.
A man entered the room and pushed a button to silence the beeping.  He glanced over at Dean and then his eyes widened comically. “You’re awake!”
Dean snickered. “I figured from the picture he sent me a little while ago. It should have been titled, “Grumpy Cas is Grumpy.” He pulled up the photo and extended his arm, showing Cas. “Kinda funny, you know, I mean, that look, that’s mostly how I felt today.”
Dean arrived late to the first day of school.  He scowled as he stomped through the corridors, trying to figure out where the biology classroom was. All around him, perfectly groomed kids greeted each other with shouts, hugs and the occasional catcall.  Perfect, Dean thought, starting a new school in the middle of the year.  What should have been his senior year was only his junior. He’d been pulled out of more schools than he could remember during the last six years.
“I know it does, Bud. We'll give you some medicine to make it hurt less, but I can’t make it all go away okay?”
Dean slowly removed his thumb from his mouth. “Cas,” he said in a voice so much higher than the angel was used to. The boy’s eyes filled up with tears again. “Cas,” he said plaintively, “I needed you but you weren’t
“No,” Castiel said, “But I will.” He dug his teeth into his lower lip. “You never asked, and I…I should have said, but, I’m not gay.”
But is Dean Castiel’s patient? He has never cared for him professionally. He was very careful to try and maintain some boundaries. He has no idea of Dean’s past medical or surgical history. He does have a very good idea of what medications he is currently on—
That brought him to the other thing. Simple body mechanics got Dean with his legs out of the car. But Dean was a big guy, taller than himself. How in the hell had he deadlifted him out of his car? Castiel took a step back, looking at the tire tracks from his Ford Escape. He could even see his own footprints in the dried mud.
“Ready, Dean? I’m gonna help you up, and it’s really gonna suck. You can hold on to me,” he added hopefully.
Then Sam had looked up and saw Bobby and looked simultaneously scared and relieved. “You okay there, boy?” he’d gruffly asked, and Sam’s face had just…crumpled. And Bobby found himself suddenly glomped in a rib-cracking hug. So Bobby, not knowing what to do, figured he’d do the opposite of what John Winchester would do, and wrapped his burly arms around the scrawny kid and hugged him back just as tight. The more Sam’s shoulders shook, the harder he hugged.
“Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize it was so much better to attack someone from behind than defend yourself from an attack,” Gangly said. “Or maybe you didn’t notice the way they’ve been teaming up on me for the last week. What IS the bullying policy at this school coach, because I think you’re gonna need to go to a refresher course.”
“Yeah, Cas, something like this.” And he leaned forward, brushing their lips together. Castiel melted into him, opening beneath him, and welcoming Dean’s tongue with his own. “My heart can’t take anymore death-bed confessions, Cas. I have never been so happy but so pissed at the same time.”
the guy whose house I crashed into. His shed at least.” He tilted his head back as far as it would go between the IV in his neck and the world’s most uncomfortable chair.
He had the next episode of Stranger Things cued up and ready and the food on the coffee table when Cas got home.
he thought. He scooted over on the couch and with some careful maneuvering got his leg up on the cushions. He sighed in relief. His leg started swelling when he got out of bed in the morning, and the more swollen it got, the more uncomfortable it was. Keeping his right arm folded on his chest—the hated sling was draped over the arm of the couch—he relaxed against the cushions and closed his eyes. He could hear Cas doing stuff in the kitchen- doing what? No idea. But it made enough noise that was comfortably familiar and before he knew it, he slipped into sleep.
Compartmentalization was a useful skill, Castiel thought as he methodically wiped stool from a patient’s skin. He chucked the used wipes into the bin behind him, then slathered a generous portion of zinc ointment all along the patient’s backside and sacrum. He rolled up the soiled sheets and stuffed them under the patient, then expertly rolled up and tucked the clean sheets and pad under the soiled linen, making sure to straighten the wrinkles out as he went.
They hung up shortly after that, and Dean tried to make himself comfortable. He was lying in bed, as fully dressed as he could be in a button up shirt with the right sleeve partially cut away and the right leg of his jeans cut off below the knee to fit his immobilizer. Truthfully, wearing clothes in the ICU was a pain in the ass for both Dean and the nursing staff, but he needed something to be at least a little normal. He’d been in the hospital for three weeks at this point, almost four.
“You’re back, awesome, how was dinner?” Sam asked him, handing over the cranky looking baby. Jack was sucking his thumb, glaring at his father with a distinct pout on his face.
Dean rolled his eyes and pulled out his phone, glaring at it and silencing it. “Always a cockblock, Sammy,” he muttered. To Cas, he said, “I’m sorry, I have to go. Jack’s having a meltdown, and Sam and Jess have an emergency Zoom meeting for work.
Sam raised his eyebrows. “Okay, so when did you stop understanding English, because that sounded pretty clear.”
Dean’s long strides ate up the corridors between his algebra class and the main office. After waiting what he thought was a completely reasonable amount of time, he’d informed his teacher there was a family emergency and he had to leave immediately. He ignored the knowing looks and smirks from the other students as he left. It had not escaped Dean that he was not the only one with his phone out under his desk during class.
. That was…that was definitely not something you say to your platonic friend. Hannah kept telling him he was crazy that Dean was totally into him or as she put it “He LIKE likes you, doofus.”
Idly he watched a dark haired dude climb out of the car and trudge to his front porch. Dean nearly knocked his glass off the rail when the guy dropped his shit on the porch. What the hell?  Dean leaned forward. Nope, he was not actually hallucinating, there was a hot guy getting naked on the front porch next door. Dean carefully shifted his rocker so he had a better view.
Dean couldn’t help but stare. This was Novak, the dirty and bedraggled teen he’d befriended at school. But he looked entirely different! For one thing, he looked so happy his bright blue eyes were practically glowing. And his smile stretched wide, crinkling his nose and giving him dimples that were frankly adorable.  He was dressed in tall black boots, tight tan pants, and a dark blue winter coat that somehow made his eyes even bluer. His black hair fluffed back and forth in the wind, and his cheeks were bright pink from the cold.
Inside a young man sat sprawled in a chair.  His black hair was sticking up. A magenta bruise surrounded a nasty scrape on his chin.  He held an ice pack up to his right cheekbone.  The young man was still wearing his gym clothes: a bright red tank top and black sweats. Thick cords of muscle stood out clearly in his forearms, and his biceps flexed as he pressed the ice close.
, “It just looks bad, you know, with the bullying that was allowed to go on for days, I mean what would the ACLU say?”
“Hey,” Dean said. “I’m only next door, and you have my number. This?” He gestured back and forth. “This isn’t over, this is just beginning.”
Castiel arched an eyebrow at him. Dean buckled his seat belt. Sam nodded at him, closed the door for him and tapped the roof twice before turning on his heel to go find his own car.
“Look, in the interest of saving time let’s cut to the chase. One would expect you to stay with your brother. What makes me a better option than him?” Castiel really can’t believe he just said those words. He wondered if he was coming over as much more confident than he actually is.
They settle on their sides with Dean’s back to the sofa and Castiel facing him, the cozy aphgan draped over them. The sun sets and twilight deepens the room. They lay tangled together just feeling each other, getting used to each other.
Sam looked furious, but the anger faded as his eyes tripped between Dean and Castiel-through-the-window. Impossibly, Cas waved at him. “Dean, what the hell is going on, you’re out here screaming like a crazy person.”
Together they cleaned up from dinner. Washing and drying companionably. Regrettably, the evening flew by as they talked and before Cas knew it, it was eight pm and Dean was getting ready to leave.
Dean straightened to his full height. “Yeah. Yeah, I am,” he said, aware he sounded defensive. “Dean Winchester.”
He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. It didn’t help the cement block in his stomach, or the feeling that his life was about to fall apart. He tried another few deep breaths but it only made him lightheaded and tingly. Okay, so new plan. Better find somewhere to turn around and head back to civilization.
Please tell me what you think in the comments, especially if you have questions or think something doesn't make sense. If you like how I'm doing, please click the kudos bar and write me a note maybe?
After Dean left, Castiel pulled out his phone and added Dean into his contacts. Then he texted Gabriel.
Another message popped up, an image this time. He clicked on it. Then he squinted, looking closer. That looked like…
Beefcake said nothing, but rubbed the side of his face on the stall door.  “Stop that, you dope, before you hurt yourself,” Castiel told him, poking the horse’s chest with his index finger.  Beefcake looked offended, but stepped back as requested. “See you tomorrow big guy,” he said.  “Don’t do anything stupid, either.”
“He seemed very knowledgeable about what happened. How is he so sure about your car? Did he talk to the guy whose house you crashed into?”
“I know, Bud. This really sucks. But we gotta get you out of this car and to a hospital so you can get better. And Dean, I’m sorry to tell you, that is really gonna suck for you.”
Dean licked his lips. “Cas, please.” He patted the bed and held out his left hand, wiggling his fingers in a come here movement. When Cas got close enough, Dean pressed his lips against Castiel’s stomach, pressing damp kisses everywhere he could reach. With his right hand on Castiel’s hip, Dean tilted his head back to look at his lover. “You are so fucking beautiful.”
“No, see Cassie, you really aren’t. You’re SUPPOSED to be studying, and doing homework and going out with your friends—”
Sam huffed and got out. “Maybe that’s part of your problem, Dean. You WON’T ask.” He shook his shaggy hair out of his eyes, flung his backpack over a shoulder and flounced off.
“Whatever it is, it sucks, dude. So they gather a fuckton of equipment and I’m just sitting on the bed with my leg propped like why does it take four people for me to get ready to roll outside for five minutes—”
A pink flush made Cas look even cuter than normal. He arranged them on the couch so that Dean was laying back against Castiel’s chest, with his bad leg on a cushion (of course) and Castiel’s legs outside of his. The computer balanced on Dean’s lap as the show started. Castiel reached for Dean’s hand, threading their fingers together.
Castiel closed his eyes. The old man’s wife had an unprovoked PE, which was often a sign of undetected cancer. He suppressed a sigh and glanced over to the old man, who had his lips pressed together as his hands clutched the bible, turning his knuckles white.
God, he missed jumping. He missed the excitement of cross-country and the sensation of flying as he sailed over three foot jumps, as Beefcake tossed his head and fought to go faster. Castiel couldn’t help it—he just felt so…so earthbound and trapped in the winter.
“NO CAS,” Dean shouted. “That doesn’t count! That doesn’t count because I still wanted you to stay, but Sammy woulda died!” He swallowed. “I never ever wanted to make you go. I promise.”
“Can’t,” he said, struggling to open his eyes. Why did they keep closing? Why was he so fucking cold?
Biology was terrible. English was awful. Algebra and history and gym were miserable to begin with. By the end of the day, he wanted to throw Castiel’s empty chair right through the windows in the Spanish classroom.
He unlocked his phone and shot off a text asking Cas if he had any food preferences for tonight. He didn’t sit around waiting for a reply though. Cas had explained (again in FAR too much detail) that he was often tied up in patient rooms and he was not ignoring him, he really couldn’t answer.
“Hey man, I’m okay, I mean as okay as I can be with this situation, but like, I need a favor, and I know I have no right to ask you for anything because I mean, you’ve already saved my life—”
Dean could see that Sam was gearing up to address the elephant in the room. “No, Sam, we’re not talking about it. That is off limits.”
What if this was a deal breaker for Dean? What if he felt like Castiel had lied to him by not bringing up any of this stuff? What if Dean ended up going back to Kansas where his family was, and this was the beginning of the end?
Dark Hair peeled off his shirt. He swayed a little, and held on to his railing as he proceeded to wiggle out of his pants. Now just standing in his boxers, Dark Hair stuffed his clothes into a plastic bag, and went into the house.
The best times, though, were when Dean came over after dinner on Castiel’s nights off. They’d sit on the couch watching netflix, just talking for hours. On those nights, though they started off a reasonable distance apart, they always finished practically sitting in each other’s laps. Last time that happened Castiel had fallen asleep with gentle fingers carding through his hair and a warm hand on his shoulder.
“You want to come down to the ED, you let me know.” Gabe gave the barista his order and stepped over to wait with Castiel. “You did a good job, you know. In case nobody told you that.”
going to be okay with anal sex, because the whole idea was disgusting and dirty, and…Okay, take some deep breaths, he told himself. His hands tingled alarmingly and that usually meant that he was hyperventilating.
Dean tried to snort, but grimaced. “Your…bedside…manner…is…awful.” He said, clearly gritting out each word. He mumbled something then tried again. “ S y’name.” His respirations were getting more and more labored with each attempt at speech.
It was still difficult to look in the mirror and not expect the reflection that looked back at you. Dean was still down over twenty pounds. He had a giant Frankenstein scar diagonally across his forehead. Hell, he had healing incisions on his stomach, and between his ribs. He was used to seeing this face in magazines, and a couple of billboards and it was like he was a whole different person.
Bobby set his coffee mug down hard. “Now you listen up, and listen good. You been keepin that boy safe his whole life, and that’s a fact. But he ain’t made of glass, and he ain’t wrapped in bubbles. Life. Hurts. And anyone who says different—”
After pulling into their driveway, and steadying Castiel up the stairs to his bedroom, Gabriel made sure little bro’s phone was plugged in and at hand. Not before unlocking it and scrolling through the contacts, and sending himself one contact in particular. Castiel discovered that he got dizzy when he bent forward to remove his sneakers and Gabe yanked them off for him, before swinging his legs up into the bed.
Castiel Novak had been living his life on autopilot since March. As an ICU nurse he was supposed to work just three nights a week. The pandemic started off slow in Kansas but now raged through the sleepy communities. He and all the other nurses he knew were constantly harassed about picking up overtime shifts, and the pressure just got worse after several physicians and nurses died from coronavirus. Cas himself had done chest compressions on Dr Adler before he died. Adler was a real dick, Cas thought privately, but he never would have wished this kind of death on him. Not on anyone.
After the dishes were done and Sam and Jess putting Jack to bed, Dean slipped into his leather jacket and walked next door. The living room light was on and Dean sawCas sitting there on the couch. He tapped on the window, and called “Hey man, you okay? You want some company?”
, is the first thing he thinks, before he’s even really woken up. Castiel knows that scent even though he’s never smelled it before. Top notes of leather and dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. He hears himself growling, something he
Shaking his head, Dean said, “Hey man I didn’t know there was going to be a quiz.” He finished his crust and thought about it. “Nor…noratrip….” He looked at Cas.
Castiel couldn’t help pacing through the house while his phone went nuts with notifications. Between Hannah and Dean they scrolled in almost faster than he can read them. He did some deep breaths and then called.
They had settle back against the back of the couch, still wrapped up in each other, but without that awful tension. “Hmm?” Cas asked. He had Dean’s hand wrapped in his, clasped over his heart.
Before too long the burgers were cooking in the pan and Gabe started slicing potatoes to fry up. In the background he listened to Castiel tell Dean about things that he’d like about horses if he only gave them a chance.
November 5 dawned with no clear winner of the race, though both men are quite hopeful. Castiel picks up a shift that night. Halfway through, the ICU received a patient crashing from the acute care ward with a massive heart attack. Earlier the patient had come into the ED complaining of chest pain. He seemed to get better with nitro tablets and a heparin drip, and  was sent to the ICU with plans for a cardiac cath in the morning.
He poked his head in through the barn entryway, which was big enough to drive a truck through. “Cas?” he called out. Dean kicked some gravel with his boot heel. “Cas, you around?” No answer.  He backed out of the barn and then noticed a smaller row of horse stalls to his left. He headed that direction, and now that he was closer he heard a man inside one of the stalls talking.
“I know, buddy, you must be in a lot of pain. You’ve been through a lot. But first, can you squeeze my hand?” He put two fingers into Deans palm and the other man squeezed. Hard. “That was awesome,” Castiel smiled. “Let’s do the other side…Good! Now let me see you wiggle your toes.” The left toes moved briskly, the right ones weakly. “Dean, that was great. I need to have your nurse come look at you, ok, and I need you to keep your hands down by the bed, can you do that for me?”
This whole conversation is ridiculous, Cas thinks, and takes a long swallow of his blue drink. “I think,” he says firmly, “That if I found
“Yes, I know,” Castiel said, feeling numb. “Thanks for the update, Dr Williams, I appreciate it.” He felt overwhelmed and he had understood everything the doctor had said. How much worse was this for families and friends with no medical background?
Epinephrine is a great drug. It is used for anapylactic reactions, cardiogenic shock and in special circumstances, to increase the heart rate.
“Dean, hello,” Cas greeted him with a shy smile. “I’m glad you came by.”  He nodded his head at the horse next to him. “This is—well, she doesn’t exactly have a name yet. I’ve been calling her Beauty.”
Castiel’s phone buzzes. He taps the screen for the directions app, and starts the Continental. He leans over and opens the glove box, grabbing the comb he keeps in there.He runs it through his hair, trying to get it to behave. This is absolutely the dumbest thing he’s done in a long time. He and Jimmy are so different he hasn’t tried swapping since they were in high school.
February in Sioux Falls was pretty damn cold and so the gym teachers weren’t exactly volunteering to lead outdoor sports.
Mechanically, he poured the hot water into his waiting mug. Darjeeling. He added some honey. He always did his best thinking with a cup of tea.
Eyes closed, he drew one finger up and down his shaft, then stroking carefully around the head of his penis. Slowly, he rubbed back and forth over the sensitive head, sliding over his slit and then under the head. He brought his left hand down and squeezed his testicles, feeling the pleasant ache start.
The rest of the day wasn’t too bad, Dean decided.  Novak was in two other classes with him: English and Spanish.  In both classes when Dean arrived there was a gap of empty chairs on either side of Novak in the back row, so he sat next to him in both classes.
Eventually though, he did. Oh my god, he thought as he realized his face was covered in snot. He pushed back, wiping his face. “Don’t, don’t look at me,” he said frantically. “I’m so disgusting.”
Once Dean’s butt was perched on the edge of the passenger seat, Cas braced himself and then scooted Deans butt back. The injured man was basically crumpling at this point. He lifted Deans’ legs in the car, trying to be careful of his right leg. He leaned the seat back and pulled the seatbelt on over him. He tried dialing 911 but the call wouldn’t connect. He hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d told Dean this was a bad area for cell service.
(…tube in your throat to keep your breathing while you go to the OR. Your liver is bleeding and they need to fix it. You’re gonna be okay Dean. Just keep breathing.)
And Dean held on, like Castiel was the only thing keeping him grounded. Sometimes he wondered if Dean was having nightmares as they slowly lightened the sedation. He was actually kind of worried about the plan for steroids because a lot of times they made ICU patients crazy with a capital C.
Castiel considered that as he walked with Joe toward the ICU. The night staff was mostly pretty young and pretty new. Lots of good kids, but also plenty of clueless new grads fresh off orientation. Mistakes happen, everyone makes them and nurses are only human. Still. He had talked to the guy. He wanted to do right by him. It had been Jesus—how many hours now? Surely someone had missed their husband or family member? Castiel was a firm believer that every patient needs an advocate at the bedside especially if they are not able to protect their own safety. “I’ll probably do that, Joe,” he said eventually, as Joe badged them into the unit.
“You don’t understand because you have no frame of reference. To ride a horse…it’s freedom. It’s the next best thing to flying. I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s work, it’s so much work…but the first time you gallop across a field, or canter over a fence…”
Dean couldn’t sleep. All day he’d been dying for a nap and now that it was quiet and the lights were dimmed he was just…lying here listening to the distant beep of monitors from the nursing station. Apparently, they did something at night, turned the beeping off in the patient rooms or something (how in the world did he know this?) to try and help patients sleep more. Well, he wished it worked a little better, he thought grumpily.
your angel.” He kept his eyes fixed on Dean’s. “Does that make you my human?” he asked, with a gentle smile.
With the slightest amount of pressure he urged Castiel closer. Dean kissed his cheek before nuzzling into his neck, rubbing his own cheek against Castiel’s. He felt Castiel’s arms come around his shoulders carefully. Castiel scratched his nails against the back of Dean’s neck, startling an appreciative hum from him.
He passed the last fence, which separated the boys from the girls, and made his way up the hill. Annoyingly, his little mare liked to hang out at the top of the hill, and while she no longer led him a merry chase all over the pasture, neither did she bother to actually come nearer. Castiel had to stop halfway up the steep hill to catch his breath, the cold air making his lungs hurt.  “No, no,” he muttered, “I’ll just come up there. Jesus.”
During the day, Gabriel checked all the fences, and looked over all the horses at the farm.  He normally had a few students who continued to ride during the winter, as they had an indoor arena, and gave a lesson or two before picking Castiel up from school and heading back to the farm.
Castiel steps through into the front hallway and lingers while Dean shuts the door. Once again they seemed to be locked in a staring contest. He lickes his lips and says, “Dean. That phone call. I wish it never happened. You didn’t deserve that.”
Dean had moved up from the wheelchair to a scooter thing that he could rest his right knee on and wheel around on one leg. He kissed Cas on the cheek, and rolled into the kitchen.
Castiel ascends the stairs and looks at the door. Is he really doing this? He thinks of Jimmy telling this man how ordinary he is, how boring, thinks of Jimmy already planning on seeing another man tonight, and his resolve hardens. He rings the bell.
Novak twisted round in his chair, giving Dean a long look. His eyes were surprisingly blue. Like, crazy blue.  The moment stretched out to the point where Dean was starting to wonder if he’d actually imagined talking to him.
He’d been so skinny! Castiel remembered his horror when the chestnut gelding had unloaded off the trailer that first time.  All his ribs visible, the bones of his withers and hips jutting out sharply where there should be sleek curves. His coat had been patchy and dull, with whole chunks of hair missing.
Castiel realized that everyone was leaving for first period. He stuffed his phone in his hoodie pocket, feeling it vibrating furiously. God. He should have been an only child. He really should have.  His legs protested getting up from the chair.  Gabriel had made him trot his little mare for about thirty minutes before horrifying Castiel with the comment, “Now drop your stirrups and start posting! Let’s see some figure eights and serpentines!”
“Oh, that wasn’t on purpose,” Dean said. “It was just supposed to put me in the state of mind to tell the truth. Um. I, uh, kinda having been trying to have this talk with you for, um. Awhile.”
“Ha!” Castiel cried into the wind. “Nice try, but you’ll have to work a lot harder to get me off bareback.” He tightened his thighs and stretched his calves down and around her belly, his fingers tangling in her thick mane.  His hips moved in time with her body, and to an outside observer, the whole process would have looked entirely effortless. In reality, Castiel was expending quite a bit of effort not to get left behind. He couldn’t afford to be unbalanced, not with the herd of mares excited and following them back to the barn. He used his seat to slow the fiery mare down and his legs to turn her away from the fence and over the bridge. At the bottom of the hill, he whooped in exhilaration, and kicked her ahead faster.  The mare flew up the hill, muscles bunching and releasing as she ran. Wind whipped tears from his eyes, and Castiel was filled with a ferocious joy.
And his nurse? Every time he turned around she was taking his temperature, or making him cough (ow.) or asking him about his pain level. “Call me if you need anything!” Ugh. He didn’t know Cas very well but his voice was so much better than anyone else’s. At least he had graduated from one ice chip at a time to small sips of ice water with supervision. Did they really think he was going to choke on ice water? Jesus. And it was only…One pm? Was it still Sunday?
Solomon started striking out with his front leg and Michael glared at the gelding and smacked his chest. “Quit that, dumbass. You know better.” He texted:
Castiel has lost the ability to word. His eyes are closed, and he feels Dean’s breath against his neck. At some point he must have raised his hands because they are pressed against Dean’s extremely firm, extremely bare chest. Cas presses forward with his hips, and he feels the answering squeeze of Deans fingers against his sides. They’re standing so close, everything Castiel has wanted for so long, and it’s so close...
Castiel was never blessed with the ability to make friends like Jimmy could. Cas was picky about people he opened up to while Jimmy never opened up about anything significant, not really. Cas never liked messing around with his hair, or wearing stylish clothes. He didn’t date very much in part because Jimmy seemed to take it as a personal challenge to steal whoever Cas was dating at the time, if only to prove that he could. So Castiel learned not to bother.
They moved into a series of leg yields in both directions before picking up the canter along the track. Michael kept his head and eyes up, using his body to direct the horse. He lived for these moments, when everything fell away, and he became one with the animal, both moving in perfect harmony.
Boundary issues for nurses are tricky. It is absolutely NOT OKAY to be involved with a patient under your care. Castiel is a damn good nurse which is why he is super concerned about it. I am not an expert on ethical issues in the medical field but I did want to touch on it here.
Their wedding takes place at the family church. He tries not to pull at his bow tie, but church always makes him feel anxious and out of place. He believes in God, just not in religion. At the reception there is no cake smashing, or garter belt throwing. Just tasteful toasts and aged champagne. It's a cash bar. Castiel spends most of the evening talking to one of Jimmy’s friends, a tall lawyer with entirely ridiculous hair. His scent is pleasant, and Castiel likes it okay, except he feels like it's missing something. He gets pleasantly tipsy with Jimmy’s friend and listens to a bunch of tales about a girlfriend and older brother that he will never meet.
“Yeah, but I’m glad you are,” Dean tells him. “Thought I was crazy talking to you on the phone this afternoon, it was just so easy. Nothing was ever easy with him.  He made me feel like I was always asking too much, I’ve done the bar scene, I’m over it, I want something real you know?”
“I’m gonna pull my car right up here so we just have to get you in and then I’ll take you to the hospital, okay?”
“That’s a yes!” She tackle hugged him, poked him in the ribs and started walking off. “I can’t remember what I came down here for,” she announced. “Ugh. I’ll just go wander around the supply room for five minutes.”
Castiel turned, one hand still on Dean’s bedrail. “Hi Suzanne.” The young redheaded night nurse was taking care of Dean tonight.
Castiel pursed his lips. “I’m not your nurse so I have to find out. You might get a couple ice chips first before we give you water though, since your throat is probably pretty swollen.”
It was a relief to escape the school into the bright winter day.  Dean threaded his way through the student parking lot, when he spotted his brother standing around gawking.
“I’m fine for now,” he said, his eyes fixed on Dean’s face. “I need you guys to stay safe though. And that means staying away from me. Go home and get warm Dean, you can facetime with me later when we’re not so-” he gestured to his face.
It left him with a lot of time to think. Especially about stuff he normally avoided like the plague. Stuff like his empty house back in Kansas or the fact that he actually hated performing in front of huge stadium crowds. Some people got off on that kind of thing but Dean much preferred singing small gigs. Things he never got to do anymore.
“Okay,” Dean said, tapping his fingers on the sheets. “Let’s break this down. Tell me what you think of when you say ‘boundary issues.’ Like legit-first thing that comes to mind.”
mate, I wouldn't care how old he was.” He turns on his stool, so he is facing Dean. “I would move Heaven, Hell and Purgatory to be with him.”
Sometimes in the morning after Castiel got home, Dean would facetime with Jack on his lap, cheerfully bouncing the baby so much that Jack laughed until he hiccuped. Other mornings, he found Dean and Jack sitting on the front porch all bundled up reading books. Castiel did his quick strip routine at his front door, shower and then visited for a few minutes, before he got too tired.
“That’s good Dean, really. Because it really is so normal for people to get overwhelmed in this environment.” He rested one hand on Dean’s bed. “It’s like, you take a normal person, you give them a life-threatening condition or illness and completely mess up their sleep schedule while giving them a bunch of new meds. And this—” He gestured around at the room. ‘It’s a completely abnormal environment. So your reaction-being overwhelmed,” he smiled gently, “is very, very, normal.
Suzanne’s eyes widened, and her ponytail bobbed as she spoke. “Oooh, well homeboy woke up a couple hours ago
Gabriel scoffed and ignored all of those, opting to quickly towel dry his hair. He picked up his boots, stuffed the foam boot shapers in them, and then zipped them up.  He dug through his laundry basket with clean unfolded clothes for jeans and a sweatshirt.
“You’re not making a good case for me letting you go,” Castiel said into Dean’s neck. Dean didn’t move.
The roads were smooth, but once they got off the highway, very narrow and twisty. “Ugh,” Dean said. “I think I’ve been lost here before.”
Castiel told him, “Today is November 13, and you were in a car accident a few days ago. I found you and got you out of your car and brought you to the hospital.”
Worse was that Dean wasn’t sure if he should text Cas or not. He was probably asleep, or not feeling up to dealing with people today. Dean didn’t want to make any trouble for him. Hell, maybe Cas didn’t even want to talk to him! He’d gotten all beat up trying to protect Dean’s brother after all.
Gabe whistled. He rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet, hands deep in the pockets of his white coat. “Heard he had a nasty case of the VAP. Vanc and zosyn fix him up good? Did he end up needing a fasciotomy? I was a little worried about that leg for a while there.”
He felt his phone buzz in his pocket but he ignored it. He just didn’t have time right now. Castiel really just wanted a giant glass of water, a hamburger and to pee. Not necessarily in that order.
A few minutes later Castiel returned with a young woman. “Dean this is Hannah. She’s your nurse for the day shift.”
“I am?” Cas asked. Now this was startling. He’d thought sometimes that he was hanging on too close to the Winchesters in general, but Dean in particular. He always wanted to be useful, to be needed. And sometimes, he just left because he didn’t want Dean to tell him to go. If Cas left of his own volition, that was different from Dean making him leave. So Cas had been trying to make sure he gave Dean enough space.
Dean crumpled the t-shirt he was supposed to be folding into a little ball. “Yeah well, maybe he was just being
“Hey Dean,” A familiar voice said. Sam was here. The big moose stared at him forever before he came closer probably angling for a hug. “I am so glad you’re okay! You scared me to death you jerk!”
Novak made a face halfway between a smile and wince. “Yeah that. I had some trouble with one of the girls at work this morning.” He stood up and stretched, grunting a little when he raised his arms over his head.
Castiel had the regular chair pulled up next to Dean’s left side. It was getting to be time to go home for the day. After the third or so middle of the night call, Castiel had thrown in the towel and admitted to himself that he was all in for this. He purposefully stayed with Dean overnight now, and it was definitely working out better for everyone.
He remembered how her vitals had dropped. He gave her fluid. He turned up her drips. It didn’t help. He remembered the surgeon that opened her chest at the bedside. The smell of burning flesh from the laser scalpel. He remembered the spray of blood across the room as her vena cava crumbled. He remembered the drop of blood on Dr Adler’s glasses. He remembered putting down towels on the floor because he was afraid the surgeons would slip. There was so much blood. It oozed across the floor. The ECMO machine. Climbing over people to hand equipment. Giving unit after unit of blood, and it all just kept pouring out. PEA arresting. Internal paddles. Cardiac massage. More blood. More blood. Dr Adler in the hallway talking to the family.
During the next hour, Castiel zoned out, exhausted. He started to notice that his back was really hurting. He would kill for some ibuprofen. He watched as a group of people straggled in, many of them looking shell-shocked and worn out. A couple of teenagers sat sullenly in the two corner chairs under the TV, busy on their phones. An elderly African American man sat next to Castiel. He had his eyes closed and his cap clenched in one hand and a Bible in the other.
“What do you mean, you’re not sure if you’re invited,” Sam Winchester said. He was parked on Dean’s bed watching his brother fold (and re-fold) but he wasn’t going to tell him that.
Finally he hears Jimmy lose his patience and end the call. Jimmy starts a playlist and runs the shower. Cas hears the clink-slide of the shower curtain rings and the splash of water in the tub. Cas has a really stupid idea. A really really bad idea, in fact.
Castiel felt awful. He was tired, he was sore. He wasn’t allowed to go to the farm this morning with Gabriel, and just had to lie here and do nothing while Gabriel was off doing work that Castiel was supposed to be doing!  Gabriel told him to binge watch something on Netflix. Well, he didn’t
Dean looks vaguely surprised. “You...You’re sorry?” He laughs a little, looking down. “You never apologize.”
Then the physical therapist --who was an aggressively cheerful woman—dragged him out of bed and made him sit in the most uncomfortable chair on the planet.
He leaned over and rested his head on Castiel’s shoulder, keeping his left arm around his lover’s waist, not pulling him closer, but holding him where he is. As much as Dean would love to try and fix this now, he knew instinctively that was a bad idea. Cas sometimes needed time to let things settle so he could think about them. Oh, that gave him an idea…
That thought was utterly unbearable and Castiel covered his mouth to quiet the sobs that were imminent. He swiped the wetness on his cheeks away, and tried to get it together. Oh, no. He knew this feeling. This was the feeling he got when something triggered the shit out of him. All of the feelings of inadequacy he stuffed down into a little box came out to play.
Dean passed one or two side streets that looked like they didn’t go anywhere before deciding on the next right. However, once he turned onto--what was it? --Plank Road, he found that the road fell away sharply on either side. Also, it was narrow as fuck and there was no way he was turning around here. “Fucking Virginia,” he muttered. Fine then. He’d just keep driving. Eventually he would A-get some cell service, or B- run into a highway.
Somehow Dean thought that was a gross oversimplification. He had very vague memories of being very cold.
Gabriel and Michael texted him frequently throughout the day. Castiel couldn’t help obsessively checking his phone for the message that never came. He wasn’t disappointed. It’s not like he and Dean were super tight, anyway. He’d just exchanged numbers with him yesterday. Besides, without Castiel there Dean might actually be talking to other people and making other friends.
Castiel drew back just enough so he could see Dean’s face. Locked into staring again, he traced Dean’s lower lip with a gentle thumb, his fingers cradling the other man’s cheek. He forced himself to take a step back. “You have to go now if you’re going home, Dean. In another minute I will lose what little sense I have left, and just drag you to my bed.”
“Dude, I’m so sorry!” Dean felt his face burning. Great. He’d nearly killed Cas’s brother. “Are you okay?”
“It’s okay, Bud. Just keep breathing.” Strong arms lifted him out of the wrecked car, and Dean screamed.
“…care what his last name is….the same for anyone…the last thing I want…forward to meeting you in person.”
“Gabriel said he was gonna give you a riding lesson? I don’t know man, you looked really good out there,” Dean clapped his hands on his crossed arms, trying to keep warm. He really should have worn gloves.
He glanced back to the road just in time to plow into a deer. Time slowed way down and Dean found himself with plenty of time to think,
Dean snuggled him close. “I was just next door talking to the man that lives there. His name is Cas.”
‘Novak’. Dean has classes with you.” Winchester eyed him a little more carefully now.  “I’m Sam, by the way.”
Dean turned him around. “Yes, you can,” he said winningly. He brought his hands up to frame Castiel’s face. “You’re out of quarantine.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Only the ones I really like.” He tried to fight it, but the grin broke out on his face anyway.
Castiel snorts inelegantly. “We’re not...close.” He steals a glance up at Dean and sees the wry twist of his lips.
. Dean took two steps back. “Sorry, man,” he said. He couldn’t help looking back through the window to see Cas standing up and swaying.
He felt a touch at his chin and looked up into Dean’s startling green eyes. Eyes that were red rimmed and glassy, tear tracks clear on his face. “No, you’re not,” Dean said. “You’re just human.” He smiled wanly. “That offer for dinner still open?” He winked. “I feel like I’m in your bubble now.”
“Also…” Sam hesitated. “Is this like a…like a date?” He almost wanted to cringe, because as far as he knew Dean had only ever gone out with girls, but he was just so…weird about Castiel.
Eventually, Castiel slowed down his kisses, pulling back a little. “Dean,” he said, sounding wrecked. “I have an idea about our netflixing tonight?”
Dean patted the left side of the bed “C’mere. You desperately need a one-armed hug.” He held his arm out, waiting.
He climbed the stairs with quiet footfalls. Castiel’s bedroom was just to the left of the landing. Gabriel poked his head in. Seeing Castiel was asleep, Gabe left the cup of water and two pills on his nightstand.  He watched his brother sleeping for a few minutes, thinking of younger years after Cassie had fallen off Quicksilver, the little Welch pony. He must have come off that pony twenty times before he finally got the hang of holding the reins and not getting yanked forward over the horse’s head.  Gabriel remembered a shy little boy with dark messy hair and big blue eyes who was all skinned knees and elbows. He remembered how Cassie always cried when he fell off his pony; sometimes tears of anger, sometimes frustration and sometimes pain. He always did
Wiping his mouth with napkin Dean told him, “Nah. Both my parents have passed. Sam and I usually get together for Christmas though. Mostly I stay home on New Year’s.”
“I’m really tired,” Dean started, and to his horror, his eyes filled up with tears. He covered his face with his good hand and tried to turn away.
Dean waited, but Novak continued packing his things away, before pushing back from the desk and getting up. “What’s, uh, what’s your name?” Dean blurted. So smooth Dean.
“I asked Sammy to invite you to his wedding,” Dean confesses. “I couldn’t figure out any other pretext to get to know you a little. Sam told me that you don’t date.”
“That-that’s not that much better,” Dean sputters. “Don’t you think people should be closer in age?”
Castiel sighs and double checks the directions. He looks at himself for a moment in the rearview mirror. Unfortunate hair, blue eyes too big for his face and an unnaturally full mouth. Somehow people always thought Jimmy was handsome. Surely Castiel wasn’t that much of a disappointment in comparison? Stock broker vs. Middle school teacher, Cas thinks. No comparison at all.
This must have struck Gabriel has funny, because the older man just grinned and said, “Wow, what a coincidence. Cassie was working like a dog this morning too. Cleaned all of his tack. Got most of it done too. I finally chased him out to get his horse.” He eyed Dean speculatively. “Gonna give him a riding lesson when he gets back up here. You’re welcome to watch.” Gabriel’s eyes danced. “I don’t think he’ll really mind. Matter of fact, he should be coming up from the back forty in a few minutes. If you go down that path—” Gabriel walked to the end of this row of stalls and pointed down a gravel walkway. “—and follow it till you get to the pasture with all the blue blankets on the fence, you’ll probably hear him coming.” He gave Dean a sly grin. “I’m gonna finish cleaning these few stalls—geldings, you know, super messy— and I’ll see you guys in a while.”
“Ah, okay,” Dean said, nodding, “That makes more sense. You must be killing yourself on the regular then.”
Dean’s head tilted to the side, and a slow hopeful smile spread on his lips. “Everything feels awful and wrong?”
Jimmy and Amelia are waiting to mate until after they say their vows. It's less old fashioned and more “new fashioned’, that is to say it’s way more common to bite first and then fill out the paperwork. They’ve been dating for nearly 18 months. Castiel gets to be the best man because Jimmy is his identical twin and younger brother by about 90 seconds.  Jimmy is a lawyer and works as a public defender. Amelia is a social worker. They met in a Police station while Amelia was arguing with the desk clerk about a client. Jimmy intervened before Amelia got arrested for assaulting a police officer, and they’ve been inseparable ever since.
The front of the hospital was mostly glass, and so the lobby was really, really bright. Dean squinted against the sun. Bright light still gave him a headache. He was the proud owner of this fold up wheelchair he was sitting in. Sam had accompanied him as he was discharged from the ICU. One of the transporter staff had wheeled him down here, but now he was just waiting for Castiel to pull his car around. Parking was a bitch here.
He remembered after getting the catheter out he’d accidentally pissed all over himself. Filled with shame, he’d asked the nurses for help. They’d cheerfully told him not to worry about anything, this was all normal, it happened to a lot of guys after catheter removal because things were swollen down there, and mostly that it would get better. It was humbling, he realized, to be an able-bodied man in the prime of his life and suddenly need help with the bathroom.
Okay fine. Dean took one for the team and said, “I, um, I should have asked before, you know, I um, it’s just that, I mean, that actually feels really good, I don’t know if you’ve tried that or not but, you know. It can be really…” Dean felt like a babbling idiot. “…good.”
She stopped at the top of the hill, past the run-in shed, just before the gate.  Castiel swung himself off, landing lightly on the balls of his feet. “Good girl!” He said, patting her neck, then scratching her behind her ears. “What a good beauty,” he crooned.  The mare shoved her head into his chest hard, and he staggered back a step, laughing.  Finally, he raised his head to find the gate latch and found himself face to face with Dean Winchester.
But Castiel just laughed. “No, we’re not allowed to take vacation for the time being. I just stopped working overtime for this week.”
“FERGUSON, CRUZ, GRAHAM and TODD to the Vice-principle’s office. Scrape up Rourke, there and take him to the nurse’s office on your way.” Coach Brown looked like he was having a worse day than Castiel and Gangly the way he was stomping and huffing. Castiel was overcome with the sudden urge to giggle uncontrollably and only the pain that came with any movement of his face stopped him.
“Uh-huh,” Castiel answered. “So I’m gonna get your legs and spin you on the seat, then we’re gonna stand and pivot into my car.”
Sitting here now, with hours to kill, watching various people come and go from the lounge in various stages of upset, he couldn’t help but second guess his actions at the accident scene. What if Dean had drug allergies? What if he was allergic to latex? Was he on a blood thinner? Did he have a history of major surgery like Tetralogy of Fallot repair? What if—
“It’s okay Bud.” Cas bent his knees and leaned forward at the waist, wrapping his arms around Dean’s middle “Just keep breathing,” he said, and lifted. He ignored the sound that came from Dean, he ignored the flames in his lower back, and he ignored the fact that there was No. Way. He could actually dead lift this guy into his SUV. He also ignored the fact that he somehow did it anyway.
I really am loving the interaction between the Novak brothers. So I tried to show some parallels here, the way Cas is cleaning because he's anxious and Dean likes to fold clothes when he's anxious. And of course, they each have a brother that's trying to talk sense/ keep them from climbing the walls.
Michael shifted his weight, slowing the horse down to a walk. He patted Solomon’s neck affectionately.  He owned a lot of horses, it was true, but this one was the most fun to ride.
Cas could sympathize. “Yeah, I can see that.” He did not lessen his firm pressure in the least. “I know it hurts like a bitch, but no joke man, you’ve lost a lot of blood and I don’t want you to lose anymore.” The guy had on a flannel over a t shirt and from what Cas saw they were soaked through with blood on the left side.
“Shit, man, I hope you don’t mind,” Dean said, taking the glass. “Thanks.” He tipped his head back, chugging the cold water eagerly.  “I’m Dean,” he said, extending a hand.
Sam and Jessica’s wedding is held at the local botanical garden which makes for an incredibly beautiful setting for photos, but is also incredibly HOT. Castiel is using his strongest blockers today; not just the spray for his pits and neck, but the 24 hour tablet that eradicates his scent and prevents slicking for the entire day. Unfortunately, those are for special occasions only because the side effects (hunger, mood swings) are deeply unpleasant.
Dean pushes back his chair abruptly, running a quick hand through his short hair. He’s...considering, Castiel thinks. Figuring out what to do next. Send me a sign if you figure it out, he thinks. Then, Dean holds out a hand. Slowly, Castiel takes it, lets himself be tugged to his feet. He steps forward and asks, “Can I hug you?”
Clearing his throat, Dean said, “Yeah, um.” What were they talking about again? Oh, right: gloves and Dean’s lack thereof. “That’s a, uh, good idea.”
He continued down the path, which meandered next to the gelding field. The boys were all clustered together under the grove of trees a little ways farther out. A few of them raised their heads to watch Castiel walking.  He ignored them, stuffing his glove-clad hands into his pockets. Deer skin gloves were pretty warm, but this wind whipping down from the hill was
“Oh, me? Castiel,” the man said as he jiggled the car door handle a couple times before prying it open with a grunt. He leaned over Dean and unsnapped the seatbelt.
“Sweetheart, there’s nothing ruined. I hated that lamp,” Dean said, deliberately making an innocent face. To his utter relief, he heard a low chuckle.
He redoubled his efforts, using one hand to squeeze Castiel’s ass. He started taking him deeper and deeper, and stroking him faster. He slid his hand around to cup his balls, gently squeezing them, while sliding a finger back—
Cas knocked the man’s hand away from his face where it tried to cup his good cheek. “Quit that, Gabriel.”
Gabriel snickered. “Well you kinda ARE getting beat up at home. It’s just your mare is doing all the beating. I keep telling you kiddo, that horse needs a martingale or at the very LEAST a neck stretcher, otherwise she’s gonna break your nose the way she throws her head around.”
Castiel’s commute home was about thirty minutes. The drive often helped him decompress from long twelve hour shifts spent trying to keep people alive.  He loved his job, he really did, but every so often, like now, he had to take an extended vacation. He’d been a nurse for ten years at the same hospital so he racked up a lot of vacation. Sometimes he cashed out the hours and sometimes he took five weeks off to recharge. And he really needed this time to recharge.
Gabriel grinned. “Just let me shower real quick and we’ll get dinner started. It’ll be great, promise.”
Time continued passing and Jack kept growing. Summer faded into Fall and the weather cooled off significantly. In that time, he’d only caught a few more glances of Dark Hair, all coming home from work around 9 in the morning. At least, Dean thought, the yard  next door looked better. After he’d realized the dude worked nights, Dean had started doing the mowing and stuff in the evenings. One night after dinner, he’d been sitting on the front porch with Jack in his lap reading a book when he saw Dark Hair leave his house looking like he just rolled out of bed. Wrinkled scrubs, hair a mess and a large coffee in hand.
hella pissed. Started chomping on his ET tube. Respiratory went to get a bite block, but he bit it clean in half, like what the fuck, man?” She glared at the unconscious man.
The nurse gave his order for coffee and stepped off to the side to wait. “Extubated finally, seems to be doing okay. They got his pulse back in the leg after a trip to angio, so they avoided the fasciotomy. They ended up switching to cefipime once the gram negatives in the BAL speciated out.”
Castiel laughed, the first time Dean could remember hearing it. “No, I guess we wouldn’t. Actually, you go on ahead, I’ll be up there in a few minutes. I need to finish this,” he gestured at his remaining food.
His fingers flexed on the steering wheel. He was pretty good and keeping work at work. But every so often, something just got to him. He had taken a fresh post op, a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement. Old lady. Someone who wouldn’t have survived the open chest/sternotomy of the regular procedure.
Dean’s eyes are glinting red, and his scent is thickening, deepening. He’s going into rut soon. “I came late to Gadreel’s wedding. I saw you there, but I couldn’t get up the nerve to talk to you. And, um, I might have thought you had a girlfriend for a while. Sam, my brother, set me straight after Jimmy and Amelia’s wedding. I was gonna make myself talk to you at Adam’s wedding but-”
Castiel prepared for a lecture. This reminded him of when he and Gabriel used to get into trouble and then having to listen to Michael bitch and moan. Again, he repressed the urge to grin.
The worst thing was his right leg. The bones at his ankle had both broken (tib-fib fracture) and there was so much swelling the doctors had nearly had to cut his calf open to relieve the pressure. They had opted to make a really small incision and put a drain in. The drain looked like a hand grenade and was currently stuffed into his sock for safekeeping. Once the swelling went down in about four weeks(!) he would have to have another surgery to fix it for real. He carefully did not move his leg from its assigned place on the footstool, with extra pillows. These nurses. Did not fuck around.
He thought about calling for the nurse but…the night nurse wasn’t as awesome as Hannah. Did he really want a stranger to come in to make him feel better? The sliding glass door to his room opened, and Dean wondered if all the nurses were psychic or just his. They all seemed to have a weird sixth sense about when he needed something, even if it was just to talk.
A sideways glance from blue eyes, before Castiel slowly leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes. “Dodge ball. They’ve been making Sam a target,” he said tiredly. “I didn’t have the opportunity to do anything about it until today.” He yawned. “We took out the entire opposing side.” The corner of Castiel’s mouth quirked upwards and Dean suddenly found himself noticing how full the other boy’s lips were. “Didn’t know he was your brother of course, didn’t know you had one.”
Dean slowly plugged the numbers in and handed the phone back. He licked his lips with a dry tongue. “Brother.” He swallowed, trying not to cough. “Sam.”
Ah, well. He adjusted his position on the couch. Marching orders from Castiel included keeping his leg elevated as much as possible, and trying to move around the house as little as possible. For some reason, Cas was under the impression that Dean was a fragile flower that would wilt if he moved his ass off the couch too much. Except he expressed it in terms of big blue eyes and fears of him falling.
Most weeks he worked four 12-hour shifts a week, but some weeks he did five or even six shifts. He came home from work and collapsed into bed after a dinner of cereal and a hot shower. As the case numbers increased, he started taking off his scrubs at the front door. He spent the rare days off curled up on the couch watching netflix, hiding from the world. He lived by himself. All of his friends were nurses, also working just as hard as did. Meg, Balthazar and Hannah used to meet up with him every couple weeks and have dinner, or go to a local bar and play trivia. Castiel was desperately lonely and couldn’t do a thing about it. He sometimes imagined what it would be like to come home to someone else. He sometimes heard the kid next door shriek-laughing, followed by a man’s deep hearty laugh. He tried not to be envious, he really did, but some nights it was just so hard.
He shook his head in mild disgust. Ugh. The thought alone was terrible. ‘Okay, kids,” he called, “Come on and eat!”
Castiel threw an arm over his eyes. “I’m not a kid anymore Gabe. I’m gonna be eighteen on my next birthday.”
Gabriel lingered in the doorway. “Okay, kiddo.” He scrubbed his empty hand back and forth through his hair, sticking it up in all directions. “Give me a name. Tell me ONE person you talked to today. Who is not a horse.”
.” And suddenly, Castiel realized he was not the only one who felt inadequate. “And you wouldn’t look at me, and you wouldn’t let me hug you—” This was horrible to listen to, Cas thought, like all his dark thoughts escaped and got to Dean.
“Yes, Dean,” Sam continued eventually. “I stopped by the stores yesterday and picked up some books I thought you might like, and a bunch of movies too.”
Castiel stopped at the hospital coffee shop before he headed home. He checked his phone idly and scrolled through his twitter feed while waiting. He almost never had time to watch the news or read the papers so most of his timeline was mystifying at best.
Castiel’s mouth worked but no words came out. He bent down and grabbed his pants, holding them in front of himself for a moment before stepping back into them. He seemed to realize that his actions were confusing the hell out of Dean, because Dean could see almost the exact moment he went from VacationCas! to WorkingCas!.
Trying to take all this information in, Castiel ran a hand over his face. “Okay. How is he doing now though?”
Still, Dean mused on the drive back to Bobby’s (it didn’t feel right to call it home, yet) he kept expecting Dad to show up unannounced and pull them both from school. He’d done it before, lots of times, like he’d done that time in upstate New York.
Walking in a circle, Dean adjusted Jack so he was belly down on his arm, pretending to fly around the room. “Dude, no. The guy is an ICU nurse, he’s working himself to death, he’s not allowed to take a vacation, and he told me he couldn’t remember the last time anyone hugged him. He wasn’t expecting anything, I just couldn’t stand there while I have two perfectly good arms, and yes for the record, functioning eyes, it’s not like it was a hardship, but he just…” Dean stopped and looked up at his brother.  “He’s all alone over there, man. You have Jess, and Jack and me, but, he can’t see his friends and I don’t think he has much family. Can you imagine not touching anyone for six months?” He stopped flying the baby and just rocked him back and forth, gently.
His whole body hurts. With every twitch, his thighs are protesting, and his abdominal muscles are so sore it hurts to take a deep breath. And he’s completely naked. He breathes in anyway, and scent explodes across his senses.
Dean  watched Jack grow from a chubby and happy 9 month old to a taller, leaner but equally happy 15 month old who toddled around and chattered constantly. He took the baby out for walks, keeping well away from people. He cooked elaborate meals for his family, and helped with the upkeep of the house. As the seemingly endless summer crept on, Dean took over more and more of the yard work duties as Sam had less and less time to deal with mowing, edging, sweeping and watering.
“Seriously, yes, it is NOT a big deal, Jesus.” Castiel shifted uncomfortably. “I have a few classes with him is all.” He rolled his eyes. “He even sat next to me! I think I’m in love,” he finished sarcastically.
He turns the doorknob, and on silent feet, pads over to Jimmy’s bed where his phone is tossed on the rumpled covers.  He picks up the iphone. It scans Castiel’s (Jimmy’s) face and unlocks. With one ear on the bathroom, Cas scrolls through Jimmy’s contacts and sends himself Dean’s contact info. He deletes the sent message and escapes. He goes out and sits in his car so he doesn’t get caught being an idiot.
fresh from the shower. His dark hair fluffed all over the place as it dried. Dean really wanted to run his fingers through it. He couldn’t help stealing a glance at Castiel’s lips, wondering how he tasted and if they were as soft as they looked…
He glared at the TV before looking at his bed longingly. The physical therapist had been very firm about staying out of bed for two hours. He wasn’t going to make it. After surviving a terrible car wreck, he was going to die of exhaustion right in the hospital. He shifted uncomfortably. The catheter was driving him crazy and he wanted it out. He wiggled his toes experimentally. He seemed to recall at one point someone was very happy that he could do that.
She had dark hair and blue eyes like Castiel. “Hi Dean. Cas tells me your throat is dry and you’re having some pain.” She smiled and shook a styrofoam cup at him. “I have some ice chips for you to try, and then I have your pain meds.” She winked at Castiel. “I’m about to become his favorite nurse.”
So Beefcake had in theory been Gabe’s horse, but Castiel was the one that worked with him every day. Castiel fed him, wormed him, groomed him, and eventually, he was the one who got on for that first ride.  He smiled fondly at the horse.  Beefcake snorted and moved closer, his whiskers tickling Castiel’s hands. He scratched the large head, paying special attention to around his ears, grinning when the horse pushed into his fingers, tilting his head over to the side. “You are such a doof,” he said.
“—No, no, no one ELSE in the family wants to go home and, I dunno, EAT SOMETHING. Castiel, I swear to GOD you are killing me today—” Gabriel threw his arms wide.
It was nice, though, he thought, eating dinner sitting at a table, washing the dishes while Sammy dried and Bobby put away. And later, while the sound of the evening news carried softly through the house, the boys both did their homework at the dining room table.
He took no more than ten paces out his back steps, and stopped, trying to understand what he was seeing.
Joe laid a hand on his shoulder. “Go home and get some rest, Cas. You’re on quarantine for 14 days.”
Castiel shrugged and looked uncomfortable. “I mean. I just thought. I don’t know, that you like to go out and party on New Year’s.”
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel said. “We should start keeping some stuff in the indoor so it’s right there if we need it.” He paused thoughtfully. “In my defense, I had no idea asking her to bend was like a declaration of war.”  He made his voice high pitched, “Why are you putting your leg on me, YOU EVIL DICTATOR, I kill you with my cement head!”  He laughed. His pretty little mare was completely ridiculous sometimes.
Stunned, Castiel just blinks dumbly. Because Dean’s eyes are a brilliant, verdant glassy green and he can see the tear tracks across his cheeks.
Dean had the sensation that time was passing. He was conscious, sort of. He could hear things happening around him, people talking, things beeping relentlessly. But he didn’t care about it. Those things were unimportant.
“See?” Cas said. “You still have all your fingers intact. Come on,” he said to the horse, opening the gate and walking her through. Cas hooked the chain back over the clasp holding the gate shut. He motioned Dean to his left side, while he led the horse on his right side. “So most people like to lead their horses from the horse’s left side. You can do it either side of course, but back in the old days, I think, it started because men were wearing swords on their left hips.”
Green Eyes managed to flutter them open in Castiel’s general direction for a moment before he said “Ugh.”
He doesn’t? What. The hell. Why is his brother such a dickhead? It’s funny, Cas thought this was gonna be hard. Instead he knew, for the first time in his life, exactly what to say.  “If I could have those moments back to do over, Dean, I would tell you how wrong I was.” His voice is surprisingly steady. He reaches out, squeezes Dean's shoulder. “I would tell you how lucky I am to be with you, I would tell you I don’t want to be with anyone else.”
This is exactly what he’d been afraid of, Castiel thought. Dean had never asked him, and he hadn’t exactly been eager to bring it up. Dean just assumed that Castiel was gay. Or bisexual. Whatever. Truth was, gender didn’t really matter very much to Castiel but most of the time, (
She nodded. “Uh-huh. Castiel saved his life you know,” she told Sam. “He’s real lucky he had an angel watching over him that night you know.”
Then Dean happened. And it was so effortless, so easy, that Castiel just hadn’t thought about talking about things like his relative inexperience. No, he was not a virgin, but he hadn’t actually ever dated a man before, and the idea of anal sex, was frankly revolting to him. Maybe he just knew too much. He tried to think about it sometimes, and what he kept thinking about was E. Coli bacteria, and Enterobacter, and pseudomonas. He thought about anal fissures and bowel perforation. The whole idea of rimming made him physically ill to think about.
Cas was not, in fact, watching Stranger Things. He’d decided to do laundry so he didn’t have to think about his dirty scrubs sitting in his hamper. Maybe later he’d open that bottle of white wine from the last winery outing a couple weekends ago. Sometimes he thought that the hospital should offer a free membership to a local wine club given how many nurses he ran into while wine tasting. The more he considered, the more he thought the white was a great idea.
“It’s all right son, you’re fine. So you got beat up a little. Not like they tried to take you in a fair fight or nuthin.”
Dean didn't think much about it when he didn’t hear from Cas the next day. Some days he got home late and just crashed.  However when dinner time came and went and a glance out the window showed the pimpmobile still in the driveway, Dean was kind of concerned.
, he thought. He sat down in the recliner. While not comfortable exactly it was certainly less terrible than a cardiac chair.
There was no way this guy was a nurse, Dean thought. Aren’t nurses supposed to be all caring and shit? The world spun abruptly and exploded into agony. The noise that he made wasn’t a scream okay? It wasn’t. He felt so lightheaded and sick. “…gonna puke,” he mumbled miserably, and then vomited all down his front.
“How and why do two strangers end up plastered together in the front yard in the middle of a pandemic?”
Hot Neighbor was mowing his lawn! “Holy shit,” Cas whispered. Now he remembered coming home that night a couple months ago and wondering what was different. Hot Neighbor had apparently been mowing his yard for months, and Castiel had not noticed at all.
“Whatever, Mike. No, I’d much rather stay up here in the freaking twenty degree weather all winter and watch Castiel work himself to the bone.” Gabriel muttered. He sent:
Gabriel was moderately talented in the dressage arena, but he would rather be showjumping. Castiel on the other hand could easily rise through the ranks in the dressage world if he wasn’t so hell-bent on eventing.
Cas cleared his throat, which was tight for some reason. “I hate when I’m gone,” he said, tipping up Dean’s chin so the boy had to look at him. “Because everything feels awful and wrong.” He tugged Dean and the boy came easily, curling up to Castiel’s chest and tucking his chin over Cas’s shoulder.
The doorbell rang when he had a mouthful of toothpaste, because of COURSE. At the same time, his phone buzzed on the counter. “What the actual fuck.”  Gabriel:
Cas sat on the edge of the bed. “As ‘your angel,’ I am supposed to be watching over you, Dean. That’s how it works. And you are ‘my person’, and your job is to let me watch over you.”
Another picture came through, this time showing Castiel with his forearms resting on the horse’s back. He was leaning forward, beaming at Winchester who was smirking back at him.
Dean faces some realities about his injuries and his post-hospital needs. Castiel struggles with his PTSD and ethical nursing issues.
And Bobby had cut John off, his tone of voice positively artic. “You don’t want to finish that sentence, John. You just don’t. Those boys deserve a chance to at least finish twelfth grade before you finish making them into soldiers. And even soldiers need a good education, so they can make good decisions.”
he messaged, then stuffed his phone in his boot. Gathering his courage, he stepped back out into the main barn.
Dean closed his eyes, savoring the closeness. He hadn’t realized how starved for touch he’d become. “Swear to God, I wouldn’t change a thing. As long as we ended up here.”
One pretty cool thing about Virginia, Dean discovered, is that there was a thriving delivery service. He checked the time: 7:30. That mean the dinner delivery should be here shortly. He’d ordered burgers and fries from a local diner called the Mountainside Grille. From the website, it looked like they had a pretty nice view of the nearby mountains. Hopefully, they could go there in person before too long and eat in.
“Hi Jim,” Dean says, and oh, Castiel really underestimated how much it hurts to hear Jimmy’s name directed at him. “Please, come in.” He sounds tense, formal.
“Okay Castiel. Here’s what we are going to do. Stop cleaning that fucking—I mean it, step away from the neatsfoot. Go get your bitch of a horse. I don’t care if you have to walk all the way out to the back forty. Go get your horse, and meet me in the indoor in forty five minutes, you are getting a riding lesson.”  Without waiting for a response Gabriel stomped out of the barn and down the bluestone path to the first stall barn. Fuck sitting around angsting, he had work to do.
“Uh huh. You get that you’re not my nurse, right?” Dean asked. He waited a beat then added in a low voice, “Um. I think about that stuff too, man.” He watched Castiel’s chest rise and fall with a deep breath.
,” he hissed.  “You’re my angel; I’m your person, that’s how it works! That’s how it’s supposed to be!” He was looking genuinely upset now, like he couldn’t believe that Cas was being this stupid.
“Shut it, Samantha. I have my reasons.” Dean pulled into the student lot and began the tortuous exercise known as finding a parking space.
Unlocking it and flopping into the front seat, Dean realized he didn’t have to wait for Sammy today because Sammy was home recovering too!
The past two nights they’d sat together eating dinner and watching Netflix. They were working their way through the first season of Stranger Things just one episode a night. This thing between them…it felt…big, it felt...right. Like it didn’t matter that Dean hadn’t kissed him yet. It didn’t matter that they didn’t sleep together. It felt like…He smiled. Kinda like it was meant to be.
They used the backboard to slide him from the bed to the scanner table. The ventilator tubing came undone and the patient coughed wildly, for what felt like forever before they managed to get it reconnected. The rest of the road trip went smoothly. Castiel kept the patient alive until the end of his shift. Just as he was about to clock out, Joe the charge nurse grabbed him in the locker room. “Hey Cas, I need you a second.”
He drove straight up into the ambulance bay, not giving a shit AT ALL, and got out, shouting, “I NEED HELP OUT HERE!”
He coded abruptly while Castiel  cracked jokes and filled out computerized forms. Everything went to shit after that, and even after intubation and several vasopressors, the man remained unresponsive.  Castiel packed up the patient and with one other staff member, they wheeled him down to radiology for a CT scan.
Castiel tilted his head back with a huff. “Gabe, I don’t, I mean…I don’t know if I’m wired that way. I just…I don’t like many people. I don’t like dealing with them, I don’t like talking to them. I…Dean is just…different.”
Sorry it has been a while since I updated. I was on vacation and immersing myself in the awesomeness that is Universal Studios Diagon Alley. Thank you to everyone who has left a comment or a 'kudos', you guys just don't know how that makes me all glowy.
“What, them? Damn straight I don’t want to be friends with them.” Dean waited a beat. “Look man, maybe I’m outta line, but um, are you okay?” He gestured to the bruise on Novak’s face that had darkened over the day.
“I’m really, okay. Well, I’ll take the ibuprofen.” Castiel slowly turned on his side, grunting as more aches and pains became known.
Castiel slowly brought his arms up and tightened them around Dean’s back. His skin was warm under his fingers. He closed his eyes. From far away he heard himself take a huge breath and let it out. His throat felt tight and wetness seeped from his eyes. It felt so fucking good to be held, finally, after being along for so long. He tried, he really tried, to hold back the sobs bubbling up from his soul, but he just couldn’t.
“Jesus Christ!” The shout came at the same moment as the horse in the stall startled and Dean heard a crash from inside the stall. A golden brown head emerged from somewhere under the horse, who was still snorting and rolling its eyes. Gabriel rubbed his head, looking around, freezing completely when he saw Dean.
A loud crash from outside the house startled the shit out of Castiel while he was folding his clothes in the mudroom. What the fuck! It sounded like it was right out his back door.! He flipped the back light on, single bulb, not super effective, and turned back to grab the big mag-light.
It's August, there’s a wedding, and Castiel is again in a penguin suit. He’s standing on a beach and his hair is blowing like crazy.
“It’s okay Dean, you probably had low blood pressure from the loss of blood. That happens sometimes.” His head lolled forward and Cas shifted to support his weight better. Dean’s lips were quickly approaching blue territory and that was way worse than purple. “I got you. Just keep breathing, okay? Can you do that for me?” He wedged one leg between Dean’s so he wouldn’t slide out of the car while he used his shirt to wipe the emesis from around Dean’s mouth and chin.
He had gone down to the scanner since Dean seemed to want him there. He got agitated and upset when he couldn’t hear Cas talking to him. Castiel assumed that Dean had a concussion given the hit he’d taken to the head and his reaction to having his pupils checked, and bright lights in general.
Castiel padded down the hallway and came back with a soft looking white undershirt. “Trade you,” he said, dangling the clean shirt.
But Gabriel just chuckled a little, and patted the horse’s neck absently before letting himself out of the stall. He held a large plastic pitchfork and had what looked like wood shavings in his hair. “No worries, I’m good. You looking for Castiel?”
Today was that this was the first time he was on Castiel’s side. Castiel narrowed his eyes. He never could stand bullies.
He arrived at the cafeteria, and after craning his neck a little, saw Novak way over there in the far corner, of course at the smallest table sitting alone. As always, Dean saw, Novak had a truly ridiculous amount of food on his plate and was shoveling it in like he hadn’t eaten in a week. “Hey, dude,” he greeted, and sat down, flinging his bag on the floor.
She snorted and tossed her head. Her expressions were pretty clear to Castiel and he could almost hear her talking to him. “I don’t have to if I don’t want to,” she would have said. She lowered her head now, and nosed his pockets.
The first time they try to have sex, it doesn’t exactly go the way Dean hoped. Okay, so sue him, he’d been entertaining fantasies of fucking Cas silly. Opening him up slowly, licking all around him until his hole was nice and wet while Dean stroked his cock at the same time. He imagined all the noises that Cas might make in his deep rumbly voice, and it was oh so easy to imagine the way he’d moan, “Dean,” right before Dean made Cas come everywhere.
He hadn’t meant to get so defensive with Dean’s brother, he truly hadn’t. But he kept thinking, where the hell were you? You didn’t notice your brother went missing for over a week? Didn’t bother to call around to the hospitals? Castiel forced himself to relax. Took some deep breaths.  Really, he was just glad that he was in a position to help when help was needed. Lots of nurses had this same problem.
Dean shoved his hands into his pockets looking down for a second. “Listen, man, I really would but--”
(Sorry about the lights in your eyes, we have to make sure your brain is okay. Can you squeeze my hand.)
Still…. Cas considered. It wasn’t Dean, but what was the harm in just checking?  He pushed his chair back and stood up. Opening the door to his ‘room’ he called out, “Dean? Sam?”
The doors slid back as Castiel returned. He retrieved the chair from next to the window and brought it around next to the bed.
So Castiel sat next to him, holding his good hand, and just talked to him. He kept up a running commentary, explaining over and over everything that had happened and why the nurses were doing the things they did. From time to time, he’d glance over expecting to see Dean asleep, but find those green eyes peeping at him from under mostly closed lids. Those times, Dean would squeeze his hands and wiggle his toes when asked. Dean would point at the chair and make the X over his heart, while trying to keep his eyes open.
Castiel looked like he wanted to argue, but didn’t. He laid his palm on the window, so the pane was the only thing between their skin. He bit his lip, then said, “I love you, even if you are an assbutt for yelling at me.”
“Cassie, is your boyfriend still bugging you about all those love-taps your girlfriend is giving you?” Gabriel smirked at the road.
The best part about working with horses, Castiel often thought, was how completely it emptied out your mind, while making you so completely focused at the same time.  ‘The back forty’, as Gabriel referred to the mares pasture, really was about a mile and change away from the grooming barn. Castiel elected to cross into the main pasture instead of walking down the dirt road and all the way around. This was way shorter, if a little more treacherous. The ground had been frozen for days, and hoofprints that sank in when the ground was damp, were now cemented into that shape. Luckily, Castiel had very nice boots with excellent ankle support.
At the end of Spanish, which was the last class of the day, Novak turned to Dean and said, “You must not want to make any friends here.”
On the flip side, both Sam and Jess were physicians at the local hospital so they were working more than ever.
Shattered glass littered the interior. He leaned over and peered under the steering column. The part of the car where the gas pedal used to be was just…destroyed. The keys were even still sitting in the ignition. Castiel removed them, tucking them into his pocket for safekeeping. He retrieved an old towel from the shed and used it to sweep the glass off the bench seat. He carefully got in and looked around on the floorboards. He spied a small dark green backpack peeking out from under the passenger side. He leaned over the front seat and briefly did a visual check of the back in case there was anything potentially valuable there.
, his mind whispered, but that clearly wasn’t right. When Dean prayed for him, it was like taking the lid off a supernova. Impossible to ignore, or just about so. Which was why he had always answered Dean’s prayers in those early years. This felt…gentle. Soft. And neither of those terms applied to Dean, generally speaking.
He poked his head in the doctor’s workroom and notified them about the bloody secretions. He was pretty sure this patient was going to need a bronchoscopy before the end of the shift.
Anyway, Dean seemed to do much better with familiar faces, and the nursing staff made a strong effort to keep his caregivers consistent. He also responded really well to Castiel’s voice. There had been one or two occasions in which he returned from the rest room to hear ventilator alarms going off in Dean’s room, and the man himself struggling and fighting with the ventilator, looking around all panicky.
If you had told Castiel Novak last year that he would attend something like 5 weddings in the span of a single year, he would have scoffed. Unfortunately for him, that’s exactly what happened.
neck. “My Alpha,” Castiel says, sliding his arms underneath Dean’s body and holding him close. “I’ve been waiting for you, for so
Cas tries to return to his normal life. Everyone fails to be normal. The boys accidentally tell each other future plans. Much fluff!
“I didn’t know,” Castiel says. “I’m...look, I’m on some heavy duty suppressants right now so I can’t tell an Alpha from an Omega today.” He hesitates but adds, “Some people really like weddings, but they just make me feel sad. And that’s not exactly something I’m proud of.”
The thing about hospitals, Dean discovered, is that time moves differently there. He was unbelievably tired but it seemed like every time he dozed off someone came into his room and woke him up. First the respiratory therapist who was a tiny lady who spoke with a VERY LOUD New York accent. Nothing but fear got him through those breathing exercises.
The boy peered at Cas through a fringe of sandy hair. Then he scowled. Cas was hard pressed to not smile. Such a fierce expression on such a sweet looking little boy.  Dean crossed his arms over his chest. “Where were you!” he demanded.
He eased the Impala forward to the farm entrance. He saw the ‘Saving Ponies, Jumping Things’ sign from the website. In person, he noticed a smaller line of text: ‘A Novak family business’. Dean snorted, amused, and pulled the car into the parking area, just behind the barn.  He turned off the car and got out, zipping his jacket up tight. He glanced around, but didn’t see anyone.
Hannah somehow rearranged her features so she looked kind and sympathetic. “Bless your heart…you poor sweet old man.”
Castiel had been training at his brother’s sides since he was little. It was clear from an early age that the Novak brothers all had the same natural affinity that their father had. And while their Dad had handed over the reins to Michael and retired, Castiel was still working his way up. You had to know every job from the ground up in this business. Nothing was too small.
“I was so scared, Dean.” Cas said eventually. “You have to understand, I’ve never felt like this before. I’ve never…wanted someone like this before. It was never an issue before you, trying to explain how I think about things like gender and orientation, because it was never important enough to bother with.” He kissed Dean’s hand before releasing it, in order to snuggle closer. “Maybe we should make a list of things that we each don’t want, and then write down what we want a lot.”
so upset? He reached out carefully, making sure the boy didn’t flinch or lean away. He squeezed Dean’s shoulder gently, just like he normally did. “Dean,” he said finally. “Help me understand what’s making you upset. Are you angry with me?”
Smiling, Dean said, “Okay awesome. I thought you were about to say something terrible from the look on your face. I like you too, by the way.”
“Wow, I mean you make it sound, really cool. I don’t think I ever seriously thought about riding like that.” Dean sounded enthralled.
“His car is exactly where he left it. Yes, I’m certain.” Castiel stood up abruptly. “Dean I’m going to step outside and finish this conversation, is that all right with you?”
Understandably, the guy did not appreciate that too much and tried to flinch away. He made a noise that sounded like a groan crossed with a whimper.
He thought about Dean pulling his short off as he worked on Castiel’s yard. He thought about the attractive flex of muscles as he pushed and pulled the lawnmower back and forth.
“Yes, I can see that,” the voice answered. “I know it hurts like a bitch, but no joke man, you’ve lost a lot of blood, and I don’t want you to lose any more.”
Bobby Singer was a gruff older man, who was like an honorary uncle to Sam and Dean.  Bobby was the one who had –thank GOD—managed to convince Dad to let them settle long enough to finish high school. BOTH of them, Bobby had thundered at John Winchester.  That, Dean remembered, that had been a bad night. Dad and Bobby screaming at each other. Dad trying to drag Dean into the argument, saying, Dean doesn’t care about finishing high school, he can just get his GED later, after all, what’s he gonna need it for when—
Sam gave him a bitchface. “You just want to talk to that guy you hang out with. Which is fine, but why do you have to do it so EARLY?”  Sam leaned his head against the glass.
Dean could get behind except reading for any length of time made his head hurt like crazy. Must be that pesky concussion syndrome, he thought.
Here’s the thing. Dean hasn’t been completely honest about how much the lingering aches and pains from the accident are bothering him. He’s been in physical therapy for his shoulder now for four weeks. The swelling in his leg had finally gone down enough for the Docs to finally do the surgery to fix the broken ankle.
Castiel laughed out loud. “Because it’s my job. Because I studied a lot in school and I study a lot even now. Because if I don’t know all this stuff…” he sobered. “I have to know it, Dean, because someone might die if I don’t.” He looked down.
Snorting, Castiel answered, “I’m an ICU nurse and you may not know this but we’re kind of in high demand right now.”
“As a matter of fact,” Castiel continued, undeterred, “All of the nurses are trained to instruct patients on every single one of the medications they administer. It’s part of the safety checks taught throughout nursing school.”
“The friends you’d have if you could be bothered to talking to anyone who has less than four legs!” Gabriel pressed two fingers against the bridge of his nose, as if to ward off a headache.
“I don’t know about that,” he demurred, “but use it or lose it, so.” He smiled. “What are you doing here anyway, all dressed up.” He indicated the blouse and skirt combo she was wearing.
As Castiel had feared, Dean got worse before he got better. On post op day 2 he developed a fever of 39 degrees, hypotension and tachycardia. The physician teams thought he had pneumonia (ventilator acquired) but cultured some of his blood and urine to make sure the infection had not seeded. They started him on broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Zosyn (Castiel really hoped Dean didn’t have any allergies) and started trying to wake him up by lightening his sedation.  Castiel had pulled the regular chair close to the bed and was reading parts of the newspaper out loud. He happened to glance over and saw Dean’s eyes were open and he was looking around.
Finally, just like a normal family. And so what if Dean happened to wonder what gave Novak that big shiner on his jaw? He didn’t really want to know why the kid walked around filthy all day. He didn’t.
In Gabriel’s truck, Castiel fastened the seat belt and tilted his seat back a little. He waited until Gabe had started the engine before saying, “Please, I am not in the mood right now, Gabe.”
He rocked back in his desk chair, propping one boot clad ankle on the desk corner. He rubbed absently at a smudge across the toe of his boot.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Hey man, I um, I hope you’re not mad, but I think your brother invited me for dinner.”
“I don’t actually, and how do you like that? The docs want to kick me out of the ICU, but the other docs are like ‘Nope, no way, he’s too much work for a nurse with four other patients’, like come on I’m not THAT much work—”
Just like, according to the record company, they didn’t want him seeing guys because ‘most of his appeal was for single women.’ Dean had tried he really had but he couldn’t help being who he was. He’d only been trying to fight it his whole life. He’d been so discreet with Aaron but everyone had a cell phone these days and it’s easy to go viral from a short clip.
“I remember too many people talking, but I kept hearing you telling me to move my toes. And I couldn’t disappoint you. I had to make them move no matter what.  I remember a cold hallway and a hard board and a weird tunnel thing that made scary noise—”
Wednesday of that week he cooked some cheeseburgers on the stove. He pulled his french fries out of the toaster oven when he heard the sound of a lawn mower start up. Castiel paused, cocking his head to the side. If he didn’t know better he’d say that noise was coming from his front yard. Wait. Wait. He took the burgers off the heat and went to the front windows.
Dean thought that Sam was doing a good job of pissing Castiel off. Dean also noticed that Castiel was very careful not to mention that he had been the person at the scene.
A few minutes later Cas reappeared in comfy sweats and an old t shirt. He wore moccasins on his feet, and his hair was damp and curling at the ends. He looked like he’d toweled it off briefly and let it do whatever. He had dark circles under his eyes.
He captures his mates beautiful lips with his own, loving the feel of him. Dean kisses back eagerly, straining upwards for more.
“I may have ripped your car door off the hinges before I pulled you out of it.” Castiel rubbed his sweaty palms on his jeans. “I went out the other day and looked and the car door was on the ground. It…I tried the handle and it just wouldn’t open. So I stood there and I thought, please God, don’t let me fail, and then I just pulled the door off like it was easy.”
He watched Dean watch Sammy for a long time, longer than he expected, before Dean finally rocked back and hauled himself to standing. He stood looking down at his brother for a long moment before laying a hand on Sam’s head for a moment.  “Don’t do that again, you dumbass,” he heard Dean whisper. Only then did Dean notice Bobby lurking in the doorway between the living room and kitchen.
“Dean, listen to me. You have been through something that might’ve killed you. Your body is fighting a war right now. You’re recovering from multiple surgeries, and broken bones,
Covering his mouth, Castiel hid his smirk. It hurt but it was so worth it. Coach Brown looked like he might be about to have a coronary. Through gritted teeth he said, “Both of you, clean up and get to the office. I am calling your parents—”
“Here, give this to her. Hold your hand out flat like this,” Cas demonstrated. “She likes peppermints. Most horses have a sweet tooth.” When Dean hesitated, Cas added, “Want me to help you?” Without waiting for an answer, he opened up Dean’s hand, which Dean had instinctively curled up and grasped his palm, encouraging Dean to stretch his hand out flat with the peppermint. Dean resisted the urge to snatch his hand back, sure he was about to have his fingers bitten off.
It’s Wednesday so Dean starts mowing Dark Hair’s lawn. He’s been doing it every week since the end of August. Since he started paying attention, he’d discovered that the guy works a lot of nights, some different days of the week but always Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights. Dean wondered sometimes how many hours a week Dark Hair works because it seems like he is never home. Since the days were getting so short, Dean had to mow during the day now, but he still tried to keep it to later in the day, mindful that Dark Hair was likely trying to sleep in the morning.
Today’s target was the same gangly kid they’d been picking on for a week or so. Lucky the kid was quick and surprisingly nimble for someone who clearly had outgrown his body. The kid never complained about it though, never bitched about the multiple attacks, just spun out of the way until he could catch and retaliate with lethal accuracy.  Castiel couldn’t exactly pick off the douchebags on his own team so he had to settle for lobbing easy balls at the kid.
Dean shook his head. “Nope. Sam came over and hung out for awhile. Got my appointments for therapy next week.” He hesitated before asking, “What are you doing for Christmas?”
Slowly, Dean lifts his gaze and locks with Castiel’s eyes.  His fingers squeeze Cas’s. “I’m...starting to believe you.”
“Are you kidding me, man? I don’t know a single freaking person here, and the rest of these guys seem like douchebags.” He gestured at the rest of the class, filing out.
On some level he was aware of other things, like being rolled back and forth. His arms were picked up and plunked back down on pillows. From time to time he was wiped down with something warm and wet that smelled good.
Gabriel responded with another picture: Castiel and Winchester staring at each other over the back of Cassie’s crazy little mare.  Michael squinted at the picture, then snickered.
He reaches out slowly, and strokes a gentle hand down his mate’s shoulder. The other man shifts, then goes completely still. Cas hears the start of a deep rumbling growl. His mate pulls Castiel closer, shifting so their legs are intertwined. He stretches, and buries his face in Castiel’s neck. “Mate,” the alpha says, and Cas nods.
“Maybe plant some flowers in the front yard. Grow tomatoes in the back. I want…I want everything, Cas. As long as it’s with you.”
Meanwhile, Dean tried to regroup, because he had apparently just crossed a big red line. “Shit, I am so sorry, I didn’t mean to—” he had enough brains to not say
“Of course,” he said, entering the numbers. He looked up through his lashes at Dean, then sent himself a text so he’d have Dean’s number also.
Dean’s eyes flash red. He shifts under Castiel so that his filling cock is pressing up against his ass. “Take me, I’m yours,” he grins up at his Omega, and pulls him down on top of him. He holds Castiel’s face in his large hands and presses their lips together. Dean’s mouth is positively sinful, soft perfect lips. He nips at Castiel’s bottom lip, and they’re kissing deeply, tongues sliding together and rocking against each other.
Gabriel sighed deeply. “Does he love me? Does he love me not,” he murmured as his thumbs flew over the keys.
The driver was unconscious or dead, covered in blood. There was a long laceration from his left temple straight down to his eyebrow, and a flap of skin was hanging off. Dark blood dripped steadily from this wound. Countless small nicks across his face gave his face an alien look. “Hey can you hear me?” He pointed the flashlight at the guys face and pulled his eyelids up. Both of his pupils were equal and reactive, the irises a clear green. Now that he could see in the car better, Castiel thought that his right shoulder might be dislocated. He noticed the steering column had taken some damage. He shined the light towards the guy’s feet. Hard to tell if anything broken. But he needed to stop the bleeding from his head and fast because he was losing blood at a pretty good clip and those fucking scalp lacs bled like a bitch.
“Are you okay? Cas! Talk to me!” Fear lit up Dean’s insides, and the pounding of his heart suddenly seemed loud.
After a few weeks of  coming to terms with the shattered economy and freaked out people, Dean bit the bullet, called Sammy, and told him what was going on. Like many folks in their thirties, Dean lived paycheck to paycheck. He had just a few hundred bucks in the bank, and  had been scraping by on ramen, pasta and cheese for a week. It helped that Sam and Jess acted like Dean was the one doing THEM a favor instead of the other way around. Still, Dean was more than happy to help take care of Jack while the kids' parents tried to save people’s lives. He’d already practically raised Sam, so he wasn’t too worried about taking care of Jack.
Eyeing the plate ready for him, Castiel widened his eyes and said, “Starving.” He settled next to Dean, close enough that their thighs and shoulders brushed. He hunched over his plate, scarfing down the meal.
Strange as this was, now that he was making an effort, schoolwork took up a significant chunk of time. When Bobby had laid down the law to Dad, Dean had thought that he’d end up getting a part time job. But Dean had COMPLETELY underestimated Bobby’s commitment to Operation Your Ass is Graduating No Matter What. Bobby would not hear of anything interfering with the boys schooling.
The ground rose in slow motion. Castiel had plenty of time to think about how much this was about to hurt. His chin hit the ground hard stunning him with the explosion of pain. He opened his eyes to blurred vision and saw a sneaker coming at his face. Instinctively he curled into a ball to protect himself. From far away he heard shouting and then he was at the bottom of a pile of boys, all struggling against each other.  Castiel struggled to turn, but instead saw an opening and scuttled from the bottom of the sinuously moving pile. He staggered to his feet, and found one of the juniors beating the shit out of Gangly.
After a few minutes, Dean saw a silver SUV pull up, and then a familiar dark haired man got out. He truly appreciated the view. Cas was smoking hot, and didn’t seem to have a clue about it. His jeans were tight across the thighs and yeah. Dean definitely wanted to see more of that.
At least the little mare had started putting her head down and moving forward a little better. Sometimes it felt like riding a freight train. Okay, Castiel, he said to himself, time to move, and dragged himself off to Biology.
As threatened, Cas got hold of Dean by his shoulder and knees and spun his butt on the seat so he was facing out the door and his legs dangled over the side. With a quick glance and a wince, Cas decided that Dean was probably right about that leg being broken. Dean swayed against Castiel’s hold and went suddenly gray and pasty. Fuck. He recognized what was about to happen as Dean managed to say “Gonna puke” and then vomited all down his front, splattering Castiel with vomit below the waist.
