“It’s a perfectly normal question,”
a boyfriend. Repeating the mantra over and over, his hands working to put all his study material away. Once the table was cleared, his eyes lifted to the lone cup, filled with what had to be cold coffee now. This was the fifth time Dean hadn’t shown up, usually, he was good at keeping a routine, he must be busy to have not shown up for almost two weeks.
“How do you want me?” Dean teased after dropping his shirt to join his pants.
“But you sit all day.” Dean paused in anything else he was going to say when Castiel glared at him from over his shoulder as he changed into his pajamas. “Then how would you like to spend the evening?”
“A dream?” Castiel questioned, squinting his eyes as he thought about the word. “I don't ever have dreams. What are dreams usually about?” Dean brought his knees up, wrapping his arms around them as he pondered about it.
Those green eyes staring happily up at him after their first encounter. The color took his breath away whenever he was pinned with them. Every time the man spoke directly at him he was rendered speechless.
He looked on across the water to the man standing on the dock, clad in the ceremonial attire of blues and whites for his family heritage, in the middle amongst his men as they continued to pull him, his betrothed, closer.
“You ready for my Cock,” Dean questioned right as he pulled out the Dildo, Castiel containing his whimper at the sudden empty feeling.
Click.
Dean smiled, reaching forward for the pitcher and chalice to pour himself a glass of wine, wishing someone had brought ale instead.
The sound of the barrel being opened, another bullet being placed in it before the spinning noise was stopped by the barrel clicking into place.
“He’s straight and has a girlfriend.” Blue eyes glaring at his friend from across the cafe. It was closing time and they were taking sections of the store to mop. “Besides, I have a boyfriend. And he’s not my type”
He hummed in agreement, feeling the cold tip press just at the entrance of his hole.
“You don’t...you don’t understand,”
“Didn’t happen,” Dean opened his eyes, his entire face changing to one that Castiel was unfamiliar with. He didn’t like it. It was all serious and closed off. Castiel must have struck a nerve. “Anyways, take it or leave it.”
The person stood from their spot, holding the vase close, pulling the hood down revealing...a woman!?
Dean watched them go, mouth tightly shut, unsure of what to do.
The pale hand slipped through the hole to grasp Dean’s hand in a soft grip. His hands were softer than Dean expected. He relished the contact, the man’s hands were warm.
“I don-”
“Well until he finds me a princess to marry, I am a free man,” with that said, and wanting to get out of the conversation, he hopped over the fence. Patting his brother on the shoulder before dashing towards the servant girls.
The man was now on his knees before Dean.
“Not yet, it’s gotten a little complicated,” was all he said, remembering that he had placed his phone in his coat pocket that he left in the back. On purpose.
"Let's start from the beginning. My demons were getting restless. Feeding became hard. So we struck a deal with these lowly humans in their time of need."
Smirking triumphantly at the awkward pause between the two, he took the opportunity to slam his head back, grinning when he made contact after hearing a crunch followed by a howl in pain.
Easy enough to deny.
He thought, when he was little, that it was the coolest thing in the world. That was until his father decided to control and shape everything Dean did, including those he dated.
Relieved that he wasn't met with resistance.
“Uh, sorry,” He apologized, glancing back at his phone before pocketing it. He grabbed the box before him to help bring it to the front of the store.
Eventually, the beast quieted, the image of the dragon fading into the darkness, its red eyes staring menacingly at him.
‘Sam’ glanced up from his studies, nodding his head in acknowledgment as a long stray piece of hair fell in his face.
A dead-end!
“Who betrayed me, Dean.” Castiel’s voice is firm, gaze unwavering.
Castiel bit his lip as he watched him take the tip into his mouth, bobbing his head to take Castiel inch by inch.
A blonde-haired girl had flirted with him, touching his left forearm while handing him a card, saying how they should hang out and get to know each other better.
His bed was so soft and warm that spending the day wrapped in his comforter wasn’t a bad idea. He rolled over to his right side, adjusting his position so he could lull himself back to dreamland.
Fear. That's definitely fear creeping through his body when his first thought was Sam.
The entire room was plunged in pink lighting, loud music pulsing through the speakers, and people everywhere. Dean stared around the place, unsure of what he stumbled upon.
It took a couple of weeks for his body to look strong and powerful, deciding then that he wanted to find his home. A castle settled near the end of the world. Settled among jagged rocks, cliffs, and mountains that were hard to navigate towards, unless you were a creature and could see the secret passageway.
Lightning cracking across the sky, illuminating the darkroom.
A groan in front of him snapped Dean back to the man before him. Cas’s eyes were closed, a hand coming up to hold his nose.
A different person than on TV. That man's confident. Has the aura of authority about him.
In between all of this Castiel barely heard the soft knock on the window. He glanced down at his watch and noticed he had five minutes left.
From what Cas knows of the man, the guys got quite an extensive customer list. He was already really popular with the ladies. His male clientele has been slowly growing from what they've discussed during these last couple of sessions.
One of the things he’s learned while being trained is to not intermingle with the clients. It’s not what they were there for.
Unable to believe this was happening.
“Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t need to go,”
Taking that as his cue, he took the tip of it to his lips and giving it a slow suck.
“Sleep,” and everything went black.
"No one likes seeing two people getting it on all and heavy. Makes them uneasy,"
"Yes, I know. But. This is different. You said no proposals. So the one way around it is to make a promise," Dean said while opening the box, a simple silver band standing amongst the blue velvet. "This is a promise. One that will tell you, every time you look down at it, that I care for you, very much,"
So now Dean is sitting at his dining room table, all four cards sitting before him. All looking similar, black, holographic looking with the same address, except each one, had a single letter in the bottom right corner.
“Well let’s get started. When are you meeting this guy?” Castiel asked as he watched Dean crawl onto the bed. He moved back on his hands and knees so his knees were inches away from the edge, before dropping to his forearms to present his ass towards Castiel.
The kid is a freaking genius. Glancing over his shoulder one last time, he walked through the doorway towards the throne room.
Digging his heels in once again, he tugged his arm back.
“Dean?” a familiar voice calling out from the hallway, a moment later Sam’s head popped around the corner. “Hey, I got more snacks and beer.” Hauling an armful of bags to emphasize his point.
"Fucking hell, Cas!" the man panted out, green eyes looked up in irritation as he tried to even out his breathing while wiping his mouth. A brief glare to which Cas replied with a cocky smirk and a shrug of his shoulders, the man went back to slurping and sucking.
"Castiel…" Dean pleaded, watching the man clutch something tight in his hand, bringing it to his lips.
His first encounter with a male client had resulted in some serious pain. Even though the guy had apologized profusely, despite being gentle as hell, it still hurt.
Don’t look up, don’t lookup.
Cas' dick popped right out from its restraints, mere inches from his face. Dean turned his gaze upwards to the man before giving the head a small lick.
Castiel paused. Everything. His tapping finger, his highlighter mid highlighting. His thoughts.
The crowd screaming in terror as the Dragon descended upon the village as it searched for its prize.
“A Senator," Dean began, waving his arms in exaggeration after Sam brought his image up on the screen to confirm it. The man looks exactly like his picture, except for the hair. Usually, it's combed over and neat, now it looks like he just rolled out of bed, no pun intended.
He hadn’t noticed Mary standing in front of him until the camera had gone off.
Please check out her art:
Dean get's Castiel a Burrito Blanket out of the blue, Castiel doesn't understand it's purpose until he realizes how soft it is.
He shuffled the cards into a pile before scooting his chair out so that he could take the empty beer bottle to the kitchen. It was late and Dean was supposed to help open tomorrow.
Glancing down at Bobby’s body, the man’s chest slowly rising and falling, Dean walked to the doors, pushing them open.
“We know,” everyone except Sam commented. She gave everyone a dirty look before smiling. Everyone else joined in before they set up their next round.
The locks are on the outside just in case of situations like this. The door gave a loud groan when he opened the door, the strangers head popping up to see who it is. His shoulders remained tense, his face set in neutral as Dean shut the door and leaned against it while crossing his arms over his chest.
When his vision finally cleared, Dean was able to sit up straighter to take in his surroundings. Bodies. Everywhere. Gouged, bloodied, and scattered across the courtyard. He turned to Meg, surprised to see her with smudges of blood covering her face and clothes.
"And you said it's the way it's supposed to be, the contrast of sweet and cold."
There was only one new notification.
“That’s ok. You’ve become quite the regular and consistent with what you get. Unless today is the day you do change it?”
He felt ice in his veins when he read those words.
“All clear here, Benny. How is the outside?”
Hopefully, the length of this chapter makes up for the neglect I did not mean to give this story T.T
Dean took off at a sprint to catch up, managing to catch a glimpse of Bobby and Sam sprawled out on the floor, reaching the doorway in time to see two people shove a tied up Castiel into the trunk of an awaiting car.
Unzipping the pants.
The conversation paused when one of the patrons came up to pay their tab. Sam kept his head down, a fork in hand as he poked at his food.
Dean had lost track of how many he received, his cheeks must tomato red at this point when he didn’t receive another, his body tensed. Maybe this is just to build anticipation?
And it warmed Castiel’s heart.
“Out the back,” Dean scrambled to shut the door, grabbing the closest thing, a candelabra, to stick in the handles to keep the door closed.
She gave a nod of her head, throwing in an overdramatic curtsey for good measure, making Castiel smile.
His army was becoming restless, wanting blood and revenge after all the years of waiting for his return. Now that he was, he was holding them back. But none of them were willing to go against his command. The display of power he demonstrated at the very beginning of his return was enough to quiet even the most bloodthirsty among them.
The voice whispered in his mind, gasping when the touch returned, grasping his softened member.
Castiel tightened his grip as Dean held him in the air, one hand on his ass, encouraging his right leg to hook around the man while the other still had his one leg hooked over the other.
“This game just keeps getting weirder and weirder,” Castiel said to himself after getting into his car.
"Dean, this guy is trying to stop the purge. You're just gonna let him get fed to the wolves?" Sam was now standing.
Lucifer looked from Dean to the blade.
“You know what I realized?”
Looking around for the creaking noise grabbed his attention, he noticed branches and some kind of mesh covering something half sitting in the water.
The first two muttered an apology as the third rubbed his hands together, the shroud of his hood blocking Dean’s view of his face.
He felt fingers grasp the flat surface of the plug and a slight tugging. He shuddered at the empty feeling combined with the pain of his ass.
A silence fell over them like a thick fog. Castiel taking note of the index shifting between yellow and green, down to red and back to green.
“Are we still on for dinner at 7?"
The man in the corner smirked, using his tankard to cover it as he watched the tavern people lose their mind.
“I love you too,” Dean murmured, lacing their fingers together. Castiel doesn’t remember the last time he’s ever felt this happy, his heart racing at the admission as the two finished dressing. Castiel looked out the door first, the commotion hadn’t died down which means they were still gathering people up.
The Dragon flapped its wings angrily at each note, roaring as he fought. Dean continued to shake but kept playing.
“Yeah, Sam gets first dibs on sleeping because he needs his beauty rest,” Dean commented from the gun cabinet, loading up his 9mm, glancing over at his little brother with a smirk.
He heard a sharp gasp before the sound of the rope snapping. Opening his eyes, Dean watched the kite drift off with the wind.
Closing his eyes to block the thoughts, he could still see the blood on his hands.
“Yeah, his name is Sam. Charming fellow, smart as a whip,” she continued. “Never seen your brother so in love.”
the creature cooed, feeling its hand on his chest, pinching his nipple, causing Dean to gasp out.
“I have a favor to ask,”
Their head was just out of view.
More bodies, blood, and a storm of fury were clear the moment he stepped onto the landing. He didn’t know where Castiel had stormed off to, he couldn’t hear a sound over the eerie silence that blanketed the castle halls. But he didn’t have to guess where to go when he felt a small pull in his chest. The insistent need grew after turning in that direction. He could feel his anger slowly begin to boil with each step. The exhilaration that this day, the one that he and Castiel had been waiting for, was finally coming true.
Someone in an all-white dress was standing across the street, in the middle of the park, directly across from Dean.
A small voice in the back of his mind reminded him to undress as well, clumsily reaching for his belt just as Dean took off his shirt. He’d just managed to get his pants and underwear to his hips before Dean took hold of them, pulling off the rest of the way, hunger in his eyes as he took in Cas’ cock as it sprung free from its restraints.
The money had already been counted and placed in the safe, everything tidied up and ready for tomorrow, Castiel turned the lock. The thud of it being secured signaled Inias to ask if his ride was on his way.
Even now, lying in his bed with his latest conquest on the other side of his king-sized bed, did he let himself wallow in the emptiness.
Gulping, his throat suddenly dry, he looked down at himself. Maybe he should have worn a shirt? Too late now, taking in his black sweat pants.
She looked up when she heard the clunking of his shoes on the expensive tile, her lips painted red as they pulled back into a smile showing off her purely white teeth.
“Dean, please.” His brother interrupted. His attention moved to the man who was currently hanging on Dean. “This-this isn’t you.”
“I-I’m not.” Castiel tried in between trying to take in some air and trying to claw at the man's hand.
"Lastly, I was confined to a cage to live out the rest of my life!" At that, his iris' flashed red.
Dean nearly jumped out of his skin when a groan came from the thought to be an unconscious man.
He watched the man look from the door to him, contemplating. Castiel kept the man’s hand on his cheek with his own, turning to kiss the palm to gain Dean’s attention.
He turned around until he was able to sit on his legs, so his ass wasn't touching the couch, in front of the man.
"Sir?" Castiel asked again.
Growling in frustration, Castiel licked up the remnants of blood off the body kneeling in front of him before tossing it to the side. Lifeless.
“Lincoln Continental Mark V” Castiel corrected, clearing his throat. Meg was going to pay for this.
“Quit your wallowing and tell him he has to go so we can give him the boot.” Bobby’s voice cut through his thoughts. Snapping out of it, like he was on autopilot, Dean stood up and walked out of the room.
He looked around one more time, hearing the distant cries and alarms in the distance, before pulling on the handle. Locked.
If only time travel spells weren’t illegal.
“I-uh, is it ok if I sit here for a moment,” Dean’s voice was muffled by his hands, Castiel nodding despite not being seen.
His stomach chose that moment to let itself be known. Growling loud enough that Castiel heard laughter in response.
“We live in a world full of mystical beings and you don’t believe something could be contained inside a simple vase?” Sam questioned, completely appalled at his brother’s flawed logic.
He was glad he had a day off from his college classes and job to focus more on this game.
"Shh, follow my lead. Keep your forehead on my shoulder and play along." Dean hooked the back of Cas' legs and leaning forward so his forehead was resting on Cas' shoulder.
“It’s ok. You don’t have to do this,” he trailed off, placing his hands in his pockets, ready to start his journey home. Although, he didn’t get far when a hand caught his elbow in a gentle grasp.
Castiel hummed, bringing his hips forward, out of Dean's grasp to turn around and gazing down at the man. One hand reaching behind him to turn the handle of the door.
In all honesty, Castiel has been playing this game for a total of three days. He hasn’t entered the maze, hasn’t looked for a weapon to even start, and he actually was beginning to lose interest.
He pulled out the cards from his pocket and his phone to google map where he was supposed to be exactly.
Just before he walked out of the room, he glanced in the mirror and had to do a double-take. He grabbed the closest jacket before opening the door and leaving.
“To hell with the cliffs and the fog! I've had enough, helmsman. Turn the ship around. We're going back,” Gabriel grabbed him before he could move.
His own dick straining as he watched Dean undo the tie, forcibly tugging it off to toss to the side as he began his work the buttons of his shirt.
The two had agreed that Sam would stay to watch Bobby and the bunker. After helping to set up and checking the current traps, making sure everything was safe and secure.
He sighed under his breath, loud enough for the entire room to hear the agitation in his voice.
It happened in a blink of an eye. But Dean had learned to just react to the tingling in the back of his mind. His body moved before he could comprehend what had happened. Sam had been standing in the middle of the room, ways away, and the next he was a mere inches from him. Dean’s hands were raised, his brother’s wrists held in his own before they could do anything. His hands a bright green color as he watched Sam wince.
Bringing two hands up, Castiel placing them firmly on Mr. Winchester’s chest, giving a hard push until their lips separated and Dean was staring at him in shock.
"Christmas does have a lot to do with love,"
If Castiel hadn’t been regularly attending those yoga classes, this definitely would have felt awkward.
“Fix this,” he said through clenched teeth.
“Another,”
He couldn’t bring his eyes up, opting to sit back on his heels, hands clenched into fists on his thighs. Keeping his gaze downwards, like a good soldier. Accepting his new fate. He failed those he cared about and now he’s going to take the repercussion with his dignity still somewhat intact.
“That’s...not a bad idea,” Castiel stated, loud enough for everyone in the room to hear. He let go, Sam’s body dropping to the stone floor as he gasped for air. “Do something, Dean.” he quoted as he sauntered over to Dean, the small smile on his lips showing one of his pointed fangs. “I mean, a bittersweet end to the royal family. At the hands of their own Crown Prince.” Dean felt his entire body shudder under the man’s intense gaze as he stopped just in front of him. His hand lifting to cup his cheek, instinctually Dean leaned into the caress. “Kill your brother, Dean.”
Some started crying, others stated they wanted revenge on whoever killed their precious prince.
“I’m moving, I’m moving,” Dean muttered out, his body moving at a snail's pace. Castiel smiled, giving the man’s red ass a smack before opening the door to the limo.
“Yes,” Was all he managed, feeling the man’s cock rubbing along the cleft of his ass.
Once the door was closed, he walked down the hallway, not caring about his naked appearance. He found the farther room from his bedroom, closed the door, and let all hell break loose.
"This isn't Starbucks but I'll see what I can do," with the amount of sarcasm in Sam's voice, Dean had to cover his mouth with his free hand in order not to laugh. Once his brother turned around to fetch the order, Rachel, that’s her name Dean remembered, turned and moved closer into his space.
Leaning down, he placed a kiss on those pouting lips, using the distraction to hold one of Dean's hands out to tie it to the bedpost.
Castiel took the drink, downing it in one go.
It wasn’t until he got to the front door, Castiel’s hand keeping it open so he could lock it behind him, as he was grateful that Dean hadn’t seen the bulge that Castiel was sporting from the noises and the beautiful view of the man cumming had done to him.
Cas stared in horror, his eyes adjusting to the little lighting they had from under the door, as he watched Dean fiddle with his belt just before dropping his pants as well.
Was he naked?!
“Dresser,” he said with a sad sigh when the hands disappeared. The sound of a drawer opening, a pause then the sound of some shuffling.
Taking his cue to exit, Castiel grabbed his bag and headed for the bedroom door.
A feeling that spurred when he first laid eyes on the man before him.
That same unsure feeling Dean felt was the same.
“How are classes?” The question was not entirely random as Castiel obliged him, informing him about an upcoming assignment and a term paper due next week. “Eli said you didn’t show up the other day.” He tried not to flinch when Eldon’s finger caressed his cheek, the topic changing quickly. Formalities are now out the window and Castiel wasn’t sure how he was going to deflect whatever it is that Eldon was going to bring up.
He thought it could have been adrenaline, which is where he found himself almost every morning, training on the sword with the royal army. Pushing himself harder with every parry and thrust.
Dean's lips opened slightly, Cas’ thumb brushing along the heat. His breath caught in his throat when the man daringly swiped his tongue along the pad of his finger. His words stuck where they were when Dean closed his lips around the digit, giving it a small suck.
“I-uh...didn’t actually drive,” Castiel confessed, looking down at his feet. He braced for an earful, but he felt really bad when he heard shoes on the pavement as they retreated with the sound of a door opening. The slam of it had Castiel looking up, brows knitted together, realizing there goes another man in his life.
“He looks like a cuddler, has he tried to do that with you?”
He was met with concerned looks and head shakes. Nothing was there. Not to mention this weird anxiousness that had him looking over his shoulder.
The first thing he realized was that he was laying out on a stretcher, standing around him was Bobby, Garth, Sam, and one other person who wore the Medic uniform. A blue shirt with the emblems sewn on with the stethoscope around his neck, wearing gloves that were holding the railing of the stretcher he was on.
“Dean,” Castiel stopped mid-sentence to widen his eyes. “Call me Dean. I’ve told you this before.” A warm feeling ignited somewhere below his stomach, his heart to flutter.
The image of Senator Roan flashed through Dean's mind. The hanging. The body. "Purge" carved into her.
As for Lucifer. Let’s just say, the next time he shows his face, they’ll be prepared.
“Do you trust me?” Dean questioned, staring Castiel in the eye, despite looking at the man upside down.
“H-hold on a second!” The moose of a man called out, racing after his brother, entering Dean’s room to see him at his dresser, pulling on a white cotton shirt and brown trousers before walking to the corner to pick up his satchel.
Castiel thought as he opened his bag that was next to Dean to pull out the lube and black latex gloves.
Castiel made an “oh” face, shaking head for temporarily forgetting that they opened at 5 am to serve breakfast.
It’s a lie. He wasn’t straight. His father is dead, he doesn’t need to put up with this facade any longer. A knot tightened in his stomach at the mental declaration, the man is dead. There’s no way he can just resurrect himself from the dead, there's no such thing as the supernatural.
His nose crinkling at the thought of the last man, the one who gave him the card with an A. He wouldn’t give him the time of day. He looked like he was rolling around in the streets for a while with the way he was dressed and smelled. Some kind of rotten egg smell.
“Hold your tongue,” John bit out, eyes narrowing towards his oldest son.
“F-Fuck,” Castiel moaned out, keeping one hand grabbing the man’s shoulder as the other wrapped around his own need, leaking with precum as he moved his hand to match the speed of the thrusts.
Dean stared at the spot the man had once occupied to the door when bell jingled at his exit.
Castiel looked around the path, trying to find the right colors. The words Dean spoke within the first couple of days being here floating through his mind. picking flowers at the same time. Dean was nowhere to be seen, even though he knew where the man was exactly.
“C-Cas...I’m sorry-” he was silenced when Castiel raised a hand to silence him. Taking deep breaths to calm himself. Looking around the room, his eyes settling on the two servants standing by the kitchen door on the other side of the room, down a ways from them. Seemingly unaware of what was going on, their gazes unwavering as they stared into space. Acting like they were not even there. As they were trained to be.
“I’m seeing pretty clearly on my end.” He spoke nonchalantly. Dean could feel the anger slowly broil beneath his skin at his predicament. But he wasn’t going to let that show, instead, he shrugged his shoulders as best as he could in his position. It was a slight movement but Sam noticed, his brow furrowing at the remark.
“There’s more of you,” Why was he even asking.
"Well these dunderheads must really want him back," Bobby uttered, walking over to the computer to press a few buttons. The screen changed to the cameras outside, a group of seven people stood by the entrance. Waiting.
“What the hell?” ducking out of the way as one randomly decided to fly at him.
Dean continued.
Biting his tongue, he turned to leave but the sounds coming from the library caught his attention.
“Exactly,” Bobby agreed, “I like this guy. Probably the only Medic I’ve seen that knows anything about the MMA.” Giving Dean’s leg a quick pat, he looked towards Garth. “Anyways, we’re gonna grab our stuff from the locker room,” and with that, they left, leaving Sam, the Medic, and Dean.
Pushing the comforter off, he realized that he wasn’t wearing any clothes. He debated on whether or not he should just stay there till someone showed up.
The others didn’t laugh.
Dean hadn't realized he'd closed his eyes as he swirled his tongue around the slit or when he felt a hand on the back of his head.
Dean screamed in his head as his heart started to pound in his chest when one man stepped forward.
An hour later found the two sitting at a quaint little breakfast spot, the breeze was blowing like crazy that fine morning. Luckily the place was indoors.
“The dragon is no more,” Dean’s voice said sternly, his fiance turning back to him. “Take me home, Michael. I don't want to go back,” while putting as much conviction into his voice, leaning forward to rest his head on Michael’s shoulder.
“Good, how do you feel, boy?” Bobby’s voice cut through Dean’s gaze, turning sluggishly towards the man.
“The dragon will get nothing!"
Fuck composure. As long as Dean has known this man, his moods can change at the drop of a hat and right now, this isn’t good. Castiel Novak did not become the top Boss of the Mafia empire through sheer luck or kneeling before anyone. No, this man has the ruthlessness of the legend Lucky Luciano. But he was smarter and was able to outmaneuver all the players on the field.
“This must be some kind of kill the minotaur in order to escape,” he mumbled to himself. But then again, there was nothing mentioned about what was in the maze from what he’s read.
He felt Dean let his cock free to replace his hands-on Castiel’s hips as he slowly pulled out and pushed just as slow back in.
Watching carefully, Castiel watched what were lust blown eyes turning hard as the man gripped the blankets to cover him, yelling for him to “Get the hell out!!”
The guy, damn it, looked so sad. But there was an understanding that flickered through his eyes.
“Do you like him?”
"Castiel, I didn't know I would…"
“You’ve never been interested enough to pick up a book, Dean,” The long-haired brother stated as he took up his spot across from the man in question.
Castiel thought to himself. Remembering the rules set by his company.
Rubbing at his forehead trying to disperse the pain he was feeling, the pounding behind his eyes as he shuffled through the castle to ease his restlessness.
So that’s where Castiel finds himself, sitting in Dean’s car. Which was now parked outside his apartment complex.
"I-well-I wanted to know what other services do you…" letting the question hang as Dean's eyes drifted towards Castiel crotch.
He blew into the Ocarina, his fingers slowly moving to the notes, his eyes closing as he fought with all his might.
“Yes, I know because I’m a cop,”
He can’t do it.
The man uncrossed his arms to fix the trenchcoat, looking down and examining himself all the way up to his fingernails.
“Hey, I know this is completely off topic...but I-uh..brought the impala.” Castiel looked up, not saying a word. His entire body filling with an emotion he hadn’t felt in a really long time. Was it love?
(See the end of the chapter for
He'd been secretly crushing on this guy since the first day they met. Sure that's a loaded statement, considering he's been using the Professional Stretchers shortly after he decided to open himself up to male clients.
“Oh, that’s a shame. I’m a delight at parties.” Eldon quipped back, grabbing at Castiel’s chin to make eye contact with him. “The deal still stands. I won’t kill my beloved plaything in exchange for you to leave this territory and never look back.”
Dean smiled, chuckled a little before turning around to walk back to the box.
“Cas,” Dean called out, eyes scanning the apartment for his elusive boyfriend. It’s been two hours and there hasn't been a peep from the man.
Maybe Sam was going to compensate for the slack? Which is why he’d be his advisor and confidant? Or what if he becomes mad and Sam was to take over from the start?
Being able to tell when a person was hitting on him was a relief. He was able to turn them down when he didn’t feel the same. He was always too oblivious when someone was flirting. But when he felt equally attracted to the person, it made moments like this hard.
He doesn't know how or why, but why look a gift horse in the mouth, when Dean was able to take out the remaining three demons.
Smiling sheepishly while holding his stomach, Dean laughed and escorted him to the nearest stand.
“You mad at someone, Clarence?” Meg remarked, noticing the annoyed look on her friend’s face.
“And if it's crossed, I can not be your therapist anymore,” Castiel stated, squashing the feeling in his stomach and focusing his mind elsewhere to prevent the blood flow from running south. He pulled his hand free, stepping back and turning so that he was facing the man.
Castiel's only response was dropping to his knees in front of the man, a small smile on his face when Dean wouldn't meet his eyes.
“What were you thinking just then?” the question hanging in the air, Dean glancing at Castiel then back at his hands.
"How so," Dean asked, stopping to look back, both hands buried deep in his coat pocket.
Shuddering through the strokes, his body convulsing as it released all the tension in his body.
The banging on the door calmed eventually, allowing the four to release the anxious breath they’d been holding it the entire time.
Dean smiled to himself, they had stayed in this position since Castiel had dropped him on the altar. The man had changed back into a human not to long ago. His head on his lap with his arms wrapped around Dean’s body.
Taking the opportunity to swing his legs around to quickly scale down the vines below his window. He heard his name shouted above, but it would be too late. Dean has snuck down these plants too many times to know what ones were thicker and sturdier to grab than the rest.
And this was the smallest one Castiel had.
“What is he doing, Michael?” Gabriel questioned after catching the man in time before he hit the ground. All eyes turned to Dean who was now looking towards the sky.
“Did you betray me?”
“But did you know, that with those in Africa-”
He thanked the barista, a cute girl with chestnut color hair swept up into a ponytail and chocolate brown eyes. Fair skin and a dazzling smile, he gave her a wink before turning away.
“Yes,” Dean replied, staring into those blue eyes.
“I-I guess he’s right,” the girl spoke first, the guy’s attention downcasted to the floor.
If you do no care for it, you can skip the rest of the chapter when you see:
The guy looked around in annoyance while the fourth, mysterious man stayed where he was.
He. Was. Being. Kissed.
Dean continued kissing, licking and the occasional sucking on Cas' neck.
“Well darling, it’ll become quite clear here soon. Please,” She gestured for him to hand the cards over, which he did. With the cards in hand, she placed them on the table in a neat stack.
Abaddon and Azazel were more than happy to oblige, coming back successful every time.
He wouldn’t do it for this man, even on the day of his funeral, he refused. His attention fell to the small card in his hand, a picture of the bastard at the top, a kind smile in place of his usual scowl, with a small description of his life and accomplishments.
"This is a bit strange," Castiel remarked, stopping to taking in the display. Noticing a Deer and Stag off to the side, noses touching in a kiss.
“Cas! We’re gonna be late!” Dean shouted up the stairs as he checked his watch for the 6th time that evening. He managed to get off work early so that he could shower and get ready in a timely manner.
She placed her hand on top, closing her eyes, muttering something under her breath before removing her hand. Picking one card up, Dean gasped when the card was no longer black but Yellow.
“I can teach you,” Castiel said, smirking over his cup of tea Dean had made him. He was starting to enjoy this pampering.
Dean stared at him as he slowly loaded the chamber with a single bullet before spinning it, snapping it shut. The man before him gazed down at the revolver, a sigh escaping his lips, elbow resting lazily on the armrest while lifting the gun aiming the barrel directly at Dean's chest. His eyes didn't rise, instead, he kept them down as he used his other hand to scratch at the gruff of his neck.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel questioned, turning his head to hear better.
“No,” it was simple and came so easily as Dean held the man’s face with two hands. “I’m not losing you again,”
Of course, Cas yelped a moment later when he felt a smack on his ass, followed by Dean calling out ‘Now that’s what I call Customer Service’ on his way to the bathroom, whistling a random tune as he went to clean up.
Bobbing his head, taking more and more, Dean reached for Cas’ hole. A little surprised when he felt something slick and wet when his finger brushed lightly at it, easily slipping his finger in all the way to the knuckle. Eliciting another deep moan from the man. Adding two then three, the tightness making his already hard cock strain upwards at attention.
"If you'd like to know more…" Castiel trailed off as pushed the door open, stepping out of his pants, and walking back into the room, watching a very rumpled Mr. Winchester stare at him in awe.
"You call us "dragons", but we call ourselves "those born from ash"," Dean turned at the sound of man's voice getting closer, his demeanor cold and impassive. He tossed something onto the slab, Dean turning to see something that resembled a doll, set on fire.
The small cafe was bustling for a Friday evening, Dean was lucky to have found a spot to himself where he had some relative peace and quiet. He looked up towards the night sky, taking in the crescent moon and surrounding stars.
Dean was so caught up in the pleasure wrecking throughout his body that he didn't hear the uncapping sound of lube or both hands disappearing from his ass.
He lost track of how many times he wandered around the junkyard, making sure the area was secured. So far no one has set foot in the area, if that had happened, Bobby would have called over the walkie to alert him of anything.
Castiel's gripped the bed covers tightly, panting after each thrust.
“Fine,” he complained, slowly righting himself up. Pain radiating from his ass.
He knew Cas was good. Probably the best. But to be booked up to 2 months in advance, that's just downright insane. Who has dates that far in advance for Ass Stretching?!
He pulled his hand away from his neck to straighten his outfit, looking down at the attire that had been picked out for him.
Dean really can't imagine anything better than this, including heaven. How could anyone think that somewhere else is better than right now, in this room, with the person they love?
He found the job rather quickly, practically overqualified for such a small town. Quoted Crowley, the owner. He was welcomed with open arms nonetheless.
Castiel grew up in this lifestyle. Rather be in embarrassed, he takes pride.
He turned back around to face the open street and walkway, contemplating what to do. That's when Sam’s words echoed in the back of his head about who this guy was. Internally rolling his eyes at the bitch face he imagined his brother giving him if Dean returned stating the doors were locked and nobody was home. He walked down the steps to head around the building.
“You don’t mind, do you,” He was about to answer, having suddenly become distracted by the sound of the cap opening and the dildo being placed near his hole.
Castiel stepped out onto the ledge, the rain falling heavy, staring into the darkness. He didn’t want anyone to live in fear. He clutched the Ocarina to his chest.
“So the Pizza Man finally delivered,” she murmured when he turned she had a knowing smile on her face.
“Why don’t let me decide. But first, tell me what happened after that night. You were so happy and then you vanished,”
He glanced down at his watch, eight-fifteen.
“Enough,” came the cool words of the third, the one sitting at the edge of the fire with the fourth person who hadn’t yet spoken.
There will, more than likely, a continuation of this story so hit the subscribe on my profile to be notified 😉😉
“That was some spell,” the familiar voice of Meg spoke as she gave his back a few pats. “It threw Castiel into quite a rage.”
“Would you like my assistance?” Castiel asked, a little taken aback at the situation. He’s been assisting Dean for the past year and a half and never has this happened with him before. Generally, it’s been casual, simple and downright friendly.
Castiel’s only response was to slam his hands on the table, the noise was loud enough to stop the small talk surrounding the shop, all eyes and attention turning towards him. On top of the anger, Castiel felt his face flush at his loss of control.
“What I do is not to be taken lightly. One slip up could mean serious repercussions for either of us,” Castiel could feel the possible anxiety building if what they were doing falls flat and they are both met with serious problems.
From when Dean had grabbed the guy till now, he didn’t get a good look at him. He had dragged the guy in, slammed the door shut and when he had turned around to say something, Bobby and Sam were running down the hall towards them. Bobby had snapped at Dean, outright ordering him to put this guy in a room before dragging his happy ass to the main room.
The words Dean said playing through his mind. It was clear as day. He was blinded by this man, thinking there was something that could possibly happen between them.
Looking back, Castiel couldn’t blame himself for leaning forward, closing the gap between them.
"Are-are you-I mean-I didn't-"
"I will ask this, whose cheerios did you piss in to get that many people after you?"
Sitting up in his chair he turned it to get to his file cabinet, opening the door to reveal the many cases he’s currently working on.
That and none of them wanted to deal with an Alpha whose mate was in peril.
They talked far longer than either intended, the sun having gone down quite some time ago. Wine changed into Ale when a servant brought them a tray of meat and cheeses to snack on.
He shifted irritably in them before walking through the doors, his guard staying at the door opting to watch from afar. Nodding a greeting to his parents at the end of the table just as Dean sat at his spot beside them on the right.
"I couldn't have done otherwise." Michael murmured, leaning closer.
When they made it to the front, Dean reached into his coat pocket to pull out a set of tickets, handing it over to the girl dressed in an elf costume.
Alas-what?...Lilith and Michael? What the hell?
Inais’ apologetic voice answered.
"Toy's don't count,"
“All I’m saying,” she started, both hands up to show no means of harm or any transgressions. “Now that he is here, it should be taking the edge off,”
He was surprised it took him a while to figure it out but a familiar mop of black hair and wild blue eyes was absent. Shifting in his seat, he took a moment to realize that out of all the times he’d been coming, about three months now after discovering the place, this was the first time Castiel hadn’t been here.
Castiel didn’t respond. He couldn’t say anything as he tried not to look down at the man whose gaze was solely focused on him. He could feel those eyes like a weight in his gut as he tried to squash those hopeful thoughts of his.
“Do you?” Castiel tutted, disbelief in his voice.
The screen changed to a small room, a pixelated figure standing in the middle.
“My memories,” Dean struggled out, feeling the clutches of unconsciousness creeping in. “are private,” he managed out before his world went black.
He could swear some of the maidens and male servants had pointed ears, like the two thieves in the woods.
“Impala,”
Castiel stepped around Dean to stand behind him, his hands on Dean’s shoulders as the man kissed at his neck.
He clicked yes.
“There was this guy,” he finally said. “It happened once...but we-uh-switched positions,” Dean’s eyes rolled when he was met with a raised brow. “As in… I was on the receiving end,”
He felt the cold presence on his hip, he nearly jumped, especially when he felt something solid press against his back.
“Well, what did you have in mind for today?” At that, Dean pulled out a bunch of cassettes tapes with a colorful cover of bells and cheer.
Then it was quiet. Meg isn’t usually the type to stay that way for long, but if Castiel could keep his eyes focused away from her face maybe she won’t say anything. There’s something in the air that just smells like she has a comment coming and he isn’t sure he wants to know what that’s going to be.
“Don’t say it,” he murmured out after a beat of silence. She smiled knowingly.
“Now dish,” she commanded after placing her wand away, leaning forward to listen to all the gooey details.
“You poor sheltered boy,” before turning the handle, opening the door and walking out.
Well, as much as he can be. Castiel still hasn’t been able to get the meter to change with any of his suggestions thus far.
Despite all of this, the man was a fake. Dean will never forgive his father for the things he put Dean through. The most prominent memory, something Dean wished he could lock away forever still appeared to terrorize him at night in his dreams. Innocent brown eyes begging Dean to help him. Declaring he would leave and never contact Dean again if he could walk away with his life.
“Shut up!” Dean spat back as he attempted to lift his brother off of him, struggling against the weight. But it was no use, the man was taller and despite his size, trained just alongside Dean while growing up.
“My love,” he whispered. “We only just began to get reacquainted,” irritation clear as he began to stand. He looked in the direction of the cavalry, waving his hand in Dean’s direction.
Castiel felt his cheeks heat up, surely he was completely red at that remark, unintentionally burying his face into this creep’s neck. What he would give to just melt away or suddenly disappear right now. How had this happened? How did it all come to this? Eldon chuckled at the display, bringing his free hand back up to cup Castiel’s hair like he was comforting for embarrassing him intentionally.
“I’m sorry, I missed that entirely,”
Castiel chuckled, that's when Dean realized they were still talking in the doorway. He opened the door wider to let the man in, taking in his appearance.
There’s something else about the guy.
“Are you looking for a room?” she inquired.
“Dean…” His arms raised, showing his hands, palm out, indicating he wasn't going to harm Dean. More like he was trying to bring Dean back to safety.
is making it feel really good.
Sam had managed to coerce his Dean into his room, listening to ramblings of his brother about how unfair this whole situation was.
“So what are you going to do to me?”
“Ya Idjits ready for the prom?” Bobby called out, rounding the corner with a beer in hand. Checking his watch again, he sighed when it read four minutes to seven.
Castiel looked over with a raised brow.
“Now I understand what it's like to be away from the one you love. You were against our wedding, I remember,” The argument, despite how long ago, played in his mind as if it were yesterday. They had gotten into a fight about how this marriage was a joke. Originally Sam was supposed to marry Michael, but Dean wouldn’t let Sam do it. Sam was dating someone. Dean just doesn't know who it was, but he was pretty sure that his parents would disapprove of it.
“Sam was right: you're nothing like your grandfather. You don't even know his secret,”
“Later,” Castiel dismissed with a wave of his hand, turning his attention back to Rowena.
A chuckle from the other had them opening one eye to peer up at them.
“Now now, you know this is just a facade,” Castiel informed the man for the hundredth time, a marriage to make his family happy.
Dean shook his head, hoping to rid the thoughts echoing in his mind about
"Cas," Dean whispered, his movements stopping, his head moving back to look at Cas in the dim light, "We're gonna get caught if you don't-"
“Condoms?” He asked a moment later, Castiel almost missing it from the pleasure of those strong fingers pumping his dick and the fingers pushing deep within him.
Whipping his face clean with the supplied handkerchief, he looked down at his subjects in irritation.
They stayed like that for who knows how long, both panting, trying to regain themselves while coming down from their high.
Castiel remembered when he first met his Mate, all those centuries ago. He already had a vast knowledge of his powers and full control over them.
“Please, they’re going to kill me!”
A knock broke his train of thought, calling out that the door was open.
Hissing under his breath at the smack to his ass, moaning from the tongue, the only relief he got was when Dean pulled away, the feel of the head of his cock poking at his entrance less than a second later.
Possibly his friend Charlie, but no one else.
Dean bit his lip, muffling a cry as he came all over Castiel’s hand and comforter, his body shuddering through his orgasm.
“Glad to have you back, Cas. But not to rush things, we need to get out of here before Lucifer comes back.” Nodding in agreement, Dean made sure Cas could walk before they made there was down the aisle of pews to the front door.
‘A maze?’ clicking the yes, another window showed up.
based on the song "Scotty doesn't know"
"Are you feeling drowsy? How many fingers am I holding up?" Dean asked while waving three digits in front of Sam.
“How's that?” Dean stated in disbelief as he pulled off the top part of his robes to clean the wound there. “How can you forget your own name?”
"Ok, fuck it," Dean leaned forward, his hand coming up to move Cas' head to his shoulder before replacing his hand under Cas' knee.
Shuddering at the thought, he crept in, past the room with all the robes and churchly items. He found another door, which upon opening it, lead into the room with the altar and pews.
Everyone dug into their meals, a broth with meat and a slice of bread. Paired with a cup of wine. Dean wasn’t much of a wine drinker, ale being the better of the two because there was nothing else to drink.
He hesitated, thumb over the button. He hit yes.
“Cas,” he called out, when the man’s body collapsed on the bed, chest heaving in exhaustion. Dean was about to call his name out again but was cut short when the body jolted up, hissing with its eyes glowing blue.
"Hold him still," Juac told Boris, feeling the man's burly hands grab Dean's upper arms, keeping them tight to his body.
Without another word, Dean left her so as to begin making his way up the stairs to the large double doors. One of the doors had been knocked clean off its hinges while the other was barely hanging on. Inside, the scene was much the same as it was outside. Bodies of the soldiers were thrown about, littering the entrance hall as he continued through the massacre to the next set of stairs. He could hear the distant groaning from some that had somehow survived as he began ascending the steps to the second floor.
“Clarence,” she spoke after the long silence, dismissing the underlings. “He’ll come around,” while keeping her distance from the man.
Honestly, they just met just after his father's funeral and this girl was moving things along quicker than Dean wanted and that was saying something. Before, he loved fast and frisky women, but now, it didn't feel the same.
Every attempt that failed, he groaned but gave himself a pat on the back when he saw the smoke float up.
It must’ve been the way she said, he would tell himself later after he looked up. Accidentally making eye contact. The smirk on her face was enough for him to know he was caught now and wasn’t about to let go.
B. He really had no filter when he meets insanely hot-looking people.
“But I’ll admit, you are much smarter than I am,” Dean turned and perched himself to sit on the ledge, taking in his brother’s suspicious look. “You always beat me in chess and other book smart stuff.”
“And he’s used to fighting bigger and tough guys than you.” Bobby disrupted Dean, who huffed like a child who didn’t get his way.
He was by the man in an instant, lacing his fingers with the outstretched hand. What he wasn’t expecting was to be pulled down, lips on his in a sloppy kiss. Body pressed greedily into his.
His Father gave him a long lecture about walking out of such an important meeting and how a king, no matter what ales him, must sit and listen to the entire conversation.
“Really think this through. Who do you work for?” Dean’s gaze drops from Cas, his mind racing while trying to come up with the correct response. He looks back to meet Cas’ gaze, a smile on his face with his head tilted to the side.
“Do you...would you like to come up for a nightcap?” Castiel asked, figuring it would be something nice to do for someone after they drove you home.
He zoned back into the conversation when his name was called, catching the tail end of Bobby’s story about how the creature of dark magic was imprisoned inside a vase. Trapped. Locked away and looked after by the Winchester line.
He saw the oars resting within the boat with provisions in a basket.
Hit hit ‘No’ just as Gabriel walked through the doorway of his room.
"But you love that place," she tried, glancing at Sam and moving her hand away. "We haven’t gone to the club since we met."
Screaming erupted from the crowd as the beasts' powerful wings sent everything scattering around.
“Are you here all by yourself?” the bartender questioned as he poured the contents of the bottle into the glass before replacing it back under the bar.
“A Vampire?” Dean spoke under his breath, trying to search his mind for any knowledge of such a creature. Everything he was told about was fairies, ogres, nymphs, etc. A demon here and there but nothing mentioned Vampires.
The sudden question caught him off guard, enough so that when he went to grab his cup, he missed and ended up knocking it over and onto his lap.
The quiet between the two settled for all of five minutes.
"What have you done?" Castiel question, all manner of professionalism out the window as he tried to figure out what happened. He was in the middle of a session with a patient when the alarms went off. The lights shut off, the sound of gunfire, after that, he was hit over the head.
“Klutz,” Inias mumbled under his breath. By the tone in his voice, he didn’t believe it, but Castiel shrugged it off as his friend placed an order in front of him. “Your handsome friend is in his usual spot.” Glaring and commenting that Dean wasn’t a friend, he grabbed the cup and made his way to the back booth.
He had brought a hand to touch his forehead, pulling it away to see blood when his name was called out again. Looking up, he saw in time to see the creature coming straight at him again, its claws primed and ready.
“Its blood play,” Castiel input without thinking. “People mistake it for breath play.”
This is sad! Please be aware
He needed to hear it again.
Looking at his screen, the phone was locked but the notification still showed despite him turning those off because he woke up with multiple notifications saying “
After being sworn into office, his first act was to decree the end of the purge.
“Is he bigger by length or girth?” Castiel questioned, staring at what he had.
The buzzing under his skin seems to have settled down after that crazy morning. That cold, ghostly sensation...but after that moment, he felt much better. Energized if anything.
This chant...why are they singing this chant? He looked around when he noticed everyone in the village had stopped their celebrating.
He knew Rowena told him to stay away. That forcing Dean’s old self to come back too quickly could ruin everything he’s waited centuries for.
Nodding his head even though no one was there to see it, he dragged the unconscious body under a tarp, pulling the flap over the hiding spot before making his way back to the entrance of the bunker.
Removing the gloves, turning them inside out, he walked into the attached bathroom to dispose of them into the trash. When he walked out, Dean was completely stretched out flat on his bed, his head buried into his pillow.
She smiled, her painted lips and dramatic makeup giving her a wicked look as she brought her hand up to her chin to think about it.
"I am a freak...I can't ever live like a human."
They eventually came to an agreement, each of them thanking him before leaving.
Cas groaned again, his eyes squinting through the obvious pain in his face, to Dean. Eyes widening, he looked around.
And just like that, Dean snapped back to reality. Leaping up and taking a step back, he took in the man before him from the light being let in from the open curtains.
Dean had to hold in the chuckle at the disarray that was Sam’s hair. His normal straight brown locks that were always pulled back into a low ponytail. Now it was a mess, sticking up in random places.
Her brown held up with an ornate pin, bangs framing her red eyes and tanned skin. Ears pointed like the blonde beside her.
“Cas-,” the worlds full of lust, watching the man writhe under the blankets in need. Castiel had to take deep breaths in to calm the blood rushing south.
He felt the gooseflesh raised along his body as the temperature in the room dropped, Dean, shivering before it was suddenly gone.
He decided.
**Updated 02/15/2020**
Dean looked over his expression blank. He was silent, which meant Dean didn’t know how to respond.
"Who was that?" Castiel's attempt at distracting the man. He received a hum in response. "That new voice. It wasn't you or Michael...I've never heard it before," The grip disappeared, so did the presence of the man beside him.
“He’s shy,” Meg mused, patting his shoulder before shifting in her seat to sit properly.
The voice was deep, like gravel roads as it whispered words into his ear, his body shuttering as it remembered.
“When did you realize you liked the guy?”
“Sure we can,” Dean muttered as he kissed the happy trail before him, nuzzling the hairs with his nose as he began to unzip Cas’ pants.
Standing there was a man, all disheveled looking and out of breath.
Castiel groaned low in his throat when he came to. His eyes still closed as his head throbbed in pain. The musty smell wasn't helping, especially since his face was squished into it. He tried not to gag at the wet smell, creaking one of his eyes open. His heart sinking at seeing nothing but darkness. Shifting his head, he realized he was blindfolded. Before he could do anything, he heard a noise off to the left of him.
Shrugging his shoulders, he walked into the dining hall with his head held high and a cocky smile on his face when he winked at his brother’s over dramatic eye roll.
Dean cocked his head in confusion.
All the cookies and gingerbread were neatly arranged amongst all the sugary candies and icing.
“I ran into Gabriel the other day,”
“If we end up eating as we go, we don’t have to worry about dessert,” Dean joked as he plopped back down next to Castiel.
Just managing to grip the weapon in his hand when he felt hands on his ankles, pulling him out from his hideout. In the fray, Dean turned and stabbed at the attacker.
“THE PRINCE IS DEAD!” The voice shouted into the tavern, alerting it’s occupants to his presence.
Overall, that wasn’t even the craziest thing that happened to him.
“Dean, so nice of you to join me.” Eldon started, false happiness in his voice. “Have you met my
He was sitting in his car, he was just about to start the engine when the vibration alerted him.
“Do you love me?” Dean said out of nowhere.
Needless to say, he didn’t want someone walking in after the act while they were still naked.
"Oh," Dean mumbled after taking a step back, only for his body to start wobbling back and forth. "It seems your magnetic pull is keeping me here. This only happens if you find me at least a bit attractive,"
“Do you need anything?” Dean’s voice whispered, a hand reaching out to caress the side of his face.
“When there’s a truly wicked soul causing havoc on mankind they pounce on the opportunity to rip that person to...shreds” a small chuckle, the air tickling his ear.
Swallowing the lump in his throat at the way the man looked down at him with hooded eyes, their bodies a mere inches from one another.
some good. Being cooped up in the library is turning you into a hermit. Maybe we can find you a nice girl to bring back here and release some of that tension,”
"He is of no concern to you,"
What really piqued his interest was during the meals with his family. Something was going on between his Mother and Sam that had him completely unsure of everything in his life.
Whenever he would visit Dean, the man would become vicious and attempt to attack him.
But alas, having all this money and anything he wanted, one thing is for sure, a man can get lonely.
“Lovely, isn’t it?” a low and daunting voice called out from behind him. Dean went to turn towards the source, stopped only when he felt arms wrap around his midsection.
That and the softest bed in the world he was sitting on.
“I hope you didn’t lose the ring,” Castiel remarked, fixing his own tie.
“I’m not fond of survival games,” Sam’s voice cut in during their momentary pause. Castiel looked over at him, a little surprised he spoke.
Sighing into the air, adjusting the blankets tighter around himself. The rain continued its downpour as he tried to get back to sleep. Blaming the weird incident on his high sex drive lately.
He waited patiently in line, his men outside in the SUV, ready to take him to his next appointment.
“Why did you leave the pit? I told you not to! That's what he's waiting for.” That when something clicked. When Dean escaped, the area didn’t look like where he was. Which could only mean one thing...
“Dean, you’re up!” Bobby’s voice called out from the doorway, disrupting any further conversation between the two. The brothers stood. Dean placing his mouthpiece in as they walked out and down the hall to the entrance of the arena. Bobby and Garth were already there waiting for him.
He pushed the two fingers in, all the way to his knuckles, keeping them there to allow Dean to adjust.
he thought to himself, watching the man from the corner of his eye as he watched the front door as patrons come and go.
to this,”
“Yeah, any moment now.” He pulled out his phone to check. No message. As always.
“Now right,” And so on til Dean grabbed Cas to halt him, grabbing the closest door. Pushing Cas in, Dean followed suit after looking around.
Sam sat opposite of him as the girl slid in, flush against Dean's side as his hand instinctively wrapped around her shoulder.
“Nope,” the mischief was back, her smirk ever-present as she rested her chin lightly on the back of her hand.
Dean smirked. 'Boris' had his hand on Dean's shoulder as ‘Juac’, the first man who had been leaning against the tree, got up to walk over towards him while pulling rope from his bag.
“Please,” Dean’s voice pleaded. “I know,” he struggled to continue, his voice sounding desperate. “That’s there’s a line that can not be crossed,”
Hearing the hum of satisfaction once the plug was all the way in, Dean yelped when those hands gripped his body to manhandle in to lay long ways on the couch.
The occupants burst into panic, turning to one another to speak about the tragedy.
And Dean did.
He shook his head while raising his coffee to his lips, opting to sit outside in the cool morning air. Waiting for time to fly until he had to go in for work at nine. Glancing down at his watch, internally groaning that it was only after seven.
Dean looked over, his gaze gentle and setting a weird sensation in Castiel’s gut, before standing and reaching for his cup.
There are few and far moments when Cas was the one taking forever to get ready.
“Dean, listen to me. He’s going to kill us, your family-”
Dean breathed out, unwilling to answer this creature.
Despite his eyes adjusting to the darkness, he could only make out a dresser and a chair sitting next to the bed.
“You’re spinning your dick for your own amusement.”
Like a good servant, he doesn't say anything. He still brings Dean his coffee in the morning and lays out his outfits in the morning.
Moaning at the feeling of the tongue pushing as far as possible, Dean let his head drop past his arms, letting out a string of moans and curses at how amazing it felt.
“Tell you later,” Dean interrupted, pulling the man down a hallway full of doors.
“We need to leave,” Castiel ordered quickly as he turned to grab his own clothes, putting on his pants just as quickly, he was buttoning his shirt when he realized Dean wasn’t doing anything. “Dean, come on. We can’t stay here.”
The bitter cold of the North that threatens the livelihood of everyone.
“Yes, about an hour ago. I’m all clean, took a shower and everything,” Nodding his head, Castiel walked over to the bed to place his black bag on it.
" the voice said, small and pathetic sounding. "
"Enough! Tomorrow at sunrise you'll get into the boat and hoist the sail. The east wind will take you to the open sea, where the ships sail." His words were final, letting his arm go limp by his side as he turned around.
He watched Cas make his way back to the desk, putting his jacket back on and fixing his tie once again before turning around to give Dean a small smile.
“Since when have you been interested in our family history?” Sam questioned moments before slamming a stack of books next to his brother who jumped at the sight of all the information his brother brought.
"Shut up," the voice replied, low and rough. Dangerous.
"Oh, don't start-"
Now the girl, or in this case lady, he wasn’t overly sure of the age. She looked mature but acted like a teenager. That did not bode well for Dean. He may like them young, curvy and busty, but he draws the line at 21 and under.
Shaking his head, he tried to clear his mind.
“Don’t ‘but’ me boy. I promised John I wouldn’t let nothing happen to you boys and that means keeping strangers from entering the bunker during the Goddamn Purge!” At that Dean had to tear his eyes away from Bobby’s, feeling like a complete fuck up because he knew the rules.
He heard screams around him, peeking behind him, he gaped in horror as he watched the men on the ground being contorted into weird positions, their gasps and screams sending a cold chill through his body.
But the first couple of guys who helped him, one had been a real asshole. Another, geez, it was his first day! Don't get him started on the one was hitting on him right in the middle of prepping, went to touch Dean without his permission. His excuse was that he thought Dean would have been 'ok' with it.
It's just a persona then
“P-please,” the man managed out, completely out of character for Dean.
With one hand stroking the man, the other continued its exploration. Past the lightly toned stomach to the erect nipples, pinching one between his fingers.
But of course, Dean wouldn’t know anything.
Lifting his head, piqued by the news.
,” Dean replied with his arms wide open, exaggerating the audacity.
“Dean, this can’t happen,” Castiel managed to say after reining himself in, glad he was able to at least keep his voice firm.
“Nope,” Dean waving his hands to interrupt the guy. “I don't want to know your name, your age or anything about you.”
His body reacting before his mind when he found himself standing at his door, the scent of his mate stronger.
“He’s manipulating you, Dean!” Sam’s voice echoed through the throne room. Looking around, Dean realized that dust should have cleared by now. Sam must have done something to create the smokescreen.
Having gotten to know him well enough to allow himself to be called "Cas", he decided to walk over and ask if everything was alright.
In the back of Dean's mind, just as he was asked for his order, he was glad to have given that tip to someone who needed it. Some kids aren't like his brother, the ones who are better supported. Of course, Dean doesn't know the kids' situation, he could have given some rich kid some free money. Who knows.
“Hey Sammy,” Dean called out, wiggling his hips around to further embarrass his brother before the door could shut all the way.
“I don’t know. At first, I thought I strapped to a freaking comet, the next I'm winning the election. As if nothing ever happened.”
Peeking his eye open to stare at the way to chipper of a man before him, his green eyes alight with mischief for it being way too early in the morning.
The kid relaxed, only slightly, as one hand tucked itself into the same pocket where the cash was while the other waved goodbye, thanking Dean before turning and walking away.
Happy because he finally got the amazingly good looking Professional Stretcher to jerk him off.
I had art Commissioned from the Amazing "The Friendly Pigeon" from Tumblr!
The high canopy of the trees allowed minimal lighting as he slowed his horse to a trot as they maneuvered through the thick forest. Not a sound could be heard, which meant the thieves must have come this way. The nocturnal creatures were quiet, which meant something or someone had to have come through.
"What do you want to do first," Dean asked, pulling Castiel from starring around them. "We can get something to eat or walk the path first then come back and eat?"
He also told her to blacklist that client, explaining in detail what the man had done.
A hot bath will get rid of this irritation, he told himself. The hand clutching his neck as he slowly made his way to the tub in the next room. It took him a few tries to light the fire with the flint and iron.
“Easy girl,” he whispered to her, patting her neck.
The dreams were of a man, the same one from the start. His body was tan, toned, and felt strong beneath his hands.
“No wonder I was able to slip in three fingers in so easily,” He heard Dean say, breaking the silence. Castiel felt something touch his back, his heart jumping at the realization.
Another guard ran by, disrupting the moment, bringing him back to the problem at hand. There was only one way to figure out what was going on. Walking back into his room to grab his robe, he made his way to the throne room.
Cas stared at him.
the amusement in the man’s tone as it trailed off, Dean could feel his face heating in embarrassment.
The crowd cheered as Dean’s boat was fully in view of the village after being pushed out into the lake.
He pounded into Dean, his head falling back as he got lost in the warmth surrounding his dick. With the added pants and moans of the man below were an added bonus to this surreal moment.
‘What the hell?’
His beloved had finally woken up, teased him, and insisted he knew nothing about where or who Castiel was.
“Dean,” he felt a hand on his cheek after what felt like an eternity, the cool touch snapping him from the pain, abruptly dispersing it when he opened his eyes to find familiar blues looking at him in concern.
Covered in blood and huffing from the exertion, he turned towards Lucifer, who wore a cocky smile bringing his fingers up, ready to snap.
"Let's talk about the elephant in the room," Dean looked up. Cas or Lucifer wasn't looking at him. Instead, he was looking at the people who brought him up.
“Stop it, Dean! That thing has poisoned your mind.”
Keeping his two fingers still deep in Dean, his other hand reached into his bag, digging around until his hand felt the cool touch of steel of the item he was looking for.
Dean wants to make dinner for Date Night. Let's see how that turns out.
“You do belong to me,” His voice sending a chill through him despite the pain. His stubbled chin brushing along Dean’s, humming low in approval. He didn’t know what to do, his breath was coming out in short pants, his left hand coming up to hold onto Castiel’s wrist.
It wasn’t until he had unlocked the door when he turned around. Squinting into the night, off in the distance a vague shape could be seen.
Lucky for him, he doesn't exactly have a gag reflex anymore.
Meg was ‘sweeping’ with her back turned as the suited man walked to the counter, those green eyes pinning Castiel in place as he placed both hands on the counter.
“Beige,” He watched Dean turn to look for the vehicle in question. But little did he know, Castiel had actually walked here. The keys in his pocket were just his house keys. He also wasn’t expecting the hot bartender to assist him. He figured he’d be stumbling home, hoping he would get to the right apartment and crash for the night.
A loud bang halted Eldon’s movement, frozen in his movement. The new hole in his neck began leaking profusely as the man choked, his body falling backward. Behind him sat Dean with a smoking gun aimed where Eldon once was before placing the item on the table.
“Oh, that’s ok, sir. Tipping is not necessary.” Castiel explained, holding both hands out to wave away to money.
The people scrambled, one of Dean's bullets finally hitting a target. They cried out, limping towards the open car door.
He was content.
It must have done the job as the pain in his neck edged away.
“And?”
He watched Dean’s arms move, hands finding Castiel’s chest as he smoothed over one nipple to the next, rubbing over his cock. Sighing into the man’s touch, feeling the goosebumps as he let the man’s cock caress the side of his face.
Only her and her nest held any power over the rowdy bunch. Becoming commanders, the mouthpiece of the Alpha when his presence wasn’t there.
Dean stayed silent.
“Dean,” Castiel said, not realizing how deep his voice had become. He brought a hand up to rub at his throat, clearing it slightly just a flicker above the man’s head caught his attention.
The Alphas body covering the other, keeping himself up as to not crush the man by laying between his legs, hands exploring once again as the body pushed upwards.
“Dean. It’s me! Your Brother, flesh, and blood!” Sam gulped out, the glow in his hand disappearing as he held up both hands to show he was unarmed. “You can’t believe the words of this creature.”
"The man wasn't gonna end the purge. If he had managed to survive this Purge, he'd have died during the next."
He licked the tip with the flat part of his tongue, lapping up any precum that was leaking, all the while staring up at Dean who looked back with pure lust.
He could feel a bead of sweat dripping from his forehead, wiping it away right before he felt a tingling sensation course through him.
“Clarence,” Meg’s voice rang out, turning his attention towards the women as she entered the room. He didn’t understand the nickname, but she was so fond of it that he allowed it. He also had a soft spot for her after she came to his service. “Maybe you should slow down,"
. He can still feel a slight buzzing energy radiating throughout his body.
“As every great villain says, You haven’t seen the last of me,” before a blinding light burst from Cas’ eyes and mouth. Dean turned watched as a sliver of light float above him for a few minutes before drifting out the broken window Lucifer created earlier.
“Hey Doc,” the familiar voice greeted from across the room.
“What’s your safe word,” he asked, pausing his movement for the response.
Dean's face fell at the comment.
wanted you, Dean. And I-I…” Dean’s mind reeled at the confession.
Raising a brow at the comment, he was about to respond when another message came through.
“Whatever, Dean,” and to rub salt in the wound, he pulled out the offensive desert and placed it on the table.
Whiskey then. Since it was the first bottle he grabbed. Now Castiel was not drunk, he was just on the cusp of clumsy and tipsy. If he had gotten another drink, this would have been a whole different story.
“And do you remember the oath I, myself, gave you in return?” Dean stayed silent, eyes opening wide in slight confusion. From the wound, the blood loss and the fact that Cas had his freaking thumb making worse, he remained quiet.
“Look out!”
“You know I can be as stubborn as you. I’ll keep you here until you see reason.”
The man staring at him with lust blown eyes, cheeks flushed, his suit rumpled from being manhandled, his cock fully erect and resting against said suit.
“Now what are you doing?”
“I’m fine,” he retorted as another person was placed before him.
Looking around, he was met with music playing softly throughout the house. As he made his way further inside, he realized that no one was home but the windows and sliding glass door were open.
“That was too easy,” one of the men laughed out from his sprawled position against the tree. Dean would bet anything that he was drinking by the pouch in his hand.
Sneezing loud enough that he probably alerted the entire kingdom of where he was, he sniffled in relief when the ordeal was over. It didn’t last long when he heard the loud slam behind him.
Dean was about to rebuttal when Sam’s phone went off. Well shit…
“Great,” he managed out, smiling back as to not worry her. The servant placed his breakfast in front of him at the same time Sam came in. He smiled at them before taking his seat across from Dean.
He doesn’t know how long time passed until the creature decided to give up, bringing his arms down from covering his face, he looked up to see the coast was clear.
“Dean!” he turned at his name, to his brother who was standing at the balcony, fear clear in his eyes.
His eyes narrowed, Meg may be the commander of his ever-growing army and he did admire her bluntness, but he will not let his efforts go to waste.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, but there is some business to discuss,” he said while eyeing the witch up and down as he stopped just before the Alpha.
back into 'professional' mode as he moved closer.
As he searched for his clothes amongst the mix, he relished in the feel of his accomplishment.
“He’s fine,”
“It’s the look you had when you walked in,” winking at Castiel before turning around to take orders from people who were patiently waiting.
His white shirt was rumpled, hair messy more so than normal. But that wasn’t what stood out, aside from the bike helmet under his arm, it was the purpled bruise along the side of his face that started just under his left eye and extended to his chin. Dean watched him walk towards Anna who was standing at the counter, her hand gingerly touching his face. He noticed the flinch from Castiel and felt his heart sink.
"Anyways, after I woke up, I ran. When I managed to get the doors open, I recognized what day it was and I ran."
"You’re a freaking child, you know that? Just because you can do what you want, doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want." At that, he pulled out his gun, firing it into the man's skull beside him, shoving the oncoming attacker to dark towards the pews.
"Cas..." the voice croaked out, full of need. The sound of want in the man’s voice making him hard.
The Winchesters.
Blinking back the tears he wouldn’t shed.
boyfriend... I don’t mind sharing him with the rest of my family.”
Dean lay there, ass still in the air. Not a care in the world as he revealed in post-orgasmic bliss. He didn’t hear the noise in the kitchen or ruffling through drawers. He did hear the light footfalls coming closer and that deep gravelly voice telling him he should move to the bigger couch.
“On your knees,” Castiel managed in between the kiss, hands-on Dean’s shoulder, pressing lightly to guide him down. He delighted in how easily the man obeyed as he reached up to undo his belt, pulling the zipper down, and moving the cloth around till he was able to free his half-hard member.
“Clarence,” her voice soft, blue eyes finally lifting to meet those that were usually sly and mischievous, surprised to find them concerned and warm. Caring, even.
Hearing the door shut to another room in the apartment was Dean’s cue to let it rip.
One of the few times he was able to be ready before Castiel. When he got home, Cas had been hustling around, cleaning the house, already home from work.
“This is not my home,” he started, curling his fists when the man just stood there. Unperturbed at the comment.
Castiel didn't say anything, removing his hands to undo the man's loose knot keeping his pants up. Hearing the faint sound of material as it dropped around Dean's ankles. He took this cue to remove his shirt as Castiel stood there watching. Drinking up the smooth, evenly toned, freckled skin of this man.
Thrusting again right before speeding himself up to a bruising pace. Dean felt the man gripped his hips tightly, pushing Dean into the cushions with every thrust.
“And why’s that? I’m paralyzed and you could have your way with me if you want. What’s holding you back.”
The line was out the door and he managed to squeeze into the place and snag a seat at one of the furthest booths. He nodded to the employees, those he’s come to recognize during his time. They didn’t talk much with them aside from general greetings, order taking, and thank you’s. He’d occasionally send a wink to one of the pretty girls that would be working, some were brave enough to smile and wink back.
“Your efforts were done in vain. Mary made sure that the seal that kept me from my true self remained intact." He could sense a presence from behind him, he turned his hand in that direction as he blasted a surge of energy. The smoke cleared to reveal nothing there. A low shuffling noise to his left alerted him, he swung around with his leg, stifling the satisfaction he felt when his foot came into contact with his brother's side. He watched his brother drop to one knee while clutching his side. "You should stick with the magic, close combat was never your thing."
"Such a freaking cocktease," Dean grumbled out as he did as he was told. Meanwhile, Castiel grabbed Dean's tie, untying his own in the process.
But Sam knew the game he was playing and even had a four-digit number.
“It’s okay. I’ll bike...” Castiel responded, trying to keep the disappointment from his voice. He hung up after quietly saying ‘see you later'. He looked around the vast bedroom, sighing under his breath as he began to shift out of the king-size bed. Hissing from the pain as he stood, he tried to make quick work of showering and getting dressed while limping around.
Hearing Dean whimper at the contact right as Castiel started his slow strokes along his length, allowed him to use his right to slowly pull the toy out again.
“Don’t blame John,” Bobby wheezed out, Dean looking from the wound to meet the man’s eyes.
Trailing kisses down to the juncture between his neck and shoulder. He felt him nuzzle the spot, feeling something sharp scrap the skin.
The green-eyed man smiled, letting his head drop to his forearms as he let out a laugh. Castiel stared at him until he was able to calm himself enough to look back at him.
I really tried to finish this story before school started, but alas...I didn't :( the characters were being stubborn. I hope you all enjoyed this chapter, the next one is already planned out. Hopefully I can't get it to you, my amazing readers, as soon as possible ^^;
"You know I'm not good at "verbal affirmations," he started, taking a deep breath in. "But I show how I feel a lot easier,"
He reached through the hole in the man's briefs with the other hand to pull out his prize and holy mother of everything good.
“Please,” he repeated a little louder this time.
“Stay,” he whispered just before Dean could turn away, realizing he was leaving. If the pants he was wearing were any indication.
“I will not!”
Where the hell did that come from?
C. L. M. A.
Uncovering the paper revealed a box and inside he found the gift wrapped in tissue.
A ritual.
A simple white long-sleeved shirt with a green jerkin tied off in the front with a black cord. Black trousers and boots to complete the outfit. He’s worn these clothes before but now, for some reason, they started to feel stifling.
.” he choked at the last part, closing his eyes, a hand coming up to grip Dean’s. “And I was craving sex. It sensed you were still near but I wouldn’t let it.
He had to resist the urge to run, but walking fast was close enough as he made his way towards his bedroom.
But the urge to kiss the man threw him through a loop. Why was he thinking that?
He tried to fight, tried bringing his hands up to push the guy away, and moving his head away, but he couldn’t.
He turned around at the sound of the door shutting, plunging the room into the darkness.
Sam peaked around the corner of the door to make sure his brother wasn’t pulling his leg, moving all the way in and closing the door for privacy. His face pinched with concern as he tried to start the conversation.
He looked behind him towards his parents who wore an equally surprised look on their faces.
Neither one lasting much longer, Castiel gripping the man’s shoulder, making new angry marks as he came between them. Dean following shortly after three more thrusts, hips stuttering.
“Here's the plan: when that evil creature comes back, you'll distract it, and I'll hit it. We'll escape while the dragon sleeps.” Smirking at how ingenious the plan was making an Ah-ha noise when he found a good-sized rock that he could fit in his hand.
In the distance he could make out the dragon skull standing tall out of the ocean, the sun setting behind it, illuminating where the eye socket would be, giving Dean an uneasy feeling. What if this doesn’t work?
Raising a brow at the question, “N-no, what is this?”
"Liar!"
It was quiet, the air around them slightly tense as Meg fixed her gaze on him. Her neatly trimmed eyebrow raised in curiosity at the comment. Taking in Castiel’s haggard appearance, his coat that was usually crisp and clean was now crinkled. His suit that he always seemed to wear, the shirt was untucked and his tie was somehow now backward.
“They found him,”
“Dean,” Castiel asked again.
“Sam, why are you acting this way?” Dean questioned after attempting to push his little brother out of the way.
Slowly he pushed his middle finger in without any resistance. He started slow, in and out, hearing the slight hiss from Dean every now and then. It didn't take long for Castiel to add the second digit.
"You've never be-jesus christ-"
“Hey,” Dean’s voice was low, deep, sending a pulse of pleasure down south. To have that voice whispered in his ear as he...Shaking his head, Castiel focused on Dean’s voice.
“Please,” Dean voiced shuddered, moving his head away from the kiss. Castiel taking the moment to leave a trail of nips and biting along his neck to his shoulder.
“Fuck,” Dean moaned out, leaning forward to kiss a trail along Cas’ neck as he started his slow pace.
“Now tell me,” Castiel continued, turning his back to the man and to the table behind him. Full of interesting gadgets that Alastair had laying about. He picked up a metal pin, the length of his forearm.
The burglar was taken away on a gurney later on due to still being unconscious. And thankfully Castiel had the forethought to grab a beanie for Dean to cover up the flowers on his head.
Dean managed to get into a seated position, his back against the double doors he'd been flung into.
“Watch your step!"
The way they were before this was exactly how he wanted it to stay. Despite the thoughts he had of the man before, at least he hadn’t acted on it.
He was being kissed.
A second later a spotlight appeared in the middle room, Dean squinting at the sudden change.
He was brushing his hand through man’s hand, both reveling in the touch of one another.
"Dean…" he trailed off, pulling the covers over his head.
Bad idea.
“Do something, Dean!” his father’s voice commanded out of nowhere. Green eyes turned back to his dad the moment one of the demons leaned down to grab at the man’s hair, pulling his head back so the other could land a punch to his jaw. Flinching, Dean turned back to Castiel, his body going cold at the man’s intense blue eyes watching him.
It wasn't that big but it looked like a storage room for the tables and chairs for the place. Stacks of chairs to one side and three tables, one stacked on top of the other while the latter was free of anything and shoved against the wall.
An all-white robe decorated with equal parts silk and lace, red ribbons, and flowers placed here and there. A vine shape crowned adorned his head. Little silver ornate trinkets decorating his wrists and neck.
This must all be in his head, he thought as he rubbed his eyes and forehead. Feeling the sweat-soaked skin as he ran his hand over his face.
“This way,” Dean instructed from behind, slipping past Castiel to get into the hall. And they ran. Down the hall as shouts filled the air for them to stop. Through the exit and to their freedom.
His hand running along the man's back, slipping a hand under the waistband of his pants, grabbing a handful of that plump ass. Enjoying the moan around his cock that it earned him.
“No, that’s not it, I came-” he was interrupted by a distant crashing sound from above. They both looked up in time as dust clouds shook from the boards above.
“I-I’m sorry,”
The more comfortable he got, the less he cared about where he was being prepped.
This anxious feeling under his skin seems to have faded.
Holy cow, he’s going to explode.
“I won,” Dean mumbled, turning his head to look at Cas.
“Well, Mom’s worried,” Sam said again after Dean brushed by him. Turning to watch his older brother pause at the door.
“Verbal responses only,”
"Dean! Are you kidding me," Sam exclaimed, sitting up straighter to give his brother an incredulous look. Dean glanced over his shoulder and shrugged.
But why?
“The one with the evil entity locked away,” Bobby filled in, his voice rough like he’d been pulled away from his nightly drinking. “The one capable of bringing all life as we know it to its knees, darken the skies and bring about the enslavement of the human race. And more than likely the extinction if it holds a grudge for what our ancestors did to it,”
"Never what?"
“Castiel, this is Sam. He transferred into our school last week,” Hannah introduced, gesturing towards the man.
Scooting back into his comforter, wrapping it tightly around his body, he laid on his back, face turned towards the pillow.
His father and mother were both servants.
(See the end of the chapter for
"you're not going to kill me," Castiel stated in a matter-of-fact tone as he shifted to sit on the floor, tired of the strain on his shoulder. "You would have done it by now," He heard The Demon's footsteps as it paced around what must be a big room. "He's ours to protect. That's all I am telling you,"
He glanced down at the peaceful look, his mind going back to the way Castiel had gripped him, not too hard, but enough to give that feeling of tightness to help him along.
It might have been the alcohol. Of course, the adrenaline and hormones could be affecting him enough to make him nod.
“Nope, no chick flick moments,” Dean looked Cas in the eye, staring firmly get his point across, Cas nodding, right as Dean opened the door.
Pacing back and forth, arguing with himself in his head, he almost missed the knock on his door.
Wait! He's distracting him.
“And what you did to your own brother was much worse,” Castiel retorted, a hand sneaking around Dean’s torso possessively. “But I freed him.” Dean could feel the Alphas lips pressing to his neck followed by the wet feeling of his tongue tracing from the junction in his neck to his ear.
Dean ignored the smirk from his brother as he pulled out his phone, dismissing Rachel by mumbling something about maybe tomorrow? Rachel pouted, leaning back, and pulled her phone out. Dean rolled his eyes, glancing up at his brother whose smirk turned into a smile.
Castiel didn’t question it, wrapping his arms around the man, relief of finally having the man in his grasp.
"How's Bobby?" The two turned to look towards the bed, said person was laying across with their eyes closed, the steady rise and fall of his chest indicating he was still alive.
The man watched everything unfold way into the night, watching as each person left till there was no one left.
“Cas,” he said once again, firm enough to make the creature stop hissing. Taking a tentative step forward, then another until he was able to reach a hand to hold the man’s face with both hands.
Bedpost, table, curtains!
“I don’t even know who you are,” Dean panted out between each surge of pain.
“I fell off my bike.” he lied, adjusting his jacket and apron.
His body was becoming heavier the farther he drifted into sleep the longer he laid still.
Instead of responding, he closed his eyes and sunk into the bath until the water was just below his nose.
“You.” He said this time with a little more force.
Grasping the doorknob, he peered inside the darkroom. The sound of moaning, sheets moving as the body on them writhed around.
"Have fun," she called over her shoulder as she walked away.
“Yup. Paid off an’ all.” If anything else was said, Castiel didn’t hear, he was currently coming down from the adrenaline high, the whole ordeal shocking his system.
The familiar-looking tan trenchcoat was the only indication of it being who Dean was looking for.
Nothing.
He pressed 'Scavenge for Food'
Just short of his twenty-fifth birthday, Dean Winchester is the firstborn to John and Mary Winchester. First in line to the throne, after he marries and his father steps down from old age, he will rule over the Kingdom his family had built many generations ago.
It was a big tub and could fit two people in total. Three if Dean counted that one time with the princess and her lady in waiting.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you the one that does him?"
"Found it, did wonders on your demon there," smirking, feeling his confidence start to bubble. "Now leave his body."
“Didn’t lose your damn wedding rings,” Dean mumbled out irritably.
A confused looked crossing Dean’s face, his cheeks turning redder at the comment when he realized what it would be for.
“That’s if he still wants to have anything to do with you after he comes to his senses,”
He swiped away the notification before throwing his phone into his bag. He was supposed to meet Charlie and Hannah for a study session down at the library.
“Maybe.” Inais echoed, mocking as he purposefully turned to ignore the glare sent his way.
“S-stop!” he cried out, trying to get the men to stop their chant as they continued to pull him closer. A cold pang of fear in the pit of his stomach.
He doesn’t know, he doesn’t care, his body moving on its own as he leaned up to catch Dean’s lips with his own. He could feel his heart begin to pump faster at finally having this, a dream but now it was his reality.
Castiel had to squash the flattery, shifting in his seat from the slight discomfort it caused at seeing the spike.
Looking down, amazed that it had worked, the salt line was doing exactly as Cas had told them.
Squatting down behind a stack of hay and barrels so he could close his eyes and just breathe.
“Kill him already,” Castiel called out, Dean noticing the man’s smirk from the corner of his eye as he shifted closer to one of the pillars. He brought his attention back to Sam, closing his eyes as he took a deep breath in.
Dean grumbled, not truly ok with this being his worst performance ever. Of course, Cas had said he just wasn’t into it.
His lips were soft, slightly chapped, a hand on his side of his face, ghosting along and down towards his chest.
“He’s trying to kill us, Dean! He’s going to annihilate the human race!” Sam tried, voice shaking.
“Not the answer I was hoping for,” she taunted, pulling out her wand from her boot.
Honestly, this was only going to be about 5-7 chapters long! XP
“I took care of it,” he repeated as he pulled away. He finally removed his thumb which seemed to snap Dean back to reality as he let his head roll back to rest against the wall, his breathing finally leveling out.
Another Amazing Art piece by the incredible: TheFriendlyPigeon!!
The dejected look in the man’s eyes, the crushing feeling Castiel felt when Dean started avoiding him after that.
He couldn’t help the smile that appeared on his face.
the voice murmured, their hand feeling less cold, as it moved its way up past his stomach, pinching his nipples on its way to landing on his neck.
“Don't look!”
Gripping the cards in his pocket as he left the coffee shop, he fumbled for his keys to unlock the door, sliding along the leather seat to start the car.
Turning off the water when it reached just below the edge, he sat in silence, head leaning on the ledge as he let his body float there.
He stood from his slouched spot, grabbing the handle and turning it to open the door just a crack.
“Hey there handsome and what is your name?” Castiel watched the man's face turn toward Meg then to him. He smirked and turned towards her, mimicking her leaning position against the counter.
Humming to himself, Dean placed the rag he was using into the sink as he came around the counter to join Cas in the living room.
Every part of him seemed to fade away as his lips easily slid along the man. Need, want, lust slowly taking its place the longer the kiss went on.
“Great. You’re demoted down to Associate. Go see Crowley and get out of my site.” The man jumped at the tone, chills running down their spine before scampering off.
“How will I be able to do that if I don-” He was stopped when the man ripped the paper and handed it to Sam.
“I-it’s nothing,” Castiel managed out after regaining his composure. He grabbed his phone and pressed the button on the side, which made the phone turn off.
"I see why you'd need me then," already picturing how rough this guy will be. "The couch, as usual?"
“No, I told you I would love you, faults and all.” Crushing their lips together.
"H-hey!" He shouted as they began to walk away. He frantically grabbed at the closest weapon, the second blade in the tree. Throwing it haphazardly in their direction.
A snowflake floated beside him, drifting along with the air current before disappearing. Followed by the wind picking up around them, the fires and banners bending to the sudden change gust of wind.
“And miss this? Yeah, nothing would stop me from seeing you win,” the oldest brother smirked. Holding an arm out, they entered the waiting room, finding the closest folding chairs to sit down on. Dean checked his hand wraps again out of nervousness.
There was silence except for the heaving breathing between the two. It was like time froze, the two stuck in that position. Who was gonna move first?
Dean started backing away. She stayed put. But the sound of chainsaws revving up had him turning and sprinting away.
Rolling his eyes at the display, he dismissed it since she has been very useful to him thus far.
He felt a pang of fear when her head turned in his direction. Her whole body following shortly after spotting him. The shadows of the streetlights masking her eyes, but she was staring right him. He could feel that intense gave.
“Don’t worry,” the words catching Cas’ attention. “I pick things up pretty quickly.”
“It’s ok,” he murmured between them, their lips a mere inches away. “We’ll learn together,”
"The economy was on the verge of collapse. We told them we could help solve this problem by allowing us to feed one night a year."
It may be true, but try controlling that thing when someone or
When Dean didn’t respond Castiel sat up a little straighter in his seat, his mind beginning to make connections.
“Dean,” Castiel groaned out as the man traveled farther down, Dean unbuttoning and kissing the exposed chest as he went.
"Go on," Castiel urged, turning to look at Dean who seemed a tad...nervous.
One of the two girls he spent the night with, one of them brought his clean clothes. As she left, Dean turned to watch her leave, but she was suddenly gone. But he could swear he saw a small light flicker away.
He did it a couple more times, each thrust becoming quicker and harder before releasing the man's head.
He helped Castiel sit up, moving away as he sat on the edge of the bed. Watching the man pick up something from the floor, turning towards him with it in his hands. His tie.
Rowena could feel the waves of pent up sexual frustration and rage within the man.
Reaching around the fabric for the opening, his hands found the split between the two, pushing it to the side just enough to peer out.
The quiet between the two brothers didn’t last long as the sound of a knight with their clinking armor approached the library.
Clicking the phone off, not seeing the message flashing:
“Nope,” was all Dean said, leaning his back against the island, taking in the small apartment.
Castiel could feel the tug of the plug, sighing in relief when it was pulled out, but was short-lived when he felt the tip of Dean's tongue pushing past the wall of muscle.
"No, I'm serious. Believe it or not, your paths crossed on more than one occasion. Admired you from afar,"
"If I could land a hit, this man is freaking squirrely as hell. Mage, do something," the blade thrower called out, glancing at the fourth person stilled perched by the fire.
“I know Bobby, I’m sorry, I didn’t listen-“
Unfortunately for Dean, it led to Bobby grilling him about what was going on inside that ‘noggin’ of his.
“Sam?” he asked in concern, noticing his friends' faces morphing into distress.
As for the ones who wanted sex, he had to make up an excuse over the phone as to why he couldn't do anything. One guy got so concerned that he thought Dean got some kind of butt crab infection. Whatever that is.
“Alright, we're gonna sprint across. Count down from ten then open the door.” Dean replied into the phone. “The second I hand up,”
“Real funny,” Sam replied, relaxing himself a bit in the doorway.
“Now, if there's no sign - what does that mean? It means she is no longer alive. Do you understand? Turn the ship around. We're going home.”
“Castiel? Where are you?!” Dean cried out, the grip disappearing, followed by the rumbling of the rocks around him. The deafening roar of the Dragon was loud with the thunderous boom of his body as it moved about the area above. He followed the sound in time to look up, frozen in fear when he looked up into the face of the Dragon set high above him. It gave out a roar which snapped Dean out of his paralyzed state, ducking for cover as the creature moved around the hole above, trying to reach for its prize.
wanted you.” The voice sounding less distorted, more human than creature.
“How will sexual intercourse make this year any different?” Castiel asked, truly confused at the comment. He watched Dean’s hand pause at reaching for something inside, shaking his head the comment before looking up at him.
“After you dropped me off with my foster family...something happened. I felt like my body was on fire. And I changed into that
They were laying right before the altar.
“Not all my energy has been on training, Sammy,” emphasizing his point when he noticed a couple of the servant girls walking by. The giggled, hands covering their lips when Dean gave them a wink.
"Hello, Darling," the familiar voice sending tiny electrical tendrils throughout Cas' body, freezing him in his actions. He lifted his gaze to the new 'customer', heart sinking at when the reality of the situation burst his bubble. “Didja miss me,” he purred, his hand reaching across the counter to cup Castiel’s face.
"You're smart, you'll figure it out," A hand grabbed Castiel's jaw, the voice close to his ear this time. "And until then, I have you all to myself for the time being" A cold kiss pressing to his neck.
Sam and his mother didn’t exactly tell him they were magical either. He could have started believing then if they’d done it in front of him.
“Oh yeah, how are those sprinkles in your hair doing,” They both stared at each other for a few seconds before bursting into laughter.
“I don’t know,” Dean crossed his arms, shrugging his shoulders at the thought. “It just seems ridiculous, I’ve never seen any of these creatures. What if our ancestors trapped a small creature inside thinking it was some dark entity?”
that voice came out of nowhere, startling Dean, not thinking he would hear it so soon.
Letting out a yelp when those feelings came back with force, pulling him into three separate directions, followed by animalistic noises from all directions, hissing and snarling as one force tugged him around like a rag doll, tripping over his feet as he lurched from one direction to the next.
"What the hell is this?" Came Dean's voice from Castiel's ass.
He kept his eyes closed, breathing a sigh of relief, taking in the silence and the weight that was keeping him pinned had now vanished.
“You.” Not understanding why this was even being asked.
“So you can sail away.”
“I only work for you, Castiel James Novak, and only you. No one else. I pledged and gave myself over wholly to serve you and you alone.”
Castiel looked down, hand seizing its movement of pulling out. He let go of the flat hilt part, his eyes glancing down towards the man's feet. His toes are curled tight, looking around, the hands were clenched as well.
“What’s your name then?”
Watching the man, tan in color with a mop of black hair, rippling back muscles as he stretched his arms above his head to the sky. A groan, so low it sent shivers down south, Dean questioning himself on what kind of reaction that was when he felt his dick perk up.
"Maim him, if you end up killing him, you'll suffer a worse death then what hell could do for you," blondie called out to the black-haired man.
Dean gave him a confused look.
He couldn't help it when his hips jutted forward just a bit, but it was enough to elicit a choked noise from the man. Blue eyes closed, head falling back against the headrest at the surge of pleasure from the feel of the vibration from the back of the man's throat.
"Uh, Aaron," he lied.
He yelped in surprise at the smack to his ass.
“We haven't introduced ourselves. My name is Dean. What's yours?” There was a long pause, a thought flitted through Dean’s mind. He doesn’t know anything about this guy. Except for his deep voice that made Dean shudder.
Around the same time, Castiel's parents had retired.
“Not since the last time you were here,”
“Or maybe, they were hitting the hash a little harder back then,” Dean smiled at the thought of his great great great grandparents sitting around a fire, having some of that green stuff.
“On your knees,” he heard him murmur into his ear, disrupting his thoughts, the hands disappearing from his body. He obediently did as he was asked.
"That's...that was a good date. You weren't fond of the different temperatures of the pie versus the ice cream," Dean watched Castiel breathe a sigh of relief, standing up straighter as he adjusted his tie. "You kept mumbling stuff like, "molecules" and "overly sweet"."
Now, Castiel is not overly fond of the beach, but...it did sound like fun.
The next night, he brought a man home.
"Silence," the third man demanded after throwing something at the second man from his standing position by the fire. His hood was still up but Dean was able to make out short blond hair with bright green eyes under the cover of darkness.
Gasping, Dean moved away from the kiss when he felt Castiel’s finger circling his entrance.
That's when he noticed the problem. There was an obvious stain from all the precum dripping from the man's weeping cock, straining hard from lack of contact.
How the hell did he know Dean’s name?!
Castiel nodded and said the same, waiting for them to leave before continuing his conversation.
“F-fuck,” he heard Dean cry out under his breath at the feel of Cas’ tongue on his hole. Moving around the rim, poking past the rim here and there.
“Cas-can’t-gonna-” Was all Castiel heard before letting go, a shuddering breath from Dean, but he didn’t cum.
“Let's switch to rowing - we might find the island then,” he waited. Michael hadn’t said a word when he turned to look at him. “We have to make a decision.”
“Dean, don't do it.”
The guy looked down at his wardrobe.
"Have you been here before?" Sam asked, eyeballing the small menu they kept at the tables.
He kept his attention on the gun but he could hear the footsteps as they got closer, the embarrassing squeak of the seats as the newcomer slid into the spot before them.
Turning his attention towards his bed, he saw the covers and pillows all clumped together into a pile in the middle of it.
“Open up,” and Cas did, allowing him to slowly ease himself farther into Cas’ mouth. He breathed in and out of his nose as he slipped further in.
A hum beside him disrupted his thoughts, Dean looked down to see the girl looking up at him sleepy eyes, a small smile pulling at her lips.
Who freaking knows!
“Aw Cas, you know I suck at this part,”
“You should rest,” jumping when he felt a hand on his bare shoulder, he forgot that he was naked. For just a second.
Images of the previous night flashed through in his mind.
When they woke up Sunday morning, Dean had decided they should go to breakfast on the beach.
“Dean, what are you doing?” he finally asked.
“No, please,” the figure cried out when Dean placed a hand on his forearm, yanking it away to curl tighter in on themselves.
Scanning the area again, he shrugged his shoulders. The only noise he could hear was the low footsteps of someone, a servant, walking the halls.
He gave her a toothy grin, nodding his head before laying on his back for the girl to do her thing.
"So we abducted him, a big wig who we knew Sam would try to save. My demons were able to raise me out of that cage. Taking forever, might I add, breaking all those chains. By Letting Castiel "Wake up" during the purge- and you know the rest,"
“You know we’re supposed to be leaving for the party, right?” Dean asked, taking in the sweatpants and oversized t-shirt.
Dean glared at the gun for not having any more bullets before placing the weapon back into the waistband.
Castiel raised a brow at the dynamic shift in the way his character was speaking to him now versus earlier. Even the message board was different. This one was a white background with blue bubbles, like an actual text message.
Balder did have one enemy, Loki, who watched Frigga in her haste, noticed that she missed one plant. The mistletoe. So Loki made an arrow tip of the plant, gave it to someone else to shoot it, striking Balder dead.
“What I mean is, Escorts are supposed to keep people company. They are selected for their warmth, appearance, intelligence, humor, and charm,” Dean could feel his cheeks heating up at the compliment. “I believe sex is just a bonus because when you find someone you can make a connection with, sometimes it feels right and sometimes it’s not.”
“Castiel,” he replied back, shaking his hand as Dean led him outside.
BANG!
It was quiet again and Dean didn’t like that.
Please comment below and leave kudos!
It’s probably a virus. He told him himself as he waited. The response took not even ten seconds.
Dean looked up with Castiel’s cock inches from his face, his own hands moving along Castiel’s legs, unsure of where to start.
“Dean,” Cas tried to keep his voice stern, losing all resolve when Dean sucked his thumb to the knuckle.
Huffing out at the ridiculousness of the context, he responded.
Castiel didn’t care when he heard the items on the dresser being shoved haphazardly by his body as he was propped against the wall, his hands trying to find something grab hold of as Dean began a bruising pace. His body slipping down as Dean’s grip on his hips continued the merciless pursuit for release.
“I quit though!” Castiel tried, the booming noise upstairs was a good indication that he needed to get Dean out of there. Now! “I turned in my gun and badge just before I learned they were going to raid this joint. I came here to take you away,”
He was surprised when he was told that he managed to apprehend the vase during the struggle. What bothered him about the whole conversation was that they kept asking if he touched the urn. Even though it was wrapped in cloth and in his bag when they found him with it.
He felt hands on his ass, gripping, squeezing and spreading him just as he felt something wet tracing around the rim of his hole. Pushing just past the muscle, repeating the motion over and over, Castiel feeling the hum from the man as he lapped around his hole a couple of times.
Dean nodded, his tongue sticking out as he began to run it along Cas’ length. Back and forth before swirling his tongue at the tip.
He truly believed what he was doing right but it all fell apart. Those people...they were innocent! The crunching ahead of him alerted him that
He was only one out of five people in the world with this special ability of his. The only reason he knows about this was because of one google search and he was contacted by an unknown number.
It was quiet. Cas’ finger still in his ass but not moving.
He let out a small squeak when he was suddenly lifted off the chair, his leg institutionally wrapping around the man’s frame.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s cool, that was hot,” Dean brushed off while whipping the spit from his face, smirking up at Cas as he leaned forward to start sucking again.
Shaking his head, Castiel let the man continue guessing. He doesn’t know why, but he just didn’t want to come out and say what this game was about. On one hand, he thought that if he told anyone about a game that was suddenly talking to him like it was a real human being, he might be called crazy. Possibly get dragged to the looney bin.
“So what’s going on in that big beautiful brain of yours, my Unicorn?”
"Dean," and somehow those eyes just got sadder.
As he was munching his way through the second half of the sandwich, he noticed that Dean had knocked the plate of bacon. A piece looking like it was about to fall off.
Castiel leaned into the touch, the hand was warm and it made his heartache for more contact. He simply shook his head in response, not realizing it would cause Dean to stand with a smile on his face.
Laughing at his brother’s bitch face number two as he was shoved half-heartedly in the shoulder, Sam reluctantly agreed.
While the man was looking out the window, Castiel noted the band t-shirt that had seen better days with a low neckline and an unfamiliar necklace resting against his chest. As Castiel got closer, he could see the form-fitting jeans and boots beneath the table. Did Castiel hear his heartbeat loud in his ears at the sight of this whole other side of Dean? Most definitely not. Well...maybe just a tiny bit.
"You wouldn't-"
Did Dean jump up and down in joy?
"Correct!"
"This-intimacy-i've-"
“Now, where is their next meeting?” Dean questioned, guiding the tip of the blade from the bound man's upper cheek, just under their left eye, tracing an imaginary line down to his cheek.
Cas did have a tendency for canceling on some of these shindigs. Dean honestly couldn’t complain. If Castiel didn’t want to go, deciding to stay on the couch and watch tv, well, he was ok with that. Of course, it didn’t last long, once the guy got comfortable, he ended up falling asleep.
“Shit I-”
“There was a guy that used to come into the restaurant I worked in at the time. He was hot and I knew he was checking me out. I could always feel his eyes on me. There was a shift where he came in and I was his server. I ended up writing my number on the receipt,” he used his hands to mime how the rest was history.
Despite there being none left, there was no need to sing this song!
“You know, I have seen that pretty green-eyed man come in for a while, the one that comes in those expensive suites.” Meg’s voice teased from somewhere behind him. Castiel didn’t say anything as he sprayed more of the liquid onto the caked grounds. “Do you think he’s single?”
"Cas," Dean breathed out, quickly rushing around the Altar to Cas' unconscious body. "Hey buddy, wake up," while checking his pulse, relieved to feel a heartbeat. A really low one at that.
Resting an elbow on his knee, hand dangling between his legs. His other hand rubbing his face in irritation.
“Yeah,” was all Dean could get out, a slight blush on his cheeks. “His words, his physique...the way he took control,” he let out a huff of air, bringing the pillow back to his face as if unable to believe he admitted all this.
It took a while, but Dean found himself back in the same cafe after a couple of weeks. He found the atmosphere peaceful and the smell of coffee helped ease his rampant thoughts. After the transition of power, dealing with the staff and other members, establishing himself as the new boss did take a toll on his sleep schedule. He had more meetings later on and he couldn't afford to take a nap in the middle of the day.
The two stopped what they were doing or about to do to stare at Dean.
"Well, what if the designers thought it would be a good way to remind people about what Christmas was about,"
“What are you doing?” Charlie asked, pulling said person from their phone.
“Sorry about the wait, how can I help you?”
“As I sat in that prison, you, one of my firstborn, did
The Dragon’s red eyes burned in his mind as he fought against the restraints, wanting to be free, to take his prize.
A sick sense of satisfaction crept in, the screams echoing in his mind as he felt lips press to his neck, traveling down to the back of his neck.
"How big is this guy?" Castiel questioned, wiggling his fingers around before starting to pull his fingers in and out.
Lucifer looked from Dean to his demons who were now standing before him.
Dean thought, recognizing the shouting of Bobby. When he looked back up, a cold chill ran down his spine at the look he was receiving.
Lying next to Cas, he's really not convinced how heaven could be better than this.
Another gust of wind came through, silencing any sound.
Castiel allowed himself to be pushed down as he watched the man before him strip off his suit, piece by piece.
One of the tavern wenches with her brown hair tied up, revealing her pointed ears. A fairy, based on the magic flowing from her. He wasn’t overly fond of them. The elves were easy to coherence to his side but the fairies were stubborn. Of course, vampires and fairies never did get along.
Castiel’s head dropped low as the thrusts became faster, the grip on his hips tightening, the grunting and moaning from the man above sending shivers down his spine. He could feel his own cock straining as it bobbed from the force.
No cars, garbage littering the parking lot with boards covering some of the windows.
"Careful how you handle me," Dean commented when Juac placed the first loop around his body. "You might turn me on,"
“Cookie time!”
Castiel stared at the man before him as Dean pulled out another headband, this one was brown with antlers sticking out and placing it on his head. What was more absurd was the little bell on one side that rang every time he moved his head. That when a thought crossed his mind.
He took a deep breath in, held it for a few seconds before releasing it. His back leaning against the door, he slowly slid down till he was sitting, his head resting against the door.
This Benny guy was a beast!
“A little decency,” Sam groaned out, shutting the door after walking in on his brother in the buff.
“Do you know who you are? A coward. That's who you are. Silly me, I even chose a name for you, coward! Don't you dare look at me again!” Dean yelled angrily, slamming the closet rock into the hole, effectively closing off the there connection.
“Enough,” Castiel’s voice stopped Dean from saying any more. “I will not risk my job,” and he really did. He wanted to know what those lips would feel like around his cock, the sounds this man-made while he pounded into him. Castiel shook his head, pushing those ideas away.
“And what are you supposed to be?” Dean hissed out at the sensation of a hand grasping him through his pants. At least he’s still had his pants on.
“Why-” he paused, taking a shaky breath in. “Where am I?”
"That was
The voice purred, Dean, jerked at the sound which caused water to splash over the side.
“It’s my old man's, but it’s a ‘67 Chevy Impala.”
“Have you eaten anything today?” Castiel questioned, starting their usual routine of questions. He turned in time to see Dean pushing down his sweats so they’d pool at his ankles. For a man of his size and structure, he was very well hung. No wonder his female clientele list was long.
After changing out of his formal wear, the two made themselves comfortable on the couch, shuffling through Netflix for something to watch.
Sam looked up from his reading, raising a brow at the question.
“Mind your manners, helmsman. Do as my fiance’ commands,”
“You can’t just decide to leave the Castle in an emergency like this,” Sam tried to reason, the conversation going back and forth, ending with Sam using his frame to block the doorway. Hands gripping either side to make a barrier.
Taking a deep breath while removing his hand, slightly glad when Dean sat back in his seat, giving Castiel his full attention.
The feeling of being unsatisfied lasted longer than he thought within those first seven days. He tried his hand with many of the servants and young maidens around the village. Nothing gave him that overall sense of completion.
