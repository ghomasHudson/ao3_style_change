“Ah. Sherlock. How was school today? Did you try making any friends this time?” Mr. Holmes smiled as he entered the kitchen. Sherlock sighed. “Father, I'm not twelve years old, I'm soon eighteen, I don't need to make friends.” Sherlock complained and sat down in his chair, crossing his arms like... well, like an angry twelve year old would do. Mr. Holmes chuckled. “Alright alright. Well, as long as everything went fine I'm happy.” He said and sat down in his chair. Sherlock nodded. “It went... Fine. Dropped my books. Some idiot started to fondle them.” Sherlock huffed. “You mean, try to pick them up?” Mycroft butted into the conversation as he entered the kitchen. “Do you really think someone would steal books at that school? I would be surprised if the students even opened them.” Mycroft continued and sat down. “Now Myc, that's not fair.” Mrs. Holmes said and Mr. Holmes nodded agreeingly. “Your mother's right you know. It's a well known school and they have really good teachers there.” He said pointedly. Mycroft huffed. “Well known for what? That is the question.” He said and sat down, instantly starting to plate up as Mrs. Holmes put the pots on the table. “Oh my you look starving Myc, was your last snack a whopping ten minutes ago?” Sherlock teased. Mycroft glared at him, about to open his mouth when his father raised his hand. “Enough. We're having a civilized dinner right here and now. It's late, your mother has worked hard in the kitchen, and we're going to enjoy this as a family. Understood?” Mr. Holmes said firmly and both boys lowered their heads and nodded. “Yes father.” They both replied and began eating.
""Great! I knew I could count on you! Don't forget to invite all the birds you know. An all bloke party won't be something to look forward too. And yeah, we can probably have the party here. My parents are going on holiday next weekend, it will be sodding perfect mate! We can plan more tomorrow at lunch! MS""
“Sir, is he a threat? I can make him go away, I haven’t been very trained for that but I can make it happen if I need to,” Sherlock said in a monotone voice that made John flinch, realising how close he was. John turned around and placed a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, shaking his head.
Sherlock had rambled on the whole way to John's house about different kinds of bees, their rituals, their different positions in the hive, what different flying patterns meant, and heaps of other things. By the end, John was certain he knew everything there was to know about bees, and he had seen a new side of Sherlock. A side that was genuinly excited about something, a more open Sherlock. He treasured that, even though he had been struggling to not fall asleep a few times. Sherlock looked out the window quickly as the car began to slow down. Was this where John lived? He swallowed and looked at the run-down little house. “I'm sorry... I didn't know I rambled on for so long.” Sherlock said, his eyes still fixed on the house as the car came to a full stop. “Don't worry about it, I liked it. Honestly.” John said with a smile, though saw the way Sherlock was looking at his home. He looked back at it as well, suddenly fearing that his dad had seen him come home in a car like this. “I- I should go-” John stuttered, scrambling to get his seat belt off. “I'll- I'll see you tomorrow yeah?” John said and Sherlock frowned, wondering why John was nervous all of the sudden. “John... Of course we will, but, why are you like this?” Sherlock said, unable to find a suitable word as quickly as he needed since John was already out the door and by the trunk, getting his bag. “See you tomorrow.” John said quickly, avoiding Sherlock's question as he headed for the front door of his house.
“You have done some other questionable things, but I knew your relationship to each other wouldn’t be anything but rocky. So… Fine. Two strikes,” Mycroft agreed before sighing. “Bring him in,” Mycroft called and suddenly, Sherlock was slowly led inside of the room. Sherlock’s gaze was fixed to the ground, as if learning to walk again, which it kind of appeared as if he was doing. He wasn’t walking well, stumbling, his feet stepping on each other, and whoever was guiding him had a firm grip. John’s eyes were wide and he tried to untangle himself from the covers.
“You- You alright there? You should’ve called for me… You were kinda… Out, like a light. Are you certain you don’t need to load?” John asked and Sherlock shook his head, stroking his hand through his curls gently.
“Yeah… You can say that. A different version…” John glanced over to the bedroom, deep in thought from what Ella had just said. He barely noticed her getting up and pulling her jacket on, only realising she was leaving as she stood up. “Are- Are we done already? It’s only been half the time,” John said, looking at his watch briefly, and Ella smiled, placing a gentle hand on John’s shoulder.
Sherlock stood by his locker, trying to sort his books out. He bit his lip, worrying it between his teeth. He looked down the hall as he heard a laugh, paranoid that they were laughing about him. He couldn't face another school with bullying. He couldn't face being transferred yet again. So far, he was doing fairly well. No one had bothered bugging him yet, but people didn't find his cleverness to be something good. He saw a few scribbles on the wall, starting to focus on them, causing him to lose grip on his books and they all tumbled to the floor making a loud noise. “Woah there, lost your grip?” John said, having just walked by when the books had tumbled to the floor. Sherlock quickly turned around, barely looking up at the other young man. “What's it to you?” He muttered. John frowned. “I... Uh, nothing, I suppose?” He said and raised an eyebrow, hunching down and leaving his ball on the floor to start picking up some of the books. “Don't touch them.” Sherlock hissed quickly. John sighed and stood back up. “Are you afraid I might learn something?” John said with a smirk. Sherlock frowned. “Highly unlikely, with your brain capacity.” Sherlock snarled a little. John stepped back, frowning once more. “Right... Cheers.” He said and turned around, leaving with a huff. Sodding idiot.
He was certain he had never been held quite like this before, and especially not by a bloke. Not that it mattered. God why couldn't he just get that through his head? He closed his eyes. Right. If he just imagined that Sherlock was Sherlock, without any gender, well, at least not with a determined one, what did he feel then? He kept his eyes closed, trying to think through and understand his feelings. Sherlock tilted his head. “John? Are you alright?” Sherlock asked after a little while, worried he had done something wrong. “Hmm? What? I'm fine, yeah, yeah I'm fine.” John opened his eyes to look at Sherlock and smiled softly. “Are you alright?” John asked, wrapping his arm around Sherlock's waist. Sherlock blushed a deeper shade of red, nodding quickly as John wrapped his arm around him. “Y- Yes! Yes. Brilliant, in fact. Just, uh, need more breakfast.” He said and quickly grabbed his plate, working on finishing it off.
here if it wasn’t for her. She’s the one that had the contact with Mycroft, and she’s the one recommending you to me. If anything, you and I should both be thanking her,” John tried and Sherlock stopped squirming, his eyes widening slightly.
“Oh, wow, right to the point then uhm, it’s been… Interesting. Definitely interesting, heh. Less… Lonely… Most certainly,” John cleared his throat after the vague description and Ella nodded with a little smile.
“Try to be quiet okay? I know dad's not home but my mum and sister are still in.” He whispered to Sherlock as they stepped out of the cab. Sherlock had insisted at paying of course, going on and on about how it was his fault for the whole thing and John tried to tell him that it wasn't. Sherlock could really not be blamed at all, and he tried to tell him that in a million different ways. John gently turned the key in the lock, opening the door slowly. Everything was dark, and he gently took Sherlock's hand just to lead him inside. “I probably shouldn't start the kettle, but do you want something to snack on?” John asked and Sherlock nodded shyly, still keeping his hand in John's, not wanting to let go. John smiled. “Alright, I'll see if I can find some crisps for us.” John said and moved to the kitchen. “I'll need my hand for that you know.” He said with a soft smile and Sherlock quickly let go, turning the other way. He was glad it was dark, it made his blushing less noticable.
Androids had become part of the society, somewhat. Not everyone could afford one and most of them had niche tasks they performed. No, not those. Well… Not
“She… recommended me? To you? She’s… The reason you found me?” Sherlock stuttered out and John nodded.
The car ride home to the Holmes residence was fairly quiet. John was very tired from school, yawning every other minute, and Sherlock had retreated into his mind. He was smiling to himself, looking down at his hand which was still held firmly by John's. They had walked through the whole school like that, hand in hand. John hadn't even snapped at him for it. People probably saw them, yet John hadn't even brought that up yet. Was John /too/ quiet though? Sherlock frowned and bit his lip, squeezing John's hand a little to get his attention. John turned from the window to look at Sherlock, smiling sleepily. “Sorry, I'm just a bit tired. Are you okay?” John said, squeezing Sherlock's hand back. Sherlock nodded. “Yes, yes I'm fine. I was just... A bit worried. You're so very quiet...” Sherlock mumbled and looked at John sincerely. John smiled. “There's nothing to be worried about. I'm fine, just tired. I promise.” John said and scooted a bit closer, tilting his head. He bit his lip before gently reaching over to cup and stroke Sherlock's cheek softly. He had no idea such a small thing could feel so intimate. He blushed and smiled. “So, what are we going to do when we get back to your place?” John said curiously, leaning back at the seat.
Hello everyone! I'm sorry this is a bit late, but I've just started a new job and it's throwing off my entire sleep schedule and I'm having a super hard time adjusting to it so I'm just so very bleh right now. This chapter is a bit shorter, but I hope you will like it either way <3 I'm thinking about posting on Sundays again which I did keep up for a while (I think), so then I have the weekend to write and hopefully that will make it easier! Anyways, I hope you are all doing well and thank you for reading as always *hugs* <3 //NightOfFanfics
Mycroft shrugged. “Well to my knowledge you are not interested in sports, neither are you likely to care about if your new school wins this game or not, and from what I can tell, you haven't made any friends that wants you to go either... unless...” Mycroft deduced quickly and looked at his brother. “Unless what?” Sherlock said, turning around, trying to confuse his brother's deductions. Mycroft smiled smugly. “Judging by your choice of clothing someone special is going to be there. You also received late night texts last night though those texts have not continued today. You don't seem very happy so you going there is rather unfortunate, or something important hangs on this decision. Back to the choice of clothing. Tight purple shirt, skinny jeans, you, brother dear, are looking to impress someone.” Mycroft finished. “God you're easy to deduce.” He said with a snort. Sherlock was positively blushing now, looking down at his outfit. He hadn't... Was he dressing to impress John? No... Not consciously at least. “So, who's the /lucky/ lady?” Mycroft said with a raised eyebrow and a firm gaze. “Or shall I say, /young man/?” He said, a smile tugging at the corner of his lip.
“Mike is your human?” The android asked and Sherlock shook his head. “Oh… Someone else then… What are your tasks? Cleaning? Cooking? Butlering?” The android continued and Sherlock was getting agitated, clutching his hands into fists.
“It’s my loading station, it’s called the WallBox,” Sherlock spoke suddenly, making John fall backwards, stumble, and fall right on his arse with a louder groan. Sherlock sat up quickly, getting up from the bed and kneeling on the floor. “Dr Watson! Are you alright, sir?” Sherlock breathed quickly, looking over John with concern, his hands hovering over John’s upper body, afraid to touch but wanting to make sure he was physically alright at the same time. John grunted and shifted a bit, looking at Sherlock with a pained expression.
I loved writing this chapter, I just needed to write something giddy and fun, and I hope you'll like it just as much as I did writing it! :) Thank you to everyone for being patient with me, hearts to everyone <3<3<3//NightOfFanfics
Second of all, they are sometimes more human than you and me, John, how would you feel if someone just tossed you aside like a piece of scrap metal?”
The place got crowded. Very crowded. And very quickly. Sherlock suddenly felt lost, apprehensive and even a bit scared. Now, he almost followed Molly anywhere she went, just for comfort. She was someone he knew, and now he also knew that she wouldn't be flirting with him anymore since she knew he was infatuated with John. Sherlock gripped his can of pop tightly in his hand, sipping on it gently, careful not to let it out of his sight. Mycroft had told him he shouldn't do that. That someone could put something in it. Sherlock shivered. He didn't like this at all. Not in a million years could he have imagined this party to be this crowded. He sighed to himself, leaning against a wall.
Mycroft was alone in the house, their parents out doing some grocery shopping. They of course had servants to do that, but Mr. and Mrs. Holmes enjoyed doing it themselves just as much. Before John and Sherlock had even reached the door, Mycroft opened it, smirking gently. “Gentlemen, good afternoon.” He said and Sherlock's cheeks heated up. He hadn't seen Mycroft since the party, the older brother being gone since the incident until this Monday morning. “Get out of the way Myc!” Sherlock yelled, pulling John close. John blushed, looking down at the ground. Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Mmm, charming, now,” He said, backing up so they could enter the hallway. “I know you're upset with me, and I know you might be as well John,” Mycroft began, Sherlock constantly glaring at him, John too afraid to look up at the older brother. “Of course I'm upset! You told me I couldn't come home and- and you threatened John and- and-” Sherlock began rambling angrily. Mycroft nodded slowly, his movements calm and collected. “Yes, yes I know. And on this rare occasion, I do want to apologise. So, Sherlock, I'm sorry.” Mycroft said and nodded his head. “And John, I'm sorry too for what I did. I'm sure you did your best with trying to protect Sherlock, and I had no right to be violent against you.” Mycroft finished. Sherlock's jaw hung almost down to the floor, and his eyes were wide and glossy. Mycroft had apologised? Did his older brother just apologise to him, /and/ his new... boyfriend? John was looking up at him as well, but his jaw wasn't dropped down to the floor, instead, he was smiling. “Oh, well, thank you Mycroft and, and I do forgive you. It was quite a chaotic moment and I'm sure things could've been handled better.” John said and nodded. Mycroft nodded as well. “Yes, they could've been, from my part mostly. You did what you could, it was a party after all, you can't be expected to babysit my little brother.” Mycroft said and chuckled a little. Sherlock didn't even react to that, still dumbfounded by the apology. “Uhm, Sherlock?” John said eventually, nudging him a bit. Sherlock quickly licked his lips and nodded. “Thank you Myc-” He gasped and threw his arms around his brother's neck, hugging him tightly. Mycroft sighed fondly, hugging his brother back. “It's okay... It's alright now...” Mycroft said and nodded, closing his eyes. “I forgive you Myc, I know you're just looking after me but- but you don't have to be so- so-” “I know.” Mycroft interrupted Sherlock, stroking his back gently. John smiled at the brothers, taking the opportunity to take off his jacket as he allowed them to have a moment together.
“I'm glad you're doing well.” He said instead with a nod. Sherlock frowned. “Sarcasm?” He asked John and he shrugged. “Not really.” John replied. “I'm just struggling myself, so for you to take advanced courses you must be really smart.” John said, finally finding the right book and sitting down at the same desk Sherlock was but opposite of him. Sherlock bit his lip nervously. “Are you... angry that I'm smart?” Sherlock asked quietly. This was how it began. The teasing. Why did he have to tell John that he was taking advanced courses? John frowned. “Angry that you are smart?” John asked. “Can one be angry because someone else is smart? Jealous, perhaps, but I don't feel anger really.” He shrugged. Sherlock took a breath of relief. John wasn't angry. That was good. Maybe he wasn't a totally ignorant baboon then. “You should use another book.” Sherlock said and got up from his seat, going to the book case and pulling out another book. “Here. This one explains it in a much better way.” Sherlock said, holding the book out for John. John frowned. Wow. Sherlock was actually doing something kind? He took the book, quite shocked indeed. “Oh... Thanks.” He said and looked through the book quickly. Sherlock nodded and sat back down, crossing his legs and grabbing his pencil. “Good bye.” Sherlock said quietly. John smiled and snorted softly at that. “Alright then.” He said and stood up. “Good bye, Sherlock.” He said and gave the young man one last look before leaving the library with the book Sherlock had picked out for him.
Sherlock was wearing a big smile already, ready to go, but he frowned as he realised John was holding his cane. “I thought you had stopped with that thing. You don’t need it,” Sherlock shrugged and John tightened his lips together before clearing his throat.
Maybe Sherlock had made a bigger impact on him than he had first thought. Maybe he was a different version of himself. Mrs. Hudson certainly seemed to believe he was.
Finally, the car began pulling up into a gravel driveway in front of a huge house, the biggest he had seen so far. He swallowed heavily and looked back at Sherlock. “This- This is where you live?” He said and Sherlock blushed heavily with a soft nod. Sherlock had of course told his parents they were coming, and they had been over the moon, telling Sherlock they would prepare all sorts of things. Sherlock had told them to try to keep it down a bit and that John was very shy. Which John wasn't really in person, but in this situation, he was. Sherlock opened his door and got out, walking around to the other side and helping John out. “Thanks.” John said and smiled crookedly, taking a deep breath and clearing his throat before starting to walk towards the house with Sherlock.
“”Yeah yeah, we're good. Fine. Very good. I'm glad to hear the party was good. I'm sorry I'm not there to help you clean up. JW”” John apologised, rubbing his forehead.
“I’m not sure, to be honest, it doesn’t seem like it. Seems Mr. Holmes is quite protective over this android and he won’t let anyone else take over him unless he deems the person fitting enough. He’s been quite adamant that that person should be you,” Ella explained and John raised a curious eyebrow.
Come lunch time, John and Mike walked into the cafeteria, grabbing a sandwich and some chips for lunch along with some fruit and a drink as well. “There he is, Sherlock!” John called, seeing the tall young man sit beside a window, reading a book. Sherlock looked up quickly and smiled. “John, Mike.” He said with a soft nod as the two sat down by the same table. John frowned. “Aren't you eating? Or have you already finished?” John asked and began eating his overfilled sandwich. Sherlock wrinkled his nose a bit. “Not a fan of school lunches really.” He said with a shrug. John chuckled. “You can have some of my chips if you want.” John said and pushed the tray towards Sherlock, trying to use the same tactics as he had used in the pizzeria. Sherlock nodded, picking a chip up and dipping it in ketchup, chewing slowly. It was definitely not the greatest, but it was decent enough to eat. “So, I was just telling John that everything is set up for tomorrow. Just need to fetch some thing earlier in the day. You're coming, right Sherlock?” Mike said and smiled at him. Sherlock nodded. “Yes, I'll be there.” He said and looked up at John, smiling a little. Mike beamed. “Great! The more the merrier.” Mike said and chomped down onto his sandwich, not having the best table manners in the world. John took a few sips of his drink, looking at Sherlock. “So did you get home alright? Last night I mean? It was a bit late after all, I hope you didn't get into any trouble.” John said and bit his lip. Sherlock quickly blushed, looking down, remembering all the fuss his parents had created around him. He shook his head. “No, they were fine. My parents I mean, they were... fine. Good. Happy.” Sherlock said and nodded. “They... They want to invite you over for tea sometime. You- You don't have to agree, of course, they're just being silly anyway...” Sherlock murmured quickly. John smiled and blushed, frowning a little. “Me? For tea? Why on earth would they want that?” He said and chuckled, looking over at Mike before looking back at Sherlock. Sherlock shrugged, stroking a curl behind his ear. “Well I told them... That you helped me... With the shirt and things and they wanted to do something nice back...” Sherlock said and swallowed. John blushed even more. “Oh, uh, alright. I mean, why not?” John said and shrugged. “I'll come over for tea.” He agreed with a nod, taking another bite of his sandwich. Sherlock's eyes widened. “You will? Oh... They'll be thrilled. I'm warning you though... They can be a bit much sometimes.” Sherlock said and sighed softly. John nodded. “I'm sure it's nothing I can't handle.” He smiled. “I could come after school today? I don't have anything to prepare for tomorrow, Mike is more excited for my party than I am I think, so he's got us covered besides the few things we need to prepare tomorrow.” John chuckled. Sherlock smiled wider and nodded quickly. “After school. Perfect. We end at the same time and Daniel will be here to pick us up.” Sherlock decided before John had a chance to change his mind. John looked down at himself. “I'm not really dressed right for the occasion, I think...” He said, looking at his old blue checkered shirt with a plain but clean white t-shirt underneath. He bit his lip. “Maybe if I button my shirt up I will look more presentable...” John said and looked back up at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled and nodded. “I doubt my parents would care even if you would come dressed in hotpants and a flamingo top. I think you'll be quite surprised by what they're really like.” Sherlock said with a cheeky grin, stealing another chip from John's plate, John blushing and Mike laughing heartily at the mental image of John wearing those things.
“Sherlock- You’re very strong you know-” John croaked out and Sherlock lessened the pressure, but only very slightly, still keeping himself tangled around John and as close as possible.
When John woke up, he was somewhere else. Somewhere not familiar. John blinked his eyes open, looking around the fairly dimly lit room. He was laying in a comfy bed, the covers wrapped tightly around him as if he had been tucked in by someone. The more he came too though, the more a sense of uneasiness started to creep in. Where the hell was he? John flinched as a sliding door suddenly opened and a poshly dressed man walked into the room, using what seemed like an umbrella as a cane.
John laid back onto his pillow, not caring if he got crumbs all over himself. What good would a doctor be without good biology knowledge? At least he knew were all the internal organs were... Sort of. He groaned a little to himself once more, looking to his phone as it vibrated.
“Mate, you know you can tell me anything yeah? I know we were never really that close but we were more than just acquaintances, and I care about you. But if you don’t want to talk about it, I understand. Maybe eventually you will, maybe never. Also, I think the android idea is great. I use a lot of them at my clinic to help patients. Mostly with company and comfort. Had I known you were open to them too I would’ve invited you to come see some for yourself sooner-”
“I do! John- uh, Dr. Watson makes the best tea for me. Lots of sugar in it, just how I like it,” Sherlock said as he picked up the croissant and took a big bite. Mike grinned.
John said pointedly, Ella struggling to keep in a giggle. Sherlock shook his head, his curls bouncing freely.
“”Yes. Well. You might've proved me wrong about that. Even if just a little. SH”” Sherlock wrote back, laying down onto his pillows.
“Not really, no. I’ve gotten used to it though… A bit,” John cleared his throat. “But uhm… Now that you’re here, maybe being around someone isn’t too bad,” John smiled and Sherlock blushed, smiling to himself.
Sorry this took such a long time, I started a new education and it's eating up a lot of time. I have every intention to finish this story, so please stay with me. It'll just take a bit longer than I had first thought.
“I’m sorry for leaving the flat when you told me not to…” He murmured and John sighed, rubbing his neck a little.
A very robotic voice was heard escaping Sherlock’s lips, without actually forming his lips to pronounce John’s name. John nodded quickly.
Sherlock stomped in his steps, heading towards the next classroom. “No John! You are being unfair!” Sherlock yelled but soon enough, John managed to catch up to them. He took Sherlock's hand, stopping him in his steps. “I'm sorry.” John said and stroke Sherlock's hand with his thumb. “I'm sorry okay? I... I am happy for you. Of course I want you to be excited about us. I was just shocked because we talked about-” “Well like Molly said she already knew I liked you. And I was just excited to tell her that it finally happened.” Sherlock said and looked into John's eyes. “What happened?” Suddenly a voice was heard, and both John and Sherlock's heads turned to the side. Mike. John swallowed and Sherlock quickly glanced over at him. “I... I finally got into the ballet school I wanted to get into.” Sherlock said quickly, making John frown a little. “Ballet?” John and Mike said in unison and Sherlock nodded. “Yes, ballet. Dancing. I do that in my freetime.” Sherlock said and held his head up high. Mike smiled. “Oh, well uh, congrats then.” He said and patted Sherlock's shoulder. John was still holding onto Sherlock's hand though, a bit dumbfounded by that. If it was a lie, it was a pretty good lie since Sherlock was keeping a straight face rather easily. The three of them stood there rather awkwardly before Mike spotted another friend, hurrying over to him. John looked at Sherlock, tilting his head. “You are pretty good at lying, perhaps I should be concerned.” John said with a soft smile playing on his lips. Sherlock blushed, pulling his hand back from John's. “I /wasn't/ lying, John. I do dance ballet in my freetime. I just didn't get into any fancy school. That was a lie.” Sherlock said and started walking away again. John sighed. “Hey, you... You didn't have to do that.” John said and took Sherlock's hand once more. Sherlock shrugged. “What was the other option then? Telling him the truth and having you freaking out on me again? I'm tired of that John.” Sherlock said truthfully and John nodded. “You're... You're right and I'm sorry that you are. I just don't want anything bad to happen...” John murmured. Sherlock sighed in frustration and shook his head. “Nothing bad will happen, John. Nothing. I promise.” Sherlock said sincerely. John didn't believe that one bit, but he nodded his head. “Okay...” He mumbled and Sherlock's gaze trailed away from John. “You don't believe me. I can tell. But I would never allow something bad to happen to you John. Never.” Sherlock said and placed a gentle hand on John's chest. “I would never allow it.” He said softly and looked back up into John's eyes. John bit his lip, nodding his head once more. “I know you wouldn't.” He said, though doubted Sherlock would be able to hold that promise. He placed his hand over Sherlock's that was on his chest, holding it there for a moment, not realising Mike was watching from afar. Mike frowned, walking back up to them. “What's going on?” He said with a frown. Sherlock blushed, quickly removing his hand. John shrugged. “Not much, just talking to Sherlock.” John said and bit his lip. Mike frowned deeper. “Didn't look like just talking to me. You- You looked like something out of one of those cheesy romantic films on the telly that I'd rather would punch a wall instead of watching.” Mike muttered. “It didn't look like that to me.” Molly said quickly, trying to distract him. “Well I suppose you should find a suitable wall then, preferably one with padding. Because I'm with Sherlock now. Hope that's alright with you. And sometimes, yeah, we'll look and behave like those people you hate in cheesy romantic films, so don't punch too many holes in your wall yeah?” John said and took Sherlock's hand. “Come on Sherl, I need a snack.” John said and squeezed Sherlock's hand tightly, giving a rather shocked Mike a glance back before heading straight ahead to the cafeteria.
“Now, loading,” Sherlock said out loud before closing his eyes, willing himself to rest. He had a lot going through his mind, and he was worried about Dr Watson as well. It was strange that he already worried for the human, but he had been very anxious about Sherlock being around when he slept. And although he wouldn’t attempt to kill Dr Watson in his sleep, as they had already established, he couldn’t help but think that it would’ve been better if they had slept in the same room. Now he was too far away, especially since Dr Watson’s file had stated he had issues with nightmares and other nightly terrors. Sherlock sighed. Complicated human. Sherlock hummed in thought.
John closed his eyes as well. A nap couldn’t hurt and it was still quite early in the afternoon. He felt himself getting more and more tired as the adrenaline from everything that had happened slowly left his body, and soon he was sleeping soundly with his arms tucked around Sherlock, holding him tightly in his sleep.
Sherlock followed the shopkeeper along with Mycroft, frowning as the old man pottered about. “Ah, here we might have something.” The shopkeeper said and presented them both with a big basket of old rugby memorabilia. “A lot of it is broken and worn unfortunately, but I think an avid rugby fan will find it interesting anyway. Have a poke around and just come to the register when you've settled on something.” The man said kindly and left the brother's alone.
“Right. We need a pan, a little bit of oil, some eggs, salt and pepper, and another pan for the sausages. I like cooking them separately.” John hummed and began gathering everything he needed. “And we need some sausage too of course.” He smiled and got everything he needed from the fridge. Sherlock stood a bit awkwardly beside John before deciding to hop up on the counter and sit up there to watch over John while he was cooking. John smiled. “Good view of the pan action?” He asked and Sherlock smirked and nodded. “Mhm, very good.” He said, though his eyes were more fixed at John rather than the pan. John put the sausages on first before starting on the scrambled eggs, humming softly to himself. “Only Harry is home, so we have the kitchen basically to ourselves.” John said, both reassuring himself and Sherlock. Sherlock nodded and swung his feet just a little, watching John handle the cooking. John really looked like he knew what he was doing, Sherlock thought, and it was starting to smell good already. Soon enough, a sleepy Harry walked into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes. “'Morning.” She grumbled softly and went to the kettle to put it on. “Good morning Harry.” Sherlock said with the biggest grin. Harry, the sister who helped John to realise that perhaps being close to Sherlock wasn't so bad. Harry smiled a little at Sherlock and nodded. “Good morning Sherlock, did you sleep well?” She asked and John glanced over at her with a look telling her to please behave and not reveal their conversation from last night. Sherlock nodded. “I did. I slept very well. John's bed is quite comfortable.” Sherlock said and chuckled a little. John blushed and cleared his throat, stirring the eggs around. Harry smirked, enjoying seeing her brother under the spotlight and so very nervous. She leaned against the fridge with her arms crossed. “Mmm, it is quite comfortable. But not many people get to feel how comfortable it is. You should consider yourself lucky Sherlock.” She said with a smirk and a wink. Sherlock blushed and nodded. “I'm very lucky.” Sherlock replied and looked at John, who was looking back at him with a soft smile. “Am I getting some breakfast too?” Harry asked and John rolled his eyes. “Yeah, of course you are. Unlike you I think about other people as well and not just myself.” He teased and stuck his tongue out at her. “Mmm, but unlike you I don't sleep with other boys in my bed.” She teased back and left the kitchen to go to the living room. John blushed heavily and turned the sausages around in the pan. Sherlock sighed. That wasn't much of a help now was it. “John... It's alright... She didn't mean it like that-” “I know what she meant Sherlock.” John interrupted him quickly. “And... It's fine. She's just like that...” John brushed it off and began plating up the eggs for the three of them. “Besides... She didn't mean anything bad... She just meant... Sod it.” John said, trying to be open about it all but failing to find the words. Sherlock smiled and hopped off the counter. “She just meant that anything is fine by her. And it's fine by me too. And I'm always here for you John.” Sherlock said softly before taking a plate and carrying it to the living room where Harry was waiting for them. John stood still by the stove, turning all the hobs off. It was fine by Sherlock too. And he was always there for him as well. John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Everything was fine, even the fact that he had spent the night with Sherlock in his bed, and most of the morning with his arms wrapped around him. He needed to understand all of this more. He needed to somehow talk to Sherlock about it. He grabbed the two plates that were left for him and Sherlock and headed to the living room.
“Right let's get going then.” John said as they joined up with everyone, a few of the team members eyeing Sherlock. A few of the blokes had their girlfriends with them, and some had their best friends coming along as well. Everyone seemed to be curious about who invited Sherlock and why. John frowned. “I said, let's go. Since when don't you listen to your captain.” John smirked and winked, making the team laugh and start walking. Sometimes he was glad he could manage to be charismatic enough to get his will through. John smiled back at Sherlock, making sure he was okay. “Did you text anyone at home so they know you'll be late? That your /ride/ will have to pick you up later?” John said pointedly. Sherlock frowned. “I... I texted my older brother, he knows. And... I don't always have a ride home John.” He said, thought that was pretty much a lie. He usually did. “Is there a problem with that?” He asked, quite confused and a bit miffed about John bugging him about that. John chuckled and shook his head. “I suppose not. I was just teasing you a bit.” John said and smiled as two of this teammates burst out laughing, everyone being in a very good mood after their successful game.
“Mike was really nice,” Sherlock noted with a nod and a soft smile. “He wasn’t as bad as I first thought, I’m sorry I was a bit hostile… I should’ve trusted you,” Sherlock nodded and looked at John, still smiling softly. John nodded and started cleaning the dishes.
John soon came back with the bag and sat back down, Mike and Molly eyeing them from the kitchen area which was not too far away from the living room. “Right.” John said and pulled up the neatly wrapped box. His eyes widened a bit. “Did you wrap this? It's amazing. A bow and everything.” John said, quite impressed and even more red in the face now. He couldn't remember last time he had received such a nicely wrapped gift. Sherlock nodded. “I... I did wrap it. I'm glad you like it.” He said shyly and curled up a bit on the sofa, watching as John opened it carefully. John got into the box and slowly pushed away the thin decorative paper that kept it safe. “Well, what is it then?” Mike called from the kitchen, curious to see what Sherlock had bought. John blushed deeply. “It's... It's an old rugby ball.” John managed to get out, his eyes wide as he looked at the old piece of sporting equipment. It looked very old. And it was very beautiful. “I... Sherlock... That's so thoughtful of you...” John said softly, running his hand over the old leather. “I can't believe you did something like this for me.” John said and glanced up at Sherlock, who's cheeks were now matching John's shade of red. “I... I just wanted to give you something nice. You only turn eighteen once...” Sherlock said softly, smiling. The reaction on John's face was far better than anything he could've ever wished for, and his heart was very warm. “You can pick it up, it might be old but it's still sturdy.” Sherlock said softly and John nodded, gently picking it up and holding it in his hands. He turned it over, and his eyes widened further.
John glared at Victor the whole time, making sure he really left before turning to Sherlock. “Are you alright? Are you okay? He didn't manage to touch you did he? Come, let's go somewhere else where it isn't so loud.” John said and took Sherlock's hand. Sherlock stumbled as he began to walk, his whole body stiff, tears prickling in his eyes. That had been awful. Just... Just awful. He felt so vulnerable and horrible and then- then John had been there to save him. And John protected him. Sherlock was so conflicted. He felt like bawling his eyes out, his heart beating way too quickly, and on the other hand he felt so loved and protected by John that he just wanted to smile the brightest smile he could. Sadly, he was leaning more towards the bawling his eyes out part, and after John had shooed some kissing couple out of Mike's bedroom and they were alone, that is just what he did. Heavy tears began trickling down his cheeks and John quickly sat Sherlock down on the bed and sat down beside him. “Shh, shh it's okay. God that fucking bastard I should've punched him square in the face.” John said and stroke Sherlock's back before gently embracing him, wanting to make sure hugging him was okay right now. And God it was okay. So okay that Sherlock quickly moved closer, almost placing himself on John's lap. He buried his face against John's shoulder and cried, trying not to make too much noise. John sighed softly and stroke Sherlock's curls gently with his hand. “I'm so so sorry Sherlock. I should've noticed it sooner. I should've been with you the whole time. Stupid sodding Mike it's his fault. He wanted me to be a stupid wingman and chat up that bird just so he could have a chance with her.” John muttered and reached for a blanket, wrapping it around Sherlock since the tall young man had begun to shiver quite violently. “Sherlock, try to take deep breaths for me okay? It's over. He's gone. He won't even dare to get close to you after that I promise.” John said and Sherlock let out a sob, nodding his head. John hadn't been chatting that girl up for his sake, it was for Mike. Sherlock tried to be happy for that too, but he just couldn't seem to stop crying. There was a gentle knock on the door before Mike opened it just a little. “Are you two okay? I saw what happened... I just wanted to check... Do you need anything?” Mike asked and John smiled a little. “Yeah we're fine. Some water and some tissues would be nice.” John said and Mike nodded, quickly closing the door again. “Come here, let's make ourselves a bit more comfy. I feel rather done with this party myself anyway.” John said and began to gently scoot back on Mike's bed towards the pillows. He propped the pillows up nicely before leaning back onto them, stretching out a bit and still holding Sherlock in his arms. He took the remote control from the nightstand and turned on the telly, finding some mind-numbing crap telly show that they could have on in the background to help them relax a bit. It took a while, but soon Mike came back with tissues, two cups of tea, two cups of water and two slices of cake before disappearing just as quickly. John smiled. “This room service is better than any hotel I've ever been to at least.” He said and chuckled, trying to lighten the mood a little.
The warm-ups had already started when Sherlock arrived at the field and he quickly hurried up onto the bleachers to find a good spot. He settled on a spot in the middle row a bit too the side, not wanting to be too close to other people. He looked around with a wrinkle of his nose. No, this was definitely not his type of crowd. He sighed, resting his head on his hands as he looked over the field, trying to spot John.
The match was quite exciting, even Sherlock thought so, now that he had someone he wanted to cheer on and win. Molly was giggling from time to time as Sherlock shouted, covering her mouth so that Sherlock wouldn't see. When the final signal went, and it was clear that the home team had won, Sherlock stood up from the bleachers, clapping his hands and cheering like everyone else did. Maybe this wasn't too bad after all. He watched John run a victory lap along with his mates, laughing and grinning from ear to ear. Sherlock smiled to himself. John looked wonderful when he was happy. He blushed, wishing he could go down and congratulate him.
Sherlock stood outside of the door to Mike's house, shifting a little bit from side to side. He bit his lip, he was so nervous. He had never been this nervous in his entire life. Mycroft had dropped him off, telling him some last pieces of brotherly advice, yet here he stood, unable to move right now. He held a bag which contained the wrapped gift for John. He had placed the old rugby ball in a shoe box, thinking that would be the easiest way to wrap it. He sighed and looked up at the house, trying to see if there was any other people inside. He heard some noises, but it didn't seem too crowded just yet. He cleared his throat. “Right.” He murmured to himself. He was dressed very elegantly, sporting his very tight dark purple shirt and some tight black jeans. He had corrected his curls for hours in front of the mirror and he finally got them to lay right. He extended his hand to knock on the door, but lowered it quickly, deciding to stand there for a while longer. As if that would help the nerves.
John hurried downstairs after exactly half an hour, not wanting to be early nor late. He quickly took his seat, keeping his head down. He didn't want any more of that treatment this evening, so he tried being as quiet as possible during dinner. Most of the dinner was silent, and when they were done, Harry and John helped each other with clearing off the table and doing the dishes, knowing that was the best option when their father was like this. Mr. Watson limped back to the living room, turning on the telly to watch the news. Mrs. Watson was biting a bit on her lip, always a bit worried and distressed in these situations. “Thank you loves. You can go back upstairs and I'll bring you a treat later.” She murmured quietly, always getting a bit soft when she knew it was likely that both of her children had been scolded in some way. John nodded and Harry did too and they both quickly hurried upstairs. “So, he got to you too then?” John murmured and Harry nodded with a sigh. “Yup.” She answered quietly.
“Sherlock?” John said, running down the street. He frowned. “Are you... smoking?” He said, wrinkling his nose in disgust. “What's it to you?” Sherlock huffed, blowing out some smoke from the corner of his mouth. John shrugged. “Well first of all, it's very unflattering, second of all, I thought you were smart enough not to smoke, and thirdly, I don't want my clothes to smell like smoke because I will go through hell when I come home if they do.” John said firmly. Sherlock blushed a bit. He had forgotten he was wearing John's shirt. He quickly dropped the cigarette and stomped on it, turning around. “Sorry...” He murmured, looking at John. John sighed. “It's... It's alright just, I'm sorry for Mike's behaviour. And I really don't think that about you. So you have more money than the average bloke our age, so what? As long as you don't boast about it, which you don't, it shouldn't matter that you do. I'm fine with it alright?” John said, though it was a little bit of a white lie. Knowing how little he and his family had made him feel a pang of irritation and jealousy in his chest from Sherlock having more. Sherlock thought about what John said for a moment before nodding. “Except it does bother you. I can see it in your eyes John. I'm sorry that your money and family situation is not the best, but I would ask you to not take it out on me.” Sherlock said firmly. John frowned. “Excuse me? Take it out on you? Since when the fuck did I take it out on you?” John said, losing his temper since Sherlock was doing that person reading thing again, and stating something that just wasn't true. Sherlock swallowed. “Well you- well you haven't yet but you did call me a rich snob and push me that one time!” Sherlock argued. John let out a huff which was more like a sarcastic laugh. “Oh so that is the definition of taking it out on you then? Haven't I been treating you nice the whole bloody evening hmm? Haven't I stayed by your side this whole time huh? Haven't I given you my clothes so that you wouldn't be a mess after what happened?” John yelled. “I don't deserve this. I've only treated you with kindness and now you are pissed at me for something MIKE bloody said! Not me! I didn't say those things!” John argued. “But you do agree with them!” Sherlock yelled back. John huffed. “No I bloody don't! Stop telling me what I do and what I don't okay?! Yeah! So what if I'm a bit ticked off that you have more money than me and my family! So what Sherlock! I'm not holding it against you and you have no business thinking that you know what my personal life is like!” John yelled, his voice a bit broken. Sherlock looked at John, both of them panting from being upset and yelling. “Maybe... Maybe you should just go yeah? I think we're done here.” John said coldly and looked at Sherlock. Sherlock swallowed heavily. “I... John wait I-” “No I don't want to hear it Sherlock.” John interrupted him quickly. He turned around and started to walk back to the pizzeria. Sherlock looked down at his feet. He'd blown it, /again/. How did he manage to do that? They where having such a lovely time... Why did he have to get emotional? He knew deep inside that John probably was right, that he didn't agree with what Mike said nor that he would tease Sherlock for being wealthier, but his own instinct was to protect himself as soon as something felt wrong. “John! Your shirt-” Sherlock stuttered. “Keep it!” John yelled and waved, entering the pizzeria, slamming the door behind him.
“So... Can I count on you coming as well?” John said finally after Mike had gone off to speak to another friend before he would leave. Sherlock let out a deep breath of relief. He had waited for John to ask him that for what felt like forever, and he was thrilled that it finally happened, even if it was after an awkward moment they'd had together. “Yes. Yes I'll be there.” Sherlock said and nodded firmly, biting his lip a bit. John smiled. “Good.” He said and grabbed his duffel bag. “I'll see you tomorrow at school then?” John said and began walking to his bus stop. Sherlock nodded again but then quickly shook his head. “My- My ride will be here soon. You... You can get a ride home if you'd like. Then you won't have to wait for the bus.” Sherlock suggested quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. Did he really offer John a ride home in the car the blonde young man had pointed out several times as something only a snob would use? Maybe it was ridiculous, but he wanted to do something nice for John this evening after everything he had done for him, and right now this was the only thing he could think of. John smiled, tilting his head, seeing the different emotions dance over Sherlock's face. “Alright then. I'll take you up on that offer. It's bloody ages until my bus arrives anyway.” John lied, knowing it was only ten minutes or so before the next bus. He walked up to Sherlock, waving at Mike and the other's before heading down the road with him.
John put his clothes on swiftly, starting to look through the book before dinner. A knock at the door startled him though, and he sighed softly. “Who is it? I'm studying.” John said and leaned his head onto his hand. Mr. Watson opened the door, and John stiffened a little. “Good. I heard that is just what you need.” Mr. Watson said with a stern voice, sitting down in the chair by John's desk. John swallowed. “Yeah... This is a good book...” John mumbled quietly. Mr. Watson nodded, his expression changing quickly as he shifted positions to lean forward a bit. “Now you listen to me, I work a shitty job so I can keep this family afloat, and I'm not doing it to see my son fail, do you hear me?” Mr. Watson hissed. John nodded softly. “Yes dad.” He said but Mr. Watson huffed. “Yes... Sir.” John said and nodded a little once again. “That's better.” He said with a grumble in his voice. “I didn't leave for the army just to come home and be called 'dad' and what have you.” Mr. Watson said and stood up, limping slightly. “And I didn't get sent home a fool. I was injured.” He continued and John nodded, knowing the story all too well. “You are going to be a doctor John. That's all I'm asking of you. And if I hear you start whining about you being a so called 'captain' of your rugby team, then so help me God I will make sure you won't be able to play ever again.” He growled, standing close the bed now. “Is that understood?” He said and glared at John. John nodded. “Yes sir.” He said, feeling the alcohol on his father's breath. He started early today. Mr. Watson nodded. “Good. Good.” He said and patted John's shoulder. “Dinner will be ready in half an hour.” He said, and left John's bedroom.
John was standing and stretching after having done a running warm-up, looking out onto the field. “J-John?” Sherlock stuttered, instantly bashing himself in his mind for sounding so pitiful. John quickly turned around and sighed. “I'm kinda busy you know.” He said and turned the other way, pulling his leg up to his chest to stretch it a bit. Sherlock watched curiously. John was more flexible than he thought. He quickly shook his head. “I- I know but- But I wanted to talk to you before the game starts. It's... It's important.” He said and bit his lip. John dropped his leg and turned around to face Sherlock again. “And what makes you think I want to listen, Sherlock? It... It hurt alright? What you said... You're not even supposed to know those things.” John said, his voice upset, yet still soft. Sherlock looked down a bit. “I... I'm truly sorry John. I really am. Just... Just hear me out, just this once, please?” He said and looked pleadingly back up at John. John sighed and crossed his arms, tilting his head to the side. “Fine. Go on then.” He muttered. Sherlock straightened up and cleared his throat a bit. Right. Remember what Mycroft said. Stay calm, being the most important one. “No one told me those things about you John. Not Mike, not your parents, not anyone. I... I knew because I observed. I can't really explain to you how it works because I can't understand it myself, but when I look at certain people I just... /know/.” Sherlock said, looking into John's eyes, being as sincere as he possibly could. John frowned. “You just /know/?” John said, trying to understand. Sherlock nodded. “I look at you and I see certain things, I can deduce certain things. I didn't know what I said was hurtful, I was merely telling you what I saw. I can most definitely promise you that I didn't mean to hurt you with what I said. I promise you that, and I am very, very sorry.” Sherlock finished quietly. John looked at Sherlock, remembering what Mike had said; that Sherlock didn't want to hurt him with his words. Maybe Mike was right then. It all sounded very strange though, but Sherlock looked so sincere... John exhaled heavily. “Fine.” He said and nodded. “I... I understand. I think. It sounds strange, but I understand. Next time, just, try not to blurt things out like that yeah?” John said and Sherlock nodded quickly, a small smile tugging at his lips. John understood, sort of. And even if it sounded strange, John still understood and wasn't angry at his explanation. He could feel his heart starting to beat normally once again. “And I accept your apology.” John added with a soft smile, which practically melted Sherlock completely. John accepted his apology. Sherlock smiled and found himself letting out a soft giggle, quickly covering his mouth and flushing a deep red colour. John snorted softly with a smile. He found Sherlock looking quite adorable like that, though he didn't really understand why he felt that way. “Right then... Do you promise to cheer us on?” John asked, smiling crookedly at Sherlock. Sherlock nodded quickly. “Of- Of course-” He murmured from underneath his hands. John nodded. “Good. See you later then, Sherlock.” John smiled and winked cheekily before running out onto the field.
Sherlock sighed, sitting down to sip his tea and nibble on a biscuit. He wasn't really hungry since he had eaten a lot more of the pizza than he had first planned to, but he was polite enough to have at least a little bit of tea and a biscuit. “I'm sorry if I'm not too cheerful right now... I... I really did have a good time. Except for a few mishaps...” He murmured. Mr. Holmes nodded. “Well that's understandable, it was your first time out like this after all, it's alright to have some mishaps.” He explained. Sherlock nodded. “I just... I have a bad feeling in my tummy... When- When I left John by his house-” Sherlock began but stopped quickly when Mrs. Holmes quickly looked at him. “John? Is that the young man who borrowed you his shirt? Oh, lovely! Now we have a name to this friend of yours.” She grinned eagerly and looked to her husband who nodded. “Continue with your story Sherlock, what happened?” He said patiently. Sherlock nodded. “When we dropped him off by his house he started acting all strange... He was rushing and- and he barely said good bye.” Sherlock murmured. “I don't know if I did anything wrong. He was fine the whole car ride there, but in a split second he was just... almost frightened in a way.” Sherlock mumbled. Mycroft stood in the kitchen as well leaning against the kitchen wall, looking over at Sherlock. Of course he had snooped around Sherlock's room once his brother had left, finding out that his /love/ interest or whatever he was, was indeed someone named John Watson. He had done some research and found out about John's father and the fact that he had been high up in the military but had been sent home due to injuries. He had deduced some other bits here and there, but there was still a few blanks. But what Sherlock said did spark a tinge of worry in his mind as well. Mrs. Holmes smiled and stroke Sherlock's hand encouragingly. “I'm sure he's fine Sherlock. Maybe he was just in a hurry. He realised how late it was and he needed to hurry inside. That's all there is to it I'm sure.” She said softly. Sherlock sighed. He knew that couldn't be it, and he remembered what he had said to John the first time he had deduced him. /Must be difficult having a father who doesn't want you to play sports and is taking his suppressed anger out on his family and his drinking habits./. Sherlock shivered and hoped whatever the cause was for John's sudden hurry wasn't something related to that.
Sherlock laid down in the bed, making sure he wasn’t more than one meter away from the WallBox, and a soft chiming noise was heard.
Mike smiled a little. “”Well, the headache I have is something quite impressive, but otherwise my memory is fine thank you. I'll see you tomorrow then for class? MS””
“No, power save mode. I don’t need to load…” Sherlock mumbled, looking over at the breakfast on the table. He sat down before saying another word, grabbing the cup of tea and cradling it in his hands. John smiled, sitting down as well and started to eat his breakfast.
John slowly entered the bedroom, balancing everything on the tray. “Are you asleep again?” He asked softly, Sherlock stirring in the bed. “Nooo...” He said innocently, sitting up, blushing when he saw the spread John had prepared. There were toast with marmalade, cheese, lettuce and ham, and two steaming mugs of tea. “My favourite cup... You noticed...” Sherlock mumbled when John came close, blushing. John smiled and nodded. “Of course I noticed.” He said proudly with a grin, folding out the legs and placing it over Sherlock's lap. “There, breakfast fit for a king. Or a prince.” He said a winked cutely before getting back into bed slowly as to not disturb any of the contents on the tray. Sherlock smiled and blushed even more. “John... This is so nice... You didn't have to...” He said and moved close to John, stroking his cheek gently. John blushed and looked at Sherlock shyly. “Well... I just wanted to do something nice to you... It's the first time I've slept over here, with you.” He hummed and kissed Sherlock's cheek. “Go on then, let's eat up so we can have some extra snuggle time before school.” John said and smiled widely, taking a piece of toast.
After breakfast, they soon bid Mike good bye for now since he had to hurry back to the clinic and John started clearing up and Sherlock followed him closely behind.
He moved a little closer, gently brushing his arm against John's. “I like your room. It's very cozy due to it's smaller size.” Sherlock said, trying to distract John with some small talk while he tried to slowly cuddle closer. John chuckled. “Yeah, it is pretty cozy isn't it? I especially like that I can dim the ceiling light so if I want just a little- What are you doing?” John interrupted himself after going out on a tangent about his ceiling light when he realised Sherlock was about to snuggle against his chest. “Uh... There uhm... Was a bump on the bed. Uncomfortable. Better here.” Sherlock said quickly and cleared his throat. He placed his head against John's chest closing his eyes. John frowned. “Bump on the- Oh... Yeah it's uhm... It's a bit bumpy on that side... Forgot to tell you, sorry.” John said, quickly playing along. Sherlock smirked to himself, glad John wouldn't be able to see it. There wasn't a bump on the bed for miles of course, but John had fallen for his trick. John swallowed heavily. So... What now? And what on earth would he do with his arms? John swallowed thickly and yawned, doing the old 'yawn and stretch', but instead of stretching his arm behind Sherlock's back while sitting on a sofa, he gently stretched his arm and placed it around Sherlock's back while the other was snuggled up so close to him. Right. This would do.... right? John immediately closed his eyes, knowing that his whole face was probably red, that he hadn't got a clue what he was doing and that he probably would jump out the window if he looked into Sherlock's eyes and was questioned about what he was actually doing.
Later that day, John was finishing up rugby practice, meeting Mike in the changing room. “Christ that Sherlock bloke really has an attitude doesn't he?” John said with a huff. Mike chuckled. “Really? I've heard he's mostly quiet. Maybe he just doesn't get along with your face.” Mike laughed and tossed a towel in John's face. John growled. “What's wrong with my face? I'm perfectly fine looking.” He muttered and pulled on his boxers underneath his towel that was tied neatly around his waist. Mike smirked. “Yeah yeah, and when was the last time you had a date then hmm?” Mike teased. John rolled his eyes. “Lay off it alright? And it wasn't that long ago, mind you.” He said with another huff, pulling on his t-shirt.
Sherlock was stunned as John practically dragged him down the hallway. His cheeks were red, and he held onto John's hand so tightly he was afraid he would hurt him with his nails. Molly rushed after them, not too far behind, and Mike was still just standing frozen in place, unsure of what to do with himself. Sherlock started biting his lip, not sure if John was mad, or upset, or if he truly was okay. He realised there was no other way to find that out than to just ask him. “Are- Are you mad?” He asked John as they stopped just as they entered the cafeteria. John was panting heavily, and he looked up at Sherlock when he came to stand before him. Their hands were still clasped tightly, Sherlock not wanting to let go in case John would just set off in another direction, afraid he would never see the other again if he did. John slowed his breathing, shaking his head eventually. “No, I'm not mad. I'm not mad, Sherlock.” John said, looking up at Sherlock softly. “I'm not mad, and I'm not upset.” He said, straightening up a bit better. Sherlock squirmed shyly and blushed. “O-Okay... So... You're fine, then? Perhaps?” Sherlock asked worriedly, still biting on his lip. John put a hand on Sherlock's arm, stroking it gently as a soft smile spread over his lips. “Yeah, yeah I'm fine.” John said and nodded his head. “Are you fine, though?” John asked, getting a bit worried now when he saw the  blush on Sherlock's cheek and the biting of his lip. Sherlock nodded quickly. “Yeah, yes, yes I'm fine too.” Sherlock said and smiled a little as well. “What... The thing you did... What you said to Mike that... That was sweet in an uhm, angry sort of way...” Sherlock said shyly. John hadn't really spoken sweetly about the two of them, but he knew John meant it in a sweet way deep down, though it had come off a bit angrily since he had been nervous to tell Mike all about it. John nodded. “Yeah... I know... Sorry... I was just nervous and worried and- well, Mike was being a bit of an arse too really. He's usually not like that. I think he was just a bit confused and shocked. He isn't like that you know, he couldn't care less who loves who as long as they are happy.” John promised and nodded his head once more, Sherlock nodding as well, showing that he understood.
John yawned, Harry's words fresh in his mind. He wasn't really sure what he would do about them yet, or what he felt, but he had decided to be more... accepting. And... open about things. “You don't have to curl up all the way on the other side of the bed you know...” John mumbled, shrugging. “You'll fall off the side if you do.” He said, just to have an excuse. Sherlock looked at John with wide eyes. Yes. Something had definitely changed. “Did you dream something special tonight?” Sherlock asked suddenly, inching just a little bit closer. John blushed and quickly shook his head. “No. Nope. Not what I remember at least.” John said and yawned once again. Sherlock nodded. So it wasn't a dream then... but it had to be something. “Did you manage to fall asleep soon after you told me you couldn't?” Sherlock asked, knowing there had to be something somewhere that had made an impact on John's behaviour.  John nodded. “Yeah, yeah after a bit... I fetched a glass of water and... and had a quick talk with Harry, but after that I fell asleep like a baby.” John murmured. Sherlock couldn't help but smile. Harry. John's sister. John's obviously lesbian sister had had a talk with John and now John was acting all sweet. God, he owed so much to John's sister after this. “That's nice.” Sherlock replied without saying anything else. He began to wonder what Harry had said to John, but he wouldn't press the matter of course.
“Where is it!! It’s here somewhere!! I’ll find it and I’ll end you!!” Sherlock growled out, his tinny voice sounding every louder and more hollow when his voice was raised. The other android looked frightened, and before he could resist, Sherlock had followed the immense electric pulse to the android’s neck and he pushed harshly, causing it to shut down. The grip the android had on Sherlock came loose and he laid on the floor motionless, Sherlock breathing heavily on top of him.
“This is- This- Mike-” John stuttered and Mike frowned, rushing towards him. Sherlock frowned at John's sudden change of expression. “Is- Is something wrong?” Sherlock said and looked at the ball. “Oh- God damnit! I should've looked at it before I bought it! I can't believe some imbecile has scribbled something on the back of it I-” “It's not an imbecile Sherlock-” Mike interrupted, his eyes just as wide as John's were. “It's autographed, by one of England's most highly regarded players. He... He wasn't the best player per say, but he was the English people's favourite player of all time for who he was as a person.” Mike explained, John unable to speak as his eyes started to water. Molly rushed to them as well, curious to see what all the fuss was about. “Sherlock-” John croaked a little and put the ball back in the box before pulling Sherlock into his arms, giving him the biggest  hug ever. Sherlock blushed, wrapping his arms around John, holding him as tightly as possible. “Thank you- Gosh- Just- Thank you-” John stuttered and held Sherlock so very tightly. Sherlock was blushing deeply now, burying his face against John's shoulder. He smiled brightly. “You're welcome John... I guess... I guess it was a lucky pick then.” Sherlock said and John began laughing at that, laughing out of happiness. He pulled back and Sherlock tried to disguise his sadness that the hug was over, watching as John dried his eyes and laughed some more. Sherlock was so unbelievably happy to see John so over the moon, and he struggled with finding words so he just smiled brightly back at John, giggling a little. “God you're amazing.” John said and looked at Sherlock, his eyes still watery and his face still red. “I need a beer to celebrate this.” John said and Mike quickly got beers for the four of them. John made sure to put the ball safely back in the box, disappearing quickly to hide it in Mike's bedroom for safekeeping during the party, before returning to the sofa, taking his bottle. “Cheers to Sherlock, and to one hell of a birthday.” John said and raised his bottle, Sherlock doing the same, all giddy and so very happy. “Cheers!” They all said as they brought their bottles together and then took a big sip, John smiling and winking at Sherlock, who giggled a little and tried not to make a face from the horrid taste of the beer.
Sherlock looked down into his bowl, twirling the pasta up on his fork once again. Maybe... “Did you want to try a bite?” Sherlock said, apprehensively holding up his fork for John. John looked at the fork, blushing a little. “Oh, uh, sure.” He said, but didn't expect being fed like this. He leaned forward and managed to take the whole bite in one go without making a mess of himself. “Mmm, that's delicious too.” He said, trying not to blush. He had just been fed by Sherlock bloody Holmes. He quickly looked down at his plate, composing a bite on his own fork with both fish and chip and a bit of sauce. “Here.” John said and held his fork out to Sherlock. “Your turn.” John smiled. Sherlock's eyes widened. He had definitely not expected that. Frankly, he hadn't even expected John to take his offered bite in the first place. “Oh-” Sherlock stuttered, quickly taking the bite as if he was scared it would go away, that John would change his mind. Sherlock covered his mouth quickly, letting out a soft giggle. John blushed and chuckled as well. “Was it too big?” He asked, tilting his head apologetically. Sherlock shook his head. “No, it was just right.” He mumbled with his mouthful, Mycroft rolling his eyes and feeling like vomiting from how giggly and silly the two were acting. But he couldn't help but feel happy for his brother as well, of course. Happy that he had found someone he could actually giggle and be silly with. Mycroft looked at his mother, who looked at him knowingly, giving him a pat on the hand, glad that he was coping and not making any mean comments.
“Sounds great… Thank you… You seem a bit… Lighter to your steps than when we last met,” Ella said pointedly and John blushed slightly. He sat down in his chair and gestured to the sofa for Ella, who still was looking at him closely to answer. John swallowed thickly and nodded, clutching his hands together.
Sherlock glanced at the paper and pen, but didn’t make a move to touch them. After a few minutes or so, Mike got called out and he was told to stay put, again. He wanted to go to John. He didn’t like it here alone. He wanted to be with John. It had been such a wonderful morning, John had smiled, when he wasn’t upset at him running off of course, and they had seen so many new things together. But now… He was stuck in this weird office with white plain walls and it reminded him of the lab he was usually kept in. It made his skin crawl. Sherlock flinched when the door was suddenly opened, and someone else entered. A man. An… Android. The other man smiled.
Not that it matters, but there hadn’t been a leak of any sort at Molly’s. Not that it mattered, but John had scolded her for lying to get him to come visit. Not that it mattered, but Molly had apologised and broken into tears when she explained how worried she was for him. Not that it mattered, but John had told her he was sorry, and that she didn’t have to worry because he had someone that looked after him.
Sherlock began to very gently dig and poke around the big pile of old rugby things, grabbing a fairly clean napkin to do so since he didn't fancy touching it all. “Old shoes mostly...” He murmured. “A few shirts... Ah!” Sherlock said suddenly, pulling up an old rugby ball. It was very squished and old looking, and the stitching on it was very frayed. “Do you think John would like this? Looks very old... But quite interesting.” Sherlock said, still holding it with the napkin. It was a very well made old rugby ball, and it looked very nice for it's age. Mycroft nodded. “I think it will be perfect.” He said with a soft smile. Sherlock grinned eagerly and bit his lip, rushing to the register. “We found this!” He said eagerly and the man smiled. “Oh, it's very tattered, he won't be playing much with that.” He said and winked. “But I'm sure he'll like it anyway. Just a few quids for that one, since the state of it is not so good.” He said and Sherlock paid the man, still grinning from ear to ear. “Thank you!” He said, visibly more happy now. The man chuckled. “Well, thank you! I hope he'll be very happy.” He said and winked. Sherlock blushed and nodded, taking the bag and rushing out of the shop, Mycroft following quickly behind.
“He does, does he now?” Mike smirked. Not open to them my arse, Mike thought to himself with a chuckle. The tips of John’s ears went pick and he cleared his throat as he plated up some eggs and sausage for Sherlock and Mike as well. Sherlock nodded.
Sorry this is a day late! I couldn't decide how to write the ending to this chapter, which you will see is very special indeed <3. And it turns out that today when I read it through, I wanted to change it, so it was a good thing I waited! I hope you'll love it just as much as I do! Have a wonderful rest of the week, and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone celebrating it!/NightOfFanfics
Sherlock had actually managed half of his portion of food and without much fuss, which had granted him a piece of chocolate cake. He was sitting in his room on his bed, legs crossed and reading a fictional novel. He sometimes liked to read those too, even though they were nonsense a lot of the time. He took a piece of chocolate cake, humming in delight. Even though he teased Mycroft frequently about the girth of his waist, he loved it when his brother baked cakes. He was quite amazing at it, though he would never really admit it to him in person. He frowned though as his phone suddenly buzzed, looking towards the clock on his nightstand.
Sherlock's eyes widened. “A date? An outside date? Like a real one? Just you and me?” He rambled and John nodded, chuckling a little. “Yes, sweetie, just you and me.” He spoke softly, cupping and rubbing Sherlock's cheek with his thumb. “Maybe we could go to the cinema, watch a film, like a classic date. But maybe that's boring...” John murmured and Sherlock quickly shook his head. “No- No not boring! Not boring at all I- I'd like that very much.” Sherlock breathed and nodded quickly. John beamed and nodded. “Great, then that's what we'll do.” He said and kissed Sherlock's nose, giggling a little. “I'll pop downstairs and make us some tea and sandwiches yeah?” John said and started to crawl out of bed. Sherlock sighed, reluctantly letting go. The spot where John had laid was so warm and cozy, and he quickly rolled over to it, snuggling up into a little ball. John smiled and pulled on his clothes, leaving the room with a soft sigh. He didn't really want to leave the bed either, but he knew that if they didn't get started, they weren't going to be in school anywhere near on time.
“John- Deep breaths alright? It’s fine, I think- I think Sherlock shut himself off. I saw him reaching for something on himself when I entered the room- I just don’t know what that does really- He’s not the same model- John? John!” Mike quickly put his arms underneath John’s as he collapsed to the floor. John’s breathing had only gotten quicker, his chest tightening with each breath, his knees went weak to the point that they couldn’t carry himself any longer and then it all went black.
I'm back! I will try to keep the updates more frequent again, hopefully once a day or something like that! I will try my best, thank you for waiting!!  This chapter is a longer one!! :)/NightOfFanfics
Meanwhile, not too far away, Sherlock was sitting by a desk, reading a few different books and taking notes. He instantly recognized John's voice, and was just as surprised to see him in the library as the librarian was. John walked along the bookcase, trying to find the right books that he needed. By the time he got to the end of it, he spotted Sherlock by the desk. Sherlock looked up as well, meeting John's gaze. John nodded. “Sherlock.” He said softly, looking back to the shelf. Sherlock nodded. “John.” He muttered quietly, looking back down into his books. John's gaze flickered back to Sherlock, tilting his head a bit to see what Sherlock was reading. “You're stuck in biology too then.” He said and smiled a little. Sherlock shrugged. “No, I'm taking advanced classes in biology and chemistry. Not stuck. Just better.” Sherlock said and turned a page. John nodded. Of course he was. He had to bite his lip to not say something along the lines of “smarty pants” or “just because you are rich and can afford extra tutoring”. He would've done it jokingly of course, but he had a hunch Sherlock wouldn't get that.
When they finally made it to the park, it was quite empty since it was still early in the day, and the people going out for picnic lunches had yet to arrive. They started walking along the path and John pointed out all the important buildings, including the hospital Mike worked at.
The food arrived shortly and the brothers calmed down when it did, Sherlock looking shyly at John. He hadn't been very talkative to his new found friend, and he felt a little bit bad about it. “I'm sorry John.” He whispered and John smiled, shaking his head. “It's alright. It's nice just to sit here and enjoy the company.” John said and nodded, smiling at Sherlock. His eyes widened though when he got his big plate of food, the big bowl of salad and the different bowls of sauces for the fish and chips and for the salad. “Oh, wow... This is a lot of food.” John chuckled, blushing as a small basket of bread was given to him as well. “T-Thanks.” He stuttered, not even sure where to start. Sherlock grinned happily at seeing John so overwhelmed by the food. Sherlock was usually overwhelmed by food as well, but in the opposite way that John was. But when John reacted this way, it made Sherlock more curious and excited about eating his own food, which Mrs. Holmes noticed, and was more than pleased about. John looked over to Sherlock's big bowl of pasta, it smelled amazing. “Gosh, yours looks equally as good.” John smiled. “You can try some of mine If you'd like.” Sherlock offered and John nodded. “As long as you try some of mine in return.” He said and smiled happily. Sherlock hummed softly and skillfully swirled up some pasta on his fork, taking a bite. He closed his eyes with a happy sigh, it was truly wonderful. John smiled at Sherlock enjoying his food, cutting a piece of the nicely battered fish. It crunched just enough when he bit into it, and the taste was delicious. The most delicious fish and chips he'd had by far. John smiled, looking over at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled back before taking another bite of his food.
“Maybe both?” Sherlock admitted and John chuckled softly. Why not. He had promised Sherlock he would take him out and show him around anyway after not having him come to the store together with him. Now would be the perfect time.
John turned to Sherlock and grinned. “I'll come to your house every day if I get desserts this big.” John said and chuckled. Sherlock pouted. “Hey, you're supposed to want to come to the house because of me! Not because of dessert...” He said with a cute little huff, crossing his arms. John rolled his eyes, cupping Sherlock's cheek. “Of course I would come to the house because of you Sherlock, I'm joking sweetheart.” John said and tilted his head. Sherlock blushed. Sweetheart. Another new pet name. He wanted to call John things too. “Good... Baby.” Sherlock said, but instantly blushed deeply. Oh no. That's definitely the wrong word. John blushed deeply. “What?” He said and Sherlock shook his head. “S-Sorry- I was just trying- Came out wrong-” Sherlock stuttered and John's expression softened. “It's okay, I can be your baby.” John said and smiled. Sherlock bit his lip. “Wait, let me try again.” Sherlock said, focusing on John's face. John smiled gently and looked at Sherlock just as intently back. Sherlock sighed. “Why does it come so naturally for you?” He complained. John smiled. “Sherlock, it's okay. It'll come in time. Remember, you called me sexy at the school cafeteria? I liked that a lot...” John murmured shyly and took Sherlock's hand. Sherlock smiled brightly and nodded. “Right, it's settled then, my sexy John.” He said and giggled. John shook his head fondly. “If we didn't have hot tea and dessert on the bed I would tickle you until you'd go mad.” John purred a little and Sherlock blushed. “Maybe afterwards then.” Sherlock said and took his tea, sipping it gently.
“You’re a good man John, please act that way,” she said before leaving with firm steps. John frowned and huffed at that comment before sitting down besides Sherlock.
Eventually Sherlock pulled back and began taking off his coat as well. Mycroft cleared his throat, correcting his shirt. “There's some takeout in the fridge, Chinese, if you want some. I'll pop on the kettle.” Mycroft said and headed to the kitchen. John smiled. “Mmm, just what I need.” He said, not at all bothered that it would be something reheated. Sherlock on the other hand wished he had some skill with cooking so he could make John a warm meal. That was a romantic thing to do, right? He pottered into the kitchen, John following behind. “I- I could make you french toast! Or a grilled cheese sandwich!” Sherlock suggested quickly, knowing those were the two things he could manage fairly well. Mycroft raised a curious eyebrow. He knew Sherlock didn't cook unless he really absolutely needed to. John tilted his head and chuckled. “Sherlock, I'm fine. I love Chinese food.” John said and nudged Sherlock to go to the fridge, not wanting to take the liberty to raid it on his own. Sherlock pouted. “But- Alright...” He murmured and moved to the fridge. John frowned for a moment before breaking into a smile. He gently moved behind Sherlock and wrapped his arms around him from behind. “Did you want to cook me something special, hmm?” He said softly into Sherlock's ear. Sherlock blushed heavily and nodded. “Well, if I'm staying until later, maybe we could try cook something together then? I'd love some cinnamon-sugar french toast.” John hummed and smiled at Sherlock a bit wider.. “But let's do the takeout for now, since we're both hungry yeah?” He said and swayed a little with Sherlock from side to side. Really, at that moment, John could've said practically anything and Sherlock would've just nodded. He was so close to John right now, he could feel how warm he was, how safe he felt. It was incredible, and it seemed like both his mind had slowed down, as well as his speech. He nodded once more, smiling. “Yes... I'd like that...” Sherlock murmured eventually, opening the door to the fridge and began gathering the leftovers.
Sherlock froze and tilted his head. /Sherl/? Why... Why did John call him that? Was it to mock him? Maybe he had been right about John all along.
Sherlock caught a glimpse of John heading into the men's bathroom and he slowed down, determined to let John have a moment before barging in. John grabbed a paper towel and started to clean up the smear, trying to calm down all the emotions that was running haywire in his body and mind. What just happened? He had no idea, but he was starting to calm down the more he thought about it. Sherlock had just been... nice, helpful, helping him to make the bruising better, and as soon as Sherlock opened the door, John looked up at him and bit his lip. “I'm sorry I stormed out like that. I'm not sure why I did it and I'm really, truly sorry. You were only trying to help, which you did, it already hurts less. I'm sorry for being so jittery, it's probably just something stuck from yesterday. Forgive me alright?” John said, Sherlock's eyes wide, baffled by the apology he had just received when he had been ready to start apologising himself. “What? Oh. Uhm. It's fine John. I forgive you, of course I do.” Sherlock rambled quickly, his cheeks starting to heat up again. John smiled and placed a hand on Sherlock's arm, rubbing a bit. “You're a good friend Sherlock, I'm glad we met.” He said in all honesty, tilting his head softly. “My... My dad told me to stay away from you, but that's not gonna happen. We just bloody met, and I'm definitely not done with you.” John chuckled. “It's usually just empty threats anyway, when he's angry.” John murmured. “Don't worry though, I didn't tell him your name, and even if I did he's not one to just go after someone he doesn't know. He still has some honor, somewhere.” John explained with a nod and a soft smile. Sherlock didn't know what to say. John had said so many things all at the same time and he had trouble comprehending it all for the first time ever. He usually did. He was usually quick to understand but not this time. John thought he was a good friend, he was glad they had met and he wasn't done with him even if his father had threatened him to stay away. Sherlock suddenly lunged into John's arms, not a care in the world if he could or not. John nearly fell backwards, but he quickly wrapped his arms around Sherlock, blushing and letting out a soft chuckle. “Hey, it's okay.” John said, not sure what to say, or if Sherlock was happy or sad. He stroke his back a little, leaning his head onto Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock squeezed John tightly, letting out a soft breath. “Thank you John. Thank you.” Sherlock said, his voice trembling slightly. John smiled. “I'm not sure for what exactly, but you're welcome Sherlock.” He said softly and squeezed Sherlock a little, still stroking his back gently. “Sherlock, we should probably get going so we're not late for our classes. I'll see you at lunch okay?” John said after a little while, gently trying to make Sherlock let go. It wasn't because he was uncomfortable, he just didn't know why he deserved this in the first place. Sherlock reluctantly began pulling away, letting his hands gently follow the line of John's back muscles. He nodded, looking back up at John. “See you at lunch.” Sherlock said and proceeded to quickly walk out of the bathroom, leaving John red in the face and impossibly warm both inside and out.
John smiled to himself. See? This was a bloody large step if he might say so himself. He was holding Sherlock and he was holding him very close. He had decided, in his mind of course, that if Sherlock was just Sherlock, he had so many feelings for him and he knew in his heart he needed to act upon them. And this, this was the beginning. He was also very happy seeing Sherlock enjoying his breakfast, and he grinned softly as Sherlock scraped the plate clean and placed it back on the table. Sherlock looked up at John carefully, trying to deduce and assess the situation, and with a large grin, he quickly cuddled up against John's side. He could see that it was alright. He could just tell. Harry stood up slowly, finally looking away from the telly only to see her brother snuggled up with Sherlock. “Well then.” She said softly with a smile and a nod, picking up Sherlock's and John's plate as well, heading to the kitchen to clean up. John followed her with his gaze before looking back down at Sherlock. “Uhm... Sherlock? I... I think we might need to... talk.” John murmured, reaching for the remote to turn the telly sound down. Sherlock paled. Oh no. No. Not talking. Anything but talking. He was so bad at it. So very bad. Couldn't they just cuddle? Cuddling was much much easier. You didn't have to think too much about it and it was just so so much better than talking. Sherlock's mind was racing, and John could see that. “Hey- Hey... Sherlock, it's okay. It's not... /bad/ talking. I just... want to talk.” John tried, biting his lip. Oh God Sherlock felt sick, and without giving it much thought, he shook his head. “I don't want to.” He said simply and swallowed. John frowned. “You... You don't want to talk to me?” He asked, confused and actually a bit hurt for taking such a big step just to be shut down. Sherlock shook his head. “I... I love talking to you I just don't want to... Talk. /Talk/, you know.” Sherlock mumbled. “I know I'll just say something bad and I will screw things up and I- I just want to cuddle.” Sherlock rambled, trying not to burst into nervous tears.
who seems to have more problems than me supposed to be of any help?” John said, his voice irritated and Ella felt her heart sink slightly. Well, that didn’t go to plan then… She squirmed a bit in her seat and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear awkwardly. She opened her mouth to speak, but to her surprise, John continued. “I mean, who knows maybe he’ll have a short circuit and just go rogue yeah? Who’s going to be responsible then? This ‘Mycroft Holmes’ bloke who seems responsible for this tin can? Doubt it, he sounds like a real tosser if you ask me,” John huffed and Ella closed her eyes for a moment to try to compose herself. Once again, she opened her mouth but John continued once more. “I mean, I feel sorry for the bloke… You know… This… Is some heavy stuff…” John murmured as he scanned over the file once more. Ella nodded softly.
“I uhm… Well, I just got back so… And my old friends mostly live elsewhere… I have a few friends around me..” John thought back on Mike and his interaction and pondered if Molly was still around as well. He sighed a little, not sure what this deep conversation would lead to together with a tin can when it had done very little with Ella. “I… I do feel lonely, sometimes. I think everyone does. Some people enjoy being alone, but that’s different from being lonely. And even people who prefer to be alone sometimes can feel the need for someone to talk to,” John nodded. Sherlock hummed, trying to understand.
“You think he… Needs me? I mean, I obviously don’t need him but… Is… Is there no one else in line to take him?” John’s voice started to get softer, quieter, less irritated and more sentimental. Ella shrugged, deciding to go with the truth on this one.
“We can stay at home for today, that’s alright, and tomorrow we’ll start a new day and we’ll do everything we set out to do today yeah?” John said before slowly shifting Sherlock off his lap and getting out of the bed.
“Why don’t you just consider it, John?” Ella said with an exasperated sigh, rubbing her forehead before letting her hand fall down into her lap beside her notebook. “I don’t understand what you have against it. You are blogging already, don’t tell me you are against new technology because
“If you look further down, he goes by Sherlock. As to if you can call him that or not… I suppose you will just have to ask him yourself,” she shrugged with a cheeky smile before leaving John behind in the room.
“I… I guess it would, yeah. I mean, I wish I didn’t have to go and leave you here but I can’t say no to helping her. You have to understand that don’t you?” John said and Sherlock tilted his head a bit.
John backed off a bit, Sherlock's gaze looking quite... threatening. “Oh, uhm, sorry. It's John. John Watson.” John said and rubbed his neck a bit, quite stumped from the sudden ramble Sherlock had blurted out at him. Sherlock nodded. “Very well, John.” He said and shoved his books into the locker, none of them dropping this time. John sighed and opened his mouth to speak again but Sherlock interrupted him quickly. “I do find your presence highly irritating and I would be happy if you wouldn't stand there like some ignorant baboon that only knows how to chase an oddly shaped ball around. Why aren't rugby balls round like all the other ones?” Sherlock huffed. John blinked. “Woah woah woah, excuse me? What do you have against me mate?” John frowned, sounding quite upset. “I'm. Not. Your. Mate.” Sherlock spat out before closing the locker. “I have something against people trying to make fun of me, trying to toy with me, I do not appreciate it and I won't be accepting that either. So leave me be.” Sherlock snarled quickly and turned on his heel, starting to walk away from John. John stood there, frozen in place, dumbfounded. “What the hell is wrong with him?” He breathed to himself when Sherlock was too far away to hear him.
John. That’s not his use. He is supposed to be there as support when you are having your nightmares or panic attacks and that’s that. I… It’s the new age support animal, sort of…” Ella stumbled a bit on her words but her eyes were still understanding and soft as she looked at John who sat slumped down in the chair, making him look smaller than usual. “Look me in the eyes and tell me you are not lonely, hmm? The government will provide all of this for free especially for soldiers like you and I just can’t understand why you won’t just give it a go. Please?” She knew she was begging, and most likely crossing lines as John’s therapist, but she was certain this would help.
John entered the rather small house quietly, trying to make as little noise as possible since it was quite late for him to come home from school. He hurried to the kitchen, trying to see if there was any dinner left. He opened the fridge, sighing a little. A half piece of sasuage, some milk, butter, bacon, and some moldy lettuce. Wonderful. He rubbed his neck, deciding to make some toast instead and have some cereal, since that was pretty much all he could put together at this hour without having to leave the house and sneak back in. He moved around the kitchen quietly, preparing his “meal” before hurrying upstairs.
“Well, that’s great, John. I’m glad you took my suggestion to heart and that it has gone well so far,” she smiled and grabbed her notebook out of the bag. John nodded, sinking down into his chair a bit.
Come morning, John was bustling about in the kitchen, preparing breakfast for the both of them, and calling Ella telling her he was sort of house bound at the moment. When Sherlock came walking into the kitchen, slightly unsteady but much better than last night, John looked up quickly and rushed to his side.
“Great, I’ll let Mr Holmes know right away,” she said as she stood up, smoothing out her dress slightly. John stood up as well and cleared his throat, taking the file in his hand, opening it slightly.
The next morning, John fumbled to get his alarm off on his phone. It was the most obnoxious sound ever but it was the only thing that could really wake him up. He always preferred to at least try to wake up a bit earlier so that he could have a long shower and perhaps get breakfast done before everyone else was up. He went to his wardrobe, picking out something light to wear. The weather seemed to still hold up, so he didn't want to put on something too warm. He put on another tanktop he owned and a blue checkered shirt, his red boxers and some worn jeans. Most of his things were quite worn, but he always blamed it on him having an 'active lifestyle', whatever that was supposed to mean.
Come lunchtime, Mike and John sat in the cafeteria. John sighed as he spotted Sherlock sitting alone, far away from anyone else. “That Sherlock kid is mental Mike.” John muttered. Mike looked up, spotting Sherlock as well. “Did you two fall out again? What happened this time?” Mike said softly. John shrugged. “He just pushed me in the hallway and I went up to him to ask what his problem was and he started spewing out all sorts of guff about me.” John huffed softly. Mike frowned. John sighed. “He was saying he thought I was toying with him or something. But I never was. I think he's just defensive for some reason.” John said and looked over at Sherlock again. “Do we know why he changed schools?” John asked and Mike shook his head. “Nah, they usually don't say that sort of things.” Mike murmured. John nodded. “Yeah that's understandable... Maybe he was treated badly.” John guessed, looking at Sherlock with consideration in his eyes instead of anger.
Sherlock quickly entered his room and pushed John inside. “John, calm down.” Sherlock said and placed his hands on his shoulder. “Take a few deep breaths. Here, sit.” He said and guided John to the foot of his bed. He sat down beside John and kept a hand on his shoulder. “Listen to me and listen closely. Even though I'm a little hurt you never told me your real birthday was today, I'm happy I found out now. I can guarantee you that your father will not know about it, and I can guarantee you that you are safe, okay? I'm not stupid, I know what's going on and I've known ever since I first met you more or less. I was so afraid last night when I dropped you off I couldn't sleep. And then I saw you like that first thing in the morning, it made my heart sink.” Sherlock admitted, speaking more to John than it felt like he had ever done before. “Can I please celebrate your birthday with you today? I will come tomorrow too, of course, but can I please spend your actual birthday with you today, with my family, with my family who cares so much about you already. Please?” Sherlock pleaded, looking John in the eyes. John had calmed down while Sherlock spoke, and now he was breathing evenly and slowly. He took a moment before nodding. “Alright.” John said softly. “Alright. I... I want to spend my birthday with you and your family too.” He admitted shyly, not even able to remember last time his birthday had been celebrated properly with his own family. “But then I'll need my shirt back.” John said with a soft smile and a chuckle. He then proceeded to unbutton the one he was wearing, without giving Sherlock much warning. “God I can't believe I spilled in front of your parents. I'm such a slob...” John muttered, pulling the shirt off his body and tossing it on a nearby chair. “Go on then, hand me mine that you are wearing. Or maybe you have something else in mind for me, although I doubt anything of yours will fit me.” He said with a chuckle. Sherlock though, was blushing, and in his own mind just looking at John's chest. “Hmm?” He said, looking back up at John. John laughed. “Sherlock! Come on mate! Your shirt!” John said and nudged Sherlock playfully, feeling a bit better already. Even though the whole situation was a bit awkward, and he still felt bad about Sherlock's parents taking him out and paying for him, he was determined to make the best out of the situation since this was what Sherlock wanted. To spend his real birthday together. “Oh. Right. Right.” Sherlock said and began unbuttoning his shirt, John turning around a bit to give Sherlock some privacy. “It's okay... You don't have to...” Sherlock dared to say this time, and John gently tilted his head back, but didn't look at Sherlock fully. Not until he had to grab the shirt, and when he did, he let his eyes quickly wander over Sherlock's pale chest. He licked his bottom lip but then quickly proceeded to put the shirt on. It was warm, and nice smelling and he sighed contently. “What are you going to wear then?” John asked and Sherlock blushed, realising he was still topless. “I'm sure I can find something.” He said and stood up, walking to his giant wardrobe to start rummaging around it. “I think... This one.” He said and picked out a nice dark navy blue shirt. “This will do nicely.” He said with a smile and slipped it on. He looked in his mirror, making sure he buttoned it correctly and that his curls were in place, seeing John slowly moving up behind him. “Is my hair alright?” John teased, pretending to fix his short cut in the mirror. Sherlock grinned and turned around, ruffling John's hair quickly so it was all messy. “Perfect.” Sherlock said with an even bigger grin and a chuckle.
“I can't believe you just called Mycroft that.” Sherlock said and chuckled a little, moving up close to John. John grinned and chuckled as well. “Sorry, perhaps I was pushing my boundaries, but I just had to.” John admitted and wrapped a shy arm around Sherlock's waist. Sherlock blushed and nodded, forgetting everything around him once more as he felt John's hand wrapped around his waist so delicately. “John...” He breathed, not sure what he wanted to say, but really, he just wanted to say John's name out loud. John blushed, the tips of his ears going pink and just as he opened his mouth the microwaved dinged loudly. He flinched and snorted softly. “I guess it's done.” He said and took out the warm food and exchanged it with the other plate he had prepared.
“Boo!” Molly suddenly swooped up behind Sherlock, grinning from ear to ear. “So, tell me, tell me, tell me!” She pleaded excitedly, biting her lip. Sherlock was still in shock, panting hard. “You- You can't just jump at me like that you- you scared the living- uh- you scared me!” Sherlock complained but then couldn't help but smile when she realised Molly was excited for his sake. “Oh, uhm...” He said, blushing deeply. Molly giggled. “Oh look at you! Did you finally tell him?” She whispered and Sherlock giggled a little as well, nodding his head. “Yes... Or well... We both said... It was a bit of a chaotic thing... But we both know now.” Sherlock stuttered with several nods, trying to make Molly understand what had happened. “You both know /know/?” She asked, trying to make sure she understood. Sherlock grinned wider and nodded. “Mhm.” He said and Molly squealed, jumping up and down and hugging Sherlock tightly. “But- But you can't tell John that I told you- Or that you know, you know?” Sherlock rambled quickly, taking her hand. “He's really self conscious about all of this and he's just a bit nervous really.” Sherlock explained quickly. Molly nodded and sighed. “I figured he would be. But it will be okay Sherlock, I promise. He'll settle into it soon and everything will be okay.” She said and smiled kindly. Sherlock smiled as well, letting out a soft sigh of relief. “I really hope so... I want him to be just as sweet as he is at home when we're in school... I know that's too much to ask this early on but I want that as soon as John will be ready for it.” Sherlock said and nodded his head softly. Molly smiled, hooking her arm with Sherlock's and began walking with him to class. “He will Sherlock, in time, just like I said. You shouldn't worry.” She smiled. Sherlock nodded once more and smiled crookedly. “He actually stroke my back when we stood with Mike. Mike wasn't looking just then but John really did it.” Sherlock said softly but with an underlying excitement in his voice. Molly gasped. “He did!?” She exclaimed and Sherlock quickly shushed her, placing a finger over his mouth. “You don't have to tell the whole bloody school! But yes, yes he did. And it was amazing...” Sherlock whispered and grinned together with Molly, taking her arm again willingly and continued walking to class, his head held high.
“He does?” He hummed and looked back at Mike. He nodded a little and relaxed. “Nice to meet you, Mike,” Sherlock nodded but didn’t hold out his hand. He glanced at the pastry on his plate, drizzled over with some chocolate. “What’s that?” He asked and Mike smiled.
“Hmm? Oh… Nothing really. Just how important you’ve become to me that’s all,” John smiled wider and stroke another curl behind Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock blinked his eyes open and they flashed over for a moment as he looked up at John.
“You’re very welcome, Sherlock. I’ve never seen John this light and calm either so whatever you’re doing it must be helping loads,” Ella smirked and now it was John’s turn to glare at her, until Sherlock spun to look at him.
“When… Mike was talking about that park, close to his workplace, I… I really wanted to go there… I thought… Maybe… If you’re not too tired… We could… Go?” Sherlock uttered the words slowly, apprehensively. He didn’t want to make John upset, not when the morning had gone so well so far. John smiled a little and dried off his hands, nodding his head.
“Hey, Peter! A large pepperoni pizza for me. Make it extra large yeah?” John said to the owner of the place, giving him back the menu. “And a coke for me and, Sherlock?” John asked and Sherlock flinched, having not been ready to order anything. “I'll have the same.” He said quickly, looking back down. Mike was laughing, sitting a bit further away, but he glanced over to John. John smiled back, but gave him a look and knew that Mike understood that Sherlock was proving difficult, but that John wasn't about to give up on him yet. John started to talk to the person sitting next to him on his other side, and Sherlock felt very awkward just sitting there on the end, doing nothing. But he couldn't expect John to pay attention to him every second, he supposed. Even though that would be wonderful indeed.
They came back to the table without much fuss, the bloke still being very apologetic but John quickly brushed him off. “It's alright okay? Let's just move on.” John said and smiled a little. He looked over at Sherlock, smiling as well. He really did look good wearing his shirt... He blushed and quickly cleared his throat, looking at his pizza. “I'll take a first bite and see if it's worthy your consumption.” John chuckled and took a slice and a big bite. He chewed for a bit, Sherlock watching him intently and curiously. “Hmm... Yep, perfect. Here.” He said and handed Sherlock a slice. Sherlock looked at it for a little while before taking a gentle nibble, John already grabbing his second piece. “How is it?” John said, speaking with his mouth full. But it wasn't in a disgusting manner, more a cute manner, Sherlock decided. He smiled and nodded. “It's good. Very salty though.” He said and took a sip from his newly poured glass of coke. John smiled. “Well, when you've ran for what feels like forever and you've been sweating like a pig, salt is nice.” He said and chuckled a little. Sherlock nodded shyly and continued eating his pizza to John's surprise.
“Right, I don't know about you but I really need something sweet and a coffee to finish my meal.” Mr. Holmes declared when they were getting closer to finishing their plates of food. John was absolutely stuffed and by now he was leaning back in the comfortable seat, holding his belly just a little. But dessert did sound nice. “They have a few choices of cake John, the birthday boy- man-, should have a cake after all.” Mr. Holmes encouraged. John smiled and nodded, sitting up a bit better. “I'm so incredibly full, thank you so much for this lovely dinner Mr. and Mrs. Holmes.” John said dearly and nodded. Sherlock's parent's smiled and nodded. “Our pleasure dear.” Mrs. Holmes said and smiled at him. John looked to Sherlock. “Their... Their cake slices looks massive, fancy sharing one?” He asked and Sherlock looked up quickly, blushing. “Yes. Yes we can definitely share. I'm quite full as well.” Sherlock said and put the menu between them so they could pick what they wanted. “I'm not very picky with my desserts, as long as they're sweet.” John chuckled. “What would you like?” He asked Sherlock, being ever so considerate. Sherlock hummed, looking through the menu. He was a fan of sweets after all. “What about the triple chocolate fudge cake? If you like chocolate, that is.” Sherlock said and bit his lip shyly. John nodded. “That sounds incredible, let's go for that.” He agreed, sinking back down into his seat. The whole dinner had been like a dream for him, and even though he had kept his phone in the pocket of his jeans the whole time, it hadn't buzzed at all. But it didn't bother him, because he was having fun and was taken care of by the Holmes family, and it was amazing.
They both continued talking, Ella asking her usual round of questions to see what had changed, what was easier, what had been worse, allowing John to speak his mind as he wished. Though, she was soon distracted as a tall, pale man with messy curls came rushing towards them and grabbed the sleeve of John’s shirt, tugging harshly while glaring at Ella.
“He does! And, he lets me try all kinds of food, and yesterday he gave me a gift, and he was worried about me charging alright, and-”
John directed his gaze to Sherlock, smiling at how awkward and flushed he looked. “Do you want to come along then?” He asked suddenly, tilting his head. Sherlock quickly looked up, his eyes wide. Did John just ask him to come along to celebrate with him? Sherlock was never asked to come along to anything. Sherlock nodded quickly. “Can I?” He said, his voice barely there. John snorted and chuckled. “Of course you can. I wouldn't ask you if you couldn't.” John said and smirked a little. “So, what will it be, are you joining us?” He said and smiled gently, perhaps a bit encouragingly. Sherlock's cheeks flushed a deep red colour once again and he nodded. “Yes.. Yes of course I'd love to.” He rambled out quickly, biting his lip shyly. John smiled. “Great. Me and my team are just going to hit the showers real quick and change, you can wait in the gym if you'd like. Or out here, just tell me so I know where I've got you.” John said and smiled. Sherlock nodded. “I'll... I'll wait out here I think.” He said with a nod, sitting down onto the bench once more. John smiled again. “Alright. See you in a bit then.” He said and headed to the showers.
“I heard raised voices, I hope you three are playing nicely.” Mr. Holmes said and sat down in another one of the armchairs. The three of them nodded quickly, shifting awkwardly in their seats. “Yes Mr. Holmes, just a heated discussion that's all.” John said and shrugged sheepishly, smiling at Sherlock's father. He smiled back and nodded. “Good. Well, help yourselves, my wife does make the best sandwiches after all.” He said and John leaned forward to take a sandwich. It did look delicious and John was more than happy to tuck in. Sherlock couldn't help but giggle a little, taking a smaller sandwich for himself. He hummed softly and leaned against John shoulder, snuggling up beside him comfortably. “Can I...?” Sherlock said, moving to his side so he could drape his long legs over John's lap. John almost dropped the contents of his mouth out, wanting to say something like 'we can't do this in front of your parents' or 'are you really sure about this', but out came nothing, except for his red face. He nodded. “Y-Yeah- Yeah of course.” John said quickly and Mr. Holmes and Mrs. Holmes looked at each other, smiling fondly. Mycroft though looked quite annoyed, mostly because he was upset that he didn't have someone to cuddle with of his own. But he would never tell anyone that, of course. But Sherlock knew. Sherlock knew just by looking at his brother. And he also knew that Mycroft already fancied someone, and that Mycroft just had to get off his fat arse and do something about it. “Maybe you should ask that Gavin bloke out, Myc.” Sherlock said suddenly with a grin. Mycroft paled. “First of all, it's /Greg/, second of all, I don't have time. I'm too busy with my studies.” He said and waved his hand angrily. His mother looked over at him with a sigh. “You know... I don't think that's such a bad idea luv.” She said and smiled a little. Suddenly, Mycroft stood up and took his sandwich. “If you excuse me, I don't have to sit here and listen to this.” He hissed and stormed off. John was sitting speechless, not sure at all what had happened. Mycroft was interested in men as well? And why was he so angry when everyone around him was so supportive? He didn't understand, but decided to stay out of it for now. “Oh dear...” Mrs. Holmes sighed, her husband rubbing her back reassuringly. “It's alright dearest, he needs to hear these kinds of things to open up a bit.” Mr. Holmes said and Mrs. Holmes nodded. “You're right... You're probably right...” She said and sighed. Sherlock fiddled with the knot on his robe, sighing softly. He hadn't meant to upset Mycroft that way and he felt quite guilty now. John tilted his head, smiling understandingly as he saw the regret on Sherlock's face. “Maybe you could bring him his tea and you know... apologise?” John suggested and Sherlock blushed. “I'll... I'll do that when we're done...” He said and sighed, nuzzling against John's shoulder. “Didn't mean to make him that angry...” Sherlock said quietly. John nodded. “I know you didn't. You were just trying to help, in your own way.” He said and smiled lovingly.
John sighed once more. “”Yeah well, it wasn't the best of situations if you can remember it past your hangover. Thanks for helping us as much as you did. I really appreciate it mate. JW”” John replied.
John swallowed. He hated to admit it, but Mike was right, and somehow he had managed to put it into words in a way which made John feel even more ridiculous for the way he had acted to Sherlock. If a slightly daft Mike could realise this then why couldn't he? John turned to Sherlock and cupped his cheek. “Mike is right, you know, and I understand it even better now.” John whispered, looking into his eyes. “I'm sorry.” He whispered, looking knowingly into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock was stunned by the sudden affection, but he looked deeply into John's eyes, seeing his words were true, knowing what he was apologising for. “It's okay, it's okay my handsome John.” He whispered, making John smile. “Good, and I'm not that handsome.” John whispered and chuckled. Sherlock giggled. “Oh shut it, you are.” Sherlock giggled again and looked into John's eyes. “Well, if I'm handsome, then you are amazingly handsome, and uhm... sexy.” John said quickly and quietly, clearing his throat. Sherlock's eyes widened. /Sexy/? No one had every called him /sexy/ before. His cheeks flushed and he squeezed John's thigh that was still held firmly by his hand. “You're a mad man.” Sherlock said and shook his head. John smiled. “Perhaps, but not for thinking that my boyfriend is sexy.” John grinned and stroke Sherlock's cheek with his thumb. Both Mike and Molly was looking at them, but trying to focus on their own meals. John smiled, still looking into Sherlock's eyes. “Let's eat yeah? Don't want you going hungry to class.” John said and let go of Sherlock's cheek, returning to his food. Sherlock shivered. Well, he wouldn't go back to class hungry for food, but he would certainly go back to class hungry for something completely different.
I happen to know that. What matters is that it happened, and it wasn’t a very good look for you,” Mycroft growled at John who licked his lips nervously.
John closed his eyes, sighing softly. Even though they were having a wonderful moment, his mind was still clouded with worry. He wondered what would happen if his parents ever would find out. They probably would, somehow. It would be very difficult to keep it a secret forever. Because John wanted it to last forever, but he didn't dare to tell Sherlock that, in case Sherlock didn't have those thoughts at all. Sherlock frowned. “You're thinking too much again.” He said after giving John a moment to himself. “You shouldn't think so much, you'll get wrinkles all over your forehead.” Sherlock said and stroke his fingers over the gentle folds on John's forehead. John nodded. “Sorry, I'll stop.” John said quietly, reaching up to gently cup Sherlock's cheek and stroke it gently with his thumb. “I'm sorry.” He whispered and placed a gentle kiss on Sherlock's lips. Sherlock sighed and shook his head. “Don't... Don't be sorry, it's alright John, I just want you to know that you don't always have to think so much. Let you and your mind just enjoy what we have right now. I know it's difficult, it's difficult for me too. But somehow, with you, it's just a little bit easier than it would've been otherwise.” Sherlock said softly and smiled. John smiled and sank down into the bed, pulling Sherlock with him. “I agree, it is easier with you, definitely.” John said and smiled. “I will try not to think too much, and just enjoy the wonderful moment, how wonderful you are... How wonderful kissing you is...” John said, Sherlock's cheeks turning pinker with each sentence. “I- I think it's wonderful to kiss you too- and- and you are wonderful as well and-” Sherlock stumbled on the words. Oh why couldn't he get them out as beautifully as John did!? It was so frustrating! He let out the softest huff, not wanting his frustration to ruin the moment. But John was just smiling. He was always smiling. “Thank you, Sherlock.” He said and leaned forward, kissing Sherlock deeply once more.
Once he was in his room, he looked around, tilting his head. It was quite bare, clearly not been used since Dr Watson moved in, not that he had lived there for too long. Sherlock observed the shelves and the small desk, slowly putting some of his belongings that he did care about ontop of it. Mycroft had told him that this time it would be different. That he would most likely have his own room, get to have his own things there, get to be more… Human-like. And Sherlock had doubted him. More than ever, actually, but Mycroft kept reassuring him that Dr Watson was different. And now he kinda felt that perhaps Mycroft was right after all… Sherlock scanned his room before sitting on the bed, observing his pyjamas. He let his fingers gently stroke over the smooth fabric, slightly cool to the touch. It was made by some anti-static material that was sure to not interfere with his loading, so he needed to change for optimal recharging capabilities.
“”I'm on my way out of class, see you by the bathrooms on the ground floor. SH”” Sherlock sent and as soon as John saw it he headed that way. Molly on the other hand began hurrying after Sherlock, who frowned deeply. “Where... Where are you going?” He said curiously and Molly bit her lip shyly. “I just... was following you I...” She stuttered. Sherlock bit his lip. He liked Molly, he really did, though he wasn't sure how this would work. “I... Okay... Just, I don't know what John will say...” Sherlock said and Molly's heart fell a little. “Oh, yeah, right, uhm, I should just.... See you at the next class then.” She said and nodded. Sherlock sighed. Being with John had made him understand emotions and feelings a bit more, and he noticed something wasn't right. “Molly? You can come along if you'd like. I'm sure John wouldn't mind.” Sherlock said finally, walking along with Molly. Molly blushed. “Really? I don't want to intrude-” She stuttered but Sherlock shook his head, his curls bouncing cutely. “It's alright, you're not intruding. You... You are my friend, if you wish to be so, and thus you won't be intruding.” Sherlock decided, blushing a little. Molly grinned widely and giggled again. “Of course I'm your friend you dummy!” She said and nudged Sherlock as they headed towards the bathrooms.
“You don't know anything Myc!” Sherlock shouted, moving to the mirror, starting to frantically fix his curls into place. “I'm going to the game because I'm going to the game! Stop playing mind tricks on me!” He whined, slamming his hand onto the dresser with a little whimper. Ouch. Too hard. He shook his hand out, biting his lip. Mycroft sighed and tutted. Sherlock sighed. “Besides-” He stopped, licking his lip. “I don't think he'll even want to speak to me.” Sherlock murmured quietly. Mycroft nodded. So he was right then. There was... /someone/. He walked towards Sherlock and brushed a curl from his forehead before placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. The time almost stood still for a while as he looked at his little brother in the mirror. Sometimes, he knew what Sherlock needed, and right now, the last thing Sherlock needed was him teasing him. Sherlock needed his support. Mycroft took a soft breath before speaking. “Stay calm, time your actions right, and apologise sincerely.” His brother murmured quietly into Sherlock's ear. He patted Sherlock's shoulder gently. “You'll be fine.” He encouraged, something he didn't do very often. He gave Sherlock a pointed look in the mirror before turning around to leave the room.
John got home earlier than yesterday, holding the book Sherlock had given him. Rugby practice had been cancelled due to a sudden rainstorm. The sky had apparently decided to open up and put on the waterworks despite the gorgeous weather they had been having. He had wrapped his jacket around the book, not wanting to get library property wet and soggy. But John was drenched as he stepped inside. “Oh! Quickly to the bathroom, chop chop.” Mrs. Watson tutted as John walked inside of the house. John sighed. “Yeah I know.” He said and rubbed a hand through his wet hair. He took off his drenched sneakers and headed upstairs to the bathroom, stripping out of his wet clothes. He really looked like a wet, soaked dog, his hair all frizzy and messy. Suddenly someone tugged at the handle. “It's occupied! For Christ's sake...” He muttered. Harry sighed. “Are you going to spend all evening in there little brother?” Harry smirked. John groaned. Great. Harry was home. “No, but I'll come and roll over your bed and make everything wet unless you leave me the hell alone.” John grumbled. Harry giggled. “Oh come on little brother, I've missed you. Come out here and give us a kiss.” She teased. John opened the door with a grumpy face, new pair of boxers on but nothing else than that. He stuck his tongue out. “You don't even like kissing boys.” He teased back and Harry flushed a deep red, punching John on the arm. “Not so loud you idiot!” She hissed, John smirking and rubbing his arm. He was the only one that knew Harry didn't fancy blokes at all, and she was not about to tell their parents about it anytime soon. John nodded. “I know I know. I wouldn't do that to you sis.” John said and walked to his bedroom. He unwrapped the book from his jacket, putting it on the bed. Harry glanced at it. “So it's true then, what mum says. That you are failing biology.” Harry murmured. John groaned as he pulled his sweatpants and t-shirt from the drawers. “It's true, but I'm changing it around. I was told this book was a good one and that it would help me understand.” John said, thinking back to his meeting with Sherlock at the library. Harry nodded. “I hope for your sake that it does.” She hummed before leaving the room.
“And if I were to say yes then? Mostly to get you to pipe down a bit and go back to our regular sessions, ‘scuse the language,” John said even though he wasn’t really rude to start with. He tilted his head. “Can I get rid of the ‘tin can’ if it’s being a bother to me? Without any repercussions? No small print in the contracts, hmm?” John’s tone became more strained. Ella leaned back in her chair.
John only managed to throw away his phone and start tossing the ball again before Sherlock entered, his curls wet, the fluffy bathrobe swept around himself, and the clothes in his hand. “I... I wanted to get a bit more dry before I put the clothes on... I have underwear on though, don't worry...” Shelrock trailed off with a blush. John blushed as well and nodded. “Yeah, yeah that's fine. Just, come here and lay down under the covers so you can keep warm.” John encouraged, helping Sherlock get back into bed. John tossed his ball to the floor and turned to look at Sherlock. “Do you feel a bit better now?” He asked gently and Sherlock nodded. “Yes, yes I do. Thank you. I... I can't believe how you can be so patient with me sometimes...” Sherlock murmured quietly. John smiled. “Well, it's quite easy really, especially since you mean so much to me.” John admitted, scooting a bit closer. Sherlock blushed even deeper, but he grinned from ear to ear. “Really? You mean so much to me too.” He said cutely and scooted closer as well. John snorted softly. “That's good. Good start at least.” John said and chuckled a little. He brushed a few wet curls from Sherlock's forehead, sighing softly. “I know you don't want to talk, but can I just tell you something and ask one thing, please?” John asked quietly after a little paus. Sherlock got nervous again, but nodded. John took a deep breath. Right. “I... I want this, so much, more than I think I can wrap my thick head around right now, to quote my dear sister.” John smiled. “But, like I said, I do know that I want this, us, you and me. Uhm, together and... stuff.” John blushed deeply. “Saying we had a relationship earlier, it rolled off the tongue so nicely that I know that's what I want. But now comes my question.” He took another deep breath. “Could we... Could we just take things... slow? Like, /we/ don't have to take things slow, I mean, /we/ can have any pace we'd like but-” Sherlock interrupted John by placing a hand on his chest. “John, I'm not upset, stop rambling and tell me what you mean.” Sherlock said softly, offering John a small smile even though he was nervous. “I'm just... I'm afraid to you know... come out or whatever you call it... to everyone in school. To my friends. I want us to be together, but I'm very scared of letting people around me know that.” John admitted softly. Sherlock sighed, but nodded understandingly. “John, we'll take it slow. I promise. At least that part. As you said, between us, we can take this in any pace we'd like. I've... I've loved everything we've done so far... You make me feel so special...” Sherlock mumbled shyly. “And I want us too. More than anything.” Sherlock said sincerely and looked up into John's eyes. “We can tell whoever you'd like. We can do... We can do however little or how much you want in school. Like... holding hands or hugging or... I understand if you don't want to do any of that-” Sherlock added quickly, squeezing John's shirt a little in his hand. John's head was spinning with everything that had been said. He hadn't even thought that far yet. About holding hands or hugging in public. But- But he wanted to do that, didn't he? They just couldn't pretend in school that they were only friends, could they? That sounded very difficult, and that would also mean he had be different around Sherlock. He didn't think he wanted that. He started smiling though, his mind catching up to everything else that had been said. “Thank you, for allowing me to take it slow, for listening to me. I'm so... happy to know that you want this too, and that I've made you feel special, besides the times I've made you feel so very sad...” John said with a sad sigh. “We'll figure everything out, with school and such, but we can't under any circumstances tell my dad, alright? This is important Sherlock. He can't know about this, can you promise me we'll try our very best to keep it a secret from him? And from my mum, just in case?” John asked and looked Sherlock in the eyes. Sherlock nodded quickly. “I promise. I promise from the bottom of my heart.” Sherlock said, but he secretly wished John would be accepted by his family, no matter what career he decided to pursue, or who he wanted to love.
“No, no that’s not- He’s not my-” John sighed and rubbed his forehead. Sherlock still stared sceptically at Mike before clearing his throat.
John took a few more crisps, smiling over at Sherlock. “I like it when you laugh.” John said softly, looking at the taller teen. “It's so different from how you usually are, smart and a bit strict. That's why it's so brilliant when you let go like that.” John said and Sherlock's cheeks were heating up quickly. “I... Thank you...” Sherlock mumbled softly. “I like when you laugh as well, because I know what difficulties you face every day with your family which makes it even more special when you do laugh.” Sherlock said, trying to be sweet but it came out a bit wrong. John looked down at his hands. “Yeah... Yeah I guess so...” He mumbled and Sherlock rubbed his neck. “Sorry, I didn't do it as well as you did. The compliment thing.” Sherlock sighed and John smiled. “It's fine. I know what you meant still. I know that sometimes the things you say can come out wrong, and it's fine. Hell, it's hard to make things come out right all the time, especially with such a busy and amazing mind that you have.” John said and popped a crisp in his mouth. Sherlock had to look away, his blush darkening. He was not used to getting so many compliments in a row, and he had no idea how to handle them. Usually people got angry, thought he was annoying, but John... John understood him. John tilted his head, watching Sherlock being turned away from him, realising he must've gone over a boundary. “This telly show is really dumb, I mean, all they do is fighting and go to the spa and-” “Thank you John.” Sherlock said quickly to interrupt the other, knowing John was trying to change the subject because he thought it was too much for him to handle. “Thank you. You are the most amazing friend I've ever had, and I'm forever thankful that you take the time to understand me even though I've hurt you many times already. Usually I deduce something about a new friend and the next day they are not my friend anymore. But you're still here. And that means the world to me.” Sherlock finished, his voice soft and earnest throughout the whole speech. “You're a special and wonderful man John Watson, and I mean that with all my heart.” He said and now John was just as red in the face as Sherlock were. John had been a good friend to many, but no one had ever thanked him for it. John's eyes were getting a bit misty, which was unacceptable of course. “Come here silly.” He said and pulled Sherlock into a warm hug, because he wanted to, and also to hide his misty eyes. “We're here for each other, and that's what's so special.” John said and sighed happily. Sherlock held John firmly, nosing just a little at his neck, his eyes falling shut. He could stay in John's embrace forever. It was so warm, so protective, and not in the outrageous way Mycroft was protective of him. Though he knew John could probably be that way too, given the situation. John pulled back, stroking away a stray curl from Sherlock's forehead with a smile. “Your curls are so unruly sometimes.” John hummed softly. Sherlock smiled. “Mostly when I forget to use conditioner.” Sherlock replied and they both burst into soft chuckles, smiling at each other from ear to ear.
Sherlock woke up early in the morning, eager to get ready for John's party even though he knew it wasn't happening until later in the evening. He was grinning as he rushed around his room, trying to decide what to wear. But suddenly, his grin dropped and his eyes widened. “Myc!!!” He yelled and rushed out the door and to his brother's bedroom. “Myc! I haven't gotten John a gift!” He yelled, his eyes wide, Mycroft turning around from his desk. “First of all, you don't have to yell, especially not this early in the morning when I'm having my very hot morning tea that I can spill all over me when startled. Second of all, I don't think John is expecting a gift Sherlock, and it's not that kind of party anyway.” Mycroft said with a sigh and a roll of his eyes, turning back to the laptop. Sherlock tilted his head with a frown. “What... What do you mean 'not that kind of party'. It's a party Myc, it's his birthday party he needs gifts.” Sherlock said confused. Mycroft sighed and turned back around. “Sherlock, it's not the kind of party where everyone brings him gifts, sits in a ring to see what he opens and then have cake. I do hope you understand that. That is a children's birthday party, not a grown up one.” Mycroft muttered. Sherlock blushed. “Of course I didn't think that. I'm not stupid...” He said, though, what he had thought about it hadn't been that far off... “But I can still buy him a gift, right? People will still buy him gifts, right?” Sherlock asked and Mycroft shrugged. “His closests friends might bring him something, but there is probably going to be a lot of people at the party that John doesn't even know Sherl.” Mycroft sighed, trying to explain to his brother. “Well, I'm one of his closest friends now, so I should buy him a gift, period.” Sherlock said and sat onto Mycroft's bed, legs crossed and his head in his hands. “But what should I get him...” He murmured deep in thought.
John's face turned into a deep shade of red. It was now or never, he thought, even though that probably wasn't true. He lowered his fork, gazing upon Sherlock's beautiful face. Sherlock frowned a little. “Come on then, I want to taste this delicious cake as well.” Sherlock said and parted his lips again. John smiled. “Sorry, of course you do. Here it comes.” John said and lowered his fork, and instead of giving Sherlock the bite of cake, John leaned forward and placed his lips onto Sherlock's. He closed his own eyes, just in time so that he missed Sherlock's own eyes opening wide, almost in panic. But Sherlock didn't pull back. He let his lips rest against John's, slightly intertwined since his own lips was parted. John's lips were so soft, so warm, and more amazing than he could've ever imagined them to be. He let out a soft little happy whine, and John pulled back slightly. “Was that a good noise?” He asked, wanting to make sure, panting just a little. Sherlock nodded, his cheeks a dark red colour. “It- It was- I think- That- John- You-” Sherlock stuttered, biting his lip that was still warm from the kiss. John blushed and nodded. “Was that okay?” He asked, wanting to be sure. Sherlock nodded quickly once more. “Yes- Yes very okay I- I just wasn't expecting it-” Sherlock said, fiddling with his fingers. John smiled. “Well... That was kind of the point.” He said and chuckled softly, Sherlock breaking out into a shy smile. “Ah, I see.” Sherlock said, giggling as well. “Well... Either way... I liked it, a lot.” Sherlock admitted, squirming a bit. “It... It was my first one...” Sherlock said, biting his lip more.  “First- First kiss? That was your first kiss?” John said and Sherlock nodded. “Yes... Yes it was...” He said shyly, looking up at John. John blushed deeper. He couldn't believe it. But at the same time as he was baffled, he felt relieved that he was Sherlock's first kiss. He felt special. Very special. John took Sherlock's hand, holding it gently between both of his own. “I would be lying if I said it was my first kiss too, but, it was my first kiss with a bloke. And I'm so happy it was with you.” John said and smiled at Sherlock shyly, tilting his head. Sherlock blushed and nodded. Of course he knew he wasn't John's first kiss, but what followed next made his heart warm either way. He was John's first proper kiss with another man.  He smiled shyly. “I'm happy my first kiss was with you too.” Sherlock said and moved a bit closer. “Can... Can we do it again? And this time, I'll be ready for it.” Sherlock said with a big grin.
John laughed as he spoke with the girl, someone Mike had randomly invited. Mike had forced John to make a good impression, so that he could introduce Mike to her later. God he hated being Mike's wingman, he hated that- John frowned. What the hell was going on with Sherlock? He could instantly see that something wasn't right. Sod being a wingman, this was more important. John quickly made his way over to Sherlock and the other bloke, moving up close to Sherlock. “Hey, what's going on here then?” John said and glared at the other man. Victor smirked. “Bugger off will ya? I'm just having a word with... What's your name again? I'll just call you pretty cheekbone boy until you tell me your name.” Victor grinned and tugged Sherlock closer. Sherlock whimpered and looked at John. “Cut it out. He doesn't want anything to do with you alright?” John hissed, grabbing Victor's wrist. “Let go, now.” John said firmly. Victor just smirked. “You're gonna deny me a shag? What kind of a bloke are you?” Victor said and frowned at John. “Well, since you asked so nicely, I'm the birthday boy, and if you don't behave I'll throw you out.” John growled and gripped Victor's wrist tighter, causing him to let go of Sherlock's hand out of pain. “Oww, fuck! You're hurting my bloody hand!” Victor whined and winced, trying to get away, but John kept his grip tightly around his wrist, not letting go. Sherlock quickly moved behind John, hiding behind his back. “Alright alright I'll step off! Jesus Christ!” Victor yelled through the loud music, causing some heads to turn. John nodded. “And if I ever see you puttig your dirty hands on him again, I swear I'll snap your neck right off.” John growled before finally letting go, the skin on Victor's wrist a deep red colour. “You're a fucking nutcase, fucking mental you are.” Victor said and quickly hurried to the hallway, grabbing his coat and leaving the house.
“We don’t go outside in pyjamas though, alright?” John smiled and nodded for Sherlock to go get changed.
“Someone will be coming over in a little bit. Now, she’s not dangerous, and she and I will have a bit of a talk together and then she’ll leave. Just so you know okay?” John said and sipped his tea. Sherlock frowned. A woman. He tilted his head.
John paced back and forth, nervous and eager to see Sherlock again. He couldn't help but frown though when he saw Molly by Sherlock's side. Oh. Well, this would be awkward then, he thought to himself. John smiled politely though, nodding his headwhen they came close. “Hello Molls.” He said and gave her a gentle hug. Molly was grinning, blushing, and Sherlock was afraid she would lose it completely and reveal that she knew about them. Molly giggled. “Hello John, don't worry about me, you can cuddle all you'd like.” She said and covered her mouth quickly. “Molly!” Sherlock snapped at her as he saw John's face getting pale. “John, John it's okay I promise,” Sherlock stuttered, reaching to touch John's arm gently. “I- I told you not to tell anyone-” John stuttered, looking at Sherlock with frightened and worried eyes. Sherlock tried to give John a gentle and reassuring smile. “It's just Molly, John, she's our friend. She's okay with all of this, right Molly?” Sherlock said, still furious with her but knowing she would be the only one who could really mend this situation. Molly nodded, sighing a little. “He's right John. Come on, lighten up okay? I've known Sherlock has been keen on you for much longer than you two have been together, and I'm fine with it, honestly.” She said and shrugged. “You're both so sweet to each other and I know you're worried-” “But it's not about that. I specifically told Sherlock not to-” John interrupted Molly but then stopped himself as Sherlock lowered his head. John sighed and rubbed his neck. “I just... Didn't want this.” John said and leaned against the lockers. Molly sighed and rubbed Sherlock's arm. “Well tough luck John, you have a gorgeous boyfriend now and just because you are insecure you shouldn't let him get hurt by it.” She grumbled softly. John frowned. “Who are you to tell me what to do?” John said and crossed his arms. “Just stop it both of you!” Sherlock snapped, looking up at John. “I was so excited to finally have someone to gossip with about something I was so eager about. I never thought I would ever even care about such silly things but it made me happy! And since it made me happy you should be happy for me! Come on Molly, let's go.” Sherlock said and grabbed her hand, storming off. John's jaw dropped at first, and he stood there dumbfounded. He then closed his eyes and hit his head against the locker with a groan, staying there, just sulking for a moment. He wasn't used to Sherlock leaving... Usually it was the other way around. Which... Was a horrible thought. He groaned and huffed at himself. “Sherlock wait!” He called and began rushing after Sherlock and Molly.
“Maybe the GPS person got lost in- oufh-!” Just as John was making the joke and opened the door, he bumped into Sherlock, quickly grabbing his hand so he wouldn't fall over. “H-Hey. There you are.” John said and beamed, squeezing Sherlock's hand as he pulled him up so he stood firmly on his feet. “I almost knocked you over! I was worried you wouldn't come.” John said and smiled, feeling much happier now. Sherlock blushed deeply, smiling softly. John was worried he wouldn't come. God that felt great. And John /looked/ great. Amazing even. John had a nice baby blue shirt on, it looked very new too. It wasn't buttoned all the way up, the top of the shirt left open just slightly. Enough to hint but not enough to make it look overly sexy. And the trousers... Sherlock didn't even think John owned tight trousers like that and- “Hello? Earth to Sherlock?” John said and Sherlock quickly shifted his gaze up to John's face. “Sorry. I'm here.” Sherlock said and nodded. “I just thought I forgot something and I wanted to figure it out before my ride had gotten too far away.” Sherlock said and John smiled. “Did you figure it out then?” He asked and Sherlock nodded. “No worries, it was nothing important.” Sherlock said, since there wasn't really anything in the first place, he had only lied to not have to tell him the truth. That he had stood outside like a coward for several minutes. John chuckled. “Well, good. Come on in okay?” He said and helped Sherlock inside, only then noticing the bag. He blushed. “Did you... Did you get me a gift?” John asked, looking at Sherlock. “Gosh you... You shouldn't have...” John murmured and Sherlock blushed deeply. Damnit. Mycroft was right after all. Sherlock shook his head. “It's just a tiny thing really, nothing too special.” Sherlock said and handed the bag to John. John sighed fondly. “You're crazy, do you know that?” He said and left to put the bag safely in Mike's bedroom. “I'll open it later okay? We're still setting things up a bit. Molly is here though, you can sit down with her if you want.” John said and nodded to the sofa. Sherlock looked at Molly and tried not to roll his eyes. So giddy, like always. “I'll do that...” Sherlock murmured,  but really didn't want to leave John's side. John smiled. “Don't worry so much alright? You'll be fine. I'm here and if something happens that you don't like you just come to me okay?” John said and Sherlock smiled, nodding softly before heading over to Molly like he had been told to do, thinking that that was the safest option for now since John clearly was busy.
Hello everyone! Yes, this was, very late, but I'm sure like all of you I was caught in the haze of Sherlock season 4! But now that that's over, I'm hoping to evolve this story even more! I wanted their characters to change a bit, to keep things more eager and fun, so this one is a short intro which shows how John has become more comfortable, as well as Sherlock. So don't be alarmed that they've changed a bit, I'm doing it for the story's sake so that it doesn't get boring for me to write and boring for you to read! Hope you are all okay and thank you for sticking with me! //NightOfFanfics
John jumped around with his mates happily, people starting to slowly come down from the bleachers to congratulate them. He looked up, seeing Sherlock cheering. He smiled. So Sherlock had actually stayed and cheered him on? Sherlock bit his lip nervously, not sure what to do as he suddenly caught John's gaze. “I'll be right back yeah? And then we'll head to that pizza place to celebrate.” John nodded and began jumping up the bleachers towards Sherlock.
“That’s great, it’s very kind of you, androids need support as well sometimes,” Mike nodded and then glanced towards the kitchen. “I’d… Love to meet him, have breakfast with you two? If that’s alright?” Mike said carefully and John thought for a second before nodding, leading Mike inside and to the kitchen. Mike smiled warmly at Sherlock who sat in his chair, but Sherlock glared back at him with narrowed eyes. “Heya there, Sherlock was it?” Mike said and sat down next to him. Sherlock frowned and shifted his chair away a few steps closer to John’s chair. John looked at him but didn’t say anything yet.
“Well then, you seem to know who I am, who the hell are you and where am I?” John said with a firm voice, glaring at the other. The man straightened up and cleared his throat.
“Jesus John.” Mike said, meeting up with John in the school hallway. John sighed. “Is it that bad?” He said, tilting his bruised up face towards Mike. Mike sighed. “Well it's not pretty.” He said and scratched the back of his head. “What happened?” He asked, looking at John worriedly. John bit his lip, rubbing his neck. “Well... Sherlock gave me a ride home, as you know and, well, my dad saw the car...” John trailed off. “I had no idea he would react that way. He was so... angry...” John whispered. He continued chatting with Mike, leaning against the locker. A bit further away, Sherlock was coming around the corner and saw the back of John's head. He smiled eagerly. He had washed John's shirt and was wearing it today as a surprise, and he hoped John would like it. He wasn't sure though, maybe he was just being weird. He rushed up behind John, trying to contain a giggle. “Good morning John-” Sherlock stopped. His eyes widened. John had turned around at his soft giggle, and he could see his face clearly now in the morning sunlight coming in through the big glass windows of the school. “What- What happened-” Sherlock whispered, gripping his book tightly to his chest. “I'll see you later John.” Mike said, deciding it was best to leave them alone. John smiled a little. “Morning Sherlock.” He said, tilting his head. He sighed. “Well, I'm sure you can guess, or deduce it as you call it.” John said and nodded. “I'm fine, it's just nasty bruises, honest.” John said and continued smiling. The last thing he wanted was for Sherlock to feel bad about this. Sherlock bit his lip, not really feeling like it was fine at all. “Nice shirt.” John said and smiled broader. Sherlock frowned. “Nice-... Oh...” He said, having forgotten all about his idea. He looked down on himself, licking his bottom lip. “I- I washed it-” Was that really what he followed up with? God, he was a complete idiot. John chuckled. “Well it probably needed a wash. Looks good on you. You can keep it.” He said, even though he knew it was his only nice shirt that didn't look old and tattered. Sherlock blushed, swinging a bit from side to side. “Thank you, I-” “Oh gosh darnit! Did he do it again?” A woman's voice interrupted Sherlock. John sighed. “Molly, I'm fine okay?” He said as she moved between him and Sherlock, starting to fuss and touch his bruises. John flinched. “Molls.” He said sternly and she took away her hand, looking back at Sherlock. “Oh, hi Sherlock.” She said and blushed, smiling at him kindly. Sherlock glanced over at Molly. “Hello Hooper.” He said simply before moving close to John again. “I know something that can help with the bruising. Meet me by the school nurse's office after class okay?” Sherlock said quickly and blushed a little before hurrying off to his classroom.
I know the pacing and split-up of the chapters are a bit strange at the moment, hope to get into a better groove soon and I hope you don't mind it too much!
“I think we can end early for today. You seem to have your schedule full anyway with your new… Friend,” Ella said and gave John a knowing smile before she headed to the door and out from the warm flat. John stood alone in the living room, nodding his head slightly.
”Hey mate! What are we planning for your eighteenth birthday huh?” Mike asked as he ran up to John who was tossing the rugby ball from one hand to another. John shrugged. “I don't know, I don't really feel like doing anything special.” John sighed and looked at his friend. Mike frowned. “Oh come on, don't leave me and the team hanging! We were looking forward to a party or something, alcohol and everything!” Mike complained, nudging John in the back. John rolled his eyes. “You sound like a twat when you get excited about alcohol, what are you, twelve or something?” John said and rubbed a hand through his hair. It was a nice day outside and it was warm enough so that he only wore his tanktop. Across the hallway, he spotted a lanky teen with dark tussled curls. “Hey Mike, is that the new kid?” John said and nodded towards the lanky teen. Mike nodded. “Yeah, uhm, I think his name was Sherlock or something.” Mike said with a shrug. “He's in our parallel class though, I hear he's pretty smart.” Mike said and leaned against the locker. John looked over at him with a nod. “Pretty smart huh?” He said and smiled a little. “No one is 'pretty smart' in our school Mike.” He said and chuckled. “Only twats here.” John said and laughed.
John laid in his bed staring up at the ceiling. Listening for… Something. Granted, he was hoping the loading thing wouldn’t sound like much but… It was deathly quiet. He narrowed his eyes, as if he could look through the ceiling with x-ray vision, though of course, he couldn’t… Maybe Sherlock could. Did he have x-ray vision? God, he hoped not. John rubbed his forehead with a sigh. Should he go upstairs and check on him? What if something had gone wrong again? John started feeling anxious, not for his usual reasons but for Sherlock…
“Alright okay, that’s enough, let’s eat yeah?” John cut Sherlock off quickly and patted his shoulder. Sherlock only smiled and nodded, digging into his eggs as well. Mike just let out a fond snort and shook his head, taking a bite of the eggs and sausage.
It was impossible for John to go back to sleep, and Sherlock was putting on quite a good show of making John believe that the taller teen was in fact asleep himself. John cleared his throat, trying to move just a little since his arm was falling asleep. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to very slowly shift around. Sherlock was trying his best to not burst into a fit of giggles as John tried to slowly rearrange himself. He could definitely have some more fun with this. “Huh? Nnnh- What are you doing?” Sherlock mumbled in a fake sleepy manner, rubbing his eyes with a soft pout. John's whole face turned red and he quickly licked his lips. “I- I was just- My arm- It was sort of- falling asleep-” He stuttered, licking his lips nervously once more. Sherlock looked up at John, still sporting a big pout, his curls all tangled and all over the place. “You woke me up from my beauty sleep.” Sherlock grumbled and John couldn't help himself as he started to chuckle. “Beauty? Well, maybe your face but not your hair.” He laughed, but soon blushed as he realised he had practically said that Sherlock had a beautiful face. Sherlock was quite shocked by that fact as well, his jaw dropping just a little. But then, his lips quirked up in an enourmous grin. “You think I'm beautiful?” Sherlock daringly asked, smirking at John. John blushed more, backing away a little. “I, uhm,” He stuttered. Damn, too much, Sherlock thought to himself. “I'm kidding John.” Sherlock said, trying to turn the situation back to being happy and giggly. John smiled. “Oh, heh,” John said and rubbed his neck a little. Sherlock rolled away a bit and snuggled up against the pillow.
“I mean... You're not ugly exactly...” John said after a moment of thought, looking down at his hands. Sherlock squinted his eyes a bit. Was that supposed to be a compliment? “Thanks... I guess.” Sherlock mumbled awkwardly. Damn, that was not right, John thought to himself. “Sorry, I meant that you are, you know, beautiful.” John murmured and turned to look at Sherlock, no matter how embarrassed he felt by saying that. Sherlock smiled once again. “Really? You think so?” He asked, wanting to hear John say it again. And again. And preferably a million times more. John smiled shyly back and nodded. “Really, I do think so. You... You have very uhm, beautiful facial features and uhm, your hair is always so soft and, you dress well. Unlike Mike who would wear sweatpants all year round if he could.” John said and chuckled a little. Sherlock cheeks had changed into an even darker shade of red and he nodded softly. “Thank you John... And... And I think you're very beautiful too...” Sherlock manage to murmur after a long train of thought that would probably have taken the average person a whole day to think through but for him it took merely a few seconds. Maybe he was crossing boundaries once again, but right now they were complimenting each other, so it should be fine. “I like your lovely blonde hair, and I like the fact that you can dress in anything and still look wonderful. Not many men can do that.” Sherlock admitted shyly, biting his lip. John was also blushing a deeper shade of red now and he shook his head fondly. “Oh stop it... You can't be serious about that. I... I have to go to the loo...” John suddenly said, having to interrupt this very out of the ordinary situation he had been put in.  “I'll only be a moment.” John said and crawled out of bed and hurried to the bathroom.
“”Great. I'm really an alright bloke you know. I'm not sure why you are being all defensive against me. I'm not out to hurt you or anything. Promise. And you know what they say, a baboon's promise lasts forever. JW”” John sent and chuckled to himself.
“Must be difficult having a father who doesn't want you to play sports and is taking his suppressed anger out on his family and his drinking habits.” Sherlock said outloud, looking at John. John froze, looking over at Sherlock. “What the-” John stuttered and looked at Mike who quickly shook his head. “I haven't told him anything I swear.” Mike said quickly, looking just as shocked. John looked back at Sherlock. “Who- Who told you that? Who told you those things?” John said, his voice upset. Sherlock stood up quickly and started to back away. Uh oh. He'd done it again. “I- I didn't- No one has-” Sherlock stuttered, holding up his hands, ready to shield himself. John stood up and started moving towards him. “You rich snob.” He hissed and took another step forward. Sherlock backed away, shaking his head. “I'm- I'm sorry-” He said, his face getting paler. John's entire face wrinkled into something mean and upset looking. “And here I thought you actually were an alright bloke to hang out with. But you're clearly not. So sod off yeah? And stay out of my personal life.” John said, giving Sherlock a push that send him a few steps back before hurrying towards his classroom, Mike quickly following him.
Sherlock practically froze by his wardrobe. In his /underwear/? Sherlock shivered pleasantly, and hoped John didn't notice it. “Oh... That's... That's fine by me... If it's fine by you...” Sherlock said, turning back around, licking his bottom lip. John smiled and nodded. “Yeah, it's fine.” He agreed, rubbing his neck a little. Sherlock smiled. “Great. Great, I'll just... I'll just slip into the bathroom real quick... Brush my teeth and all of that... I'll get you a toothbrush as well just...” Sherlock trailed off and then hurried into the en suite. John smiled and chuckled a little to himself as he began pulling off his clothes. He first pulled off his shirt and then he unbuttoned his trousers, blushing a little as he did so. He groaned and face-palmed himself when he realised he had put his bright red boxers on. “God, on any given day you could've put these on...” He grumbled to himself but kicked his trousers off anyway. He folded his trousers and shirt as neatly as he could (which wasn't very neatly at all) and put it on Sherlock's dresser, turning around, shivering a little. Even though it was still quite warm outside, Sherlock's room was a bit drafty and chilly.
