John took a step forward, but his sudden yell had been enough to freeze Mrs. Hudson in place. She was staring wide eyed at John’s outstretched hand, hovering over Sherlock’s chair, duster not yet touching the leather.
John stared at the door for a minute more before straightening, tilting his chin upward. The familiarity of the posture adjustment calmed him some, and he closed his eyes, basking in it for a moment, ignoring the pain in his leg until he couldn’t anymore. He groaned softly when he sat down in Sherlock’s desk chair, straightening his leg out beneath it in a way that reminded him of the many times he’d done it out of habit and his foot would nudge between Sherlock’s. Neither of them ever said anything about the subtle contact, they just worked like that, typing separately but together all the same. John pressed his lips into a hard line, worrying the inside of his cheek. The lump was back, lodge in his throat.
“John.. I’m sorry…” For a moment John thought she was apologizing for her treatment towards Sherlock. Actually
“Sherlock..” John’s voice was soft, much more serious than before. Sherlock took the hint. They needed this. They needed words—good, solid words—not to dance around each other.
, to realization, to understanding, to sad, to pity. Then he just nodded, lips pressed into that familiar thin frown, and John listened to him trod down the stairs.
Sherlock heard a clatter that sounded like John throwing his cup in the sink, “Yes. Yes, you should.”
“Right, well, you’ll come with me, okay? You’re staying with me tonight and as long as you need afterwards… John,” Greg hesitated, then he felt his hand press comfortingly to his shoulder, “anything you need. Okay? Anything you need.”
Sherlock turned, starting slightly. He looked down at John whose cheeks were pink from going from the warm shop to the cold early morning.
John rolled his eyes, eyes crinkling in a smile, “Stop looking at me like that, of course I remembered.”
on John’s face, the kind that would melt into relief, maybe even a slightly uncharacteristic hug. It might be a briefer display of emotion due to the public eye but at least Sherlock would know it was alright now.
Sherlock watched the neon sign of the 24 hour cafe catch John’s eye, and nodded quietly when he asked if he wanted a tea for the road. He waited, hands clasped behind his back and facing the street while John went in. He felt good about how things were going so far. John seemed… Sherlock closed his eyes. John seemed like he wanted Sherlock to think he was okay. Sherlock almost felt disappointed that John thought he couldn’t see through that.
But then Sherlock shows up to a crime scene one day with his pupils blown wide and his clothes barely buttoned properly, looking around the room like any second someone’s going to come out of the shadows and stab him.
A content warning for a very brief, fleeting mention of suicide before reading.  Also, this chapter is solely AdLock. So if that doesn't particularly tickle your fancy, I'll just say that though it may outwardly be AdLock, I can assure you there's more than meets the eye going on.  But if it really bothers you, feel free to skip this chapter! : ]
Again, Sherlock throws him a confused look as he says, “No, she yelled at me constantly about not standing on her tables.  She bought them all at auctions an--”
Sometimes life has a pretty cruel way of sidelining you for ridiculous amounts of time.  Sometimes it knows just what to do to keep you from hobbies, passion projects, pasttimes, and plain old happiness.  Memento for me was just a fun thing to do in between school work and grad school and research, and it was a way to traverse my mental health issues.  I’m not a writer by any stretch of the imagination; I’ve only ever written research papers about the Roman Republic and Empire.  I don’t think I’m even all that good at it, but I like doing it and I’ve thought about finishing this project for years now.  So that’s what I’m finally doing.  My apologies to anyone, if there is anyone out there, who has been frustrated at the lack of update on my part.  And I’m sorry I feel like I’m making a bigger deal about this than I should by making this author’s note.  I just wanted to offer some sort of explanation as to why it’s been over three years since I’ve touched this fic, and why it’s important to me that I finish it.  Writing this fic, when I was actively writing it, was such a source of creativity and exploration for me, and a way to wind down from a long day of researching Persephone or Eusebius or human sacrifice in the Roman Republic (AMA, I wrote my MA dissertation on it lololol). It was there for me in between long Sherlock hiatuses and also when I was feeling depressed or lost or listless or the worst I’ve ever felt.  So I owe it to myself and this fic to finish it.  So here I go, about to finish this fic.
He reached out, tilting John’s face towards him and, for once, acted without logic, without thinking. He kissed him. He kissed John because he loved him, because he always had, and because it said everything he couldn’t. He kissed him because sorry wasn’t enough—he was sorry, he was in love.
They both began moving, just as frantically as before, almost viciously fucking, and yet still loving in equal measure.
John's eyes had landed on the dressing table. Yes, Sherlock had been right, the man's partner would have easily spotted and questioned a collection of wedding rings, on the other hand, it would be the perfect place to hide them because it would be the last place the police, or a genius like Sherlock, would look.
He sent one more measuring glance at John's small form before he turned and left, merely telling his son to set them up with shotguns.
Some kind of Butler opened the door, and only Sherlock's hand on the small of his back kept John moving. The dark grey suit Sherlock had gotten made for him made the Doctor feel like something out of a cheesy movie, but he determinedly did not tug at the sleeves, keeping his nerves centred inwards.
John had never seen Mycroft at a loss for words but he simply smiled at her. She seemed to have the same affect on everyone she met, not just John and even Sherlock seemed content to simply
John levelled a stare at him that had Sherlock swallowing a single mouthful of chicken salad before the army doctor nodded in concession and stood, leaving money for their meal on the table.
"Now, John, I want you now" the detective hissed drawing a shuddering groan from John, as he pressed a harsh kiss to his lovers mouth, his tongue sucked mercilessly into Sherlock as he pressed against the man.
Why had he woken up when his skull had obviously been bashed in, judging by the amount of pain he was in?
Occasionally John would glance at Sherlock, to see the man studying the dangers with a sharp intense gaze, and other times Sherlock would have his eyes pressed closed, and his head tipped as he studied the notes of the musicians with a musician's ear.
"But you're still getting the why wrong in the process... I wasn't attempting to disturb your rest, or prematurely bring you back to London to help me... I merely saw an opportunity John"
The first of December, John's money from the Army went into his bank. He paid the water, sewage, and his half of Mrs Hudson's rent, before digging Sherlock's bank card out of the man's wallet without drawing a flicker of attention and paying the electric, gas and the other half of the rent. It was normal now for John to simply pay Sherlock's half of the rent and utilities with the detectives cards, and as he finished he glanced over at the man lying on the sofa with his eyes closed. Sherlock wasn't asleep.
any of you plans, I hope" Sherlock muttered and John froze, his hand still wrapped round the cup he'd just put down.
"No one can interfere, not unless we let them..." Sherlock pulled back and John caught his lips swiftly, gently, almost a brush of skin against skin rather than a kiss filled with emotion.
Sliding a nail under the Christmas paper, Dimmock peeled it open like he was diffusing a bomb, and when nothing actually exploded, he tipped the contents out of the open end, onto his desk.
John had already dialled the number he'd been looking for on his mobile, and Sherlock sat up with his eyes narrowed in that way John knew meant he was trying to work out his motives.
His brow was creased and his soft mouth turned down and his eyes distant even as they sparkled in the golden sunlight blazing through the windows of 221B, bathing the doctor and softening him until he looked almost ethereal, and warm and utterly beautiful.
John wilted, too tired to bother continuing the argument over Sherlock's latest experiment and merely passed over the files.
Mycroft stared at John for a moment before he sighed and sat down "How much warning did Sherlock give you?"
That did it. Sherlock laughed suddenly, his whole body rocking as he chuckled, and John couldn't help but grin along with him.
Sherlock on the other hand was still smirking as he smothered the remainder of his laughter, "No, not me."
The doctor swallowed, a thin trickle escaping down his chin, that he wiped off slowly as he sat up, knowing Sherlock was watching him. He smirked up at his lover, and Sherlock grinned back, dragging John back onto the sofa to straddle his hips as they reignited their kisses. He could taste himself in the doctor's mouth and he groaned, while John shuddered once again as his now hard cock pressed against the detective's stomach. Their hands continued to roam, nipping at each others bodies, and dragging nails across pale skin, like marking territory.
They sat in a balcony box watching the small troupe of male ballet dancers perform a beautiful rendition of Swan Lake, sitting in surprising silence as the twelve elegant figures of the swans leapt and danced their way across the stage in motions that were almost beyond fluid and the form of the prince was cowering away.
There was still the tree to decorate, it had taken him the better part of an hour to put the damn thing up, and make sure it was over the blanket he'd put down to catch the needles. All the better for cleaning up after Christmas.
"Well, Dan had a brother, a twin brother, also in the forces, and also in our squad... they were pretty close too, they could practically communicate without words, they were the perfect scouts..."
As their front door was pushed shut, their lips crashed together and one of them groaned quietly, but John could feel the shaking in Sherlock's hands, and pulled back gently.
"Then why?" John's voice was muffled against Sherlocks shirt, but the man knew what John was asking.
Mycroft knew, after all, what John's Christmas present to Sherlock was, and it seemed strange to John that a parade was blocking their way home, a parade that happened to have exactly eleven drummers in it's band.
The man hissed as John gently brushed away at the burn with a soft sterile cloth, before gently directing the plumber to the sink in corner of the room and running the mans' hand under the water.
The doctor cleared his throat, and finally turned back to Sarah, "You're my boss, that's fine, but I finished my shift 30 minutes ago, so if it's not a problem, it think it's beyond time I went home".
Both men felt the pleasant tension between them spike, and John felt his gaze drop down Sherlock's face without his consent, he did narrow them, however, at the confident smirk he found on the other mans lips.
John had barely pulled on a pair of white latex gloves when his patient stumbled through the door, hissing softly when his hand caught on the door.
"If she doesn't like your humour, or spots those army tattoos, I don't care... you're not here for them, you've come for me, and I know that..." he bit John's ear softly, careful not to mark it, and felt his lovers breath catch, and strong hands twitch as John fought to keep them from twining into Sherlock's hair.
"No, not surprised either, more disappointed that you couldn't find something other than the wall to shoot..."
Sherlock couldn't find a motive for Mr Osman to murder his wife. It was clear that they'd loved each other, that they'd been married many years, from their possessions and photographs happily, and it had stumped Sherlock. He'd, reluctantly, told Lestrade he'd have to think about it, and the inspector told him he'd need an answer within 48 hours.
Mrs Hudson hugged him, a few tears escaping, "Oh you lads are the nicest tenants I've ever rented too!" she pulled back, and took in John's flushed embarrassment with a grin, "but..."
"He's played his violin all night, for three nights straight... He's blown up the microwave, I don't even want to ask him what's on the inside of the oven, I order food and it gets used in his newest experiment that he then looses interest in, when I left he was drilling a hole in the ceiling through to my room, now are you going to
"It's no good, we'll have to wait it out, there's not another safe route round this pandemonium what with all the ice."
A pillow fell, rubbing Johns cheek and the shifting kept the thing batting at his face, so John simply grabbed it to keep it still, and groaned loudly into Sherlock's mouth when long fingers wrapped around his length, dragging along him in quick motions that had John writhing beneath his lover, crying loudly.
He heard someone behind him hiss, and mutter something about "Seven years bad luck...!" and John couldn't stop the slow grin from creeping over his face. The speaker was right, and that's exactly what Mr Martin had been banking on.
When John's hands came up to tangle in long black curls, Sherlock smirked at the gasp he heard from somewhere to his right. Maybe she'd thought John would punch him, or at least back away horrified, but to watch her work colleague not only give in and surrender to Sherlock, but to actively partake, Sarah was shocked. It was all in that single gasp.
in the living room and sips his scotch on the couch and pretends not to notice John listening to him sing quietly from the kitchen.
What people don’t seem to realize is that Sherlock’s powers of deduction aren’t so much an involuntary ability as they are a learned skill.  Yes, Sherlock’s parents have had his IQ tested and yes, it’s very high.  Yes, he’s much more observant than the average person, and it’s not that he can’t keep his mouth shut but that he just doesn’t see the point of doing so.
A few years later at university, there’d been a girl called Samantha.  She didn’t have many friends either, but she was a genius at chemistry and Sherlock loved talking to her about all their different experiments.  One night in the lab, while they’d been working on a difficult project for their class, Samantha had kissed him and he kissed her back.  Sherlock remembers being nervous with Samantha too because he’d never been with a woman and was afraid he wouldn’t know how to please her.  But Samantha had been a willing teacher and Sherlock loved to learn new things.
“Then I started listening to Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam and Nirvana and Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots and it was just…”  Sherlock stops and looks at John.  This is the most personal Sherlock has ever been with him.  “It just helped me not feel so much like a freak.”
To anyone still following this, my sincerest apologies on neglecting this story.  What with moving to London and starting postgrad school, things have been hectic and life has been happening and I'm afraid my hobbies have taken a backseat to my research.  I do promise to try to be more on top of things though.  Thanks for sticking around, you're super cool.
It was all he could think, which felt oddly to Sherlock like it was stretching out far longer than it actually was.  He tries to slow down and deduce what’s happening, but he’s too stunned and nervous to think properly, to see what needs to be seen.
To make matters worse, the inn they’re staying at couldn’t do them a double room.  The idea of staying in a single room with John leaves Sherlock feeling…what is it?  Anxious?  Insecure?  Worried?  Excited?  Is there a word that conveys all of those emotions together?  If there is, Sherlock can’t think of it right now.  His mind is working too fast, what with the prospect of having to sleep in the same bed as John and also trying to gather as much information as he can about Henry’s hound.  Sherlock desperately wants a cigarette, maybe even two.  Possibly the whole pack, he can’t quite decide.  He’s just trying to remain calm and push his feelings about John out of his head.  They’re just not rational and they don’t belong there.
Lestrade tells Sherlock he doesn’t stay because he trusts him and that he knows Sherlock won’t break that trust.  It’s this that makes Sherlock stay off the drugs.  Lestrade is the first person to trust Sherlock implicitly, even after he knew what Sherlock got up to behind closed doors.  Secretly, Sherlock is thankful Lestrade stays with him, even if only for a little while.  He doesn’t want to break his promise.
John remembers that night with alarmingly Sherlockian detail.  He also remembers it was a week before Sherlock committed suicide.  He remembers it was seven days before Sherlock stood on the roof of St Bart’s and told him he was nothing more than a lie.  He remembers it was 168 hours before Sherlock told him to keep his eyes fixed on him, as if there was ever any other place John ever looked.  He remembers it was 10,080 minutes before he watched the love of his life throw himself off a four story building and land squarely on his head.
“All right,” he says, wiping his mouth.  His body language tells Sherlock that he’s ready to cooperate with him and not poke fun at him anymore.  “Go on, then.  I promise I won’t laugh,” John tells him.  Sherlock sighs and gives in.
Mycroft once called him unapologetic.  One of the times he dumped him in a fancy rehab.  He said Sherlock was an unapologetic little prick who didn’t care who he hurt in his quest to hurt himself.
“You’re thinking about….” she trails off, kissing the curvature of his jawline and cheekbones.  He closes his eyes again and tries to imagine John’s lips.  John placing well meaning kisses on his face, the heat of John’s body against his chest, the weight of John’s bones resting in his lap.
“Wonder where Angelo got off to…” John says under his breath as he cranes his neck to see if he can spot the man.  Finally he catches him and orders a scotch.
He continues to work Sherlock’s cock with his hand, adding the twist at the end he’s come to realise Sherlock loves.  He can feel the slick of pre-come on his hand now, so he stops, earning a childish huff at the cessation.
Sherlock wastes no time, he slides into Irene’s hot, dripping center and sees stars again.  He moans unapologetically for the first time and falls onto Irene’s back as he gets used to the feeling of being wrapped around something as tight and firm as Irene’s pussy.  She braces herself with her hand against the armrest and pushes back against him, moaning
His mind and his heart, always warring.  He wants to get off, he wants this release.  He wants it like he wants the chase, like he wants cocaine, like he wants to always be right.
Sherlock’s never told anyone about this.  Everyone already thinks he’s freakish enough.  But then, Sherlock doesn’t really have any friends to tell this to anyway.  He’s got his skull, but he doesn’t really count, does he?
And John does as he’s told again, not missing a beat as he sticks in his ring finger, finding Sherlock’s prostate and making him buck his hips up involuntarily.
“Fine.  One last one.”  Mycroft straightens himself and looks out the window of the sitting room.  “Mrs Spencer, across the way,” he points lazily.
John remembers this moment well.  He remembers it was the moment he knew he was meant for Sherlock Holmes.
John clears his throat and says in a strained voice, “I’ll be back in a little bit, I need to think.”
Secretly, Sherlock loves that John was shot.  Secretly, he’s thankful for it.  Secretly, Sherlock tells himself that it’s what brought John to him.
the British government.  Sherlock pretends he doesn’t know Mycroft has arranged for him to have access to lab supplies simply because it’s convenient for him and it keeps his boredom at bay.
“All right now?”  Sherlock asks, practically waiting on bated breath for John’s response.  John’s face softens again into a smile and he reaches out for Sherlock to join him back in bed.  Sherlock wastes no time in complying, he climbs back in next to John and fastens himself to his doctor.  It’s almost like they were made for each other, they way their bodies perfectly form together, how the peaks of John’s body corresponds to the valleys of Sherlock’s and vice versa.
Sherlock remembers his eyes closing involuntarily when he feels John’s hand dip down under his pajamas and grip him tight.  He remembers he must have made a stupid face because he hears John laugh softly and then feels John’s other hand on his cheek.
Sherlock supposes it’s hard because this skeleton only recently ceased to be a person.  This person left a wake of devastation after his death.  This person can still be felt by the people he left behind.
Sherlock hears John banging around the kitchen, grunting his frustration and annoyance.  He hears John mutter, “All I want is some fucking milk, is that so much to ask?” before he leaves the flat for the surgery.  Sherlock chuckles softly and burrows back into his covers and pillows.
“It used to hurt knowing that my sister loved alcohol more than she loved me.”  He says it with ease, dropping back into that same clinical tone from before.  But any other person, any emotionally mature, kind, sensitive person would have picked up on the latent twinge of regret and grief in John’s voice.  But Sherlock is none of those things, is he?
“She came home for Christmas one year.  I was 17, getting ready to start uni soon.  It was like a stranger walked into the house.  She’d cut all her hair off, she had a hoop in her nose, huge bags under her eyes from the insomnia,” he huffs.  “She looked awful,” John adds under his breath.
But Sherlock doesn’t do cocaine anymore.  He remembers he made a promise to Lestrade, of all people.
So when Sherlock thought he was getting his chance to finally fight back for her, he felt just and righteous.  But then he heard Samantha scream, and he realized he was on the verge of becoming the monster that was Mr Hudson.  Sherlock begged her to forgive him, cried about how he’d never hurt her.  But Samantha couldn’t take it anymore.  She left Sherlock to save herself.  She never looked back.
John remembers Sherlock starts in with his mile a minute deductions about why John is even there and potentially becoming flatmates and confirming that yes, he was indeed a soldier in Afghanistan.  John is almost creeped out by how quickly this man seems to uncover his life story until he unknowingly challenges him to dig even deeper. John remembers the look on Sherlock’s face when he plunges into his deductions.  It’s a face he will, unbeknownst to him, see so, so many more times in the years to come. John stands bewildered as Sherlock exposes so many things about him, his vocation, his military career, where he was stationed, his dodgy leg that’s all just John’s doing.  He’s thrown off kilter so much by these revelations that he doesn’t even notice properly that Sherlock says he has a brother instead of a sister because
Sherlock doesn’t look up from his microscope.  He’s examining a dish of blood and doesn’t want to miss the reaction it has to potassium chlorate.
?” John thinks to himself amidst the flurry of deductions and insults to the woman who just walked in the room.  He’s disoriented and even a little offended if he’s honest with himself. But if he’s going to continue to be honest with himself, he might as well admit that Sherlock’s attempts to preemptively push him away are not working.  Because as long as he’s being honest, there’s something about this man that is so pleasantly strange and unpredictable. As long as he’s being honest with himself, he’s absolutely captivated by this man.
Sherlock continues, “Prone to anxiety disorders judging by the biting of his nails and wrinkles around his lips.  He also seems to have adhered to Hinduism, possibly for his wife.”
“Mummy says I’m smarter than the other children,” Sherlock says, ignoring Mycroft’s order to leave and instead climbing up onto Mycroft’s four-poster and flopping down on his stomach.  “Mummy says that’s why they’re so mean to me.”  Mycroft closes his book and turns towards Sherlock with a tight smile on his face.
“Do I really do that good of a job hiding it?”  Sherlock asks, a tone of desperation betraying his true feelings.  John’s expression softens at once.  “I thought it was obvious.  I thought
And Sherlock barely makes a sound.  He can’t remember the last time someone sucked him off, can’t believe he forgot how unbelievably amazing it feels, can’t believe he convinced himself he didn’t need this in his life.  But still, the nagging feeling won’t subside.
“Hey, you all right?” Sherlock whispers tenderly.  He cups John’s cheek and waits for him to respond. John breathes him in and just stares.
“Yes, his wife,” Sherlock says, brandishing a picture of the couple at their traditional Hindu ceremony and handing it to Lestrade.
“Why don’t we move to the bedroom,” the woman suggests in a breathy voice.  John plants another kiss on her lips, this time more passionately, before he takes her hand and turns around.
Sherlock pretends to watch telly for a little while longer as the pressure in his trousers gets heavier.  But then he hears John moan and he can’t take it anymore.  He goes to his room and doesn’t even try to push John out of his mind palace.  He imagines its John’s hand on him, warm and strong, pumping up and down.  John’s lips kissing him, slow and gentle at first and then rough and passionate, a gnashing of teeth and tongues.  He hears John moaning and Sherlock imagines pinning John to the bed and making him moan into his mouth.  He imagines trailing wet kisses down John’s body and continues to stroke himself, now with more vigor and urgency.
“Okay…” John says dejectedly and turns around.  He still doesn’t understand that Sherlock’s not ignoring him to be rude; it’s just that he doesn’t want to miss anything.
“What sort of music did you like when you were a kid?”  John asks one night.  They’re eating at Sherlock’s favorite Chinese where he can always predict the fortune cookies.  Well, almost always.  Tonight Sherlock’s eating normally so he can carry on conversation like a regular person.
Face down, wrapped up in his covers, Sherlock opens a bleary eye at the sound of John howling his name from the kitchen.
R&R?? My lady loves Persephone, Venus, and Mary shine most favourably on those who take a second to give a kind word to a stranger! XX K
Sherlock remembers hearing the door click open softly and John slide in quietly behind it.  He has an aura of caution, mindfulness about him, like he’s trying to seem as invisible as possible.  Sherlock realises it’s nearly midnight and that John will have expected Sherlock to be asleep by the time he got back.  A quick sniff of the air tells Sherlock John’s not as drunk as he thought he’d be.  John got three, perhaps four scotches in down at the pub before it closed up for the night.  John moves around the room as silently as possible.  In and out of the en suite, changing out of his jeans and button up shirt to his boxers and old army shirt.  John nearly makes Sherlock burst out into a fit of laughter when he almost knocks himself over trying to get his left sock off.  Maybe he’s a little drunker than Sherlock thought.
bullshit you love to throw at me,” John bursts out suddenly.  He takes several steps back from Sherlock, tries to calm his breathing, and looks down at his shoe when he says, “I want to hear you say it.”
As ever, thank you so much for reading and supporting my amateur creativity with your kind words. It really does mean a lot to me. From this medicated and mighty grrrl to you, darling friends, thank you. xxxxxxx
John remembers the joke he said to Sherlock that was only half a joke but didn’t realise at the time.  He wants to break the tension, disperse the negative ions in the air that Moriarty and his snipers created by simply existing.  He wants to run out of that pool as fast as he can, get as far away from this Moriarty as possible. But his legs give out and he can’t find the wherewithal to even try to stand up.  Sherlock sputters out a thank you for what John tried to do, tried to sacrifice himself so that Sherlock could run and get away because that’s what you do when you love someone.
as she does it, feeling him burrow deeper into her.  He wraps a strong arm around her torso and pulls her back as he straightens himself, feeling her move slowly up and down on his cock because he doesn’t have the willpower yet to do it himself.
He inspects Sherlock for a moment.  “You’re lying,” John says finally, turning back to the bathroom to finish his shower.
Sherlock remembers John climbing the stairs two at a time and slamming the door to his room without so much as a grunt of acknowledgment.  Sherlock also remembers John didn’t come out for a day and a half.
John sees a reminder notification.  He has an appointment with Ella in an hour.  He swipes the notification away, ignoring it.
John looks up and stops working Sherlock’s hole long enough to see that Sherlock is begging and he never begs.  John slowly, wordlessly, stalks up Sherlock’s body. He hovers over him for a few long moments and stares into Sherlock’s eyes.  His pupils are blown wide with desire, his chest and cheeks flushed red with arousal, his forehead and curls coated with sweat.
Sherlock’s eyes widen when John starts actually screaming.  His heart starts pounding wildly in his chest.  His breathing hitches and picks up.  But he stays silent.  He knows anything he says might make John libel to haul him off the couch and punch him in the mouth just to get him to shut up.
Sherlock desperately tries to pay attention to the programme and ignore what John’s doing right now.  But all he can hear is that woman’s exaggerated moaning because she knows Sherlock is listening and it’s driving him crazy.  It’s been a long time since Sherlock has had sex.  Everyone assumes he’s a virgin because he just doesn’t give a shit about who’s sleeping with whom, but he isn’t.  He just can’t find anyone who doesn’t annoy him or bore him.  He just can’t find anyone he likes or trusts enough.  He doesn’t care because he’s married to his work, but its times like this that Sherlock thinks it would be nice to have someone to get off with.
He counts it every night before he goes to sleep, a night time ritual to help him calm down and signal to his body that rest is on the way.
“I can’t sleep in that bed with you because…”  His voice breaks.  He hates himself for opening this door because he doesn’t think he can walk through it now.  He’s never felt more nervous and scared.  What if he says the wrong thing?  What he pushes John away?  What if he laughs at him?  What if he moves out?  What if he leaves him all alone again? Sherlock doesn’t know if he can do this without John, not anymore.  He doesn’t think he’d want to.
Moriarty laughs hysterically.  John tries to blink out S-O-S in morse code to Sherlock, but he’s obviously not receiving it and John feels so completely helpless in this moment.
Sherlock remembers that first night back in Baker Street after Dartmoor.  John seems to be pretending that what happened the night before hadn’t actually happened at all.  It’s as though everything is perfectly normal between the two of them.  John goes straight into the bathroom for a shower, and then immediately up to his room and shuts the door quietly behind him.  Sherlock turns on the telly and makes himself a cup of tea, accidentally on purpose adding too much sugar to it, and pretends to pay attention to
Sherlock is lost in the notes and Jónsi’s voice, so he doesn’t notice when John comes upstairs from Mrs Hudson’s flat.  He doesn’t notice John sets a scotch down on the coffee table for him.  He doesn’t notice when John sits down in his chair and listens to the music with him.  He doesn’t notice that John watches him for the rest of the night.
So when he laughs and tells John he’s not the first person to ask who’d have him for a flatmate, John decides to let Mike march him into one the labs at Bart’s to meet this person.  Mike doesn’t tell him anything about them, only that he has to meet them in the flesh to really believe such a person could actually exist. John is intrigued and just a little incredulous that whomever he’s about to meet could be so mysterious or otherworldly or...whatever, he doesn’t even know.  All he can do is limp as fast as he can into his old stomping grounds and hope this turns into something worth competing with crippling depression and war torn memories.
This chapter, as implied by the title, is all about Sherlock's drug addiction.  So please read with caution if you have any drug addiction triggers or are working through an addiction yourself.  And if you are struggling through an addiction of any kind, remember that you are so brave and so worthy of life and happiness -- and I believe in you. <3
“Mycroft, do you have any friends at Oxford?”  Sherlock asks as a way of announcing himself.  Mycroft throws a look of disdain at Sherlock over his shoulder.
Sherlock remembers that was the day he finally stopped caring.  He remembers that was the day he finally grew up.  He remembers it was the day he realized he would die one day too.
So when Lestrade starts to notice signs in Sherlock that something is wrong, he tries his best to reason his fears away.  Sherlock has always been irritable, but lately, Lestrade is noticing even more irritation out of him.  He has horrible bags under his eyes, but maybe he’s just having more trouble than usual sleeping.  And yeah, Sherlock always speaks quickly.  But sometimes you can’t even understand what he’s saying at all.
” Sherlock remembers Moriarty cooing at him.  He remembers Moriarty narrowing his eyes at him.  He remembers thinking he should know what he means.
“You’re awfully quiet,” Irene says after she slicks off Sherlock’s cock with a loud pop.  He grunts his disapproval at the cessation and sudden draft, but he doesn’t open his eyes or even move his head towards her.  He sits there, hands now fisted into the crevices of the seats, trying to keep his head in the moment.  At this point, he’d be sorely irritable if he didn’t come one way or another, but he just can’t get his mind to stop wandering.
“No, I love your violin,” John states.  “It’d just be nice is all,” he finishes, shrugging his shoulders.
John lets Sherlock calm down a little bit and flashes him an apologetic look.  Sherlock looks especially perturbed and John can’t figure out why.
,” he finishes, implying something more as he flashes Frannie that conciliatory grin he flashes everyone.
the world.  John is good and safe and doesn’t call him freak or hate him because he sees what others don’t.  John accepts him and supports him and loves him.  John loves him.
A second later, John pokes his head around the corner, his hair dripping water and shampoo down his face.  He squints at Sherlock, looking him up and down.
Sherlock remembers acting cavalier in the cab and flipping the Royal Ashtray in his hands for John.  He likes that John wonders when he had the chance to lift it and how he could have ever done such a thing.  Sherlock wants to keep John aloof because he likes the way his smile looks when he is, so he doesn’t tell him that he lifted it when he was changing  into this suit.  Wasn’t that hard, really.
Sherlock goes to his mind palace where all his knowledge of chemistry is.  Chemicals and pheromones; dopamine and serotonin and testosterone and anything else he can think of to keep himself as rational as possible during this completely base act.
Sherlock finally gets off the coffee table when the doorbell rings.  Typical love affair case.  Man says he’ll pay anything to have his girlfriend followed.  Sherlock promptly kicks him out of the flat.  He doesn’t stop moping until Lestrade calls with a case at nine that night.
Sherlock's hands went into John's hair and he kissed him, tongue sliding against the roof of John's mouth, sucking on his lip as John felt his orgasm building.
"I know, John, and I was here with you, aware even during sleep, rather than drifting somewhere else."
"I don't need anyone - anyone else," John said awkwardly, tilting his head towards his friend. "This is enough for me."
He cleared his throat as it bumped against Sherlock's hand and Sherlock looked up at him with a grin. "Sorry," John said unapologetically.
John didn't want to be in the pub from the minute he sat down with his first pint. Mike was great, he had introduced John to Sherlock, they'd known each other for years, on and off - he was a good friend. But really, right at this moment, John just wanted to be anywhere that Sherlock was. The trouble was he felt that way more often than not these days, and it was disconcerting. Especially now, since he had admitted everything, well, almost everything, to Sherlock. He couldn't discuss his feelings with anyone else though, and he was running out of excuses as to why he wasn't chatting up women.
Greg frowned at him and turned to John. "Well, this is a turn up," he said and suddenly he was beaming, he just looked so joyful and in another second he had taken the couple of steps across to John and Sherlock and his arms went around them both in a firm hug, his face fitting neatly between each of them. "I don't know what to say," he said, stepping back and shaking his head a little, still smiling. "Did you know about this, Mrs Hudson?"
Sherlock's hips were moving, rocking against John, rubbing their cock's together and making John desperate to lose some clothes. In the back of his horny mind, though, he knew it was probably best to take this one step at a time. Despite the obvious arousal, this was all new, especially for Sherlock - kissing was one thing, anything more would be quite another.
In actuality, Sherlock’s really quite surprised to see John back in the room at all.  He figured John would have found a pretty woman to hole up with for the night and forget all about Sherlock and his juvenile confession earlier on.  If Sherlock is telling himself the truth, he almost hoped that would have been what happened and saved him the embarrassment of having to face John.  They could have been good little British boys and stiff upper lipped this and carried on like nothing happened.
Sherlock remembers when he took that skull.  It wasn’t long after he got the job at Bart’s five years ago as a clinical chemist, which was nice because they let him come in whenever he wanted and stay as long as he liked, just as long as he met deadlines.  He was also allowed use of lab supplies for experiments as long as they weren’t too extravagant or expensive.  Sherlock always thought this was strange since Bart’s is funded by the British government until he remembered that Mycroft is the British government.  Sherlock pretends he doesn’t know Mycroft has arranged for him to have access to lab supplies simply because it’s convenient for him and it keeps his boredom at bay.
Sherlock crunches his nose between his gloved fingers and laughs mirthlessly.  John stands rigid, not knowing what to expect.
Irene isn’t nice and she’s certainly not loving either.  She’s rough and noisy and jarring.  Sherlock’s only ever had two lovers in his life and she’s nothing like either of them.  He doesn’t quite know how to handle her.  Irene makes these guttural, base noises and Sherlock has to admit that it puts him off.  He supposes she does it to play up the whole “dominatrix” thing, but does she really have to right now?
John stands in front of the door, wide eyed and mouth closed tight in one thin line.  Sherlock is too anxious to care that he’s thoroughly pissed John off for the second time in less than 36 hours.
“You know, I think that was the worst day of my life,” John says solemnly after a lengthy pause.  “And I’ve been to war,” he adds dryly.
“We don’t have to do anything…” David breathed against Sherlock’s mouth after a while.  Somehow, he’d managed to unbutton Sherlock’s shirt and get his trousers halfway off.
Sherlock closes his eyes and remembers that Mycroft used to come into his room when he’d have bad dreams and trace the outlines of his face.  He remembers when he was little that he wanted to be a pirate because pirates are dangerous and funny and that meddling little Peter Pan will get what’s coming to him.  He wants to be like Captain Hook and go on adventures and have everyone answer to him.  But secretly, Captain Hook scares him and he thinks the crocodile is right in wanting to eat him.  Secretly, Sherlock wants to be with Peter and Wendy and Tiger Lily.  He wants to fit in, but he knows, even as a child, that he doesn’t.
John laughs again and rubs his eyes.  “Yeah, yeah I s’pose she has been a lot…” he says trailing off.  They don’t really talk for the rest of the night, just comments here and there about whatever programme is on.  Sherlock on the floor, John on the couch, John’s leg nearly touching Sherlock’s arm all night.  Sherlock hasn’t sat this close to another human being for this long in years.
He closes his eyes and keeps his hands firmly at his sides and goes into the door marked FANTASIES ABOUT JOHN in his mind palace.  Sherlock does everything he can to not look at Irene while she’s down there licking and sucking him.  For all the fantasizing he’s done about Irene too, he thought he’d be more excited when they actually did have sex.  Sure, the vibrations against his cock are making him see stars, but Christ, does she ever stop all that fucking moaning?
But then John walks into his mind palace and Sherlock starts to pump harder.  It’s all the little things he thinks about him that makes John John.  John reading the newspaper in his robe, John laughing at crap telly with him at ridiculously late hours, John stumbling over Sherlock’s kitchen experiments because he just can’t get used to the beakers and burners laying about, John fussing over Sherlock because he hasn’t eaten in 36 hours.   John’s hand brushing Sherlock’s during dinner.  The way John’s voice sounds all fuzzy when he’s just woken up.  The way John looks at him when he’s making deductions.
The last time he had to say this was to an old friend of Mummy’s called Frannie.  He’d gone round to visit not long after his birthday with Mycroft one Sunday.  His mother, never one to pass up bragging about either of her sons, boasted about her baby boy the chemist and how he’d just turned 28 and could you even believe it!  Mycroft had laughed into his teacup at Sherlock; he never missed an opportunity to try to embarrass him.
it’s been too long since someone’s done this to him.  Irene keeps working up and down and Sherlock vaguely feels her grab his hand and put it on the back of her head.  But he takes it off almost instantly.  In the back of his mind, he knows what he needs out of this and feeling long, smooth curls reminds him that he’s not getting what he
“I mean it, you tell me what the hell is going on here.”  John’s voice drops to a low whisper, that same tone he takes when he’s consciously trying not to yell.
Sherlock blinks at him defiantly, like a teenager who’s being confronted by their parent after they’ve done something terrible.
as he flips her over on all fours, and like a mirage, the image of Irene fades into John, her voice sinking lower as it becomes his until all of Irene’s “yes, do it, now’s” sound just like the way John would.
John remembers walking aimlessly around the streets of London.  Newly returned from war, a war he has yet to admit to himself he did not want to leave, with a dodgy leg and a dodgy arm, no money but his small army pension, no job, barely any family, and a therapist to help with the PTSD he thinks he has but doesn’t quite.  Ella tells him to think of the positives, to make a list of things he’s grateful for or that make him happy, but why would he do that when he could just complain and be surly?
He tries not to remember that he snatched it at random from Sherlock’s change bowl in his room when they desperately needed milk.  He tries not to remember he stole it only one day before the ambassador’s children were kidnapped. He tries not to remember that they were once held in Sherlock’s hands, that his fingerprints are still probably on them, that heat from Sherlock’s living body warmed those coins to the touch.
Today, John accidentally puts on too much aftershave and Sherlock can smell him before he’s even in the room.   Sherlock leers at him as he plops down in the armchair.  Almost like John knows what he’s thinking, he says, “Sorry, the aftershave spilled.”
John suddenly scrunches his eyes tight and moves his hands deliberately and Sherlock begs him silently
It’s been a long time since he’s thought about John.  He won’t let himself.  They work more cases and Sherlock gets to know John better and better.
“Oh.” He shuffled, “I’d forgotten I ever…” He glanced back up at Sherlock to see him smiling slightly. His neck warmed but he couldn’t help but slowly offer once of his own, “took that..”
He felt his face slip, lips part in surprise, heart speed up in a way that made his chest physically ache.
“Oh.” John kept his eyes ahead, “Well, I haven’t heard it in a while.” He glanced at Sherlock, “Might’ve missed it.”
Sherlock was barely aware of his mouth moving, his own voice sounded too loud given how close they were, despite the fact that both of their voices had lowered to just above a whisper, “It’s physically impossible to
Sherlock froze, realizing what he had just done. John was leaning forward in his chair, head in his hands. Sherlock shuffled on his feet, startled by the sudden change in behavior and guilt rushing through him.
“God…” He turned, not blinking, not willing to take the risk, and stood right in front of the window, nose practically against the glass, “God, no.” He pressed his palm to the cool pane and saw a shadowed hand leave a pocket in response, not lifting, just there. John’s heart lurched, his leg no longer hurt, he pressed his other hand to the window, “Sherlock.” He said to himself, “Sherlock.” He said it again, but the figure, the world, didn’t respond, “Sherlock don’t… fuck, don’t move. Don’t move.”
He sat in his chair, feeling his posture becomes less and less stiff the more John talked and laughed at himself. When his own smile finally broke through, however, John’s laughter stopped abruptly and faded into another one of his soft smiles. Just for him, Sherlock liked to think.
He stared down at the desk top. Sherlock’s computer sat pushed into the corner by the wall, nearly covered by stray pieces of paper littered in familiar messy handwriting. The majority of the desk was taken up by open notebooks and case files, both of which were peppered with the same handwriting and various sticky notes. A dagger was stabbed into one in particular, all the way through to the desk. John hesitated, but then wrapped his hand around the wooden grip. Warm, he imagined, full of the energy of Sherlock’s mind, his frustration. John swore he could feel it buzzing up from the object and into his veins. And he felt closer somehow. Closer to Sherlock, closer to a breaking point. The lump in his throat got worse.
Sherlock had never seen John like this. He’d gotten home from the hospital and only mumbled something about a rough day when Sherlock asked. He’d said nothing more until gotten out a scotch and glass and sat down in his chair, only then preceding to demand Sherlock to play for him.
“I can’t leave until I know he is okay. Or… that he will be. Okay.” He was talking about John. He was talking about more than John.
“You don’t have to explain yourself, dear.” She picked her way around untouched piles of papers, case files, and mugs still half full with Sherlock’s long gone cold tea and took his hands between hers, “Loss is something I guess I can say I’m familiar with. And it does get easier I think… But only with time.” She gives his hands a small squeeze, “And you’ve barely had any of that at all.”
When they parted they were breathing hard and the sky was a brilliant orange and red. John didn’t say anything, just leaned his face into Sherlock’s neck where Sherlock could feel him breathing. It was the most comforting thing in the world and Sherlock let his eyes slipped closed, feeling like he’d been waiting for this for an eternity. And, for that moment, everything felt okay. Or like it would be.
“Leave it be.” He was stern, and John could picture his eyebrows pulled low, lips thin and pressed into a frown, “Alright? Let it alone.” Then lower, clearly not meant for John to hear, “He needs it more than we do.”
“Have you finished then?” Sherlock’s voice came out higher than he meant it. By the soft chuckle John gave, he guessed that it had shown on his face.
John’s lips were warm and soft, slightly tangy from the scotch. He pressed back against Sherlock’s with equal force and, for the moment, Sherlock’s brain didn’t seem to need any of the stimulants it usually went to. He wasn’t doing a million things, thinking a million things at once. All that seemed to be noise now, white noise that silenced itself so quickly at John’s touch it was almost eerie. But it was lovely. It was
“Jesus,” A chair scooted back over the line and John sighed as he sat now, “I’ve not a clue what to say. How’s the nose?”
“John..” Sherlock felt his own voice break. He couldn’t think straight, he was at a loss for words. All he could seem to see in his mind was
John cleared his throat, “Yes, I thought It’d be more…” he shook his head as they trotted down the steps side by side, “I don’t know what, I thought It’d be nice.”
John doesn’t answer for a moment, but crosses the room and closes the curtains again, flicking on Sherlock’s desk light instead, “I know. I’m sorry, I didn’t know myself until- don’t!”
It was approaching four in the morning when Sherlock resigned to his bed. He couldn’t stare at the empty chair across from him any longer. If he did he was worried he may throw something, or miss the mantlepiece and stab himself instead with the amount he’d been at it. He let his phone rest on his chest, fingertips to his chin.
John’s thumbs halted on his skin, his eyes were honest and soft and Sherlock doesn’t remember anyone looking at him like that before.
Sherlock wraps himself tighter in the blanket. The fleece is too soft, too pliable against his skin, not at all what he’s use to. He curls himself tighter in one of Mycroft’s chairs. It’s too small, too cramped, not at all what he’s use to.
Sherlock held his breath, eyes locked on their hands. His breathing was uneven, adrenaline and blood mixing in his veins. He swallowed hard, nodded, “Yes..”
ever feel… whatever Sherlock had felt. Whatever Sherlock feels. That it was John and him, him and John. He never dreamt that there could be any other version of either of their lives, he never thought…
John’s cup was nearly squashed in his hands from his grip and was in great danger of spilling over. His breathing was labored, his head bowed, “Yes.” He let out a shaky breath, “Yes, well I’m the one who made the mistake of getting use to it.”
John had turned his eyes to the city line, nodding towards it as he blew on his paper cup, “We’re gonna see a nice sunrise.”
John stared at it, turned it over, stared at it some more. He looked around for other possibly related notes, but this one had been on its own, stuck to the desk. He sighed, leaning back into the chair and staring at the ceiling with a huff.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth a few times, before forcing his eyes away from John’s face so that his other senses could actually perform their jobs. He swiped John’s coat from where it lay on the back of the client’s chair, taking a quick sniff.
John suddenly let out a little laugh, his hand coming up to cover Sherlock’s on the armrest, “Sherlock, I know you. You always say what you mean. You were just doing it. Yes, I had a patient. She’s a little girl and she’s sick. That’s what happened. You figured it out and so you said it. So sure of yourself, and then… this. Me…” John’s thumb stroked over his knuckles softly, gently there but not trying to overpower Sherlock or distract, “All of that goes away, doesn’t it?”
Sherlock was very good at sitting still usually. He could go days on end without speaking, without moving. But he couldn’t seem to manage it tonight.
He heard a soft throat clearing and then a shadow over him, blocking out the streetlight, making the flashing police sirens appear brighter, angrier.
The sun was peaking over the buildings, and Speedy was making its daily bread by the time he moved, barely making it up the stairs. He didn’t even register that it was Sherlock’s chair he was falling into until he woke with a blanket over him a few hours later and a not quite cool cup of tea, courtesy of Mrs. Hudson no doubt. He refused any and all questions from her.
The air is filled with just their breathing for a moment, both labored, both filled with the sting of unshed tears. This is not what friends are suppose to do to one another.
Sherlock tried to lie to himself again and ignore the fact that, the real overpowering emotional effect of John’s laughter was complete and utter endearment.
. Sher…” He spun around and around on the spot, desperately trying to catch any motion, any shadow, “God, no…”
Mycroft inhales a slow breath through his nose, looking at Sherlock carefully with the only look he knew Sherlock couldn’t read. Sherlock was about to comment on it, to push him farther away. He wanted to tell him that
They made it into Sherlock's room and John left him on the bed while he went to take a much needed shower.
"Yes, how about you? Problem?" Sherlock asked, miming a phone with his thumb and little finger that despite himself John found funny.
He felt the sweat beading on his forehead and Sherlock was looking up at him, eyes glazed over as he breathed heavily and clutched to John's biceps.
He woke again with a large, warm body pressed against him when he tried to roll over. He rubbed his eyes and found Sherlock snuggled up beside him, barely staying in place on the narrow sofa.
John was mid-sip of his tea and he took a long gulp before putting his cup down and pushing his chair back a little from the breakfast table. "Are you talking to me?" he finally asked.
Ok, so he was keeping the cases to himself these days? John had been spending more time at the surgery, but maybe, if it was working out for them both, maybe Sherlock needed to do this on his own for a while?
"Yes, perfect," John admitted. Sherlock looked away and John stared at him for a moment and the thought crossed his mind that maybe the shoes were from him. What he couldn't work out was why.
Sherlock smiled back. "No one has ever given me an erection before," Sherlock told him matter-of-factly.
Sherlock was smiling. "Well, quite frankly, if it leads to more of that, then I'll wear whatever you want me to wear."
John tried to block him out so he could concentrate, but Sherlock and more specifically what they had talked about, the whole thing was on his mind constantly. Having Sherlock here was almost helpful, in a way, because John could pretend he was simply irritated by him, rather than wishing they were back at home, together, alone. He had a long drink of water, told himself to stop it, get on with his work.
He was still sitting there, head resting on his drawn up knees, when the front door opened. John's head shot up and there was Sherlock - collar raised, of course; scarf perfectly placed, perfectly knotted. One hand went up through his curls – magnificent – John knew it all. He saw each tiny detail of Sherlock's face in his best and worst dreams. His infatuation with this man was so extensive that he couldn't bear to think of the days before they met. Admitting that his obsession was more than an admiration for Sherlock's work, for his mind... could he do it?
"You're shivering," Sherlock told him, patting the bench beside him. He appeared to have squeezed right back against the wall. It would be tight but John could probably fit on there beside him.
"Please, will you stop trying to make a joke of this? I wanted to cook for you, there is no ulterior motive."
John looked them both up and down and smiled. "Nope," he admitted. They had always been clothed to some extent so far in bed together. There really didn't seem any point now.
"Ah, right. Yes. Good." A bad day had just got a whole lot worse with those few words. John pulled himself together. Sherlock had every right to deny anything between them, especially to someone he had only just met. They weren't a couple. They had never been a couple. And John had to keep reminding himself of that so that he didn't hurt himself any further.
Sherlock sat down next to him. "John, if there's anything you need to talk about, I'm sure Mrs Hudson is still awake."
"All right, I'll leave you to it - but you have to promise me to come down to the station and tell me all about this. Both of you," he said, pointing a finger at each of them in turn.
John shoved Sherlock a little and he rolled onto the floor, John following with an ungainly flop onto his knees off the sofa, before they both scrambled to their feet.
And suddenly it was clear. Sherlock was smiling now. "I'm sorry," he said, completely unapologetically.
Of course, Sherlock was waiting for him outside when John emerged. He gave a long sigh but he was pleased to have his company on the way home.
"John, you underestimate yourself at every turn," Sherlock replied, a slight tremble to his voice that John loved.
John's laughter had picked up to match Sherlock's and their bodies were both shaking with it. "I can't tell you, I'd have to kill you," he said, producing more giggling.
Sherlock was quieter when he spoke again. "John, I feel that I've come to be more aware of certain things, recently. Of your feelings, certainly, of my own feelings-"
He sat down heavily at the bar and tried to avoid downing his fresh drink. He wasn't alone for long.
"Pass me your plate, please," Sherlock said, and John handed it over. The plates were new. They had butterflies on them. The serving dish was new, or maybe borrowed from Mrs Hudson. And the way Sherlock was serving two portions of home-made lasagne - that was certainly new. John couldn't get over it, but he stayed calm. Dinner. It's just another dinner. And yet, somehow, this was so much more romantic than their dinners at recent restaurants had been. Maybe because they were currently sober and looking at each other over a flickering flame, and Sherlock was lifting a glass of white wine to toast. John quickly put down his fork and picked up his own glass, clearing his throat as he waited for Sherlock to speak.
Sherlock sighed a little and seemed to relax further under John's weight, still holding him close. He joined the kiss, searching out John's lips and John struggled to stay still on top of him. He would need to move, any minute now or this would become awkward. He just couldn't stop kissing those lips.
Sherlock was just looking at him when he caught his eye. "Shall we go in?" he said, and he stood up while John drained the last of his wine.
John's stomach twisted and an almost sharp pain shot up through his chest. "Sherlock," he said on a breath. "Why didn't you say anything?"
Sherlock just smiled. Content, it would seem, with John's stilted explanation. He reached out with his towel and draped it over the rail, turned to John, fully naked and damp from the shower, a few droplets on his clavicle that John wanted to lick. He took a step and put a hand on John's shoulder, edging closer until he kissed John's cheek. So chaste and yet so much more sensual than John had experienced before.
As he watched the shop assistant wrap it, John began to feel a cold sweat creep up his back. He saw himself giving the present to Sherlock, saw his friend's face as he opened it. What if Sherlock got freaked out? They didn't do gifts, they just weren't those sort of friends. Sherlock wouldn't even tell John when his birthday was, and the only card John ever got was from his sister.
Sherlock nodded but didn't immediately move. "Next time you invite me out for dinner, John, I'll know what to expect."
There was gentle caressing of lips, a gradual teasing slide of tongues. John had never kissed anyone the way he kissed this man - slow, almost tentative brushes of lips, wanting desperately to know what would turn Sherlock on. The look in his eyes seemed to John to be adoration. He wanted to rush, to see what other looks might cross Sherlock's face - but they had to go slow.
"Why does anyone? It's called 'love' Sherlock, and love doesn't allow us to choose the recipient. It just...
What wasn't delicious was the worry that this was it, that Sherlock was never going to get beyond this friendship stage and John was destined to be pining forever. He swallowed down some wine and tried to focus on what they had. Their friendship was perfect, if he really thought about it. They argued, they laughed, they had dinner, they had adventure - what more could John really ask for?
He put his fist to his sternum and tried to breathe through it without drawing attention to the fact that he was struggling.
John sighed and Mary gave him an encouraging look. "At least he hasn't brought a client with him this time," she said.
John tried again. "You did a gr-" he sighed, "a brilliant job here, it was a really nice idea, to finish the case like this. Especially," he added slowly, "since the
"Well, maybe if you kept to our arrangements more often you'd be home in time to make dinner," Sherlock mumbled towards the table.
And yet, as he looked back up into his friend's face, he knew - this man was the one. John had never felt anything to rival this deep-rooted love for another person. But then, who said fairytales needed a happy ending? Maybe the best bit was the life, the living for the moment? Maybe John could do without anything more, and the physical side..? Well, he had his hand.
He wanted to say more, give more reassurance but his voice was wavering, and what they didn't need was for John to have some sort of breakdown at this point. So he held himself together, held tight to Sherlock, feeling his body calm beside him. He murmured more whispered words when they came to him, hating that Sherlock was panicking about this. They were close to something and John wanted whatever they had here to be perfect, definitely not uncomfortable.
Sherlock looked unconvinced, which of course, he would be, he was a bloody genius. John gulped down another mouthful of beer. Strong, it was going down well.
"Do you think," Sherlock started, quietly, as John looked at him cautiously. "Would you like to do this more often? Could you see yourself spending more time like this?"
He drew both hands through his hair, grabbed his dressing gown and tiptoed downstairs to shower yesterday away.
Sherlock took a step back and actually looked lost for words as well, truly taken aback by John's ridiculous outburst. "We are," he finally said, quietly. "I'm sorry John, I knew I could do this one alone, I didn't want to disturb your work." He was frowning. "John," he said again, and John frowned to match his but he didn't interrupt. "Are you all right?"
John scrunched his face up, willing this to be ok, and pushed straight on with, "I want to fuck you."
"You didn't ask," Sherlock told him and surely that was a good point, logical, direct Sherlock maybe would have told him, had he been asked.
"Ok," he said, nodding a little and rubbing at his tired eyes – definitely only watering because it had been a long day, no other reason. "You're right. It's fine. This is fine."
"You're gonna regret sharing," John told him, holding fast to Sherlock's elbow, completely failing to keep them any steadier.
John heard Sherlock mumbling as he came through with his tea. "Mmmm?" he asked. "Establish what? New case, is it?"
Sherlock frowned, raised an eyebrow as he looked at where they were touching. When he met John's eyes again he was smiling. He nodded jerkily. "I don't mind," he murmured, and John's heart began to thump.
John looked back to his irate friend. "It's nearly ten-pm, it's Sunday, Sherlock. We can't buy a kettle tonight."
"What is it John? Is there something I'm forgetting? You really must remind me if I've done something, you know I don't actually want to embarrass you."
"Sherlock, I have patients to look after, I don't sit here making bloody puppet shows, and asking impossibly rude questions about other people's bathing habits."
John stood there blinking as Angelo tapped his nose and nodded conspiratorially. "I understand boys, you've got other plans, I can see that." He was possibly attempting to whisper but heads were turning from all sides as the three men stood there beside the little table.
Sherlock opened his eyes and John moved back an inch. "Why?" Sherlock asked. "Why would you single me out so definitively?"
"The perfect amount I'd say," Sherlock replied, voice deepened by said alcohol, John supposed, or maybe he was just tired, he clearly wasn't quite himself.
The trouble was, what would they find to talk about that wasn't related to a case, or to something even worse, like their living arrangements? He supposed it wouldn't be too bad since Mike would be there to stay John's nerves.
"I wonder if we can try to get back to where we were?" Sherlock asked. "Minus, the Rizla and whisky," he added.
"Uh... ok, do you need me to help with that?" John asked, smirking. "Because I just wanked you off, and I wasn't really expecting laughter." But Sherlock's giggles were making John start to laugh as well.
"I have thought about you in many different scenarios, but as I told you, I really don't know how those daydreams might pan out in real life. Your patience will be very much a necessity, John."
“You sho – oh, nothing,” John sighs.  There’s no use in lecturing him.  Sherlock will never listen anyway.  John puts his fork down and looks around the restaurant.
Sherlock knows he needs to stop.  He hasn’t slept in days, his nose bleeds constantly, his heart is starting to beat erratically, and he can’t keep food down.  But the withdrawal scares him more than anything and he knows he can’t do it alone, now that Samantha’s left him.  But alone is all he has.  Alone is what he is.
“Could have fooled me,” Sherlock cuts him off.  Anything to provoke Lestrade into leaving this alone.  But Lestrade knows now, knows that the way to get through to him isn’t by screaming at him.
John trails his hand down Sherlock’s chest and stomach to weasel down under his pajamas and wrap his fist around Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock groans obscenely into his mouth but doesn’t stop working John’s tongue with his.
Later that day, Sherlock meets Irene Adler face to face and finds he’s somewhat smitten with the woman.  She’s intelligent, charming, cunning, bold, beautiful.  Irene is a new puzzle for him to try to solve, a new adventure for him to go on.  Best of all, she was able to outsmart him and Sherlock finds he doesn’t really mind.
Immediately after Mycroft kicked him out of his room, Sherlock pulls Father’s dictionary out and looks up the word “sociopath.”  He reads:
“In the army.  It’s all chemicals and adrenaline and fear.  It’s all getting shot at constantly, trying to repair maimed soldiers, watching your friends die in front of you.  Killing people.  It makes you feel…”  John trails off.  He can’t quite find the words.
“We don’t care about anything?”  Sherlock asks, not understanding.  “But that’s not true.  I care about Mummy and Redbeard and you,” he remarks innocently.
“This is tedious,” Sherlock sneers and turns to move away from John again.  But before he can turn his back, John pushes him against a wall and holds him there by his shoulder.  For being smaller than Sherlock, he really is remarkably strong.
He hears Irene in John’s voice cry out her orgasm and he grabs onto her hips to help ease her through it.  She pushes herself up against his chest and twists her head to kiss him passionately  as she continues to ride his length up and down.  He caresses her tongue and tastes John on his own.  He buries his hands in Irene’s curls and feels John’s bristly hair in his grip.  He breaks the kiss so he can catch his breath and works on Irene’s neck, feeling John’s five o’clock shadow and tasting John’s sweat.  He keeps bucking wildly and his legs start to burn from the effort and all he keeps saying is “yes, John, god, yes.”
Sherlock’s stomach twists into a knot at the word, but all he does is straighten his head, close his eyes, and sighs loudly.
“But now she’s gone.  She’s gone, she left me…”  And Sherlock starts to cry.  It’s the first time he’s cried since he was a child.
Sherlock continues with the empty insults for a couple more minutes.  Lestrade remains silent throughout Sherlock’s tantrum, his face drenched, not in anger, but concern, and it only makes Sherlock more furious.
Sherlock doesn’t know when he falls asleep and he doesn’t wake up until he hears John running the shower.  He stays in his room until he’s certain John’s left for the surgery.  He just doesn’t think he can face him.
Sherlock remembers taking his findings to every homicide detective at Scotland Yard and everyone laughing him out of their offices.  Everyone except Detective Inspector Lestrade, the unit’s newest DI.  There had been something about Sherlock that Lestrade found genuine, and so he took the younger man at his word.  Lestrade reopened the investigation into the woman’s death and discovered Sherlock had been right about everything.
(I have to add- when John says Sherlock's the only family he needs... I nearly cried when Sherlock told Mycroft that John was family in S4, because I wrote this chapter at the end of last year :D)
John would try with everything he had to be more like this man. Try to be someone worthy of his friendship. This man, built of strength and determination and love.
John gave him a look which Sherlock had only seen in bed. And in the shower. Then he shook his head slowly and said, "Not here," and Sherlock got that feeling in his stomach that he'd only had in their bed. And in the shower.
"I can't believe she came here. You didn't give her anything, did you?" John asked, failing to reign in his temper even though Sherlock didn't deserve it.
John stared at him. It wasn't a case. It was another non-date? So well-organised this time that John hadn't even considered it was anything but work. But apparently Sherlock had gone for pre-arranged this time, not just a spontaneous restaurant, but an actual booking of tickets, inviting his friend beforehand, not-spontaneous, non-date. Oh. And John hadn't even realised.
His lips parted at the feel of Sherlock's tongue against them, and the tentative, soft, wet press against his own made John think about that hand in his pants again.
"Sherlock," he said, slightly slurred. What was in those cocktails? And why the hell had they ended up drinking cocktails anyway? "I am going to kill you."
He made up time with an extra train instead of walking the final distance and eventually strolled into the theatre foyer at 18.55. He spotted Sherlock immediately, his back to the door. John walked up alongside him. "Evening," he said.
John rolled the dice. "Dammit, why is it always jail?" he huffed, and moved his silver boot over to the appropriate square for the fourth time.
of this. His friend was at a loss because he didn't usually put himself in these situations - John's revelations had drawn Sherlock out, but now John had made him uncomfortable. "I'm sorry," he finally said, his hand slowly slipping from Sherlock's wrist. "If you want to go, I'm about ready to get back anyway."
He sighed, looked up to the ceiling and began again, far more trepidation than when he had started - because he wanted that look, but he didn't deserve that look. He didn't deserve this man or his friendship and he needed him. He couldn't get through another day without him.
