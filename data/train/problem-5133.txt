Nope.
“Don’t you dare stain those pyjamas!” Dean calls hoarsely as they head back to the kitchen.
He flips it around, staring just under the title. His breath catches as he reads the author’s name.
Nodding excitedly, Dean shovels some pie into his own mouth before replying: “That’s the crust. It’s honey glazed. Thought you might like it.”
“If we fix it, then you tell me what would make you truly happy.”
“What else could it be?”
Castiel remembers suddenly what had sparked his outburst back in the bathroom. He wonders if Dean had noticed. He never gave any indication of doing so. Dean hadn’t looked at him any different or treated him with disgust. Maybe if he looked again they wouldn’t be so bad.  Either way, he couldn’t face anyone again, not until he knew. Had they been there all along? Why hadn’t Dean said something when they were out in public… the stores, the diner… the witness’ house! He’d been parading around the city like this and no one had made a comment.
And if you don’t? But he can’t bring himself to say it out loud. He doesn’t want to break his brother’s spirit any more than he already has. So he just nods and tries to make himself believe his next words: “I know you will.”
He doesn’t know much about Cass’ time with the reaper, but he certainly hopes that he at least got to an orgasm. But then, shouldn’t he know what to do with his dick if he had?
Dean tenses. This is getting dangerously close to the truth. Does Sam know what they’ve been doing? The whole Baby is a bubble thing? He’s positive that Cass hadn’t let it out, so how?
“Dead.” Which is what he wants to be.
“Dean.” He pauses, his hand on the edge of the box. “There’s something you can do… to save me.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter. It seems that Dean knows now so things are about to explode (namely Sam)
Not that he would get to write it. His own story is nearing the final lines.
Castiel knew, but he had feared so much worse. That Dean had sold his soul or something equally horrendous. This… is still bad, but nowhere near as catastrophic as it could have been.
“Tell me. I need to know what this is worth it for you.”
“Me too.” he murmurs, pressing his face into Dean’s neck.
“Where is Dean?” Cass wonders.
Sam nods. “I understand. Just, maybe try to think about how you felt in that moment. What you might have wanted most.”
Cass frowns at his tone. “It’s… pie. For you.”
suspicious, not more.
Sam chuckles. “Dean.”
“Not now Sammy.” He says seriously.
His heart thunders in his chest. “I just called to say… I love you.”
Swiping away the condensation on the mirror Castiel takes stock of his ‘new’ human appearance. Something catches his eye though. He screams in horror.
“Of course you want that.” He laughs.
The first guy screws up his face. “Gross.”
Sam inspects it, amused, “You guys are sharing porn now?”
“Yeah.” Sam stops walking to face his brother. “How does that work again?”
“Dean makes me happy.” He states simply, not noticing that his left hand is fizzling in and out of existence. “You know this.”
“I’m sorry.” He blurts, looking over to Dee. “I just – I never meant to deceive you, Dee – it – you were only attracted to
“Had some fun, did you?”
“Castiel summoned me for a reason.”
Castiel turns away. He can’t stand to hover in this room any longer. Not when all it does is remind him of Dean… of something he could have had… had he not ruined everything.
Dean tries to say something to cover his bare ass, but the words escape him. It’s a dark day when Cass talks to him like that. With venom in his voice and a sour expression.
“Hey!” Mary exclaims, pointing, “That’s ‘Supernatural.’”
“What?” Dean wonders, leaning in. What could he possibly be wondering now?
Chills run down Castiel’s spine as he sees Dean’s eyes widen. The hunter freezes completely. He can’t bear to see Dean’s expression, not now. With his emotions already at their limit, any disgust or rage or rejection will shatter him completely. Chuck scoffs as Castiel feels the world tilt.
The bunker is every bachelor’s paradise. Private rooms. Showers.
“What now Cass?” he asks as he plops down on his bed. Ah! Memory foam… daddy’s missed you.
“But…” Jack seems almost distraught. “True love is supposed to fix everything. What about the fairy tales?” he demands. “What about Snow White and – and Rapunzel?”
Sam prays for Cass to just say yes. And his prayers come true.
Thank you to
Cass just cocks his head, which presses Dean’s dick against the side of his mouth.
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean breathes, seeming emboldened by his support.
That stills her. She listens closely, hoping to hear something above the water. Except, Mary doesn’t even hear the water. It’s deathly silent in the shower.
A shocked silence follows where Dean can scarcely breathe. “You really did this.” Dean whispers at last.
Should he... say something?
“No.” Dean’s voice is quiet, haunted and Sam hates himself for taking this tack. But it’s for the best. He repeats it to himself like a mantra.
Sam is mellower now. Dean’s half convinced that he’s smoking the stuff. And Cass… well, Cass is nowhere in sight, which is a blessing that is not disguised in anyway.
“I’m glad you had a good time Dean but as you know, I need to leave.”
“I would have been great if you gave me a few more seconds.”
“Why haven’t you used it?” Sam snaps. “Or if – for some miraculous reason – you couldn’t smash it. Give it to me. I’ll do it.”
Even Dee jumps in surprise. His contentment falling away to reveal fear as Sam raises his hand.
has a tattoo on his left hand. Right – here!” Sam slashes at him, the knife whizzing past his skin, drawing blood.
“What’d you get?” Dean asks, curious.
isn’t possible anymore.”
to hit him that hard.
“You had something with my name on it.” his voice is accusatory.
“I thought that coat kept you toasty warm.” Dean spots the gas meter. “You’re running her pretty low there buddy.”
That easy, huh?
Dean laughs and Castiel feels some of the worry dissipate. Surely if something had gone wrong… if Sam had been injured, Dean would get to the crux of the matter right away. The signal distorts and Castiel presses his ear further into the speaker, “Dean? What’s that sound?”
“Fine.” He spits, still frazzled.
“Cass.” Dean says, stepping towards him carefully.
His tongue is still unresponsive, he can hardly manage a croak of surprise.
“Dean!” he shouts in relief, darting forward to embrace his brother.
Rapidly approaching.
But he can deal with that later.
Dean pulls back, knocking into the sink. “Save it.” he says. “You’ll be drained if you fix me.”
“Cass!” the younger Winchester’s shrill, panicked voice jars him into action, “Dean’s gone! Dean’s gone! And – I think he’s going to –” Realisation widens his eyes and he switches the call wordlessly. “Where are you?”
They could make a deal. Bring Dean back. Sam would still care right?
“What about the case?” It had been a simple salt and burn. Simple and exhausting anyway.
Dean seems torn, his mouth opening and closing. “How did Dean bring you back from the edge.”
“Hey Cass.”
This is it.
Like he should even talk. His last experience with sex was in a box, upside down with a male angel. Or a celestial being of intentness in a male body.
“Here.” This time Cass’ voice is almost timid.
The concrete floor beneath him disappears, everything disappears and then he’s face down in the mud, something latching on tightly to his ankle.
Nothing.
“Then it began over-heating.” Cass nods. “And in the interim it tried different variations to try to fulfil your wish. It realised it couldn’t make you happy, so it just sort of tried to kill itself to still somehow save you.”
And in an instant….
“There’s no need for violence Castiel.” Aziraphale says, raising his hands in surrender. “Crowley probably just took him out to see his car. It’s a Bently, I can’t quite remember the year, but he adores that car.”
“Ask me.” the angel drones, in a way that scares the brothers.
Dean would want to play in the play ground. Of course.
Oh that little…
He cannot even fathom how Dean is managing this whole… paradigm shift.
He will be here.
He knows that the expression on Dean’s face is entirely because of him. He pushed Dean too far yesterday and now it’s put a rift in their friendship. Castiel pats the pocket of his coat, reassuringly. Maybe he can make Dean a gift… remind his friend that he really does care about him. A man with a plan is what he is.
“But how does it come out?”
“I’m not fun.” He pouts. “I’ve never been fun.”
“Cass…” Sam trails off. “You said you didn’t want to see him.”
He feels the need to point of his wide and varied failings.
“Dean!” he exclaims, bucking his hips and twisting as thick splashes of come are ejected from his cock.  Dean keeps his hand moving slowly, guiding him through the after shocks. Panting slightly, Dean slowly removes his hand and stares at it as it glistens.
Cass’ eyes crinkle as Dean recites the line. “That means everything to me Dean. But…”
Dean shakes his head. This is stupid. He’ll just go with the demon and he misbehaves Dean will make some holy water is dis-corporate the hell out of him.
“Not with other people.” He retorts. “Your genitalia is quite beautiful.”
Dean laughs, seemingly satisfied by his response. “Sure Cass, but it isn’t exactly rocket science. Just pour it in and turn the water on.”
“Let’s get this over with.” He tells them.
“It’s Doctor to you Mr Winchester.”
“Well… here we have it.” he gestures at the pair. “Maybe this universe is different. Maybe everyone is amicable here?” he offers.
“Why did you do that?” he asks, “You’re making Cass uncomfortable. I told you Dean is straight.”
“Of course. Which is why he screamed bloody murder as soon as you left him alone with me.”
He wishes for his wings to fly to every corner of the earth in that instant. To find Dean and rip him from the ocean before – no. He can’t think of that. No.
. And that’s the problem.
“So Cass?” he says. “What was your wish?”
Dean sees Sam reveal the ticket. He can spot the writing on the flip side.
And like that his anger is swept away, not gone but pushed aside for now, because Dean is hyperventilating, gripping Castiel’s shirt and uttering a string of unintelligible pleas that just about break his heart.
Dean curses himself. Cass had opened up to him, shared his insecurities. Dean should have no problem doing the same. In fact he trusts Cass more than anyone. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t want to seem weak in his eyes.
Dean doesn’t awake to sunshine or Cass’ gently breath across his neck… those things come after.
“I’m talking about a different type of intimacy.”
He wants to argue that he
The lack of, well anything, seems to Sam in a foul mood. He snarls viciously at the creature and takes a threatening step forward.
He pauses. “Do you think there will be a kissing booth?”
Sam frowns, “There’s beer in the fridge.”
“I already knew,” Dean says in a rush, still looking down at his lap.
Mary assesses Sam patiently, Sam had never been so snippy with anyone. With Dean it was easy to see it for what it is: playful banter between brothers, but this is something else entirely. As they make their way from the convention, Mary swears that she hears Becky say, “Dear God, Dean and Cass kissing the file room. It’s perfect for a fanfiction!”
GOOOOOD MORNING, VIETNAM!!
Castiel threads a hand through his hair. “You look so delicious on top of me.” Dean’s cock twitches inside him at that. “I want you to move.” Castiel commands.
What he doesn’t understand is why Cass hasn’t told him about the pearl. He should want to return to normal more than anything. Sure, him and Dean hang out a lot more now, but that’s hardly comparable to being human sized and being able to fend for yourself. Cass should be just as eager as the rest of them to get back to normal.
Hmm. Mary had read many,
He lets out a harsh breath then letting his hands trail down Dean’s torso. “You’re sure?”
Cass drags his hands across his chest, letting his fingers scape across Dean’s nipples. He gasps, his back arching into the touch. One hand grabs Cass’ wrist; not stopping him, but just guiding him back to where they were.
It wouldn’t matter what the Shadow said, Dean would know in his heart.
“I will hunt you down.” He snarls.
Sam knows she hasn’t dropped it. “You don’t have a mother’s eyes Sam.”
“He doesn’t seem to like me.” he says instead.
Crowley loses the glint in his eye. “Maybe you do understand, Moose.”
He shakes his head. “It isn’t.”
For some reason Dean feels like he’s making a double entendre.
He shakes his head, no… not yet. “I have you.”
Thankfully, Crowley saves him from answering: “I’m here for tea and cakes. Dean and I are besties, am I right?”
Dean glances up at Sam. “Sammy, we need to talk. Alone.”
“Okay. We’ll do dinner.”
Had their night really been the equivalent of a ‘fling’ in Dean’s eyes?
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. He was so prepared for Dean’s rage that he hadn’t anticipated it would be directed at someone else.
Turning slightly, Dean sees that they are, in fact, closed. Cass’ eyelids aren’t the only thing he sees. Standing tall and almost completely flushed is Cass’ dick. He winces, knowing from experience how uncomfortable it can be. He clicks his tongue. It looks a bit chafed too. Dean reaches forward, dipping one hand into his bottom drawer.
“If you enter…” the angel smirks. “Then you can never leave.”
And he does.
“Not yet.” He says, deepening his voice slightly, as humans do when they want to intimidate someone. “But this could be a cross-state murderer. Time is of the essence.”
After about half an hour of steadily panicking he decides to sit for a moment. Dipping his hands into his pocket he pulls out the crumpled ticket from the Ferris wheel.
be Cass’ doing. Sam fondly remembers the salty pie that Dean devoured. He still doesn’t get how his brother made it through the first bite – Sam hadn’t, and his love of pie isn’t nearly as profound as Dean’s.
“I know.” Dean looks away.
A dozen things all connect in Dean’s head. “You have a crush on Sam?” His voice is shrill. He doesn’t know how he’s supposed to feel about this. His brother and his best friend…
someone we know.”
Sure, Dean had spared him a measly minute to tell him that angels don’t sleep. So Cass has no use for the bed.
“I remember Crowley.” Dean says, “And I gotta admit, minus the part where you manipulated me into getting the Mark of Cain and then bailed on us, things were good. You weren’t a control freak like Sam… except near the end - ” ‘you don’t leave like Cass does.’
After a sceptical look, Cass hops out of the car and glances around.
“Cass. I know this is a shock for you. But you can’t live worrying about dying. Besides, Sammy’ll get your grace back in no time.”
“Dean.” He says again.
“Well, it does have your name on it.” he teases.
Despite knowing how wrong it is to abuse their deal like he had - Dean can and probably will hate himself for it later – he can’t bring himself to forgo the feeling of being unbearably, tantalizingly… close.
“You know?” Dean barks. Why hadn’t he put up a salt circle or – or
He pulls the door in, and, sure enough, it really is Cass.
Since that day it’s been a constant barrage of
Cass nods like a nice, civilised little child before bouncing onto Dean’s bed and stuffing his face into the pillows.
But he loves Dean with all his heart. He loves him selflessly, so he can’t sentence him to a life of misery. He can give him one last moment of peace before he’s gone. Let him know that Sam will be okay.
“You telling me that I’m the thing that always goes wrong seems like something we should lead with.” He wants to add some bite to it. To mirror how hurt and betrayed he’d felt. But it’s hard to when Dean is actually trying to be considerate. He’s talking about their problem rather than pushing it aside to facilitate the monster of the week.
“I’ll be fine buddy. You and Sam hang out.”
Dean pounds on the door until they hear footsteps approaching.
“Luci.” Gabriel murmurs, still dazed from his release.
Dean straightens up, his muscles stiffening under Sam’s palm. When he looks him in the eye, his expression is dead serious. “What if I am?”
What he sees on Dean’s face right now, the love, the nervousness, the want… makes him hate himself even more. Without the printed work, Dean would never look at him like this or even do these things for him. He has to face the facts: he somehow
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve seen it done throughout the millennia.” Says Cass, nuzzling into Dean once more, “I assure you, I know how to make it feel good.”
And once more, Dean is unable to do more than sit there mutely.
“Cass, what’s the matter?” Dean is still half-way lost in lust but Castiel immediately feels him tense, staring worriedly up at him.
One more chapter!!!
He looks over to Sam and Dean, hoping to get some clarification. All he sees is panic on their faces.
Damnit. He should have left the angel cuffs on.
It’s an impossible situation. A hard choice.
“What did you want to talk about?”
Castiel frowns. Had Dean gone insane from the stress? He hopes that he still has enough grace to save him.
Only two types of people wear sunglasses inside: blind people… and douchebags and… as it turns out, yellow eyed demons.
“Yes Dean.”
The taste isn’t too bad. Kind of tangy.
“What you would think of me.”
“This bottle contains fairly little impurities.” He announces, “And the scent is appealing, even to me.”
Dean gives an uneasy smile, resisting the urge to press a hand to his cheek like a blushing school girl. “Let’s go. Before those kids devour all the cotton candy.”
“You two are chatting it up next to a dead body.” He holds up another finger, “You’re wearing – you look like a high schooler on his way to junior prom. It’s inappropriate and why are you even wearing that anyway? It’s not even your style! That’s a gold shirt you’re wearing Dean… and that Jacket… it has sequins and glitter on it dammit!” he shushes Dean once more, holding up a third finger. “You smell like a flower shop. It’s disturbing. I don’t even know how or why you did that. Why did you do that Dean? What did you do? Head out early and roll around in some daisies?”
for beta reading this chapter and helping me bring out all the feels!
It’s two questions and he knows it, but Dean doesn’t make a fuss, in fact, he looks ready to defend himself.
Dean waves his hand off, “I’m good… I was just wondering. Do you like your nickname?”
Dean’s tongue darts out, which immediately gets his attention. Uh oh, this can’t be good.
With a smile, he releases Cass. The angel stares at Dean with a potent mixture of heartbreak and hope. Dean’s attention remains on Cass until he sees Sam looking, then, he swiftly looks away, taking stock of the toys scattered aross the floor.
Dean knows how he really feels but he wants Sam to convince him otherwise. For a second he almost wishes he could. That he could convince Dean that he’s not in love with Cass, that everything will be okay and that his feelings aren’t enough to trigger the deal.
The secret is part of it – a small part. Sam can’t speak for Dean, but he knows that Dean’s worried about what might have happened if Cass had somehow felt happy. He’d just be gone. Without warning. Never to be seen again.
“You’re too in your head.” He reminds. He pauses with his hand hoving over Cass dick. “This is the last time.”
Dean runs his hands over a different section, enjoying the way Cass tightens his face a small moan slipping out. “I’m good at sex, Cass. Let me make you feel good.”
“I mean… yeah?” It comes out as a question. “There’s no point if I know that there’s no chance.”
Gabriel stand there, his face set in stone as a circle of  holy fire rages around him. Crowley is on his other side, trapped in a pentagram and pacing in angry circles. He stares down at the lines as though they physically affront him.
Castiel tries to hide his hurt at Dean’s adamant protests that they aren’t together; could never be a couple. It hurts him and Dean doesn’t even seem to realise. Just as he hadn’t realised what the Castiel who lost his Dean had been trying to say. Castiel could see the ‘I love you’ on the tip of his tongue. Only his petrified look had stopped his alternate self from ruining beyond repair the shambles of their paper thin bond.
Sam finds the source of the heat soon enough. It’s wrapped in a tan trench-coat, so hot that he’s began to sear the area around it. It’s too hot for his fingers to even get close enough to touch.
Silence falls but Michael can tell Adam is still thinking. His own mind is whirling a mile a minute. What would Adam think? What would he say if Michael told him about his feelings?
“Dean.” Cass says gently.
Silence…until a swish of fabric.
It’s like Dean isn’t even trying to deter mom.
Sam walks away then, his mind burdened with all the new information and it drives him to do something awful… something he promised himself he’d never do…
A chill goes through him. Cass … he couldn’t mean
"I like that you didn’t leave me."
“Are you okay?” Cass says gently, seeming to sense his internal break down.
If only his stupid, nostalgic heart would get the memo.
Those were terrifying.
“Of course I stayed with you.”
It was horrible, especially after all the promises he made. He lied to Cass, hurt him in every way he promised himself he wouldn’t. Never before had Cass looked at him like that, like his world was crumbling, like he was betrayed by the one person he loves. Dean shuts his eyes. All he can see is that horrified, broken expression. It drives him to his knees.
He turns onto his stomach, tucking his hands under the pillow and shuts his eyes. Even with his eyes closed, he can sense Cass’ presence next to him. He can feel the rage wafting over.
Cass beams at him before sliding up to join Dean on the bed. With a wink, Dean lets his hand trail down, cupping Cass through his pants. There's already a sizable wet spot. And even though he just had an orgasm, Dean feels his dick twitch as he takes note of just how much Cass enjoyed sucking him off.
He curses the twists and turns that force him to slow down, he hates that Cass is crying and that he doesn’t know how to help Dean.
He knows he only held back because of what he’d said earlier. To show Castiel that he was trying – that he could stop his anger. Possibly to let him know that things would be different this time around… if he stayed.
“I am ready.” He insists.
Cass isn’t fun sized anymore. He probably doesn’t remember a second of Dean’s attentive, gooey parenting. He’ll be back to hating him in ten seconds flat.
“No, I don’t, actually.” Cass returns. “You said you didn’t want him to know and I respected your wishes. You never gave a real reason why and I never asked because you’re the one doing me a huge ‘solid.’”
He’s about to say something… an apology or maybe an explanation, when Sam is thrown backwards, his body tumbling to the floor. Out cold.
Everything else was here; the one thing he wanted to see… isn’t.
“Relax.” He says comfortingly. “I’ll have Mom with me. We can handle him.”
“I think I did something terrible,” he whispers into the phone. “Jody, I have to go.”
Castiel winces.
Then, it hits him. The loss. The humiliation. What he just
Bending down, he inspects it. Hex bag.
He remembers in his bedroom.
The doors open and shut, “Crowley – is he - ?”
“Not even a little?” he whines.
The Winchesters can die and their chance of saving the world with them, but Michael can start over. He can save
“Dean…” Cass draws out the ‘n’ with a grin. Dean smiles.
“I didn’t think of this before.” Dean continues, “Because
The djinn peers at him, clearly intrigued. It’ s Cass’ confused head tilt and his soulful blue eyes all compounded on a female face. Dean finds it… disconcerting... and attractive, all at the same time.
Cass is silent. Watching Dean as he finishes off his slice of pie. They stare at each other a moment, Dean, almost too angry to even bother asking for Cass’ share. Sighing, Cass pushes the plate over and leaves his fingers on the edge, as though waiting to pull away at a moment’s notice.
“Since Chuck.” He supplies. “Since we saved the world.”
Dean wants to call bullshit. He wants to strangle this femme Castiel too but she’s smoke so that isn’t happening. Plus Dee is pretty protective of her which just freaks him out.
Cass’ tongue in his mouth manages to wrench a real moan from him. His eyes fly open in shock, almost shoving Cass aside as a reflex. The angel’s face is relaxed and Dean has to admit his kissing is definitely doing something for him.
Sam shrugs.
When Dean pulls into the Carnival parking lot he finds himself doubting the entire idea. There are tons of people here. It’s the middle of the week, so it isn’t as packed as it would be on a weekend, but somehow it’s still more crowded than he’d like.
The beautiful pie only looks half as appetising now.
But even though Cass isn’t there to torment him physically, he’s still there in his dreams. Dean had never been so turned off by a sex dream in his life. He woke up shaking and hard, but feeling dirty and used.
“Cass?”
“And that’s why you’re here, to screw with their relationship?”
“Wait.” The first guy says, moving onto all fours. “We’re both horny. Let’s do something about it.”
“Dean. You don’t understand. I can’t relax right now. Not in this condition!”
“Damn right you did,” Dean mutters, allowing him to enter. “Or else we’d have to braid your hair all night.”
Bobbing for apples had been a favourite. And he was pretty good at it too. It’s starting to get dark when Dean realises their entire purpose of coming here hadn’t even been fulfilled. They hadn’t bought anything substantial … that means no receipts.
This is a simulation.
He told Cass that he would show him how much he loves him.
What the hell? This must be the strangest angel to ever exist… including Cass. And that dude is pretty strange sometimes. The outfit looks ridiculous and the happy-go-lucky tone makes Dean think that he really might be that nice.
Thank you to my beta
Sam keeps a close eye on the live feed. All he sees right now is Dean and Cass building a race track. Well... Dean is building, and Cass just sits there staring at him as though entranced.
Dean’s resolve ended up lasting for a whole seven hours. He almost exploded at how fake he felt.
“Well…” Dean tries to articulate it; the undying need to just
Where the sound of the Shadow’s clap seems to echo back, with the sole intent of taunting him.
There’s a knock on the door.
Sam doesn’t buy twenty cameras. He can’t risk leaving the bunker for that long. And the set up time alone would render them moot.
“You don’t approve.” Observes Dean.
“I love you too.”
Dean’s eyes flutter open and Castiel is lost in a meadow of green. His fingers continue to move in circles inside Dean. Castiel enjoys watching the various expressions of pleasure dance across his friend’s face. His other hand grasps Dean’s erection, gripping it and pumping him in time with his fingers, taking care to tease the tip ever so often.
“Dean.” He moans in reply pulling back slightly. Their lips are still close together, their breath mingling and fogging up the glasses.
“I did not.” Dean splutters indignantly.
He sighs.
The angel seems amused by this. “You know I always come when you call, Dean.” He says simply. “That will never change.”
The elderly lady just shrugs helplessly and shakes her head.
“I’m not attacking you,” Sam points out.
“Honestly, you remind me of this porn video I once saw.”
Because Cass was right. He isn’t fueled by hate or anger when he pushes himself to his feet - he’s driven by love. Love for Cass, the angel who somehow became his whole world.
“That rat bastard.” He grumbles. “Well, pony up Cass. We’re sleepin together tonight.”
“He left.” Says the other Sam, throwing a forlorn glance at his brother. “Went back to Heaven before the gates closed.”
A large crash just to his left tells him that the box has arrived. In the clouds, he sees the plane make a U-turn, heading back to the main land. The ocean seems that much bigger, now that he’s here without a way back. It would take days and days of constant swimming to make landfall now and even then, he was likely to get turned around.
“We just need two.” Dean says.
He thrusts the red one at Dean, warning him not to drink from his blueberry flavoured one. While his back is turned, Dean leans in to have a drink and just as his mouth touches the straw: “Dean can I borrow some money?” Cass is already reaching into the glove compartment. With the book. Dean sees his life flashing before his eyes; it’s already half way open. He slams it shut, nearly taking a few of Cass’ fingers with it.
“Ditto. Fergus.”
“I wished us out!” he yells, hoping Cass can hear him past the rain.
Him and Cass are good. Cass wouldn’t sit here smiling with him if he wasn’t. But it isn’t enough.
No one really pays them any heed in the sea of ‘supernatural rip-offs’ as Dean calls them.
“The Mark won’t drive me crazy.” He says softly.
“Fix me up doc.” He says leaning into the touch.
“I liked you better as adults.” He grumbles.
And he had landed right at Dean’s feet.
“I connected them to me,” he says. “When I die. They die with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But he had his answer anyway, he realised, as Dean sat next to him with a nonchalance that he could not reciprocate and stares at him with an unflinching green gaze, asking: “Any news on angel radio?” No. Dean didn’t care. Castiel had become just another one night stand.
Turning to face him, Dean looks distressed and confused. Eyes filled with accusation, he stares at Castiel, just like he had when Dean trapped him in a ring of holy fire. His sin had been working with Crowley then too. But things were different then. They weren’t as close. Then Dean asks the dreaded question: “How do you know?”
Castiel and Dean remain in the room via a silent agreement. Neither of them wants to face the world, knowing that they have no choice but to tell the truth, even if it causes them agony.
Castiel looks up to find Dean sitting across from him, two slices of apple pie resting in the space between them.
He’d scared Cass off with all that talk of ‘commitment’ and ‘feelings.’ It doesn’t make sense. He stated the facts, suggested that Cass take ample time to think… where did it all fall apart?
“Yes, Michael.” Adam’s voice is small in his mind.
“Why would we need furniture?”
“What’s wrong Sam?” Cass says, still behaving shiftily.
“I – Dean – you
Dean looks chagrin, “Cass I’ve had just about every type of sex there is.”
“If he finds out the Shadow will take him for sure.” Dean continues in a panic. “And we have to stop looking into it or it’ll out me. Doesn’t matter if it’s true or not, if Cass believes it for even a second then – I – oh God.” He breaks off with a moan, shoving his face into his hands.
“Cass was worried.” At that, Dean glances down. “Hey buddy.”
“Dean.” He replies in kind.
have. The realization hits him hard.  Mary had been right about Dean’s emotions towards him all along. He doesn't know how he feels about it now, just that his mind has been plunged into chaos. Everything that brought them closer came from the books. This is just as much his fault as it is Dean’s. At least they’re opening up now. They can work through this together. Now that he knows, Castiel can assure him he appreciates the effort Dean put in to make him comfortable.  But first, Castiel needs to catch Dean up to speed.
.” Still feels weird saying that. “And you lived here?”
“It’s fine,” Sam assures, keeping his focus on Crowley.
Dean stares at him, then sighs, running a hand down his face. “You’re right. I’m sorry. You’re not ours to command. But you can tell us things. Now and in the future. I don’t know what I would have done if you were standing next to me one moment and you just disappeared, never to be seen and heard from again.”
“Oh.”
“Is that what you want?”
“I hope you take this for what it is and nothing more.” He grunts out.
He regrets the words as soon as they leave his mouth because of the expression that spreads across Cass’ face. It’s an idea. And Dean can already guess what it is.
Two more chapters till the end!!! It's taken a while but we're almost there. Hope you like what I have planned... :D
“I – can we go on a brate?”
Crowley just shrugs, returning to his blasé self.
“I must have. It’s the only option… right Sam?”
Lips press against his open mouth with Cass reaching inside to stroke his tongue. His mind shatters, splintering off into different directions. Cass is kissing him. Cass is staring at him with lust filled eyes. They’re just friends right?
“I didn’t deserve it.”
“On three.” He mouths.
Cass blinks in understanding. “You didn’t know what I would say… you think my powers being back… that it would change me.”
“Well you’re certainly in a good mood Squirrel.” Dean almost fumbles the glass.
Castiel is watching Dean sip on cranberry juice when a burst of power splits the air.
came to cart him off to ‘safety’. Heh. I always liked the old Death better. He was so much less dramatic, you know?”
Gabriel is suddenly beside Dean, laying a hand on his shoulder. “But I won’t be.”
He grins and sits back giggling, trying to point out the never to be seen phenomenon to Sam who remains – as he is in most things – completely and utterly oblivious.
“Ghosts always go dark side.” His Dean says, though his voice isn’t as harsh. “Are you sure that this is what’s best for Cass?”
He’ll have to call Sam. The younger Winchester should get here within a few hours. He’d retrieve his grace from their garden – it still thrives even after all these years. A pyre would need to be built for Dean. His ashes would remain here, scattered across the land, it’s what Dean would want.
But he can’t survive without Dean here. It’s almost an impulse – a natural reaction – to try to save him at this point.
Castiel smiles despite himself.
who is the smartest human Castiel knows.
Dean has to fight the flush that creeps up his cheeks. Damn sheets, he completely forgot about those.
“Well, to be fair, I did just want to check on why the bloody hell you haven’t continued with the case.” He shrugs, “Then I waited around hoping you might want to indulge in a threesome later.”
“So do I.” he finds himself admitting anyway.
Seemingly following the same line of thinking, Dean nods, deepening his voice, “Dean we talked about this. Personal space?”
Groaning, Dean presses his face into her shoulder.
Clenching his jaw, he looks away. Shit. If Michael really is dead, then this is their only chance to get back.
“It doesn’t feel right.”
Crowley chirps in this time, pausing at the edge of the circle to smirk. “Have you ever watched any Disney movie… like ever? The villain seems to succeed with his dastardly plan only to be done on my his incessant talking and low self-esteem which causes him to want to gloat. I thought better of you.”
“Night?” he parrots.
Dean hopes that Cass won’t need much convincing.
The angel jumps, glancing between the brothers uneasily.
“Dean doesn’t like me.” He frowns, “What I do wrong Tam. Dean said he’d stay. Not leave me.”
“Great.”
Why would Dean call them here? Today? To stand near a shallow grave?
“Yeah,” Sam says sarcastically. “A torrid history, I’m sure.”
Instantly he goes into panic mode. His mind immediately heads to Dean. He’d be pissed that Cass had… vanished? Died? He doesn’t even know. On Sam’s watch.
He almost hates how accommodating Dean is treating him. After all the trouble he went through to save his grace… and somehow Castiel had let Lucifer eat it. He expected some shouting, calling him stupid; not this nice façade.
“I like this you better too.”
Dean touches Cass’ shoulder as they stand in the dimly lit file room. “Look for the registration list. They did it manually so Sam can’t hack anything this time. Seriously! Screw this hotel!”
Castiel doubts that he’ll end up more than a bloody smear when his feel eventually touch the ground.
Mom still shakes her head, stubbornly and Sam feels like he’s talking to a brick wall, “You didn’t
Michael keeps his attention fully on evading the creature and leading it away from where it wants to be. Michael thought he was close to losing it days ago, but it had circled right back around and began screaming once more.
“Y-Yeah, it’s a strange thing to do.” He rolls his eyes. This angel will be the death of him. “But I wasn’t ‘looking.’ I just noticed it cause it just there – all of a sudden – you usually wear tht baggy trench-coat.”
That would still mean finding a way to go out without Sam thinking they’re up to something. After all the ‘jokes’ from the past few days, he’s probably already suspicious.
Cass nods, his shoulders falling. “I was taking a walk.”
Delicately, Dean traces the head of his cock with one finger, causing Castiel to fumble with the buttons.
“That is why I wish I never came back here.” He hisses. “What we have. Isn’t profound. It’s toxic.”
“Should we head back then?” Cass asks, still seeming daunted by heading back.
The box cracks open and light streams in. Dean doesn’t even look as he vaults Castiel out of the box, slamming the lid shut behind him.
That he would make this sexual creature writhe beneath him with just his clothed hips sent a surge through him. When Dean had told him to enjoy his ministrations he’d embraced it whole-heartedly, determined to make the most of the situation and engrave every second… every touch into his grace. That Dean even agreed to his spoke volumes, that Dean could even tolerate the visage of his broken wings was a miracle. Dean would never cease to overwhelm him.
The Shadow hadn’t even stuck around to help them, Castiel thinks bitterly. It just stole the love of his life and vanished.
He stares down at his hands, thinking. His hand drifts down slowly, into the pocket of his pants and he retrieves the little book flipping it open and turning the pages unseeingly.
The demon takes residence on Michael’s chair and straightens his shades.
Cue the confusion. “I don’t understand.”
Dean is still unconscious… covered in blood but Castiel can hear his heart pounding… see his soul still in his body.
In heaven Michael was the one who everyone came to for help. Michael was expected to do it all and hold the fort. Play the part until time for curtain close.
Dean kind of likes the blissed out, open expression on his friend’s face. He likes that he was the one who put it there.
Sam shudders at the woe in Dean’s voice. “It?”
Of course he has feelings. Maybe he’s not head over heels yet, but it’s undeniable that Dean feels
Well, Sam’s definitely going to have to avoid some of the details so that Dean doesn’t panic. “So after the F-I-G-H-T at the bunker with you and Dean, you left and he went out to search for you. He found you in a bush after you disappeared from right in front of me. We deduced that it was because of the pearl. We looked for the pearl but he kept it hidden in his room – and you also knew where it was but didn’t want to use it. Dean had seizure and inexplicable accidents. We had a scare where we thought the pearl was broken. But it just turned out to be my pen – maybe. We’re still sketchy on that. You and Dean were K-I-D-S and were little terrors to me then no one touched the pearl – I know that because I found it overheating in Dean’s room – and now Cass, you’re somehow invisible?” Sam exhales.
is the problem. It’s just sometimes he sees him, getting closer, looking at him in that
Castiel glares at Dean, not pleased by his attitude, “Dean, that was very rude.”
“Oh.” He says, still somewhat glumly.
“Why do you think that?” Sam asks, turning to look at Cass.
Throughout their entire conversation, Dean never once said that he wasn’t in love with Cass. He doesn’t know what to make of Dean’s sudden admission. Sam feels dizzy at the possibilities. Cass loves Dean. He’s come to accept that as a fact. But this is his brother, Sam
He’s putting Sam in danger now. He runs a hand through his hair in exasperation. “Damn it, Chuck.” He curses.
“I did it to save you.” Cass whispers.
Laughing, Dean shakes his head, “It was never high on my priority list.”
Feel free to check out my new work:
“Where are we going?” Cass asks, after a minute passes and they’re both still standing in the middle of the court yard.
A fleeting look and quick retreat seems to be the Winchester way.
Well, his worst nightmare isn’t walking into the bar. That would be the Winchesters.
His eyes drift over to Dean. He looks so content like this. Sitting and talking to Cass about onions of all things.
“Sam?” he calls shakily.
When Dean comes out and shoos Cass out of his room, he once again sits on his bed, cradling the trench-coat in his arms.
“I couldn’t.” Dean breathes out, then lower; “If I have to raise him I will, but he
“Who do I spend the most time with Dean?” Cass snaps.
“Yeah.” Dean murmurs. “Have you thought about what you’re going to do?”
“Maybe.” Cass says. “It was you Dean, I would have listened to anything.”
Sam scoffs, things are really the same between them.
Now, there’s a good idea. “Why don’t you?” he asks, “Come visit I mean. I’m sure this is the longest you and Dean have been apart.”
dun dun dun
“You know your brother.” Cass mutters, resigned, “He’s not open to change. Something like this would break him.”
Dean feels a flush creep up his neck, knowing that Cass will know exactly what he’s going to be doing. Exactly what movements his hands would make as he gets closer to the edge.
He remembers last night vividly – last night, consisting of mostly an endless orgy.
“Tell me what makes you happy so that we can toss it.”
“Then I’ll come with you.”
“Nothing.” He says smoothly.
Something in Sam’s eyes brings Dean closer. He knows his brother well enough to know when secrets are swirling in his eyes.
Cass smiles at him. “No, you’re not.” He says. The words don’t come out in a way that makes Dean think he’s holding onto any animosity. They’re just words. Facts.
“How dare you say that to me!?” Dean barks, remembering how he had felt when Cass had
‘It’s not going to be a great talk.’ He expected as much, but hearing the words out loud makes it feel all too real.
“Why?” his friend sounds hurt and Dean feels his will waver.
“Well, it wasn’t great.” He recalls how crushed he had been. “You’ve always just… pushed your feelings aside for the greater good. But this time was different. You were worried about being hurt and you
Dean starts the Impala’s engine with a great huff. Cass couldn’t have gotten far. He’s wingless and carless for goodness sake.
Cass leaving.
“What happened, Dean?” More gentleness.
It’s more peaceful than he ever slept before. Like slowly drifting off into another world. His sleep was so deep, in fact, that not even the blaring, heavenly, alarms signifying an incursion could not break him out of it. Not even Dean’s screams and tugs could snap him out of it.
“Whatever you say Dean.”
Chuck stares at him smugly, knowing that he’s won. Defeated them totally and completely.
Pressing his lips into a thin line Sam looks dubious, “Fair enough Cass. But that isn’t happening. Whatever happened… whatever Dean saw… he can get past it.”
Sam’s brain does a barrel roll as Dean turns back to glance at himself in the mirror, actually
That had been humiliating, though he supposes he’s thankful that the entire pie stuck to his face covered his surely embarrassing expression. Dean had chortled like a mad-man and even Sam had let out a chuckle. Castiel, however, had been enraged.
Dean raises a brow. “Oh? Look, don’t get the wrong idea buddy-”
Cass shrieks as he approaches, waving a plastic shovel at him.
“He knows you don’t,” Sam assures. “Not that way at least. He still needs you. He still needs his friend.” He can sense that Dean is right on the edge of pulling away completely. He knows how much Dean’s friendship means to Cass, but he also understands why Dean wouldn’t want to risk it. The thing is Cass can’t be happy, but he can get by being okay. Without Dean, he’d be miserable.
He glances at the timer to find that they’re only ten seconds in to minute four.
Would Sam want to take that away from him if that really is in the cards?
“Chuck is the one making all the ruckus, humans are quiet. When we defeat him… you can rest.”
“I don’t.” He says, his looks regretful. “It’s not real, Cass. We’re not real. I won’t let someone control me. Not again. I refuse to be part of some ‘grand plan.’”
That’s why Dean kept having seizures. He makes Cass happy, but killing him wouldn’t make Cass happy so it stopped before death. It’s the strangest paradox Sam has ever heard of.
“Not that you’re not nice.” Dean continues, “Cause you are. Nice dorky little guy.”
“So if I stop you from having fun… you’ll laugh about it?” Cass sounds sceptical and his facial expression would be funny, except Dean can tell he’s really worried about somehow messing this up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because I didn’t think you’d care.”
“Of course not.” He answers, resolute.
Inevitably, as he ponders his response, his gaze lands on Cass’ bed… because it takes up most of the room, not because Dean’s thinking about the good times they’ve had on it.
The love he found but could never hold onto.
And he brings cake too, it’s basically the same.
“I don’t know.” He says. “Besides, I think Castiel is the best person to talk some sense into him. Failing that, Sam will have to drag his ass back here.”
“I thought you were talking about sex.” He smiles sheepishly.
“Okay.”
Cass had taken his words in stride. As though they had no bearing on his life anymore. As if his time with Dean was already cut from the cloth of his existence.
Sam chuckles and nudges his shoulder. “It’s nothing bad. I’m just happy for you. You guys can get past this Crowley thing. Cass really cares about you and so do Mom and I.”
Now Castiel feels like a fool.
Sparing Sam but the slightest glance, Dean focuses his attention on the sullen Cass once more.
Sam.”
“Of course.” Cass says evenly. “Dean, what do you want from this?”
“Please,” Dean begs as Sam shakes his head and murmurs the word ‘no’ over and over.
“Oh.” Says Sam, almost ashamed of his gross over reaction. That makes sense. He bends to retrieve his thankfully not-broken laptop.
“Sam.” He admonishes pressing a hand to his chest. “Dean said you and Mary were working a case.”
“A day later, it was a siren.”
Castiel makes the first move, pressing their lips together and stroking along Dean’s tongue with his own.
After a moment of sucking and licking where Dean is sure he’s having some sort of out of body experience, Cass pulls back, regarding him silently. “Looks like the student becomes the teacher.”
Would Dean cuddle with him after or was he expected to leave?
Spending that night together had changed them both. In the coldness of the storm, they’d managed to develop a bond, despite the knife, threats, and vandalism. Despite the fact that they’re both from wildly different worlds, Castiel can feel just how
“What’s your go word?” he asks. “You and Sam, you have a code word – ”
“Damn it.” he rolls his eyes. Why does he have to look so pleading and lost?
“Why did you hide your wings? I enjoyed having them around.”
Glancing over at Cass tells him that he’s deeply engrossed in his task. Dean feels a bit guilty for not being as focused, but takes his phone out discretely. He opens the tracking app. How could it
“Okay.” He says, still trying to maintain his ‘tough guy, I don’t give a flying fuck’ attitude. “I’ll come with you, but the minute anything – and I mean anything – comes up, that I’m not down with. I’ll haul ass so fast that my own father would never find me.”
His eyes flash as he focuses on Sam and Mary once more. “Of course I did you, idiot. Did you
Because Dean is gone.
He grins to himself. He’s going to ask Dean on a brate.
“Dean!” Sam bellows joining Cass in his shouting. A few more minutes and he’ll be joining Cass in crying too.
“Dean.” He drones. “Could you stop?”
“By forcing Cass to sit there while you crank the heat up?”
“Cass, stop.” Dean’s voice cuts through his panic. His expression has softened considerably. “I’m not throwing you out.” He looks away, mumbling the next part. “Never again.”
Wait, what?
“Put them on.” The demon says easily.
“Oh yes you are.” He says menacingly, “I’ll eat your precious beet if you play doctor while I do.” Dean chuckles, “A beet root a day keeps Dr Cass away.”
bacon, he insisted on a field trip to the kitchen to stock up on more snacks. Sam even lets himself indulge a little. It isn’t often he and Dean get to hang out alone.
Castiel knows Dean, he knows that his anger was temporary; he was mourning the life they built together, which is understandable. But so many things have been left unsaid.
Dean spits out his beer.
good. Words are one thing, but actions and interpretations are another. They still have a long way to go before good. But this is a start. Dean and Cass are talking. No one is in need of a diaper change – thank God.
“I highly doubt that he
He deflates. And so it begins.
“I want you too.” Dean pecks his lips quickly and works his way downward, stopping right above his pants.
To his chagrin the angel only blushes and ducks his head with a small: “Thank you Dean.”
“How?” Dean demands. “Michael fucked off to La La Land and we aer defenceless and trapped in his wretched place.”
Now it’s Dean’s turn to look ashamed. “I know. I just don’t want to screw anything up.”
Swallowing the rest of that sentence, Dean tries to cover it with a smile. Oh, but Castiel knows. He’d watched Dean pick up women from bars most night and watched as they preened under his careful attention. Jealousy had hacked away at him just like it is now. For a woman whose face Dean would forget the next day.
Sam raises a hand, to reveal a pair of demon cuffs. “As long as you’re here, these stay on.”
Right?
Castiel vividly remembers the green and yellow plaid that he’d worn to the convention. This shirt is white, pure white in fact with hints of silver and gold flecks. It’s more of a dress shirt than a jersey really though it does have a Nero style collar. This reminds Castiel of what kings had worn hundreds of years ago. Elegant and majestic… something that separated them from mere men.
His last interaction with Crowley had made him suspicious. After leaving Dean, he heads down to the dungeon. Luckily, only Mary is there, and in need of a bathroom break.
Because Dean
It takes Sam a moment to collect himself, but when he does, his voice is strong and certain. “He would want us to save him, from
Dean glances back helplessly. It wasn’t Sam’s fault he was driven mad. But that isn’t what Castiel needs to hear.
Sam can’t believe it. Maybe Dean not telling him about the pearl has something to do with why he’d been collapsing as of late.
“Yeah. Your M.O.” Sam says. “You don’t go out of your way to help someone like this. With you and me it’s different, cause you don’t have to explicitly show me how much you care, or even say the words. It’s just something I know. And you know that I know. So you don’t need to say it. With Cass it’s different. He doesn’t get the cues. Or the references. So you have to spell it out for him and I get why that might be hard for you. But I trust you and I know you’ll do the right thing here.”
Castiel moves to stand, but Dean’s hands clamp down on his. “Wait.” He says urgently, “Something to think about when you’re deciding.”
Castiel leaves the Impala first. He knows that Dean needs a few minutes to come back to himself. And truthfully? So does Castiel.
Why, nowhere, of course.
And just as suddenly the child blips away leaving Sam staring at the unfilled trench-coat and the magical pearl that grants your heart’s greatest desire.
He doesn’t know what to say to that. “We… we crossed some major lines Cass.”
Until that.
Sam raises his hand half-way.
“Okay.” Cass says, cutting him off, “We’ll get an oil diffuser before we go. Maybe even some scented candles!”
He feels his heart break. Dean is so convinced that Castiel doesn’t want him, that he still can’t have something. “You know it Dean.. There was never any doubt about how I felt… it’s like it said: I love you. I always have. Everyone knows it. The thought of sex has always bored me, except in regards to you. Sometimes, I find myself wondering what it would be like to breach the few inches between us and kiss you – like it did just now, but without fear. Or to have you open your eyes and the first thing you see is me – maybe, I imagine, you’d love me too.”
“Then so be it.”
Cass.”
Castiel feels his jaw go slack. His fingers itch to pluck it from Gabriel’s grasp. Use it to heal Dean. But he knows what seeming over eager will get him; a steaming pile of nothing.
win without someone dying. But it’s over.
Castiel lets Jack rant, letting out his frustration.
“Greeting.” He says coldly.
As the water begins to fill up, Cass glances speculatively at Dean. “Are things really that simple.”
He definitely needs to make pie more often.
He’s still kind of tired but he has to admit, the beet gave him a boost, despite it looking like a ripped out heart.
“You can’t just leave stuff lying around,” Crowley says, seeming more and more amused. “Books, boyfriends, someone can just snatch them up.”
die.” Lucifer grins at the thought. “Maybe it will be in bed, in the night when there’s nothing you can do to stop it, or maybe his face just drops into his breakfast… you won’t know when it’s coming. You won’t be able to stop it. It will eat you up bit by bit… and Dean will know… and he’ll hate himself.”
Castiel swallows, the sound excruciatingly loud in the silence of the room.
But Adam talks over him, as though he hadn’t heard a word. “You don’t trust me. That’s why you’ve started hiding things from me.” he says in a panic. “What have I done?” he gulps. “What have I done to lose your trust?”
“You slept with me?” Dean’s voice is breathy.
“You still knew where I was.” Cass defends, “But you left the area completely. You didn’t even try to tell me.”
“Alright,” says Dean, clapping his hands together. “Scram. I’m about to get naked.”
He tries to wrench himself upright but the floor isn’t under his feet and everything is black.
That night, after dinner, Sam makes a show of walking around the bunker, scrubbing viciously at his teeth.
Maybe it isn’t working because Castiel is holding back the biggest secret of all: his love for Dean.
“Sup, Cass?” he mumbles around a mouthful of pie. “You wanted a bite?”
Dean takes another couple minutes collecting himself before they decide to head for the library.
Singing him a haunting lullaby, in Dean’s voice, wearing Dean’s face, as he drifts into nothing.
He releases Cass and pats him one last time on the shoulder, as he’s seen them both do so many times before. Almost in slow motion he sees Dean reach for the top draw and in the same instant he sees Cass’ face change completely. He’s never seen a toddler look quite so distressed.
“I’ve come to collect on our deal.” The demon almost looks regretful, eyes darting left to right in a twitchy, almost in a crazed manner
“Yeah.” Dean says. “It’s gonna be like a Team Free Will bonding sesh.”
A sullen “Sleep well Dean.” is all he gets.
Sure screwing around with Cass felt good, but how could he know that Amara’s – whatever – wasn’t messing with him too? Making him just as crazy with lust. After all it all linked back to their bond. Maybe when he’d touched Cass’ wings he’d created some kind of feedback loop that just kept propelling them deeper and deeper into the act.
“Now.” Dean reaffirms. If he doesn’t do it now, he’ll probably never have the guts again.
Thank you to my fantastic beta
“Please throw the rest out.” Dean begs after only two bites.
He stretches slowly and heads down the hall to the only place he’s positive Cass would head to… Dean’s room.
“You’d move on,” Cass says.
“We… talked,” Dean says carefully.
Sam supposes he must know why the pearl is malfunctioning. That’s one mystery that he
At dinner, they all stare at the table quietly… well Dean and Cass do. Sam spends most of his time looking between them searchingly.
“Dean.” He whispers as he comes down.
Cass doesn’t move. He sucks… like a vacuum and moves his tongue on the underside of his member like a pro. Dean shudders and gasps, legs flailing and muscles trembling violently. He’s too close too soon. Instead of screwing his eyes shut, he lets himself enjoy Cass as he finally starts pumping his mouth up and down.
“It does not seem to be working.”
“Dean loves you.” Jack points out.
*V()V* - represents the beginning and end points of Castiel's nightmare world.
Clearly stricken, Dean rubs a hand down his face, massaging his jaw. “God.” He hisses. “I– I didn’t think it was true.”
Slamming Rowena’s spell book shut, Sam clears his throat loudly. “Now that that’s over…”
“Uh, buddy?” he tugs at his hand slightly to get Cass’ attention. “I wanted to head back to my room.”
I know it's been a while, but I hope you liked it! I have the rest of this mostly planned out so updates should be more frequent *fingers crossed*
Castiel grinds his teeth together. Why is it, that in every possible world, him and Dean are estranged beyond repair or dead?
Cass presses his lips together.
“Well… no one else dies.”
“And now it’s dragged you to the bottom of the ocean.”
With a resolute headshake, Dean keeps them in place. “We’re doing this right.” He says. “I’m gonna make this so good for you.”
“Nothing.”
Cass yanks him back and Dean covers the bleeding spot, wiping away the excess blood. He can tell the cut isn’t deep so he isn’t very worried. What he
“I don’t want to get to you.” he singsongs, flicking Castiel’s nose. “I just needed to get
Focusing intently, Cass presses his fingers to Dean’s fore head. Woah. Is he healing Dean? That’s certainly save them the trouble of dealing with a grumpy as hell Dean. Frowning, Cass repeats the gesture with a bit more force. Then again and again until he’s basically banging on Dean’s head.
Cass stills, realisation dawning. “How long can you keep doing this?”
Scoffing, Dean holds his fork out to Cass while sticking out his tongue to his mother and brother. “None of you deserve this.” He teases.
As suspected. Crowley leaves and not five minutes later a hot chick slides in next to him.
. Ugh. Dean shivers at that horrid thought.
“I really missed you Sammy.”
Sam wrenches it open, jumping back as he sees the child sitting peacefully inside it.
Now, thinking about it, he did notice Cass picking up the bill, pretending to look at it speculatively. After that, Dean never saw the bill again. He thinks back to all the times that this had happened – with napkins too – and he smiles. Cass had done it on cases pretty often, but also when they were just hanging out. When he and Cass went out to try fishing, Cass snatched the receipt from the bait shop. It’s nice to know that the experiences they share mean something.
“I’m sorry that I just checked out.” Dean blurts, not wanting to wait any longer.   ‘I know I promised to be straight with you and help you believe that this is real. But you got your powers back. You’re back to your angel ways. And as an angel Cass… you always left. This time, I just wanted to be the one to check out first. That isn’t the point though,” Dean ends sombrely, “I fucked up. I’m so sorry Cass.”
Harsh breaths escape Dean. He’s panicking, Castiel realises. But what right did he have to panic? Castiel is the one who had been deceived.
“C-ass.” His voice cracks on the tail end.
And Dean takes advantage of the luxury as much as he can. He lets himself moan a little louder than normal, not having to worry about Sam hearing him from across the room, or through a thin bathroom wall.
This must be the artefact Sam was talking about.
Dean finds himself in his room panicking about the fact that he just ate burnt beet and that he just asked Cass to dress up as Dr Sexy.
The shower curtain is ripped open and Dean shrieks, placing a hand securely over his junk. “Cass what the hell man?” Dean demands lifting a knee to shield himself some more. Usually he won’t care but it feels different this time… more vulnerable.
“You’re dead.” He whispers in despondency.
to care about auras.
“And you’re any better djinn?” he asks. “This is the same concept as Aladdin, right?” Dean deepens his voice. “Phenomenal cosmic powers … itty bitty living space?”
“So?” Sam asks again. “You in?”
Any ideas on what's going on here? *wink wink nudge nudge*
He wants to scream it loud enough that the Empty is forced to flee, but his tongue lies dead like a fish in his mouth.
“You two – you click. Nowadays, you don’t find that very often. It’s not something you want to pass up easily.”
“Let’s get him out of here.” Sam says, crouching to grab Cass’ legs.
“Really?” Crowley asks, still seated, as he isn’t worried about being murdered. “Can’t we be civil?”
Dean catches himself quickly. “Cass?”
“Take your shirt off.”
Castiel is about to say something when Dean suddenly slams his fork down and pushes the pie away. “Sometimes Cass… I think you’re the only thing going right for me. Just having you with me is like a win in a sea of losses. And when you go… ” Dean’s voice trembles and he can sense the emotions welling in Dean. He knows the exact moment his friend loses control. His shoulders shake slightly and his palms press into his eyes to try to stop his tears.
As he makes his way to the kitchen, the scent of the pie becomes more prominent. It’s some damn good pie; his nose never lies.
Then he kisses Dean, letting their lips move together in a way he’d never thought he’d get to experience. In a way that makes him really forget.
No, Dean decides, he isn’t gay. Sex was sex and touching was touching. It was impossible to
Again.
In a flash, Lucifer flies them back into the bunker, into Dean’s room. Sam wants to believe that this is all a hallucination, but the smell of burning leather stays with him, reminds him of just how royally he’s screwed up.
“Washing again I see.” Sam says. Dean can hear the suspicion in his voice.
Blood is everywhere and Sam feels his heart stop.
– to leave things in a better state that you found them. He’s struggling too Cass. Sometimes I think you forget. But Dean is struggling and seeing you abandon him won’t do him any good.”
Dean’s eyes slip shut.
His eyes drift to the TV stand. It’s filled with cowboy movies… some… chick-flicks. His eyes dart to Cass who smiles a little wider. He sees the board games on the shelf and the deck of cards. Dean knows that they had fun, that they were determined to do the best that they could do with what little time they had.
“Man, I gotta pay that bill tomorrow.” Dean groans. “We really didn’t think through having such a long driveway.”
Dean is silent and he hates it. All his expressions are lost in the pitch black. He hears a gulp, “I’m trying.”
“There were things left unsaid between us.” He murmurs. “And Heaven is closed and all my allies are dead. No demon will even take my deal and I have nothing left here. But Death will never come to be.”
It’s comfortable, companiable.
“Tell me Dean.” Cass squirms slightly, desperation creeping into his voice.
But Sam’s spell definitely did something, because Castiel is no longer a she. Gone are the curves, the delicate lips and the locks of flowing hair… in their place though, he sees something very familiar. Unmistakable are Cass’ broad shoulders, strong jawline and short messy hair. It’s galling, how alike they look. If not for the tattoos running up and down Castiel’s body, Dean would mistake him for Cass.
He’s figured out a while ago; that Cass had taken to hanging out in there so that he’d see Dean whenever he popped in for beer or snacks. Common sense had struck at some point, and he’d taken to leaving small caches of food in his room, to stop the constant trips. But then, he realized that he’d been seeing Cass less and less, so he ditched that habit and swung by the kitchen as much as possible. Sometimes, he even haggled Cass into movie night, and they both pretended that it was a chore; Dean to convince him to come and Cass to actually watch the movie.
A breathy sigh leaves the angel’s lips. “You die at seventy-eight Dean. Peacefully in your sleep and the next day, I follow you to heaven.”
His eyes search Cass’ face for any sign of uncertainty. He doesn’t want to start this thing off wrong. But is that possible as it had started with Cass yanking his ass out of hell?
“You’re going to die Dean.” Castiel whispers, blinking a few times to clear the image from his mind. “Not for many years, but your death is inevitable.”
By including Sam, he not only squeezes in some precious brother bonding, but he also can take Cass out on an unofficial date.
Maybe this ‘closeness’ can bring them all together. Kind of like a team-building exercise. Where two thirds of the team are secretly boning. Not just boning, he reminds himself. He’s like Cass’ emotional support dog, who also specialises in sex stuff.
As he tries to stand, Dean’s hand shoots out, latching onto his shirt and dragging him back down. “You can’t go.” He whispers.
“You know, Dean, I always thought that the bubble was a place. Somewhere where we could be together and do and say anything we please. Now that this is real… you’re my bubble in a perverse sort of way.”
“What’ll be today gentlemen?” Dean purses his lips at the British accent. It reminds him of the Men of Letters – Mick. Crowley.
“What’s going on?” he says slowly.
Castiel looks at him sceptically. “I didn’t hit you on the nose with a door.”
“Then explain it to me.” he begs.
He turns to Cass a teary smile on his face, he can see the angel’s mind trying to churn out a solution. He stayed by their side through thick and thin and now there would be no more. Throughout his life, Dean managed to weasel his way out of many jams, but an apocalypse year in and year out has taken its toll. Dean is tired. He knows he should be following Cass’ lead. To find a way out. Glancing to his other side, he can see the look of determination on Sam’s face. If anyone deserves to make it out alive, it would be Sam. He’s the only one of them who has a chance at normal. But Chuck won’t let that happen.
“I can barely hold myself up over here.” He says.
before his curtains are closed, then damn it all to hell.
“So simple-minded, Squirrel. Maybe Moose has a more insightful answer.”
“I said that you have impeccable taste.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Eventually the townspeople will notice too, that he’s aging while your vessel remains pristine. Then it will be time to leave that little cottage. Neither of you will want to. It will break Dean’s heart. But he’ll do it, to stay with you. When you start over, people might think he’s your father, or your grandfather – if you keep using your grace to heal him.”
“You just want to turn him into a mini-Dean.” Teases Sam. “You know he’s not going to stay like this forever right.”
“Say it, Sam.” He challenges.
As the gears creak to a stop at the top of the wheel, Dean shuts his eyes and clamps his hand over Cass’.
Something tears inside him and his fist darts out, hoping to knock Sam out, give them some time to think of a plan. But his panic makes him sloppy – easy to read. Sam bats his hand away and dives backwards. Dean realises what he’s going for a minute too late. As his fingers wrap around the lamp, Castiel’s form flickers as his new owner takes control.
to be on the receiving end.”
Cass sits at his side, pressing two fingers to his forehead every so often then pulling back when nothing happens.
Well…
“Okay.” Cass says.
He could barely admit it to himself.
“What?”
“You’re hiding something from me,” Sam says.
“But.” Sam continues. “She didn’t. That’s because you wanted to intimidate us into staying here.”
“Goo.”
“It’s – sorry Cass.” Sam mumbles.
Nothing.
Has anyone noticed the little spelling discrepancy between two words yet? :D Trust me, the distinction is important!
Castiel frowns. “Don’t you like it?” he asks, deflating slightly.
“These aren’t your lungs Mr Winchester.” He observes, smiling slightly.
And he
Now, he just has to prove it.
Adam takes a breath. “Not like this.” He whispers.
Sam words along side him blissfully unaware of his plan. If one could even call it a plan. Truth be told it seems more like a disaster waiting to happen, but it will do the trick – he hopes.
Anticipation has his body trembling, his cock leaking and neglected on his thigh. He doesn’t mind, a couple strokes and he suspects he’ll come. No, he wants to wait, until Dean is fully inside him.
“What is
“I don’t intend to Sam.” He adds with more bite than intended. “I know what last night was. I know Dean would have never done anything otherwise. Believe me Sam, I have no misconceptions whatsoever about our relationship. I just worry that Dean will feel obligated to change things. I was waiting to tell him just that before you pulled me away.”
is stashed in the glove compartment of the Impala.
“Dean isn’t one for fashion.” He admits.
Sam finds himself at the threshold of Dean’s room once more. He replaced the pearl in it’s original hiding spot, knowing that Dean and Cass would only ever be alone in this room with an adult.
“Dude.” Dean whispers. “You’re supposed to be helping me.”
Or maybe it’s just his hunger.
His win.
“Come on, Cass,” Dean begs. “Just five things that you think could trigger it.”
Michael closes his eyes.
Emotions are strange, wily, things. And he never imagined that Dean might feel this way. That his emotions would be powerful enough to reduce him to a mess. He hates it. That he caused his friend such distress. So Castiel reaches forward with one hand to stroke Dean’s head as he burries his face in the folds of his elbow as he tries to even his breathing.
“Now,” Sam says, “Let’s talk about your deal.”
“Dean doesn’t know.” Sam divulges, feeling his skin crawl. Cass had gone over a year thinking that Dean knew but didn’t care.
Cass’ eyes snap up to his immediately. “Oh.”
Deflated, Sam can’t find it in himself to answer.
On his back, knees bent and spread, Dean almost regrets asking to shift. Now he’s forced to see Cass, see exactly who’s doing what to him and it’s scary. He half expects Cass to stare at him throughout but to his shock the angel doesn’t even say a word as his mouth swallows Dean whole. The abruptness has his legs gripping the angel in a vice, his hands reaching for the mop of short black hair beneath him.
Slowly, he breaches the rim, pressing gently and lightly licking Castiel’s erection. After a few minutes Dean’s finger stills and he slowly draws it back, Castiel hisses, arching his back as new nerve endings are stimulated. Dean’s fingers slide past something inside him that makes him screech and fall, boneless, onto the bed. That fingers stills, still resting on the bundle of nerves that Castiel can only assume is his prostate. He keens, swirling his hips, trying to get Dean’s finger closer.
“My pants were sticky and cold.”
“For Lucifer.” Dean says seriously. “There’s nothing holding us back now. Let’s just get it over with.”
The laughing gas had been one.
That causes him to stop chewing. Damn it. He swallows the food in his mouth and lays a hand on Castiel’s. He isn’t really being fair is he? This should be about Castiel; not Dean’s over zealous stomach.
. “You remember that Baby is a safe space right?”
“Yes there is.” He breathes, cupping Cass’ face, “He can still kill you.”
“See Cass… the thing about that particular spell…” he chances a glance at Dean who has his nostrils flares like some kind of bucking bronco. “You need to do something before it wears off.”
Understanding dawns and Gabriel loses the smug expression. “Crap. I didn’t think.”
a nickname, not one that stuck  anyway or that he liked . Sam sticks with Dean because he can’t imagine calling his brother anything else. Because he hadn’t thought that Dean would
Where is the other one? Sam? He must be close by. Their cursed Impala is parked out front; a clear ‘all creatures steer clear of the area.’
“You know it isn’t that Dean. Sam told me.” it’s not judgemental, though it does sound pitiful and dejected. At least Dean came to see him off. His eyes roam over his visage, taking note of every ripple his soul makes. He doesn’t need time to memorise it, he’d practically remade him; he already has it imprinted onto his very grace. The mountains could crumble and the sun could implode but Castiel would remember Dean Winchester’s soul.
Michael stands and bows dramatically with a sickly smile on Dean's face. "Took you all long enough... it's not like I was being subtle."
“But…” Cass’ confusion is evident. “
The thought of hiding it makes him queasy – as much as angels who don’t eat can be queasy. But telling Dean strikes terror into his heart. He wishes things could be easy, that he could go back in time and never find that cursed book.
Dean yanks his head away so fast he gets whip last. “Woah!” he wishes the ground would open up and swallow him on Castiel’s behalf.
Castiel is happy. Truly happy, for the first time in his life. Just putting it into words was enough. Castiel can see Dean’s soul. His beautiful soul and how it reacts to his words, how it accepts them, thrives on them… reciprocates them.
“Dean!” the demon snaps, the blood on his face drips into Castiel’s eyes, “You know you can’t lift him. Back off!”
“Whatever.” Dean snaps; he can grill Cass’ to his heart’s content later. Or maybe not. The angel’s love confession has his mind in tatters. How could he not have known? How could Cass have kept this from him? He knows he isn’t the most emotional person in the world, but Cass is one of the few people he’d actually hear out.
“I’ve created a monster.” He murmurs, deciding to let Cass listen to his shitty music.
“Don’t move.” His voice is scratchy. He grasps Dean’s hand – the one scratching the carpet – and holds it tightly. “Don’t panic Dean. Just let your body relax.”
“Dean?”
Dean’s words resonate within him. It’s not their usual promise… it’s something more profound. It easies Castiel’s nerves. It reminds him that Dean will be waiting for him in heaven when all is said and done. For the first time that day he relaxes, letting his body sink into their memory foam mattress.
Things continued piling up on them until they find a rhythm to talk  at all. Dean isn’t about to let that happen again.
Sam flicks his nose. “I know, Dean. You’ve always been very smart.”
Who knew fun could be so draining. After participating in numerous games and activities, Dean is bushed. Cass looks more alive than ever and he’s definitely enjoying it here.
He’d been so stupid. To think that Dean could love him. So gullible. So useless.
“I … don’t want to psychoanalyse it.” Cass says, slowly. Dean realises that he’s choosing his words carefully. He hates that they’ve come to this. “Do you want to know why I don’t talk to you like that?”
Well, it might as well have been invisible to Dean. He’d forgotten about it completely.
He’s expecting the First Blade. Dreading it as he always had.
“Cass what’s going on?”
He can’t believe the feel of being pinned between the cold tile wall and Dean’s warm back.
“I saw you two.”
He shakes his head in shock. “Well, thanks for that moment of resounding support.”
“I liked this morning.” He says, his eyes gravitating towards those blue orbs like always, “This. Waking up to you.”
“I’m coming back.” Cass assures, squeezing Dean’s hands tightly.
Sam shakes his head, refuting it.
“We have one pro and one con.” Sam says instead.
he’d get stuck with the one angel in the friggin’ garrison who isn’t an obedient bitch.
“But… and most important, I think… I know what you’ve forgotten.”
“Could your wish have anything to do with … a specific person.”
Castiel feels the euphoria of their win too, as he looks to Dean and Sam and Jack.
It doesn’t matter.
Dean’s next words come out uncertain. “But I think we should wait before we try it again.”
“But the map!” she protests.
Still. A larger question remains; why did he do it?
“Hey!” he shouts, as metal gleams in the distance. “That’s Baby.”
A beat of silence passes between them as Dean gulps down his water.
“Why haven’t you said anything?” Sam can’t help but pry. “It’s obvious that your feelings are real and that they’ve been around for some time.”
“I talked to my mom.” Dean continues, clearly wanting to be the one to start the discussion. Maybe he thinks that if he shows Castiel that he can open up, then Castiel will follow suit. It’s sweet, he thinks, but unnecessary.
“No,” Sam says refusing to tell Dean that Cass enjoyed inspecting his mouth as he chewed or that Dean sometimes nibbled on Cass’ finger when he wanted some of his food. It’s nice to know stuff about Dean that he doesn’t know about himself. He wonders how Dean would react to some of the pictures he took of them. He considers getting his phone out but ultimately decides against it. There's no use antagonizing his brother when they’re supposed to be having a relaxing evening out.
“Nothing happened.” Dean assures. “You know I don’t swing that way.”
I'm also thinking of doing an arc for Crowley (POV's, romantic interests etc.) It would really help to tie in Lucifer and his whereabouts.
“Crowley said some stuff.” The words sound strangled but he knows that this is something they
“But I’ve done so many things wrong. I’ve betrayed you and Sam… on multiple occasions.” He feels the shame in his voice as he remembers all the ways he’d let them down.
“Then clap your hands.”
How could Dean even let himself be manipulated into something like this? He’s known his brother to sometimes confuse reality with porn but this is a new level, even for him. And Cass. Tricking them once again.
Of course.
It gets a reaction though. His head springs up and he stares, wide eyed. “Impossible.”
Dean’s eyes widen, flashing over to him.
“All I’m tryin’ to say is that to make sure that Cass is happy, we need to make sure he isn’t happy.” Dean finally says. “Until we find a way to fix this.”
“It’s been a while since I’ve had a truly good shag.” He bites out as the angel remains stationary.
Castiel perches on his bed, head in his hands as he glares down at the book. To read it or not to read it… he really isn’t sure if he even has a chance. All he'd accomplished so far was embarrassing both himself and Dean.
“Do you mean… what I think you mean?” Dean’s voice is shrill.
he thou-” Dean pauses, his hand reaching out to grab at Castiel’s wrist.
His bones have decayed to dust by now. The continents have probably shifted so much that Sam’s gravesite  had scattered across the globe. Who knew. Maybe molecules of Sam were floating around just outside their little barrier. It makes him nauseous.
And so he waits, in the serene silence. But the path is clear... no trench coated angels in sight. With a heavy sigh, Dean moves to turn on the radio, only to pull up short.
A multitude of emotions cross Dean’s face. They flash at such an alarming rate that Castiel can’t clearly discern any of them. He feels more wetness roll down his cheeks as his fear increases. Dean’s hatred had been his greatest fear but looking into his eyes, all he sees is emptiness.
Dean thinks he doesn’t want to stay… and he had thought that Dean wanted him to go. If they had managed to make such a major miscommunication about such a simple thing, what else had they misinterpreted?
“Okay, Cass. Now that we’re back…” Dean rubs his hands together, allowing Sam to get a peek at the page.
Shame wells up in him. “And I got angry with you.”
“Cass don’t touch that!” But it’s too late.
“Where is Cass?” Jack’s voice is like a shard through Dean’s heart.
Castiel scowls, kicking up the dirt as he marches away from the stupid cottage. Michael is waiting for him by a little table and bench a few feet away. He smirks, in amusement as Castiel sits by his side.
Well, at least Dean is coming to his defence now, instead of lashing out at Cass.
“Cass.” He breathes. “You came.”
“Castiel.” With a wave of her hand Lucifer is pushed aside.
think that he was in love with him. How could Dean stand by while his best friend’s heart was breaking? That other Dean and Castiel made things work, even though they just have a few days together. Dean and Cass are
“What if you find someone… to settle down with?” his expression is unsure and Dean almost harrumphs at the thought.
Due to Metatron downloading an entire database of literature into his head, he’s well aware that some people like receiving hickeys while others do not. Dean might not like the idea because it leaves a love mark in plain view. Sam could see, or Mary, and he doesn’t know if Dean is really ready to go public.
The ride down had given him time to think and he’d decided on one thing: no more. No more hiding and no more doubt. Castiel is going to seduce Dean Winchester.
Sam nods. “It’s a recent thing, but it’s something we both enjoy doing together.” Dean feels a little jealous. But Sam is right, there are just certain people you want for certain things. “So you understand? I wasn’t mad, or sad, or feeling left out. I just realised that the two of you needed some time to do the things Dean and Cass enjoy doing together.”
He feels his skin crawl.
“Hey,” Sam says to the honey vendor. “Have you seen the guy I was here with?”
Just then, the door slams, open, breaking the witch’s concentration. Dean is shocked to see a figure immediately shoot her square between the eyes before marching over to them.
Dean turns slowly, almost trembling at the type of monster that would prompt such an expression from Cass.
Cass shrieks as Dean catches him around the waist placing the brush in his hair. “Sam first! Sam first!”
Pounding on Dean’s door, he allows himself to let out his frustration, making a huge racket.
“Dean can I get a pet?”
“Dean. You scared me.”
He just wishes they would stop dancing around each other and kiss. No one would be in doubt after that.
Chastised, Castiel and Dean begin toting the body back to the Impala.
His next words are whispered. “I hope I’m making the right choice.” Then louder, more confident. “If you leave him now, Dean will never forgive you.”
“Hey.” He says, reaching out and patting his shoulder. “Tell me.” Dean needs a distraction from thinking about his heart being ripped out of his chest anyway.
Green eyes land on him, pupils dilated… blown wide with shock.
“Yes, is there someone we’re forgetting?” he asks sarcastically.
“I’m glad you didn’t show up in that suit.” Sam teases.
There’s no denying that.
looked at him pointedly, in fact, while he was being accused of the opposite.
The Shadow.
Cass’ eyes find his in the silence, “You shouldn’t have to force yourself to do this Dean.”
But, being a good brother, Sam just nods and assures him that he’ll be okay.
Should he even bother?
onto us. We’ll never be able to spend another moment together without Sam thinking that we’re doing something. And that’s the best case scenario. Worst case? Sam freaks the fuck out and blames me for taking advantage of you.”
“You can’t do that.”
“Tell me about the bones!” he demands, and because he’s in the mood for a tirade, he doesn’t stop there, “Tell me why you bought furniture for a place we’re staying at for a few weeks! Tell me why we’re at this cottage in the middle of nowhere when I saw at least four motels in town. Tell me the truth!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then we’re having kale for dinner.” He says brightly, grinning when Dean looks stricken, “I mean, you
“Dean I’m sorry.” He feels his face flush in shame. Even a simple caramel sauce seemed too complicated for him.
He wants to drape himself all over it.
“I’ll take that as a yes. It’s a classic after all,” Crowley smirks at his discomfort. “Let’s think of the little squirrel as Dean, naturally. And the acorn he destroys anything chasing after as Castiel.” It’s not a bad comparison, Sam thinks. “The squirrel continuously breaks the world in some futile attempt to catch the acorn, that for some reason, just keeps leaving him. Imagine if the squirrel had a book, telling him how to catch the acorn, or the acorn had a book telling him the best ways to stay with the squirrel. The world would be a better place.”
Their relationship hadn’t started happily. He’d been against Sam, but getting to know him –both through Dean and his own ‘looking in’ on the brothers– showed him that Sam has many sides. They’ve grown especially close in the past few years, they share things other than their love for Dean. They both enjoy research and helping people. The countless hours they’d spent together in the library, pouring through lore and research, were happy memories.
“You…” being in such proximity to Cass’ boner makes him a tad uncomfortable, but Dean reminds himself that it would just be a few more minutes. “Watched it right?”
He cracks the door open and glares at Sam. “You little bitch.” He marches away. “Do you see me complaining about the lettuce I keep finding everywhere?”
To come? On Dean’s bed?
Castiel finds his own lips tipping upward and his grace swell.
“Dean, I –”
The Shadow turns to look at Chuck, who stiffens with the attention. He smiles and wordlessly turns back to Castiel.
offer himself as a source of solace to a thoroughly useless, human, Castiel.
(See the end of the chapter for
for beta reading this chapter!
He heads out the next day with the intention to win.
"You don't know what you're saying."
“Shut up.” He snaps. “Mom, I was going to fill you in as soon as you woke up.”
Dean breathes harshly, trembling from the potent shot of truth.
Sam sighs. “I’m literally telling you that it does.” He says blandly.
The panic in Cass’ voice is enough to wake him completely.
He’s been silent for most of their stay. Cass tells him that the box has a power dampener which is why he needs to sleep now.
“So are you,” Dean says evenly.
Castiel steps out into the living area, his eyes immediately searching for Dean. All he finds is furniture and cutlery.
“I know you can little buddy.”
“Not even a little.” Cass growls.
He’s withdrawn from them completely and any attempt by either Sam or himself has led to flat out refusal. Dean can only assume that he’s still mad about their… incident. But whenever he tries to have a conversation, Cass brushes him off. He can barely stand Dean’s presence for more than a few seconds and seems to drift off into space sometimes.
“Sure thing hun.” She scribbles their order on her note pad, pausing only once to peer at them over the edge, “You guys are an adorable couple.”
“You know what… gimme a sec and we’ll head to the Impala.” Dean says cheerily. “Our first brate!”
The faintest spark of hope ignites. “Good.”
While Chuck sighs in satisfaction, Castiel’s mind is racing. He has to save them. He has to fix this.
With bleary eyes he tries to focus on something. To find Dean. His hands scrape against the dirty floor, trying to find purchase on something. His mind is functioning clearly, despite his body’s malfunctions. Castiel knows that it’s the after-effects of Lucifer’s simulation.
Cass runs up to Sam, his eyes fraught with urgency.
“And you don’t know how I feel.” Sam whispers. “My brother has betrayed me for a monster.”
“Okay,” Sam says, wondering if there’s a way he can
It should freak him out. It
“I thought you enjoyed your memory foam.”
“And I’m a barrel of roses.” Crowley retorts.
Dean blushes.
“Not that I can tell.”
He hears Dean laugh and he falters on his final step into the room. Aziaphale, though, doesn’t pick up on his indecision and barrels into him, sending them both sprawling into the room.
“Cass wait.”
Sam pulls the car around the front, glancing around for Cass. It feels strange driving something other than Baby and it feels even stranger that it’s just him and Cass alone.
Fingers slipping off the rake, Dean jogs forward. He pauses directly in front of Castiel, his eyes darting across his features, searching for… something. Dean licks his lips, raising his hand hesitantly. Fingers ghost across his cheek, along with a surprised breath from Dean.
“I’m collecting the books.” Crowley sasses. “I’m here because I enjoy the accommodation.” He tugs playfully at his chains. “Really top-notch service you boys give here. I brought along Juliette because I thought you’d like her. And I’m not
That’s when light engulfs the room, momentarily blinding them all.
The bunker has no glue, but Castiel finds a way to use what cheese they have as a sort of paste. It feels strange on his fingers, but it holds the macaroni in place… generally. The macaroni breaks when he presses it too hard though, so he has to be gentle. The drawing is simple, but he thinks it’s something that Dean will enjoy greatly… a pie!
“Are you nervous?” Cass asks as they climb into the Impala. Bet your ass he’s nervous. He almost forgot the keys… now that would have been awkward.
“You do remember our time together Dean?” he asks.
“The pouty face only works for Sammy.”
with this pest. “In a bookstore?”
“Just help me carry this back to the car.” He says marching away.
Throwing the door open he marches down the stairs and grabs a silver knife from the kitchen, thinking back at it’s refusal to even touch one earlier.
Once more, he lets his eyes slip shut, his hand moving in full strokes across his dick. He bites down on his lip as he feels himself get closer. His hips move of their own accord and the muscles in his legs tremble with pleasure. His balls pull up, in preparation to spill his load.
Crowley just hums at him and turns back to his book.
Cass chimes in, apparently forgetting his phone for the while. “I found it.” he proudly holds up the ratty notebook and Dean can’t help but share his smile.
“I’m sorry.” The words feel paltry. But it’s the most he can offer.
“What’s on your mind Dean?” he asks simply.
“There’s no bullshit.” He points out. “I just don’t want you to faint and crack your skull open.”
“I know. But I’m here to help and you boys were drowning in dirty laundry.”
He doesn’t say a word, preferring to indulge in his pie and glance around the fancy restaurant. There’s chandeliers on the ceiling and a piano off to the side. There’s even a platform where a few patrons sit. What catches his eye is the contrast between the two men closest to the edge. One wears a hideous white contraption that looks to be about forty years old but is somehow not falling apart at the seams. His hair is completely white and him and the other man across from him are talking animatedly and laughing raucously.
Castiel mixes the water first and pours in some bubble bath. He wants to check in the mirror again but fear stops him every time he gets close. Mirror? No, full bathtub. Mirror? No, urination. Mirror? No, brush your teeth. Mirror? No, no.
Hmm. That’s a good one. Dean wanted him to shut up cause he kept asking questions that annoyed him. No, they didn’t so much annoy him as make him unbearable uncomfortable. But why is that? And what had possessed him to kiss Cass out of the blue like that.
Castiel indulges Dean for a bit, letting him rut against his thigh only to stop just as he was close. Then he once more wrapped his lips around Dean. His member throbbing wildly in Castiel’s mouth, jerking slightly with every brush of his tongue. Dean’s pre-come leaks freely, leaving a saline taste on the back of Castiel’s throat. The molecules taste like Dean. Once more, Dean pulls away when he feels himself nearing an orgasm, bracing his hands against the wall and screwing his eyes shut harshly. His cock is flushed and swollen, more red than pink now really.
His brain taunts. He wants to tell it to shut up, but the countless years of monsters making snide remarks about them refuse to be silenced. Even Sam, on occasion would take a jab at them. But… Dean never put any stock into it. Cass never seemed to have any reaction whatsoever.  Dean doesn’t know how he can keep living in a world where Cass is in love with him.
“Some people find men who get dirty to be quite attractive.” Dean comments. “When I’m through mentoring you… you should definitely use that to score some points with the fine ladies and gents of the planet earth.”
“Why won’t he let you go?”
Instantly, their weapons are drawn and they’re on their feet. The only person who should be outside is Cass, but Michael might have suddenly decided he likes to destroy again. Either way, they need to get to Baby. She’s the quickest way out of here. Cass had already carted most of their resources into her trunk and backseats. They can just abandon the rest if push comes to shove.
“Just, y’know.” Dean glances around, as if looking for someone out in the woods. “I brought some bubble bath. I’m going to soak for a bit. Later – if – if you want, you can have some.”
Hmm… Baby.
“I’ve studied extensively.” Cass assures him. “I practiced on a banana but I was unable to gauge it’s level of satisfaction after the tip almost broke off in my mouth. I’d have died if I were human.”
To have all the rumours finally put to rest.
“I’m sorry.” Dean strokes the angel’s hair, “For everything.”
But Sam knows different.
“How?”
Then remain in companionable silence for a few moments. Which is enough time for Sam to fully absorb the weight of what has been said.
Sam just needs to find a way to put his failure into words.
Either way, he ain’t sleeping with some random dude. He’s not sleeping with any dude at all. Well, apparently, some versions of him enjoy sleeping with Cass, but those other universes have no standing.
“You’re one to talk.”
Before, when he just thought that they kept him around for the heck of it, he’d been stingy with his opinions, not wanting to be put more at odds with Dean than he already was. Now though, things could be more open between them from here on out.
Sam left, just a few minutes ago. Shocked out of his wits that Dean hadn’t ripped into him for messing up their plan. Even Castiel had been surprised at that; he’d been angry too. Dean had been angry as well, he could feel it rolling off his skin.
“Okay.” He breathes, “We’ve got it all out in the open.” He moves his hand and it gravitates towards Castiel’s shoulder; the friendly pat that had always done wonders for him, but pulls back at the last second. “So what you’re saying is… you can be happy… to an extent. He won’t take you as long as you don’t forget.”
“Y-e-es De-dean.”
It’s almost too much, Cass lips wrapping around his sensitive cock. The taboo of it all makes it even hotter. Cass is his best friend. His
Castiel blocks out Aziraphale’s response as he marches over to Dean. “Are you stupid?”
“Ooh Cass!” he looks excitedly at the menu, “Cheesecake.”
“Of course not,” says Sam, thoroughly offended. “I’m not a barbarian.”
What? Castiel’s eyes dart back and forth in confusion. “You need me.” he breathes in realisation. “To keep the lights on.”
Dean lets that sentence trail off. It’s like Sam said, he
No reaction.
Dean rolls his eyes as though Sam is over-reacting. “Hide and seek.” He says simply and continues on his path.
“Let’s try something more comfortable then.” Suggests Cass. “Lie on your back.”
Right. Cass is still here.
Dewy green eyes stare at him, “Because I’ve missed you. Because you’re the only one I can trust to always be there for me.”
This world reminds him of the last. Quiet and peaceful, with a deadly undertone and…
“You don’t like the coat?”
His arms remain trapped at his side and Dean doesn’t seem to want to end their embrace.
Castiel stabs the other Dean immediately, smiling as he falls to the ground, his mouth gaping like a fish.
“But it was.” He says, haunted. “I drove him away. I told him-” he breaks off, breathing harshly, his eyes are locked onto their Cass. “Well, you know what.”
When Cass breaks free of their embrace, his eyes land on Dean and they dim.
“Let’s be real Dean.” Cass says drily. “My powers are no longer what they used to be. I’m more useful to Sam in the gardening, healing the plants when he forgot to water them than I am to you in battle.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ruling was so… boring! The most fun I’ve had is lying upside down on my throne.”
“Good,” Dean says crisply. “Night, Sammy.” The hug that Dean pulls him in for is fierce; a testament to how shaken up he is.
“You need -?” He breaks off as he finds Dean and Cass locked into an epic stare down.
“What good would that do?” he spends so much time with Cass between the sheets now that he’s barely communicated with Sam in any sort of meaningful way. But now that he’s started ‘communicating again’ he can’t help but start babbling. “If Cass and I go out together, then it would be like a date. But if you’re there, it’s more like a group meeting!”
He sighs, “We never know Cass. That’s the risk we have to take.”
“Can you close the curtain?” he bites out.
One problem still remains.
Maybe that’s why he had insisted that Cass think it over.
“Then I’ll just have to be very convincing then.” His hand drifts under the blanket, cupping Dean’s morning wood in his hands. Castiel feels so much more confident about touching Dean, now that he’s learned the ins and outs of his body. The power of knowing just how to bring Dean apart with his own two hands is exhilarating.
She rolls her eyes. “I know that.” She deadpans.  “I need to get a read of the energy from your world. I need to hold onto it and craft a pathway through the multiverse. One misstep and you two wind up on a world with three moons and an army of big foots.”
Please don't kill me when you figure out what the huge, red things that Cass is freaking out about are.
He rolls his eyes.
“I wish -”
The man in black laughs and removes the shades to wipe at his eyes. It’s only for a second, but it’s enough for Dean to realise what they’re dealing with.
Dean chuckles. “Have I ever done anything to make you doubt that I’m happy?”
“How long was I like that?” his voice is small. No longer does he have that child life innocence, the kind, soft spoken voice that bespeaks a sheltered life.
Cass looks at him, incredulous, “Dean! This is Crowley!”
“If you go and then you come back… you can stay.” Dean says slowly, hating the words leaving his mouth. But he needs to be smart this time. Protect himself and his heart. “But it won’t the same between us.”
“I know,” Dean says bitterly. “I remember. But I hoped…”
After a long and tiring day of babysitting, Sam finally deposits Dean and Cass into the two cribs that Jody bought for them. To say he’s just about ready to hit the hay is an understatement. But, the thing is, he can’t even do that. He has to research. He has to know everything possible about the pearl before breaking it. He has to find out if it really did break the first time and just reformed and he has to find out what Cass’ wish was – and Dean’s too.
Paling, Cass pulls a seat next to him. “What do you mean… negative?”
Cass fidgets, rubbing his hands together. “I’ve been lying to you.”
“I’m sorry too for any distress I may have caused.” Cass murmurs, his voice laced with regret.
This conversation has been emotionally taxing. He’s about ready to retire from brother-angel therapy. Sam is ready for this to be
Sam and Dean argue loudly and viciously, with no regard for the people between them. Namely Dean, who is literally between them. He only hears their argument as background noise. His head is swirling with panic. They need to get out of this world pronto.
Dean rolls his eyes, “Jealous?”
Dean looks up at him, and once again, Sam gets the impression that he’s hiding something.
Dean awkwardly lets him in, closing the door behind them.
“Tell me how you really feel.” He mutters. They should regroup with Sam and Mom at the motel but… “I’ve got some stuff to pick up.” Says Dean, “You  might actually be able to help me with it.”
Dean laughs wryly, “I slipped in that friggin’ mud!” he huffs, “I told you Cass I don’t do gardening.”
He teleports away, satisfied with his quip, but utterly peeved that he hadn’t had a chance to eat. Sam’s blood had been nice, but he was slowly purified by the ritual, leaving his blood… mundane. Dean on the other hand; well his blood has a tinge of hell, a splash of angel and a sprinkling of purgatory.
“Do I have to remind you how old I am?”
“I don’t need you. I never have!”
“I pick…” Cass forces the next word out against every instinct in his body. “Sam.” The words feel final.
“It’s selfish too.” Dee argues. “I want her to be with me. To touch and kiss and feel.”
“It’s not really anything, you know?” Dean explains. “But life on the road. It’s left me with some fantasies that I’ve always wanted to play out. I mean, I’ll just imagine you as a chick to make it easier but still.”
“Do you two want a minute alone?” Sam asks. He receives a disgruntled and somewhat confused look from Dean.
All that time away, he stuck to calming things. Like hunting witches or rogue angels. He hadn’t sought out shifters or djinn. When he suspected their presence, he had quickly passed the case onto another hunter. Sam and Dean may have actually done some of those cases unknowingly.
“I-” Cass looks over to him. The same, almost nauseous look on his face. “I don’t - ”
“Temporary team mate.” He retorts.
So enjoy and go bananas!! (as we hope Cass will)
“W-t about you Cass? Everything’s okay with you?”
The weight in his hand disappears suddenly. Sam glances up in panic. “Crowley. Just tell me.”
“Yes Dean. It was a bomb.” Cass enunciates, glaring at him.
Dean can’t see in the darkness.
“When it touched my grace I knew we would be bound forever. That I would never forsake it not it me. And in the moment of our bonding, this thing – this untameable beauty shared itself with me, offering me enough energy to save me. To help me escape. It didn’t know that I would save it or kill it. But it offered a lifeline to me anyway. I could never have left it behind so flew – I raised it – with a tight grip – out of perdition. It’s light shone like a beacon the entire way up and seemed to glow brighter in encouragement whenever I seemed to falter. When we broke the surface it glowed even brighter, congratulating me and it dimmed ever so slightly upon our parting that I wanted to wrap my grace around it forever and never let it go.
“Because I have to set certain things right, so that I can stay with you for a lifetime and more.” Cass doesn’t sound happy about it.
He feels the on-set of a headache. “You have to relax. I don’t know how else to help you.”
Scowling, Dean crosses his arms defiantly, “Friggin’ Sam.” He mutters, “Look, I don’t know what the hell’s wrong with him but I’ll figure this out. Okay?”
“Death never do us part.”
“Dean…”
Worst of all… Castiel might have actually
Crowley looks bewildered. “This?” He raises the book with a tiny grin. “This is just something I picked up on my way over. Did you want one?”
When he brings his fist down, Cass moans at the sensation, his hands wringing at the sheets.
All Dean needs to do is look at Cass’ guilty expression to get his answer.
Cass smiles gently. “I know.” A pause. “Deanpie.”
It’s progress.
Cass’ expression is pinched as he mulls over Sam’s words. It’s nice to know that he could help at least and take some of the pressure off.
Slowly, reluctantly he steps through the underbrush surrounding the bunker lost in his thoughts the times where he had felt accepted and included in the Winchester’s family and the times he had ruined their relationship.
Cass’ face falls and Sam almost feels bad. They took one day off in years to relax. But this thing could have killed them while they were lost in their own heads.
“Do you forgive me Dean?” Cass asks in a small voice.
“Well, after the ‘mutual masturbation’ my sheets were in need of a rinse.”
Michael remains silent. “You’ve given a lot to me. I can give you this.” Adam would understand his hesitance once he reveals the secret.
That. That has Dean’s interest. “Isn’t that like blasphemy for demons?”
He knows that if he asks, Cass won’t say no to him.
But this Dean doesn’t.
He remains silent. Of course he enjoys time spent with Dean. It’s the highlight of his long existence.
Cass frowns, crossing his arms. “Dean.”
Cass then turns and pours him a cup of coffee, resting the steaming mug into his hands before pressing a sweet kiss to the side of his mouth.
Castiel keeps quiet. He hadn’t given much thought to his love confession. But now he can’t help but quietly panic. Dean obviously held no interest in him. Another reason to believe he was indeed real. It should be easy… to slip back into the role of Dean’s friend – and closest confidant, as he likes to think – but it’s not. Not when he spent what felt like years in an endless loop of falling in love and dismissal. No matter how harsh the rebuttal at the end, he had always cherished every bit of attention that Dean gave him. It was the only thing he’d selfishly indulged in. He’d felt guilty over it but he always tried to savour the moments before he was cruelly cast aside.
“About grown up stuff?” Dean asks, pouting.
Sam cocks his head. “Hey, do you want to join us i-”
Can anyone figure out what Cass' infamous plan is? ;D
He doesn’t reply. Squaring his shoulders he pins Dean to the wall behind them.
She lets out a harsh breath, using one hand to brush through her soft hair.
Dean blinks in confusion. “We don’t have time for this.”
“Did Dean talk to you?”
Castiel perks up on his arrival. He hadn’t been gone long enough for an sexual relations to occur. “Did you get the pie?” he asks.
Dean lies sprawled out on his bed. His mind of completely fogged over. The ceiling looks like cotton candy and lollipops – like that Katy Perry video.
If you'd prefer reading the (I want to say happier but it's not) less depressing version you can find it here:
Cass pauses at that. “Dean…”
Sam insists on evacuating the bunker. Despite Michael being so placid, they can’t risk him snapping and killing everyone in the room. Only Sam, Mary, and Cass remain. Bobby is herding the other hunters to a safe house. At least he doesn’t have to worry about getting them killed.
Sam hates to be that guy, but it has to be said. “He doesn’t have teeth. How’s he going to eat pie?”
Crowley’s always been pretty sneaky, but the fact that he showed them the book from the get-go says that he doesn’t feel the need to hide. He feels so secure in whatever evil master plan he has for breaking up Dean and Cass that he thinks he can
“It was supposed to distract you.” Dean reminds him, his own voice wavering. He doesn’t want to talk about this.
The words come to mind at this moment. There’s something enticing about the way Cass writhes on his bed – under his hand.
“What?” Dean seems annoyed.
“Is there a good reason you aren’t telling me?” His eyes shine with the hurt that Dean, for once, doesn’t try to cover with wrath.
Dean is sitting on the shower floor, under the spray when the door opens.
“When I think it’s time.” Michael replies in that gratingly aloof tone.
“That’s enough,” Chuck snaps his fingers and tape appears on Winchester's mouths.
The bubble.
“I’m sorry.” He repeats. But it sounds hollow to his ears.
“Maybe you should give me a nick name too.” Dean suggests, sounding excited at the prospect.
“Dean, are we really just … going?”
“What?” Dean demands instantly.
Opening his eyes to realise that Cass had turned the lights down… the fear that he had abandoned him. But Cass had stayed. He always stays.
Most of all he feels guilty.
It doesn’t feel fair to read it now. It’s like a ‘cheat sheet’ to Dean.
didn’t have sex!” he almost wants to take it back the moment he says it. It sounds jealous… revealing.
“Okay.” Jody says, all business now. Sam feels some of his worry dissipate. Jody will help him fix this. Dean will be back. “We’ll do one last sweep of this place then we’ll get to work on scouring the earth for a Winchester and an angel.”
“But sometimes it’s hard for me too.” he whispers, as though sharing as secret, “All my life I’ve always done three things: taken care of Sammy, gone hunting and slept with women. Now – now I’m doing none of those things. Sometimes I wonder if this is real. Us. This place. And it’s hard because I don’t know what you want.”
is doing the blowing. But Cass blew him just fine.
Drumming his fingers against the wheel, he considers it. Cass is back. He hasn't reached out. Jack is out reforming heaven or whatever so the angel is probably swamped, helping him or whatever.
He holds up his lock pick with a smirk, “Break into the file room.”
“Because… everyone keeps telling me that you’re in love with me!” he yells. “That I’m in love with you!” he lets out a harsh breath. “It’s getting to me man! I don’t know what I feel. And I was going to talk to you and I found the box… so I just figured. If you cared, it’d be in there and then I’d know if I was going to make a fool of myself.”
He can’t hear the words himself.
A blinding flash of light interrupts him. Sam blinks the brightness away to find the archangels have disappeared.
to his best friend.
Castiel should feel the same way, but he doesn’t.
“You have one.” He whispers, making sure to keep his voice low so that Crowley and Cass don’t hear him.
Cass turns to Sam next pointing at the bee, “Sam, I want bee.” He says, pressing his face into the bars and sticking his lip out.
A moment of unending understanding; devoid of judgement and selfishness. With his sweet kiss, Dean lets him know that it’s okay if they don’t go through with this.
First it had been Dean saying that the other Castiel kissed him, then Dean saying that the other Castiel thought that
“What’s going on?” he asks in a daze. He knows exactly what’s happening. Its déjà vu. Except this time it’s not Dean’s face he has to stare at; it’s Sam’s.
“We’re good.” Dean says. But as his vision becomes clearer, he sees the splotches on Dean’s face. The blood coating Sam’s hair. Sam looks to be delirious from the pain, his lips moving as he mutters some unknown words to himself.
“Don’t say it like that.” Dean protests, taking his anger out on his pork. The purpose of this dinner is to make Sam
There’s a jolt when they join hands with Anathema. Almost like a mini sonic boom.
If he says it, he doesn’t know what it means for Cass… for Dean.
He rushes to the kitchen, his eyes zeroing in on pearl on the ground.
“Why?” Sam asks, trying to deter the idea. He doesn’t really trust Dean to be a stern authority figure with Cass. He’s allowed him to run wild the majority of the time. Eating pie and sipping bourbon ‘to help with his teeth pain.’ Dean let him turn the pot of soup. Sam almost died in place during that one. Seeing Cass balanced on Dean’s knee, just over a pot of boiling liquid hadn’t been a nice sight.
“I’m going to… gouge my eyes out… fall onto an angel blade… maybe even sell myself to the devil.” He mutters, “Please don’t carry on in my absence. Mother,” he gives her a poined look, “I expect you to take a vow of chastity after my death. Fifty years or so would do.”
“Sure.” He says. He’s blown all the other rules to hell anyway. It was only a matter of time before this one came crashing down too.
“I was under the impression we could use it while alone,”
“No.” Cass says sternly. “The prayer would always reach him, the only thing that could be stopping him from hearing is either him dying or something else constantly talking in his ear.”
If the brilliant smile on Cass’ face is anything to go by, then, that actually happened.
But now that it’s about to end he feels lost.
Sam rolls his eyes. “The pizza man,” Sam says sarcastically.
“Close your eyes.” He repeats as he mentally psyches himself up for the vault he’s about to take. He’s about to cross over about a dozen lines.
“I thought you would want me to find a new vessel.”
for beta reading this chapter... and making sure Sam got the most out of his seven minutes in hell
for beta reading this chapter!
Past a bushel of trees is a clearing and Dean can just make out the slight shimmering of water beyond it.
“Cass… what’s there to say. It probably felt just like yours.”
“But-”
“Is Dean going to die?”
Logical.
“Dean.” He snaps the light on.
the instructions
One look up at Castiel tells him that he knows it too.
Oh God.
“Silence.” Dean says. He doesn’t shout or raise his voice, but the command is clear and Castiel is helpless against it. Castiel backs down instantly, as though it would short circuit his programming to do otherwise. He’s forced to watch numbly as Dean exits the room with a bottle of red wine in his left hand.
“Oh.” Crowley sounds horrified. “I forgot. Reach into my coat. Feel free to grope.”
“I feel like I’m so tired. Like I’m about to melt into the floor.” He feels woozy just talking. “And – and it’s so confining in here. I can’t breathe. Someone tell Dean that his plants aren’t working. They need to grow better and learn how to photosynthesise.”
“Why are you here?” he hisses.
Nothing happens.
This is the ending they never thought would come to pass.
He carefully stands, his stomach churning as the water displaces. How can anyone stand to sleep in such a death trap?
They can be as loud as they please.
“So you’re… not mad?”
“Oh my God!” he moans past the food in his mouth. Believe it or not, Cass brought them mini-burgers as appetisers. “I love this. You’re like the best cook ever!”
He frowns. “Me. Of course.”
I wonder who is following them... 00
Cass smiles and Dean notices almost instantly, fake pouting at him. “You’re supposed to be on my side.” He whines.
For the umpteenth time, Sam thinks that this whole process would be that much easier if he could actually see Cass.
Half an hour passes before he trusts himself to speak.
“You can’t leave.” Sam says.
“You don’t forget the pie.”
“And who told you the babysitter was a girl?”
“Man, you’re okay.” Dean says in a rush, pulling him in for a quick hug.
It’s not fair to expect him at Dean’s beck and call, especially in the eleventh hour when Cass has his own things to do and his own emotions of stow before the big fight.
“Of course I remember the words Cass.”
“I hate this.” Cass hisses. “Seeing you like this. You have a way out Dean. Everyone is probably dead now. There’ll be no one left for Michael to kill.”
Some things to note about this chapter:
Dean’s room is locked, he’s no doubt sulking or talking to mom, he isn’t sure which. Next, he heads to Cass’ room. Thankfully, the door is open.
anywhere.
Thank you for your patience! Hope you enjoy!
In her presence Dean should have only felt overwhelming peace and attraction.
“What?”
Dean swallows. Low blow, but he deserves it.
It’s pretty nice being high all the time.
Almost as though in sync with his emotions, the sky opens up. Rain pours all around then, drenching them. Drenching the work bench. The Ma’lak box.
“Here’s your tickets.” The lady pushes two slips of paper into their hands, grinning at them strangely. Dean hardly feels it between his fingers as he starts to panic.
“I do have a question though.” Sam says, seeming genuinely curious.
“NO!” Dee screeches.
The angel holds up a hand, stopping him. “Dean, there really is no need.” He assures. “I remember what you told me about porn. I assume the same applies here.”
So he prays. Prays to his father… to Chuck…
Dean lies on his bed with his head near the headboard and Sam’s sock covered feet rest near his head. A position they’ve both grown accustomed to. Thankfully Sam showered just a few minutes ago, so he doesn’t have to deal with the stench of his lettuce infested toe-jam.
Gabriel grinds down causing Crowley to snap his hips up, desperate for some friction. “Feels alright to me.”
“Don’t get your panties in a twist. Just call me if she wants a threesome.”
“Dean.” He squints, “In my professional opinion, after many years of being a healer, I recommend aromatherapy.”
“It’s not an it Sam.” Dean says with finality.
“Dean.” He whispers, scandalised, “I never knew you fancied the elderly.”
Some of his worries had been dissipated earlier when Dean told him that he cares. He knows the older Winchester well enough to tell when he’s lying and that – that had been
Despite Dean opening up about why he didn’t want him to leave, despite knowing how much it would hurt him… Castiel still left.
A good brother would say something, he decides.
“Remember.” Coaches Dean, “You make an excuse to use the bathroom and search the place. Look for anything our ghost might be attached to.”
Sam smiles, but his mood is dampened by the fact that things
Flushing in embarrassment, all he wants to do is turn away from Dean, but he nods nonetheless.
“Um. Okay.” Sam offers him a weak smile while letting Dean lean most of his weight on his shoulder.
“Like I said,” says Crowley, lifting the cover to show him the title. “I love a good love story.”
“Cass!” a voice crackles through the speakers it sounds beyond rough and distorted but Castiel would know that voice anywhere.
He’s right, he realises in horror. He’s already at the box when Cass is still feet away.
“Do –”
The first brush of Dean’s lips against his short-circuits his brain. He can do little but gasp and arch into the touch. Dean complies pressing his lips firmly against Castiel in a way that makes his knees tremble.
“Mmh what would I do without you?” he teases lightly.
He nods.
“You have Sam.”
“You guys were kissing in there?”
“There’s something I’ve always wanted to know… so I’ll give you a chance to save them.” Chuck raises one finger then. “One of them.”
to like.”
“Do you think that I– that I do things that make it seem like I’m in love with him?” Dean ignores his question completely.
Now that shocks some life back into him. “Wow. You have the magic cure of a limp dick.”
, Dean’s body stops shuddering and his breath gusts out in shallow pants. It takes everything Sam has, to swallow his questions and not demand answers immediately.
“Dean?” Castiel draws the phone away slowly staring at its black screen:
“I – wasn’t. I wasn’t leaving Dean.” Cass says with a heavy sigh. “Just answer one question.”
“Offered to make it threesome myself, but our dear Dean seems quite adverse to the idea. Doubt you’ll have much better luck feathers.”
He checks the engravings, the warding and finally the locks. Everything seems to be in order.
That isn’t the word he wants to say but for now, it will have to do. Maybe one day he can tell Dean all the words he really wants to say. But for now, he’s happy with this.
“So if Sam known then he’ll think that either we’re in love or that what we’re doing is unhealthy?” Cass confirms, seeming put-off by either possibility.
For the first time Dean thinks that there’s actually some merit to Crowley’s whole shtick. He looks… rumpled. No fancy suit and shoes. The beard is almost longer than his hair. If it wasn’t for the attitude he’d be practically unrecognisable. Dean’s a fool for even thinking of trusting him. But then again, what’s new?
