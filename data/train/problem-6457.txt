I’ll try my absolute best to update soon! I have plans for them and their future baby 😉
“I’m not there yet. Unless that’s what you’re implying. That is what you’re implying, isn’t it?”
Tony huffs out a small laugh. “You know you seem to know a lot about me already.”
Tony doesn’t even pick up the rest of what the kid is saying. He can see his lips moving and his hands making these excited gestures, but he can’t focus on the words. The kid loves to talk.
“Steve, I can’t-” Tony stops himself when worry flashes across his husband’s face. Damn it. He couldn’t stand upsetting Steve. Not when he was so happy about the baby. Tony sighs and says, “I can’t wait.”
Steve smiles and glances down to quickly wipe the tears that escape. For the first time in a long time, he had control over his body. It was an incredible feeling knowing that the strings had been cut and he was finally free. He was nobody’s puppet. Not anymore.
“I thought I was dead,” Steve eventually says, the frown on his face deepening. “The base-”
Bucky sighs. “I’m sorry. I know this is the last thing you need but…”
Peter is calmer now, the tears in his eyes drying up and the frown on his face disappearing. Bucky smiles, feeling proud of himself for getting his nephew calm.
“In his room. He’s a good kid. Harley is…”
Steve’s smile falters and his eyes flutter. Peter knows what’s about to happen next and he lays his body over his papa’s, placing his head over Steve’s chest. He listens to the soft beating of his papa’s heart. He focuses on the way his papa’s fingers feel in his hair.
“Wait, kid-”
“Dad?”
So yeah I made Bruce that kind of doctor haha. Also I think Pierce is starting to catch on....not good.
Peter was sure he’d be glad to be back at the compound, but the moment he steps inside, his eyes fill with tears and his legs threaten to give out. If not for his aunt he’d probably be on the floor.
Was there even a baby?
It’s that reminder that has him turning his frown upside down. Steve was ecstatic about the shower and celebrating their son. Tony could understand why his husband was acting the way he was. A family was another thing Steve thought he needed to sacrifice. The least Tony could do was give him a child.
He could have a baby, and he could do it alone. His mother did it and he turned out just fine. He didn’t need Tony for this.
Peter grimaces again when his dad chugs most of it. “Is it good at least?”
Tony stirs in his sleep, a small moan slipping past his lips when Steve continues to trail his lips along his jaw and down to his neck. Steve smirks against his neck and bites, not too hard, but enough to leave a red mark on the unblemished skin.
“Emergency medical is on the way,” FRIDAY replies.
Ah revenge. It’s going to be wonderful 😈
“Steve-”
“It’s just for a little while okay, sweetheart? I’ll be out of here soon and back home with you and daddy. Go easy on him okay? I love you so much, and I promise I’m going to do everything I can to get better because I want to be there for every milestone. I’m going to miss you so much. Don’t forget about me.” Steve leans down to press a kiss to Morgan’s head, letting his lips linger for a while.
“Steve-”
“Steve, give her to me.”
Peter does as he’s told, collapsing back in his seat. He watches anxiously as his papa is led to the medical table and laid down on the steel surface. The space breaks out in a flurry of activity and the view of his father is lost. He can still hear his family talking among themselves, asking each other questions, completely forgetting that he was there.
Steve takes a shaky breath. “He was the first one to test me out. After they thawed me from the ice, he wanted to see if I was still fertile. I was.”
“A hologram?”
Don’t worry about Peter...he might be changing his mind 😉
It’s Bruce who places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and they share a sad smile. Tears prick the corners of Tony’s eye, but he doesn’t let them fall. He’d cry when he was alone and safe in his penthouse.
“Get him checked out, Doc,” Tony says.
Bucky’s eyes fill with tears and he turns away to hide them. “Shit,” he mutters and wipes quickly at his eyes. “Damn hormones.”
The room falls silent. Sam immediately lets Bucky go, eyes wide. Even Peter and Alpine have their full attention on Bucky.
Peter says his goodbyes and touches the shield, then he follows the trail back to the car. His dad is already inside, eyes looking straight ahead and fingers wrapped tightly around the steering wheel. Even with his sunglasses on Peter can tell he had been crying. The wet tracks on his face couldn’t be hidden by expensive shades.
Tony sighs. “I hope you’re right.”
I hope you all enjoy this update! 😊
Steve smiles sympathetically. “I know. The medical staff here are good. We’re safe, Tony.”
“Maguna!” He cries and jumps off the couch to greet her. Morgan sighs in annoyance. That was her dad’s nickname for her but Harley loved to steal it from time to time.
Steve whimpers and buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent. The twinges in his belly start up again and he cries out. He’s been through this before, during all of his pregnancies. False labor was supposed to be harmless; just the body’s way to prepare for the real thing, but this felt wrong. The pain was too great. He didn’t want to think the worst, but he can’t help but worry that he would lose another pup.
“Is he? Tony, I’m still scared,” Steve admits. “I swear I’m trying not to be but I am. I belonged to him and he’s not going to give up so easily. He wants me. He wants our baby.”
“Guess it finally worked,” Tony says and he lies back on the bed with a huff. “I’m exhausted.”
“Yeah, well, you’d do the same thing if this stranger shows up claiming they know you and they were having your pup.”
“All of this is weird!” Happy hisses.
“Buck, calm down,” Sam has to fight the urge to laugh. He wasn’t used to seeing his husband like this. Bucky was usually quiet and refrained from lashing out. But lately he was acting out, especially when it came to their nephew and his tardiness.
“You, too, Pep.”
By the time the argument has simmered down, the whole family gathers around the table to eat. The tension is still high between her parents. Peter and her show a knowing look; she shrugs in response and turns back to her dinner.
“Yep. Fine. Back still hurts like a bi-” One stern look from Steve has Tony pausing and rethinking his last word. “I’m good. Real good.”
Tony doesn’t hesitate to comply. He’s gentle when he prepares Steve, more so than he’s ever been. He takes his time, making sure Steve is properly stretched before sliding the condom on and positioning himself at Steve’s entrance.
“Hon-”
He blames himself.
“How are you feeling?” Bruce asks as he feels around Steve’s throat, his touch gentle when he reaches the bond mark. He notes the bruises around the mark, but again doesn’t ask.
Peter watches as his father leaves, an idea beginning to form.
Or baby Stark.
Steve smiles to himself and curls up closer to Tony, enjoying the warmth and comfort he brings. He wishes things could stay like this, but eventually Tony was going to leave and he’d have to figure out how to do this alone.
Steve huffs and rolls his eyes. “Sometimes.
“Morning,” Steve mutters, deciding to be the civil one. Tony doesn’t reply at first and he takes another sip from his mug.
Peter goes ignored when Tony turns away from him and starts making his way toward the doors. Peter tries to follow after him, but he’s forced to stop when his dad turns around again to face him.
“That night at the party…”
Peter was right. It should have been Tony.
“I still like the name Benjamin…”
“Peter, talk to me. We need to work this out.”
“It should! Peter’s just a kid!”
Tony smirks. “Jealous?”
Steve’s face shows up on the monitors. The photo is a few years old, dating back to when Tony had been on speaking terms with him. His heart still clenches painfully at the sight of Steve’s face. It also brings anger, confusion, regret.
“H-hey, Spider-Man.”
He goes completely numb.
He’s forced to stop struggling when an electrifying shock shoots through him. Steve screams and his movements cease. The alpha on his right doesn’t stop and he issues another shock with his stun baton until he’s sure the omega has stopped fighting for good.
Steve is already home by the time Tony gets back. He’s seated on the couch with Morgan in his arms, a bright smile on his face as he talks to her. Steve glances up when he hears Tony come in, his smile growing wider.
But when Peter makes it back, he’s immediately greeted by a different scene. His uncle Sam and Bruce are there, talking about something Peter doesn’t understand. Their conversation dies suddenly and all eyes fall on him.
“I guess this doesn’t involve us,” Pepper says and gestures for Happy to follow her out. She shoots Tony a warning look before leaving the lab.
Tony chuckles. “Nah. I’m sure Happy can pick us up something else.”
Steve nods. “Thank you, Tony. For everything.”
“I’m here now, right? If it’s about stupid meetings and-”
Tony is careful when he does get Steve into the shower. The water is tinged pink when it mixes with the blood, it’s an unsettling sight, but nothing compared to what he had walked into before.
“Steve is fine. Is um Tony-er Mr. Stark around? He’s not still mad at me, is he?”
Tony ignores the looks of disappointment for him and threatening gazes for the poor omega. Steve has been oblivious to it all. The moment they stepped into the elevator to take them to Tony’s penthouse, he shut in on himself and refused to look at anyone other than the floor.
Well Steve is still in denial and stubborn as hell. Honestly at this point he probably won’t realize he’s pregnant until he’s giving birth 😆
“Pancakes!” Harley runs into the kitchen and takes a peek into the bowl of batter. He reaches into the bowl to scoop some to taste and Steve has to take the bowl away. “No fair. I wanted some!”
“Wait what?” Peter frowns, hating that he didn’t understand. “When?”
“Why the hell would I do that?” Tony doesn’t get a response. “Don’t worry okay? I’ll help you figure things out.”
Steve frowns. “Thank you?”
“Is that why you were late?” Peter gestures to the flowers.
“I’m sorry, but Mr. Stark is currently unavailable.” Comes Jarvis’ voice.
But was it his?
“No he didn’t give it to-wait, smell? Ew why do you care?”
Tony can’t bring himself to look in his son’s direction. Peter isn’t even looking at him anymore, his gaze is cast down. When he does look up, the sight of his tear filled eyes hurts more than the voicemail.
Steve’s curiosity and confusion only grows as they follow the trail and stop in the middle of a clearing. It’s not too far from the lake and surrounded by tall trees and luscious grass. Tony lets go of Steve’s hand and takes a few steps until he’s right in the center of the clearing.
“Fine,” he finally replies. His answer isn’t what Tony had been expecting. He thought Steve was going to express how much he loved the peace and quiet that came with his new home. But maybe it wasn’t all rainbows and butterflies behind these walls.
“Who’s it from?” Steve asks, brows furrowing slightly. Leave it to Tony to ignore the name printed on the tag and go straight for the contents inside the bag. Tony doesn’t respond, too busy taking out a package of bottles and a bottle cleaning kit.
“I don’t think that’s how that goes…”
Steve’s eyes flicker up to Tony’s face, smiling softly at him. He doesn’t want to wake him just yet, knowing that Tony was losing out on sleep too. It was difficult for him to find a comfortable sleeping position these days.
Tony doesn't want to believe it, but maybe Pepper was right. So far she was the only one making sense.
It all happens so fast.
“I miss him so much.”
He can’t even focus on the new tech designs and he throws his tools down on the workbench. His eyes glance in the direction of the untouched glass of scotch. Turning to alcohol was something Tony needed working on, but it was his coping mechanism. That and working all night in his lab. And when he combined those two things...well, the outcome was never good. He’s lost count of how many times Pepper has scolded him.
“Say anything,” Ned finishes. “You’re really not going to tell your parents or Flash?”
“Yeah. She doesn’t mind him staying for a couple of hours.”
He signs the discharge papers, wishing he could spend at least one more day with his son. But he was needed back home. So much needed to be done before they could bring Peter home. A nursery wasn’t even built and they didn’t have all of the essentials a newborn was going to need. It was overwhelming.
Steve rolls his eyes playfully and leans down to peck Tony on the lips. Tony is quick to pull Steve back in for another kiss. Their moment is interrupted again, but this time Tony can’t find it in himself to be upset and he laughs.
Steve nods and takes another drink from his glass. “And you? What was Tony Stark like as a kid? You weren’t a snotty brat, were you?”
Peter shrugs in response.
“So you’re too busy to run
“Oh.” Tony’s face frowns. “At least it’s better than what I originally thought.”
“Yeah. Yeah, it is. I was sick when I was younger so knowing my son is okay is a huge relief.”
“I can’t do this,” he says to himself. He means the party, but deep down those words mean so much more. He can’t raise this baby alone. He can’t do it without Tony.
Peter smiles softly. “People make mistakes. I’m not mad...not really.”
“Fuck, honey. Don’t stop.” Tony’s hand flies down to grasp Steve’s head, fingers tugging on the blond strands. Steve grunts from the sting but doesn’t stop.
“He could hurt you and I can’t-Tony, I can’t let him hurt you again.”
Tony smiles and rises to his feet. He leans in and gently kisses Pepper on the cheek. “Thanks, Pep.”
“Maybe later.” Steve decides and he curls up with Tony again.
Her words are like a punch to the gut. All of the air in Tony’s lungs vanish and he’s left gasping. Time has seemed to stop. They stare at each other for God knows how long, it almost feels like hours, but it’s probably only a few seconds.
“Yeah.” Tony nods. His eyes drift to the car seat laying near his feet. Morgan is still fast asleep. “I guess we better go. You and Happy wore her out.”
Peter scoffs and shakes his head. “Now you’re in trouble.”
“We’ll take it slow,” Natasha assures with a small smile.
Just thinking about the two people he couldn’t live without puts a smile on his face. They meant everything to him and he couldn’t imagine being in a world that didn’t have them in it. They were the reason he got out of bed every morning. It was Steve who held them all together; he was the glue of their family and without him, they would fall apart.
“I’m trying not to. He’s just been acting odd and I want to know wh-”
Steve takes Tony’s hands and brings him close again. Tony inhales the sweet scent Steve gives off; it only makes the urge to mate stronger. His alpha side demands he take the omega and make him his.
“I do, but not like this. Fuck me,” Steve urges.
His stomach churns at the thought of them being successful and ripping another pup away from him. He wouldn’t let them. He’d keep fighting until his baby was safe and out of harm's reach. Maybe now he’d be the successful one.
Alpha smiles and softly strokes the omega’s cheek. The touch feels worse than the bruise.
“Not outloud you didn’t. I can see it. I just-I just need tonight okay? Please just give me some space.”
Tony tries to crawl closer to console his husband, but Steve holds out a hand to stop him. Tony backs off.
Steve wants to protest, but he keeps his mouth shut and nods instead. “Yeah, okay.”
Sam was thrilled about the reveal, but maybe it was because he got to rub it in Bucky’s face. He made sure to do that and piss the Winter Soldier off. It only brought on more bickering.
“I’m fine. We just have a lot of homework and...stuff.”
“You zoned out there, Cap. I asked if you needed anything else.”
Steve remains locked in his room for a majority of his day. It’s better for everyone in the long run. He came close to hurting his friends because he couldn’t get his own emotions under control. He wonders if the rollercoaster of emotions was another pregnancy symptom, or Tony was just digging that deep under his skin.
“Shirts? What’s wrong with my shirts?” Tony gestures to the black band tee he has on. Steve knew how much Tony loved those types of shirts but they were getting tighter around the middle. Steve wonders how they’re even comfortable any more.
Peter shrugs again. “I don’t know.”
“I don’t know how. Well...I had one idea. It’s crazy and I don’t even know if she’ll agree to it but...maybe Pepper-”
Steve is cautious when he does enter the kitchen. Maybe he could avoid another interaction by saying he’s not hungry, but the aroma of chicken and pasta fills his nose and his stomach rumbles in response.
“It’s not alcohol, right?” Peter asks, warily.
“I give up,” he says and drops his hands to his sides. “We’re going shopping.”
Tony gets down on one knee and helps his son balance. Peter takes a few good steps before plopping down on the floor.
Tony catches the look on Steve’s face, regret washing over him because he knows he’s the reason for upsetting him. He wants to tell Steve that maybe the reason behind their son’s birth was not just because Steve wanted a family at one point, but because it was their chance to get back together. It’s a crazy thought, but Tony can’t help but wonder if maybe it’s not so crazy after all.
“Don’t. Don’t apologize. It’s gonna be okay. You just need more breaks. You’re gonna be okay.”
Peter must be sensing his father’s frustration because it only increases his own. He’s screaming now to the point where his little face is red and contorted in distress. Steve gets up from the chair, deciding to walk around the room with his son. It doesn’t help.
Tony attends to Morgan and changes her in a fresh diaper, then he prepares a bottle for her and takes her out with him to the living room. He lowers himself down on the couch and cradles her in his arm. The minute he offers the bottle, she latches on and nurses greedily.
Bucky and Sam need some exciting news 😉
Steve hopes it does. He doesn’t want anymore pups. Not like this.
“Anything. I don’t want any secrets.”
“So we’re really naming her Morgan?” Tony questions and Steve nods. “And her middle name? We haven’t decided on that.”
“Just that you two were talking and then you left,” Pepper explains.
Bucky releases another sob and turns around so that he can hug Sam back. “I don’t know if I can do this.”
“Hey.” Tony lifts Steve’s chin up. “He’s safe. They’re not going to get him. I’m not letting you out of my sight.”
Tony pecks Steve on the lips, chuckling when the room breaks out with a chorus of disgust. Tony only kisses Steve again.
“There ya go, punk. I’m not so bad. And you’re not so bad yourself. Even if you do smell pretty bad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good.” Pepper smiles. “I’ll let you go, Tony. Tell Steve I said hi.”
Natasha eyes him closely but doesn’t push.
“Mostly mine. I don’t play well with others. You of all people should know that.”
“Give me five minutes alone with him,” Tony tells Steve, then he leads the doctor out of the room and shuts the door behind them.
Steve’s body gives out and he falls back against the bed, his chest rising and falling rapidly as he struggles to get air into his lungs. He takes a good second to compose himself before propping himself up on his elbows and peering down between his legs.
“Aww, Pep. Do you miss me?”
Double update? I think so! I busted this next chapter out and couldn't resist posting. I'll try to space the next one out...maybe.
“Something like that.” Pepper makes her way over and bends down to pick up the tie from off the floor. “Do you seriously need my help with this? How old are you again?”
He sneaks a peek at the bouquet of flowers sitting on the passenger side seat. It was meant as a sweet gesture, something to cheer up his husband, but instead it was probably going to do the opposite. Steve was going to be furious with his tardiness. He had promised that he wouldn’t be late for their plans, and he hadn’t kept that promise.
“This I can do. Don’t expect anything fancy.”
Peter’s face instantly brightens. “Really! I can have my own suit!”
He’s escorted out of the room by Rollins and led down the long corridor toward the elevator. The button for the third floor is pressed once they’re inside and the metal doors shut. Steve knows exactly where they’re taking him.
“You never told me what swinging meant.”
Bucky looks up at him and grips the tags a little tighter. “Me too.”
“I’ll be back...if I’m allowed.” Those last words are meant for Nat and she nods her head.
The tears don’t stop streaming down his face. His nose is stuffed and his eyes are beginning to swell from the tears he can’t conceal. He can’t remember a time when he’s cried this hard before. Usually he kept his emotions to himself. And technically he was still doing that now.
“So I’m almost done, right?”
The shock hasn’t worn off. It probably never will.
I wanted to have some fluffy moments, give Steve a break from feeling so sad. It won't last for long unfortunately, and he'll go back to how he was feeling, maybe even worse. I need to probably update the tags and I'll put a warnings when they're needed. I will try and update soon!
Steve lets another sob and Tony pulls him back into his arms, cradling his head and allowing him to cry into his chest.
“Almost all the time. He promised he’d always be there so I like to think he kept that promise. Those had been the last words he said to me…”
“What? No. I’m staying-”
“It is, but I know he’s still with us. Sometimes it’s like I can feel him, you know?”
“Yeah,” Steve replies. He has to fight back the urge to gag and rush to the bathroom. “Fine.”
The newborn is fast asleep, obviously drained from being born. Tony gets it; he’s exhausted himself. But he doesn’t give in to the exhaustion, not yet at least. He wants to hold his son a little longer.
“Uh sorry. I was with Ned and then I went to the cemetery again.” Peter doesn’t feel that guilty about his lie. He wasn’t telling a complete lie.
A low rumble forms in Steve’s chest. The alpha growls back and presses the gun harder against Tony’s head, his finger hovering over the trigger.
That’s as far as they go. Tony is careful when he touches Steve, making sure his mate is comfortable enough for his hands to be on him.
The agonizing scream Steve makes when the doctor tells them the tragic news has Tony’s heart shattering. He pulls Steve into his arms and holds him tightly, doing everything he can to comfort him. Steve clings to him and sobs into his chest, his body trembling.
Hello, everyone. I'm not sure when I'll be updating again. I tested positive for Covid and I'm trying to take it easy. The only reason this story is getting updated is because it was written before I got sick. If I start feeling better than I'll definitely do some writing. I'm really sorry about this! I hope you all enjoy this chapter.
The alpha is in the kitchen, leaning against the counter and drinking his coffee. Steve is almost afraid to approach; the vibe Tony gives off isn’t welcoming. Tony peers up from his mug and sets it down on the counter.
“I know,” Steve says and he gets up from the chair to stretch. He wanders around the small room, taking note of the posters on the walls.
Sam moves from where he was standing behind the sofa to sit down on the arm beside Bucky, letting his hand rest over his husband’s thigh in an attempt to keep him calm.
“We’ll find out today. Now eat.”
“Come here, kiddo. I promise I don’t bite.”
The hours tick by agonizingly slow. Steve knew labor progressed differently for everyone, but it was like Tony’s was going slower than normal. Peter had already proved that he was going to take after Tony with his stubborn attitude, and now wasn’t any different. Their son just refused to budge.
“I know you’re judging,” Tony says the moment he catches Steve’s lingering eye. Steve shakes his head with a laugh and turns back to the task he was given. Setting up the table was the only thing Tony was allowing him to do. “I know you’re still laughing.”
Then he pays close attention to what Steve has in his hand, and that’s when his heart nearly stops.
“Don’t do that,” Sam tells him. “You have nothing to apologize for.”
“I know, I know. I screwed up. You can say it. I won’t be mad.”
“Look, I don’t know how to explain,” Tony begins, making sure to keep his voice low. “But he’s sort of, well actually there’s a possibility that he’s carrying my kid.”
“I’m gonna screw it up. The team already hates me. Barnes will probably kill me.”
“Yeah.” Tony lets out a sigh and rests his head back against the wall. He squeezes his eyes when tears threaten to fall. He doesn’t want to cry, especially not in front of the kid. Peter didn’t need to see him so broken.
“I’m glad you two are finally getting along,” Steve says. He moves further away from the couch, gesturing for Tony to follow. “Come to bed, Tony.”
He makes his way to the cemetery, swinging from building to building, completely undetected from the city dwellers just feet below. The feeling he gets when he’s high up in the sky is exhilarating. He doesn’t feel any stress or any pain from his hectic life. Being up means he’s free and at ease, even if it’s only for a little while. If he could have it his way, Peter would never come down.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-”
Now though the holiday was aimed more for children, there was still one person who couldn’t get enough of the spooky day. There was no surprise that Tony Stark was a fan, maybe even the biggest fan there ever was. He found delight in the idea of dressing up as someone else. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he loved being Iron Man so much. Or maybe because he was awesome and loved saving people. Maybe all of those were good reasons.
I swear Flash will find out in the next chapter. I just wanted Peter and Steve to have a little talk 😊
Steve attempts to get up, but then he’s registering the pain in his side and he slumps back against the wall. He presses his hand on the wound, hissing from the intense burning that flares up.
He feels better now that he’s talked with Natasha, but that sense of calmness is quick to leave him the moment he steps back onto the floor of his private quarters. Guilt and concern have taken over. He hadn’t been gone too long, but to Steve it could’ve felt like hours.
Tony groans and releases a sigh of defeat. His eyes land on Steve and they narrow. “You gonna stand there all day or help a guy out?”
Steve curls under the blankets and rests his head on the pillow, inhaling the familiar scent of the alpha downstairs. His scent was musky like all alpha’s had, but underneath that was his personal aroma. Coffee. Grease. Expensive cologne. Those were the scents Steve picked up on the most. It was comforting.
“No no I get it. And by the way I am capable of hanging up my own suit. I do care about this family.”
That wasn’t an option of course. Sure he could step down and let someone else take the reins while he figured out his life and the son that was now in it. But he’s been away for so long and it was his responsibility to clean up his mess.
He still has the rest of his family and maybe his dad, but it’s hard to say. Their first interaction hadn’t gone the way Peter had been hoping. He thought for sure his dad would have been happy to see him. But it was like his dad didn’t even care.
Peter comes home drenched and shivering. He doesn’t go upstairs right away, too ashamed to face his uncles and explain the situation he’s found himself in. Just thinking about telling them the truth hurts. He can’t bring himself to do it. They’d never let Tony back into their lives, and his uncle Bucky would go ballistic. Peter can’t hurt them. Not when they’ve already suffered enough.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Steve tells her when Morgan goes back into the kitchen for a glass of water. He pauses dinner to wrap her into a hug. “Thank you, sweetheart.”
“I know. Come here,” Tony takes Steve’s hand and brings him closer. They lie together, tangled in each other's arms. “It’s going to work,” Tony says, rubbing a hand up and down Steve’s arm.
He gives the room a look over, searching for anything that could ease the ache until he had the alpha near him again. He spots what he can only assume is a closet, and with both his curiosity piqued and the urge to have the alpha near him overwhelming, Steve crosses the room to search for something belonging to Tony.
“I know. I’m trying to let go but it’s hard.”
“A-Alpha, please? Please don’t.” Steve begs, his eyes filling with tears. His pleas go unheard. They always do.
Peter knew all the bad stuff, which is why he had held off on meeting his dad. He didn’t feel it was necessary when he had a father that loved him unconditionally and was there for every single aspect of his life. His papa was enough and they were happy.
Bucky shakes his head. Fresh tears spring to his eyes and he takes a deep breath to calm himself before another sob could escape.
Steve rolls his eyes and reaches for the rest of the ice cream, chuckling when Natasha cries out and tries to take it back.
“Apparently to chase after some omega. Can’t you keep it in your pants?”
She smiles, knowing he’s thanking her for more than just a few muffins and an extra pair of hands.
Steve nods. “Yeah. I’ve been away for so long and...and I guess I thought I could move on from it, but I can’t. I still think about the people I left behind. Sometimes I wish I did things differently. At least then I wouldn’t be in this mess and I would’ve been able to spend my lifetime with them. Now they’re gone and I’m forced to live this life.”
Another cramp hits, and just like the first time, Steve grins and bears it. He was fine.
Remember those tags? Yeah...they come into play in this chapter and I’d like to apologize. But you all knew what you were getting yourself into! 😛
“I didn’t do anything bad,” the alpha tries to defend himself.
Steve nods and turns to leave, then he’s turning back around and leaning against the doorframe. “You seemed quiet tonight. At dinner you barely said anything. Still feeling sick?”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I get it. Geez. Is there anything else? I don’t see any pretty omega’s on my arm.”
“Take me to him,” he says again in Russian.
“I know. I like talking to him anyway. All of the books say communication is good.”
“Was that my dad?” Peter asks.
“You’re seriously going to ask me that? Of course I’m happy. I have you and our crazy, adorable pups. What’s not to be happy about?”
“Why?” Bucky asks. “You think he’ll walk out again?”
“I love you. But you still drive me insane. You’re supposed to be taking care of me and Junior.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony is hard at work on something Steve can’t even fully comprehend when he makes his way down the stairs to Tony’s lab. The alpha has his back turned, his attention on the array of screens in front of him. More holographic images appear and Tony plays with them, making sounds of displeasure every now and then.
Tony is somewhere behind him, preparing the washcloth with his favorite body wash. Tony’s carefully when he runs the washcloth over Steve’s back, huffing when he finds more bruises along his husband’s shoulder blades.
Which is why Tony isn’t going to give up. He was done shutting himself out and wallowing in self pity. He had promised he’d be a good father and there was no way in hell he’d break a promise like that. He’s broken enough; let too many people down. But he was changing his ways.
“Need me for what? You wanted me dead, remember?” Tony retorts.
A second chance.
“When?”
“More like homeless.”
“He should be here-” Sam begins to say and the sound of the door opening interrupts. -“now.”
Steve is sitting near the edge of the bed, working the tension and aches out of Tony’s feet. He can’t help but grin to himself from the sounds Tony produces. It reminds him of another activity.
“Last chance, Omega.” Rollins aims for Steve’s head.
“Wait, you want more?”
“Now you’re just saying that.”
The tinted window of the driver side lowers just enough for Peter to get a peek of dark hair and sunglasses. Guess it wasn’t just Peter trying to avoid attention.
“Don’t worry about him okay?”
Steve is forced down to his knees and he lifts his head weakly, showing off the damage the two alphas had done. His face is covered in bruises and blood, a medium size gash runs along his right cheek and his left eye is purple and swollen.
The shirt is a little tight around his middle and the jeans don’t button all the way. Steve gives up on the jeans and searches through the shopping bag until he finds something a little more comfortable. The jogging pants would have to do for now.
Tony stays by Steve’s side, holding his hand and softly rubbing his thumb along his knuckles. Steve hasn’t shown any signs of waking up, but at least he was still alive. He was given another chance, another opportunity to keep fighting.
“You okay?” Tony asks. He gets a nod in response. Steve curls up closer against Tony’s side, stretching his fingers out to gently trace one along Peter’s face.
When Bruce comes back, Peter is fast asleep. Steve had dozed off himself, only to be jolted awake when he scented his son’s presence. He sits up quickly, ignoring the pain that flares through his lower half.
“I’m not upset about the voicemail. I’m upset because it took you so long to listen to it.”
“Papa, stop.” Morgan tries to wiggle out of the mighty grasp. “You’re...squishing...me.”
“Let him go!” Tony yells, his anger boiling. He struggles again to break free, but again his attempts fail and he’s left to watch as his mate is dragged away and tossed onto the mattress. “Don’t hurt him! Don’t you fucking hurt him!”
“What’s wrong? Steve, talk to me.”
“Just hear me out,” Bucky insists. “It hasn’t just been me noticing how different you’ve been. I know the new baby has been an adjustment but how you feel about Tony-”
“Beside leaving you and Steve behind? It’s hard to say when that has probably been my biggest regret to date. I wish I could go back and do things right. But I’m trying now okay? Can that be good enough?”
“Remember Liz’s party?” Peter asks and Ned nods his head. “That’s when. I said I’d only have one drink so I could be cool and-”
Peter doesn’t even answer right away, using his lunch as a distraction. He picks at the sandwich, not finding the ham and cheese delectable like he used to. The morning sickness was awful, constantly plaguing him no matter what time of day it was. Whoever came up with the name morning sickness was an idiot.
But now he had no one. His papa was gone.
Steve glances down and wraps one arm around his middle. His reaction is the only answer Tony needs.
“I’ll figure it out.”
Natasha seems to agree while Bruce remains silent. Then everyone’s gaze is falling on Sam and he sighs heavily. The decision should be any easy one, but Sam can’t help but feel that the team should accept Tony back.
“Hey don’t worry about it. I’m sure it will blow over and you’ll never think about that night again.”
“Steve, it’s okay. I am their dad.” Tony beams and slowly makes his way over to properly greet his kids. “Hey, kiddos.”
“Is she okay?” Steve asks. Tony’s eyes flicker up to meet Steve‘s, then they’re settling back on the wrapped hand.
It really was the best Halloween ever.
“You okay?” Tony questions, doing a quick scan with his eyes. He wishes he could have JARVIS run one. He’s considering saying fuck it to the compromise and have JARVIS do it anyway. “What hurts?”
Pepper returns a few minutes later and they start the meeting again. Steve is still hesitant and unsure about revealing who he was and the life he was forced to live, but his mate and friend assured him that he had nothing to worry about. He was safe now.
“And what about them? I’d really like to not get punched again.”
“I think,” Pepper starts with a warm smile. “You, Tony Stark, can be a dad. Just don’t take that poor kid into the lab with you!”
“Hi.”
“He’s asleep, sir. Hasn’t left the room since you...how do I put this lightly…”
“Fuck.” Tony growls and leans down to capture Steve’s lips in a kiss. Their lips move sloppily. Steve pulls away, head tilting back when Tony hits that spot inside of him. Tony grunts and aims to hit that spot again. “Does it…feel good?”
Tony grabs his phone again and calls Steve back. He gets his voicemail again. “Dammit, Steve, answer me! I’m sorry! I’m sorry I screwed up but I want to talk. I want to fix this. Call me back...please call me back. I’m sorry.”
Tony gives Steve one last look, silently pleading for them to stop fighting and work as a team. “I love you.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says and he steps further into the room, eyes roaming over the large space. He looks lost and out of place. Tony wonders if he’s always felt this way.
Steve is fast asleep when Tony goes to check on him a few hours later. He’s careful when he crawls on the bed to lie beside him. Steve must sense his presence because he moves toward him and curls up with him.
“That doesn’t mean anything. He’s still a Rogers.”
“Uh...I mean. Sorry. I suck at this.”
Morgan doesn’t fuss or stir, instead she finds comfort in the familiar scent and drifts back to sleep.
“How was work?” Tony asks as he adjusts his son on his hip.
And maybe it was because working alone meant he was unlikely to cause damage to those closest to him. Okay, maybe that wasn’t entirely true. His time as Iron Man brought new threats everyday to the people he cared about. Working with a team just wasn’t his style.
“Yeah. It’s me, honey.”
“No....are you?”
Once he makes sure the team has left the jet, he crawls out from his space, landing perfectly and quietly on his feet. The ramp is still down, indicating that the team meant to be back soon. Peter steps toward the ramp, only to pause when a sound catches his attention.
Dodger barks again and licks along Tony’s hand, then he’s running toward the opposite side of the room and trotting back over with a stuffed lion in his mouth. He stops beside Steve, dropping the toy in Steve’s lap.
“Uncle Sam!” Peter cries out and tries to hug his uncle, only to pull away when Sam groans. “Sorry! I’m so sorry!”
“What?” Tony snaps his head up in her direction. “What do you mean? I met with him last week.”
“Steve, don’t.” Tony comes closer until they’re standing near each other. He places both hands over Steve’s shoulders. “Whatever thoughts you’re having right now, don’t listen to them. That voice is a liar.”
“He said he was boarding the jet soon but that was an hour ago.”
“I know. Don’t give up okay? I’m with you through all of this. I’m never leaving your side.”
“Damn,” Tony mutters to himself and rubs at his head, forgetting about the bump he finds there and winces. “Must’ve been a hell of a night.”
“Tony.” Steve comes closer and cups the alpha’s busted face in his hands. Tony stares into his blue eyes, finding nothing but pain and fear in them. He misses the way they used to shine with happiness. All of that was gone now.
“Tony!” Steve calls out, only to go ignored.
“I don’t want to let him go.”
“Yeah!” Peter’s response is shocking. The last Tony heard was that his son was struggling to find the perfect costume. He honestly didn’t blame him. Every year something new was coming out. It could be a little overwhelming.
“Good. I’m getting rid of it anyway.”
“Maybe you’re just scared. Maybe you’re confused. I don’t know. I guess I’ll never know. I hope you listen to this message, Tony. And if not...I guess that’s okay. I won’t push you anymore. Goodbye, Tony.”
“I love you more.”
Steve glances down, his jaw clenching and fingers gripping his own knife tightly. He looks up when the alpha continues.
“I just think it’s a little weird that he’s being so...so…”
Tony begins picking up, then he goes in search of Steve and their son. It’s not difficult to find them. Steve is in the bathroom giving Peter a bath. The door is slightly ajar, and Tony pauses behind it, listening to Steve talk and coo to their son. He can’t help but smile.
“Daddy!” Sarah cries and rushes toward the alpha, throwing herself at him and wrapping her arms around one of his legs.
“Is he gone? He’s not coming back, right? You said I’d be safe here. You said-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter nods and makes his way to the guest bedroom. The door is slightly ajar, piquing his interest and he can’t help but peer through the crack. His uncle Bucky is inside, sitting on the edge of the bed and sobbing. Peter expects to see those same dog tags in his hand, but this time he notices something entirely different. His uncle is holding what appears to be a tiny baby shirt.
I'm so sorry that it's taken me this long to update this one. I got stuck and wasn't sure what to do, but I'm starting to plan it out and will hopefully have this one updated frequently. Thank you for being so patient with me!
“It wouldn’t be for very long. Just a couple of hours,” Tony says.
“Whoa!” Sam jumps up to get between Peter and Bucky. He’s hoping violence wouldn’t break out, but he wasn’t about to take any chances. “Pete, that’s enough.” Sam points a warning finger at his nephew.
Tony’s hesitant to approach. The last thing he wants to do is make Steve feel worse. He has already done enough. He’s already done the worst thing possible.
Happy nods and opens the door for Peter. When they’re both inside the vehicle and making their way through the busy streets, Happy asks, “I’m assuming it’s either laundry day or your mini me is growing.”
“I get that but-”
“And Alpine!” Peter adds with a smile.
“You’re pulled from future assignments. If you want to retire after this that’s your choice, but the world still needs Captain America.”
“Is the baby okay?”
“I know you can but I need you to sit this one out. I’ll be okay.”
Taking control of a super soldier is a lot easier than Tony thought it was going to be. He has Steve laying flat on his back with his blue button up shirt already open and revealing the white undershirt he wore underneath. Thor’s mead was legit.
“Uh huh. And how’s-it’s Steve isn't it? I know you haven’t kicked him out yet.”
Peter smirks when he catches the fearful look on Flash’s face. It was about time someone threatened him.
Steve chuckles. “I’m working on it,” he says and reaches out to ruffle his son’s messy hair.
There’s still some hesitation and Tony can practically see the argument Steve was having with himself. Then he’s nodding his head and allowing Tony to take her from him. Tony brings Morgan close, trying to get her calm.
Steve closes off immediately and turns back to the window. Tony gets the hint and doesn’t push for more.
Brock Rumlow steps into the room, his signature smirk etched on his face. “Don’t give me any more problems, Omega. I’d hate to mess up your pretty little face.”
Tony rushes out of the office, not even bothering to say goodbye. He’d inform Pepper when he could.
“No. I’m happy,” Steve replies and curls up closer to the alpha. “Are you?”
Steve huffs and brings himself to a stop. Sam and Bucky do the same and they regroup, all panting from the workout.
But yet he still can’t help but feel uneasy about the other alpha’s presence. He decides to let it go for now and keep his attention entirely focused on the omega sitting across from him. He was so interested in him.
“Okay.”
“I’m falling apart, Sam. Every day he’s on my mind. I want to go back to that night and change it. It’s my fault he’s dead.”
He hears a sniff. Is Steve crying?
“Yes...but I guess there’s some mission.”
Natasha frowns. “Steve, what’s going on?”
“Exactly,” Bucky says. “He wasn’t even there. Steve needed him and he left. I’m sorry but I can’t forgive that so easily.”
Morgan rolls her eyes. Of course Peter would go first. It seemed like he was always stealing the spotlight instead of sharing it.
“Something’s different,” Steve replies. “If you need to tell me something, anything, I’m here okay?”
Steve smiles, wraps his arm around his son’s shoulders, and leads him out of the room.
“I never did,” Steve frowns and moves toward the stove to continue making breakfast.
Steve keeps his eyes on his daughter’s, hoping she would be enough to distract him from those tormenting thoughts.
“He called too?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony soothes and hugs Steve tightly. “It’s not your fault.”
“How was school?” Steve asks, making sure to send Tony a look that says ‘be nice.’
Peter stares up at Steve, head cocking in confusion. He’s heard the word multiple times, but has refused to say it. Steve was still holding onto hope.
The pups are fast asleep. Harley is curled up beside his brother, softly snoring. Steve smiles and approaches the bedside, reaching down to gently brush a hand through James’ hair.
“Yeah. I’ll be right there.” Steve forces a smile.
“Yeah,” Tony eventually says. “Couldn’t be happier.”
“You can talk to me about anything. You know that, right. Your dad and I are here for you no matter what.”
He doesn’t thank her and instead rushes toward the door to the separated room. It’s locked and he reaches for the badge to scan himself in. The door remains locked and he curses, one hand coming down roughly on the metal door.
“I think you should respond to those emails.”
“Tony…”
“Do you want to go to medical?”
Sam sighs. “I had a feeling. You always love to eavesdrop. Okay spill it. What did you hear? All of it, or just parts?”
Their eyes meet for a second and Peter quickly looks down to avoid Flash’s gaze. He didn’t know how he was going to tell Flash yet, but this wasn’t the time or the place.
“It’s not your fault,” Peter murmurs. And honestly it wasn’t. The team had done their best; Peter would never blame them. He blames himself. He should’ve stayed in the base and helped. He should’ve begged harder for his father to stay behind.
“You know Tony?” Steve finds his voice. The alpha nods her head.
“Oh right.” Steve leans back in his chair with a huff and runs a hand through his hair. “Guess it’s just been a crazy day.”
“What’s going on with you, dude?” Ned asks.
But he plays along like he knows he should. That idea still lingers in the back of his mind. It resurfaces every now and then, and each time Tony has to push it back and pretend it didn’t exist.
“Can wait. Come on,” Tony takes Steve's hand and leads him away from the counter. “Come back to the party. Bruce just got here.”
“Tony, where are you?” Is the first thing Natasha says once they’re connected.
“Okay. I’ll be right there. Thanks, buddy,” Tony says, then he turns back to Steve. “We can talk later, right?”
“Of course I’ll do it for him. I love that kid.”
Now that wasn’t to say that Steve didn’t love his children. From the moment he held Harley and Peter, his heart swelled with joy and a promise had been made to protect and love them for as long as he lived. He loved being a mother. It was the greatest, most rewarding job in the world.
“I’m so sorry.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and intertwines their fingers. He wants to pull Steve closer.
“You’re doing great, and Pete’s gonna think so too. He gets to have you as his father. He’s lucky.”
“I’m fine,” Peter nods. He doesn’t bother to complain about the bruise that’s probably forming on his hip as he speaks. Getting bruises was part of being an Avenger.
Peter smiles sadly and wipes at the new tears that fall. “He used to call me that sometimes.”
The moment he learned of her existence was the day he vowed to protect and love her for as long as he lived. But when she came, that promise he made was broken. He had only kept part of it.
She can’t help but feel angry with him. It wasn’t fair that he was stealing away all of the attention. Hadn’t it occurred to him that maybe he was being selfish? Didn’t he notice what he was doing?
Peter smiles and fist bumps the air in triumph. He turns back to the video that’s been playing on a loop and makes himself comfortable on the sofa.
“Peter wanted this. Every year we always did something. He didn’t want that to stop.”
“It’s a little hard to explain.”
A sob can be heard.
The two pups rush to Tony’s side to give him the same greeting. Tony lifts Harley into his arms, only to wince in pain and hand him to Steve. His sore back was going to be an issue for a little longer.
Tony smiles and rises to his feet, then rounds the desk to get to her and take her hands in his own. “It’s yours, Pep. You deserve it.”
“I hope I’m not too old for this,” Peter says as he lays the sketch of him and his papa down near the foot of the monument. He drew them dressed as their alter egos, but instead of saving the city together, they’re at the top of a skyscraper in Brooklyn, watching the sun begin to set. It was a reality Peter had been hoping for one day.
“Uh…” Peter’s face heats up and he rubs his arm nervously. “No…”
Steve nods. He takes a breath to calm himself, hating how shaky it comes out. “F-fine, bud.”
“Oh. Sorry.”
And that hurt worse.
His phone is sitting on the nightstand beside his bed, and he reaches for it, finding the number he hasn’t called in a while. He’s not expecting anyone to pick up, but after the third ring, Tony’s voice is on the other line.
Tony lets out a sigh. “I'm sorry. I swear if I would've known then I would’ve been there. I wouldn’t have missed something important like that.”
Tony laughs. “Yeah probably. It’s our job.”
An idea pops into his head. He immediately argues with himself over it, trying to convince himself that it was a stupid idea. Maybe even worse than being a stowaway.
“That’s right,” Steve mimics and holds his own finger to his lips. “Shh.”
“Why do you want to rush this?”
He wraps his arms around his daughter a little tighter, ready to put up a fight if he needs to. The alphas don’t approach. They step aside, allowing two other people to enter. The beta in the white lab coat enters first-Steve recognizes him from a previous delivery- followed by another familiar face. This face strikes fear in him.
“I’m just saying that you two taking your relationship to the next level isn’t a terrible idea. In a few months you’ll be having a pup and-”
“That’s enough.” A familiar voice cuts through and Steve freezes at the sight of the head alpha. Pierce steps into the room with Rumlow beside him.
“Tony-”
, he tells himself. He had to be strong even when he didn’t want to be. His family was broken and it was up to him to keep them from crumbling. Just like his papa used to do.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis replies and the lights shut off downstairs.
Tony smiles and leans in again to press a soft kiss to Steve’s lips. “You didn’t have to do that.”
Tony nods again, but decides to let Steve leave first. “Can’t go down together,” Tony explains when Steve stares at him quizzically. “Don’t want people getting the wrong idea.”
Steve rests his head against the bump, softly talking to their son. Tony smiles down at him and runs his fingers through his husband’s hair. He hasn’t seen him this happy in a long time.
Peter only responds with more loud cries. Steve cries along with him.
Steve is torn between wanting to feel his son again and leaving him alone. The baby is so small and vulnerable, and the last thing Steve wants to do is hurt him more than he already has.
“What if you can’t fix me?”
“And he doesn’t know how smart I can be.”
Tony excuses himself at one point, needing a break from the videos. He returns back to his workbench, his mind plotting ideas for his son’s suit. Steve’s sketch had been vague, but it gave him a general idea of what he envisioned for their son. He’d do his best to bring it to life.
“I know. I can’t imagine...sorry. We don’t have to talk about it.”
Steve doesn’t respond and he keeps his back to Tony. The alpha tries to coax him away from the cliff and back to the party.
He just wants to live a normal life. His papa always talked about that simple life. He couldn’t have the one his papa envisioned for them, but maybe he could have one meant just for him.
“Really?”
“I swear it’s okay. We’re lab partners!”
“I told you!” Peter giggles.
“Well maybe I don’t care.”
He’s able to push aside his own discomfort, his focus entirely on Tony. He stays by his side, holding his hand, speaking encouraging and comforting words. It doesn’t help, at least not really, but it’s all Steve can do at this point.
“Thank God.” Tony puts his head back down and his eyes flutter shut. “I love you more.”
“I’m only making the suggestion because you have a pregnant omega under your wing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony huffs and pulls away. He winks and says, “Later.”
“But if I didn’t have the serum you know I’d be dead right now. The point is, I hurt myself and I could easily do it again, or worse, to you or Morgan. And I can’t, Tony. I can’t do that.”
“I know. I’m sorry I had been so careless. But you don’t have to worry about me. I’m fine,” Tony assures.
“I can’t say I’m not surprised,” the alpha says and takes a sip from his glass. “You were always stubborn, never obeyed anyone. It was difficult to get you to behave. I guess I’ll have to try a little harder.”
“You knew we were trying.”
“Damn,” Tony is the first to say. Even if he wanted to move he doesn’t know if he can. His body is completely drained. And also completely satisfied. “I need to let you do that more often.”
“Let’s go see Papa,” Tony whispers to his son, taking Peter over to where Steve is sitting. Steve glances up, quickly using one hand to wipe away his tears.
“Shh. Honey, it’s okay. It’s over now. It’s all over.”
“The baby...he...he’s moving. Steve, I think I feel him.” Tony grips Steve’s wrist and leads his hand to the spot where he was sure he felt a kick. Steve’s brows knit together. He must not feel it. “I swear I-there it is again! Do you feel it?”
Steve groans when a hand touches his shoulder and shakes him gently. He opens his eyes and yawns. “Hmm?”
“Oh.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He can hear his aunt and uncle talking as he makes his way down the hall and toward the bedroom he told himself he’d never enter again.
“I’m in labor.”
Peter is passed out, head resting on Steve’s shoulder and small fingers barely hanging onto the handle of his trick or treat bag. The red tie hangs loosely around his neck and the gel in his hair has lost its hold. The makeup on his face has faded, leaving behind brown smears of paint.
“He probably hates me. How could he not?” Tony scoffs.
“I want to give my mate one!” Harley says.
“I think everything is in the bag,” Tony says lamely. “If I forgot something then-”
“Right on time,” Tony says when Steve and the pups approach him. “I wanted to introduce the kids to J.”
Tony smiles. “Happy Valentine’s Day.”
“I want to take Morgan out.”
When no one responds, he sighs and asks, “Why didn’t he call me? Why did he call Stark and not me?”
“Sirs,” Jarvis interrupts. “Mr. Hogan has arrived.”
“You won’t.”
“Do you want me to try?” Steve asks, holding out his arms. Tony shakes his head and continues to rock and speak soothingly to their son. Steve sighs and drops his arms to his side. “I feel so helpless.”
Bucky huffs out a laugh. “Smart ass. What’s up?”
“Yeah.”
“Whatever it is you want to say. I’m sure I’ve heard worse.”
Morgan is carefully placed in her father’s arms, and that’s when Tony’s world changes. She was tiny, fitting perfectly in the crook of his arm as if she was meant to be there all along. Her head is covered in a hat, but it can’t fully contain the hair underneath, giving him a glimpse of her dark strands.
“Well, I mean-”
Steve nods. “Yeah. Do you need anything?”
“Hey! Four pups is a lot, Steve. A lot. I don’t know how you do it.”
Tony is so awful in this and I’m sorry! Steve deserves to much better 😞
“Hear you.” Comes Steve’s voice and both the alpha and beta jump. Tony spins around to find Steve standing behind him. He didn’t even realize Steve had come into the kitchen; he’s so quiet.
“Papa, can you drink something else?” Peter speaks up.
Steve opens his eyes, meeting soft brown ones. Tony smiles up at him.
“I know, I know,” Tony quickly surfs through the channels in hopes of finding something else. “Aha!
Steve is over the moon with excitement and tears of happiness are streaming down his face at the reveal. Tony puts on the same fake smile and kisses Steve tenderly. He wants to be happy that he has a son, but he can’t. It only reminds him of the future relationship he and his son are cursed to have.
“Okay. I won’t take long-”
Peter is screaming, his face red and scrunched up in discomfort. Steve is just as frustrated, if not more. He’s exhausted. He wonders how he’s even able to care for his son with his body so run down.
He’s currently curled up around his favorite pillow and fast asleep. Steve is still where he has been for the past few hours, slumped in the chair and eyes only for Tony. He promised he’d be there if his husband needed him. Leaving the chair wasn’t an option.
“I’m going to move her.” Steve is careful when he picks Morgan up, smiling at her when she blinks her eyes open. “Hi, baby girl. I’m home now.”
After the service, only a few stay behind. Peter finally finds the courage to approach the casket and he reaches out, running his hand over the smooth wooden surface.
Steve nods and opens his mouth to speak, only for a groan of pain to come out instead. He leans back in his chair and wraps both arms around himself. When he opens his eyes, he’s met with two sets of worried brown eyes. Doctor Patterson lays a comforting hand over his shoulder.
Tony makes himself comfortable on the sofa and takes a drink, then he checks his phone. He had called and Happy had assured him that everything was fine and Steve would call him back. Steve hadn’t returned his call yet, and it was beginning to worry the alpha. He just needed to know that his mate was okay.
“Yep,” Tony eventually replies and Peter looks over at him again. “Fine.”
The one he’s chosen was one he’s seen countless times before, but yet this time the film was affecting him differently. What was supposed to be a harmless cartoon has turned him into a blubbering mess.
He turns around in his chair and sets his eyes on his newest invention. For months he and Peter had planned and designed his suit. They never did get to finish it. Tony’s the one who finished it, hoping that maybe, just maybe, this would bring his son back to him.
“No,” Steve shakes his head with a small laugh. “Just buried in the closet. Yours looks new.”
“I know. Honey, I’m not making fun. Seeing you with him is actually something I enjoy,” Tony assures.
Steve turns and makes his way toward the door, pausing when he has one hand on the knob. “I’ll calm your dad down. Just take it easy okay? Let me know if you need anything.”
on Blu-ray?” Sam questions, lips twisting into a grin as he struggles to hold back his laughter.
And Steve Rogers…Tony didn’t even know where to begin.
Steve looks happy with Bucky. He’s smiling, something Tony hadn’t seen in sometime. Even when they were still together.
Tony’s stomach twists uncomfortably and he has to bite back the urge to vomit. Being back at the compound doesn’t bring him any joy or excitement. He’s nervous and scared about reuniting with his old teammates.
Steve nods. “How’s Morgan? Has Nat said anything?”
“It’s okay. You’re fine. Try and hold it for ten seconds okay? Tony, count.”
“And your point?” Tony questions, eyes narrowing.
“Hey.” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand and interlocks their fingers. He brings it up to his lips to place a kiss along Steve’s knuckles. “I had fun.”
Sam knew he could never be Steve. He could never fill the void he left behind, but he was going to give it his all to be there for the people he cared about most. The team wasn’t his, but it didn’t matter. He’d still be there for them.
“I don’t have a chest, sir.”
But none of those things were going to happen. Steve was dead. There would be no marriage and children. There would be no more avenging Earth and all of its occupants. His superhero days were over.
“Move!” Brock barks out another order. He grips Steve by his shirt and shoves him forward.
“I might regret it.”
“Stop. I never did that. I would never do that.”
Tony leans forward until he’s hunched over the omega. The angle is perfect, hitting that spot inside that makes the omega scream. Tony continues to hit that spot, wanting to hear more of those amazing sounds.
“Yeah?” Steve sniffs and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his sweater. “Then if I didn’t mean it then why...forget it.”
“I’m not surprised. She’s your daughter.”
“But I need your help. You promised you’d be there if I ever needed you...and I need you now. Your weapons have gotten into the wrong hands...there’s a base in Siberia where they’re being traded; I need to shut it down, but I can’t do that without you. Take my place. Please, Tony. I’ll never ask for anything again.”
Happy sighs loudly. “You want me to do something else stupid, don’t you?”
For weeks he felt like he was living with someone else. Steve, his husband, the man he promised to spend the rest of his life with, no longer existed. The person Tony resides with resembled the man he loved, but it wasn’t the one he remembered. Steve had changed drastically since the birth of their daughter, and for a moment, Tony believed he had lost him for good.
Tony sighs and pauses his work. “Just some old...stuff. It helps sometimes.”
Despite the couple of years since the passing of his father, the sadness has never fully disappeared. Some days are easier than others. Peter is proud to say that he can pull himself out of bed every morning. But there are times when even that is too difficult to do. His family is right there by his side, holding him up and providing strength when he can’t seem to muster up his own.
He’s snapped from his thoughts when he hears Steve enter the apartment. Tony quickly diverts his gaze from the nearly empty bottle of pills and continues to pour himself a cup of coffee.
“Shit. And you went on that mission.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whimpers, his body shaking with each sob. “I’m sorry, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Peter sits down as instructed, his hands in his lap and head cast down. He sneaks a glance when he hears his parents, his stomach coiling at the sight of them. He does his best to keep calm, but something tells him that he was in a shit ton of trouble.
Just thinking about the baby erases any previous pleasure. The bump is pressing against his own belly, a painful reminder that in a few months that baby will arrive and turn everything upside down. Tony couldn’t have that.
“I’m fine,” Tony says honestly. “No issues here.”
“I don’t know. I don’t know how he does it but he always finds an alpha and brings him to me. You were that alpha,” Steve says.
Tony heaves out a sigh and walks over to the bed. “Can I sit here?” He asks, and when Peter nods, Tony sits down on the edge.
“Daddy, what is it?” Sarah asks sweetly. She holds her doll close to her chest, blue eyes bright with excitement.
“You’re not. Tony, stop. Just let me explain.”
“You need to take him downstairs. The lab is set up for-” Tony begins to say, only to catch himself when he notices the uneasy look on his mate’s face. “Honey, he’ll be fine. Bruce is gentle.”
Tony does his best not to bring up Steve’s birthday, but the more the weeks pass, the harder it is for him to contain himself.
“I do look pretty good, huh? And look at you! I swear you’re just like a mini me. Do you think you can step in for me Monday morning? They won’t be able to tell the difference.”
Steve is relieved to know that his husband was feeling better and the pregnancy wasn’t being too rough on him, but he can’t help but sympathize when Tony complains about the new symptoms. He wishes he could take Tony’s place. It should be him suffering for their baby.
Peter nods and quickly rushes after Happy. They step into the elevator and ride it quietly up to the top floor. Peter contemplates on starting up another conversation, but he decides against it. He had the feeling that his dad’s bodyguard/chauffeur didn’t like him very much.
They’re back at the safety of the compound. The mission had been a success and they were lucky enough to walk away with only a few scraps and bruises. Steve appears in the worst condition, but he shrugs it off. He’s used to the cuts and bruises that come with the assignments.
Tony lets out a sigh of defeat. Pepper, as usual, was right. He was still feeling off and he had the worst headache of his life. He’d been hungover before but never like this. Work was a good distraction but he couldn’t focus. It was pointless to even try.
Now time for more angst 😈
The Avengers was just a group of misfits trying to find their place in the world. Tony understood that more than anyone. He himself felt like an outcast 9 times out of 10. His fame and fortune didn’t mean a damn thing if at the end of the day he still felt like a loser, like nobody.
“Then we’re getting out of here.”
“It’s bigger than that actually. What if...you ran this company?”
“You weren’t born yet,” Natasha helps fill in some of the gaps.
He’s unaware of the way his hands travel up to Steve’s neck, fingers wrapping tightly around his throat. Steve moans again and Tony fucks into him at a harsher pace.
“You can touch me all you want, darling. I’m all yours.”
The secret organization was their best bet. It helped that Steve was familiar with them, but Tony wasn’t sure if that fact made choosing them better or worse. Would Steve feel reluctant to open up because he knew them? He knew his teammates and still kept his feelings bottled up. He could do it again.
“Was I with anyone? Pep mentioned an omega.”
“I’m not lying. You’re beautiful, Tony.” Steve smiles and kisses Tony again, then he’s lowering himself until he’s at eye level with Tony’s belly and he places a kiss there too. “You’re so beautiful like this. We should’ve done this a long time ago.”
“Be friends?” Steve finishes and Tony shrugs slightly. “I think we can do that right?”
“Forget it.” Peter turns on his heels and stomps out of the kitchen to change into something else.
Their eyes meet for a second before Tony’s eyes are fluttering shut and his fingers slip from Steve’s shirt. He falls to the floor with a grunt.
Steve glances down at his stomach, gently placing one hand over his still flat middle. He knows he needs to tell Tony. Maybe this is what would bring Tony back.
“Trust me, I was freaking out the whole way over. That was one of the craziest phone calls I have ever been a part of,” Tony says.
“Yeah we’ll we’re his guardians so-”
Bruce nods his head in agreement. “He did. If he was alive, he’d want those two to come together.”
Harley huffs and turns away.
“Indeed, sir. I’m sorry to interrupt, but you appear to have a visitor.”
“Next time I won’t miss,” he threatens, then he turns and walks back into the room he just came out of.
It was a promise. One Tony would never break.
“Tony, please.” Steve is pleading now. Damn him. Tony can’t deny him anything and he knows it. “I want to keep him. I know what it’s like to feel lost and displaced in the world. I didn’t have a home until you and the team. He needs a home, too.”
Before Bruce can answer, Steve is cutting in.
“If you want.”
“Sorry,” Steve says quietly and tries to hide himself. His appearance had been another thing the pregnancy changed. Though his stomach didn’t distend like it should have, he still had a bit of pooch and his chest was swollen.
“You haven’t told anyone, right?” Flash demands.
Tony nods and waits for Steve to say something else. When he doesn’t Tony smiles softly up at his mate and kisses the back of his hand. “I’d never hurt you. I love you so much, and all I want to do is love you and protect you for the rest of my life.”
No matter what.
Steve sighs. “This would be so much easier if we had done this months ago. If we had been prepared…”
“I promised,” Steve says again. “The day I found out about her I swore to never hurt her. She’s my baby. What kind of father would I be if I...if I hurt her? I did the one thing I was never supposed to do.”
Just like Peter suspected, Ned is invited to dinner. Ned accepts, and Peter couldn’t be more relieved. His parents wouldn’t question his strange behavior if Ned was around.
Steve nods his head even though he knows they won’t be seeing each other again. “Okay.”
Steve smiles and leans in to close the small gap between them. Their lips meet in a gentle kiss. Tony brings Steve even closer and wraps his arms around him, holding him tight. Steve nuzzles against the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent of his alpha. He purrs.
“I know, I know. Just open it, dork.”
“You’re safe,” Steve whispers and hugs his son close, doing what he had with the other pups and kissing the top of James’ head. The pup responds with a soft purr, the sound bringing tears to Steve’s eyes.
Steve gives in and decides to go down to the medical bay. He doesn’t get far, barely making it to the living room before the pain becomes too much and his knees buckle, struggling to keep him upright. With a groan he slides down to the floor, resting against the back of the couch. He cries out again when the pain gets more severe, and he wraps both arms around his middle.
Steve smiles softly and yawns. “You’re never a waste. And if it helps, I’m nervous too.”
But his papa always told him if he wanted to meet his dad then he should. His papa would never be mad if he did.
“I know. I hate it too. I miss him so much.”
“Indeed I am, sir,” JARVIS replies.
“Right. I guess it’s a little hard to believe since you’re...you know…” Tony gestures to Steve’s uniform.
Tony inhales sharply and the grip he has on the steering wheel tightens. He couldn’t imagine going to visit Steve’s grave again. The first time had been torture and he knows the second time wouldn’t be any better. It was easier to try and forget. Move on.
Peter rolls his eyes and adjusts the strap of his backpack along his shoulder. “They’re pissed. Well, one of them is. The other is...strangely okay with it. I don’t know.”
“Good. Because between him and Barton…” Tony trails off, picturing the damage the tower will be in when those two team up. Maybe he shouldn’t have let Steve keep the dog.
“He’s not…” Tony trails off and steals a glance in the direction of the shut door. To avoid the possible risk of Happy or Steve eavesdropping, Tony places a hand over Bruce’s shoulder and steers him away. “He’s enhanced.”
“Thanks, Sam. I appreciate that.”
“My husband and friends are still in there.”
To be honest, Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to know any more.
“You promise?”
“Not at all. I’ll get the um...yeah…”
For once Steve was looking forward to the future. He had a mate, an alpha that loved and cared about him. He had a beautiful baby boy on the way. His life was improving. His life was everything he had hoped for and more.
The first scan Jarvis pulls up on Steve’s next appointment reveals the gender; they were having a boy. The pup was positioned in a way that left no room for questioning. It was as if the baby was trying to tell his parents that their guess had been wrong. Tony finds it hilarious, but at the same time he can’t help but worry if his son would turn out like him. Maybe he’d be lucky and the pup would end up like Steve.
“I promise I’ll be a good father. I’ll do anything to keep you and mommy safe. You both mean the world to me. No one and I mean no one will ever hurt you.”
“On the bed,” the alpha orders and Steve complies. He lies back on the bed, eyes trained on the ceiling above him. The bed dips when Alpha joins him. Steve’s trapped between the bed and the man above him.
“You’re a sore winner.” Steve shakes his head.
He loved his son. Of course he did. They didn’t have a strong relationship yet, but Tony vowed to create one and always keep it strong. He could admit to himself that he was a shitty father. How his son even wanted a relationship with him was baffling. But Tony was done hiding away from his problems.
Steve allows his hand to roam curiously over the alpha’s back. He grows braver and brings his hand to Tony’s chest, breath hitching when he feels the beating of the alpha’s heart. He lays his palm against the steady beating.
“It’s fine,” Steve responds.
“I know,” Steve says softly. “Pete, we’re here for you. What are you thinking?”
“Everyone did, Tony! But you blew us off because all you care about is yourself! What the hell were you doing?”
“No,” Steve replies with a shake of his head. “Right now you’re freaking out and trying to figure out what to do. Trust me I know. But your dad and I are here for you okay?”
The elevator arrives at its destination and Tony leads the way. He glances over his shoulder every now and then, watching the omega closely. He wasn’t expecting Steve to turn on him, but he wasn’t about to let his guard down. Steve was a complete stranger.
“Do you need me to do anything else while I’m here?” Happy asks.
“Not as much as I should.”
“Is this you apologizing or taking your anger out on me? Let me know in case I need the suit.”
“Who said we have to stay here? We can go wherever you want. Just pick a place and we’ll go.”
Tony is happy again once he has his favorite snack and a promise that he’ll be getting the drugs soon. He could usually do pain and suffering. He’s been through those two things most of his life, but it didn’t compare to the bitch that was labor.
Peter’s eyes go wide and he gasps loudly. “Chips!”
“I guess not.”
“It did.” Tony nods in agreement.
Tony groans and brings Steve closer, thrusting harder and provoking more moans and curses from Steve’s parted lips. He can tell Steve is close and he moves faster, desperate to bring Steve over the edge first.
“Actually,” Bucky chimes in and everyone’s attention falls on him and the fussy baby in his arms. “This one is a handful.”
“O-okay,” Peter stammers and glances around the large living room before gingerly lowering himself down on the expensive sofa. He wipes his palms over his jeans a couple of times before fiddling with his fingers again.
Steve chuckles and moves his hand to the curve of Tony’s stomach. “I’m excited.”
“Are you sure you want to go to school?” Steve asks again.
Peter chuckles softly and steps away from the car. Tony rolls up the window and speeds away.
It’s worse.
One glance at his alarm clock shows he had been asleep for a little over 3 hours. It’s not nearly enough and his body begs for more rest, but the loud noises coming from outside his bedroom are too hard to ignore.
He decides on leaving Tony alone. He doesn’t want to make him uncomfortable in any way. They could always talk more later. It was what Tony suggested in the first place.
All of that was behind him now. He was a free omega to be and do whatever he wanted.
The dish in Steve’s hand slips and clunks loudly against the sink. He forgets about the dishes, his mind entirely on yesterday’s events. He screams at himself to reply to his son, but he can’t find his voice. The tears are back, threatening to fall. He tries to hold them back.
Any day now they would be welcoming their son. A mixture of excitement and fear flood through them. They were having a baby. They were going to be parents, something neither one of them knew anything about.
The rest of the group doesn’t appear to notice, too engrossed in their own conversation or playful banters. Bucky moves closer to Peter and wraps an arm around him.
His legs wobble, threatening to give out. Steve uses the edge of the bed to steady himself. The staff is unable to help him stand, but even if they could, he didn’t have the strength to stand for long. His stomach cramps painfully, punching a pained gasp from his lips.
Peter stops in his tracks and turns around to face her. He almost forgot about the doors his dad had led him through just hours prior. It would probably be better for him to sneak away.
It’s strange being down in his lab without having Dodger sharing the space with him. Lately, he had been extremely clingy with Steve and no matter how many times Tony tried pulling the dog away to give Steve some space, Dodger refused to leave Steve’s side.
Peter bites down on his bottom lip. The words are right there on the tip of his tongue. All he had to say was two words. But he couldn’t muster up the courage to do it.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures, feeling relieved that the AI was still online and not notifying him of any threats.
Steve chokes back a sob when another contraction hits. He’s forced to push again, screaming and cursing through it all. More of the baby comes into view. He was almost done.
I finally updated this one! I had a push from one of my amazing readers and I finally got the last chapter completed. I hope you all enjoy it!
“I like it here. But what about you? You’re just gonna pack up and leave Manhattan?” Steve asks, searching the alpha’s face for any indication that he would be against the idea of moving.
“No!”
Pepper smiles and nods, then she leaves to give him space.
“And here I was thinking she was daddy’s girl,” Steve chuckles.
Bucky frowns and pulls away. “Who the hell is Little Sammy?”
“You okay, Cap?” Sam questions, giving Steve a lookover. “You look like crap.”
Thank you for reading!
Everything needed to be perfect. Well, at least that’s what Natasha wanted. She had taken it upon herself to plan the baby shower. Not that Steve or Tony minded. They understood her excitement for their newest family member.
Steve nods and leans closer so that he can place his own kisses along the alpha’s mark. Tony’s breath hitches and he tilts his neck to the side, offering the omega more access.
“I don’t know,” Steve replies, his own voice just as breathy. He turns toward Tony, their eyes meeting. “Should we do this?”
“I’m pretty sure Pepper has said that before. Come on, Steve. Let me do something nice for you.”
The first night is the hardest. Tony’s already awake by the time he hears Peter’s stirring. Pausing his work, Tony lays his Stark pad down and glances over, finding his son whimpering and squirming in the bassinet. Tony doesn’t even wait for the real crying to start before he’s reaching over to take his son into his arms.
Bucky chuckles. “The guy would’ve had to date, kid. You were enough.”
“Can I-” Steve is almost hesitant to ask and he stops himself abruptly.
“He won’t find you. He has no clue that you’re here with me. I’m sure I’m the last person he’d expect. You’ve never met any of the other alphas right?” Tony asks and Steve nods his head. “See? He won’t even think twice about me. You and the baby are fine.”
Bruce sighs. “Promise me if something happens, whether that’s with the pregnancy or your situation, that you tell me.”
The way Steve closes in on himself indicates that he’s uncomfortable talking about his torture. Tony doesn’t want to learn anymore if it’s going to upset him. At least, for now anyway. He’s still intrigued and wants to know more about Steve’s past, but he’d save that conversation for a later time.
Bucky forces a small smile. “I’ll be fine, but thanks anyway. Maybe one day I’ll get another chance.”
Steve hesitates for a moment, then he says, “I don’t want to give up. I want a baby.”
“It hurts, Buck.” Steve whimpers.
“I know what we did. No one else is going to find out about it or I swear to God I’ll-”
He’s busy in the lab working out the bugs of his newest hologram. It’s more family friendly, exactly to Steve’s liking. Tony stops himself when JARVIS alerts him of a visitor. He turns in his seat at the sound of the passcode being entered. Peter comes into the room, a bright smile on his face.
At those words Tony is giving him his attention. He lets out a sigh. “Don’t worry about it. It was my fault. Sometimes I say stupid things.”
“I guess I need to have your suit made. The other one was meant as a birthday present.”
“Tony’s on his way. I can drive you to a hospital-” Happy begins to say, but Steve shakes his head.
“Yeah. We’ll talk when he gets back.”
Peter takes his plate to the sink and then rushes to his room to grab his backpack. He takes a moment to compose himself before exiting his room and heading back downstairs.
“I know it hurts but keep breathing.”
“You have no food. I might’ve…” Steve trails off, eyes landing on the plate with his half eaten sandwich.
The alpha smirks smugly and applies more pressure, searching for that spot that he knows will have Steve coming in seconds. He finds it on the next thrust, the tip of his finger brushing against the bundle of nerves and provoking a loud moan past Steve’s lips. The omega’s back arches and his hands grip the sheets, twisting the cotton tightly.
“Tony?” Bruce’s voice breaks through the quiet and both Peter and Tony peer up at him. He’s fiddling nervously with his fingers, but there’s a hint of a smile on his face. Tony immediately jumps to his feet and Peter follows. “He’s stable now. They said you can see him,” Bruce informs.
“Don’t be,” Sam assures. Then he’s asking, “So what brings you here? I know this is the difficult part but we’re not here to judge okay? We’re here to lift each other up.”
Tony struggles to keep the act up. There was only so much he could take until he broke and fucked everything up. He had already made a mess by letting Steve get too attached and too far along. The pain of losing this one was going to be the worst yet.
“You don’t sound sure.”
“Fine, sir. He’s warming up.”
Tony squeezes his eyes shut. He wants to ask about Steve’s death, but he doesn’t. He didn’t need Peter to relive that moment.
Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this! Sorry for the wait!
“I guess you have a point. Tell you what, after I’m done with these I’ll play with you and Pete can hang out with mommy. Sound good?”
“Good,” Tony turns back to the suit. He gestures for the picture in Peter’s hand and he studies it closely. “So is Spider-Man going to be the next Captain America? Sorry. I heard a little bit of your conversation...never mind.”
He’d just have to keep trying, keep his fingers crossed. He just needed a little faith.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, a hint of worry in his tone. Peter doesn’t want him to worry and fret. It was overbearing at times.
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’m gonna be the bigger person here and walk away. And by the way I can make myself food. I’ll make a sandwich right now.”
“Take it easy,” Steve says softly and helps Tony back into his original position. With Tony lying back down, Steve lowers himself back in the chair the room provided. It wasn’t very comfortable but it beat Hydra’s base.
Between the combination of witnessing Tony coming undone and feeling it was all Steve needed to reach his own release. He cums with a grunt, hips stuttering as he unloads himself deep inside Tony.
But now, just hours away from meeting his little boy, Tony was doubting himself. He never doubted his abilities as an inventor because it was something he was good at. He didn’t even know if he was capable of being a good father.
Steve smiles. He’ll never grow tired of hearing Tony referring to the pups as his. It makes him love his mate even more. If that was even possible.
Tony’s almost there. Steve must sense it too because he wraps a hand around the shaft, stroking it the way Tony likes. The combination of Steve’s hot mouth and the friction of his hand is what brings Tony over the edge. He grunts and holds Steve’s head down as he releases in his mouth.
Pepper doesn’t appear convinced, not that Tony was expecting her to buy his lie.
Tony nods as he considers this. “True,” he says then turns to his mate. “How does that sound? It’ll just be one interviewer.”
“Dad, I got an-” Morgan tries to say only for her younger brother to cut in.
Natasha turns the page, showing off the first ultrasound picture Steve had saved and of another of his belly when he had first started to show.
They were amazing kids.
Tony groans.
“Don’t apologize. Look, let’s forget about it. I know you probably want to eat or sleep. I’ll leave you to it.”
Bruce is still frowning. “Okay?” He says, sounding a little unsure. Tony smiles and pats his friend on the shoulder to reassure him. It works and Bruce is relaxing.
Sam returns a few minutes later with clothes that are much too big but Peter accepts them with a smile.
“You what?” Tony asks, frowning as his large brain struggles to comprehend the words Steve has just told him. “You want to try again?”
Steve frowns. “I hope you’re lying.”
“She almost said papa,” Steve informs. “We’re working on it.”
“She’s coming, Tony. She said she’d be here soon.”
“Not even a little?”
“You can.”
“He’s on his way. I’m sorry to do this but I can’t right now.”
“What?” Steve asks, poking his head into the room. “What’s wrong?”
“How am I supposed to look?”
There were still different opinions about their former teammate. Everyone knew where Bucky stood and getting him to sit down and participate in the discussion wasn't simple. But it was something that needed to be done. At least not for them but for their youngest member.
Great. Guess there was no point in Tony asking if the results were accurate. Three positive tests was enough proof.
“Steve, do something about that dog. He won’t even let me kiss you,” Tony complains.
Tony rolls his eyes. Damn stubborn super soldier.
“I know.” Tony nods and takes a sip from his mug, sighing softly when his body gets a dose of caffeine. “We’ll eventually get her on a schedule,” he says.
“Maybe next time.” Steve agrees and he glances down at his son. “But right now I’m good.”
Tony pulls out and rolls over to lie beside Steve, completely spent from their round of fucking. “Fuck,” Tony pants, running his fingers through his already disheveled hair. “That was-remind me why we’re ending this?”
“Hey. Buck has the pizza if you’re still hungry,” she says.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says with a small smile.
“I know that look. Something happened.”
“Did you get taller?” Tony immediately turns to joking. He’s uncomfortable, wishing he could leave and never come back. His lake house beckons him, offering him tranquility and no ass whooping of any kind.
Peter huffs. “‘M not little.”
“You should’ve gone.” Tony’s eyes glance down at the wound on Steve’s side, noticing the large red stain.
A commotion ahead has Steve back in defense mode. He takes the first incoming men down with a combination of his shield and his fighting skills until there’s only one of them left. Steve half expects the man to drop his weapon and run in the opposite direction, but Steve isn’t that lucky and the fight continues, all while the compound falls around them.
“Or living room.”
Tony is careful when he takes Steve’s hand, not wanting to wake him from the only good sleep he’s going to have for a while. He soothingly smoothes his thumb over Steve’s knuckles, his fingers then gliding over the spot where he plans to put a gold band one day.
It shouldn’t matter how he looks, but yet he finds himself beating himself up every second of every day. His daughter was a month old and yet he still couldn’t bounce back to what he used to be before she arrived.
The rest of the ride is silent. Steve keeps his gaze out the window, refusing to look anywhere else. Tony watches him with interest, taking in the way his face screws together in confusion when they pass by the large buildings and billboards.
Steve shakes his head. “This is my mission.”
Pepper smiles. “How’s the baby? Tony hasn’t stopped gushing about him.”
Tony’s said it a thousand times, and he’ll say it again. He wished he could go back and change what he did and the pain he caused.
He was laid out on the bench, restrained with his arms and legs spread out, giving Tony the perfect view of his leaking hole. It’s tempting to rut up against him and fuck the omega, but Tony holds off.
Tony curses to himself as he tries to remember what floor his son was on. He wishes he had Jarvis to aid him right about now. He misses his friend and makes a promise to create him a bigger hard drive once he gets home.
The room is colder than the rest of the apartment, but the change in temperature goes ignored. The first thing Tony notices is how clean and organized the space is. It was obvious that this room was off limits. It’s not packed away in boxes like the other rooms Tony had seen on the tour.
A loud boom fills the base, the walls and floors shaking. Steve loses his balance and stumbles forward, one hand flying out to grasp onto the wall for support.
“Join me. I’m sure we can work out some form of agreement. After all, you are Hydra’s prized omega. We need you.”
“I know. It hurts for me too. You’re not the only one.”
“Good.” Steve moves past Tony to get to the fridge. He opens it and pulls out a water bottle. “Glad I was finally able to do one today.”
Steve hates that his first thought is Hydra. They weren’t a threat anymore, and yet Steve can’t help but fear that they have something to do with his family’s absence. Maybe he wasn’t as healed as he thought.
Tony pulls back so that their eyes can meet. “Yes you can.”
“It’s okay,” Tony soothes. He grunts softly and Steve lifts his head, noticing the pain written on Tony’s face. It wasn’t right that Tony was suffering too and Steve could do nothing about it. “Worry about you for once,” Tony says.
company but not for a birthday party?”
Peter groans and Steve quickly nudges Tony a little harder to shut him up.
Happy sighs again. “I didn’t mean it like that. I don’t know you and I guess I judged before giving you a chance. Obviously you’re not using Tony. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him like this before.”
“She really misses you,” Tony says once they’re in Steve’s private room. Not much has changed since the last time Tony saw it. The only difference was the black sketch book sitting on the little nightstand beside Steve’s bed.
James is sitting on the bed, watching as his younger siblings play. Steve can tell he wants to join, but he’s holding back. Steve can’t wait for the day when all of his children are comfortable around him.
Peter flushes. “Right.”
“We were at least in college and-”
But he doesn’t get home until close to dinner. She hears him come in and is ready to rush down the stairs to greet him, but then she hears the argument between her parents and decides now wasn’t the time.
Peter jumps up and begins gathering the supplies, tucking them back neatly into the kit.
“Okay. Obviously that’s not going to cut it. He can help. And I promise you can trust him.”
“I’ll do my best,” Bucky assures and he kisses Sam hand.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve says, gently patting the genius on the chest. Tony opens his eyes and turns his head to meet Steve’s gaze. “He’s not so bad. I wish you would just give him a chance.”
“You kinda already have.”
Hope you all are doing well! ❤️
Steve is admitted and the doctor orders an ultrasound. Tony’s leg shakes nervously as he awaits the news. His anxiety appears normal to everyone around him. He resembles that of a stressed and worried father. But the truth was he couldn’t care less about the child in Steve’s womb. He wasn’t hoping that the baby was alive and healthy. He was hoping for the opposite.
“All done, Petey. Shh, it’s okay.” Steve picks him up and cuddles him close, all while whispering softly to him.
“Hey, Pete.” Bucky quickly wipes at his eyes. “What are you doing up so early?”
Steve chuckles. “Tony Junior?”
But he’s tricked once again.
“Good morning, Peter,” Jarvis’ polite tone fills Peter’s ears.
“Okay. Look, I know we just met and you probably don’t trust me, but I want to help you out.”
Coulson smiles softly and steps closer. “I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Rogers,” he says. Steve must look every bit as confused as he feels because the beta quickly adds, “Fighting for omega’s and their rights really means a lot. My mother was an omega. You’re an inspiration.”
Steve remains silent. He doesn’t tell Tony that he’s terrified of bringing their baby home. He doesn’t tell him how unsure and worried he is.
When the next contraction starts, he blows out a breath and leans forward, pushing as hard as he can. This time he can’t conceal his cries of pain and a scream rips through his throat. He uses both hands to grasp the baby, and with another strong push and yell, he delivers the pup from his body.
“You’ll figure it out. You can do this.”
They just weren’t meant to be.
Steve backs away from, his attention falling on his son when he whimpers. “Shh,” he soothes and cradles his son close. “I’m here. You’re safe now.”
Steve shakes his head.
They clean up together, then settle in the living room. Tony pours himself a glass of wine while Steve sips from his glass of water. The conversation of their parents comes up, a topic Tony had been hoping to avoid.
“Two months is enough time, right?” Tony asks, the sound of his voice snapping Steve from his thoughts. The omega peers up at him, a small frown already forming. “What? Too soon or not soon enough?”
They make their way outside and into the parking lot where Steve’s black Audi is parked. He’s still not used to getting around in something so flashy. Back in his day he relied on his motorcycle, and that had been enough for him. But Tony had insisted Steve have something new and modern.
It’s nice having Steve this close. Tony wraps one arm around him, enjoying holding him in his arms. They’re surrounded in silence, and for a moment Tony wonders if Steve has finally drifted off.
“I mean it. If I could take you with me I would.”
“Stop!” Peter cries out in frustration. Both adults fall silent and finally acknowledge him. “Stop yelling.”
He seals that promise with a kiss to Peter’s head.
Thank you for being patient! Hope you enjoy! 😊
The next present is from Sam, which Steve is quick to thank him for. They were going to need a diaper bag and plenty of diapers to go in it.
“No, I mean it. You need to go to these meetings. They’re helping, right?”
“Okay at least give me a genre.”
“I like Peter,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. “I mean, if you don’t then we can figure out something else and-”
Bucky nods and casts his gaze down to hide the tears in his eyes. Sam notices and reaches for Bucky’s hand, pulling him close until he can wrap both arms around him.
The only thing furnishing the room is an old wooden breeding bench. Tony’s heard stories about them, but he never thought he’d see one.They had stopped being used years ago. They were humiliating and unfair to omegas. It was inhuman. The times have changed and there was no reason for omegas to be strapped down and bred anymore.
Steve relaxes at those words.
“No,” Peter answers with a heavy sigh. “I’m working on it. My parents know.”
“She’s going to miss you like crazy,” Tony says, coming over to take the spot beside Steve. He tests out the comfort of the bed, frowning when it doesn’t even compete with the bed back home. The bed he now has to fall asleep in alone every night.
“Among other things.” Steve doesn’t deny it. Natasha would see through that too.
Tony holds up a large brown paper bag. Peter’s interest piques and he steps closer to accept the bag from his dad’s outstretched hand.
“What do you mean we-”
“Yeah.” Tony nods his head in agreement. “I’m working on it. I don’t have what you’re used to...yet.”
“I know, but we haven’t had any time together since she was born, and it’s obvious you need a break.”
Flash turns and leaves, and that’s when Peter lets the tears fall. He turns toward the sink and grips the edge tightly, his eyes flooding with tears and streaming down his face. He sobs quietly, his body trembling with each sob that escapes him. His stomach churns and he rushes into the nearest stall, emptying his stomach of the little content it has.
“I know that!” Steve finally raises his own voice. “I know he’s young but so was I, Tony. We both were.”
“I thought I was supposed to be Spider-Man,” Steve frowns.
That brings another smile to Steve’s face. “I’m trying.”
Steve jumps at the new voice and turns around. The last person he was expecting to find was Tony.
“I know,” Tony takes both of Steve’s hands and gives them a reassuring squeeze. “I know I’m probably disregarding those baby steps but I want you here. With you and Pete I feel...it feels like we’re a family.”
“Steve wouldn’t have gone if it wasn’t important,” Bruce says.
This chapter is just some fluffy stuff. I love writing Steve and Tony as parents because it’s so soft and cute! I’m used to writing more angsty things so I wanted some fluff. Which this story will have most of in the beginning until the angst comes in.
“He would,” Peter smiles.
“I know. I’m doing my best to keep him and our son safe,” Tony says.
“You should go home.”
“H-hey,” Peter stutters out a response. He tries the lock again, mentally cursing to himself when he fails a third time.
“It’s okay,” Tony says and kisses Steve’s temple, “maybe it just wasn’t meant to happen.”
Tony frowns. “Honey, you need to eat.”
Tony peers up at the familiar voice, finding his mate lingering near the doorway of the room. Steve gives him a small smile and steps further inside, making his way toward them.
He had never expected to have such strong feelings for Steve. Falling in love wasn’t something that happened very often for Tony. He was reserved and decided being alone was better than risking hurting someone he loved. But Steve opened new doors for him, showed him that love did exist and that he wouldn’t have to go through this life alone.
“I made him an appointment to see Bruce next week,” Steve says as he starts rinsing off the plates to stick them into the dishwasher.
“Sure. I haven’t been in...forever but yeah it sounds fun. You’re going to make me wear the mouse ears, huh?”
Steve tosses and turns, head rolling from side to side and fingers twisting into the cotton sheets. His chest is rising and falling heavily, breathy pants leaving his slightly parted lips. His heart pounds in his chest, the organ close to bursting through.
“Yeah?” Tony’s intrigued. “When?”
Then he hears it.
Steve appears beside him and orders a beer. He thanks the man and leans against the counter, his gaze landing on Tony.
“Hey, Pete,” Steve greets with a soft smile. His smile falters quickly when he takes in his son’s appearance. “That bad, huh?”
“I was being sarcastic. You scared the poor kid half to death!”
Tony nods and leans down to kiss Peter on the head, then he turns and leaves. Steve finishes up with Peter, burps him and makes sure he is comfortable before putting him down for the night. He takes a moment to prepare himself before entering Tony’s room.
Tony ponders the idea for a moment. “Maybe we’ll get lucky and I won’t get pregnant. I’m kidding,” he quickly adds when Steve frowns up at him. He kisses Steve again. “I want to do this for you.”
“Or I can look one more time? You need a name, buddy.”
Their shopping trip had been a bust and Tony wondered if maybe Steve had been right. Maybe they did have time. So they decide to wait.
“Okay,” Bucky says. “If that’s what you want.”
Peter smiles. There was no denying that Ned would be the best uncle in the whole entire world. His uncles were the coolest, and Ned would definitely be right up there with them.
“Asleep too. The check up really upset them. They’re okay...for the most part. The bruises will fade but I don’t think the rest will. Not yet.”
Tony doesn’t answer.
He’s not officially alone. His friends are there, just like they promised they would. Peter may only have one parent raising him, but he had the Avengers. And that was better.
Pepper storms over and slaps him hard across the cheek. Tony’s head whips to the side and he turns back at her, wide eyed and with a stinging cheek.
“I’m thinking that there’s this poor guy who needs my help and I can’t just throw him back into the cold. He has no one. And I mean literally no one.”
Bruce huffs. “Fine. I’ll run some tests. I’m guessing you want me coming by regularly, huh?”
“She’ll be okay. Just relax and enjoy tonight.” Tony smiles and brings Steve’s hand up to his lips, placing a kiss to the soft skin.
“But, dad-”
“You always play with my hands when you’re thinking.”
“Sorry. Those weren’t the orders.” Brock smirks and yanks Tony to his feet, emitting a groan from the smaller alpha. He shoves Tony forward and out of the house.
Now it’s Tony’s turn to grow confused. “But you said you-Wait, you have no idea who I am, do you?”
He just wishes he didn’t have to feel like shit.
Peter glances around, relieved to find that no one has given him any attention. He gestures for Ned to follow and together they make their way through the front doors and toward the closest restroom.
“I love you.”
“Hey. It’s just me. No ones here, Steve. He’s not here.”
Aww Peter is getting attached. I can't wait for Flash to see the photo. Maybe he'll come around...
This time he does sob and he prays the rest of the restroom is empty. He already gets picked on. He didn’t need someone-especially Flash Thompson-to find him crying like a little baby in the bathroom.
Morgan rests her head on his shoulder, her cries dying down until they’re little hiccups. Steve continues to soothe her until the tears in her eyes have dried up.
“Relax,” Sam places a hand over Peter’s shoulder to calm him. “He’s just giving you a hard time. If you want to go to school there that’s fine.”
Tony sighs heavily and leans back in his seat, one hand coming up to scrub harshly over his face. “Yeah. I know, buddy. Sorry. I’m just...I don’t know.”
“Guess they are. But don’t worry. I found someone else.”
He grunts when the pressure becomes too much and he finds his body bearing down on its own. His eyes go wide and he tries to stand up straight, only to drop down to a squat.
Happy shushes Peter harshly. “He’s fine. What I mean is…he’s dealing with a lot. He’s been a mess for years, way before you. But now that you’re here…”
“Thank you. She was a good person. The best. I named my daughter after her.”
As he got older, his interest in his birthday wasn’t the same. He didn’t have his mother to celebrate it with him anymore. He still had his best friend and then eventually he lost him too. After Hydra there was no point. They couldn’t care less about the day he was born and they sure as hell weren’t going to let him watch the fireworks. He’d be left alone in his room with only the memories from past birthdays on his mind.
“Hey, Cap. You miss me already?”
He didn’t need to ask to know what they were fighting about. It was obvious that their current argument involved him. It made Peter feel worse about his situation.
“Where’s Steve?” Natasha asks, taking small steps toward him until she’s occupying the other cushion.
“No, Petey, you’re not,” Steve assures with a soft smile. He joins Peter on the couch and wraps an arm around him, bringing him close and pressing his lips to his son’s messy hair.
“Uh sure.”
Steve can’t help but frown at the response he receives. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
“I’m scared to be honest. A baby is...well, you know how much work babies are.”
“Unless the pup is yours?”
“So you did that to show you were stronger than alphas?”
“Don’t worry about it. You shouldn’t even be apologizing. Tony hasn’t told me much, but he mentioned you being in a...toxic relationship.”
Steve stops to think it over. New York was home and he never imagined leaving Brooklyn during his time there. But the plans to stay in his childhood home were destroyed when Hydra took control of his life. He was at least grateful that Alpha kept him in New York.
“I don’t have those anymore. It’s been-”
She stops at the last door on the right and Tony steps away, scanning the badge he had stolen off the dead Hydra soldier. The door opens and Tony gestures for the woman to enter first. She does as she’s told, small sobs escaping her every now and again.
Clint curses and slams his fist down on the kitchen counter. “And what about him?” He gestures to the sleeping boy. “Wasn’t he more important?”
“I-I can’t. I’m not like you.”
“Tony, this isn’t going to be enough. If his alpha-”
Steve directs his gaze on the ceiling, already growing embarrassed. He’s never talked to an A.I. before.
Steve huffs and sits up. “We’re working on it. He’s getting close. He’s learning new words too.”
Steve gasps when Tony’s hand slides down to his waist, and he jumps, pulling away from the unexpected touch.
“You’re too much, Rogers. Do you want to give me a heart attack?” Tony teases.
“There’s my two favorite people,” Tony says when he enters the room. Morgan tries to turn at the sound of the familiar voice. Steve assists by turning her so that she can face Tony. Her face lights up. “Hi, Maguna. You having fun with papa?”
Tony watches her while she sleeps, smiling softly and heart bursting with love for her. He never knew he could love something so much. The fears and doubts he had no longer existed when she was curled up in his arms.
“Those don’t exist. We’ll never be perfect, but I know we can be happy. Look how different things have been since Peter-” Steve stops himself when he notices a shadow cross over Tony’s face. “Tony-”
Steve doesn’t even wait for her to finish and he jumps out of bed, cursing to himself when he trips over one of his shoes. He fumbles through the dark, searching blindly for his other shoe. FRIDAY assists by turning on the bedroom light.
“Pep, he said-”
Peter shakes his head at the bantering and continues to sort through the movies. His eyes fill with tears when he comes across their ridiculously huge Disney collection. His papa had been alive when Disney released their first film, and that’s when Peter figures his love for Disney started. They used to curl up on the sofa and watch Disney films together. His papa loved catching up on what he missed, and he made sure his son was there to experience it with him.
Peter doesn’t even make an attempt to get back up. The mat was comfortable and he was able to catch his breath from the floor. His eyes shoot open when he senses someone nearby and he glances up, connecting them with green.
The outburst is surprising and leaves Tony confused. They’ve had conversations in the past about Steve pumping. It had just been an idea, and at the time Steve had seemed to consider it. Now, though, Tony was learning that he had been wrong.
Tony can’t help but smile as Peter tells him everything about his childhood. Peter’s face would light up and the smile he wore was infectious. Tony noticed from day one that he had Steve’s smile. It was bright and lit up a room. It was the kind of smile that made you want to do the same.
“What does that have to do with-”
Steve nods. His daughter would always be worth it. He doesn’t regret her.
“You should’ve let me go,” Steve whispers. He continues to smooth his thumb over Tony’s hand, hoping the contact would be enough to coax Tony awake. There’s no response, but that doesn’t stop Steve from gently squeezing his hand. He gasps softly when Tony squeezes back.
Steve gives a small shrug in response and turns back toward the stove to flip the pancake. “I know today’s the shower and I just thought you’d like a special breakfast. This day is about you.”
“You don’t?” Natasha asks.
Steve ignores the warning, baring his own teeth and moving toward the alpha. Rumlow keeps the gun aimed, but Steve knows he won’t pull the trigger. The alpha tries to keep his composure but despite his efforts, Steve can both see and smell his fear.
“Okay,” Tony smiles. “Let’s get you a really cool suit.”
Peter sighs and glances down at his lap, fidgeting with his fingers. Tony peers over at him again, more guilt washing over him at the sight he finds.
“Okay. I hope you find what you’re looking for.”
They don’t make it to the kitchen. Steve’s phone dings on the way, forcing him to put his son down so he can check the message. Nick’s name appears on the screen and Steve sighs.
It didn’t make sense.
“I sort of already do.”
Tony tenses, remembering that phone call vividly. It was the one phone call he regrets not answering the most. It was the voicemail he can’t bring himself to listen to again.
“Yes,” Tony assures. He slips one hand free from Steve’s to reach up and wipe the tears from Steve’s face. “I want you to be happy. That’s all that matters.”
It couldn’t be him. No. It had to be someone else. But he’s the only person that makes sense. He’s the other scent Steve can smell.
Tony watches her leave as he takes another drink. The feelings he had for her were strong, but the ones he had reserved for Steve were stronger. It was always going to be Steve.
He finds the common room empty and plops down in the arm chair. For months no one has dared sit in that spot, but he felt he deserved to. He felt he deserved a lot of things, having life not fuck him over so much was one, but he knew he couldn’t have that.
Steve tips his head back, letting it rest against the wall. His heart is racing and the grip he has on the knife is loosening. It almost slips through his fingers.
There was a moment of doubt and self worth, but little by little he was finding his place in the world. His papa had believed he could do great things, whether that was as Spider-Man or just by being Peter. He didn’t want to let his papa down, so he started to work hard to become the hero he was destined to be.
“We didn’t forget about you, Petey.” Steve kisses his son’s cheek again.
“Oh?” Tony’s brow raises. “What are you some sort of whiz kid?”
“Tony, I’m sorry. I swear if I would’ve known-”
“Did he tell you about them?” Tony gestures to the little family.
“It’s okay,” Sam assures softly, his hand soothingly trailing up and down Bucky’s back. “I don’t care about the sink. Just you.”
“I’ve never been so sure. It was always going to be you, Tony. After everything we’ve been through…”
“I’m ready. I need to be there for my son.”
His reasoning wasn’t because kids could be a handful and alter his life greatly (though those were some factors). It was his childhood and the relationship he had with his own father that made Tony say fuck it on kids and decide to be single forever.
Tony hums. “I bet I can taste like something else.”
Pepper sighs and leans in closer to get another look at the cut and bruises on Tony’s face. “How much did you drink again? Do you even remember anything?”
“I’m fine, Tony. I promised Pete a movie and-”
Wrong words. Steve mentally scolds himself. That little voice reminds him of the feelings he has for the alpha. He argues with it. He doesn’t have any feelings for Tony. They were just strangers.
, the voice in the back of Steve’s head reminds.
“I was thinking about protecting you and that baby.”
The task of birthing their son comes easier now that Tony has Steve by his side. He relies on his husband’s soothing words and gentle touches to help him get through the painful experience. It’s still difficult to fathom that Steve had been in the same position.
“Not exactly.” Steve pecks Tony on the lips before pulling away and rushing to turn on his old record player, filling the room with a tune from back in the day. He joins Tony again and holds out a hand for him. “Dance with me.”
“Shh!” Tony shushes harshly. “He can-”
“They need a new leader,” Steve says and he places one hand over his belly. “And they think this baby is it.”
“Apologize to him.”
“You can do it, Uncle Bucky,” Peter assures. “If my papa could then so can you. You’re already doing an amazing job.”
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony pants, his grip on Steve’s hips tightening. “You look so good riding my cock. Does it feel good?”
“You look amazing.” Tony’s smile appears to get bigger, more vibrant when he takes Steve’s hand. “Is this new?” Tony’s roaming eyes has Steve blushing almost instantly.
“Don’t. It’s not your fault. I don’t blame you. I’d never blame you. I’m sorry you went through all of that. I’m sorry you needed me and I couldn’t be there like I was supposed to. You told me you were drowning and I didn’t pull you up to the surface. I’ll never forgive myself. But I promise I’m here now. I’ll pull you up, and I’ll never let your hand go.”
Tony nods and glances down at his son, chuckling when he finds Peter alert and staring at him. “Guess you’re awake now, huh? Papa is asleep so it’s just you and me, kiddo. Wait until you meet the rest of the family. Especially Dodger. You’re going to love him. But be careful because he drools.”
“I’m saying that you make the best of your situation. Believe me there were times when I wanted to say fuck it and give up, but I didn’t. You’ll figure this out. And I know it seems scary because of the kid…” Tony trails off and directs his attention back to the half-eaten slice of pizza.
Knowing there was no point in lying, Peter nods. “Do you guys have to go? Isn’t there anyone else? Uncle Thor can do it, right?”
Tony sits up and wipes away the lingering gel from his belly, grimacing at the mess. “I guess this wasn’t so bad. I don’t know why I was expecting something else.”
Rumlow and Rollins are ordered into the room and Steve is tossed in their direction.
“You’re not wrong. I’ve had other...guests up here before. But it’s not what you think. For one I’ve never let anyone raid my closet and steal my old college sweatshirt.”
Steve smiles. “It was perfect.”
“Just don’t hurt him again,” Pepper points a threatening finger in Tony’s direction, then she turns on her heels and heads toward the door. She opens it, turns back around and says, “And call Rhodey.”
If it meant making Steve happy, then Tony would do it. He wouldn’t hurt him or their unborn baby this time.
“I’ll be back before dinner,” Peter says and he pulls away. “I promise.”
Tony enjoys the comfort the bed has to offer. It doesn’t beat the one he sleeps on every night upstairs, but it would do for the next couple of days.
“Go to sleep, honey,” Tony tells him. “I got Pete.”
He shoves aside the conversation he had with Jarvis and focuses on the design plans for his son’s room. For a moment he’s able to get lost in the project, but not for long.
He keeps his eyes fixated on the ceiling as the doctor works between his legs, checking for any damage. She must not find anything wrong and she sits back in her stool, straightening her back and removing the gloves.
“I didn’t want to lie!” Peter is quick to defend himself. “But I knew how angry you’d get about him and I guess I just figured it’d be safer if you didn’t know.”
There was no pain.
“Not you?” Steve asks, his voice quiet. He lets his hand roam over Tony’s chest again.
Tony glances over his shoulder to give his husband a reassuring smile. Steve only shakes his head and returns back to cleaning up the kitchen.
“What?” Sam immediately notices the frown on Bucky’s face. “What’s wrong?”
“Happy, what’s up?”
He can’t.
“Right.” Steve nods. He’s gotten better about leaving Peter with one of their friends. Being a parent had many rough days and break was something Steve found himself needing.
“Honey!” Tony calls out, only to be greeted with silence. He sighs and moves through the apartment, following the cries of his daughter.
“I got her.” Tony comes closer and Steve passes their sleeping baby to him. She squirms, soft whimpers leaving her pouty lips when she’s disturbed. “It’s okay, sweetheart,” Tony coos, and he brings her over to the crib, gently laying her down.
“He is.” Tony smiles down at his sleeping son. “He’s perfect.”
“Did my...did he know?”
Steve ignores the comments and stares, his focus entirely on his husband. He places a hand over Tony’s shoulder, rubbing the spot soothingly. Tony eventually pulls away and leans back in his chair.
“I’ll get it.”
They’re both so lost in each other that they fail to hear the door open. It’s not until someone clears their throat does Sam notice. He curses and shoves Bucky off, earning a glare from his husband when he hits the floor.
“I’ll help you,” she tells her brother. His face lights up and he cheers. “But you better help or I’m never doing this again.”
“I’m staying with Bucky tonight.” Is all Steve says, then he’s turning away and heading into the bathroom. Tony follows, watching from the doorway as Steve gathers a few items from the room.
Tony cups his face and softly strokes his cheeks. “You did so good, baby. It was hot.”
“No,” Tony shakes his head, “you hold him. You need the comfort.”
“Then comply,” Brock snarls. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”
Unable to form any words, Steve is only able to nod his head. The alpha growls when his knot gets too big and he shoves it inside. Steve moans loudly against Tony’s neck when he’s stretched from the large knot. Tony’s hips stutter for a moment until his body grows taut and his cock spills deep inside his mate. Steve follows soon after, his own cock spurting against his belly.
Peter shrugs in response. “I don’t know. There was nothing good.”
The click of heels against the floor is what captures Steve’s attention and he glances up, finding Pepper entering the kitchen. She smiles politely and makes her way over to the island where the bottle of wine has been left out. She pours some into her glass.
Tony smiles against Steve’s shoulder and trails his lips a little higher, placing a kiss on the back of Steve’s neck. “I wish you’d let me see you. You’re so beautiful.”
“Because it’s my job. I have to keep you safe.”
Steve turns away from the gorgeous view to meet Tony’s eyes. This view was even better.
“Yeah.”
“Hang on. He’s calling.”
“I noticed,” Peter leans back in his seat and folds his arms over his chest.
Pleased with his answer, Pepper leaves to join the party.
Turning away from them, Tony scans the vast property for something else to test his new invention on. The older pups join in, pointing in various directions and simultaneously yelling at their father to blow up another tree or a big rock.
And yet he didn’t even know the whole story. He didn’t know how they met or why. The bit of information Steve did give him wasn’t enough to paint the whole picture. Pieces were still missing from the puzzle.
“Good,” Bruce encourages from between the omega's legs. “Remember to breathe.”
“It’s going to be okay. We’ll help you. Just tell us what you want to do.”
Steve regrets letting him go.
Another contraction begins to build, not giving Steve a break from the last one, and he cries out from the intense pain. Bucky can only hold him and encourage him.
Sorry that this chapter was on the short side and Tony wasn’t in it. I just wanted to show what everyone else is up to and Peter’s life with them. There will be more scenes like that. But Tony will be in the next one! If that matters. I know he’s on the shit list 😂
“That’s payback,” Peter chuckles.
“Hmm.” Tony frowns and finishes the chocolate. “J, where is my adorable husband?”
His stomach is upset again, but this time Peter doesn’t pin the blame on his morning sickness. He was nervous, more so than he’s ever been. For the first time in his life he was ditching school. Not once has he ever gone against the rules, but today he had no choice but to be rebellious.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s purring.” Steve can’t help but smile at the sound. “Tony, he’s-he’s happy.”
“I hurt all of them.” Steve’s bottom lip quivers and his eyes grow misty.
“I’m sorry but did you say baby?”
“There he is!” Ned whispers harshly and tugs at Peter’s sleeve.
“You okay there, bud?” Steve asks and Peter turns toward him. “You zoned out. Bruce asked how you’re doing.”
“I don’t think keeping you hidden is a good idea. You really don’t want to see what’s out there?” Tony asks as he screws open the lid to his bottle and takes a sip.
Steve smiles. “Okay.”
Then he sees her.
“I’ll take a break from work. My family needs me and it’s not just your job to take care of us. It’s my job too.”
“Wait! Darling, I’m kidding. You look good. Honest.”
. The voice in the back of his head mocks him.
Tony smirks and leans back in his seat, his arms folding over his chest. “You’re wondering too?”
Steve screams when sharp nails dig into his bond mark. He squirms in the alpha’s grasp, trying to break free but failing miserably.
Steve lifts his head in his husband’s direction, finding his worried gaze. Tony smiles softly and reaches out for his husband, using his hand to brush away the strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face.
“Not yet. You need a lot of training before that, kiddo. After our run we’ll go down to the training room-”
Pierce exits the elevator first and Tony is pushed out, losing his balance for a second before he’s caught and manhandled back into place. He growls when the hand around his shoulder squeezes too tight, and he’s rewarded with a smack to the back of the head.
“Take him and get him cleaned up. We’ll start again once he heals.”
James nods and takes another sip from his Mickey Mouse mug. “Me too!”
“But what if I’m the issue? You know how difficult I can be.”
“Two months? Tony, is that enough time?”
He grows curious and peeks into the room, his ears picking up a few shared words. He catches himself eavesdropping and quickly ducks back into the hall.
Tony chuckles and comes over, leaning down to press a kiss to the top to Steve’s head. “You’re almost there, honey. Two more weeks and then we’ll meet Peter.”
Oh Tony...I don’t know what to say. He’s a mess right now. Poor Peter just wants to know him and have a relationship. It’s going to take a lot of work(mostly on Tony’s part) for one to happen.
He doesn’t register the tears at first. It’s not until a wetness covers his hand does he notice the tear drop. Tony sniffs and wipes the tears from his face, and takes a deep breath to hold back any more that threaten to fall.
The elevator dings again and the doors open.
Tony does try to move away and it’s then he realizes the chains preventing him from moving very far. The shackles bind his wrists and a line of chains link together with the ones around his ankles. The chains are secured into the wall.
“You did so well with that alpha. He couldn’t resist you. Do you know how difficult it is for me? An omega like you is special. Any alpha would be lucky to have you. But you belong to me.”
Tony immediately senses the hurt and decides to change the subject. He doesn’t want to ask about Steve’s death when they were supposed to be celebrating his birth.
“I guess I better get going,” Tony says and rises to his feet.
“Yeah,” Steve says. Though his words don’t ease Tony’s worried mind. He shifts in his seat and his eyes squeeze shut. “I’ll be right back.”
The next chapter I can't decide if it should focus a bit on the team and maybe Bucky and Sam's issues, or just mix it in with what's going on with Peter and Tony. What sounds better?
“Yes,” Steve repeats. “I want...I want to get married.”
Tony sighs harshly. He can’t understand why Steve would want to try again after the traumatic experience he had a few months ago. But Steve was both stubborn and determined. There was no stopping him once he'd made up his mind.
The call ends, and with a huff, Tony scrubs a hand along his face. He wasn’t going to give up, not when he had a chance of making Steve feel like himself again. It would be easy to hire someone else to watch Morgan; he had the resources to do a proper background check to insure he hired the best, but that would be too time consuming.
“No. I’m sorry. You’re...not so bad.”
Tony pulls off Steve's lips and presses kisses to the corners of his mouth, then trailing down his jaw until he’s placing open-mouth kisses along Steve’s neck. The omega shudders, his body breaking out into goosebumps in reaction to what Tony was doing to him. Tony’s lips brush against his mating gland, eliciting a gasp from the omega.
Steve shakes his head with a chuckle. “Happy Valentine’s Day to you too.”
He takes a deep breath to calm himself, eyes squeezing shut when he says those three words. “I love you.”
Tony smiles. “He’s beautiful. Gosh, it’s so crazy that he’s here.”
“Why do you have to be so stubborn?” Tony smirks, leaning closer to brush his lips against Steve’s.
“Steve,” Tony says his mate’s name, but gets nothing in return. “Honey, look at me. Please?”
“Relax,” Steve soothes. With his free hand he reaches down to grip Tony’s cock, stroking it to distract Tony from the sting. He inches more of his finger inside, ears straining for any sounds of discomfort.
“I’m holding you to that.”
He would miss his dad and the time they spent together. He would miss their conversations. He would miss his dad’s jokes.
“It’s not. I don’t...Tony, I don’t...I’m so sorry.”
“I know. But listen to me, they won’t take anymore. They won’t take this one.”
“It’s me? That’s why you’re-”
“Wow. So I guess that explains how you’re alive in the modern world.”
Natasha hums in agreement and moves across the room to get a burp cloth; she already knew where everything was. She lays Peter over her shoulder and begins patting him, trying to stimulate a burp.
Steve thanks JARVIS on his way out. He takes each step down the stairs carefully, craning his neck in hopes of catching a glimpse of the alpha. He finds him lounging on the sofa, head down and obviously distracted with the same device he had seen the omega woman with earlier. He reaches the bottom of the stairs and cautiously shuffles closer, wringing his hands together nervously.
Steve huffs out a small laugh. “I’m not having this baby anytime soon.”
“It looks great.” Tony smiles and reaches out to gather a bit of frosting on his finger, bringing it to his mouth to taste. “Mmm. Good stuff. Great job, kid.”
He hasn’t had a sip from the bottle since his last encounter with Peter. It was difficult, especially when all he wanted to do was drink and forget about Steve. But forgetting Steve wasn’t something Tony could ever do. No matter how hard he tried.
“Uncle Bucky?”
“Honey, wait! I’m sorry. You look-”
Tony nods and leaves in search of his bodyguard. He doesn’t have to look very far, Happy is coming toward the door with the two bags.
“Sort of. But instead of being put in some zombie wasteland, you’re in the past.”
“Hey. Sorry, I know it’s late. Steve isn’t answering and-”
“I’m sorry,” Steve gives his condolences. He couldn’t imagine losing his mate. He’d be nothing without Tony.
Just as Tony had predicted, Dodger had been showing signs of protectiveness. It started out harmless, following Steve around the tower like he always did, and it wasn’t until Steve began showing did Dodger’s new behavior become worse. He was always around Steve, never leaving him out of his sight. Steve thought it was cute.
“I don’t know!” Steve yells. “He locks me in a room and that’s when the alphas come in. That’s when we mate.”
“You’re going to be okay. Tomorrow you meet with Dr. Strange. That’s good, right?”
His side of the closet has been emptied and a few items he’s accumulated over the years are missing from the apartment. Tony didn’t even bother to stop him.
“That’s a joke...right?”
Steve leaves and shuts the door behind him. Peter heaves out a sigh and slants back in his desk chair. His stomach churns and he places a hand over his belly.
“No problem, boss.” Happy gives an affirmative nod.
Steve chuckles and leans against the island. “Maybe I did. Sorry.”
His curse is what has all eyes on him again.
Steve knows better than to keep Tony waiting and he moves faster, harder. The room fills with the sound of their hips meeting and the delicious noises Tony produces from the rough fucking. Steve grips Tony’s hips, fingers digging into the soft flesh and leaving behind deep, purple marks. He realizes what he’s done almost immediately and loosens his grip. The last thing he wants to do is hurt Tony or the baby.
“Steve, I panicked and I’m sorry. I just...hey, it’s going to be okay. We’ll fix this. We’re a team, remember?”
Tony enters the apartment with a smile on his face and the keys to their new home in his hand. The first thing he hears is Morgan’s giggling followed by Steve laughing. The sound brings Tony to a halt. He hadn’t heard that sound in so long. Sometimes he wondered if he’d ever hear again.
“Perfect. Serve whatever you like and then we can watch tv or something, I don’t know. What do you and Tony normally do?”
Dodger lets out a huff, then he buries his nose against Steve’s stomach, barking softly and pawing at the area. Tony watches with interest, one brow raising in confusion. He’s never had Dodger act this way around him and he’s never seen it done before with Steve.
Tony rolls his eyes. “This is Peter’s room. I have a few ideas. Do you think he’ll like a larger twin bed or maybe a king?”
He spots Peter standing outside a room and his stomach twists at the sight of Natasha. She’s hugging Peter and telling him something Tony doesn’t hear, then she’s glancing up and her piercing green eyes are locking with his. She pulls away from Peter and he sits down in one of the provided chairs.
“Yeah. I needed to...yeah…”
Pepper gives a small shrug in response and she leans back, folding her arms over her chest. “Mr. Pierce said you suggested he bring you home.”
“I get it. You’re worried about going,” Bucky says.
“Is the baby okay?” Steve asks.
“I was in heat. They always make sure I’m in heat before bringing the next alpha in. I made you do it. I asked for it.”
It was wishful thinking.
Peter couldn’t be more relieved when the final bell rings and he’s dismissed. He finds Ned by the lockers and together they make their way through the hall and toward the double doors.
“Like you?” Steve interrupts. “If I remember clearly you didn’t give up anything. You still got to finish school and get a billion dollar company.”
“It’s my fault. I didn’t listen to you...I listened to...it doesn’t matter.”
“No, it was the president of the United States. Yes it was your dad,” Happy replies with a huff.
Steve Steve Steve. Why are you so stubborn! He’s being a butt but I guess he just doesn’t believe a baby could be responsible for his body’s changes. He’s convinced he can’t have a baby. Oh man is he in for a surprise 😆
“Good. How’s Petey?”
Tony blows out a breath and forces himself to ignore the nervous behavior. It was too late to call for anyone else. Peter would have to do it.
Steve whimpers when Tony gently helps him out of his ruined sweatpants. Tony bunches them up and tosses them in the corner of the room. The rest of the room goes ignored; Steve needs to be taken care of first.
Peter steps away and moves toward the ledge of the building, making sure to give the painted image one last glance before leaping off and swinging toward the large tower.
Steve sobs quietly, hoping and praying for a way out.
As if on cue, the front door is opening and Steve is stepping through. Relief washes over Tony at the sight of him.
“Not forever. I’m thinking of stepping away, for good this time. We can try living in Brooklyn, have a normal life.”
“But we’re just doing the basics. I’m not sending you out on any missions-”
“Because you’re not safe here. Not right now. I need to get you and that baby out of here.”
“It’s his fault.”
“Don’t apologize. I’m glad you did. I’m not glad I almost hit you but...you know what I mean.”
Steve smiles and leans up to connect their lips in a gentle kiss. He pulls away and Tony brings him back in for another. Tony rolls over until he’s hovering over Steve and he leans down to kiss him again. Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s neck, bringing him closer to deepen the kiss.
“Oh shit. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean-”
“You’re not wrong about that.” Bucky leans back and reaches for the remote to channel surf for a while. He’s bored in just a matter of minutes. “You hungry?”
Maybe they should’ve stayed at the compound.
“What...what is this? Why did you give me handcuffs?” Steve takes them out of the box to inspect them closely. They shine magnificently in the light, almost glittering.
“That’s it. I swear that’s it!”
The nursery he has for his son isn’t finished yet, and he can tell by the look on Steve’s face that he’s hesitant to allow their son to sleep in the room.
Steve silences Tony with a kiss. “Tell me later. Right now I need you to fuck me.”
Tony glances up and stops packing the bag. “Getting this ready.”
"Y-Yeah?"
Steve chuckles. “I think he missed you too.”
, Steve has to remind himself.
“I never said that!”
Tony nods and glances down at his son, smiling at how perfect he was. How perfect his family was.
I’ll update soon!
“Welcome to parenthood.” Natasha shoots Steve a tired smile.
“It’s nothing. I said I was on board so I am. Guess I’m just a little scared.”
“You should’ve woken me up. I told you I’m here to help.”
“Are we bonding? Steve is gonna be happy.”
“Here he comes,” Ned whispers and Peter snaps his head up. Sure enough, Flash is walking toward them.
Peter peers up when he hears the door shut. “I found her!” He calls out.
Bucky huffs out a small laugh. “I wouldn’t want it any other way.”
“I know, sweetheart. I’m so sorry. I wish I could take all your fear and pain away. I’d give anything for you to be happy.”
Peter smiles and wraps his arms around his brother, giggling happily now that they’ve made up. Steve smiles at the scene.
“Yeah.” Sam nods. “Something like that.”
With a huff Steve rolls over onto his back and his eyes land on the ceiling above him. He keeps his ears perked and on high alert, expecting for Peter’s cries to come through the baby monitor or a warning from Jarvis. But the only thing Steve can hear is silence.
Bucky inhales sharply and has to fight the urge to punch the wall. Alpine comes near him again and he scoops her up, cradling her close until she’s purring.
Steve bites back another growl.
“Right. You’re the good guys.” Steve relaxes slightly.
As cheesy as it sounds, Steve’s eyes appear brighter in the candle light. Tony rememberers thinking the same thing back when he first brought Steve to this establishment.
The image of Alpha on top of him, scenting him, touching him...
“Get out, Nat. All of you!” Steve orders. “I’ll get the weapons-”
“Your butt stays here. I don’t need two Rogers’ to worry about.”
Steve nods. It was good. Dr. Strange was supposed to be the best. Tony had promised he’d get the best of the best when it came to his family.
“Papa, do you have to go?” Peter asks for what seems like the hundredth time. Steve doesn’t respond at first, too engrossed in the task of fastening his belt around his waist. Peter huffs in annoyance from where he’s sitting on Steve’s bed, clearly bugged that he was being ignored. “Pa-”
There’s a moment of hesitation before Steve answers with a shake of his head. “I’m sorry,” Steve whispers. Those tears in his eyes escape and roll down his face. “I’m trying to be.”
“Come on.” Steve holds out his hand for Tony to take. “Let’s go show the team.”
“Thank you. I better get him home and check on Steve. I’ll keep you and everyone else updated.”
“It was then. Omegas back then weren’t respected and they sure as hell didn’t get a voice to speak up. I was tired of living that way. I was tired of seeing all of us treated so poorly while alphas controlled everything. I wanted to make a difference. I fought for their rights, they looked up to me.”
“Wait, what?”
“Wow.” Steve breathes out as he listens to the most beautiful sound in the world. “That’s the…”
“Please?” he whispers, holding up his free hand when Pierce steps toward him, gun still raised.
“All of it. I missed everything and I’m so so sorry.”
Pepper couldn’t agree more. Tony had a lot of enemies but none of them have ever come forward to assassinate him. The past few months he had been hiding to keep-
“How do-”
There’s no answer to his question. He opens his mouth to ask another one just like it, but the only sound that leaves his lips is a small scream. The burning between his legs has intensified. He knew what pain felt like. He’s lost count of the times he’s been banged up because Iron Man had too many enemies. But getting blasted out of the air or punched and kicked didn’t compare to what he was suffering through now.
Sarah giggles and bounces; the sound brings a smile to Steve’s face. Harley comes over to join in, throwing himself over Steve’s back and wrapping his little arms around the omega’s neck. He nuzzles Steve’s scent gland.
Tony nods. “I get it, kiddo.”
Nick eyes him closely, too closely. Steve grows nervous, fearing that the rest of his secret was being revealed without him even having to open his mouth.
Neither of them say a word.
“My pleasure, sir.”
Steve brings his wounded hand closer to his chest. “I didn’t mean it. I’m sorry.”
Tony’s turned to pacing the small waiting area outside of the room Steve was rushed to. His eyes glance in the direction of the shut door every few minutes, silently praying for it to open and for him to be allowed to see his husband. But he’s not granted the request.
She stops in her tracks, sniffing the air, scenting him. He does the same, recognizing her as another omega. He visibly relaxes at the realization; she seems to do the same.
“And Pete? He’s good?”
“For once can you take this seriously? Tony, this isn’t a joke. He’s having a baby. Your baby!”
Steve chuckles. “I’ll do my best.”
“Okay. Take a deep breath in,” Steve says and he inhales deeply. James copies. Then Steve exhales. “And out.”
“Hmm you were close. Can I help?”
“You’re going to be a wonderful mother, Steve.” Pepper hugs him tight, but not enough to bring discomfort.
Steve continued to resemble himself since that night. He smiled more and on occasion he would laugh at something someone said. He was better with Morgan, too. Tony didn’t witness any stressful moments between them anymore.
Steve sighs sadly and gets up from the bed, taking the few steps it takes to get to Tony. He places both hands over Tony’s shoulders, then drags them down so that they’re both gently fisting the material of Tony’s shirt. Their eyes meet, giving each other a glimpse of the pain found in them. Their pain isn’t the same.
“Okay well if you need more time than my papa’s birthday party is the best time to come. It’s still a little ways out so it gives you time to think about it, but you should totally come. We always get together and throw him a party,” Peter says, his smile brighter than before.
Tony sighs in defeat. “Fine.”
“You’re my...dad.”
Pepper and Happy were two familiar faces, but they weren’t ones Steve was entirely comfortable around. At least not yet anyway. Their invite was more for Tony than himself, but there was still a part of Steve that wanted to get to know them a little better. They would be in his lives a lot more now since he bonded with Tony.
Tony rolls his eyes and takes his usual spot beside Steve, and with a huff, leans back in the chair. “What I miss?” He asks. “Anything exciting?”
Just a few more months. He could do this.
“Yeah,” Peter nods in agreement. “I look at old photos to remember all the good stuff. The videos helped too. I don’t ever want to forget his voice or his face.”
It’s awkward between them. Neither one of them knew how to start the conversation that was overdue. This talk should’ve happened after their son was born-no, before their son. Ever since they split up their relationship had changed. It was Peter who brought them closer, but more needed to be done. It was their turn now to make things right.
“I take it Pepper has told you everything about me.” Tony smirks and releases the omega’s hand.
“Tony Stark.”
Tony stays between Steve’s spread legs, quickly reaching for another towel when Steve pushes again. It takes another two pushes before the afterbirth is passed. Steve pants and tips his head back.
Steve smiles down at his son. “I missed you, too, bud. You ready for our movie?”
“Hey, calm down, it’s okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter fiddles nervously with his fingers. “There was a party...I don’t know. He didn’t tell me all the details because that would be weird. I definitely don’t need to know how you two...fondued.”
Tony sits up and yawns. “What’s wrong?”
“I love you, too. Don’t give up okay? We’ll be here waiting for you.”
For the rest of the shower Steve feels at ease. He doesn’t glance at the pile of baby items he’s unwrapped nor does he allow his mind to wander about the what if’s. He tries to let go and enjoy the party.
Steve smiles and leans down to peck Tony on the cheek. “It’s a date.”
“Money doesn’t buy happiness.”
Peter is snapped from his thoughts when he senses someone approaching. He glances over his shoulder to find his Uncle Sam coming down the stairs toward him.
Tony peers at his son and meets his eyes. He’s never seen so much fear and pain in them. He had promised to never hurt his son again and to always be there for him. This was his opportunity to fully gain Peter’s trust and assure him that he’d never leave.
There’s an urge to rush toward him, but Morgan needs attention first and Tony moves to pick her up. He shushes her and rocks her soothingly. It takes a few minutes to get her calm, but eventually her cries are dying down and she grows quiet.
“Did anyone lose a pup?” Sam jokes when he comes over. “No? I guess I’ll have to keep this one.”
“Okay.” Steve finally allows his eyes to fall shut. “Thank you, Tony.”
“It does. And he’s got this great smile. He can be stubborn as hell, though.”
“I’m not ready to face the world. Not yet.”
Tony pulls him closer, a few of his own tears escaping and rolling down his face. He tries to prevent the rest from falling. He needs to be strong for the both of them.
“My mother was a nurse,” Steve starts. “And my father was a soldier. He died before I was born, leaving my mother to care for me on her own. She did her best given our circumstances. I didn’t make it easy and sometimes I wondered if her life would be easier if I had…” Steve frowns and brings his glass up to his lips, hoping the cool water would drown the lump that’s formed in his throat.
Sam’s smile grows. “I thought that was you.”
Morgan jumps up and off the bed. She grabs his hand and pulls. “Come on, dad!”
He can’t help but hope they jinxed everything by breaking the news early. He can only cross his fingers.
Steve grows desperate for the alpha's touch. He whines, capturing Tony’s attention.
I’ll update soon!
Then of course there was the party. But Peter doesn’t want to think about that night. He had vowed to never be so stupid and reckless again.
“Is that what you’re worried about? That’ll I leave you hanging? Steve, I’m not going to do that. I already said I’m doing this with you. I know this baby was unexpected, but I gotta tell you I already love that kid to death and I’d do anything for him. And for you.”
“Yeah. Block.” Steve smiles and hands his son another. “Can you say papa?”
“Bye, kid.”
Steve chuckles softly and presses a kiss to the side of Tony’s head. “It was for both of you. I just wanted you to have fun.”
“Yeah.” Peter nods. “We’re still working things out. But please please please stop being so weird!”
The beginning of their relationship had been rough, both were too stubborn and too stupid to realize that there was more than friendship brewing between them. It wasn’t until Natasha knocked some sense into them (literally. Steve’s sure the serum didn’t fully heal the bruise) did they start acting like adults and communicate.
“I’m fine.”
Happy acknowledges Peter with a warm smile. “Hey, kiddo. How was school?”
Tony bites down hard on his bottom lip, breaking the skin and filling his mouth with iron. “Yep.”
“See? Steve, I know you’re a little different now-” Tony takes Steve’s hands again when Steve tries to use them to hide himself. “-but I don’t care. I think you’re beautiful no matter what.”
His friends are there to help him set up the nursery, and just like he suspected, they spoil the baby. Natasha more so than everyone else. Steve figures because she will never get the chance to experience this for herself. He lets her do what she wants, knowing that it makes her happy.
“You didn’t mean it. You apologized over and over for it. It was my fault. I triggered your rut.”
“Guess we were right. I have a feeling these two are going to be best friends,” Tony says.
“Someone’s happy.” Steve smiles and scratches Dodger’s head.
Steve chugs down half the bottle before answering, “Why? They’re not that fun. And you’d have to get up early.”
Steve nods. “Yes.”
“I don’t know,” Tony says, his voice quiet. He keeps his gaze locked on Morgan’s face, taking in her shiny, dark eyes. She stares up at him, smiling that smile he can’t get enough of. She has Steve’s smile.
“And clean your room?” Tony asks.
“Uh.” Steve scrambles for the remote and pauses the movie. “Just sketching,” he says and shows her his sketchpad.
They try for a baby that night.
“Go right ahead,” The alpha encourages, sensing Steve’s hesitancy. “Did you get all of me? Let me turn around.” Sam smiles and turns around, peering over his shoulder at Steve. The omega smiles back.
It was usually the alphas showing more strength and aggressiveness, but Steve wasn’t any ordinary omega. He was stronger than any alpha Tony had ever crossed. He was not to be underestimated, and pretty soon Hydra and Alexander Pierce were going to realize that.
Peter steps out of the room and makes his way back into the living room, finding his uncles trying to console his upset aunt. They all glance up when they hear him approach.
“It’s okay.” Tony brings Steve close again. “We’ll find something that will.”
Steve keeps his face buried in Tony’s neck, inhaling the scent of his mate. He smiles at that thought. He finally had a mate. He finally had a good alpha to love him.
Alexander carefully lifts Tony to his feet, catching him when Tony sways. The door is opening. Tony’s vision is still fuzzy; it’s difficult to make out the figures that come toward him.
“Marvin Gaye, 1972 ‘ Trouble Man’ soundtrack. Everything you missed jammed into one album.”
Steve thinks it over. “I...I guess. But nothing too fancy, Tony. I mean it.”
A small grin spreads across Tony’s face. “Yeah,” he says and pats his belly. “Guess we’re having a big kiddo. That’s from your side obviously.”
“Relax, Steve. You need to calm down. You’re only going to make yourself feel worse if you don’t.”
“He’s okay. Tony, he’s okay,” Steve assures and takes Tony’s hand to calm him again. “He’s being looked over.”
Happy grumbles and releases the firm grip he has on Peter. Peter peers up at him and mutters a ‘thanks’.
The idea to build a suit of armor came to him during another night of insomnia. It wasn’t just Steve plagued with nightmares. Tony suffered through them more times than he’d like to admit. He’d never get the sight and sounds of his mate being brutally raped and tortured out of his head. He hides the nightmares and lack of sleep, knowing he needed to be strong and provide comfort to his mate and pups when they woke up scared.
Tony sighs sadly and rises to his feet, searching around the room for a tissue. He rushes into the bathroom to retrieve some of the toilet tissue. He returns and hands it to Steve.
Steve is waiting for him in the hall.
Steve’s smile returns and he leans close to peck Tony on the lips. The alpha frowns from the brief contact and brings his mate in for a proper kiss.
All he cared about was getting the poor guy out of the cold and away from the crowded street.
Tony releases a sob and brings Steve closer, pressing his lips against his soft hair and inhaling the familiar scent. Tears are flooding his eyes and the dam breaks, those tears free and flowing down his face.
Tony hadn’t said where they were going. Steve isn’t sure if he’s supposed to dress nice or if their outing would be more casual. It’s not just the lack of details that’s making Steve nervous. He’s not sure how this works anymore.
Steve realizes he hasn’t said anything, but honestly, how the hell is he supposed to respond to ‘long time no see’? He had written various letters and left hundreds of voicemails, pouring out his heart and all he gets is a pathetic greeting.
The compound feels lonelier without Tony in it. They were supposed to have moved locations together, as a team, but Tony had already made up his mind that he didn’t belong. Steve should be grateful that Tony at least gave the Avengers a new home, but in reality it was just so Tony could have his tower back to himself.
“I’m gonna go before this gets worse.” Tony’s already made up his mind and he doesn’t give Steve a chance to stop him. Not that Steve would at this point. He was clearly annoyed with him and a night away from each other might do them some good.
“He was...fine. He worked hard. His company was...I don’t know. Probably more important than me. I mean he never told me he loved me. I don’t even know if he liked me.”
Tony rolls over with a sigh, letting his eyes land on the ceiling above him. He has no problem taking the blame for their current fight. It was his jealousy that put him on the couch.
Harley giggles. “Doodie.”
Steve is still panting hard, his chest glistening with sweat and flushed darker than before. Tony gives him a moment to compose himself. The other alphas probably never did.
“Shit. Bucky did say something about that. I didn’t think they were going right away.”
They were over. Their relationship didn’t exist and the friendship they promised each other was well on its way to never existing either. And then Peter came along and in an instant, they were pulled back to each other.
“Hi.” Steve smiles. “So you’re the reason why he’s awake?”
“Good,” Rumlow appears pleased and he shoves Steve forward. The omega quickly catches himself before he can hit the floor. “Take this one and the kid. I’m not done yet.”
“Guess we were wrong huh?” Tony smiles and leans down to press a kiss to Steve’s head. “We’re having a boy.”
Bucky’s smile gets a little brighter. He glances down at the shirt and opens it up, giving Peter a glimpse at the words printed on the front: World’s Greatest Uncle
“But I need help.”
Peter mumbles again and folds his arms over the island and rests his head on them. “Daddy, can you make more pancakes again?”
“I don’t know. I’ll just have to hide it or something.”
“And did nothing!” Bucky snaps and jumps to his feet. “Look at what happened because of us!” he gestures angrily at the door.
Steve didn’t care what they were having as long as their little bundle of joy was healthy. But...a girl would be nice. He had no idea how to be around girls but he couldn’t get the image of a little girl with Tony’s eyes out of his head.
“Right. Because bleeding is a good sign.” Tony rolls his eyes. He pulls out the contents he needs from the kit and gestures for Steve’s hand. Steve huffs and allows him to take care of the wound. “What did you do? Smash your hand through the frame?”
“We all miss him here. I think Happy misses him a little more.”
“It’s to distract myself, Steve! Labor takes forever and I don’t want to be bored.”
“Tony, everyone knows you’re gone.”
“You want me to fight and...Tony, I don’t know if...what if I can’t?”
James mostly acts up when he’s not in the penthouse. He’s still timid of Bruce. Or at least that’s what everyone initially thought. Turns out he’s afraid of doctors and doesn’t enjoy being poked or prodded. Steve sympathizes with him there.
“I’ll say,” JARVIS pipes up and Tony frowns.
“We’re sorry,” Steve apologizes. “Can you forgive us?”
Tony moves toward her, his gaze falling on his fussy daughter. He wonders if she’s upset from being disturbed from a nap or if she can sense the energy in the room. Tony gestures for Natasha to sit in the seat he had been occupying earlier; he’s not going to be needing it anymore.
It’s Steve who growls this time, and he sends his mate a warning look. “Tony, enough. He helped us and our pups.”
I still feel so bad for Peter. He’s hurting and all he wants is for Tony to step up and be there for him. Tony’s trying...I guess. He needs to work harder though!
Now Tony had to take matters into his own hands.
“Yay!” Steve cheers and Peter claps his hands. “He really missed you.”
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Peter says, and his eyes flicker in the direction of the statue. “He didn’t keep his.”
“Me too.”
“Shit, Steve,” Tony groans, eyes falling shut when Steve’s rubs and squeezes his cock. Steve pulls back, smirking when Tony whines.
“I miss you, Papa,” Peter says and traces a finger along the engraved name. He swallows the lump in his throat and continues, “I...I met dad today. I don’t know. Maybe it was stupid but you always said if I wanted to then I should. Now I’m wondering if I made a mistake. He’s…”
Steve shakes his head. “No,” he mumbles.
Steve disappears to the bathroom with the shirt and closes the door behind him with a soft click. Tony sighs heavily and glances around the room for a moment before making himself comfortable on the edge of the bed.
“Good,” Tony replies and adjusts the sleeping pup in his arms. “Do you want to switch?”
Steve musters up the bit of strength he has left and he pushes. He screams through it, his throat burning. Then finally the baby is sliding out and into the doctor’s awaiting arms. Steve gasps and slumps forward, right into Tony’s arms.
Steve smiles down at his boyfriend and threads his fingers through Tony’s hair. “I think he likes the name,” Steve says, when he feels a kick from within his womb. Tony feels it too and he nods his head in agreement.
Steve grows silent, jaw clenching and eyes filling with tears. Tony’s struck a nerve. But that was his intention. He had to make Steve believe he was the issue. It was going to be Steve’s fault.
“Indeed. Steve asked me to set one to remind you to wake at a decent time.”
“Yes?” Peter knows he doesn’t sound sure. “I mean...he’s my dad.”
“Probably not. I’m fat!”
“No. I can’t. This...this is fine.”
Ned is ready to ask another question, but Peter stops him.
“It is? I couldn’t tell.” Steve teases.
Tony hisses and pulls away, sending a glare in his assistant’s way. Pepper frowns at him before leaning in to dab more antibacterial ointment on the wound. Tony hisses again, teeth gritting together from the sting.
Steve doesn’t respond like he normally does, and instead he grumbles some kind of response Tony can’t decipher. Steve takes the spot Peter was occupying earlier, folding his arms over the table and resting his head on them.
Peter rushes out of the jet, a smile forming on his face from the small victory. But he’s reminded that he had more to do than sneak off the jet.
Well now these two have a baby and a whole lot to figure out! It's so weird for me to be writing them after a breakup and having the baby in the beginning of the story lol Like I said in my first note, I don't know what's going to happen next so if any of you have any ideas or want to see anything, just let me know! I need some inspiration! Thank you for reading!
Tony smiles and places the jar down for Steve. He moves around him to get to the other side, his hand lightly coming into contact with his shoulder. The spark that shoots through him is difficult to ignore.
“Not yet. But with a little training, he’ll be exactly who we need him to be.” The alpha turns and walks toward the incubator, then reaches out to touch the pup’s head. Tony growls in warning. “Easy there, Stark. I don’t want to hurt you. I need you.”
Steve nods and glances down at his lap again. He wrings his hands together. His nervous energy only makes Tony feel worse. A strange thought enters his mind. He wonders if this is the omega Pepper said he had been chasing at the party.
“That’s pretty simple. Your papa sure loves those sweaters.”
It was difficult enough to accept that Steve was gone, and attending his birthday didn’t seem appealing. It would be depressing because Steve wouldn’t be there to celebrate his special day.
“I can’t be here right now.”
“You can’t. I trust you.”
“If you need help-” Tony starts, only to sigh when he realizes Steve has already left the room. “Dammit,” he curses to himself and scrubs a hand along his face.
“What did Pep say?”
“Bucky, stop,” Sam tries to defuse the situation. He squeezes Bucky’s flesh hand and eyes the metal one when it rolls into a fist.
“I’ll get you out of here.”
Peter flinches when someone joins him and he peers up, finding his uncle Bucky beside him.
Steve doesn’t even look at him, instead focusing on Peter’s sleeping face. “Yeah.”
Bucky calls out to him. “And don’t come back. You’re not one of us.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “We’ll be in the compound, Tony. It’s fine.”
Steve is hesitant. The last time he had been out was the day he bumped into Tony. He was embarrassed to say that was his first experience in this new world. He was never granted permission to leave Hydra’s walls. Whatever he needed, Alpha made sure was within his reach without having to step foot outside of the building that housed him for years.
“Say what?”
“Don’t. You’re so beautiful,” Tony murmurs against Steve’s neck.
“Steve, let me remind you that this room is a safe place. Whatever you say to me stays between us. You’re safe here. No one can hurt you.”
“Nothing? Really? What happened to liking movies?” Tony teases.
Steve nods. “You okay, bud?”
It was a thought he’s had for a while, even before Steve and Peter, but now that he had a family, he was ready to give up his company and devote all of his time to his mate and son. His father had chosen work over him and Tony was not going to follow in his footsteps. He wanted to be a good mate and an even better father.
“Tony, stop.”
“Take them off, Stark.”
Brock acts first, doing the one thing Steve never expected and firing his gun. Steve dodges the incoming bullets, but he’s not quick enough and one hits him in the arm, grazing the skin. Steve grits his teeth but doesn’t back down, determined to give Rumlow the same treatment as the other alpha.

“I know. I’m just...scared. That room is full of people.”
“Your kid? I thought you didn’t know him, now he’s carrying your kid?” Happy asks.
