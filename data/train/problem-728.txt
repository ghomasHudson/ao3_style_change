,” he mocked, spitting out the word. “Bloody tedious, that was. And useless. All so I can find out this son of a bitch is alive from the bloody newsagent’s.”
At first, Sherlock had thought that they only needed to fool everyone for a week or so. He’d been preparing to come back, itching to tell John everything, to apologize for his abominable behaviour towards him. But then Mycroft had cautioned him:
“Sherlock,” John whispered, and he could taste his breath, feel his skin—“If we start, I won’t be able to stop,” he managed, his breath hitching in his throat.
“Abby?” Helen’s voice cracked. Abby’s tail began wagging a little and her ears perked up. She pressed her nose into the door a little, sniffing the door crack, whining sadly. John felt his throat clench a little at the forlorn expression on the lab’s face, his heart softening.
Sherlock gave him a look. “Now that would be telling. You already spill too many of my secrets in your blog. Let’s not ruin all the mysteries. Also, I imagine you’re quite good at it, too.”
“We couldn’t have done it without you, John,” he said with a small smile. “Your evidence, the people you dug up, the blog, no less… it all helped a great deal to exonerate him.”
John’s eyes dropped to his hand as he finally seemed to register that it was still on Sherlock’s thigh, burning through his skin. His fingers clenched a little and then he withdrew his hand slowly and carefully. Sherlock took a steadying breath as John looked back up, and despite himself, Sherlock’s eyes dropped to John’s lips. John must have noticed it, of course he did; he was an idiot but not blind. However, John leaned back a little bit to give them both more space, defusing the situation. Sherlock’s first impulse was to follow; how could he move
He could feel Sherlock’s breath in warm, fast huffs against his skin, as Sherlock nudged him with his nose. John swallowed heavily, his fingers curling into Sherlock’s shirt on his shoulders, trying to calm his frantic heartbeat. But then Sherlock’s lips found his again in a brief nibble and John knew he had to stop and get them off the stairs now before he forgot himself.
The Case! Yes, I re-wrote the A.G.R.A. story for this fic. More of that to come in later chapters :-)
Sherlock turned again, examining the door. “Stand back,” he ordered, and John stepped backwards until he hit the wall of shelves. Sherlock moved and suddenly, he threw himself against the door with his whole weight.
John gaped at him. Finally, he swallowed against the lump in his throat. He’d hardly ever seen Sherlock so sincere or… awkward. He remembered suddenly how flustered his friend had been at the pool after he’d torn the semtex off of him. He’d been completely thrown off by John’s willingness to sacrifice himself. It seems he still hadn’t gotten the message.
He felt Sherlock move around to give him a bit of space. When he bumped into the wooden shelves, he heard the sound of jars chinking together.
Sherlock mentally berated himself for letting his control slide so quickly. He had just come to the conclusion that he couldn’t risk losing John over something like relationship issues or misunderstandings and certainly not something so idiotic as these
Mary cocked her head, giving him a sardonic smile. “I may choose not to answer it, but you can certainly ask,” she said drily.
John’s eyes widened. Sherlock let out a breath. He couldn’t tell him how he felt, because he hadn’t quite figured that out himself or, for that matter, what words applied to it. Not yet. But whatever John’s feelings, Sherlock, whether he wanted to or not, returned them. Without thinking about it, he had accidentally proven it beyond a doubt.
—“ John broke off and swallowed, his breathing becoming erratic. He twitched his head once, closing his eyes as if he was in pain. His other fist was raised, punched ineffectually against Sherlock’s chest and then curled tightly into his shirt.
“Oh, Sherlock, you need one, too,” Margaret grinned and pointed at the post-it pad. “John, come on.” She got up and fetched the sherry bottle from the cabinet and poured her son a new glass.
They brought a coffee for Sherlock, too, and he acknowledged it with a brief nod, before he went back to looking up things on his phone. Molly, being one of the unfortunate people who looked a total mess even after just a few tears, excused herself after that, probably to process things. So John ended up standing next to Sherlock, watching him work.
John felt the embers in his veins leap into blazing flames at the touch. He heard Sherlock whisper his name, the exhalation making his skin heat, his fingers flexing where they still rested on Sherlock’s legs. He blinked, trying to calm his racing heart. “Sherlock, come on.” With a creak in his knees, he heaved himself to his feet, holding on to what remained of his self-control. “We’re not sleeping here; Mycroft will never let us hear the end of it.”
“Not getting into trouble, are we?” Mycroft asked, getting straight to the point. “Let me guess: you felt the charitable spirit of Christmas and decided to attend a random fundraising event you could find at short notice?”
“I got them all, in the end,” Sherlock continued, his voice taking on an edge. “I made the connections I was there to make and when I was done, Mycroft fetched me home and sent in his nitwits to clean up the rest. And that’s all.” Sherlock poked at his own food, which was probably cold by now.
Sherlock’s lips twitched in a smile. “If it’s the right boat,” he said, trying to sound humble and failing miserably.
“He hinted,” he managed. “I told him I would wait for you to tell me whatever it was when you were ready.” He sighed again. “Thought you had some skeletons in your closet, or whatever, but, you know… not
“Yeah, thanks for having us,” John smiled. He heard all that his friend meant by that. He glanced over at the posh house. There didn’t seem to be many officers around, and the street was practically empty.
I don't know what to say except... thank you all for the wait and the lovely reviews so far. Here's a little something soft and some much-needed feels for you, you're welcome <3
“Why did this have to… why now, John?” Sherlock’s voice was low. “The case is all that matters right now. I mean—“ he composed himself some more. “I am back now and you’re fine… we can go back to the way things were until… well, until we’ve had some more time to think. Wouldn’t that be good, too?”
He felt John’s steps falter a bit and he noticed he had involuntarily put his arm around him. But John didn’t say anything, he just smiled; so Sherlock left his arm where it was and tightened it a little, hoping to get some warmth into John. Together they made their way back to the street to look for a taxi.
Sherlock was on his laptop, idly listening in on their conversations as he worked. He didn’t anticipate the break-through when it came. Father was telling John and Mary about the time when they bought their house; it was one of those generally safe subjects to discuss. They’d already told all the embarrassing childhood stories, Father had mildly quizzed John about the army and his (and Mary’s) surgery and politely inquired about them working on cases again. And now houses. Sherlock had vaguely noted that both John and Mary looked a little bored, but were too polite to say so. Sherlock had never had such qualms.
John looked up, sharing a look with him for a moment. And despite everything that had (or hadn’t) happened between them, this was something no one could take away. The thrill of finally picking up the scent, continuing the hunt. The atmosphere seemed oddly ominous and fitting to how they both felt. It eased the knot in his stomach a little, but John slid into the car without a word. Sherlock sighed as he followed. He still had an uphill battle before him if he wanted to fix this.
Sherlock shrugged non-committedly and John sighed a little. He wanted nothing more than to find some of the closeness again they’d been building up to over the past few days. He still felt like he couldn’t get enough of Sherlock’s presence, now that he had him back, but he didn’t want to overwhelm him with sudden displays of affection. Especially not when Mycroft was anywhere near.
“Oh, right!” Yes, John had promised to take her to a new exhibition. At the time, he had thought how that presented them with another opportunity to go out twice in one week and to get to know her better. He thought about Sherlock and how simply thinking about him made his head ache with all the confusion.
If John was a little anxious about sharing a hotel room with Sherlock at this point, he soon found he needn’t have been. Sherlock had booked them a double room without question. As soon as they got to their room, Sherlock tossed his coat and jacket over a chair and toed off his ruined shoes. He groaned and John watched with a bemused smile as six feet of consulting detective simply keeled over onto the bed, seemingly dead to the world.
He stepped closer, grabbed some disposable gloves from a box and began examining the body as well. Sherlock was kneeling next to the sofa on the ground, watching John’s every move. John checked the neck, throat and eyes, glanced at fingernails and noted the faint but noticeable skin discoloration.
for this, just like Sherlock. Others, such as Mycroft in one of his more pedestrian moments, might have pointed out that John going out on a limb like that was especially remarkable because Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson had only just met. Sherlock, however, knew that it was not a question of time. It was a question of character. Either you pulled the trigger, or you didn’t. And feeling remorseful about it afterwards didn’t change this fact, and John knew it. He’d made a decision. There was no regret.
However, there was one difference to consider: those images contained a happy, relaxed and confident John. He looked at John, and it occurred to him that he had looked completely lost in the bathroom earlier, and Sherlock wanted to ask
Lestrade eyed Sherlock thoughtfully and was about to say something when a startled sound came from next to them. A door closed and a nurse came out of the ladies’ restrooms. “What are you doing?!” she asked, quite angrily. “You can’t just help yourselves, this is a hospital!” She took the roll of plaster from Lestrade and gave them both a glare.
“Hm,” Sherlock made, narrowing his eyes at him. “Are you saying that I need to write about you in my blog?”
When they finally turned the water off and stepped out of the shower, Sherlock was quiet, his eyes full of
“Nonsense,” Sherlock murmured back, a smile in his voice. His breath ghosted over John’s lips, making them tingle.
She laughed a clear, surprisingly unaffected laugh and leaned into their space in a conspiratorial manner. She raked her eyes over both Sherlock and John. “You know, I think it’s amazing what you both do. And you give the
"And how is John?" Sherlock’s voice was soft, as always when he spoke of his friend. Mycroft saw the lines of worry on his face, the dark circles under his eyes.
“Ah yes, the good doctor,” Mycroft intoned pleasantly. He remembered his earlier words to the DI. Nothing like a near-death experience...
“Are you done?” She caught Moran’s eyes and jerked her head towards Sherlock. Moran advanced and grabbed his arms to twist them behind his back as well. Norbury’s gun was aimed at John now, who stood helpless, sweat on his brow. “
Sherlock kept himself busy on his laptop. Since this afternoon, he’d developed a certain manic energy, not even looking up when John briefly rested his hand on his shoulder.
John absent-mindedly patted Abby’s head in his lap. She was lying on the couch between him and Sherlock, looking up with sad eyes as if to emphasise
John gave a surprised chuckle and shook his head. “Okay, seriously, whoever you are, what have you done with Sherlock Holmes?” he asked. “Because whoever came back from the dead yesterday,” he turned to explain to Mary, “it’s not him.” He had tried to speak lightly, but felt something heavy in his heart – yes, it was definitely still a bit too soon to be making jokes about it.
feeling confused. Instead, John had snuck into the room, afraid to even say anything to him. And that would not do.
Sherlock’s eyes darted back and forth between John’s, as if he was trying to figure out something. “Your chances of finding a specific person in London at this time of night with hardly any clues to go on are infinitesimal. You’re recovering from a recent injury and still require rest.” He glanced at John’s arm, which was still protectively bandaged against his torso. “You had trouble getting dressed and you are still in pain. You are tired but you didn’t go to bed.” He paused. “You were really worried,” he concluded.
There was no more awkwardness, both of them settling into their new closeness surprisingly well, their bodies fitting together perfectly, and Sherlock was shocked to find that he felt more human and more himself than he ever had before. John managed to produce sensations and sounds and shivers in him that he wouldn’t have admitted to anyone, and he really must have been blind not to have deduced John’s capability to reduce him to absolute gibberish just from looking at him. It was an amazing discovery and it made him feel safe and right, and he agreed that he must have been a
“Yes.” Sherlock steepled his fingers and stood in front of them, ready to impress. “I believed that our dear ‘Love’ was responsible because all of the relevant messages contained her personal communications code.” Mycroft frowned; clearly disgruntled that Sherlock would simply throw around people’s secret codenames like that. But then he glanced at Mary, who shrugged, and he dramatically rolled his eyes as Sherlock continued.
Sherlock frowned. He wasn’t quite sure what John’s exact relationship with the woman was, and he hadn’t made a point in finding out; from his estimate of their respective personalities, he knew it couldn’t last long.
Sherlock spun and kneeled on the couch, his blue dressing gown twisting around his body. He read out the text. “
“The game is over, Doctor Watson,” the voice meandered through the fog, sickly with anger. “Just you and me left now.” John swallowed.
“John.” She sounded relieved but gave a wry look at their clothes. “Hell of a night you picked to go out.”
“Very well. We can skip the squabbling, then. We have work to do anyway.” Mycroft’s voice became more serious. “I understand you have taken on a new case?”
John was reminded of the night that Sherlock came to sleep in his bed to combat the nightmares with his presence. He remembered them falling asleep together on the couch only a few days ago.
Lestrade shifted his coffee cup to the other hand and shook. Sherlock’s brother. That certainly explained the faint resemblance and the instant unwelcome deductions. “Pleasure,” he muttered, and then remembered. “Gregory Lestrade, Scotland Yard,” he said, out of habit.
“Whatever you need—” John mumbled. He felt himself being gently leaned against the wall. Sherlock’s other arm rested on his shoulder now, and he dipped his head. John angled himself so that he could look up. His breath caught again as he became completely overwhelmed with the sight. Dark lashes moved slowly closer and John felt the gentle press of Sherlock’s nose against his skin before finally, soft lips met his.
At that moment, the image cut to a live feed of Baker Street. Mycroft saw about a dozen people crowding around the familiar black door. And true enough, it opened a moment later to reveal Sherlock, dramatically sweeping onto the scene in his long coat and –
“You know, you have a strange obsession with mundane facts about my life.” Sherlock’s eyes quickly jumped to John’s and then back to his bow-tie. He was certainly taking his time with it, John thought; for the first time he began paying more attention to Sherlock than his own raging hormones and he noticed that Sherlock seemed…
John smiled, looked at his feet and briefly rocked back and forth on his heels. “Couldn’t be happier,” he said quietly as he looked back at the reporter. Mycroft let out a surprised chuckle. Well, wasn’t that a surprise? If Mycroft was a betting man, he’d have given the doctor weeks, if not months, to figure out exactly why he
Sherlock leaned back against the wooden wall and dropped the file on the bed. “So what about her, then? She’s undercover? Sleeper agent? Foreign intelligence? Just bring her in and get her away from John.”
Sherlock smirked and John felt his heart give a little lurch. “Wouldn’t you like to know,” the detective drawled quietly. John managed a weak chuckle.
“John,” Sherlock said, his voice low. It sent shivers down John’s spine. He looked up, only to find Sherlock’s piercing eyes scrutinising him. It seemed as if Sherlock wanted to say something. A pained look crossed his face for a second and it made John’s chest ache in a way he couldn’t make sense of. “Packing,” he said.
Sherlock killed the lights and the car bounced over rocks and slid through mud as they advanced through the field. John gripped the handle over the door tightly with one hand, his seat with the other, staring into the darkness. He hoped Sherlock knew where they were going. “Oh God, why do I let you do this,” he said.
“You better stop before you sprain something,” Sherlock rumbled quietly, not lifting his eyes from his microscope.
“They were clearly either intended for her or for someone who used her clearance. But anyone who would do that more than once or twice would surely trigger alarms or raise questions.”
They came upon a first guard standing by the stairs, lighting a cigarette. John snuck behind him and actually managed to get him in a choke hold before he could make a sound. He dragged him backwards behind the small drinks bar, and Sherlock gave him a somewhat impressed look, eyebrows raised. John couldn’t help it, he felt momentarily smug. However, that also made him careless for a crucial second, and he missed the steps behind him until he saw Sherlock’s eyes widen and large arms gripped his torso.
“You know I just can’t get enough of traditions and cheesy New Year’s things are right up my street.”
Suddenly, he had to go. He couldn’t stay in here one minute longer. He felt mortified at having invaded Sherlock’s privacy like this. What had gotten
John’s eyes widened a fraction as he took in their position. “Hello,” he mumbled uncertainly, taking in the hand on his chest and looking a bit bewildered at Sherlock’s face so close to his.
John sighed. “Yes, sorry, I—“ he floundered, then finally gave in. “Yes. To be honest, something’s on my mind and I should just come out and ask.”
!” Sherlock felt cold trickle down his spine. He had told John that he’d been under surveillance not just from Mycroft. But that it had been
“Careful,” John winced as Sherlock gathered Mary in his arms. She moaned, but John knew they had to get away, as much as that would aggravate her wounds.
He remembered the last time he’d gotten shot in that very place and quickly considered the possible complications due to the previous scars. He was, simply put, worried. Realization set in that if they weren’t found soon, he would not survive this.
John’s eyes fluttered open with some difficulty. He coughed. “I’m okay,” he said, but his voice sounded pained. Sherlock gently brushed some plaster pieces from his hair and helped him sit up. A trace of blood was trickling into his eyes. Sherlock quickly ran his fingers over John’s forehead, ascertaining the damage. “It’s superficial,” he said, the relief evident in his voice. John touched his forehead and nodded. A piece of glass must have nicked him as it flew past. Nothing dangerous. Sherlock breathed.
“Stop,” he quickly snarled at the cabbie. “Stop the car. Wait.” The driver swerved the car towards the pavement and stopped.
John returned downstairs in his normal clothes, deciding the showing off could wait. He simply informed Sherlock that the suit fit perfectly, which the detective acknowledged with a small smirk and a nod. The rest of the day, John spent reading some of the print-outs Sherlock pushed his way; information on Lady Smallwood and several other high-ranking officials that John immediately shredded once he read them. He felt cold sweat running down his back when he thought about what might be in store for them if people found that sort of classified material in their drawers. Sherlock only laughed and called him paranoid.
His mind in a pleasant spin, his cheeks heating up at the honest, deep tone of Sherlock’s voice, John closed the distance between them and grabbed the lapels of Sherlock’s coat. “Obviously,” he grinned, drew him closer and kissed him.
John took a shaky breath and reached for his tea; and hesitated when he saw Sherlock’s face. Now there was no question about what he felt. He looked heartbroken. Another thing John had thought to be impossible.
She ground her teeth together and nodded. He gently rolled her shoulders forward. “Help me,” he told Sherlock, who knelt by her legs. Together, they managed to get her on her uninjured side, lying on the jacket.
John cleared his throat and gathered his thoughts. “Uh, no, I haven’t.” When Lestrade held out the paper to him, he declined. “I don’t— I mean, I know what it says,” he managed. “But… that’s good.”
John felt his own arms slowly giving in, the brute wearing him out. They rolled over a few times and John tried to lock him in place with his arms and a knee, but he couldn’t get the leverage. Realising this was his last chance to get away, he twisted around to escape the grapple, but the stairway was too narrow to manoeuvre properly. He barely made it only to stumble against the wall again.
Lestrade ignored that, too. “I don’t know how you do it. He barely can stand being in the same room with other people because he thinks they’re idiots.”
“Well, I’m going to put some clothes on, for starters,” he said lightly, cursing himself inwardly. His hand reached out involuntarily to rest on Sherlock’s hips. He felt Sherlock’s eyes jump down to his hand, a small frown appearing between the delicate brows. John felt a stab of worry and quickly pulled his hand back. He really shouldn’t presume that just because they—
Sherlock was slightly miffed that John was frowning and sounding annoyed. Perhaps he should not have brought up the injury. Yes, he was sure that, had it been someone else, John would not have brought it up. Part of him screamed that that was incredibly irrelevant and that a person was either shot or wasn’t and they’d better acknowledge the facts and move on. Sentimental traipsing around the topic wasn’t helping anyone.
But then Sherlock’s breath floated across his ear and the sound made some kind of switch flick and he almost acted on autopilot. He tilted his head just so and felt his way along the skin until his mouth found Sherlock’s.
Suddenly it sounded incredibly cheesy and embarrassing to say that out loud. Yet Sherlock looked, for lack of a better word,
Sherlock finally placed his hand lightly on John’s shoulder. He searched his face. “I never cared what they wrote about me,” he said. “I still don’t care. But they’ll get their story sooner or later…” his hand gave John’s shoulder a squeeze. “And I’d much rather give it to them on our terms than on theirs… or
“Mycroft has been known to make sensible decisions, on occasion,” Sherlock allowed, and John chuckled at the magnanimous tone.
Sherlock didn’t make any recognition he had heard him, but after a bit of a pause he replied. “I didn’t
“I sent them back upstairs,” he said quietly, but he heard the sniffling behind the door pause and knew Helen could hear him. There was a scuffing sound on the door and John realised she probably sat with her back to it. He crouched down to be more on her level and gently kept petting Abby as she whined a little.
Mary came up the stairs and knocked politely on the open sitting room door. “Hello boys,” she greeted cheerfully and came over to John. She sat on the armrest of his chair and leaned down for a quick peck on his head. John smiled at her. He liked the atmosphere of brisk optimism she brought to a room – it was also a reason she made a good nurse, he thought. He felt Sherlock’s brooding eyes on him and wondered how he had ended up with two so different people in his life. He tried to brush the thought away, placing an arm around Mary’s waist.
of Sherlock (John did not want to think too much about the legalities, as usual) they found out that Helen owed her a lot of money.
Sherlock leaned in closer, close enough that John could feel the warmth radiating off him. “Look who it is,” he smirked.
the discussion and John’s input. Sometimes he was getting almost giddy, which was something he’d never admit outside of a serial murder case.
Sherlock turned around to see Mycroft sitting comfortably in John’s chair, whilst Mary was sitting rather primly on the only other chair in the room besides his own.
, and then hobbled outside. Sherlock’s eyes followed him. He could be halfway back to the room by now, starting on undressing John in the elevator. Instead, he had to spend more tedious minutes talking to Mycroft.
Sherlock sighed. “I did not think you’d be so concerned. I just needed some space to think and ignored my phone. I didn’t mean to worry you. I thought you’d appreciate the solitude.”
that lovers were supposed to adhere to and he, Sherlock Holmes, had never bothered to learn it? He felt like he was back at the hospital, staring holes into a sleeping John Watson
John frowned, but then pulled himself together remarkably. He cleared his throat, took on a more formal stance. He knew the game was on.
“So let me get this straight,” John said. “Someone is killing government agents because of a mole five years ago, and the same nutter is after us now?”
He wound his way through the pub back to their corner and balanced the pints on the table. Lestrade picked up his. “Cheers, mate,” he nodded and had a drink.
. He’s got a house, a dog, even a picket fence – and he had Helen, and that completed the picture in his mind. He wasn’t kidding; he really
The next few days at the flat were, decidedly, weird. Sherlock made an effort to make everything comfortable for John; he even made him tea and chucked away the remaining body parts in the fridge. This was much appreciated by his flatmate, who now constantly wore a bemused expression on his face. Sherlock, on the other hand, felt increasingly bothered by the intense scrutiny John was bestowing on him, as if he meant to say something, but then didn’t. They hardly spoke, and certainly not about anything important. It was like they were both walking on egg shells. Sherlock was sure that there had never been this much
“—uuh, excellent medical knowledge, I think you’ll find –“ John interrupted, raising one admonishing index finger, poking Sherlock in the chest.
Sherlock’s lips quirked up in a smile. “Yes, I suppose I will,” he said, and walked off, ignoring Lestrade’s wry grin.
for not being a very considerate boyfriend and not informing her when I was, uh, shot.” Before Sherlock could reply, he quickly continued, “I was
Sherlock slung his arm around him to help and then frowned, puzzled. His eyes strayed to John’s shoulder and widened. John glanced down. Red blood was seeping from a wound in his shoulder. His cardigan and shirt were clinging to the wound and made it even more difficult and painful to move, to stay upright in the water. His medical mind tried to get a grasp of the situation, but had no more suggestions to offer beyond ‘
Sherlock was momentarily distracted. John hadn’t really laughed much since he returned. The wrinkles next to John’s eyes were fascinating to look at. “Hm? Oh, just… dirt from the window,” he replied.
Finally, after settling everything with John, the doctor turned to Sherlock. She gave him a quick check-up. When he protested, she quickly silenced him with a certain natural authority. John had to force himself not to laugh at Sherlock’s indignant frown and the doctor’s calm attitude. It wasn’t every day you met someone who was impervious to Sherlock Holmes. She was perhaps a little bit more thorough than she needed to be, enjoying her patient’s consternation. Finally, with a twinkle in her eye, she declared that he was fit to leave as well. John knew from experience that he could have well been out of here the day before; he imagined someone trying to get Sherlock to leave when he obviously had wanted to stay.
“I’ll try but… I’m feeling a little self-conscious, to be honest.” He gave him a little nervous smile. Sherlock relished the fact that he didn’t flinch away from his touch. Ever since he’d used the excuse of helping John with his stupid cufflinks he was looking for further openings to be close or touch him. It was ridiculous in the extreme, and nothing if not a little too obvious, but Sherlock had a hard time stopping himself when John didn’t even seem to mind.
John rolled his eyes and decided to ignore this revelation for now. He looked over to the bar and saw Sherlock making his move. “Oh God please don’t upset them,” he whispered. Greg laughed.
Sherlock wanted to interrupt him, but John held out a hand. “I’ll be angry, but I’ll still care. I can’t just switch that off.” He thought for a moment how much he was willing to say for now. But it was after midnight and they were doing this, so John went ahead. “Even if I could, I wouldn’t. You’ve changed my life so much for the better, and if I get shot for my troubles, I still wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”
“Don’t worry about it. I’m just doing that empathy thing I’m so good at, remember?” John tried to joke, but why his brain saw fit to supply him with another snippet of conversation from the evening he was at a loss to understand. Sherlock winced a little as well.
He spread it liberally on his toast and bit into it with relish. Sherlock nearly choked on his tea as he watched, already committing the look on John’s face to memory. Some honey dripped down his lip and he licked it off quickly. Suddenly that image combined in Sherlock’s head with the sensation of the rather intimate hug the night before, and Sherlock had to look away.
John cocked a small smile, looking resigned, and somehow that made Sherlock feel a little better. He nodded curtly, and they both slowly got back on their feet, crouching between the air cons. Sherlock left his coat, there was no time. The game was on.
. John believed him, of course. He narrowed his eyes now and leaned a bit closer. “Is this the empathy talking, John?” he deadpanned, and was rewarded with another,  more amused laugh. His lips snaked into a smile. “We should have that looked at.”
“It’s just—“ she began. She looked over to where Lestrade was arguing about the file with Sherlock, and caught a small glance Sherlock sent in John’s direction. “I’ve never seen
To Sherlock, things had become somewhat muddled in their own way. John was still a mystery to him; like he was his blind spot – easy to read, but not when it came to those odd feelings. Earlier, in the corridor, John had
“So I thought I’d just ask her and see if she would finally understand that it didn’t matter, after all.”
A pause. John felt a growing sense of panic build in his chest, and it wasn’t helping with the stampede in his head. The arms felt familiar. The scent was familiar. He couldn’t understand it at all.
“Oh.” Sherlock was surprised. He hadn’t even thought about it. John was shorter than him, so he supposed that the traditional roles were a bit reversed – but since John was the person dating women, it made sense to let him take the male part in the dance. “Yes, I guess you’re right. I taught myself to do both sides,” he said.
John laughed and walked her to the door. “Thank you, Sarah, for being so… honest,” he said, and he really meant it.
Sherlock blinked slowly as the words settled in. Then he frowned. “But why…? You two seemed… good with each other?” He felt like he could hit himself in the face.
In the churning water of the pool, they’d kept each other alive. Lightness enveloped his head. He was still in the water, still staring wide-eyed at this impossible human being in front of him, still breathing in John Watson. Through the blur, he was the only thing that remained in focus.
“About what you said last night. This is exactly my point. You’re… very important to me, and I’m afraid of something like the pool happening again. And if it does, and I’m there, then I will always—” he swallowed heavily and glared at Sherlock to get his point across. “—always try to jump in front of a bullet, or get myself blown up with the bad guy, or whatever it takes, to get you out. Trust me, nothing you can say, even if you try and make me angry at you, will change my mind on this. All right?”
Sherlock was staring back, his lips slightly parted in surprise. Slowly, almost forcibly, his eyes dropped to the towel slung around John’s waist. His eyes widened, and then travelled unbearably slowly up John’s torso, finally meeting John’s gaze once more. John blinked and tried to take in the widened pupils, to understand the flush that tinged Sherlock’s cheeks, mirroring his own.
John grinned and shook his head. He was still mad at Mycroft for not telling him about the Fall, but by now that was outweighed by how grateful he was on a basic level that Sherlock was still in one piece. Every time something from his time away came up, it didn’t sound like a picnic. Also, there was Molly’s “
Mary regarded him for a moment. “I’d like to think of it as choosing to ‘stay friends’ instead of trying to enter a relationship,” she said.
“No, I don’t suppose you would,” Mycroft said, seemingly considering it. “But please, you are visiting,” he said and took a step into the hospital room, opening the door further. Something in his voice sounded incredibly amused.
John blinked. A hundred questions immediately sprung to mind, but all he managed was a hushed “Mary, what the hell?”
“John,” Sherlock said again, this time with relief. His curls were in disarray, his lips slightly parted. He was lit only by the coloured lights from the street, making his cheeks and pale shoulders glow oddly in the dark. His fingers were clasping the blanket tightly, gripped by the same anxiety that had driven John out of bed.
John had had enough. “Sherlock,” he hissed, “who cares? Just give her the damn stick and let’s leave. There’s two dead bodies in the shed. We shouldn’t stand around here too long. We should call Mycroft, or the police or—”
“But why the hell didn’t you tell—“ Lestrade began again, and his gaze unerringly swept to John. He broke off mid-sentence, his face sobering a little.
“Convenient. And once you secured the information on this,” he waved the USB around, “you were just going to go back and hand it to the British government?”
Sherlock nodded and made to grab it, but Lestrade pulled it back. “Hold out your arm, it’s easier,” he said generously. A snide remark rose to Sherlock’s lips immediately, but something stopped him. Again, he realized it would be less annyoing to just let the DI do this than to get into an argument with him about it. He sighed and held out his arm, taking away his hand when Lestrade was ready with the plaster.
He quickly began pulling upwards. Sherlock kicked his feet, holding on to John with one arm. About halfway up, John felt the arm slacken
But Sherlock was on a roll now, so Mycroft simply sat there, watching him with a certain clinical detachment, wondering if his little brother recognized, let alone understood, that strange, tortuous feeling burning in his chest. He didn’t envy him for it, but strangely enough, Mycroft found that neither did he pity him.
Sherlock momentarily lost his train of thought. John wanted to be here, with Sherlock, despite the fact that Mary was asleep upstairs in John’s bed, despite the fact that Sherlock had lied and left… Despite it all, John was still here.
Quietly, he snuck out from under the covers and stretched. It was still dark out, and he decided to leave the lights off to let John sleep more. Silly waste of time to sleep so much, really, he thought, but after the ordeal of the previous night, perhaps they’d earned it. Sherlock proceeded to take a long, hot shower, wondering if John would object being woken up in a fashion reminiscent of last night. He hoped he wouldn’t prefer to sleep even more. Surely that could wait.
was too much of a liability,” she informed Sherlock with a smirk that Sherlock couldn’t help but appreciate. The subtle inference, playing as if she was some kind of woman of his (entirely
“Good morning,” he said quickly. “Mycroft is here. Perhaps a strategic retreat might be in order?” Sherlock glanced meaningfully at John’s delightfully rumpled state. John glanced up, gave him a shocked look as soon as he heard the name, and gathered up his blanket.
Sherlock sat back and glanced at his friend sideways. He must have done something wrong, because John looked completely exasperated. “Wh—“
There was a pause. As a reflex, John looked sideways over his shoulder, trying to get out of the position he was in, trying to gauge what Sherlock was thinking, standing this bloody close to him, making him lose every coherent thought the second after it was formed. As he turned, he lightly brushed up against him. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t—“ John muttered softly, before both of them froze.
He unbuttoned his shirt and slipped it off his shoulders, throwing it over the bed. Suddenly, he heard a small gasp behind him. He froze. He didn’t even need to turn around to know that John was standing in the half-open door, his hand poised to knock, staring at his back. In fact, he didn’t think he was physically able to turn around. His heart was suddenly desperately trying to fight its way out of his ribcage. He just stood there, his head turned partly to the side; he could make out John’s slow movement into the room.
But Lestrade was done with his ranting and had begrudgingly thanked him; and when he saw that that had almost no effect on John whatsoever, he had shut up. And now there was only the relentless pity in his eyes, the knowledge that nothing whatsoever could be said that would make it better. Yes, he definitely wished he was still shouting at him.
John sighed and shook his head. “Sherlock… how could you think that I’d believe what you said on that roof? That I would believe… for
Lestrade mercifully shut up and merely shrugged non-committedly. “Okay, fine; but let me know if anything happens, all right? Got money in the betting pool. You guys owe me that.” He drained his beer.
Sherlock stepped past John, towards the Pub. “Well, we better get in then, before Lestrade sprains his thumb snapping compromising photos.”
Sherlock ducked and shoved John forward just as Moran shot, missing them by an inch, the bullet impacting into the car door. “Go,” he urged John as they ran.
“Thank you.” He felt calm now, his curiosity satisfied and a feeling of contentment and safety settled in his chest. Sherlock would have done the same. Sherlock perhaps felt the same. Well, that was good enough for now. He felt his eyes close, and the last thing he remembered before falling asleep was his head dropping to a shoulder next to him, and a nose softly nudging his head.
Sounds of a struggle could be heard faintly thought the staircase. He dashed up the stairs. He’d just reached the first floor when he heard the shot ring out above him.
“Close enough,” John replied, and for a moment, he rested his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder. He felt Sherlock’s head turn and a nose nudge at his hair. He smiled in the darkness.
Sherlock didn’t feel guilty about Mycroft and Lestrade digging him out of a drug den, or about Mrs Hudson cleaning up his mess or about insulting people or throwing them out – he was not accountable to them and he never asked anyone to take care of him. But John, somehow, was different. It only added to the growing pile of very worrying details in his mind.
The back door opened to reveal Anthea. “I’m here to take you to Greenwich, she said, and Sherlock looked pleased.
’ that he thought was the same for everyone. Even if the sex wasn’t spectacular, even if he and the girl weren’t in love – it was still sex and that usually made people happy and relaxed. He understood the biological and chemical aspect of this, of course, so even if this was
Sherlock felt warm, just like last time. After he had crawled into John’s bed on Tuesday to chase away his nightmares, he had woken up early to an unexpected warmth emanating from the other body under the blanket. Definitely a new sensation and not entirely unpleasant in cold December.
Sherlock grinned at his friend and relief flowed through him in waves. “I won’t ask how you’re feeling as I’m certain you feel dreadful. No need to dwell on it. Here, you should drink something,” he rattled out, handing John a cup from his bedside table. John smiled weakly. He took the drink and with Sherlock’s help managed a few mouthfuls before he had to lie back down.
John got into the car and they headed off, towards the docks. “How do you feel about a stakeout?” he asked John.
However, he noted that his right arm, trapped between them, was aching and numb from the weight. John flexed his fingers against Sherlock’s body, and pulled very gently, so as not to wake his friend. He lifted his torso a fraction to raise Sherlock off the mattress and slowly rescued his arm. Lying back down, Sherlock shifted a little and nuzzled his face into John’s neck. John froze for a second. He felt Sherlock’s breath on his skin and his nose almost pressed into his pulse point. His heart sped up and in the silent room, his pulse thundering loudly in his own ears. He faintly wondered whether this would be enough to wake the detective, but Sherlock remained quiet.
Sherlock slowed and kept glancing at the small, illuminated map on the GPS. Finally, he nodded. “Hold on to your seat, John,” he said with a small smirk, and turned the SUV into a field.
John let out a surprised laugh. “I thought you didn’t know! I thought you were genuinely clueless about what was the matter!”
He had just picked up his jacket and stuffed the gun in the pocket when he heard the door. He froze. Through the open living room door he saw Sherlock’s lanky form ascending the stairs, taking two steps at a time. The man looked up from underneath his curly fringe and spotted John. His eyes travelled over him, taking in his state.
“Oh, bits and bobs,” Freddy said. “She has clothes and toiletries upstairs and some shoes in the hall. I think there’s books as well. She usually stayed over the weekend,” he said, swallowing heavily.
It was exactly 20 hours and 34 minutes after John had been shot, and Sherlock was bored. He was sitting on a hospital bed, his legs dangling out over the side, his shoes discarded on the floor. He was wearing a white uniform hospital-issued t-shirt over his dirty pants from the night before. His arm was hooked up to an IV drip. He wasn’t entirely sure what he needed it for, but it had something to do with people prattling on about shock, malnutriton and some painkillers for his throat, which had been injured by the almost-drowning and the breathing in of heavy fumes.
During the afternoon, however, Mycroft showed up and took them to a back office he’d commandeered from the hotel staff to have them confirm their statements on the ‘mission’. They’d been conveniently pre-written and somewhat edited, throwing their impromptu trip to Cornwall into a more official light. Also, the statements mentioned that Moran was shot in the ensuing escape, with no particulars as to the how and by whom. John eyed the document warily, as if it would suddenly turn out to be written in invisible ink or some such nonsense, before he sighed and, as he put it, ‘put his life into Mycroft’s hands once more’ by signing it.
Sherlock was transfixed. He felt vulnerable, confused and very much out of his depth. Yet somehow he needed to clarify this. “Isn’t that what you want? That sort of thing in your life?” he asked very quietly.
He rubbed at the ache in his neck and felt a weariness in his arms and legs that still hadn’t gone away after their struggle in the pool. John would probably tell him to ‘take it easy’ for a few days, whatever that meant, to recover from the ordeal, to get some sleep. Sherlock scoffed, but conceded that right now, another kip sounded rather good.
“No need.” Sherlock gave a slight wave of the hand and then cocked his head. John recognized his ‘deduction’ face. The widow remained more poised under his glare than most people would. “You were used to him coming home and leaving his work at the office. You never discussed what he does, because you both knew it was safer that way. You took pride in being married to a civil servant – but you are happily employed in a different field, no, wait, don’t tell me,” he glanced at the bookshelves, then back at her. “I’m thinking university professor, something scientific like biology or chemistry. I recognize a kindred spirit.” His lips quirked in a genuine smile for a moment.
“Well, if you’re incapable of having a normal conversation like grown-ups, please, indulge in your childish fits whenever you like.” Sherlock grabbed another prawn cracker and crunched on it sullenly, staring at the silent telly.
Sherlock went back to his bedroom and returned with some plain black cufflinks and four matching studs. “Pointless, since I only wear buttons as well, but they come in useful.” At John’s questioning look, he just shrugged. “I get lots of useless Christmas gifts from various relatives.”
“Shut up, I know all that,” he said, smirking. He remembered that Sherlock’s first words to him when they met had been a list of things that were supposedly ‘the worst’ about him, things that might prevent John from wanting to live with him. He’d been so confident with his list, confusing the hell out of one very unprepared army doctor; John would have never believed then that he would be the one to unsettle that confidence one day, to make Sherlock sound as he did now, trying to explain his perceived inadequacies.
John frowned. The sudden honesty actually surprised him more than the impromptu bed-sharing. He turned to his side. He could barely see Sherlock’s face in the hints of streetlight from the window. “What about?” His voice was almost a whisper.
Finally, they rounded a corner and came upon the dark front door of 221B Baker Street. They stood in front of it for a moment. It loomed in the darkness, like a full stop to the end of their ambling walk. It felt like a prompt to the next chapter of this evening.
There was a pause. Sherlock locked eyes with John, his lips pressed together in a thin line. John nearly held his breath. This was a whole new kind of emotional – seeing Sherlock in his family home.
“Dear Lord,” Sherlock muttered, but if anything, that got him to finish straightening the tie. He frowned, regarded John once again from head to toe and brushed some dust off his shoulder. “There, you’re perfect. Shall we?”
Finally, after what seemed like hours, everyone finally excused themselves to go to bed. Margaret, the last to leave, gathered her book and her glasses and turned to John. “Be a dear and turn the music off when you go to bed,” she pointed at the shelf. “Good Night, John.”
Sherlock went ahead downstairs, where Mary was waiting for them with some of the team. Sherlock heard voices from the downstairs flat. He dropped his bag at the bottom of the stairs and marched straight to Mrs Hudson’s, following the sound of
Sherlock comically turned his head back to the window, all injured pride and yet smirking underneath it all.
Sherlock was at a loss. He felt bored, but not painfully so. Looking at John sleeping somehow alleviated his need to do something. It was very strange, being slowed down like this. Definitely a new sensation, one that needed exploring and figuring out. But what was he going to do with himself for the rest of the time in the hospital? There was no emergency he could help with; Lestrade surely would have told him.
“Christ, you—oh my God, I can’t believe you did that!” He was shouting now. Sherlock gingerly pushed himself up, and slowly managed to stand by putting his weight on John’s arm.
now. It was admitted by both of them, he was allowed to touch Sherlock as much as he liked, and he had quickly found out that Sherlock didn’t appreciate it if he noticed John was holding anything back. Yes, there may be times when things wouldn’t be this easy, when they’d need boundaries and words and definitions; but for now this was exactly what he’d been missing. It had only been a week but it was already the best week of John’s life, no argument about it.
John’s eyes snapped up and he hiccupped one last stray laugh as his eyes calmed. He was still smiling, but something else crept into his look. He wiped away a tear that had escaped and took a deep breath.
“Unless Sherlock got on the job?” Greg suddenly grinned at Mycroft. The man looked surprised and amused at this statement.
Mycroft stood up, stretching a little after being sat on the uncomfortable chair. He pulled sharply on his suit jacket and sleeves, getting ready to go. “Well, this has been nice, Sherlock. I had a 50-50 chance depending on which one of you woke up first, you know. Doctor Watson would have received the usual reminder that if he hurt you, I’d have to kill him.”
and with unexpected embarrassment, John wondered if that had been meant for him. He thought of Sherlock lying next to him, holding his hand; his eyes strayed to the fine-boned fingers placing a slide under the microscope and warmth flooded his chest. If anyone could possibly
Sherlock’s lips pressed together in a tight-lipped, completely fake smile. “Yes, of course. See you there.”
There was perhaps a tension in the elevator at Danby’s that might not have been there before. Perhaps it was all in John’s addled mind. The problem was that he was fairly sure Sherlock could actually, truly, hear him think. And he was thinking a lot, and loudly, especially stuck in a small box with Sherlock for fifteen floors, imagining being pressed against the wall by his body again.
“You love it,” Sherlock smirked and steered them expertly onwards, into the dark, somewhere only he could see, apparently. His tone struck a note in John’s chest that made him forget about the bumpy trail, and he had to control himself not to accidentally say something terribly sentimental in return.
He was in love with him. As simple as that. A wild thought came into his head that even if this was the last closeness, the last hungover cuddle he’d get, he’d enjoy every second of it as much as possible.
you ask me this? We’re looking for evidence, John. And if she’s home, we’re perfectly situated to arrest her.” With that, he turned around and strode on towards the house. John could only follow – after all, they’d come this far.
Sherlock groaned into his hand. This was by far the worst Saturday morning he had ever had to endure, and that was counting that one day when he was forced to go shopping with Mummy and Mycroft. (After that, Mummy had discovered the joys of ordering online.) He gently extricated his limbs from John. His eyes rested another moment on John’s relaxed face and his closed eyes and his hands and… well, perhaps this wasn’t
John’s anxiety over the reporters was quickly making way for an entirely different kind of nervousness. He became even more aware of the lack of space between them. “Right,” he managed, trying to force himself to breathe normally.
“I’ll let you snog me in front of the entire Yard, if it makes you this happy,” he murmured, nuzzling John’s cheek and his breath tickling his ear. “But just so we’re understood, dear Doctor: I’ll be showing you off, too.”
“John. It seems I must be off again,” he intoned with a hint of sadness. It was impossible to tell if it was genuine or not.
In one brief glance, John felt as if his stomach had decided to ignore gravity today and a warmth rose through his chest and neck all the way to his face. He quickly made sure his mouth was clamped shut, as staring slack-jawed at Sherlock was surely a bit not good.
Mary handed John a cup of tea, then sat down next to him on the sofa. “Are you sure you don’t want me to stay?” she asked for the third time.
“Tuesday,” John said. “After the art gallery we went to a pub and… she just went home,” he explained. He noticed Sherlock’s eyes narrowing at him.
“Lady Smallwood had a communications chief for long range messages; trained in Morse code, shorthand and at least a dozen languages.”
Sherlock’s thoughts stuttered to a halt when he felt a hand at his side and slowly sliding round to his back.
“You don’t sound very surprised. Did Sherlock…?” She looked over to the detective, who was still sitting quietly in his chair, watching them both. John felt a distinct sense of whiplash. Moments ago, he and Sherlock had nearly… well, something had been ready to happen, and now he was sitting here, being a doctor and very, very tired.
He never thought that John would become his most difficult case to date. He needed to think clearly, and having this soft, warm body sleeping half on top of him, a body that smelled so familiar and so...
at this point. It seemed he had figured it out much sooner. Despite all the heartache and trouble, it was now absolutely obvious how he felt about Sherlock. Mycroft was sure that one or the other tabloid might even pick up on that fact the next day, considering how brightly the man’s eyes were shining.
, John thought as he stood in the posh bathrooms, washing his hands. How much more obvious could he possibly get? He’d let himself get carried away too easily, and now he was entirely confused as to what the hell was going through Sherlock’s head. He’d looked happy, positively enchanted during the dance, and John had basked in the glow of having made him feel that way.
“Bastard,” Mary muttered, staring at the carpet. “Ajay was good. He still is, from what I can tell. Even injured, he’s a serious problem.” She swallowed.
However, as John neared the Holmes’ house again, a new sense of unease was waiting for him in the shape of a large, black Sedan. He walked through the garden gate and saw Sherlock conferring with Mycroft on the front step. Something about the image niggled at his brain. He knew something about it was off, but couldn’t put his finger on it.
His assailant threw him against the wall where John connected painfully with several picture frames shattering under him. Sherlock jumped up with two bottles from the bar and crashed them against the man, who managed to get up an arm in time. It was still relatively dark, but the glass left several bloody gashes, making the man cry out. John was watching for an opening, hearing heavy footsteps above them. No doubt they’d be surrounded in seconds.
John felt Sherlock’s breath against the side of his face. He couldn’t see a thing, but they had to be close. “Good,” he murmured, a bit taken aback. He hadn’t outright said it but the implication was clear. They’d been in tough scrapes before, but there had never been a need to bring it up like this. That alone made it seem oddly real: They might not make it out of this alive.
John lay on his back, just breathing for a moment. Less than twenty-four hours ago, they’d been dancing; then the long drive to Cornwall, the night spent cramped up in a cellar in the certain belief they would die; the escape. A strange pressure weighed on John and he suddenly realised with a start that he was still reeling from the shock of what had happened. Yes, it felt like a panic attack, like something creeping up from his nightmares to clench around his throat.
Sherlock scoffed a laugh, but it was without humour. “You just feel the need to discuss it because you—you—“ he waved his hands. “You obviously haven’t been confronted with your bisexuality. Big deal. Perhaps you should think about it some more before we—“
John hummed his vague assent, still rubbing circles on Sherlock’s back, thoroughly distracted. Perhaps his glorious plan had backfired just a little bit.
. He dreaded to think what his own face was betraying to John. His heart hammered in his chest and heat rose to his cheeks.
. It also appeared that he wanted to put Sherlock at ease, let him know he wasn’t going to try anything more than that. Sherlock was surprised to note that it worked – he felt at ease. And suddenly, it was easy. He smiled and stepped forward to embrace John.
“Montgomery Blanchard, former aide to a British Ambassador,” Lestrade said, flipping open a notebook, sending one last glare at Sherlock.
Suddenly, John’s tongue darted forward and ran over his lower lip – and Sherlock’s conscious will finally dissolved into nothingness. He could not stop his own lips from parting slightly in response and John took that as an invitation to suck lightly on his lower lip. With a full-body shudder, Sherlock let his other hand encircle John’s shoulders to draw him flush against his chest. Neither of them really registered the crutch clattering to the floor.
Suddenly, his phone rang. Sherlock sighed and briefly considered simply ignoring it, but he thought perhaps a little goodwill tonight might help.
Sherlock stood by the window for a while after that, staring out at the people on the streets. His thoughts turned round and round, trying to figure out the case that wasn’t really a case yet—his return and John being in trouble somehow had turned into this new situation. Instinctively, Sherlock knew there was no going back to how things way before, no matter what happened next.
Finally, he realised that the room had gone quiet and two pairs of eyes rested on him. He quickly assembled his thoughts. “You’ll still be in some pain for a few days, but the wound was not as bad as they thought,” he assessed.
, until he realised that there wasn’t actually a lot of space left between them. John’s eyes looked impossibly dark in the low light and Sherlock was suddenly assaulted with memories of John lying on his lap, bleeding out; John keeping close to him to keep warm, getting paler and paler. A strange feeling gripped Sherlock’s heart, a feeling that was both pride and protectiveness, because he had gotten shot
After a moment of silence, he looked over at John. “Be sure to tell the doctor about this when he wakes up. He can put it in his blog,” he grinned at Sherlock.
Sherlock hummed into his folded hands. He wondered whether Mary realised that she was a target much more for being attached to John – and by extension, Sherlock. He decided to not enlighten her on this point. “So the only question that remains is this: who’s the mole? Do you think it was her?”
Mary followed his gaze back to the bed. “Right. I guess I’ll see if I can find us some drinkable coffee. Make sure he doesn’t go anywhere, yeah?”
Lestrade grinned. “Got you and John some clothes and things from your flat. Mrs. Hudson sends her love,” he added and tossed Sherlock the bag.
Sherlock jumped up and began pacing the small cabin. He vigorously scrubbed his hands through his shaggy hair. “So why come to me?” he burst out. “Why come all this way and tell me, in person? You didn’t tell me much  else about him in the last few months – I’m guessing out of some misguided attempt to protect me,” Sherlock added fiercely. “As if I didn’t know how John would react,” he added, almost to himself.
“Sir,” Evans stood straight. “About twenty minutes ago, it was discovered that our two subjects were missing. Miles was posted by the door. He was discovered unconscious, probably a sedative. They put him under observation for now. We haven’t found a trace of them, but they must have taken the fire escape. My team has begun searching the hospital on the chance they’re still there. The man who’d been shot was still recovering and couldn’t have walked very well.”
“I hope they paid you well,” John bit out, and the taxi driver shrugged and turned back. John fell back into his seat and sighed. It didn’t even matter if Sherlock were discovered – the cabbie was right. It wasn’t like they’d really tried to hide him all that well. Despite Mycroft’s invisible presence in the background, and in contrast to the meticulously planned details of Sherlock’s ‘death’, his return seemed incredibly well-planned. His temper flared. “Sherlock, who the hell are you
Sherlock stepped in, relief washing over him once again. Mrs Hudson was sitting at her kitchen table, seemingly none the worse for wear. A man from Mycroft’s team, equipped with a paramedic bag, was bandaging her wrist. “Oh! Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson nearly jumped up, but the man held her back with a look. Mrs Hudson had tears in her eyes, but it looked more like happy relief than anything else. The medic finally finished his task and told her to rest take care with her sprained wrist and then left.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock said, because he honestly didn’t know what else to say. His hand still rested on John’s cheek as he studied his eyes.
For a while, they swayed softly to the music. John wanted to keep calm, but his mouth was going dry. He really wanted to lean up to kiss Sherlock, yet something made him hold himself back. There was something off about Sherlock’s behaviour – he seemed wary of John, like he didn’t know how to touch him all of a sudden. John felt the same about Sherlock. He didn’t want to ask too much of him too soon; he didn’t want to damage this fragile thing they had. A bit of a conundrum, that.
. Of course he had to end up dancing with Sherlock Holmes and of course it was messing with his head.
As he neared the right room, Greg saw that someone had beaten him to it today. A tall man in an elegant beige suit was standing arrested in the doorway, an umbrella hanging from his arm. He turned around as Greg came closer.
His parched mouth and aching head aside, this wasn’t all that unpleasant. A smile stole onto his lips and he slowly brought up his arm around John. He closed his eyes again and took a deep breath.
Sherlock finally turned around and when their eyes met, her face softened into something even more motherly. “We haven’t had a chance to really… since you returned, and I thought—“ she gestured to a plate full of biscuits and then began pouring some tea. Sherlock went to the couch and sat down, pulling his legs up to his body. Mrs Hudson handed him a cup. “Thank you,” he managed. For the next ten minutes or so, they sipped their tea in silence, broken only by Sherlock devouring several biscuits and the occasional tinkle of the cups. Mrs Hudson said nothing and seemed quite content to sit with him, just like this. Sherlock thought that he had never been fonder of her than in that moment.
Sherlock leaned back as well. He stretched out his long legs on the table and looked at the ceiling in thought. “Hmm,” he mused, and closed his eyes. John could have laughed. If you’d asked anyone else this question, they would have simply made an educated guess or said the polite thing (people were sentimental like that).
The arms around him tightened as their mouths pressed and clashed and small moans escaped into quick gasps of air; and Sherlock pressed him back against the table, almost pushing John to sit on it, his hips insistent and his arms leaving no room to escape. There was no holding back this time. All of John’s questions had been answered and he sighed in relief and pleasure and sheer anticipation as Sherlock moved his head back for a moment and his eyes were darkened and shining and hungry and he brought out a breathless “absolutely,” and continued to pull John towards his bedroom.
He watched as the man unfolded himself from the couch again and prowled slowly closer. “The last time you had a chat about
He knew they couldn’t get out before the guard passed the door. They were flat against the wall behind the cabinet, and would be entirely obscured by the door if it opened. They stood motionless, Sherlock holding on to John’s wrist, and they listened to the footsteps coming closer.
He felt the buzz of the alcohol softening everything around him, lulling him in a pleasant cloud of acceptance. His worry over his relationship to Sherlock, the apprehension over the case, the snipers, the bloody secretary with a vendetta – it all seemed less of an issue. All he could see was Sherlock Holmes, his fingers steepled under his chin, asking Mary in a very serious voice, “have I, in a misguided attempt at reinventing myself, shaved off half my hair, dyed the rest of it a ridiculous colour and then proceeded to make an utter fool of myself in public?”
"I've been keeping tabs on Dr Watson," was the first thing Mycroft said as soon as he and Sherlock were alone.
Sherlock grinned. He loved that quiet assurance in John, that confidence that had briefly vanished after their shower together. He was glad to see it again, glad that he hadn’t ruined it before it even started. He thought about how sex had seemed so
Another silence. “You punched him. And then you kissed that other guy.” She sounded a little bewildered, as if she was sure she must be remembering that wrong.
Something flitted over the detective’s eyes, almost too quick to notice. “I’m sure he will,” Sherlock said vaguely.
Suddenly, a shot rang out; glass shattered and John and Sherlock ducked instinctively. Norbury cursed, but Mary seemed to be still upright.
He tied the towel around his waist and caught Sherlock staring at him, still not saying a word. They stood close, their towel-wrapped hips almost touching, and John marvelled at the fact that they’d been so intimate and yet it didn’t take away anything from the mystery this man was to him. Sherlock’s eyes wandered over John’s features, dissecting him for information. His expression was unreadable, and John wished he would just smile and say
“No, a lifeline,” John said, galled. “Moriarty would have killed her anyway, regardless whether she talked. She knew something. It was her last chance to use it.”
“John Watson. Doctor, crack shot, war veteran… but always so modest. I never took you for a show-off!”
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but he had nothing. The only thing on his mind (besides a slight dizziness) was the fact that John was right there, somehow blissfully unaware of his momentous discovery only last night. He let out a huffed laugh. “Always my doctor,” he said gently (
He stood up slowly, his eyes never straying from Sherlock’s. He stepped up to the foot of the bed, his breath heavy as desire slowly built. Sherlock audibly sucked in a breath and tentatively held out his hand. It was all the invitation John needed.
John smiled and with a quick movement, flipped Sherlock on his back, angling himself over him. “Because, my dear Holmes, as you well know, I care what people think. And they think you’re some unfeeling sociopath – as you keep reminding them.” He tangled his fingers in Sherlock’s hair and gently brushed his thumb over his forehead. Sherlock was still frowning in confusion.
Early in the morning, Mary finally joined him. She looked like she hadn’t gotten any sleep either and still wore the same clothes as last night. She hung her coat over a hospital chair, eyeing Sherlock a bit warily. Then she went over to the bed and rested one hand on John’s shoulder.
It was a slow day. John spent most of it watching Sherlock, still letting his mind adjust. He had some lunch and made sure to place a plate of toast  surreptitiously beside Sherlock on the desk. He grinned when he saw that he slowly but surely devoured the slices without even looking at them. John managed to actually steal his laptop back from him at some point and settled on his chair with it. He’d thought about this throughout the morning and had an idea what he wanted to write. He slowly began typing out a first draft of the account of Sherlock’s return. He detailed the attempted assassination and carefully reconstructed the evening from what he had learned from Sherlock and Mary’s comments. He paused a few times, unsure how to phrase his own reactions. He didn’t want to sound too sappy and when he read through what he had written, he felt he needed to delete a few lines because he was being too obvious. He didn’t want Harry or Stamford to make even more suggestive comments under his post than they had in the past.
“John? John!” Sherlock’s grip on his arm increased and sent a stab of pain into him, tethering him to consciousness. “Wake up. Stay here. Remember the drinks? You can have all the drinks! John!”
John was struggling to get his breathing under control. “No,” he pressed out, “I thought you…” He quickly reconsidered his words. This wasn’t the place or the time. “Never mind, we need—“
It was becoming late now. John stood by the window, watching the street like a hawk for taxis or greatcoats to come swirling around the next corner. Nothing.
It was also something new entirely to learn that someone could be so devoted, especially to him. Sherlock wasn’t exactly the kind of person who inspired devotion in others – he knew he was bossy and inconsiderate and didn’t expect anything from anyone. He’d known about John’s fierce loyalty and that he cared for him, but for the sake of his own sanity he hadn’t allowed himself to imagine how that might translate when having John in his bed. Suddenly, he just let himself give in to whatever their bodies demanded and it was a relief to know that he could finally, somehow, reciprocate the dedication John showed him; and from what he could tell, John was enjoying it thoroughly.
“I am,” the braver one of the two replied cockily and adjusted her top a little to reveal more cleavage. John felt this was the time to intervene and save them from what could only end in disaster.
They wove their way to the bar where they found Sherlock studying the barkeep intently. He was just about to open his mouth when John stepped up next to him, slapping him on the shoulder unnecessarily hard. “What are you having? Scotland Yard is buying.”
Mycroft discarded some ash on the driveway. His voice was amused, yet carefully distant. “Well.” He huffed out something that might have been a laugh. “I was simply wondering when you’re planning to put John out of his misery. The poor man can hardly do anything anymore without thinking of you. I saw him earlier and, well… he practically
“The stick, please,” she repeated, and slowly took a step towards them. At the moment, the desk separated them, but Mary seemed intent to slowly circle it. Sherlock moved towards his right, closer to John, subtly trying to keep the desk between them.
It was like watching a train wreck. John wasn’t sure whether to be amused or horrified. He couldn’t look away.
However, despite what Lestrade – and probably Mycroft, with all his surveillance – thought, John didn’t have a death wish. After he’d broken his arm, he’d officially stopped with the cases. He took the DI, as well as Harry, up on their offers and went to the pub on occasion, thinking that it was at least something to get out of the flat for.
,” he whispered. He looked pointedly into the wall of fog and inclined his head into the direction in which the little copse of trees would be.
“No, actually. I have far better things to do.” He lifted his chin a little. “Like travelling to the middle of nowhere to see if my dear brother is still in one piece.”
Helen sniffed again. “Well, it doesn’t matter now,” she said, and he heard tears creeping into her voice again. He instinctively felt that she needed to be a bit more distraction for now.
“Fine,” Sherlock mumbled after a moment and quickly went back to the bathroom. When he was done, he purposefully did not look at John as he passed him, clad only in his boxers and a t-shirt. When he returned from the bathroom, however, he found Sherlock had gotten comfortable on his bed.
“Don’t say.. that,” John said, frowning. All the same, there was something in the detective’s voice that arrested his thoughts. His light-headedness was becoming more pronounced every second. He was running out of time. Somewhere in his mind he felt something slot into place. That warm, pleasant feeling in his stomach suddenly turned into a jolt of panic. He realized he didn’t mind dying in Sherlock’s arms, strangely enough, but there was something he needed to say, something he’d been meaning to say, but he’d never found the right time. Suddenly, it
John let out a breath. “For a while there I forgot that the media circus around your return was only a week or so ago,” he said to Sherlock, who shrugged.
There was a polite knock and the door opened to reveal Anthea and the tall man in charge of the hospital security. Mycroft pushed the papers away from him and leaned back. He braced himself for whatever catastrophe was imminent.
John wanted to snap at him, to tell him that his faith in Sherlock should have never wavered in the first place, but he knew how officials and rules and regulations could get in the way of honest gut feeling. He blamed Sergeant Donovan a great deal, but he had forgiven Greg.
. John felt the tears finally escape his eyes. Suddenly, he remembered his words from what seemed like ages ago. They had danced together, John promising Sherlock,
sure whether either of them were actually standing still at all; he felt like he was walking on soft cushions strapped to his feet.
Sherlock blinked. John had spoken incredibly quietly and serious. He detected a slight tremor in his voice. Sherlock was about to answer him, but then stopped himself. Perhaps this wasn’t a good time to bring up a certain shelf full of questions yet.
Whatever state they were in now, Sherlock slowly began to realise that it was doing uncomfortable things to his chest and stomach. It was, actually, an entirely new kind of unpleasantness, something he hadn’t really encountered before.
"Good," she smiled. She held out her hand across John's body. "We haven't really been introduced yet, so... Hi, I'm Mary."
A few hours, another shower, and a hearty breakfast later, Sherlock and John made their way back to the hospital. They found Mary’s room on the second floor and knocked after a nurse had assured them that she was awake.
Thankfully, Sherlock was not heavy, and something in John’s panic seemed to give him strength. He felt the weight of the body rolling onto the poolside floor, and wasted no time to heave himself out of the water before his arm gave in completely. He registered the trail of watered down blood he left as he dragged himself next to Sherlock’s body.
Mycroft was silent for a moment. He’d never seen his brother in this kind of mood before. Usually, Sherlock complicated most of the actual conversations they had with untoward snide remarks and insults. To hear him actually talk honestly about something like this was fairly out of the ordinary. He waited for his brother to continue.
Suddenly, he tensed. There was a change in Sherlock’s breathing and then a rustle of fabric. The covers moved and Sherlock sat up with a start, calling his name.
“Yes, I do, Sherlock, it’s just... you don’t have to keep doing this. This tip-toeing around me. You don’t have to apologize.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and held out a hand to John. They managed to heave each other to their feet. They stood closely, John steading himself with his arms on Sherlock’s, when suddenly John’s eyes widened, staring at a spot on his chest, and he pulled Sherlock to the side, throwing them both to the floor again. Sherlock’s shoulder collided with the desk and he grunted at the sharp pain. “On the floor, stay down!” John barked. “Sniper. He’s here. Stay where you are.” He was lying on his side, his arms still held protectively around Sherlock where they’d fallen.
“Look, Sherlock,” he began. “You know something about her; something I bet was conveniently discussed when I was out. You… insinuated that on Saturday
They walked to the hospital lobby and John excused himself for a moment to hobble to the small shop he found by the entrance. When he came back with a bag of basic toiletries and toothbrushes, Sherlock joined him, walking slowly, giving John time to limp alongside him to the hospital exit. Before they went outside, John glanced back once and spotted Mycroft standing at the end of the corridor, giving them both a relieved smile he straightened his tie and turned away.
Sherlock looked up and they locked eyes for a moment, both their laughter stuttering to a halt. Sherlock’s gaze dropped to his throat. He slowly buttoned up John’s top button again and John’s breath deserted him somewhere along the way. He blinked, not knowing on what to focus; Sherlock’s soft curl right in front of him, the pale blue eyes, the elegant slope of his nose, his sharp cheekbones, the ridiculous Cupid’s bow… He wondered how it would feel to kiss him there. He blinked, trying to look somewhere else, a blush rising in his cheeks. He finally stared at Sherlock’s lapel, ready to count the bloody threads in the silk if that’s what it took to get his mind out of dangerous territory.
Moran shoved them forward into the open load area. John stumbled, his head hitting the edge of the van, grunting in pain. Sherlock painfully banged his shoulder against the open door, scrambling, trying to stay on his legs. They heard footsteps and more shouting, the sounds eerily muffled by the fog.
Mummy went back to talk to John. “Oh you’re a dear. Myc’ will take his old room of course and we’re going to have to put Mary in the guest room. That means you’ll have to shack up with Sherlock for a few nights, I’m afraid.” Sherlock felt a jolt go down his spine and he saw a quick glint in Mycroft’s eyes as he noticed it. He wondered whether Mummy, much like everyone else, had given John a suggestive look at that.
With a few long strides, Sherlock was over by the ambulance. John saw him and got up. He gestured to the rescue blanket on his shoulders. “They keep insisting on these bloody blankets,” he joked. “But at least they help with the drying.” As if to illustrate, he rubbed the blanket through his damp hair a little more before settling it back on his shoulders.
John took a deep breath, his posture relaxing a little. Sherlock could practically feel the wheels turning in John’s head. He noted that Sherlock hadn’t dashed away and that there was, in fact, an arm placed rather possessively around him.
Mycroft sighed heavily. “We’re all okay here, I think.” He quickly glanced around. He exchanged a look with Mary, who was still holding her injured arm, cradling it to her chest. She shook her head slightly and gave him an intense glare, and he accepted it with a nod.
Mary laughed and suddenly John relaxed. This was actually working, he thought. There was no more awkwardness between them, and he didn’t feel the need to constantly look away or hold himself back, lest she thought he was still trying to flirt with her. But things felt okay and settled all of a sudden, and he was glad to actually have someone else to talk to besides Sherlock – that tended to skew his perspective at times.
“You know, you’re a lucky guy, Sherlock. I hear he’s quite a catch,” he winked and quickly left, before Sherlock found something to throw.
Sherlock’s eyes met his and he smiled. “Not bad, Doctor.” Did Sherlock make that sound so suggestive on purpose? Or was that just his voice?
Sherlock ignored everything and went straight to the body, giving it the once over with his falcon’s stare. He was clearly in his element. John stood by and felt a familiar rush of horror mixed with adrenaline course through him. The body brought their bantering into sharp perspective. He felt his own inappropriate elation and, confronted with death again, couldn’t deny how extremely alive he felt. The reality of the dead man’s pale skin, unnatural pose and swollen face starkly reminded John that they were finally back among the living and that he had a job to do.
Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly, still staring down Mary in a silent battle of wills. Yet slowly, he was coming back to himself, his eyes narrowing, flickering over Mary’s poker face.
“No thank you, that’s quite all right,” Sherlock answered in the same voice and immediately turned away, as to not show familiarity. He suspected that Mycroft was doing his own reconnaissance as usual on functions of this kind. Ricardo was probably there to work for more than one reason. He left to do his rounds and Sherlock quickly slipped the small key card Ricardo had passed him into his pocket. He toasted John and they had a sip of their drinks. “We’ll have to wait until after dinner. During the dancing it will be much easier to slip away.”
“Oh, none of that, please,” Norbury tutted. She waved her pistol in John’s direction, and he promptly let go again. “I read the blog, so of course I wondered,” she smirked darkly. Sherlock felt his skin crawl when her nasally voice took on a hard edge. “But if you were planning a romantic Christmas together, you really shouldn’t have come here.”
“You SPRAINED your WRIST? Sherlock, you complete cock! You could have broken your NECK!” John was absolutely certain he’d kill Sherlock once they got home. Scratch that, he’d kill him right now, for making him think—
Mycroft sighed. “You know what, let’s just… stop with the bickering and the stupid games for a moment,” he rubbed a hand down his face and dropped into a chair.
A sliver of moonlight reflected of a blond curl, sticking out of a black beanie hat. “And I’d like to have it, please,” Mary said, stepping fully into the room.
There was a beat. Next thing, all of a sudden, John broke out into a fit of laughter. He fell back against the cushions, snorting, a hand held in front of his face. Sherlock merely glared at him. He got the feeling it was something he said.
Despite everything, Greg Lestrade simply liked watching the man work. Sherlock was closely reading the file he’d brought, examined the pictures and
The doctor gave John the familiar, commiserating sigh of the long-suffering spouse and wished them both a good day.
After passing what felt like a hundred different offices, Sherlock finally stopped. “This one,” he said, and John stood watch as Sherlock opened the door with the card. There were no guards around, but John had seen a few cameras. “Won’t we be picked up by the surveillance?”
“So.” Sherlock smoothly crossed his legs and picked up his violin from next to his chair. He toyed around with it for a bit, pulling strings and testing its feel in his hand, under his chin. John wondered if he had missed the instrument as well. He was almost holding his breath, knowing that something was definitely on Sherlock’s mind. He raised his eyebrows in expectation.
John held up a hand diplomatically. “Freddy, I don’t know what they told you, but we know the gist of it. We were on the boat. Now where’s Helen?”
John arrived at the client’s place about an hour later. After getting dressed and having breakfast, he vaguely felt like a human being again, albeit a bit tired. The house was a nice suburban place, not too shabby from the looks of it. He went up to the gate, rang the doorbell that said
John sighed. “Yeah, I think I understand now why Mycroft wanted to get in touch with you. He probably wanted to take you to a safe house.”
John couldn’t muster the energy to defend himself. “No, I don’t,” he said obstinately, and placed his palms on the table, ready to get up. “And I think I’ll call it a night. Thank you for the drink.”
It was the same question he’d asked two weeks ago, his wrists still bloodied from the chains, his back hastily covered in bandages.
Sherlock never got the chance to reply. A deafening noise erupted from outside, as a violent explosion rocked the building. The windows burst inwards, shards of glass hailing on them with a vengeance. The shock propelled Sherlock out of his chair, straight into Mycroft, who fell backwards off the toppling armchair with a grunt. John was barrelled off his feet and collided into Mary’s chair, throwing them both to the ground. Picture frames and forgotten teacups crashed to the ground, papers flying around them like leaves in a gale. Car alarms sounded on the streets. A dust cloud gathered around them. Somewhere, people were screaming. For a moment, nobody moved.
“Wow,” John chuckled, meeting his gaze. “You wouldn’t believe how many Johns, Jacks and Davids we have in our family.”
Sherlock remembered their conversation from the hospital. He couldn’t get over his first mistake; she was a very, very good liar. She could have told them –
After a moment of hesitation, Sherlock followed him. He stood in the doorway to his own bedroom, watching John get into bed. John paused. He searched Sherlock’s face and noticed that there seemed to be a hint of insecurity there that he’d never noticed before. He smiled and got back up again. He padded over to Sherlock and quickly made a decision.
Before he had made up his mind, however, John returned. He brought the smell of the shower with him, and he was rubbing a towel through his hair. Closing the door behind him he threw the towel over the chair, his hair now sticking up at all angles. He didn’t catch Sherlock’s eye, but threw himself on the bed again, his pyjama bottoms sticking to his damp skin, brushing alongside Sherlock’s arm at his side. He sighed, but it sounded just a bit ill and not actually romantically motivated.
John mentally summed up how he must look: Ruffled hair, pyjama pants sitting askew on his hips and basking in an afterglow that could probably light up the whole of Baker Street. More obviously, he’d just walked in from the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom and, oh, right, kissed him in the doorway. He also realized he’d probably stolen Lestrade’s tea.
After a while, Mary came back and wordlessly handed him a coffee. She sat down again and Sherlock zoned her out, sipping on his cup, leaving his thoughts to wander. Mary just remained sitting there, watching him and John. And Sherlock slowly began to realise
He absently noted that the IV drip on his arm was long empty and he ripped the needle out of his arm. He pressed the heel of his hand on his elbow, stopping the bleeding, and ripped his arm free of the taped tube. He contemplated simply removing his hand immediately, but he’d probably bleed all over the white hospital bed. In his mind, he heard John’s voice point out that that was
He had also believed that John would be sentimental and expecting things, but the only expectation he’d seen in his eyes earlier had been decidedly one Sherlock didn’t mind at all. Frankly, he wanted to devour him, pull him closer and simply find out what happened next, he wanted to let go of his burning feeling clenching his chest and for once, he wanted to be thoroughly distracted. This
“You realize of course that your... association,” he raised a suggestive eyebrow, “will always put Doctor Watson in danger of some form or other.”
Exactly 11 hours and 28 minutes ago, John had come to. He was hooked up to a heart monitor and several other gizmos Sherlock didn’t pay any attention to. What mattered was that his eyes blinked open blearily in the morning sunshine falling in through the window.
The first thing Sherlock registered was a dull throbbing in his head. The next was that he wasn’t alone. A warm body was pressed close against his side, an arm thrown over his chest and a leg hooked over his own. John was still sleeping peacefully, effectively trapping Sherlock in a very warm cocoon against the bed.
“Only two people could have taken that call at that specific time: Lady Smallwood or her communications chief, a Ms Deborah Lungley. The same line that received the ambassador’s call made one other call to another secure line within MI5 that same day. The number was blocked in a way only the highest ranks in your excuse for a civil service would be. One day later, Ms Lungley was found choked to death in her flat in Holborn.”
Mary was watching him, sitting casually at the table. She wore a dark tank top and one of John’s plaid shirts was draped over her shoulders. He could make out the traces of the thick bandage on her arm. He quickly looked away when he saw her calm smile. “Good morning,” she said. Her voice was steady and calculated, but not unfriendly. She rather looked like she was in her element, somehow.
“B-ut— for some in-insane reason, you’re… in love w-with him,” she managed, a weak smile on her pale lips.
“I’m afraid not.” Mycroft smiled politely. “Do enjoy your evening,” he said glibly, and didn’t that sound suggestive as hell when he accompanied it with
John dropped the fairy lights he’d been holding on the table and stepped closer to wrap his arms around Sherlock. “Now and again?”
The next thing Sherlock knew was that all of a sudden it was noticeably brighter. He blinked sleepily and lifted his head, but there was something heavy on it. As he moved, he felt fingers slip gently from his hair and a hand dropped clumsily onto his shoulder. Sherlock froze and took in the situation. His head had rested on John’s chest, where he must have fallen asleep several hours ago. His arm was still draped protectively over John, and he felt from the gentle rising and falling under his arm that John was still asleep.
, indeed. He’d wanted to know, didn’t he? And now he heard it in his own words, in that incredibly deep timbre, his sarcastic reprimand leaving no doubt whether they’d both understood what was being said. Sherlock was clearly annoyed by his prying, and John almost felt that it would be better if he had never known.
Sherlock made to pick up one of the boxes, saying “I’ll just take these to the bins,” but John’s hand suddenly held his forearm in a strong grip. Sherlock raised his eyebrows at the doctor and opened his mouth to speak when John burst out, “Just sit down, will you?”
All the way back to Baker Street, still fighting his body into submission, he couldn’t stop thinking that Harry had never been more wrong about anything in her life.
Over the course of the next half hour, they found themselves accosted by several people who came to personally shake Sherlock’s hand or exchange a few pleasantries, inquiring about his extraordinary return and the like. Presently, a petite, quite striking looking young woman in very simple, expensive dress joined them on their way to the banquet room. She was attached to the arm of a very bored looking man. Sherlock recognized her immediately.
John breathed in deeply and nodded once. “Yeah. I’m fine. No harm done,” he said but then sneezed violently. He drew the blanket a bit closer around him, shivering a little. “Almost.”
– and gave her husband a fond look. “That was too easy and you know it,” she chided. Richard merely kissed her in response and John’s heart melted a little for the two of them. He leaned a little closer towards Sherlock and looked over. His hair was mussed and his cheeks pink from drinking the entirety of the sherry by himself. He had undone the top buttons of his shirt and John now found it hard to tear his eyes away.
John sighed. “I don’t think she was that important to him. I think he just wanted to mess with us,” he said quietly, finally voicing his fears. It sounded conceited in his ears.
John swallowed. He had to get this off his chest before Sherlock derailed him completely with his shifting attitudes. He was trying to say,
While he was writing, he noticed that Sherlock was becoming more and more agitated. He paced for a while, then began haphazardly pinning notes to the wall, creating a tableau of what they knew about the assassinations so far. He stared at it for long stretches of time, then went back to his phone. He went into his bedroom to make a couple of calls, and by the end of about an hour of this, John couldn’t concentrate on his draft any longer.
, really,” he continued in his most sarcastic tone, wrestling his rapid heartbeat into submission. “Especially seeing as you’re trying so very hard to make it look like it belongs. It’s just like you. The watercolour landscapes in the hall – you bought them all together but had them framed by different people. Why? To make it look like you collected them over a longer period of time than the one you’ve actually lived here.”
Lady Smallwood stared at Sherlock. “Grow old,” she murmured. “Yes, she did mention she wanted to retire soon. I made jokes about it with her.”
, in fact, more than spectacular, and John knew he was on his way to being very much in love; and yet afterwards, John was standing in the tiny bathroom of 221B Baker Street, drying himself with a towel, gazing at Sherlock with worry. His fingers were wrinkly, and he had honestly no idea how long they’d spent under the shower together. Even after they had both been sated, they simply had leaned against the wall, tangled into each other, letting the hot water soothe them, the steam mingling with their exhausted breaths. Every trace of the cold Thames water had been washed away and replaced with prickling heat. The afterglow seemed to make Sherlock’s skin even more irresistible than it already was, and John couldn’t stop touching him. He buried his face in the nape of Sherlock’s neck and let his hands roam his body, listening to Sherlock’s breaths slowing down. Sherlock pressed a few stray kisses on his hair, his neck, whispering his name. But eventually, he stopped.
“Sebastian Moran,” Sherlock enunciated every syllable with distaste. “He was the one who picked up the pieces after Moriarty was gone. We saw glimpses of him all over Europe. I… ran into him in Serbia,” he added with a dark look at Mycroft.
John was soundly asleep, his head resting in the crook of Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock’s arm was inexplicably around him, as if he’d tried to pull him closer during his sleep. The thought created a warm and fuzzy sort of sensation in his stomach that Sherlock wasn’t sure he was quite awake enough for. John’s arm was lying protectively across Sherlock’s chest. It was warm and comfortable, and Sherlock had no idea how they had gotten to this point.
He gently kissed Sherlock again, to make up for the missed opportunities, now and for all the times before. It was just a soft press of lips, but he immediately felt Sherlock’s entire body melt into him. His thumb was smoothing circles over Sherlock’s skin, trembling at the closeness. He kissed him again, a little longer this time, and simply enjoyed their lips sleepily learning each other’s shape.
John’s eyes widened. The medical part of his brain immediately recognized this as a viable solution. The rest of it saw fit to shorten out. Yet there was no time to think about it. They needed to breathe. So they could either risk the firey debris and smoke on the surface, they could drown, or they could try to share their air as long as they managed, buying some time. He nodded.
Sherlock seemed perfectly fine with what happened – unsure, inexperienced perhaps, certainly a little overwhelmed with all this new
“Time of death,” John said, checking the body again. “Hard to say with so little blood, but I’d say no more than four or five hours ago.”
They looked out of the window a bit longer. “It’s like living inside a theatre performance,” he finally added. “But as long as it keeps us all safe…”
He quickly ate the remains of the last pork pie, not looking at his father, who was still scrutinising him. “Your doctor is a clever man.”
Later, John was never able to recall how they managed it. He draped one of Sherlock’s arms over his shoulder, and Mrs Hudson held on to the other one, walking backwards up the stairs. She dragged and John heaved, and Sherlock at least kept his legs steady and didn’t impede their progress too much. They reached the landing, and as soon as they stood, Mrs Hudson scurried around Sherlock’s other side and helped to carry him.
“Night,” Sherlock said. He looked through his microscope again, listening to John’s steps fading on the stairs. At some point he blinked; he didn’t know how long it took him to see that he’d forgotten to put the next slide in.
,” Mycroft began. “But we have reason to believe that there is someone who does not approve of Miss Morstan’s new life. She is being followed.”
He narrowed his eyes, carefully folded the newspaper and put it aside. He regarded Sherlock for a moment. “You know what? I am not playing,” he said. “If you know something about her that I need to know, tell me. If it’s something I don’t need to know, then shut up; she’ll tell me if she wants to. She has a right to her privacy.”
All of these recollections buzzing through his mind slowly awoke the rest of his senses past his own throbbing head. There was something heavy pressing down on him and he noticed the familiar smell of John’s shampoo. He moved his head a little and blinked.
Finally grasping the kettle, John moved over to the cups on the table and filled them quickly. When he put down the kettle, he noticed the slightest of tremors in his hand. And so, of course, did Sherlock.
John closed the gate behind him and walked up to Mr. Rodney, who straightened and shook John’s hand.
John smiled again, still trying for normalcy, and they sat and drank tea and let Frederick Rodney talk them through the case. His girlfriend (and from what it sounded like, soon-to-be-fiancée if Freddy had anything to say about it) Helen was missing. He had reported it to the police when she didn’t show up for a date two days earlier and hadn’t taken his calls or answered the door when he went to her flat. The police had naturally assumed
a nurse but who John suspected was – like Mary – much more than that. Perhaps they could share stories. Some team or other was securing 221B, Mrs Hudson was on her way to her sister’s, Lestrade was having a fit (evidenced by a long string of worried texts) and John and Sherlock were safe and sound, ensconced inside what was most definitely much more than a living room.
“Precisely.” Mycroft carefully picked up the file again, making sure all the stray papers were tucked safely inside.
John shrugged. “Maybe. It’s a habit that sort of started when he was… you know. Dead.” He cleared his throat.
“Hmm.” Sherlock decided to ignore the question and searched John’s face instead. He finally had the opportunity to study those dark blue eyes again and he wasn’t going to waste it. The look in them was slightly wary, bemused and still exhausted.
The kiss was sweet and simple and John hoped it conveyed something of what was going on inside him before he broke away. He stayed close to Sherlock for a moment, their noses almost touching.
Sherlock's eyebrow quirked upwards. "Sherlock Holmes," he said and shook her hand. His eyes flitted over her face and posture, taking in all the little details. He catalogued her smile, her eyes, her hair, the quirk of her lips – and came to the startling conclusion that, all things considered, she seemed
“John?” She approached the bed and laid a hand on his arm. He was blinking and licking his dry lips. “Mary?” he asked, still disoriented. Mary reached out and helped him sit, then handed him a glass of water. “Here you go, this should help.”
He knew what he wanted and he was pretty sure he knew what Sherlock wanted at this moment and that thought alone turned making tea into one of the most complex tasks he’d ever attempted. His thoughts swirled uselessly around the question of why Sherlock had been so quiet after the shower, why he’d been so affectionate the next morning, and what had changed in between.
John said, “I know.” Lestrade departed soon after, leaving the newspaper behind. It took John three days to finally glance at it, and he was right. He knew everything that was in there; he’d known it all from the very start.
“He is?” she said, looking deflated, but then her eyes narrowed. “How do you know?” She sounded indignant, the alcohol making her rather blunt.
He admitted that he scrubbed up fairly nicely, all things considered. Suits just kind of worked on him, and he was suddenly very glad he was spared the annoying job of having to go out and buy one. The only suit he owned before this was one he’d worn to court dates and the like. This was certainly an improvement. Now he only had to act like he
Sherlock leaned on the bar, closer to his friend. “Just returning a favour,” he said. “It seems appropriate.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed at John and the words were out of his mouth too quickly. “I’m selfish and possessive. You only figure this out now?”
When John awoke, he was alone, in Sherlock’s bed. Unfortunately, he was also utterly sober by now. The drunk abandon of the night before had faded completely, as had the soft, hungover sentimentality of the early morning. He sat up, holding a hand to his head. Intense embarrassment swept through him. A million thoughts pushed through his aching head. He looked around. Through the drawn curtains he saw dull light and heard the noise of the street. It was probably sometime in the afternoon. He hadn’t slept this long in ages. Not that he felt exactly refreshed or rested.
that John hoped very intently wasn’t regret. John usually made jokes when he was with a girl who seemed self-conscious or shy; he knew it would be better if he made them giggle, make them feel at ease. He liked for things to be relaxed and fun after sex, and he knew he wasn’t a half-bad lover, experience being a dependable teacher. But that had been the previous John, who took normal girls on predictable dates and who was
Things had been simpler once, back when all it took was a dangerous chase through London for John to lose his walking stick. It was infuriating to Sherlock to feel so helpless – what else did John want him to say? He explained, he promised never to go away again. Somehow, John either didn’t hear him or didn’t believe him. And he simply did not know how to get John to believe in him again.
“People tried to interview me, first after you jumped—and then after we cleared your name. Then, of course, people thought I was trying to make money off of your death or something—“ he sighed, not wanting to go into the story of his short-lived vigilante stint. “And now… for once, it would have been nice to be in control of it, and I’m angry that we were so careless.” He felt better for having finally said it.
Out of the occasional gaggle of officers streaming past them towards the stairs or elevators, one constable came up to her and handed her a cup of coffee from one of those cardboard holders. She mumbled something about one being left for her and Sally accepted it without thinking, cradling the warm cup in her hands.
“Of course. Well, shall we put the old lady’s mind at ease?” He whipped out his phone to call their client. Out of the corner of his eyes, he kept seeing John smiling at him. Yes, this week was definitely as close to perfect as it could be.
He hopped off the bed, opened the door with his elbow and walked into the corridor. The hospital was darkened, it was late, and he saw nobody around. A little down the hall, Sherlock found a small medical cart. Still grasping his arm with his hand, he tried to rummage through the things on the cart to find a plaster or something.
“Shut up, Doctor,” Moran grumbled and picked up John in a similar manner, depositing him on his feet. His expression told Sherlock how much he enjoyed seeing them disoriented like this, but the rest of his body told him even more.
He sent her a quick message asking how she was and didn’t say anything about Mycroft. Let the meddling twit find her by himself; perhaps she didn’t want to be found? The thought made John frown. He hoped she was all right. Somehow, the thought that she managed to hide from
He raised his head a fraction and glanced up. There was silence around them in the hall, but he could hear something - someone - moving upstairs. John noticed his changed demeanour and frowned. His eyes darted up as well. “What?” He whispered, his breath a soft exhale against Sherlock’s chin.
Her brunette friend steadied her, but she was not giving up yet. She raked her eyes over John once again. Apparently, she liked what she saw. A suggestive smirk settled on her lips. “Well… I don’t suppose you two would be up for—”
Sherlock was enjoying himself. He was with his favourite person and there were no annoying others to interfere or be stupid at them. The conversation was light and relaxed ever since John had gotten over his initial awkwardness. Sherlock was still processing what that had been about – he was sure it was what he thought he was, but at the same time, he was once again second-guessing himself every time he assessed John’s feelings. Apart from these occasional thoughts, it was great. They were on a case, they would get the drop on the smugglers, and Lestrade would gape at him some more when he delivered them the right boat with the goods. All in all, a most satisfactory way to spend an evening.
Having only treated Sherlock for shock and the after-effects of his ordeal, the doctor ordered more rest as well, at which Sherlock merely rolled his eyes. The doctor smirked. She turned to John and lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “My husband is exactly the same. No consideration for his own well-being. Make sure he eats and drinks enough.”
However, there was the matter of his parents to consider. And John. Sherlock did not wish to upset his mother, knowing full well how the whole ordeal of his fake death had taxed her. He also realised that John had truly looked happy to be here, relaxing for the first time in days. And John’s wellbeing was suddenly important, paramount even. Anything was worth doing if it meant John looked a little more alive than he did before. And it was doing things to Sherlock, seeing him like that, realising he was the reason John was smiling again.
; he knew it was incredibly dangerous. Such was the terror of infatuation and sentiment. But for the first time in a very long while, he remembered why people bothered with feelings and all of the mess that followed in the first place.
,” she teased. To make matters worse, she even bumped into his side with her elbow. Mycroft groaned.
For that one moment, they were frozen in time; but the spell broke when John’s eyes glanced past Sherlock and to something behind him. He blinked and looked up again. He swallowed drily and very slowly, very gently stepped away from Sherlock. Not too far, but enough to extricate himself from the hand caressing his hair. He smiled, his eyes reassuring Sherlock, but he still moved away. Sherlock felt a pout coming on and tried to regain some of his composure. He must have failed, though, because John gave him an amused smile. He removed his hand from Sherlock’s arm and pointed.
Sherlock heaved their bags up the stairs and trudged towards the bedrooms. He first entered the guest room, a small, functional affair done in unassuming colours, a single bed in one corner, a chest of drawers on the opposite wall. He dropped John’s bag on the bed and continued to his old room next door. It was mostly how he left it last time he had been in his parents’ house. The ceiling stains from his teenage chemistry experiments had long been painted over, the wallpaper replaced, some of the furniture rearranged. One shelf still contained lots of old books that he hadn’t been bothered to take with him. A new desk was under the window, as the old one had been near death after the amount of stuff Sherlock had exploded, burned or welded on it. However, his large bed was still there, and Mummy had made it up with the nice dark blue sheets she knew he liked.
John glanced up to see Sherlock give her a fond smile. He knew that look now. For all his protests earlier, to Sherlock, Mrs Hudson was family, so of course if she was showering their new relationship with her blessings, that was certainly okay.
Greg cocked a smile and got up, shaking his head. Back to normal then. With a few exceptions, he thought, glancing at John. He gathered up the folder and his jacket and made for the door. When he was almost through the door, he held it open for a moment and looked back, unable to keep quiet one last thought.
John clenched his jaw and felt his heartbeat quicken. He crossed his arms and braced himself for whatever altercation was to come. Sherlock looked up and met his eyes with an unfathomable expression. They stood there frozen for a moment.
“Fifteen minutes,” he said, and turned to pay the cabbie. John took a breath, steeled himself, and exited the taxi. A breath of cold winter air greeted him. He drew himself up, weathering the few calls of “Dr Watson—!” around him.
him exactly how little he cared what other people thought what they did or did not do together. Another shudder went through him. This would not do. These strange new sensations, whilst fascinating, were definitely a distraction of the most annoying calibre. He tried to put them aside on his ‘figure out later’ shelf.
Sherlock pointed to the various containers he had assembled in turn. “Fibre from a hospital bedsheet,” he began. “Traces of linoleum cleaned with that cheap bulk-order chemical they use to clean here; traces of disinfectant they use on the equipment.”
“No, no,” he waved her off. “It’ll do me good to walk around a bit, and it’s not exactly noisy or strenuous, so I think I can manage.” He gave her a brave smile. Anything to get out of the house a bit, to stop him and Sherlock simply staring at each other, not knowing what to do with themselves.
Sherlock smiled and thought how nice it was to see John get along with his parents. Him calling them by their first names was charming, he had to admit.
“John,” Sherlock said, and the sound of it gave John’s heart a little wrench. He didn’t want to think about it again, dammit.
They walked into the Yard and made their way to Lestrade’s office. On the table were two already empty coffee cups and Lestrade was nursing a third. He looked a bit rough around the edges, but otherwise not bad for a man they’d had to drag into a cab less than twenty-four hours before.
Sherlock didn’t touch his glass yet. He wore a rather amused expression and stared at John, his eyes twinkling dangerously. “Having fun?”
“What? Oh, I’m just taking some notes about an experiment I want to try…” he typed something into the phone, not looking up.
. I had to try, even if you didn’t—“ he heaved another breath, feeling like he might hyperventilate. “You
“Probably not.” Sherlock shuffled back around just as they both heard the rattle of a door from upstairs. John stepped forward to listen. Footsteps were coming closer, and a light shone through the crack under the door.
Mycroft grabbed the phone, listened for a few seconds and Sherlock saw his face hardened. "We're on our way,” he said, already beginning to walk away, Sherlock hot on his heels.
John was mildly surprised that he didn’t break the front doors as he ran out. A few startled officers moved as if to stop him, but Lestrade’s shouts from behind made sure he could pass. He sprinted around the right side of the building, turned the corner and connected sharply with the fake constable. She looked a bit roughed up, her hat was missing and she had a few scrapes. Without thinking, John simply decked her in the face. She had seemed to know what she was doing earlier, but she had certainly not seen this coming. John realised that if he had delayed by mere seconds, the woman would have blended into the crowd again and easily disappeared. She was dazed, but still tried to run. John mercilessly struck out his legs at just the right moment and grabbed her arm, tripping her up, rendering her unable to reach for her gun. He heard Lestrade’s shouts then, and a group of Met officers including him and Sally came running around the corner. John swirled around and he unceremoniously shoved the woman in their general direction. She protested, claimed it was all a mistake, but John wasn’t listening any more, his attention riveted on the figure ahead.
“It’s… I know how it sounds, Sarah, but… it’s brilliant seeing how he works it all out. And I feel like I can help, at least a little.”
to what we’ve just been through, you could have predicted this reaction before it even happened!” He was fuming now. Sherlock remained where he was, simply looking at him.
“Sherlock?” he called in the direction of the other bedroom. “Do you have some cufflinks? I only wear buttoned shirts.”
. John was still breathing quietly and peacefully next to him. Sherlock looked over and smiled. He brushed the back of his hand gently over the blonde hair, and John made a contented little noise in his sleep. Sherlock let out a little huff, somewhat in disbelief. What a night.
Sherlock felt his face relax. He nodded. He’d never wasted time to think much of the morons he usually had to work with on emergencies. Perhaps she was an exception. Or perhaps he was feeling generous because she’d told him John would be all right.
At one point, John neatly toppled off the sofa, either from laughing or simply from trying to lean over to Sherlock for… something, he wasn’t sure. He decided that the floor was safer and leaned against the other sofa, resting his arm and his head directly by Sherlock’s side. Mary gave him a secret grin, her cheeks flushed from the wine and her eyes softening.
He stared and stared some more, drinking in the realisation. Finally, John gave his back one last slow stroke that made Sherlock’s eyelids flutter nervously. “When we’re back home, I’ll get you something for the scars,” he murmured softly. “Seeing as they’re so…,” his breath caught momentarily “…fresh, um, you can treat them. They’ll become invisible over time.”
Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering his mind palace, Sherlock was startled out of his thoughts by John’s voice.
“I’m glad we got you out okay,” John said, unsure when he should broach the subject of the gun she currently held.
Sherlock was lying on the extravagant kingsize in his part of the room, letting his body dissolve into the fluffy mattress. He was only clad in a pair of silken pyjama pants and refused to wear anything else. After a few months of being bundled up in disguises of varying degrees of horrible, he made a firm vow to go naked for a week to make up for it – of course, Mycroft had taken issue with that, so pyjama bottoms were agreed upon.
Outside, Sherlock waved into no particular direction and moments later, a cab materialized by the curb. John , propping up Greg’s slumped body, just shook his head.
“Montgomery was cleared, but he came to me afterwards and told me his side of the story. It seemed that he really didn’t know anything about sabotage or any rescue missions, but he did happen to find himself in possession of certain security tapes just two weeks before the incident. He watched them and passed on the most salient points to the ambassador. At the time, he didn’t take note of it, but he said to me that looking back, the ambassador gave the impression that Montgomery had unwittingly handed her something valuable.”
“About Mary…,” John began slowly, and he saw that he immediately had Sherlock’s attention by something snapping into focus in his eyes.
Sherlock strolled down the corridor and joined him on the steps. “No,” John said slowly. “Glad you came looking for me though. This place is a bit...”
“Oh.” John’s eyes widened and he swallowed heavily. Then he lowered his chin and moved over to stand by Sherlock’s side, like a protective guard. He looked at Mary. “And how does your nutter fit into all this?”
When he had been younger, Mycroft had always felt overwhelmed by the whirlwind that was Sherlock, the uncontainable bursts of emotion in the boy shocking the shy young man Mycroft had been. He didn’t know what to do with him back then, and he still didn’t, not really. He was a force of nature and in many respects, still a bit of a child. So if someone injured or threatened the people he loved, he simply tore through them with a vengeance. Perhaps it was this strange relentlessness that made people like John feel so drawn to him – to a romantic mind that could seem very enthralling. Mycroft, however, thought it was volatile and dangerous.
