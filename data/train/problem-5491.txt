“Why Sam though, Cas? Why did your unconscious mind go for him?”
Sam didn’t have enough energy left to react to Dean in any way and let the words wash over him.
build houses around the world. We need a big cash injection for a new group of homes we're trying to get done in Sierra Leone. Everything is stuck at the permit stage right now.”
“You could just not do it,” Dean pointed out. He understood why Sam added so many levels of bureaucracy back to Hell. Crowley would be proud in a way at how Sam had turned things around to bring order, annual appraisals, daily agendas, and self-reflection worksheets for the demons.
“You had half a beer,” Dean intoned. “You ain’t drunk.”
“I know I’ve said it before but you really are the greatest boyfriend in the whole world.”
The press had shouted for the men to come back, but instead they chose to walk hand-in-hand into the theater.
“You have to develop a taste for it,” Dean grinned, wiping the bar down again.
“What happened with me and Jess.”
Seeing how happy Sam was in his new environment, Dean couldn't help but feel proud of his brother for stepping out of his comfort zone and doing something different with his life. No part of Dean had ever been resentful for Sam wanting to stop when he did. Dean in fact had felt a little envious at how easy Sam made living in the real world look.
The perfect tree for lovers, Castiel had thought while he’d twisted and tied the rope around Dean’s wrists earlier. The drooping branches gave them extra privacy against the outside world too – not that there was much that could interrupt them out there beyond the literal birds and bees.
“I thought you said he wasn't your boyfriend?”
Jack gave him a watery smile at the news that even an adult could over indulge like that.
“We were talking, up until the moment Dean said
“Just the cap? I can leave it by the front door.”
Dean's eyes flew open. “WHAT? That wasn't in my script!”
“M'kay.”
Dean chuckled and ruffled the boy’s hair.
“It just felt good,” Sam stuttered. It hadn’t been a big deal. A little comfort from a stranger in the night when he’d most needed it. A new friend, a new shoulder to lean on. “I forgave you for the prom date thing years ago, Dean. This had nothing to do with that.”
Getting in, Dean inserted his room card to enable the penthouse button on the elevator.
He was having a good day.
“Luck, I’m afraid,” Castiel admitted.
"I know you're good with your hands, and you're always a hard worker. I can't see why not."
“If it helps you with your decision: I am interested in having sex and yes, I am using this as an icebreaker.”
“Pineapple juice, if you have it?” Castiel asked the server. “And a short stack of pancakes.”
Castiel sighed like this was a conversation he’d had far too many times. “Star Wars. Many, many times. Indiana Jones, many, many times.”
“Because he hangs dong, Donna,” Benny butted in. “The dude
“Anything, everything.”
Castiel pulled his garment back on. It reminded Dean of a robe, but somehow the material closed up along Castiel’s front as each side seemed to turn liquid and merge, becoming one, seamless piece of fabric. Some new invention Dean hadn’t really bothered to follow, though he did vaguely recognized from the little time he spent watching TV between eating, sleeping and having sex with Cas.
With that, Anna stood up and walked out of the room.
“It would blow some hole in the universe to have so many versions of you existing all at once, it must do. I know my sci-fi, Cas.”
Sam rolled his eyes again as he noticed Dean winking at the waitress. At least that hadn’t changed about Dean in the years they’d been living apart.
“You were so well behaved. But you always are.” Castiel leaned down to kiss Dean on the top of his head. “Hello, Sam. What brings you here?”
The three of them might be separated sometimes, but in the end, all that mattered was that they always ended up back together. They were stronger together than they were apart. And as time and time again they’d proven, Heaven and Hell couldn’t keep them apart.
Castiel studied Sam’s face again. He seemed to have a thing for that, just looking and trying to find answers. “That sounds pretty risky. Plus, if I use handcuffs, I always have the key and a spare nearby. No need for lock picking.”
“Yeah well, go to Poland. Go find your man. And you can name your first born after me as a thank you.”
“They're making it an R now.”
He looked around the room, studying it a moment as Dean studied him.
Dean's jaw dropped.
“So you can stick around tonight?” Dean hoped he sounded casual enough that Castiel wouldn’t pick-up on just how damn much he’d missed him.
“Anyway, enough about me and my life, tell me about yourself?” Castiel asked, taking a delicate sip of coffee.
“I think I got a differential diagnosis for a tummy ache and bright green throw up,” Dean said with a laugh, not seeming to care that he was covered in the contents of Jack’s stomach. “Jack,” Dean asked him calmly, “did you eat the whole gummy bear already?”
“I’m busy this weekend but if you’re up for… hanging out next week sometime?”
“You'd be happy to join me? What about your theater work? What about your
“And I can give that to you now, without having to share you with strangers. So why wouldn’t I? Three hours with many versions of me, Dean.”
"Bye, kiddo who should be the same age as me and yet doesn't look a day over… 55?" she guessed.
Dean clung tighter onto Castiel.
Mary laughed at Dean’s question. “I hoped. Well, I’d seen the ring. If he wasn’t proposing to me I knew I had to dump him.”
Sam pushed his mostly still full basket over. “Here.” He wasn’t much interested in eating right then anyway.
There were more enchantments on the place than just the
“As it has been, Castiel Ten, in this case me, usually talks first. We know we have three hours to achieve our goal: get Dean fucked as many times as possible. We’ve all done this before, apart from Castiel One. You’ll soon pick up on how things go. And remember, there is just one rule: we are not to talk about anything from our times. We are here to fuck Dean, not mess up the space–time continuum.”
At last Sam climbed onto the bed to join Castiel. For the first time since they’d met Sam detected a hint of hesitance in Castiel’s look, just a moment where Castiel’s gaze dropped.
“I’m not sure I want to keep practicing law.”
“He's good,” Kevin supplied with a smile. “A true professional.”
Okay, maybe some things were a little familiar.
Sam smiled sadly at Castiel, looking weary in a way Castiel hadn’t seen since before Chuck had died.
Castiel put his thumbs in under the elastic of his boxer shorts and used them to slowly leverage the fabric down. Dean started bucking into his own fist the moment Castiel’s pubic hair first appeared over the top of the shorts. Castiel paused again upon seeing this, his own dick now hard – though he knew it could get harder.
“No, maybe? Guh, can you clone yourself so you can do this all at once? I really want you to come on my chest”
“I’m so sorry, Sam,” Castiel uttered lowly soon as Dean and Mary were out of earshot. “I should have put one and one together and realized who you were. Dean’s talked of you often and,” Castiel scrunched his face up, “I’ll tell him everything. Tell him it wasn’t your fault.”
By the end of the first day, Jody had asked if Dean and Donna wanted to go out drinking. They'd all readily agreed.
between us without being honest about this. Though I'm sorry I'm burdening you with this for the sake of my desire to spend time with you.”
Dean wiped the back of his mouth on his arm and waved at his brother.
“Have a safe flight,” Dean said almost pleadingly, placing a gentle kiss on Castiel's closed lips.
“And anyway,” Donna turned on Benny again. “The aunts died in film six. How could they do a spin-off?”
That was a plot from one of Castiel’s books. The last book, in fact. The very same one that Dean had helped Castiel pick the protagonist’s job for.
Bela rolled her eyes at his display and sat up straighter. “Whatever the case, we can't let this get to us. We're lucky we found about it when we did. So now we can start to fix things. Our intention is to shorten the post-production time as well so we can get this out two weeks before the rip-off movie. We go out looking like the heroes, they look like the lame remake.”
“So you and Sam audition, they think you're amazing, and the rest is history?”
, was what Castiel wanted to say, but it felt too mushy. It was hard not to feel himself falling even more for Dean after scenes like the one he’d just witnessed.
“Or,” Dean interjected, leaning across the bar on his elbows to put himself as close to Castiel as possible. “You could quit your job instead of doing appraisals let someone else take over Heaven.”
. And if he was an actor, I figured, how bad could it be?”
In theory, if he had gone to Heaven Sam would’ve never seen him again, and if he’d gone to Hell, Cas would never see him again. But there was a general unspoken understanding they’d find a way to make it work. Find a way to make sure they didn’t have to go without ever seeing each other at the same time ever again.
“I lived in Norway for a few weeks,” Castiel told Dean, just before he bit into a freshly baked, still warm breakfast muffin.
“Hey, I resent that,” Sam added to the conversation as he entered the bar and sat down next to Castiel. “They aren’t all dicks.”
Castiel smiled, “I’m fine,” he assured Sam. “This is good.” He ran a finger over Sam’s left pectoral.
“Not literally?” Dean had to ask.
It hadn’t even been that long in the grand scheme of things and it already pained Dean how easily they were losing touch with him. Cas at least should have had a better grasp on things; he’d had previous experience with dealing in different time-streams after all. Sam didn’t always seem to know anymore when he’d been away from Earth one day or two months.
Castiel was explaining his aftercare process when Dean suddenly let out a hiss of breath Castiel could feel his whole body twitch.
“Castiel, it has to be you,” Balthazar declared to the assembled members. Another Balthazar nodded his agreement.
“I'd like that, I'd like that a lot.”
Dean turned his head to look eye-to-eye with Castiel again. His eyes were flush with tears.
Dean had finally given up holding onto the headboard so he could hold onto Castiel’s shoulders and move against his strong fingers.
“I love you, fuck, I love you,” Dean half-sobbed. “You’re perfect.” Dean’s eyes were wide and wet.
“Tomorrow afternoon. Jess is coming by tonight to check through anything else left, she said she’d clean a bit since she took the vacuum with her to her new place, and then tomorrow she’ll sign the final paperwork. I just need to drop off the stuff for Goodwill and I’m done.”
She moaned and put her head in her hands. "Would've never had kids if I'd known they were coming after. Gracie jacked a car last week. Do you even know how hard it is to steal a car? When was the last time you'd even heard of one being stolen?"
Jody laughed. “You know she ‘liberated’ several other people from Heaven along her away who weren’t done living just yet? You boys have a lot to catch up on.” Jody looked around, hands twitching for her gun.
“I do know that. They didn't even have an ending for the film. We had to film a couple and they're basically making the whole thing up in editing.”
“I don't think we've ever been introduced. I'm Castiel, your co-star to this film.”
“Then I’m clearly not doing this well enough,” Castiel Four lamented, driving his dick in again and rotating his hips. “Humms, it’s been a few weeks since I last took you from this angle, but I think it should be...” he tilted his hips slightly and smiled happily when Dean shuddered and shivered.
Sam was sitting in a booth when Castiel returned to the bar area. Dean was passed out snoring on his bed. A bed Castiel hadn’t joined Dean in occupying for too long for Castiel to remember.
“Was it everything you wanted?”
“Listen, Sammy, we’ll get you moved back. It might feel shitty right now, but six months from now, you’re going to look back and see this was just first step to a new phase in your life.”
“Maybe?”
“Wha? Sam?” Dean blinked blearily up at his younger brother. “S’okay?”
"You’re right," Dean conceded. "We can research the children, but the world isn’t ending right now. I can’t wait to do this all over again. Actually, thinking about that, how will you know when is the right time to come back? Did the others tell you?”
“Yes?”
would know how terrible the film was bound to be.
“I mean, you don't have to. I'm sure you have plans already.”
“I booked the rooms in my name at the motel. Since I’m hauling this thing I’ll probably be behind you. See you there?”
“Hey, me too! I mean, not me too, I mean,” he rambled, and then composed himself. “My brother's at college there too at the moment. I dropped by him a few weeks ago. Never spent much time there, but it seemed cool.”
“Definitely. Something more believable then. Twelve inch cocks, St. Andrew’s Cross, and a vat of lube? Maybe someone called Dr. Sexy and his nurse, Thrusto, whose prostate is higher up than normal and requires a simply enormous dick before his itch can be scratched?”
“Bye, Bobby.”
“And I'm not going to do it because that's stupid.”
And then the script for
“Mom took some time off work to bring Sam over to my school, and to watch us audition.”
“I say it like I see it. Besides, have you always talked so much in your sleep?”
He grabbed Dean's hand and pulled the other man up so they were both standing again. They continued what they'd been doing before Dean's impromptu blow job: kissing and slowly lathering each other up with bubbles under the multiple jets of warm water the shower produced.
about but he didn't think that was what happened. “I read the script, that wasn't in the script.”
Castiel smiled sadly. “I’ll think about it.”
Flipping over and crawling towards the headboard, Dean leaned over to grab the top of the solid-wood headboard as directed.
“We weren’t going to say anything today,” Sam fought back, irritated suddenly that he was having to defend a situation that wasn’t of his own creation. “I didn’t want you knowing at all.”
It had been a surprise when Dean had dropped his job as a mechanic to pursue a career in law enforcement. Sam still remembered their mom calling him to let him know. It was during the time he and Dean had not exactly been on friendly terms. Dean had split up with his girlfriend Carmen, switched careers and… well, flourished. The drinking had stopped, the angry bitter guy Sam remembered just melted away to this new Dean.
horse porn?”
growth, haven’t yet seen something so big it scares me off. I just think of it as a challenge."
Between the deliveries and Dean’s work in Castiel’s yard, Castiel was seeing Dean almost every other day – sometimes more on days he let himself give into temptation.
“How about you, Dean?” Donna asked.
And also huge, huge thanks to the very talented
Dean had nodded, agreeing. Not realizing his dad hadn't known his pay was in part to be a percentage of box office returns on the film. He
“If the pizza man really loves the babysitter, why does he keep slapping his rear like that?”
“My roommate is pretty much the same. Harrison Ford for days, if he could.” He felt compelled to keep saying roommate. Even though he’d admitted to Castiel he was between jobs, it made him feel bad to then add ‘And sleeping in my brother’s spare room for free because I’m having a faux midlife crisis’.
He spoke so plainly Sam found himself gawping.
Sam wanted to protest, but as he moved his hips slightly he could already feel where the pressure was going to lead to an ache. He followed Castiel to the bed, tugging of his own clothes as he went.
“You taught me well.” Castiel dropped more kisses wherever he could reach on Dean. And though he wasn’t touching his own cock, it was enjoying this experience nonetheless.
“Heh, yeah. I guess.” Looking over the mountains of food still on the table, Dean picked what he wanted to have next.
Dean hadn’t even heard him come in. He wasn’t meant to just appear into the bar like that as sometimes it freaked out the visitors.
Dean read his books.
“Oh, very, very good,” Castiel chuckled with delight. With this he moved positions so he was kneeling behind Dean.
"I'd like that," Dean beamed up at Castiel. "That is some impressive bush you have there," Dean said as he stroked a hand over the surface, feeling the lush foliage of Castiel’s primroses.
“I started working there as a waiter as a gig between acting jobs. But I soon got good at the cooking. Fast forward to 25 years later and I still do a few bit parts here and there, but my main job is the restaurant. I don't ever wanna give her up now. My wife runs it by herself if I have to be away. Great lady. She looks after the kids by herself too.” Benny got his phone out to show them all photos of his beautiful children and gorgeous wife, smiling proudly as he waved the phone under all their noses.
“No hitch on my car though. Can I take yours?” Sam picked up the note of hesitance in Dean’s voice. Almost like he didn’t think Sam would say yes.
Castiel pressed his lips to the damaged skin again before licking slowly up. There was no blood at this point for him to taste, but the flesh still had a slight tang to it. He kissed the undamaged cheek quickly and stood back up again.
Dean groaned at his mom complimenting his boyfriend's cock on the sly.
“Okay, you’ve said hi to Dean, I think it is bed time now.”
Donna's cheeks turned pink. “Sorry, Dean.”
Instead, they managed last moment to get a director. Gabriel Plaisantin was welcomed on board. He was known mostly for directing commercials, but must have known some deep secrets of the studio bosses to get his first movie directing gig be film with as big of a budget as
Castiel huffed a snort of amusement. “I just seem cool to you because you're young.”
Looking through some of his old notes on cases Sam started to remember exactly why he loved the law. He loved helping people. He loved the research. He loved the process and the problem solving needed. No two cases were identical and every day had the potential to be different. Sure, he didn’t always care for all of it. Charging people, knowing some might go broke just paying for his services, that was never the best feeling. Overall though, a day with his head in the books was perhaps just what he needed.
“Me either.”
It was almost a shame Castiel felt like he was in a position of authority over Dean, or he would try harder to be friends with the younger man. They had plenty in common, especially their love of fiction books. Dean was very well read, which pleased Castiel greatly.
“Alex did. She’s getting pretty good at it. She wanted to learn so she can bribe the other hospital staff.”
“He’s a grown adult,” Castiel agreed. “More grown than most.”
Castiel later helped Dean to bed when Dean was at the point of falling over thin air and needed someone to take care of him. He’d probably needed someone to take care of him for a lot longer than they were willing to admit.
“Because I have to do
Dean held Castiel’s hand and followed him to the second floor where he spent the rest of the night proving to Dean his trust was well placed.
There, in the dim light of his upstairs hallway, back to his son’s bedroom door, Castiel had never felt closer in all ways possible to another human than he did right then.
“And I saw you when I was coming out of the restroom, you were huddled together whispering about
Castiel found Dean lounging on the couch when he returned.
At least one of them was enjoying this conversation.
“Bend over the arm of the couch please.”
of all time.
“It is,” Sam defended. “It’s helping me not think about the choices I have to make in my life.”
Dean's head flew back as he laughed heartily.
“Dean…” Sam sighed. “That’s not the point, that’s not the point at all. We’ve talked about this.” First in vague terms and then in more exacting terms as Dean’s attempts at self-destructive behavior got more daring. No, he couldn’t die while he was in the bar, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t still suffer.
“Why?” Dean laughed. “We're just going to mess this bed up in a moment anyway.”
“Nowhere in particular to be. You want to get breakfast? If that’s… not too much for a one night stand?” Sam winced as he said it. Castiel wasn’t easy too read and he didn’t want to scare the other man off.
“You say hanging out, but I'm hearing
"Think you can tame it?"
“Sure, I’ll go get it.”
Sam frowned at them both. “For real? Isn’t that a little... biblical?”
Falling down besides Dean, Castiel was fighting to get his breath back.
“Because he, I,  couldn’t have you,” Castiel put simply. It was undoubtedly more complicated than that, but Castiel didn’t have it within his mind to work through the minutia. “Because I wanted to feel a connection with someone. But wanted to be free to be with you.”
“Yes you do, you love us really,” Garth teased.
“Hell no!” Dean laughed. “Like I said, I just wanted to get out of school early. And, well,” he paused, feeling embarrassed all over again. “I had had the total hots for Harrison Ford. Though at the time I didn't realize that's what the feelings were. I just thought he was so
“Tell them what you told me,” Claire pointed the taser baton at the guy, finger over the button that turned on the electric pulse. He whimpered and tried to squirm away. The tight knots around his torso attaching him to the back of the bolted-down chair stopped any chance of that though.
Sam examined the five identical packets.
“The graphics were very convincing,” Castiel said with a coy smile.
Dean had to admit he'd wondered if he'd be welcomed.
“I love you,” Dean stated simply. “Have done for like, a long, long time. And I love your kids. And...” Dean surveyed the room around them. His gaze fond as he looked over the items of his own which had somehow migrated their way to Castiel’s bedroom. “If you're a dork, I'm a mega dork. And yeah,” Dean shrugged as if it was all that easy.
Dean thought a moment. “Ultimately? No. I got to live a life plenty of other people have dreamed about. Done a lot of cool stuff, though not as cool as you.”
Garth, a major role in the second half of the film, and an actor Dean was curious to get to know spoke up next. “Meaning what exactly? I was wondering that, the schedule says I'm to be... waxed... below?”
“They discovered that someone stole my original screenplay and now another company is making it.” Chuck explained to the others.
Castiel recounted the story for Sam this time while Dean eyed up his brother. Sam seemed to be in a tequila sort of mood. Which probably meant Dean should be serving him water, and Sam would settle for beer. He poured and mixed the final drink and presented Sam with a–
“Bitch.”
Castiel look was pained, eyes creased with well-worn kindness. “It doesn’t, but I appreciate the thought. I’m happy just being here with you. You have a good heart, Sam.”
“Theater actor. We needed someone solid. I guess he knows someone. But the stuff I saw him shoot the other week, he did look great. And because he's used to theater, he gets it right on the first take nearly every time. Saving us a lot of time, I can tell you.”
The studio tried to convince Dean to stay on, do another film by himself. Dean had considered it, but ultimately knew the fans would be disappointed. Plus, to have one brother and not the other? It would just sound like they'd have to kill off Logan and killing off one brother would have upset too many.
“Well, it was that or… you don’t want to know what Dean had planned for our session if I hadn’t distracted him with this.”
Castiel withdrew his fingers and there was a pause while he put a condom on.
“I should be getting home.”
“Shut it, Sammy.”
“Did they literally just give the editing team a bunch of drugs before they put it together?” he asked Castiel.
That shouldn’t have made Castiel’s cock twitch like it did, but he realized over the years he had less control over his body than he used to assume.
love you.” Castiel shot Dean a scathing look and went back to rearranging the cards in his hand in some order known only to himself.
“I was so confident though, in the dream world. Over how I could make others happy in that way. It’s something I… lack in the real world.”
“Do you think you deserve to be punished? Do you think you’ve been a bad boy?”
Castiel studied Sam’s plans a little longer. His quick sketch for how they could expand the space Dean had to live in.
“Huh, you cleaned,” Dean noted appreciatively when he finally rolled in that evening.
Other than Dean and a guy sat in the back of the bar, known as Dennis – who was hopefully asleep and not dead – the bar would be empty once Celia left. Just as it often was these days.
“Brunet,” Sam said begrudgingly. “How about you? Not heard about anyone since Carmen.” What was the point in being a little brother if you couldn’t annoy your older brother?
“I’m sorry I haven’t been here much for things like this,” Sam rushed to say. And he was sorry he’d felt so much like he’d left Dean to deal with the fall out of everything that was their dad dying. Even just the practicalities of sorting his bank accounts and going through his clothes had been left entirely to Dean. It had been a turning point for his brother, Sam felt. Before that Dean had been selfish and somewhat shallow. Afterwards though, he seemed to want nothing more than to connect with Sam. Sam hadn’t been interested. It had felt too much like backtracking.
Castiel looked over at the bar stools and frowned. It did seem entirely possible, given the projection of things. There were only so many objects in the bar Dean could make use of like that, and he had steadily worked his way through using the pool table balls already.
“Am I gonna get vampires in here or…?”
“Just talking about KU Jayhawks last win.”
“You know what?” Sam interrupted before his ears were made to bleed. “Dean has a point. It was a silly dream. Goodnight!”
Dean started moving his hips against Castiel’s thick, muscular thighs.
Castiel Two went next and was taking a very different approach to his predecessors and seemed determined to
“No! No, nothing like that,” Castiel said, interrupting Dean's thoughts about how disappointed his parents were going to be. “Hannah's my sister.”
Castiel had expected questions about his relationship from one of his 8-year-olds ever since he started dating Dean. This hadn’t been the line of question he’d predicted though. Valentine’s Day was throwing up all sorts of confusion it seemed, though mostly for Castiel. He just couldn’t decide what to buy Dean and was quickly running out of time to buy anything.
“You don't have an ending, do you?” Jody asked the production team bluntly.
Donna had been so calm up until this point, but apparently finding out they were starting promotion so quickly was too much for even her kind soul to take.
“You two seemed pretty good together, is all.”
“Would you fuck me?”
Jack nodded again, bottom lip quivering. “It just tasted so yummy.”
Castiel tilted his head. “I’d hoped by next time we might be out of here, if I’m being honest.”
? Does it worry you that you might be the lead actor in the biggest flop of all time?”
Dean moaned sensually. “And so much more. You have no idea how much I love you.”
“You can opt out now, or you can trust me.”
“What?” Sam frowned, turning back to face them.
an anything.”
Sam froze.
Sam blinked and looked at his glass. It was somehow empty except for the quickly melting remainders of ice.
“You made this area larger, right?” Sam asked Castiel, halfway through the tour of the dry-climate section.
We the undersigned demand to see Sam Winchester given his own chance to shine as a shirtless, horse-human-unicorn hybrid with his rock-solid man meat on show. His beautiful chestnut hair dancing in the wind as he gallops across fields...
“I don't want you to go,” he admitted, shifting on his seat delicately to get the best position for his throbbing behind.
“And you've told me all this because you felt you had to be honest with me?”
Dean nodded. He’d noticed her jeans and t-shirt, looked exactly like the kind of get-up Claire used to wear so many centuries before.
“You’re in love with him,” Sam pointed out. “And the fact that I don’t have to specify names? That’s because it applies to both of you.”
“Dean, please don’t be difficult.”
“Definitely. It will take me a while probably to get something else off the ground, but, definitely.”
Castiel sighed. “I don’t know.”
“You did that just to see me?”
The guy shook his head as much as he could. His bottom jaw was shaking in either fear or pain, Sam didn’t know. “I got told killing you was pointless and to get more creative. Come on, lady, I told you everything I know I–” he convulsed as Claire turned the baton on, sending jolts of electricity into his body.
It had taken Castiel a while to train Dean into calling him by his name instead of
“Sorry, Jody,” Dean was at least good at pretending to be shamefaced.
“Claire, thank you, thank you for finding us.”
“I would have wanted you to be happy, Cas. I
“He’d have been proud of the man you are now, Dean,” Sam reassured him.
need anyone but me.”
Castiel sighed when he saw how quickly Dean closed his laptop.
Dean was soon lost in the sensations and couldn’t track which Cas was where and how many of them had cum in him.
The film is too long, too self-indulgent, and relies too heavily on CGI that is, upon contemplation, likely to get it at least an Oscar nomination for special effects.
“They’re amazing kids, you did real well raising them.”
He was so eager, so warm, so gentle, soft, just… everything Castiel had been thinking about lately.
as the guy naturally had when he’d first started working for Castiel. But it was effort well rewarded for his name never sounded better than when it came from Dean's lips.
Except, it wasn't a magic trick. Becky was well known for bribing people in these situations. How she'd got to Bela, Dean couldn't guess, but he knew it wasn't a coincidence.
Castiel didn’t let out a breath of relief, but it was a close thing.
“Three fingers from my right hand,” Castiel said, wiggling those slightly. “And now two from my left. You, Dean, are a very good boy.”
“Friends without benefits situation?” Castiel proposed.
and the idea that Dean could mess it all up because he was bored worried Sam deeply.
“We're mostly going to be responsible for the centauricorns, that's our specialism,” Charlie explained to Dean. “Other effects will go to other companies to deal with, depending on their specialty.”
“We have a lot going on,” Sam defended.
“Oh,” Dean said with some surprise. Sam could understand why. They hadn’t exactly had a real heart-to-heart in… in, well, probably ever.
Jack cradled the giant gummy to his chest like a baby.
“It is one pound of gummy,” Dean informed the younger twin.
Sam received no reply as he slipped out of the house.
“I know,” they all replied.
Dean was naked, as per the scene in the book he’d been referencing. He insisted it was the only way for him to really understand the characters’ motivations. Equally, Castiel was still dressed, but had rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt to his elbow, just like the pizza guy in the book. Dean was prone over Castiel’s lap, face down, both of them sat on Castiel’s couch for maximum softness. Castiel had considered suggesting they move to his bedroom, but it felt like that was maybe taking things a step further than Dean could be ready for.
“I suspected as much. I know you better than you think.”
“I could share my system with you if you want? We could try the food at that new place up town."
He tried not to feel like this was a sign of the encroaching computer supremacy the films of his childhood had promised.
“Did you know he was going to propose?”
Dean reached a hand out to touch the mirror, certain it had to be lying.
“Exactly!” Dean chuckled. “Though after that, they only ever left us with bowls of fruit. We did soon figure out we could um – well, you don't want to hear this.” Dean was blushing as Castiel stood there, finally in the flesh and bone before him.
Castiel groaned again. “Oh fuck.” His cock twitched even though this time Dean wasn't touching it at all. “That would be... yes. If you're sure? We have been drinking.” He suddenly sounded worried and looked down at Dean who was still knelt in front of him.
“Cherry, also pecan.”
Castiel’s eyes flicked over to Sam. “Yes, but with your brother in town wouldn’t you rather–”
“Why did they hook us up together like that?”
“Nooo,” Dean whined. “No, just like it when you’re doing it for me, me alone. When I know after there will be cuddling.”
, Dean's mind supplied.
It was probably as close to a vacation as they were likely to get though.
“Are you asking me on a date, Cas?” Dean smirked.
First day of what was meant to be reshoots, they'd been given a bunch of new pages to learn.
Castiel’s “I love you,” slipped out in response. They were both only half dressed with sleep in their eyes and hair all a mess from going to sleep with still-wet hair. The kids were shouting and laughing in the distance. A used condom from the night before was clinging to the rim of the bin in the corner.
“Problem is you don’t,” Castiel pointed out flippantly.
“But I worked so hard to get where I am.”
“Wazza time?” he asked through a yawn.
,” Sam grunted.
Sam shrugged. “Thought mom deserved as much.”
“So long as you understand perfectly that I am, for lack of a better term, stupidly in love with my best friend and have no room in my heart to love another?”
It all sounded so great he signed a contract a week later.
“Because I've been wanting to kiss you all day, since after the press conference, and knew I couldn't without revealing all this. But more than that, because after I'd been talking with you, I realized I wanted to get to know you beyond kissing, Dean. And I couldn't enter into anything knowing I was lying to you.”
Don't be surprised if the sequel is announced soon.
“No one else, Mr. Cas. Just you. Your voice, your hands, your… you’re everything.”
Castiel forehead creased. “Tartan paint? How would that even work?”
“Nothing. Dumb videos.”
“You’re building a room onto Dean’s bar for he and I to have sex?” Castiel peered intensely at Sam, mildly amused that after so many centuries Sam could still be made ever so slightly uncomfortable at the topic of his brother’s sex life.
Dean sat back and licked his lips. “In the dream world I was still thinking about kissing you way too much. Even if none of it was real,” Dean scratched the back of his neck, looking flush in the face. He swallowed and tried again. “Even if it wasn’t real, Cas, I still wanted you to be with me. And I don’t just mean for sex, I mean… everything.”
“You can go through to the dining room now. Food’s about done. Can I get you boys anything to drink?”
“Is that why you're so flexible?” Castiel had an appreciative look on his face.
Sam gather from the smirk on Castiel’s face he was missing some joke. With a half-hearted laugh Sam picked up his phone. It was hard to feel rude when Castiel had been half paying attention to his emails since they’d sat down.
Having a pediatrician as a boyfriend was the greatest, Castiel thought to himself. It allowed Castiel to feel calm too, in a way he never had before he’d had Dean around.
“Do you have to always use that phrase?”
“Castiel?”
“Gotta have something to do all day while I wait for you two to finish work.”
“Cool.” Dean nodded and went back to his burger.
“So your argument is he won’t try and upset anything out of a sense of duty?” Castiel didn’t sound convinced. “That might work if we weren’t talking about
definitely over reacting.
“Heartbreak? Indecision?” The overwhelming feeling that he’d fucked up his life and was too terrified to start again?
“Goodbye, Castiel Ten.” Dean stood to kiss him on the cheek, aware of the cum dribbling down his thighs.
“Neither of us are here very much any longer, let’s be real.”
Dean chuckled quietly, “Of course you are, old man, I ain't missing out on an excuse to see you in a monkey suit. I've got someone going to the airport to pick you, mom, and dad up in a few hours.”
“Having you long for something I could willingly provide and yet
Castiel chuckled, amused how turned on Dean still was.
“Should I be worried?”
When he finally forced himself to get out of bed it was if he’d contracted flu overnight. Everything hurt and his brain was fogged over. Sunlight beamed in through the flimsy curtains of Dean’s spare room by the time Sam convinced himself to leave the bedroom. Water, he hoped, would at least make him feel somewhat human again. He grabbed a chilled bottle from the fridge and downed half of it with the refrigerator door still open.
“How’s your hole feeling?” Castiel had to know. His cock needed to know.
“Where are you even reading this?” It was way too early in the morning and he was way too hungover to be dealing with this.
“What are you stuck on?”
“So you're not interested in doing more film work?” Dean had to ask, wanting to know everything he could about this man.
Dean was taken aback at the quick change in conversation.
Bobby hung up.
“I slept with your brother earlier this week. We met in a bar, I didn’t know he was your brother until today. That came as something of a surprise, I confess. He introduced himself as Sam and I didn't think to wonder if it could be your brother, Sam. The idea never even crossed my mind, especially as I thought he was living in San Francisco still.”
“Dean said once we should just quit,” Sam remembered.
“It’s annual appraisals next week.” Sam’s shoulders slumped.
“There’s still a bit left,” he winced. In light of how sickly Jack looked Castiel couldn’t bring himself to tell the young boy off. Well, not until morning anyway.
Castiel told them all the basic outline and how he had a company in Poland ready to perform the play, that he'd even
Dean stuck his tongue out in automatic childish retaliation, not thinking about how Sam couldn't see him do so.
John shrugged, “Good enough for me.”
“Oh... um,” Castiel again averted his eyes to anywhere but Dean. “They actually haven't yet.”
“You’re home early,” Sam tried. “Good shift?”
"You would never be invading my space, Dean," Cas laughed, stepping back to welcome Dean into the entrance hall. "Shall we discuss what I'd like to do in the garden?"
“I wasn't pregnant! What are you on about, mom?”
“Dad’s birthday…?”
Castiel smiled and took another sip of his coffee.
They were all dressed identically. The only slight difference between any of them was how ruffled their hair looked.
Sam still had a big decision to make on his future, but for the first time since he and Jess called it quits, he didn’t feel entirely alone in the world.
“Good,” Dean settled on, cocking an eyebrow. “Because I do too, love you, am in love with you, I mean. So...” his voice wavered a little, fear, excitement,
Arms laden down with bags, Sam kicked at the front door hoping to get Dean’s attention. If he had to put down even one bag just to get out his keys and let himself in, everything was going to come cascading down.
“Tough day?”
“Who's that?” a groggy voice spoke up, muffled by the pillow.
“For what?” Castiel looked confused.
When the door was finally opened Sam was lucky he didn’t drop everything anyway.
“You must be a very naughty boy, Dean,” Castiel hissed.
“Professional cat burglars make good money I hear.”
now?”
“That’s like, ahhh yes,” Dean squirmed, “like, 2 cents at the most.”
Upon hearing this, Dean quickly flicked through to his schedule notes and let out a breath of relief when he found out he wasn't also scheduled to be waxed.
, he told himself firmly. He had a new novel due with his editor by the end of the week and still had half the porn scenes to write. He liked saving them until last though, when all the boring plotty elements were done and dusted.
“Wow, just wow.”
“And also: stop mentioning my brother when you’re inside me.”
“I, um, I, thanks?” he babbled, pulling the shirt all the way back down.
Maybe it was.
Dean rolled his eyes at Sam. He was at least eating the peanuts by the handful now.
“Nnnnggghhh,” Dean ground out. “That's not the point.”
“You’re exquisite,” Castiel murmured against Dean’s skin as he kissed up his neck. “A new surprise around every corner.”
“Those what?” Castiel reprimanded gently.
“No problem, Cas. Kinda my job as number one bad-ass hunter.”
Dean and Sam had thought the merchandise room was lame as kids, embarrassing, but their parents had always insisted they'd be glad to have it in the future.
Dean chuckled. “Never thought I’d hear you call Kansas home again.”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
“Perhaps,” Castiel admitted. “But we’ve warded it up so well that even if they were, they shouldn’t be able to do any harm.
A couple of hours (and several orgasms) later, they were cuddled up on their bed. Dean always insisted there wasn’t a big spoon and little spoon in their cuddling arrangement. No, they were jet-pack and pilot. Castiel was fond of this arrangement as it afforded him the opportunity to expand some of the protective energy he always felt over Dean. When he was holding Dean in his arms in bed, snuggled up as they were, it always felt a bit like he could keep Dean safe forever.
The morning of Castiel's flight, Dean had woken up a few hours before Castiel just so he could enjoy and memorize the sensation of being held by the older man.
Both brothers watched the TV silently after that, pretending like they weren’t both thinking of their dad.
“That’s for you and Dean to help with his… other urges.”
Dean shrugged. “Even if I don’t, what’s gonna happen? I can’t die,” he chuckled. “So long as I stay in here, it doesn’t matter.”
Castiel ran his thumbs against the tips of his fingers, remembering briefly the feel of Dean’s skin as he’d helped him to bed.
Dean snuggled back under his blanket and shut his eyes, leaving Sam fidgeting in the dark room.
Castiel frowned but accepted this for truth.
“I’m Castiel, and yes, that is my real name.” Castiel called the bartender over and ordered them both tonic waters with lime.
not! You're not Cher!) broke with fans flocking to see the film that they supposedly fell in love during the shooting of.
“I think one was a gift, one must have been Jessica’s–”
“Dean!” Shouted a familiar voice.
The way Castiel looked into his eyes though, the way he kissed and held Dean, that never failed to briefly make him forget his ever advancing years. It always made him forget he wasn’t still in his prime. He felt loved, cherished, and
. Isn’t that against every moral code going?”
“Yeah... yeah,” Dean said, as it dawned on him how right Castiel was.
Sam could only guess at what both the other men before him were thinking. This whole situation had clearly been years in the making from what Castiel had told him.
“Well if you do that, you'll be topless. You should keep it, looks better on you anyway.”
It was with some surprise that when Castiel opened the door to take receipt of his pizza he realized he knew the delivery driver.
The table now covered in empty plates and crumbs, Dean wondered what they should do next.
“You're young, rich, and have your health. You've got plenty of options.”
Sam saw the pride and fear in Jody’s eyes as she said this. Claire was growing up, was grown up. It was hard in Sam’s head –and he knew Dean’s too – to consider Claire out there doing what she did. But they’d been in the same position at her age.
They both thought on this a moment.
Castiel pulled a length of willow off the tree and swished it around in the air. He could see the muscles in Dean’s back tense when he heard the sound. Under the hood Dean was now wearing, Castiel was sure Dean was probably grinning with happiness and anticipation of the willow.
Castiel thought a moment and then slowly shook his head no.
Castiel studied Sam’s work intently.
“I shine these glasses probably hundreds of times every week. There are grooves in the floors from where I’ve been walking back and forth for hundreds of years now. I need something.”
“Oh, hell no.”
“You are not meant to talk about anything outside of the sex act, Castiel Ten,” Castiel One reminded him sharply.
“Ew, Jody!”
Sam rolled his eyes and went back to packing. He was nearly done now. Jess had made it easier on him by already taking her stuff while he’d been away. While he’d been hiding at the office under the cover that he’d needed to tie up loose ends on all his cases.
“Oh, hey,” Castiel was groggy and his bedhead so adorable Dean wanted to play with the wild strands of hair.
Finding suitable replacements to takeover had been, unfortunately, where their plan had stalled.
“I need a character that can be places and have a reason another person would want to invite them into their home without much of a set up.”
“Probably because I've spent most of my life around adults. Sam, if I'm honest about it, was really my only friend growing up who wasn't over 18.”
Dean ran a bar in downtown Chicago and hadn’t been outside in over 200 years. This bar, with its wooden floors, seedy beer smell and dark-green furnishings, this was his afterlife.
A smile broke out on Castiel’s face without him realizing it. “Oh.”
“I think that’s…” Castiel got up and walked over to the bottom of the stairs. “Jack?” he called out gently to his son.
“Coffee?” Dean offered.
"Nope, don't look like it, Celi’. How's the grandkids?" He knew he could always distract her by asking about the grandkids.
“And, just a quick follow-up question: How is Sam?”
Dread at the thought of dealing with the press with his current hangover. Nausea, well, also because of the hangover.
It was only a bottle of apple cider, but it was a bottle made on an orchard Castiel used to visit as a child with his family. He hadn’t been able to go back in years and vaguely remembered telling Dean just once how much he’d missed the taste. Being a single parent was amazing, and he wouldn’t give it up for the world, but it hadn’t left much room in life for traveling like he did in his own childhood.
“You going to tell me maybe it isn’t about where we end the story? Maybe we make it about where we began, so long as it’s together?”
Sam noticed Dean watching a couple make out near the pool table. Their waitress seemed unworried about it and squeezed past them en route to delivering their food.
He felt the mattress dip a little under him as Castiel got on the bed too. He crawled up towards Dean and then proceeded to simply stroke Dean's back in a soft, soothing motion that sent shivers up Dean's spine.
“You’re playing cards?” Sam squinted at them.
“‘Cause you were head over heels for that girl.”
“G’night. Remember that mom and I are only thin doors away, won’t you?”
Dean patted his tummy, “Gotta say, I agree.”
Sam joined in with the laughter of the others. Feeling very content to be around his family, and also sick that he’d probably ruined a happy future for them all before they’d even had their entrees.
Sam winced. “We’re pretty fucked up, aren’t we?” They couldn’t dream of a perfect world properly.
They sat in companionable silence and waited for Dean to come out of his back office. When he finally did, his pupils were pinpoints and he was walking with a hefty limp.
He'd be lying if he said that was the first night he'd spent drifting off while contemplating what life after the bar would be like. Wondering about the consequences of selling up and leaving, or just… leaving. Drop it all. Stop caring about inventory and bills, go back to his pre-having to care about tax life.
“This, this has to be the best pizza yet,” Castiel let Dean know appreciatively. Something about the evening just made every sensation, every taste, every cheesy bite that much better than any he’d had before.
Jack nodded.
"Thanks, Mr. Cas. What day do you want me to come?"
“Er, I’m not sure it should is more than a one-time thing? You seem like a great guy though.”
The future was a big, nihilistic unknown, but the present? The present was being warm, sated and happy together.
There was a whistling sound.
“I said traditional. I feel we’re… maybe beyond that?”
“You should be reunited with your co-stars next month when we start press though,” she finished.
“Bela's not so bad,” Donna chirped. “She's probably just under a lot of stress.”
He gave Dean a soda and they sat on the couch together, both picking up a slice.
“Lead the way.”
Dean finger-gunned his approval at Castiel with a wink. "Exactly."
“Shouldn't we dry off?”
“Dean,” he whispered so loudly he might as well have just spoken at his normal volume.
Castiel cringed.
“Does it matter, Sam? What’s the point of having two powerful entities in the family if you can’t even get a garden that goes on forever? I call it
goes against every moral code I have going. Especially when the means for it are well within our grasp. And besides, the relic only brings people back for three hours before they snap back to the time they’d been in previously. No one is going to get stuck here, it'll be safe.”
“What’s up?” Dean asked with a pant. Castiel had stiffened and pulled away.
“Hey, Dean. How are you doing?”
There was a sound of a zipper as Castiel Four moved into position behind Dean.
The couch was comfortable and safe. The couch didn’t expect Sam to figure out his life. The couch did hurt his back a little, but that might have had more to do with the three hours he’d spent in the same prone position.
Castiel’s head whipped around back to Dean, a frown on his face. “Quit? Why would I quit?”
No matter the universe though, they’d only ever known Castiel to be an effective member of the angel society. Whether for better or worse, he’d apparently always known how to get things dealt with.
“Best. Film. Ever,” Donna sighed happily.
boy. Whole film got re-written to be about brothers, and Sam and I got picked.”
There was a pause as Castiel pumped out even more lube.
“Er,” Castiel watched Dean retie his left shoe for a sixth time. “No reason?”
“That must be a useful skill.”
Castiel looked up at Dean and then took his hand, rising gracefully from his seat.
“Hush, Dean. Or I will gag you.”
“That?” Dean cocked an eyebrow. Even with Dean’s experience of magical items, it was hard to believe something so simplistic could really have so much power. He leaned in closer and went to pick it up. “Looks pretty inno–”
The event started with a 12 second teaser trailer for the film. From what Dean could work out, it was mostly scenes with him, Donna and Jody, running around a forest. At the very end was a vague silhouette of a centauricorn, disguised with mist.
"The safety equipment is on the workbench at the back, be sure you use it."
Castiel put the rest back in his bag and turned round to find Sam kneeling on the floor in front of him. Sam took the opportunity to fist Castiel’s cock, preparing it for the condom. Sam tried to work fast but with a confident manner, very self-conscious of how long it had been since he’d last been the one putting the condom on another person.
Dean was contemplating eating one more pastry when he realized they were actually all out.
“We can't prove it was stolen, unfortunately. So we're stuck with the re-writes,” Bela added.
“We have to tell him, Sam.” Castiel’s voice was steady.
Castiel nodded. He took a sip of his drink and pulled a face. “It tastes like bubbles.”
"Golden. Didn't even chip."
“Helping me, when Metadouche – er, I mean, Malcom, was being an ass. That guy's had it in for me since I was twelve and I threw up on his shoes. They'd put me and Sam in a room full of candy and had just expected us to leave it alone. We were there all day doing press for our first film, and... well, children, no self control,” Dean shrugged.
“We'll prepare you for that as well, don't you fear! Given some of the, ahem, rumors that have been spreading about this production, we wanted to cap off filming with a press conference, just to assure everyone things are fine.”
“What was that like?” Dean, who had only ever gotten to travel to foreign lands for filming or press, couldn't get enough of Castiel's stories.
“As fun and sexy as this would be,” Castiel interrupted, with Sam’s lips just inches from Castiel’s dick. “I’m thinking we just go to the bed? This floor show, no matter how amazing, is going to hurt your knees.”
“And being with you, Dean, don't you see? That's the real adventure.”
Sam squinted at Dean, mind running over their past cases. “You mean the djin back in Illinois?”
“Who would want you out of the way badly enough to set all this up?” Eileen interrupted.
“Oh, God. Now it makes sense why they hired a director who'd only done commercials before! They wanted him to do everything thirty times out of nervousness. And poor Kevin Tran, his writing career is going to be over.”
“Out of the way? They didn’t want us dead?”
“Cosmopolitan? I didn’t know I was one of the Sex and the City girls now, Dean,” Sam commented, but still picked up the glass and took a sip. “Taken you a few hundred years, but you do know how to mix a good drink.”
“Why don't you think about something else? You could go to college too if you wanted.”
His time with Dean always felt so natural and Castiel dearly hoped Dean enjoyed the companionship as much as he did himself. If Dean had to work so many odd jobs to support himself through college, Castiel hoped he could at least get a little pleasure out of the time they spent together.
“Are you nervous?” Castiel asked, observing Dean as he tied and retied his shoes.
It was almost a shame. Castiel had some nice crops in there he practiced with often for writing purposes.
Castiel Six was quiet after this.
The baton was something Sam recognized as normally being used in electrostim play, but he wasn’t going to bring that up right now. Claire seemed pretty relaxed with it in her hand.
Dean's face started to hurt fairly quickly that evening as he slipped into a suit and his familiar press-friendly smile to walk the red carpet.
“Be quiet,” Castiel commanded, bringing his hand down harder, and harder, and harder, until Dean’s right buttock was about the colour of a cherry while the left remained untouched, unspoiled. The heat radiating from the right one enough for Castiel to feel as he knelt down and placed a gentle kiss to the right cheek.
“She’s fostered kids for years though. Most recent two, Alex and Claire,” Dean chuckled. “They’re wild things, but damn, they’re great kids. Alex isn’t really a kid anymore, I suppose. Claire’s going to be 18 soon.”
Castiel finished the rest of his coffee and made a move to put their dishes in the dishwasher when Dean came back through the door.
“I understand.”
“I've had so many offers since it was publicly released in the US.” Dean felt a little guilty he hadn't told Castiel this yet.
“You deserve to be happy too, Sam. I know your work stresses you out. And yes, we’re both too busy often to be bored in the same way Dean is, but that doesn’t discredit our own mental health.”
“You’ve behaved so well so far, Dean,” Castiel whispered into Dean’s ear. “I’m so proud of you.”
Dean shrugged halfheartedly.
“I love Dean, Sam.”
“Do you guys strip for this or?”
“Okay,” he whispered.
After they’d all cum in his mouth they started fucking him again. Castiel Two and Castiel Eight took an opportunity to fuck Dean at the same time. Dean was barely ejaculating anymore, already too rinsed out of seminal fluid. His cock didn’t mind the attention they continued to lavish on him. His nipples were well sucked and bitten too.
Half the issues they'd had came from the fact they had to keep it a PG-13, and now he was finding out that wasn't even the case any more.
“Alive?” she finished for him.
“You’re right. This isn’t just about Dean, it is you and me too. And it’s about time we remember that.”
“I’ve been coming here for fifteen years nearly and you don’t seem to have aged a day, Dean Winchester.”
“It means
It was interesting hearing his mom’s side of things, Sam thought. It wasn’t how he would have described their dad. Especially not towards the end.
This was enough to push Dean over his limit and he came for the first time rutting against the couch beneath him.
No Castiel would fault Dean if his cock-sucking lips and tongue were not as attentive as they normally were, after all Dean had never had his attention split like this.
“And then after that, they banned water pistols and eggs from the garage.”
.” Dean wasn't sure what it
Castiel, it turned out, was fascinating.
, felt
grateful that you could be here today to join us in talking about our upcoming movie,
He sucked Castiel off slowly and languidly, relishing in the feel of Castiel coming in his mouth. He knew it wasn't good safe sex practices, but in that moment, he couldn't have cared less – he just needed to taste and know Castiel fully.
Sam reached out a hand and placed it on Castiel’s shoulder, using it to gently tug him closer.
Sam rolled his eyes. “A classic sign of how bad gas consumption used to be, maybe.”
“We should go somewhere more private,” Castiel suggested while he rotated his hips into Dean’s. Pelvis to pelvis, almost nose to nose. Everyone but them was out for now, but neither knew how long that would last. As long as saving the world took, in theory.
“We hadn’t even met Cas by then,” Sam reasoned.
Dean turned to Castiel. “Do you have a thermometer?”
“Sure? Though, friendship seems a pretty good benefit to me.”
Dean would have replied but he was too busy mouthing the cock that had appeared in front of him. He nuzzled good, rubbing it up against his cheek and around his lips – his favorite lipstick for sure.
for the wedding all this time. “Wait, you think that’s why she left me?”
Everything going well, several future versions of Castiel should appear in the bunker at 1pm. Castiel and Dean had spoken about the possible eventuality that no one would appear, in the event that they never did manage to get control enough over the time device to make it to this exact spot at the right time. Deep down though, Dean knew future Castiels would appear, he just had a sense that they wouldn’t let themselves fail at something they both wanted so much.
“Um,” Dean’s mouth felt suddenly dry. It was one thing to imagine this and quite another to see it in person. “Hi Cas...es?” he grinned and looked around at all of them. They’d congregated themselves into a circle around him while he sat on the library couch.
“Dean's right, Donna. And besides, if we're lucky they might never finish the film. I heard they still have to get a lead for the horsies.”
“Seriously?” Sam was tired and he knew his emotions were close to the surface. For weeks he hadn’t wanted to talk about it, spent so long trying to skirt around the exact whys of the situation with their mom. Now he felt annoyed Dean didn’t want to talk about it.
“She figured out you know her and Kaia are a couple yet?”
Dean huffed and spread his arms out so he could hold onto the headboard. “Better?”
“Who knows what might have happened with Jess long term, Sam,” Dean sighed. “Maybe it wouldn’t have worked out. But you loved her when you were with her, right?”
Dean clamped up immediately, posture going stiff. “Nothin’ to talk about. How about that?”
?” the three actors chimed in as one.
“You better have,” he grumbled affectionately.
Dean had been a most patient teacher when it came to teaching Castiel the fine art of finger fucking. Castiel, in return, had become a most excellent pupil, learning so well Dean was reluctant to go long without bottoming for Castiel.
There was a warmth in his chest that he’d been missing in recent years as he thought of Jess. He wasn’t ever going to say he was thankful to the monsters that set this all up – they easily could have died while the world around them were destroyed – but he did feel something like closure. The other world showed Sam that even if he and Jess had made it, nothing would have guaranteed they would have been happy forever, nothing would have promised that–
Castiel sat down carefully next to Dean. “If it helps, it showed me something important. Showed me that there is a big difference between the positive feelings I have for you both.”
“Castiel, if you really think he feels for you the way you hope he does, he’s not going to take this well.”
“...True,” Sam agreed.
Silently Sam agreed, even the top of the door frames had clearly been cleaned not too long ago. He wasn’t going to boost Dean’s ego like that though.
It took a few moments for Castiel’s brain to kick into gear. He took the box from Dean’s hands.
“Have you reached the end of the book yet?”
Dean suspected it wasn’t all day. He suspected time worked differently here, in his bar, than in the rest of existence. Once he’d tried to breach the idea with Sam and Castiel, who both quickly changed the topic.
“Is this okay?” Castiel Five breathed into Dean’s ear, quiet and oh so very earnest. “Is this everything you wanted?”
Sam drew breath in, though what was he going to say? Dean had to have a clean license for his current job, unless he’d been lying to them about that in which case–
“A potato gun! Awesome!”
“I don’t work with these goobers,” Charlie was quick to add.
He grunted as he stood and got out of Dean’s bed. A glass of water was needed. Something was needed at least to distract him from the uneasy feeling. Rubbing at his eyes, he’d taken two steps into the kitchen when he spotted Dean and Cas sitting at Dean’s kitchen table.
Sam looked around the empty bar, looked over to the door he knew Dean was currently sleeping behind, processing everything he’d ever learned, everything he’d ever experienced in that moment.
When Sam didn’t move quickly enough, Dean sat down on his feet. Sam yelped and then finally shifted his feet away. Blood rushed from his head as he finally sat up.
Castiel seemed to be looking into Dean's very soul from the focus he was giving him.
“Oh... does it, does it worry you?” Now Dean was the one feeling paranoid.
Dean fell asleep that night, wrapped warmly and safely in Castiel’s arms. Castiel had been very happy with Dean’s suggestion of cuddling. And when they were feeling more healed they agreed they would discuss moving onto
“I sent a message to ask if you wanted to get lunch, but I was told you were at home today. Hannah said she hadn’t seen you in a while? I wanted to go over the soul numbers for the next quarter.”
“You just need to what? Keep things going for a few more years? It’s been long enough, Sam. You should let go, spend more time with us, here.”
“It wasn’t hard, I just called them and ordered it. I didn’t think you’d want to drink tonight so,” Dean shrugged. “Not that you have to open it tonight, enjoy it whenever you like” he rambled on.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah.” Dean rolled his eyes but Sam could see the satisfaction in his eyes.
“Breakfast?” Dean suggested.
“What?” Dean frowned. “Uh, since never? There’s only  room for one fuck up in this family and that’s clearly me, so stop trying to steal my sunshine.”
“Six out of the ten of us so far, honey,” a Castiel told him softly as he pulled out, cock spent and moist. “How much cum is in here?” He ran his thumb around the stretched out hole, enjoying the wonderful softness.
“I would have liked to have met him,” Castiel interjected kindly.
“I wondered how long it’d take you to work out I’m always naked first.” Dean turned his head to direct Castiel’s hot, wet kisses to where he wanted them next.
“You don’t have to come back, you know.”
“Hi! I didn't know we were allowed to interrupt this private meeting,” Donna giggled as she dropped into the last remaining seat at the booth, right next to Dean. “You two have had your heads firmly together since we got here though. Time to share!” She giggled some more.
” Sam stressed, growing a little bored of this conversation already. It wasn’t like it was an issue Dean had raised with Castiel directly.
“DEAN!” Jack shouted when he opened the door.
Sam wanted to ask ‘so what’, but didn’t dare. There was no other way, no hope, no choice but to keep going as they had. Eternity was a long time, sure, but things were okay, things were
under all that.” She tapped her hand to Dean’s payment terminal by way of tipping him. “I’ll let you lovers enjoy yourself. Thanks for the beer. I’m not sure it is for me, to be honest.”
He became distracted around 3am by Dean’s hips, the curves he had, and so he settled in to watch Dean’s chest move gently as he slept. His phone vibrated on the bedside table drawing his eyes away though. It was Sam, checking to see if he was awake.
“Nice,” Dean beamed at Claire, wincing a little as the stretch of his lips made him aware of how dried and cracked they were.
“...Yes?”
“Interview either went really well, or really bad.”
There was always a moment in every one of their films when one of them would be in peril and the other brother would cry over them. The fact they were brothers in reality seemed to give the situation an added depth of emotion. It was sort of their trademark in the films.
“That’s… that’s true,” Castiel gasped slightly. “I don’t think the other me enjoyed all the one-time-only sex.”
It was a sign of the times that Dean could even sleep that deeply these days. Something Sam put down to the rather unpredicted influence of Cas and Dean sharing a bed every night.
“So the theater scene?” Dean prompted, wanting to get to the end of Castiel's story.
“I'm shooting a few episodes for a TV show up in Vancouver,” Donna started. “My agent said it was best to get in and try and establish myself better before this film, you know, drops,” she finished with a sad sniffle.
Castiel thanked him and handed over the tan trench coat.
The pizza went uneaten in the end, left cold and still in its box on his kitchen counter. Castiel’s hunger, he'd soon concluded, hadn’t been a desire for food after all.
. Odd name, Dean thought, wondering what she might be like.
the chief douchebag from
“He would have liked you too, Cas,” Dean assured him. “Weird, dorky, little guy he could tease?”
“Just okay?”
“Because you’re a fool for expensive packa-- oh. Oh fuck.” Dean’s toes curled. “Is that warming? Or cooling?”
The man still sat down.
“Some of the guys from the precinct are getting together tonight for dinner. You’ve got an invite if you want to tag along.”
“Because I have meetings.”
This time they did dry off. Dean lent Castiel a clean shirt and he shucked on the jeans they'd discarded on their way to the shower the night before. He didn't have anything on under his jeans, but Castiel was usually content like that anyway.
“Yes,” Castiel agreed. “And I’d like to practice with you, but, um, for real?”
“I’m not a big drinker,” Sam smiled apologetically.
"How about Thursday still, but a couple of hours earlier than normal, if you can squeeze me in? I know things can be a little tight with you sometimes."
“There's people to help in Canada as well. My life doesn't have to go on pause just because we spend a few months of the year in Canada.
“And this Castiel? No one knows who he is! We were meant to have one big named actor in this film, instead we have Jess Jones over here,” he said pointing towards Dean, “and some theater actor guy who isn't even on IMDB! His resume lists his only on-screen work as a commercial for yaks' milk in
“I dunno about this. If they can generate us from any angle, what's to stop you from using that to create entirely new scenes?” Jody asked.
They were all beyond caring at this point.
“I think Dean would like a car book,” Jack told his father after much consideration.
“Who usually starts things?” present-day Castiel asked.
“How about something stronger?” Donna suggested. “There's a bottle of vodka in that cupboard. I think we could all use a shot or two before we have to head back to finish filming ending number... whatever number we're on.”
“Is it working?” Sam asked Castiel hopefully. It should be weird to him that he’d seen his own brother involved in such a scene, but all his years in Hell, all his years alive had desensitized him to most things it seemed.
“Does it matter why?” Castiel pressed, voice still eerily calm. “Why does it matter who the hell I sleep with?” It was a challenge, clearly.
“I…” He studied the stranger. He looked like he might be a little older than Sam was himself, dressed in a tan trench coat and three piece suit.
“I’m good,” he smiled shyly. “Just… a little overwhelmed? It’s been a while since I was with anyone else.”
Before too long Castiel was packing up his stuff again. The hotel had kindly laundered all his clothes so he was ready to go.
“Oh! The other actor Dean's been traveling with.”
And yet the man had still sat down next to him.
“How were you pregnant at the end?” Mary pondered.
“I’m listening.”
“Is Hannah pissed the film won't be the massive disaster they were hoping for?”
He felt at peace the moment Jody embraced him as he walked in the door of her home. She didn’t know who he was, never met him before, but still hugged him like they were old friends. The others waved and Dean gave a run through of who was whom.
“I really don’t want to hear about you and Sam having sex,” Dean was quick to interject.
This was their first Valentine’s Day as a couple. They’d been dating almost a year, definitely long enough that he wanted to buy Dean something more meaningful than a generic box of chocolates and a teddy bear. He was also cooking dinner for Dean to make up for the fact they couldn’t eat out since Castiel hadn’t been able to get a babysitter in time.
“But you dreamt you did?”
Benny dropped down on the bench next to Castiel and placed his beer on the table. “What's up?”
“You’re going to get pounded by two of us later,one back here, another in your mouth, everyone else stroking your skin. It’s the closest experience to heaven on earth that I’ve ever had.”
“Cas?” Dean moved so he was sitting a little closer to Castiel who now looked like he was in some level of pain.
“Jerk.”
“Didn’t know we were in a rush.” Sam’s fingers played with the hair of Castiel’s neck. So short, so different to Jess.
“I’ve waited so long to be the one in this position,” Castiel Ten sighed, happily thrusting his hips into Dean’s mouth.
Castiel Four stood behind Dean and ran his fingers up Dean’s spine.
“YAY!”
The workbench that was just the perfect height for bending someone over and going to town, Castiel realized all at once. He shook his head to rid himself of the thought.
Sam agreed with him. “I woke up one day and everything just felt off. Like it wasn’t my life and my skin itched because nothing seemed to fit right. San Francisco's been great and all but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life there.”
“Soon,” Sam frowned. “I just need–”
“Well, yeah. Was I not supposed to?”
In the end he text him and tried not to pity himself too much when Castiel replied to say he was busy. He suggested the following Sunday though, if Sam was free. That made Sam feel slightly better.
“Er, no?” Dean admitted, swiveling around so he could sit with his legs off the bed. He stood up, feeling a thirst and spotting a jug of water on the other side of the room. A few steps in he realized something was missing.
“Dean, it was all a drugged-up dream.”
gross.”
“You were rubbing your stomach a lot, and it did look rounded,” Sam snickered.
“Mom was horrified. Sam thanked me, and I stood there feeling full of rage. Next thing I know, this group of adults is standing there declaring we're

were there on the tip of Dean’s tongue, begging to be said, but maybe this wasn’t the time.
“And who exactly is playing human, and who is playing one of the horse–”
“Yeah, and a tree house. Now we can have it all.”
I have never been a fan of Dean Winchester's work, but he has at last come into his own propped up by a strong ensemble cast. His co-stars all give exceptionally strong performances, especially, for my money, Jody Mills as the human centauricorn hunter who convinces the other humans of their wrong-doings.
Please may the earth open and swallow me whole, Dean silently begged. Putting on his most shit-eating grin, he answered: “It was a different experience without him around, but my co-stars really made me feel welcome. Not family in the biological sense this time, but family nonetheless.”
It was Dean’s current obsession.
“Well... that would make sense with the whole closing line,” Castiel replied slowly, looking equally puzzled by what they'd just watched.
“We really actually didn’t.”
They’d started slow, trying to remember each others’ bodies. Trying to remember what they’d both taken for granted when they’d first become physically intimate with one another. Dean had taken surprisingly well to being handcuffed to his bed while Castiel slid into his already loose, sloppy hole. Dean had shown Castiel different types of ropes they could try, different uses to anti-gravitation booths that he’d seen in his virtual pornography travels. They’d taken full advantage of the new room Sam had created to reconnect in a way they hadn’t in so long.
"It's this new technique with the glass."
Sam silently hoped so, it was a surprisingly comforting thought. He also had a gut feeling he didn’t know Dean half as well as he’d assumed.
“Fuck, oh fuckkkk,” Castiel moaned, writhing with his back against the shower.
“But they aren't even your real... you know, cocks, on show. So what does size have to do with it?”
“Weird.” Dean was too tired and sated to think through the ramifications of this.
“Water’s good with me,” Dean assured her.
“Sweetheart...” Castiel rearranged them so Dean was now sat on Castiel’s cum-slicked lap. He cradled Dean’s head to his shoulder. “It’s okay, you must have wanted this for a very long time.”
That was, until Castiel and Dean decided to kiss in the middle of the red carpet.
No, no, Dean wouldn’t like that… or would he?
It wasn’t until near the end of the dinner that Sam and Castiel were left to themselves while both of the other Winchesters went to the restroom.
He slipped in a third finger and set about trying to locate Dean’s prostate. It was nearly Castiel’s favorite spot on Dean’s body, third only to his soul and eyes.
“You're late, Winchester!”
“Hi, Sammy.” His voice was shaky and his body unclothed.
“You caught me,” Dean smirked, reaching down to grasp his thickening cock with his right hand.
That was the day things changed in Dean Winchester’s life forever.
Dean whistled. “That's gotta be love.”
The lube left on his hand from fingering Dean earlier was almost dry or wiped off elsewhere now, but that didn't seem to matter as Dean somehow managed to rock up into Castiel's fist and down onto Castiel's cock all at once. Dean marveled at the friction Castiel's nearly lube-less hand provided.
Dean chuckled, “Yeah.”
“Over there,” Castiel pointed towards two suitcases he had ready to go.
“Not for the time being. I'm writing a new play, as it happens.”
they bring food. Double sexy.”
“Well then, please stand so we can go upstairs. I would rather use a bed for this.”
“Yeah, I meant to tell you I had an idea for your next book, based on this dream I had last night.”
“The walk of shame? Really now, Sammy.” Dean’s smile was huge.
Castiel brushed some of the hair out of Sam’s face and tucked it behind his ear.
And he had Sam and Cas. Alive, well, and happy.
“A garden? You think that will save Dean?”
“She’d have wanted you to be happy, you know? People change, they move on, that’s allowed.”
“Ya know, you’re my last delivery of the night,” Dean let on one evening seven weeks on. The pizza obsession had died down to twice a week, but only through pure will power and regular yoga sessions.
Dean laughed.
Dean could understand his brother’s confusion. He knew he’d spent too much of his life addicted to the pleasures of the flesh, indulging his sex drive, but somewhere along the line, after Castiel had moved in almost full time, Dean started to discover new pleasures. The pleasure of seeing things grow.
He seemed to Sam to be enjoying their forced convalescence while the others fought the druids pent on ending the world. With their muscle weakness as it was, they’d agreed it was safer if they stayed back. Three days from being woken up even Castiel was not fully back to his normal self.
“I–” Dean took another deep breath. “Not funny.” He took an accusatory finger at Castiel. “Not funny at all.”
Sam wanted to roll his eyes at the pathetic way they were looking at one another now.
They were both drunk, but not so badly that Dean felt this was a bad idea. His palms felt sweaty. He'd only met Castiel today, and yet, here they were, walking side-by-side into Dean's rooms.
“Hi, Dean. What's up?”
“So even at that age you knew you wanted to be an actor?”
He should have known when the script writer walked through the first cast rehearsal in just his tighty-whiteys and an untied dressing gown, while he clutched a bottle of whiskey in one hand, that something was deeply wrong.
“Your taxi to the airport is here, sir,” the bellboy told them.
"Oh, um, yeah. I saw your post about it and thought why not?" Dean laughed self-consciously. "I won't be offended if you don't let me have the job, Mr. Cas. I'm sure other people have heaps more experience."
Minds lesser than mine would perhaps not fully
Camera flashes went off all around him as he stopped to pose for various photographers. The photographers weren't as interested in him as they were his female co-stars, who had actually put effort into their outfits.
“Dad, can we test this tomorrow morning?” Claire held the potato gun up.
Castiel smiled sadly. “I feel with you like everything I am is somehow
Everyone together, for the very first time.
Castiel was unaware of the silent crying, unable to see much beyond the vast, flawless expanse of Sam’s well-muscled back.
It was on the tip of Sam’s tongue to say no. He was curious about Dean’s cop friends though, curious enough to say “Sure, just let me wash up?”
He looked back and forth between his brother and his best friend.
“The brownies!” Donna sighed. “And the donuts. You know I put on 3 lbs after your brother learned how to make choux pastry?”
Castiel huffed out a laugh. “I used to be in the military. And I promise you, as a kid, that was all I ever wanted to do.”
Her head swivelled to look at Dean. “Is that your name? That’s an outdated name, isn’t it?
“You know Sam’s going to get cranky if you continue to be this loud though.”
“Do you know how to fix a windowpane?” Castiel questioned Dean when the kids had left so they could get dressed for the day.
Castiel suddenly seemed to withdraw, staring with great intent at a section of the patterned carpet under his feet.
“All I wanted to do was be back with you and Mom.”
He took a few steps and rammed his shoulder into the door. The door flung open and Sam was falling… falling…
“Is that why,” Donna paused to hiccup. “Is that why you've never done
His voice was a little muffled now but Castiel heard every word said and unsaid.
“Spend the evening with
“Soon as I hang up on you? I'm going to book myself on the next available flight to Poland.”
Fuck. Fuckity fuck, fuck. Fucksticks.
Celia was sharp – Dean would give her that much – but still a drunk, nonetheless.
“Well, if you're sure the film's on the level–”
“I... I feel it too,” Castiel assured him.
There was definitely something to all of this that made Castiel feel Dean had gotten it right falling into lust with the virtual world of desire he’d been stuck in so often.
“I couldn’t see you suffer any longer. We returned you to a younger form of yourself, to help you. You really will have to run the bar, I don’t think your back could have taken it previously.” Castiel looked a little guilty.
“We do?” Castiel didn't sound convinced.
Dean looked up at Castiel, concern dropping onto his face. “Of course I had fun, I’d tell you otherwise. You’ve got no reason to doubt yourself.”
"Would you be open to a trial period?"
“Sometimes, Sam…” Castiel hesitated, not quite sure how best to communicate to Sam things as he saw them. “You’re still fairly new to this
Dean observed him walking around naked, smiling at how dorky yet adorable Castiel was. Dean took a moment while Castiel was busy with the room climate control to grab lube and condoms for them.
“It kinda is?” Dean pulled himself a beer from the tap and drank half of it down without pause. “I’m immortal so long as I stay in this building, therefore, I can do what I want, when I want. You know, Cas, in another universe, where you had nothing, you turned to drugs and orgies to cope? How is what I’m doing any different?” Dean smiled dopily at them both. “Gotta go wash up for the orgy!” he laughed to himself, ignoring the looks Sam and Cas shared.
“Centuricorns,” repeated Bela.
“No biggie, it happens. Besides, I’ve had way worse than that at work.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Of course. Handcuffs and a gun under the pillow.”
Dean writhed and moaned as Castiel continued to play, twisting his fingers around, pulling slightly, caressing Dean on the inside. He could feel the lube slip down and coat his thighs, but couldn't bring himself to care.
“Well, six serious offers anyway,” he clarified.
“Yeah.” Dean sounded so sure, so unwavering, it made Sam smile.
Castiel sighed. “We didn’t really, you know that.”
“Thank you,” Castiel whispered to Dean as they slipped out of Jack’s bedroom. “You’re really good with him, with both of them.”
Jody grinned wickedly. “Considering how much we've drank tonight, I think some burgers are called for.”
“I'm hungry,” Donna sighed, slouching. “I hate this movie star diet thing. They have whole tables of catering food and I can't touch any of it.”
“We’ll find one, we’ll find a way to keep Dean happy.” Sam felt confident as he said this. “We always do,” he added, more to reassure himself than for Castiel’s benefit. “And so long as Dean’s happy, we can keep the peace. It’s been going so well, Cas.”
Dean had never been too happy doing the press bit before a movie release, but he was well rehearsed. He knew to stick to whatever the PR gurus told him, flash out a few cute stories around the production, and generally smile a lot.
“Castiel?” Sam called out as Castiel walked away.
“Yeah... Chuck's brilliant, please don't think I'm disrespecting the guy – he did train me after all. But it turned out if we wanted to keep the film a PG-13, we couldn't show a female's nipples for the entire film.”
“That sounds like you’re speaking from experience.”
Castiel snapped his fingers and the cuffs disappeared from Dean’s wrists. Dean tried not to feel upset about the release given the deep, red marks left behind. He rubbed at the marks while Castiel and Sam talked over his head.
The kids scurried up the stairs to their bedrooms after quickly hugging Dean good night.
It’d been nearly thirty-seven years since Sam took control of Hell, and twenty since Castiel became de facto leader of Heaven. Dean had grown used to mostly being alone, while his brother and… well, whatever Castiel was to him these days, were busy keeping their universe whole. Cas had been due a visit the previous month. Dean hadn’t been holding his breath he’d actually make it. The way time worked between the realms was weird enough anyway, but coupled with the fact that the longer Sam and Cas spent away, the less important to them Earth seemed to be, meant Dean saw them less and less.
“Shut up you,” Dean grinned. “This ain't because of you.”
Things were going to be okay, Dean decided about halfway up to the tree house, where Sam was already sitting and throwing down jibes about how Dean laid eggs.
That seemed to do the trick. Donna, Dean and Jody all fought to be the first one scanned in the machine.
Dean hissed. “Cas.”
“And I ask you again – why the hell not? Go do what makes you happy, even if that is this Cas guy.”
“This has to be about $2 worth of lube here, Dean.” Castiel had poured a good amount over his fingers, so much so that they were dripping. He moved so he had better leverage to properly finger fuck Dean. He inserted his middle finger first, straight in, right up to the second knuckle.
do love you,” Dean winced.
“Now I know about the mess the film is going to definitely be, I can get ahead and start booking work for after. Donna suggested TV. I'd never thought of it before then, but now, I sort of like the idea.”
Later that evening, when he finally allowed himself to self pleasure, he came in record time. And as he drifted off to sleep he wondered when he'd started seeing green instead of white stars at the point of bliss.
Dean had no right to be annoyed or upset about the fact he was pretty much locked up here, not when he was the one who agreed to it in the first place.
His voice was level and calm, but his body was tense, like he was prepared for a physical at attack any moment.
Castiel re-positioned himself again. Running his hands along Dean's back again, and then over his ass and down his thighs.
“You work really hard too, Mr. Cas. You go at it harder than anyone I’ve ever met. Always up in that office of yours, pushing yourself. Anyway, I need to get to my next delivery. See you soon!”
“Where was your favorite place to live?”
“If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck…”
And it would be all the better, knowing he had Castiel by his side, now, then, and hopefully forever.
“This is not my fault,” Chuck spat back, putting his palms out towards her while shaking his hands and head. “Not. My. Fault.
“They are telling me to rip up my beautiful masterpiece and torture it!” Chuck Shurley announced to the cast, who had been assembled for a first read through. “I might as well puke on it now, because that's what it will become.”
“I was guessing,” Castiel shrugged. “But I look forward to finding out for myself if the rumors are true.”
The less selfish version of Castiel would just let Dean go. Let him go do what he wanted so badly to do. The irony of this being Castiel was already the least selfish person Dean knew.
With his family around him, laughing, getting along, he felt like he could achieve anything, even the next few weeks of doing international press for a movie he didn't understand.
“I've been out of the country a lot in recent years,” Castiel explained.
“Huh.” Dean let himself drop back onto the couch next to Castiel. “If there’s only ever ten Castiels, maybe something does happen.”
for months. Couldn't figure out why they'd do any of what they were doing. And it isn't like I can even tell the press about it – I'd end up sound like a loon, or getting blacklisted for talking bad about a film I'm in.”
He unbuckled his belt and slipped it through the loops.
“When did they announce that?”
“He's a centaur,” Dean huffed.
“Daddy, as you’re both boys, who buys flowers for who?”
“We also wanted hot meals and clean clothes as kids.”
“I agree,” Kevin sighed, hanging his head with shame. “It was that or they were going to kill the movie. Death was hanging around the set you see–”
“To my career never starting,” added Donna pitifully.
“I’ve seen bigger.”
“What if this isn’t real, Cas?”
Years of work went into the planning, while they all helped out to keep Heaven going as much as possible. Propping up the crumbling infrastructure so badly needed to keep their world in one piece. And when they’d achieved everything they wanted to achieve, they realized one important thing they’d neglected: Heaven still needed a leader. They tried to make it work with a board of angels to debate and vote on matters, but too many critical decisions had to be made in the background to make this a consistently useful set-up.
“You bake them?” Dean was suddenly deadly serious. Sam wondered if this was his tone for interrogations too.
Sam nodded, “Of course, Cas, of course. We won’t take advantage of him, okay?”
“Oh.”
“How are you feeling this morning?”
Dean put the back of his hand up to Jack’s forehead. “He doesn’t feel hot,” Dean told Castiel. “Do you feel sick?” Dean asked the child.
“The dumb white picket fence.” Dean shook his head. “Well, not that. But what it symbolizes: the feeling of home.”
“You know how to replace a windowpane, kid?”
“Yes?” Castiel encouraged, breathing erratic with excitement.
Castiel had packed up the stuff from the hotel he'd been staying in and moved into Dean's rooms.
The plan concocted to resupply Heaven was so crazy Rowena had initially refused to be a part of it. The options available to them though were limited and Heaven cracked a little each passing second, wrecking Castiel’s nerves as he waited for it to all shatter apart.
Swirling his tongue around the top of Castiel's cock once more, Dean also took the opportunity to yank on Cas' balls.
“And when they ask about the ending of the film?” Jody asked in low tones.
“What?” Dean sat forward suddenly. “Are you serious?”
Dean swallowed. “Whatever happens,” he repeated, tightening his grip on Castiel's hand.
It was Dean’s turn to lean in and kiss Castiel. More thoroughly than their last, with more depth and heat as Castiel reacted back.
He barely knew Castiel, and really didn’t know Dean as well as he should, but this still felt so right and Sam was so tired of second guessing himself lately.
. He wasn’t meant to live to 80, but he had. Castiel and Sam would live forever, in control, busy and respected by those they led.
“Really? That would be pretty awesome.”
“He loves us,” Castiel said emphatically, “both of us, very much.”
tonight. Like you think I’m out for random hook-ups and you’re okay with that.”
It was, Dean reflected, a question he himself had wondered, but hadn't dared ask for fear of offending Castiel.
“It’s the only thing that makes him feel anything anymore.”
Castiel nodded. “I’d like that, Sam.” They exchanged phone numbers and Sam used the opportunity to get Castiel to input his name so he could look up what the hell it meant without having to figure out the correct spelling.
The patrons to the bar had died off, literally and metaphorically, as the world around them changed. No one was interested in the ancient history inside the bar anymore. The wards woven into the brick of the building had gotten stronger over the years to the point where humans would barely dare to step foot inside, leaving Dean most months to himself.
Castiel lifted his hand and brought it down again, hearing, feeling, experiencing the crack of his palm on Dean’s behind.
“I ain't going to do that.”
At some point in his life, Dean Winchester turned (biologically) 80 years old. It was not a number he thought he’d ever lived to see. His hands shook when he opened his medication bottles and the cold air in the bunker made him hurt more often than not in the mornings. And in the evenings. And really all day every day, if he was being totally honest. Castiel’s grace could only fix so much. His touch brought joy to Dean now, not just from the fact it meant for a few days Dean felt young again, pain-free again, but also for the company he provided when he came to visit Dean to administer care.
He thought he might soon grow bored of pizza, but his appetite for it didn’t seem to abate. There was just too much pleasure to be had from the whole process.
“Why do I look like this?” his voice was emotionless.
“You need to go into that room. There's a rack of clothes on the side, pick whatever you like. We don't have time to do anything about your hair now, let alone your face,” she tutted. “Press op starts in three. Be at the waiting area behind the stage curtain in two!”
“What about chocolates?” Castiel asked, having no one else to get advice from. The twins could be surprisingly insightful at times.
“Hello, Dean.” He brushed a kiss to the top of Dean’s head and sat down at a seat across from the position Dean was occupying at the table.
Castiel placed a hand over his own mouth and used it to muffle a bitter laugh. “Wouldn’t that have been nice?”
“Yes, it is stipulated in your contract.”
, a handfull or so though...”
of money on it.”
“You’ve only got your pants left to go, so those.”
“I'm glad to be here, and can't wait to hear more about this unicorn–”
After two weeks at Bobby's, his agent finally called to tell him he was due back on set Monday to finish off
“So you’re just going to go home after this?”
) was also ready to tear down Dean whenever she could.
“You started it,” Dean laughed.
“Yes, Castiel's a male.”
“How'd you want me, big boy?” he teased Castiel.
“Claire,” Castiel sighed.
Castiel Ten pulled out slightly just as he came, ensuring his offering landed mostly in Dean’s mouth across his tongue.
“Come on in, sit down. You must be tired from your travels. We have a little while before we need for the premiere.” Castiel ushered the family towards the living room area in their suite.
“That’s just how you trick people into buying more of that crap, isn’t it?”
“To beef up the production budget. Claim it was all for the sake of the environment. Shooting in a real forest would have cost a tenth of what it will to put it all in digitally.”
He knew he should have been happy about the fact he was likely going to get the job, if their reaction was anything to go by. He had the credentials and knew he’d impressed at least Talbot with his knowledge of their clients. Feeling down over his success, Sam stopped at the first decent looking bar he could find on his drive back to Dean’s house. Aware of the fact he had to drive back and not feeling keen on having to call a cab to get home, Sam ordered a tonic water.
“I don't... sorry. That keeps coming out wrong. I'm more in... awe. I'm really not used to this Hollywood stuff.”
“What does it even mean? Who is doing this!” Dean shouted over the ever loudening voice. Castiel appeared behind him.
The fork in Sam’s hand felt heavier all of a sudden. He put it down feeling a little dizzy.
“We’re all going to come in your mouth, Dean. Everyone knows you want to figure out if there’s a difference in the taste.”
“Do you understand now?” Ten was enough surely to give him a taste? Castiel didn’t want to take things too far.
“Was it hard, being a half horse thing?” Donna asked. “I wish we'd gotten to see what you guys were up to.”
Castiel weighed this up. “Not so much that. I don't think they expected Chuck to go off the deep end like he did.”
They kept at it, Castiel Four giving Dean his dick hard and fast, both of them approaching a hypnotic rut of moving flesh. At some point Castiel Four’s inner elbow ended up around Dean’s throat, helping Dean stay balanced on the arm of the sofa as well as giving Castiel Four a good levering point to pound him even deeper. They both knew just how tight Castiel could be around Dean’s throat, where the perfect balance was between erotically helpful and Dean passing out accidentally.
They talked, Dean found out Castiel had accidentally been woken up with the noise.
“I can do that. I can be good.”
They sat in the living room area of Dean's suite at the table in there so they could eat and continue talking.
“Er, maybe not a
He really didn’t know why. It just seemed a really Dean-thing. “Isn’t it the point of humanity? Reproduce and leave a bit of yourself behind?”
It was a conversation they should have had a long time ago, if Castiel was being honest with himself.
They couldn't create new angels, and while they discovered demons and witches with proper bribes, force, or false-promises of future power, could be counted on to do the bare minimum to keep operations going, it was not a long-term plan and they needed long term.
“Oh.” Castiel looked sad again.
“It’s… it’s beautiful.”
Dean sighed. “Right, right. Well, breakfast first. And then after that we’re going to go to the hardware store, pick up a few things, and I’ll teach you how to replace the glass.”
Dean Winchester, child star, had signed up for this film thinking it would be his big break into films for a more mature audience. He and his brother Sam had been in a series of successful child-centered action films. When Sam had decided to retire from the movie business, Dean had found himself at a loss for what to do. He felt the critics (
A huge smile broke out on Dean’s face. “Huh. Dork,” he winked at Castiel.
“A little of both? I need to hit the shower.” Sam pointed towards the closed bathroom door and slinked off to the sound of Dean laughing.
“You’re never homeless so long as I got a roof over my head, okay? Stop being a Crying Clara and let’s get this show on the road.”
His super-ego had been slaughtered and turned into compost.
“It would be about two human men, who find love in strange ways.”
“Pleeeeasseee,” Dean whimpered quietly, very happy to comply.
“Pizza delivery driver? It’s a cliché for a reason. And unlike the plumber fantasy, the delivery driver isn’t going to cost you a mortgage to call out
With the demons more-or-less under control, Hell became less of an issue. Demons became less of an issue. Sure, they were still required to gank those that couldn't stay in order enough to obey a simple 'don't fuck up' rule. A little mischief went unnoticed, and he allowed them to keep making their deals. It was harm of unsuspecting bystanders Sam outlawed.
Dean scoffed then hauled himself to his feet.
“What’s going on here? You two have been acting weird all evening.”
From rumors of the film's struggle to completion, I was expecting an out right
“I’m sorry about your shirt.” Castiel nodded to the vomit, most of which Dean had sponged off at some point.
“They hired Chuck knowing he'd become a drunken mess, so they could get rid of him and pretend all the script difficulties were the mistake of multiple people?”
“That's sort of the problem,” said a miserable sounding Kevin, their new writer. “We have too many endings.”
Dean shot Sam his version of a bitch face.
“Yes?”
Castiel was fighting an urge to take the giant gummy from his son, but the kid looked so happy with it he didn’t think it would end well.
Dean whined and seemed generally pleased with this news.
Castiel stood his ground. “That isn’t the case,” he said calmly.
Dean joined them in the kitchen and let out a long, low whistle at the number of bags on the floor.
"Great! And then after, could you can clean the pool like normal? Really get in there, especially around the rim. Where the fallen plant matter hasn’t been cleaned up I’m afraid it might be a little worse than normal."
“Please, please,” he panted after what felt like forever. “Please, fuck me. I need your cock inside me.”
“I'm going to turn the thermostat up a little. I don't want you catching a cold just because you wanted sex instead of a towel.”
“Blowing me?” Dean asked, incredulous.
Castiel stuck a hand out to shake.
Now the idea was in his head, Castiel wanted to test it out. To see if it was anything like his dream-self had thought and if he’d enjoyed it as much as his dream-self had.
Dean realized then what his silence probably seemed like to Cas. “What? Oh! Yeah, of course, that was... freaking awesome,” he finished with a dazed and happy look on his face. “In fact... I wouldn't mind another go.”
just an inferior genetic relation.
“And am I expected to also have myself on show, if these gentlemen are all to be without pants and shirt?”
“He’s my best friend.” Dean was trying to be stoic but Sam could see his walls were breaking down. “If it doesn’t work out, I don’t got much else. If we don’t work out…” Dean was stood almost toe-to-toe with Castiel now. “I didn’t expect to feel like this about you, about anyone. But here we are, just two dumbasses, and yeah, I think I maybe in love with you.”
Becky laughed back, as if it was some amusing ongoing joke between them instead of the truth.
“Right.”
Sam snorted. “And risk you looking younger than me?”
"We could borrow a couple of angels," Dean threw out during one discussion session.
“You mean my tackles going to be out there, free as the wind?” Garth wondered.
“So, is he going to be back next week?” Sam heard Donna asking Dean as he walked back towards the dining room.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at this. “We have a whole kissing scene? I had to film that one about twelve times pretending some person dressed all in blue was you.”
But ultimately, of course, the brothers would save the day.
Days like this Dean couldn't understand why he'd ever leave the bar. He was happy here, and yeah, he'd never made a huge amount of money but he always had enough to live on.
Benny chuckled. “She knows I love the restaurant, but she knows every now and then, I still get bitten by the acting bug, so she don't mind me clearin' out for a bit every now and then. Secretly I think she likes getting the bed to herself. Plus, being in a few films draws the clients to us, people get a kick out of having their food cooked-up by someone who has acted with Annie Jones.”
“Dean wouldn’t, you know? Even with everything that happened with dad, he didn’t hurt him, Cas. He’s loyal, damn loyal. Dean understands what we’re doing, that this is all for the greater good. We move him to Heaven or to Hell and we upset the balance of
Dean had his eyes shut and was leaning in. Sam smiled and went to creep out of the room to give them some privacy. Their lips were a hair away from touching Sam looked back a final time. He was happy for them.
“Is Dean…?” Sam thumbed towards the backdoor office.
on its front to read the back cover description. “How did you know?”
In the end the three of them filmed four, maybe five separate possible endings to the film – it wasn't clear. Dean started to wonder if he was living in a nightmare. He pinched himself after having to do thirty takes speaking to a green ball on a stick, which was meant to be his co-star, Castiel.
Dean didn't dare turn around least his expression of amazement give away to the assembled audience just how many lies Castiel was currently telling.
“Then go for it.”
“Unf, yessss,” Dean agreed happily.
“You know that’s not how it works.” Castiel picked up on the jealousy in Dean’s tone, but was starting to feel annoyed. “Then why didn’t you tell me in the other world how you felt? This shouldn’t all be on me.”
Dean had stolen from him, slept with his girlfriend, all around not been the greatest big brother in the world. But the moment he’d heard from Sam that he was planning on packing up and leaving town, he’d said “It’ll be okay, Sammy,” and there he was two days later with donuts.
"Nah, you're good, get home to that lovin' family of yours," he winked at her.
Taking Castiel’s lead, Sam reached out and shook the offered hand.
Dean was dressed in his normal khaki shorts, baseball cap on, framing his delicately freckled skin and plump lips.
What more could he ever want?
Neither of them was asleep, content to revel in a semi-lucid state, just happy with the comfort of being next to each other. It was never guaranteed that there would be a next time for moments like this. They’d both agreed that instead of worrying over the future, they’d just live in the present and do what they could to be together when they could control it.
“You deserve to be used so well. You deserve to know what it is like to serve so many men at once, to have their cum pour over you and be rubbed into your skin.”
“Yeah well, if I’d told Jess a little sooner what my feelings were, I wouldn’t be limping towards 40 without a roof of my own over my head or any idea on what I wanted from the future.”
Sam’s jaw dropped. He was more surprised how much the sentiment hurt than anything.
“It doesn’t matter how many times we couple, I’ll never be over how perfect this feels.”
“I, um, wanted to check you were alive.”
He choked on his mouthful of food and only managed to stop when Dean slapped his back, hard.
“Er…” Dean thought a moment. He shuffled further onto the bed. “This is going to sound lame.”
“I think I maybe love him,” Dean blurted out. He was fidgeting with the old knitted blanket he’d taken to keeping draped over his legs.
. I don't want to end up with zero options.”
“Pfffft,” and an eye roll was Dean’s only response. He revved up his engine and had pulled away before Sam even finished putting the coordinates into his GPS.
Dean was so vulnerable when he was turned on, so prone to honesty. It was something Castiel had only discovered about the other man since they’d first gotten together the previous month. It was also just one of the many reasons he knew he had to protect Dean from others. Had to do everything he could to ensure he was the only being that got to see Dean like this for the rest of their lives.
“I bet you’ll still be all wet from the lube I left in there. Do you want a plug to keep you all ready for me later?”
With this, Castiel inserted one of his very well lubed-up fingers.
“That's pretty cool. What's it about?” Dean asked.
“And I'm going back to my restaurant,” Benny told them all.
“As friends?” Castiel said after a pause.
“I keep telling you, you need to replace that car. The mileage is crap.”
One moment they were sitting on the couch. The next Dean had tugged Castiel up and was kissing him deeply, rubbing up against him, both trying to press as closely together as they could, a few more buttons getting undone.
“Good to see you too, buddy,” he chimed back.
“Sorry! Traffic was bad!” he gasped, running towards the lady with the clipboard. If they had a clipboard and headset, experience had taught Dean to just listen to them.
“Not even a little.”
All Dean knew of Castiel’s career from what Castiel had told him was that he’d followed in his father’s footsteps and became an author. Dean didn’t know Castiel often wrote books that were prized most highly for their innovative and boundary-expanding sex scenes. It was probably for the best he didn’t know more, but that didn’t stop Castiel from sometimes trying to gauge Dean’s opinion on different activities while he was debating the batting order for the scene he was about to write.
“But I feel with each year, he’s growing closer to doing something he and us will regret. The garden was an amazing idea. He’s tended to it well, and it’s so peaceful and beautiful there. The playroom? Also inspired. I’ve enjoyed getting to learn this side of Dean more than I can word, however…”
“I’m angry at myself!” Dean took a deep breath. “I’m angry with myself,” he repeated, quieter this time. “Cas, you’re my best friend.”
Benny Lafitte, who was sat to Dean's left, turned a laugh into a poorly disguised cough.
“If you think he feels good when you fuck him, wait until you’ve fucked him after a few other dicks have been inside,” Castiel Nine said to Castiel One.
“What else do you wanna know?” Dean said through a mouth of half-chewed eggs.
Sam snorted with laughter down the phone. “Wow. You're really gone on him, aren't you? To bring out your chick flick side.”
work? And all the other adventures you'd miss out on?” Deam rambled on, nervously.
Castiel didn’t need any more prompts though.
Dean wiped the grease off his fingers with a paper napkin. “It’ll get better. You’re scared now because you don’t know what’s coming. You’ve defined yourself by your work for so long that’s gotta be scary too, just quitting like that. But I’m here for you, Sammy. You ain’t doing this alone. Life isn’t ever perfect. We always want things we can’t have,” Dean’s eyes flicked briefly to the couple cuddled up in a nearby booth, “but then again, we are the Winchesters. If we ever got everything we wanted–”
Sam’s expression dropped. “Oh.” It had been just over thirteen years since their dad had passed away. “Yeah, of course.”
“You show me how to do that and I’ll show you how to get a plastic army figure out of a child’s nose without them crying.”
“I've just had a big shock and found out that my career as an actor is destined to be destroyed due to one lousy script choice. I probably need supervision in the shower.”
He didn’t elaborate more, and Sam didn’t ask. He could guess, but after the weeks (months?) of trouble he’d been having trying to get the new soul sector open, Sam wasn’t really in the mood to hear Castiel’s troubles, as selfish as it might be.
That was only two days and then they'd be separated.
“The seat is blue?” the stranger responded.
“Good? Surprisingly good.”
“I…” Sam sighed. “Yes.” He ran his hands through his hair. “None of us are happy right now.”
“Don’t you think I’m... less of a man or something?”
Dean flushed.
“How are you so sure?”
Sam was aware though that he’d only been living with Dean for just over a week and already learned more about his brother than he had in the past ten years combined.
“I'm deeply sorry you were dragged into this, Dean,” Castiel said so sincerely Dean couldn't help but believe him.
“Gonna be a hot mess. If I don't take the work now while I can, offers are going to stop coming, and I won't have a choice in if I want to keep being an actor or not.”
“What do we say?” Castiel prompted.
in a way nothing had in so long.
is to BDSM,” Chuck muttered darkly. He'd at least put on a t-shirt and sweatpants this time round.
Donna thought this through a moment.
“HA! Exactly,” Sam said with great glee. “The whole bit where Cas' character holds your character and then Missy goes
, he begged, unsure if he was thinking the words or saying them allowed – a combination of the two?
“Mornin',” Dean greeted Castiel when he heard the other man waking up the following day.
More than the thing between him and Cas, Sam had been caught up on another part of their dream.
Sam nodded in agreement. He’d never doubted that.
“Those fuckers,” Chuck mumbled, reaching into the bag at his feet and pulling out another bottle. He took a long draw straight from the bottle.
Dean went to open the door.
“So you don’t want me to be more direct?” Dean pulled forwards, one hand coming off the headboard so he could touch Castiel’s shoulder.
“Aha,” Dean agreed, feeling almost groggy with desire.
“Jack, how many times have I told you not to open the door without an adult there?” Castiel chided, catching up with his son at the door.
“Ah, for you we're thinking topless as well, but nothing lower down, we'll cover that tastefully. But the nipples–”
Jack slowly looked up and gave Dean such a look of open admiration Cas felt his heart grow two sizes.
Dean shrugged. “Gotta make a living and all that. Bills to pay, books to buy, website subscriptions I need. I get huge tips in this job. Just massive. College town, lots of trust fund babies getting high and hungry on daddy’s dollar.”
“You heard what Claire said, that they wanted to keep us a bit unhappy. When they tried to give us everything we wanted we didn’t believe it was real and woke up.”
“I suggested it to her, maybe moving. She… she was not keen. Then we had this whole
“So magnanimous of you, Dean,” Jody rolled her eyes again. “And pie for the rest of you?”
“Most are,” Castiel sighed, adding his agreement to Dean’s statement. “Though, if they weren’t, would I even have a job?”
Dean was moving back to meet Castiel Five’s rhythm.
“He wants more, constantly more,” Castiel explained, trying to get through to Sam what was being created here. That Dean’s desire to achieve his preferred headspace was taking increasingly extreme measures as time went on.
He microwaved his leftovers from the night before as lunch and ate that while contemplating in vague terms his presentation for the interview on Monday. He might not want the job but he needed to shake off this persistent fatigue as quickly as he could. Having a goal, having a place he had to be at a certain time, having a
Sam nodded. “I know. Me too. I don’t always remember what it feels like to be fully human anymore, Cas. I know that. But that doesn’t mean I don’t love him or you.”
“And you used protection?” Dean asked with a wince.
“I sorta want to run to the airport right now and stop Cas from leaving on that plane,” he admitted, taken aback by the stupidity of his own thoughts.
The joy of seeing a seed germinate and turn into a small sapling had awakened in him something he thought he’d lost. And it wasn’t that Dean was suddenly going to turn down Castiel’s cock or the chance to be tied up and suspended for a little while, all of that made him feel so happy and comfortable now. But the garden… the garden…
Apparently Dean’s ex was still a soft spot then.
“So, did you grow up in Russia? You said you were there as a baby?”
“Nothing has to change if you don’t want it to.” Castiel’s voice was firm but his eyes were warm.
“How was work? How did the appraisals go?”
“Dean's been a delight to work with. He's brought so much to the role. My co-star has taught me a lot about the profession, as have all these kind actors on stage with me here now.”
“She probably is,” Jody agreed readily. “But have you ever seen her blink?”
“And all the crazy CGI?” Dean asked.
“But after that, perhaps, for a while?” Dean said hopefully. “How long will you be there?”
Please check it out and give the artist some love.
“I have a couple of contacts if you’re still looking for something new, Sam.”
“And does sex with a near stranger help alleviate the symptoms?”
“They’re awake,” she confirmed to someone standing behind her behind her.
“Last one there lays eggs!” Sam shouted suddenly, taking off for the wooden rope ladder acting as the only route of access into the tree house – at least for those without the ability to fly.
"You're familiar with how to use this?" Castiel nodded towards the mower.
“But Jodyyyyy,” Charlie whinged. “You know left to our own devices we would have just had pizza and wings tonight.”
“I’m a paramedic. Now I help people instead of just...” Castiel trailed off and finished up the last of his drink. “Well, you know, hurt people.”
Dean's family were arriving at the hotel mid-afternoon so they could catch up before the film premiere later. Only Sam knew that Dean was bringing Castiel along with him. If Dean was being honest with himself, he was a little tense about introducing a special someone to his parents for the first time.
They sat in silence for much of the drive back.
“It was a damn horse breeding bench, I'd swear on my mamma's grave,” John helpfully added, apparently close to laughter himself.
What we've just seen is the first official footage. We've recently wrapped up on shooting and are now in post-production.
Sam turned around the piece of paper he’d been writing on to share his idea with Castiel. Paper he’d plucked out of existence as easy as breathing these days, such was the way his powers felt so much a part of him now.
