There was a tense moment of silence before the lock clicked, the door slowly creaking open to reveal his kids tear stained baby face - Steve immediately lost all resolve as his shoulders slumped at his son’s appearance. “Im sorry, kid. Tell you what, if we leave now we will still have time to swing by McDonald’s for breakfast?”
"Yes I swear straight there." Flash nodded, "let me go grab the keys- I'll be right back. Dont move."
But what if that's what this will lead to? Maybe that's all it will take, just one pill and he will gain this kids favor. One pill one time and never again.
-12:30 PM-
"No. For the last time you're not going out tonight. We ordered dinner already, Tony is staying over. You can go next time." Steve responded, his own tone making it clear hed probably repeated the statement a hundred times now.
"I dunno. I'm not gonna be the reason you get scared of the guy and I'm not the one who knows enough about him to tell you regardless." Happy stretched back to hand the kid his slushie, placing his own in the cup holder next to him. "Even so, I doubt Tony would let it go on once they move in. If with Harley, then definatly not with you."
"How was the first day, kid?" Happy glanced at him in the rearview mirror upon pulling away from the curb.
Just then his phone started buzzing, startling Peter out of his head. He sat up, grabbing at his phone and swiping to accept the call.
"Well Flash is a dick. So are his friends." Happy replied, being familiar with the name by now. "Steve likes you, I dont see why his kid wouldnt."
The boy grinned, showing off his braces (although the boys teeth were already rather straight, he must be close to the end of his treatment), "Sure am. Listen, I saw you in first period and it looks like you could use some friends." He began, his initial group noticed the obvious pack-leaders absence and began their way to join them, "I'm having a party this weekend at my house, a little back-to-school thing. You interested?"
Harley sighed but nodded, popping another bite of egg into his mouth.
He pulled his schedule out of his bag, scanning the sheet to see what classroom he had to be in for the next two hours. 'Engineering --- Room 398B' was written in bold, the boy felt his tense shoulders relax a bit. He had homeroom after that, he perked up knowing he was able to finish off at least half the days of his school weeks with a subject that came easy to him.
Harley felt himself smile, "Yeah, that sounds fun- ah shit I cant" his gaze dropped, "I forgot I'm meeting my dads uh-... Girlfriend on Saturday."
“Harley Keen Rogers im losing my patience here bud,” His father rubbed the bridge of his nose between his fingers, leaning his head against his almost-fourteen year olds locked bedroom door. “I’m not letting you miss your first day. End of story. I’ll drag your butt kicking and screaming if you make me.”
"It was good, I have two classes on A days with Ned and I think I think I have first period with Steve's kid." Peter reported, smiling to himself.
‘He called the kid a kiss-a** for being in a gifted highschool so young.’
Harleys head was throbbing in the best way possible. He was cross faded on like three or four substances by now, he honestly stopped paying attention after Nick packed a third bowl to pass around the circle in the corner of Flash's livingroom.
"Peter you better be dressed, school starts in fifteen minutes!" Happy yelled down the empty hallway.
Steve awoke at roughly 4 am. He looked over to the man sleeping next to him and picked up his phone- suddenly blinded by the light. As Steve was about to roll back over he heard the choking and spluttering coming from down the hall - assuming that must've been what woke him up the man sighed, rubbing his hands aggressively down his face in a useless attempt to wake himself up. He was debating just going back to bed and dealing with it in the morning when Tony started to stir next to him, propping himself up and looking around the dark room.
'At least he's still easy to distract. Maybe I should text Steve tonight, just to make sure everything's really alright.' Tony pondered silently.
Peter strided into his AP chem class, taking an empty seat towards the back of the room with his friend following close behind.
“Will you not call me that infront of him when we get there. It’s super lame.”
Harley blushed, surprised at his father's directness, “I’m not being mean I’m just saying. You asked.”
Harley smiled a bit at that, leaning his head into his dad’s chest as he sucked in a shuddery breath to compose himself, “Okay. If I'm right though i'm never going back. Deal?”
‘I’ll talk to Harley in the morning before we leave. Try to get some sleep love, we have a long day tomorrow.’
-9:50 AM-
"I'm Peter Stark," the boy sounded just about as young as he looked, taking on an anxious tone "I do robotics and AceDeca."
"Because you live in that room kid, dont you want it to be clean? I'm sure you'll find your headphones if you do, too." Happy grabbed the keys to one of the less-luxury cars, twirling them around his index finger. "Its not as if he wont be home again, he'll be back tomorrow morning, kid. You'll have all day tomorrow with him and then-"
The boy felt eyes on him, looking around the room full of kids before his gaze landed on a boy around his age surrounded by four boys. He recognized two or three from his first period, including the initial boy in question. Upon their eyes locking the boy - Flash?- smiled and cut through the crowd on his trek towards him.
"So sneaking out already, huh?" Flash laughed, "What time you want us to drop you at your house?"
He laid the boy down in the teens own bed, grabbing the stuffed dog at the end of his bed and pushing it into his arms. He wiped his kids sweaty forehead with his palm and carded his fingers through the boy's sweat soaked hair. "We can talk about this in the morning kiddo. Try to get some sleep. The garbage can is right next to your bed."
Its one thing to sneak out, sure. But taking random not-candy from a kid he just met while sneaking out? Sure hes smoked pot before, drank a little, but that was with the friends he grew up with, freinds he'd take a bullet for and knew would do the same for him.
"So, what have we learned today?" Steve chided playfully, waving his fork at the younger boy.
"Flash Thomson. AceDeca and ultimate badass," a few kids laughed, Harley found his lip quirking.
"Yeah," Harley responded cautiously, "Flash?"
Tony nodded, pulling Peter's homework from the previous night off of the center island to half-ass check it over,  having full confidence in his son's abilities but wanting to make sure hes not slipping nonetheless. "So how are you feeling about tomorrow? You nervous at all?"
"Hm? Yeah I think so. Somewhere in that general nowhere-ness."
‘God I hope he wasn’t talking abt peter, kid said he was scared that harley already didn’t like him’
"If I'm a toddler that makes you an old man." Peter tilted his head coyly and Tony gasped dramatically.
"Its just Harley, he must be sick." Steve mumbled, sighing as he pushed himself up. "go back to bed, I'll be right back."
How do y’all feel about Harleys character? Any ideas or thoughts about anything to do with him?
"Babe no offense but I doubt hes worried. He went eleven years without either of you knowing the other existed. Let the kid branch out a bit, maybe itll do him some good to meet some people." Tony kissed his boyfriends neck, biting gently on his ear lobe, pulling a shiver from the other man. "Besides, that gives us the whoooole place to ourselves." Tony smirked.
The next time Steve woke up Tony was, surprisingly, already out of bed. Harley was still tucked in tightly but the garbage can Steve supplied was about half full of a smell Tony was all too familiar with.
The boy took the phone and entered in his contact, confidently raising the phone to take a picture of himself for it before handing it back.
-7:15 AM-
"Are you going to do something this stupid again? I know you're not a dumb kid and I'm really hoping this was just a lapse in judgment."
Harley grunted and flinched away in response, "I'll puke on you. Don't tempt me."
"Harley wait! I'm sorry I didnt mean it, I swear to god its just- the drugs and stuff I promise. I'm not like that." The other boy rushed out, grabbing onto Harleys shoulder who only ripped away in response.
-8:02 PM-
"I'm Betty Brant, I um- I do debate and AceDeca, I'm on the yearbook committee too." A blond girl in the utmost front left of the room started the chain, looping a row back before coming to the young boy who nearly came in late.
"Logically yes, I know this." Peter responded curtly, "but part of me knows everything will be different and I hate it. I'm supposed to meet the kid on Saturday and I bet you anything I'll hate him."
Harley sat at an empty table, unwrapping his food and taking a massive bite, smearing a bit of mayo on his cheek that he poked his tongue out in a subtle attempt to lick off.
"And then we have dinner with his boyfriend, yes I know." Peter huffed, slinging his bag over his shoulder. He sighed, rubbing his hands roughly over his face, "I'm sorry, I'm just- I'm just tense."
Peter felt his eyes start to water and he groaned, knowing he was caught. "I just dont see why he had go choose today of all days to stay at Steve's house. It's a tradition by now that on the first day of school me and dad always go to that gelato place - ever since pre school. Its fu-fricking stupid that Steve's kid gets both of them while im- I'm stuck by myself." Peter's voice was cracking and wobbling, trying to hold back tears. God he felt so stupid for crying over this.
"I guess, yeah." Peter mumbled, pulling his phone out of his backpack. He opened snapchat, taking a picture of the slushie cup to send streaks to people. He's 12, sue him. "I just don't want them to fight about it again. Dad was all jumpy for like a week after that whole fiasco."
Peter tensed noticeably, wringing the bottom of his shirt in his hands, "Not really. Kind of. I think I met him already, a boy in my first hour has the same name as him and if that is him I feel like he already doesnt like me. He was like- glaring at me?"
Peter yawned, feeling his eyes drift shut moments before his dads AI shut off the overhead light to the boys room, throwing the boy into further darkness.
"Bullcrap your pupils are like the size of mars right now dude," Flash shorted, finding himself up in Harleys face before he realized what he was doing.
"Yeah shes just acting kinda slow and shes making a little web tunnel n' that usually means they're gonna go into burmation soon. If she doesnt eat the silkworms I can probably just keep them and breed them for when she wakes up."
The world quickly came crashing back into focus when Harley felt a hand down the front of his trunks, roughly shoving the other boy back upon realization. He sobered quickly, getting up out of the water before anyone in it could see how his face was bright red and he was holding his breath to stave off the panicked crying his body felt was not-so appropriate at the moment.
"Let me know dude. You seem cool, I'm sure we have a lot to offer eachother." Flash winked before wandering off, his cronies following close behind.
‘;) ;*’
Steve picked up a small trash can out of the linen closet, holding the teenager close to prevent him from getting dropped as he bent down.
"I'm really considering getting Harley therapy but hes completely against the idea. I don't want to pay $40 an hour just for him to glare at the wall the whole time."
"What would you do if Peter came home hungover?" Steve sighed.
Harley's attention was drawn to the small skinny boy trotting down the steps, his eyes glued to the sidewalk beneath him. He instantly recognized him from his class the other day and he shot a hesitant glance to the man next to him.
Harley nodded, shoving his face into the soft fur of the dog, pulling the blanket up around his shivering shoulders. "M' sorry. Please dont be mad."
He sighed again, getting down next to his kid to help him up. The boy was crying and from the looks of him he seemed to have been crying for quite awhile. Steve rubbed his back gently, pulled him up as if he weighed nothing and propped him up on his hip to carry him back to bed.
"Alright that's it, come here!" Tony flung the paper onto the counter and charged his son who squealed in return, he picked the boy up and threw him onto the couch, tickling his son until he was red in the face, worries pushed to the back of his mind.
"Alright, just swallow it like a pill. By the time we get to my house you should be feeling it." Flash seemed almost giddy. Did he already take something? His pupils didnt look blown or anything but he definatly wasnt acting normal. Maybe he was drunk?
So much for a new beginning.
Harley rolled his eyes, propping his heavy head into his palm, elbow resting up on the table. "I'm trying to make friends. I thought this kid would decide I wasn't worth being friends with if I couldn't go to his party."
"Whatever. Fuck, I'll be in my room." The boy rolled his eyes, storming off down the short hallway. His father began to trail behind him when he felt a tug on the back of his shirt causing him to jump.
"That's what Ned said too," Peter glared at the floor, "but Flash and his friends don't like me. I'm not sure if MJ likes me or not, honestly." He listed off, looking back out the window to watch as a girl trotted by with another car's order.
“Peter this is Harley. Harley, Peter.”
"Yeah I suppose you're right. Maybe I should get him in counseling after all." Steve rested his head on the cold faux-granite counter top.
"Wh-what do you mean?" He asked cautiously, trying to see what was in the bag but Flash had his hands wrapped around the contents, shielding them from view.
“Aside from the popular crowd you’ve become so fascinated with, have you met anyone interesting at school?”
The younger boy deflated a bit at that. Heck he just started talking to him a few minutes ago, "Yeah. Okay, goodnight, dad."
"Dad isnt like that though and him and Steve get along perfectly." Peter blushed, remembering a distant fight that happened between Steve and Tony when Steve half-jokingly threatened to smack Peter with a ruler for taking the cherry off of the mans brownie at Applebees. "You really think he'd hit his kid?"
"Then you'll be late. Cmon kid we have to leave now, itll be eight hours you'll be just fine." Peter rolled his eyes, stumbling out of the folded doors and picking his bag up off the handle. "You're cleaning your room when you get back home too,"
Harley rolled his eyes, “I’ll be nice if he’s not a dick to me first.”
Steve nodded, "Alright. Good talk. I dont think this needs to be discussed any further then. Finish up and go get ready for bed, you can either clean your room tonight or tomorrow morning but its gotta get cleaned up before we leave to Tony's house."
Steve dumped the garbage can down the toilet and rinsed it out before returning it to his kids room and closing the door, going out to meet his boyfriend of three years in the living room. He laid across the couch, his head in the shorter mans lap and his arms loosely hanging off of Tony's neck.
"Okay, let's go." Flash mumbled quietly, gently kicking Harleys hip.
Harley nodded, still not turning to face the other boy. He sat on the steps of the porch. Distantly he knew it was nearing ten degrees but he couldn't really feel it aside from a slight tingling on his wet skin. This was such a massive mistake he should've just said home. How fucking stupid did he have to be. This wasn't him, if his dad didnt have to be such a-
"Yeah I wanna get her some silkworms before she starts burmating, maybe I can get her some new substrate too so she can go down in a nice fresh bed." Peter nodded as his father stared back blankly - but with an encouraging smile gracing his features nonetheless. Tony has always been gifted at engineering, Peter had a knack for chemistry and biology from a young age. Tony completely blames Bruce's influence on swaying his childs specialty. Even though Tony might not completely understand his son's love for All-Things-Creepy he'll be damned if his son feels like he has no one supporting his passions.
The head of fluffy brown hair poked out from the overflowing closet, "If I cant find them in five minutes then-"
"Hey hot stuff," Tony gave him a worried smile, "What was that about?"
The base pounded in his eardrums but he couldn't really hear it, he swore he could feel his blood pumping throughout every inch of his body.
"I didnt even know Steve had a kid until like May. Dad said he had been living with his mom, Steve wasnt even involved up until now." He stated, "knowing my luck hes gonna be just like Flash."
"Night Underoos, sleep tight bug. Love you."
"Hey, Roger's right?" He held his olive toned hand out to Harleys chest.
-2:45 PM-
Steve smirked, pulling him in and rubbing his back, “Tell you what, i’ll think about it. Come on hop to it, I'll let you drive." Steve patted his sons back, grabbing his bag off the floor and leading him over to the door.
“I’ll take that as an ‘Of course dad, why would you even think I’d not be nice to your fiancé’s son dad, so thank you.” Steve deadpanned.
Peter rolled his eyes, "love you too. Sleep tight." He hung up before Tony had a chance to respond. He felt his eyes stinging for like the thousandth time that day. He rolled over to face his pet once again, "He doesnt even need me anymore does he?" Peter spoke into the silence of his room. Happy had gone home probably ten minutes ago and the loneliness was suffocating him. Maybe he should stay up tonight out of spite…
‘I don’t know. Now that you mention it he talked about this one super young looking kid in his class but I figured he was just being a dick.’
"Kid don't even start, I get it. I'd be floored if my dad pulled this crap. I think Tony probably just- just didnt realize how much it meant to you." The man was scripting out an angry text to the kids dad to send once they got home. He pulled into the lot and turned back to face the kid, "now what do you want? I'll let you get add ins if you promise not to tell your dad we stopped here."
-3:05 PM-
Harley felt himself trembling though he couldn't explain why if his life depended on it. "I'll see you Monday- I- I have to go." He said without turning back.
The girl to his right introduced herself and Harley found his palms sweating. 'Why is this always so stressful,'
"Shup up. I dont care just- fuck just dont talk." Harley tried not to whimper. He was so mad, so scared. Scmad? There was probably a better word for it but he couldnt exactly think straight at the moment. No pun intended.
“I can imagine,” Steve smiled to himself.
"Okay class, my name is Mr. Sage and I will be your American history teacher this year. Anyone in this school will tell you that I don't take any nonsense and I expect that to be respected." The older male took the time to make eye contact with each student individually, most definalty an intimidation tactic. Harley found himself squaring his shoulders and staring back defiantly. "Now, I want to go around the room for everyone to introduce themselves." The whole classroom groaned, causing the teacher to squawk in outrage of the ignoring of his expectations seconds before.
Harley bowed his head in acknowledgement, his mind silently racing.
Peter blushed, "Not everyone likes me, Ned. Besides what if my dad likes him more?"
"Yeah not gonna cut it kiddo. I need an explanation I think you owe me that much."
Steve smiled a little bit, knocking their foreheads together gently. "I'm not mad buddy. Just get some sleep."
Flash leaned in, pressing his lips to the other boys and closing his eyes. Harley tended uo upon impact but quickly melted into the action, running his hands up through the other boys hair, feeling the peach fuzz on their upper lips clash against eachother. The room pulsed around them, he couldn't hear the music anymore but he could feel every pump every base every lyric in his bones.
Tony smiled sadly, "You gotta remember hes going through a lot right now. Two moves, meeting his new brother in a couple days, a new school, suddenly being without his mom and sister," Tony listed off, rubbing Steve's shoulder. "Hell I'd probably be acting worse than him in his situation."
‘Lmfao I wasn’t expecting you to be up this late Boy-Wonder’ Steve rolled his eyes, ‘Y do u think he was being a dick tho?’
“No. Im not goin’.” The pubecent angry voice yelled back, “I told you, I aint smart enough to go to Midtown and there’s no way im given no one a chance to rub it in my face.”
"God as tempting as that sounds I already told the kid no. I dont want him to think he can get his way by throwing a temper tantrum." Steve sighed, planting a kiss on the shorter man's forehead.
“Peach-”
Steve sighed, collapsing into the seat next to him, "I'm sorry you had to see that, baby. That kid is driving me nuts."
"You think she will be going down soon? She didn't go to sleep until October last year?"
Peter grinned, "Cherry and nerds, please. It's a stupid rule anyway. I'm in highschool now, I don't see why I'm not allowed processed stuff still. Its embarrassing to take lunch to school. No one else does."
Harley buried his face in his father's neck. Seeking the comfort the weight and smell provided him.
"Now is not the time for a temper tantrum kid." Steve rubbed his temple, giving his son a pointed look.
"Hey that's good," Tony spoke at a normal volume now, "Listen bud, I'm real sorry I wasnt there today. I feel really bad. I promise you we can go do our gelato thing tomorrow okay? Just you and me."
"I think I met him today, he was in my first period. He looks mean." Peter muttered, "What if he doesn't like me?"
"Hey Petey. How was school?" His father whispered. Peter heard shuffling in the background before a door shutting.
"And did it work? Are you and this kid best buddies now?"
“You’re my Peachy Keener though, I can’t just not call you that. I’ve got 14 years of embarrassment to catch up on.” Steve replied unbothered, pulling into the driveway and parking the car before turning to look at his son. “Be nice okay? You don’t need to be happy, you’re allowed to feel stressed out but it’s not fair to project your feelings onto other people. Try to give him a chance, I know you love Tony even if you won’t admit it and Peter is just like Tony in all the good ways.”
"Alright let's get a head start then," Flash pulled a small baggie out of his sweatshirt pocket, making Harleys eyes widen.
The boy jolted, suddenly realizing he was soaking wet before remembering he was chest deep in a hot tub, making him burst into giggles. Flash grinned at him, poking the other boy in his ribs with his knuckles. "You trippin balls Harls?"
-7:40 AM-
"Peter I mean it in the best way possible when I say that I genuinly dont think you're capable of hating someone," Ned gave him a pointed look, "I'm sure you'll get along great and you four will be one big happy family. Everyone always loves you."
Tony laughed, pressing a quick kiss to the top of the kids head. "They dont open for another hour kiddo. Have you eaten lunch yet?"
"Well how about we watch a movie and then we can go? I figured we could stop by that pet store you like too and you could get something for your spider." Tony smiled down at his kid as his big brown eyes lit up.
"Kid, everyone likes you." Happy rolled his eyes.
"Jesus christ, kid." Happy stormed down the hallway, "it's your first day I highly doubt you'll have any free time to listen to music. Besides your dad has said at least a hundred times now that he doesnt like you sticking shit in your ears." Happy opened the 12 year olds door, scanning the strategic mess that was Tony Stark's son's bedroom.
Flash nodded remaining silent until he was able to pull up infront of the apartment complex. Harley got out silently, circling around the side of the building to slip back into his bedroom window effortlessly.
"What if there is no next time huh? You want me to risk being a loser because you want to pretend we're some big happy family? Pretend everything is okay?" Harley cried, his eyes starting to sting.
"Coffee and white rice for the punk, bacon and eggs for the bachelors." Tony announced affirmatively, only to be met with a swift jab in the ribs from sed second bachelor.
She leaned close, both elbows on the bar, her hand propping her chin up on her palm. Even though Nat couldn’t stand his husband, she was always down to hear any and all drama relating to the Tony and Steve show. “What about him?”
Back when Steve really made him happy.
Now, I like a good art party. I like artists. I am the child of artists. I am an artist. I still love scribbling that word, ARTIST – any time, any form, questionnaire, document, asks for my occupation. Fine, so I don’t paint the great issues of the day like Banksy, but I still paint good enough to have rich snobs sniff around my work. They call it “Thought provoking” which just means that they don’t truly understand it. I’m okay with that. My art is mine, not anyone else's. That’s why I’ve decided to start this journal, to help me catalog my emotions and make my art better. When I someday want to commit this day in art, I need this to remind me of how I felt when I attended this party.
He began running, screaming his name. Though the kitchen, where a kettle was burning, down to the basement, where the wine cellar stood empty, and then out the back door to the sea. He pounded across the slender wooden steps towards the private beach, peering over the clashing waves to see if he was painting the scenery, where he found him once, paint shiny in the sun and canvas wet with oil. He looked at him back then, and said nothing, turning back to the painting. Now, there was not even a soul on the beach. Tony screamed his name into the wind, fear gripping him tightly.
Nat refilled his drink, refilled her Draft beer. Her scarlet lipstick didn’t even come off her rim, and she swished the liquid in her mouth a little before swallowing it with a sour face. Her eyes got watery. It was exactly noon, twelve o’clock, and Tony wondered how long she’s been drinking. She was the first assistants he ever had (If you don’t count the ones his father hired for him) and ever since leaving Stark Industries, she’s found it pretty hard to hold a job that pays enough for the expensive California lifestyle. He’s tried helping her out here and there, but her Russian pride made it impossible for her to accept the help.
“Silver?” Natasha guessed, “Bronze? Aluminum? Bubblegum? Help me out, I’m floundering,”
to olives) because he’s gorgeous. Distractingly gorgeous, the kind of looks that make your eyes pinwheel, that make you want to just address the elephant – “You know you’re gorgeous, right?” – and move on with the conversation. I bet dudes hate him: He looks like the rich villain in an ‘80s comic – the one who bullies the sensitive misfit, the one who gets ridiculously defeated by the hero as the whole city cheers.
degree. Neither of them liked their presents. They both pretended like they’d use it, but never did.
“Good morning, boss,” she said, the bright blue light twinkling with every syllable, “The date is July 7th, 2019, and the weather will reach a high of 80 degrees. Stark Industries is down–,”
But no, I realize, as Bruce gushes on about his friend:
Happy anniversary, asshole.
” Tony supplied, “There’s no romantic presents for wood,”
Quiet. The street was always quiet. That’s a sign of a good neighborhood: when you could jog without fear of someone lurking in the shadows of the three floor homes. Though that day, it sounded extra quiet. No children out playing on the lawns, the clicks of dog paws on the sidewalk, nothing. As he neared his home, conscious of the noise of the car engine, Tony could see the orange tabby cat lazily moving through the rose bushes. Still in the walkway, twenty minutes after Dottie’s call. It was strange. Steve loved that cat, having him chipped and fat, never letting him outside. He thought it was absolutely hilarious naming the thing Goose, chuckling under his breath. It was a smart cat, but could be a great hide-and-seeker. Steve knew that despite the LoJack imbedded in his soft furry rolls, he’d never see that cat again if he ever got out. His nightmares were plagued with the cat walking out and getting swept up by the ocean, drifting straight into the maw of a hungry shark.
The man stepped into the circle of light, and it was the owner of their little bungalow. “I thought I told you two city boys to stay out of the woods. Now look at you. Lucky I got here in the nick of time. Hop in and let’s get you out of here before they come back.” Tony wasn’t sure if it was the relief of being rescued, or the relief he felt as Steve transformed back into himself and collapsed into his side for a brief moment before dragging Tony into the car. All the same, Tony had never felt more relieved in his life.
The welcome to Starkesboro sign declared it, "A nice place to live," but they could tell something was weird about the place from the very beginning. They rolled into town, intentionally driving the least conspicuously flashy car from Tony’s collection. You don’t head off for a quiet getaway to ask your one true love to marry you in a car that brings the paparazzi along for the ride. He didn’t want to attract the attention of the local Twitter-happy citizen armed with a Stark Phone either (damn him for making social media posting so seamless).
He called for help, then kicked himself as he realized he didn’t like the look of the help and the way they grabbed Steve. He could see Steve trying valiantly to keep control. Always the fighter his Steve, but his coordination was shot. Tony’s anger surged as he watched them begin to drag Steve away. ‘No, no, no, no!’ The panicked thought, ‘I have to do something,’ ran through his brain at a fraction of the speed it needed to, just as he started to black out.
Finally, Mike broke the silence. “As soon as I get you back to the bungalow, you’ll need to pack up, hit the road and get away from Starkesboro as fast as you can. I’ll wait until you go, and follow your car until you’re out of their territory. They won’t touch you with me around, or in my house, and once you are out of their territory they can’t follow you. But first, you must have some questions.”
“Just one!” they both chorused again, this time in disbelief.
The moment is lost. They’re guys, they can’t have something being fixed right underneath them and not watch and “hmm” and all that. Well, Steve might just watch and “hmm” a lot. Tony will most certainly butt in with ideas as if he knows better than the guy trying to fix his own water heater. But what can he say? He’s a mechanical genius, so he actually does know better.
Tony came to on the floor of a windowless, unfurnished room. His head hurts like heck, feels like he’s got a pretty good shiner too. But his wrists are blessedly unrestrained. Guess they assume the chain around his ankle is sufficient. They’d taken his clothes and put him in some sort of sweats; taken everything, wallet, keys, phone, the ring! Steve!
The wolves surrounded them, their eyes aglow in the dark of the forest. But they stood together, stood strong; Tony and Steve against the world. Except Steve, his tiny, scrappy, “I can do this all day” Steve, was a wolf! One minute, Steve’s small but unshakable form was standing at his back, looking frail and battered from captivity but still full of fight. (Once Steve is safe, these guys are going down!). The next minute, he was a huge, fiercely protective (yeah that hasn’t changed) wolf, in a somehow-familiar looking blue cowl.
Tony knew this because he was pretty much the only person that Steve would let turn him around when he’s hit up against his physical limitations. For the rest of the world, Steve digs his feet in, refusing help and insisting he’s fine. Just leave him alone and he’s got it, when really what he’s going to do is push through (way past the point he should) until he can disappear into some hidey-hole. Then he’ll stew in his own juices about the unfairness of being stuck with a heroic soul and a less than fully robust body.
The weather didn’t help the overwhelming aura of gloom around town either. Hey, it’s late winter in New England, what did he expect? But that pervasive sense of doom; this seemingly idyllic village (at least that’s what the Airbnb photos portrayed) owned that all on its own once you took a closer look.
And how dare someone take his Ferragamos! Not to mention that being barefoot is a definite disadvantage. But there’s no way he can run in shoes the size of that goon’s feet, so barefoot it is for now. He’ll keep his eyes out for a size 10 thug to mug for some shoes. He hopes Steve is better shod than he is, because he’ll never find a goon with feet as small as Steve’s. He sincerely hopes that Steve is still alive and well, with feet and all, shoes or no shoes.
“Should we wager on how pissed he’s going to get at you this year?” Nat asked, smirking at him with those taunting eyes.
Tony. Remember? We got lost in the rain in Chinatown trying to find that dim sum place, and it was supposed to be near the statue of Confucius but it turns out there are two statues of Confucius, and we ended up at that random Irish bar all soaking wet, and we slammed a few whiskeys, and you kissed me, and it was–”
(Then I catch myself. Awful. If he knew I was doing
Tony Stark.
Sometimes, instead of bashing his skull in, Tony imagined himself shaking the blonde and telling him, “
“I tried calling Jarvis, but it seems like there’s no one inside,” she said, her voice picking up a concerned twinge at the end.
The sun in Malibu was hot, though, which made it perfect for a drive down the PCH.
No, Steve and Nat were never going to be friends. They pretended like they could stomach the sight of the other, both far too territorial. Nat was used to being the alpha woman every time she walked into a room, Steve was use to defying every authoritative personality. The first time Tony introduced Nat to his new boyfriend, he remembered the redhead clenching her jaw every time the younger man opened his mouth. He understood. He couldn’t stand when Steve talked about things that should only really be a hobby, rather than a career.
By the time they reached the end of the day, to exchanging their presents – the traditional paper presents for the first year of marriage – Steve only spoke in clipped, one worded answers.
) He refills my drink without me having to ask, somehow ferreting out one last cup of the good stuff. He has claimed me, placed a flag in me:
One was practical and useful in their everyday life, while the other was useless and irrational.
The reasons were bogus. Dottie just needed to hear something else other than her own thoughts.
That one turned out to be the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, which Steve had told – he’d told him, he knew he’d told him many times – lightened his mood as a child. Something about learning lighting by sitting in front of it for hours and sketching out the ever changing light source off the bronze statue. Tony didn’t remember the conversations. His mind was constantly occupied with codes, blueprints, and ideas that he didn’t have enough space to remember what Steve did as a kid or what color combinations Tony wanted for his forty-fifth birthday.
His husband loved games. Mostly mind games which spilled into actual games. And there was nothing that Steve loved more than to set up the elaborate annual anniversary treasure hunts, each clue leading to the hiding place of the next clue until he reached the end and was finally rewarded with his gift. It was something he picked up from his parents, a childhood nostalgia for Sarah and Joseph Rogers’ anniversaries that really stuck with him. He would’ve found it amusing, but he didn’t grow up in Steve’s household, he grew up in the Stark household, and the last present he remembered his father giving his mother was a set of pearl earrings that he just left on her vanity, no gift wrapping or mention.
Maybe that turning in his stomach – like maggots writhing and squirming inside his guts – was why he felt the need to get out of his house as quick as possible before the walls started caving in. Looking back on it all now, he probably should’ve been braver when it came to communicating with Steve. More brazen. Strong enough so he didn’t have to endure the belittling tone that Steve always took on in front of him. Alas, he was weak.
The ugly violence of a decapitation, the sexual aura of young men … if you asked Tony, Caravaggio was the most despicable of artists and he’ll be damned if he ever let his husband paint anything close to what that man created. His Steven, the
Both of them have had their fair share of long nights, chasing their vision down to commit it into the real world. They may have their vast differences, yet those late nights of sitting on countertops and discussing their own interests with each other was one of the things they both cherished. The thought of their spouse actually giving a shit about their interest was the biggest turn on in the entire world. Opposites attract, they say. Tony hated that saying. Steve was a young liberal arts major when they met, working on his degree in Art History with a minor in museum management and always had paint smudged on his clothing whenever they went on dates. Tony, himself, had already started rebuilding the mess that Stark Industries was at the time with his own mechanical engineering PhD under his belt.
He makes a series of awful jokes. I catch three fourths of his movie references. Two thirds, maybe. (Note to self: Rent
“Steve?” she asked. She frowned as soon as the name was out of her mouth, a confirmation from his
Tony swung open the door of The Bar, stepped in, and breathed in the first breath of air since leaving the Tower. The smell of cigarettes and beer, the spice of the bourbons, the tang of stale beer nuts. There was only one customer at the bar, sitting by herself at the far, far, far end of the bar: an older woman named Angie who came in on Thursdays with a different romance novel in hand every time. He doesn’t know why she chose to spend her time here, but she only has a glass of Chardonnay during her stay at the bar and smiles awkwardly at them when they greet her.
The first thing Tony noticed about his husband was his head.
!), but I don’t yet know it’s
“Yes, my squalid little serf,” he said, and fluttered his hands royally.
“Please don’t eat anything in that area,” he says. It is
“Mr. Stark is currently in the kitchen cooking breakfast. Shall I inform him that you’re awake?”
I’m so crazy, stupid
Looking back on it now, Tony noticed a pattern of behavior that always played out whenever he and his husband were within reaching distance; he was obsessed with petting Steve’s hair. After sex or even just to lay about their unnecessarily large bed, they fit together with Steve’s head on Tony’s stomach, the billionaire’s hand smoothing down the unruly cowlick that was ever so persistent on his beloved’s head despite the money he spent on hair products. Steve would always doze off silently. A couple times, he’d startle awake the moment Tony’s fingers reached the root of those fine hairs and watch the other man with a look that begged for protection against the world beyond their little cocoon of safety. During those moments, Tony wondered what it was exactly that was running through his fair husband’s head.
“Seems lonely,”
It is a line that is only a little funny, but it already has the feel of an inside joke, one that will get funner with nostalgia repetition. I think:
He wished the public knew that – remembered the donated grants and the contributions to their family – before deciding he was a spouse-killer.
Gathering himself together enough to get out of bed, Tony walked toward the mirror over the dresser to inspect himself after last night. Truth be told, there’s lots of times that Tony has drank himself into a blackout, waking up in the bed or couch of someone he declared the night before to be his new business partner – back in the days of being a bachelor that came to an abrupt end when he met Steve – yet today felt off. He woke up in his bed, naked save for his boxer briefs and completely covered with violet bruises that littered his torso and face. Turning around only showed the discovery of four long scratches down one of his shoulder blades and the ominous looking red smear near his hip. Tony imagined what might have caused that smear, picturing his husband’s crimson paint stained hands moving down to touch him in the dead of night as a last resort to restore their dead sex life.
Dorothy “Dottie” Underwood lived across the street from him and Steve. Retired three years. Divorced for eight. She moved into the development years ago, when she first got married in the sixties as a young woman with her husband. Tony sensed that after spending four decades as a housewife for a rich lawyer, being divorced left her with way too much time on her hands. She acquired the house in the divorce, getting to live her days near the beach and surrounded by the luxuries of the one percent. Jarvis once told him he saw her children visit a few times – two girls and a boy – ushering their children into the old mid-century mansion as they slathered on weary smiles and fidgeted with their cashmere cardigans. The last time he recalled them coming, it was Thanksgiving and the sight of Dottie cooing in rapid fire Russian to her grandchildren made his heart grow fonder. She took a quick liking to Nat since the first time she came in with loose gray curls and pristine white gloves, asking her in a thick accent if the younger woman had seen her alcoholic ex-husband. Apparently, he called her in a drunken stupor asking for a ride back to his smaller home in Newport, and Dottie never could say no to her first love. Ever since then, she always found a reason to call.
“Steve!”
“We were lost in the rain ...?” he said with an open gap for his husband to fill in, drumming his fingers against the back of the couch he was leaning on.
July 7th. The date always crept up on Tony. He was constantly surrounded by the portraits of Steve and himself smiling at the camera, dressed in suits while holding champagne flutes and looking at each other as if they were the only people that existed in the universe – it seemed like Tony should be able to remember. They were constant reminders to himself and others that
Tony didn’t reply, so she took it upon herself to push more.
His glorious husband had a very odd fascination with Caravaggista art. He would never admit it, but Steve always found a was to sneak in a dash of bright red into his art and paintings that paralleled that of the great
“I know, I know,” the brunette pulled the covers away from his legs, moving to grab his cell phone from the nightstand. “Where’s Steve?”
“Just the two of us,” Tony confirmed, omitting his butler.
“So what?” Nat said, her face screwed up as she tried to reach the bottom of a mug with her sponge.
That was the problem with Steve’s treasure hunts: He never could figure out all the clues. Their first anniversary, back in New York, he went two for seven. That was his best year yet. The opening clue?
Tony hoped when they all wounded back in California, the two would let it drop – agree to disagree, free to be you and me. Neither did. Nat was funnier than Steve, though, so it was a mismatched battle. Steve was clever, stubborn, sarcastic. Steve could get him riled up, could make an excellent, barbed point, but Nat always made him laugh. It was dangerous the amount of time he laughed
But it turned out the cat knew it’s place. Goose saw him coming, meowing lazily at him as he sat down, staring him down similarly to how Steve would stare Tony down. As Tony pulled in to the drive, Dottie came out and stood on her porch, and he could feel the eyes of the old woman and cat on him as he picked Goose up.
It feels nice, after my recent series of closeted men looking to fuck something as close to a woman as possible, to be a territory. He has a great smile, a cat’s smile. He should cough out yellow Tweety Bird feathers, the way he smiles at me. He doesn’t ask what I do for a living, which is fine, which is a change. (I’m an artist, did I mention?) He talks to me in his educated California accent; he was born in Long Island and raised in Beverly Hills, the land of the wealthy and powerful, the inspirations for American royalty. He tells me his first car was a Mercedes, but it’s not show-boaty. And when I laugh (bratty, bratty New York guy who has never ventured to those big unwieldy states, those States Where Many Other People Live), he informs me that
At McMann’s, the bartender, a big, bearded bear-kid, saw them come in and grinned, poured them both whiskeys, and pushed over the next envelope with the clue inside.
And finally,
Friday beeped in confirmation, sitting for a moment before beeping once more as she shut down. Although not as good as a human, he has to admit that Friday really has been one of his most successful of inventions, despite what his husband said. Comparing Friday to Alexa or Siri was like comparing Gucci to Walmart. Friday was the better of the other two, a pinnacle of the future that he put into the world. Of course, whenever he brought that up to Steve, his dear husband’s eyes would gloss over to the point where he was anywhere but next to his spouse.
“Tony, breathe!”
“Yeah, I know, Steve. But it doesn’t mean I like it.” Tony sniffed, his head hanging low with shame. “I
“Tony...”
‘I nearly killed you’ goes unsaid but it hangs between them, fully understood by both.
“Tony...”
“Tell me, Tony.”
Steve didn’t want to push. He really didn’t. Tony could still be so prickly about things, especially when he thought Steve was babying him, and the last thing Steve wanted was for Tony to shut him out.
But he was willing to try. He would succeed, because no matter how hard it was, he refused to let it take from him the man in his arms. Steve had lost his whole world before and awoken seventy years too late to salvage it. He looked down tiredly at his new world, almost fully asleep now in his arms, and leaned down to press a tender kiss to Tony’s forehead.
Steve let him do this, knowing that Tony needed to do it himself. But when he settled back in against Steve, he tightened his hold on his partner, grateful when Tony relaxed against him. After the anger and the crying, Tony was more exhausted than he would have thought possible after one of those nightmares, and although he felt humiliated by his outburst it felt like a weight had been lifted. He was still furious with himself for letting Steve see this, but now Steve
Steve didn’t say a word. The tension had bled out of him now and all that remained was guilt and concern. Part of him wanted to apologise again, wanted to try to assure Tony that what had happened in Siberia was a mistake that would never be repeated. Another smaller, selfish part wanted to try and talk some sense into Tony, to force him to understand that the dreams weren’t real and would never be real again. He didn’t want to push, though. Trying to work through Tony’s lingering fear over what had happened was a task that had to be left to a time when Tony wasn’t already so vulnerable. Not to mention that if he interrupted, Tony might be embarrassed enough to get angry again, and that would do him no good.
special,” He pulled him in and kissed him, chaste and long. “That smootch right there was my special anniversary reenactment. Let’s go do it again at McMann’s,”
At the end of the bar, Angie neatly folded her magazine, unfolded her legs, and left everything but her Marc Jacobs purse on the bar and a wrinkled five dollar bill. They all exchanged tight-lipped, fake smiles as she walked out.
“Eh, what? Eh, bad? You look like shit,”
Tony shook his head.
Before Steve and Tony got serious, got engaged, got married, he would get glimpses of Nat’s thoughts in a sentence here or there.
“Friday?” Tony called into his room, rubbing eyes of the the traces of sleep still clinging onto him. The beeping of his intelligent personal assistant chimed loudly from the dresser in front of him, Friday’s voice coming through the speaker with a cheerfulness that only an AI could have at this hour.
“I got it!” Nat cheered, “Go home, fuck his brains out, then smack him with your dick and scream, ‘
It was seedy with a wooden countertop, water rings that are probably older than he was permanently etched into the dark wood, and uncomfortable dark green vinyl stools that have long since ripped to reveal the foam spilling out. If his mother was still alive, she’d stir clear of the bar with a handkerchief over her nose to block the smell. His father hated the place, has spent the last few years of his life trying to get Tony to sell the damn place, but it felt like something he still needed. A coke trip from his early twenties and a harty trust-fund later, The Bar was officially owned by one Anthony Edward Stark.
The brunette yawned into his hand, scratching his beard as he took in the empty side of their bed. The pillows and covers were put together as if no one slept on the side at all, precise and clean without a hint of life. The nightstand still had Steve’s empty glass, a few drops of water illuminated by the sun. Besides the glass, there wasn’t much evidence that Steve had come to bed last night – strange but not unusual.
likes her. Good.
Needless to say, for two people who lived in the same city – the same city twice: first New York, now California – they barely even knew each other. They flitted in and out of his life like well-timed stage actors, one going out the door as the other came in, and on the rare occasions when they both inhabited the same room, they seemed somewhat bemused at the situation.
His old secretary was at work behind the bar, her hair pulled up into a messy bun that threatened to spill out of the scrunchy as she scrubbed the dirty mugs in near-scolding water. Nat is slender and angular, attractive in the conventional way. Her features can belong to a model on the runway; sharp chin, high cheekbones, plump dusty lips, small frame. If she were in a period piece, the men would trip over themselves to paint her in an elegant headscarf and extravagant earrings that would punctuate her wealth. He could see her as the proper Dutch woman, the pinnacle of beauty and refinement. The only downside to her fair complexion was that her eyebrows were too fine to be noticed without makeup – not that the fiery shade of red of her locks helped distract from that minute flaw.
and I’d be obliged to cheer him on.)
His stomach rolled at the silence that followed, the thought of that morning making him almost nauseous as he took a swing of his drink. It went down smooth, but it still lodged in his throat and made him even thirstier.
It doesn’t take Steve more than five minutes to warm through, and here comes that giggle at the ridiculousness of it all, from the wolves, to the rain, to the cold water, to his funk. The warmth of shared laughter is followed by a kiss that says everything that Steve isn’t saying. Tony’s the one with acute logorrhea in this relationship. Steve, while a man of few words on the feelings front, is the master of body language. In that instant, Tony knows without a doubt that he is loved.
It was coming up on their first anniversary together, but who was Tony kidding, he’d known from the minute he met Steve that he was the one. How could he not fall head over heels for that skinny bundle of righteous fury who’d cornered him after a press conference and told him off for plotting to destroy his neighborhood. It was those eyes, deep as the ocean and sparkling with intensity. Oh Tony was a goner.
“There’s one thing I don’t understand.”
“I mean, werewolves, I’m a scientist but I’ve seen some pretty weird things in my life. I’ll just add this one to the list of ‘There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,’ stuff and move on, so long as you can tell me Steve is safe and he’ll be okay going forward.”
already, he’s
It didn’t help that although those doe-like eyes stared up at him lovingly, Tony thought of crushing that skull between his hands.
I met a boy. A great, gorgeous, sweet, cool-ass guy.
) covering one paint-cracked wall. Franz Ferdinand on the stereo: ‘Take Me Out.’
“Seriously,” Number 2 continues. (Ha!) “Back away from the tray. Rhodney has up to three other food items in his refrigerator. I could make you an olive with mustard. Just one olive, though.”
“I’m guessing – five years – he’s going to get
“What’s up with you?” she asked, “You look all twitchy,”. She flicked some suds at him, more water than soap in the mixture. The air conditioning flicked on over them, and they both sighed in relief at the feel of the cool air on the back of their necks in the middle of summer. The Bar wasn’t exactly the most upscale place to be at, a blemish in the middle of the luxurious dining establishments in Malibu. A stark contrast from the white tablecloths, soft spoken patrons, and the small proportions that only acted to serve as an excuse for being in a bar.
I have lost Bruce to his host-beau – they are having an intense discussion in a corner of the kitchen, the two of them hunching their shoulders, their faces toward each other, the shape of a heart. Good. I think about eating to give myself something to do besides standing in the center of the room, smiling like the new kid in the lunchroom. But almost everything is gone. Some potato-chip sharps sit in the bottom of a Giant Tupperware bowl. A supermarket deli tray full of hoary carrots and gnarled celery and a semeny dip sits untouched on a coffee table, cigarettes littered throughout like bonus vegetable sticks. I am doing my thing, my impulse thing: What if I leap from the theatre balcony right now? What if I tongue the homeless man across from me on the subway? What if I sit down on the floor of this party by myself and eat everything on that deli tray, including the cigarettes?
Steve was gone.
Dinner plans? A new art piece? Spousal adoration? You’d think after seven years together – two of dating, five married, if it mattered – Tony would be able to read the other man like a book, freely and easily without much thought further into what was presented. Alas, the older man could only guess as to what ran through that pretty, little, perfect head of Steven’s.
Tony waved the phone over, smiling into the phone as he answered.
here, one moment, please!” Nat covered the bottom of the olive green phone – a novelty dial phone their only source of communication from The Bar to the outside world – and mouthed: ‘Dottie.”
Silence.
We share a taxi home, the streetlights making dizzy shadows and the car speeding as if we’re being chased, it is one a.m. when we hit one of New York’s unexplained deadlocks twelve blocks from my apartment, so we slide out of the taxi into the cold, into the great What Next?  And Tony starts walking me home, his hand on the small of my back, our faces stunned by the chill. As we turn the corner, the local bakery is getting its powdered sugar delivered, funneled into the cellar by the barrelful as if it were cement, and we can see nothing but the shadows of the delivery men in the white, sweet cloud. The street is bellowing, and Tony pulls me close and smiles that smile again, and he takes a single lock of my hair between two fingers and pushed them out of my face, twisting twice, like he’s ringing a bell. His eyelashes are trimmed with powder, and before he leans in, he brushes the sugar from my lips so he can taste me.
This is the truth! Let me set the scene because it deserves a setting for posterity.
Dottie hovered from her spot on her property, holding her shawl close to her chest in the salty wind. He frowned, setting Goose down in the entrance and started going up the stairs, two at a time. He called his husband’s name.
“Right!” he said, faking a revelation, “You should have done a clue with Confucius, I would have gotten that,”
A clump of guys hovers near a card table where all the alcohol is set up, tipping more booze into their cups after every few sips, all too aware of how little is left to go around. I nudge in, aiming my plastic cup in the center like a busker, get a clatter of ice cubes and a splash of vodka from a sweet-faced guy wearing a Vincent Van Gogh T-shirt.
She was right.
“Bad day. He woke up early just to avoid having to kiss me good morning,”
(bum bum
“We should get some,” she said. She didn’t look up from her work. “I’m intrigued,”
The curtains shifted, opening up with a whine to unleash the sunshine into the bedroom. He was greeted by the ocean, shimmering in the sunlight while a flock of seagulls fly overhead, and he felt like he could finally breathe for the first time in ages. The openness of the ocean somehow felt comforting – a force of nature that was completely out of his control and that it was okay. He didn’t need to control the ocean, he already had control of everything else in his life. The ocean can remain unconquered.
Ever been in a spelling bee as a kid? That snowy second after the announcement of the word as you sift your brain to see if you can spell it? It was like that – the kind of blank panic that coursed through him at the mention of those clues.
His best friend, Nat. He’s taken to saying that so much that every time he see her, her name might as well be Besfriendnat. They met back when Nat was his secretary during the era when he got to command the company how he wanted without his husband breathing down his neck. In fact, Nat has been one of the few people that still remember what he was like before he got married to Steve. Nat was truly the only person that Tony could truly be himself with. He didn’t clarify, didn’t doubt, didn’t worry. Their bond hasn’t been the same for a while – he doesn’t tell her everything, not anymore, but he tells her more than anyone else, by far. He tried to tell her as much as he could. They’ve spent years together back to back, covering each other. It was second nature now. It never mattered to him that she was an employee of his. What could he say? She was just cool.
He had tried so hard not to let the stupid, nonsensical dreams bother him. He’d tried so hard to hide it from Steve, knowing how much it would hurt the super soldier. The last thing he wanted now was to hurt Steve.
he was safe with him. Dreams were bullshit. It was reality that mattered, and as long as he still felt safe in Steve’s arms then that was all that mattered.
“Please don’t shut me out, Tony” Steve whispered. “Talk to me?”
Steve was struck, not for the first time, by the notion that while he was glad Tony had forgiven him, he wasn’t sure he actually deserved it.
Steve was still internally debating whether or not to wake him, propped up on one elbow and sadly watching his partner, when Tony abruptly shot up, eyes wide open and gasping.
Steve just held him, let the man who he had hurt so deeply and loved so completely cry in his arms until the tears ran out and Tony slumped against him, exhausted and embarrassed. Only then did he speak. “I’ve got you, Tony. I’ve got you.”
Steve was almost as taken aback as Tony by his words. He hadn’t meant to be so blunt; he was just tired of knowing that Tony was lying to him and pretending that he didn’t know.
“You only pull away from me after the nightmares about
you won’t hurt me. But after that dream it’s …”
“I needed to know, Tony. Thank you for telling me.”
Despite all their progress, despite the fact that they
Tony was always better after he talked about the nightmares. It did him good to talk it out with Steve; he slept better in the days afterwards. Which meant that Tony had been letting himself suffer so that Steve wouldn’t get hurt.
“Yeah, well, I’m amending the agreement” Tony said, his tone so casual and flippant that Steve cringed.
“Yeah, it is.” Tony’s bottom lip trembled and he bit it stubbornly. “If you measure the end of things by when I stop having nightmares about them then nothing will ever be over. I still have dreams about Afghanistan, Steve, and that’s been over for a long time.”
He got them two or three times a week and they were worse than his usual nightmares. Steve was intimately familiar with his usual night terrors, having woken up on numerous occasions to his partner thrashing around in bed, still asleep and caught in whatever terror his mind had concocted for him that night. Steve was used to prodding him awake and then holding him while he calmed down, or patiently probing for details when Tony didn’t want to talk about it.
“They’re not stupid” Steve said quietly. “I hurt you, Tony. I nearly...”
Steve wasn’t completely sure, but in that moment he thought that the worst feeling in the universe might be knowing that you were the person your lover had nightmares about. He wasn’t sure what was worse, that Tony had nightmares about him or that he had tried so hard to protect Steve from them.
“No!” Steve interrupted, reaching out without meaning to and only just managing to stop himself from touching the other man. Instead he grabbed the edge of the blanket and carefully tucked it back over his lover’s body, keeping him in the bed. “Please, Tony, stay here.”
Steve reached out and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, but he pulled it back in dismay when Tony flinched violently.
“It’s not done if you’re having nightmares about it.”
Sudden realisation hit Steve hard and he closed his eyes, pained as an obvious truth dawned on him. It was Tony’s insistence that he didn’t want to know that cemented the truth in Steve’s mind, but really, he should have seen it earlier. It was fairly obvious. Tony had been so good at being honest about the nightmares - far better than either of them had expected, better than Steve. There was only one thing he’d not tell Steve about.
“For God’s sake, Steve, it was Afghanistan. Water, electric shocks, all that stuff.”
“This isn’t a case of you being all calm and collected and me still being scared, you get that? I know you’re not going to kill me. I know it’s just a dream, that’s why I didn’t want to tell you. Now you’re gonna be all guilty and sulking and it won’t made a damn difference.”
Steve moved over to wrap his arms around his lover from behind, resting his forehead against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony was taken aback by the volume of Steve’s voice and he paused, and it was only when he paused that he realised he was pretty much sobbing. His cheeks were wet and his chin tickled as tears dropped onto his shirt. His lips were trembling and his face was heated, and his eyes must have looked frantic.
Tony didn’t reply. He shut his eyes tight and focused on breathing in and out, and Steve was quiet as he waited for his suffering partner to calm himself enough to prevent a panic attack. These breathing techniques were something they’d learned together, and they worked best when the room was silent. They also worked best when Steve held Tony in his arms but after the way he’d flinched the super soldier was reluctant to touch him again, afraid of making it worse.
sense because it was bust by the point already and it wouldn’t kill me if it was anyway and I...”
worked through it, Siberia was the monster in the closet of their relationship, the thing that had threatened to tear them apart for good since the moment they had starting speaking again after it happened. It had taken a lot of work to get past it enough to be together, and now Steve had a renewed understanding of how much work still had to be done.
The ‘even from me’ went unsaid but heard by both, and Tony tightened his arm around Steve’s waist in acceptance.
The truth pushed Steve into silence, for long enough that Tony looked at him for the first time since he’d started speaking. “Steve?”
Steve pulled him into his arms, shifting automatically to lie back against the headboard with Tony curled at his side, head nestled against Steve’s collarbone. Tony could have fought but he didn’t see the point any more.
“‘This is what should have happened. This is what you deserved. One day, I’ll finish the job.’ That’s what you say. And then you walk straight through me and leave with Barnes, and I’m still
“Tony, I ...”
“I promise you, I’m glad you told me. And I promise I’ll take care of you, Tony. We can talk tomorrow. For now, please, get some more sleep.”
“Workshop. Or the bar. I haven’t decided.”
“Tony. Whatever it is, it isn’t worth that. I promise.”
Steve reached out and very carefully put one hand on the blanket over Tony’s knee, watching as his lover’s breath caught slightly although he didn’t pull away this time. Tony’s eyes were cast down and Steve didn’t push him to make eye contact as he spoke.
Usually he would let it go because if he was doing it then he had a good reason, but not now. Steve couldn’t let it go just now.
“You don’t have to be over it, Tony.”
“Yeah, okay. You’re right. But that’s not what I meant.”
But he didn’t know what else to do, and now he was laying in bed watching his lover’s eyelids flutter in distress, his breath hitching as he twisted in the sheets, and he had no idea how to help him. How could he help if he didn’t know what the dreams were even about and Tony refused to stay in bed after he’d had one of these nightmares?
Steve closed his eyes as those words jammed the guilt even further into his chest. “Don’t. Please. You have
"I can ask?" Harleg rubbed the back of his neck, "here give me your number, I'll text you tonight when I find out." He whipped his phone out, handing it over to Flash. The bottom left of the screen was shattered, it being a few years past its prime.
"Dad please, I promise I'll be home early tomorrow! I'm really wanting to make friends here." The blond glared defiantly at his father, his tone nearing whiney.
"Dad!" Peter leapt into his father's arms, Tony hugged his boy closely as he hung on like a koala bear. "I missed you so so much! Can we go get gelato now?"
"God that must be it," Steve groaned, clamping his eyes shut in annoyance. "I've been trying to figure out where the little shit found liquor. He must've snuck out after we went to bed."
"I do but his son just moved in with him. Him I haven't met before. With Steve moving in with us next month I'm sure hes probably bringing his own kid too. I'll just have to accept that I'll never see my dad again." He sighed dramatically.
Hell he hadnt even met the guy until his mom got sick - he doesnt owe him jack.
Peter sighed, flopping back onto his bed, turning his head ever so slightly to gaze at his bed side table - or more specifically at the martinique pinktoe climbing up a piece of cork bark in her little vivarium.
"Yeah Happy made waffles and watermelon with syrup." Peter got down, hugging himself close to dads side.
-5:45 PM-
"Dude we are like twenty miles from your house, let me drive you. Please, I cant let you walk home this late." Flash begged, his voice still tinged in panic.
"Yes. I promise nothing happened. I'm just not hungry." The boy snapped, glaring past his reflection into the trees whizzing by.
Has it really only been 5 months? It feels a lot longer than that. I’m sorry for the incredibly spaced out update, I started my first year at college and high key want to kill myself but it’s COOL it’s FINE. Anyway I’d love feedback and I’m hoping to update more frequently of course. Again, I’m sorry and I appreciate the comments that have been left during my absence!
"I dunno Steve. On one hand the kid is fourteen, hes probably having trouble coping with everything. Hell I mean the kid lost his mom and his sister, found out he had a father, he moved half way across the country and hes about to move in with two other strangers on top of it? I'd probably drink too, hell I started doing a lot worse for a lot less before Peter came around." Steve glared up at him, Tony quirked an eyebrow in response, "On the other hand though he needs to know that there will be rules here. Especially since hes going to be seen by the media as my child - we dont need another little party animal being associated with the Stark name."
“I don’t know what to say.”
Before it had been simple friendship, but they built it into something more. Steve had made the first move and Tony hadn’t hesitated, and they’d been together ever since. They were, mostly, happy together. And they had agreed to be open and honest with each other, promising that they would never let lies or secrets ruin their relationship the way they had almost ruined their friendship.
