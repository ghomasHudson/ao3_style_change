John reaches into his inner jacket pocket and retrieves a small crucifix, golden with a smooth black stone in the centre. He hands it to Sherlock. “I want you to keep this.”
An unexpected question, Sherlock has to admit. Yes, he’s curious. Curious about the unsaid words, written but unread and therefore unreal. “You revealed its contents during your first visit.” He’s fibbing, and they both know it.
Greg glances at Sherlock, trying to gauge whether the man is hurt by John’s blatant lack of confidence in Sherlock’s diplomatic skills. But all he sees is Sherlock trying to supress a smile while adding, “I am certainly not investing any intellectual work on this inanity. Might as well do as John suggests.”
Regret clenches around Sherlock’s heart in a sudden, fierce grip. How could he have been so callous with his friend? His only friend. Sherlock was not lying to get John on his side again, even if John might have thought so – Sherlock has truly never cared for another human being as he does for him.
When he returns to his room, he’s surprised to see Sherlock half-lying on the bed, nose buried in John’s pillow but naked feet still on the floor. John helps him gently to sit up, makes him take the pills and the glass of water. He takes in his friend’s misery, a downturned mouth, shallow breathing, rigidity fighting exhaustion. Before he thinks too much about it, he eases Sherlock back down on the mattress, walks around the bed and goes in under the duvet. “Try to rest a bit for now. We’ll go to the surgery as soon as possible, yeah?”
John’s keen eye catches however a sheen of perspiration that glues Sherlock’s curls to his forehead. A grimace of half-contained panic. And the stiffness of someone moving not without considerable pain.
“I wasn’t.” It’s more of a sob than a statement. “I wasn’t going to. God, Sherlock. No. God, I’m so sorry.” John is rooted on the spot, spooked like a frightened animal.
‘Who could do this’ is a new one, though. Especially in that tone, as if Sherlock cannot quite believe mankind would stoop as low as… well, whatever he was reading.
isn’t he allowed to be annoyed at snarky remarks directed to the things he loves doing? He performed some of those analyses himself, let a company do the more complex ones, and he truly enjoyed discovering what he could and could not do with his newfound patch of land.
Sherlock’s body is muscular and warm under John’s hand, in contrast with his lithe movements and cool elegance. He doesn’t look away from John, expression soft and a gentle smile blooming on his plush lips, a curl bouncing endearingly on his forehead. John can’t help wondering exactly how he ended up having such a marvel in his arms, as the music drones on:
She stops and dithers briefly in front of the black door, the golden ‘221B’ sign topped with tiny mounds of snow, and wonders whether she should use the brass knocker or the doorbell. She decides for the latter. A few moments pass before the faint creaking of old wooden stairs gives way to soft thumping on the hallway.
“Of course, you are allowed to run. But I’ll have to run with you.” John smiles at Sherlock. The morning sun breaches through the few leaves still clinging to the maple trees that line the path, and John is mesmerised by how the sun rays dance on Sherlock’s curls. The air is crisp and cold, leaving no doubt about the season they are in, but for a moment, Sherlock’s face is flushed like it had been kissed by a warm summer breeze, and John feels unseasonably warm in his clothes.
John glances around the room, weary and dispirited, hands clasped between his knees. The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is but a few years old and hosts Glasgow’s major trauma centre, and the ICU waiting area, split into small rooms by sliding doors, is crisp and modern. It’s all wrapped in soft pastel hues, some modern art hanging on the walls, designed to induce tranquillity; a place for family members to spend time during the day, talk with the doctor on duty, have some coffee or tea from the machine just outside the door. John is sitting on a comfortable sofa, paired with soft armchairs and a sleek coffee table.
Distressed, he watches as Richard slips into the room. Sherlock throws a defiant look at John and follows Richard; the door closes behind them. John reaches for the handle but it’s too late: the door is locked. He raises a fist to knock but his arm freezes halfway.
everything can be measured.” Sherlock plops himself down in his armchair facing John, a look of determination on his face.
will to have any sort of exchange with him. He ponders ignoring the sleek black car that is tailing him since he got out of Sainsbury’s, but he knows that it will only make Mycroft use more forceful ways to ‘invite’ him for a little chat.
Sherlock, walking around in frantic circles in the living-room, flaps a dismissive hand. “Not going back to that place.” His voice is strained, breath shaky with the obvious discomfort he’s in. He’s been half growling, half panting in pain for most of the evening and while John is sympathetic, his own patience is running thin.
Sherlock sighs, removes his suit jacket, tosses it carelessly over the sofa, and crosses the living-room to his music stand to pick up his beloved violin. He likes what he does. He’s always been musically inclined: he sings well enough and writes his own songs. He is a proper musical genius, unlike the meteoric one-hit-wonders that still plague the musical scene, bubblegum products of big record labels, to be chewed and spat out once the fruity flavour dissolves into rubber. Those last as long as their IQ – that is to say, not very long at all. Sherlock knows his superior intellect keeps him in business. Years ago, he created an algorithm that calculates the perfect balance of chord progression, catchy chorus, and tonality in order to write pop songs that have a probability exceeding ninety-six point three percent of success, measured by its ability to top official charts or by the number of hits on his YouTube channel.
They do not speak of the night they spent together. It’s fine, John thinks. It had been platonic comforting between friends. Nothing inappropriate about it.
“You have high moral standards and prefer to protect people in influential positions. I, however, am not royalty or a minister or a president. What made you take this job?”
John makes a move to get up from his chair. “Maybe I’ll just go and see if Mrs Hudson has some biscuits–”
A week passes. Then another. Sherlock throws away half of the pile of newspapers, deposits new ones on it, never reaches the bottom. The spring honey has been harvested, and the meadows around his property are in full bloom. His vegetable patch is producing more than he can eat, and Sherlock researches canning procedures. There is something ironic at how the food to be canned needs to be brought to the brink of destruction by subjecting it to intense heat for it to then last safely preserved and free from harm.
Mycroft won’t face him. His eyes are focused somewhere on the floor and he just shakes his head minutely. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, trying to find words. To say that Sherlock is worried would be an understatement – Mycroft has always been the sensible brother, the one who knows what to say when the going gets tough, the one who can find solutions to impossible problems. But he now seems lost for words, adrift in some sort of twisted regret that is painted all over his face. A heavy weight pools inside Sherlock, for he cannot believe Mycroft would hurt him – yet, his behaviour speaks of guilt.
“I was never mad at you, Victor. I just– I couldn’t– you didn’t deserve– you deserved– you deserved more.”
He feels like a fish out of water, flayed open like this in public by a man he literally just met. Not even Greg had known this much about his life after MI5.
John looked down at the assortment of products on the slab. He had brought some of his finest: realistic dildos with well-defined veins, remote-controlled vibrators, rabbit vibrators with g-spot stimulation, a brand-new model of clit stimulator controlled by a downloadable app for both Android and iPhone. He held a very purple dildo in his left hand and looked up again. “Um, well. Yes. These are dildos and vibrators. But I do have other products with me, er, anal plugs and beads, nipple massagers–”
In the past, such a request would have been met with bristling from John, which would have been returned with mockery from Sherlock about John’s ridiculous moral compass on drug usage, which would have made John angry and stomp off to his bedroom. But that was in the past. Now, the way Sherlock tries and fails to make a lark about the morphine is more telling of his friend’s actual mental and physical state than his real wish to take Class A drugs. Sherlock is in obvious pain but his aversion to healthcare institutions means John must tread carefully if he’s to convince Sherlock to do something about his situation.
“Well, that’s part of it, yes,” John replies cautiously, “but the amount of love, or how deep it is can’t really be quantified like that.”
Mycroft appears behind Greg as if out of thin air. “John ordered me to cancel Sherlock’s appointments for the week. Declared them too risky as he’d have to go out in the midst of the
“A one-night stand.” The words are enunciated as if they were poisonous and Sherlock would want to deposit them carefully out of anyone’s reach.
John is relieved someone cares about an intruder on the grounds. But it’s too close to the house – too close. “By Mr Greg Lestrade. Miss…”
Sherlock exhales a long-suffering sigh; the eye-roll is practically audible. He does rise from the armchair though, and turns to Greg and John, right hand swiftly buttoning up his suit jacket.
Sherlock hands the papers back to the assistant and continues without letting John reply, “There’s no need for that. I suppose the extra bodyguard shall be useful when I go out. You work it out with Irene – I want discretion, not two thugs covering me everywhere I go. I need to
Finally, Sherlock speaks. “I was triaged soon after registering. A nurse told me to lie down on a gurney and wait. So, I waited, although I couldn’t well lie still, you know how I was…” John gives him a brief squeeze on his forearm –
And there, right at the end, the hitherto unspoken words that now land without a chance of being taken back:
Sherlock looks thoroughly unimpressed by John’s reaction. “Left the road free for you to reconnect with that harpy that accompanied him. Who
the demanding one. I was just going to explain that the fact your melanocytes are losing capacity to replenish melanin is mostly controlled by genetics. Fascinating stuff, really, although there is some uncertainty about the exact mechanism, a gene was recently identified that is key to the process—”
,” Sherlock spits derisively, and starts pacing. He steeples his hands, fingertips touching his lower lip as he mutters, still pacing, “Obvious, so obvious, why did I not see it before, I
John wavers for an instant with the tray in his hands, then clears his throat and sets the tray down on a small coffee table. “Tea,” he adds nervously, and kicks himself for stating the obvious. A couple of floor lamps light up the room with a subdued glow; all of Sherlock’s sharp features soften up in the dim lighting. Sherlock smiles and sits on an armchair, reaching for a cup and the sugar bowl; John sits opposite to him on the sofa.
And all the sudden, Sherlock realises what he has conveniently ignored for a long time. Staring into John’s watery, blue eyes, he allows himself to read what John is saying without words: that Sherlock will always be John’s priority, his first choice, the one person he will sacrifice everything for, including a future with Mary.
“Good-day, Dr Watson.” Sherlock does not turn around as he crosses the living-room and exits the flat, slamming the door. John realises Sherlock went barefoot, his shoes and socks still strewn around the room.
“There’s an extra set of wires coming from the motor that I can’t see what they could possibly be for.” He pokes a bit longer at the motor. “Maybe it’s from the battery, it should be disconnected when winterising an outboard engine.” After a few more pokes, however, he freezes. “Oh.”
“Yes. But it’s not…money or anything tangible he wants. Instead, he asks for…information. Just…snippets.”
Because Sherlock, winner of several World Barista Championships, genius creator of sublime signature beverages, is also a bit of an arse.
Sherlock half turns and shouts to make himself heard above the loud music, “I will not let some maniac command my life!” He continues to run downstairs; John scrambles after him but Sherlock is agile and the staircase is filled with people. The crowd on the dance floor is expectant, as the background music had faded some minutes before forewarning of tonight’s real show. The club’s MC spots Sherlock approaching the stage and hurries up to the microphone:
“I still do. But I did enjoy just… spending time with you.” Sherlock flicks his eyes up to John’s and down again and fiddles with the spring roll to have something to do with his hands.
It is Sherlock who steps forward now. Careful, slow. Until they are toe-to-toe. He swallows down his fear. “We cannot postpone this conversation.”
– his attention had not been on his older brother, who was dedicated to helping Sherlock on his way to stardom.
Sherlock snaps his head around in surprise. Molly is always affable, and even when she is infuriated by Sherlock’s antics she usually damps down her annoyance to a yielding tone.
John gives him a sharp look of warning as Ellie freezes on the spot. She nods and resumes picking up her things in silence.
I put on my most genuine smile. It still manages to fool her even after we all let our façades fall.
They lie down for a long time, minutes stretching into the wee hours of the night, and Sherlock is lulled into a deep slumber by the clatter of rain on the roof and the steady beat of John’s heart.
. Quite suddenly, John is receiving answers to questions he asked himself a long time ago, and to questions he never dared asking at all.
John sighs and speaks louder and closer to the microphone, “Alexander Graham Bell to see Mr Holmes.”
“Alright, alright, I’m awake, Christ!” John jumps off the armchair and looks around, trying to find the threat. “What happened?”
“Oh, hello, detective inspector, do come in. Dreadful weather tonight, isn’t it?” Mrs Hudson steps aside to let an apologetic (and drenched to the bone) Greg Lestrade come in the hallway. She closes the door on the downpour outside, and the loud splashing of fat droplets on the pavement muffles quickly down to white noise.
Yet, for John, Sherlock is astonishingly ready to do it all over again. John is holding the shards of Sherlock’s existence in his hands and slowly gluing them all together again, perhaps without having the slightest idea he is doing so.
Intense, cramping unilateral back pain that makes the patient restless… “Sherlock, does it burn when you pee?”
, more than just the fact that he had made a very clear sexual advance on Sherlock. But he can’t put his finger on what it is and this irritates him to no end. His gaze skitters the room in search of John and finds him out on the balcony, his back turned to the room, hands clasping the railing and head bowed down. Uncharacteristic of him to let his guard down like this. Or then again, perhaps he has just given up on Sherlock. On them.
.” Greg calls her so seldom ‘Sally’, so this startles her. Greg takes a deep breath and decides to tackle the subject head on. “I’ve noticed you act different when Sherlock is around.” She huffs and rolls her eyes, but Greg sees this for what it is: avoidance. “No, listen: you used to be as acidic to him as he was with you, but since his return it’s been different.”
His initial methodical approach to gardening and beekeeping gave way to a more amorphous relationship with the surrounding nature. Sherlock has come to realise a lot of his work is more about feeling what is right to do than following a strict schedule and predefined rules. He’s had to accept a new vulnerability to do so, bring out something from within himself he had tried to bury a long time ago, which has had its mixed consequences. Here is a tomato he planted while recalling a vicious kick on his ribs. There, a patch of herbs he sorted while
The bright sunny morning turns into a stormy afternoon, not unlike the one that had welcomed John weeks ago. Rosie is cranky and refuses to take her post-lunch nap, full tantrum mode on until she dozes off due to sheer exhaustion. They scrap plans to drive down to Brighton lest the driveway floods. The air is warm and sticky, and the skies threaten to unleash a deluge. When they finally do, the power fails. The computer is useless, the Wi-Fi non-existent, the books have all been read, John’s mood sours, Sherlock’s mood positively
“Oh.” John comes around the table and sets a gentle hand on his forearm. “Right, that could be due to a number of reasons… Are you feverish? Any pain? How deep was the colour when you peed? Any clots?”
Sherlock hums in agreement. “I admit to not having seen the need for you before, but now, I…I’m glad you’re here, John Watson. Thank you.”
“You’re technically not my employer so I’d rather have my contract terminated by Sherlock himself,” John replies while taking a longer look at the keys. “By the way, I hope those aren’t house keys you’ve just left lying around.”
That same day, John moves into a small detached flat behind the mansion. The two-room flat comes with a basic kitchenette and a cosy bedroom; French doors face the inner patio and provide natural light to the living-room. It is not a very private location: John quickly assesses that, due to the French doors, what happens in his living-room will be visible from several angles, including from Sherlock’s flat and from Mycroft’s place, which is just on the other side of the patio. On the other hand, this means he can also survey the adjacent area – not much happening on the inner patio will escape his keen eye.
“Come now, John,” Mycroft says as he steps into John’s personal space. “First you engage in some sort of a liaison, then you seem to hate each other’s guts and now you are making eyes at each other again. Might I expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” His delivery is derisive even if he’s aiming for humour.
Irene shakes her head. “I wasn’t sure then but think about it. He was genuinely horrified when we confronted him with some of the less savoury material.”
“I called to check on Rosie before dinner; she’ll be fine until tomorrow. You think the road will be clear by then?”
Sherlock picks up his violin but instead of lifting the bow to strings, he sets the bow down and perches on the window sill. He cradles his violin and plucks a string, repeats the gesture absentmindedly, a soothing, hypnotic effect. As he distractedly surveys the patio, his eyes rest on John’s flat, lit against the premature darkness of the winter evening.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow at the scene before him: Sherlock looms at his doorstep, half-dried blood caked under his nose and staining his white shirt.
John divests himself from his jacket, clumsy due to Sherlock’s slumped body at his side, and throws it around the exhausted man. Sherlock is curled onto John, his hands in a fierce grip on John’s arm, eyes firmly closed. Despite the tense posture, John feels him relaxing bit by bit as the car rolls smoothly out of central London and towards East Dulwich. John holds Sherlock tightly for the entire trip, feels his heartbeat coming down to resting levels, his breathing evening out. Sherlock shifts with a sigh and nudges his nose into John’s neck. The gesture is so intimate it sends a shiver down John’s spine, but he tries to be as still as possible, be Sherlock’s point of reassurance, the harbour welcoming him back after the stormy sea.
He holds the case straight and opens it again, brushes his fingers over the two rings lying on the satin lining. Palladium, a soft brushed finish, a small diamond well-embedded to not catch on gloves and such.
. John takes a moment to ponder how to explain this to the man. Surely they can attempt to keep the conversation on the scientific side, without John showing his hand? “Well, despite you dismissing emotions, they are not quantifiable by some spectrometer. How would you measure love?”
“Had to return to England because of politics and couldn’t really use the military rank to do something useful. Decided to start over with something easy. Met Richard and the rest is history. He has a use for someone with my skills.”
It had been a busy day: between tweaking the choreography for his next music video and attending to all sorts of dull administrative matters that, for some unfathomable reason, could not be delegated to Mycroft, he hardly had had a moment to breathe. Add Greg’s constant nagging about how his security should be reinforced and the buzz from the recent Grammy nominations, Sherlock is as good as overwhelmed with the world’s input on how he should shape his career and live his life. And the sheer amount of
.” Sherlock increases his stride towards the exit, forcing John into a semi-jog to keep up. He manages to hold Sherlock’s arm hard enough to halt him. Sherlock spins around his heel to glare at John. “Let me
They both stiffen and relax in unison as mutual surprise gives way to acceptance. The kiss is brief and chaste, but long enough to leave intent and taste reciprocation.
Greg and Victor exchange another guilty glance, and it’s Victor who answers this time, “There weren't any police involved in this. The maid removed the cover as soon as I found the mess and washed it straight away. It was a one time incident; we didn’t think much of it.”
“Hello there, little one. Not much of a guard dog, though, are you?” He’s gentle with the terrier, who tries to lick his face, hands, and whatever he can reach.
John’s hands are warm and golden against Sherlock’s skin, skimming up and down his chest, reading invisible braille in his chest hair, his nipples, his ribs. Now that they are naked, the initial urgency melts down, the moment turning tender and more impossibly intimate.
is a bit of a misnomer. In front of him stands an impressive two-storey manor, built in an eclectic style but with a distinct Victorian flair. The ground floor is covered in French doors and a terrace runs along the top floor. Vines of dull green ivy snake upwards over brown bricks on most of the façade, blending the house in with its surroundings. The bleary sun staves off any dreariness such an austere building would otherwise give off. As John leaves the car, he takes in the scenery around the house: the front yard sports an impeccable garden with a green lawn and scattered flower beds, impossibly lively this close to wintertime. There’s a blend of aromas of freshly mowed grass and blooming flowers. Tall trees cushion the house all the way out to the outer wall, which is hardly visible through the tree trunks and bushes. The whole impression is of a cocooned castle, tasteful yet imposing.
John nudges Sherlock with an elbow. “Having fun, after all?” A light-hearted tease that prompts an easy smile on his companion.
Perhaps it’s his imagination running wild, but he’s sure Sherlock is singing to him. John steps out onto the wide balcony and makes a grand show of unnecessarily checking the stability of the railings. Not a bad idea, he tells himself: they are ten floors up, and a fall would be fatal.
My stupid mouth moves but does not make a sound; my stupid eyes fill with futile moisture. I reach for the bundle with shaking hands (why are they shaking?) and bury my nose in. I inhale deeply and close my eyes.
John jumps off the sofa and grips Sherlock’s arm to stop him from finding another missile, but Sherlock twists to release himself from John’s grasp and turns around to face him. “How am I
“Maybe, uh, maybe you should tell her that you’re. You know. Gay?” John tries to wrap his mind around this sudden coming out. Is Sherlock comfortable about talking about himself like this? Did John go a step too far?
John can’t help detecting something off in Mycroft’s tone. It would be easy to assume jealousy, and yet…
She shrugs. “I suppose it just doesn’t really tickle me any longer to exchange barbs with him. He doesn’t really acknowledge my presence anyway.”
“Maybe he didn’t hear your texts, with the hammering and all that,” Mrs Hudson interrupts hurriedly.
Yet, he cannot avoid the acid in his words: “He’s all yours, brother dear. He wants nothing more from me than quick entertainment and a paycheck.”
I’m posting this from my iPad - apologies if some formatting is wonky, I’ll fix eventual issues when I get access to my computer again.
Days pass. John gets to know the staff better: Mrs Hudson turns out to be more than just a housekeeper, with her motherly manners and gentle positivity; Molly, the driver, is timid but competent, and most importantly, discreet; Irene seems to hate him, which John is fine with as the feeling is mutual; and Victor is…well, a nuisance. As Sherlock’s publicist, Victor manages Sherlock’s public agenda, deciding when and where Sherlock is going to meet who. The problem is, Victor tends to completely ignore the very specific instructions John gives him in advance of all his and Sherlock’s trips. Every. Bloody. Time. Because of this, John often has to scramble for a last-minute security plan.
“Why would you? I was more trouble than you ever signed up for. You know this– you know this to be true.” Sherlock finds himself swallowing a sob. Why is mind-John now an expression of his own wishful thinking? That was not his role; his role was to listen to Sherlock while he rambled and deduced; to be his conductor of light.
It is uncharacteristic of him to not notice details but later he will think, in hindsight, that he was too distracted. That’s why he doesn’t hear the uninvited guest behind him and is fully taken by surprise when is garroted with some sort of a rope. The attacker is shorter than him but strong and agile.
“I brought these for you.” Oh, John. He presents me with a lovely bouquet of carefully arranged flowers, some of which I cannot even identify. “It took me a while to get this because I wanted exotic flowers.” He blushes.
Sherlock reads again and again, burns the words into the recesses of his mind, into the ventricular walls of his heart, lets them run from aorta to capillaries, weaves them into the fabric of his existence.
John shakes his head to disperse his thoughts and not work himself into a panic attack or worse. He knows he can only blame himself for not having any of those things, and he cannot afford to be scatterbrained when Sherlock’s life is in his hands. He’s found his way to a spiral staircase that swirls down next to a half-lit stage; in front of it, a huge crowd sprawls out on the dance floor, undulating to the industrial beat as a living, organic beast. There must be at least a hundred people just down there, John calculates; there’s also an appreciable amount of dwellers at the long bar in the back, drinks being poured and consumed like there’s no tomorrow.
Greg chuckles. “Ha, just the one, and it’s work enough, I tell ya. I know, it’s not what you expected, I can see it on your face. I had a stint as a cop after leaving the service – that’s when I met Sherlock. He…wasn’t in a very good place then, but we became friends. Or, well, close enough. I started helping him out with the logistics of his budding career back then, one thing led to another and before I knew it I was doing proper management. The pay’s better,” Greg adds with a wink. “But fame has brought him some unwanted attention–”
John hesitates at the doorway, split between the need to get out and leave this moment behind and the urge to turn around and offer platitudes to Sherlock. He takes a moment too long; Sherlock shoves past him, his shirt haphazardly thrown unbuttoned over his shoulders, hands zipping up his trousers.
John opens the door wider and lets Greg in the flat. Greg takes off his coat – the late autumn morning is sunny but chilly. He hangs the coat next to the door and takes an appreciative look around. John’s flat is small but tidy, almost minimalistic, the hallmark of a man with ingrained military habits. The kitchen shares an open plan with the living-room, running along one wall.
“How many? How many threats have there been? What type, what format, who’s been sending them, I need
They walk back downstairs and stop at a door; John recognises it as the one Victor locked earlier on. Victor stands next to the door, looking bored, key in hand. Greg opens the unlocked door and reveals a lavishly-decorated bedroom. John thinks the house decor could not have possibly got more ridiculous until he steps in the room: a large canopy bed dominates the centre of the bedroom, intricate carvings and details in mother-of-pearl covering a golden-painted headboard and footboard, a silky cream fabric draped over canopy and bedposts; an impressive fireplace that looks like it has never been used stands across from the bed, and a couple of armchairs upholstered in the same silky fabric frame the hearth. Some doors lead to what John supposes is an en-suite and walk-in closets. The room has a distinct Victorian flair, and looks, much like the rest of the house, completely uninhabited.
“Your ‘protection’ is what is killing him.” John turns around to face Victor at this. “If he can’t do the work, what else does he have left?”
John jingles the car keys. “Could you help me unload the car? I feel I brought half of the house with me, but you cannot imagine the amount of crap she needs.”
‘You don’t have to do this, brother mine,’ was Mycroft’s only remark between sips of Earl Grey, not reproachful but rather soft, a lament of things lost and gone.
“Brother mine,” Mycroft starts cautiously, “you’ve really done a number on yourself this time.” He’s not here to berate Sherlock but he can’t help himself. The last forty-eight hours have been absolute hell for Mycroft and he’s not in a forgiving mood. “I have managed to convince the people that need convincing that this was not premeditated murder but rather an act equipollent to temporary insanity.”
His mind is clearer now, which paradoxically is rather unfortunate – he can now fully take in the state of Mycroft. He eyes the rainbow of wiggly lines on the patient monitor, the arterial line, the ugly bandage wrapping his brother’s shoulder. At least Mycroft’s not on a respirator.
But this time, it’s him who is to be the bearer. Clearly. John closes his eyes to not let show his despair as the future sequence of events rolls in his head: Sherlock being lured into this forsaken place; John meeting him with a bomb; the whole place going up in flames, them dying together this very night.
Because everything that has ever happened, and everything that could ever have happened, has led them to this point in time. And there could never have been any other way to end.
Ignoring the already-made smoothie, Sherlock picks up the knife and starts slicing an unpeeled banana. “‘
“Sherlock and I were classically trained from a very young age. I am seven years his senior, and therefore had the advantage of time to become more dexterous in handling musical instruments. I excelled at the piano, and Sherlock at the violin. We enjoyed playing together, and rehearsed many duets. Word spread, and we found ourselves invited to perform here and there. It became apparent with time that Sherlock was skillful beyond the ordinary, and his tutors quickly became obsolete. His talent and his…flamboyant style on stage caught the eye of several agents.” Mycroft pauses, takes a deep breath, and fixes his eyes on one of the more recent photos of the two of them. “From then on, he had no need for rehearsing duets with me, or anyone else for that matter. He is brilliant on his own.” Mycroft glances at John and adds with a smirk, “He also won the genetic lottery for good looks.”
John feels Sherlock’s muscles tense under his hand but does not let go. He takes the opportunity to have a good look at Sherlock. Yes, Sherlock is furious, but there’s more to it. There’s an undertone of… embarrassment? “Sherlock, swear to god, I will go back and retrieve that bag if it’s something you were given by–”
“What would be the point?” Sherlock straightens the chair and slumps back down in it. “It doesn’t matter.”
John shifts from one foot to the other and clears his throat. “You can choose to be whoever you want to be. It requires discipline but. Yeah.”
“Thought I’d acquaint myself with your work.” His heart is racing and he takes a deep breath to steady his nerves.
“Sherlock, you know I’m not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion. You see, but you do not observe.”
The name makes bile rise in John’s throat, bitter and rancorous. “The smarmy tosser you locked yourself with in the office for a shag?” John waves his mobile around, which prompts a half-hearted tinny protest from Greg.
The two men look at each other for a few moments, the room filled with anticipation. John settles his tea again on the coffee table, gets up from the sofa and walks to the window. He crinkles his blue-grey eyes against the bright morning sun, still low on the horizon, while he surveys the treetops of Olympic Park. He takes a deep breath. “Seven thousand pounds a week. And a probationary period. He dances my waltz or I’m out.”
how liberating a good shouting match would be right now, a year of pent-up frustration and resentment finally being let out.
“Hmm, he’s just meddling as usual.” Sherlock doesn’t quite meet his eyes – his attention is still on the boat. He steps into it and examines the motor closely.
The line goes quiet, and so does the house around Sherlock. But this silence is filled with the promise of
The train back to London is mostly spent in quiet contemplation at the events around Baskerville. Sherlock is not the sort of man to dwell on the past, but he needs to process what happened in this head. The thrill of solving the puzzle still glows warm in his chest.
Sherlock finishes to a new round of applause. “Thank you, thank you,” he repeats pleasantly. “The next song is from my latest album, and it’s called
It’s Sherlock who replies with a sombre yet kind tone. “Joe had his opportunity for redemption, and he chose to cower away. He is the one who cut off any emotional bonds that were still worth keeping. Masked himself behind shadows and lies.”
And then there had been James, but that hadn’t really been anything, had it? Just another victim of circumstances.
Not in a million years would Sherlock have ever thought he would see his brother like this: pale, fragile, mortal. Human.
His fingertips flutter over greedy hands extending from the sweaty mob, taunting, promising. His shorts are digging into the crack of his arse, the fishnet tights are itchy, the metallic top is the single most uncomfortable thing he has ever worn but he is making it all work, and that is all that matters. This performance is flashier and more extravagant than his usual fare, an attempt to get out of his comfort zone and gain a wider audience. And the venue was carefully chosen to cater to the not insignificant number of his LGBT+ followers. He focuses on the moment, on the performance, on the music, on his routine.
“He’s helped me to get where I am. In fact, he– John, I would not be here today if it wasn’t for him. Literally.” Sherlock licks his lips. “I understand he’s been giving you some attention–”
“I’m. I’m glad I’m here too, Sherlock,” John stutters as Sherlock widens his eyes and softens his features.
Mr Hardy, Sherlock’s tailor for many years, flutters around Sherlock as he stands wearing what will become a new navy-coloured suit. Sherlock is facing a full-length mirror, half turned away from John, perfectly still as Mr Hardy picks a loose thread here and pins a safety pin there. John stands ramrod straight at the door of the small, private fitting room. He eyes the proceedings with side glances while trying to keep his attention to what is happening outside. It shouldn’t bother him: Irene is watching the entrance of the shop from a safe distance, and Molly isn’t too far away with the car, ready for a swift escape if needed.
. “You are paranoid and you are infecting myself and my staff with your fanaticism.” He dumps the sliced banana into the blender and pointedly presses the start button.
It has been years and thousands of miles away since they had last seen each other, back when he was Captain Watson and she was Colonel Morstan. There had been something like a casual
He’s answered with an annoyed huff. “Do you really expect Sherlock to take care of such a menial task as firing staff? And no, I don’t leave the keys out of my sight, Mr Ex-Head-of-Security.”
In the shroud of a badly illuminated sitting room, John’s eyes are feral and menacing, and the intimidating step forward while he shouted made Sherlock flinch and recoil. He chastises himself for displaying such weakness, but what can he do? His body still remembers even if his head has tried to forget.
“Elementary,” and Sherlock knows he should shut up, but he can’t help it, “you have a military stance but favour one leg, suggesting you’ve been wounded in combat. Tan lines on your neck and wrists – your face and hands are tanned but not from sunbeds or holidays abroad. The pin on your lapel? The Rod of Asclepius. You’re a doctor who has been long enough in the army to get that tanned and then injured. Conclusion: an ex-army doctor. My only question is,” he raises a dramatic eyebrow, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock kicks snow off the boat pier. He paces the short length, looking distracted or perhaps deep in thought. His attention is caught by something on the dinghy boat that is tucked away under the roof of the simple boathouse. John comes down to the pier to join him.
Victor waves a dismissive hand. “He didn’t have to. It’s obvious where he slept last night, and his mood today tells the rest of the story. Not very professional of you,
Ellie shakes off those darker thoughts as she senses Sherlock’s keen gaze on her again. She is suddenly exposed under his scrutiny and does not miss how he narrows his eyes just the tiniest amount. She inhales sharply and claps her hands on her thighs. “Well, boys, it’s been lovely to see you, but I better get going and rescue my sister from those pests.” As she makes a fuss of getting up and picking her handbag from the floor, Sherlock addresses her quietly. “You and John have more in common than what you think.”
“My dear John,” he continues, mirth in his tone, “always so protective of me.” He takes a moment to mull over his next words. “It was all perfect when it was fresh and new and there were no difficulties. But as life happened, we started sliding along each other as tectonic plates. The geological metaphor is apt: one could say this resulted in an earthquake. We just… we just missed each other, and the moment was gone.” Sherlock lowers his gaze to his own lap and adds in a whisper, “I thought the moment, the perfect conjunction of having someone in my life that fits me would never come back.”
John is about to protest but then he considers. “Does it feel better to walk around than to sit still?”
John sets his mug on the table and rises from his own chair, alarmed but willing himself to stay calm. He switches to crisis mode, with a single-minded focus on the problem at hand, to provide reassurance, assistance, protection, relief. “Tell me.”
The Mayan’s staff know their work, so his video starts rolling and his song starts playing. Sherlock peels off his outer layer of clothes. There is a flicker of vulnerability in his gut – he is aware of his scantly clad body being so exposed to the lascivious eyes of a few hundred men in the room – but soon he uses his sex appeal as a trap to ensnare them into adoration, frenzy, submission. Sherlock immerses himself into the flirting persona, where everybody is a target and no one gets the prize.
And with these words, John’s heart breaks, tiny small shards cutting him bloody inside. “I’m–– scared, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, that tickles!” John was laughing, voice still rumbling with sleep, and Sherlock understood why: he had been drawing lazy circles on John’s naked back with one hand but got so distracted with daydreaming he had been applying that amount of pressure that is just short of too much and of too little at the same time.
John is so taken aback by Sherlock’s question that he doesn’t consider his answer before raising his shields again. “…Afff–ghanistan. How did you – oh, Greg told you about me.”
The party is exactly what one would expect from such a social event: black suits and shiny gowns, live music, champagne flutes and hors d’oeuvre on mirror-polished trays. Fortunately, it’s a small event, catering only to rich wallets – apparently, Sherlock had consented to his presence here in exchange for generous donations for selected charities.
“I chose her when I had no other choices, Sherlock. I didn’t want to choose her.” He chokes on these words, an unreleased sob trapped in his throat. “It wasn’t her I wanted to choose,” he whispers, defeated.
The man interprets this as permission to take a vicious hold on Sherlock’s waist and pull him closer for a harder rut. Sherlock is visibly startled but releases himself with a deft twirl.
This exchange has at least had the effect to make Victor notice John and shift the subject to the primary motive of his visit. John doesn’t quite catch everything they discuss, as there is background information from their pasts that they gloss over, but in essence Victor needs to track lost relatives in England. As he lives permanently in the US and cannot afford a prolonged visit these days, he thought of Sherlock, and here he is. Sherlock accepts the case; the men say their goodbyes, a handshake just on the side of too long, an unblinking exchange of apologies without words.
There is no need for words right now. The evening slides away with an easy companionship that surprises Sherlock.
John is surveying the throng when his mobile buzzes in his pocket. As he thumbs the icon to answer the phone call, he tenses, ready to go into battle mode.
Sherlock winces in pain as he rises from his nap on the sofa. His days are pathetically reduced to trips between his bedroom, the sofa (sometimes the armchair, when armed with enough pillows to support his back) and the loo. Right now, he doesn’t know exactly where he wants to go next: he woke up hungry, but the nausea quenches his appetite.
John collapses on top of Sherlock; they slide arms around each other’s sweaty bodies in a careful, loving embrace. They roll onto their sides in a loose hug and stay like that for long minutes. They kiss, slow, between pants of exhaustion, nuzzling noses on cheeks and necks and sweet spots behind ears and temples. John brushes mussed up curls from Sherlock’s forehead, and the gesture is so affectionate it shatters something inside Sherlock’s chest.
The answer is obvious, really: Sherlock dismisses sentiment and romantic entanglements as things that happen to other people, and it just reinforced John’s belief that his friend was somewhere in the asexuality spectrum. But he had been so sure that Sherlock had had his heart broken by Irene… Then Sherlock had thrown himself off a rooftop and there was no point to think about these things any longer.
Now, though… Sherlock stands behind a kitchen chair and clenches his hands around the top rail. His grip is tight, knuckles white with the effort. He had just stepped out of the bathroom while John drank his evening cup of tea.
John’s hand still hurts from the effort of holding the pen steady while writing the letter to Sherlock. The tremor in his left hand is back, worsened by the drink. He knows that.
“The– what? What flash drive?” John is still looking around, the last traces of sleep quickly dissipating as he takes in his surroundings.
In one swift movement, he stands up, snatches the orchid from the table and whirls the vase to the opposite wall, where it crashes in too few bits to be satisfying.
Now, Mrs Hudson is no prude, and she has long believed her boys should be together as more than just friends. But the crassness of the overheard dialogue stops her in her tracks.
John lifts his eyes to Sherlock’s. The room around them is still bustling with activity and noise. Sherlock stares unblinking at John, his piercing gaze establishing a non-verbal conversation John doesn’t know if he cares to take part in.
This is John’s attempt to convey some normalcy back to their co-existence: focus on the practical details, let the earlier subject drop.
And the worst part is: Sherlock cannot blame him. He threw this very fact in John’s face all those weeks ago, accusing John of being afraid to care too much for his clients and therefore not connecting emotionally with them. And Sherlock had been fine with this, aloof and arrogant in his solitude, triumphant over not falling for pedestrian feelings like John’s.
He huffs down the staircase, too worked up to wait for the lift, and storms out of the hotel towards the beach. A brisk walk by the sea, that’s what he needs to clear his head. The sunlight can’t quite compete with the chill from the sea breeze to warm the scenery but John doesn’t feel the cold, the rage within providing an unwelcome source of heat. He walks and walks, and after some twenty minutes of ruminating on the whole situation and realising he’s a fair bit away, he turns back.
John feels helpless – he can’t follow now without making a scene, and even if he is tempted to go down there and yank Sherlock off the stage, he knows he’ll lose any leverage by causing a scandal. Instead, he settles for a strategic position on the staircase that allows him to survey the scene. He looks frantically around: it’s too dark over the anonymous mass of people, and there’s too many of them, unvetted and unchecked. He spots Irene: she has managed to worm her way to the opposite side of the stage and lurks in the shadows, fidgeting.
Sherlock decides they aren’t close enough, too many layers of clothes between them. He makes quick work of John’s shirt buttons, and John fumbles to undo the rest of Sherlock’s, hands bumping clumsily. John smooths his hands up on Sherlock’s chest and buries his hands under Sherlock’s shirt, slides it off his shoulders; the garment flutters to the floor in a silky whisper. Sherlock grabs John’s biceps and falls heavily on John’s bed, dragging John down with him. John releases an amused ‘oof’ as he lands on Sherlock; he braces his arms around Sherlock’s head and rubs up his body, making Sherlock gasp at the contact between naked chests. John leans down and kisses him deeply, shifting his hips to frame Sherlock’s.
. Sherlock obviously recognises it too as he starts humming along, and glances anew towards the small space, where a few couples sway to the sweet cadence of the ballad.
The door opens abruptly after what seems to be a small eternity, and Sherlock steps out enveloped in his long coat and scarf.
John feels like this has shaved ten years off his life. Although, when he stretches his left hand out, he smirks – there is no tremor.
!” There are unshed tears in John’s eyes, and Sherlock’s heart breaks all over again. “I am sorry I hit you, blaming you for the death of a woman that tried to kill you!”
“Hello, John.” Sherlock feels like an idiot now. He’s intruding on John’s and Rosie’s evening routine, and for what? “I hope I’m not interrupting.”
John tastes the acronym ‘FTIR’ mentally; it nudges something in his memories of organic chemistry classes. “Sounds a bit improbable that FTIR would be able to measure anything.”
“Many years ago, when Sherlock’s career was taking off, I had a…dalliance with a young man.” Mycroft’s eyes slide to Sherlock’s. “We were physically involved for a few weeks, then I ended it.”
. Sherlock thinks the decor in that room is ugly enough to put him off sex for good, but to each his own, he supposes. “As I say,
“John, that’s preposterous. Surely one can measure love through hormonal variations associated with its various manifestations, such as lust, attraction, arousal, affection?”
with all the overwhelming changes in his routine and living space. He feels trapped in other people’s agendas, is shoved from place to place and is told what to do every minute of every day, his only respite the solitude of his flat.
“That would be good. Yes.” Sherlock clears his throat. “I will have dinner in the meanwhile, anyway.”
“No.” John opens his eyes and shakes his head. “No, Sherlock. I’m done here.” Irene seems to be taking in the room and slides her confused gaze from the broken lamp on the floor to John’s weary expression. “Someone attacked Sherlock while we were away,” he explains, and realisation dawns on her face. “You were lured out but I…I had no excuse. I stormed off.” He forces himself to meet Sherlock’s eyes, pale and worried and so crystal clear. “You were almost killed because I– I failed. I failed you. In every way I could’ve failed you.” Sherlock is shaking his head but John doesn’t let him interrupt, not now when he found a scrap of courage to take the right decision. “I quit. You’ll be in good hands with Miss Adler.”
Why he is trying to push John away? John didn’t invade his space; he had come to Sherlock in an attempt to reconnect, and Sherlock shunned his effort as unnecessary and inconsequential.
John grinds his teeth, staring at Sherlock. “Yeah, let’s do that.” His eyes finally slide away from Sherlock’s and to his mobile screen. “Sorry, Greg.”
Ellie looks back at him and takes a deep breath before answering. “No. He’s staying away. I think for good, this time. Tom has accepted this. In a way.” She takes a sip of tea to buy time, organise her thoughts. “It’s never really going to be okay, but he knows Joe has to stay away for everybody’s sake. I do question sometimes if it is wise to separate him completely from his father, but…” She does not finish her thought.
She smiles a bright smile. “Come on then, before you threaten my beakers or something. And no, I’m not ‘too kind’ — I do enjoy being your friend and lending you a helping hand.”
The cadence is almost sweet, the Rs rolled in an Irish accent. John’s head snaps up to find Sherlock still sitting primly on the edge of his chair.
. Not that John will say it out loud. The temptation to take the envelope and turn his back on Victor Trevor and this whole mess is strong. John sweeps his gaze across Victor’s opulent mahogany desk, a piece of furniture as functional as it is made to impress. There’s a black mesh filing tray overflowing with papers, a matching pen holder, blocks of post-its in different colours, more papers, a small organiser with assorted knick-knacks like paper clips, scissors, a set of keys.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No. I asked for help with pain relief as soon as I got there, stated clearly I had taken ibuprofen and paracetamol… and that it was not helping.” There’s another ragged breath, and eyes fluttering shut. “The doctor told me then it… it was complicated to give me anything stronger because of my medical history.”
“I’ve had enough of your destroying my lab equipment because something sent you in a strop. Sit the bloody hell down on that stool and drink the damn tea!” She points to a seat just behind Sherlock with one of the mugs, sloshing a few drops over the rim.
They sit close, each on their own towel, near enough to almost share body heat. There’s a cool breeze, and neither have taken off their clothes. Sherlock sorts pebbles into piles according to colour and shape – he didn’t bring a book. All he has is his mobile and his head to lose himself in. He casts furtive glances at John, sees how the sea breeze plays with strands of his silver hair. Contemplates how not so long ago there were more blonde than grey hairs. This look suits John though; it’s a nice complement to the crow’s feet and smile lines, faint but there. Maybe John has had more reasons to smile lately?
Bill Murray’s house has the outward appearance of a quaint log cabin but is much bigger in size. The glimmer of a small loch is visible just behind it, a simple boathouse with a short dock at the edge. The landscape is dominated by hills and woods, and as the sun peeks shyly out through a crack in the cloud ceiling, the snow blanketing the idyllic view sparkles like glitter. It’s cold, and Bill hurries his guests into his warm home.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies in the same tone, “there is decent drainage in this type of soil and the rain is abating.”
“You make a fuss about not being my GP at the surgery, but then nag me endlessly at home to take painkillers.”
he feeling? He hasn’t tried to parse his own emotions until now but the fact is Sherlock is first and foremost, angry. Furious. With Mycroft, the shooter, this Moriarty bastard, the world at large, John for asking him how he’s feeling and for being so caring and protective, and the anger twists into wretchedness because
Greg laughs openly, and she joins him soon enough. There might still be a chance for a universe where Sherlock Holmes and Sally Donovan will get along.
“Maybe she just wants a one-night stand and would leave you alone after that.” John ignores the clench in his guts as he suggests this. He glances over his shoulder to see a baffled Sherlock staring back at him.
Ellie tucks a curl behind her ear and smiles back. “Ah, it’s good to have a few days off. There’s an exhibit on the history of rock at the V&A Tom wanted to go to, so we made a getaway out of it.”
and a suggestive lyric. He skims the dancing crowd with increasing anxiety: the stalker could be here, very likely
And whose fault is that? Every time Sherlock turned his back, John spiked their drinks with shots of this and that. What the hell had he been thinking? Why had he done that?
John is waiting outside the imaging services when Sherlock leaves the CT scan room, almost sprinting while holding a small plastic bag in his hand. He looks positively
Victor makes a mollifying gesture and backs towards the door. “Alright, darling, we’ll give you some space.” Ignoring John’s venomous glare, he slips out of the room. Irene sighs loudly and follows. Before John steps out, he turns to Sherlock. “I’ll be right out here waiting to take you home.” The door clicks shut behind him.
Cool sheets. Warm bodies. Delicate touches. Shuddering ecstasy. Words of love and devotion. Sonnets whispered on naked skin. The unspoken bliss of
John laughs, claps both hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. “I’m so happy for you! We should send that for analysis, to assess the chemical composition–”
Standing in John’s doorway, Greg Lestrade gives him a sunny smile. He looks good, John thinks; it’s been many years since they clapped eyes on each other. Greg’s kind brown eyes are decorated with crow’s feet and his hair has turned silvery. It gives him a look of distinction, and suits him well.
Sherlock’s voice is flat and cold. He slams down the knife into an innocent pear, cleaving it neatly in two halves.
The ninja-woman startles from being addressed and doesn’t reply. Her eyes are still locked on John, unfriendly and calculating.
Despite the dark, Molly’s blush is noticeable but she simply mumbles a ‘just doing my job,’ lets go of his hand with an affectionate smile, and disappears with the limo off to the garage.
Sherlock closes and locks the door before turning to Richard, lest John reaches them and interrupts too soon. He’s aware John is following them, but he’s hoping for a quiet moment to interact with Brook, away from the noise of the party.
“Hooper. Molly Hooper.” She nods once and turns to continue cleaning the car. “Alright, go ahead, Mr Edison.”
A loud buzz unlocks the gate, which starts to open slowly and noisily on its hinges. John shakes his head in incredulity and marches back to the car. His hand on the door handle, he sees a black Land Rover fleeing, tires screeching, from the nearest street corner. John squints – is someone keeping an eye on the front gate? He gets in the car, drives up to the house and finds a small car park where a young woman is sponging a limo.
Mycroft touches his arm carefully, but Sherlock still flinches. “Would you care for a brandy?” He gets a jerky nod in return; Sherlock follows his older brother into the library.
“It’s not that I don’t want to take care of you,” John replies carefully, “it’s just that someone might think it unethical. The last thing I need is a complaint to the GMC.” Sherlock huffs in impatience, and John decides to change the course of the conversation. “When is your CT scheduled?”
“Guys, when did all of that happen? The bomb, the shot?” Irene asks, sombre. John had started the call by explaining in detail the last day’s events.
“I can definitely provide you with what you need. I’ll throw in a personal demonstration with the purchase of a second product.”
Which is why Greg is so very attuned to any changes in Sally’s mood. What he senses today, though, has him worried. Sally is
He stops at John’s number and taps the phone icon. This is a break in the pattern they had agreed upon without actually having agreed on anything, but Sherlock finds himself too desperate to push away the tendrils of panic nearing his consciousness to care.
, but a very shiny metallic outfit consisting of a cropped top and impossibly tight shorts over fishnet tights. How John had not noticed Sherlock had changed to leather flat dance shoes, he doesn’t know. The ensemble could have looked cheap, but not on Sherlock’s elegant, lean body, well-defined muscles moving under the elastic cloth. Outer clothes abandoned on the floor, he bounces around the stage with eased practice as he starts singing:
It all clicks into place for John. He wonders momentarily if this is how Sherlock feels when he has just deduced something brilliant.
Damn it all to hell! The samples are definitely contaminated — it will be next to impossible to make any sense out of these results. And the reason? All thanks to the ineptitude of a
“Morning, Sherlock. Yeah, I did,” John lies, dashing his eyes elsewhere over the bedroom, skimming over the floor.
The following roar is as good an answer as anything, and as an industrial beat starts blaring from the speakers, a large screen behind the scene lights up and starts playing a video. John recognises it as the one they were filming the day they met. Sherlock tugs his scarf off, opens his coat and disrobes in one swift gesture. He rips his tear-away trousers off, the stage lighting bursts into a kaleidoscope of bright blues and greens, and the whole club gasps.
A sharp smell invades his nostrils; something chlorinated? His head is killing him, and his stomach is roiling. He rolls to his side and dry-heaves; with nothing in his stomach, there is not much to throw up. He had been, after all, on his way to dinner with Sarah.
Sherlock is a huge star; of course John has seen him on some random ad or the cover of a magazine. He’s worked for a few celebrities before, so he’s not easily star-struck. And yet. There stands Sherlock, six feet of elegance radiating from underneath a bespoke dark grey suit. A navy-blue shirt completes the ensemble, two buttons undone to expose a pale throat. The sharp light differences in the room accentuate Sherlock’s chiselled cheekbones and dark, luscious curls. But what makes John’s heart skip a beat is not the sensual figure in front of him – well, not
“Weren’t you also studying to be a doctor? I was surprised to see you working as a bodyguard. Would’ve thought you’d be a GP or something.”
“I’ll make do,” John replies, breaking into a light jog with an inviting nod to Sherlock to follow him along the path. Sherlock looks pleased and follows without another word.
he is? When Sherlock had asked him to go out on a date, a tinny voice inside his head had insisted on reminding him of the dangers of attachment, on how it affects his focus on the work. On how, regardless of how much Sherlock gives of himself, it is always wasted as his partners leave when it all becomes too much. When
Sherlock halts in the middle of their living-room as John shuffles in with… oh. Oh! Before he can stop himself, Sherlock is reaching for the Irish Setter puppy squirming in John’s arms. “John! Oh!” He buries his nose in the soft chocolate fur and lays a hand on the puppy’s neck to avoid the worst of the inevitable frantic licking on his face.
Then, there should be a slide of lips so that there is alternation between top and lower lip from both participants. Mental note: apply previous lubrication to lips. This step seems overwhelming; in which direction should the participants move to maximise coverage and pleasure? There is also no data on this, I need data!
Unfortunately, while the pain had relented somewhat, the evening of the CT scan debacle sees Sherlock taking a turn for the worse. He’s in so much pain the NSAIDs aren’t quite cutting it – and John is not going to prescribe narcotics to his flatmate unless he wants to get into
As Christmas approaches, effort is put into decorating the mansion. There will be no large party or reception as originally planned – too much of a security risk, and nobody is in the mood anyway. There’s tasteful tinsel, soft fairy lights, a sparsely decorated Christmas tree in the foyer, and Mrs Hudson’s mulled wine. Sherlock ventures more and more out of his flat to chat, sitting here and there with headphones on, quiet and contemplative, and scribbling down lyrics and ideas on paper. John keeps a polite but not too large distance, giving Sherlock the space he needs to put himself back together. He knows the incident at the club has rattled Sherlock enough for him to start listening to his new bodyguard, even as he tries to stay nonchalant and dismissive of the whole security thing. There has been a hint of embarrassment colouring Sherlock’s words since that night, an unwillingness to admit to himself and the people around him how weak and panicky he had felt. He has deftly avoided the subject since then but has slowly acquiesced to John’s demands in amping up the security around his routines.
And so, John waits. He sits and listens to Sherlock going through agitated pieces that later mellow into sad adagios and requiems. A good twenty minutes later, Sherlock sets his violin down in its case, walks in silence to the kitchen and puts the kettle on.
It’s all John can do to not sputter and spit tea all over his lap; he quickly regains his composure and decides that denial will take them nowhere.
In the end, a compromise, an incomplete truth. “Well, while it might help establish motive, knowing exactly what happened to Ms Morstan doesn’t influence the outcome of the Moran case. It’s just paperwork now.”
“John Watson!” Mrs Hudson is now proper scandalised, beetroot-red and more than a little bit miffed. “Really, what kind of proposition is that! At my age!” In defiance of her troublesome hip, she skitters down the staircase as fast as she can manage.
“Sorry,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, smoothing over John’s back with a warm hand. “Good morning.”
“Ah, just,” Sherlock clears his throat, “uh-hum, just wondering why we didn’t bring champagne with us.”
John senses Sherlock’s gaze on him. To his surprise, Sherlock is staring at him wide-eyed, mouth open in disbelief. “J-John?”
Mycroft gives an almost imperceptible nod. “I just want to start by saying that I never thought he would go this far.” He exhales a shuddering breath.
“I know how you love to play games. And how easily bored you get, and how you strive for change. Why would I… why would
It’s pouring properly now, pelting loud on the old shingles and the windowpanes. Yet, Sherlock’s acute sense of hearing picks up an extra sound. It is unmistakable: there is a car parking in front of his door. The crunching of gravel under heavy tyres is almost drowned by the rain, but just almost. It’s too late for the postman, and Mycroft knows better than to show up unannounced. Maybe a neighbour, but in this weather? Some sort of emergency?
Molly smiles softly. “I know you do. Now,” she sets her mug down and straightens her spine, “I know John is away, which means you are hardly eating; how about we go and get some lunch? My treat.”
The next day is a regular workday for John. The seasonal flu and various colds are tapering off and being slowly but surely replaced by spring allergies and the usual blend of soft tissue injuries, rashes of more or less known origin, and pregnancy scares. John finds himself daydreaming between patients about the trip to Thorpe Park. After the lakeside walk, they had decided the mood for more thrill-seeking had wafted away. The drive back to London had been mostly quiet, and the evening peaceful and introspective, with a light supper, book reading by the fireplace and an early retreat to their bedrooms. Sherlock had been fidgety but not outright complaining of pain, and John let him be.
The Westcott is an imposing Victorian building facing the sea, catering to a very exclusive clientele. John walks through the main kitchen with two of the hotel’s security people, the place abuzz with preparations for the evening’s party. Since he had been coldly informed that tonight’s event would be business as usual for the security detail, John had launched himself into mapping the whole place, planning and positioning guards, installing extra cameras (much to the manager’s chagrin; the man had complained about the equipment’s poor aesthetics and John had patted himself mentally on the back for not telling the man where to stick his aesthetics) and ensuring there would be at least three unobstructed escape routes.
Sherlock scolds himself internally – the most interesting man (and handsome, too…) passing through his door in
Greg frowns lightly but accepts the offer and follows her into her flat’s tiny kitchen. Mrs Hudson takes her time putting the kettle on, making Greg stretch to a top shelf and reach her fine porcelain cups (‘only the best for special guests’, she quips), fiddling with the biscuit tin, searching for a particular blend of tea, preparing a pot that finds its way to the table. Greg makes himself comfortable at her small table, talking about this and that, stirring milk and sugar into his steaming hot cup of tea, grabbing a custard cream.
Horror builds up inside John as he realizes Moriarty is removing parts of a bomb vest from a box; he recognizes them easily enough from his time in Afghanistan.
Despite his intense dislike for Victor Trevor, John has to admit the man made an excellent work of balancing a public outing with the necessity of controlling the attendance. Victor had told selected media outlets that Sherlock would come here tonight for a private charity gala. There are some reporters in place – all carefully vetted by John and Greg. Sherlock’s arrival to the hotel had been discreet, with only a few people recognising and approaching him for a selfie or an autograph. With the cooperation of the hotel’s head of security, everyone attending tonight had been searched at the entry point. It’s all about reducing risks and eliminating loopholes, and John feels confident this night will go without a hitch.
Five minutes pass, then ten. John and Irene stand by the door while Victor buggers off to talk to journalists and admirers, though he casts a nervous glance from time to time towards the locked door of the dressing room. He’s delaying the inevitable: Sherlock’s announcement to cancel tonight’s show. John looks meaningfully at Victor every time Victor glances at the door, reminding him of his demand.
unlike the absolute berk spouting nonsense in the middle of the room; and John Watson, interrupting occasionally to ask for a clarification or just beaming like an absolute idiot at Sherlock and murmuring his usual ‘fantastic’ or ‘that’s amazing’ endearments.
Greg’s bedroom adjoins his office, where Greg and John now stand. Greg nods towards an upholstered armchair, inviting John to sit, and hands him the envelope.
He opens a web browser and with a few clicks he plays a video on YouTube – Sherlock’s most recent hit,
John shakes his head. “Procedures like shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy can’t be done at home, so if you want to avoid the hospital…”
John reaches for his half-pint and quirks up a sad smile. “If someone is truly committed to attempt murder, nothing can stop them.”
Years ago, ages ago, Sherlock would not have thought much about this. He would not have reacted at all. So what if John had his mind elsewhere? But these days, after all they went through, after all they talked, after holding a sobbing John Watson in his arms – these days, Sherlock makes an effort, because John is worth it.
But John seems happy. He and Mary just got engaged, after all. He will not return to share his life with Sherlock. And it is all for the best, really. Sherlock came back with…
In comparison, this is absolute luxury, and Sherlock will not complain. Unfortunately, the lull in activity means he has time to rest and be alone with his thoughts. Again. As it has been the last eighteen months.
Richard is sliding a hand down Sherlock’s bicep, and John has to swallow bitterness and stop himself from intruding. Unfortunately, Mary notices this.
Like magic, a small clearing appears in front of the club’s door, and the limo stops in front of the red carpet. The roar of ‘Sherlock! Sherlock!’ being chanted by ecstatic fans is deafening as the car door opens and Sherlock climbs out and waves a hand at the crowd. With difficulty, John and Irene help the security staff to stave off a couple of overeager fans trying to reach Sherlock, and manage to whisk him in the club.
, and they are trapped in a cottage with closing walls and living ghosts. The little girl is still crabby after her nap, picks up on the grown-ups’ unease, whines all the way through supper, refuses every book John attempts to read her, falls asleep with big, fat tears drying on her chubby cheeks.
First, there should be the right pressure of lips on lips. Too light a touch and it might be considered unwelcome; too hard, and it will reek of desperation. Sadly, I am unable to find any scientific publication on the exact newtons per square metre (a.k.a. pascals; I stick to S.I. units, obviously) to apply. This will have to be empirically determined.
John raises an eyebrow but decides to not ask more. His mind goes back to the conversation with Greg and the exploding flower wreath. He had said nobody got
What constitutes a kiss? A close-lipped peck is not the same thing as a saliva-exchanging twirl of tongues. I am very much hoping for something resembling the latter rather than the former, so let us focus on this particular subtype.
“Now what, boss?” Molly accelerates but the traffic is heavy, hampering her attempt to put distance between the vehicles.
It’s only when Mycroft takes a gentle hold of his biceps that John comes to his senses and interrupts the kiss. “Mycroft, look, you– you are a lovely man–”
He sets his own glass down and gets up from the armchair. Sherlock follows him with sad but expectant eyes as John steps forward. One step, then another, against the treacle of all that tries to hold him back.
Their food arrives shortly after and the conversation turns to more trivial subjects, such as why Sherlock lives in East Dulwich when most celebrities prefer more central, posh locations in London (‘Yes, but they are idiots I wish to avoid, John’) or anecdotes from John’s various jobs (‘I lost it when he asked me to get a bullet-proof vest for his poodle’). The conversation is easy and light-hearted; Sherlock is relaxed, with a grin reaching his sparkling pale eyes, so far-removed from his stiff public persona he’s almost unrecognisable. John congratulates himself internally for choosing this place, as the low-light ambient and quiet crowd provides them with an extra blanket of privacy.
Hand in hand as they walk together, a path new and old, ending where it starts. The final piece of the puzzle neatly fitting into place.
He strides to the corner with the music stand, ready to pick up his violin and fill the void with melody, but as soon as he holds the case, he knows this is not what he needs. Right now, he needs distraction from the walls that are closing in on him; he needs noise not coming out of his hands. There’s neither a television set nor a stereo that can be turned on, so he turns to his laptop, choosing to stream something,
John sees all the unrestrained love in Sherlock’s eyes and must fight a new wave of sobs threatening to break from his chest.
Sherlock looks up at him, and John stops breathing. There is longing and hope and sadness in Sherlock’s gaze. “Does it, John? To whom, though?”
John doesn’t reply immediately. He purses his lips, avoids Sherlock’s sharp gaze and narrowing eyes. And bulldozes on. “Aside from having slept with my client?” He winces at his own words, sees how they land sharp and relentless on Sherlock.
John fetches a glass of water from the kitchen and gives it to Mycroft, who accepts the drink with a grateful ‘thank you.’ After he takes a few gulps and a deep breath, he lifts his eyes to his John. “I was an idiot last night.”
Bill smiles at him. “He did say you were clever. Quite right, I was a nurse.” He follows Sherlock’s line of sight out of the window. “Came back home a couple of months after John. No use for a nurse with severe PTSD. It’s neither here nor there.”
“It feels like all I do is apologise, but I don’t know what else to do. I’m sorry I showed up unannounced. I’m sorry if my presence here was in any way detrimental to your stability.” Good god, had he rehearsed this speech? “I’m sorry… I’m sorry.” He squeezes his eyes shut, lips firmly pressed into an unhappy line. “You’re right about not opening my letter. There’s things in there you probably do not wish to read. Egotistical things you do not need to be burdened with.” He hesitates a moment before his next words, heavy and unwanted, extracted rather than freely spoken. “I won’t contact you again if that’s your wish.”
a team. They have been through a lot together; and, despite the difference in their temperaments, they do work as a well-oiled machine.
Sherlock can indeed not imagine, removed from her life – their lives – as he has been for so long. No wonder she does not recognise him, does not trust this stranger in an alien place. With practised movements, John lifts her again to plop her down on one of the armchairs, the one Sherlock too easily started thinking of as
Better not to think about that. Ignorance can be bliss, after all. Best to concentrate on the mechanics.
A wave of anger floods Sherlock, of the likes he hadn’t felt in a long while. He also sets his cup down, sits straight, and unleashes his wrath: “Why not! Why would I! What would be the point of it? What has happened will not change, and whatever is in that letter will not alter the future! Whatever happens, happens, and I will embrace it regardless of your prose!”
Mycroft acquiesces with a tilt of his head and replies, “Better a small flesh wound than your life, little brother. This shall pass.”
His heartbeat hasn’t quite gone down to baseline level when there’s a brisk knock on a French door. John stares at the figure of Sherlock Holmes against the morning light, straight as a rod and hands clasped behind his back. He stumbles to the door to open it, squinting against the sunny glare. “Sherlock. Is everything all right?” The question is polite but John’s voice is strained with guilt and the leftover adrenaline from the not-bomb.
“Yeah, tonight. Sure. But I choose the place. And maybe don’t take the shiny metallic suit this time,” John teases gently.
Sherlock freezes, tea mug halfway to his mouth. A beat later, he puts the mug down and clears his throat.
John and Molly were allowed to stay after explaining they’re Sherlock’s security detail. Even if the clinical setting isn’t a foreign sight to John, this side of the fence is not an easy place to be. Molly rubs a tired hand between John’s shoulder blades, soothing and warm. Mycroft is out of surgery and, while his condition is critical, the prognosis is cautiously optimistic.
At that moment, the door of the morgue burst open and a tall man waltzed in. John did a double-take – the man was
John jumps out of bed, picks his clothes from the floor and looks around. Shoes, shoes, where are his damned shoes?
John reached out for Sherlock’s cheek (and oh, that he was allowed to do so nowadays still filled him with wonder), forcing him gently to turn to face John. “I’ve seen bags of thumbs, eyes in tea mugs and a severed head in the fridge. You being brilliant? You think this troubles me?”
John is paralysed, mouth open. The intimidation gives way to horror, his whole demeanour shifting from anger to regret. He slowly raises his hands, palms up, shaking his head in disbelief. His hands continue up, up, towards his own head. Fingers thread through silver blond strands, his eyes downcast to the worn wooden floor. “Oh my god.” He gulps. “Oh my god.” He starts trembling, and the third
“Stop it. Stop it right there.” And as Sherlock pauses, John opens his floodgates. “See, this is the problem. When it comes to the two of us, I am always your number one priority, regardless of the consequences for you. Yes, I did well in restraining you before you could put a scalpel through Culverton Smith but hitting you like that after was. Christ, it was unnecessary, it was violent, it was not okay, it was
!” Sherlock continues to pace the room, hands buried in his curls. He comes to a halt in front of John. “You will tell me everything, right now.”
Both John and James know what it is like to face death, to smell it and hear it and taste it. And they know that the brief feeling of immortality after being on the brink of destruction comes with a heavy price.
. Focus, John.” John makes a ‘carry on’ gesture, and so Sherlock continues, “What is relevant is that until now we had no way to link the attempts on my life to a particular person.”
Not for the first time in these last few weeks, Sherlock wonders if he isn’t seeing something moving about out of the corner of his eye. He blames the long shadows cast by the mid-July evening sun, leaves fluttering in the wind. He definitely does not think about how his mind is trying to fill a vacuum he had not wanted to acknowledge.
“Yes, although he would prefer to call himself a performer.” Greg clears his throat. “Anyway, I’m his manager.”
Sherlock seems to read his mind. “Yes, I also thought it was a long wait, was told they’re very booked and as long as my symptoms don’t evolve, I should be fine.”
Sherlock sits at a small table in a chromed chair, his hands chained and placidly placed on the table top. Mycroft sits across him and observes his brother: Sherlock looks pale but somewhat rested; he’s wearing ill-fitting prison-issued clothes but that doesn’t affect his posture, regal as ever. He has a blank expression on his face and follows Mycroft’s movements with his eyes.
The talk about pay presents itself as an excellent opportunity for John to shift the focus from himself to the true reason for Greg Lestrade’s visit. “And that’s why you’re here.”
attend the conference and smile and wave?” Greg is pleading but also seeing that Sherlock is about to agree to this. When he finally does, Greg releases a breath of relief.
Emotionally stumped? Sherlock is anything but – and John knows this, he knows his partner well enough to be able to call his bullshit. “You are not ‘emotionally stumped’, Sherlock. I don’t know what that guy did to you to make you think that, but I guarantee you–” John is interrupted by Sherlock’s low-rumbling chuckles and a shake of his curly head.
“What’s this?” he asks, incredulous, as a veritable entourage led by Victor leaves the house: Sherlock, wrapped in his dark grey long coat and a blue scarf, follows Victor closely, haughty and silent. Behind him, Irene moves silently too; she throws a viperous look at John and moves to open a limo door for Sherlock. The wardrobe assistant – Sally – carries two zip-up clothes covers, one in each hand, and heads to the car boot to store them.
Molly widens her eyes at the handgun John is packing away but soon schools her features and smiles a genuine, happy grin. “Sure thing, boss!”
“I know. It’s just that— sometimes I—” He takes a deep breath and relaxes further into Sherlock’s arms.
The situation becomes vivid and sharp in John’s head, as he continues to sit with an armful of Sherlock. If it had been as of late harder and harder to define their relationship, this moment makes crystal clear that “flatmates” and “friends” are horribly inaccurate definitions.
In the end, it is the easiest thing in the world to close the distance and pour years of longing and passion into the kiss. To walk into the dark bedroom and remove each other’s clothes. To lie down on cool sheets. To let Sherlock show him how adored John is and always has been. To bond again. To make love to Sherlock Holmes.
John smiles. He had expected derisive comments from Sherlock, clearly more used to fancier places than this. Sherlock is wearing the same dark grey suit as when they first met, but now a dark purple shirt peeks out from under the lapels. John can’t help noticing the colour contrasts beautifully with Sherlock’s long, milky neck and his bright eyes.
The old lady who had greeted John at the main entrance pops into the room carrying a small pewter tray holding a solitary long glass filled to the brim with orange juice and ice cubes. “Here we are, Mr Ford,” she sing-songs.
territory.” Sherlock will not allow John to interrupt him now. “My corner of the world. A small space I carved for myself. And I’m not just referring to my bees or the garden or the new paint job in the kitchen. It’s…” He shakes his head. “It’s my final attempt to move on. I suggest,” and oh how his heart constricts in his chest, “you do the same. On your own. Without having to seek some sort of redemption from me.”
John decides he is tired, so very tired of this inner hate and cowardice, this knot of permanent anxiety and distrust that rusts his soul away. Tired of unhappiness, tired of holding back. Tired of the inner voice telling him it’s wrong and dangerous and ‘I’m not gay’.
“Okay… okay.” John throws the duvet back and sits up. He only hesitates a moment before walking up to Sherlock and holding him gently by a wrist, more for comfort than any actual examination. Nevertheless, John registers a (thankfully) normal body temperature. He rubs a distracted thumb over Sherlock’s smooth skin. “I know you hate hospitals and such, but we really have to rule out problems with your kidneys. I’ll take you to the surgery to check for an infection as soon as it opens, okay?”
Moriarty smiles at him, a horrible, joyless smile. John is a seasoned ex-military, but something in Moriarty’s eyes makes him shiver: there is a contained madness, the gaze of a psychopath, vacant yet penetrating.
“Yes. I don’t want him in the middle of large crowds, at events that have had their entire schedules plastered all over the Internet for weeks now. It’s perfect ground for anyone with malicious intent to plan – in detail – and execute an attempt on Sherlock’s life. I won’t allow this.”
