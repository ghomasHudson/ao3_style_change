The lights are flashing and the music is blaring with a bass so deep it resonates in Dean’s heart. He knocks back another drink and looks out over the crowd, using his height to advantage to try and look for his brother. How hard can he be to miss? Sammy’s a fucking Ent! After a short moment he spots him, with a girl nothing short of in his lap, obviously flirting with him. Sammy being Sam, he is oblivious, talking to the girl while looking at the air in front of him with frantic hand gestures.
“Allright, just...five more minutes in bed?” Dean smiled at his boyfriend and wrapped an arm around him.
“One second please.” She said. Obviously not expecting a response, she turned around sharply and walked toward what Cas guessed was the kitchen.
His heart unwillingly jumps. So what if he’s been thinking about him on the regular, or daydreaming about meeting him again? That’s no one’s business but his own. But not like this. He looks positively drained of energy, and everything about his appearance, from his clothes to his hair is messy. He looks down. He is wearing pants he’d meant to wash after someone bumped into him and spilled their coffee on them, his socks are mismatched, on the left blue with deadpool and spiderman on them, and on the left black ones with Gandalf holding a stop sign. The only thing that looks okay is his shirt, dark blue -nearly black- and even that is crumpled. Yeah, he shouldn’t work looking like this, let alone meet Dean again.
He heard a loud groan, and hid his face in his hands, feeling his cheeks warm up with panic, and a headache coming on. When he traced the source of the sound, he realised it was him.
“Hello, I’m better than ever although my mood may have just dropped. I’m good!” I smiled and she returned the favor.
“Thank you. Jack, you said right? So you’re… I mean you’re Kelly’s son then? I was there, you know? The night you were born. Your mother loved you very much.” She smiled warmly at him and he felt immensely grateful that his mother’s last moments were with such a good person.
Castiel kept his defensive stance, but engaged with Jack, “I don’t recognize your grace, brother. I was sure I knew every angel in the garrison.”
“I am not an angel, Castiel. My mother was human.” Castiel’s eyes shot up with realization. “And your father? Who sired you?”
Jack hesitated. He didn’t want to make Dean angry with him, but he felt it was important for him to know it was a possibility. “Well, it seemed like it all started when Sam was in the cage. You made a promise you would go to Lisa’s.”
Jack had lost Kaia, Dean and Sam. Kaia had been showing him the way to the universe that Mary was in and somehow they got lost. Jack was trying not to think about how he never seemed to do anything right, even though he tried desperately to be good. He had to find Dean and Sam, but he wasn’t sure how. He tried to focus on their souls. He wasn’t very good at this. If only Castiel was here to help. But he couldn’t think of that now. He had to find them so he could make sure they were safe.
Cas tracked the movement of Dean’s Adam’s Apple as he swallowed his nerves. “But you’ll be human now, Cas.” Cas’ eyes had been tracing the movement of Dean’s jaw as he spoke and when he reached Dean’s eyes, he shivered. “Cas?”
Cas woke several hours later to a grumbling stomach and a dry mouth. He was clutching the tube of his grace underneath the pillow. He sat up on the bed and swallowed thickly. Off the nightstand he grabbed one of the water bottles he’d left for this purpose and chugged it. Then he ripped open the Ziploc bag containing a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich and ate it, savoring the familiar taste.
“Well… I do know you. Or a version of you. But you aren’t married. To my knowledge you haven’t even come close to anything like marriage since Lisa. Or at least, that’s what I learned from Castiel. I… I was connected to Castiel before I was born. I learned all about your lives through him. And I’m certain Dean was never married.”
It was annoying how quickly he needed to urinate after hydrating. He tucked the grace into the drawer. He wasn’t quite ready for it yet. When he was exiting the bunker’s bathroom after taking care of his human chores, he reached in to flick off the light switch and when he turned forwards smacked into a solid object he wasn’t expecting. It took him a moment to realize the object was a person.
“Thank you. That means a lot to me, and I’m sure it meant a lot to her.” He turned now to Kaia. “Are you hurt?” She shook her head and she looked fine, so Jack nodded his acceptance. “Okay then, I’m going to find Sam and Dean. Stay here. I… I don’t think it would be wise to bring you. I don’t want to lose anyone again.” Mary looked like she wanted to protest, but Jack was determined to leave them here so he spread his wings and materialized in front of the bunker. Then he focused his powers on Dean and Sam’s souls. After several minutes, he felt a spark from Dean so he locked onto it and pushed the wall open. Traveling through the door by himself was much easier, so as soon as he thought it he was there.
In the safety of his room Cas leaned his head back against the cold glass of the mirror on the back of the door. His right hand was clenched tight around the doorknob and his left in a fist against the hard fabric of his trench coat. When he finally released the tension, there were fingernail indentations on his left hand and his right throbbed with arthritic pain.
Like the time that Dean had given him the mixtape. Cas had been acutely aware of how nervous Dean was. His freckles were hidden under the vermilion blush that had unfurled across his cheekbones all the way to the cartilage of his ears. Cas remembered trying to trace the edges of the blush as it descended across his jawline and into the contours of his neck before disappearing beneath his maroon flannel. A tongue nervously flicking across an upper lip pulled Cas’ attention back to Dean’s face before he spoke.
“So, Cas I was thinking about you driving that truck and having nothing to listen to but the top 40s and I just thought, what a shame, ya know? So I, uh… well here.” He handed him a small rectangular object and shoved his hands into his denim pockets as soon as they were empty.
Castiel shook his head fiercely and Dean popped his head out from behind Castiel, scrutinizing him. “Cas, you got a kid? What the hell is going on?”
The annoyance of thirst, hunger, fatigue, and urination was nothing compared to the chaos his mind and body entered when he had been face to face with Dean. Cas didn’t know where to begin in trying to make sense of it.
Finding Mary had been easy. Neutralizing the angels who tried to stop him hadn’t been too difficult either. Now he just needed to get them out of here. Mary had tried to fight against him when he released her from the cage she was being held in.
“No, but you spent a year with her after Sam went into the cage.” Dean considered that, and shook his head. “No, that’s what Sammy wanted me to do. But Cas… That’s not what happened alright? Cas pulled Sammy out, but forgot part of him,” he glared at Castiel before continuing, “And Cas and I…” Dean’s cheeks flamed. So apparently still not good with talking about feelings.
Back in the bunker, Jack healed all their wounds and tried for casual as he brought up where he’d been. “So when I was looking for you I ended up in another universe. One where Castiel had never opened up purgatory and Dean and Castiel had never been stuck there. The angels had never fallen, and Charlie was alive. Lucifer had never gotten out of the cage, so I was never born.”
“Okay. Would you please lower your blade. For one, it will do nothing against me. For another, I’m not going to hurt anyone. You are my father. Not my natural father, but I want nothing to do with,” he grimaced before continuing, “with Lucifer!” he spat.
“Oh, I learned about it from Castiel. But in this universe you never went. Instead Castiel found you after he pulled Sam’s body out of the cage and he told you about his feelings for you.”
“You’re married!” Jack shouted before he could stop himself. He’d learned about human marital ceremonies from the internet.
Jack struggled with his answer. He knew Lucifer was hated, but he had never thought of Lucifer as his father. He hesitated, “Well… my father… well, you are my father.”
“I think we should go to the bunker. We aren’t safe here.” He wrapped his arms over Kaia and Mary’s shoulders and spread his wings wide, liking the way it felt to stretch them. Flying was so easy now. It was like walking or talking. Once he learned how to do it, it was like he’d been doing it for centuries. He flew them to the bunker and looked at Mary. She was hurt, he realized. He’d seen Castiel heal people before, but had never done it himself. Maybe it was like flying though. He pressed two fingers to her forehead, and forced his powers to feel her injuries. They went easily to the spots that were damaged. Mary stiffened slightly and then relaxed as she felt the relief.
He stepped out and was staring headfirst at a massive beast. From behind him he heard Sam shout, “Jack! Man are we glad to see you.” He turned around grabbed tightly onto both of them and locked onto home, pulling securely on the both to bring them through with him.
Cas rolled the glass tube in his hands around and took several deep breaths. Then he flexed his broken wings, spreading them wide in the ethereal plane. If he brought them to the material plane with them both stretched wide there wouldn’t be enough space to accommodate them in his room in the bunker, so pulled his left wing in close to his body and stretched the right wing until the tips touched the wall. Then, he flicked his wing sharply and brought his wings to this plane. His back ached like a muscle that hadn’t been used in a while at the added weight. He lightly flapped his wings, watching as the onyx feathers floated to the floor. Then he pulled his right wing in and did the same with his left wing.
He glanced up at Dean and saw him and Castiel standing very close together and whispering. Castiel had Dean’s hand in both of his. He was rubbing soothing circles over a ring around Dean’s finger.
“I was hot,” Dean’s eyes narrowed in suspicion, but before he could interrogate him Cas pulled the chest onto his lap. “I have something for you,” he said as he held the it out for Dean.
I sighed as I sat through another long day of being called a fag and other names. I was beaten in the parking lot during lunch and pelted in spit balls during class. Gabe helped me clean myself up and apply some makeup after lunch. Dean has only ever heard the names they've called me, he never knew about the abuse. It must've helped that he was barely attentive in any of my classes. People have learned to keep it hidden from Dean and so have I.
As I got closer to the door, I could hear a moan come from inside. I slowly opened the door not wanting to interrupt whatever might be going on. As I heard the stall door open, I noticed only one set of shoes inside. I looked up to see Cas, his arms were lined with scars, some new and some old. He quickly tugged his sleeves back down and his eyes scanned the room for an exit.
Dean started the car, heading over to his place. He smiled when he spotted his home sweet home. It sure was something and he was grateful for having it. College wasn’t always easy, especially not with a job, but he did his best to get by. He stopped the car and took the key out, getting out and locking the door. Castiel did the same and Dean shot him a look, however, he didn’t seem to notice because instead he was nodding approvingly at his place. Dean felt proud of this accomplishment.
I went to a nearby coffee shop and sat down at my usual spot. The waitress came over and smiled at me leaving me my usual. I came by here so much that they already knew me and what I wanted. I handed her forty dollars and smiled giving her a thumbs up when she dropped half of the change into the tips jar and the other half into the charity jar. They all knew that's what I enjoyed doing instead of receiving the money back and sometimes some were still wary of doing it. So instead of looking at me oddly and giving me back my money, they simply deducted the little money that the food and drinks cost and left the rest for the tips/charity jar.
I sat on Baby, he black paint shining in the light. Baby’s as gorgeous as any car could get except she was that and more. She wasn’t just a car and everyone knew that. I hopped off the hood and went home. The lights lining the street were just bright enough to help guide me to my house without tripping over a bush. I grabbed my key and opened the door to the sight of Hester by the refrigerator. She seemed jolly as ever to see me and I have no idea how she even got in here.
He found a nice shaded area that seemed to be alright for his baby. He knew that she deserved a much better spot, however, this seemed to be the best one and it would have to do. He grabbed his bags and hopped out of the car, making sure to lock the impala before making his way towards his school. He adjusted his flannel and leather jacket as he approached the doors, he wasn’t quite sure he was ready for another day of learning and school gossip paired with the good old drama, but it would have to do.
Dean was beat at one of his old schools for coming out as bi and after that, his dad figured it out and sent him to a mental hospital and to get treated. He came back and said that he was straight and realized it was just a phase. After that, I tried talking to him about it but he just said that he was young and stupid and didn't know what it meant to be bisexual. His dad beat him some more and paid some schoolmates to knock some sense into him as a reminder. The principal figured out Dean was getting bullied but when he realized what for, he decided Dean didn't deserve to go to that school and kicked him out. Dean and I moved school together because I didn't want to go to a school with a homophobic teacher. Once I moved, everyone else decided to move too.
"Because I like bees and you know that?" I smiled up at him and watched the way his arms moved by his side when he walked over.  His brown hair looked as good as always and his eyes lit up the room. I knew that I was mildly upset at his girlfriend and my sister, at that moment though, I didn't care. Dean meant a lot to me and sometimes  I felt ashamed that I had fallen for him but anyone else would have to. Dean is simply perfect and I absolutely love him.
By the time I had the pancakes almost ready to be served on plates and the table set up, I could hear Cas throwing his clothes on while I could hear Sam and Gabe fighting over whose stuff was whose over the phone. Sam had called me earlier to remind me to pick him and Gabe up, as if I would forget.
“Oh, damn. Rowena must really be a pain in the ass then. All she told me was that she had this really nice guy she wanted to set me up with and to tell her all about him once the date was over. She never told me anything about the date thing…”
I rolled my eyes once she was gone and wondered what in the world I was thinking. I have Ca- I mean Lisa to worry about.
That was all Sam said before I left that house on this wonderful friday evening. I didn’t bother taking Baby. I walked instead, it gave me some time to think about Cas and Lisa and what I wanted to do with my life. In the end, I decided that I might love Lisa but I love Cas more and he makes me happier. Screw it if the whole world is against us. I’m gonna love Cas and be with him till the day I… But what if he’s gone. My thoughts came flooding back and soon I was running.
"Hey, is everything okay?" Dean looked into my eyes clearly concerned. I felt my legs grow weak and my head started hurting. I started getting dizzy and sick to my stomach and almost backed out. What if this was what was going to split us apart? What if this was going to drive us apart?
“Nice car,” Castiel said, gently closing the door, respecting the car. Dean was grateful for the way he treated Baby kindly.
He turned around quickly and hopefully, eager to hear something but I wasn't sure what. He almost hid his hopefully grin, almost. He looked amazing, I wish I could have just gone over there and love him but I can't.
I looked at Dean with a shocked expression, surprised to see Meg went both ways. It wasn’t long before the mood was ruined and something went horribly wrong though because right when Meg got off the bed, Miracle bounded right off and out the door. Dean shot up faster than ever and Gabe practically pushed Sam off the bed in surprise, failing when the rails and heavy casts kept him in place. I wanted to get off the bed just as bad as them but it didn’t take long for Dean to notice how much pain that brought him. Gabe on the contrary went scrambling right off the bed and out the door to try to find Miracle. Meg walked over and helped Dean back onto the bed, wincing at his groans and noises of pain. Charlie went to check on Sam making sure he was okay and that she could eat every last piece of gay bacon off Sam’s bed. Gabe came running back in with Miracle, dropping her back on the bed and motioning for Charlie and Meg to join her. Charlie waved Gabe’s invitation off and allowed Meg to cozy up in the bed alone.
The nurse was taken aback and it took me a while to process what I had just said. I could feel my face start to flush a bright shade of red and tried to hide my embarrassment by pushing open Cas' door but knowing my luck, it was a pull not push door. The nurse awkwardly opened the door and escorted me in.
"I- I... Dean! I'm okay, I was playing soccer with Gabe earlier and I tripped over a rock. His foot ending up colliding with my face during the fall." I looked at Dean and felt bad for lying to him. I was surprised by how quick and easy it had become for me to lie. Dean looked at me and nodded.
Later on around dinner, Dean had made a delicious pie and some burgers. Cheeseburgers are my favorite and he knew that so he had made some just for me. We sat down at the table with the lights off and some candles lit so that the electric bill won't be too high. I smiled as I bit down into the delicious burger. Dean looked at me with a look I couldn't quite identify. I smiled up at him as I devoured the delicious burger. I wonder if Dean tastes better.
I jolted away and wondered what time it was. I looked around panicked, wondering if it was already morning and time to get ready for school. Dean smirked at me, amused.
I could hear a consistent  rattle on my left side and I crooked my head to see what the fuss was. I smiled when I saw that it was Cas lightly banging his spoon against the metal of the bed. He smiled up at me, compassion and love radiating in his eyes. He looked happy for once, complete even. I was glad that soon, maybe, just maybe, I could be his and he could be mine.
Once we finished eating, I grabbed the dishes and wished her a good day as she made her way to our room to grab her belongings. I turned on the faucet and began washing the dishes. Once I finished, I realized that I forgot to give Cas the rest of the raisin brownies I had made for him. I thought about it for a few minutes and finally decided that I would try to find Cas and drop off the brownies as an excuse to see him. I know I probably don't need an excuse but it would be nice anyways. I run back to my room and grab some clothes for the day. Grabbing the usual outfit consisting of jeans, flannel, a shirt, and leather jacket. I adjusted the samulet, a necklace Sam gave to me when we were younger for Christmas, and made my way to the door. I grabbed the keys and headed out.
Sammy seemed to understand as his long legs seemed to skip to the passenger’s seat. He left my door- the driver’s side- open and ready for me to come take over. I dragged myself up high enough with the support of a nearby street light and wobbled over to my rightful spot. I shut the door in perfect sync with Sammy and drove off. We got to a gas station to fill up Baby and Sammy needed to take a leak.
“Exactly,” he paused, “except, without all of that, where is the thrill? The lust to find something new and see where the road takes you. The excitement of not knowing what’s to come but knowing whatever it may be, you’ll never expect it. Where’s the deciding factor of making new decisions and figuring out who you are as a person. You can figure out who you were made to be without trial and error.”
"Hell yea! We have school today! You better be awake now, Cassie!" I jolted away once I heard Gabes voice echo from the opposite side of the room as Sam.
When Dean came back, I was curled up on the couch and watching a recorded episode from a show Dean and I watched together. It made me happy to think that Dean had cared enough to record the episode so that we could both watch it together for the first time instead of just watching it without me. I fought back the urge to smile once I saw him walk through the front door, normally Dean and I watch the episode when it airs but that means that we have to sit through ads and that was just no fun.
I turned to my right to face Sam and I saw his long hair brushing against his face. I always wondered what it felt like to have long hair, not that I’ve never had long hair, it’s just… Not really my thing. I flinched and the jabbing pain in my side returned.  I knew I had bruises and broken ribs and all this other stuff, just didn’t expect it to catch up with me so fast. That’s why I was still here, monitor attached to me, cast on my leg. I actually had a few casts and sprains and stuff. I had all these weird needles jabbing into my skin, attached to me as if I was some sort of lab rat. I’ve never liked hospitals, always made me feel like I was under a microscope, people looking to see what was wrong with me. It made me feel small, almost weak.
I tried to run. I tried to get away but he just grabbed my other arm. He pulled me in close to his chest and I let out an ugly sob. I cried into him until I heard the bell ring. I pulled away from him and saw the sympathy in his eyes.
I let out a sigh of relief thankful that Dad was gone. I dragged myself across the floor to get close enough to the door so I could crawl out. I looked up at the sky and saw the stars shining bright. I wondered when I would be able to come out of this hell hole, have Cas in my arms, have a family, kids, a nice home, decent jobs… I adjusted my eyes just in time to see a shooting star go by. I watched it go by as I spilled all my deepest darkest desires.
Once we finished gobbling down our food, we got into the car, picked up Sam and Gabe, and drove to school. The rest of our siblings lived together and drove each other to school. John was out at work a lot and Mary had sadly passed away. Adam stayed with the Novak's and had a very good relationship with all the siblings. As soon as we got to school, we parted ways.
"Cas, are you okay?" Dean looked at me, concern flooding his eyes. "Where did all those scratches and bruises come from? Are you wearing makeup? Cas!"
“I remember that day so vividly, you moved in right next door. You were wearing your olive green jacket, it was paired with flannel and a plain shirt, your jeans. You always wear jeans, maybe you should try sweatpants or something, I hear they’re pretty comfortable,” Cas joked.
I grab the keys from my pockets and shove them in to start the engine. It roars to life and soon we are at home. I plop out of Baby and into the building, straight for the door. Midway through pulling the door open, I looked up to witness Gabe midway through just having  jumped off the couch and landed on the floor for absolutely no reason.  Once I pulled it completely open, I found Sam and Gabe inside. How did they get in?
With this said, the conflict evaporated and we settled down, peaceful again, We let out a breath, perhaps we could get away with not having to return the bag. Maybe, just maybe this would be our perfect little love story. I smiled, snuggling closer to Dean before turning my attention back to the television, all of us had seemed to settle down pretty nicely after Lisa had gone. Meg lifted an eyebrow, glancing at Sam and Gabe getting cozy on the hospital bed. I gave her a small grin before motioning for her to get up on Dean’s empty bed. Meg happily accepted the offer, glancing at Dean for assurance before she bounded over and settled in, Miracle jumping onto her lap. Though we all had much to discuss, for now we would let it be and rejoice in the moment.
I decided on washing my hands, I pushed the button on top of the sink and adjusted the temperature using the motion sensor. I lifted my hands until it said 85° F and used that temperature to wash my hands. Once I was done, I simply tapped the button again and it turned off. I went to the blow dryer and decided to test my luck with it. I put the temperature near the middle and the air ¾ to as strong as it could go. I ignored all the other buttons, not wanting to complicate it all too much. I waved my hand underneath it and watched as the air came out just right . I moved my hands in and out slowly as instructed and realized that I’ve been doing it all wrong the entire time. Once I was done, I waved my hands in front of the motion detector for the door and it opened up outwards instead of inwards. This bathroom was really smart. I walked out and noticed as the door shut and the lights turned off.
Once I grabbed a hunting knife, I went over and quickly flicked the blade in and out allowing the machine to loosen its grip on my card. The plastic eating machine finally let it go after a few hard tugs. I made a hmph noise on my way back to number 9 and shoved the pump into Baby. Giving her only the best for the best.
Once school was out, I ran out the doors to find my Sammy waiting. I ran over and gave him a big hug.
She had to open the curtain, allowing her to have a view of my arms wrapped around cats. My head on his chest. Her jaw dropped open and I turned to try to scurry off. I was immediately challenged by my broken bones, slight trouble breathing, and a heavy pain. I groaned and Cas pulled me back so I was in his arms are not dangling halfway off the bed.
And that's what happened. I decided to stay right where I am because for me, it's impossible to say no to Dean. I loved Dean and more than he expected. I wanted to tell him more than anything how I feel but I couldn't risk it. Even if there was only the smallest possibility that Dean would stop being friends with me and cut me out of his life, I wouldn't take it. I don't want to risk it. I love him too much to lose him. I love him more than myself.
Apparently, Adam claims that he always knew it was going to happen someday because apparently he said, “Cas and Dean always seem to save each other instead of me everytime and I always end up sidelined.”  I knew he was referring to sports and how we always helped each other out while managing to forget Adam in the process. I struggled to hear every word they were saying considering Sam didn’t bother putting them on speaker. In the act of trying to listen, I almost fell off my bed and Sam in turn, turned on speaker allowing Cas and I to hear.
“Don’t worry! I called him earlier, he said he was on his way,” I smiled thankful that I had decided to call my brother earlier that day.
His head whipped around to try and see who had called out to him. I smiled once he looked up at me and I could see his body relax a bit before it tensed up some more. He quickly whipped away his tears and hid his face in his hands.
“You’re mean!” Cas groaned before sighing, his blanket rising up and down with every breath he took.
“Oh. Oh! This is going to be fun to watch,” Gabe plopped on my bed and shoved a sucker in his mouth.
I glanced behind Dean and realized all the curtains were now open except the one by the door, exposing Dean and me to Sammy. I smiled up at Sammy until I realized that he had broken a few bones. I raised my eyebrows at him and looked directly at his wounds.
When Dean was younger, he spent more time with his dad and Sammy. His dad struggled with the sad truth that Dean's mother had passed away and took his anger and sadness out on Dean. He drank till he couldn't walk and beat Dean senseless . Dean never liked to admit it and always thought of his Dad in a good way but deep down inside he knew the sad truth. When Dean tried opening up to people they never believed him and thought he was searching for attention. Although John might be an abusive drunk, he was always kind near others. He was an amazing manipulator and knew exactly how to turn people against each other, including his son.
“Baby, if you don’t like parties that’s not something to be ashamed about,” Dean said, comforting me.
“So many things are unknown to people to the point where they know enough to the point where they believe they are correct but not enough to understand why they aren’t.”
When I came out as gay to the school last year, a lot of people had taken that as a reason to bully me some more. I always struggled with being bullied. My name, clothes, and weak way of being didn't help. Dean was one of the most popular boys in the school. He always tried to help but his friends always forcefully pulled him back.
I looked around at my surroundings and realized I had fallen asleep on the couch in my- mine and Cas' apartment. I hadn't heard anything from the hospital and I still don't know what happened once I got pushed out. All I know is that I heard it loud and clear and I made sure to get my final words through to Cas. I hope he heard them. I miss him.
“Yes, Dean hit me on the head with a rock. To be fair, you know he’s been through moments like that and sometimes ptsd isn’t something easy to overcome. He tripped and the rock was there. I wasn’t thinking and from his position it must’ve been perceived as if I was coming at him in an aggressive manner,” I said, defending Dean although I knew Charlie understood. We had both seen firsthand what John could do to his son and it wasn’t anywhere near pretty. John had been a decent man before the tragic death of his wife, however, after that, he wasn’t the same.
My anxiety levels skyrocketed. Before I could turn back, the door swung open and low and behold, dad. He was standing there and behind him I could see that he’s been drinking. He grabbed me by the collar and pulled me inside.
My lips were pressed together as I nervously chewed on my superior labial frenulum - the thin tissue sheet under the top lip that somewhat connects with the gums - and waited in the waiting room. I missed Cas already and just wanted to tell him how much I missed him. This wait was killing me. It’s been such a long time at home with Lisa and as much as I love her, she’s just a mask to cover up the sad truth, I’m in love with Cas.
Castiel suddenly seemed to grow red, he seemed like he was constipated all of a sudden. Dean suddenly realized that he was messing with him and holding back his laughter, however, Novak failed and his laughter was soon heard echoing around the house.
I was snapped out of my, erm... thoughts? Dean's arm reached over to the table next to me and the sudden movement had caught my attention. He seemed to be reaching for a cup but I couldn't see very well considering I didn't want to move. He lifted the cup up to my mouth and helped me drink. I could feel a very tense pain and that's how I knew I indeed had broken a few ribs. I could hear the faint and muffled noise of a phone ringing and it took me a while to realize it was Dean's. I watched him sadly as he walked over to his phone, it was most likely Lisa and that means he would have to go.
I could hear footsteps running down the hall but no matter how fast they ran none of them matched the pace my mind was going and none of them no matter how slow could match the slowing rate of my heart.  I took in a shaky breath. I could feel my body become overwhelmed by exhaustion but I knew I had to keep fighting. Time seemed like it was slowing, the footsteps sounded faint and distant, the speed they were going at felt much slower than it really was. I could hear the ticks of the clock slowly passing by. The ticks grew louder and louder within each one. Although I knew I had to keep fighting, my mind was telling me otherwise. Although I knew I was not alone, every inch of my thought process was telling me otherwise. Perhaps, Dean would be happier this way. He loves Lisa after all, what harm could it do? Just giving in to the blissful peace, the beautiful empty. Dean has Lisa and Gabe has Sam, everyone else can figure themselves out. They don't need me. It'll be alright, I'm just a problem for them anyways, they wouldn't care if I'm broken but they wouldn't want me that way either. With those thoughts, I could feel the ticks suddenly get faster and louder and the noise was so unbearable I felt like my ears would explode. I could feel the ticks like a person could feel their heart in the pit of their stomach except I couldn't feel my heart as much as I wish I could. I could hear the footsteps getting closer. My vision grew weaker as my eyes began to flutter shut. I could see the door get pushed open and Dean fighting with doctors and security trying to push his way in.
I woke up in the morning and went to make breakfast. I assumed that Cas was grumpy about how I was distancing myself from him so I could spend time with my girlfriend. It's not like it mattered much anyways, Cas is only my friend. Nothing more, nothing less, and it never would be. I kissed Lisa's forehead as I left her sleeping body, striding over to the kitchen. Cas had awoken earlier on too and though I would never admit it out loud, I wanted to make breakfast for him too.
I stood there unable to move and unable to show any sign of emotion. I didn’t know how to react or how to feel about it all and it took me a while to process. Once I finally realized what was all going on, I tried pushing her way. Instead, she took that as an invitation to put me on the counter. She quickly moved her grip from my arms to my crotch. She lifted up too far and it hurt like hell. She continued to raise her hand until there was no escape but going up.
I laid back down on the couch and set my alarm. This time, I let myself fall asleep, and for good this time. Time to get ready for another day in hell.
Meg’s face flushed red before she composed herself and stood, a grin on her face. “The name is Meg, nice to meet ya,” Meg said, winking at her.
“Who said i loved him?!!” Dean sat straight up in surprise, and hit his head hard on Sam’s, who doubled over, clutching his forehead, and toppled off the bed, landing on top of a cursing Dean, knocking the air out of him.
He heard Gabriel get home after his shift, a little later than usual. he walked to the front door to greet him and ask him where he’d been, but noticed the red in his eyes, and decides against it. Something must have happened on the way home, because he would have been home earlier if he just left after his shift was over. Cas realises he hasn’t seen his brother so distraught in years, but there is a vague memory of Luci’s cremation, where Cas found Gabe in the closet with the jackets when he was looking for the bathroom. Back then, Gabriel was only twelve years old, and he begged Castiel to not tell anyone else that he was crying. Cas agreed, and sat down on the carpeted floor with him, and hugged him until the sobs into his shoulder grew weaker. Chuck luckily wasn’t awake anymore, he might have asked Gabriel what is wrong, and Cas has come to understand that it’s better to let Gabe drown in his feelings for a while until he feels better. If he has to confront the situation while he is still processing it, he’ll get more upset and he could then be silent for days. Cas decided to wait with brushing his teeth until he heard Gabe was done, to give him some space. After brushing his teeth he finished his chapter, and finally turned off the light, only to fall into a dreamless sleep.
“I think it’s an important thing to know when you’re on a first date. Establish some ground rules, y’know?” Dean shrugged, which was hard considering he was leaning on his arms.
“ I understand, my mother also died when i was young. She had pancreas cancer, supposedly hereditary. It took her quickly.”
“Where is your soul mark? I haven’t spotted it yet.” Cas seemed a little surprised by the question, making Dean worry he overstepped.
After sleeping over, Dean learns something about his boyfriend's brother and sees someone he never thought he'd see there.
“I thought it was a date.” Cas said, almost as if he was sober. “What was a date?” Dean leaned over without realising.
“And you were wrong. I still want to date you, and i am really glad you like me, because i like you too.” Dean’s jaw went slack, finally back to its previous position.
Still. Something in his gut stings when he thinks about it while walking to his car. He tries to look interested in the conversation he is having with Sam’s brother, but somehow he can’t seem to be fully invested.
“Dean i-. I don’t know what to say. I am sorry for bringing the memory back.” Cas turned his face away, making Dean look back at him when he felt the sun on his face again.
Dean: I don’t, the place is a fucking maze and everyone wear sunglasses inside. You know who does that? Douchebags!
“Can i kiss you?” Dean asked, carefully putting his hands next to him. Cas felt a flutter in his stomach, and nodded.
so Dean goes to this party, and is surprised to find a wasted Cas there. when he takes him home...stuff happens and Dean end up being mad at himself
His soulmark started pulsing, and his heart pounded in his chest. He turned to Gabriel, his ears ringing. Gabriel seemed confused, gripping his shoulder and softly rubbing it. Sam grabbed him by his light blue pajamas and kissed him.
“I’m sorry Dean. That must have been terrible for you. How old were you if you don’t mind me asking?” Cas seemed to phrase it carefully, las if Dean was going to break if he spoke too loudly.
Anita is full-on smiling at this point. “I put the apple pie in last when i heard he wanted it, he is going to have to wait half an hour.”
“You took the bus all the way here just to give me some food?” He raised an eyebrow, and seemed to smirk.
Sam’s Mark went hot, not uncomfortable but loving, and softly glowing with warmth. It felt like wearing a nice fluffy sweater, like reading in bed with a cat at your side while it rains outside. Like falling asleep in someone’s arms in a freshly made bed. Like baking a super sweet caramel cake together and getting flour everywhere. It felt like love.
“Nope.” Gabriel popped the P, and took another sip of his coffee, leaning back in the white chair, balancing it’s back on the wooden legs.
“The garage is on the right side, I'll get you the key to the door. How long do you think it’s going to take?” Dean got a round key thrust in his hands. The man closed the door behind himself, and walked with Dean to the garage.
“We don’t have to do anything, i don’t really want to honestly, but would you like to? I just wanna...you know.” He continued.
Dean: Yes but we live together, if he was planning on staying out longer he might have left a note normally.
Dean smiles, obviously the girl is trying to hook up a nice conversation. With a small pat on the back, he leaves again, scouring the crowd. Under other circumstances he might pick up a pretty girl, a hot guy or a cute enby, but he doesn’t feel up to it tonight. In all honesty, there is only one guy on his mind, and it’s Cas.
the years seemed a blur, and it had not been easy on them financially. But Sam felt so proud, walking to receive his degree right after his boyfriend.
“I got a millipede, i think.” Dean raised his hands to eye level, and it looked like he was trying to peer through his fingers. Cas make a semi-disgusted face at learning Dean was holding a millipede.
“Sure thing! Though the apple pie might take a while, they are being made in the back, so it’ll be fresh out of the oven, but you’ll have to wait.” Cas explains.
Dean: Really? It’s been busy here. I just got back from fixing some guy’s car in that fancy part of town.
“Sure, take these, they are light and fluffy, but coated with cinnamon, so your friend will like it.”
“Cas, this garden is crawling with them, literally. I can step outside right now and find one, bet?”
Dean smiles; “Oh no problem! I don’t have to come into work for at least an hour. You guys open early, you know?”
Cas leaned down on Dean, standing only a little bit on one foot, and putting his entire arm around Dean.
“You- you’re afraid of it?” Dean asked, with concern on his face. Cas nodded, his eyes near tears at such a stupid thing to be upset about. Then, there was a strong arm across his shoulders, holding him tight. Castiel looked to his side and saw Dean smiling at him.
He drops Dean off home, turns the music down, parks by the road, and for the first time in years, he allows himself to cry. His eyes sting quickly, a mark left by the times he spent crying over his late brother. But he keeps crying until his tears are gone. His soulmark feels warm, almost hot and his mind races through options of things he can do to not ever have to face Sam ever again. He feels so small. He always has been a small guy, but it feels like the world has hammered him into the ground. He was happy once, then his brother died. He felt alone, abandoned. His mother left, and his dad seemed to care less and less for his remaining kids. As the one of the oldest, Gabriel took it upon himself to take care of them. For years he put up a facade. But he always cried himself to sleep. But then Sam walked into his life, and showed him how to make something out of nothing. His mother was also out of the picture, she died when he was just a baby. They bonded over their shared experiences with growing up without a mom, and having a mostly absent father. And just when Gabriel had learned that he had hope, that he could have it all and do anything, when his smile wasn’t a facade anymore. Then the universe gives Sam a fucking girlfriend. His friend, his crush must be done with him by now. Understandable, Gabriel thinks. He knows he’s annoying, that he makes trouble where no one wants it and that his addiction to sugar earns him glares and sighs as he takes out an infinite supply of candy and sweets. Of course Sam wouldn’t want him. In a haze, he drives home. His routine is a haze, and he’s in bed with his pajamas on before he realizes it. However, instead of falling asleep he finds himself looking up at his popcorn ceiling for hours.
It wasn’t hot, scorching, it just felt...right. He felt warm on his side, and he felt relaxed. It felt like coming home after a long trip, collapsing on the bed, knowing you don’t have to get up. It felt like racing to a finish line, running through the lint and not looking back. It felt like finishing a 10000 pieces puzzle after two years. He opened his eyes slightly, seeing just a glimpse of Gabriel. His friend, no, his Soulmate. His romantic soulmate whom he was in love with. He tried to ground himself in reality. He tasted toothpaste, and it mixed with his apple scented breath.
He hears his name called and goes to pick up his order. He would like to thank the man, but only catches himself after he said thanks. He doesn’t know his name, so he ends up finishing with a lame “man”. He tries not to think about it much as he enjoys his coffee and scrolls through the news. After a while, when his cup is empty and the pie is finished, he gets a text from Sam, saying that class is done, and that he can come pick him up. he leaves, but as he makes his way to his brother, he can't help but think that he really would like a name to go with that pretty face behind the counter. Maybe he should come pick Sammy up from lectures more often...
“Sounds good...Dave it was right? Just holler if you need anything.” The guy in the bathrobe left the garage again, leaving Dean with the key and car. He went to get his equipment from the impala, and got to work. Maybe he could take another call today if he was lucky.
It wasn’t big, and the light wasn’t bright, but Dean could see enough, he could see Cas. He stood there sheepishly, not knowing where to leave his hands, his clothes or what to do next. Cas took a step towards him and took off Dean’s shirt, then kissed him softly. Dean took the hint and unbuttoned Cas’s blouse even more, until he let it fall to the ground. He was wearing a white top underneath, but Dean could see his body, and the only thing he wanted to do is hug it. But he did not do so yet, instead he peeled off his socks, and followed the example Cas had set by taking off his pants. He had barely gotten them off before he was dragged onto the bed. It was barely big enough for two people, but Cas took him in his arms and Dean felt a warmth spread through him. He wrapped his free arm around Cas, and wriggled his other arm to try and relieve the pressure on it to prevent it falling asleep. Once they settled in together, Dean breathed in deep through his nose, and it felt so right. He smelled Cas’s soap, and a musk, and something coffee-like that must have somehow gotten into his hair. Dean closed his eyes, and he had never slept that quickly or that wonderful ever before in his life.
He didn’t know where he had been expecting to end up, so he was surprised to find himself standing in the bunker, in front of Dean and Castiel. On his entry, Castiel shoved Dean behind him and pulled his angel blade out. “Who are you? How did you find us here?” he demanded.
Dean looked skeptically at Jack, “Well yeah? I thought you said you knew us? Or you knew another us? How would you not know we were married if you know us?”
“I’m Jack. We were trying to rescue you, but I lost Sam and Dean and Kaia on the way. There were so many doors. I… maybe we should start at the beginning.” Mary didn’t look like she understood much of that, but instead of explaining he gripped her tightly and focused on their universe. That one was easiest to locate because it was home. He focused the source of his power on separating the walls between the universes and spread his wings wide to gain leverage over keeping it open, then he quickly flapped his wings and pulled them through.
“Hmm? Oh, right. I, uh,” he cleared his throat. “Right, I know. But I prefer it this way. Will you keep it safe for me?” He held Dean’s gaze, waiting for his response.
Dean answered the door while Cas was still knocking. Cas had forgotten about his discarded clothing until he felt the prickle of Dean’s eyes as they traced up and down his body. “Cas, buddy, what are you doing? Why are you – “
.’ It means ‘I have placed my power of the heavens in this container, promise to guard these contents of him that is fallen.’” Cas watched as realization washed over Dean’s face. He reached over, unclasped the locking mechanism, and opened the chest. Dean took a shaky breath and sat down on the bed next to him.
Being human was… painful. And disorienting. He had gone over this plan hundreds of times. Thought endlessly of the times he had been human before. He thought he had it all worked out. He thought he was prepared this time. He wasn’t anticipating the intensity of… feeling that he felt towards Dean.
Dean looked completely shell shocked and everyone in the room stopped breathing. “You were married to him, Dean,” Jack finished in a soft voice.
“Thank you, Dean.” Cas lifted his hand to Dean’s face and smoothed his fingers across his cheekbone. Whether it was because he didn’t have a firm grasp on his reactions or because it just felt like the right thing to do at the moment, Cas wasn’t sure, but Dean responded by leaning his cheek into Cas’ palm and closing his eyes. Dean’s reaction seemed to release a dam in Cas’ control. He snaked his hand behind Dean’s neck and leaned in until their lips were inches apart. He paused, unsure if Dean wanted this, but Dean met him the rest of the way. Their lips moved together in a way Cas wasn’t expecting. It felt different than kissing April or Meg. It felt like kneading a piece of clay. Like they were of the same mold. When they came up for air, Cas panted his gratitude again, “Thank you, Dean.”
Cas stood in front of the mirror behind the door and commanded his angel blade to him. He popped the top of the tube and held it against his neck. Then he slowly sliced the skin above the tube with his angel blade and winced when his grace reacted to the pain. The tube was a heavenly object, designed to attract raw grace. His grace came out in tendrils and compacted itself inside the tube, swirling with discomfort at leaving its host. His body immediately felt heavy with ache and loss, so he capped the tube now containing his grace and stumbled to the bed.
“Hello, Dean. Can I come in? It’s important.” Dean let the door fall open and gestured for Cas to sit with a sigh. As Cas sat on the edge of the bed, Dean closed the door behind him. “So, what’s up Cas? Tired of the outfit?”
He bolted upright on the bed and glared at the offensive tent at his groin. He snatched the second water bottle off the table and chugged it down in an effort to control himself. After pacing the room for several minutes he pulled the tube of grace and pile of feathers out of the bottom drawer and arranged them in the wooden box he’d purchased for this occasion. He had used his grace to engrave the box with Enochian symbols. When the box was arranged he tucked it under his arm walked down the hallway towards Dean’s room.
"Yes?" I said as I bit down, taking another big bite. I moaned thinking about how delicious it tasted. Dean's cooking was one of a kind.
“I’m adorable?” I snorted. I didn’t believe Dean one bit and though I trusted him more than anyone in this world, low self-esteem has always been one of my problems.
My heart broke. It felt like it had been ripped out of my heart. Shattered into a million pieces. Salted and burned and then brought back again.
"Okay..." Dean's voice trailed off and he ran his hands through his hair. I ate my food even though I had lost my appetite. I know, it's horrible for me to be such a jerk. Dean is my best friend after all, I should be supportive.
Charlie shrugged, “I told my friend I would supply one handsome guy with an amazing personality and she agreed to do the same. We never told each other who it would be. I’ll ask her for some more details tonight. Just… be ready. I don’t need you showing up like a trainwreck. I really need this to work out.”
Sammy looked peaceful and that was all that mattered to me. Well, that and Cas of course. With time I’ll be able to call him my Cas. Yeah, I’ve never been one to wait, but for him, I’ll do just about anything. He was my ice cream in time of need, a time where I need to comfort, someone to depend on. He was a blanket when I was feeling cold and unloved. He was my shield for when I needed someone to help me, someone to be my block. Cas is so much to me, he was the world and yet nothing at once, I don’t know how to explain it. Perhaps, it would be more understandable if I explain to him as air. He’s everything you need, and everything you don’t have all at once. You breathe the air, you need it to survive, you want it, you practically have it every second of every day, sometimes you don’t even have to think about it, other times you’re stuck thinking about it so much you don’t even know how to utilize it. Air, you have, you need, you want, but you don’t want it. No one owns there, at least I don’t know my air yet. But, he was like my hair. I wanted to breathe him  in every second of every day, I wanted to have him by my side all the time, my weapon, my shield, my line of defense.
I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that Dean ended up in the hospital. I am not sure why, I am not sure how, and I have no idea how he ended up in my room. Just when I was starting to forget about Dean, he managed to claw his way back into my life, back into my heart, back into my soul. I loved the damn fool so much that just one sight of his smile and I fell in love with him all over again. I know it is wrong to be in love with my best friend and that is exactly why I have to get over it. I have to pretend like I don’t like him that way, like I don’t love him, like I don’t live to see him smile.
"You didn't have to hide that from me. You fall all the time you klutz." Dean chucked and I soon felt my face flush a deep red.
I grabbed some chocolate, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, eggs, and flour so that I could make brownies for Cas. I began to mix all the dry ingredients together and then the wet ones. Soon, I began to combine the two together to make the finishing batter. I threw some raisins in because Sammy is always telling me I should try eating healthier. Once that was over with, I popped it in the oven for a good 25 minutes or more and went to go eat. Cas walked out of the shower, towel around his waist, hair all wet and messy, he walked down the hall and towards his room. Before I could change my mind, I called out to him.
I woke up and my vision was blurry and the bright lights shining in my face weren't helping. I could feel the sharp pain rushing through my body but the thing that worried me most was the fact that I couldn't feel certain parts of my body. I tried lifting myself up but my actions were contradicted by the sheer pain that rushed through my body. The pain hurt so bad and immediately caused my pain to evolve into a panic. I could hear footsteps rushing towards me and before I knew it my hand was being held. My vision slowly cleared and I felt a hand gently brush the hair out of my eyes. I looked up to see Dean staring back at me, his eyes were clouded with sorrow and guilt. I smiled up at him fighting back the pain that it caused.
The rest of the day went by alright, I invited Lisa over for dinner and continued on with the rest of the day. It's none of my business what Cas is doing to m- his body anyways. We are close friends and I love Cas, I really do, but I can never admit to it. I can't show it and I sure as hell can't have anyone else figure it out. Instead, I have to prove to others that I care but just not enough to actually care.
Dean began pulling his clothes out of his closet, rummaging through his drawers as he tried to find the right shirt, the right set of pants, the right jacket. At the end of the day, he decided to go for his usual. There was no need in trying to pretend to be someone he wasn’t, he didn’t like to roll that way on dates that actually meant something to him. He turned on his classic rock playlist and got to work, hopping in the shower, doing his hair, throwing his shirt, jeans, and leather jacket on. He brushed his teeth thoroughly trying to make sure he got rid of the smell of cheap food and the remains of yesterday’s lunch. He threw on his socks and got his boots on, making sure not to forget his phone, wallet, and blade--just in case of emergencies--and ran out of the house. He unlocked Baby and got on the road, driving to go see his mystery date. He was nervous, his palms were sweating, and he was anxious. It didn’t help that Charlie’s love depended on this date, it just made him even more concerned about how the date was going to turn out. Charlie said that if we hit it off and got together then the girl would get with her and Dean couldn’t risk anything. Sure, he wasn’t liking this new idea of going on a date for the sake of his friend, but that was what he was dealing with and he wasn’t about to let Charlie down.
“There’s not much to tell,” Dean responded before grabbing some chocolate covered strawberries and popping them into his mouth.
I hopped out of the car once we got to school and ushered the rest of them out. I watched Sammy run off to class with Gabe before running after my friends too. I have to keep a low profile at school when it comes to Cas because he gets picked on and my reputation is on the line. Most people know that I care about Cas and I'll stick up for him but no one really messes with him so I have no reason to socialize with him unless we are out of school.
“Dean!” Charlie whispered harshly, waking Dean up. Startled, he looked around and up at the teacher. He sighed, thankful that he had his back turned until he realized that he was being asked a question. He turned around and looked Dean in the eye.
I looked into his eyes, they gleamed with admiration, with love, with compassion. He followed every word I said and every move I made. His eyes scanning the beat of my lips as they moved. His hands tapping along to the beat of the nervous shake in my leg. His gaze would flicker to my hands before shooting me a stern look. I’ve always had a bad anxious habit of peeling on my skin. Cas knew that and always did his best to remind me that it’s all alright and I need not worry. He reminds me to halt, breath, think, and pause my actions. It was one of the various things I loved about him.
My extra clothes and hygiene products habits were from when I had to leave the house to get away from whatever was going on but I liked to carry them around regardless now to in case the chance to help someone else ever came across.
Dean shoved Naomi out the door and I could hear Lisa struggling to stifle her laughter. Dean gave her a look that showed disappointment with a mix of anger and confusion. Once Lisa had realized that Dean had noticed her, she pretended to look at her phone and that something funny was on the screen. Dean shot me an apologetic look before giving Lisa a kiss goodnight and offering to walk her to her car. Lisa, of course, accepted and stole another kiss from Dean before they made their way out the door.
“Fuck,” Dean breathed out, running his hands through his hair. His once joyous eyes now dim from remorse, shooting a glare at Gabe.
I smiled at her and removed almost all the needles and all the dangly things attached to me. I grabbed onto the IV pole for support and dragged it with me to the restroom. Before I left I got to take a quick look around the room and on my way to the bathroom I realized that the person to my right is Sammy. I smiled, observing how he had his ear plugs in and was most likely listening to a documentary. His eyes were clothes and his hair was messily surrounding his head. He took in leveled breaths and let them out peacefully. I could tell that he had some broken or fractured bones and from the looks of it his arm was broken. He seemed peaceful and that was good enough for me.
I woke up and found myself wrapped in Dean's blankets. I looked around confused and realized that I was in Dean's room. I peeked out the door and was surprised by the sight of breakfast and Sam, Gabe, Lisa, and Dean all sitting down at the table laughing. I gently closed the door and curled back up on Dean's bed as I fell back asleep.
Right now, I did not feel very lucky, however. Most boys would be floating because of this, ready for their deepest desires to come true. Me, I wasn’t very joyous about this whole thing. I didn’t want her to explore every inch of my body, I didn’t want her to violate me, I didn’t want that. I was alright with the cuddles and kisses and late night calls. This? This was all just far too much for me and my mind to handle.
Once we did eat, I ran up to my room and fell asleep. I was awoken sometime at night by a scared Gabe who had had a nightmare and wanted to stay the night in my room. Of course, I said yes and allowed him to cuddle. We ended up falling asleep curled up together.
Adam has a pretty good life and is in the school's baseball team. Dad used to take him to games when he was younger and he loved it. He always wanted to be able to make dad proud with the little time they spent together. Adam is a good kid and I'm lucky to have him as my brother.
"We will talk about this later. Stay safe, goodbye." Dean walked out of the bathroom and I looked myself in the mirror happy to see that my body had already adjusted. I walked out and was glad that my body had been able to heal so well and so fast. Sure some of today's scratches and bruises were there but yesterday's were barely visible. My mother used to say it was a gift. That was before she left.
"Just some pranks we wanted to pull and whatever. Maybe you could help us plan some?" Abaddon chimes in.
"Yes?" I could barely hear his voice through the muffled fabric that was by his mouth. Oh, don't even get me started about his mouth...
"What do you think of Lisa?" I choked on my burger and fought the urge to cough. I sat there red faced as I reached for the water and guzzled it down.
You shined bright but the clouds were still there and the rain was still drizzling down. You wanted to let me back in but you didn't know if I would hurt you again. Your walls went up and although I knew you loved me you started to close yourself off. I could see you forcing yourself to blend in with others and it hurt me more than it did you. You thought you were doing both of us a favor by distancing yourself. You thought that if I couldn't hurt you that you couldn't hurt me but that's where we were both wrong. It hurt you and me and it hurt us bad. I fell deeper into my problems and so did you. We both fell down a long and dark hole that never seemed to end. The days were bright but they still seemed dark. It was like a mask for the sad truth, it was still raining. I didn't want it to keep raining and neither did you but no matter how much we willed it to stop, it didn't. We both screwed up and we got so lost in our problems that suddenly the fog started to roll in and we didn't notice it until it was too late and we had lost ourselves. We both lost our ways and we didn't know which way was forward or which way was back. If I could go back and fix it all I would've. I would go back and make it all better. I don't care if that means you never had to meet me because if you were happier that way and you had a better life that way then, it would be worth it. I love you more than the Earth loves the moon. I love you more than a mother loves her child. I love you more than anyone can imagine- than I could've ever imagined. If this is how it's going to end then that's alright because in the end, you'll find yourself. Perhaps, you'll be happier without me. You'll learn to love yourself and then you can work on loving others. You're always getting pushed down but no one seems to acknowledge how much easier it is to let yourself fall than it is to rise up. Have you ever realized that the words apart and a part are basically the same, the only distinction between them is the space. Isn't that ironic? I find it ironic. There is always more to a person than what you see on the outside, sometimes you think you can see what's on the inside but you're mistaken.
Dean’s brother Sam had always been smart when it came to school, he advanced quickly and was able to skip a few grades, putting him in college with Dean. Dean’s definitely smart as well, however, when the boy’s father had decided to leave, it put Dean in charge of both of them, finances included. Due to the fact that he had to work to keep a roof over their heads and food on their plates, he never got as much time as he would’ve liked to put into his studies. Dean never used this as an excuse though and he sure as hell never complained, just because has to work twice as hard doesn’t mean that he can’t make it. As long as Sammy got a good life, Dean was willing to let everything else fall into place, whether or not the pieces had a hard time fitting where they had to go wasn’t up to him. Sam always looked up to his brother as well, he knew exactly how hard Dean worked everyday to make sure that they were able to thrive and Sammy knew that Dean could’ve been so much smarter had he been able to get what he worked hard to give Sam. Dean wasn’t dumb, in fact, Dean’s far from it. Sam could recall multiple occasions where he’d gone to Dean for assistance and his brother provided.
“I built this place to get away from the craziness of it all.” Gabriel seemed lost in thought, not really waiting for a response.
“No, one of my friends is sick and i want to give him something to eat, something light on the stomach but also sweet. Any ideas? Please tell me you have some he’s really important to me.”
He stumbled back, bumping against the kitchen counter and gripping it with one hand for stability, while covering his eyes and forehead with his other hand.
Dean sighed. “Because of my mom. She loved it here and used to take me walking when she was pregnant with my brother. She was a firefighter, shortly after she gave birth she tried to save a small girl from a house fire. She suffered from severe burns when she died in the hospital over there.” Dean pointed to a yellow and white building half hidden behind trees.
Inside, the restaurant was almost as beautiful as outside. It had less fairy lights, but there was an indoor waterfall and beside that, a small hole in the wall, with no door with the words “kid’s palace” in fun, colourful but elegant letters in a half circle above it. And then they arrived at where they would be dining. Their table, but to call it a table would be a far stretch. It was a wooden pit built into the ground. There was room for about four people, and on the side there was a small set of stairs leading into the conversation pit. A relatively low table was placed in the middle, and it was right in front of the fireplace (Cas had been right). The seating was covered in deep red cushions, which were twice as thick as the cushions placed at the back. Even the floor, which the table was built into, was covered in cushions. There were the same plants as outside around the edges, and fairy lights, giving the occupants of the pit relative privacy. Cas’s jaw was nothing short of dropped to the floor.
“My dad isn’t an alcoholic, i haven’t heard from him in almost a year and i lied because i am too scared to tell you the truth.” Gabriel looked away from his crush, and felt tears welling up. He kept his focus on the door, hoping that he could make it out the door and to his room at the end of the dark hallway without getting caught by Sam or tripping over something.
After a torturously long bus ride, he finally knocked on Gabe’s door, which swung open immediately. Before he knew it, Sam had an armful of happy Gabriel clutching him and kissing him senseless.
And while that certainly would make some more money than working at a coffee shop, he also wouldn’t like it very much. He liked working like this, interacting with the customers, talking and getting to know them. There were only three people in the shop right now, but it was going to spike again in half an hour, when classes emptied out and people wanted a small morning snack. Cas wiped down the counter for the tenth time, and pulled out his phone, waiting for a customer to need his help.
Sam goes to visit a "sick" Gabriel, who doesn't like finding the guy he's been crying over at his doorstep looking like and awkward kicked puppy.
When Sam had called him, he was so afraid he couldn’t hold it together. He wanted to get drunk, drink even more than he had during the weekend. His entire weekend consisted of work, drinking, sleep, and repeat. He turned around in bed, gripping his sheets tightly in his fist. If Sam and him were never together, why does it hurt so much? He just couldn’t shake the little voice in his head, saying he had no right to feel like this. He wasn’t worth Sam’s attention. He needed his soulmate, a wonderful girl for sure, and not some broken, washed up loser addicted to sugar. He was about to curl up even tighter in his sheets when his doorbell rang. He sighed, he didn’t want to get up, but Castiel was already gone, so no one else could open the door. He rubbed his eyes, and stepped onto the wooden floor. His body felt weak as he made his way to the front door. When he eventually opened it though, he felt like slamming it shut and hiding in his bed forever.
Dean went upstairs and changed out of his clothes, hopping into bed, and falling asleep. He needed as much sleep as he could get with these sleep-deprived school days.
“Okay, maybe we could just make signs,” Gabe chuckled, “hold them up as she walks through the door.”
I rested my head against the not - so - cushiony pillow.  I miss Cas. Maybe, now that I’m here, I can go visit him. I smiled to myself thinking about Cas and how much I missed him. Maybe I could finally hold him in my arms, tell him how I feel, kiss him until the end of time. I was snapped out of my thoughts when I heard the sound of the now proved couple kissing. I shifted uncomfortably in my bed wondering if that would ever be Bee and me. Oh my Jack, I miss him.
I walked inside to pay the clerk for the gas on number 9 but instead of a person, there was a machine. I crooked my head as I looked at the damn thing. How the hell am I supposed to use this? I reached into my pocket and grabbed a credit card. My friend had hacked it earlier on for me so I wouldn’t have to go around worrying much about money but I still prefer not to use it much. I’d rather work hard to earn my things, however, sometimes it gets hard and I have to do what I have to do to survive.
I watched him stunned wondering if that meant anything. Had he just used my feelings to win? Did he know that I liked him? I felt a blush creeping onto my cheeks. I began to get up and turn the opposite way. I needed to get out of here.
Once Cas got home, he just took off his trenchcoat and went straight to his room. I never did end up to him about what happened in the bathroom that day.
Before he could get away, I pushed him through the door and shut it behind him. I closed the curtain around us and shoved Crowley down to the floor. If he hurt my Bee I would make sure he would never do that ever again.
We talked and waited a bit for Cas to come out, when he did I looked over at Sammy. Cas although he looked the same, you could see it in his eyes.
“Hey, little casserole over there?” Meg looked at Cas, “you are awfully quiet. Have anything to say?”
Lisa awoke not much later, she got out of bed and joined me. She sat in the same spot as Cas and I simply stared at her wishing that it was Cas instead.
“To answer both of your questions, Charlie and the rest, and Destiel is a combination of your names like Deancas except in this case Castiel comes first,” Sam winked at Dean.
I woke up in the morning and did my usual morning routine. I walked out of the shower and towards my room but Dean called me before I could get there.
“Dean, no offense, but you’re being a coward. Just call her up on the phone, ask her over, and toughen up. We are here for you,” I guestered at myself as Sam, “and we will support you and have your back. Good and bad, remember?”
"Cas, baby, please wake up. I love you," I took a shaky deep breath before continuing, "I love you so much. You're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I know I always pushed you away and you're so stubborn that you always stayed by myself. That's one of my favorite things about you. You stay by my side when I don't want to stay by my side. You've loved me when I've hated myself. You've always been there for me through my ups and downs. I love you Cas and I know I'm probably never going to get to talk to you again. I just want you to know you mean the world to me. I fell into your love and I got lost in it. I was too blind to see how much you truly meant to me. Now, you're gone and I'm stranded. I don't have my shield to guard me and I don't have myself held together. I lost the greatest thing to ever have happened to me. I lost the reason for my heart to keep beating. Now it's just there, empty and without purpose but it keeps on beating. That's the worst part, it keeps on beating but without purpose it beats without meaning. It remembers what it was like to have meaning and purpose and a reason to continue but it no longer knows how to feel. It no longer has a reason to. Now it goes on, but it goes on without meaning. I've lost the best part of me. Now it's my fault that you're gone and I have no right to tell you how much I miss you. I have no right to tell you that I'm sorry or that I want you to come back. I could cry and try and pray and crave for you to come back but in the end, it wouldn't do any good. It was my fault any of this happened. It's all..."
Cas waited patiently as Dean struggled for words. “Cas why is your grace in a tube?” he finally asked.
This was surprising to Jack, but not altogether alarming. He wasn’t blind. He could tell how much Dean and Castiel meant to one another. But he never considered that another turn of events in the past could have resulted in them being together today. For the next hour they talked about the differences between their two worlds. Then Jack explained to Castiel about his problem with finding his Sam and Dean with Dean’s soul being present. Castiel suggested that since he clearly knew so much about his Dean and Sam’s lives, he concentrate on that when he focused on them, so he would know which version to look for. Jack tried and when he felt a twinge from Sam or Dean, this time he didn’t jump straight to them. He searched their souls until finally he found a Dean that was longing for Castiel. Now that he had been near a Dean that did not have this constant longing imprinted on his soul it was easy to spot the others that didn’t either. He was shocked how many of them there were. He locked onto the one that was longing for Castiel and pulled himself through the door.
Their reactions were exactly what he had been expecting. They went for the attack. He let them come, and focused on controlling his emotions so he wouldn’t hurt them. He stood completely still as Castiel shoved the angel blade into his chest and Dean shouted about him being the spawn of Satan. Then he calmly took the angel blade out of his chest and handed it hilt first back to Castiel. “Like I said. It won’t do anything to me. And I really don’t have to time for this. I need to find Sam and Dean.” He tried to focus his powers on Sam and Dean, but it was muted by Dean’s soul being so close to him. This Dean’s soul was different though. It felt more full. Brighter, if that was possible.
He struggled to find the appropriate response, “I’m alright. I was… Nothing of import. Just wandering.” He quickly fled before his traitorous body could reveal anything he wasn’t prepared to deal with.
“Dean! I’m so sorry! I didn’t see you!” His hands fluttered down Dean’s arms hoping he hadn’t hurt him. The muscles his hands grazed sent a spike through his stomach he hadn’t been expecting.
“Jesus, Jack. Warn a girl, would ya?” He had assumed a greeting was warning enough and couldn’t think of an appropriate response, so instead he said nothing. “What happened, Jack? I woke up on the side of the road, all alone.”
Cas had been expecting this question, but it didn’t make it any easier to answer. It was made even more difficult by his recent… emotional turmoil. He spoke slowly when he answered, “I don’t want to be without you. I want to… experience life alongside you. You have been my family for years. I can’t imagine a life where I’m not with you.”
Cas let his mind wander. He thought of Dean’s tongue skirting across his lips before he thrust a cassette tape at him, of Dean adjusting his tie before they entered a police station, of the way Dean laughed with his whole body and clapped Cas on his shoulder when they left the brothel, of the warm embrace Dean pulled him into when they reunited in Purgatory, of the way Dean’s Adam’s Apple bobbed and his eyes fluttered when Cas imitated Val Kilmer, of fingers gliding down his thigh when he was resurrected at April’s, of a hand squeezing – Cas’ eyes shot open as he felt a physiological response to the memories that were flooding his mind.
“It’s fine. I’m fine, Cas. Are you okay? What were you doing in the bathroom?” Cas watched as Dean’s mouth curved softly upwards and his brow furrowed in concern. As Dean’s eyes darted over Cas’ face, Cas was overwhelmed with an onslaught of emotions he hadn’t been expecting.
“Castiel? I… I wasn’t expecting to find you here. I was looking for Sam and Dean. But I…” he paused, and looked intently at Dean. Something felt different here. It wasn’t the Dean he knew. “You aren’t my Dean. Neither of you know me. I am from an alternate universe and I lost my Sam and Dean. I’m trying to find them.”
