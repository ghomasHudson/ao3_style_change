"We don't really know how many stones Thanos currently have. The space stone is the only one we’re sure of. It is possible that he acquired a few more already. Also, we don't really want to play with these stones. They're not created to be wielded by any human." Bruce said waringly.
That created an even more tense and awkward atmosphere. Between a fuming super soldier and an injured archer, no one really knew what to do. It kind of helped that Clint was too shocked to say anything or else it would have resulted to an actual fight. Something that they don't need right now.
“Cap! On your left!” Sam was in better shape than most of them. He was in the air and shouting out warnings on their comm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Any permanent damage or injury?” Steve asked the question that was bugging most of them. Natasha’s lips twitched upward and formed a miniscule smile.
Logically, Steve knows that he was to blame for their fall out. While Zemo had a hand in it, he was the one who kept the truth from Tony in the first place.
“You also have a concussion, Missy. Go have a seat at the jeep. We’ll just finish up here.” The engineer said, patting her shoulder before moving to Vision who was behind her. Wanda was confused by the dismissal and instruction but followed nonetheless.
“Hey, man. Are you okay? You’re a bit jumpy and not to mention pale.” Sam reached out to pat him on his shoulder but the genius let out an involuntary flinch which halted his movement. He was frowning deeply, his hand hovering in the air as he stared at Tony in confusion. They stared at each other for a minute longer. They only snapped out of it when the coffee machine beeped. Startled, Tony averted his eyes, took a clean mug from the counter, and poured his coffee.
"Just.. Listen, Tony. The big guy likes Steve so please don't hurt him? I don't know how he would take it if he's favorite Captain is hurt."
“This is important, Avengers. Possibly a HYDRA level threat. They are to be stopped immediately. Is that clear?” The leader of Germany said, his voice strict and held no room for argument. The team nodded in understanding.
“It might as well be the first step of clearing our name.”
“He must have a good reason for doing so.” The ant themed hero threw out, though his tone indicated hesitancy.
“Oh! Why didn’t you say so, birdbrain? You could have told me 5 minutes ago and not let me suffer by enduring your presence for that long! Dum-E! Get Clint’s arrows. Yes, that-No!! Not that you big sack of bolts! From the other box! Yes! Finally! Thank you!” The genius exclaimed with an exasperated sigh. He handed the stack of arrows to the archer who accepted it with a big grin. Almost like a kid on Christmas Day.
“Okay. All done, Barnes. You can come to me anytime when it starts acting up again.” Before he can second guess himself, Tony hesitatingly reaches out to pat Bucky’s metal arm. The billionaire jerked in surprise when the soldier caught his hand in an iron grip. Tony let out a nervous laugh as he tried to pry his hand off because that metal arm can surely hold a tight grip. He failed to hide the wince as he felt shots of pain.
The Rogues had no idea what to expect, certainly not this. They were all in disbelief hearing the announcement the genius had made.
“Okay. I’m not really here to plead for their case. I guess what I’m trying to say is that the accords are not a bad idea. It needs more work and a major rewrite but the potential and idea is there.”
“Of course. It’s a matter of global security, after all. Do you guys have more information about the threat? We only received little to no information aside from
coming here. ETA is 5 minutes. You can ask him then, Agent.” That made Steve jolt in surprise. He was starting to lose hope of seeing the genius again after learning that he’s not in the armor. Not piloting the suit and just sending it for FRIDAY to control is way of saying that he doesn’t want anything to do with them-
His heart fucking ached and broke when he saw Steve Rogers.
The silence in the workshop carried on for almost half an hour. It was uncomfortable and suffocating that Tony just wanted to squirm on his seat by the end of it. Bucky was just staring at him with a level of ferocity and sharpness that made the billionaire nervous and uncomfortable. The razor-sharp eyes traveled throughout his body, mostly lasting on his neck, arm and chest (or reactor as it sits on his chest and displayed through the hole of his shirt). When he finally screws the latch shut, Tony can’t help but feel relieved. He has nothing against the super soldier but the way he’s currently acting is making Tony incredibly restless.
“Oh, no! Clint’s down! He was within range of the small bomb!” Scott yelled over the comm. That definitely affected the fluidity of the team. Clint was their marksman and eye. He was the one who pointed and called out positions and locations. He was supposed to look out for every member of the team. He sees where the enemies’ numbers are weakest and most fragile. Clint going down caused a strain in their teamwork. Even with Sam in the air, it will be hard for him to give positions as he is more effective as aerial support.
“But? I hear a but in there and I’m not too sure what to feel about it.”
"What about the Time Stone then?" Sam asked, looking towards the Sorcerer who huffed.
“I just want to tell you that I’m in love with you.” That effectively shut the genius up. What? His mind couldn’t process what he just heard. How could he possibly? After everything?
“Boss is not in the armor is what I mean, Captain. There is no point talking since you will not be heard.”
Vision and Wanda guarded each other’s back as they eliminated as much agents as they could. Sam was circling them from above, calling out warnings as he shot down the enemies who got too close. Barnes, Natasha and Clint were a force of their own as the three assassins danced around each other with grace that would make any dancer envious. Scott was ant size and disabling weapons here and there. Iron Man and Steve were back to back as they always were during previous missions.
“How could you- What about S-Siberia? The Accords? B-Bucky? How could you be in-”
That was, unfortunately, a big mistake.
"Thank, God. I thought I'll be subjected to another lengthy lecture again. I swear. That lady can scold someone's ear off." The genius exhaled. A memory of the last scolding he got from the old lady made him shudder visibly.
They were all gathered at one of the Palace’s lounge room in Wakanda, simultaneously agreeing to watch the press conference that Tony Stark had called for not one hour ago. The conference was being broadcasted live on almost all news channel around the world which means that the content and purpose was important. Most likely about the future of the Avengers seeing as more than half of the team are on the run and are fugitives. It’s only been a week since the break out from the raft and the world is still constantly asking what’s going to happen next.
They just wanted to make sure he wouldn’t hurt Steve. That he wasn’t destroying something good because go figures! The only thing Tony Stark is good at is destroying.
“60, you say? Okay, we can work with that. Everyone. Suit up. We’re moving out in 30 minutes.”
“How did you escape?” The level headed Black Widow asked, her face shifting to a more neutral expression. Zemo let out a loud laugh.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have all the answers. They would have to ask Banner and Thor once they’re here.” Rhodes told T’Challa who nodded half-heartedly. The King knew they don’t know much about the threat, Tony realized.
of all people but he respected his decision. He gave Tony a pat on the shoulder and left.
It didn’t take long. They were losing.
“Just to be clear, sir. We’re to investigate the suspicious dealings that are happening around Southern Europe. Find out every detail necessary, including who they work with and their motives. If confirmed that they are HYDRA or any large group similar, we engage and stop them immediately. Is that correct, sir?” Steve asked as he browsed over the report which mostly contains sightings, past locations and pictures. Seemingly satisfied, the US President leaned back on his seat and gave him a firm nod.
“Wait, what are you doing here? I doubt you’re here to ask for permission. I’m not your keeper.”
“This base must contain a lot of top grade secret because the place is heavily guarded. It’s a wonder how the villagers didn’t notice anything.” The former Winter Soldier said
“We can’t let anyone escape! They might harm the villagers!” Was Captain America’s order as he continued on punching and tackling his way through the bodies of HYDRA Agents.
The Avengers lost a vital member of the team and its showing. What’s worse? The gap he left behind was too big for someone else to fill.
Tony and Rhodey was held back by T’Challa for a brief discussion about the Accords. It lasted for a couple of minutes. At the time they finished, the council room was mostly empty, aside from Steve who apparently stayed behind. This was how he caught up to them.
“Kitty Kat.” The genius snarked back with no real heat, his lips in a familiar mischievous smirk. The royal shook his head at his playful antics, his lips transforming to an even more genuine smile. The King didn’t bite his attempt of banter. He proceeded on greeting the other people he was with before he led them inside the palace.
“Seems like you folks are lost without me.” The genius said off handedly, opening his jeep and diving back inside. He resurfaced with a first aid kit in hand.
“Oh, right. You weren’t in a relationship with Stark. But you were pining after him.” At Clint’s words, the super soldier groaned.
“Yeah. Some kind of recon for Fury. I Will be gone for 2 days at most.” He said as he leaned at one of the work tables.
“I’m not your mother, you ass!”
"If I'm up for it? Why, Platypus, it's almost as if you don't know me at all! Of course I'm up for it! Gimme!"
“The Sling Ring, while a powerful mystical object, has its limitation. I need to visualize a clear image of my destination. While I’ve been to Wakanda before, I hadn’t actually entered the capital.” Said the former surgeon as he shrugged at the annoyed look the genius threw at him.
“Effective immediately, I am officially resigning as both an Avenger and Iron Man.”
Steve thought as he tried to fend off some more agents but they were just too many.
"The rabbit is right. The stones cannot be destroyed that simply." Thor contributed, looking much more solemn than he was before. His grip on Storm breaker had tightened. It was still a bit weird for Tony to see the God of Thunder with a weapon other than his hammer
“My arm is acting up. Fix it.” The super soldier grumbled, his voice rough and guttural. Tony raised an eyebrow at him but did as he was told. He gingerly opened the latch on the arm and immediately went to work as he dove deep on its circuits.
That’s what Tony is hearing.
He couldn’t stay much longer in his lab without people asking questions. There’s also that protocol that would alert Pepper if he stayed on blackout for more than 76 hours without resurfacing. If it reaches Pepper, it will surely reach Steve and he can’t let that happen. Tony doesn’t have the heart to tell his boyfriend that it was his best friend that caused his setback.
“Where is he, FRIDAY? Is he o-okay? Is Tony h-hurt?!” The super soldier, panic started rising as he struggled to keep his focus.
“Clint.” Their captain’s tone held authority and finality. It was a warning. The archer didn’t take lightly to that. He rolled his eyes.
“Uhh, Tones? You did tell T’Challa that we’re coming. Right?” Rhodes asked, his tone held apprehension. At the implication, Peter let out a sound similar to a squeak.
“You were involved with Stark?” The other man out of time asked, surprise coloring his expression. Not out of disgust, but out of genuine curiosity.
It surprised Steve. It caught him completely off guard. He was almost certain that Tony would be angry or at least indifferent with him after everything. Amused was not something he expected.
The span between the village and the base is roughly 30 kilometers, too close for their comfort and liking. With the camouflage setting in the place, the jet landed in between the two locations. A sort of safety precaution. It was around noon when they set off to work. The Clint and Bucky had went to do some surveilling while Scott, Vision and Wanda went to check the nearby area. Sam stayed behind on the jet to serve as their eye on the sky while Steve and Natasha (who’s the only one who can speak Italian) went off to the town to talk to the mayor, An hour later, they regrouped. The grim looks on everyone’s faces were an indication that they all had come up to the same conclusion. The base is active.
“Of course. As if anything can stop me from coming home to you, Tony. I’ll fight death herself if she stands in my way. I won’t let anyone or anything come between us right now. Especially now that I know that there’s a high chance that my feelings are reciprocated.”  That made Tony flush. He was thankful that they were hugging or else Steve would have seen his red face.
“According to Red Wing’s sensors, there are about 60 heat signatures inside and within the base’s vicinity.”
“Yes. Now stop hovering, you worrywart. You are worse than Cap, I swear. Doc already released me for fieldwork yesterday.” The archer snorted as he warmed up, stretching his over rested muscles. The mentioned super soldier rolled his eyes at the implication.
world.
“Shut u-up!”
Tony wants to believe that the incoming threat was what makes him so uneasy. Truthfully? A large portion of his mind tells him that it’s the fact that he’s facing them,
“H-He did. Wow. I didn’t think he’d..” Scott trailed off, not knowing how to finish his line of thought.
The exact same thing had happened in Lisbon. They left empty handed and now was heading to their last destination, which is somewhere in Umbria, Italy. During the flight, they started discussing other plans. They can’t exactly do what they did in Catalonia and Lisbon. Those were in unpopulated areas. Meanwhile, the Umbria base is near a small village which is inhabited by at least 150 people. They couldn’t risk it. They have to take the fight away from them no matter what. The team were pretty much hoping that it would end up the same as the previous two bases.
Steve wasn’t faring any better, health wise. He, like Wanda, was sporting a concussion. He was also within range of the second bomb. He has bruised ribs and a dislocated shoulder. Seeing as they were being overpowered, Steve hastily called for them to regroup.
“That’s what I’m here for actually. Thank you for bringing it up.” Her voice was pure ice that he needed to suppress a shudder.
“On that note, I will not be withdrawing the funding and donation of the Maria Stark Foundation that are directed to any Avenger cause in the past, that includes property damage funding, rescue operations, financial supports, reconstruction and medical assistances. Those will continue. The difference is that the scope of the Foundation will be larger and more global. It will not be solely just Avenger related. This time, it will be directed to all kinds of tragedy, incidents and emergencies. This aims to help a far greater amount of people.” There was nothing but sounds of writing, scribbling and camera flashes around him. Tony took a few breathes before continuing.
Silence.
“The doctors are allowing visitors if you guys want to go visit him later.” At that statement, the debriefing started. It lasted for almost 2 hours before their captain closed it. Before leaving the room, Colonel Rhodes caught Sam’s elbow before he could leave.
“He’s definitely concussed. He’s barely responding at all. He also have a few bruised and cracked ribs. And from the looks of it, he has internal bleeding as well. A few broken limbs too and a sprained ankle. We’ll need to bring him to the hospital. Wilson, Romanoff, carry him to the jeep.” The genius declared, moving unto Wanda who was closest to him. She startled but made no further move to step back or away. Tony immediately set to work, expertly cleaning the bullet grazes before swiftly wrapping her arms with bandage. He done it under record time that the others needed to blink to process it.
Turns out, it wasn’t just 60 agents. There were more. A
“Who are all coming?” Sam asked.
“Heritage Stories? Tones..? What? What’s happening? What are they saying?” was Rhodey’s question as he stood up and slowly walked towards Tony. He eyed the two Asgardians cautiously, leaning towards his best friend as if gearing to jump in front of him at the first sign of attack.
“You’re asking me what I think you deserve, Tony? I think.. No. I know for a fact that you deserve everything. The world. The universe. You deserve everything good and wonderful the world has to offer. And I’m sorry that you didn’t get it. It’s fucking awful and shitty. What happened to you.. Because you deserve the world but the world does not deserve you.” It was probably the complete and pure rawness of Steve’s voice that got to him. Or the genuine and softness in his azure eyes. Or the complete honesty of his statement. Whatever it was, Tony was almost reduced to tears. He bit back a sob as he looked at Steve who had chosen to metaphorically strip himself bare in front of him. This was the first time he had seen the super soldier so open and exposed. He had always been the kind of person to set up walls and barriers. Since the day Tony met him, he had never seen him this vulnerable.
Like a switch, with just that one statement, all hell broke loose.
“I have to ask. Do we have a time limit? I mean, there’s not really much to go on with these reports but previous sightings. Searching for a lead may take a while. A week if we’re lucky. If not, it may last a month, even more. I figure that you don’t want us to lurk around Europe that long, especially if most of the Avengers are going.” The red head spy asked the most anticipated question that had bothered everyone in her team since they received the mission report. The panel exchanged looks through the screen before the Sokovian leader answered.
“W-What? You must be bluffing-”
“Bring up a list of all my properties. Scratch off all places that are unlivable.”
“I get Spider-man and T’Challa being unavailable but why aren’t you coming?” The counselor’s tone wasn’t accusatory but rather a curious one.
"Have ya been listenin’? That's a great advice, lady, but as these idiots have been tellin’ ya all, the infinity stones are the most powerful stones in the universe. Don't think they can be destroyed that easily or someone else had already did. Don't ya think?" Came the deeply accented voice of the raccoon. Rocket, was it? Tony still finds it hard to believe that a furry animal can talk but then again, with everything that they had seen and experienced over the years, a talking raccoon isn't really on the list of Top 10 craziest.
“I know he’s mad at me. He has every right to be. I just wanted to-”
"O-Okay.. I'll see you when you get back."
“Goddamit. I missed every shot? I must be seriously out of practice.”
don’t know where he is. That
An hour later, Rhodey and Natasha entered the gym as Steve and Sam were just finishing up their sparring. Sam was sweating heavily as he slumped down on the mat while Steve was, of course, still unruffled. There were no clear signs of exhaustion as he made his way towards the benches to grab a drink. He gave the two a smile and a nod as he saw them approach.
Not long after, Tony was done. The engineer gave his bicep a squeeze before walking off towards the jeep. The two confused super soldier looked at each other, shrugged before continued on following Tony.
“Tony, look.. I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve what I did-”
“Well, that’s what you get for being a goddamn workaholic. Seriously though, we barely see you anymore around here because you’re always working. That must be painful for Steve because you just barely have time for him too. I mean, being an Avenger, the face of SI, and head of R & D, you surely have no time for yourself, much less for your boyfriend.” Sam’s words felt like knives slicing his heart and gut. It hurts to think that even his teammate would assume that he won’t make time for his lover. He expected it from the media but not his friends. He felt like his stomach dropped.
Tony shouldn’t have tried to provoke her but he was just tired. Goddamn tired of all the threats to his person. He already had to initiate the blackout protocol twice in a week. His insomnia came back full force, his panic attacks grew worse, and he hadn’t seen his boyfriend for days. Not for a lack of trying on Steve’s part. The blond tried to coax him out of the workshop but Tony couldn’t because he’s afraid he’ll have a panic attack in front of him. That or he’ll break down. He’s barely holding on. The sight of Steve (lovely, warm, and handsome Steve) would break the dams. All the walls he desperately put up the past weeks would crumble down and he’ll surely break down in his lover’s arms. And Tony couldn’t do that. Not to Steve. The super-soldier would be swelled with guilt. These are his people who are breaking his lover. Steve wouldn’t take that lightly and Tony didn’t want him to need to choose between him and his friends.
“Boss, the Vision, Spiderman and the Colonel are already assembled at the Common Room. They are inquiring on what is happening.” That made the genius stop in his tracks. He took a deep breath as he tried to relax his breathing and frantic heartbeat. Inhale Exhale. Inhale Exhale. A minute later, he stood up and saved all his works.
“Kind of? He said something about guests from space and that they’re friendly? Other than that, he told me nothing. He just told me to get a jet and pick you guys up.”
“I’m sorry, my friends, but this is a battle that we might not be strong enough to win. Thanos is simply impossible to kill.” The God of Thunder said, causing dread and disbelief to swim around the room. He had on such a lost and beaten expression. It was unbecoming especially for someone so courageous like Thor. His mood effectively sucked out the hope on everyone else around them. Tony, while feeling a bit uncertain, refuse to give up just like that.
knows where he is. That man is truly a useful asset, as both Iron Man and Tony Stark. A pity on your part. The people who would pick him up, though, they might as well have won the lottery, don’t you think?” Steve saw red. He launched himself at the Sokovian who was immediately protected by surrounding HYDRA Agents.
“Zemo.” Was the one word reply of the Captain, his voice dropped down to a cold, furious tone, almost a growl, that none of his team had really heard before. They threw their leader confused and hesitant side glances.
is what making really him so agitated. Not the Accords panel. Not the threat. Not the potentially world ending catastrophe.
? Why isn’t Stark in the suit?
“I’m not sure what you guys are expecting. More than half of the team are hailed fugitives under the Accords, Colonel Rhodes is just starting Physical Therapy, Vision is still learning, and I’m-”  The billionaire choked on his last word. He coughed harshly a few times. He held on the edge of the podium and needed a few seconds to regain composure.
“Yeah. What can we do to defeat him?” Sam asked. A defeated look enveloped the prince. A look that horrified the entire room. Not once had Thor looked like that. Especially not before a fight. He’s the type who would recklessly and bravely charge head on, no matter who the opponent is. Anyone but Thanos, it seems to Tony.
me what? I swear to God, Steve. If you’re hiding something else from me, I’ll-”
“You said your wings aren’t functioning smoothly. That there’s some delay on the right wing that hampers with your flying. That’s probably why you weren’t able to fly as fluidly as you always do.” Steve reasoned. The veteran had brought up the technical problem to him two weeks ago. They were planning on having it fixed a few days ago but the sudden mission delayed that. It was urgent.
During the rather short walk, he felt the others give him hesitant side glances. Now, being this near, they stopped trying to be subtle about it and settled with openly looking at him. They also stood a bit closer to him, as if wanting to trap him inside a protective circle. Normally, Tony would have berated them. He would have glared at them and tell them to fuck off. He doesn’t need to be coddled. But given the situation and circumstances, he felt himself relaxing. Tony was surprised when he found himself appreciating the closeness and security.
“Maybe I’m just letting you cop a feel because I’m that nice.”
They stopped in front of a large door that the genius assumed would lead to the council room. Standing in front of it, Tony swear he can feel his heart drumming loudly in his chest. That one door is literally the only thing that separates him and Cap. He’s going to see him after almost 2 years. The billionaire’s not sure if he’s ready. Unfortunately for him, his companions seem to realize this as well.
“Sudden evacuation will raise questions and also cause more time. Not to mention that it might alert HYDRA of what we’re planning.” The red head shrugged, though a frown on her feature indicates that he doesn’t agree with the mayor’s decision. The scowl on their Captain’s face says the same thing.
Tony felt like his heart was physically breaking. The pain and betrayal were burning deep within him. Those conversations with his best friends hurt more than his time in Afghanistan. They just assumed that he was doing this to hurt Steve. Goddamn. It fucking hurt.
Tony sighed. Steve’s two best friends had already given him the talk. That’s probably the last of it. They had their fun. He could finally let his guard down.
“Initiate Blackout Protocol.”
“Logically, I know. It’s just that I can’t help but feel guilty. If only I had been fast enough, I would have caught him.” Sam’s tone held regret and shame as he watch his hands clench and unclench on his lap.
The blond managed to rasp out, his voice almost cracking.
“How’s your wings treating you, by the way?”
“Stark!”
“Rogers.” Was his curt reply. He’s afraid that if he said more than that, he’ll give away much more than he wants to. Not with Steve looking at him like that. Not with Steve looking at him like he cares for him. Like he wants him. Like he’s longing for him. Because that’s preposterous. Absolutely ridiculous because Steve was a lot of things. In love with him wasn’t one of them.
“Are the mission details clear?” President Ellis asked, his calculating eyes was going over every Avenger as they all gone over the mission report that were delivered to them that same morning.
The Wakandan Jet landed a couple of feet from them. The aircraft’s door slid open as the Princess of Wakanda waltzed down and stopped midway. The royal gave them a mischievous smirk as she beckoned them to enter the aircraft. The group followed without questions.
“Believe us when we say this, Ms. Romanoff. Our source is to be trusted. They know what they are doing. And they have no reason to sabotage this mission. Take our word for it.” The US President stated, his tone held pure conviction. The Avengers knew that that was the end of that line of questioning. That the panel will no longer reveal anything regarding their ‘source’. Albeit uncertain and far from satisfied, they chose to drop it.
“We’ll talk after, okay? Just for now, I want you to know that I love you. You don’t even have to say it back. I love you, Tony Stark. I really fuckin’ do.” The last bit of his sentence was laced heavily with his Brooklyn accent that it caused warmth to travel throughout his body. Fuck. Hearing the guy he’s been in love for years with say that he love him back is making him dizzy and light headed. This is something that he’s been wishing and hoping for. Now that it’s actually happening, Tony isn’t sure how he’s supposed to react or what he needs to say.
Stark shook his head, glaring at him. “No. I’m
as he did so, eyes closing for a brief second. His breathing picked up, but Steve acted like he hadn’t noticed as he picked the man up from the ground and deposited him on the toilet seat like a sack of potatoes. Stark leaned up against the counter next to him with a groan.
He didn’t really understand what the man meant, but the rawness of his voice and the way his hands had clenched into fists were enough to tell him that he shouldn’t push. “Okay. Can you walk?”
The look on Stark’s face told him that the man very much doubted that, but he rolled his eyes with a forced bit of nonchalance and staggered out of the bathroom. He made it about as far as the opposite wall before he started to go down again, whatever strength he’d mustered gone.
„We made a mistake by underestimating them. They nocked out at least two of us. We should look them up with the others“ Peter justified himself.
„Do you think they can see which one is one of them or do they relay on finding out who is who by observing behavior and asking questions like we do?“ Harley thought out laud.
He jumped on them and throw a wooden fist directly and Peter face who caught it with ease. The alien seemed surprised but didn‘t stopped. He charged again and Peter pushed Harley father away while moving out of the way. It was as if he knew what the Alien was going to do next.
“What the hack did just happen?” Sam asked when the emergency lights turned one and dimed the bridge with scary blue light.
“Thank you” Tony said smiling and jumped up. He pressed a kiss on Steve’s lips before leaving the Holodeck, leaving Steve alone with the reminders of the picnic. It was kind of a habit of Tony to leave in a hurry.
“Surprise, I found a way around this annoying program built by my father out of some misguided affection towards you. I can finally set everyone free” the Robot said and started to squeeze. Steve gagged, desperate for air, and tried to kick the machine away but without success. His hands fumbled to loosen Ultron’s grip but he grew weaker with every second. Ultron’s smile was the last thing he saw before his eyes begun to fall shut. A wire sound appeared and suddenly Steve could breath again. Sweet and cool air field his lungs with relive. In front of him stood Tony , right arm stretched out and a blue light similar to the arc reactor on his palm. Next to Steve laid Ultron, a smoking hole in his chest and eyes flickering.
“Yeah, everything’s fine” the other man said and through a knowing smile at Tony who in return looked as innocent as the night. At least that answered the question if Tony had told someone of their relationship. If Bruce knew than Rhodey and Pepper knew as well.
“You aren’t listening, right?” Tony asked pouting.
“Bad” Steve responded fearing for what was going to come.
„Fuck, they control the entire ship“ Peter cursed.
“We don’t know for sure. Our first priority is getting out of here. It’s just the three of you?” Steve wanted to know. Only three appeared not enough, seeing that they were in an AIM faculty in AIM territory.”Sending an army down here, that we don’t have by the way, would only end in a big fight. Best case scenario would be just losing you guys and one third of the crew. Coming down in a small group appear to be the better call to me” Carol explained on their way out, passing multiple unconscious or dead AIM soldiers and scientist.
“What happened?” Killian angrily asked one of the men who looked confused.
“Are that…” he begun and Tony ended his sentence for him: “The stars you’d see from Manhattan at this time of the year. Without the light pollution of course. The closest we can get home right now.”
“Captain!” someone asked from behind and Steve turned around.
“Wilson?” he asked the man who started to tip with a for him unknown speed on the computer in front of him, eyebrows knitted together.
„But how?“ MJ asked.
“And why would that stop us?” If anything, that just makes the situation even more tempting” a sickening sweet voice laughed and the man and woman oppose to Steve stepped aside to make space for a very human looking man. Steve cursed when he saw the AIM symbol on his chest.
Fast he followed him to the cell with the glass front. Inside Tony sat on the floor, back resting against the wall and one leg pressed against his chest. When he saw Steve he jumped up and sprinted the short way to the glass wall.
Peter jumped and with his new powers stuck to the ceiling while the fake Peter below him got blasted by Harley.
“Give me a minute” he said already sounding better than when they started their escape.
“Ultron came alive and plans now to kill us all” Bruce summed the situation up. The man had woken up a few minutes ago, pale but ok, and was now sitting on one of the few still intact chairs.
“Who are you?” Clint asked, his gun aimed direct at the men’s face.
„Hey, what‘s up?“ he asked and both Harley and Peter started to talk at the same time.
„Good. So, do you remember a few weeks ago, when we landed on that small planet shortly before the Ultron incident?“ he asked and Harley nodded.
„Why are you so small?“ Storm asked mistrusting.
“If they would think that than they don’t know you” Steve argued.
“I have a wired feeling about this” she whispered and stepped out first, followed by Clint who both had their weapons raised. Steve didn’t fully understood where the danger should be, they had permission to land and came with peaceful intentions, but he still kept his right hand hovering above his blazer. Tony, Janet and Fassamau did the same while Bruce seemed to become more uncomfortable with every passing second. The scientist never carried a weapon, he valued live to much to even keep the possibility to end one with him. Steve on the other hand valued the live of his crew to much to not keep one.
“If that is all, how about we leave so we can go home” Steve offered and stood up followed by Tony who softly groaned by the fast movement.
“Yeah, Tony worked his magic” Steve responded and clapped Tony on the back, who didn’t realize a thing, to engaged in the computer in front of him.
Suddenly the monitor reading his heart frequency went wild the same moment the orange glow reached Fassamaus eyes. The shine made his eyes look unnatural inhuman. The scientists started to jell and stepped away from the ensign. The young man started screaming again, his chest bolting uo and then he exploded.
“Tony, what did you do?” Steve yelled at the man who immediately took a step back.
“Captain, you need to get down to deck two” she informed him cold and Steve tensed.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked and stepped closer.
“The boss man is not here. He left with the two smaller humans to meet other humans in the lab” Rocket explained and griped a wrench to hit seemingly randomly a pip.
„I‘m getting into my role. Our ship is taken, everyone we know is imprisoned and we are probably going to die. I also plan one faking a limp“ she explained proud and Peter smiled. She really was awesome.
„That was awesome. I mean you fighting, not that Groot was replaced by some shapeshifting alien. And Rocket probably as well“ Harley said as he stepped next to Peter to get a better look on the Alien.
“It’s not over, father. You can’t kill me. I am not done yet” he laughed, barley understandable with all the mechanic quirks.
„Their communication must be awful if they haven‘t realized he‘s missing“ Peter thought.
„Does that mean you lay eggs and shoot ropes out of your ass?“ Harley asked honestly curious.
„It has to look like we lost a fight. Come one man. I can take it“ Harley tried to reassure Peter but the other boy still wasn‘t used to his new found power and feared he would hurt his friend.
“But first I have to tell Anthony that I am sorry for attacking him. He was irresponsible and I excepted better from him but that is no excuse for what I did. I attacked a friend” Thor said remorseful.
“The Holodeck?” Steve asked. He had thought they maybe were on their way to the shuttles. Shuttle sex, like car sex but in space. But Tony obviously had other plans.
Steve was the first to catch himself and laid a hand on Natasha’s back.
Only two hours later the two were back on the ship shortly followed by Tony’s group. Both Tony and Bruce carried backs with parts and Thor had some big metal object thrown over his big shoulder.
„I need to vomit“ Harley suddenly yelled and begun to run.
Shortly before they reached the docking point MJ begun to cry and Peter stopped in shock.
“Oxygen” Natasha nodded sharp.
“Romanov is right. We have bigger problems than Starks skin care. We need to find a class M planet to refill our resources, find out where we are and contact Shield to inform them of the AIM ships in our territory. Rhodes, Danvers fly ahead until we locate a planet but don’t waste any fuel, slide sometimes if necessary” Steve ordered and then pressed another button on his chair: “Doctor Strange, how is it looking at the med bay?”
“No. Just initiate the blackout.”
“Had the guests arrived?” It was Dr. Strange who asked.
“Also, if I may interject, please refrain from causing too much property damage. We are aware that it is almost inevitable but please try to minimize and control it. I don’t think I need to remind you this but I will still say it anyway. Always prioritize civilian life. Keep the fighting away from large or populated areas.” The current president of Italy said, his brows were furrowed. His tone sounded almost concern which didn’t really surprise anyone as the Italian leader was always a soft hearted person. A firm leader but a soft person.
Not trusting his own voice, the genius can only nod. Because really. He agrees with him.
And he was looking directly at him, his eyes swimming with so much emotion that it almost knocked Tony off his feet.
“N-No.. I-”
"He could destroy life in a scale hitherto undreamt of." Dr. Strange cut him off, interjecting himself on the conversation. It surprised him. He almost forgot that it wasn't just him and Bruce in the room. That everyone was here.
"No can do." Dr. Strange said, firm and hard.
"There's no telling. He already has the power of the space stone. That already makes him the strongest creature in the universe. If he gets his hands on all 6 stones, Tony..."
“Yes, Clint. We’re very happy. Thank you.” The blond super soldier chuckled amusedly while the genius in his arms could only snort. Around the three are the rest of their team whose majority are still in shock and trying to process the news they were told.
“That’s actually what we’re worried about, Tony. You didn’t seduce Steve just so you could sleep with him, right? This isn’t just about sex for you, right? Because I swear, if you’re going to hurt-” The red-haired assassin’s voice dropped to a cold tone as she trailed off with her statement. Tony failed to suppress the shiver that climbed his spine at her threat which the super-soldier felt, being so close. Hoping to ease his lover, Steve squeezed the genius’s hips, offering his comfort. His message was received as the smaller man started to relax on his arms again.
“He’s right, Sam. It’s not your fault.” Steve said, not missing a beat.
“God,
“Shit. Cap. They blew up the jet.” Sam cursed on his comm while he maneuvered in the air as he dodged the bullets coming his way. The veteran swooped down as he started shooting at the stray agents who bombed the jet. He took them down easily. Hearing Sam’s announcement, a few of the Avengers let out their own curses as they struggled on their own fights.
Tony stood in his place for about three minutes, staring in space. Not moving, afraid even to breathe. His face has gone snow white and his hands trembled. He was kind of surprised that he could still stand since he felt like his knees were jello. When it seemed he wasn’t moving, FRIDAY called out to him.
Hope that maybe they could still fix this. That
As if a beacon of hope, Iron Man’s arrival sparked a fire in the Avengers. They all started fighting even harder than they were before. The miracle in the form of a man in an almost indestructible armor drove them to work better and stronger. It ignited something in them. It’s almost as if something snapped in them.
"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. JARVIS, Ultron, Bruce, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another." Tony declared, his mind swimming and gears turning. This could work. This could actually work.
The tech guys provided by the government were good but not as creative or brilliant as Tony Stark. The genius always knew what the team needed, no question asked. He always did give them the best toys and gadgets. While the tech the government provide them were good, they were below in terms of quality as they were used to.
“As you know, I’ve been in forced isolation for years so forgive me for not knowing. But where is
“Good. No. It’s great actually. No delays whatsoever. Not to mention the extra upgrades your tech guy added. Tell them thank you for me.” That got a soft and fond smile from the active soldier.
“What other ‘good’ reason is there aside from being a selfish prick?” The blond bit back. Natasha slapped the archer behind the head which made him grumble and glare.
“You need to try harder for Steve, Tony. He’s probably the best thing that will ever happen to you. Don’t waste this one chance with him. Okay? He deserves better.”
“What the hell?” muttered by a dumbfounded Clint Barton. Around him were the rest of the Rogue Avengers, all in similar state of shock as the archer.
Tony was visibly hesitating. The way he was biting his lips and shifting his weight was clear indicators of that. The genius knew the right thing to do. He already decided that he’ll tell them. Though, it still is understandable that he’s nervous. He is about to reveal a huge secret. One that can change the course of the world.
“No. D-Don’t call anyone.”
He wanted to listen to his team right now. He wanted to will himself to calm down and think more rationally because his impulsiveness and recklessness can very well sabotage not just the mission, but end up with someone getting even more hurt.
"Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it." Was the impassive voice of The Vision. That sucked out the energy out of everyone in the room. This early out in the war and yet they're already looking forward to losing one of them. What more, it was Vision who had to be sacrificed. The being who Tony had come to see as one of his children. Tony's heart ached painfully. He couldn't deal with losing Vision too. Not after JARVIS.
“You do realize that in order for that to happen, we need to both survive. Right?” was his muffled reply as he laid his head on the crooks of Steve’s neck, inhaling his scent. With the lack of space, he felt the rumbles of the blonde’s chest when he chuckled.
The Avengers were too busy dealing with the agents that they almost failed to notice the Sokovian was preparing to retreat. They only realized when a small jet seemingly appear out of thin air, most probably in stealth mode. Zemo and about three or four of his men boarded the jet and took off. Steve saw the aircraft before it suspended and made a break to it. He run towards it but was slowed down when the jet used its gun to fire at the super soldier. Steve was forced to dodge and take cover, giving the jet ample time to create more distance between them.
"Tony's right. If we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts." Bruce commented, also deep in thought.
"C-Cap.. What—"
“Do we have an approximate count of HYDRA agents?” Steve asked, looking at Sam who nodded as he brought up a screen which displayed Red Wing’s findings.
jokes, right? They wouldn’t really hurt Tony if he looked at Steve wrong? Maybe that’s the thing. He has a track record of trusting the wrong people which makes him extremely wary and paranoid at this point. That’s why he’s reacting much worse than he should.
“I will only say this once so listen good, Stark. If you hurt Stevie, I will use this arm to hurt you. Either to break your bones, snap your neck, or better yet, to rip your reactor out of your goddamn body. Ya hear me?” His Brooklyn accent was prominent during the last bit of his statement. The genius visibly shuddered as his eyes widened in real, genuine fear. Tony nodded, too scared to come up with a snarky remark or even formulate a proper response. Seemingly satisfied, the super-soldier gave his hand one final hard squeeze before he let go and stalked out of the lab.
“I said initiate the blackout, FRIDAY. I swear to God, I will force you out of the lab’s system and initiate the protocol myself in a way that even you wouldn’t get in.”
“The better question is when, to be honest. I escaped that prison about two weeks ago. My break out was long planned and orchestrated. It was hard but being one of HYDRA’s top agent, I was given the proper resources for my escape. I’m essential for our comeback, after all. They can’t have me staying in that jail for too long.” Both SHIELD agents gave each other side glances, easily realizing that they were thinking the same thing. Gather Intel and information as much as possible.
An awkward silence settled between them. A silence no one knew how to break. Clint and Wanda was busy glaring at Tony who was trying his best to ignore them. Natasha, Sam, and Rhodey didn’t know how to bring back the civil atmosphere. Steve looked sad and brooding. Peter, Scott, Shuri, Wong, and Strange felt awkward and imposing. Vision was impassive. Barnes looked like he rather not be there at all. T’Challa feigned a look and air of authority but he too was a bit lost. The Dora Milaje just didn’t care. They were just there to look after the King and the Princess. Maybe prevent a fight or two.
“I’m sorry, Cap. I know he used to be your ex-boyfriend and all but you agree with me!” The national icon spluttered at his teammate’s choice of word. He could feel the warmth climbing to his face.
He didn’t need to voice this out. Tony gave his best friend’s left arm a reassuring squeeze before throwing him a shaky but determined smile. He knew that what he wanted to say was received and conveyed fully by that simple gesture. Rhodey was hesitant to leave him alone with
(See the end of the chapter for
“Kronos? Hyper- That’s Greek. That’s- I cannot.. Are you really..?”
“Tones?” That snapped Tony back to attention. He blinked a few times before a somewhat horrified look wash over his face as he realized that most of everyone’s attention was now on him. It immediately morphed to a more guarded one as he cleared his throat. That made everyone completely shift their focus towards him.
“Have you been waiting for little, old me? Can’t say I’m not flattered for having the attention of such a beautiful lady but as you know, I’m already taken.” Tony glided past the redhead but stopped when slender fingers circled on his bicep on a firm, strong grip. The mechanic looked back and almost wanted to flinch at the cool and sharp glint on her steely eyes. The assassin hadn’t looked at him with that much hostility since she was his assistant.
“The panel wants us to go to Europe to investigate further. It seemed big because they want every Avenger available to come.” The spy commented, a hand on her hip. Steve looked up at her at that in surprise.
“The base is certainly active. We’ve seen a few agents guarding the area.” Clint said, his face on a scowl.
.” That one sentence was loaded and filled with so much emotion that Tony just wanted to run away back to Rhodey and the others. He’s afraid of where this conversation was headed.
” That caused the archer to snicker, delighted that he had managed to catch the genius completely off guard. The billionaire can only glare at the former agent as he placed a hand over his reactor, a defense mechanism that he started to develop again after the Bucky scene last week.
“Boss? Would you like me to call Captain Rogers?” That snapped him out of his daze. The genius glanced up, terrified.
we could possibly need right here.” The way he emphasized on the word ‘everyone’ made the spies extremely suspicious. Zemo had did that on purpose. On why, they are yet to know.
“Yes, Mr. Iron Stark-Mr. Tony. Uhh, I mean Mr. Stark.” He was obviously full of nerves being in front of the genius. He always did secretly idolized him, one engineer to another. His connection to Hank Pym kind of spoiled that at first but he still held high respect for the Iron clad hero and his many achievements. The 3 years of his disappearance, his name was whispered within the compound’s wall, somewhat like a legend. The few times he and Rhodes talked about the mechanic, he was regaled by numerous stories of his marvelous experiments and creations that made Scott’s mouth water from delight and awe.
“Bold of you to assume that I need your permission to murder you.” Was Natasha’s answering remark which pulled a laugh from everyone. Tony, albeit feeling a bit uneasy, laughed alongside them.
“The part where you’re taken and in a relationship. With Steve, specifically. I’m here to give you a little warning.” Oh, that’s why.
“Hey, Buckaroo. What brings you do-”
And isn’t that pitiful?
drunk. There go his 2 years of sobriety. And to be honest, that was the least surprising of all. Tony Stark was an alcoholic. He tried but that will remain unchanged. He was a fool to think he could escape alcohol.
That was what greeted them when they entered the Council Room. Inside was the Rogue Avengers, huddled together on one corner of the room, and the Dora Milaje who were more scattered. Upon entering, both sides settled with staring at each other. It took every bit of courage Tony has to meet his former team’s gazes. His breath hitched every time his eyes jumps from one person to another. Sam. Clint. Scott. Wanda. Natasha. His stomach dropped when his gaze landed on Barnes.
Being reminded of the genius was such a hard thing for Steve. They used to be so close before the whole civil war happened. They were friends. Close friends, in fact. They spent so much time together. They would go out for lunch, sometimes dinner. Breakfast wasn’t an option because Tony wasn’t a morning person. They would go to museums or watch games. They bonded so much after that Battle in New York. Steve was utterly devastated and horrified after Siberia. He couldn’t really blame Tony for reacting the way he did. In a way, he did betray his trust. He lied by omission.
“Mother, more like it.” That earned an undignified sound from the genius who glared at Clint.
“And that’s it. Thanos is just a Titan. He’s no God. He cannot be killed but he sure as hell can be defeated.” That statement did help raise a bit of hope. Only little.
Below that message is a short reply that contains coordinates that leads to Wakanda.
The media backlash was as expected. They received backings and support from the LGBTQ+ community and pretty much the majority of the population were okay with superheroes being publically out. What they weren’t okay with was who exactly was included in the said relationship. Specifically, Tony. Nobody is really okay with the idea of the most prominent playboy billionaire despoiling and corrupting the national icon. There were petitions and articles that came out about that. It enraged the super-soldier when he found out about it. Pissed him enough to attempt to march the compound’s door down and rain down hellfire on all unfortunate reporters that would be stupid enough to approach him. Tony was able to calm him down after promising wonderful rounds of sex.
Maybe that’s why his own best friends automatically took the side of his boyfriend without even asking him what’s going on. God. They didn’t even ask him how he was or if he was alright. They just didn’t
Same old Tony Stark, it seems.
some other day. The Avengers are going to have to do for now.”
“W-What?”
”  Steve’s voice cracked at that simple two syllable name. His tone was filled with so much emotion that it gave partway. He hadn’t seen the genius in 2 years. It’s even been longer since they last talked. Seeing the titanium gold alloy armor glistened under the sun as he stood before all of them was magnificent. It was breath taking. Steve could hardly breathe.
Everyone almost let out a breath of relief when they heard Shuri’s watch beep and blink. The Princess pressed a few buttons before bringing out a hologram to display the information and data she received.
"Only you have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him." Fuck. Tony firmly shut his eyes. He wanted so much to take back what he said. No. They couldn't do it. Not with Vision as the price.
month after the Civil War, when a global threat made itself known on California. The X-Man and Fantastic Four were there but it was obvious that they were losing as they were gravely outnumbered. It wasn’t until the arrival of the Rogue Avengers that the threat was contained and eradicated. They not only help save the United States but the whole world as the guy behind the threat was planning on releasing a widespread virus that can kill millions at a time. They were granted immunity and full pardon in exchange of taking up the Avengers Mantle once again.
“Then why here? In a quiet countryside? This doesn’t seem like an adequate place for a hideout. More of a retirement plan than anything.” The archer snarked.
“I have a meeting with General Phillips a few days from now and then with the Secretary of Defense next week and the week after. I can’t really cancel and reschedule those.” That made both veterans chuckle.
"Why don't we just focus on the ones we have now? We have both the Time Stone and the Mind Stone. We'll waste time discussing about the others beyond our reach. Let's talk about what we'll do about those." Sam commented. He always is the voice of reason.
As expected, Natasha didn’t take his sarcasm well. She gave him a stone-cold glare as her grip on his bicep tightened to the point that it hurt.
Tony surrendered his full weight on the chest in front of him. He was still sobbing.
"Tell me his name again." Tony asked, his insides twisting uncomfortably at the mere mention of the being's name. He recognize it. Of course, he does! Everyone like him heard of that name at least once. His name has been a constant whisper within the borders of the camp. They hailed him like a legend. Like a myth. To hear that he's actually real. It terrified the genius.
“Sure, Tony. That’s exactly why you’re not pushing me away.”
“Anyway, as I was saying, I am officially resigning as Iron Man. I don’t have a successor which means if you see any Iron Man knock offs around, I have nothing to do with them. Better sic the authorities on them.” The crowd did let out a few laughs at his words.
“Because they’re Earth’s last line of defense. Because they’re Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.” With that final statement, Tony Stark left the stage.
Though, no one can match the guilt their captain is carrying. Steve was quiet throughout the press conference. He did visibly flinch when the billionaire mentioned his name. His stomach dropped when he heard the genius’ voice crack at his first name. His heart ached when said genius corrected himself and called him Cap instead. He recoiled in his seat. The fact that a simple mention of his name can cause that crack and lose in composure tells how the super soldier is still a sour topic to the billionaire.
"What's our timeline?" Tony asked, even though he didn't want the answer. They needed to know.
Tony let out a shaky breath as he slowly slid down from his stool to the hard, tiled floor. He labored his breathing, trying vehemently to calm his raging heartbeat and growing fear. He felt the panic attack trying to surface as he clawed at his tank top harshly before settling to grip his arc reactor that was peeking through the hole of his tank.
. For him. In the end, the genius was the one who first looked away. The sadness and regret in Captain America’s face was just too much to bear. If he continued looking at him, Tony knew that he’ll be the first one to break. Just seeing the remorse being reflected in his clear, blue eyes was going to be enough to break Tony’s resolve. If he didn’t looked away the moment he did, he knew he would have broken down and apologized himself.
“Yeah. But
Even SHIELD, huh? Figures.
“Are you sure that’s wise, boss? You haven’t eaten anything solid in 3 days. You are bordering on being underweight, Boss. Just let me order you something to eat at least-”
"What's with the sudden visit then, Sour Patch?"
Steve knew that he was taking Zemo’s sudden appearance harder than he should. He personally hold a deep grudge on the Sokovian. He was the mind behind the bombing in Vienna which ultimately nailed his best friend and forced him out of hiding. He was also the reason why he and Tony had such a bad fall out.
Tony tried. He did. He fucking tried to hold Steve’s gaze but he was weak. Still
“Tony. I know this isn’t the right time. Not with the end-of-the-world catastrophe literally knocking on our doorsteps. But I cannot not tell you. After what had happened between us, I’m not asking for anything. I just want to tell you. Before it’s too late.” Tony can’t help it. He immediately jumped to conclusions after hearing his spiel.
“I guess it’s our fault for doubting Stark.” The former pararescue said, guilt present on his expression. In fact, every one of them felt the crippling sense of guilt. Even Clint who was bad mouthing the genius earlier looked properly chastened
"Hey Bruce.. How's Calcutta?"
“Hey. Any news from the panel?” The super soldier asked. The grim expressions on their faces was all the answer he needed to tell that it wasn’t good news. His frown deepened even more as Rhodes handed a manila folder to him.
“I can’t b-be Iron Man anymore. I can’t say the exact reason for coming up with that decision as they are personal and private. But I can’t be Iron Man.” The crowd was more somber for this revelation. They were whispering amongst themselves but no shouting or violence occurred. Not like the other two announcements.
“Yes. They’re all asking for answers.” The monarch said. Hearing this, Tony’s hand started to feel damp. He was feeling incredibly anxious and nervous the moment he realized that they’re going to Wakanda. Reading Bruce’s message alone made him uneasy and on edge. He didn’t say anything about the incoming threat aside from the words ‘He’s coming’. The fact that he wanted him to assemble the team was immensely worrisome. Whoever’s coming, he’s someone powerful.
“Boss is okay, Captain. He is simply not in the suit.”
“Tony-” Steve attempted to talk as they were again forced back to back.
“So, in other words, we’re flying blind? How are you sure that it was Banner who sent you that message? It could have been anybody.” The archer’s tone was full of bite and hostility that made everyone in the room wince. So much for a civil conversation.
“Boss, an unidentified spacecraft had entered and breached Earth’s atmosphere not five minutes ago.” The genius’ head snapped upwards as his AI’s word registered to him. He cursed loudly as he scrambled to the nearest hologram table and started typing madly.
Tony’s not ready to forget but he’s definitely ready to move forward and possibly, to forgive.
“Geez. Sorry for being worried, asshole.” Clint grinned mischievously at the sarcastic tone his teammate had used. Seeing the smugness on the archer’s eyes made Sam glare as he threw a towel at him. The sharpshooter laughed as he caught the cloth easily.
As all hope seem to have been lost, a miracle came just in the nick of time. Small missiles came out of nowhere and started taking out multiple agents at the same time. Everyone snapped their heads up towards the sky and like a falling star, the Iron Man whipped past them all and landed in his trademark kneeling landing.
“What is all that?”
“But at least some of it was.” Steve sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “So, yeah. I’m sorry.”
“So you guys... uh... when did you get married?” Bucky askes, and Tony can’t help but feel bad for the man. He can only imagine how it feels to have Steve and lose him. Because as dense as Tony can be, he knows he hasn’t lost Steve to Bucky. Not yet.
“What does it look like I’m doing? I’m sitting by my goddamned husband’s bedside is what I’m doing here!” Tony hisses, trying hard to keep his voice down.
Steve stares at the still unconscious Bucky, his hands shaking as the voice coming through his comms flickers.
The man opens his mouth, as if to say something harsh in return, but for some reason decides against it and closes the door, pulling another chair forward, sitting on the other side of Steve’s bed.
Bucky isn’t sure if he is either.
He’ll know what to do.
“What does that mean?” He manages to get out.
Tony nods once.
“We got ambushed. I don’t know exactly who they were, I think Hydra men... We were just getting out of Wakanda, going on a stupid mission for T’challa when they... I should have blocked the bullets, I should have been faster... But my arm... it’s new... I ...” Bucky trails off, not sure how he can convince anyone that he had tried his best. Because had he? How could he let this happen? The arm be damned, he should have taken that bullet for Steve.
“If you cared enough, you’d have been there to know yourself!” He hisses, somehow blaming Tony for Steve’s state almost as much as he blames himself.
Song of the chapter: Far From Home by Five Finger Death Punch and then Wrong Side of Heaven by Five Finger Death Punch
“Why haven’t they healed him like they did with you? I mean for God’s sake, Strange could have fixed him up faster...” Tony blurts out, clearly still not done panicking about this.
How could he have let Steve take a goddamn bullet for him instead?
“For your parents... and for Steve... I... I never meant to take him away from you... he’s just so stubborn sometimes... He wouldn’t listen to me...”
“He always talked about you, you know...” Tony decides to throw the poor guy a bone.
Tony looks up from the unconscious blond, studying Bucky for a moment.
Ooff! This one was really intense for me to write and the next few chapters are gonna be the same.
He is cut short when the door opens and the man in the doorway audibly catches his breath.
I promise it's going uphill from here on!
Song of the chapter: Dreams for Plans by Shakira
“Then what Steve? Are you gonna leave Bucky and come get me?” Tony’s harsh words cut deep into Steve’s armor of will.
“No need to tell me about it! Stupid boy, he’s always jumping on grenades, running into open fire without backup when I specifically tell him not to. In fact, one of the first memories I have of him is aunt Peggy telling me about brave Captain America jumping on a damned grenade before he underwent the surgery! It was apparently why they chose him for the job...” Tony trails off, smiling fondly at his dork of a lover before looking up at Bucky who has gone white now.
Tony bites down on his lip, trying to hold back a sob forming in his throat as his gaze falls on the broken body on the bed on the other side of the glass. His hands are shaking on the door handle, as if screaming at him to stop, to turn around and run away. Pretend that he doesn’t see those ugly tubes penetrating his husband’s beautiful nose and mouth, pretend there aren’t blades of sorrow cutting deep into his heart.
Would you decide to risk something so big? Do you even have a right to?
“What?”
And as always, Bucky hates seeing him there. On that goddamned bed, kept alive with machinery Bucky can’t even begin to understand.
“As fascinating as you boys’ bickering is to me, we have a problem at hand...” She brings their attention back to the boy in bed in front of them.
It takes Steve a beat before he realizes the figure on fire is a woman, looking very focused as she lands the spacecraft gracefully. The landing gears deploy as they touch down and the entry hatch opens to show Tony and someone else walk out, Tony being supported by the mystery figure. Steve must be really going out of  his damn mind, because the figure seems to be a robot. Though far be it from Tony to befriend a freakin robot from space.

He would if he could go back in time...
He tries to ignore the small voice at the back of his head, telling him ‘if he’s alive’. Of course Steve is alive.
‘That shield doesn’t belong to you.’
“Hey don’t look at me it was her idea.” He points at Shuri with his head, who is already checking on Steve’s vitals.
And Tony does know. Because he also has tried to fix it for Steve. They have both learned to get through their PTSD together, learned to let go of the loved ones passed away together, become whole together again.
Woooot! You've made it! Comment and guess what the big plot twist is for the next part!! If this part gets enough attention and I know people actually like it, I will post next part sooner. If not and I realize this is just for me, I will take it slower a little. :) So it's literally in your hands! ;)
For chapter one: When the levee breaks by Led Zeppelin!
“Don’t you think I wish I was there? Don’t you think I blame myself for this?” He hates how broken he sounds.
He takes a shaky breath and opens the door, walking in and sitting by his unconscious husband’s bed, and stares at his unusually pale face. He tries his best not to think about the fact that the chair he is now possessing had been warm, in an otherwise cold room, trying to ignore what it implies.
Pretend that he isn’t about to watch Steve slip through his fingers. Again.
is what he’d wanted to say.
How is he supposed to live in a world where Steve doesn’t know him?
If his calculations are right, he only has to survive 24 days, until they’re back home and he finds Steve.
“The bullet made a clean cut through his hippocampus and amygdala... and I can fix the tissue but it won’t be exactly like how it used to be, or should be...”
“Goddammit Barnes, can we not fight? I just...” Tony pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to push away the last image of Steve he has in his head. With his arm stretched out for Tony to take, offering peace Tony had not been ready to accept.
Yes, he had been angry and jealous, and yes, he had acted like a jackass, but Steve is a righteous man, and where Tony might have slept with his ex, just to get back at him, Steve would never cheat on him.
Song for the chapter: Come Wake Me Up by Rascal Flats.
“Two years ago... after almost 18 months of dating and stuff...” He finally answers and Bucky nods once, like acknowledging this is hurting him more than being brainwashed for all those years.
The hurt on his face as Tony had slapped it away, spitting out those last words.
‘You don’t deserve it!’
“I’m sorry Tony...” Bucky finally spits out the words he should have said long ago. Maybe Steve would have...
“That is too much of a risk Shuri...” T’challa stops mid sentence, his eyes moving from Tony to Bucky before he sighs and approaches Tony, shaking his hand.
Not when they had almost won.
Man, sometimes I miss the vulnerability she had with her music back then. This song always gets to me!
He wants to scream, to throw something at the blue-eyed man, make another scene, fight him again and this time, win the fight. ‘How dare you take him away from me?’ he wants to shout out.
Warning for Panic Attacks and PTSD related issues.
“I’m sorry Steve... I’m so sorry I wasn’t there with you...” He lets go of Steve’s hand in favor of holding his face, the cold piercing through his skin like needles and spreading to his heart.
As with most my fics, there is a playlist you can listen to as you read through this fic! Every chapter has a song.
Barnes, Bucky, barely throws him a glance before staring back at Steve. God Steve, he looks so tiny like that. As if he isn’t the 6 feet tall, muscular Captain America the whole world looks up to. As if he never went through the change, never grew large and strong. As if he’s just Steve Rogers, the skinny boy from Brooklyn who’s too much of an idiot to run from a fight, and has gotten himself into yet another hospital bed.
“God, baby, I’m so damn sorry I...”
Song of the chapter: Heart Shaped Wreckage by the cast of SMASH.
“He did what?” Bucky repeats and only then Tony realizes that Bucky must have not known and he can’t blame himself for the small feeling of victory in his heart.
“I mean it clearly didn’t blow up, it was a dummy, you know a test to find the bravest man! The stupidest man if you ask me... I mean the dumbass agreed to marrying me...” Tony is smiling again. God how he wishes for Steve to just open his eyes so that they could get past this, so that Tony can say he is sorry, say he still loves Steve...
. But he doesn’t want to break the momentary truce they have going on.
“I hope you and the white wolf put aside your feuds?”
Bucky wipes a tear from his eye and bites down on his bottom lip, something Tony has come to realize in the past hour, he does a lot.
"Woah! Hold up! What the hell is happening here, Stark?! We have no time for your bullshit and games! The universe is in danger and yet you still can't control yourself, huh?! You still want to be the center of everyone's attention like the god damn attention whore and egomaniac you—" Clint would have barreled along if it wasn't for Steve who straight up punched the archer. Shocked and confused, Clint didn't have enough time to process what happened as he was sent crashing towards the nearest wall. The archer looked up at the absolutely pissed off super soldier who was glaring at him like he was Red Skull came back to life. Sensing the tension, Bucky and Sam immediately ran towards the pair, the former went to Cap to hold him back and the latter towards the ex-shield agent to check for major injuries. Clint was too shocked to stop or react to Sam's inquiring hands.
“It’s true, Tony. I know it can be hard to believe but I really am in love you. For years now. I’ve never been in love with anyone as much as I am in love with you. Just that.. You’re it.. You’re it for me.”
“As for the future of the Avengers, which I’m sure you are all been dying to hear.. I’m afraid that as of this moment, the Avengers are no more.” That created another riot from the crowd. Flashes and shouts erupted around the place as the bodyguards and security struggled to keep the peace. It took about another ten minutes before the noise died down.
"So he already has one stone. But we have two right here with us, right? Doesn't that give us the clear advantage?" Rhodey asked. He was sitting on one of the plush chairs located on the room, his arms crossed as he gave everyone a grimace.
"Go and prepare the medical bay for what you need. Have everything ready in an hour. You can start the procedure after the meeting is done." With that, the Princess of Wakanda had left the room.
!’ When almost two minutes had passed of awkward silence, someone finally broke and started asking questions. It was as if a spell had been broken and all hell had broken lose.
“Mr. Stark, there is no need-” The android attempted to reason but the genius cut him off.
“I guess everyone except me, Spider-man and Black Panther.” The Colonel said with a shrug. Both veterans looked at him in surprise. It wasn’t uncommon for Rhodes to have prior commitments aside from being an Avenger because he was still an SI and Military liason. Though, it was a bit unusual for him to opt out from an important mission like this.
“Boss
“Guess we’ll be part of the welcoming committee then. How about the… others? Do they-?” Tony’s voice trailed off, the end of his sentence lost but everyone understood what he was asking. His tone attempted to feign indifference but still failed to cover his hesitance and uncertainty.
It began when Bucky came knocking on his workshop. The genius actually jumped (though he would deny that till his last breath) when the former brainwashed soldier pounded on the door. Once allowed access, the soldier didn’t waste time as he stalked towards the billionaire, vehemently laying his metal arm on the table in front of him. Tony backed up and winced at the loud clanking noise made by the collision of metal against metal.
“Everyone? Isn’t that a bit much for a standard investigate and recon mission?”
just say you’re here as Antonio’s guest.” The three left behind didn’t even had the time to question Tony as he already sped off.
“We can go all day talking about what I don’t deserve but really.. What do I deserve?” Tony expected Steve to pause and falter. Like he was doing earlier. What he didn’t expect was the straightforward and unhesitant answer that he got.
Tony stayed in his lab for the next two days. He only resurfaced when Steve and Barnes’ left for their weekly walk in Brooklyn. They always leave the compound on Thursdays to walk around their neighborhood just to reminisce and see the sights. They would leave early in the morning and usually come back after lunch. Sam would sometimes tag along but those were really rare occurrences since he didn’t want to intrude on their moments.
Various levels of reaction was painted on the faces of the Avengers. The last being the great Captain whose voice cracked as it filled with emotions.
still holds a great impact in his life. That long had passed and he still had yet to move on from the betrayal he made Tony suffer through. Out of all the Avengers.
“Sure you are. Steve’s the dad if you’re wondering. You guys are the parents of this dysfunctional family.” That remark actually caused the usually cool and collected billionaire to blush. His face and ears hint at a pale shade of red.
He feels like Piper and Pepper would be both proud and disappointed in him. Proud that he got to stand up for himself but disappointed that he chose to do so in a time like this and for the reason he has. Huh. Now that he realize it, those two does have a lot in common, Tony thought. Better not introduce them to each other, the genius mused. Those two along with Annabeth and Natasha can rule the world. In fact, any pair combination of those 4 would have been enough.
“Hey, Sam. You got a minute?”
“Zemo’s escaping!” Steve yelled over the comms. Falcon responded and made an attempt to follow the aircraft but it just switched targets and started firing at him.
Hope you guys liked it! I don't have a fixed schedule of updates, really sorry about that. Also, our midterms are just around the corner so I don't when i'll be able to write again. Most probably after. I will also update Alamort around the same time i'll update this. Hope you'll wait for that. I love you alll!
“Chill, man. You’re way too tense.” The spy snickered at his reaction, eyes lighting up with full mirth. Tony could only roll his eyes at the childish man. Though, he needed to do a double-take when he saw the archer in full gear, with his bow and arrow.
“We have as much information as you guys, to be honest. I only received an alert from FRIDAY saying that an unidentified spacecraft had entered the Earth’s atmosphere and that they reached out to me by sending a message to one of SI’s main server.” Using his latest model of the Stark phone, he displayed a holographic screen which displayed the message he got from Bruce.
“If it’s all the same to you,” he said quietly, “I’d like to help.”
Tony bit his cheek nervously. He didn’t confirm anything, but he didn’t deny it either.
Stark was halfway propped up on the rim of the bathtub, his face ashen. He glared at Steve, gritting his teeth. “Cap, if you don’t mind. I’d really like some fucking
Steve popped his knuckles, considering his words. “Do you want some coffee?”
He tried to say it gently, but it came out gruff. Stark swallowed and looked away, and from this close Steve could see the way his pulse strained in his neck, the way sweat was breaking out on his forehead.
Steve swooped under him and propped him up with his shoulder, eyes forward, mouth set in a firm line. Tony tried to wrench away from him, but he was trapped between the captain and the wall and couldn’t wriggle free. His voice was tight with panic “Cap-”
Stark scowled at him. “Don’t think you have to hold back just ‘cause I’m…” he didn’t quite know how to finish, but his mouth twisted as he waved a hand at his body dismissively.
off to keep us safe and healthy. You’ve given us all a place to call
“Yeah, well. You’re not gonna do that,” Steve said, shrugging. He tried to sound nonchalant, well aware that Stark felt backed into a corner right now. His anger at the man had faded to nothing, for better or worse. Right now he just wanted to fix what was hurting his teammate.
“When?”
He rubbed his chin with his hand, guilt squirming insistently in his stomach. How long had Stark been dealing with this on his own? “You’re not the only one who has baggage, you know. You don’t have to keep it a secret. We all deal with things like this.”
“It’s more than that.”
Steve blinked. Howard had been his friend, one of the closest ones – what had he told Tony that didn’t match up? “And what did he tell you about me?”
“I’m opening the door,” he warned, voice firm.
He maneuvered the man to the couch in the living room as quickly as possible, lowering him down carefully. As soon as he could, Stark shrank away from him, curling into the opposite side of the couch. He avoided meeting Steve’s eyes, and rather than offend him, it scared him. Tony wasn’t one to back down from a fight. Not like this.
Steve shook his head slowly. “Would you judge Banner for panicking at the sight of a needle in his skin? Or Barton, for flashbacks of Loki?” He sighed. “Would you judge me for breaking down over falling in the snow?”
When he arrived on Stark’s floor, the man was nowhere to be seen. He hesitated a bit before he stepped out of the elevator, aware that he was violating the man’s space and privacy to the extreme. This was something neither of them had done, just yet - as much as Stark went to great lengths to annoy him, he’d never trespassed onto his floor. Steve had returned the favor, figuring it was only fair.
“...Thanks,” he said suspiciously, hand snaking out to grab the mug and bring it close to his chest. The mask relaxed a fraction as he took a long gulp.
fear, something he didn’t think he’d ever seen on Stark’s face.
Stark scoffed. “Relocate it myself. I just -” he faltered for a second. “I was working up to it, okay?” he said defensively. “Wasn’t my top priority,” he added, quieter. He sounded tired.
He looked at Steve through narrowed eyes. “Why would you do that?”
“I’m gonna go get you a shirt,” he said quietly, just an excuse to give the man some time to pull himself away from whatever dark place he was in. Stark didn’t respond. There was something blank in his gaze that Steve didn’t like – a thousand-yard stare, they used to call it.
“So…?”
He trailed off, the venom fading from his voice as Steve didn’t rise to the bait. “What do you want, Steve?” he sounded tired. Like he was expecting to be kicked while he was down.
Steve’s mouth twisted. “No.”
“Can I guess?” Steve offered after a moment. “You just… tell me if I’m right or wrong.”
Tony shouldn’t really be surprised. Natasha and Steve always did have a familial relationship. Somewhat a brother-sister type of bond. It was only natural that she would give him the shovel talk. What he should be surprised about is the fact it took her this long to give it. It’s been two weeks, almost three, since they announced their relationship after all.
They weren’t star struck or anything. The expressions they all had on were pure disbelief, confusion and incredulity. The reality that Tony is really here after 3 years hasn’t really sunk in yet. Here, alive and helping. It was hard to believe.
It wasn’t only Steve who heard the AI. It seems that she hacked everyone’s comm as they too reacted at the news. They all hesitated in their movements but seemed to catch on quickly, not wanting to give HYDRA the upper hand again.
“W-What?” That made Steve falter in his steps as he lost his momentum for a second. He was almost a second late from blocking a blow launched by a near agent. Steve grunted as he lifted his shield to intercept it before stroking it upwards to clock the man in the jaw.
Here he was, sitting on the floor of his lab, all alone and crying his fucking heart out
The rest of the day continued on rather peacefully. Steve’s group returned to the jet two hours later with no new information. An hour later, the group of spies followed. Pretty much empty handed too. It turns out that the base is indeed one of HYDRA’s but was long ago abandoned judging by the collection of vines and moss that littered the base’s metal walls. The spies, seeing no threat, had entered the base and dug deep through their computers but found nothing valuable. They did, however, found something useful. Natasha noticed that one of the computers was less dusty and smudged than the rest. The screen was wiped, albeit not thoroughly as the edges still has a bit of dust. And there were a few keys on the keyboard that were undusted. This indicates that someone used it and recently too. There were other signs that says that there were people that came to the base not long ago. This just proves it. The lead wasn’t wrong. The base was, in fact, active a few days ago, which probably triggered the algorithm that the panel was talking about. They were just too late to catch them.
Hey, guys! I received positive reviews and comments for this story! I'm truly grateful to you all. I'll try my best to deliver a good story. Thank you, guys! Love you 3000!
"It's feasible. Actually, we can just reprogram the synapses to work collectively. But we're talking about more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. It will take time but the procedure is relatively safe. What do you think, Brother?" The Princess asked, turning towards her brother who gave her a nod.
And second time that day, something unexpected happened. A stray repulsor beam had blasted pass them and through the air, missing the aircraft by mere inches. The aircraft wobbled in midair as it narrowly dodged another beam. And another. And another.
“Barnes-”
“I’ll pass on the message.”
“Hey, Friday?”
“That is correct, Captain Rogers. I hope that is feasible?”
"Well.. I have a malfunctioning tech that needs looking into. If you're up for it."
“You have 64 properties to your name, Boss. 48 are currently ready and are in working condition. Also, I find it notable to mention that you have two islands registered under your name.” That made the genius pause in his packing and raise an eyebrow.
“Okay, so it settles then. We’ll drive to the hospital while Vision, Lang and Wilson stays here till the UN comes. We’ll see you three back at the hospital when you’re done here. I’m pretty confident that you won’t get lose since the town isn’t really that big. Just find a big white building that says
“Ahh, the good Captain. How are you? I see that you and your trusted side kick, James, are faring well. It is indeed good to see old friends.” Steve’s face contorted to a snarl as he made a move to pounce at him. Bucky, seeing it, reached out and held him back. Sam followed his lead and move to Steve’s other side, holding his arm.
“Is everyone here?” The Colonel jumped immediately to business. Their small group had ventured through the majestic and luxurious halls of the Wakandan Royal Palace, heading towards the main council room. The insides of the castle was even more beautiful than the outside. Yep. Annabeth would seriously kill him for not inviting her here. And Percy would just stand back and watch him suffer, cackling like a maniac instead of appeasing his wife. Same can be said for his brothers and sisters.
HYDRA used this as their advantage as they became more aggressive, using their numbers to overpower the Avengers. Not long after, majority of the team had been injured, some grave and worrisome. Clint is barely conscious, leaning heavily against Natasha as he reluctantly replaced his bow with a gun to keep fighting. The red head was supporting his weight, also using her gun to keep the agents off of them. The right side of her stomach was bleeding, probably due to the bullet that grazed her not so long ago. Wanda was using her magic to knock out as much agents as she can but she was struggling immensely due to her concussion. She was blown away and hit a tree when the second bomb gone off. She also has a few grazes from the few stray bullets that flew past her defenses.
“Yes, Boss.”
“Yep. I think something’s caught with wirings on the right wing. I couldn’t glide nor turn as quick and steadily as I used to. I delayed bringing it to the tech guys because of the mission and also because I knew it’ll take at least a week to get the problem fixed.” Sam looked even guiltier at having to admit that his wings wasn’t on top shape during the mission. It was his responsibility to make sure that his tech works perfectly before going to missions.
“You’re having problems with your wings?” Rhodey had a frown on his face.
“Bring what up? I hope it’s the part where I called you a beautiful lady because I will be deeply offended and hurt if it’s the part where I called myself little and old.” That did make the corners of her lips twitch a bit. Not actually a smile but Tony will consider that as a success. While he was internally celebrating, Natasha schooled back her cold expression. Even enforcing a harder stare.
That was the name Bruce, Thor and surprisingly, Loki and another strange group calling themselves Guardians of the Galaxy, had given them. The ship that infiltrated the Wakandan borders contained hundreds of Asgardians, all seeking for a place to call home. From what little Thor had told them, Asgard is destroyed after Ragnarok was unleashed. The Prince refused to regale them the whole story as he didn't want to take too much of their time. He said he'll tell them after the threat is dealt with. The Asgardian Refugees were all now being settled in rooms that T'Challa had asked his people to prepare. It is agreed upon that the Asgardians will stay and help them fight if need to be. For the time being, Wakanda will provide them with everything they need till they find a place of their own. After that was settled, Bruce, Thor, Loki and the Guardians had joined them in the council room to further discuss the incoming threat. That's when his name was dropped.
(See the end of the chapter for
It has been more than 2 years since their return to the US. They were immediately thrown to the field and became active Avengers upon their arrival. There had been an obvious strain between the Rogues and Rhodes but through time, it lessened until it became non-existent. Bucky Barnes was also pardoned for his crimes as the Winter Soldier due to Mind Control issues. Though, he was given 100 hours of community service and was subjected to psych evaluation which he passed after almost a year consistent session with his psychologist. His mind was also now 100% his own as the trigger words were removed with the help of Shuri and her Wakandan doctors and scientists. He only became an official Avenger 9 months ago after being cleared for fieldwork.
“Did Kitty Kat tell you anything?” Shuri turned to him with a frown.
“Huh. Well, funny that. I can actually give you not just one, but two Titans that were defeated on the same day. You know what? I’ll do you better. I can even name one God, well.. Goddess that was put back to sleep after being beaten.” A beat of silence followed Tony’s declaration. A long stretch as everyone waited with batted breaths. All of them looked at Tony, waiting and tensed. Though, they were all confused.
“Good. I’m glad we had this talk.” Sam gave his shoulder a tight squeeze which was supposed to be reassuring but Tony wasn’t comforted. Not one bit. Feeling suffocated, the genius gave him a shaky smile before walking away with his coffee in hand. He used both of his hands to cover and hide the fact that they were shaking. As he was near the door, Sam called out.
It has been almost 3 years since the public proclaimed superhero ‘Civil War’. Tony Stark announced his retirement a week after that whole mess, announcing the end of the Avengers as well. Not long after, he disappeared without a trace. Many assumptions and theories had been made surrounding his disappearance. Amongst the favorites were him being kidnapped, or that he eloped with some unnamed woman, or that he’s dead and SI had covered it up. With the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes disbanded and scattered, the crime rate had almost doubled in number. The World Security Council had been running themselves ragged trying to contain the chaos.
“They don’t want to be a part of our war, but they allow us to land and refuel as long as we leave fast. They also don’t want us to make contact to our home base in fear of calling more ships to our location. They call them self the Dire Wraith” Natasha informed them and then passed Steve’s thanks to the Dire Wraith.
They just had the worst of luck.
Janet was openly crying now. Bruce looked close to tears as well. Both Clint and Natasha were quiet but Steve could see the horror in their eyes. Steve was throwing himself against his chains again and again until he could feel warm blood dripping down his arms but he couldn’t feel any pain. There was only Tony, screaming and trashing and probably dying. He couldn’t lose him. He was the light of his live. The only one who could make the next years trapped in the never ending darkness of space livable.
