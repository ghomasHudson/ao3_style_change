Gripping the baseball bat, he shuts the trunk and walks up the driveway, keys pocketed so they don't jingle. He climbs the stairs silently and looks around at the woods again before turning to the door. He grips the knob and the door swings open without a sound. It wasn't locked, which isn't a good sign. Cas always locks the door when he leaves. He steps inside and leaves the door open behind him. A quick escape. The moonlight shines through, lighting the entryway a bit.
they’re broken up? Does Dean still want this?
At Dean's nod, Cas continues. "I've had experience in it. The pacifier belonged to one of my previous subs, Hannah. I bought it for her, and during a tantrum, we lost it. I swear I looked under the bed, but I didn't find it. It was very special to her. I'd like to clean it and send it to her, actually."
"I think we make our own future. But I really don't think it matters either way. I'm happy with you. And I... I don't really know what that feels like. But I want to find out."
"Specific, Dean." Cas raises up off the bed and now Dean has no friction against his aching cock which is just so much fucking worse.
"So what're the rules for this thing. I'm assuming your bossy self is going to have some." Cas eyes him with a squinted look, almost like he's studying Dean. It makes him squirm slightly.
"You're cute, you know that?"
"I'm coaxing them from the hive."
“Yes!” Cas exclaims and turns them over until he’s leaning over Dean, raised above him. Dean licks his lips and does a little hip wiggle. Cas narrows his eyes.
Fight scene. Dunno if that needs a note, but at least you know now. Dean kind gets dark with cracking bones and stuffs.
"Alright, then. We'll sleep for now. I'll hold you if that's alright?" Dean just reaches out until he touches his skin and pulls. Cas laughs and scoots obligingly over until Dean is all wrapped up in him. There's arms and legs and skin, and warmth everywhere, and Dean's probably never been this content.
That Dean wanted to fucking mate him and that he was submitting himself to Dean's dominance, referring to him as an alpha. He knew it was impossible for Cas to know that, but this kid seemed to have no fear. "Cas, what are you doing?" Castiel didn't even open his eyes, just tilted his head further. "Trusting you." He said simply, confusing Dean. "You got a death wish or something, dude?"
Before Dean can process that, he's being grabbed and flipped and all of a sudden he's laying across Cas's lap, Cas's right arm keeping him pinned by pressing it down against his back. The fingers of his right hand slide back inside Dean's hole and he clenches around them needily. Then the slaps start raining down. They sting and tingle and shock him at first. This has only happened to him once before and it wasn't anything like this. Fuck, Cas is so good.
Talk of depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, medication. (An invasive Dr's app and all the anxiety to go with that.) Possible TW for all those listed and Dean & Castiel generally being pretty hard on themselves. I wanted a realistic feel for the appointment, so it's a bit technical.
For those of you that have stuck with me this long, thank you so much. As for all my newcomers, who come in what seems like droves every day, welcome to the Crazy. Today marks the one-year anniversary of Zippers! So happy birthday to my most popular fic! I woke up eight million times earlier than I needed to this week just to make sure I had enough time to get this written and posted for you guys.
"Of course," Cas says.
He doesn’t have any time to wonder what that means before Dean wriggles his hand in between them and wraps it around Castiel’s cock.
"You don't have to knock. My home is open to you anytime that you wish, Dean. Treat it as if it were your own." Dean smiles and throws his bag by Cas's legs. It slides across the hardwood, and Dean leans in to wrap his arms around Cas. It's only been a few days, but it felt like longer.
Dean raises his head, looking at Castiel, "I said stop being right all the time." Dean offers him a small smile which Castiel returns five-fold and leans down to kiss his forehead. "I love you, you know?"
"That's my baby boy. So good begging for me," Cas says, lazy arousal and note-able pride evident in his voice as he pulls his fingers from Dean, "Turn around for me."
"This, little omega, is a mating mark." Omega? Mating mark? Oh great. "Vampires..." Dean drew out the word before continuing, "Have lifelong mates, Cas. You wanted this." He poked gently at the spot again. "I know. Otherwise, I wouldn't have given it to you. You might not've known what it entailed, but you wanted it. Now Cas, why don't you try to lie to me again? Tell me you didn't want it. Tell me you don't want me."
Cas snores lightly, pulling Dean closer before his breathing returns to normal with a contented, sleepy hum. Dean closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He's scared about his dad, but he starting to trust that it will be okay. Cas won't leave, Dean won't give up, and Dad won't win.
"Wait, wait, Cas. It's alright. Listen, as crazy as it sounds, I care enough to listen, okay? I'll listen. If you need someone to talk to, I'm here, alright? I've been there and I know how it is. My brother tried to commit... Well, it was a few years ago. He technically died for about three minutes before he was brought back. I lived a lifetime in those three minutes. Grief kinda follows me around, I guess. My mom first, when I was just a kid. My dad a few years back. The silence from that... it can drive you crazy sometimes. And other times there's so much damn noise that your head feels like it's going to explode, and you feel like you're just going to snap. But- But I'll listen, okay? I can be here for you to talk to."
"Yes...
Cas ignores his question. "May I come in?"
"What've you been thinking about that has you so needy already? Hmm, naughty boy? Where was that dirty mind of yours at?"
Castiel scoots down the bed, letting go of Dean until they're lying on their sides and facing each other, faces only inches apart. He strokes a thumb over Dean's eyebrow, and Dean's eyelids flutter closed. It's something he finds soothing to do, and the urge to comfort Dean is just as strong as, if not stronger than, it usually is. He leans forward and rubs his nose over Dean's.
Dean shakes his head and looks away again quickly. He can't believe he said that. It's not like he's even thought about kids with Cas, and yet that just popped out of his mouth like it wasn't anything, like they already had kids or something. Already?  Who said they were ever going to have kids. He hears a click and then Cas reaches over and unsnaps Dean's seatbelt. "Come here, baby."
The simplicity of it made Castiel warm. They had a happy life here. He was glad someone had. "Congratulations." He said honestly. "Thank you. So would you be wanting to look around? You're more than welcome to." Dean eyed her suspiciously. "You always let random guys wander around your house?" The woman's smile turned icy. "Of course not. But I have a feeling you're two trustworthy young men, and I thought he would like the chance to look around the old homestead."
"I'm going to blindfold you."
it, and he’s never been shy about what he needs.
I'm sorry it's so short guys. My muses took a long walk off a short pier the last couple of days. More soon, promise. Don't give up on me.
"Are you okay?"
"Am I interrupting anything?"
"Oh, you've got company. Hi, hot wings." Castiel was confused for a moment before something clicked. "Hot wings?" Dean asked, obviously confused. "I think Benny is referring to the fact that I am named after the angel of Thursday." Dean looked dumbfounded. "Oh. I didn't know that." Castiel moved and extended his hand. "It is nice to make your acquaintance.
"Oh, sweet boy. You're so perfect for me. That was so wonderful. You did so well, Dean. Do you hear me?"
, Cas said, with some saplings growing among them. Some of the beehives have yellow tops, and some have blue. He doesn't know the difference, and he doesn't want to ask Cas. Dean stops walking when he gets within ten feet of them, and Cas continues to the first hive without realizing Dean stopped. Dean's not exactly scared of bees, but only crazy people would walk right up to a beehive, right? Isn't that intrinsic to humans, to be like, afraid of bees? Cas doesn't even have that weird white suit on or anything. He's just in jeans and a t-shirt, looking all casual as he's a field surrounded by literally thousands upon thousands of bees.
"Yeah, he's the one that changed me."
Dean just couldn't seem to control his laugh, and he kept chuckling as Cas gave him a confused look. It was actually really cute. "Alright. Let's go get you some clothes. I'm sure you're not too comfortable in your pants, huh?" Cas wrinkled his nose. "No. I am not. But I don't... Um... Can't go home like this." He mumbled very quietly, and Dean would've been surprised if another human could've heard it, but with his awesome hearing, Dean didn't have a problem.
Dean whines. Of course, he had to hit a sore spot.
"And you just like, started Domming people? That's like, kinda cool."
"Yeah."
He opens his eyes and finds a grinning Cas standing by the bar, t-shirt and sweat-pants, and sex-ruffled hair, looking every bit like a god. Dean's mouth is watering. Dean rolls his eyes but walks over to Cas, planting a kiss on his lips. "That's what you tell me. You are too, ya know."
Dean pulls away and looks up, "You mean that?"
rubbing across his pucker. Dean presses his hips into it as much as he can, but Cas's grip on his hips once again stops him.
Cas's pace increased with the thrusting of Dean's hips and soon Dean was riding right on the edge of an orgasm, skating on the precipice. Just. A. Little. More. He didn't even realize he had spoken out loud until Cas breathed an 'Okay'. Then his thumb was flicking across the sensitive head and Dean lost it. He buried his head in the crook of Cas's neck so he was surrounded by his scent. He had to clench his teeth together to resist the urge to sink his teeth into the soft skin there. Blood pulsing just underneath. Mmm. Oh fuck. He groaned loudly as his cock exploded messily onto Cas and his hips stuttered ungracefully. He didn't care, all he could think was CasCasCasCasCas. He continued pulling and jerking him until Dean was so sensitive he had to grab his wrist and pull him away. He took a deep breath. Holy shit. Well. There weren't even words.
Cas seems to consider this for a moment, "Yes. But where's the fun in that? I overheard your conversation about where you lie on the Kinsey scale, and I noticed that your fly was undone when you walked inside. I've been told I'm much too blunt, so I apologize for my actions if it's necessary. It was out of bounds by all conventional standards."
"They are rather- How do you know old I am?" Castiel's voice had gone dangerously soft. Something was going on and he wanted to know what. Dean winced. "I'm shit at this. Sorry. Look, you want the whole truth or you want a piece of it? If you want the whole then you need to be prepared because you're not going to like it."
He stiffens. "Is that bad?"
"Yeah, but you should. I should've protected you. That's what an Alpha's supposed to do-" Cas's free hand tightened around his in a warning squeeze then his phone
Castiel raises his head and looks down at him. "That was amazing, baby."
Castiel smirks and says, "Hello, beautiful."
Fuck. Dean almost groaned. He needed to get himself under control, this was ridiculous. Benny had warned him about that. It would be crazy for awhile until the mating was completed. Cas had to bite him in return, he'd just neglected to tell Cas that little fact. The messed up part was that he couldn't really justify why he hadn't. Not reasonably anyway. He wanted Cas. Fuck, did he want Cas. He wanted Cas so friggin' much that Ray Charles could see it. But he wasn't sure if Cas wanted him. Sexually? Yeah. Physically? Yeah. But... Emotionally? Dean didn't know. Dean had spent the last three years pining, and coming to terms with the fact that Cas was supposed to be his true life mate. Cas had just met Dean yesterday.
"You were so good for me, Dean. So good." Cas bites gently at his neck at the same time that his hand comes around Dean's hip to rub against his soft cock through his jeans, and Dean almost whimpers. Almost.
"Why would they do that?"
"No. I'm not drunk. I didn't do it on purpose." He mumbles. Castiel tilts his head to the side with a weird smile.
"Nope. Single Pringle at the moment." He winces.
The temperature didn't much bother him anymore, he was nearly always comfortable, lucky for him. You could always tell the locals from the tourists by how red their faces were, as well as the clothes they wore. Tourists often wore revealing clothing in an ineffective attempt to ease themselves of the heat. He breathed the scent of the French Quarter in deeply, reveling in it momentarily. It was one of the only small pleasures he allowed himself or was allowed rather. Ever since his mother Naomi had remarried his step-father Zachariah his pleasures and interests had become of no importance. Only the mission, only the will and word of God mattered to his step-father and mother. His wants or needs were of little concern, they did not stand up to the importance of spreading the word of God.
Yeah, right. Sure, whatever. If Cas wants to try to lie about liking his house, that's fine. The man has a lot of money. Dean's house is a shack compared to his. Dean just stands awkwardly, unsure of what he's doing here or what he wants.
Thanks to everyone that's kudoed, commented, subscribed, bookmarked, or even glanced at this. You guys are beautiful.
Some of y'all asked for more, so I'm delivering.
Only certain humans knew about them and that was the hunter community that destroyed them. Dean didn't blame them. That's what he had done as a human, and what he continued to do as a vamp. It was just life, and as long as they didn't bug him he didn't care. He even helped them out from time to time. The ones he could trust anyway. He missed the old hunters. Bobby and Rufus, and Jody and Donna. Right now the only hunter he would trust enough to hunt with was Bobby's goddaughter's grandkid Alex. She'd been named after her grandmother and was a sweet kid and Dean had helped her out on a wendigo hunt a few months ago. She knew what he was and didn't care. Benny had even met her. They had a cool adopted uncle/kid niece vibe going just like she and Dean had. It made him happy. "Dean?" Cas's voice intruded into his thoughts and he brought himself back to reality with a snap.
It seems almost surreal to him too, so he can hardly blame Dean. This is all so new. It's strange, and so very different from anything he’s ever experienced, despite his years.
"Yes, Sir."
"Yeah, but it's a correct one, too."
Castiel steps backward to allow him through the door, and Dean steps inside, looking around. The entrance goes immediately into the living room, and it's an extensive, spacious area blanketed in light pine wood and gorgeous oak finishing. Dean starts to smile as he takes it in, and something warm flutters under Castiel's ribs.
Dean shifts uncomfortably. "Okay."
"What is it?"
"Mine's Winchester."
Dean just nodded and walked away as quickly as he could without moving inhumanly fast. No need to cause a panic. When he was outside in the cool night air he let himself breathe again, knowing the smell wouldn't follow him out here. Holy shit. He knew that he had acted like an asshole just ditching him like that, but Dean had nearly lost control of himself, and that was bad. Damn. He hadn't done that in a very long time. He'd been nothing but a fledgling the last time he had almost lost control on an innocent human. There was no friggin' excuse for that. He couldn't lose his head over a kid just because he smelled fucking amazing.
"Stay still," He orders, the command rough and deep and
"Well, I propose a solution, then."
“Not so sure about that,” Cas laughs and rubs his hand up and down Dean’s back. “Mmm, what is today?”
He winks at her, but she smiles and copies his pose.
Dean was lying on his bed in the dark watching Netflix on his laptop when he heard it.
, but it's definitely got something substantial in it. The only return address is a post office a couple blocks from his apartment. It's addressed to him specifically though, so he knows it's not a mistake. With a shake of his head, he brings his pocket knife out of his back pocket to cut the tape holding it shut. With the flaps cut loose, he's able to open the box and he's confused by the contents. There's a piece of cream-colored paper sitting on the pile and he grabs it. It feels familiar... It's the same paper the person who gave his wallet back used. It's thick, and smells like... leather... and bourbon? Okay then. He unfolds the paper to read it.
"That's awesome. You don't know how good it is to hear that."
"You should."
"Not always." HIs hands tightened on the steering wheel without him thinking about it. Shit, he did not need to think about this right now. "Dean, may I slide over the seat to you?"
The Present, The Third Mardi Gras: Cas's POV
Dean opens his eyes and grins down at a flushed, sweating Cas. He's restraining himself from just grabbing Dean and fucking him with abandon because Dean can feel the vibrating tension radiating from him.
"Fuck. You've earned it, baby boy. Been so good for me." There are fingers spreading lube across his entrance, and then he feels the blunt tip of Cas's cock pressing against him. Cas leans back until he's upon his knees, and he takes Dean's legs and puts the damn things over his shoulders, and
He gasps when Cas runs a hand up his inner thigh. It's a light touch, more firm than the last ones, though. Dean relishes it. He's not prepared for the slick finger prodding at his hole and he jerks, surprised. Cas chuckles lightly and continues running his finger over his pucker, sending whirls of sensation through Dean.
"Why?" The word slips out in his surprise.
After a beat, he says, "You feel like Chinese?"
Dean doesn't even bother going home. He just drives straight to work. Dean took a shower at Cas's, and he's got his clothes in the trunk. Today's going to be
B. Dammit Dean that's not something you can half-ass. Brother, an incomplete mating is dangerous and stupid. If I was there I'd kick your ass, you know that?
He hears Cas's deep laugh, and then the bathroom door shut. Jesus, he's spending so much time here he can tell the difference in the doors. He's not sure if that's good or bad. He laughs at himself and shakes his head. He sets his coffee cup on the counter and steps away from it, beginning to stretch. He arches his back and raises his palms towards the ceiling, not that he can touch it, and stands up on his tiptoes, body tense. He relaxes. A satisfying pop in his back brings a lazy grin to his face.
Cain’s voice is gruff with emotion and for a moment, Castiel misses the comfort from the old days when they were together. Everything had been simple. Simple and amazing. But they’d both grown up and their dynamic now was better. He can’t help but crave the simplicity, though. Their relationship hadn’t been this painful at all.
"Oh, that's so good, Dean." Dear God in heaven, his sub is eager to please, and that has to be one of the most fantastic things about Dean. He bobs his head expertly, moving back and forth in a rhythm that is making Castiel's knees want to shake.
"Oh, you know, just another day."
"Why are you being a brat this morning?"
Dean bites his lip and tries to think of the speech he had laid out, but everything seems to have fallen out of his mind, and his tongue is heavy.
"You said the house was dark?" He asks.
"But you're a dandelion now. And that's what's important. You must forget your family. You must forget the bonds you've made over so many years. You have to accept that you will wither and die away in a lifespan so much shorter than your own that you can barely conceive it. You are weak, and vulnerable in a way you have never been before. And the hardest thing of all to understand? You did all of this, all of it, for one dandelion. A
He didn't exactly like that idea. "Dean, I-" He interrupted Castiel. "Dude, this is so weird to say out loud. How 'bout we just play it by ear and you figure it out as you go, because honestly I don't know how I can make you understand something this complex without freaking you the hell out, and I'd really rather not do that. You're not going to be made to do anything against your will because I'm not like that. You're mine and I'm yours, 'kay? That's pretty much all there is to it."
"I can smell... not exactly emotions, but the chemicals that make your emotions I guess."
Castiel smiles at Dean's quiet mumbling and slides his hand under Dean's shirt, running his fingers over Dean's spine. "It turns you on, doesn't it?"
Sammy looks around the room with wide, hopeful eyes. "Is Cas an angel?"
He likes the idea, and he's not entirely sure why. Just... belonging to Cas. It sounds like such a good idea that Dean can't get it out of his head. He can't believe he has a kinky boyfriend. It's insane. It's also great, and that's enough for him.
Castiel tunes out the radio, and it's a slough of relatively depressing news. Today has been crappy, and he's still only a few hours in. The phone meeting was spent with him rolling his eyes and gritting his teeth - the leader of their outsourced project is one of the biggest assholes he's ever met, but his pockets are deep, and his political associations many, so they all deal with him. Still, Castiel wishes he could afford to run the project. Listening to that prick drone on and on about budgets and results makes Castiel's head buzz. He swallows two Tylenol standing over the kitchen sink, relishing the swish of cool water on his dry throat.
Prompt from FB group Destiel Forever: Don't embarrass a guy by telling him his fly is open in public. Just be a man, walk over there, and slowly zip it up for him.
"Wow, that was hot-" His voice stops when he looks over at Castiel's face, seeing the predatory look on his features. "Whoa, what-"
"Oh, God! Fuck! Ca-Sir!
"You lied?"
Cas's house just lends itself to the fantasy. It's clean and organized, obviously a few tax brackets more expensive than Dean's own. His walls have cracked plaster, and his kitchen boasts stained counters and broken cabinets that he never got around to fixing. Cas's house looks anything but neglected. It's loved.
"You're gay?"
. Cas is here. Why is Cas here? Is something wrong? What if- Stop it! He mentally shouts at himself.
Sam rolls his eyes and shoves the vegetables into his mouth.
"No, uh, it's cool. As long as you're good. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?"
cock, more specifically.
He's heard of Seraphim Street, and he thinks he knows where it is. About twenty minutes later, he finds out he's right. It's a pretty lane surrounded by tall oaks and aspens, and there's only one house at the end of the lane. Dean pulls into the driveway with more than a little nervousness. He tightens his hands on the steering wheel and rests his head against it for a moment, closing his eyes and gathering his thoughts. He takes a deep breath and climbs out of the car, observing the house.
“Oh, you really like that, don’t you? What about if I do this?” Dean keeps his three fingers inside Castiel but moves his thumb so that it’s pressing in that spot on the outside, and his other hand comes around under Castiel to grab his neglected cock. Everything up until now has been a slow, gradual, slide of pressure and pleasure pooling at the base of Castiel’s spine but now it’s a train rushing down the tracks at maximum speed. Dean jerks him off fast and rough and his fingers have Castiel
"Son of a bitch!" He snarls. That has to be it. That's what everything was about. His heart thrums so fast he's sure it might burst out of his chest. What the hell is he going to do? He moves and sits on the steps leading out to the yard and rests his arms on his knees. Why'd he have to go and wake up in the middle of the night? He wouldn't have seen the message from Sam until he and Cas were awake together, but that's about how things go. It's not his fight anyway. Part of Dean's brain is whispering that, but a larger voice is telling him what he desperately wants to believe. If he loves you, it is his fight. In a sudden burst of energy, he throws himself off the steps and starts walking down the rocked path towards the fields where Cas keeps his bees.
Dean looks forward to later.
Dean licked his way down the column of Cas's throat, reveling in the delicious taste of salt-tinged skin that was reminiscent of honey and rain. It was fucking perfect and Dean couldn't get his mouth to behave. He had intended to do this slowly, and ease Cas into it but when he caught the first scent of arousal from Cas his brain had flat-lined and now he was on auto-pilot, just going off instincts. And Cas was perfect. He was so responsive, and Dean loved it. Dean nipped lightly at the flesh right above his collarbone and was rewarded with a needy little whimper and hands in his hair, pulling and tugging like Cas didn't know what he wanted. That's okay.
P.S. Shibari is an intricate, complicated practice, and I may've simplified it here for the sake of fiction. That's not to diminish the work of people who've spent their time perfecting it and mastering it. <3 Massive respect to all those in the community.
"I told you I wanted to get you a collar. I want you to help me design it, and we'll order it. It will be yours. I want you to be mine. If you'd like to be, Dean."
"You really don't. Trust me."
He can literally feel Cas's intake of breath. "Don't play with me right now, Dean. I have a feeling my stamina would outlast even yours, and I'm not so sure you would like the result. We need to talk." Cas leans back, and Dean manages to exhale a breath he hadn't known he was holding in. "Well, let's talk then, Regis."
"Why would you do that?" Dean practically whispers. Now that bees are flying around, he feels rooted to the spot, afraid to move. When did he get so scared of bees? Oh yeah, when he's surrounded by millions of them. And to top it off, a crazy person is coaxing them out of their house!
Dean thinks about saying something, but he just huffs a small laugh and ambles over to the counter, hopping up on the stool again. He likes this one. The padding is cushier than the other one. He leans against the back of it and watches Cas dishing up his egg concoction and bacon on two plates. It smells good, like bacon, mushrooms, eggs, green peppers, and onions. His mouth is watering, and his stomach rumbles audibly. It makes Cas chuckle as he turns around and gives Dean his plate over the bar, and sits his own on the lowered counter in front of Dean, standing as he begins to eat. Dean follows suit and forks some eggs up into his mouth, and moans in bliss. He speaks around his food as politely as he can, "Fuck, Cas. 'S' good."
"Oh, is that right?" John cocks his head. "I think you're a bitch, and I think that you're bluffing."
Dean chuckles.
Castiel ignores his question. "May I come in?"
(See the end of the chapter for
They stopped in Brookhaven Mississippi to let Cas use the bathroom and get something to eat. It was just a regular old burger joint but Cas had fallen in love with the food he ordered. Once they were back in the car he had taken a giant bite and exclaimed around a mouthful of food that 'these make him very happy.' It made Dean laugh riotously. After Cas was full and they were back on the road they started talking. It hurt him to say it, but it wiled away the time better than Metallica did.
"Uh, no, I don't guess so," Dean shrugs. He'd love to ask her about the artwork in the room and see if that was her doing, but he doesn't want to be weird.
"Focus, Dean. My other question?" Dean rakes his brain, trying to remember what the hell Cas asked. Oh, yeah.
Dean clings to him, and it only seems natural to put a hand in his hair, cradling his head. “Shh, baby. It’s alright. You don’t need to be sorry. It’s okay. I’m sorry I wasn’t there, but I’m here now. I’m here.”
. Which was ridiculous. He hadn't known him very long at all, and yet... It felt like he'd known him for years. Dean was so incredibly kind underneath that gruff exterior. Castiel felt privileged that he got to see that part of Dean. He loved it. He loved what his strong hands could do to Castiel's body and the things he could make him feel. How he comforted him, and teased him, and broke him out of the bonds he had been in. Or helped him break out of them, rather. If it hadn't been for Dean he would still be trapped back there with Zachariah and the Church. "What is that, Cas?" He felt Dean's nose bury into his neck and inhale deeply.
The songs featured were "Hey Jude" by the Beatles, and Keep the Wolves Away by Uncle Lucius.
"That's it, baby. You can do it for me."
ridiculous."
He cradles Dean against his body, breathing against the back of his neck and inhaling Dean's scent on every intake of breath. Yesterday may've been too much for Dean. The scene was fantastic, but today Dean's emotions have been all over the place. Not that Castiel minds it. He loves comforting Dean, and he loves being needed, and he loves being the one to help Dean when he needs it, but he also hates the necessity for it. The intimacy between them warms something inside him. Dean's vulnerability is precious, and Castiel enjoys being here for him. But Dean doesn't seem healthy.
"Uh, no. That's country. Classics are rock, man."
Cas bows his head and rubs his hands together. "Not really... My life, despite my previous partners, has always been rather solitary. I have my work, my bees, my house. But having people like you in it... It makes it seem brighter. It gives me a bigger purpose, I suppose. It's crazy, but nothing in my life has ever seemed as right as you. You and your love, and your past, and your trauma, and your family. It all seems to fall into my little niche like puzzle pieces."
Dean laughs, "Yeah, I'm ready. You go ahead and go out. I know my cue."
"Listen... My dad is coming. He's coming here."
"That's a harsh judgment for an entire race."
Castiel moves away and grabs a chilled bottle from the mini-fridge, and brings it back to Dean. He twists the cap off and gingerly nudges the bottle against Dean's lips, tipping it up and pouring the liquid into Dean's mouth when his pink lips part. He drinks his fill, and then Castiel caps the bottle and sets it on the floor. "Color for continuing."
"You may speak, Dean, unless explicitly told not to." Well, that's simple. Cas turns round to face him, his eyes bright and wearing a smile.
Dean's cheeks redden, and he whines at the words. He wants it now! Cas chuckles and removes his fingers, making Dean whine again. He feels so damn empty.
"Vampires mate for life, generally speakin'."
“First being the ‘little’ thing, huh?”
"Yeah. All this is, I would guess. Maybe you should chill on the questions man. You've got enough to chew over and think about for now. You can't really be eased into this, but overwhelming you isn't going to do any good either."
Castiel turned and made his way down the hallway until he reached the very end. He closed his fingers around the cold metal of the knob and turned it, pushing the door open. This had been his room once upon a time. Now it was painted pink and there were bunk beds with frilly bedspreads against the wall, and a dollhouse in the corner. He stared at it for a long moment before Dean cleared his throat awkwardly behind him.
of other things.
"You dropped by. You can leave now. Maybe we can all catch up in the morning when you're sober." Cas's jaw is set, and Dean swears he can feel the tension radiating off him like actual sparks of electricity bouncing into the air.
"I'd love to," Cas says quietly, and Dean believes him.
"I guess that you're Benny?"
, there's slightly less risk of that, but it can make the symptoms worse, unfortunately." Her face changes to a look of sympathy, and she addresses Dean directly, "This medication might not work for you right away. Or at all. A lot of patients have to try several before they find one that works for them. With Miva, there's an increased risk of mood swings, anxiety, weight gain, decreased sex drive, nausea, and vomiting. It's not a pretty list."
“Don’t stop. Come on, baby. Need you to cum for me.”
"I don't know... just wanna learn some more about you is all."
The friction was killing him, but it was a divine way to go, in Castiel's opinion. Suddenly the dragging sensation from his neck stopped and a warm wet tongue was sliding across the bite. Castiel winced but bared his neck further to Dean's ministrations, hoping to please. "Mmm." Dean's heated groan slid through Castiel's very being and he felt warmed by it. Melted and sated and nearly boneless. He was only being supported by Dean right now and when he realized that Castiel pushed off the wall he was leaning against and laid his head on Dean's shoulder, taking shaky breaths. Muscled arms slid around Castiel and held him tight against Dean, and that had really been all he wanted.
“How do we do this? I mean, just back like it was? I don’t… I’ve never done this before and everything’s so confusing all the time. You’re better at this than me.”
Something in his gut tells him to be careful, a whisper of warning. He heeds it. As he turns around and heads for the trunk, Dean casually glances around. Nothing seems to be out of the ordinary, but it still feels like something's not supposed to be here. Something's wrong. He unlocks the trunk and throws it open, rooting around in the minimal junk to find what he's looking for. His fingers grasp the smooth wood and he smiles.
"So, Dean, how was yesterday for you?" Cas asks casually and catches Dean by surprise. Does he even need to answer that question?
"Dean, if at any point you want to stop, tell me. I don't care what we're doing, just tell me. Ok-"
"The gig?"
"It's alright, baby boy. Remember, Dean, if you don't want to do anything more, all you have to do is say the word, and I will stop immediately. It doesn't matter if I'm milliseconds away from an orgasm. If you say stop, it all stops. I will not force you into this."
"You've corrupted me, little one. Always having me bend to your will and desires." Castiel purrs, watching the effect it has on Dean.
"And in between those periods, how do you feel?"
"What do you think?" Dean says a little breathlessly, squirming in his seat as Castiel continues. Dean's arms go around Castiel's shoulders, and he uses the space to properly tweak and pull on Dean's nipples, earning a breathy little moan.
that they have right now. Cas takes a deep breath and slowly leans into Dean's hand until his palm is scratching against the stubble on his cheek and his fingertips are nestled in his soft hair. Dean's tongue snakes out and he wets his bottom lip before drawing it into his mouth to bite it. Cas opens his eyes and looks over at Dean, his gaze intense and speaking volumes. Dean does the only thing he can think of. The only thing that feels right. He nods.
, is he addicted. "Do you remember what I told you what I wanted to do to you in that text?"
Cas groans loudly across the phone, and it spurs Dean on in the most delicious of ways. Dean complies immediately and wraps his hand around his aching cock with an unforgiving grip. He fucks into his hand and then back against his fingers once. Twice.
"First successful?"
D:shit im sorry benny. i know you know. im just scared
"Are you calling me a pervert?"
He's been so happy.
"Yeah. You?"
"Such a sweet boy for me. Cum for me, Dean. That's right."
"You don't have to do this if you don't want to," Cas assures him. The purple and red bruise around his nose somehow makes him more endearing.
He hums lightly, and his breathing evens back out into the deep, slow breaths Castiel has become accustomed to hearing when Dean's sleeping. He smiles and runs his fingers through Dean's hair. Even though he's slightly uncomfortable with his legs hanging off the bed, he's happy to be here with Dean like this. He wouldn't change it. He needs to tell Dean that when he wakes up. Castiel stretches his legs out, arching against the bed and Dean mumbles, sounding more awake this time, "No, don't go. Need you, Cas... Stay."
“We’re alright. I'm sorry I didn’t wake up, but you’re not being ridiculous. You needed me and I wasn’t there,” Dean opens his mouth to protest, but Castiel presses a finger against his lips, and Dean dutifully hushes, “But I am here now.” Quieter now, he leans in and presses a kiss to the top of his forehead, whispering against his hair. “I’m sorry I hurt you, love.”
"But uh, that's what the nightmare was about. I have them sometimes. Sorry I woke you up."
Dean chuckles and raises his head, "Come on, Benny, it's not that bad. What about that time when I caught you with Rebecca
Dean's stunned. The paper flutters to the floor between his feet and he stares blankly at the water-stained wall across from the couch. Cas is... Cas is in the mob. Not only that, he leads it. Jesus Christ, what even is Dean's life? He rubs his hands over his face and leans forward with his elbows on his knees. Cas is a mob boss. Jesus. He probably kills people on a day to day basis. No, Dean reminds himself, Cas is a good guy. He knows he is. They've talked about everything since they began texting and they've grown close, or Dean'd like to think so. He thinks about Cas all the time. Talking to him is like the highlight of his day, and he's found himself telling Sammy about him as he cooks breakfast or whatever. He's had dreams about Cas for fuck's sake, wondering what he sounds like, or what his lips feel like and
“Well, still. If the tables were turned, how would you feel?”
Cas is placing his hand over the top of the hive and murmuring too low for Dean to hear. He watches in horror as a few bees come out and start flying around Cas. Unlike normal human beings, Cas doesn't swat at them, only watches them weave around his head with a small smile, then he looks down and starts talking again.
"Can we... um... Can we date? Like, be together? I'm not sure if you want that, but I do. If you don't, just tell me now, and I'll go." Dean is satisfied with that. His voice didn't waver, and he doesn't sound like a complete moron.
Their shower together is calm and comforting, but Castiel worries. Dean's not telling him something. Something happened to him earlier when Castiel was working. He's just not sure what. He knows Dean's mindset, and he knows that he most likely thought of something that had the potential to hurt him. He would've been looking for a distraction. He needed Castiel to take control to make him forget.
He pulls away and looks down at Dean with a soft smile adorning his lips. Dean hesitates, something inside tugging at him. The words don't have any meaning to him, so it's not true. He and Cas are playing right now. But when the whisper crosses his lips into the coffee-scented sun-lit kitchen, it feels like they mean something. "I'm beautiful."
“I’ve never heard that before in my life. A sweet, innocent, little thing like me?” Dean bats his eyelashes and Cas dissolves into laughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
He thought about it for a moment and decided to just go for it. He was tired of being scared of life, and hadn't he just been envying these people for their good time? This man promised fun, and life, and danger in his very air, so Castiel decided that he would go with him. If anything happened that he didn't want it to, he could take care of himself. Being a black belt had its advantages, he supposed. Apparently taking his hesitation as a possible rejection, the man leaned closer until his lips were on the shell of his ear. When teeth nipped gently Castiel's breath caught and he had to take a deep breath to even understand what the man had said. "You look like you need it." He definitely wasn't wrong. Maybe this stranger could offer the opportunity Castiel needed to break free of his familial restraints.
Castiel sighs, "No. I'm angry with him. You shouldn't feel this way. I'm not going anywhere. Come here," Castiel opens his arms and Dean leans over into his chest. Castiel kisses his hair. "I'm not leaving you, silly boy. I wouldn't dream of it. John Winchester isn't going to scare me away from the best thing that ever happened to me."
"Nothing dramatic, at least I assume. Benny's fixing it now. But," Castiel pauses, "I do respect your boundaries. Everyone deserves a modicum of privacy, and we're no different. That's how all my relationships have been." He feels Dean stiffen but continues, "But with you it's different. I want to know everything about you. What you're thinking and feeling and what you dream about. It's an odd feeling for me... It's going to take some effort to curb that, but I will try. I can't promise I'll be perfect, but I will try."
Cas's voice brings him back to reality. "Yeah?"
"You're so pretty for me, you know that, baby boy?"
Cas is sexy. Dean turns his attention back to working on Cas's pants, pulling them down and shoving them off his legs onto the floor even though he knows Cas will complain about it later.
Castiel laughs, "Do you want to go to bed, sweetheart?"
"That's it.
"It's alright. I'm not leaving you for long. I just have to grab something. Grab the wall." Dean obeys and puts his hands against the wall so that when Cas leans over to get something out of a drawer in the nightstand, he doesn't fall. Then Cas leans back, and he's got a blue tie in hand. Cas presses kisses up Dean's chest, then lightly grabs a nipple between his teeth, pulling slightly and making Dean cry out. Cas pulls away with a smile.
Castiel is clenching down on Dean’s fingers again in no time. He laps at the tip of Dean’s cock and licks up the precum there as Dean adds a third finger. God, it’s tight. Castiel groans as Dean pushes them in further, wider, and his hole
He could accept that. Probably. With some time to wrap his mind around it. The next series of questions was what was troubling him. Dean had said he knew a lot about him and that he had meant to talk to Castiel three years before. He hadn't given a reason for why he disappeared, but then he had felt it necessary to explain that he was in fact not human before he could explain. "Why did you disappear when you helped me up three years ago?" Dean just kind of blinked at him and retracted his teeth. "Really, Cas? No questions, no 'eek, a freak!', nothing?"
Dean says. It sounds sincere, but Dean also sounds tired, kind of like he doesn't want to talk
Castiel considers it for a moment before adding a new contact to his phone. His cellphone cannot be tracked, they'd made sure of that after the last mishap where Anna had nearly lost her life. Besides, continuous contact with Dean would be easier if he was using a cell phone. It was harder to track as well. He's had a security team trailing Dean since the thought occurred to him. Gadreel and Alfie worked well together, and he trusted they could keep Dean safe should something come up. There's a sharp knock on his door to which he responds, "Come in."
There's the sound of creaking leather in the background, and Castiel knows Cain is settling into the chair behind his desk.
Possible TW: Bit of angst, and some possibly triggering thoughts, mostly Dean's self-hate. However, there is definitely plenty of fluff and some DEFINITE hurt/comfort. Cas takes care of our boy. :)
They pull away and share a warm breath between them before returning to their previous position, Cas nuzzling into Dean's short hair and seeming to breathe in his scent. Dean shoves his face into the bed and grabs Cas's wrist, securing its position over his stomach.
Dean sits up, and Castiel sinks onto his bare knees in front of the couch, turning so that he's facing Dean.
Dean chews on his thumbnail, absentmindedly.
His mind was fuzzy when he came to again. He saw a hazy version of Dean kneeling beside him, patting something on the side of his head and it hurt. He tried to move way but a soft pressure on his other ear prevented him. He realized it was Dean's hand. "Dean." He rumbled, his voice scraping against his throat and he started coughing. Dean looked at him worriedly and sat him up so he didn't choke. "No, Cas. Don't talk. Your throat's all fucked up. Please, just shut up, okay?" Castiel sent Dean a scathing look, at least to the best of his ability anyway. He felt so light headed. "Come on. Lay back down. I got to get this bleeding to stop." Castiel noticed how Dean was licking his lips, and his eyes were wide. Dean was
Dean rolls his eyes and lays back down on Castiel. "No more tickling," he says quietly. Castiel nods and says, "Okay. No more tickling. Are you okay?"
"Umm..."
After the last hive is visited, they go inside for lunch, and Dean wants to take a shower. He's all hot and sweaty from standing out under the sun for the last two hours. Dean tries to talk Cas into taking one with him, but Cas firmly says no, and Dean pouts. He perks up when Cas says he has a surprise for him. He wonders what it is, and his mind runs over all the possibilities as he soaps up his body and rinses off. Maybe it's something related to their 'playing.' Maybe it's something for a date. Who knows with Cas?
"Beautiful," Cas murmurs as his hands find their way into Dean's panties to grip his ass. Dean groans as his hips push up against Cas, and he gets rewarded with sweet friction on his aching cock.
"Then yes, Sir... Circus."
"Of course we can, kitten. Come on, lay down with me." Dean shuffles down the bed and cuddles into Cas's chest. He feels so warm and safe, and that's so new. He loves it.
"It does kind of matter. You didn't steal it did you?"
"You think this will tell you what you need to know?" Cain gestures at the papers still in his hands. "You could talk to Dean."
"He's right. I'm only going to say this once. If you touch a hair on their heads, I will bury you, John Winchester."
. All that's in there is a quarter gallon of milk, a lonely piece of bologna in the package, a half-empty jar of pickles, a few condiment bottles, a small container of fake butter, and some fake cheese (the kind that is slimy and so plastic that that a nuclear disaster wouldn't harm) and some random take-out boxes from the Chinese place down the street. Their egg rolls are good, but not a week after the fact. He winces at the smell coming from the box and tosses it in the trash, which he needs to take out to the dumpster when he leaves. Mental note? Check. He turns his attention back to the refrigerator and gives a heavy sigh. This is just sad. Soon he'd be drinking pickle juice and eating cardboard just to keep from starving to death. Nah, he thinks.
"Just you."
"Sure you are, but admit it, you like him."
“That’s fair.”
well. He knows they rushed into this, all his experience is telling him that, but everything feels so right with Dean. They have a connection he can't deny, a unique bond. It's not something he's ever experienced before, with anyone. Not even his first Dominant, or any of his subs. It's a relationship that has been specifically for Dean Winchester, and Dean only.
Dean stares out the windshield at the highway passing by in a midday glaze of the high summer sun. "I don't know, Cas. Maybe. There's not much demand for pedophile wardrobe." He grins over at Cas who looks unamused and turns to look out the window sullenly. Dean reaches a hand over and grips Cas's knee for a moment in an affectionate gesture. "Come on, man. You know I'm joking. I'm sure we'll be able to find one." Cas looks over at Dean with a small smile gracing his face. "Thank you."
"Silence!" Cain booms and Castiel snaps his mouth shut. He looks over at him, and he's put the gun away. He seems unruffled, but his presence is commanding. "Come in here, now."
Dean asks wearily.
Dean looks up at him through his lashes. “That was like, the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me… I’d still let him get it though.” Dean laughs as he gets smacked in the face with a throw pillow.
, his brain supplies nastily.
"Oh fuck!"
"No, Dean. I'm not going to have you thinking that. I am a Dom, yes, but I am a person first. I am a boyfriend first when it comes to you. What a website tells you I might need is not necessarily true. Do I desire to have control? Yes. Do I crave it? Yes. Do I need it to be happy in a relationship? The answer is no. If we were to stop exploring that dynamic I would be happy to have you, Dean, regardless. I would miss it. But it would be worth it. It's not something I require. It's something I indulge in because I can because I want it. But not because I have to. Do you understand?"
“God, yes. Beautiful,” Cas moans and holds him by the hips as Dean spurts into his underwear. The orgasm seems to last forever. He just can’t stop shaking with the aftershocks of it. It zings up his spine and through his spent cock with every movement and he whines lowly.
Dean gets up and sidles sideways a couple of feet before hopping up into Cas's lap, straddling his thighs and wrapping his hands around his shoulders. "I wanna be here today. 'S'long as it's okay with you."
"Would you like me to go with you?"
Dean nods and slowly pushes himself up, keeping his eyes closed because he doesn't feel like opening them. Dean ends up sitting between Cas's legs, leaning back against his chest. "There we go. Good. Now I need you to drink this, okay?"
"I suppose."
Dean nods shyly, splaying his hands across Cas's abdomen. "What a good boy you are. So thoughtful and sweet, preparing everything."
"Not a problem. We'll be there soon. I can't believe I let you talk me into coming to the mall."
"Never been more ready for anything in my life. Please, Sir. Cas, I need you."
"If you were underage, it would be." He pointed out. Dean rolls his eyes and huffs, "Yeah, but I'm not. Four years outta that. Is this going to bother you?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel rubs his hand up Dean's back with soothing strokes, "No, of course not. I find it rather endearing. But... are you alright?"
"It's a nice night," Cas observes, and Dean nods.
"Look at me, Dean," Cas says softly, without a hint of command. It's a request. And Dean does. His eyes slowly track the view from the wall over the stove through the empty air until he finds Cas's eyes. His still-kind eyes. Cas has a small smile, and he says, "I'm proud of you."
God, Cas's voice is deep in the morning.
"Perfect ass. I can't wait to claim you there. To fill you up with my cock. Would you like that? Hmm? Answer me. Come on, sweet boy. You can't be that far gone already." Dean blushes furiously at the way Cas talks. He's had more than his fair share of dirty talk but, holy shit. Those nasty, wonderful words rolling off Cas's tongue in his sex voice are reducing Dean to mush faster than anything ever has. He struggles to answer.
Dean smiles as a faint blush paints his cheeks pink.
as always, please ignore any mistakes. Also, I really have been meaning to make the chapters longer, but you know, it just doesn't seem to be happening. I wasn't totally happy leaving this chapter here but I wanted to post for you guys. This is the first time I've had a writing schedule since... ever. *le gasp* I'd like to stick to it as much as possible. But I hope you guys liked it! Hopefully, this ties everything up in a really spectacular way! I'm really happy to have finally written Bottom!Cas. By the way, it was really wonderful to see so many comments from y'all about the last chapter cheering you up. Stuff like that always makes my day. I just hope you guys know it's all mutual. <3 Stay safe out there!
Suddenly Dean’s senses come back to what’s happening to his body, and he’s thrown into a tidal wave of overstimulation. The pleasure centers of his brain zing and collide. His focus narrows down onto everything physical- his sweat-slick skin, his abused hole, the rough slide of Cas’s hand on his cock, his panting, Cas whispering in his ear. “Kitten...  Cum.”
"What do you mean?"
“Hush. I’ll always be here when you need me.”
This is so - too m-m-much! Oh!" He can feel Cas's smile against his chest.
"Why do you insist on your constant, needling questions? What is it that you want from me?"
"I'll be fine. Nobody gets the drop on me." Dean walked off rather cockily, but he heard Benny mumble from behind him, "That's not what I meant." Dean ignored him and made his way across the room to the delicious smelling man at the bar, not realizing what he was getting himself into. He was halfway across the crowded room and growing more enchanted by the second. Holy... The man smelled like heaven. Dean wanted to devour him, and he was having a hard time controlling the urge to just lunge at him. Keep it cool, Winchester. Keep it cool. When he was only a few steps away a drunken frat boy slammed into Dean and consequently fell sideways into the bar. Hitting a vampire was the equivalent of hitting a wall, and Dean didn't even move.
He laughs out loud at the fact that Dean called him a ninety-year-old woman. Gabriel will enjoy that. He writes his reply out and wonders what exactly he's doing. This could be dangerous. Perhaps he should assign a security detail to Dean, just in case someone finds out about these letters.
"Good boy; doing as I asked. You look perfect," Cas purrs.
But it's hasn't been great, and this restoration will help push them in the right direction.
"Do you get paid to do that stuff?"
"What was his point?"
"Cain. How are you?" His friend laughs, his voice hearty and deep, and Castiel feels put at ease as he leans back in his chair.
Cas's statement mirrors Dean's earlier thoughts, and he can't help the gratitude overwhelming him just then.
Sam flushes and looks away guiltily, stammering, "Uh, about that... I, uh-"
"Hmm..."
Castiel groans and punches the pillow into a better shape beneath him.
Castiel figures that Dean has seen him outside by now.
The deep blue plug looks lovely nestled in between Dean's cheeks. He thought it would. He's glad that Dean chose that one, though number three, the purple dildo, would've been fun too. This plug vibrates, and he can't wait to startle Dean with that. He's definitely not going to expect it. Castiel picks up the remote and thumbs the button for a moment, thinking, but decides to wait until the opportune time. Castiel licks at the fleshy underside of Dean's cock and revels in the taste. He loves it. He knows some people don't, but he's definitely got the taste for it. He loves the delicious little sounds he pulls out of Dean as he works his tongue over his length. It's delightful, and it's making his hard-on throb with want. He can't wait to fuck Dean stupid while he's tied up and hanging from Castiel's ceiling.
"I- I already said yes to that, Dean."
What did hold it was Castiel. The way he tried to hide his smile when someone actually responded happily instead of telling him to fuck off and Dean caught him stealing wistful glances at the dancing people and the party going on around him. By one in the morning, Zachariah looked like he had been driven into apoplexy which made Dean smile with a twisted sense of pleasure. Castiel looked tired, but he kept doing as he was told, and Dean wondered what must be for the thousandth time why Castiel stayed with them. He was twenty-three. That was plenty old enough to be out and on his own, and yet he stayed with his mom and Zachariah and got abused.
"Kneel, baby boy."
"It's alright, baby. We'll train you out of that soon enough. Do me a favor?"
Dean grins and cuddles closer, contentment settling inside him, making him warm.
"You know, Sam, you can't believe everything Dean says," Cas smirks.
"Please?"
"Yeah, sure. Let's do it." Castiel has to suppress a smirk at the innuendo hidden in that sentence and leads Dean to the kitchen, liking the way Dean's eyes trail over his body as he walks. It feels almost like a physical touch, and it makes Castiel ache. God, he wants Dean... very, very badly. But he has to be patient; he wants Dean to make the first move. That's important. Castiel isn't going to force him into anything. What happened the other day was very intense, and while Castiel doesn't regret it, he knows there were different ways to handle that.
of explanations, but it wasn’t his job to police someone else’s feelings. Another day after that and Castiel is down off his high horse. He never should’ve told Dean like that, especially while he was drinking. That just made things so much worse. Castiel is now depressed and regretting his drunken stupor of the last several days. Stubbled, hair unwashed, and clothes stained, Castiel does the only thing he can think of. He goes to visit Cain.
closure?
D: how're things
"I think you're dropping. I needed to be here."
"I see." Cain leans back into his black leather chair and touches his fingertips together, gazing at Castiel hard enough to make him uncomfortable. "I've never seen you like this,  Malaikat. You're very worried. Don't give me that look, you have every right to be. Love looks good on you."
"I-I was thinking of being in the playroom and you- you having me up on the wall. Fucking me and not letting me cum."
At least those memories weren't too bad. The ones with Sam though... He pressed his nose into Cas's hair and inhaled deeply like the sap he didn't care he was. He knew there was no way he was going back to sleep. He might as well text Benny for a while. He reached over and grabbed his phone up off the nightstand without disturbing Cas at all. Ninja moves. He turned the screen brightness all the way down before clicking on Benny's number and texting him, still keeping an arm under Cas so he stayed up against Dean.
"I'm thinking about eggs and sausage. How's that sound?"
"He wants to meet you. I'm not sure he'd be comfortable coming to the club, I think the thought intimidates him. Perhaps we could meet at the coffee shop?"
B: Are you still on that? It's pure bullshit, Dean. Trust me I know. I've seen enough of repentance to recognize it.You've already atoned, Brother. For something that wasn't your fault I might add. What Castiel deserves is the truth and you know it. You scared he's gonna run?
He presses a kiss behind Dean's ear, and he shivers.
He handed the phone to Dean and waited for his reply. Would he be rebuffed? Or what he get what he wanted tonight? Dean looked down at the screen then chuckled to himself. Dean looked over at him with such a look that made Castiel's mouth go dry. It was downright predatory. His stomach dropped and then Dean was pouncing on him, crawling on all fours across the bed, forcing Castiel back up against the pillows, then Dean was straddling him. Dean grabbed his hands by the wrists and pinned them against the headboard with a steely grip. Dean's lips were nipping at his jaw as he spoke, only serving to drive Castiel wilder.
"Heck yeah, I like it. I just don't get how you did it." He narrows his eyes. "Did you get another job?"
"Yes, Sir." Cas groans and begins to carry him through the house. Thankfully, the bedroom isn't far from the living room.
"What you probably, uh, need - from all this I mean-"
Dean's left alone. He looks in the mirror one last time. He looks pretty damn good. His black suit has bottle green accents and fits him like a glove because it was tailored for him. Cas's is a matching one except it has dark blue accents. Dean hears the piano music startup and he's ready now. He takes a deep breath and grasps the knob and pulls the door open. He gasps at what he sees. There, across the yard, Cas is waiting with a smirk on his face looking like a vision bathed in warm summer sunlight. Dean walks out to him with a little bit of awe and some confusion. Cas just smiles and they clasp their hands together. As they begin to walk up the aisle Cas murmurs softly in that deep, rumbling voice that Dean loves so much, "Don't look at me like that. As if I'm ever going to let you walk through any part of life alone, especially the part where we're beginning ours together. I love you, Dean."
Castiel hollows his cheeks and sucks and bobs his head like a pro, and soon Dean is gasping and writhing under him. Castiel wants him to be swamped by his orgasm, to feel so much pleasure that he's dizzy with it. Using his left hand to hold the base, he swirls his tongue around the head like a lollipop and flicks his tongue over Dean's slit as he tugs on the chain to the nipple clamps.
Castiel stirs the homemade sauce in the pot. He made it a few weeks ago and froze it, but now he's making some spaghetti. He wanted to use his garden-fresh sauce for Dean to try. The kitchen smells like herbs and tomatoes, and the sound of boiling water and John Denver fills the room. Castiel hears a scoff behind him and turns to look at Dean, who's sitting on the barstool closest to Castiel, and he's glancing at the stereo with a dubious look. His freshly washed hair is damp and messy, and it makes Castiel want to run his fingers through it. "Do you seriously like this?"
"Heartbeat."
He's been practically vibrating with excitement since dinner. He and Cas had talked, and he understood now. Cas wanted to date him, and he'd had submissives in the past. A regular old Dom/sub relationship without feelings, but Cas really likes him, and Dean likes Cas, so he wants to try more for them. He told Dean that if and when they get to the point of having sex, it can just be vanilla if that's what Dean wants. And while he had appreciated that, that's not what Dean wants.
Dean outright laughs at his dry tone and grabs the half-empty bottle from his side, and presses it into Cas's hand. Cas looks up at him with an eyebrow quirked. "You really thought this out didn't you?"
"Thanks, stranger." He mumbles. Then an idea strikes him. He can tell the stranger thank you. The post office should be able to give it to whoever sent it. So he sits down and writes the note and decides to walk to the post office tonight just to get it over with. He can't wait to call Sammy and tell him about the new clothes he has.
Dean glares at his younger brother, "Seriously? Now's not the time. We kind of have a problem."
He moans when Cas's hand comes down on his bare ass again, and he's so hard that his cock is hurting from being constricted by the blue lace, but he doesn't care. He just keeps rocking forward and back, loving when Cas spanks him hard enough that it stings and makes pre-cum leak from the tip of his cock. He swears he's probably dripping by now.
"All part of the charm." Dean flashes him a blinding smile, and Castiel feels his insides melt. In a flash, Castiel pulls out his phone and snaps a picture. He's pleased that he gets a crystal clear picture, and he saves it lovingly into his phone. "Did you just have to save my beautiful face?"
Dean leaned forward over him until they were very nearly chest to chest. "You can't lie to me, Castiel. I can smell you." He growled softly and started nipping at Cas's neck. He tried to make himself think that it wasn't pleasurable but he couldn't lie to himself. He could lie to Dean about it, but not to himself. "I can smell you. Your arousal. Your fear. Your need," He sucked lightly on a spot just under Castiel's jaw that made him weak in the knees.
Sam straightens his shoulders, "I'm pre-law at Stanford."
"You've really got a thing for this guy, huh?"
"Open," Castiel commands softly. Dean does, then - "Suck. Lick. Show me how much you want me. Keep your hands where they are."
After he's done drying them both off, he dresses first then gets Dean new sweatpants and a clean t-shirt. Comfort clothes. He leaves the mess in the bathroom until later and takes Dean by the hand to guide them to the bedroom. Dean looks like he's on the point of passing out at this point. He's sure Dean's tired. Castiel is. He has Dean take a long drink from the bottle of water on the nightstand. Watching the way his Adam's apple moves when he swallows is weirdly erotic.
"Alpha. Alpha! Oh!" Dean nipped at Castiel's clavicle, making him gasp and shiver with want. Suddenly Castiel was shoved up against the door, his legs wrapped around Dean's waist, and Dean's hard length dragging across his own clothed erection deliciously. Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean's shoulders, holding on for dear life. All the sensation was just too much and he was already on the edge. Rough hands were grabbing at his cheeks through his pants, squeezing and kneading, and Dean's hips were rolling against his own. Castiel was quickly losing his mind, and the ability to think was long out the window. "Cas. Cas, fuck. The shit you do to me... You have no idea. I wanna see you come for me, Omega. Can you do that for me? Hmm?" Speech was probably beyond him, but Castiel tried. "Y-... Yes. Yes... Dean! Oh!" Dean growled ferociously and Castiel saw the glint of long white teeth from in between pink spit-slick lips.
Castiel found himself obeying before even thinking about it. That was slightly worrying. He stopped right in front of Dean who grabbed his waist and pulled him into him before making Castiel expose his throat, which made the wound on his neck hurt minutely. "God, I just love seeing my mark on you. So, mates."
"Oh." The simple word seemed filled with emotion but Dean didn't know what. Shiz he was tired. Analyzing everything was frustrating and putting him in a bad mood.
She stomps her foot and lets out an entitled huff, "I'm reporting you to the business bureau! I'll have you fired for this! Give me my damn car keys back!" She practically shrieks as she wrenches her driver's door open.
Dean laughs and picks up his bag, "Anywhere, in particular, you want me to put this?"
"I'm not sure. It depends on the lawyers mostly. If Dad can get a good one he might not get such a harsh sentence, but I'm pretty sure Cain has some deep pockets. He promised he'd take care of it."
Castiel found himself incapable of completing the question the way he wanted to, but it was succinct and understandable enough, he supposed. "Yeah, uh... You know wolves? They um... Vamps are similar, I guess. Similar dynamics. Alpha and omega, life mates, biting and marking. Scenting, I guess. Wolves have packs, vampires have nests. Predators heightened senses. We're similar. Anyway, yeah. Omega. As in I'm the Alpha." This was a lot of information to process so Castiel was quiet for a few minutes, working it out. Dean let him have his silence, though he seemed uncomfortable with it.
Castiel leans down and presses a kiss to Dean's temple. "Of course, Dean. Anything."
Cas drags Dean back across the threshold off the front porch and into him by the lapels of his coat and kisses him hard, plundering his mouth with a claiming kiss that has Dean gasping when they pull away.
"You act like you're allergic to anything green that's not a pickle, Dean. It wouldn't kill you to eat some broccoli every once in a while or something."
~Castiel~
P.S. If I had known this was going to be more than a one-shot, I would've NAMED IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
"You otay, Daddy?"
Having talked himself out of his negativity as best he can, Dean pulls the key out of the Impala's ignition and is now officially parked in Cas's driveway. He takes a deep breath, reminding himself that he's got this. If Dean doesn't like it, it's not like Cas is going to throw him out or something. He told Dean that.
Castiel lets go of Dean's erection, looking up at him. "Close your eyes, beautiful boy. I have a surprise for you."
Castiel strokes Dean's inner thigh soothingly as he grabs the bottle of lube on the floor. He knows Dean is prepared enough, but Castiel loves the sloppy sounds of fucking, and he's sure Dean would appreciate the extra slick.
John scoffs, but like most bullies when they're confronted, he's scared. Castiel can see the fear in his beady eyes, and he feels nothing but pride. Cain's guards come out after a few moments and he gives them a brief rundown of the situation, letting them know that the police are on their way, then he jogs inside to search for Dean. He never thought that Dean would confront John, but he's never been more proud of him.
Later, Cas shows Dean how to make a weird stir-fry with some of his garden vegetables. It turns out delicious, and they devour it sitting at the bar, which has candles lit on it. The tangy, spicy sauce tingles on Dean's tongue and makes their kisses weird and fiery, but wonderful all the same.
"We're making it, brother." His Cajun accent is soothing and familiar, and Dean loses himself in his happiness. Twenty thousand dollars. Jesus Christ, he feels light-headed. This is so amazing.
"Of course. We made the plans, they just haven't panned out yet. There's been a lot going on. We haven't-"
The sun is streaming through the window and throwing light beams directly across Cas and his table. His profile is being framed with the light. The way it's shining on his inky hair makes it look like he has a halo.
Dean tries to rock his hips back against the intruding finger, but Cas keeps an iron grip on his left hip, and he can't.
He sounds so defeated. It makes Castiel ache. He thanks all of heaven that he's getting close.
"Yes, Dean?"
Dean was starting to get nervous. "What do you mean?"
Castiel settles back against the mattress, adjusting his position a little more on his side, curving towards Dean, and he strokes his hand over his face.
He disappears, and Dean assumes he's going to meet him at the door, so he crosses the pavement and walks up the steps, lifting his hand to knock right as Cas pulls the door open. He looks deliciously rumpled, his hair a mess. What has he been doing?
"No problem, cher. It's all in a day's work." Benny begins to turn but he hums to himself and looks back at Castiel, "Uh, be careful. There's a particularly mean kind of cougar in there if you know what I mean."
Castiel knows that sentence holds a promise for Dean just like it does for him. He looks down at himself. He's wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Comfortable clothes. Most likely, that's what Dean will be in as well. Depending on how Dean is when he gets here will decide for Castiel whether or not he wants them to scene in the playroom or his bedroom.
"Yeah. That."
"I will never get tired of how ridiculously responsive you are, baby boy," Cas growls in his ear, and Dean shivers at the dropped octave. His voice is damn deep right now. "Close your eyes, Dean."
Frat Boy looked down at the black-haired man trying to get up off the floor, disentangling himself from limbs and chair legs. "Hey, sorry dude. Didn't mean to run into you." Dean had to stamp down the want to punch the guy and just shoved him away without another thought. He wasn't even sure if the dude had heard him, he was still trying to get up off the floor, but the throng of people was keeping him pinned. Hero time, he supposed. Pushing a lip-locked couple out of the way none too gently he grabbed the kid's hand and hauled him to his feet. Dean caught a flash of the bluest eyes he'd ever seen in his life, and plump pink lips before the overwhelming smell crashed over him and swamped his system in surges of emotions he couldn't even begin to describe. "Thank yo-"
Cas sits back on the bed and eyes him critically, then his eyebrows scrunch in concern. "Are you okay? You seem upset."
"Why was that hot?" He whispers.
People.
Taking what he knows is a mild chance, Castiel murmurs between kisses, "You're such a sweet baby boy. You deserve the world."
D: haha fuck you benny
A whimper snapped Dean from his slumber and he was awake instantly. Cas. He rolled over onto his side and wrapped Cas in his arms, rolling him until Cas's nose was buried in Dean's neck. He stilled and relaxed after a few moments, making Dean breathe his own sigh of relief. Nightmares. He should've guessed Cas would get those, honestly. Considering his past and his abusive upbringing he'd be surprised if Cas wasn't pretty fucked up. It'd be just his luck. They both had pretty shitty pasts so he guessed it was understandable that they both have issues. Crap. He'd been dreaming of Sammy again.
It takes Dean a second to realize what Cas is talking about but as soon as he does, he says, "Very green, Sir."
"I'm... I'm better now, but... It hurts. It hurts so much, Dean. Gabriel was the only real family I had. And... I don't know what to do without him. I... Tonight, when you started talking to me, I was... I was going to end it, I just can't do it anymore." Cas was literally talking so quietly that Dean had to strain himself to hear, especially at the last part. At the words "end it" Dean's heart started pounding and blood roared in his ears and he suddenly felt much too hot.
Dean screws his eyes shut and thrusts against Cas with abandon. It only takes a few more thrusts before he’s arching up, muscles contracting, and his vision whiting out with the force of the electrifying orgasm.
Dean forces his eyes open and looks at Cas, pulling away enough he can look him in the eye, those deep blue eyes of his, and says, “I’m completely yours. B-belong to you, Sir. You can do.... whatever you want with me.”
Two hours later, they're finally finished. Dean doesn't think it would have taken nearly as long, but Cas had to explain a few things to Dean, and he had a bunch of questions about Cas's previous subs. Ones that he wishes he hadn't asked.
Then he's breathing deeply again, asleep once more.
He slides his erection past Dean's pouty lips, and it's heaven. A hot, slick tongue starts twining its way around his cock, and Castiel puts a hand to the wall behind Dean and the other in his hair, tugging slightly, encouraging.
"Sure, why not? Good a chance as any other place right?" Cas seems to accept this and they get out of the car. The little shop is kind of run down, but it's nice enough. There are flowers and rocking chairs in the windows, and it even has a little porch on it that's painted robin egg blue. It looks clean and well kept, if a bit old. Maybe they'll get lucky and they can find Cas a frikken coat so Dean doesn't have to deal with those sad blue eyes. "Well come on, Constantine. No time like the present." Cas nods and follows Dean up the steps and through the door. A bell hanging above it makes a tinkling sound when they walk in.
"Do you want to be here?"
And he was thirsty. He had blood bags in the fridge but he kind of doubted that Cas would be okay with him drinking in front of him. And he sure as hell wasn't going to make Cas leave. He didn't want to let him leave. He had this burn inside to keep Cas close, to protect him, own him, claim him. But he couldn't do that, he thought with a weary sigh. He wasn't going to tell Cas about the true mate thing. He didn't want him sticking around with Dean because of some twisted sense of obligation.
“I’m,” Dean’s voice is a harsh whisper in Castiel’s ear, “Not. Mmm, fuck. Letting you have all the fun.”
He was usually so good at controlling his emotions, but apparently not around this irritating vampire. "So why the fuck should you call that fire and brimstone, humans-are-maggots, bigoted asshole? Do what you want to. Take control for once." Castiel bristled at his tone but he knew Dean was right. Then something struck him. "You seem to know a lot about my relationship with Zachariah and my mother. Why is that?" Castiel narrowed his eyes and stepped forward. Dean actually looked a little sheepish as he smiled and looked at the floor before meeting Castiel's eyes again. "I might've kind of stalked you." Castiel was aghast. "Are you joking?"
Castiel nods and turns to straighten the jars. He doesn’t miss the soft shish of socked feet on the hardwood so he’s not surprised when arms wrap around his waist. Dean leans against his back and holds him tightly. Dean’s only a couple inches shorter than him, so it’s not much to lean his head against Dean’s head where he’s placed it on Castiel’s shoulder. “Hi there.”
D:I know I know...
"Made his bed, and now he's gotta lie in it," John mumbles to himself, searching the passenger seat idly for the bottle of brown he's sure he left there. With a snorted harumph, he finds it and celebrates his good fortune by taking a swig of it, grimacing as it burns down his throat and into his stomach. He looks back up at the house. It seems empty - lights off, no Impala in sight. John settles back into the seat, stretching his legs out and clenching his bottle tighter, taking another long sip.
"You have to get down, baby. I need to turn you around the other way so we can sit."
He went to the mini fridge sitting on the bar and pulled a chilled blood bag out and ripped the top of it off. He didn't bother heating it up or pouring it in a glass. He ate it kinda like kids eat Gogurts, just putting the opening to his lips and squeezing it into his mouth. The cold copper liquid hit his tongue and his whole body bristled with energy as the sustenance hit him. He felt better almost immediately. For him being hungry was almost like hypoglycemia for a human. It sucked. Dean was careful not to look at Cas while he drank. He really didn't want to see disgust or something as equally off-putting as he consumed human blood. It only took a couple of minutes for the bag to be empty and Dean felt worlds better. He disposed of the bag in the trash can underneath the bar, making a mental note to take that bag of garbage with him when he left so no questions would be asked after they left the hotel. Vampires and everything else supernatural kept under the radar.
"More established?"
"Well... We can get a little... over-excited. But uh, I won't hurt you, Cas. Not unless you want me to that is. You'd be amazed at what I can do with a paddle." He wagged his eyebrows suggestively and Castiel found himself coloring and looking away. Dean whistled lowly. "I haven't seen that reaction yet. Did we just find a little kink of yours or something?"
When everything’s positioned where he wants it, Castiel straddles Dean’s chest and scoots back so that Castiel is face to face with Dean’s cock. That should give Dean plenty of room to continue prepping him but Castiel can
Dean's nodding before the sentence is even out.
"I'd be okay with that," Dean whispers, and a hand lands on his ass in a harsh swat that has him keening and rocking forward, eyes fluttering closed and mouth falling open in a pant. "Again, Sir. Please. Please? Ahh!"
“If you think you’re getting this sweater back anytime soon, you’re mistaken.” Cas adjusts the collar a little as he turns to stir the food. Dean smiles softly and leans against the counter to watch him. The threadbare sweater is a faded black, and Pink Floyd’s logo is barely recognizable on the front, but it’s one of Dean’s most treasured possessions. He’d gotten it the summer he turned 14 and had worn it for about 5 years straight before it’d been too worn out to continue to wear. It’s been sitting in his closet for a long time until earlier today.
Just wanted to make a note here: I based what happens to Dean off of my own circumstances. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and in Dean's circumstance, he's living off of medication. And without knowing what's going on. To touch on it here, it's like a hormone high. If you're too happy for too long, your brain just runs out of happy juice, so you end up just spiraling and unable to produce even the slightest bit of happiness. It makes it feel like you're seeing the world through a grey wool blanket.
Dean's hand immediately reaches to direct Castiel's cock right into his hole. There's no resistance to speak of after Castiel breaches the rim, and he slides all the way in with a long groan. The pace he sets is slow and steady. With the combination of Dean rocking in his lap and Castiel thrusting as much as he can in this position, they soon build themselves to the peak. Castiel tweaks Dean's right nipple, and he moans loudly, rocking his cock against Castiel's body.
- I need more. Please, Sir, please." The lock that had been on Dean's mouth fell away the moment a second finger slid inside his ass.
"What?" Dean asks, beginning to laugh. Cas bursts out laughing, his sunshine smile fills Dean's soul and he starts laughing too. He doesn't even know what he's laughing at, but seeing Cas dissolve into laughter makes him happy, and he feels pleasant and content in the warm shade of the canopy over the stand. Dean wipes away errant moisture from his eye and looks over at Cas, all flushed, tan skin and ruffled dark hair. His eyes are crinkled from either laughter or the brightness of the day and Dean has the sudden urge to kiss him. He doesn't know if it's okay though. They're in public here, a place Cas comes a lot, so Dean's unsure. He looks away and down at the produce, thinking. A voice in his ear makes him jump, "Are the vegetables that interesting?"
"That's the point, though, Cas. You didn't ask. I did."
Dean gulps and moves out of the doorway. A young man appears behind him. He's in a nondescript brown jacket and green shirt, carrying a laptop bag. He smiles sheepishly and gives the room a small wave. They both step around the security guard, who's unconscious on the floor, and head towards the desk. Castiel swallows around a lump in his throat and tries to assess the situation. Dean begins to speak before he can collect his thoughts.
Dean's checking to see if everything's okay? He must be nervous. Perhaps he needs more time before they scene.
Cas asks, "Color?"
He's too scared to look over at Cas but he knows that he stares at Dean for a solid thirty seconds before putting the vehicle in gear and pulling out of the parking spot. Dean clenches the seat on his right side but lets his left hand just rest without doing anything in his lap, not showing his anxiety, though he's sure that Cas can feel it radiating off him in waves. He squeezes his eyes shut tight. Seriously, did he have to say that? What even made him do that? He knows better. They pull over abruptly and cars speed by, continuing down the highway past them. Dean glances over and looks away quickly. "Cas, I'm sorry, I didn't mean-"
"Just call me, Dean, please."
"Alright, that's definitely something we can do today. If you don't mind, I have a few questions that I'd like to ask you."
A small moan escapes him as he adds a third finger, and he really feels it this time, but it only adds to his pleasure. Dean's a masochist at heart, and this is just making it harder, pun intended, for him to control himself. It feels so damn good.
Dean ran his free hand through Cas's hair as his breathing slowed and he fell asleep. He kept it up long after Cas had gone to sleep, it was calming in a weird way. He liked
"That's a good question. And yes, there will be. That would be best, I think."
Dean’s so exhausted, gasping the words out with barely a rush of air across his tongue, his entire being shrieking and pleading for Sir to let him cum, to let him finish before Dean’s just blown into nonexistence with need.
He clawed out of the nightmare with a scream rising in his throat but was immediately soothed by warm arms around him and a familiar scent washing over him. It was all whiskey and desert wind, and Castiel breathed it in deeply, shoving his face into the crook of Dean's neck, trying to compose himself. "S'okay, Cas. Nightmare. It's over now. I gotcha. I gotcha." Castiel realized he had clutched his hands into Dean's shirt and was holding on fiercely, but he didn't care at the moment. He needed it. He needed Dean. He didn't want to cry.
"For the right reasons."
He gathers the dirty laundry that was spread across the house and deposits it in the washing machine. He dusts the living room and scrubs the sparse appliances in his kitchen. He even sweeps and mops the hardwood. He goes through his mail and throws away the junk, filing away the bills for later. He throws out old food and scrubs all his counters. After all of it, Dean's exhausted, and he still hasn't gotten his clothes out of the dryer, but he doesn't care. It's been a trying day.
"Oh. I am sorry, Dean. I didn't think."
Dean just nods, and Cas's hands grasp his shoulders, guiding him backward. It's about seven full steps until Cas stops him. It's a bigger room than he realized. Dean thinks that he's over by the wall with all the holes in it now.
"Who else?" Castiel graces him with a large, genuine, gummy smile, and Dean can't help but smile back.
"You're sassy in the morning. It's entertaining. But you're correct, there are some rules. But not for our relationship," Cas gestures between them, "Just for when we're playing. Fair?"
"You do realize that I only understood about half of that?" Dean chuckled.
"I would certainly hope that strangers don't routinely stick their hands into your pants in public places. That would be odd."
"Yeah. That, and everything else that goes bump in the night."
Castiel turns the water off in the tub and moves his right hand to support Dean. His left travels down the length of his back following the natural curvature, slowly tracing over the slight ridges of Dean's spine.
He feels like a kid sometimes, but he won't lie and say that crawling into Cas's lap or being carried is in any way a turn-off. Dean loves that he's smaller than Cas. Dean was wondering if Cas had a bit of a daddy kink because of the baby boy thing but not, which is one hundred percent A-Okay with him.
He still smelled amazing to Castiel, and he hoped that wouldn't change. Every time he caught a whiff of it Castiel would find himself smiling. He tried to tell Dean he didn't want to wake up but all that came out was a garbled mess that made Dean chuckle. The hand stroking itself through his hair suddenly turned to nails scratching gently across his scalp. It sent shivers down his spine and he arched up into the touch. "Come on, Cas. You've gotta eat sometime." Whatever Cas responded, the noise was definitely negative. His tongue was heavy and thick in his mouth, and he really didn't have it in him to care.
"Do you own it?"
Dean's eyes flutter open, and he realizes he's curled around Cas, who's sleeping deeply. Deep orange light from a blazing sunset is filtering through the window. It creates a lazy-sleep-hazed, heavy atmosphere, and Dean realizes that they've slept several hours at least. They must've been more tired than they thought. And Dean has a delicious idea. He slowly, very slowly, crawls out of bed, making sure not to disturb Cas at all. Dean has a plan. He sneaks off into the bathroom, where he washes up and does a thorough cleaning. He takes his time getting clean, though he will admit it's the fastest enema he's ever done.
Castiel sighs contentedly and nuzzles his boy's hair with his nose. Dean murmurs and pushes back into Castiel's embrace, snuggling closer. Castiel smiles against the soft brown hair on his face and hugs him tight, closing his eyes and relaxing his body. He's not tired, but he'll lay here with Dean and enjoy the intimate moment for what it is. This is just as good as the sex last night, for him anyway. He never expected to feel that way, but he does. And he revels in it. All these emotions, all these feelings, they're not exactly foreign, but they're near forgotten. Everything is already so intense... Castiel dozes with a smile on his face as he continues to think. He wakes again when Dean rolls over and plasters himself over Castiel, pushing him flat onto the bed on his back. Dean throws his leg over Castiel's and his arm over his chest. Then he buries his face in Castiel's throat, murmuring, "Cas... warm.
Cas nods and looks over at him. "Yes, I'm just tired. It's been a while since I've had a night that long."
Dean smiles. "Well, you wanted a coat. So we're gonna find you one." Cas looks up at the thrift store they're parked in front of. "Here?"
"Hell yeah, I am. I get to dismantle a legend and build it back to its glory with my hands. I can make it shine again and purr like a kitten. I'm frikken... what's the word? I'm..." Dean considers, searching his archives for it. "Buoyant, Cas. I'm buoyant. God, this is going to be so good for us. I can't believe I get to rebuild a ZL - 1. It's a literal dream. You should see her, man."
"Oh, is that it?" Castiel chuckles, his voice dark and deep. "That sounds like a delightful idea," He growls and takes pride in watching Dean shiver at the words. "Maybe we'll do that the next time we scene. How does that sound?"
"I'm like, starving. I need food. Something large and greasy. With fries."
"I'm not going to leave you empty, sweet boy. Don't worry. I've got you." Castiel slides his lube-slick fingers into Dean and enjoys the clenching heat tightening down around him. It's been too damn long since last time.
He collapses into his bed at night and tiredly calls Cas after his shower. More than once, Dean falls asleep to the sound of his voice, but Cas likes that for some reason. Dean'd apologized for it anyway. By the time the weekend rolls around, he's nearly swimming in excitement at what Cas has planned.
"That's easy. Led Zeppelin's obviously my top, but Metallica and Kansas are close seconds. What about you?"
"Yes, Sir."
"You always think the worst of yourself, Dean." Cas presses his left hand to Dean's cheek, and Dean lays his palm against Cas's hands, pressing it into his cheek and leaning into the warmth of it, his eyes fluttering closed. "I know. I'm sorry."
"You have met many angels."
Castiel watches intently, “Perhaps that’d be simpler. If I could start... I’d like to say that I’m sorry. Genuinely. I never intended to tell you like that. You deserved better.”
Dean cleared his throat and gave him a small smile. "'Cause you're hot, Cas. That's why." Castiel swallowed around an unexpected lump in his throat before speaking.
Only a crazy person would want emotions and feelings and be in for the long haul after a day. But he couldn't leave Cas unprotected either, especially considering what Dean did when he was on the road. Hunting was not a kind life, and if Cas was with him then he would most definitely be involved. Dean didn't have any illusions about that, he wasn't stupid. He hadn't been able to keep the life from Sammy, he sure as hell wouldn't be able to keep it from Cas. A bitter echo of pain shot through him at the thought of Sammy which he quickly squashed. It was over, it was done, and he couldn't change it. Sammy was gone. Had been for a long time dammit, and this still hurt, no matter how hard he tried to pretend it didn't. Dammit. Dean turned back to reality as he led Cas down a sleek hallway decorated entirely in beige. Wow, that hurt his brain to look at. If pure boredom was a color, he's pretty sure it would be beige.
"Thank you!" Dean gasps as he feels a hot mouth wrap around the tip of his cock.
“I just... I came in here to clear my head and try to shake off the bad mood, but it didn’t help and then you showed up, and I didn’t mean to slam the door. I was just kind of mad, but not at you. More at me, and I didn’t mean to wake you up. You were so awesome yesterday and it was amazing and I’m ruining everything and I’m not trying to –” He breaks away with a frustrated groan, “I'm just sorry, Cas-” Castiel pulls away to press a firm kiss to Dean’s lips, who whimpers in the absence of his babbling words. Castiel pulls away to look at him; his soft, and vulnerable features, so dull and blank only minutes before, are now open and scared and slightly hopeful if Castiel’s not mistaken.
He immediately clicks the green button by Dean's name to call him as he pulls out of the driveway. He sets his phone on the dock in the dash and puts it on speaker so he can talk and drive at the same time. Dean and Castiel had talked about a lot of things in the last couple of days. Luckily one of those things had been where Dean lived. Castiel might speed a little, but he's worried. He should get there quickly.
"Again, are you asking for permission?"
When he stops at a red light, he's pulled from his thoughts abruptly by a squealing sound under the hood. His eyebrows knit in confusion, but when it turns green and he presses the gas the squealing gets louder. What the-?  With hesitation, he pulls off to the side of the road and drags his phone from his back pocket. He should call someone? No, this is ridiculous. He can take it to the shop like a normal person and see what's going on. A thought makes him pause. He could take it to Dean's shop...
"Yep," Dean's voice was bitter, "King of Hell actually. He's a douche, but he's helped me out of a few tough spots. I'm sorry about this. I didn't know he would show up. Apparently, I need to fix the warding on the car. Bastard's probably fudged it up just so he could pop in like that."
"Good boy."
It'd been two months and he still wasn't tired of looking at it. He hadn't ever thought he'd be one to be tied down. He'd thought about settling down with how old girlfriend Lisa once, but he'd never really thought about being married. Not like domesticity and pancakes on Saturday living. That just wasn't the Winchester way. At least not for his generation. His mom and dad though, they'd had the whole kit and caboodle. Two kids, the house and the car, the happy home. He supposed that if they could do it so could he.
"I'm glad I met you, you know," Dean whispers.
~~Cas's POV~~
"It's alright. Will you tell me what you did after you left my house?" It's not the best question in the world, but he needs to know if Dean's eaten anything. Or even drank anything since he left Castiel's house.
That returns Castiel to his mindset, and he reminds himself that Dean is vulnerable right now. He can't get shocked by the things Dean might do right now. He can't show Dean that because he'll misinterpret it. Castiel pushes him up on his body and shifts him a little, then nuzzles his face into Dean's neck.
Dean begins to babble, and Cas takes Dean's face in hand, forcing his eyes to meet his.
No, the playroom is the place where's he's in control. He designed and built it in the basement after he bought his house. It's a room built for pleasure, built for safety and comfort, and protection. It's a room that allows you to show your most hidden parts openly, without shame. Castiel's already bought and cleaned and stored new toys there for Dean. He had them express delivered from the online site he deals with. They're fast and efficient, thankfully. And discreet as well. Dean should be here soon. Just thinking about it, Castiel has arousal thrumming in his veins and a semi-hard cock in his pants.
Dean's in love with him.
Dean sighs and lifts Castiel's hand off of him, and he thinks that he's going to push off the couch, but instead, Dean turns around until he's facing Castiel. They're pressed chest to chest, and Dean slides his calf in between Castiel's legs. Dean closes his eyes and tucks his face under Castiel's chin, nuzzling his throat. Castiel wraps his arm around him somewhat hesitantly but is validated when Dean pushes closer, his socked feet rubbing against Castiel's leg.
"How much would you say you've had trouble at work?"
"Completely."
"I'd like to think so. So anyway, what're your plans? Are you staying at my house or are you looking for a few more camp-outs at Cain's?" Dean wags his eyebrows and earns a slap on the shoulder.
"Shit, Cas. What do you do with all that?"
He whispers, "I enjoyed that, Dean. And you did too. I can feel that much." His palm grinds against Dean's hardening dick through his jeans, and Dean has to choke off a whine. This is the most action he's had besides his own right hand in months. Shit, he can not do this in a coffee shop. Then Cas's rough tongue traces the outer rim of his ear, and goosebumps erupt over Dean's skin and race down his spine.
“You’re bossy,” Cas chuckles as he settles down next to Dean again. “Has anyone ever told you that?”
"No. I'm here, Sir."
"Food sounds good. Did you have something in mind?" Dean looks up and slides off Cas.
"Alright, maybe not my best line, but it's accurate. And you talked to me, so it kinda worked?"
"It's blue. What's yours?"
"God, she is. She's definitely gonna look better when I get through with her," Dean grins, "So anyway, how'd your day go?" Dean takes a long draw from his beer, his stomach reminding him he needs to rummage for some Ramen noodles when he's finished with the beer.
. "Yes, you do. Oh, Dean, we are going to have fun. You know that?"
"You know, Dean, I've thought about this for a long time. I've wondered what you would look like post-orgasm, all fucked out, legs still spread with my cum leaking out of your hole onto the sheets. I've thought about how your body will arch and cry out for more as I pound that tight little hole. I know it's tight. I rebuilt your body, remember? I know every place on your body that brings you pleasure." Cas accents this statement with a painful flick to his nipple and Dean cries out but stills himself, making sure not to move. He doesn't want to fuck this up. He wants to be good for Cas. Should he even be making noise? Cas hums and his hand travels down to trace designs over his balls and fuck that's sensitive.
"So you're cool with me staying here another night? I can go home if I need to."
"So, demons?"
"You are amazing. It makes me want to be very sweet to you." Castiel says in return and checks the water temperature before turning the hot knob a bit. It could use a little more warmth.
Dean props up on his elbow, resting on Castiel's thigh, and he gives him a small smile. Castiel's running his hands over Dean's face, trying to figure out what's wrong. "I'm okay, Sir. I'm just happy, is all."
"Mmm," Cas whined.
Dean visibly relaxes, and Castiel shakes his head. How did he get so lucky? His middle finger slips inside, and Castiel revels in the little whimper. He begins to thrust his finger in and out slowly, working Dean open until he can add another. Without warning, Castiel curls his fingers at just the right depth and rubs against Dean's prostate. His boy's back arches away from the wall and keens loudly.
"Sleep together? No. Not in a long time. After we parted and I began to Dom, we became friends. We haven't engaged in anything sexual in several years. He's a good friend, perhaps the best I have."
Dean hadn't known what that meant until he'd looked it up, but he gets it now. He has no idea if bees are the same way. He moves forward a step and bends down to get a closer look. The bee's lying on its side, nearly completely still. He reaches a finger out and gently, very gently, touches the bee. She's soft, he finds. And he knows it's a female because Cas told him that honey bee workers are female. He's guessing this one was just out too long or something. He looks up at the sky, noting the growing clouds on the horizon. It might rain soon... Deciding he has to do something, he moves his cupped hand to the edge of the box. Goosebumps break out along his skin and race down his spine as he realizes what he's about to do. Very slowly, he pushes the little bee into his palm, just letting it lay exactly where it lands.
Dean growled low in his throat at the words. He didn't even have to hear Cas say them for the words to have an effect on him.
Dr. Bradbury makes a note and says, "Alright, so these questions only pertain to the last two weeks, okay? Don't worry about being 100% correct, just give me your best guess."
"Dean!"
Cas leads him down a stairway that he hasn't paid that much attention to before, and they come to a door. It's rather non-descript, and Dean wants to ask what it is they're doing, but he's not sure if he's supposed to or not since they're technically scening now.
"Yeth." Comes the reply and Castiel makes himself busy undressing Dean, and himself. He leaves them both in t-shirts and boxers.
"I want you to."
Dean feels like his entire universe is shaking apart, his body vibrating from tension. His eyes are locked in an intense stare down with Cas's, and in between them a million silent questions are asked and blessings expressed.
"Hell yes, Sir. Fuck me. Fuck me hard and quick and dirty and mmph!" Dean glares up at Cas because he covered his mouth with his hand. Cas
(See the end of the chapter for
A frog croaks from the nearby woods and Dean looks up at the sky. Everything seems crystal clear tonight - the air, the sky, his mind. Like he can lay everything out and look at it objectively. His skin chills in the night dew and he rubs his arms but makes no move to go inside. He doesn't want the clarity of the moment to disappear. He sighs deeply, drawing in the cool night air and replenishing his lungs. He feels like he's healing. Like the air is traveling all through his veins and straight into his soul, letting him finally let go of that old, stale, breath. He supposes this is what it feels like to let go of your past - or not have it hang over you, anyway. Dad is going to be going away for a long time, and Dean can finally relax. He's starting to put the pieces together, he thinks.
"Sir," He whines, then nearly shrieks when Cas's thumbs plunge deeper, pulling him open wider and stretching his hole open for Cas's use. Dean's teeth dig into his bottom lip, and he closes his eyes, bowing his head down and resting it on Cas's thigh. He tries not to rock his hips back into the unimaginable pleasure. He'd never known sex could be this good
"Ca- Cas," Dean stutters, still shaking. Castiel runs his hand along Dean's back, rubbing gently. "It's alright. You don't have to tell me. But if you want to talk about it I'm here. I would never judge you."
Dean's eyes burn as they scan the screen with hawk-like intensity, raking over the raging, blinking little words on the screen. He can't even think. Everything is frozen.
"Why are you hurting, Cas?" Castiel didn't want to answer. He didn't want to be hurt. Dean leaned forward again, but this time instead of going for his throat he started mouthing at Castiel's jawline, mumbling in between licks and kisses. "Not gonna - hurt you - Don't want you - hurt. Tell me - now." Dean's rough tongue traced a line across Castiel's stubble to his earlobe which he nibbled at softly, making Castiel lose the ability to think. When he realized that Castiel wasn't going to answer he pulled back and now Castiel could see the scowl on his face. "Tell me, little mate. What is it?"
"I'm starting to get the idea." He mumbles. He jumps because suddenly Cas's hand is sliding up his thigh under the table. "What're you doing?"
Cas walks over and looks at John, who's laying on the ground. He's bloody and disheveled, his nose broken and his arms cradling his ribs. He levels his hate-filled eyes at Dean, but that no longer scares him. Somewhere amid the chaos, all the fear that Dean had felt had disappeared. Now he was empty, a barren desert left with nothing but dry hatred and anger. All those years of abuse, for what? Dean limps over to John and squats down. His hip screams at him but he ignores it. He looks John right in the face. He's close enough that he can see the bloodshot eyes and broken blood vessels across his cheeks from the years of hard liquor, and he can smell the rankness of his breath again.
"No! I sleepy." Dean rubs his eyes and lets the pillow fall onto his lap, yawning hugely.
Dean yawns and tries to think. It’s… “It’s Saturday!”
finally able to swallow, and he takes a deep breath. Cas is smirking at him, looking rather smug.
Dean does, and as soon as the green hits him, Castiel leans forward and takes Dean all the way into his mouth. "Oh fuck!"
"What is it, sweet boy? What do you need?"
Ca-"Sir!" He catches it before he says it, "Please, please,
The words are said. This is it. Cas's hand disappears from his cock, which sucks, but he grabs Dean's hand in his and then starts pulling him towards the hallways. "Then follow me."
"I'm not sure. I might've died. This feels like heaven."
"Hey, no problem. I needed a break anyway. We've barely seen each other since I started school, so a visit was probably due."
The third and final call is going to be the hardest one. It takes him several seconds to screw up enough courage, but eventually, he finds the strength to type in Cas’s number.
Pep talks have never been his strong suit. He just says fuck it and pushes the Impala's door open and climbs out, shutting it with a bang that echoes on the still night air. It's a nice neighborhood. And he likes the way the house looks. Big yard, ball goal on the garage. All that suburban shit Dean never thought he'd get to have for Sammy. But here it is. And inside the house he's admiring... there's a mob boss that Dean might just love a little bit. Well, fuck. Nothing to do but to do it, as Sam would say. Dean stills his shaking hands by putting them in his pockets only to draw them right back out again. He's too antsy for this. But if he doesn't do it now, he'll lose Cas forever.
Sammy breathes. "This is awesome. How'd you do it?" He turns those big brown eyes on Dean and he feels like a shit for lying but he really can't tell his kid brother he's basically got a sugar daddy without the side benefits.
Soon after that, Dean's breaths change to deep and soft and slow. Castiel continues stroking his hair, loving the way the soft, short strands feel between his fingers. He also loves the way the sunshine glints off Dean's hair and makes it look almost golden instead of brown. Castiel enjoys this so much. Holding Dean like this makes him feel content in ways he hasn't felt... maybe ever. This man is just so wonderful. Castiel can't get enough of him. He holds him close and feels himself drifting off with Dean in his arms.
"Will be in a minute. I'm sorry."
Cas grabs his hand. "No, I want to be here. It's okay.."
His boy is all flushed and sweaty, cock already red and leaking. Castiel grins and takes him in hand. He pumps him slowly, luxuriously, and slides even closer to nip at Dean’s collar bone. Dean whimpers as his hips jerk against Castiel’s ministrations.
“I didn’t explain very well. Sex is still very much on the table. Kinky sex, even. Or especially. But the contract was a mistake, I think. We’ve grown beyond it. There’s no need to adhere to a piece of paper made for a relationship that’s grown out of the bounds that were outlined. Why have rules and strictures if we don’t pay attention to them anyway?”
"This is a Langstroth hive. I have different kinds all around the property, but these are the ones I gather honey from. The rest of the hives are naturally formed, and I help where I can and study as much as possible. I'm writing a paper for a journal."
But playing out in the open and having nobody know about it? Hell yeah. The thought of it gives Dean a little thrill.
"Sure," Dean sighs. This is what he was expecting.
, him to stop.
There’s no answer or even a sign that Dean heard, and Castiel has no idea why. Not one to be particularly tactful, he steps inside the shower behind Dean and closes the curtain. Dean is still facing away from him, just letting the water beat down over him and not moving in the slightest. He extends his arm out, and when his hand touches Dean’s heated skin, there’s no response. “Dean, what is it?”
~Later~
"Now who's being sassy?"
Castiel tilts his head, confused, “What do you mean? I- yes? Why is that a question?”
"Maybe you'd be interested in fucking me sometime, hmm? Based on the state of your pants I'm thinking it's a yes," Cas purrs.
He makes a negative hum this time, not having the energy for more. Dean's about to pass out, he can tell. His chest feels warm and fuzzy when Cas chuckles.
"I wish you didn't have to go," Cas says against his lips. Dean grins and rubs his palm against Cas's semi in his pants and breathlessly says, "Yeah, I can see that."
"Do that again, and I'm
Cas wouldn't do that. He wouldn't.
"Shit," He mutters, stuffing the phone back into his pocket.
"Dean, do you think we'll be able to find a suitable replacement?"
"The point is, is that he's not going to scare me away, and you're worth more than you think. Dean, I don't care about your baggage! I have skeletons in my closet too. Would you leave me because of them?"
"Okay. I'm only agreeing to this on one condition. I'm going to ask you what it is if I feel you might be uncomfortable. You promise that if you reach yellow, you will tell me immediately?"
"I think... I think I might've just got... a date? Maybe? I mean, if I say yes." She quirks her eyebrows and looks over at Cas reading in his booth. Dean looks too.
"Oh, Cas. Dammit. Come here." Dean grabbed him by the shoulders and yanked him over to Dean. Cas yelped. Dean wrapped his left arm around Cas and hugged him, his heart crying out for this beautifully broken man. Cas wrapped his left arm hesitantly around Dean's middle. When Cas actually settled into him, breathing in deeply from where his face nestled on Dean's chest, Dean spoke. "You're not trouble, Cas. And don't apologize. Not for that. Not to me. Especially not to me. You don't owe me any kind of explanation. But Cas, I gotta say this. I'm very glad I decided to talk to you tonight." He murmured against Cas's hair.
you get out, I'll be waiting. If you even think about coming near Sam or Dean again, I'll see to it that you don't make it to the next morning, understood?"
Cas raises his hands in a "come-at-me" gesture. "If you think so, why don't you give it a try?"
The thoughts circling his head are vicious birds pecking at his vulnerable insides, but for some strange reason, there's no panic. Just general, sickening fear, a pit in his stomach where his uneasy dread lies. Dean looks up at the sky - searching for an answer, or something to distract him, he's not sure. The stars are glittering gems strewn across the great empty velvet of the night, with the moon making the clouds shine into luminescent white puffs. It looks like a painting, or maybe something from a Harry Potter movie. He gazes up at the stars, his elbows on the railing, just breathing and trying to let his mind clear.
"It's alright," Castiel murmurs. "I have you now. You're safe."
The next day when Dean wakes up, the first thing he does is take stock of his emotional situation. He feels mostly all right. A little blah, but not bad. He's embarrassed, but at the same time, if anybody had to see him like that, he's glad it was Cas. Cas is sleeping right next to him, and Dean's sprawled partially on top of him. His mind supplies that it would be a good time to slide down under the covers and wake Cas with a good morning blow job, but his body says nah. That's alright. Cuddling is good. It feels nice to just lie next to someone and feel their warmth and heat. It's pretty awesome. Dean moves slowly, so he doesn't wake Cas, but he raises his head and looks up at his boyfriend. He likes the word on Cas.
"Look at you," Cas murmurs. "So desperate for me.
Silence falls between them, and in the pregnant quiet, Castiel wonders why he ever considered letting Dean go. Everything about Dean speaks of tiredness, weary regret, and sadness right now, but inside, Dean is the brightest person Castiel’s ever known. He’s the kindest, most caring man on the planet to everyone except himself. Life has been hard for him, hard
"You're beautiful, baby boy. Pants too, now."
"Do I wanna know?"
They both sip their coffee, awkward in their reactions.
"Tie me up. But I want to sit here. I like this." He smiles, and Cas grins back at him.
"Well, not exactly. I don't take issue with the fact that you always know what I'm feeling, just that I can't. There's a power imbalance here, and you have the upper hand. I'm just this puny little human and I don't understand what you're even doing with me. Or why you would want to mate with me." Dean hauled Cas into his arms and laid down on his back, holding Cas cross his chest. His fingers played through Cas's silky hair as he spoke.
"Tha-thank you, Sir." Dean manages, a small smile gracing his lips. They look dry. "Would you like some water?"
The thought gives him pause. If Dad can't get Dean to change his life according to how he sees it, then he might go after Sam.
"Shall we rehash our original discussion about bees?" Dean has no idea what he's talking about for a second, then it clicks. Oh yeah. In the cafe that day. He blushes as he thinks about it.
He drags the orange prescription bottle out of the white pharmacy bag and turns it over in his hand.
"Come on, Cas. Keep looking. We've got nothing but time anyway." Cas sighs but returns back to what he was doing. After another few minutes, Dean offers one to him. It's black and actually looks kind of badass, but Cas says no because it looks like something Trinity from the Matrix would wear. Dean personally thinks that'd be kinda hot but he keeps his mouth shut. He shows him another one that Cas actually tries on. It's a dark grey and goes down to about mid-thigh. "No, Dean. I believe this coat was originally intended for a female."
"Hmm?" Cas's voice was low when he slowly said, "You still haven't..." Then Cas's hand was running over his erection that was still tenting in his jeans, which was uncomfortable at best. Dean couldn't help it. He growled. It just happened, and it rumbled out of his chest. He caught the scent of fear from Cas and Dean was pulling back, but Cas hooked an arm around his neck and pulled him closer. The smell quickly changed to excitement. Hmm. He would definitely need to address that later. But he liked the way it made Cas smell. It gave a new layer to the smell he was always wearing. It was something sweet. Something dark too though. Rich. If Dean had to give it a name he would say... Well, he really didn't know. But it was amazing, and apparently like one of the best aphrodisiacs in the world because Dean was raring to go, his cock hot and heavy and wanting to be released from his jeans desperately. "Dean, pants." It wasn't a question, but Dean refused to think he was getting bossed around by a shy little church mouse.
Sam tries to smack him from across the table, and Dean dodges. He bursts out laughing at the indignant red flush on Sammy's cheeks. After a moment, Sam clears his throat and gestures behind Dean. Dean turns and finds Cas standing there behind him.
~~ The First Mardi Gras, three years before: Dean's POV.~~
"That is a good point, you know. I am much older than you."
"Because you're not going back to him. Back to him, or that shitty abusive thing you call a family. That's not family, Cas." The words were rumbled and they resonated within Castiel, but he was becoming angry. Even if he was really good at it, he didn't like taking orders.
“I’m sorry that I'm like this. I don’t mean to be.” The words are muffled into his shoulder. Castiel can barely make them out over the rush of the water. He manages to untwist it into English, and he responds - “You don’t have to be sorry. I just wish you’d talk to me. Can you tell me what’s going on?”
"Yes," Dean nods and breathes, "Sir, please."
So what if Cas has a kid? It doesn't matter. He just never mentioned it or anything. You know, so there's that. Maybe he was just waiting for the right time? Or maybe, he didn't want Dean to know. There's a growing pit of dread in his stomach, aching like an infected wound. That's gotta be something you tell somebody, right? Like, you date someone, you tell them you have kids, that's just how it works.
"Clothes off," Castiel orders, and Dean scrambles out of them. Castiel chuckles at his eagerness. He grabs Dean's leg and swings it over his head, pulling his hips over and then scooting him down the couch until his ass is almost hanging off of it. Castiel settles between Dean's legs, looking at his erect cock and licking his lips. Castiel brings his right hand up and grips Dean's cock loosely, not giving him anywhere near the friction he wants. That he needs.
"I'm human! That's what's wrong!"
"Yeth, Daddy. Want juice!"
Dean sputters, looking up incredulously, "T-teasing? I haven't been teasing you! What the fu-"
"Nothing. Just, you really love him, huh?"
He doesn't know where that came from.
"I'll always be here, baby, I promise." And Castiel drifts off to exhausted sleep with Dean's little voice echoing in his ears.
Dean shakes his head. He literally can't imagine Cas down on his knees with his arms crossed behind his back. Naked, and head bowed, black hair long enough to tug his face up to look at Dean - whoa. Okay. Maybe he can imagine it. He shifts a little in his seat, and Cas catches the movement, smirking at Dean with an eyebrow raised. "I guess you can see it?"
He knew almost nothing of the outside world besides what he saw in the city. He had never really experienced it, and he wanted to, but at the same time, he was terrified. His company was terrible, but at least he wasn't alone. If he left Naomi and Zachariah, he would be alone. Not even that, but jobless, without any sort of trade-worthy skill in which he could earn a living. All he knew was affairs of the church and preaching. That was something he had zero desire in pursuing. At least here he was fed, usually, and clothed. It might not be the most comfortable, but it was a place that at least he knew he had a place in. The thought sounded untrue even in the silence of his mind, so Castel tried to shut it off as best he could. He started counting slowly. By the time he had reached five hundred and fifty-seven he was drifting, and then he slept. It was a thin sleep, but it was rest for his troubled mind regardless.
“Just easing back into this, I guess. Worth it for an orgasm like that, though.”
happens for a reason. This Dean Winchester seems
"Drink?"
Castiel picks up his phone and unlocks it. There are notifications everywhere but most of them aren’t anything important. But one is. Dean called. It might not be anything, but it’s a chance. Castiel doesn’t jump right up and hit the green button. He stops to think about it for a few minutes. It’s not truly a decision or a choice to want Dean. He simply does. It’s a decision and a choice to continue to try to make it work with him. Does he want this? He loves him. In such a short time that annoyingly stubborn and insanely sweet person has come to mean everything to Castiel, so much so that he’s wrapped up in every aspect of Castiel’s life. He wants a life with Dean. Maybe this is a chance at that. The logical part of Castiel’s brain argues that, but the hopeful side ignores it. Besides, if it all goes horrible, at least he already feels like shit so it’s not like he has far to go until rock bottom. It might hurt less that way.
The words send tingles of trepidation and excitement through him. What's Cas gonna do? From some inner pocket of his trench coat that he's still freaking wearing Cas produces a bottle of lube. Oh, fuck yes, finally. Cas maneuvers off Dean's legs and in between them, pushing at the backs of Dean's sweaty knees to get them to spread further. It's a little hot in the room and he's all worked up now. He doesn't remember it being hot a few minutes ago. But then again, he didn't have an angel fondling his balls either, so... Cas frowns and raises his hand in a weird waving gesture off to the side of the bed and Dean feels cool air skate over his overheated skin. He mojoed the thermostat. Awesome. Dean realizes that he feels really exposed like this with a fully clothed Cas kneeling between his spread legs and staring down at his junk like it's the Holy Grail or something.
Cas tilted his head and stared at Dean. "I'm not... I was never really born, Dean. Just... made."
"Mmm." Cas hums inquisitively. His voice is low and suggestive. "You like that, don't you?"
"Oh, God, Sir!" He didn't know it was a vibrating plug! Fuck, that feels so good. It's buzzing wildly inside him, and he's clenching down on it in a rhythm, enjoying the way it moves when he does, and he's soon breathless.
A knock sounds on the door, and adrenaline dumps into his veins. Dean scrabbles the gown on as he calls, "Just a minute! Sorry!"
"Not what I meant."
"Yes."
"No, I not!"
"Casss!"
"What happened?" Dean interrupts and Castiel soothes him, rubbing a hand up and down his back.
"Fine," he concedes, "Maybe a little bit jealous."
his name at the assault of sensation on his senses.
They've been dating for a little over a year now, and Dean couldn't be happier. He and Cas work there way through the women's section and finally find themselves in the men's section. It's chock full of jeans and Nascar t-shirts. There's a big section full of overalls with boots sitting underneath them. Cas is the one that finds the coats. They're hanging on a long rack, and there's actually quite a few there. They're mostly puffy winter jackets with fur lining, and there are some hoodies and stuff. Cas is trying on a black coat, but it's too tight and he sighs heavily and puts it back. He's getting frustrated, which Dean understands, but it's kind of cute when Cas gets all flustered. It makes him want to kiss the frown away. Cas wanders down the aisle away from Dean, trying to find something. After a few more frustrating minutes Cas says exasperatedly, "Dean, none of these are right. I find one I like, but then it has plaid insides, or a mysterious stain across the back of it, or a bathrobe cord instead of a belt. This isn't working. We should just go home."
Castiel sighs and turns his mind back to his task. He needs to finish cleaning the playroom. He's already cleaned it twice, but he wants to be sure he doesn't forget a single thing. This routine process keeps him focused and allows him to think with minimal distraction. He sighs and steps back, observing the room critically. The wood panels on the walls and the hardwood bench gleam and shine in the soft light. The carpet's clean and thick. He ordered it with the thought in mind that his subs would be kneeling on it frequently. He nods to himself and exits, turning the light off and closing the door behind him. It has a lock on it, but he doesn't employ it just now since he'll, hopefully, be coming back down here shortly. His phone buzzes with a text message, and he swipes to open it as he walks up the stairs and into the hallway.
how uncomfortable to drive in. He’s pretty sure he’s got denim burn on his asscheeks (because no, he’s not going to wear a dead man’s underwear. That’s just weird).
"No... please." Dean whimpers and curls into the fetal position. Castiel places a hand on his shoulder and gives him a gentle shake, trying to rouse him.
Castiel rubs his temples as words like abuse and neglect bounce around his mind. "John Winchester is Dean's father. Apparently, he's in the area - or going to be - and he's indirectly threatened to hurt Dean through his younger brother Sam. I wanted to find out what I'm dealing with."
Dean steps forward confidently under Cas's guidance, and when he reaches the wall, Cas spins him around until his back is pressed against it. He captures Dean's lips, enthusiastically making Dean forget his name. Cas's hands roam down to Dean's ass, where he grabs him by the asscheeks and hauls him upwards. It forces Dean up onto the balls of his feet, and his entire body is pressed against Cas. He moans into Cas's mouth, and with a final bite to his bottom lip, Cas pulls away. Dean hears the whisper of rope, and he offers his wrists up without Castiel asking.
John rolls, and grabs Cas's ankle. He yanks it out from under Cas, sending him into the pavement. John climbs on top of him wicked fast and starts punching him in the face. Dean sees the blood fly from Cas's nose and he sees red. All the fear, all the abuse, it all slides away in the face of this new thing.
Bart screamed and the sound drove Dean. He grabbed his lapels with both hands and flung him down the hallway where he crashed in a heap on the floor. Dean was by his side in an instant, turning him over so Dean could look the guy in the eyes. "You filthy piece of-" Dean slammed his fist into Bart's face, reveling in the crack he heard, "Trash." He did it again. And again. When the dude's face was a bloody purple mass of unrecognizable human flesh, he did it again just for good measure. He fell limply to the floor when Dean let him go and hit the wood with another resounding crack. He was probably unconscious. Or maybe dead. He didn't care.
He’d hoped that his old friend could provide some clarity, some balm to his pain. And he does.
Cas leans up on his elbow, facing Dean. "And we will, but I thought I'd tease you a little."
The rest of Dean's week flies by in a blur of engine parts, monetary figures, and phone calls with Cas. The contract goes up to almost thirty-two thousand for the restoration, and Benny's beside himself with glee that looks seriously weird on him, but Dean's glad to see him happy. Hell, he's happy about it too. The garage hasn't been doing
Dean's not exactly sure what to make of that, but he nods.
"Can't say any kind of sex sounds bad with you, Cas."
"Nope. You're the one and only."
"So who was your first Dom?" Dean questions as they chow down on a pineapple and ham pizza they ordered. He knows that people dis them, but he likes the combination, and Cas seems to be pretty ambivalent about it. Castiel chews and seems to regard the question thoughtfully. After he swallows, he begins to speak.
His phone dings with a message notification, and he quickly unlocks it to look.
"Don't want to piss you off."
"Yes - Yes, Sir. That was... awesome." Dean smiles, and the sight is breathtaking. Castiel shakes his head at himself and starts unbinding the rope from Dean's chest. The light red lines sculpting his skin are not angry and raw, just there, thin and beautiful, showing the design wonderfully.
There's another click, and then the vibrator is moving back down his shaft, only to press against his taint. Dean arches up in his binds, trying to get away from the sensation, oh God, it feels so good. He whines even louder when Cas's hand comes up to cradle his balls. The vibrations increase on the dildo in his ass, and Dean feels like he's trembling apart, held together by only thin strands of yarn and trembling moans.
If Dean seems overly nervous, Castiel will ease him into it. They can scene in the bedroom, which is a familiar place for him. But if not... Well, the possibilities the playroom offers are delicious. Castiel takes a deep breath and tries to still his mind. He reassures himself again that he's ready.
"I can't find Cas. I came home and the door was unlocked, all the lights off."
Dean gasps, affronted, “Are you kidding? But he’s like, sculpted. And blond. And that jawline.”
"Shut up! It's all I can afford!"
"Dean, if only you could understand... If only you could see-" His voice breaks and teas slip over his cheeks. Castiel looks up and removes the arm that is pinning Dean. He places his hand on Dean's cheek, just laying it there, cupping his face softly. "If only you could understand the lengths I would go to for you. I miss being an angel with every ounce of my being. I miss it constantly. Because... being human... it isn't worth it without you. I need you too, Dean. Please say something."
"Yeah?"
Dean wraps his arms around Cas's neck and buries his face into Cas's shoulder, trying to control everything surging through him. Cas attacks his prostate with his fingers, and Dean feels the heat rising again. His hole feels so stretched and achy in the best of ways stretched around Cas's fingers. Fuck. This one might hurt. His damn abs are- "Come on, baby boy. Cum for me again. You can do this. Do this for me. Hold on, sweet boy."
"Need- need to cum. Please,” Dean whimpers, exhaustion taking over his pleasure-hazed brain and making him slur his words.  Castiel’s deep voice whispers against his ear, making him shiver and pump his hips into Cas’s hand with the motion.
"I'm glad you've corrupted me, little one."
Then Cas's cock is being guided past his lips and into his mouth. It's warm and velvety smooth - but not as hard as it could be. Dean plans to remedy that.
"Yes. There he is. That's it." Castiel murmurs, pleased. God. Dean is so responsive. He's amazing. Castiel adds a third finger, and Dean twists in his bonds, trying to fuck himself on Castiel's finger. He lets him. The more desperate Dean is for an orgasm, the sweeter the torture of not getting one will be. When Dean is loose and slicked open, Castiel removes his fingers. Dean whimpers.
"What is it, baby?"
"Well, did you win the lottery or something? Or get a raise? I don't understand." Sam shakes his head, obviously confused, his hair flopping down in his eyes.
"Ahh, yeah, I was like fourteen? I don't even remember where we were, some little town in Missouri. Started with a 'B' I think. Her name was Robin. She was a sweet gal. Had the cutest brown hair, all curls. She was older than me, and she played guitar. She was really sweet, nice, I mean. Not like the preppy cheerleader types. She waved at us when we left."
He pulls out of Dean with careful precision, not missing the slight wince flitting through his blissed-out expression. Dear God, that was amazing. His blood is still singing, and his breathing sounds harsh in his ears. Castiel takes a deep breath and moves around Dean's side, where he's panting. Castiel places himself over in front of Dean and slides the blindfold off his face onto the floor, fingers trailing over his skin. He leans over and captures Dean's lips with his. They're slack at first, but he quickly responds. Enthusiastically. Castiel pulls away, murmuring against Dean's lips all the while. He starts trailing the rope with his fingers so he can begin untying him.
"You've done an excellent job, Dean. She seems to be in perfect condition." Dean felt like a maniac but he couldn't help grinning so widely. "Oh, wait till you hear her purr. Sounds like a cougar. Come on, hop in shotgun, hotshot. We're going for a drive." Castiel grinned a wide gummy smile that Dean hadn't really seen in its full glory and it had his undead heart doing donuts, figuratively speaking. Dean slid into the warm leather interior with a feeling of pure contentment, and Cas slid in beside him on the other side. They shut their doors in tandem and without preamble, Dean stuck the key in the ignition and turned her over. Her smooth rumbling sound was music to Dean's ears and he fell in love with her all over again, just like he did everytime he got in her. He looked over at Cas who was a little awed and smiling brightly.
"Would you like to see the kitchen now? I have food waiting."
"Yeah, sometimes."
"I thought so." Castiel smiles. He wonders how Dean will react when he realizes what Castiel has in store for him. Castiel presses it just a bit further inside of Dean until his rim swallows up the narrowed part of the dildo before it flares out at the base. It works something like a plug, and Castiel doesn't have to hold it there. He flicks the switch on the bottom to turn on the vibrations to the lowest setting, and Dean moans, rocking his hips. "Do you like that?"
"No, Dean. Take it, remember? If you can lie still and take what I do to you, you will be rewarded. Be still and you get my cock." Cas's words leave no room for interpretation or argument and Dean is right on board that train.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have the most beautiful soul of anyone I’ve ever met, Dean Winchester.”
"Just trying to level the playing field.
Dr. Bradbury gives him a kind smile, "I understand it might be a bit uncomfortable. The reason I'm requesting that we do further testing is to make sure you get the proper medication that will fit your needs the best. Every person is different, and everyone reacts to medication differently. Some people can spend years trying to find the right medication. I'd like to find out a bit more about you and see if we can't get you a medication that will work right the first time. You also haven't had a physical in..." She glances at her tablet and scrolls a little, "Eight years. So, I don't think it's a bad idea to get you checked out fully and make sure we have the full picture."
"My hand?" Dean understands as soon as the blunt tip of his cock slides over Dean's sloppy hole, and he groans a soft, "Ooh."
"Then - then where did the pacifier come from?" Is Dean crazy or something? Cas's hands fall back to Dean's thighs, and he says, "Remember when we talked about age-play when we were negotiating the terms?"
Dean, oblivious to Castiel's current thoughts, says, "Don't think I'ma be makin' it up those stairs, though."
"Yes, Dean." Fuck, he could get used to hearing that. Cas said his name a lot. He liked it. He wondered what it would sound like when he panting it, gasping, arching up under him as- Shit, nope. Bad brain, bad brain. And bad boner. Crap. Okay, blood first, sexy thoughts later. "You're sure you don't mind?" Cas sighed in exasperation. "No, Dean. It's fine." Alright. Here goes nothing, he supposed.
"Well, there are quite a few dents and scratches across the bumper, I'll have to bump those out, then body fill them, that'll take care of that. Some sanding to that. There's corrosion along the wheel arches. The back one on the left will need to be replaced with a new metal plate. Welded-in. The others I can treat with an acid treatment and get rid of easy enough." Dean bends down and looks at the underside of the car. "You'll need a replacement rocker panel. It's rusted out; the frame will fall apart like that." Dean stands up and opens the driver's side door. It screeches. He peers inside.
“Hello, Dean. I saw that you called yesterday, so… just returning the call.”
Dean nuzzles his nose into Cas's throat and mutters, "I guess just because you're supposed to be stuck with me."
"Hi. Have I been out long?" Dean sits up and rubs his eyes, then yawns and stretches. Damn, his boy is gorgeous. His shirt rode up on his stomach when he stretched, and Castiel caught a flash of tanned skin.
I see you. I want you to cum for me again. You're going to do it, baby boy. Come on. Cum on my cock. Just that. No!"
"Cas. If you do not fuck me now, I will quite literally tie you down to this damn bed and do it myself." Cas's eyes narrow for a moment, then he smiles. It's dark and predatory. Dean realizes he has a raging boner trying to escape his panties, and how is that even possible? Shit, Cas is going to kill him.
"Is that your roundabout way of trying to see how old I am?" Cas gave him a small smile. "I suppose it is."
Also that morning, he nearly breaks his neck tripping over a box sitting outside his door.
That had been freaking fantastic, and that was an understatement. Dean hadn't come that hard in like forever. He laid his forehead against Cas's, sharing breath until he had his breathing under control. "Cas. That was fucking awesome. Mmm." He hummed a light note as Cas tucked him back into his pants and pulled the zipper back up. "I had a similar comment." Cas's dry tone surprised a laugh out of Dean. Well alright then. As his brain fully came back online he realized what he had done. "Uh, Cas. You're covered in cum aren't you?" Cas looked down like it was the most surprising thing he'd ever heard. "Oh. It appears I am."
He mentally yells back and squares himself. He's got this. Partially convinced this time, Dean smiles at the rearview mirror, doing the Blue Steel at his own face, and makes himself laugh. There. That's better.
"That's fortunate."
He brings joy and innocence to life that isn't often found outside of children. He's so very open and vulnerable, and yet tries so hard to appear the opposite. But Castiel sees through it, and he loves it. The trust they both have in the other is a little overwhelming, but it doesn't feel wrong, and he's not worried. He would never intentionally hurt Dean, and he'll do everything in his power to never unintentionally hurt him. He knows things happen, and people will say stuff that hurts the other. But Castiel endeavors to always let Dean know he does not mean him any harm. He deserves all the good things that Castiel can supply him. And he's happy to do that.
"Well... What's your favorite color?"
"I was here before your ass got out of bed this morning, brother. Where you been?"
Dean chuckled lowly. He was nothing but merciful. And he'd be lying through his teeth if he said he hadn't been imagining this for literal years now. Cas was grade A spank bank material, and Dean felt no shame for using that to his full advantage. "That's right, Cas. That's right. Cum for me. Do it now. Cum for me." With a particularly firm jerk of his hand over Cas's hard cock, Cas shattered against him. He moaned unabashedly as he spasmed and shook through his orgasm. His hips stuttered their rhythm but Dean worked him through it, his hand still running over Cas's spasming cock. He was beautiful like this. Head thrown back and pretty pink mouth open, lips wet with spit and not even caring.
He swallows the pill with some water and slurps a fruit cup he had sitting in the cabinet. The chores aren't going to do themselves. He walks over to his stereo and slides in one of his mixtapes. The goliath was a relic from his childhood that somehow still worked thanks to a book from the Columbus Metropolitan Library and some electrical tape. ACDC starts blaring, and he begins to clean.
Castiel nods, "I have. I just wanted my own perspective I suppose. I don't think he'd mind. Something's just felt wrong all day. I don't know how to fix it."
"You might be right about that. She is rather intimidating."
"Yeah. That's just me, Cas." He admits into the dark cave of his arms and the counter.
"This wasn't as random as it seemed then. You've been watching me? Why?" Dean shrugged noncommittally. "I don't know. You're interesting." Castiel narrowed his eyes further, "That is not an excuse to stalk someone, Dean."
He's pistoning into Dean now, and his ass is being pounded in the most filthy of ways. The slick sounds of sex and heavy panting are better than any Led Zepp song right now, and Dean's near delirious on the high of finally getting what he wants. Oh, he's
"They are sensitive. Fantastic. Alright, hands crossed behind your back, baby boy. Like this." He demonstrates with his own hands, and Dean copies the movement behind his back. Cas makes quick work of the knots with his tie, and after only a few moments, Dean's wrists are trapped behind his back.
"Uh." The sheepish grin is back and Dean can't help but feel happy. His brother's back. "Well, I was kind of hoping I could stay with you? Or if you were too busy with Cas and everything I was gonna ask Benny!"
He pulled away from his chapped-looking-but-actually-soft-as-hell lips long enough to mumble. "Okay, Cas?" In response, Cas thrust his hips against Dean's legs with a soft moan, consequently rubbing Dean's erection against Cas, making Dean groan loudly. "Fuck yeah." And he went right back to dominating Cas's mouth. Dean flicked his tongue across the roof of his mouth and hips bucked against him, making him very aware of just how turned on Cas was. Like he said... responsive. It was awesome. Dean grabbed Cas's wrists and encircled them with one hand, bringing them up above his head and holding them there against the brick.
"You will have to excuse me, but..." He really didn't know what to say. "Proof then? That what you're looking for?"
reaches a peak, and he begins to cum. He seizes in his binds, and his legs start to cramp, but he barely cares. When hot, wet heat engulfs his cock, he shrieks and pumps his hips as best he can into Cas’s mouth, spurting cum across his tongue. Colors keep exploding across the back of his eyelids as he continues to orgasm. All the tension seeps out of him in a millisecond. His mind goes white with the final relief, and he buzzes off into an oblivion of pleasure.
Dean starts chortling and tucks his head under Cas’s arm, snuggling closer.
Dean knows that's Cas's way of affirming that Dean's still okay with it without outright asking him. Dean doesn't have any sort of urge to stop, so he says, "Okay."
"It's alright. I'm real. This is real, I promise..." And after a moment, "We're real." Dean breathes a shaky sigh onto Castiel's neck.
"There are special cases." Dean's face was hard and unforgiving.
Using his right hand he typed it out.
Cas smirks. "I think that since I'm the one making and enforcing the rules, that means you're the toddler in this equation."
"I think you know." Dean pushes his ass back against Cas's groin, eliciting a soft groan from him. "You want me this morning too?"
Castiel carefully pulls out of Dean, trying to be careful now that he's so sensitive. "Come now. We're going to take a bath."
Castiel runs his hand through Dean's hair, trying to comfort him, "What do you mean?"
"Hey. Uh, sorry."
"Maybe he went to the store?" Sam offers hopefully.
