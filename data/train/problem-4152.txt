Castiel tilted his head. “It kind of is, yeah, if I’m being honest. I...I honestly didn’t have any kind of...sexual attraction or anything to you, before...before our agreement. But, um...after we talked that night, it was clear to me that you were just…” he huffed a laugh, shaking his head, “exceptional. Wise beyond your years. And you reminded me so much of Gabriel, the way you cared for Sam.”
“No, I'm sure he won't be here that long,” Cas signs somewhat irritably. “He usually takes some kind of lavish vacation for Christmas.” He rolls his eyes.
“Certainly. Although others were intrigued as well. Perhaps not in entirely the same way.” Cas finally grabbed Dean’s plate and moved them to the table, placing it down in front of Dean before sitting across from him. “Eat. Please.”
“Just meant...” Dean swallowed and glanced away. “I don’t have to, y’know, be your...guest. If you don’t want to introduce me. I can be Anael’s friend or whatever.”
“Awesome,” Dean holds up hand. “Gimme five.” The boy giggles and slaps his small hand against Dean’s.
He returned a few moments later, sitting in the same spot and holding out his hand palm up, which Dean eyed curiously. Castiel waited patiently until Dean got the hint, laying his throbbing hand there, which Castiel immediately covered with a small ice pack.
. Castiel handed him the pen and sat back, draping his arm over the back of the couch and watching Dean closely.
their children. Especially over how they present.” Cas shook his head, his tongue pressed to the inside of his cheek. “It’s not something you can control, it’s just...who you are. I don’t care what Rory presents as, because she’s special and important and loved no matter what. It just...frankly, it pisses me off that your parents could just leave you to die because you’re an Omega. But if you had wanted to try to find them...I would understand that, regardless of what happened between you in the past.”
She raised a brow, small smile pulling at her lips. “You’re receptive.” She huffed a laugh, shaking her head and looking down at her feet. “That makes sense.”
"What happened?" She holds out a hand before Dean can answer. "Speak quietly, and calmly. Don't make any sudden movements."
“I’m pretty sure you were drunk, or high…” Dean snorts a humorless laugh, looking down between their bodies. “I think you may have even been trying to call someone else, but you dialed me by mistake. And...your voice, Jesus...I just couldn’t resist it. You had me coming within 3 minutes.”
Lisa giggles softly, then sniffs and fiddles idly with some of the hair that's fallen down around her face, twisting it around her finger over and over as she looks aimlessly out the windshield. There are a few deer in the yard beside Lisa's house, and Dean distracts himself watching them graze for a few moments, letting the silence wash over both of them.
“Yeah,” Dean cleared his throat and looked out the window and down at the big city. “Guess I should. Before he...leaves.”
“Got people coming over?” Sam asked as he hopped up on the counter and watched Dean season the beef.
Dean finally concluded that this was it for them. Chuck knew that the worst thing he could do to them was to let them stew for the rest of their lives. To make them live out the time they had left in their failure, to live in a constant reminder that despite all they had done, everyone they had saved, it never mattered in the end. Everyone was gone, vanished, dead, ceased to exist.
Dean smiles, blush creeping up his cheeks. Admittedly, he'd been pretty preoccupied today. His thoughts flashed back to raven black hair and tongue piercings.
Dean rolled his eyes, although he’d never admit that he really loved when Cas praised him that way, and Cas did it a lot. He picked mindlessly at the hair on Cas’s arm, chewing his lip.
fault then,” Dean teased, slipping his arm around Cas’s waist shyly to bring them a little closer. His heart skipped at how forward he was being, but it was okay. It was just him and Cas right now, no pup eyes on them or anyone else. He only felt this comfortable around Alpha and he wanted to explore it.
Cas let out a relieved breath and scrubbed a hand down his face. “You think I don't want you just as badly? Knowing you're here waiting for me, slicking for me, knowing you're carrying our pup in your womb?” He shook his head, looking desperate. “I want you
“Sure.” Dean swallowed again, finally remembering himself and getting in the car, turning the engine over. He backed out of the drive and started down the road. “So, uh. What are you goin’ back to New York for?”
“I’m only demanding because you spoiled me,” Dean muttered, resting his chin on Castiel’s shoulder, sighing as the man wrapped his arms around him.
“T-tell me more,” Dean gasped, grasping for something to focus on. “What else do you want to do to me, Alpha?”
“Oh, okay. Great,” Dean licked his lips, casting Yulia a glance. She was nice enough and he was trying not to let his silly jealousy make him hate her unnecessarily. Even though she can make Castiel laugh and he looked more at ease with her than he ever did with Dean.
“I have no doubt you will be just as successful, if not more so,” Castiel said seriously. “You just need the opportunity to show what you can do. Which I can give you.”
“Beautiful,” Castiel whispered into his skin, a hand resting on his waist and stroking the rope that bound him. “Perfect, baby. That was so
Cas tilted his head and chewed on the inside of his cheek. “The meat thing could just be your body needing the protein after giving birth…” he murmured, though he didn’t look too convinced.
Dean's eyes search Castiel's for another brief moment before he fists into his shirt, pulling him flush against his body and crushing their lips together again. Cas kisses back with a vengeance, practically gyrating against Dean's torso with vigor, and when he brushes against Dean's hard cock, Dean lets out an undignified moan that allows Cas to slip his tongue inside, and it's moving hot and slick against his own. Cas is a fucking ocean, hitting him with wave after wave before Dean even gets the chance to get back up, he's everywhere and flooding him with sensation and Dean can barely
“It’s only because I want you so much, daddy,” Dean purred, glancing down at Castiel’s crotch and shuddering visibly.
a carrier, which makes your carrier genetics stronger than most nowadays. You even had a strong chance at being a shifter. It’s incredibly rare to find one like you and now we have Sam as well. It just makes me very...hopeful.”
Dean grits his teeth. “Then why are you here, Cas? Huh? Why’d you even come back? Do you even realize how hard these past few months have been for me? Cause maybe you didn’t feel the way I did, but it’s still fucked up to disappear on someone you knew cared about you, maybe even-” a lump forms in his throat and he swallows past it, looking down so Cas doesn’t notice the sudden shine in his eyes.
She nodded and let go of his legs, tugging her hat down a little too far over her eyes. Cas pulled it off her head and tossed it on the table, ignoring her protests.
Suddenly Castiel pulled away, his hand slipping from Dean’s cock, the sound of the belt being tossed on the bed and the shuffle of footsteps. Dean blinked and breathed deep, arching and pulling, but Castiel wasn’t behind him or beside him. He could hear the man, but his presence felt so far away, too far, and an eternity that was really only a matter of seconds passed through Dean that he would later remember as one of the most irrational but worst moments of his life.
“Hey,” Sam says after a bout of silence, “you gonna be okay? I mean, Christmas alone...been a long time since we haven’t spent Christmas morning together. I know it’s hard for you-”
Castiel came into view and Dean’s eyes zeroed in, watching the Alpha walk off towards the kitchen. Dean sighed when he lost sight of him, then rolled his eyes at himself.
He kissed Dean’s hand, then finally turned to him and frowned, pressing his lips together. “You don’t like it when I drink.”
Dean shifted from foot to foot, chewing on his lip. He’d had a system before, supplies built up over years of scavenging. But that was all gone now and he didn’t know how much he could rely on Benny.
Cas grins, his eyes crinkling in the corners, and Dean thinks it’s probably the most beautiful smile he’s ever seen. “So I fucked you once and you’re hungry for more?”
For probably the hundredth time, Dean wonders if Cas meant those words or if they were simply uttered in the heat of the moment, brought on by the haze of afterglow.
"Precisely." Cas narrows his eyes and cocks his head, giving Dean a thorough once-over. "What can I do for you?"
Dean shyly thrust up as Cas snapped forward, making them both groan. Dean’s head fell back and he did it again, meeting each slow thrust with one of his own. They rocked gently, which Dean appreciated. He knew, of course, that it mostly because Cas couldn’t move any faster. But he also knew that even if Cas wasn’t injured, he would have gone slow this first time.
Not that Dean was into Benny, per se, but he was an attractive guy, something that Dean was embarrassingly aware of. But with Benny being his best friend, Dean was not about to fuck that up.
When they kissed, though, Dean became wonderfully lost. Everything else faded away, including most thought process, and all he knew was
Cas ran his tongue around his rim again, slowly pushing in a finger to the second knuckle, followed by his tongue. Dean groaned and arched, his cock hard between his legs. He rocked back and Cas pushed a second finger in, causing his hole to clench around them. He felt Cas’s tongue disappear and then Cas was kissing him again, steadily rocking his fingers in and out.
Cas looks down at their hands for a long time, pulling his lip between his teeth. He pulls his hands away, hesitating again before signing:
“Dean,” Castile huffed. “Lecture me later. I’m pinned underneath the fucking dishwasher and I’ve been here for an hour. Please, just-“
“Jesus, Cas, yes, I’m sure.” He rolled his eyes, flopping onto his back. He looked back up at him apologetically and reached up, patting Castiel’s cheek. “I’m fine. I’m great. You don’t have to keep asking.”
“I simply wanted him here,” Castiel finally spoke, reaching for Dean’s hand under the table and giving it a squeeze. “Is my personal life so interesting? Let us move on.”
“Shut up, jerk,” Sam laughed, going quiet a few moments later. “So, are you just...not coming back?”
The door opened slowly and Sam stood in the crack, looking down nervously, his hand still on the doorknob.
Something about that made him seem more human to Dean. Or perhaps more ethereal. He isn't sure which.
, but he was...anxious. The fear was in the background, threatening to ruin everything if he even gave it so much as a thought.
Dean sighed and finally turned away, walking towards the bed and crawling in next to Cas. Alpha’s arms immediately pulled him close and Dean chuckled when he felt lips on his neck. He tilted his head, letting Cas scent him properly and loving that he could do this now without tensing with fear.
He took a deep breath and walked over, making sure he had Dean’s attention before bringing a hand up to his neck and resting it there.
He shook his head and rubbed furiously at his watery eyes. “I-I don't...know exactly. Um,” he furrowed his brow and thought hard. He’d worked to block out the memories for so long it was difficult to dig them back up. “Maybe...a year….or less, after my first heat…” Dean pressed on his belly despite the tenderness. That night had been a nightmare, but it was nothing compared to the following weeks.
He waited for Cas to move away then hopped down from the counter and walked over to Rory’s bedroom. He cracked the door open and slipped inside, shutting it behind him softly. Dean gazed at the sleeping girl for a moment then approached the bed, kneeling down and poking her gently on the nose.
“Then what I’m saying is,” Castiel looked up at him, meeting his gaze, “if we’re doing this, if we’re going to be together...he had to know eventually. And while this wasn’t the opportune time, and surely not how I would have preferred it to go...it has to now. So we will work with what we have, and we will get through it.”
Dean shivers noticeably, and Cas chuckles. He leans heavily onto Dean, draping himself over him, his head coming to rest at Dean's right shoulder. Dean looks over at him, his eyes a little wide, mouth hanging open and panting slightly. Cas is smirking. Of course he is.
“Ellen’s just jealous she didn’t get a ride,” Dean smirks as he thrusts his hips forward dramatically. He slathers a patty with BBQ of his own making, along with some cheddar cheese and a side of onion rings. “Sammy,” he calls out, placing the plate in the window.
He finally stood on trembling legs and peered outside of his door, eyes dancing around nervously. A few pack members were already up and going, doing whatever it was that they do. Most past by him without a glance, but a couple did look his way curiously. Dean searched anxiously for Benny and almost jumped when the big Beta was suddenly rounding the corner of his cabin and at his door.
Cas instinctively tightened his hold on Dean, causing the man to grunt in his sleep. Castiel frowned and loosened his arms only a bit, that feeling of contentment rapidly fading. What he’d learned after he finally reunited with Sam and Dean was rolling around in his head. Sam had pulled himself aside once they had gotten back to the bunker, expressing concern for Dean and his behavior as of late.
Dean looked at their hands under the surface of the water and slotted their fingers together. Castiel frowned down at them, rubbing his thumb against Dean’s.
"Alright then, it's about time." He pulls the keys to the Impala out of his pocket and tosses them to Dean. He grabs Dean's shoulder, squeezing it tightly. "You look spiffy, son. Have the Braedens take photos so I can see Lise, too."
“Behave, boy,” Castiel said, voice deceptively soft in Dean’s ear. “You’re going to hurt yourself if you keep pulling on them like that, and then I’m going to have to take them away. I’ll take away the spankings, too. Do you want that?”
Dean tried to keep himself from fidgeting as Castiel continued to feed him- slowly, purposefully, patiently- until he was hard as a rock in his pants, which Castiel either hadn’t noticed or was very intentionally pretending not to. He stopped himself, probably for the fiftieth time, from reaching out and putting his hands on the man, instead closing his eyes as Castiel fed him another bite.
“Sweet, touch-starved boy,” he rumbled in his ear, swiping a thumb over Dean’s slit and spreading the precum down his shaft. “Well, now...you won’t last very long at all, will you?”
“Basic is best for a beginner,” Cas says, looking to a row of plain dildos. “And I don’t want you using one bigger than me, so we’ll keep it around...this size.” He points at a plain black dildo that looks to be around six inches long, and even that looks too big. Dean vaguely wonders how all of Cas even fit, because he was definitely larger than that, and he’s already wondering how the hell he’s going to get the thing in his ass.
have a masseuse somewhere in it, I hope? Anyway, you have about two hours, Castiel. And I’ll call mother
Dean clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes, but didn’t bother to argue. He was getting used to the constant bombardment of compliments from Cas, even if he still felt undeserving of them.
They were about to fight. A classic Dean and Cas showdown. Right there in the middle of aisle 12, over a bag of cat food.
“Ohh, Garth,” Donna beamed and placed a hand over her heart. “You’ll love him; he’s fantastic. He’s just…” Donna took a few steps and pointed past Dean, at a small cabin off to itself down a path that led down next to the main row of cabins on the right. “Try to keep an open mind, okay Dean? Garth is a little eccentric but he’s really good at what he does.”
“Looks like we'll be taking turns on pup duty tonight,” he teased, nodding at Rory’s door. “If she's slept this long, no way she goes back to sleep tonight.”
anything; he sees the sunlight and the laugh lines and the shadow in each and every thing on this planet...something that most people need filters to see. Cas sees more than people were surely meant to see. Cas takes something seemingly one-dimensional, and he sees the very soul of it.
“Well, I don’t offer much information about myself to many,” Castiel shrugged. “I prefer to keep to myself most of the time.”
Cas clears his throat, looking over at Audrina. "She wasn't a shit mother. At least, not always. I can remember...some really good times with her too. A long time ago."
Dean shook his head and waved a hand dismissively, then reached out and took Castiel’s free hand and gave it a squeeze. “Nothin’ to apologize for.”
He shifted slowly and pulled Dean to him, nuzzling the top of his head gently with his chin. “I love you very much, Dean.”
Dean wants to say something, but all he manages is a small cough. Even if he wants to say no for the sake of his beloved car’s interior, he can’t deny that the idea of being fucked right there in his backseat makes him hard. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat, cutting his eyes briefly over at Cas.
Dean opened the door to the kitchen and Rory bounded inside, directly up to the serving line, where Missouri was adding spoonfuls of eggs to trays.
Cas eyed him for a moment longer before answering. “I rebuilt your body, completely. I put your soul back in place. Now your essence, what makes you
Cas's expression softens and he tilts his head at Dean, his pink lips parted and his brow furrowed. "You can't save everyone, my friend."
Cas says nothing, just lets his mind wander back to when he was just 4 years old, before Alistair, before Naomi lost her job and the drugs drained the last bit of her personality. Gabriel and Michael were off at school, and Naomi had only just left him with the babysitter and went off to work before she was back, scooping Cas up in her arms and littering his face with kisses, her blue eyes crinkling with her wide smile. Cas's eyes did that now, a cruel reminder of her each time he caught a glimpse of himself smiling in a reflection. He'd all but stopped smiling altogether.
“Well, I think you’re interesting,” Aurora said confidently, shoving her hands in her jacket pockets. She looked around and her eyes widened a little when she spotted Charlie across the compound, talking to one of the other Omegas, no doubt looking for the mischievous pup. “Uh oh. Gotta go!”
“Yeah,” Garth picked up his cup again and raised it to his lips, then seemed to remember himself, tapping his forehead and shaking his head. “Oh, yes. I’m sorry. That’s what I like to call this place. It doesn’t really have an official name, and Castiel thinks the nickname sounds sacrilegious, but I think it fits.”
He looks down, not really understanding why he’s so...sad. He barely knows the guy and Sam is right; he hits on everything that moves. Cas probably saw right through the flirty smiles and, being too nice, left instead of telling Dean he wasn’t interested. Still, Dean worries for Cas. At the very least, Dean could have given him a lift to wherever his brother lived. He doesn’t like the idea of the guy walking the streets at night.
He turns back to see Cas still standing on the balcony, once again oblivious to any and everything that wasn’t what he was seeing at that very moment. Cas is on his tiptoes, leaning as far over the balcony as he safely can, his head still up and looking out over the ocean.
“So…” Dean shifted to lay on his side, facing Castiel. “It’s amazing that I actually care about you?”
“It’s not his fault,” Dean said quickly, his hands twitching. “It’s just how dad did things. And he’s not
“Cher, you gotta...I mean, you can't just-” he let out a deep breath. “It'll kill you, man. The fever… it'll eat you up. You need a knot.”
Dean nodded and Castiel smiled, taking his hand and leading him to the kitchen. He took his spot on the counter, swinging his legs as Castiel set about making lunch. He dug out fresh vegetables and sliced them up expertly, and Dean wasn’t all that surprised since the man apparently used knives on humans. For
“Uh, mostly maintenance stuff,” Dean licked his lips. “House is big, you know? Requires a lot of care. Runnin’ toilets, squeaky floorboards...stuff like that. Some of his big lights up in the ceiling needed changing. Ceiling is so damn high you gotta get a ladder.”
“That easy to soothe me, you think?” Death arches a brow as he leans on his cane. “This is about Sam’s hallucinations, I assume-”
it. He opened his mouth, ready to put this discussion six feet under where it belonged just like every dead thing that wanted to pop up in his life. But, goddamnit, Jack’s face fell and he was doing a very good impression of Sam’s Puppy Dog Face #23 and Dean caved.
The words were barely out of his mouth when Castiel brought his hand down against his backside again, twisting his fingers inside, brushing tantalizingly against his prostate. Dean panted, laying a hand on the glass beside his cheek, pushing back against Castiel’s hand.
“Why did you decide to become a Dom?” Dean asked, the question slipping out before had the good sense to stop it.
“Don’t.” Dean stood up abruptly, leaving his food half eaten, and walked out of the room. Sam didn’t follow.
Dean looks at her out of the corner of his eye to find she has an interested brow quirked. She turns almost all the way to him in her seat, lowering her voice.
“You better not cancel!” Charlie pointed a finger at him, lowering her voice to a hissed whisper: “I get that you’re in a new exciting relationship or whatever with a hot older guy, but we’re still your friends. We don’t have long before we’ll all be going our separate ways-”
Dean closed his eyes and inhaled slowly, trying to decide if he was frustrated or touched by Castiel’s thoughtfulness. It made sense and it showed Castiel actually cared, but it didn’t his current situation. Being which he
“Alright, Dean, time to spill it,” she taps a black nail and quirks a pierced brow. “Why are you sharing shakes with Castiel Novak?”
“Yes. Because they were waiting for Jack. Because they were waiting to end God.” Cas squeezed his hand again, silent until Dean looked back up at him. “I could, theoretically, keep you alive, if it’s what you’d prefer. I could keep you young, we could continue to hunt. But is that what you want?”
Dean looked up at him and almost immediately away again, unable to let the fierce gaze see through him now.
Dean took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to pull his focus back on keeping up with the conversation around him. It was difficult, though, keeping his mind off Castiel. Even though he hardly saw the man, ever since that night at the party-or, even more, that night Castiel spoke those words to him- Dean had slowly sank into an admittedly unhealthy obsession. One would think after two years the crush would’ve cooled off, but it only seemed to grow hotter.
Eileen grinned, clearly amused from the whole thing. She lifted her hands to sign, ignoring Sam’s eye roll. “Ignore him. He’s just jealous that we aren’t in the honeymoon phase anymore.”
Dean blinked down at Castiel, taking in the pursed lips and the oddly anxious tapping of his finger. Dean snorted and grinned, eyes sparkling.
“Because...I…” Dean frowned, his hand finding Castiel’s in the dark and lacing their fingers together. “‘Cause I wanted to be with you.”
Additionally, we would both appreciate you looking out for our next long chaptered fic, Profess Unto Me, which is going to be posted in the SPN Canon Big Bang on July 20th. *Follow us on Tumblr at @holytrenchcoatedsubtextchuck and @deanmon69 for promos*
Castiel paused briefly and Dean froze, wondering if perhaps he’d pushed a little too far. But Castiel finally chuckled softly and wrung the loofah out over Dean’s chest.
“I don’t need to be taken care of, Dean!” Sam finally shouted, loud enough to make Dean jump slightly and make the dog next door start barking from the window facing their house. “God, you’re always throwing that in my face, about how you have to do everything for me so you can’t do anything else, and I never asked for you to do that! Stop blaming the way your life turned out on
The shopkeeper’s bell clangs behind them, but Dean doesn’t bother to look up. This time of the day, it’s likely Kevin with his fucking laptop coming to set up shop for the remaining hours of operation.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean mumbles, taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly. “Guess it wasn’t so bad.”
His hand fell limply at his side and he continued on. Into the kitchen, where Dean would cook his greasy burgers and Sam would make his salads. Cas never ate, of course, but he’d sit with them. Sometimes in silence, after a hard hunt. Sometimes with conversation, lighthearted and easy.
Dean swallowed and nodded, raising shaky hands to grip the hem of his shirt and pull it over his head with one quick motion. He was about to toss it on the floor before he remembered what Castiel had told him about his clothes in the den, and he stopped, folding it instead, which seemed to please Castiel. He sat the shirt on the table, kicked off his shoes, and started on his belt buckle, then slowly unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans, pushing them down and pulling them off, then folding them neatly as well. He took his socks off next and added them to the pile, then took a deep, steadying breath before finally pushing his boxers down and folding those, pointedly ignoring Castiel’s intense stare as he piled them on top of the rest of his clothes.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re really funny,” Dean snorts as he picks up the phone on the nightstand, pressing the button for room service. “Quit mopin’ and take your medicine.”
One hand rested on Cas’s chest while the other slipped down and under his shirt to spread across his stomach. Dean played with the hair just under Cas’s belly button and began purring softly, his chest vibrating against Alpha’s.
Our new fic is a season 6 canon divergent exploring the possibility of Godstiel, titled Profess Unto Me.
“That’s why I’m gonna go outside,” Cas responded easily, tucking the joint behind his ear and rifling through a drawer for a shirt, which he slipped over his shoulders.
This story is already complete in Google docs. The entire story is about 195k words- epilogue included. We're also finishing up a time stamp, which is currently at 14k words, projected probably somewhere between 16k and 20k words.
Castiel nodded subtly and hit the joint again, sitting it in a small ashtray as he exhaled. He scrubbed his hands through his hair and sniffed loudly, then cleared his throat. His hands fell to his lap and he looked directly at Dean, one eyebrow slightly raised.
on the paper. He had thought this would be easy, getting to pick his own and all. Something stupid. Like, eat more pie. Exercise less. Go get laid.
He still had so many questions about it, but that was for another time. They finally had some time to themselves. An entire day and night. No pups, no pack business. Just the two of them.
It was difficult keeping information from Sam and Dean, especially when Crowley was involved. But Crowley and the souls from Purgatory was a necessary evil, or so Cas told himself. Killing Balthazar was another unfortunate necessity, although Cas found it to be inexplicably painful. Tearing down the wall in Sam’s brain wasn’t as easily done as Castiel had anticipated. But the worst part was Dean—intelligent, level-headed Dean—ignoring everything that pointed to Cas’s betrayal in favor of putting his trust in his best friend. He wanted so badly to believe Cas, he almost wished Dean could be right about him. Dean always had faith in him, when nothing and no one else did. Knowing that made it harder.
Dean turns to look at Cas, whose hair is wilder than normal and whose pupils are blown wide, almost no blue visible. Cas is stoic and serious, and Dean watches as he retracts his hand from Dean's cock and raises it to his lips, his pierced tongue darting out and licking off a long stripe of come, using a pointer finger to spread it over his tongue. He closes his mouth around the finger, closing his eyes, and he sucks softly, a peaceful look on his face.
Cas didn't move at first, nails biting harshly into Dean's skin. He unclenched the fingers in Dean’s hair and stroked gently, his voice coming out a soft growl. “Are you sure? Do you want this?”
“Y-yeah, but-” he coughed and shifted Jack, thinking it might be strange to be doing this with the pup still in his arms. “We haven’t had time to really...you know, enjoy each other. Last night was so rushed...even if you
Another loud smack landed and Dean choked on a yelp, fighting hard to keep it down and utterly failing. His cock twitched and he whined as Castiel fingered the wet slit, toying with him.
Garth hummed and nodded, his eyes narrowed. “Why do you think you presenting Omega caused them to abandon you?”
Yulia sighed and leaned against the wall, crossing her arms over her chest. Dean thought he saw a look of guilt pass over her features before she quickly wiped it clean.
He was pressed up against Cas, not a sliver of space between them. Alpha’s scent was comforting, surrounding him like a thick blanket that Dean wanted to curl inside of. For all that solid muscle, Cas was very comfortable to lay against. So much so Dean would probably fall asleep if he wasn’t so determined to have some alone time with Cas.
Dean gives a shrug that he hopes looks as nonchalant as he intends, swallowing hard and clearing his throat. “Could be fun.”
When it was all said and done, Dean’s still not sure how it all happened. He was surrounded by demons, a stupid trap he fell for by his desperation to get to Cas. He fought desperately, but he knew he wouldn’t last. Sam had been separated from him, along with Ruby’s knife. It was a matter of minutes, seconds, before the black eye bastards took him down.
Dean orders a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate milkshake, and Cas orders a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. Kim jots it all down in her notebook and flips it shut, tucking it into her old apron before walking back into the kitchen without another word.
“No. Stop,” Dean said firmly, and to his credit, Castiel’s hand dropped and he instead used it to prop himself up on the bed as Dean unbuckled his pants.
Dean licked his lips, foggy breath coming out in huffs. He hesitated only for a moment before nodding.
Cas returns with his converses and sits down on the couch, looking up at Dean as he pulls one shoe on and ties it. “Thought about what kinda toy you want?”
Dean opens his mouth and hesitates, furrowing his brow. “Oh. Um. Well...yeah, I guess I...didn’t really think that one through.”
He's squeezing his legs so tightly his nails are leaving marks in his calves, but he barely feels it. He's taking deep, panicked breaths, never quite feeling like he's able to get enough air in his lungs. His eyes are watery and glassed over, his stomach is turning, and all he can think about is how fast he can get to the toilet if he needs to puke.
“Boss is worried, chief.  He's not gonna like it if you keep fighting it.” Benny sat down on the end of the bed, bending the brim of his hat between his hands. “He wanted me to check in on you specifically. He's seen what can happen to Omegas with incomplete heats. It's dangerous.”
“Well,” Cas said quickly, groaning as he leaned up to ash the joint in the tray, “this isn’t gonna stop me from claiming you, anyway.”
Sam rolls his eyes, munching on his chicken sandwich. “Do you have to hit on everything that moves?”
Dean sighs heavily, squirming restlessly against the bed that had become increasingly uncomfortable over the past week. The room is mostly dark aside from the glow of the moon through the window and the light of the television. It's late and Sammy had long gone to bed. John, of course, had left earlier on another trip after having been home with Dean since the incident. He hadn't wanted to leave again so soon, but Dean insisted he was fine, and that he would make sure Sam was taken care of. He would be returning to school soon again himself, but it would be several weeks before he could join the football team even for practice again.
It wasn’t until Jack’s discontent morphed into full blown unhappiness that Dean finally pulled himself up, chugging half the glass of water before getting to his feet. He lifted Jack out of the crib and held him to his chest, long past needing to guide him to the nipple. He held him with one arm across his body and cradled his head as Jack latched and began to suckle, and Dean walked over to the kitchen in search of his own food, rubbing his eyes with his free hand.
Dean stared hard at the water for a long while, running his tongue along his fangs. “I don’t remember having a home,” he finally said slowly, as if he had to think about each word, which was almost true. “I must’ve...but…” he shrugged and blinked when his rod gave a jolt, but then it fell still again. “I presented young, I think. Dad was Alpha and didn’t want an Omega son. I woke up one day, and him and mom were gone. That was it. Was on my own from then on.” Dean paused and thought hard. “Was just a kid. Don’t know how old I was...don’t really know how old I am now.”
He heard John come in about an hour later and the tv cut on almost immediately after. Sam never came back for money, or to ask him for a ride, but sometime that night after John had gone to bed and Dean was on his third
Cas shifted in his seat, sitting his sandwich down on its napkin. “Well. Yes. And knowing your...um. Previous sexual partners-”
"I'm not an idiot, Cas. I mean, I know you don't do the relationship thing. But whatever this is with Winchester...it's not
He waved to Donna and Jody on his way to the infirmary, finishing off his toast and sidestepping some pups playing tag. Dean wiped the crumbs on his jeans (newly patched up thanks to ‘LiLi’) and stepped into the long cabin. They were a bit busier today, with two pups who seemed to have a cold and a Beta whose arm was being fixed into a sling.
Dean clears his throat. “How ‘bout a little break? Go lay out, maybe grab some lunch. What do you say?”
Dean clicked his tongue and closed the pantry. “I doubt he thinks that way, dad. Like you said, he’s just...busy.”
“Fine. But it’s true, and now you and I will both know it.” Dean looks smug as he spins his keys around his pointer finger, then opens the door and gets out without another word. He’s halfway to the door when he feels Cas behind him.
“It looks like you’ve bound me,” Death holds up a pale wrist and the translucent chains holding him dangle daintily, looking far too weak to hold a Horseman.
"I...okay. Yeah, okay." Dean pulls his head slightly to the side, then stands, offering a hand to Cas. Cas reluctantly reaches out to take it, and Charlie and Dean haul him to his feet. She snakes an arm around his waist and he leans heavily onto her, arms thrown around her neck.
Jack watched curiously as Castiel silently handed a still mostly sleeping Dean fresh mug of coffee. Jack didn’t care much for the bitter drink, but the Winchester brothers seemed to live off it. Castiel didn’t drink it either, but he knew how to make it. For Dean. Just the way Dean liked it. And Jack watched, fascinated, as Dean took the mug with a soft grunt and cradled it to his chest.
Dean huffed a laugh, shaking his head slightly. “Yeah. I dunno why...well, no, that’s not true. I know Cas doesn’t tell me things cause we’re...we’re not…” he trailed off, not wanting to say the words that would complete that sentence.
Finally, he was back. He was home. His grace sung, content and warm, with his human lying next to him. Dean’s soft breathing tickled his ear, his scruff scratching against Castiel’s shoulder as the hunter slept. An arm was slung possessively across Castiel’s chest, calloused fingers clutching at his side almost desperately. Castiel understood this. He’d been torn apart from his hunter too many times, and he wasn’t stupid enough to believe the debacle with Asmodeus was the last.
Cas reaches down and slides both of his hands up Dean's thighs and around to his ass, the mixed come leaving a thick trail everywhere Cas's hands touched. He spreads their spend on Dean's thighs, his ass, and partway up his back as he draws Dean up to him and gives his shoulder a small bite, then kisses it.
hungry; in fact, it's been a few days since he's had any kind of appetite, despite Charlie's constant insistence that he eat something. He can tell by the way his shorts are hanging precariously low on his hips that he's even lost a few pounds, his hipbones jutting out sharper than normal. He does his best to pull them up as he walks, but they immediately slide back into their former position.
She sighed for probably the hundredth time and turned to him, hands on her hips, looking very much like her older brother.
“Right. Well, before things get out of hand,” he says quickly when they pull apart, “I should start on dinner. Spaghetti okay?”
“Yeah,” Dean coughed, cleared his throat. “Anyway, I meant requests for the house. Anything you want?”
Dean blushed, having not realized he’d been speaking out loud, and cleared his throat. “What, you don’t sense it? The impending doom?”
Of course Cas doesn't answer, Dean's not even sure he can...but he scrambles to his feet and runs to the bathroom door, unbolting it and swinging it open. It doesn't take long to find Charlie in the crowd; her bright red hair shines like a beacon under the lights on the dance floor. He sprints to her and grabs her arm, spinning her around, a look of shock plastered on her face.
Castiel smiled slyly, tugging gently on the hair on the back of Dean’s head, pulling him close to whisper against his lips:
“He's wary, especially so for an Omega his size. Can't hardly get him to say a full sentence. Shifty, distrusting…” Benny paused and sighed. “He doesn't want to take a knot during his heat. At all. He's - he's gonna go without.” Benny clicked his tongue. “Been around awhile, man. Tended to a lot of Omegas since I been here, double that at other places before here. I think we gotta bigger problem than a scared Omega. They're all scared. This ain't that.”
It was red and swollen, his lip split and swollen as well. He'd cleaned it up a little and the residual blood had dried, some of it caked along the split.
Dean nodded and closed the door, adjusting Jack in his arm. “Matter of hours, I think. By tonight for sure.”
“I…” Cas swallowed and tried again. Dean blinked up at him sleepily, but his fuzzy mind would catch up quickly enough.
“What if you decide you want to be an angel again?” Dean asked, holding the knife steady, his knuckles white.
“It’s an expression, Cas,” Dean chuckled as he began cleaning up the mess they’d made. “And anyway, we’re bonded through your grace. I’d say that counts as married.”
“Take your medicine?” he asks, and Cas nods against his chest. “May have to take you back again, if it doesn't clear up.”
Anael opened her mouth to speak but a hand gripped the door from behind and then Castiel was there, looking as casual as he'd ever seen him with a t-shirt and a pair of joggers on. His eyes were burning holes through Dean's skull though, and Dean tried to think of another time the man had ever been actually mad at him.
“Of course,” Cas said sagely, smoke billowing from his mouth after another drag. He offered it to Dean, who took it and inhaled fairly easily. He was getting better at it and the way it loosened him up was nice.
“I made him come with me,” Anael said, not the least bit bothered by Castiel’s anger. “So get over it. He can be here as
“I’m ready for bed now,” Cas murmured against his lips and Dean nodded, rubbing his cheek against Alpha’s scruffy chin.
“I'm not ashamed, Dean,” Cas signs, because even if he can’t speak he can still apparently read minds. “It's just that Gabriel has been trying to hook me up with people for years and I keep telling him I’m not interested and I wouldn't hear the end of it if I told him about you. Obviously I'm going to tell him when he arrives, but I didn't want to listen to his incessant teasing every time I spoke to him.”
Castiel hummed and released Dean’s wrists, giving him a firm look. “Keep those above your head, boy.”
“I’m not-not sure,” Dean squeezed his eyes shut and exhaled roughly. “You were...s-spanking me. I was almost there...and then-I dunno, you pulled away-“
Dean huffed and, at Castiel’s permission, added a third finger. He squirmed, breathing hard, scissoring his fingers and stretching himself slowly. His other hand returned to his cock reluctantly and he already missed Castiel’s girth. He stared up at Castiel, eyes pleading, mouth hanging open as he arched-
Dean nodded around a mouth full of apple pie, cheeks bulging out as he tried to speak. “Thash goo’.”
I'm also feeling very good tonight, because I finally went to a doctor today that has prescribed me medication for my depression and anxiety. I'm only telling you guys because I want you to know that I've struggled with these illnesses for several years, and I'm only JUST getting help for it.
“Oh, yeah?” Dean finally looked up at him. “How? Jack’s off grid. Has he answered any of your prayers? ‘Cause he sure as hell won’t answer mine.”
Cas and the boy blink and look around, and the boy settles on some tiny shells imbedded in the sand. He places them carefully inside the mote and grins up at Dean.
“But he didn’t do the job,” Dean threw his hands up. “How many times have you come home complaining about him? He’s the reason you had to do overtime on my birthday. Castiel is fair, but he doesn’t seem the type to pay people for shit performance. Gordon took advantage of you, Castiel, everybody.
Cas glances over at him, his eyebrows drawn into a frown. He doesn't yell, he doesn't curse, he doesn't really even look all that mad. He clears his throat and opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. He closes it again, staring straight ahead.
he really missed this. Cas’s lips are just he remembers, albeit a little chapped, but still soft and perfect.
“Hey, I really mean that,” Dean says cheekily, reaching across the table to take Cas’s hand briefly before the boy yanked it away, his face red.
Sometimes Dean swore he saw the trueform, despite knowing it’s impossible. There would be wings. Huge, black, shimmering with colors he’s never seen before. Eyes, hundreds of them. Multiple arms, hands tipped with claws that handled him so gently. Broken horns, shimmering grace, feathers surrounding him.
He pulled away to lay his head beside Cas’s, his hand resting on his chest and playing with the blanket. “How are you feeling? It looks like you’re hurting more today.”
He moaned low in his throat when Castiel took his cock in his hand again, his legs trembling uncontrollably. Castiel stroked him slowly with his thumb and middle finger, stopping briefly to thumb his slit.
Dean lost track of time. Between bouts of fucking and being fucked into oblivion with his angel, then subsequently sleeping it off in Castiel’s arms, it was very possible that a few days had passed. Sam and Eileen kept clear from his room, undoubtedly after hearing all the noise. Dean was a noisy fuck and did nothing to hold himself back.
Dean frowned, taking another sip of his coffee and tapping his finger against the side of the mug. It sounded like Cas would be here for a while longer. And when he
Castiel chuckled, standing up and taking Dean’s hand between his own, giving it a squeeze before leading him back out of the bathroom, through the den and down the steps. “Small steps, sweet boy. Don’t get greedy. This is not something you want to overindulge in.”
He whimpered, his heart in his throat. Fingers weren’t new, but what they were leading to was. He wasn’t afraid, he really
The next few hours were excruciating, the heat and cramps coming in strong waves. Then the worst part hit, the contraction- like pain, the overwhelming need to have something, anything inside him. But he resisted, like he always did, grinding his teeth through each urge, fangs distended. In a day or two's time that urge would become a need, a need for a knot, for something to extinguish the fire building within him.
Even as the song eventually comes to an end, Dean keeps on humming to any tune that comes to mind. Cas seems happy with that, moving to rest his cheek on Dean’s shoulder. Dean, along with the soft current of the water, sways them gently back and forth.
, she'd been so quiet Dean had actually almost forgotten she was there. Not that Rory wanted to be anywhere but with Dean lately anyway, the idea of her presentation keeping her on edge, even while not
“Fuck.” Castiel’s voice was just the slightest bit unsteady, breathless. He kneaded and pulled at both of Dean’s reddened cheeks, groaning as he pressed himself to Dean’s back and nipped at his shoulder. “Fucking beautiful, baby. Can’t wait for the day I can spank you raw then fill that tight little hole with my cock.”
Dean sucked in a breath and shuddered again, looking down between his legs as Cas reached his pelvis, pressing kisses over into his pubic hair. Cas lowered his forehead for a moment and hummed. “
Dean groaned pitifully and was not at all prepared for when Castiel spanked him again, much harder this time, jostling him slightly on his feet. His ass stung, briefly alleviated when Castiel pressed himself against his backside, hooking his hand around his hip and pulling him back, giving Dean just the type of encouragement he needed- the feel of his hard cock straining against his slacks.
“I’m going to have you show me what you learned from your homework,” Castiel said matter-of-factly, moving his hand across Dean’s chest and innocently over a pert nipple. “So I can analyze your technique.”
It was midnight when he finally caught a small break in the cycle. He laid still, cheek pressed into the pillow, as he stared up at his window. The night sky was dark, only a few stars shining. No snow fell, but it must still be freezing. He could smell Benny, though, standing guard at his door.
Dean arched, pressing his ass into Cas’s crotch and thrusting his chest up. The Alpha growled and pumped his hips once, his cock twitching inside Dean’s tight passage.
Nothing of which Castiel had. He was an angel. Gender meant little to him. The fact that it meant so much to humans still baffled him. But this was his body now and no matter how much he loved him, Dean would never take him this way.
Dean scuffed the toe of his shoe against the patio and looked back and forth between the inviting house and his car, ultimately deciding- against his better judgement- to step inside. Castiel moved back to let him through and closed the heavy door behind him, then held a hand casually out toward the smaller living room...the unused one from the night of the party. There was a gas log fireplace that was burning hot, and Dean took a seat in one of the chairs in front of it, tucking his hands between his thighs.
Dean nodded and didn’t protest when Castiel picked him up and carried him into the bathroom. The tub was filled, soothing lavender oil and salt added, and soon Dean was submerged in comfortably warm water. Castiel didn’t join him, but knelt beside the tub and rolled up his sleeves. He dipped his hands in the water, sliding his fingers up and down Dean’s thigh, watching him closely with the same unreadable expression he adopted when he was in deep thought. For once Dean wasn’t trying to decipher it. He simply stared at the water, watching it ripple, the occasional sniffle the only sound he uttered.
Dean shuddered as Castiel’s teeth scraped against his neck. His cock was trapped between their bodies, sensitive to the friction between the two of them, and Castiel’s cock nudged his prostate on nearly every pass. Dean finally came between them with a choked cry when Castiel groaned into his neck as he pumped into him, the warmth seemingly spreading through his whole body.
“Enough, it’s enough,” Dean groaned when Castiel was preparing to add another finger, and he pulled at the man’s arms, shaking and panting. “Please, Cas-”
“I know,” Cas chuckled, pressing a kiss to Dean’s cheek. Which turned into his mouth. Then came the tongues and the hands and suddenly Sam wasn’t hungry anymore.
"Yeah, I got that." Dean frowns and shakes his head incredulously, stepping back into Cas's space, anger bubbling in his chest. "Why?"
Dean bites his lip when he turns away, trying not to look too desperate as he goes back to the kitchen and quickly cleans and sterilizes behind himself. He peeks out the window every couple of minutes, ignoring Sam’s comments, to stare at the beautiful man in the corner, who was sipping his coffee slowly and staring out the window.
“Oh. Yeah.” Dean handed him a plate with one of the burgers and fries he’d made for dinner, then sat down on the other end of the sofa with his own. “Bobby’s during the week, Castiel’s on Saturdays...don’t feel like I have much free time anymore.”
Castiel led him back into the sitting room after lunch, sitting down with his laptop this time and giving Dean a pillow to lay out beside him since his lap was occupied.
The boy nods and immediately goes back to building, and Dean takes Cas's hand as he stands, but he doesn't miss the longing look he gives the kid as they walk away. It's short-lived, though, because he smiles again and lays his head on Dean's shoulder as they walk back up to their spot on the beach.
After a few moments he pulls himself upright again, snagging a cigarette from the half-smashed pack on his nightstand and lighting it. He puts his face in his hands, rubbing at his eyes with his palms before finally stumbling to his feet and toward the kitchen, leaving a trail of smoke in his wake. As much as he hates to admit it, he
Dean choked and squeezed his cock at the base to hold off his orgasm. Castiel splayed his hand across Dean’s chest and leaned over, eyes never leaving Dean’s.
Jack squinted at the dryer, still filled with towels, wondering about the enigma that was Dean Winchester.
“Oh, yes, baby,” Castiel said a little breathlessly, smoothing down his hair. “So good for me. Let me show you just how good.” He wrapped his fingers around Dean’s hand, careful not to touch his cock, and moved it up over his head, pressing it to his crotch and pushing his fingertips down around the obvious outline of his thick cock. “You see, good boy? See what you’re doing to me?”
No truck in the driveway, so their dad must be working nights this week. He sighs. That means extra early mornings for him, getting Sammy up, fed, and off to school before time to be there himself.
“Wasn't talkin’ to you,” John spat, glaring back at him. “And you need to get the fuck out of my house.”
“Shouldn’t you be sittin’ down?” Dean mumbles, digging into his pocket for his pack of cigarettes. Sam absolutely hates that he’s picked up the old habit again, but Dean can’t find himself to care. It’s not like he’s smoking a pack a day.
Dean glances back at Cas, chewing on his cheek as he eyes the dusty, scuffed up shoes that should have been retired a year ago.
Dean and Castiel. Sam was back at the bunker, sick with the cold of all things. Dean’s music was playing at a moderate level and the hunter was drumming his fingers on the wheel. The drive had remained conversation free for the most part. It made Jack twitch, but Castiel seemed…content with it all. He sat comfortably up front, watching the rain and lightning with eyes that spoke volumes. Like the angel knew just what is was like to fly into the heart of the storm.
There was a pristine white clawfoot tub in the middle of the room, with a toilet in the far corner and double sinks in the opposite corner of the same wall, with a decently large rustic cabinet with double doors situated between them. The floors were grayish brown tiles that resembled hardwood, and the walls were adorned with large dark gray tiles from floor to ceiling. The far wall was lined with shelving that held plush linens, and on the wall beside the far door was a hook that held plush white robes, with several pairs of white slippers sitting underneath, reminding Dean of a fancy hotel or spa.
Castiel looked over at him, hair a mess, prominent bags under his eyes. He pressed his lips together when Dean reached up to cup his cheek.
“It's just… important to me,” Cas said slowly, handing the joint back to Dean, “that you make the decision for yourself, and not let your body dictate for you.”
Dean hits the ground hard, skidding a little to a stop, his back aching with the impact. Before he has time to react, he sees a blur of black, and he's being hoisted roughly to his feet by the front of his shirt. Fergus's face comes into view, the Scot gritting his teeth menacingly as he quickly rears a fist back and plunges it forward, connecting hard with Dean's jaw and making a loud popping noise. He immediately throws another punch, connecting with Dean's left eye and sending Dean tumbling back down to the pavement. He barely registers his throbbing eye as he leans to his side and spits a mouthful of blood onto the parking lot.
"Well, yeah. But it's hard to know when the right time is. Like, I know I love Jess. But I don't know if the time is right, and we've talked about it a little..."
Dean breathed deep and nodded slowly with a smile. “Our daughter.” His smile widened and he slid his fingers up and down Cas’s arm, feeling the muscle just beneath the skin. “Not so hard...being a mom. She makes it easy. I mean, I’m sure we’ll have our tough moments, but...I guess I should say it’s not as scary as I thought it would be.”
"There's his address. But Dean...please, for his sake, and my sanity, proceed with caution. And definitely let him know you're coming."
Rory’s cough was a little persistent, but Dean resolved to keep an eye on in when Missouri told him it was probably nothing serious. She didn't appear  to have a fever and her appetite was obviously good, which helped Dean to relax a little.
Yulia’s eyes widened slightly, looking a little taken aback, and nodded slowly. “Well, yes, he’s- that’s very nice of him-”
“No, I do,” Dean nods firmly. “You’ll be there. It’ll be fine. Maybe you can help distract me.” He attempts a wink, though he knows it comes across weak.
Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head. “First of all, that is completely unnecessary. And second...I need to be here as long as Sammy is.”
He doesn’t admit that part of the reason it hasn’t changed is because he kept holding out hope Cas would come back. That if he did he’d feel right at home again if everything was the same.
He didn’t have much else to say to Castiel after he was granted permission to stay, and so Castiel eventually dismissed him, still without scenting him. Dean wondered vaguely how difficult it may have been for him, and additionally chewed over how much self-control he must have. Most Alphas had a difficult time controlling themselves around Omegas in general, especially because most take what they want without caring. But here Dean is, only a day or so away from a full-blown heat, and his Alpha didn’t seem to bat an eye.
“Yeah,” he said in awe, laying his palm over the swell. He huffed a laugh, rubbing his thumb gently across his skin. “Wow…”
Dean blushes and clears his throat, tapping on the wheel. “Uh, n-no. I mean, Lisa and I did...stuff, but never...that.”
Dean rubbed his hands over his face roughly and checked his eyes in the mirror. They were once again dry, if a little bloodshot and glassy. Luckily his dad probably wouldn’t even notice.  He gathered himself, carefully emptying thoughts of Castiel and whatever the hell the man was making him feel, and stepped out of his room. He crossed into the kitchen quickly and began setting the table, taking extra care so as to keep his mind focused. Once set, they all sat to eat, his dad immediately launching into whatever stories he had saved up about work and Sam and whatever the fuck else. Dean wanted to scoff at how obvious John was being, clearly sucking up to get a good review by mentioning every Saturday he’s pulled overtime, but honestly he was thankful it kept Castiel’s attention mostly off him. Only mostly, because Dean’s neck would prickle every once and while, and he knew that meant Castiel’s intense gaze was on him.
They got up early the next morning and immediately dressed to go see Cas. They stopped for breakfast and Missouri slipped them both a little extra eggs and sausage, both of them eating all of their respective helpings.
He suddenly remembered his and Castiel’s conversation the night of his birthday, and what the man had said as he was leaving, about being there to talk when he was ready. Against his better judgement, despite the things Castiel had said tonight, the memory had him throwing open the door and making a beeline for Castiel’s bedroom without giving a thought to how inappropriate it was. He knocked loudly on the door with his good hand, the sound only then breaking him out of his brief trance, and he shook his head and took a step back. He was about to tuck tail and run back to his room when the door opened, Castiel standing on the other side, looking nearly as formal as he had in the kitchen, only his tie mussed, like he’d been in the middle of taking it off. He frowned when Dean didn’t immediately speak, because he was looking past him at the bed, remembering the night he’d first met Castiel, first developed his obsession, then accidentally walked in on him roughly fucking Miss MacLeod, which subsequently led to easily the best orgasm he’d ever had by his own hand...in the man’s bathroom.
It's not an urgent kiss, it's not expectant, and Cas's grip relaxes slightly as Dean licks gently into his mouth, drawing his arms up to cup Cas's face gently. When Dean finally pulls away Cas is watching him with a sort of wonder in his eyes, his full lips slick with spit and slightly parted. He blinks and he looks almost confused, and Dean reaches up and tries to smooth the wrinkles on his forehead, moving slowly, afraid that any minute Cas may remember himself and push him away. He doesn't.
“It’s...just,” Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Look, I love my brother. Spent damn near my whole life taking care of him and...I dunno, that might be part of the problem.”
Cas squats down next to the boy and holds out a hand, eventually lifting the boy’s own hand to shake when it appears the kid doesn’t understand. The little boy grins up at him and thrusts a shovel in his direction, and even from the horizontal angle that Dean is viewing them, he can see Cas is smiling his fucking unicorn smile, nose scrunch and all.
, boy,” Castiel growled, pulling out slightly, only to push roughly back inside. “Been thinking about this all day. Just imagining your perfect, tight little hole had me on edge all throughout my meetings. Could only think about splitting you open right there on the conference room table, hearing your pretty little sounds…” he groaned again, circling his hips, flattening a palm against Dean’s stomach. “I’ve wanted you,
Dean nods, because he knew what Cas was going to say before he said it, and he didn't want him to notice how much it stung despite that.
“Not at all,” Jack beamed, pleased with himself. “But I read that couples like to share their drinks.”
“Just didn't want her to, you know,” he blushed slightly and looked down as he fastened the last button.
Cas looked at himself in the mirror. A mess of dark hair. Crinkles next to his eyes. Perpetual stubble over a sharp jaw. Broad shoulders. A very flat, very male chest. A stomach with hair trailing down to a flaccid cock, framed by hairy legs.
Not that Dean minded, of course. It was perfect, absolutely fucking perfect, and he arched under Castiel, wrapping his arms around his neck as he returned the kiss with vigor.
Dean moved to take it from him, but Castiel held it just out of his reach. Dean pouted and the words left his mouth before he could even think about it.
He sighed and looked Benny up and down before nodding slowly. “Fine,” he huffed and stood, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ll talk to Garth.”
They were standing too close and Dean could smell Castiel’s cologne, his natural scent hiding underneath the spice, drawing him in. Castiel’s neck looked too inviting, the collar of his shirt flared open and begging Dean to bury his nose in it. He wanted to rub his cheek against that stubble, peppered lightly with little gray hairs, feel it scratch on his skin.
whatever he was thinking. Dean had spent his whole life keeping his mouth shut and his mind too drunk to think about anything too serious. Meanwhile, it seemed whatever popped into Cas’s head came right out, not realizing that most people just didn’t do that sort of thing.
“Oh, god,” Dean stopped, scrubbing a hand down his face. “What if Sammy’s in there? What’s he gonna think? Oh, god-”
Dean growled and pressed his forehead against the wall. “Stop feeling sorry for yourself,” he huffed. “You are what you are.”
Dean groaned as he added another finger, sliding them swiftly in and out, nipping at his shoulder. “Please, more, daddy-”
“Montana, huh?” Dean frowns as he cycles through some of his photos, then forces a smile. They're all gorgeous, of course, but he can't push away the thought of Cas being out there by himself, likely without anywhere to stay.
Oh God, that voice. Like a growl, deep and guttural. Like he’d just fucked and groaned for hours, and Dean could just imagine all the dirty things that voice could say.
was definitely suggestive. Dean shuddered and Cas chuckled, snaking his arms around his waist and squeezing.
The hunter blinked, hands pausing. His gun, half assembled, was forgotten for a moment. “You…what?” Dean said slowly, because surely heard that wrong.
Cas looks over at Dean and smiles, and Dean smiles back, then looks back at the boy and gestures to their creation.
Cas nodded quickly, eyes slightly wide. Dean’s tone left no room for argument and Cas sensed that any kind of objections would not be taken well. Dean retrieved a thick blanket and some pillows, handing them over to Cas who bit his lip, nodding his thanks.
Dean nodded and shifted slightly as he pushed in a second finger, his nostrils flaring and mouth falling open with the stretch. Castiel’s eyes flitted back down and something resembling a smile quirked at the corner of his mouth before his hand fell back to Dean’s chest, stroking every so often over a nipple. Dean wanted to hear Castiel say more, the deep gravel of his voice always sending chills through his body and straight down to his cock, and he especially wanted to hear more about how
It haunted him, the memory. Dean relived it over and over. He wanted to turn away, run, but Cas’s eyes held him. Dean was falling in them and he couldn’t stop himself.
“Still your sweet boy,” Dean said, blushing when Castiel’s hands moved to his neck. The man nodded absently as he cupped Dean’s jaw and pulled him closer.
“You earn that first, baby,” he raised a brow, a ghost of a smile on his face. “Show me how much you want my cock.”
Dean’s eyes widened and he only hesitated for a second before he darted upstairs, his heart already speeding up. He hadn’t expected a scene tonight, but he wasn’t going to complain. He didn’t even worry about what he would say to John when the man inevitably complained about having no dinner on the table.
Dean sighed and shifted, thinking he probably should have at least sat on a stump instead of the ground. The snow was freezing his ass off. He bent a leg, ready to push off the ground, then froze when he suddenly saw two pairs of eyes staring right at him. They were intensely blue and he was briefly reminded of his Alpha, right down to the scent coming off the wolf. An Alpha as well, then.
Castiel chuckled and she smiled as she raised her cup to her lips. Dean shifted on his feet, looking around the room, and Castiel cleared his throat and rested his hand on Dean’s lower back again, ushering him forward slightly.
Castiel rolled his eyes and set the washcloth aside. “I think you may be jealous of Miss MacLeod,” he said softly, stretching out beside Dean and spreading his hand over the boy’s chest.
“Hm?” Castiel licked his lips, running his fingers through Dean’s hair. It was sticking up at odd angles from Cas’ constant need to touch it.
Dean gritted his teeth, then sighed softly. He pulled back and looked up at Castiel, gently touching his jaw.. “Let me see.”
They were in the library, researching a case. Jack was good at this and so he was eager to impress. When Dean called a short break, Jack opted to bring everyone a fresh drink. He brought Sam a tea, and placed a single beer between Dean and Cas.
Dean blushed and mumbled under his breath, which of course Missouri somehow heard and how he got a slap on the back of his head. Rory giggled and Dean quickly ushered her back outside before Missouri could find something else to hit him with.
Dean let out a breath, thumbing over the screen like he could wipe the words away, like they were only a figment of his imagination.
“Dean,” Cas said, voice laced with concern. “I want you to be honest with me, right now. Have I hurt you in any way? Is this… too much? I can be gentler, I just...I need to know what you need.” His hand was gentle while tracing Dean's scars, sliding up his torso, massaging his sore breasts, and he scented and licked soothingly at his neck.
John cleared his throat and resumed cutting the cake into painfully equal little squares, and Dean kind of felt like a ten-year-old again. For anyone else, this would be embarrassing, but for Dean it was a welcome feeling. And his friends preferred the simpler things, anyway. They weren’t the type to get rowdyy and drink- except maybe Ash. And he was too high half the time to really care what was going on.
Castiel sat up against the headboard of the bed and brought Dean with him, settling the boy between his legs and letting him lay back against his chest. He pulled a small bottle of lotion from the bedside table, squirting some into his palm and warming it between his hands before taking one of Dean’s wrists and gently massaging there and down his arm. He did the same with the other arm, taking extra care of the redness around his wrist from the handcuffs. Dean sat quietly, watching his large hands slide slowly over his skin.
“You aren’t boring me,” Dean said sincerely, smiling at Castiel shyly. “It may not be my...area, but it’s still interesting. Plus,” he shrugged and leaned his shoulder against Castiel’s, nudging him gently. “It’s cool, listening to you talk about this stuff. You get excited. It’s always cute when people talk about something they’re passionate about.”
Dean takes a very deep breath, almost to the point of pain, before he lets it out slowly. He squeezes Cas’s hand and nods, blinking rapidly when he feels the sudden urge to cry. Fuck, he’s pathetic.
“But yeah, it’s a little strange. I, um. I haven’t felt this...sort of…” he paused, swallowing hard, “...in a long time. And I didn’t intend it, and it’s...oh, it’s such a mess.” He scrubbed his hands over his face, looking back up at the beach, the sun hitting his face and highlighting his sharp profile, water dripping from his nose and chin. A slow smile spread across his face and he looked up at the sky, breaking into a soft chuckle, brilliant blue eyes finally settling back on Dean. “All the best things are, though. So yes. Maybe it’s...weird, you and I. But I’m okay with a little weird, as long as you are.”’
“No, I just...don’t usually have the money to go out,” Cas says quietly, taking a bite of his burger and waving at Dean’s concerned look. “Don’t give the puppy dog eyes, dammit. Emancipated teen doesn’t exactly pay well, but I’m fine.”
“Did I say you could stop?” Cas asked menacingly, pulling Dean to him by his thighs as he settled between them. “Come on baby, show off for me.”
The leftovers are lasagna that are sure to be from Charlie's mom, because the extent of Charlie's cooking doesn't go much further than a simple PB&J. Not that Cas is complaining; he loves a good PB&J. But when he and Charlie spend time together, he's usually the one doing the cooking. He's not half bad at it, either, when he has the patience for it and more importantly, the money for quality ingredients.
Dean looked up and kissed Castiel on the cheek, wishing it was his lips instead. Castiel merely leaned into it.
Dean is silent for a moment. “I dunno what we are right now. Just glad he’s somewhere safe for however long it is.”
“He took care-a me.” Castiel slurred, pinching the bridge of his nose and sniffing once. “He took me everywhere an’ made me food an’ played games with me an’...everything. He tol’ me...tol’ me I could do whatever I wanted to do, be whatever I wanted to be. An’ he...um. He
Dean broke their kiss to breathe and attached himself to Cas’s neck. At first he just breathed in the scent, then he kissed and nibbled, until finally he opened up so his tongue could taste.
“I thought about you all the time,” Dean murmurs after a long moment of silence. “Wanted to jump in the car and go look for you, but I didn’t even know where to start. I just...it drove me nuts, Cas, not knowing why you left or if you were okay. I got
“No, no, it’s just…” Sam shrugs as he turns, handing Kevin his plate. “You were pretty pissed. I guess I just didn’t expect you to take him home.”
John glanced over at him and frowned, waving a hand dismissively. “Aw, it won’t nothin’ back then, Dean. It won’t bullyin’ then, it was just part of bein’ a guy. Some people were just easier targets than others. Although…” John frowned, scratching his cheek. “There were a couple times they got ‘im real good...at least once where he ended up with stitches, on his, uh...lip somewhere. I dunno.” He shrugged. “But look at him now. Goes to show how little high school actually defines you. Remember that.”
“I...he...he asked where you were, and I s-said, I blanked and told him you were at the house, and he asked about the trip and I...I panicked, didn’t know what to say, so I-”
“Do you need a spanking, boy?” Castiel growled into his ear, massaging the cheek with his other hand.
Dean nods before she bustles up the stairs. He walks through the foyer and turns into the family room, finding Mr. Braeden on his laptop in the recliner, his glasses perched on the tip of his nose and eyebrows knit together.
Dean looked over at Benny and took in the sight of the Beta for the first time. Of course he knew everyone at this camp had a story, came here to escape from a past they’d rather never think about again. And Dean, whether out of selfishness or the inability to drag himself out of his own head, hadn’t stopped to even wonder about what Benny might have been through. What drove the Beta to find this place.
do. There is a completely ridiculous and unbelievably revealing...outfit...that I couldn’t stop imagining you in laid out in the den. I get home at four. I’d like you to be wearing it.”
Cas grins and picks up the laptop, typing something into the search bar and turning Dean to show him pictures of Glacier National Park, tapping on the screen.
Dean shook his head, not wanting to be a bother. Besides, he was already getting extra food. He didn’t want to take theirs.
“I think…” Cas said slowly, “out of respect for the lore and its potential for correctness, we may want to hold off awhile on that.” He opened his eyes and looked down at Dean, nostrils flaring again, and swallowed hard. “Your heat will be here soon, my Omega.”
“Look, hun,” she started patiently. “You’ve already told your dad and brother that you’re going to be gone for a week. We’re here, we’re checked in, he’s on his way. There’s really no backing out of this now.”
been a couple of months now since he got here. It seemed too short and too long, and he couldn’t recall that much time passing.
“You really are big,” Dean murmured, looking over the wolf admirably. “I don’t know how a big thing like you keeps yourself fed around here. We must be takin’ all your food.”
“You plan on being quite insatiable, then?” Cas chuckled as he kissed his way down Dean’s thigh, slowly lowering himself to his stomach with a small wince. “Believe me, Dean...when you’re ready, I’m going to claim you all over this compound.”
The wolf walked slowly back over to him and just stood next to where Dean sat, staring off into the darkness of the woods. He blinked slowly into the night sky, scenting the air every few moments but seeming decently relaxed. Everything must be quiet tonight; nothing for an Alpha to do. Which was probably why he was spending his time listening to Dean talk in the first place.
Cas lit up and inhaled deeply, hanging his arm with the joint off the side of the couch. He closed his eyes and let his head fall back as he exhaled to the ceiling. Dean sat back down on the couch, sipping at his tea and half listening as Rory continued to detail the last few days to Cas, who simply nodded occasionally as he puffed slowly on his joint.
“Yes, Dean, please…” Cas whispered, the pain in his knees forgotten and his arm long since gone numb.
He looked down at the forgotten legal pad and picked up his pen. His resolution seemed very simple now.
“You could, you know, come with us,” Sam said carefully, looking at Dean like he was about to break any moment. “On the hunt. Might be good for you.”
“My arm went in just fine,” Castiel snapped, trying in vain to tug it free. “The cat’s toy rolled between the gap and I thought I could get it without unscrewing the front panel off.”
“Mike and Gabe...they were able to get out. But they couldn’t take me with them. I can’t blame them for that- they were still kids themselves. But that just left me and mom with Alistair. Occasionally I had Audrina, too, but that wasn’t ‘til a little later.”
Dean groaned pathetically and crawled back over to the bed, curling into a ball as his heat pounded back into him. It was going to be a night of little sleep and excruciating pain.
scared. Like when he decided to leave and find this camp off nothing but rumors. He’d been terrified. The odds favoring his death long before he ever reached the place. It had been his choice, though. “Want this.”
"Dean, come in," she smiles brightly at him and steps aside, gesturing into the house. "Don't you look nice."
“Alright,” Castiel scanned the room briefly. “I want to try something with you then. You remember when I said I had a theory about you?”
"I take it we're not here for the relaxed seating." Charlie teases, rapping her knuckles against the metal of the bleachers.
see it and just didn’t want it. It was painfully obvious to everyone else. Dean wore his heart on his damn sleeve. There was no way Castiel didn’t know his feelings.
“You’ll find all the technical information here, and everything we discussed,” Castiel explained, pointing to the top sheet with the pen. “Please read over everything. Go slow, take your time. If there are any inconsistencies or inaccuracies, bring them to my attention so they can be remedied. Initial each page, and sign the last one. These,” he grabbed the other stack of papers, “are your copies of both of our lab work, our rules, kinks, etcetera. They’re for you to keep.”
After a moment he looks back up and swallows, licking his lips quickly. "I'm sorry, did you want some?" He motions to the small dish of lasagna with his fork, raising a questioning eyebrow.
He practically whined with Castiel stopped suddenly, letting out a shuddered breath against Dean’s neck before pulling away completely. He propped himself up over Dean, mouth hanging open slightly, blue eyes black with lust.
Castiel bumped their foreheads together. “Good. Cause it’s killing me.” He grinned before pressing their lips together, then walked Dean backward to the bed and laid him out, kissing down his body. He pushed his shirt up to kiss down his torso, slow and wet on his skin, finally mouthing along his cock through his pants as Dean’s fingers tangled in his damp hair. He didn’t pull away until Dean was breathless, smirking as he shrugged on his shirt.
Dean nodded and shrugged. “He won’t be a problem. He usually sleeps pretty well after feeding. Just a matter of getting that Alpha off me long enough to feed him.”
He was happy to put that cabin behind him as they continued on. She pointed out the acres and acres of farmland, most of it barren for winter.
He feels stupidly giddy and has to remind himself at least ten times that this isn’t a date. It isn’t
“Your face is perfectly symmetrical, did you know that?” Cas turns to him, raising an accusatory brow.
“Dunno how it’s all gonna end up being okay,” Dean muttered, frowning. “Can’t imagine he’s happy about me...not being straight. And he hit you.”
Dean nodded and took another bite of pie as he walked over to the far end of the counter where they typically stacked the mail, shuffling through it with one hand and holding his plate with the other. The letter addressed to him was indeed fancy-looking, with elaborate script on the front and sealed with wax on the back.
“Yeah, baby, I promise,” Dean said, looking back down at her. “I’m sorry we scared you. Go back to bed, okay? It’s late.”
“Sit, Cas. Jesus, you’re makin’ me nervous, just standin’ around like that.” Dean snorted and shook his head. “What, havin’ trouble stayin’ away?”
First of all, he was naked. Weird, but he didn’t feel too alarmed by it. Maybe he should, but the knowledge rolled off without much thought. Second, he realized he was laying on…a cloud? No…it was moving, rolling, caressing his skin almost shyly. He blinked at it and focused. It was shades of blue, constantly changing from light to dark to everything in between. It was…very soft, softer than anything he’d ever felt.
“You’re gorgeous,” Dean muttered, resting his chin on an elbow. “Your eyes remind me of my Alpha. So blue.” He scratched at his cheek. “Missouri says I should talk to someone. Anyone. I don’t think she meant some random wolf, but I think this counts. Might be cheating. You can’t understand what I’m saying, but that’s what makes it easy.”
Dean laughs. “Alright, fine. But I’m gonna prove you wrong about that.” He turns to head back into the kitchen, tearing the order off the top of the pad and dropping it and the pen back on the bar. He points over at Cas with the ticketed hand. “Don’t go anywhere, gorgeous. I’m not through with you.”
Castiel looked up from his pillow in the middle of the room, legs crossed and hands resting on his thighs. His hair was messy and he had dark circles under his eyes, but he attempted a small smile before seeing the expression on Benny’s face.
Dean grinned and let Castiel’s leg go. He watched him stand and disappear briefly into a small bathroom, coming out seconds later with a damp washcloth. Castiel sat and patted his thigh, Dean settling back on it and stretching out.
“Burgers and fries, Dean, really?” Cas screwed up his face as the roughly pulled off his trench coat.
Cain smiled, squatting down to Castiel's level to show him the box that still housed a newly ordered queen. The bees that accompanied her in the box were working frantically at the candy from the inside, including a few stragglers from the hive working on the outside. Cas watched, fascinated, as he realized how easily it seemed the hive had accepted their new queen.
“Newlyweds?” the woman asks with a smile, and Cas's blush deepens as he shakes his head quickly. Dean's chest tightens and he's not sure how to feel about Cas's abrupt answer, so he just watches as Cas lifts his hands to sign.
Castiel tore his gaze away to settle on the desk pressed up against the wall. He pointedly ignored the picture of Dean’s mother, opening his mouth to apologize and beg forgiveness.
“No,” Dean said definitively, stretching slightly to kiss the tip of Cas’s nose. “No, Cas, it’s just...
Castiel looked like he was about to say something, but all that came out was a cross between a hum and a sigh. He searched Dean’s face, swallowing hard.
Dean frowned. “Well, all I know is I find guys hot. I find girls hot. I find you...very hot.” He looked up at Castiel, who smirked behind his paperwork. “Everyone’s hot.”
“Fine,” Dean snaps at both of them, causing Cas to jump again. He stomps off into the kitchen and the sound of pots and pans banging has Sam rolling his eyes.
“Kim’s awesome,” Dean says. “Been comin’ here since I was a kid. She used to sneak me extra pieces of pie.” He folds his hands over the table and tilts his head at Cas. “Maybe she’s why I like you so much. Already used to the attitude.”
“Now,” she said finally, her voice a little hoarse, “if you’re keen on carryin’ yourself a litter, there are things I can do to help you prepare...physically. Obviously, there’s no manual for that kind of thing, and I dunno that any of it’ll actually make a lick of difference, but it can’t hurt.”
He hadn’t been back out in the forest since that night, but he did wake up each morning to find fresh paw prints in the snow around his cabin. They came from behind the cabin and disappeared the same way, and he never saw them around anyone else’s. Perhaps his friend was wondering if he was okay. Dean kind of liked that idea.
Dean watched him go, tugging at the edge of his jacket and trying to push away the odd feeling of envy he suddenly had. Benny seemed so comfortable around everybody, especially Alpha. Dean wanted to know what that felt like, to be
Castiel shook his head, staring unseeingly at the television. “Yeah, no. It wasn’t his fault. I guess it wasn’t mine, but it wasn’t his, either. But I guess it was just...easier to blame myself.”
The building that held Castiel’s previous job was impressive, especially compared to Hoppmann. It was a skyscraper and Dean felt a little nervous about how many floors they’d be up, but he refused to let his irrational fear of heights get the better of him. Coffee and egg sandwich in hand, he followed Castiel into the revolving doors and tried not to stare in awe at the sheer size of the place.
Dean just smiled and kissed the unharmed side of his face. Castiel sighed and grabbed the back of his head, pulling him forward and pressing their cheeks together.
“If she's Alpha, she may not want to stay,” Cas finished for him, looking at him with sad eyes. “And even if she does, considering I've never allowed other Alphas to stay here… I'm not sure how the pack would take it.” He scratched idly at his cheek. “Anyway. Perhaps that was a little… risky of us.” He huffed a laugh. “Worth it, though.”
After an exhausting half hour of pictures, a lot of fussing over Lisa's hair and makeup, and a few tears, Mrs. Braeden had finally let them get on their way. Dean hardly spoke the whole way there, only smiling and laughing when appropriate at Lisa's excitement over the evening and her gossip over some of the other senior girls and the racy dresses they would supposedly be wearing. Dean couldn't find it within himself to care about dances or revealing dresses, feeling almost guilty about his general disinterest in Lisa herself despite all of her incredible qualities. It's not that Dean isn't attracted to her because really, there's no way to
Dean rolled his eyes and quirked a smile. Leave it to Cas to be worried about his weed instead of the hole in his side. “She can’t have all that smoke in here,” Dean said, poking Cas’s cheek. “And make all her patients and staff
Cas came down from his third orgasm panting, the blacks of his eyes shrinking as he looked down at Dean. He took a deep breath and winced as he pulled back, tapping the outside of Dean’s thigh gently, helping him move his leg around Cas’s body and lie on his side without pulling at the knot that tied them together.
“Hand-feeding,” Dean repeated, tilting his head. “How is that different from what you’re doing now?”
It doesn’t help that the huge ass windows show the flying death machine in all its glory. Dean swallows, watching anxiously as the team outside fuels and checks...whatever it is that they’re checking. Dean hopes they check everything twice. Three times. Hell, make it 10 times.
“Oh hush,” she waved him off. “I like cooking. Besides, it’s the only way I know all my pregnant Omegas are eating enough.” Missouri gave him a look and Dean rolled his eyes.
Dean swallowed, his heart beating a little faster. “Y-Yeah, okay. I’m sure we can make it work. Uh, does this involve a plane?”
"Good." Cas leans up a little more and runs his tongue along Dean's upper lip, then pulls back and offers Dean his pointer and middle fingers. "Suck 'em for me, baby."
Castiel gave him a concerned look and reached down to grab Dean’s bag, sitting it on the bed in front of him.
Cas doesn't answer. In fact, he's so stone-cold out of it that Dean takes it upon himself to pull him out of the stall, propping him up against the painted cinder block wall. He kneels in front of Cas and takes his face in his hands, trying to get his eyes to focus on him, but Cas is zoned out and he's shaking so hard that Dean's afraid he might be having a seizure. He's covered in a cold sweat and he's panting, holding his arms to his chest.
Dean flinches and ducks his head, muttering under his breath while Sam grins like an idiot, handing the plate over to dark-skinned, heavier set woman sitting at the bar.
“Aurora was the Roman goddess of sunrise, whose tears turned into the morning dew,” Aurora came bouncing up behind him, already off on another tangent. “This is a true story,” she tacked on, pointing a little finger at him. “Papa says that my name also means ‘dawn’, so he gave me that name because dawn symbolizes the beginning of a new day. He says I was a ‘new beginning’.”
When he still gets only a blink in response Dean finally huffs and pushes the laptop closed. Cas opens his mouth in protest, hands out by his sides.
“Gonna breed you up again, sweet Omega,” came Cas's voice from seemingly far away. Dean moaned loudly, trying desperately to bring himself back to the moment, trying to hold onto consciousness as long as he could. A biting pain across his backside made him cry out, then Cas was kneading the overheated skin with the tips of his fingers.
They tugged at Cas’s shirt, the material loose and easily pulled aside so Dean could bury his face in Alpha’s neck, his shoulder, his tanned skin. He was careful to avoid the faded mating mark on the shoulder, finding a spot at the base of the neck and inhaling deeply. Everything in Dean screamed
The gate opened just enough for him to slip through. He swallowed thickly and cast a nervous glance around noting heads that were popping up out of small cabins, which he hadn’t noticed before. The structures were solid and lined neatly in a grid like pattern. Empty clothes lines sat beside each one, and a few burned with dim lighting. They looked warm and dry, but Dean stood in the wet cold as the Beta locked the gate back up. Another pop signaled the current was live again.
"She misses you, Castiel." Audrina sighs, squeezing his hand reassuringly. "She's doing much better, you know. She looks good. Ever since she got away from Alistair."
He settled back against Cas’s chest and closed his eyes. “If you’re gonna chase me down and knot me with that big Alpha wolf cock.” He smirked when he heard Cas’s sharp intake of breath, purring softly as his hands dipped below his stomach, one sliding slowly to the inside of his thigh.
Castiel shrugged, looking down at as he slowly swiped the rag over Dean’s stomach, folded it over, and cleaned the residual mess.
Castiel stared up at the old and somewhat yellowed ceiling of Dean’s bedroom. It was crumbling in the corners and a few mysterious stains spotted the area just above the door. Castiel thought it was one the most beautiful things in the world.
He helps the boy rebuild the small sandcastle, even going so far as to dig a moat around it and attempt to fill it with water, although it all just immediately seeps into the sand. The boy looks happy though, and the parents are smiling and talking amongst themselves, watching the two of them interact.
around you, but that was on me, because I was a dumb horny kid trying to figure out why I was popping boners for a
Dean’s mouth dropped open then snapped shut when he realized it. He shook his head and glanced around the room, as if the answer to his confusion would come busting out of the walls. “Cas...that’s, I mean, are you sure? You just got it all back. You’re a powerhouse again.”
Anael nodded with a small frown, looking down at her drink. “He’s...always been like that. Even as a kid, he was always...you know, quiet.”
Charlie quirks a smile, crossing her long pale legs, the bulky Doc Martens looking too big for her tiny frame. It's October, too cold for her to be sporting a short skirt and ripped fishnets. Cas can see the goosebumps on her skin from where he sits.
“Cas, I…” Dean sighed and his head fell back with a soft thunk against the headboard. “I wasn’t really saying it was his fault. I just meant...stuff happens. It wasn’t really anyone’s fault. You know, my dad, he...he kinda went through the same thing with my mom. Blamed himself for her death. I don’t think he does anymore, but it was messy for a long time. Drank himself into a stupor most nights.” He waved his hand and rubbed at his eyes. “I’m gettin’ off track here. Point is, I know it’s natural to blame yourself, or to just...want to have someone to blame, in general. But I really don’t want to see you destroy yourself over it.”
Castiel quickly pulled the comforter over him, tucking it around him securely. He propped himself up on his elbow and laid a hand against Dean's cheek, stroking softly as he looked down at him, worry evident in his blue eyes. Dean had a hard time focusing on him, his eyes still darting around the room, chest heaving.
, and not what I can do for him. And I...I just really love being a mom.” He smiled down at his pup, who was clutching tightly to Missouri’s shirt even as his eyes drooped heavily. “I have a lot to offer. More than being a mate, or being a mom. But I enjoy those things about myself the most.”
"I could never hate you," Lisa sighs, folding her hands back in her lap. "Am I hurt? Yes. Am I pissed? Hell yes. But I'm not an unreasonable person. I don't know the nature of your relationship with Castiel...nor do I understand, because..." it's her turn to shake her head disbelievingly, "you and him? I've never met two people more different."
When Cas finally does begin to eat, it’s mere minutes before the bowl is clean, and Dean doesn’t even want to consider how long it’s been since Cas had a decent meal. He vaguely wonders how he got back to Sioux Falls as well, but he doesn’t want to push Cas to tell him anything.
Cas takes the camera and tries to hold back a smile, failing miserably. He looks at the picture for a long time, then back up at Dean, giving him a nod.
Cas twitched as he came down from his high, sucking in a breath and carding his fingers through Dean's hair. He moaned softly and pushed his hips up slightly to give Dean better access.
Cas looks at him hopefully and nods, cupping his cheek and trailing his fingers down Dean’s stubble. Dean frowns and licks his lips, then reaches up and cards fingers through Cas’s hair, watching him as he considers what to sing, but weirdly, only one song seems to come to his mind. He goes with it, thinking it just...somehow fits.
Dean clung to his back, careful of his claws that didn’t seem to get the memo that Cas wasn’t a threat. Each thrust was long, slow, Alpha’s cock dragging and sliding. Dean couldn’t form words anymore and simply panted into Cas’s neck, his leg squeezing around Cas’s waist. Each nudge at his rim from the swelling knot was like a spark, his breath hitching, his slick pumping out in copious amounts. The sound alone was enough to make Dean’s ears burn and his face flush, which he hid as he scented along Cas’s neck, dragging in his smell in gulps.
Charlie sighed and put her hands on her hips. “That’s Aurora. Sorry she was sneaking around in your backyard. It feels like a full time job sometimes, watching her.”
Dean ghosts the tips of his fingers up and down Cas’s arm as they lay in silence for the next hour or so, watching reruns of some cop procedural. Dean doesn’t realize that Cas has fallen asleep again until he tries to move with no response from him, so he carefully undresses and maneuvers them both under the sheets- which is much easier said than done- cuts off the TV, and pulls Cas back into an embrace. He knows Cas will end up getting hot in the middle of the night and practically push Dean off of him, but Dean will take whatever precious time he can get before that happens.
“Then that’s his problem,” Castiel shrugged. “I’m not naive enough to think he’ll accept this so easily. It’s going to get...rough, I’m sure. All we can do is...explain as best we can. And hopefully, one day, he’ll come around.”
Benny rounded the corner with Cas trailing closely behind, his hands in his pockets. Benny got down on one knee and held his arms out, and Rory practically thrusted her tray into Dean’s hands before flinging herself into his arms. Benny laughed and picked her up, pulling back to look at her.
“No,” Castiel said firmly, taking his time as he thrust his finger in and out. “You know we don’t rush this, boy. Behave.”
“I think Rory wants to spend some time with Missouri tonight,” Dean said, effectively changing the subject. It was stupid to argue about something positive, anyway. Dean looked up at Cas, who raised a brow, not fully catching on yet.
Dean could only manage a nod, his finger moving rapidly, his cock leaking profusely. Castiel licked his lips and caressed Dean’s chest, sliding his fingers over a nipple, smiling when Dean groaned loudly.
Bobby is John's friend and another father figure to Sam and Dean. He often spent time at the Winchester house with the boys when John was out of town during the week. During the weekends, the boys sometimes opted to stay with Bobby and his wife Ellen at their house down by the beach, where the couple had their spare bedroom lovingly arranged just for the boys with two double beds, a tube T.V. and an old Nintendo 64. Bobby and Ellen acted as their parents just as often as John did...not that either Dean nor Sam minded spending their time two blocks from the beach. Bobby and Ellen were both no-nonsense types, but they were good to Sam and Dean and the boys thought of them as family.
“Mmm.” Dean straightens and turns, turning over a Green Day CD in his hands. “Nope. I just figured you’d pick something.”
Dean sighed and sat up, swinging his feet over his bed. He couldn’t lay there anymore. He pulled on some layers and his jacket, then stepped outside. He rubbed at his arms and glanced around as the mostly deserted camp. Everyone was tucked away and sleeping, cabins were dark and quiet, and only a few Betas were guarding the gate.
“My god, you’re gorgeous,” Cas whispered, so quiet it almost sounded like he was talking to himself.
Jesus, he had to stop these thoughts. No good ever came from letting his mind wander when it came to Castiel. It lead to things that he really didn’t want to explain to his dad of all people.
Dean scratched his fingernails over his jeans. “With Charlie and Benny. One last shebang before school.”
it. I told you, I love your wild side. Don’t get me wrong, I love it when you’re gentle with me. But I like being a little sore afterwards, too.”
Hey everyone! We have officially finished writing this story so the remaining chapters will be going up in decently quick succession. We can't wait to hear what you think of the finished story, and please recommend to your friends!
Dean snorted a laugh, smiling widely now, and the unfamiliar motion hurt his cheeks. “Getting a little friendly there, buddy,” he said, massaging just behind the wolf’s ear. “I usually make a man work for it first.” He chuckled, surprised at himself more than anything else. He could never let anyone get this close, let alone an Alpha. It was bad enough letting Missouri up in his business. But he felt comfortable with the wolf and, maybe, in a way they were the same. Both alone and just needing some simple companionship.
He blinked and Castiel was across the room, sipping at his drink and looking way too damn casual for what had just transpired. Dean coughed and rubbed at his damp eyes.
“No, I know that,” Dean shook his head and looped his arms around Castiel’s neck, bumping their foreheads together. “I have a feeling you’d actually be really fucking annoying about homework. Probably wouldn’t let me get off until it was done.”
To his immediate right is Fergus, an exchange student native to Scotland. He's short and stocky, his blunt nails painted black and scratching absentmindedly at his impressively full beard. He's the only man Dean has ever met that can wear a skirt...kilt...whatever...and look incredibly intimidating while doing so. Beside him are Balthazar and Meg, practically attached at the waist, as they barely paused their borderline pornographic makeout session upon Dean's intrusion. Balthazar's bleach blonde hair is almost painful to look at in the light of day, the equally light-colored facial hair accentuating his gaunt, pale face. Dean wonders briefly what he'd look like under a black light, an image of body parts floating in midair flashing through his brain.
No one was happier than Dean when Missouri finally let them know it was okay for Cas to go home, and Rory was so excited she barely slept the night before. The pup bounced all through breakfast, barely eating anything, until Dean finally sat her down and explained that even though Cas was coming home, he was still healing and shouldn’t be jostled too much. In other words, no climbing on papa.
“And are you ever,” Castiel said smugly, tracing Dean’s bottom lip with a finger and hooking it just inside, pulling slightly. Dean touched his tongue to the tip of his finger before Castiel pulled away, dropping his hands to Dean’s waist. He fixed his gaze on Dean and pulled the boy’s shirt up and over his head, dropping it to the counter and laying his hands flat on his chest, sliding them down slowly.
Castiel’s voice broke through his haze again, and Dean blinked dazedly up at him- he hadn’t even realized Castiel was standing again.
“Ever eager,” Castiel said, with the slightest hint of amusement in his voice. “Soon, sweet boy, but not today. Today is about establishing a connection and making you feel comfortable with me. By the end of today, I expect you to fully understand the sincerity and intensity of this relationship and the lengths I would go for you.”
“-I don’t want to overthink this. Us. I- I just want, um. To enjoy where it takes us. And if I don’t think to much about it, if I don’t label it, you’re still my Sub and I’m still your Dom and we have a fantastic contractual relationship in which we’re both very happy...which is to say, if nothing else, is what we’re

“Mmm, you wanna be filled again so soon?” Cas grunted with each thrust, remnants of a growl on the end of each sound. “So ready to be bred again…”
Lisa doesn't say anything for a long moment, but somehow some of the tension in the car subsides, and he can finally breathe again. He sneaks a glance at her, finding her brow furrowed with the thought, chewing on her bottom lip.
Dean swallowed, looking down at their hands, the knife pressed to Cas’s throat. He nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, all right.”
