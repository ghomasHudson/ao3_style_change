“Yeah, I’m getting it.”
to call Emergency Services with if necessary."
He opens it quickly.
Sherlock looks touched by the words and forgiveness, and John steels himself for the blast that’s sure to come any second now.
Watson can’t help the flare of jealousy in his gut at the thought, then tamps it down because the man is dead, dammit!
are gay,” Holmes stresses, then adds lightly, “
. He was clearly interested that first night at Angelo’s and numerous other times in the first year and a half that they lived together. Nothing has been the same since Sherlock’s return, and he has never seen the same looks in John’s eyes as he used to. If anything, his time away opened Sherlock up to admitting how much he cares for John while at the same time John was trying to heal over the loss by pretending he never did.
“Yes,” Holmes agrees with a content smile on his face, “I am.”
. In the court room, Sherlock is answering the questions required of him, but is also trying to lead the barrister in her inquisition. In the end, he mostly just succeeds in talking Moriarty up, annoying the jury, and then getting himself placed in jail for contempt after not being able to stop being a smartarse.
“No,” Sherlock mumbles, looking down shyly, “I’m just not sure how to word my answer.”
Sherlock remains still until the door closes, then whirls in to action. He grabs the few items he’ll need and stealthily follows John.
He follows him to Wandsworth High Street where he is shortly joined by a tall, skinny, dark-haired woman. John has gone on four dates with her, but Sherlock has refused to learn her name.
“I’m also a doctor at a surgery. I miss working with trauma patients, but my work with Sherlock helps with that.”
“The way he looks at you when you’re not looking.”
His tirade is cut off suddenly by Holmes’ lips covering his own, his hands framing his face tenderly. Watson melts in to the kiss, unaware how much he
plus sitting on a sofa, and just
“Should I take a gift?” Sherlock asked a few days later, obviously clicking around the internet in boredom, “For Professor Ellis?”
“Of course,” Watson says, not even sounding offended anymore, “How many people is that now that think Sherlock and John are gay?”
Watson gasps in shock and Holmes mutters, “Oh my God.”
John smiles and continues his journey down, lathering kisses and small sucks across Sherlock’s collarbone, feeling the nudge of the bone which didn’t quite set right when Sherlock broke it and refused to go to hospital for treatment. John makes sure to lick and caress that place excessively before moving down and taking one of Sherlock’s nipples into his mouth.
John smiled genuinely, removing his hands from behind his head to reach for Sherlock’s face instead. He gently guided their mouths back together for a sweet kiss before assuring him, “I know.”
No goodbyes. I doubt anyone will even notice for a while, seeing as I have no place amongst anyone anymore.
Sherlock, for the first time in his memory, stutters. He was so intent on John being happy – that this woman
They discuss Bach’s supposed deathbed dealings before moving on to the real topic of discussion. Moriarty confesses that he intimidated the jury in to allowing him to go free by threatening the people they love. Sherlock asks how Moriarty plans to burn him, as promised, and the criminal taunts that he already told him how, he just wasn’t listening. They discuss the fact that Moriarty has a computer code that will allow him access to everything he ever desires. Their discussion ends with Moriarty promising Sherlock a fall that he owes him.
“Lucky John! It is a bit comforting for me to know that it’s not just me who puts up with the Crazy Holmes genes in any dimension; your mind is a universal John Watson issue,” he jokes lightly to which Holmes merely glares, then continues a few second later, “Do
Putting his cup down before he spilled it, John rubbed at his face and exhaled deeply, “It's...why are you looking at that? First of all, that's not...
“John?” He asks quietly, trying to pull away slightly.
He cuts him off, “You heard what I had said at your grave? You heard me beg and didn’t give enough fucks to come clean about what you were doing?”
) but I could see in your eyes that you were almost pleading for the assurance. Did you want me to fight for you? Tell you that you shouldn’t marry her but stay with me?
“Good,” Sherlock responded as though that had been the plan all along, and then ran a hand up and down John's stomach, “Can we have sexual relations now?”
for crying out loud.
"What exactly happens at these reunion things?” Sherlock asked rather abruptly the following afternoon, apropos of nothing while working at his microscope.
us,” Holmes reminds him.
go back,” he orders seriously.
John chuckled nervously, “Yeah, well, it’s not exactly a sexy situation,” he half apologised.
Sherlock’s heart ached again and he closed his eyes briefly before agreeing, “Because it’s an act for him. He’s only pretending we’re in love while I…” but he couldn’t bring himself to admit it aloud. It sounded so pathetic.
“Well, nice to see that Sherlock’s got the same propensity for public nudity as you do,” Watson laughs.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “By all means, help yourself,” and then returns to his computer.
“Are you saying this happened?” Holmes asks in shock.
Sherlock and John stop for some sightseeing, getting the lay of the land. Sherlock assumes a position high atop a rock while John utilizes the map to tell him what to be looking at. They spot Baskerville, Grimpen Village, Dewer’s Hollow, and Baskerville’s minefield.
“Why is that so funny?” Holmes asks in defensive confusion.
“And what piece is that?” John scoffs.
Next thing they know, Sherlock and John are being woken up by Greg in a holding cell. They gather their belongings and leave the police station to return to 221B. John goes down to visit with Mrs. Hudson (who makes him a full English breakfast that he can’t bring himself to eat due to his hangover) as Sherlock researches Sholto on his laptop upstairs. She goes in to her familiar speech about marriage changing people and situations, saying how wonderful it is but then almost immediately discrediting herself by mentioning how relieved she was when her husband was sentenced to death. John hears Sherlock make noise upstairs and excuses himself from the conversation.
John blinks once with purpose, pulling himself back in to the moment, before striding those few steps that separate them to grab his face in his hands and pull Sherlock down to kiss him. Sherlock at first freezes at the shock of it, but then melts down to meet him with a desperate, broken sigh.
“Goodnight,” Sherlock agrees, placing his phone on the nightstand, turning off the lamp, and settling on his right side facing John.
“It’s okay,” Sherlock soothed, cupping John’s cheeks and pulling him down for a kiss, “just stay with me; stay right here.”
Sherlock looked incredibly confused, as though he had lost track of the conversation, “What?”
Sherlock gasped quietly, tensing as he took in the words. They warmed his chest at the same time they froze his brain. It was countless heartbeats before he was able to process it, but John patiently waited it out, a small smile on the lips still pressed to his shoulder.
With a heavy sigh, he closed the book and laid it atop the piles of items in his packed bag; his formal suits hung in their garment bag on the wardrobe, ready to be whisked away tomorrow morning. They would be heading to his parents’ house tomorrow, with the reunion taking place the following evening. He felt both grateful and fearful for John coming with him; the support is appreciated, but he didn’t want John to bear witness to any bullying that may yet come his way from his former peers. It’s not that he thinks John will believe their tales or take their side, but...it just seems humiliating. He truly cares for John, deeply - could possibly even love him - and he couldn’t stand it if he lost his favor.
“But you don’t know him like I do. He doesn’t do these sorts of feelings. I don’t know if he’s even capable of it.”
John grumbled unhappily as the alarm beeped loudly in his left ear. Slapping his hand over the pesky device, John sat up and rubbed at his face tiredly, giving a dramatic yawn as he pulled the covers back and pottered to the bathroom for his morning routine.
“Of course not,” Sherlock scoffed bitterly, “you were the popular rugby player whom all the girls wanted to shag and all the boys wanted to emulate.”
“It’s fine, Sherlock, really,” John insists honestly, eyes opening again.
Everyone eats and then it’s time for Sherlock’s speech.
“Of course, I always take my coat,” Sherlock answers before looking up in confusion, “are you not taking yours?”
They go on to the balcony, where Magnussen insists on flicking John in the face (as a demonstration on how blackmail works) until Mycroft and backup arrive. Sherlock clarifies that there are no physical records, to which Magnussen agrees, and then Sherlock steals the gun from John’s coat and shoots him in the head.
“I’m trembling with anticipation,” Sherlock groaned sensually, licking at John’s nipple with a devious smirk.
“Me?” John clarified in shock. How the hell would he spoil Sherlock?
Holmes looks away, “What would have been the point of running alone?”
“Which is?” Sherlock asked.
“Right. Well. This has been a spectacular waste of my time. You are useless, Gilbert,” Sherlock sulked, placing the pad and paper off to one side and standing up.
“Sherlock,” he tries again, half imploring, half moaning.
Sherlock has Larry on his stomach now, face digging in to the rough ground as his right knee presses in to his back, his long-fingered hands grasping Larry’s together. Lestrade and his men arrive just two minutes later and take Larry away. The cab ride home is silent.
“Your…right...” John cleared his throat and attempted to focus on speaking, “Take it in your hand and just sort of…stroke it? A bit. Pull your foreskin up and down and…and…do you have a foreskin?”
They fell into silence as John’s hips moved, the only noises in the room being the wet slap of skin against skin and heavy breathing as they drowned in sensation. Sherlock arched his back, moaning, his eyes fluttering closed as he ran his hands up and down John’s back, scratching him slightly in the process as his cock was rubbed by John’s stomach, smearing them both with the plentiful precome which was flowing from him.
When John walks in to Sherlock’s room, changed and ready for bed, he stops dead in his tracks at the sight he sees.
Mycroft informs Sherlock that John hasn’t been staying at 221B while he’s been gone, that he’s moved on with his life. Sherlock cannot comprehend this information, because what life could he have been having without him? He asks Mycroft where he’ll be tonight; the elder Holmes claims for a moment not to know, but Sherlock knows better than to believe it. Mycroft warns him that he might not be welcome, but this is also incomprehensible to Sherlock. How could John not be happy to see him?
The next night, when John again makes a move towards his own bedroom, Sherlock speaks up.
Sherlock removed his hands to glare down at John, hating that he was being made to put voice to the reason, “I know it’s not
“Hmm,” Sherlock hummed, not really paying attention anymore.
“No. God no. I just --
“Did you mean what you said?” He asks, unable to pretend that he cares for any other information at this moment.
“Sherlock,” John moaned, dropping his head to Sherlock’s clavicle, “I don’t know how much longer I can last.
John lets the words wash over him before he steadies himself internally to ask, “Would you like me to show you?”
Sherlock groaned in agreement while his arms finally uncrossed, falling limply to his sides instead.
“Oh, you manipulative tart,” John laughed, standing up and then crouching over Sherlock to run a hand through his curls and press a soft kiss to his lips.
“Unbelievable,” Watson says on another laugh, “I call you a pompous dick and all you take away from the sentence is that you look cool?”
“Right…” John replied, wondering what Sherlock would think about his school’s run-down building and terrible exam results record.
“This is so twisted,” Watson says towards the end of a scene where a familiar Lestrade and Donovan are holding a press conference regarding the killer. Holmes merely hums in agreement.
doesn’t quite equate,” Sherlock stated in confusion.
Once inside the bathroom, Sherlock pulled John close to him for a tender kiss before stepping away and teasingly demanding, “Prove it.”
“Honestly?” He asks calmly, “I haven’t really thought about you since you shot Sherlock, except to contemplate how to get away from you without you turning psychotic, but it appears it’s too late for that.”
The trio makes their way to the flat in question, and Sherlock attempts to drunkenly deduce his surroundings.
show you how to give a blow job,” he offered, tracing his mouth down the side of Sherlock’s neck.
John tried to clear his mind of all the arguments of why this was Not Good and focussed instead on the long, pale fingers which were now wrapping around Sherlock’s cock, stroking it and keeping it hard whilst Sherlock tilted his head, obviously waiting for his next prompt.
“Right,” she says calmly, standing from her chair and placing the remote back on the table, “Well, I’m going to leave this tray of tea and biscuits with you; I hadn’t heard much from you both all morning and I got worried. If one of you would be so kind as to return it downstairs when you’re done?” She says as she finishes fussing around the tray and moves towards the door.
Holmes looks from the screen and towards his friend in confusion, “No.”
St. Fructus - The Patron Saint of Corn Syrup.”
Sherlock hums in lieu of a pompous
Sherlock opens his mouth uncertainly, “I...”
him happy – that he ignored the signs.
Holmes rolls his eyes, “For God’s sake! That isn’t how it happened for me.”
"Not for a few weeks yet."
John sighs, rubbing his left hand over his eye, “You can’t just propose to me so that I can’t date anyone and have no choice but to keep coming on cases with you.”
I sober my face to a simple smile that reaches my eyes, “Yes,” I agree.
to say?”
“You are an utter terror, Sherlock Holmes,” Mrs. Holmes mumbled, “I often wonder if you were found in a hedge. You’re no child of mine,” she teased playfully.
“D'ya want to dance?” John slurred slightly, the red wine making his lips look darker and more seductive.
The intercom clicks off and John sighs heavily as he pushes himself up from his desk, straightening the papers before closing the file he was attempting to work on. John grabs the file for Landingham off the front desk and calls out for her. What he sees when he finally looks up from the file in his hands nearly makes him gasp aloud.
John clears his throat before whispering, “You know there’s more to being married than just laying claim to me coming on cases, don’t you? To declaring that no one else catches my interest over you and a murder?”
“God, I need to piss,” John says abruptly, pushing back his chair to remove himself from the table and moving swiftly towards the back of the pub.
John briefly stood from the bed again to remove his boxers and shirt, then hesitated on where to settle on the bed. The sitting position he had been in wasn’t ideal for a wank, but anywhere else seemed too…
“I didn’t ask you to call me ‘Holmes’, either; it just felt natural to go by our last names, didn’t it?”
Sherlock and Mycroft continue discussing the imminent terrorist bombing, but all Sherlock cares about is getting back in to London and seeing John. Sherlock is handed a file and sees the picture of John with his facial hair for the first time.
“John!” Sherlock called suddenly, almost as a warning, feeling dangerously close to the edge now without even being touched. Sherlock lifted his upper body off of the bed to support himself on his elbows before he looked down at John in alarm. John simply smiled mischievously, keeping their eyes locked as he continued down to the front of Sherlock’s cotton trousers.
“What does one buy a retiring person? A watering can? A set of soup spoons?” Sherlock huffed and folded his arms.
The look in Sherlock’s eyes is uncertain and wary, scared that if they leave right now that John will claim the kiss never happened and that he doesn’t actually want Sherlock.
He whispers, “Are you positive?”
Watson remembers the jealousy he felt upon seeing Holmes with a naked woman, which was completely unfounded since he was already married to Mary at this point in his life.
Watson looks at him with mirth, “We live in a flat owned by a woman who paradoxically claims not to be our housekeeper but spends every interaction acting like she is, we deal with dead bodies on an alarmingly regular basis, we order in most of our meals, and you often wander around the flat in nothing but a bed sheet. Tell me again how classy we are?”
of them?”
The second page:
Sherlock, while pleased beyond words at the outcome, is still a bit shy about all of the attention on them and is instead ignoring all of their stares to simply take in every detail of the side of John’s face.
“God, you’re an annoying dick when you want to be,” Watson observes good-naturedly.
“Oh, fuck!” John moaned, sounding a bit surprised, and arched his back at the pleasure. He had rarely had a girlfriend so interested in that area, and even if they were receptive to granting attention there, it was always incredibly fleeting and awkward.
Watson looks at him contemplatively, “No, I don’t think that’s true.”
Holmes hums and stands to switch out DVDs.
They trudge back into their flat, shivering from the cold.
“Plenty of people have pointed out the dick part, and much worse besides, but no one has ever said I look cool.”
“Wait,” Watson says, holding out a hand to the telly, “hold on. What the
He leans against the cool stone wall and simply breathes, eyes closed tight, as he goes back over what just happened. Sherlock loves him. He can’t fight the smile that appears at the thought, but he also can’t help the bit of doubt since it wasn’t said with his full awareness. He had pulled John close, caressed his face…nearly kissed him. A shudder of desire passes through him again just at the thought.
Holmes’ face fell in to another blank mask as his mouth formed an unhappy straight line and his eyes narrowed just slightly, “Quite,” he said in a clipped manner before turning to me, “Come on, Watson, I believe we are done here.”
. Like a building pressure. Like…like a volcano. The pressure is under the surface and it’s pushing up and up and eventually it has nowhere else to go than to explode.”
“Yes. I don’t know why, but I know I can.”
to happen, you know it is.”
John opened his eyes that he had closed for effect before replying with false sincerity, “Oh, but you’re grievously injured,” he reminded him, fighting hard against a smirk, “best not to risk any further damage.”
Sherlock talks aloud to who he thinks is John but is really Irene. Watson, at this point, had gone home to see Mary. Sherlock explains the Coventry conundrum to Irene (allowing an attack to happen so that the extent of their knowledge wasn’t given away) and then she attempts, yet again, to get Sherlock in to bed.
Sherlock freezes, barely breathing, as he watches John’s right hand reach out towards him. It comes to rest with the front of his fingers pressed against Sherlock’s left forearm, in the unclaimed territory between them. Sherlock searches John’s face, but he’s still clearly asleep and unaware of the motion that his body has made towards his own. It doesn’t mean anything.
Sherlock nodded again and John watched as his brow furrowed, as though he was remembering every single detail and mimicking it perfectly. The pleasure was obviously building for the detective, but not in the same way it had for John...it wasn’t nearly enough; his brain was clearly too involved.
“We don’t have hypothermia,” Sherlock parrots back John’s own argument to him in reply as he moves under the cover to steal John’s body heat in naught but his silk boxers.
“No one, I don’t think; we would have noticed. But that doesn’t explain…” he trails off, not needing or wanting to finish the sentence.
It’s three days and one case later before either of them mentions anything.
I relax and smile in return, “I know precisely what you need,” I say before guiding you up and leading you by the hand to my bedroom.
“Golf,” Sherlock shrugged, “Molecular biology and golf.”
“What is your middle name?”
“Yes,” he admits quietly, unable to look at his friend. He has hidden the scars all these years, but even Watson’s optimism can’t unsee what his doctor’s eyes must have surmised from the scene.
is it:
“What?” Watson asks in shock, turning to face the younger Holmes.
Watson crosses his arms and performs an honest-to-God pout, remembering that he’s already been planning to shave later. And if the look on Holmes’ face is anything to go by, he knows it, too.
“About as Bill showed it. First, one person presents their coin and announces the challenge. Everyone who was challenged must present their coin in a timely fashion or be penalized by buying a round of drinks for all those who did present. There is a ‘one step, one reach’ rule in which you can move to get to your coin; that’s what I had you use to get my spare.”
Chapter 14
“It’s a graze, I’ll live.”
His attempted joke fell flat. A blaring mobile brought life back into the dead space, jarring John out of his racing thoughts about last night and Sherlock.
Mary had the gall to roll her eyes at him. John’s anger began to simmer underneath his skin.
John heard Greg’s shout and the scoff that Sherlock made next to him perfectly clear. His hearing returned with a sudden ‘pop’ during Sherlock’s response.
“Donovan,” replied Lestrade into the radio, turning away from them. Radio static blurred out Donovan’s voice as Lestrade continued. “John and Sherlock are coming.”
“Where are we going?”
“No, I am not.”
“Would you mind holding it for a second?”
“You need more before-”
“What is it, Sherlock?”
“This is not a kidnapping, John, but a social call that required face-to-face interaction pertaining to my dear brother. We will arrive at your destination shortly. There seems to be a large matter of numerous changes in a small amount of time, and I am worried.”
He felt hands enclosed around his throat, and choking pressure followed albeit weak on one side. But, soon, if he didn’t get away, the light-headedness would appear. This certainly wasn’t the first time he was strangled. But Jesus Christ! He didn’t like it!
A pale hand with his mobile hovered in front of his vision. John took it and dialed Lestrade’s number. Five minutes later, Sherlock had finished looking over the new crime scene as other officers arrived. They were shooed away by Lestrade, promising to Sherlock that he would text when they knew something.
“Right,” sighed John. “No, it didn’t bother me. You’ve told me why, and I’ve forgiven you a long time ago.”
John snickered. “Right. So, hair pulling will result in an orgasm or you fall down, duly noted.” As he reaches out his hands in offering to help Sherlock up, he wondered if the hair pulling had resulted in premature ejaculation. His eyes flickered down to Sherlock’s trousers, and then looked away, he avoided Sherlock’s eyes as he shyly asked, “You didn’t… you know… did you?”
“And if we don’t find anything?” asked John. Then there was a familiar twist in his abdomen. John covered it with his hands. The growling of his stomach drowned out Sherlock’s reply. Green-grey eyes narrowed at him.
He would break Sherlock’s heart.
“Do you enjoy killing people?”
“Pause it there, Lestrade.”
“You don’t? You did snog me first.”
His mobile suddenly buzzed in his pocket, vibrating loudly in the silent corridor. John motioned to his trousers. “Do you mind?”
John blinked. He sighed, realising what had happened. “Sorry, just dropped my mobile.” He bent down, picking the inoffensive object from the dirty carpet. “They’re slippery little buggers.”
“Then you should follow my lead.”
Shit.
“Just one doctor.” Sherlock grabbed John’s glutes and pulled him closer. One hand held the doctor in place while the other moved to the front, gently rubbing John’s cock, hard standing against his stomach.
Joseph stood. His arms hugged his chest. “And if they don’t find anything?”
“Either way, I fancy another go with you, just not a go that would lead to the hospital again.”
A pale hand waved at him;- John took it as a sign he was being ignored…again.
“What about Sherlock? The moment that Moriarty has you, Sherlock will-”
He looked up, unaware that his eyes had fallen to the floor. “Yeah?”
It was then that Mary raised her gun at him, aiming over his heart again. “It is what it is, John. Rosemund needs to be safe. I will do anything to accomplish it. One half-done detective for an innocent new life.”
John didn’t let up. He watched as Moran panicked, thrashing as his face turning into a vivid scarlet. “He’ll kill me if I fail!”
It seemed like they wouldn’t get some time after this case, everything would happen back-to-back. Another question was would they snap under the pressure of everything?  There was the temptation to get the scotch out of the kitchen cabinet and pour himself two fingers worth, but the warmth of Sherlock’s body kept him on the sofa.
“Peter,” offered the man, along with his hand. John took it.
‘I love you, see you later - Ollie.’
He mentally counted the number of rings before the mobile clicked over to Sherlock’s voicemail. He tried again. Voicemail again. “Sherlock, you know it’s me, quit being a wanker and answer the call.”
“Don’t give me that look, Greg.”
Live Nudes In Charcoal
“About five minutes after,” concluded Sherlock. His hands fixed underneath his chin and gave the Inspector a surprising look. “A personal record for the Yard.”
“Really? It seemed like something more until he nodded at me for looking at you. It startled me, he’s incredibly handsome, seems untouchable.”
“Mycroft, tell me you have something.” John murmured through his chattering teeth.
“What?”
John shook his head. “Not typically. It’s gotten worse since-”
“You’re the one who stole it.” John bit out, eyes still focused on looking for the spare key.
Instantly, he was smacked with the scent of chlorine and a wave of heat when he stepped inside. His mind supplied another flash of memories, the weight of semtex, the little annoying voice buzzing in his ear, and the look on Sherlock’s face when John had walked out of the dressing room, and the proper meeting of two men that John had gotten in the middle of.
“Excellent deduction.”
The suspect laughed again. The irons around his wrist rattled ever so slightly as he shifted in the wooden seat, clapping his hands.
John grabbed another mug from the cabinet. “In the kitchen, Greg. I was making some coffee. Do you want some?”
A/N: This chapter inspired me to write this whole story out. I don't know why- maybe not enough art and Sherlock fanfiction out there? Anyways, please leave kudos/bookmarks/comments. I always like those! This chapter is beta-ed by englandwouldfalljohn(TheLadyAmalthea) who does awesome work with these chapters and her own stories!
Sherlock’s voice echoed. “Took your time with Peter.”
There was a sniff from next to him; John glanced over at Molly, who also caught Sherlock’s unnerving glare. “Oh stop that! It’s just another postmortem to add to your quiet company. It shouldn’t be any different when you meet my brother and Lestrade tonight. In fact, you might prefer the corpses instead.”
“But what does all of these have to do with smears?”
His eyes met Sherlock’s as the taller man began to grin. John knew that grin; it was the one that he used when he was plotting something. The same one he’d had when he stole an ashtray. When he refused to wear trousers in Buckingham Palace. “What are you going to do to him?”
“Since Sebastian Moran slipped out of Mycroft’s supervision, he’s looking into the rest of it.”
“Sex, we should have it. Now preferably.”
Well, hearing that from Sherlock did sting a bit more than John would have liked it to. He knew it himself, but hearing it aloud from an outside perceptive was completely different. John cleared his throat. “Even so, before anymore repeats of what happened in the flat-”
Moran relaxed, waved him on and asked, “Oh yeah, go on. How’s the older Holmes in the after glow?”
A/N: Please comment/Kudos/and Bookmark!
There was an affronted scoff followed by silence. John rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s attitude. With that silence, Lestrade turned back to Donovan. “What’s his name?”
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock or any other variations.
John pressed forward, he climbing into the cab, and closed the door behind him. Between the doors locked and and the click of his seatbelt made him feel like a prisoner, waiting on death row. Or a delivery en route. John couldn’t quite decide on which metaphor to use. John even wondered if it was the right time to even think about shit like this, but he knew… if Sherlock were here… the detective would have a good metaphor for situations like these…
Sherlock shrugged. “What would be the point? Mrs. Hudson has seen us in more precarious positions before. You were only retrieving my mobile phone from my pocket.”
“John, I cannot snog you properly if you do not reciprocate.”
“Mycroft too then?” asked John, knowing what the answer was because there was only one person who dragged that kind of response from Sherlock.
“Evening. I see from gun in your hand that you are nearing to the last of your ammunition. There’s no need for that, we can have a perfectly reasonable conversation between gentlemen.”
John felt light-headed. His trousers were tight. His palms sweat against his duvet. His fingers fisted in the material. His knees were locked, and if they hadn’t been, John knew he would’ve ended up on the floor.
With the constriction gone, John launched.
His eyes flickered over the CCTV watching the scene. The rest of his words went unsaid. If it weren’t Moriarty, then it would be Mycroft. John would place money on Mycroft in that bet.
The doors dinged open. John stepped inside, Sherlock right next to him. The doors closed, kept them trapped in the metal box. Mechanical whirling followed as the lift moved downwards.
Footsteps retreated from outside the hall. John hurriedly jumped into the shower. Under the warm spray, John relaxed, his eyes drifted shut. As he lathered his shampoo into his hair, his thoughts began to wander again. All back to that kiss.
Sherlock’s grey-green eyes met John’s as the taller man plucked up the violin once more. The chin piece of the violin situated underneath his chin, Sherlock turned away answering over his shoulder. “Everything.”
“Oi!” John complained when the chill in the air bit as his bare skin and all the warmth dissipated. He threw himself forward on the bed and grabbed the corner of the sheet in a fist. He grinned up at Sherlock in mirth with his naked bum in the air.
“His wellbeing means a greater deal more to me than his happiness. My people will handle Moriarty’s threat. Sherlock’s happiness is questionable…pleasing you isn’t the only habit he has, and I don’t wish for him to revisit those habits.”
Knowing that there was no way he could win this bargain without earning an injury that he couldn’t afford, John growled. He jerkily yanked the gun from the small of his back, and popped out the magazine. It was a full one, and the knowledge of that, figuratively wounded him. He also checked the chamber, which was empty. Then John swiveled, and tossed the magazine into the alleyway. There was a light crash when it landed, far away and useless to him.
‘Molly, don’t attempt to lie, you’re awful at it.’
“Sherlock…”
Chapter 1
Now that sounded familiar from that rat Douglas Hageman. John grinned. “I wouldn’t worry about Moriarty when I’m killing you now,” he countered dryly without an ounce of sympathy. “Where’s your gun?”
There was another struck of pain over his brow. John fell to his knees with a wave of dizziness.  Then there was a smack on the back of his head, bringing him to the ground on all fours. He knew the lights he saw were from his head, but this was not the time to worry about it…yet.
“You’re not planning on telling him anything, are you?”
A/N: Ended on a cliffhanger! Please leave comment/kudos and bookmark!
“Lestrade, I’ll leave you to deal with Mycroft. We have to get back to Baker Street right away.”
He grabbed Moran’s legs, and dragged the man across the road to the cab’s open boot. John wrestled with getting Moran inside, being deadweight in all aspects and the man was taller than he was. But John successfully prisoned Moran in the boot, with Moran earning his fair share in head injuries.
“Well, what do you usually tell them?” John asked as he pulled his gun from the small of his back, double-checking the safety mechanism. Just in case.
“Which was useless and hardly warrants your body language when you returned-”
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock or any other variations. Cheers.
John snapped the phone shut and tucked it away. “Yeah. I’m still here. I was checking to see if the vic was the wife.”
John shook his head, and pressed his mouth together in a thin line, wary from Moriarty’s outburst and of the man himself. For all that Moriarty sounded and looked like, there was no way to measure how he would lash out. No way to tell if everything that John saw was real, or if it was faked- everything from his emotional outburst to being in a wheelchair. He was scarred much like John himself. There was no way to tell if Moriarty even had a weapon of some sort, planted nearby.
“I think I am going to turn in for the night,” John replied. He wasn’t unusually tired physically. It was the emotional exhaustion that was weighting him down. The case of loved ones being torn away, the crime scene involving two men that were happy and building a life together, the victim who was taken away too soon, and the baby that wasn’t his, but stirred up his own desire to have his child back, and a million other things that he would rather think about alone. John turned to Sherlock as the taller man pulled off his coat. John honed in on the red tint taking over Sherlock’s forearm and his silver shirt.
“You most likely struggled to remove it, having gained about twenty pounds since the placement of the ring. You have dermatitis around the area, and it’s still healing, so you’ve only removed your wedding ring…two days ago at most, which makes me believe you found out about her affair that same day. You are not scorned; your eyes are red from your drinking problem. There are only three reasons to drink: depression, guilt, or regret, take your pick. Either way, your drinking problem has direct correlation with your erectile dysfunction, which I’m guessing, that’s why your wife started her affair. It makes you feel emasculated, and out of control, you thought that killing her would fix your problems. Unfortunately, you’re mistaken in that aspect because you’ve created more problems for yourself. Am I wrong?”
was.”
“For the
Time passes and John falls asleep. He’s awoken by his cell phone, someone calling to tell him that Mrs. Hudson has been shot. Sherlock refuses to come because he knows it’s a lie, a diversion to get him alone.
There is this one particular day that stands out in my memory. I look back on it now and I…there’s this strange juxtaposition of fondness and aching melancholy.
“I’m so sorry,” John spluttered before laughing, noticing the thick stripe of come across Sherlock’s cheek, “I didn’t expect it to reach that far.”
“Right,” John hesitated, losing a bit of his flirtatious confidence, “scoot forward a bit,” he said before moving to assist him. Sherlock turned his head - obviously confused - but John fixed him with a stare which kept him quiet and pliant as they jointly made space for John against the headboard behind Sherlock. Once settled, John pulled him backwards into the V of his legs so that Sherlock’s back rested against John’s naked front, “We’re going to work together on this. You’re going to deal with your...”
“Yes, he is.”
“I may have been accidentally leaving things in that exact spot and marking their progress,” Holmes admits a bit ashamedly.
John and Mycroft sit at a table and the older Holmes explains that Irene is dead. They discuss how to break it to Sherlock – what to tell him – because he appears not to feel things but surely that’s not entirely true.
Sherlock hadn’t really bothered with self-pleasure in the past. The act was dull, boring, and repetitive and Sherlock had always struggled to maintain an erection whenever his traitorous body insisted it needed relief. Knowing he was unable to keep his penis in a hardened state, Sherlock often relied on nocturnal emissions to keep his body healthy and sated.
“Sherlock?” He asks, confused, as he tries to slow his heart down. From the intense knocking, he thought someone was dying.
John moved his mouth slowly down Sherlock’s body, pausing briefly to play with his nipples this time, only pausing when he had reached the top of his trousers again. Undoing the flies for the second time that evening, he lowered pants and trousers down at the same time, aiding Sherlock in lifting one foot and then the other to free himself of the cloth.
“You said it’s when a person cannot achieve orgasm by themselves. You’re not me, so it should work?” Sherlock asked hopefully, his testicles beginning to ache and throb.
He sets the now-empty cup down, eyes landing on John’s chair. He closes his eyes, as if in pain, before turning his back on the furniture. He sits at the desk again, fingers drumming against the wood as he stares out the window, becoming lost in thought. The next time he becomes aware of his surroundings, however, he finds that his head has rotated practically 180 degrees to the right without his awareness, leading his gaze directly to John’s chair once more.
Sherlock blushes again and tries to hide his face against the right side of John’s head. Sherlock can both feel and hear John’s laugh, so he tightens his grip on John’s back (where his hands must have fallen of their own accord during the kiss) and whispers in to his ear, “Please take me home.”
Looking back at everything, I think that point of our friendship was the happiest we ever were.
you care?” Holmes asks.
Two days later another letter from Holmes arrived in the mail.
Watson grumbles unintelligibly at that and watches as Sherlock offers his own coat to Irene so as to make John more comfortable with the situation. Irene asks about the motorist case, wanting to know how it’s done since she won’t be giving in to the real reason they’re visiting.
“Fine,” he agrees tersely.
“I fell out of bed,” Sherlock blushed deeply, lying unbelievably.
“It could have been poison. Or a bomb. Or anthrax.”
For long moments they simply stare at each other intently, looking as though a silent conversation is being waged even though they’re merely crossing the threshold of revelation together.
. He has wanted this for so long, but he never imagined that his level of desire could be higher in the moment of its actualization than it is in his dreams.
I took a deep, fortifying breath before forcing myself to push forward, “I have found myself, over the past few days, plagued by a question.”
he’s not too keen on her.”
“Yes, John,” he replies automatically before moving to do just that.
John simply chuckled and turned back around himself, lifting his paper to keep reading.
They lay in a comfortable silence, John’s right hand tracing nonsensical patterns on Sherlock’s left arm while Sherlock’s left hand traces circles over John’s heart.
“For work,” John clarifies to the group, trying not to blush.
After another ten minutes of sweat-flushed movement, Sherlock growled and punched the bed angrily, “John! This isn’t working!”
John likes to start his letters with “Dear Friend”, but Sherlock can’t bring himself to use the term in return. It feels like John has been his only true friend throughout his entire life, and John knows that already.
“My first experience with proper stimuli, and you’re amazed that I possess a quick refractory period?” He asks in honest confusion, as though John might be an idiot.
Sherlock corrects him that it was only 25 tramps, at most, and John leaps over the table to strangle him again. When they’re standing in an even smaller diner, it appears that John also punched him in the face, but Sherlock is still more concerned about if John is really planning to keep the moustache. John claims that Mary likes it - she doesn’t - and John becomes aggravated again.
After placing the groceries away, he makes a cup of tea before heading towards the sofa to read the paper. The stack of three DVD cases with “Sherlock” emblazoned on them catch his eye, causing his eyebrows to lift in surprise.
John comes out of the bathroom in just his robe and walks right past a hanging body in the living room to sit in his chair. Sherlock explains that their most recent case didn’t commit suicide as was apparent, the mannequin helped to prove it.
The train ride, besides being crowded, is uneventful. John sits near the window reading while Sherlock prefers the aisle to “people watch”.
before lifting up just enough to kiss John on the lips, “And I you,” he assures once the kiss ends. He rolls off to the side, not wanting to suffocate the smaller man under his weight.
And John - never very adept at refusing this man a single thing - did.
“Yep,” he answers, elongating the ‘e’ and popping the ‘p’ as he’s prone to do occasionally.
“But…” He starts feebly, gesturing less wildly once more.
“I really don’t think…” he starts, but is cut off once again.
Sherlock nodded quickly and then moved his hands to his trouser buckle, seemingly happy to undress in the middle of the living room, something which made John feel scandalised.
He huffs indignantly, "I'm not
They watch Sherlock and John’s exchange for a few more moments before Holmes speaks up again.
“John…” Sherlock starts in a panic, thinking that he’s done something wrong, but he’s struck dumb as John moves.
He follows the pair to Angelo’s, and Sherlock’s determination settles more solidly in his chest. This is completely unacceptable and something clearly needs to change. So, whether he actually believes this will work or not, Sherlock is going to damn-well
“No, absolutely not. Not sure what I would have done with my own wing anyway,” John chuckled, “I’m sure Mycroft’s room will be fine.”
John’s face flushes in embarrassment. So Sherlock
John smiled brightly, turning them against the crowd and listening to the music. It had almost quietened to nothingness, with just a soft piano solo in the middle as the female singer swayed. When she began to sing again, the crowd began to applaud and John couldn't help it as he stepped onto his tiptoes and kissed Sherlock softly. Their lips had barely parted before John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders and pulled his head down for another kiss, this one meaningful but not passionate. To anyone observing, it looked like a kiss between two people in love with each other, and when John pulled back, his cheeks flushed as he rested his forehead against Sherlock's, just enjoying the moment.
“Oh yes, the riding crop experiment,” Holmes smiles fondly, “that yielded a lot of good information for future cases, as well as this one.”
I love comments and kudos, but welcome constructive criticism, as well.
have been a better choice for the role.
He walks out in to the common room, not stopping his forward movement until he’s outside of the portrait in the hall, too afraid of what he’ll do if he stays too close to him. Sherlock says he loves him, but surely he wouldn’t forgive John for taking advantage of his less-than-coherent state.
But it isn’t John that storms in in a murderous rage, it’s Mary.
John shrugs like it’s not a big deal and repeats, “Fact is: he has it in front of him, and you owe him a drink for outranking you.”
Let us know what you think!
He lifts Sherlock’s left hand, covering the rest of the distance with a bend of his waist, and places a light kiss to the new mark. A shiver moves through Sherlock at the feel. He has no interest in any of the marks on his transport, but he loves that John does.
It’s not what I want to ask, but it’s a start.
Sherlock's glare intensifies as John walks over to the desk and grabs his Nook before sitting in his own chair.
over her. He loved Mary, yes, but Holmes is the one he wants to share the rest of life’s adventures with.
He does look down after saying the words, unable to look John in the eye and see his shock and disgust. The same fear that has kept him from deducing John’s feelings all along.
“And it annoys you?”
Sherlock reached up with his right hand to clasp the back of John’s neck in response, bringing his mouth down to meet his own with a greedy whine.
). John asks if everyone he’s ever met has been a psychopath and Sherlock tells him yes, trying to move on quickly. John stops him, blowing up at the joking tone. Sherlock assures him that he isn’t joking: John is attracted to danger and gets bored with the mundane just as easily as Sherlock does.
Sensing the positive response, Sherlock proceeded to take the right testicle into his mouth, lavishing it with attention as he played with the weight, rolling it slightly on his tongue.
“You’re talking,” Sherlock argues, slightly more alert.
“What?” Sherlock asks in shock, utterly confused.
When Sherlock informs John that he should join him again, John becomes suspicious.
Lestrade shakes his head again, in bemusement this time, and goes about ignoring the other man.
to know what’s on there?” John retorts.
you ever had a relationship?”
The moment is broken as they hear Mary’s voice from the telly, drawing both of their attentions back to the screen.
So with a deep breath I move back to the stage and place the sheet music in its envelope, my violin in its case.
John removes himself from the overly warm skin with a flushed face, moving to kiss Sherlock’s mouth passionately as his hands begin to work on the buttons of the other man’s shirt. As if in answer, Sherlock’s hands finally dare to sneak under John’s jumper to caress the bare skin beneath. John pulls back and lifts his arms, as if surrendering. Maybe, in a way, he is.
When they get up to their room, John commandeers the bathroom first before lying on his left side, settling snuggly under the covers of his bed. There’s a glass of water and a bottle of paracetamol on the bedside table, and he’s valiantly attempting to stay awake, even as his eyes close. When Sherlock exits the bathroom, he hesitates awkwardly at the foot of the beds.
“I know,” he agrees, “Soon,” but then he continues moving his attention downwards, running his hands over his chest, “I think about your chest; about how your sheet hardly covers it and your shirts do little more than the sheet.”
“Does Tom look…” Holmes starts slowly.
“They’re not us, love,” Holmes intones with regret for them.
The scene cuts to a flashback of the client’s story. The car backfires and a man lays dead. Skip ahead to present time, New Scotland Yard is on the scene and Greg is advising the lead investigator - Carter - to work with Sherlock if he can manage it. Just John shows up with a laptop in hand, Sherlock being too lazy to get dressed or leave the flat.
Holmes lets out an audible “Oh!” as he understands exactly how much of a difference it made that the killer was not caught just a few days after The Bloody Guardsman case like he had been in their own timeline. That same man who had been practicing to attack military officials later, having not been caught, was given opportunity to act on his plan.
Sherlock and John make their way to the car and Sherlock pops his collar again. John calls him out on his mysterious cheekbones and trying to look cool.
“No, throughout the years you have most certainly sensitized me to caring about the victims and clients at least to the same degree that I care about solving the crime.”
ringtone chimes in.
“Holmes,” he begins in a quiet, saddened tone, but the younger man cuts him off before he can continue further.
your mouth,” John moaned again.
As Sherlock sighs and quiets again, John chuckles to himself tiredly. Without realizing, his thumb begins to move softly over his friend’s pronounced cheekbone as sleep gladly overtakes him.
“Sherlock, what did you do with the DVDs?” John calls to him in frustration, still looking around the living room.
The camera keeps rolling.
is the life they choose. Each has chosen the other and there are no more words to be said on the matter.
John clears his throat awkwardly, “Good.”
“I was thinking...perhaps...if you're amenable...” Sherlock stuttered, biting his lip in pleasure, “I hoped you might penetrate me.”
fault I’ve never been here before and it’s dark outside!”
Watson merely shakes his head, the angry tears threatening to fall, before he stands and moves towards his room, “Sod it. We can finish the last discs tomorrow, I just can’t right now.”
Happy Thanksgiving! (Spoiler alert: I'm American)
When you pull back, your smile is still radiant, “Sherlock, do you remember what brought me here?”
“Just doesn’t seem to fit the transgression is all I’m trying to point out,” Sherlock muttered petulantly before returning both mouth and hand to their tasks.
“And quite honestly, an inferior reality,” Watson adds with a bit of a smirk.
Sliding his hands up John’s body, Sherlock pulls off the jumper and lets it fall to the side. Normally John would wear a vest, but there had been a recent issue with them (namely Sherlock melting them for an experiment on various textiles. He’s promised to replace them, however, now he’s not so sure that he wants him to) which has forced John to be bare under the jumper. The cold air immediately hits John and causes him to shiver and his nipples to pucker into erect nubs which Sherlock desperately wants to taste; he wants to suck and lick and
“Oh, Watson, calm down,” Holmes admonishes, “nothing happened.”
As he reaches the door, John notices that Sherlock has stood and is following him. He turns around fully to face him, “What are you doing?”
“How does it feel?” Sherlock asked, his eyes wide and flicking across John’s body up and down and over his entire skin.
“On the contrary, I fear that there is incredible danger in what I am about to ask of you.”
He’s tired - it being nearly 3:30am at this point - but he fears going back to his own room. What will he find? God, he hopes Sherlock didn’t run off and actually stayed where he was told. That thought alone spurs him quickly back to his room to make sure.
The camera pans to show Sherlock standing a ways off in the graveyard before the end credits roll.
“Oh yes,” John hummed, stretching his legs out, “Very often, but only once I’ve recovered.”
Watson shifts uncomfortably on the couch once more, an eerie feeling of being watched creeping over him, “Holmes, what the hell is this?”
was bad,” Holmes answers.
a mind reader.”
left you, you were dressed. Sherlock is…”
“I don’t…” Sherlock panted, eyes closed with an almost pained look of bliss on his face. He licked his lips and swallowed before completing the statement: “I don’t know what to do.”
“I’ve changed my mind; maybe you don’t
“No, they’re not all particularly alpha males.”
John kissed Sherlock again, moving to trail kisses down Sherlock’s jaw line and then his neck as he worked his way inside Sherlock with tenderness and care, checking with Sherlock each time he winced or hissed at the pain.
“If no women are going to dance with me because they think I’m with you, I might as well dance with who I can. Come on, then,
“Stop it now,” Mycroft warns, looking at their joined hands as though they’re an alarming threat.
John chuckles, “Nothing. Will you keep wearing them?”
“Excellent,” Sherlock grinned again before reaching for a paper and pen from the bedside table, “I’ll make notes now.”
John blinked and carefully stood, stamping the life back into his cramped up legs as he stroked Sherlock’s face gently, “I wasn’t going to do that here,” John promised, kissing the corner of Sherlock’s mouth softly, “this was just a warm up. I was going to take you to bed and ravish you properly. Like you deserve.”
“My body takes care of itself on its own.”
“I’ll make it up to you,” John promised, stroking a hand up and down Sherlock’s thigh until the tip of his finger stroked across Sherlock’s exposed scrotum, “if you’re still in the mood, that is.”
When John enters his room, he discovers that the power has gone out with the storm when he tries to turn on his light. That's alright, it's only one in the afternoon, so he figures it'll be back on before night falls. Surely.
They both break out in to relieved, happy smiles as Sherlock moves the ring from his still sweaty palm to John’s ring finger.
“Oh, there’s plenty of time for
John wordlessly holds up four DVD cases: the three missing case evidence ones from a few weeks back, and a plain case that has a post-it note on the front.
Sherlock’s brain supplies,
You cancelled plans to come with me. The case itself was fairly simple, it mostly just needed to not involve the police which is why I was called in, and you won’t even be able to release the write-up about it for another 10 years thanks to the non-disclosure agreement we signed. You had no reason to come along, but you did anyway so that I wouldn’t need to fly alone, not mentioning a single word about it. Once done, you asked me if we could take the train back instead; you claimed to have never used the high-speed form of travel before, but it was a lie.
John smiled at the lyrics as he swayed with Sherlock, looking up and ignoring everybody else in the hall. The crowds melted away until it was just the two of them, sharing this tender moment.
All the words I've yet to say
“But you said he had never...
“You think I walk off coolly?” Holmes asks, sounding as though he’s preening under the praise.
no life worth living without him, so he needs to stop acting the hero! No more running away, no more sacrificing yourself for me, no more being noble because you aren’t noble with anyone else so why when it comes to me, you arse…”
These nights, with you in my arms, I can almost remember what I fought to return to; can almost pretend that I don’t feel dead inside, aching with my despair over having lost you anyway, in the end.
Holmes and Watson both laugh, having forgot that the exchange had happened between them. They both thought it summed up their friendship quite adequately.
As Sherlock stood there, offended, John walked away laughing towards the bathroom at the other end of the room.
“Charming as always, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft sneered through the other end of the line.
The scent of male ejaculate hangs heady and strong in the air between them and Sherlock blushes fiercely as John finally realises what’s happened, “Oh,” he whispers.
John’s date clears her throat awkwardly as she stands up, grabbing her coat from the back of her chair, “I’ll just leave you two alone, shall I?” she says gently before walking away as the silence continues.
“I still can’t believe you had known the man for how many years yet still didn’t know his first name was Greg,” Watson says.
“Oh, this should be entertaining,” Watson says with an amused smile already in place.
“We don’t have hypothermia,” John smirks before going still, “and I don’t think this is about the cold
“And I’ve
“What…?” Watson starts to ask, but Holmes redirects his attention back to the telly suddenly.
Sherlock shakes his head and consciously breathes for the first time in a long while, bringing himself out of his John-induced trance. He makes a decision to attempt to sleep, so he closes the laptop and places it on the floor beside the bed before moving to lay on his right side, facing John’s back.
“No, you’ve been a ruddy awful influence on my sense of decency,” he corrects.
It’s not a clear question, but Sherlock doesn’t need him to clarify; he knows what he’s asking. His only delay comes from the feeling of déjà vu he gets at the words. He’s heard them before, in his Mind Palace. He has already spoken the answer.
I returned late one evening from a home visit of one of my clients to find Holmes missing, merely a letter resting innocently on the table in his stead. It read:
John’s hand moves from Sherlock’s hair to his cheek, and the younger man leans in to his touch unthinkingly.
“Then why are there credits as though it were a legitimate TV show?”
4:11am.
John simply hums in reply, a content smile on his own.
It only gets weirder from there.
Without a word, John moves confidently to straddle Sherlock’s lap, smiling as they lock eyes before kissing heatedly. John’s hands move in to those outrageous curls as Sherlock’s travel down John’s sides to grasp at his hips.
Sherlock can only nod, not trusting his voice.
“No. What are you doing? I’m having a bath,” John sighed, rubbing his temples.
I was unsurprised when I saw his explanation come to an abrupt end, for that is precisely how he would act in person. What made my breath catch in uncertainty was the unusual comma in the middle of a completely ordinary phrase.
“Do you want some tea?” He asks quietly.
“Pulling up my trousers,” Sherlock explained, “I didn’t want to trip; I’d likely land on my penis.”
John noses his way to the other side of Sherlock’s neck, as though he can’t bring himself to break contact with him for even a moment. Sherlock naturally rolls his head to the right to accommodate the move, eyes closed and mouth open in silent pleasure.
Your gaze lifts and I almost wish it hadn’t. You look so scared, anguished, and tired. Your head tilts and you lick your lips, “Because…” you start, but fumble for where to go next. Your eyes flicker away for a brief second before returning resolutely to mine, “she’s not you. That sounds stupid but…” you shake your head and direct the next bit to the desk, “I’d hold her and it wouldn’t ease my fears. She wasn’t as understanding as you and she felt wrong and she
“Mr. Holmes,” Inspector Lestrade nodded as he removed his hat from his head and stepped in to the flat. Mrs. Hudson turned quickly and removed herself back to her own flat downstairs.
Holmes intones a soft, “Mmhmm,” to which Watson rolls his eyes.
“Well at least Mycroft is just as set on being mysterious as ours is.”
Back to Christmas, a heavily pregnant Mary stands from the couch and John gives a speech about how the problems of her past are her business, but the problems of her future are his privilege.
“It says here that you did. He taught science,” John responded, narrowing his eyes, “Is there any reason you don't want to go?”
Without any context – with only one look at John’s face as he lets go of Moriarty – Sherlock knows the dots are on him. He shakes his head minutely in a
John closes it gently and then absentmindedly runs his left thumb over the faux-suede reverently, lost in thoughts. Sherlock never explicitly proclaims who the “you” to whom most entries are directed is, but even John can figure out they’re for him. The entire abominable-looking journal is a love letter. And Sherlock’s note.
Sherlock huffs as he stands, glaring at John as he walks to him and grabs the laptop from his hands roughly. He sits down in his chair petulantly.
was almost too much in itself. Sherlock broke off the kiss and slammed his head back against the wall with a moan.
“He had a dreadful time of it there,” Mrs. Holmes answered sadly, “Terrible children. Awful. Almost feral, I would say.”
“Are you kidding me? That is
“The rest of the footage is real, though.”
Next scene all three men are heading to the hollow even though this is an awful plan. Because no one wants to look like a wimp for staying behind? Who knows.
until right now. I thought Mycroft was just taking the piss with you since you refused to wear pants in Buckingham Fucking Palace.”
“I beg your pardon?” Inspector Jones questioned, his mirth quickly melting away at the one word.
“I would never have done that to you: made you watch,” Holmes swears, “it was bad enough I had to disappear for so long and leave you to think I was dead but to make you watch it…?” he trails off, unable to think of a more heartless, unspeakable thing to ever do to his best friend.
“I can hardly believe how quickly you can turn in to someone else entirely,” Watson admits with admiration.
“I know what you’re trying to do,” Watson starts, holding his cup and staring at his friend overtop of it, “and I appreciate the effort,” he smiles, and Holmes offers a shy one in return, “but the reality is that, while it was truly one of the worst times of my entire life, there’s no denying that it happened.”
“Yeah, way more ridiculous than you crashing my date with Mary at the cinema,” Watson chuckles sarcastically with an eye roll.
“Stop thinking,” John ordered not unkindly, sounding remarkably like the other man, “we can think it all through later, but for now...” he trailed off as his gaze turned absolutely predatory. John closed the small space between them, “lie down.”
Sherlock nodded in understanding, only jumping slightly when John’s hand wrapped around his cock and began to stroke. The friction was glorious, but not enough and it had Sherlock thrusting his hips into John’s hand within sweet seconds, something John enjoyed as his other hand moved to the bedside table to pull out the pump bottle of lubricant they had bought for their heavy frottage and intercrural sessions.
he wants to admit.
Prof. Ellis laughed, “No, of course you’re not; that much is absurdly obvious to anyone really looking.”
Sherlock clears his throat lightly before following John’s answers to a new question: “Who are you speaking to right now?”
Just as John is about to fall back to sleep due to the prolonged silence from the other man, Sherlock speaks up once more.
“No. No I -- I don’t think it’s for me,” Sherlock said in a hurry, taking another sip of his alcohol with a wince.
“Sorry?”
Upon his return, Holmes had disguised himself as an old man and literally bumped in to Watson on the street, later following him home to reveal that he was back. It was a rather natural return, with a few shed tears of relief, very little animosity, and a lot of questions. They had spent the entire night catching up and, by the end of it, all ill feelings were placed aside by their elation of being together again.
“Good. It’s good,” John gulped down air, eyes fluttering closed, “It’s good.”
“Are you married?” He decides to return to his list of questions. They’re designed specifically to test the validity of things said while asleep, not for any personal gain.
There was an aching in my chest to read this, as I felt a physical pull to be near him and help him in any way that I could. I longed for the invitation as much as he longed to extend it.
You give me one last look before allowing her to lead you away.
“No,” Prof. Ellis continued to the both of them now, much more serious, “because you both have those stupid looks on your faces that say you have no idea that your feelings are mutual,” after letting that statement sink into the brains of the frozen men before him, he reached out and placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and said, “It was great to see you again; stay in touch this time,” before turning to John, “It was a pleasure to meet you, John.” He walked off before either man could respond to him.
Watson’s eyebrows crease, “Were you…
,” Watson says with a bit of trepidation.
“You kissed me,” he reminded John, heart racing, as if he’d already forgotten the moment, “on my ear, before I…”
Follow Goddess_of_the_Night on
Watson does a full stop, having never thought of it that way before, “Does that mean that more people have been assuming we’re gay since I stopped wearing my ring?” He asks honestly, but Holmes merely shushes him with a wave, his eyes transfixed on the screen again.
“I said: wrong,” Holmes enunciated quite clearly as he gracefully stood from his crouched position next to the bodies and came to stand among us.
Watson’s hand blindly reaches towards Holmes, his left hand landing on his right knee and grabbing tight.
Inn keeper Billy falsely apologizes to his partner Gary for purchasing the meat products, but Greg calls him out on the lie. Gary then tells the truth about passing a regular dog off as the hound to improve their business.
John moaned and unconsciously rubbed his still-clothed erection against Sherlock’s thigh for some semblance of satisfaction.
“Mmm?” John grunts in response, eyes opening slowly as he turns his head to look at him again.
After Sherlock hangs up with John, who called to tell him the news and warn him, he gets up and begins to prepare tea for two, then picks up his violin to play some Bach. Moriarty attempts to sneak up on Sherlock, but isn’t familiar with the tricky steps and where to avoid making a noise. Sherlock is cordial to the criminal, offering him tea, allowing him to have an apple, and offering him the use of John’s chair. Moriarty instead takes Sherlock’s.
“I’ll be waiting in my room when you’re finished changing,” he says without looking up from the laptop he’s currently using.
Two years ago John had injured his right leg and left shoulder in a Quidditch accident. It ended his time as a (very good) Chaser, but he didn’t mind too much; he always knew he wasn’t going to play Quidditch forever and the injury allowed him to start focusing more on his post-graduate plans of studying medicine.
But Holmes knows that isn’t it at all. Anyone else who has tried to make him more personable has always been belittled in return; he’s only ever allowed Watson to do it. Why? Because Watson is a special case all his own, in many respects, which is what has led Holmes to acknowledge that he is in love with the other man. There’s no other explanation for it.
Next Sherlock needs to avoid going in to shock: find something calming. He looks for John and instead finds Mary, in her wedding dress, aiming a gun at him. If he can’t access John, what else is there that could calm him? Redbeard. He finds the dog and talks to him (
“All one has to do is mention that someone is in danger or that it’s of national security and they’ve got your full attention.”
“How is it not working? Men were practically built to find any sexual contact directly to their cock sufficiently arousing,” John shot back.
“Shhh,” John whispered, smiling as he pretended that Sherlock’s cock was his own and doing his own routine (two long strokes followed by a thumb across the wet slit). Sherlock’s breathing hitched, deep groans resonating from the detective’s chest which rumbled through to John’s own skin as he worked, stroking and caressing the small bundle of nerves under the head in a circular motion. Sherlock’s hips shuddered, a shiver running through his body as he let his head fall backwards onto John’s shoulder with a hum of pleasure.
“Must I?” Sherlock grumbled, looking away, “You already know it…and I've never said it to anybody before. Surely you understand?”
“I’ve never seen it...not
John flushes in embarrassment, “I don’t have a
Watson sighs heavily as he scrubs his hands over his face, “It was easier to lose her than you,” he admits, barely above a whisper, for the first time.
“But you lived here? As a child?” John continued to ask, seeming to be stunned at the sheer size. It looked like something from an old documentary he had watched about royalty.
Next scene shows Sholto preparing for the wedding, then just as quick, everyone is exiting the church after the ceremony.
John closed his eyes contentedly, smile only growing more fond, before turning his face back towards the ceiling, “You’re an idiot.”
“Please, call me John,” John smiled, “Thank you for allowing us to stay.”
“What, exactly, are mysterious cheekbones, Watson?”
Flashback to Sherlock in a restaurant, wearing his hospital gown and still attached to a drip. Magnussen comes in and Sherlock strikes a deal with him: his brother (well, his laptop, anyway) in exchange for an invitation to Appledore. Sherlock takes his glasses, thinking the information about people shows on the lenses, like a computer.
Sherlock turned sharply towards him, “Don’t,” he stated, but it was practically a plea, his eyes filled with turmoil, “Don’t say anything you don’t mean or that we can’t come back from.”
and JESUS! Sherlock is that a diagram?” He demanded while gesturing towards the paper.
“Your shoulder and leg will not agree with you in the morning,” he points out.
“You really solved this one without so much as looking at the case file?” Watson asks.
“So why were you mixing the two?”
Holmes sits more forward on the couch, hands clasped between his spread knees in an equal mix of anticipation and trepidation.
worked out quite well, “Well what was it then?” He asks instead.
Holmes tuts in disappointment, “Watson,” he scolds for his lack of intelligence, “of course he could have if he had wanted to. Which leads me to think that the ceremony wasn’t the important thing.”
“Holmes, I…” Watson starts quietly, shocked by the revelation, “I never knew.”
This letter, though, is very curious. No one writes letters anymore.
“You may attempt it, but I doubt it will work,” Sherlock responded flippantly, even as his body tilted his head to the side to grant better access to the doctor.
“Back to that again, eh?” John asks conversationally as he lifts the covers and climbs in.
saving.
John merely hums, clearly not aware of what he’s responding to, but Sherlock takes it as an agreement anyway.
“I knew you were lying,” Holmes whispers.
John actually chuckled and asked, “What for?”
“No need,” Holmes challenges his brother, “we’ve got our own dimension jumping worm hole right here in our very own flat,” he says with false excitement, gesturing towards their coffee table.
he corrects – unmoving hand reaching for the razor. His friend had paused it without his notice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, at least we didn’t go through that,” he says lightly, smiling sheepishly at his friend next to him.
I watched as he stepped yet closer to me, unsure but trying to appear brave, and my heart raced as my eyes landed on his lips in want instead. I looked back to his eyes when he began to speak again. They looked a bit more certain now.
“I…yes,” he admits quietly.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, sounding slightly disappointed.
“Bullshit!” Watson spits, “One month unsupervised and…” he stops, brow furrowing in confusion, his anger dissipating completely, “they haven’t seen each other for a
Instead of responding, Sherlock headed straight for the vehicle.
a scratchy sensation which usually meant the information had been deleted, “Nope,” he said with a shake of his head.
“No he’s not,” Holmes states with an edge of amusement, “unsettled about
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
one.”
“John,” Sherlock whispered, feeling the urge to touch the door in an attempt to get closer to John without actually allowing the doctor to know he was there.
Sherlock narrows his eyes, suddenly aware of how dangerous this game could be. Lifting his glass cautiously he takes a drink and then huffs, “Honestly, it’s not like it’s an everyday occurrence.”
Holmes closes his eyes and shakes his head slightly in disbelief, just adding this new development to his list of reasons to hate his alternate self; he’s been about as subtle as a hand grenade since his return. And yet John still doesn’t seem to notice, and even Watson isn’t quite certain.
“You used to follow him around the gardens, your chubby little legs trying to keep up with him. It was adorable,” Mr. Holmes commented, looking off wistfully, “Mycroft was obsessed with Robin Hood before Sherlock was born; refused to take off his tights even for bed. When Sherlock was born, however, Mycroft allowed Sherlock to join in. We have photos somewhere...”
Sherlock’s breath hitches as his cock responds to the words, filling at the same time as his desire for this man does.
“You wouldn’t,” Sherlock grumbled disbelievingly, his eyebrow raised playfully, “Your meagre salary wouldn’t pay for a full crime scene cleaning…though I suppose you could ask Mrs. Hudson; she has some experience in removing blood and gunshot resi--- not that. Blood. Obviously.”
Your eyes meet mine, closer now but no less honest.
John leaves the flat and gets approached by a strange woman on the street.
…have another brother?”
“Because I forgave you right after your return without hitting or strangling you?”
“They’re really not,” Sherlock negates as he shakes his head affectionately.
“Sherlock, yes. Just like that,” John moaned, his other hand moving to pluck and stroke at his now puckered nipples.
“Oh,” Sherlock said softly.
“I think about your curls and how I’d love to grab hold of them and tug just enough to cause pleasure, not pain,” he says, threading a hand in to the curls to demonstrate. Sherlock moans at the oddly delicious feeling of the slight tug on his roots.
She forward, he back.
Holmes is eager to see how Sherlock infiltrates Magnussen’s estate, especially now that the blackmailer knows what he looks like. When they had dealt with Magnussen in their own timeline – a mere six months previous – he had disguised himself as a plumber to gain access to his home, and became engaged to the housemaid to gain information. He assumes, as things have been matching up generally, that Sherlock is about to propose to Janine for this same all-around purpose.
“I’ll order,” Sherlock insists and then smiles, “and I’ll ask them to bring burnable materials. I’ll call Chin from the Golden Dragon; he still owes me.”
The cluster of three freckles towards his collar bone are closer to the correct spot, so he kisses them before lavishing the same attention to them as the other side. John isn’t exactly certain
a compliment.”
Sherlock’s confusion causes him to momentarily forget his unwillingness to dance, “Really, John, that makes absolutely no sense.”
“I love how simple some people are; loving to correct information, even when they don’t wish to share it.”
They each grab the second disc that contains their name and head to their separate bedrooms with their laptops. They figured that if these other versions of themselves thought it best not to watch them together, then they should probably listen.
“I’m not tired yet; I don’t typically sleep two nights in a row,” Sherlock answers, already distracted by the laptop again.
With a resolved notion that he will damn well kiss that boy should he still want it once his head is cleared, he pushes off the wall to find Sherlock’s experiment room. He enters to find the lights on, too large a flame beneath the cauldron, and books strewn haphazardly. With a sigh he rights the chaos, lowers the flame to stasis level, and puts out the lights before leaving again.
Sherlock flushes a bit darker, though it shouldn’t really be possible, “John,” he whispers as a plea, his face turning in to the warm palm on his cheek.
It is a story about murder - because so many of our cases are – but above all, it is a story about love. That is why I am writing it here, in my personal journal that is always hidden below a false bottom in my desk. I must confess: I hope that one day someone will find this and read all of the wonderful aspects of my amazing life with Holmes that I dare not share with anyone at this time. It is also my hope that both Holmes and I are long since gone before that happens.
Sherlock’s left hand moves to cover John’s finally, squeezing reassuringly, “Okay.”
“I’m not a blushing virgin, John!” Sherlock argued, despite the flush which covered his cheeks.
John’s eyebrows shoot upwards at the answer, “A love and truth potion? But you despise love!” he says without thinking it through.
Once the main screen loads, they both sit and simply stare at the title of the episode for a good minute.
“Did you go and bloody
John simply slow blinks at him a few times, mouth actually opening and closing soundlessly twice before he can manage to make words come out, “You aren’t serious.”
John looks down and notices that his own thumb is covering the mark, “Oh! Right,” he says, then looks back at Sherlock, “it’s fading.”
Holmes looks in to the earnest face of his lover, still amazed that they’ve finally come together. He sees in Watson’s eyes their years of combined longing and pain, and the glimmer of sadness that there is a version of them that has not yet gotten here. He desperately wants to help them, because that’s what his doctor does: helps people.
“No, can’t
“Ah, this is the one,” Mr. Holmes said as he pulled out a larger, colour photo. It showed a small, slightly chubby ginger-haired boy in a full Robin Hood costume and pretend bow and arrow. John estimated that Mycroft was around ten, perhaps a little younger, but it was Sherlock who drew his eye. The toddler was standing behind Mycroft, his face split in a giant gummy smile whilst dark curls tumbled over his face. Sherlock was adorable, but his costume made him look even cuter. A flower garland around his hair, and a long green tunic fashioned into a dress.
I'm clearly a music nerd, recognizing the thing about The Planets (and legitimately becoming upset by it each time I rewatch).
Watson smiles, shaking his head, “I was just being lazy, really.”
“Yes,” Sherlock agrees timidly.
“Tick tock, Sherlock,” teasing from Bill, judging by the timbre.
“Would it alarm you to know that it
Sherlock sat on the bed, looking lost and vulnerable at the face of his best friend. His brain, able to function for the first time since entering the room, wondered what this all meant.
“Alright, Sherlock,” John easily flipped the switch to his flirtatious bedroom demeanor, “take your pants off.”
John smiles at her as she sits down and they talk briefly before John begins his proposal speech. It’s not the same speech Watson had given, considering the different circumstances and all, and it’s not very eloquent.
“Nothing here,” Watson says, hands on his hips and turning to look at Holmes to his right.
for that!” Sherlock growls as he turns to glare at him, putting an end to his pacing.
Holmes turns to him, face full of emotion, “I don’t know that I could do something like that to you again,” he says honestly.
The next day another letter arrived.
“They look really happy,” John says quietly, still facing forward.
Next morning Mycroft comes to visit. Sherlock and John do a spectacular job of going about their business pretending he’s not there except for answering his questions. Mrs. Hudson admonishes Mycroft for putting Sherlock in danger, prompting Mycroft to tell her to shut up. Sherlock and John turn their full attentions on to the other man in distaste, chastising him. Mycroft apologizes and they move on with the conversation. The elder Holmes gets a call and moves to the hallway, allowing John space to ask about the moaning text message which Sherlock is absurdly aloof about. Mycroft reenters and exchanges words with Sherlock before leaving.
And damn if John wasn’t curious about how he planned to do that, “...how?” he asked timidly, honestly scared of the answer.
in what feels like a memory instead of a dream.
John kissed him on the lips before answering honestly, “I hope to hear them someday,” he admits, “but like I said: there’s no rush.”
look. As he opens his mouth to belittle him, John waves his hand dismissively and turns towards his room once more, “No, forget it. I’ll come back.”
Sherlock tells the story about the East Wind that Mycroft used to tell him as a boy.
“Is that…the Vitruvian man with my face on it?” Watson asks in shock.
“If I had known it would become a part of my supposed image, I would have taken the flat cap myself instead of giving it to you.”
Holmes doesn’t know what to say and, for once, wisely decides to say nothing at all. Instead, he raises a hand to guide his friend’s face towards his so that he has to look him in the eye, where he portrays all of his regrets and echoing sadness.
Sherlock shakes his head as though waking up and clears his throat, “It
John guided Sherlock’s face back down to kiss him again, adding heat that hadn’t been there before, too worried of scaring him off. John’s hands went to work on pushing the dressing gown off Sherlock’s shoulders before lifting the shirt over his head to add it to the floor.
John breathed in deeply through his nose to calm himself, “You’re right,” he admitted finally, “it’s just not a topic two friends typically have with each other.”
Moriarty yells about skinning someone if they’re lying and then leaves the pool. The sniper dots disappear. The scene fades in to a woman dressed provocatively.
“To put it mildly. You practically saw logs in your sleep,” John keeps the conversation going, but he steadfastly refuses to open his eyes. He’s not honestly certain they
“Did you really do that?” Watson asks.
“I kept you up,” Sherlock states guiltily, feeling awful about the fact.
written all over his face. The evidence of how often this happens to him shows clearly in his blatant, easy acceptance of it each and every time.
“Maybe they
But no, just as he thinks it, Sherlock lets out an even louder snore than before. John’s eyes shoot open as his jaw clenches again. John reaches out and pushes at Sherlock’s arm, not entirely certain what his game plan was for the move. To move him back to his left side? To wake him up so they can both be miserable? Either way, it’s not an entirely kind move to make, but John couldn’t care less at the moment.
John opens it and pulls out another coin, this one in a protective case, and places it reverently on the table in front of Sherlock instead of roughly like the other.
Once the latest round of drinks are drained, the group decides that another drink would not be wise; it was already nearing midnight as it was. They take another half hour to say goodbye’s and make false promises to keep in touch more, but then they all go their separate ways.
He had always opened his letters with “
Holmes chuckles, “John is occasionally as clever as you are, but not always.”
Sherock’s eyes fluttered closed at the prospect and John felt the sudden change in atmosphere, from playful banter to something utterly intimate and beautiful as he worked his fingers in and out of Sherlock, giving a subtle twist occasionally followed by a brush to Sherlock’s prostate. Sherlock, meanwhile, was clutching at the bed, head moving from side to side and his hair wild as he breathed heavily and looked up at John with adoration.
Watson merely shakes his head, not looking from the opening credit sequence. He feels as though he doesn’t breathe until they’re over and they’re transported three months prior, where Sherlock Holmes is still alive.
“It’s not pity,” Sherlock promises, “I just...you never talk about it, and it’s easy for me to forget what you went through.”
He closed his eyes against the memories of fists flying at his face, his stomach, his groin, but it did no good since it was his mind playing the images on the backs of his eyelids for him to see. He attempted in vain to not hear the taunts, the laughter at his expense, coming from his classmates. His mother had tried to tell him that they were just jealous of his intellect and didn’t know how to properly express it. Sherlock was convinced they were simply a bunch of arseholes.
The song the boys dance to is one that I (Kittie) adore, the second song is one which Goddess added.
After a few moments, Sherlock switched sides to give the other testicle the same treatment, salivating further in contentment at the aroused noises falling from John’s mouth. In a none-too-rare moment of genius, Sherlock lifted his right hand back to John’s cock and began pulling it in tandem with his flicking tongue.
“What about if I came along, too? Moral support and backup?” John asked, “And if any of them say anything, I’ll shoot them in the knee.”
“I think you’re overestimating how much sleep I’m actually getting when we share a bed,” John counters defensively, “I’m the one who tells you what happens in the night, in case you’ve forgotten.”
He raises his eyes and gives her a defiant smirk, “He came to me of his own free will when you began to try to control him,” he says, noticing the door to the flat open silently from the corner of his eye, “John may not love me the way I love him,” he says, unable to speak of him in the past tense, “but he sure as hell doesn’t love
“Oh!” Sherlock shouted, eyes opening wide, “That - do that. Keep doing it.”
Sherlock unwraps Irene’s phone and then he calls Mycroft to warn him to keep an eye out for her body. Cut to later when both Holmes brothers enter St. Bart’s to find Molly with Irene’s body. Sherlock IDs her and then Mycroft offers him a cigarette as the younger explains how he knew she’d be found dead. They discuss their family history; both of their social ineptitudes when it comes to caring for others.
“You two flirting and giggling back there in your own little world,” she smiles at John knowingly.
“I work with Sherlock Holmes. He solves these amazing cases and I try to relay on my blog how he does it. I don’t think I do him justice, but people seem impressed anyway.”
?” Watson intones with a quiet, yet very real, anger.
Holmes takes a quick intake of breath. He wishes he could have stopped Watson from seeing this part.
“Not at all,” he answers honestly.
Moriarty goes on about how much Sherlock is going to enjoy being dead - how wonderful it is – but that people will miss him.
Feeling a curl of anguish in his stomach, John leaned over to touch Sherlock’s hand, “What happened?”
John’s arms reflexively pull him closer for a moment as a wave of protectiveness and love sweep through his body. He steps back and grabs Sherlock’s right hand in his left and smiles at the rest of the patrons as they pass, proud to finally have this man as his.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hums distractedly, “no.”
“Dull,” Sherlock complained, taking a sip of his tea and putting it aside, “It's probably another of those tedious fan letters.”
John asks Sherlock who it was that kidnapped him the night before, and Sherlock admits that he doesn’t know. Instead, he explains more about the imminent terrorist attack to John and his map of rats on the wall. Rat number 1 - Lord Moran - is the man who got on to the tube but was never seen getting off. Sherlock realizes that it’s not an underground network, it’s an Underground network, then notices that the security footage shows seven train cars leaving Westminster and only six arriving at St. James.
“Are you going to be on that all night? Aren’t you supposed to be sleeping?” John taunts tiredly. It was a long day at the surgery, and last night’s rest was still not quite enough to negate the sleep he failed to get during their most recent case.
sacred?” Holmes shouts, forgetting for a moment that his brother can’t hear him.
The words enrapture Sherlock just as they did Holmes and he accepts the case. Unlike Holmes, however, Sherlock pretends to be too busy to go himself but assures Henry that he’ll send John instead. John puts the pieces together, knowing Sherlock doesn’t actually care about the glowing bunny case, and fetches his cigarettes for him and they’re on their way a few hours later.
“The cheek is a perfectly natural reflexive location to punch when not thinking,” Watson defends himself, having punched Holmes in the same spot.
Lady Smallwood is leading a panel in questioning Magnussen.
You smile brightly and grasp my hand tighter, “Yes,” you agree.
Sherlock arched his back below him and then grunted, “If you must,” he attempted to feign indifference, but his body spoke far louder than his words.
Holmes looks at him as though he can hear the underlying reasoning as well and simply mutters, “Oh,” quietly.
“Right,” Sherlock nods, “Right. Sorry.”
So as I stand to deliver my best man speech in front of a crowd of people which contains only a handful of individuals that I know well, you seated to my right, it hits me hard in the gut that you’re married now and it’s not to me. I fumble over my words at the start because of this radiating pain, but push on and within short order am announcing to the room that I do, in fact, love you.
It should be ridiculous. It should be unsexy and unflattering to see a grown man in Y-fronts - especially white ones which do nothing to hide the very prominent bulge of John’s not-yet-erect penis - but Sherlock can feel his mouth filling with saliva, his blood beginning to boil with pure want. He diverts his eyes and looks away.
“John.”
“Won’t?” Scoffed Donovan. “You’re damn right I won’t. He’s a witness and I’m finally getting somewhere with him. I got his name, we can start with a backgr-“
The car engine cut out. John glanced outside, finding the car in a Costco car park. John’s words echoed within the confines. He jumped slightly when the driver door slammed shut. John watched the driver enter into the store. The silence grew as John thought- could Mycroft be right? Would Sherlock step aside once Mary entered their lives again? It was Sherlock who pushed them back together at Christmas. Would there be a risk of whatever he and Sherlock were moving towards disappear with her appearance? His ring was off. His feelings were gone. The paperwork was taken care of by the man before him, the same character who was jeopardizing them.
“You know I hate repeating myself,” Sherlock sighed. With each footstep that closed the distance, John could feel his heart drumming. His pulse throbbed in his neck and he swallowed the lump in his throat. He could taste his lust on the tip of his tongue when Sherlock stopped in front of him. The low timber, posh voice carried in the air in a rumble.
“Most likely. Do keep up.”
Chapter 20
They stayed there until they both were starting to stick together and breathing hard. He found Sherlock’s hand, and their fingers interlaced together. They laid there in silence, John listening intently to Sherlock’s pounding heartbeat. Both men relished in each other’s heaving bodies until could breathe normally again.
“How did you get free?” John asked as Mrs. Hudson fixed her clothes before going behind John. He felt her cold fingers struggling to pick at the ropes.
“Why would my-“ John shook his head, not bothering to finish the rest of his question. “What’s all this about? My linens don’t need to be washed.”
“Yeah, I get that…what are you thinking?”
“John?”
“DON’T WHAT? GIVE A DAMN?” bellowed John. His words slashed through the air, and added to the tension growing between them. He sniffed, and shifted his feet, glaring. “It took two of us to get here…I should get some say in EVERYTHING ABOUT HER!”
“What? Do you even know how to make a cake?” John asked in confusion.
Knowing grey eyes flickered at John for a second. It was a second too many for John. Mycroft was definitely an idiot for thinking that Sherlock wouldn’t notice. He notices everything. He licked his lips; aware that he couldn’t lie whatsoever if Sherlock asked what his kidnapping was about. It would eventually mean that Mycroft would also tell Sherlock about Mary. He closed his eyes for a moment. Regretting having to lost Sherlock already, and again. He couldn’t bear to see his face right now. A new wave of anger came across him as well just from Sherlock mentioning Mycroft. He couldn’t stand to look at Greg either. John quickly excused himself from the sitting room, and climbed the stairs to his bedroom.
“Yeah, how’d know?”
“Molly is finished with bodies.”
And they both did.
“Oh?” Sherlock’s eyes glinted.
-“This is Issac Spoo,” introduced Moran followed by several hard pats on the man’s head. Moran pointed towards the camera as if towards John and Sherlock and the footage zoomed out, showing a littered floor, a sleeping bag and an everyday black bag tucked away in the corner.
Moriarty.
“Obviously to gain his trust. He told me his name, useless really.”
“You know you were right about them, you probably just asked to get me to say it,” admitted Lestrade as John rolled his eyes at Sherlock, who appeared to be drinking his coffee innocently, though he could tell that the detective was inwardly preening from making the accurate deduction. “Oliver and Kyle Izard were secretly married. Turns out that Oliver Martin’s parents weren’t keen on their only child’s sexual orientation,” answered the DI with a sigh. “He left the United States when he was eighteen. They’re flying in; I’m glad that I don’t have to deal with that.”
Lestrade muttered, “What the hell can we do then?”
“Sherlock-”
“Joseph Mollet is Sebastian Moran? Why didn’t you recognize him at the flat?”
Being as brilliant as she was, Mrs. Hudson didn’t say a word as response. At least she knew when to stop talking. If this had been with Sherlock, the git would chatter away. John trained the gun down the hallway, eyeing the upcoming door on their right. Mrs. Hudson’s hand dug into his shoulder when John reached for the doorknob. She, like him, was probably waiting for the attack when it opened.
John inched closer, maneuvering and pulling the detective underneath the covers to join him. John sighed when the warmth drifted underneath because of Sherlock’s body heat. He curled behind Sherlock, enjoying that his smaller frame could still hug around Sherlock, encircling his arm over Sherlock’s bare hip. John buried his face against that pale neck, savouring the wet curls and raw scent of sex on Sherlock’s skin. It was perfect except the stickiness in his pants. They would have to clean up soon but again, John couldn’t be bothered to move.
A/N: So? I'm mean to end the chapter there....until next time. Please kudos/bookmark/and-or comment on your way out. Ta.
“Exactly. Do come along, the lab is waiting.”
“JOHN!”
He walked into the sitting room, putting his set of keys and wallet into his pocket. Mrs. Hudson hovered in the doorway between the sitting room and the kitchen.
“Being hunted.” John quickly elaborated, and then he added, “What if you-”
John ignored Moran and glanced around. He hoped that the metal screech of protest that echoed in the quiet street wouldn’t attract any company. Any peering eyes or reports to the Met would go against the little time they had. As the criminal had said, they only had thirty minutes before Moriarty did something else. Whatever that was, it couldn’t be good. No, scratch that, it wouldn’t be, and John wasn’t really interested in finding out what it was. All he wanted to do, for now, was steal a car, put the first criminal in the boot, and get on the road to meet with the second criminal.
“You should consider yourself lucky that he didn’t kill you, dear,” she retorted as she tucked the gun into her pocket. “Considering what you put our poor Sherlock through.”
John nodded at Mrs. Hudson, completely ignoring her happy grin and wink before she departed through the open doorway. Her footsteps creaked the wooden stairs. John didn’t move until he heard the echo of a light door from downstairs. He briskly walked through the kitchen. Sherlock was still sitting at the table before his microscope. The only added difference- he was actually studying a slide.  John entered Sherlock’s bedroom, plucking his jumper from the detective’s bed, and pulled it over his head.
“Mixture?” John asked before it suddenly clicked in his head- “You can’t drug your brother,” he reprimanded with another sigh, knowing full well of Sherlock’s conspiring tone and being Sherlock’s drugged experiment more than once…apparently. “The whole government would fall if he blacked out for an entire Wednesday.”
“You want breakfast?”
“To answer both of your questions, I don’t know. I suspect I was a bit distracted with Mary’s disappearance, Moriarty’s potential reappearance-”
“Certainly trying,” grunted Sherlock breathlessly. Shuddering below, John sat up, moved his hands and held Sherlock’s arse, pulling them apart, whispering sweet nothings onto Sherlock’s chest while the taller man was taking John futher into his body.
The video angled around Hageman, briefly casting a caught shadow of the person behind the camera on the grey blotchy walls.
“Dangerous, Sherlock,” interceded John. He didn’t like it; his left hand twitched at his side. Something didn’t sit right in his gut. No other lower class criminals had ever demanded to speak with Sherlock before. They would only seem right pissed when he’s involved, and the usual threats were made.
John opened it. Then froze.
“Rebellious youth-… “ John mouthed quietly. That was something that he hadn’t known about his pub mate, a great piece of information to tease Greg with when he was good and pissed. “ Those car shows aren’t rubbish,” he argued back. Sherlock gave him a flat look, the one he has when a conversation isn’t going the way he wanted, John picked it up and sighed, “Alright, what have you figured out?”
“At the same time, John.”
“The previous two victims had shared one course in common on their college schedules. I determined that they met there, and then kindled their romantic relationship. There was reason to believe that the killer had had also attended the same course and started stalking them from there.”
John scoffed in disbelief, dragging his eyes from the exposed skin, back to Sherlock’s gray pair of eyes. “You mean, I’ll have to sit there and ‘draw’ you until you give the signal for me to tackle someone?”
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully, “Do go on then.”
Another buzz vibrated against his left leg, inside his pocket. Another chirp announced in the sitting room. “We both know how his last interaction went, how it ended, how do you think we’re going to fair this time? Semtex again? Trapped underground?”
A/N: And here we go... warns of torture- if you don't want to read those parts, find the words 'Merry Mollet' and read from there, you'll get the gist of what happened in the chapter. Please leave feedback if you wish. Happy Reading. Thank you to all those who left feedback- you're awesome. Thank you to my beta Whitehart for making this chapter shiny.
“Please spare me your standard bore of protest,” Sherlock countered with a wave of his hand. “There are many different definitions to describe one’s sexuality. You may not have found other men attractive, and your previous relationship with Sholto leaves the evidence that you do feel something. What? To what level of degree? I am uncertain because of the lack of data. I know that you’re attracted to me. I can reassure you that the attraction and fondness is mutual.”
His head bobbed on his shrugging shoulders. “I was called into the clinic. He was supposed to stay at the morgue. He’s not answering his mobile. He didn’t happen to come back, did he?”
John grinned in spite of himself. “All I meant was that you’re placing too much expectations on a dead man. That’s all. Back on the tarmac, you said he was dead, and you also said that you knew what he was going to do next. Is this it?”
“Now, what video did Lestrade send you?” asked Sherlock. He closed the remaining distance between them, his chin hooked over John’s shoulder, looking at the mobile, and where John’s thumb hovered over the play button.
“Out with it.”
‘Richard Brook’.
John glanced up from staring at the floor. “Could be a fake name,” John offered. “Jack the Ripper, you know? Instead of killing prostitutes, he murdered a stripper. Seems close enough.”
He stormed away from Mrs. Hudson, ignoring her spluttering questions from behind him as he flew back outside. John pulled his coat tighter. It had started to rain. He walked, rode in cabs for hours, looked in every spot he thought he might find Sherlock Holmes. Hoping that he wouldn’t find him dead. He huddled underneath an awning, soaking wet after his fruitless search. His phone vibrated in his pocket. John quickly answered it.
John sighed. “Best friend and flatmate.”
“Cookie monster?”
‘You’re being an idiot, John. I told you to stay there.’
(See the end of the chapter for
The suspect slumped towards the table, slack-jawed from the verbal punch that Sherlock delivered.
The detective shrugged. “Absolutely nothing. Pay the cabbie, John.”
John climbed out of the black car, peered down through the doorway, glowering at Mycroft. “Right. I’ll throw them out the flat window for you. Don’t trouble yourself coming up.”
“Do you notice that the longer this goes on, the more different their lives become from ours?”
“What?” Sherlock questioned, unsure why John was sad; he had meant it as a compliment. Unless… “Do you not
(here he hesitates at the sentimentality)
Sherlock sniffed, wet tracks dripping over his cheeks and nodded, “I’m not upset,” he explained, obviously bewildered.
“Hnnh,” Sherlock groaned, eyes fluttering closed, “Like electricity.”
Sherlock settles against the headboard of his bed and starts his DVD. He is amused to see this other version of himself sitting in the same location.
“Oh, you really shouldn’t have done that,” Holmes admonishes Watson.
did it, as well.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock whispered, “You...truly
Sherlock’s brow furrows as he calms down fairly quick. He seems to be reliving snippets of the nightmare before his entire being sags further in to the sofa tiredly.
There’s a recapitulation, just as though it were a real airing TV show that had to wait a length of time for this to come back and not stalker footage. They face off with the vest and gun, then Moriarty’s
“John! John, I’m doing it! I’m having one!” Sherlock screamed, hands turning into talons as his hips bucked once, twice, and then John’s hand was covered in hot, wet semen as Sherlock came with a choked off scream and a huffed breath. The embers of his internal volcano sparked into a full eruption.
“If this really is stalker evidence in a case, that would imply that all of this footage is real, not acted,” Holmes says with a crease to his brow, signifying that he’s attempting to figure out a puzzle.
Sherlock bites his lower lip as his eyes fall back to where they’re connected. He moves his arm away from John’s touch slowly before gently, with a quivering hand he would never admit to, lowering his left hand to John’s right. He startles slightly as John releases a content hum and moves a bit closer, somehow finding a way to intertwine their fingers in a way that isn’t entirely uncomfortable.
He finds Sherlock in his bed, on his right side facing the door. He isn’t asleep, but he also doesn’t acknowledge John’s return to the room. After a short debate, John grabs two extra blankets from his trunk, setting one on the ground before sitting with his back against the wall and the other overtop himself for warmth. In the dull light, the two stare at each other across the void.
Sherlock’s brain races to keep up. He
Then Sherlock is angry at himself for allowing John to even marry and impregnate this woman at all. It’s not the first time he’s cursed himself for allowing the situation to play out as it did, but it’s more intense now somehow.
“Even now?” He sounds honestly a bit hurt by the thought that Watson wouldn’t understand his methods by now.
They stare intently in to each other’s eyes, as if trying to read the other’s very soul, before they’re broken from their trance by the words “You may now kiss the bride” followed by raucous clapping from the crowd. They join the clapping merely on instinct.
Mrs. Hudson still think that?”
Suddenly there’s a hand below his chin, gently guiding his eyes back to John’s. There are no words exchanged, just John showing him the love that he has felt for ages and Sherlock struggling not only to process it, but to believe it, as well.
John escorts Henry back to his house to get him settled while Sherlock makes his way back to their inn. John later finds him sitting near a fire in a dining area where they discuss what just happened. Problem is, Sherlock is freaking out too much to really be making any sense to John, and he pushes him away with his attitude and belittling.
done it, though, the person who’s done it takes a drink.”
“I’m sorry, but,” he chuckles again, smile holding strong, “did you just say you think that watching these DVDs would mess with the space-time continuum?” He finishes, looking as though nothing in the world has ever been funnier to him.
I'm a West Wing fan, which is where I got Anthea's alias from. I apologize for nothing.
“Stockholm Syndrome?” He tries to claim with a smile.
“Yeah,” Lestrade nods, “I wanted to see it for myself, it sounded so unbelievable.”
I smiled.
“Do we...talk about it?” Sherlock asks nebulously.
“It’s about time! I’m dehydrating over here!” Bill needles, grabbing one of the drinks from Sherlock’s hand and gulping a third of it down in one go.
Instead of fighting further, John pulls back the blankets on his side of the bed (he has
John’s strong hands reached out and grabbed his upper arms reflexively, stopping the lanky man from gracelessly falling and probably breaking something. In pulling him back onto solid ground, however, John had inadvertently brought their bodies flush together. Sherlock’s still very present erection pushed into John’s lower belly, causing Sherlock to release a low moan that caught them both off guard.
“Oh, right, clearly,” Watson stresses sarcastically, “Why were they sharing plates of food? If I remember correctly, you barely ate on this trip at all, as per usual.”
John smiled warmly, placing a gentle kiss to the lobe of Sherlock’s ear without thinking. Sherlock’s eyes opened and his head turned, catching John’s gaze and holding it with a shocked expression as though that small kiss was the catalyst for his undoing.
“It’s a compliment, you know,” he admits quietly, referring to his and Sherlock’s assumptions that John Watson is following along on the same page.
Instead, Sherlock brought his face slowly toward John’s - deducing the entire way - and kissed him softly, tentatively, as if unsure. Sherlock being unsure about something, can you imagine?
“The vest,” is Holmes’ quiet response.
to keep them?” Holmes asks irritably, “They are unsettling.”
John’s eyes harden and Sherlock exhales deeply through his nose, not wanting to give in to the pull to submit to this man; doesn’t want to admit his thought process that will surely bring John guilt.
“But we
for this,” he says as he hands them a bottle of what appears to be an expensive champagne.
“God, even kissing?” John asked in wonder, questioning the fates about how he became this lucky.
Sherlock gets the requested information from his homeless network and they go traipsing off after the Golem, nearly catching him. Then the scene switches to the planetarium where a woman is controlling a program on Jupiter and the other planets.
I have well and truly lost you now, and I have no earthly idea how the hell I’m supposed to cope with that.
“You’re right, sometimes it’s not, but that doesn’t make it any less worth doing.”
Both coins have a considerable weight to them.
A shudder passes through Watson at the slimy move and Holmes makes a face of disgust, the feelings of mirth from before completely washed away.
You didn’t care to hear that I had pretended to die to save you; that I had endured countless inconceivable terrors to keep you safe. So when I returned just in time to witness you become engaged to some…some
John debates how to reassure him that he’s not being rejected without actually confessing his feelings. It’s difficult, “Because I want you to be you.”
With that ominous thought in place, Watson puts the first DVD in the player and they settle in for an experience they are not nearly prepared for.
“No. I’m not going to...do that,” John sighed, exasperated, “I thought perhaps I would stroke your nipples?”
Sherlock looks down at both coins again and takes in their differences, deducing quickly through the slight fuzz of alcohol, “You carry this one often, amongst other things in your pocket,” he motions with the Armed Forces coin.
The Inspector looked nervously between the pair of us, just briefly, before swallowing hard and continuing, “They were found near a Turkish Bath. There was a green carnation in each man’s lapel.”
stag party,” Watson muses, clearly entertained.
“You’ve been misinformed,” John smiled, stroking a hand through Sherlock’s curls before stretching up to kiss him again, “and wanting it properly doesn’t make you a needy princess."
