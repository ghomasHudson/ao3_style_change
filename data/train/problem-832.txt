How many people actually knew the truth of his birth? Everyone but him? And felt his heart begin to break into a million pieces.
He’d just asked for the bottle at this point which the bartender dutifully brought over with a worried frown.
“I know something else that you don’t know,” Sherlock said, throwing out what he hoped was the perfect bait.
“Sometimes for all of us, love. Actually, most times for me.” Mycroft turned to address Sherlock, resplendent in a black tux, his hair still an unruly mass of curls.
“I don’t know…wait! I have it. Walk into the hallway, naked, and yell ‘I’m Sherlock Holmes and I love sex!’ How’s your willpower now? Hmm?” John asked.
“Come over here and I’ll tell you all about it.” John said, sitting on the bed and patting the mattress.
“Don’t be ridiculous. With the amount of overtime you put in? I’d be surprised if someone didn’t drag you out of here kicking and screaming just to force you take a break and do something different for a change.”
Irene put her hand over the mobile and spoke to whom Mycroft assumed was Becca. He couldn’t quite make it out but he swore he heard subdued laughter in the background.
Removing his fingers, John sat back and gave his once again hard cock, a few strokes with his lubed hand, and groaned.
“I think we should. And if the state of my trousers are anything to go by, we should make haste.” They began walking to the fire escape, arm in arm when Sherlock suddenly stopped, jogged back, looked at the red dahlia’s and regretfully snapped one off and handed it to John.
“A dossier on Doctor Watson? I’ve known all of this for quite a while,” Sherlock said dismissively, trying to keep the disappointment from his voice.
Pulling John closer with his right leg, Sherlock began rubbing his cock against John’s. John, who was beyond excited at this point, removed his fingers from Sherlock’s arse, added more lube to his hand and coated his cock liberally.
Sebastian had finished up by drawing blood directly from the Port using a large needle and pronounced the procedure a ‘success.’ He flushed the Port with a saline solution followed by heparin to keep the blood from clotting in the catheter, then calmly walked to the sink and began clean up.
“So I kept practicing until I was able to achieve the same result with ease. I’d had a very successful day and had been waiting for you to come home to share in the celebration.”
Sebastian gave the prearranged system of knocks letting Jim know that he was coming in. Unlocking the door, he turned his back against it to push it open so that he wouldn’t have to put his bags down first.
Staring pointedly at the script, Sherlock said brusquely, “I don’t know. It depends on how this bloody script ends.”
“So what am I supposed to apologize for? It’d better be good, I have another case I’m also working on…for you, as it happens, Gerard.” Sherlock said as he pulled out a chair and sat down - on the edge of his seat, John noticed. As if he was prepared to leave at any moment.
John kissed Sherlock’s temple and led him to to door. It closed with a soft snick behind them as they trudged up the 17 steps their flat. Once inside the door, John led Sherlock to his chair and had him sit. He could tell that there was a good chance that Sherlock would hyperventilate and he wouldn’t be able to stop it this time.
“We’ll let you out right here and they’ll never know the difference, will they? They both seem unnaturally obsessed with the roof today.” Sherlock said as he pulled the playing card out and watched the bee fly immediately upwards. Just then a breeze blew the scent of flowers to his nose and so he followed it and the bee…to the roof.
It’s not as if he were the murderer after all. But if there was an intriguing crime, what was the harm in expressing interest and enjoyment in the aftermath? It was already done, after all. He really didn’t see what the problem was but he tried to keep his excitement to himself, often with little success.
“Oh Jaaaack! Jack!” Moriarty bent down and yelled in John’s ear startling him into slowly opening his eyes again.
“Yes, Lestrade. That’s what I said. The butler did it. How should I know. Your lot identified the body. The master of the house obviously said one insulting thing too many and the butler snapped. Use your brain. The weapon is an ice pick which I’m sure a well trained butler would have cleaned and placed it back from whence it came. No. No paperwork. Why not? I gave you the murderer. The murder weapon. The reason for the murder. Time for you to do some of the work yourself.” Sherlock disconnected the call.
John heard the outer doors to the autopsy room open and before the secondary doors had been cracked more than an inch said;
“Safe word, Sherlock. What’s wrong? Afraid you’ll lose? Don’t be nervous. It won’t hurt. Much,” John taunted.
“Your mother didn’t want you but your grandmother did so they - your grandmother - determined that the best way to handle this ‘born above the blankets’ scandal was to falsify the names of your parents on your birth certificate. Although if it had been up to your grandfather, you would have been given up for adoption. And had it been up to Harriet, you wouldn’t be here at all. Are we clear so far?”
“You…you know about that? That was none of your bloody business! That was for me to tell someone not for someone to dig through my personnel files and pick and chose my attributes as if I was a menu item!”
Although your invitation to tea is very tempting, I’m afraid that you’re correct in your deduction that I’m too busy at my new job to take a break. As it is, I haven’t had lunch yet and it’s already 4pm. Maybe some other time?
“Make me come. I want to come in your mouth. Please let me come in your mouth!” Sherlock yelled, putting his hands on John’s head, forcing him to take Sherlock’s cock deeper.
“Can’t. Too much to do because of the long weekend.” John bent over in pain. It felt as if someone was stabbing him in the chest and he felt as if he might be about to pass out.
“I know. I know. I’m not going to let him bleed out. I just wanted to get some clean blood closer to his heart. I mean, honestly, you have no idea how nasty this stuff is. It’s almost enough to put me off drinking Dhamphir blood completely,” Moriarty said with a laugh.
Because the position had been open for so long they’d ignored the fact that John was over qualified for the job. Normally, they’d never hire anyone they thought might get bored and look for another job somewhere else almost immediately but in a case of serendipity, the hospital was desperate for a coroner - they’d had to send bodies for autopsies to the nearest hospital which was not only embarrassing, but didn’t allow them access to any of the process at all. They had to rely on the good graces and availability of the other hospital’s coroner, an arrangement that had soon become untenable.
“Not tonight, Sherlock. I just want to go to sleep. It’ll keep until the morning, yeah?” John asked hopefully.
“Speak of the devil and he shall appear.” Sherlock said, reaching over to grab his mobile from the nightstand.
“John, no!” Sherlock reached out to grab John’s arm but he’d only touched air. He just put his head down and reluctantly followed him.
Seb just nodded in agreement. He didn’t understand Jim’s fascination with the Dhamphir but he worked for Jim and it wasn’t his job to understand the bosses’ reasons for anything he did and he knew better than to question him.
“Hey. Look at it this way; now you know that you hate espresso and it didn’t cost you anything to find out,” Sebastian smiled, taking another huge gulp of his coffee.
“God. What? Just tell me. I can’t deduce by looking at you which thing I’ve said that’s irritated you this time. So?”
“You were fortunate that your uterus was able to removed without abdominal surgery,” the doctor assured John warmly.
“It never has been for me. It’s usually been more like a task. Must be a benefit of being Soul Mates.”
“No sense struggling, John. You’re well and truly caught. Don’t worry, you’ll be asleep soon and won’t even know that you’re in there. Next time you wake up, you’ll already be at our destination.” Sebastian zipped John up until he’d reached the Port.
“But Harriet will be expecting the baby to be returned to her. She might become upset if she doesn’t see him right away,” Elizabeth said anxiously.
“Yes but they’re not exactly monogamous. Think of it as having a spouse and concubines although that’s not really apt because the concubines aren’t particularly monogamous either,” Sherlock said, bothered by not having a more concrete definition immediately to hand.
“Time to make a call,” Sebastian said, pulling his mobile from his back pocket. He pressed a number that he hated to use but used it often enough to have it on speed dial and let it ring.
“So we’re just supposed to show up with this new baby having never mentioned that you were expecting? How’s that supposed to work?” Bob asked skeptically.
Sliding his middle and index fingers through the lube, John eased them into Sherlock and began massaging his prostate again.
“No. No. But there’s a first time for everything. An antacid wouldn’t go amiss right about now but everything’s closed.”
“That’s fine, Jim. Here we go. Let’s get you out of those filthy clothes and put you to bed.” Sebastian said, hurriedly stripping Jim down to his pants and tucking him in.
“The great thing about a Port is that you can use a needle to inject something directly into it or you can plug in an IV when a continuous flow is needed. These things are great.
“I’d like to remove the Velcro from your thighs and ankles so that I can reach all of your wonderful nooks and crannies.” John asked, popping the cap on the lube with his thumb and applying it liberally to his fingers. Putting the lube down, he asked again,
“Don’t be condescending just because I’ve never heard of any of this stuff before,” John said, annoyed.
“What is this, some kind of reunion?” Moran opened the door to see three people dressed in black who were clearly government agents.
“Now that we know that Doctor Watson will be on his own tomorrow night, we can put my plan into action. The first thing you’re going to do is…
“Is this a trick to see how long I’m willing to stare at your hard cock because I’m not impressed. Already seen it. A LOT.”
“Oops. Sorry. Here, help me stand you up so that I can sit you on the bed. We’re going to end up there anyway.” John laughed.
“Yes. We’ve found him. His name is Sebastian Moran and he works in facilities and handles mopping floors, emptying the hazardous waste, ensuring that areas are sterile.”
“Don’t you want to know what killed him? Aren’t you the least bit curious? That was quite the message, wasn’t it? And left out in the open where people could see. A warning, perhaps? Hmmm?”
“I’ll handle Irene. Well? What will it be? You don’t need the money. You can leave this job at any time. John Watson, will you be my roommate?”
“Alright.” John walked around the bed and got in on the other side. Sherlock immediately slid over and attached himself to John’s side like a limpet.
“You laid hands on John first. And let’s not forget why that happened. You were attempting to attack Sherlock and although I don’t think that you would have faired any better had you reached him, I’d think that you would have realized by now that anyone who tries to hurt Sherlock is going to have to go through John first. Sherlock’s only likely to stop you, no more, no less, but piss off John? Well, let’s just say that his self-control right now is pretty impressive given how angry he is at the moment.”
“That’s it. I’ve heard enough of this bullshit. I’m leaving now. Never contact me again,” John said, turning to get his coat and leave.
“It’s ok. I’ll take it slow, go in, lower the table and lay down while you go on that reconnaissance mission,” John said, trying to laugh.
“Great. Just great. What have I gotten myself into.” John said under his breath as Sherlock entered the room damp flannel in hand.
“Good job, man. Now that the police are here, it’s best that you both go inside and make sure that your customers haven’t gotten into your top shelf liquors,” Lestrade joked.
“I don’t want anything else. Just consider this a break.” Sherlock said nervously, still holding Watson’s wrist.
The woman currently being wheeled into the Maternity Ward was screaming so loudly that visitors and nurses were stepping out into the hallway to investigate.
“That’s alright. Just don’t let it happen again. No hard feelings?” John held his hand out but Anderson just kept his hands in his pocket.
“Doctor Watson wouldn’t hurt a fly but he’s very good at defending himself if necessary. I had no doubt that things would go his way.”
‘Well, she’ll be gone for hours,’ Sherlock thought, getting gingerly on his hands and knees to retrieve his prize. As he began to stand up, he felt a sharp stabbing pain in his back and decided that he should probably see what that was about and then he could open a window in the living room and smoke to his heart’s content.
"Would you mind putting those on the kitchen table, Mrs Hudson?" John asked without a pause in fingering Sherlock.
“It’ll take as long as it takes, Sherlock. I have nowhere to be today and I’m relaxing. Go find something to do with yourself.” John went back to reading his paper.
John felt Sherlock’s tongue slowly glide along his main artery again and leaned his head back to allow better access.
Wrapping his arm around John, he pulled him close as John nestled into the space that had been created between Sherlock’s bicep and chest.
“There. You did it again!” John suspected that he might be a little slap happy at this point. He was dead on his feet, arguing with Sherlock about cock puns. He started to leave but pivoted on his heel immediately.
But this case? Every new detail would cause him to reevaluate the data which was something that hadn’t happened in…had that ever happened? He didn’t think so. Was it possible that this case would turn out to be a ten? Impossible.
He slid between the cool sheets and duvet, rocked his head back and forth on his pillow a bit to make a nice dent for his head, closed his eyes and went to sleep - for approximately 15 minutes -and now he was wide awake and worrying.
John stood fully naked in the doorway admiring Sherlock for a few minutes. He was such a beautiful man and John felt lucky that they’d found each other. He loved Sherlock with all his heart. He shook himself. No time for that now. He was working!
“I’m a high level, quirky business man and that’s no longer even remotely considered odd anymore,” he laughed.
“Are you paying attention?” John asked, seeking out and unerringly finding Sherlock’s prostate. He brushed lightly against it. One time. Two times. On the third time, he removed his fingers completely and waiting.
“I don’t care! Anderson, go through the house and see if you can discover any other evidence related to this murder,” Lestrade said.
“As you can see, I am NOT drunk and you’re not carrying me anywhere. In fact, it’d be in your best interest not to touch me. You’ve had your warning, if you ignore it, I won’t be responsible for the consequences,” John said, gulping down another glass of scotch only to immediately pour another one.
“Wouldn’t do you any good if you did. I’m just the messenger girl. The Mistress knows but she knows everything,” Becca sighed.
“Fine but I want to know what’s going to happen as soon as its been decided. I should have a say. This affects my life too!”
“Thank god for expensive robes and underweight detectives. I wouldn’t have been able to do this to anyone else. And you didn’t even fight back,” John said, pulling Sherlock back by the hair and baring his lovely pale neck.
“Almost time to wake up, John. So far so good.” Moran said as he double checked the restraints holding John’s wrists and ankles to the table. Patting John on the shoulder one more time, he left the room, letting the door shut slowly behind him.
“I don’t think that’s viscous enough, John,” Sherlock said primly while obediently kneeling on his chair.
“We haven’t started the game yet. Once we start, anything you say, other than your safe word, will be ignored. I will beat you, Sherlock.”
“Well, if my people couldn’t find anything and the great Sherlock Holmes couldn’t find anything either, it’s obvious that John was taken from a blind spot in the camera coverage.”
John also liked the man himself. He usually came in to clean up hazardous waste from the lab and the morgue every night around 11:00pm. He always brought a cup of coffee for John and himself and so long as John had the time, stayed to chat until only the dregs in the bottom of their cups remained.
Two exhausted and bloody men sat on the floor leaning against the wall. Both smiling. Both content. John stood up, back aching, and walked into the exam room coming back with paper towels dampened with warm water.
Mrs Hudson had been listening from the slamming doors until two hours later when she knew for certain that she needed to intervene before there was nothing remaining of the flat that could be salvaged.
She wrote a note and left it on top of the treats then she withdrew as silently as she’d come, this time not bothering with opening any doors.
“Please. Please, John. Fuck me up the arse. Be as brutal as you want. I want it. I need it.” Sherlock gasped.
“You’d think that with almost seven percent of the people living in London originating from India, not including Brits of Indian decent, and an Indian restaurant on nearly every corner, Anderson might have learned a bit about the culture,” Sherlock opined.
No. Having a reputation as being someone who’s able to keep secrets combined with amazing skills in the bedroom is a bit more lucrative.”
“You two idiots have just about killed this man. If his pulse was any slower, he’d be going back in time which would be better than what you two numbskulls have been doing ‘taking care’ of him. No. Just. Don’t say anything. My car’s right out in front, the perks of parking in London after six. Go down and fetch me the machine that warms blood. Unless you’ve left the blood out on the counter? I wouldn’t put it past you, Moron,” Becca said looking at Sebastian seriously.
“In the beginning, there were only vampires, no Dhamphirs. Touching a human other than for drinking blood was considered not only disgusting but taboo.”
John stood up with a sigh and shouldered his carry all looking like he had the weight of the world on his back. Pushing the bar to exit the morgue, John noticed the man from the hazmat department pushing his cart down the hall, red bags almost completely full, and gave him a nod.
Throwing himself onto the sofa and covering his eyes dramatically with the back of his forearm, Sherlock replied, “But that’s so far away! And, look!” Sherlock tugged at what he was wearing. “I can hardly go out dressed like this now, can I?”
“Ok. Go! Go! Go!” John started pushing men ahead of him towards the helicopter where the gunners were laying down suppressive fire against the insurgents so that the men could get on board as safely and quickly as possible.
“Why would I name my penis?” Sherlock asked, pausing the motion of both hands, awaiting John’s response.
No. It would have only drawn negative attention to Irene’s business and cost people their jobs. The wrong people would get hurt - again. I pushed my anger down deep and carried on, business as usual. I’d taken care of the staff; no one was getting hurt anymore; I thought I could ignore what had been done. Well, not ignore it but…try not to dwell on it. That didn’t last long.”
John continued holding Sherlock’s hands tightly against the bed and rubbed their cocks together until they were both close.
“One told me that I was lucky that I was so amazing at sucking cock, otherwise I’d be sporting the same bruises as the others. Then they started telling me about the homeless men they’d begun beating for “fun.” After all, “who cared what happened to the homeless?”
“Then why are you asking me something to which you already know the answer?” Mycroft asked, sounding a bit condescending.
Once John’s back brushed up against the wall, he turned Sherlock so that they switched places. Sherlock leaned against the wall.
John sat on the bed next to Sherlock’s thighs and began organizing the few items in front of him. Reaching over for the gloves, he slowly drew each one on in a distinctly lascivious manner.
“John, you say that in every story so could we please skip all the angst and breast beating that we normally have to go through while I wait for you to realize that we really are meant to be together?”
“Why? Because you’re delicious, Doctor Watson, and my Seb here was kind enough to bring me some Dhamphir carryout. I just love him to pieces!” Moriarty said, suddenly appearing at John’s head.
John was so turned on that when he went to grab Sherlock’s arse with his left hand, he found that he still had ahold of the packet of lube.
“Fine. Your gonna have to untie me first to get my trousers off,” Sherlock said trying to look innocent.
“Da. John’s pregnant and mum wants him to keep it so you can see that he won’t be leaving home anytime soon.”
“A Dhamphir is half human, half vampire but without all of the pesky weaknesses of either. This only happens when a male vampire has sex with a female human and any baby resulting from such a union is a Dhamphir,” Sherlock said seriously.
“Thank you, Irene,” they both said simultaneously. They laughed, breaking the tension that first meetings of such a delicate nature seem to entail.
“Isn’t that convenient. I’m assuming that the man was already dead and that, ‘Mister’ Watson, didn’t wait until he could become a “patient” of his?” Sherlock sneered.
“It was a combination drug. You haven’t noticed that you’re been becoming more and more tired?” John asked.
And before you say it, I’m not begging off dinner which would be lovely spent with you but I find that I’m anxiously awaiting dinner in your company.
“I don’t…this is all that’s left. Possessions that now mean nothing. Who’s going to want all of this stuff? It’s all just going to get thrown away. Everything she collected through the years. Everything she loved. All wasted.” Sherlock’s breath caught and held, it came out in a whoosh only to be sucked quickly back in. He was on the verge of hyperventilating. John needed to stop this before it got out of control.
“Oh, John tried to take Lawrence’s toy away. John pushed him. John made fun of him. Lawrence was just defending himself.”
“You’re being ridiculous. You’re only slightly over two meters tall. I think you’d notice it had I been cutting you from head to toe.”
‘This is crazy. This is crazy,’ John thought. ‘I’m about to agree to go home with a madman living in a fantasy world.’
“Just giving you a demonstration of one way to cause trigger finger. Hurts, doesn’t it?” John said, sitting back on his haunches and grinning.
“What did I just say? Try to control yourself and just sit there and be patient. You can ask all the questions that I’m willing to answer as soon as I’ve finished speaking. Just nod your head if you agree.”
“You cheated!” Sherlock yelled, trying to buck John off of his back while simultaneously working on escaping the Velcro.
“I was going to fight fair and square but you had to go and cheat,” John said, forcing first one arm and then the other behind Sherlock’s back strapping him tightly. Turning, he straddled Sherlock’s waist, quickly immobilizing his thighs followed immediately by his ankles.
“Don’t you dare hit ‘send’, we’re already here anyhow. Put that damned thing away.” Greg said, annoyed, but secretly amused.
Sherlock had obviously walked the perimeter of the apiary several times and now he was touching all the plants and saying their botanical names beneath his breath.
“I play the violin at all hours of the day and night, don’t speak for days, and perform experiments in the flat.”
Jim had been in a good mood for quite awhile which was unusual. Moran knew that it was due to the addictive properties of John’s blood. It was keeping him happy for a lot longer than was usual but Sebastian didn’t want to see what happened once Jim drained John dry. At least not before he could hunt down another Dhamphir - John wasn’t going to last much longer. They weren’t feeding him and fluids weren’t going to do anything to replace his blood, especially at the rate Jim had been draining John.
"Just...oh...a little...that's nice...warning would be good the next time," Sherlock said halfheartedly, ending on a sigh.
“Thanks, guys,” John said. He knew these two and, as with everyone else, had a good relationship with them. Outwardly, John seemed to be an easy going man who laughed easily and often. However, inside was a completely different story. He hid his anger behind the facade of being a content man when he was anything but.
“Good lord! You don’t think that they’d…? In a public place?! What do you think they were doing up there?” Lestrade asked, cheeks reddening.
Sherlock stood impatiently waiting for John’s shift to end. The shift was supposed to be over at midnight and wasn’t John the boss? It usually took John approximately 23 minutes to finish his paper work and another seven minutes to pack up and leave. This could vary by as much as 30 minutes, the unpredictability of which Sherlock found exceedingly irritating.
John could feel his heart beating a mile a minute. It felt like it was doing summersaults in there. He put a hand to his chest, looking a little pained.
“Sherlock. You have at least a third of a meter of wood embedded in your back in one long piece. It will have to be cut out which means inevitable bleeding. Probably not a lot but better safe than sorry. Besides, I happen to like those sheets. Now go.”
“No. You need rest and liquids if you’re going to get better. Here,” John said, handing Sherlock two paracetamol and a glass of cold water.
“I’m in a hurry. What’s it to you? You’re not my father,” John said, then paused to take a closer look at Sherlock.
“Ugh. Why do you always bore me with facts, Seb? You’re right, of course. Jack’s just so delicious that I temporarily lost sight of the goal. It was so good of you to remind me.” Moriarty said, smiling sweetly at Sebastian.
“He realized that the genius had most definitely noticed the man and so too fell in love. Everyone could see that they loved each other, except for the two of them, that is. They were so intent on hiding their own feelings to realize that their love was fully requited,” Sherlock said, turning to look at John.
“”Catch any blood?!” Just how much blood would make a towel necessary?” Sherlock asked, holding up said towel.
“Right. Sorry. Just let me get my badge…” Lestrade checked his pockets in his jacket and trousers - nothing.
“Vampires have to work for a living to you know. It’s not like we’re out there robbing everyone as a way to pay the bills. John’s a great guy. He didn’t seem bothered at all by the fact that I was a vampire. Never even mentioned it. He’s not a racist, unlike the rest of you Dhamphirs.” Moran huffed.
They were more than content with their opponent and god forbid they should team up for a joint attack against someone else. Many a person had been left feeling traumatized and emotionally beaten afterwards. The brothers enjoyed those times most of all and it was one of the rare occasions when you could find them smiling at the same time.
“That procedure’s rarely performed anymore, if at all. Now, if you’ll give a few strong pushes, the baby will be out and the pain will be over. Ready? Now push.”
Sherlock stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder, “I wouldn’t bother. By the time you get there, it’ll be over.”
“You’re repeating yourself a lot today, dear,” Mrs Hudson said. Sherlock gave her a cutting look which did absolutely nothing to dull the twinkle in her eye.
“Well, green represents nature and new beginnings. And being murdered is definitely a new beginning,” Sherlock said.
“You didn’t say anything about my hair. Come to think of it, you didn’t mention anything other than a black tie so really, I’m over dressed.” Sherlock said, beginning to unbutton his shirt causing John to give an inelegant snort beside him.
This feels like sloppy writing. I'm rushing myself because I'm impatient for John Sherlock to meet. Don't you just hate impatient people?
“Well…I’m not so sure and as much as I am loathe to admit it; Mycroft is better at these sorts of things than I. Could you please go with him? For me?”
“Follow me.” The doctor lead Mrs Watson through the double doors and into the recovery room. He opened the curtains to where John lay, asleep but frowning as if he was worrying even then.
"Why indeed. Ooh," Sherlock said on a sigh. I had reached around, and grasping his silk robe, wrapped it around his cock and began rubbing it up and down his cock. It felt deliciously sinful, so much silky material covering such a firm cock.
The bartender sat Harriet’s pint in front of her and she took a big gulp wiping the foam off of her lips with the back of her hand and began to speak…
He was dressed in casual clothes. Sherlock was surprised. He hadn’t expected the door to be answered by a man wearing a satin robe - Doctor Watson was aware that this was to be an interview about the crimes, after all - but he hadn’t expected him to be dressed as if he was headed for a walk in the park either.
“Too distracting? Are you incapable of doing your job because my plump arse - which happens to be your favorite part of me - is on full display?” Sherlock said, lifting his head to meet John’s eyes.
“We’re old friends. He’s just excessively inebriated which I’m sure the police would like to address with you first,” Sherlock said, calmly yet threateningly.
“Have you seen the waterfall yet, Gregory? I hear it’s lovely from the other side. Let’s go up and enjoy the view.” Mycroft took Lestrade’s arm and headed towards the grand staircase.
“Ah. There he is. And about time too.” Sherlock said softly to himself, watching as John exited through the glass doors of St Bart’s and paused, looking around him. Sherlock had been about to go in and find out for himself what was keeping him and he knew that might have been a mistake. He congratulated himself once again on his patience.
“Fine but I’m only doing this to humor you. I’m wide awake but I’ll lay with you until you’ve gone to sleep then get back up.”
“Actually, no. Finally down to six empty drawers out of 10,” John said happily and feeling a bit ghoulish because of it.
“Uh oh, wrong reaction,” Becca said and reached over to let a little more of the drug flow into Sherlock who slowly began to blink.
"Fine. I'll just leave these over here. I'm sure you'll be hungry afterwards," Mrs Hudson said, walking into the room and setting the plate down on the coffee table next to where Sherlock's head now hung. He was panting desperately, sweat causing his curls to arrange themselves in adorable patterns on his forehead.
John hadn’t seen him in two days, and had been enjoying Sherlock’s quiet sulk when suddenly; eggs. No apologies. No greeting. He’d just launched into that hard boiled egg nonsense. Sherlock was up to something. He was playing one of his bait and switch games where he suggested the most ridiculous thing that he could think of and then acted as if he’d given in to John and “settled” for asking him to do whatever crazy thing it was that he’d wanted in the beginning. The goal being that the first thing was so outrageous that the real request seemed reasonable in comparison.
“That’s the only thing that’s soft,” John said with a grin before pulling Sherlock even closer for a more passionate kiss, entwining his tongue with Sherlock’s.
“How long has it been since someone touched you like this?” John began slowly stroking Sherlock’s cock.
“Self-righteous know it all? Pompous arse? Man with a superiority complex? Bet you’ve heard that one before.” John rocked back on his heels.
“It’s hardly ‘nothing’ Sherlock,” John said, pointing at his stiff cock with a smile and a come hither glance.
Of course I’m not literally counting the moments. That would be obsessive, which I’m not. It’s just a figure of speech, much like wearing bells.
“You know you don’t mean that,” Sebastian said and deeming the blood warm enough for the first go round, hung the bag on the IV stand and connected it to one of the lines currently feeding John. He then went over and did the same thing on the other arm, hooking up the saline and setting both IVs to drip full tilt.
Sherlock leaped from the bed and was immediately hit by a sudden wave of dizziness. He clutched at John.
“Spare me your romantic notions. Just tell me; do I need to call someone else or can I count on you to help?”
***Oh. And the usual warning of not beta'd, alpha'd or brit picked. What? You were expecting something different? I'll edit later. Trust me. :D
He dialed her number and waited, anxious to get her side of the story. Of course it wasn’t true but…maybe some of it was? He’d seen the way his father had touched his sister when he thought no one was looking. A quick touch of her breasts when he was walking by. Dad trying to hold Harriet’s hand and her shaking him off. Harriet never wanting to be alone with him. John had thought that it was because their father had become a violent alcoholic. But what if even a part of this was true. He had to know.
“He’s in recovery right now and not really up to visitors. He’s also on a lot of pain killers. You could come back tonight or tomorrow during visiting hours.”
“Don’t you want to have sex? Don’t I smell good to you?” Sherlock pressed John against the door and slid his hard cock against John’s equally hard cock.
“Quiet, Harriet. Catholics don’t have abortions! What would the neighbors think? What would the family think? We’d be ostracized!”
John’s mother and father made a very rare and reluctant, visit to his school. He didn’t know or care what had happened; the beatings at school had stopped immediately afterwards and that was one less daily beating to take.
“You’ll keep going until you’re ready to stop. I can hasten that by properly begging you to stop,” Sherlock said, a hiccup in his voice as if he was trying to stifle a sob.
Taking a look at John, Sherlock said, “Raincheck? I won’t fight a defenseless man,” Sherlock finished.
“Jim,” Sebastian called out as he walked into the living room. Right away he noticed that John was completely slumped in his chair and was the color of chalk but Jim was nowhere to be seen.
John placed his lips around Sherlock’s cock head and barely had a chance to take a breath before Sherlock’s hands were in his hair, forcing his cock inside John’s mouth so deeply that his nose pressed against Sherlock’s pubic bone and John loved it.
“Which is just as well because you’ve winnowed my staff down to just one man who is willing to fulfill your fantasy. Actually, he’s looking forward to it.”
“Open your eyes. What’s wrong with your voice?” Moran asked then noticed that Moriarty had John’s main line in his mouth, seemingly stuck to his tongue via suction.
“It’s business. He’ll get over it. As if I’d let John die. My precious Sherlock’s heart couldn’t stand it!”
“I know you don’t think I’ll let you stick me with that,” Sherlock said, backing up until his legs hit the back of his chair.
“Let me stop you right there. There’s absolutely nothing for me here. I’m not wanted at home and I don’t want to be there either. And the last thing I need is to worry about my scholarship being cut off at a moment’s notice…”
“What about tunnels? Many hospitals have underground tunnels that they use to transport patients to and from surgery so that they’re out view of the public.” Sherlock asked desperately.
“As is your right. Oh. By the way. There was a rather large boot print on John’s abdomen directly above his pelvic bone. You wouldn’t happen to know how that got there, would you? I mean, that coupled with him falling down the stairs….people might say that it’s parental abuse…” The doctor looked at Watson giving him time to figure it out.
“No sir. I won’t,” Sebastian said and hurried from the room before Jim decided that he wanted dessert too.
“Yeah, a darning needle through the tongue isn’t something I’m likely to forget any time in the near future.”
“Of course. Anything for you, Jim. You know that.” Moran said, a look of pure adoration on his face as he gazed at Moriarty.
Yep. Pompous arse. John had learned the hard way not to be a very trusting person when he met someone new and said;
John couldn’t understand why no one could see the truth. Mummy was always distracted, she worked as a maid six days a week and didn’t have time for him. Although he did notice that she had time for Lawrence.
He found a small bedsit that he could barely afford on his pension and stared at his gun all day which had conveniently been sent back with him. Probably a friend had stashed it for him for which he was grateful.
“I’m not going to go out of my way to make this unpleasant. The script doesn’t specify that so, lucky you, yeah?” John said, a smile clear in his voice.
“You’re asking why I didn’t call the police? And complain that some trust fund babies were beating up prostitutes? Yeah. I don’t think that would have been a very popular decision. The majority of our clients run in the same crowd and wouldn’t like their ‘secret’ getting out. They’d call their friends and have those pesky little charges dropped within the hour, if they were charged at all. Not one of those guys would have spent a night in jail much less gone to trial.
John awoke the next morning not remembering where he was or who had their arms wound tightly about him. Keeping his eyes closed, he tried to remember whom he might have gone home with and came up empty. Well, this was embarrassing. That hadn’t happened in years. He was naked so he doubted it was a chaste night.
Getting on the bed, John straddled Sherlock’s hips and eased his way down the back of his thighs and stopping at Sherlock’s knees.
John thought all of these things in a matter of seconds and felt quite satisfied with himself. Almost smug, even. And perhaps a bit childish.
“John. You’re distracting me and I’m losing my erection, now I’m going to have to start all over again.”
“Do you have any other questions for me? It’s almost half nine and you don’t want to keep Doctor Watson waiting; trust me.”
“You know, I think that you surrender to glamor fairly quickly when it’s something you want but don’t want to give in. Isn’t that right?” John said, opening the drawer in the nightstand and grabbing the lube.
“Actually, I did but I’m certain that you’d prefer to avoid the A&E when I had to take you there for nicotine poisoning.”
Rapping her knuckles on the door to Moriarty’s hide out, the door was quickly opened by Moran as if he had been standing there waiting - which he had.
In the end, Moran hadn’t been able to go to Bart’s for the blood; it was still - unsurprisingly - being monitored by the police. Instead, Sebastian just broke into a local Blood Bank and helped himself to five pints of O+. He was running late and couldn’t remember John’s blood type so O+ it was.
“That word - no, don’t say it - causes more blood flow to the penis every time it’s said. It never occurred to me to test the limits of engorgement. It was never meant for public use! ”
“I’ve already wasted more time on this than I have available so I’m afraid we’re going to have to save this, ah, discussion, for a later date.”
“What am I going to do, John? I feel so lost. I want her back.  Why did she have to go? Why?” Sherlock sobbed, a slight touch of hysteria rising in his voice.
“Yes, that’s what I’d deduced before Greg arrived on the scene. That was brilliant,” John said while Sherlock blushed.
“Sorry but, no. I’d need to get to know you a bit better and from what I’ve seen so far, there’s not enough time in the world to make me want to get into your bed.”
“Definitely, I’ll be more than ready to fuck you by then too,” Sherlock said, pulling his trousers up, belt buckle jingling.
“Sounds more like a theory to me, though. I doubt that anyone’s ever tried it before, but we could…”
Mycroft, taking advantage of his extra two inches of height, looked down at his baby brother and gave him a look of condescending pity, which only served to further enrage Sherlock.
John added another finger and Sherlock lost it. Panting and moaning he forced John’s head onto his cock then pushed back against John’s fingers harder.
Didn’t they realize that Sherlock would check every body bag leaving the hospital? He wouldn’t even have to open the bag, he’d just sense him and that’d be it. He’d thought that this Moriarty was supposed to be a genius.
“I knew it! Fucking Becca!” Mycroft took a quick look around to make sure that no one had come into the flat and heard him lower himself to using vulgar language. Safe.
“Don’t remind me. Waste of space. I’ll be glad when he leaves. Nothing but trouble. All those Alpha’s sniffing around him all the time. Disgusting.” Mr Watson took a sip from his pint and Harry seized her chance to pass along John’s trouble to their father.
“Oh lord, if it’ll make you feel better, sure, bring some over,” John said, suddenly feeling a shiver run up his spine.
“Oh, Sherlock. Why do you torture yourself this way?” John said under his breath followed by a hiccuping sigh. He didn’t want to follow Sherlock. Mrs Hudson had only been gone for a few days. He wasn’t ready to accept that she was gone. He wasn’t ready to let it sink in. He knew it was silly but he felt as if he didn’t enter her flat, she might still be there, fussing about, making a casserole for “the boys” because she just “happened to have extra ingredients” that would “only go to waste if they didn’t eat them.” They all knew that she was just trying to get Sherlock to eat and so they took the casseroles, biscuits, cakes, whatever she’d made “too much of” and brought it to the flat to nibble on. Eventually it would be gone without them realizing it.
“Self-flattery is for the insecure. What I’ve just told you is a fact. Nothing more, nothing less. It requires no self-flattery. Besides which, you’re already attracted to me. I could sense it as soon as we met,” Sherlock stated with what John thought was presumptuous arrogance.
I would love to have you over to my flat on Friday night at 6pm. Please come if convenient and let me know what your favorite dish is and I will order it for you. Sadly, I’m not much of a cook.
Bareback was not allowed here, although Irene had everyone tested regularly - a bartering system arranged with one of their customers in the medical field - if she found out that you’d had any sort of sex, anal or oral, without the use of a condom, out you went with your bags hitting you on the sidewalk as you lay there stunned and wondering what the hell had happened. No one thought they’d get caught but most toed the line. She didn’t have the patience for employees who would endanger their health, the client’s health, and most importantly, her bottom line. She was very, very comfortable and she intended to stay that way.
“Just trying to get some of these morgue drawers empty. My job’s not complete until the autopsy, tests and paperwork have all been taken care of. It’s actually very satisfying while being frustrating at the same time,” John laughed, feeling a little silly making that comment. He took another sip of coffee.
I’m glad that you enjoyed the food and that it was enough to feed the department. I’m also glad that you had the foresight to save yourself something for today. It was my pleasure providing a small token of my esteem.
“I was afraid that you might have trigger finger, but everything seems to be in working order,” John said, sliding the finger back in the joint.
“That’s what happens when you’re new to day drinking, John,” Sherlock replied, linking arms with John as he tried dragging him down the street. He really didn’t want to have to carry this man to his flat.
“Sounds like BDSM. We’ve done that sort of thing before, John. What’s different this time?” Sherlock asked, leafing through the script.
“Here we are,” Irene stood in front the third door along the hallway and rapped three times. The door was immediately opened by a man of 5’9 tall, with cropped sandy blond hair, a shock of completely white hair in the front.
“You could shower here,” Sherlock offered, licking the puncture wounds he’d made in John’s neck. He tasted even better than Sherlock had thought he would.
Although you wouldn’t know to look at him, Sherlock Holmes could barely contain his excitement. He thought that this case was easily an eight, possibly a nine, and he was beside himself with joy. The past few months had been deadly dull and despite Lestrade throwing him a metaphorical bone from time to time to keep his mind occupied, it wasn’t enough to stop his ever increasing craving for oblivion. He just wanted to get high and stay high until something interesting finally came along. Unfortunately, Lestrade and Sherlock’s twat of a brother were keeping close tabs on him.
“Oh, don’t forget this.” Becca said and threw her car keys underhanded, hitting Sebastian directly in the middle of his back.
“Not yet. I really want to talk about this last color, ‘pila’…” John said, giving Sherlock a knowing glance.
“Of course not. I understand why you did what you did. Although I rarely indulge myself, I’ve been known to employ some vigilante justice from time to time. There are occasions were prisons just won’t do,” Sherlock replied.
“I imagine that must be painful. You’ve got to be rock hard by now. Bursting at the seams, as it were.”
Sherlock's robe was becoming increasingly damp in the front and in the back and just thinking that made me slide up against him all the harder.
She prided herself on her ability to sense what a man was looking for and playing the part to entice him to ‘treat’ himself. They all loved that one. They could be the biggest arsehole in London but they’d still believe that they weren’t able to 'relax and enjoy' themselves with their wives/mistresses. They deserved to be pampered. They 'owed it' to themselves. Men were so easy to manipulate that it wasn’t a challenge anymore. Until Sherlock had appeared at her door dressed as a reverend. He’d taken her breath away in that moment and had never given it back.
“You’re being unreasonable, John!” Sherlock said, now giving up all pretense of subtlety and demanding that John just do what he said.
“John. I’m so sorry about the espresso. Had I known that you would have had this type of reaction, I would have chosen a different type of drink to drug you with.” Sebastian said, pushing John’s damp hair off of his forehead.
“So, back to Dhamphirs. A Dhamphir is created when a male vampire has sex with a human female - victim’s willingness not necessary - this almost always results in a pregnancy that normally causes the death of the mother during the birth of the baby which is a human/vampire hybrid.”
“My hands are tied in this matter, Sherlock. Doctor Watson has refused the, ah, “opportunity” to go back to his original shift. There is no valid reason for me to exert any pressure on forcing him to comply - at the moment. It has been two weeks since his schedule was changed to evenings and in that time, no one has attempted to approach Doctor Watson during his nightly walk from the hospital to his flat. What would you have me do, brother? I assure you that I realize that this is the calm before the storm but until Moriarty makes a move, I can’t justify exercising more authority over the doctor’s schedule at the moment. ”
John felt a chill go up his back and looked around. That was just freaky. Had Mrs Hudson had a premonition that she was going to die? ‘Right John,’ he thought sarcastically, ‘She knew she was going to have a massive coronary but had time to bake a dozen scones and write you a note. Must be someone playing tricks.’
“Surely you can handle one kiss? If nothing happens, then it’s fine and you’re right and it’s over. But if I’m right…”
“Many of John’s clients have regularly scheduled appointments with him. They rarely miss a date. Doctor Watson has a strict rule about last minute cancellations. You get one pass but should you repeat it, he’ll drop you off of his schedule until he feels that you’ve learned your lesson. He’s very strict you see, and talented. It’s rare for anyone to be late to an appointment much less miss one.”
“Don’t be such a child, John. It’s just a nipple…and possibly a small bruise forming…OW! Why did you do that?!” Sherlock exclaimed, rubbing his freshly pinched nipple.
“Not interested. I’m quite satisfied with the status quo,” Sherlock said, examining his nails disinterestedly causing Moriarty to lose his temper.
“Just how long can it possibly take one person to drink a cup of tea?” Sherlock asked in exasperation.
“I’ve got all the family I need right here,” John said, slamming his hand down on the table. “I’m my own nephew AND cousin. Wait…I think there’s an uncle in there somewhere. Whatever. That doesn’t happen everyday. To me, at least. Actually, I haven’t really taken the time to figure it all out yet. For all I know, I’m my own grandfather too. Every time I try to put it together, I just get a headache.” John said, knocking back another glass of scotch.
‘Great. I feel so much better now,’ John thought fuzzily. He wished that he could fall asleep. Between all that espresso and adrenaline, he couldn’t seem to pass out. He was not looking forward to this procedure.
“That’s better. Relax your thighs!” John said, slapping the back of Sherlock’s left thigh and leaving a vivid red hand print in its place.
“None. I’m more concerned about you though. You’ve never been bested before. The first time might be a bit tough on your ego.”
“I don’t know how you can drink that so fast. I’m half way through and I can’t take it anymore,” John said, putting the lid back on and pushing the cup a little to the side.
“Oh honey. You fell asleep before I’d even finished setting up this IV. Go to sleep now and I’ll be here when you wake up.” Becca said, slowly opening the line so that more sedation pumped into Sherlock as fast as safely possible.
“I know what you’re thinking. ‘How will he know when to stop feeding the catheter. How will he avoid actually stabbing me in the heart.’ Well, after doing this so many times in the field, you learn by feel and I’m the best there is. When it hits the right place, I’ll know. You’ll definitely know; maybe have a few heart palpitations although after your reaction to the espresso, I’m not sure that I can trust your response with that one. Either way, I guarantee I’ll hit the spot on the first go. Normally, when you’re having this done in hospital you’d use X-Rays or a Fluoroscope to be 100% accurate in the placement of the catheter but I don’t have time to do all that plus, as I said before; I don’t need it. You really should have gone home when I told you to, John. Ok. Here we go…”
“You've finally said something interesting. Tell me more about this James Moriarty and how he's even heard of me."
They both began to duck walk over to where they’d been hiding behind a hill before the ambush. So far, Private Sturges was the only one down but the shots were coming fast and furious and John had already called in for an evac so that they could get back to base without losing a man.
“I’m very cautious and the area will be well sterilized before I begin. Afterwards, I’ll cover the Port with a waterproof bandage to keep the incision clean but once you get to the boss, we’ll be using sterile bandages between drinks until the Port heals.
John and Sherlock exited the hospital in a companionable silence, walked to nearest coffee shop, sat down, John ordering coffee and breakfast, Sherlock, coffee only, and waited for their drinks to arrive before starting their conversation.
“Really, John? You can tell that, can you?” Sherlock replied but it lacked its usual venom. Now John was really worried.
“None take but I need to get back to my flat so that I can take some medicine for my shoulder and ice it.”
John was often in the field doing triage; preparing injured soldiers to be transfered to the medical center back at base camp. He wasn’t supposed to be in the field but he was so talented and had saved so many men that otherwise wouldn’t have made it that his commanding officers had thought it a risk worth taking.
“Well, I’ll really have to think about it and get back to you,” Becca said, leaning over to casually lick her lover’s nipple and give it a quick suck.
John heads to the morgue at 3:30am to examine the body. Sherlock doesn't think that anyone will be there at that hour of the night. Surprise!
“All you need to do is face me and lean forward. I’ll take care of the rest.” John said, patting his lap again.
“Are you quite finished? There’s a man with his foot embedded in his mouth. Please take this seriously.”
"It IS a business, you know. Wouldn't want to keep clients from requesting our assistance. DAMMIT, JOHN!" Sherlock exclaimed.
John stepped off the tube, shoulders slumped, feet dragging. He was completely knackered. He normally got home by six. It was late, half 11, well past his bedtime. He just wanted to trudge the rest of the way to Baker Street, fall into bed, and sleep the next two days away. He wasn’t even going to stop in the kitchen for tea. He didn’t have the energy to fix two cups and one couldn’t go into the kitchen and make only one cuppa. It just wasn’t done.
“John! John Watson! Good to see you! I guess you were in your own world! You walked right by the bench I was sitting on.”
“Of course. Hard to get respect from the troops when everyone is on a first name basis with their commanding officer, John,” Sebastian said with a laugh that lasted a little longer than John thought the comment warranted but that was one of the things that John really liked about Sebastian. He was always in such a good mood. Never had a bad word to say about anyone. Their evening chats always picked him up and he was glad that they’d met and become friends.
“Oh, come now. Do you think that I’m so naive that I haven’t realized that your brother has you protected by snipers? We’re surrounded and I’m insulted that you think I’m dumb enough not to notice. Besides, I have a present for you.”
As they walked up the staircase, Sherlock found himself becoming nervous for some reason. It wasn’t as if this was his first interrogation. He hoped that he’d be able to get through this without staring at the Doctor’s mouth and imaging all the cocks that had taken up residence there. He shivered and Irene caught it out of the corner of her eye.
“You don’t mean that. Shhh…,” John said when Sherlock began to respond. “You’re sad. You’re hurt. And you’re not exactly in your right mind at the moment. We just came back from the funeral. Now is not the time to make long lasting decisions. You’re saying things that you don’t mean and when you come back to yourself, you’ll regret them. Trust me, I know from experience,” John smiled ruefully.
“That freak is going to kill someone someday and it’ll be a lot worse that just knocking some poor bloke over. No offense,” she nodded to John.
“Fine. Hand me the lube out of your nightstand,” Sherlock said getting no reaction. John had really gone back to sleep!
“Oh god. Just…just wait for me! And no more touching yourself! I’ll take care of her when I get back.”
John’s fangs dropped down and he pulled Sherlock tight against himself. John slid his fist back on Sherlock’s cock one more time and suddenly he was coming all over his hand, his hole spasming around John’s cock.
“I have no equal,” Sherlock said, flipping John onto his stomach and pinning one arm behind his back.
Sherlock turned and walked from the kitchen to the door and listened intently. He was wearing one of his green silk robes and as I could tell by looking at his lovely arse outlined in the silk; he wore no pants.
More dialogue added to the end. I forgot about Mycroft and he was highly offended - so, his normal state of being.
John hadn’t bothered to lower his own trousers, he’d only pulled down his flies and pulled his hard cock through. As soon as he felt that his palm was wet enough…
Mr Watson dragged John by the collar out into the stairwell where Harriet was already waiting. She watched with barely suppressed glee as their father swung John closer and closer to the top of the stairs. Now came her part.
“Because that’s too much power for anyone to hold over me and I don’t like being out of control and at someone else’s mercy.”
John grabbed Sherlock by the hair again, pulling so tightly that his neck was bowed back and he was unable to do more than respond with a grunt.
“Really? Describe it for me. I can’t wait to hear it,” John said, crossing his arms and leaning back against the couch.
“Oh, not me, dear. I have a hip, you know. Time for another herbal soother. The first one has worn off.
"Why, giving you what you want, John. I'm fairly certain that you're at the very least, bi. I'd enjoy it if you touched me now.
“I just started recently. We’ve gone to so many crime scenes lately and I’ve had to watch you bending over for extended periods of time. I’m just a man, Sherlock. I can only stare at that beautiful arse for so long before I want to take you off to some dark corner and shag your brains out. This just happens to be the first opportunity I’ve had.”
John’s hand raised and came down on Sherlock’s beautiful backside with a resounding ‘TWACK!” Sherlock flinched but didn’t cry out.
“You’re about 30 minutes from killing him,” Moran said as he turned to the fridge and removed a bag of O+ blood that he’d just put away.
“We both know that’s not true. You’re Soul Mates. I know that Sherlock has tried on several occasions to ensure that you understood what that entailed.”
"Just a minute, love," John said with a condescending pat to Sherlock's plump backside with his clean hand.
Sherlock was paying for the pleasure of interviewing a prostitute. Sort of. He’d charged it to Mycroft’s black AMEX and made the appointment with Doctor Watson without either guilt or regret.
John began to slowly press forward until he’d breached Sherlock with the head of his cock. There was a sharp intake of breath.
“Cerinthe Major. Blue Honeywort. Bees are especially drawn to Honeywort. Did you know that John?” Sherlock asked without turning around.
“We like to make sure that our interviews…are secure. This place,” Mycroft said looking up and around then returning his gaze to John. “Is very secure.”
“Well, I suppose I should give him a rest,” said Moriarty who’d been about to reach out to Moran for the tubing again.
John tightened his lips and began the exquisite torture of moving back to the head, his tongue cupping the back of Sherlock’s cock as he went. He finished by just sucking at the head, licking across the slit and swirling his tongue around the salty tip.
He couldn’t resist sliding his cock along Sherlock’s well lubed cleft before he picked up the bottle of lube again and added more to his fingers.
"Because you keep losing. Stop asking to play to be the top and maybe I'll allow it...eventually," John said smugly.
“But I’m all out of nicotine patches and this case is an eight. An EIGHT, John! And you know how rare those are!”
“You’re being very tedious, John. I’m not in the habit of repeating myself. I told you that I’m not really sure. Wait. I’ll check with Mycroft. He retains the most useless and mundane information,” Sherlock said, pulling his mobile from his pocket and speed dialing his brother.
“Sherlock. I’m ok. Nothing a couple of paracetamol and a good soak won’t fix. Stop your fussing. I’m fine. Truly.”
“Absolutely not but if I’ve learned anything in this business it’s not to give clients bad news in your place of business. It never ends well.”
“Doctor Watson?” No response. “John? I take it from your reaction that you were unaware that you’d completed the ritual?”
“He can keep it, just not in my house! I won’t have the shame that comes along with keeping a whore who can’t keep his legs shut, in my house! What would my friends think? My coworkers? I’ve brought you two up better than that!”
"You might consider knocking," Sherlock said imperiously, as he and John continued shaking their fists up and down.
“If you’re so keen on it, do it yourself. Go ahead. I’ll wait.” Sherlock said, brushing a nonexistent piece of dust off of his naked chest.
“Here’s the thing though. I’m about to fuck you and as we both know, it’s your first time AND you don’t even want it, so that’s bound to be uncomfortable. The champaign will help relax you. Will you drink some more? I’m only thinking of you.” John said sincerely.
“I’m trying court a man not a deer. This doesn’t sound like John at all.” Sherlock said with a snort.
“Well, before we get started, again,” Lestrade said, reaching into a pocket and pulling out a bottle of paracetamol. He tapped two into his palm and handed them to John.
Their coffee came and they both added cream and sugar. Sherlock, in John’s opinion, putting a ridiculous amount of sugar in his cup.
Life at school was so much worse that John laid low to avoid Lawrence and his friends. He had no confidants - why bother when Lawrence would only scare them away or worse; turn them against John. He was so alone but he was used to it by now and thought that was how it was supposed to be.
“Yeah. Sherlock said that. When they met for coffee the other night, Moriarty could smell me on him. We hadn’t even exchanged blood at that point.”
“And when I do, I don’t care where we are, or what we’re doing, I’m going to teach you a lesson about keeping secrets from your lover.”
- Omega’s enjoy small tokens of appreciation. Flowers. Candy. Cards. These are the best way to begin your courtship. Remember not to come on too strong lest you frighten the Omega away.
Once John moved in though, he knew that he’d realize that of the two of them, Sherlock’s work was clearly the more important of the two and therefore took priority over anything John might have going on.
Sergeant Mark Mulvey looked over at the men working on Niall and Captain Watson. He had a good feeling about Niall. He’d be back. Captain Watson, though. That was a career ending injury if ever he saw one, and the military was his life. He hoped that the Captain had family that would take care of him while he was healing. John had never spoken of them before. Mark thought that his parents were both dead but he might have a sister…god, he hoped so. He was going to need the support.
There’s probably something wrong with him. After all, Lawrence lives in the same house and is a happy baby with nary a mark on him. Obviously John’s just retarded or something.”
"Not now, Mrs Hudson!" John and Sherlock called out in unison but she'd already opened the door and stood looking at them, plate of biscuits in hand.
“Irene,” Sherlock said, holding her delicate fingers in his grasp for slightly longer than the average greeting warranted. Irene felt chills down her spine and her nipples began to harden. ‘He’s such a tease,’ she thought.
“Don’t do that to yourself, Sherlock. It’s too fresh. Her sister will be here to go through her things later this week. You know she chose to stay in a hotel rather than here. She said she couldn’t face the emptiness of the flat yet. Come away from there,” John said, holding his hand out to Sherlock who ignored it, turned the doorknob and entered the flat.
“This is all my fault! I’m so sorry! It never occurred to me that you didn’t drink espresso. I should have called you and asked,” Sebastian said worriedly.
Anderson had his good arm out, ready to shove John but his fist smacked right into John’s open palm who then used it to push Anderson among the bins.
Moran was packing up to head out to Bart’s when Moriarty stopped him with a hand gently placed on his shoulder then moved his hand up until he could twirl Sebastian’s hair at the back of his neck. Looking up at Moran through lowered lashes in a flirty manner, Jim said;
“And just how would your brother have access to confidential information?” John asked, annoyance clear in his voice.
“The bullet tore through your bicep. I cut a path right through your muscle. That’s going to be painful, yeah? Let me get you something for the…”
“I’d think that three or four days should do it. He’s lost a lot of blood as well as having a hysterectomy. We were able to save the ovaries but I’m afraid that the uterus was torn beyond repair.”
John held his palm to Sherlock’s face. He sucked on John’s fingers first, and then put all of his effort into getting John’s palm nice and slick.
“Yeah, well…” John ran a hand through his hair. “I guess that I’m more impressed than insulted. I haven’t had sex, actual intercourse, in at least three years. No interest. But then I saw you, with your almond shaped eyes and plush lips and I was intrigued. Then, you spoke and that was it. I had to fuck you.”
“Well, I can’t just pull it out. It’ll break off not to mention that it’s too wide to try and get it out in one piece so I’m going to have to create openings in a few strategic spots to get the entire thing out of there.”
“But John. Are you really sure you want to do this? There are places that would take you in. Perhaps you could get a scholarship to medical school and…”
Sherlock’s breath hitched but he didn’t make any other sounds. John set up a punishing rhythm and Sherlock’s cock became further engorged.
Yesterday was lovely. I hope that we’ll be able to do it again although I don’t know when I’ll be available. It’s cold and flu season and I look to be trapped at work for the duration. Rest assured that I’ll be thinking of you every day until we meet again.
“Looks like you took the first job you could get, eh? Shame that the medical field seems to be picky about whom they’ll let work on their live patients,” Sherlock smiled smugly.
“Of course you are, I have a monster cock that I want to stick up your arse. I’d be worried too,” Sherlock said with a grin.
“Now, you’re probably wondering why I didn’t dry my hands off. Well, I couldn’t use tools but there was nothing forbidding hand washing. Did you know that being slapped with a wet hand is exponentially more painful than being slapped with a dry one? Here, allow me to demonstrate.”
“Yes, yes. Tough day with runny noses and rashes while I’m toiling away solving a murder - without an assistant, I might add - but you just go right to bed.”
“John. I want you,” he said, trying to pull John’s arms away from the chest that they seemed to be locked to.
John knelt behind Sherlock. He was about to shoot his load and he wanted to be deeply inside of him before that happened.
“You’re not ready to commit. I get it. I’ve been with my significant other for…well, a long time. We had our ups and downs too before we finally decided to give it a go. Oh, don’t get me wrong, we still have our ups and downs - for one thing, he’s moody as hell and has a scary temper - but he’s really a great guy the rest of the time. Lets me be myself. Doesn’t mind my hobbies. Actually. He’s very supportive of them and will offer suggestions and go out of his way to provide materials. Yeah. It was a good decision and I don’t regret it in the least. You have a roommate that you can confide in?” Sebastian asked, sensing that their conversation was coming to an end.
The only sounds that could be heard were passionate moans and sighs as John placed his arm behind Sherlock’s thigh pulling his leg higher so that he could easily slide his cock inside.
“Did you take samples from the puncture…,” Sherlock started to say before seeing the neatly labeled vial in the stand. He’d really hoped to have been able to contaminate the saliva from the bite wound before it had been sent up for testing.
“So what? People who aren’t Soul Mates join together all the time.” Moriarty said, annoyed at Sherlock for being deliberately obtuse.
“So I’m stuck with him? WE’RE stuck together? Forever? There’s no way out of this? At all? I find that difficult to believe.”
Although Harriet had been saying the same thing all along, Elizabeth had hoped that once she saw the child, she’d change her mind. Obviously that wasn’t going to happen. At least, not any time soon.
‘He’s smiling. Why is he smiling? Has he met someone? Is that why he was so late tonight?’ All of these thoughts passed through Sherlock’s mind as John began the walk home, Sherlock shadowing him all the way to his front door.
John forced a smile and said, “Hey, that’d be perfect! Can’t kill what’s already dead.” John laughed but felt himself die inside just a little bit more.
John exited the hospital lobby and stood scanning his surroundings, looking for agents…looking for Sherlock. He knew Sherlock was out there somewhere. He couldn’t sense him so he wasn’t physically that close, but he felt certain that Sherlock was here despite John telling him not to come.
She gave a shiver and told herself to stop thinking about this. It was pointless and frustrating. She’d see if Olivia would be able to take a break from their finances so that Irene could work out her unrequited lust for Sherlock. Olivia was always hinting around that she was available to the Mistress any time, any day, anywhere. Today was almost definitely going to be that day.
“I understand that these men were known to have injured several of your coworkers - repeatedly. How did that make you feel?”
As soon as they were out of view of Lestrade and Sherlock, Anderson swung around with a cheap shot, punching John in his injured shoulder full force expecting him to drop to the ground, instead, he just stood there, looking eerily calm and still smiling.
“Beg me to shove my fist into you. Make it more believable than that last bullshit you gave me. Do it!” John flicked the speculum’s handle and Sherlock moaned.
“That’s for the best, I think. When we asked John what happened, he began sobbing uncontrollably and we had to put him under so that he wouldn’t tear any stitches and could get some rest. I don’t think he’ll need anyone with him other than yourself.”
“He does! He wants your sexy arse! Looks like I’m not the only one who enjoys watching you bend over.” John teased.
“Ready?” John asked, Sherlock met his eyes nervously and gave a brief nod of his head but John had already scooped out a generous amount of the jelly, spreading Sherlock’s cheeks with his other hand.
“A blessing…I can no long have children, mother. I’m a barren Omega. No one will want me now. That’s an Omega’s entire purpose, to provide offspring and I can no longer do that. Who’s going to want to be with me when they find out that I can no longer bear children? I’m only 17 and my life is over.” Tears began running down John’s face and he wiped them angrily away.
“I’m practical, John and this is highly impractical. And I want you to know that I’m doing this under protest.”
Harry shoved the door to the pub open with a little more force than necessary and got a round of “Oi!s” for her trouble.
“Ok. I’m only going to say this once. If you ever, and I do mean EVER come within spitting distance of Sherlock, I will hurt you.  If you even touch him, I will fuck you up beyond all repair. Don’t talk to him unless it’s work related and even then, be on your best behavior. Have I made myself clear?”
“Good. I’m going to run to the admin’s office and steal a few of the pillows off of her couch. Do you think that you’ll need help walking?” Sebastian asked.
“What about when I do this?” John grasped Sherlock’s cock and gave it a careful squeeze followed by a few quick strokes.
Sherlock lubed up his fingers and began slowly opening John up one finger at a time. This was the biggest indication that John was well and truly asleep. His muscles weren’t clenched and Sherlock had him ready in record time.
“Get some fluids started on our injured. Stay away from their bad arms. Make sure that Captain Watson has been stabilized. Wouldn’t do to have him fall out of the helicopter after all this, would it?”
“Don’t you just love Japanese sand art? So relaxing. So peaceful,” Moriarty continued swirling the sugar around into different patterns with his forefinger.
“Fine. Aubergine. That’s my safe word. This is the only time you’ll ever hear me say it though so cherish the memory.”
“What about this ‘Seb’ person? Any information on him? Have you found him yet? He had to have been in the morgue often, his scent was everywhere.”
“See? He’s fine,” Jim said, eyes closed, smile on his face, rocking his head back and forth against the wall.
I have fun writing notes sometimes because I doubt that anyone reads them. Yes. It's true. My idea of fun is boring! ;)
“What? What’s interesting?” John knew that tone of voice. Something he most definitely wasn’t going to like was about to occur.
He decided right then and there that tonight would be the night that he finally said ‘no’ and actually stuck to it. He had a life too. He had a right to go to bed when he wanted. To fix tea just for himself without automatically making two cups. And, not only that but he was sick to death of the constant visits to Tesco. That was going to stop too. If Sherlock wanted to eat, he could go to the store. John would just grab something on the way to work and on the way home. There. It was settled. He was ready for whatever Sherlock decided to throw at him.
The nurse stepped out of the room carrying the baby in her arms. She recognized the grandparents right away. The man was reserved and looked uncomfortable but the woman already holding her arms out to take the babe. Both were surprisingly young looking. They must have been high school sweethearts. They couldn’t have been more than 39 or 40 years old.
“I don’t need a refresher! I know what I saw!” Sherlock said, indignant that he should be questioned.
“I…think…,” John opened his eyes and looking up at Moriarty, continued, “that by my estimate, at the rate you’re drinking my blood, I probably won’t last for more than a day, two at best, so I couldn’t give two fucks what you call me.” John’s eyelids slowly lowering as if he was too exhausted to keep them open.
Sherlock tried to sit up and Becca open the IV all the way and Sherlock fell back down, head on his pillow. His eyelids were so heavy now that he could barely keep them open.
“Well, of course I was tempted,” Moran huffed. “But contrary to Dhamphirs constantly trying to paint vampires as the bad guys, we actually prefer to live in peace…”
“I’m not letting you stick an egg up my arse, hard boiled or otherwise,” John said without glancing up.
The doctor didn’t think that John was in any shape to go home right now. He trusted the mother - for the most part but she obviously hadn’t been able to protect John and honestly, the daughter was kind of sketchy and was looking way too pleased with herself.
Turning the handle, John pushed the door open slowly, wincing as the hinges squeaked. Sherlock forbad oiling them, he considered them, along with a couple of creaky stairs up to the flat, to be an excellent warning system.
“I’m serious, Sherlock,” John said heatedly. “If you keep pushing me like this, if the only way to get some peace is to cut to off all communication with you, I will. I don’t need the aggravation.”
“No. He’s not new and from all the evidence we’ve gathered, it seems that he and John struck up a friendship several weeks ago. Apparently, Moran has been buying John coffee regularly. Usually it’s only hospital coffee but for some reason, last night Moran went to the shop across the street and bought two expensive coffees; one for each of them.”
“Well what about that blue stuff you looked at first. Does that mean anything?” John asked innocently.
“I’m off duty, not that it’s any of your business, and I knew better than to leave you alone with Sally.”
“You keep struggling like this, I’m gonna have to get the zip ties and you won’t like that, trust me. I’ll make sure of it,” John promised.
“Why does it take so long to leave? What could you possibly be doing in there that couldn’t wait until tomorrow? It’s not like you’re saving lives.”
“Oh, we figured about four hours ought to do it for both of you. Then you can start your merry chase for Jim again. You might even get lucky. I think…” Becca looked around as if someone was listening, “I think that you might have Irene in your corner helping John from the inside but you didn’t hear it from me,” Becca mimed zipping her mouth, locking it with an imaginary key and stuffing it into her pocket as if it were real.
“I really wish you’d let me pay you for the coffee or at least take turns paying for it. It doesn’t seem right, you always footing the bill.”
“There. Even! Now for the champaign,” John said, walking over to fill two glasses, returning to sit beside Sherlock on the bed,
“John. It gets dark early in the winter. Why won’t you listen to me? You’re not safe. Not anymore.” Sherlock said to the now empty room.
“They’re not as motivated as I am, Mycroft, and you know it. Address. Please?” Sherlock asked, his voice hitching a bit on the last word.
“I don’t want…this is way off topic. If we can get back to discussing the victims…” Sherlock said nervously.
“Ask your questions. I’m very good at multitasking,” John said, his free hand now brushing the tip of Sherlock’s stiffening cock. And when had THAT happened?
“That our being together was meant to be and I don’t even believe in that sort of thing. Predestined, I think it’s called. And not everyone even finds their Soul Mate. I’ve always gone my own way. Made my own decisions. Why would I think that I needed someone, anyone? My life was perfect and then there you were, leaning over a dead body and my world view suddenly tilted on its axis and I…changed. That’s very difficult for me, changing. I know that’s hard to believe but…”
“I’ve already told this bloke everything I know so do me a favor and piss off. I’m on vacation,” Moran said, sounding genuinely aggravated.
With hard and fast strokes, John came on the mattress, relaxing into a boneless heap between Sherlock’s thigh. He licked the puncture marks closed and, with a final kiss, rested his head on Sherlock’s thigh.
“Goodnight, Sherlock. I’LL call YOU when I have time to talk.” Exhausted and just wanting to sleep, John walked into the lobby, closing the door in Sherlock’s face. Without once glancing back, he started up the stairs to his flat, unlocked the door immediately shutting it behind him. Deciding to forego the tea he’d planned on having first, he went directly to his bedroom, stripped down to his pants and vest, and without giving Sherlock another thought, he fell into bed and was asleep within minutes.
While I appreciate that you’d like to think of me during your work hours, I think that I’d rather you thought of me at night without the coughing and runny noses around you. It’s not really my preferred idea of being considered however if that’s the only time that I can have you, I’ll take it.
“Ugh! When did you become disgusting, Irene?” Sherlock asked, rubbing the saliva from his face with the sleeve of this shirt. ‘That one’s going in the trash’ he thought.
Sebastian wasn’t fooled by that pout for one minute. It was the calm before the storm. When Jim wanted something, he wouldn’t be denied. Still, Moran thought he’d give it one more try.
“Here. Let me fluff those pillows behind you so that you’re nice and comfy.” John made a great show of patting the pillows into shape and placing them behind Sherlock’s back.
“Although I doubt that you’ll find the prep work for fisting in the beginning. I’m not even sure that you’ll like it during but, honestly, Dark John isn’t supposed to care which means that I don’t either. Sorry.” John picked the jar back up.
“I’ve said it before.” Sherlock tilted his head back so that John could continue marking his territory.
“Do you have any friends or family meeting you here later who can make sure that you get home alright?”
“Sure. Oh. When did that get here?” John had turned and caught the big bottle of champaign chilling in a bucket on bureau.
“You. He’s talking about our future living arrangements and being a complete arse - as usual - about it.
“I don’t know about all that. Maybe it happened, maybe it didn’t. She was probably asking for it. Look at the way she dresses for God’s sake! She’s definitely not acting like someone who loved the father, though, that’s for sure," Bob said, as if offended.
“You are! You are!” Sherlock moaned as John’s fangs dropped down and sank them deeply into Sherlock’s neck with surprising ease at which point they both orgasmed simultaneously. John instantly felt power coursing through his body as he drank. It was like nothing he’d ever experienced.
Irene laughed. “Yes. After the very first visit, they were all talking about John and the amazing tricks he could do with his tongue…”
John placed one hand on Sherlock's tight bottom and reached over to fish the bottle of lube out of the nightstand drawer.
“Well, first of all I wasn’t joking, Moron. What’s a few more minutes. If he’s dead, he’s not going to get any deader.”
“Becca! John might be dying and you’re making jokes. Come on!” Sebastian said, hurrying back to where John remained unconscious.
“I am. Yes. And how the hell do you know that? And all the other things that you seem to know about me. You’ve never answered that one either.”
“No. Not my body. Not my problem. I’m out of the body business. Either apologize properly and without the sarcasm this time or you’re on your own.” John said smugly.
“No! Wait! I apologize. Come over here and look at my penis,” Sherlock said innocently. John just stared at him, waiting.
“No thank you. I think you’ve helped enough,” Sherlock said condescendingly. Will hurried back behind the bar and began wiping it down while keeping an eye on John. The new fellow didn’t seem quite right. There was something odd about him and John definitely wasn’t happy to see him.
“Answer my question,” John touched his prostate again, “Can I trust you to behave yourself if I untie you?” Then he added a third finger, paused, and wait for an answer.
“Not officially, no but it’s very small and hasn’t changed since I showed you the first pictures of it.”
“You heard him. No charges. Now please let me have some time alone with my son.” Mrs Watson said primly.
Mrs Hudson was torn, she knew that Sherlock was acting suspicious, on the other hand, nothing was on on fire and Mrs Turner did have some of the most delicious gossip. That settled it.
“Sounds like tomorrow’s going to be a busy day?” Sherlock smiled, giving John’s prostate a glancing brush.
Since it was way too early for Molly to draw all the bloodwork and evidence pre-autopsy, John took care of that for her, having everything lined up, the appropriate enzymes for testing added, labeled neatly and ready for her to work on when she arrived.
“Oh. I don’t care about humans. I was just saying whatever it took to get you to stay.” Sherlock smiled.
When there was no answer from Sherlock, he added a second finger causing a quick intake of breath from Sherlock.
Sherlock made as if to sit up but John only pushed him back down on the bed. He followed this up by tucking the covers around Sherlock’s body finishing with kiss on his forehead.
“Hands and knees, sweetheart,” John said watching Sherlock obediently move until he was on all fours, arse to John’s cock.
“Can you escape now? I’ll wait,” John said, letting his legs give out and sitting on the floor next to Sherlock to watch.
He took pictures anyway even as the surf gradually erased them until there was nothing left but foam and muddy sand. Even if he never found a use for them, better to have them than not.
He’d been honest with Mike when he’d said that he was looking for a someone to share a flat with. His savings were almost gone at that point and he was living from benefit check to benefit check; until Mike had told him about the available position at Bart’s.
“Why the hell are you calling me? It’s been decades since I’ve seen or heard from you and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it, you useless piece of shit,” Harriet all but screamed into the phone.
Ok, Sherlock. Scissors beats paper. You loose," John said. "Now, pay up," he said with a wicked grin.
“It gets better, I promise you that. It does get better.” John said, beginning to rock Sherlock as you would to calm down an hysterical child.
“Well, you see,” and here Moriarty proceded to rip open and dump several packets of sugar onto their table only to begin drawing pictures in them.
‘Interesting or disturbing combination of subject matter,’ John thought, staring at the books on anatomy, chemistry, and…cigarette ash? The last having Sherlock’s name on it as the author. An entire book dedicated to ash? Curiouser and curiouser.
John’s brain was racing. Trying to parse everything. So… his father and his mother were his grandparents but his grandfather was also his father? His mother was now his grandmother AND his aunt? It made no sense. Then John thought a little more...so, that made Lawrence his uncle AND his cousin and his other sister, Catherine was now his half-sister and aunt? It couldn’t be true. It wasn’t just his imagination? They really HADN’T wanted him? And just what did that make him…
“You’re going to have to take these off of me if you intend to fuck me. Or were you planning to just…MRFF!”
“Sherlock! Sherlock, wait!” Lestrade caught sight of the man on the ground at the last minute and was able to avoid him.
“I am sorry that you had to find out this way John, but you needed to know the truth and your family wasn’t going to tell you. Normally, I wouldn’t involve myself in such an issue - not really my area -  but when we met, I could tell right away that you were a Dhamphir and not a child of incest as was thought all along. That changed things when a vampire was added to the mix. We don’t tolerate rape in the Dhamphir/Vampire community,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly.
“Wider than that, sweetheart.” John said, making the last word sound less like an endearment and more of an order.
‘Come on, Neely girl! Pull your shit together!’ Becca wiggled herself into a comfortable position in the chair, put the book in her lap and began to read.
The more I heard, the angrier I got. Unfortunately, I have a terrible temper and I’d heard one giggle too many. Enough bragging.
After the tenth smack John said, “I don’t hear any moaning or pleading. I guess I’m not making an impression. Let’s make it 50. Ten done, forty to go!”
John looked down at his cup, braced himself and did the same. Blech! Still awful, only bitter AND sweet now.
John thought this was said a bit smugly and sounded like a lie to him but what the hell. You only live once.
“No. You’ve done enough to me [reference What Doesn’t Kill You] that I wouldn’t trust you as far as I could throw you. Now what’s happened to John?” Sherlock asked, losing his already shredded patience.
“I just…I may not seem like I care deeply but I do, for you. Only for you. I have a hard time expressing it. I wasn’t raised by a particularly demonstrative family. Mum and dad became affectionate in their later years but by then, well, you’ve met Mycroft and he’s the sociable one.” They both laughed.
“That’s a little more difficult depending on whom you’re talking to and which religion they believe in. Oh! Can silver burn me?!” John, feeling a little devilish, interjected.
“Not quite, Doctor Watson. We’ve yet to address your current relationship to my brother,” Mycroft said, opening the folder on his lap and glancing at its contents. Closing the folder he returned his gazed to John.
Once in the room, Miss Watson was gently moved to the birthing table, her feet placed in stirrups, the doctor checking to see how far along the delivery was.
“Are you sure you’re not gay, John? That seemed pretty gay to me. Not that I’m complaining,” Sherlock teased, smiling down into John’s face.
“It was and I hope we revisit those activities and more, in the near future. It’s just…I don’t move in with the first person I have chemistry with.”
There was a hook on the wall next to John’s elbow on which Sebastian hung the IV. John sleepily wondered why he’d never noticed hooks in the morgue drawers. Sebastian, seeing John’s questioning look, said;
“Awe. They’re leaving now. No fisticuffs tonight. Seb, find out who that doctor is. I want to know everything about him. I didn’t like the look that he gave Sherlock at the end. Sherlock’s mine! Let’s go!”
This surprised Sherlock. He wasn’t used to someone questioning his word and he didn’t like it, not one bit. Time to put this little man in his place.
“I’ve scanned it. Fucking, sucking, coming. Sex du jour,” Sherlock said, slapping the script down on the coffee table in front of him.
‘Dammit!’ Sherlock thought, haphazardly shoving the mobile back into his jacket. He slowed his walk just enough to stay out of John’s range while still keeping him within eyesight. It wouldn’t change the fact that John already knew that he was out there but it wasn’t going to stop Sherlock from following him home either.
“So beautiful,” John said, smoothing a hand along his hip as he appreciated the perfection of that amazing arse.
“I think you’ll find that there are a lot of places that you wouldn’t think that I should be and yet you’ll still find me there. Better to just accept it although I can have it confirmed for you from someone well above your pay grade.”
“If you plan on actually getting any honey, I’d think that you’d better be in charge. Did you know that bees that get wet and chilled turn into sludge?” John shivered.
“Let’s try out some other flavors the next time we do this. It leaves an awful aftertaste,” Moriarty said, turning the IV down and letting some blood drain into the bucket next to the table on which John currently rested.
“Good. Now stop being a creeper and come back to bed. Why we’re texting between the bedroom and the kitchen in the same house is beyond me.
“Sorry that I took so long but I was a little…excited after that last scene so I jerked off to relieve some of the tension. I wasn’t going to last ten more minutes at that rate. Now, the pressure’s off and I can take my time with you. Isn’t that nice?” John smiled at Sherlock who remained face down on the bed, awaiting further instructions.
“Too bad. You really don’t know what you’re missing.” Irene said, a smile accompanying that statement.
John felt Sherlock spasming around his fingers as he came hard and copiously, John swallowing continuously.
“Consulting Detective, remember? Were you shot in the head as well? Bad memory?” Sherlock said, tapping his index finger to his forehead.
Sherlock watched as John took his jacket off and lay it, lining side up, on the ground in front of him.
“I know that this will sound trite but it really is true; Mrs Hudson will live on in our hearts forever. She didn’t suffer. She passed in her sleep…”
“Won’t be needing these,” John made short work of throwing Sherlock’s shoes and socks behind him, then grabbing the waistband of his trousers, slid them neatly off in one pull.
Sherlock had spent several hours at Mycroft’s looking through all of the evidence and had tentatively determined that Moriarty’s cohort had intentionally planned the coffee cup switch. John wouldn’t have a reason to suspect that the other person would drug their own coffee but why make the switch unless John had been suspicious in the first place? Clearly, John knew his kidnapper. This “Seb.” At least casually. Well enough for the vampire to visit John nightly. Was this Seb person meant to be the original target? Sherlock doubted it.
“I’m an extremely good judge of character and I never misjudge a person. You’re attracted to me. I’m attracted to you. Plus, we’ve already bypassed the courtship phase. You’ve already had my cock in your mouth and fucked me ruthlessly up the arse. Well?”
“Of course. A bored Doctor Watson is a dangerous Doctor Watson and we can’t have that now, can we? Come along, Doctor Watson, your chariot awaits.”
“No, but if you break my brother’s heart, I can assure you that you’ll end up somewhere much worse.”
“Oh. Yes. The boss, Moriarty, you might have heard of him, has been somewhat patiently waiting while I gained your trust. I must admit that I actually do enjoy your company though and I sincerely hope that you make it through this.”
“And one more thing; pretty sure that my dad’s not a vampire. Saw him in the daylight more than once. Hell, he had a day job. This has been very entertaining though. Good story.”
Putting his mobile back into his jacket pocket, he whistled the same tune that Sebastian had been whistling as he’d been leaving. It was familiar and John had been wracking his brains trying to remember what it was.
“A few weeks of him laying about the house milking the tiny injury for all it’s worth. Fine. When can we take him home?”
“Too right and I was making good money here too not to mention the fact that I also live…lived here.” John sighed.
“No need. By the time you get Mrs Hudson downstairs I’ll have already let the bee go. It’s really a one man job.” Sherlock opened the window, went back for the bee and gingerly slid out and stepped onto the fire escape.
“You’re a half-breed, John. You’ve the best of both worlds. Religious objects don’t bother you. You could spend all day in a church if you chose to. And to answer your earlier question: yes, you can continue eating garlic,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John lay over Sherlock’s back panting, Sherlock’s forehead still resting against the back of his chair, breathing heavily, his robe now clinging tightly against his heated back.
“I’m afraid that it is going to hurt when I start cutting though, but hopefully between the morphine and the amount of the other drug remaining in your system, you’ll barely feel a thing. If you’re lucky, you’ll pass out from the pain.
“But not as much as John’s. This is bad but we can get through it. John’s not the first person to have a baby out of wedlock and if people can’t understand that, well, they can go hang for all I care.”
‘Sherlock. Please break the rules and find me before anything worse happens. I don’t know what Moriarty has planned for me - besides drinking my blood through a straw - but I’d really like it if you’d be in your typical jerk mode, ignore what I said and get in here and save me,’ John pleaded in his mind.
“Just wait a minute, Sherlock. I want to showoff my skills. It’s not often that I get to impress anyone on a crime scene without using my physician’s skills.”
“Who’s my bitch? Who. Is. It!” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear, punctuating each word with a brutal thrust.
“You said that we’d talk about it in the morning so we’ll talk about it in the morning. I feel quite confident in my ability to recreate the results tomorrow so your attention isn’t urgent. I’ve been practicing for over a month and today I finally perfected it. I was just flush with success and wanted to share it with you. No worries. Go to bed, John.”
“Every time you tried to talk to them, to ask why they seemed not to like you, they believed that you were just jealous of the attention that they’d been lavishing on Lawrence. And Harriet reinforced that.” Sherlock paused again.
‘And just what the hell was taking John so long?’ Sherlock thought. He felt like John was avoiding him which was fairly insulting given the fact that Sherlock had promised not to walk him home anymore. John’s lack of trust in Sherlock was very irritating, completely oblivious to the irony that he was only ‘technically’ doing as John had requested. Sherlock wasn’t the most self-aware person in the world. Self-centered? Absolutely. Self-aware? No.
“Ah. Well, go after him then, John! And good luck. Not that you’ll need it. I think you’ll find that he feels the same way for you as you do for him,” Mrs Hudson said, giving John’s hand a pat.
Ignoring the pain in his back, he leapt to his feet before Mrs Hudson had reached the door to the bedroom.
“The idea of bending me to your will, controlling me…this isn’t a new fetish is it, John,” Sherlock stated matter of factly.
“It’s ok, John. I was a medic in the military and I’m more than qualified to give injections. I’ve also performed surgery in the field which will come in handy today.” Sebastian said, now running his fingers through John’s hair.
“Yes, John. And neither one of us like to leave a job unfinished,” Sherlock said, pointing his index fingers to his own now hard cock.
While come wasn’t really his normal choice of lube, he was desperate to get his cock inside Sherlock before he had time to change his mind. It would do in a pinch.
“But this is the most romantic gesture I’ve ever seen and I have nothing but myself to offer you in return.”
“Their eyes don’t generally linger on a man’s flies unless they’re thinking something unsavory.” Sherlock smirked. All confidence and superiority.
“Hello, Mycroft? I know where Doctor Watson is although I’d recommend an ambulance to pick him up. I seriously doubt he’s capable of walking on his own. And before you ask; no I wasn’t “in on it.” Might want to check on Sherlock too while you’re at it.”
“I’m hungry NOW, Seb. He’ll be fine. And if he dies, well, you can just find me another one. Right?”
“It’s fine. I’ve got it. Now, lean back, shut your eyes AND your mouth, and let me do my job! I’m starting to have performance anxiety over this. It’s a matter of pride at this point. We’re not leaving until you come!”
“Da! You can’t mean to hurt John!” She reached out and pulled one of his hands off of John’s collar who then lost his balance and fell in what seemed like slow motion, down the stairs. John hit the floor with a sickening thud and lay still.
“He threatened to kill you, John. If I don’t give you up to be with him, he’ll kill you. He means it, John. I’ve just found you and I’m not giving you up for anyone or anything.”
There was a sudden banging at his door and Moran took his time getting out of the chair before answering it.
Spending money in a brothel didn’t quite compare to the purchase of lab equipment and chemicals though.  Sherlock actually hoped that Mycroft would mention it. There was the potential for a huge row over this and it had been a long time since they’d really gone at each other. Sherlock smiled to himself. Yes, something else to look forward to in addition to catching the murderer.
"We seem to have an alarming amount of government personnel turning up dead or worse,” said Mycroft.
“I’ve never met anyone like you, Sherlock. I think…I think that I could fall for you in a big way. It’s a bit scary. What do you think?”
“Head down, ass in the air! Faster, dammit!” John said as Sherlock fell to his knees, folded his arms in front of him and lay his head on them.
Sherlock set about hanging up his jacket and rolling up his shirt sleeves. Kicking off his shoes but keeping his socks on, he said,
“I’m fine, John. I don’t know that I’d ever want to have a fist up my arse again but it was very sexy watching you lose yourself to the moment. Something you wouldn’t have been able to do if you hadn’t been told to do it. You worry too much, John,” Sherlock finished primly.
“I’m not even going to ask you how you know that. I don’t think that Irene would appreciate my departure. I’m her number one generator of income here,” John hedged.
Sherlock sat on the rooftop of 221B gazing intently at humanity as it walked along below, filling their limited lives with unimportant things for unimportant people and was annoyed by it all.
“Deal.” John laughed taking a sip of the incredibly hot cup of coffee. It tasted bitter and John made a face.
“What do you think I’m trying to do?” Harry looked around and spied a large ceramic pot with nothing in it, picking it up, she began to swing it at John when her mother came in behind her and held her arm back.
Sherlock began picking up the bag to see if there was any identifying information but there was nothing.
“What do YOU want? More life changing news that I never knew or wanted to know?” John asked angrily.
“Because I have secrets and now you know them. I can’t take the chance that you’ll report me to the police. Murder is bad enough, but vampirism? There’s no such thing as vampires and we’d like it to stay that way. Leave everyone to their eroticized horror, I don’t think that we’d be received just as wholeheartedly by the public.”
John smirked and waited. Hearing Sherlock pull himself up using the doorknob, he stepped back and waited for the fireworks that were surely about to occur.
“Well, your loss. You’ve paid for an hour of his time. That’s quite a lot of money. Will Scotland Yard reimburse you?”
Sherlock, shoulders aching, turned and began bending forward. At the point where he thought that he might fall, John grabbed his hair halting his decent. He arranged Sherlock over his lap so that his head was settled on a pillow while his bottom was pleasantly elevated over John’s thighs.
“You cheated first,” John said, smacking Sherlock’s arse again and standing up. “Don’t be such a child. Accept defeat.”
Moriarty’s insane laughter followed Sherlock outside of the diner where he could still clearly hear his laughter as he walked away.
“Sorry, sorry,” John said. He admitted to himself that he might be slightly more excited than he’d first thought. That arse, though! How could he resist? Even through his coat it felt fantastic. Pull yourself together, man!
“Lidocaine. I can’t provide any more sedation right now - wouldn’t want to accidentally overdose you - but there’s no reason to cut you open when I can numb the surgical site. I just wasn’t expecting you to still be awake at this point. And as I said, I really do like you and want to keep your suffering to a minimum.”
John’s mobile rang. He looked at the number, ‘unlisted’. He was about to ignore it when stopped ringing just as quickly as it had started. His mobile then pinged notifying that he’d just received a text; also from an unlisted number.
They’d all been regular customers of Irene Adler’s brothel [see None Given for background] which was de rigueur among the young ton and homosexuality was in vogue now - you had to be ‘seen’ at Irene’s brothel to be considered one of the movers and shakers in society.
Suddenly, Sherlock wanted nothing more than to sink his cock into John’s heat. He was always incredibly horny when he solved a case. Day or night. It didn’t matter. He wanted in John and he wanted in now, which John usually obliged. It wasn’t looking good for tonight though. ‘Unacceptable!’ he thought again.
“Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your tirade but, yes, it’s John which you already seemed to know before you even sat down.”
“There, much better,” John said, admiring his handiwork. Sherlock’s pants and trousers now rolled down and stuffed beneath the Velcro strap holding his thighs together.
“Rude! Get over here and help me set it up before we hang another bag. ‘Hot water?’ Honestly.” Becca said beneath her breath.
“Here’s what we can do…” Harriet leaned in and began whispering into her father’s ear who started grinning, then laughing. Then they were both laughing.
It wasn’t only their use of Irene’s business, it was the fact that all four had been ‘clients’ of one John Watson.
“John. John. John. Don’t leave like that. The case is solved and what are you going to do? Go home to that lonely bedsit and stare at the walls? Wouldn’t you rather stay here and get to know each other better?”
He took out his gun every night, wondering if this was the day he’d kill himself. Then he met the genius and he felt glad to be alive for the first time in a long time.
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes and looked around blearily. It felt like a lot longer than one day had gone by. He looked at he iPhone.
“Jim, I’m sorry but I ran out of time to grab Chinese. Bart’s was wall to wall cops so I had to go across town and hit up the local blood bank,” Moran said as he grabbed all five bags of O+ in one large hand, opened the icebox door with the other and placed them all neatly inside.
“Enjoying my selection? Oh no. Don’t stop. You might find something you’d like to borrow,” Sherlock said as he entered the living room. “I’d want it back, of course.”
"Are you ready?" I asked but I'd already entered him completely before he could answer and he moaned.
“Oh god! More!” And so John gave him more, and more, and more…and Sherlock didn’t complain about pain once, until he came. That’s when the real complaining began but John was very mellow by then and so he just let Sherlock drone on, and on, and on, and on…
“No. You are not shoving anything in my rectum today. My arse is still burning from that figging you talked me into the other night.”
“Well, well, well. Not even five minutes in and I’ve already pinned you. With ease, I might add. Surrender?”
“Why don’t I take you to the pub. Buy you a drink or two. It’s the least I can do to make up for Sherlock…well, being Sherlock.” Lestrade said.
“Ummm,” Will began nervously although he couldn’t have said why he was so nervous. It was a pub after all and John wasn’t visibly drunk. Plus, John’s flat was within walking distance of the pub so he wasn’t all that worried; although, truth be told, he’d been planning to cut him off after this last bottle anyhow. And not just because John had drunk the last bottle of that particular brand that he had.
“You know, smirking doesn’t really suit you, John,” Sherlock said close to John’s right ear causing him to jump slightly. He hadn’t even heard the man move.
“No. We’re doing this now. I won’t be able to get any sleep until I know why you’re sitting here in the dark, staring at your hard cock, and have done all day apparently. Or every day for a month. Whatever. Just…tell me so I can go to bed.”
“Finally! A worthy opponent! I’ve never been bested in a fight either. Take your best shot!” Sherlock smiled, leaping up as if on springs only to meet John’s fist as soon as he was upright.
Sherlock began running after him, stiffening cock thwacking painfully back and forth against his thigh.
“Well, that’s the end of that,” John said, turning the empty champaign bottle upside down in the bucket.
“That’s ridiculous, John. We’ve rubbed our members together. Masturbated each other - both to completion I might add. You weren’t hesitant in the least. Actually, I’d say you were the aggressor.”
“He needs to get to know you. The real you. Not the pretend, hormone driven Alpha. Can you do that.”
I don’t expect that the bells will be necessary as I’m already familiar with your handsome countenance and I assure you that you already have my full attention.
He stepped up to the door and knocked. A lovely woman with auburn hair and a polished demeanor opened the door and gestured him into the sitting room with a smile.
“That’s better! I wanted you to see what good care I’m taking of you! I always clean up after myself and I never let food go to waste,” Moriarty said beginning to lick every last drop of blood that had landed on John’s skin. When he was done, he leaned back to admire his work and smiled.
“John, we text every night. Every night. What part of this story are you unaware of. I told you that the butler did it before I’d even told Mycroft. If you’re trying to trick me into killing this bee, it’s not going to work and you should be ashamed of yourself!”
“That’s why I’m so early tonight. I figured that you might be in need of an end of the week pick me up. I’ve noticed that you always work late on Fridays. This will put some pep in your step. Be right back.” Sebastian said, leaving to get the sugar before John could reply.
“Indeed they are and I’ll thank you not to mock them, John.” Sherlock said seemingly popping up out of nowhere, surprising John while Lestrade calmly took another drink, eternally unperturbed and unsurprised by the lunatics’ sudden appearances.
“You provide a very import service to the community, Doctor Watson, you shouldn’t be embarrassed just because you’re good at your job and enjoy your work. I’m very satisfied with what I do,” Sebastian said seriously.
Sherlock looked down at what he was wearing, then looked back at John’s face and burst out laughing.
“Well, probably because she might fall into those limpid pools you call eyes, and tell you everything. Me, I’m safe. I have no information on John’s whereabouts but I do have a job to do. Now where did I put that?” Becca started patting her jacket pockets.
“I’m going to pack up my stuff and leave. There’s no way that dad will take this better than Harry.” John stood up and started emptying everything in his chest of drawers into the duffel he kept beneath the bed.
“Oh. It’s just this stupid bee! John was going to kill it for me.” Mrs Hudson said nervously. She wasn’t acting, she was trying to sell the idea that she’d ever have a bee murdered and wasn’t sure that she could pull it off.
“Always getting into trouble requiring his lover to save him. Why, once in Belgravia, he even managed to get himself drugged…”
“Technically my rectum is untouched so if we’re going by that definition, then I am most definitely a virgin,” Sherlock replied matter of factly.
“Shhhh…you see all of those people down there? They can’t see us. They can’t see me taking you like this. Bent over and raw. We don’t have any time for finesse so I’m afraid that we’re going to have to wrap this up quickly.”
“Yes. Moriarty can be crass at times. In any event, all he needs to do is get near you and/or Sherlock and he’ll know without being told, that you’ve now bonded. You positively reek of it. There’s no way he couldn’t know.”
“How? I have teams everywhere. You’ve been there everyday as well and I know that you’re the last person who someone could slipped by without your notice.” Sherlock could hear Mycroft’s chair being pushed back as he stood up.
Following that path, John searched for and found Sherlock’s hole, slowly easing the tip of his index finger inside. Sherlock gasped, his hips stuttering briefly then he began fucking John’s hand on his own.
“I said that I was sorry.” John finished pulling off his jumper and set it on the chair, heaving another heavy sigh as he did so.
“But we’re Mates, we should be together. That’s how it’s always done. If you’re lucky enough to have found a Mate, the next step is cohabitation. It’s the natural progression of finding a Mate.” Sherlock’s fangs dropped down and he grazed John’s neck, hesitating when he reached the part of the artery where he could feel where John’s heart beat the fastest.
“Your posture is exceptionally good right now. Even for you. Standing up, John began to look at Sherlock’s back when he noticed that the tub had quite a bit of blood in it. There was also a bloody hemostat laying in the mess, a large…was that a splinter? Yes. With a large splinter locked in its jaws. Then John looked at Sherlock’s back.
“The case is solved so the party is over. For me, at least. I’m going home.” Sherlock said, turning to leave. John grabbed him by the back of his impeccably tailored jacket, because of course Sherlock would actually own a bespoke tuxedo.
He continued picking up the pace until Sherlock began to moan; he’d reached the perfect rhythm. Hopefully, there would be no more talk of going home to finish this.
“No to both of those things. I’m not moving in with him and I’m not having your…whatever they are, stalking my every move.”
“I thought it was just a kink and I enjoyed it. Why complain?” Sherlock said, shrugging his shoulders.
“Oi, mate. You oughtn’ to be kippin’ on the sidewalk like that. You might get hurt. Here, let me help you up.” Lestrade held out a hand and John grasped it with his right allowing this Lestrade person to do most of the heavy lifting. The throbbing in his shoulder had now changed to knives digging into his scar as if trying to burrow through to his tendons. This wasn’t going to be one of those things that he could sleep off overnight. He might actually have to break out the pain pills for this one. Mother fucker! He’d been off of them for months now with the occasional pill due to a flareup but other than that, drug free.
As I said, I'm no expert. If I've gotten anything wrong, it was completely unintentional and I apologize.
“Yeah, yeah. Just some heartburn and heart palpitations. They’ll go away but I’m definitely glad that I didn’t finish that entire cup!” John said, getting up and dumping the rest of the coffee in the sink, then crushing the cup and throwing it into the bin alongside Sebastian’s discarded cup.
“…edge…” John finished lamely. He hoped that Sherlock got better quickly. Sherlock definitely couldn’t be trusted if John went out. He didn’t look forward to being trapped with a three year old for days.
“This particular fetish requires that a main character act grossly out of character, in a violent and aggressive manner…” John paused.
“If he’d wanted you to see him, he would have allowed you to see him but it was unnecessary. And, at the time, no one had been close enough to determine that you were a Dhamphir much less that you were clueless about your own nature. We were probably more surprised than you at this turn of events.”
“That’s just your mind trying to protect itself. It gets better, it will take time but eventually, once you’ve stopped grieving, you’ll be able to reminisce without it hurting quite as much. Come on, love. Let me take you back upstairs. This isn’t the time or place to do this. Surrounded by all of her things. You need to process this for a bit. Ok?” John asked, tilting Sherlock’s head up.
“Ugh. You’re doing that thing again. That I HATE! In case you need a reminder. Stop whining my name!” John snapped.
“Oopsy! My bad! Oh, Jack! Look at the mess I’ve made. You have blood all over your face and neck. Just let me clean that up for you. Seb, could you hold this for me?” Moriarty said, handing the mainline to John’s heart to Seb who quickly capped it.
“Yeah, I know but…Hey. Do you know what?” John said, abruptly changing the subject. “After all of this time, you should really call me John. I actually don’t stand much on the practice of addressing people by their first names while they only address me by my title. Outside of business or the military, of course.”
“He’s wasting time that would be better served elsewhere,” Sherlock said, giving John a sultry look.
Oh, he was aware that she was enjoying herself at his expense but he wanted to ask a few more questions before he began the interview. All of this other nonsense was superfluous to the case and he wasn’t interested in discussing it further - no matter what Irene - or his cock - seemed to think.
“That’s…that’s good. I feel the…oh!” Sherlock exclaimed when John wrapped a hand around his cock giving it a tight squeeze.
Then one day Lawrence had shoved John down so hard that he’d struck his head against the wall leaving a huge lump on the back of his head. There was no one else around but Harriet, who was Lawrence’s favorite person - even over his mum and dad - and he looked at her nervously to see what she would do. Instead of being angry, she began to laugh. A laugh that grew louder and louder and that’s when Lawrence realized something in his little toddler heart; John was fair game.
“Course, it might become a bit more uncomfortable once I begin dilating your anus until you’re open enough to easily receive my fist. Can’t be helped though. Needs must, and all that.”
“I can’t imagine my life without you. You’re everything to me and I’d do anything for you. You know that, right?” John asked.
“Ooh. What that woman does to me! Yummy!” Becca said as Moran entered the room sans secret knock, the blood warmer hidden under his shirt. It really was bubblegum pink and he’d be damned if he’d walk around carrying something like that in public. Well, if there was anyone about.
John pressed his erection against Sherlock’s calf while he continued working him into a frenzy. He was going to need relief himself by the time this was over.
As John mercilessly continued pounding Sherlock, he could feel Sherlock’s orgasm approaching. His muscles were tightening up around, his cock throbbing in time with each thrust.
“That’s it? You have nothing to say about the fact that I was able to come by thought alone?” Sherlock huffed.
“I still think he’s a pompous arse,” John said, again looking Mycroft up and down, much to the man’s annoyance.
“What an pointless demonstration of your talents. What’s next? Having them set the building on fire with them still inside? I’m not impressed. I have the same capabilities. You. Are. Wasting. My. Time.” Sherlock said, annoyed.
“Ok. G’night.” John said, hanging his coat on the hook and trudging into the bedroom, closing the door softly behind him.
“That’s great. Any plans or are you just going to hang out at home?” John asked, tugging his bag onto his shoulder.
“This is…you’re unbelievable! This whole scenario is far fetched. It’s like a poorly written dramedy. I’m leaving! Oh, and tell your brother to stay out of my business.” John grabbed his coat and headed towards the door only to find his way blocked by one Sherlock Holmes.
“Didn’t Irene go over all this with you? She should have. I dislike repeating myself, even if it’s to two separate people.”
‘I’m lucky that Sebastian was still here when this hit. Bart’s would have admitted me instantly,’ John thought. Regretting the espresso but grateful for the help.
After all, John’s “patients” were already dead while Sherlock was trying to save lives. Well actually, he only solved crimes for fun and to alleviate boredom, he didn’t really care if people died. In fact, he preferred that they do.  If no one died then Sherlock wouldn’t have any work and if Sherlock didn’t have any work, neither would John so he should be grateful to have Sherlock’s. In fact, he was actually doing John a favor; without Sherlock’s help, John would wander aimlessly about the lab trying to wrack his brain for something to do.
John unexpectedly pushed through the glass doors ‘early’, a big smile on his face, and immediately began the walk home without once checking his environment. He hadn’t felt this lighthearted in awhile. Maybe he would ask for a few days off while things were slow.
“Just a little IV sedation. It’s enough for three days. I just set it on drip and it will keep a constant flow pumping into your veins until I come back for you on Monday. It’s a holiday so I’ll pretty much have the place to myself and technically, I’ll be on vacation so no one will be looking for me anyhow. It’s perfect, really. Then on Monday night, I’ll just drive a hearse up to the back of the hospital, shove your bagged body inside and be on my way, with none the wiser.”
“Well, it seems that old houses need to have the floors maintained or the floorboards begin to separate with random pieces popping up. You hid the cigarettes under the bed, Mrs Hudson surprised me causing me to pull myself from beneath said bed so that she wouldn’t catch me and…” Sherlock waved his hand halfheartedly. “This is the result.”
He patted his clothes and everything seemed intact. He felt no unwanted intrusions in his bum. His mouth did taste peculiar though. Oh my god! Had he blown Sherlock Holmes?!
“Let me just finish this text to Gary,” Sherlock said, eyes on his phone, thumbs rapidly passing across the glass.
“No. It’s just the temporary amnesia from the propofol. Don’t worry, things will start coming back to you soon.” Moran said, letting water from the new bag run through the tubing before connecting it to the catheter.
Eventually, the man realized that he’d fallen deeply in love with the genius but didn’t think that the genius felt the same way so he locked his feelings deep down inside and said nothing.
“That changes things dramatically. It’s now imperative that you move in with Sherlock as soon as possible so that he’s able to ensure your safety. I’ll have people on the outside making sure that you’re not approached by any unsavory characters.” Mycroft said matter of factly, leaning on the handle of his umbrella and preparing to stand.
“Exactly! Now you’re getting it!” Sherlock exclaimed hoping that they were near the end of this particular tutorial.
“I don’t know. This is so sudden. I always said that if I was going to move in with someone, it wouldn’t happen without some serious vetting.” John stopped, thought for a second, then smiled.
“John. Is this true? What about your medical career? You’re 17. This is no time to be having a baby.”
“But they found a way around security. I’m not proud of it but even you must understand that I can’t cover every little nook and cranny on the outside of a building as large as Bart’s.”
“I look forward to it,” John said, closing his eyes then snuggling further in, falling almost instantly into a deep sleep.
Turns out that there's going to be a chapter six before THE END. I couldn't help it. I didn't want to break up their marathon chat.
“I’ve had friends that it’s happened to. I can’t afford the risk. My friends had parents to take them back in while they applied for another scholar or some kind of waiver. No. As soon as I’ve gotten a clean bill of health, I’m enlisting. The Army will pay for my education. I’ll become a doctor and help others while I’m there. I hadn’t planned on being a soldier but I’d always planned on being a doctor and right now, this is the best solution. Then I can either start a practice of my own or find work in clinics or hospitals where doctors are very much in demand. No. I’ve made up my mind and I’m relieved and content with my choice.”
John pulled his bag higher on his shoulder and set off for home knowing that Sherlock would be following him all the way and finding that he didn’t mind it quite as much as he thought he should.
“Jim? Jim!” Sebastian called then saw Jim’s hand made Italian loafers peaking up on the floor next to John. Rushing over to Jim, Sebastian pulled him up by his shirt and slapped him in the face a few times.
