It's weird, the look Sam gives him next—like some strange hybrid of disgust and pity and anger, all wrapped up in the signature Sam Winchester puppy-dog eyes.
Before Erin could say anything, Dean answered first. “Wait to go inside until I get Cas out. The key’s on the ring but no one’s gonna recognize you, you’ll need to walk in with me.”
Cas trilled with something like pride and let go of his legs, immediately making grabby hands at Dean like he wanted to be picked up. Dean grumbled but ultimately complied, scooping the kid up in his arms. After all, he did just totally heal Dean's shitty knees. He figured that probably warranted a good few minutes of being carried if that's what Cas really wanted.
“Night, jerk.” Dean refrained from responding with ‘bitch’, mindful of the fact that he was speaking right by Cas’s ear, and opted to just roll his eyes. He watched Sam close his door before turning his attention to Cas, shifting his weight as they walked back to his room.
"Okay. If you say so," Cas said shyly. He opened and shut his mouth as though trying to decide what to say before opening his mouth again and asking, "Can I, um, use your shirts again too? I won't make as much of a mess this time, I promise."
"Sup, Sammy?" Dean’s voice was light, casual, but his eyes hardened, as though daring Sam to say something about the situation. In that moment Cas felt himself falling in love all over again.
“Can you walk to the laundry room?” Cas nodded silently and they started down the hall, Cas leaving a trail of little wet footprints in his wake.
freak out a little bit (okay, maybe more than just a little bit), so she simply chose to Not Think About It.
Cas’s eyes narrow. “Dean, the windows are pitch black. It is the middle of the night. Are you feeling okay?”

"Ah, I forgot you mentioned the wee lad speaks now. Quite the sprawling vocabulary, hmm?" She smirked and Dean bristled, feeling weirdly defensive.
“Night, sunshine.” Dean slipped under the covers, maneuvering slowly so as not to disturb Cas or his clothing pile, and a few minutes later they were both out like a light.
"Only teasing, dear. No need to get all worked up." She reached towards Cas again, who trembled a little but made no attempt to move away. Dean's whole body tensed when her hand finally landed on Cas's forehead, but thankfully she removed it a few seconds later without incident. She looked both rather pleased with herself and surprised, which Dean didn't find very assuring.
Eyes widening, Cas stared at Dean and forgot how to speak. If the lights hadn’t already exploded, he thinks he would’ve busted them again, brain short-circuiting at the thought of sharing a bed with Dean. Still tongue-tied, Cas nodded shyly and let himself be led into the bunker, Dean holding his hand and smiling the whole way.
“Can—can we go home now?” Cas wanted to say yes immediately, if only to stop Jack from looking so miserable, but he couldn’t help hesitating. Doubts began spinning through his head again, clouding his judgement, stopping words from leaving his mouth. Jack’s expression softened, and he grabbed Cas’s hand.
Dean ran his fingers over Cas’s back and felt two slight protrusions near his shoulder blades. Something soft was lightly poking out of the rips in the cloth, and Cas shivered as Dean lifted up the shirt to investigate.
The lights went out and Cas's arms immediately tightened around Dean's neck with an unreasonably adorable squeak. "Dee?" He sounded so scared, and it was starting to really freak Dean out. Cas had slept fine in the dark up until now, and Dean couldn't think of anything that had changed. He gnawed on his lip again, a little seed of worry beginning to grow in his chest.
Castiel's eyes were suspiciously shiny as he fixed his gaze directly at Erin. Absentmindedly she noticed how ridiculously blue they were. Like the sky, or the ocean maybe. “Can I tell you something?” He didn’t wait for a response. “I think… I think I've loved Dean from the moment I met him. Yes, the second I laid eyes on him, I was lost. I fell from glory when I fell in love, and I wouldn't change it for anything.”
Erin shook her head emphatically. “Nah dude. I mean this in the nicest way possible, but your drama is infinitely more interesting than any of the shit on TV right now. Hit me. It’ll be like a free therapy session, minus the therapy.”
Erin raised an eyebrow at Castiel incredulously. “You live in a bunker? As in an underground doomsday shelter? A three feet thick concrete shield against nuclear fallout and zombie apocalypses?”
to prioritize yourself, and he refuses to. He’s never been able to draw a line between selfless and suicidal. Never.” A faint
Dean took the salt, flicking the shaker over the pot a couple times. "Thanks, babe. And, um, same here. Nothing too interesting. In fact, I, uh, saw one case that's basically just a textbook haunting. So easy I could probably do it myself." The last sentence was rushed, exhaled, and Dean could feel Cas physically tense up next to him.
“So what—what does that mean, Cas? Do you still have your Grace, your wings?” Dean’s eyes widen. “Holy shit, did I see your true form? Earlier? Was that what that little spinny ball thing was?”
. Listen to me. His face, the look in his eyes when he talked about you, it's the way you look when you tell me about him. And you're indisputably in love. I'm pretty sure the feeling is mutual, dude.”
the shit he said, like it wouldn’t rock Dean’s entire world, shake the very foundations of his carefully curated identity, and then fucking leave? Yeah,
"Hey, Cas, it's okay. I've got you," he whispered, sliding into bed. Cas didn't let go, so Dean just sat there, propped up against the pillows lining the headboard, carding his fingers through Cas's hair in what he hoped was a soothing gesture. The angel hummed shakily, repositioning his arms to wrap around Dean's chest. Dean could feel him trembling minutely, his wings vibrating where they rested folded against his back. He wrapped an arm around Cas loosely, hoping it would make him feel a little safer.
Dean nodded wordlessly. "Yeah," he breathed, "that's exactly what it felt like. He's never done that before." He made a motion to stand, but as he straightened his legs, Cas pulled on his finger and whined.
"So, uh, we kept drawing after you guys left, and Cas wanted to give me his picture so I took it, which I guess made him so happy that he blew out a few lights"—Dean chose to omit some details there—"so I had to calm him down a bit. Thing is, I couldn't actually tell what the drawing was supposed to be so I asked him and he did this insane thing with his mojo where I, uh," Dean swallowed. "I saw my soul in his memories. He was drawing my soul, and he did somethin' with his angel powers that made me see
(worried, uncomfortable). Cas bit his lip before rubbing his face against Dean’s collarbone, his movements jerky.
—" Dean couldn't stop the sob that exploded from his chest as he watched Cas's labored breaths get shallower and shallower. "I love you," he said helplessly. "I
by warmth. The lights and sounds all faded until nothing was left but gentleness. Dean felt safe. Protected.
bad. Everything hurt and I took it out on you and Cas and I’m sorry. You never deserved what I did to you. You’re—you’re a good kid, Jack, a real good kid. Better than any of us, really.”
“Love you too." Cas took a deep, labored breath, the kind that made Dean's chest hurt just watching. "Don't leave me.”
"You know, Dean once did the exact same thing, whatever it is you just did when you looked at me. I was trying to avoid having to face him, out of guilt and cowardice and shame. But he squared his shoulders and cast his head downwards, forcing our gazes to meet until I had no other choice but to acknowledge him." He smiled, a bittersweet thing. "I looked in his eyes, really
“C-Cas?” His voice was barely a whisper, as though scared that acknowledging the change would suddenly reverse it, take Cas away from him again. “Cas?”
For the first time that day, Cas broke into a genuine smile. "Baby whisperer, huh? Good luck." With that, he promptly exited the room, leaving a disgruntled Erin and a shrieking Jack behind. She turned to the baby, still bawling into her collarbone.
hi guys!! as always thanks for reading, if u have feedback lmk i'd love to hear it :) @ the ppl giving me consistent comments - i see u, i love u, i am giving u forehead kisses *mwah* yall are the BEST!!! also. um. if any of yall are interested in other stuff i've written i am working on
Cas's eyes widened and he squeaked before ducking his head back to the safety of Dean's bicep. Dean smiled at the waitress apologetically. "Sorry, he's kinda shy. Not a huge fan of strangers."
"Mornin’ to you too, buddy." Cas chirped brightly again and just kept hugging him, like a koala to a tree.
He was greeted in the kitchen by Jack’s smile, warm and bright, and Cas's back, stiff, cold. Dismissive and uninviting. Babbles and coos filled the air but did nothing to relieve the tension buzzing through the room. Cas's measured breaths were just barely audible, each one shaky despite their steady rhythm.
"Not as far as I can tell. That's the only word I've heard him say so far," he said, watching Jack stroke through Cas’s feathers. “I’d assume he recognizes you guys though, since he apparently retained all his memories. I don’t know why he hasn’t tried saying either of your names yet, and I don’t know what exactly triggered his speech.”
Cas frowned, emitting a low displeased hum, but eventually lowered his arm. He had yet to let go of Dean's hand though, and Dean had a feeling if he tried to put him back on the ground he'd pitch a fit. So he continued to stand, back leaning against the table, bouncing Cas lightly against his chest. He could feel him humming, low and constant.
“Promise?” Cas’s voice was quiet and steady, but his wings fluttered nervously at his sides. He wouldn’t look up at Dean, hands anxiously fidgeting with one of the towels in his lap.
Dean doesn't know what's coming next. He knows there's a cosmic crap ton of problems they're gonna have to deal with soon. He knows life's gonna keep kicking him in the teeth, because he's Dean Winchester and that's just what life does. But right now, all he can see is Cas standing in front of him, breathing and whole and
that she could feel in her gut, heavy and out of place. Jack squirmed in her arms, only contributing to the uneasiness settling in her stomach. His lip wobbled, and the kitchen lights began to flicker above Erin, fluctuating between dim and blinding.
his Cas back as soon as humanly (well, superhumanly in their case) possible. So yeah, the potential cuteness factor made it kinda tempting, but he was gonna have to take a hard pass on this one.
"Oh." And Cas sounded so small, like he really didn't expect Dean to ever say it back, like the magnitude of an
"I'll be right back, sweetheart." True to his word, Dean took all of two minutes running to the kitchen to grab a water bottle and a small towel, stopping at the sink to get the towel damp before returning to his room. He kneeled at the side of the bed, putting himself at eye level with Cas.
Cas’s brows furrow. “But I would like to stay with you. I want to say yes. Did you change your mind, already?”
He wiped his face down gently, taking off the film of blood and dirt and sweat that had been building up.
“Cas.” He sat down next to him on top of the covers. The slight dip in the mattress made Cas slide a little closer, his little body leaning up against Dean's side. “You’re the best damn thing to ever happen to me. Of course I love you.” He kissed the top of his head.
ANYWAYS omg i can't believe this is finally finished!!!! i hope yall found the ending satisfying, ik i could've had the boys have like 20 more conversations bc they both have so many issues and feelings they should talk abt but don't lol but i felt like this was a good place to wrap it up. thank u so so much for reading, esp @ yall who have been keeping up w this and leaving comments w each update, i appreciate yall SO much! i cannot tell u how many times i sat at my laptop w major imposter syndrome like what on earth am i doing!! i'm not a writer!! i can't do this!! and generally just feeling extremely inadequate and then i would see some lovely comment in my inbox and i'm reminded that hey ppl actually DO enjoy my writing!! there is value to the things i create!!! so yeah infinite thanks to everyone who gave this fic attention, yall are literally the reason it got finished <3
“I—I’m not sure.” Her eyes went glassy, her gaze unfocused. “There’s only… flashes? Light and sound. I—oh my God. I-I think I was possessed. Oh my God, I was fucking possessed.” She was breathing rapidly, hands beginning to tremble. “Fuck, I
Castiel swallowed and avoided looking at Erin. Yeah, she didn't blame him. "I don't know." It came out as a whisper, barely audible despite the store's absolute silence. "Dean cares about me. He's told me that we're family, and he doesn't say things like that lightly. That's more than enough." He said this less like he was telling Erin and more like he was trying to convince himself.
"Yeah, he kinda grows on you," Dean admitted, looking at the top of Cas's head with a fond expression. He really was incredibly endearing. But ultimately Dean knew what he wanted, and that was his Cas, back to normal. Across the room, he glanced at Sam and Jack, who looked back at him patiently. Dean took a deep, calming breath.
"It's not funny," Dean hissed. "How the hell am I supposed to go to sleep if Cas is constantly hanging on me like a spider monkey? Or shower, or shit, or any other number of human body things?" He adjusted the way he was holding Cas and realized the kid had fallen asleep in his arms again.
"I'm not sure. But at the rate the grace is mending, I would guess you won't have to deal with any of this for too much longer." Rowena looked at Cas thoughtfully, tapping a finger against her chin.
“I don’t know about you guys, but I’m tired as hell. I’m gonna hit the hay, see if I can get Cas to sleep through the night too.” Dean had no idea what to expect from the angel; he was still asleep, arms around Dean’s neck, but he had little confidence that Cas would actually stay asleep. He didn’t really know what else he could do though besides take him back to his room and hope he didn’t wake up.
of all places? It was simply unfathomable to Dean. He knew it was real; he felt how Cas felt in that moment, but he just couldn't understand why. It made him feel so small, knowing the sheer magnitude of Cas's love. Not only that, but the knowledge that Cas had been in love for twelve fucking years without saying anything had Dean feeling
anyways as always thank u for reading!!! it's been kind of a shitty week so nice comments are v much appreciated rn :D also if u have any suggestions or ideas u would like to see happen in the future lmk i rly love hearing from yall!!
"He acted like he was happy with her, and I'm sure he was, to some extent, but we both know it wasn't substantial. Frankly, she was more of a representation of an unattainable ideal, more like a… a cardboard cutout, if you will, than an actual person to Dean. He stayed with her because he promised he would, never because he felt like he genuinely belonged by her side, in her life. It was… resignation, really. Just going through the motions of normalcy because that’s what he believed he should do.” He glanced at Erin, as though checking to see if she was following along.
"Alright, but you're outta your damn mind if you think I'm gonna let her hold him." As if to accentuate the point, Cas snuffled and burrowed into Dean just a little bit more. Dean shook him slightly.
"Hey, guys." Sam strode out of the kitchen, jangling keys in hand. Dean winced. "I'm going to head out, grab some pizza. Anyone wanna come along?"
“I just feel like if this relationship is what he truly wants, then he’d be here right now. He wouldn’t be eager to leave at the first chance he gets,” Cas said, just a hint of bitterness creeping into his tone. “And let's say he does want this, just a little bit—even then, he clearly needs something more. Which honestly shouldn't be surprising at this point. I'm not good enough, I've never been good enough for Dean to want me to stay around." His face fell dramatically, anger replaced by a deep sadness.
them in my head, the demon, h-how they were never gonna let me go, and I could feel my body moving but I couldn’t control it, I couldn’t stop it—” A gasp. “I-I think I
“And it gets even more complicated, doesn’t it? Because Lucifer didn’t just vanish. No, he blinked out of existence the very same night a nephil came to life. One even more powerful than all the nephilim before it.” Dean blanched, much to the demon’s delight. She smirked, mirthful and sharp.
save you, always." He coughed, blood coating his lips and dribbling down his chin. “J-just promise me you’ll take care of Jack, ‘kay? Make sure he knows how much I love him.”
“Yes, yes we do, Dean, because if we don’t you’re going to keep living in this delusional world of yours where everything’s okay, and reality’s gonna hit and you’re gonna get knocked back flat on your ass, and I’m not gonna be there to help you get back up!”
Hurt briefly flashes across Cas's face, though it's quickly replaced with confusion. "Dean, I'm not going to hurt you."
He could feel how anxious Dean was, how much he wanted him to come back, and he knew Jack was right.
Erin stopped and waited, unsure of whether Castiel would respond. She forgot she was still holding his forearm and loosened her grip, mildly embarrassed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to force you to stay. I just thought you should know.”
He squinted at Dean, incredulous, and then his expression softened. Dean looked… nervous? Scared. Terrified. His heart beat rapidly against Cas's hand, splayed on his chest.
While Dean struggled with a response, Jack reached out towards Cas hesitantly. Cas shied away, drawing his wings closer to his back and clutching Dean a little tighter. Immediately, Jack withdrew his hand, face absolutely crestfallen as Cas chirped nervously. Dean frowned and cleared his throat.
The conversation paused as Jack started to wiggle in Castiel’s grip, making grabby hands at Erin. She was secretly delighted when Castiel dropped a kiss on the top of the baby’s feathery, blond head and extended his arms towards her, silently offering to let Erin hold Jack. Beaming, she accepted the baby and hooked her hands under his arms so he could stand on her lap. Erin cooed and Jack responded with a giggle, bouncing his legs up and down excitedly. Damn, he was one adorable motherfucker.
"Dee," he said softly, pulling away from Dean's collarbone to look him in the eyes. He lifted one of his arms from around Dean's neck and put a hand on his cheek with a touch as light as snowfall. "O-okay, Dee. Okay."
“Shh, Dean. It’s okay. I’m okay,” Cas said softly, pressing one of his hands flat against Dean’s chest. “I’m okay. What happened?”
Dean swallowed. Damn kid really likes to get right to the point, huh? “Y-yeah,” he said softly, “yeah, I do. Never done a good job of showin’ it, clearly. But yeah. And you’re right.” He looked over at Cas’s sleeping face, squished against his shoulder. “We could all do with a little more openness, for sure. Probably me the most. Can’t make any promises, but, uh, I’ll work on it.” He gave Jack a sheepish smile.
"And you're sure you can? With your new responsibilities and whatever? Because you can't just promise that and walk it back later. You can't do that to me."
"If I have to take care of him while he's crying, again, I will definitely be joining him, and I don't know if I'll be able to make myself stop. Please, I need you to take over, just for right now."
"Hmm. Do you think Morissette would say that's ironic?" Erin boggled at him, mouth hanging open just a tad. Then she snorted, swatting Cas's arm.
‘Okay, Cas,” he says softly. Cas still isn’t looking at him, so he hooks a finger under his jaw, drags it back so they’re eye-to-eye again. “It’s okay.”
As Dean failed to respond to Cas, his happy chirping sped up and increased slightly in pitch, sounding more anxious now than pleased. His bottom lip wobbled and he gripped Dean's wrist even tighter, fingers digging into his skin.
you here with the Empty spell. You gotta keep track of all the angels and demons, you can't just ignore what you are."
Almost like he'd been waiting for his cue, Jack began to stir. He rolled over with a whimper and Cas sucked in a breath, a mildly terrified expression emerging on his face. He turned to Erin desperately as Jack's cries increased.
Oily tendrils of the Empty began winding up Cas’s ankles, latching around his wrists, creeping up on him the same way it did the night it took him from the dungeon, from Dean. He frantically struggled against the darkness, growing more and more panicked as they tightened. “N-no, please stop,
"Um, guys, I think Cas can… read my thoughts? Feel my feelings? I thought something negative and he did the grace thing again, but I didn't even say anything. He just, uh, knew somehow."
Yep, just call her the human centipede, because Erin's pretty sure she just put upwards of twenty feet in her mouth.
Jack swayed along to the beat, Dean quickly following suit. He couldn't help himself, it's a catchy song, dammit.
“Hey, that’s, uh, I guess that’s kinda like me, huh?” He smiles at Cas, pokes at his side. “Hunter with a red handprint on his shoulder. You do that on purpose?”
. Were all of Castiel’s friends marred by tragedy? Again, Erin realized she probably didn’t want to know the answer to that question.
"Whoa, whoa Cas, take it easy." Dean came to the rescue immediately, grabbing Cas by the middle and holding him as his body continued to lurch. Now that Erin was paying real attention she could see that Cas was shivering all through his body, and little strands of hair stuck plastered to his forehead with sweat.
Fuck, she needed to get Jack out of the kitchen before he got hurt. She could hear the electricity pulsating again with a dull hum, a low current that grew in volume and strength until the
There’s a tension building in Bobby’s kitchen. Sam’s nostrils flare, and his eyes flash angry, and Dean gets a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach because he knows what that look means. That’s the look that got Sammy into Stanford. That’s the look that could’ve made him the best lawyer to ever come out of Kansas.
Erin was still deep in thought, ruminating on the possibilities of Dean’s sexuality, when someone entered the store. It had been an exceptionally slow day, the cafe almost completely empty all day, and she had been manning the register by herself for hours. Erin’s back was to the counter, distracted and slacking off when the doors whooshed open, a blast of chilly air following before closing again. She diverted her attention, briefly searching for whoever just walked in before landing on the only other person in the store. The customer was a tall dirty blonde, clad in jeans and a dark jacket layered on top of flannel. He stood in front of the counter, uncomfortably shifting his weight from foot to foot.
“Alright, I’ll text her. In the meantime, we’ll just have to keep an eye on Cas, make sure nothing new happens.” Sam whipped out his phone while Jack stood up and moved away from the table, grabbing the empty boxes. A quiet whine escaped Cas, his wing twitching irritably in Jack’s absence. He squirmed in Dean’s lap, squinting at him with an odd expression on his face.
John's voice continued to echo in Dean's head, bouncing around endlessly. He clenched his jaw; since when do fucking Disney songs hit that hard? He wondered what John would say now, if he saw him literally dancing in the kitchen, making fuckin' pancakes with his pseudo-son who could sing every Disney song from memory and a male angel who he'd been in love with for years.
"Of course, Dean." Cas unplastered himself from Dean's body and walked across the kitchen, opening the cupboard. Dean closed his eyes for a second before opening his mouth again.
"Sorry, sweetheart. Not interested." Dean set his beer down and turned to face her. She giggled and got even closer, her breath ghosting over his ear.
“Holy—” Erin’s words caught in her throat as Cas’s entire body was enveloped in soft blue light. Jack had his eyes squeezed closed, whining quietly, but his hand stayed still against Cas. A hint of color returned to his face, and the gashes on his back stopped bleeding; not completely healing like Dean’s injuries had, but definitely much better than before, the edges cleaned up and the torn skin a little less ragged. Jack removed his hand with a coo and sat back against Erin, smiling for the first time that entire day. A few seconds later, Cas’s eyes flew open, shining electric blue. He jolted up in Dean’s lap and gasped, clutching at him weakly.
As Cas shifted more and more, the tub began darkening with blood and whatever else had been on his wings. Dean grimaced and pulled the plug just a tad, hoping some of the dirtier water would drain quickly. Gently holding the washcloth over the feathers, Dean made eye contact with Cas, not wanting to surprise him.
“Suit yourself, dude.” She jumped out of the car and walked down to the entrance, where Jasmine was leaning against the brick wall, playing with Jack’s feet. He giggled and kicked, and Erin figured he must’ve woken up while she was with Dean. She waited until she heard Dean’s footsteps behind her before inserting the key into the lock and pushing the door open, sidestepping so Dean could go first.
"Go away, Dean. I have nothing to say to you." Cas pushed the heels of his palms against his eyes, preventing any unwanted stray tears from escaping.
"Yes, Dean," Cas replies gently. He's smiling but it's a little sad. Dean feels like shit but he has to ask one more time, chokes out one last "Cas?" for good measure.
"Yeah, no worries. I normally wake up early anyways," Erin straight-up lied, smiling as she said it. She did not, in fact, wake up early on her own, but Cas didn't need to know that.
of them—they’re back, and it’s my fault. It’s my fault.” Dean realizes he’s trembling, and he quickly draws him into his chest, tucks him underneath his chin.
"You have to remember I'm a witch, Dean. Not an angel, not a deity. A very powerful witch, yes, but ultimately still just a woman with a knack for magic. You can't expect me to venture into utterly uncharted territory and not have a few wee accidents, aye?"
Thankfully the tub was pretty big, leaving room for Cas's wings to unfold without being cramped. Cas chirped uncertainly, looking like he didn't know what to make of the situation. He cautiously lowered his wings into the water, a couple feathers already floating loose.
So Dean ran back into the store and asked the register lady if he could just buy a ring box, please and thank you. He paid and drove home, humming the whole drive back, and that box has been burning a hole in his pocket ever since.
"And even if you don't, you'll never be as bad as Cas. I swear, some of the conversations we've had…" Dean shook his head with a smile. "I mean, you know how he was, Sammy. Like that one time, I told him to get outta my ass, and he just squinted and said 'I was never in your… '" He did his best Cas impression, voice gravelly and pitched even lower than usual. Both Jack and Sam laughed. "Or when we were talking about that one joke, the 'why is six afraid of seven' one, and he said some shit about how seven is a prime number and prime numbers are intimidating?" Dean paused to take a bite out of his burger while Sam wiped his eyes.
and pulls off to the side of the road, gravel biting into Baby’s tires. “Let’s, uh, take a break from driving for a minute, okay?”
“I’m… I’m not totally sure what’s happening, but his grace looks like it’s… converging? I told you earlier that his grace was spread through his body, but right now it looks like it’s trying to centralize again. I...” Jack squinted. “I think it’s healing, actually. It tried reaching out to me just a second ago. I take back what I said earlier. Nothing’s
Cas whimpered and shook violently, like a machine overworked, barely held together by rusty screws and nails, about to fly apart. Tears ran down his face as he cowered away from Dean, and Dean felt the reaction like a hand around his throat, a dirty thumb digging into a bullet wound. The guilt was so strong, he genuinely could’ve thrown up right then and there, but he kept going.
“What’s up, Jack?” She tilted her chin down, trying to catch a glimpse of his face, and he tilted his head back, looking up at her with those big, trusting blue eyes of his. He babbled but it seemed like he was really trying to say something, genuinely trying to talk to her.
Dean scooped Cas up off his lap, holding him against his shoulder, and slapped a wad of bills down on the table. They left the diner and piled into the Impala; Sam drove back home, much to Dean’s chagrin. Cas slept the whole way, though he did get passed off to Jack for a few minutes. Kids are not weightless, and Dean holding the angel for most of the day had taken its toll, as much as he would hate to admit it.
"Okay," Dean says calmly, like his world isn't falling apart all over again, like he isn't about to lose Cas for good this time. He leans forward, lets his forehead rest on Cas's shoulder, buries his nose in Cas's shirt.
“I… was just reminded of some old times, the beginning of a friendship with someone very important to me. He was the first person to ever give me a nickname." Castiel paused, and his face darkened ever so slightly. “Well, the first nickname that wasn't derogatory, anyways. I have many siblings.” Erin nodded knowingly. She had an older brother who was kind of a dick.
Cas shakes his head. “I would’ve lost it anyways. At least I got to spend it doing something good. Healing you was not a waste, Dean. I consider it a great honor to be of service to the Righteous Man.”
Erin had been eyeing the clock all night. It’s not like she has anything specific to do once she’s free, but she felt exhausted. Her shift had been extra long, she had a splitting headache, she’d spilled someone’s drink earlier and gotten yelled at for it. She was ready to go home.
Dean exhaled a sigh of relief he didn't even realize he'd been holding in. It would've been awful for Jack to hear Cas screaming in pain, hurting enough to blow out the fucking lights. He made a mental note to thank Sam when they got back. Dean texted back clumsily, arms still around Cas.
Turns out there was, in fact, something Rowena could do about Cas's wings. Before she left, she cast some sort of concealing spell, hands hovering over Cas's feathers as she mumbled an incantation.
long? Jesus, Cas, that's basically since we first fuckin' met." Cas just nodded slowly, like it was no big deal, like this information wasn't absolutely breaking Dean, splitting him down the middle.
and as long as he's safe that's exactly what we want. Right?" He glared across the room as though daring anyone to disagree. No one did, of course, but they all looked a little shocked, which, okay, understandable. Dean knew he was being just a tad defensive (maybe more than a tad) but he hated the way Cas's face fell when Rowena spoke.
“Like I said, he really likes you.” Erin brought her eyes back down to Jack, feeling a surge of pride. “Once we find a house of our own, you could come babysit for us, if you wanted. I’m sure I’ll need all the help I can get.” Erin felt her heart flutter a little. Typically she would be wary of propositions from strange, single men, but she trusted Castiel at this point.
Was that really what his soul looked like? And what the fuck was up with that warehouse? Dean certainly didn't remember that happening.
Dean always turned it off before the screen became enveloped in shiny black goo; the one time he shakily clicked a second too late, he slammed the laptop shut so hard the face damn near shattered.
"Um… Dean?" She could see his entire body stiffen, curving itself protectively around Cas. There was a jagged cut running down Dean's right cheek, and the torn sleeve around his left bicep was becoming soaked in blood. His eyes were red and disbelieving when he finally turned to see her. "E-
"Thanks, Dean. You're the best," Jack said, muffled by Dean’s shirt. He blushed and squeezed Jack back a little.
Still freaking out, Cas tried to reconstruct the broken perimeter, rearranging the shirts over and over but failing to look satisfied with his work. He looked at Dean with a lost and heartbroken expression, and Dean tried once again to help, grabbing a gray shirt from the pile and stacking it on top of another. Cas watched this happen with wide eyes and when Dean smiled and said, "See? All better," he started absolutely
"Cas. I'm so—fuck, I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. I didn't mean what I said, I just—I don't know why I get so angry but it's fucking inexcusable and it's unfair to you and I'm so fucking sorry, Cas. I'll say it a million times and it still won't be enough, but I mean it."
as Erin dug around the kitchen cabinets for some plates. She took a few and returned to the toaster, carefully extracting the slices so as not to burn her fingertips. The lids on the jam and jelly jars stuck stubbornly to the glass rim and took more effort to open than Erin would ever admit, but eventually she got them screwed off and plopped heaping spoonfuls of the preserves onto the bread. Strawberry jam for her, grape jelly for Cas, and a container of sweet potato mush for Jack.
For some reason it was super easy to rile Jasmine up with tiny comments, which Dean noticed and took full advantage of. They spent the next twenty minutes playing a game of give-and-take, of Dean being an antagonistic little shit and Jasmine retaliating with her knife or her right hook. He leaned back against the cool metal he was bound to, looking up at the demon through puffy and bruised eyelids. Blood dripped out of his mouth when he smiled.
"Okay, Dean," Jack said softly. "Thanks for explaining." He eyed Dean uneasily for a second, fiddling with his hands.
hurt him." Cas held his hand out towards them, eyes squinting in concentration. Blood trickled slowly from his nose, splattering on the floor, but he kept his arm extended, apparently somehow forcing Jasmine back.
"Just give me a second," Dean says quietly. It's a plea, not a request. He forces his feet to move, jaw tight, gritting his teeth, until he's inches away from Cas, patiently waiting for Dean to get his head out of his ass.
“Alright, follow me.” Sam gave them a reassuring smile and walked towards the couple of concrete steps preceding a large entryway. The floor turned to smooth, shiny hardwood as they crossed into an even larger room, adorned with hanging lights and symmetrical white pillars. The brick walls were lined with shelves of books, and the middle of the room was occupied by a set of long, rectangular tables, the same deep mahogany as many of the bookshelves. Each table was outfitted with a little lamp and rounded wooden chairs, and the whole room was illuminated by warm light, a sharp contrast to the room they had just been in. The library felt much cozier, much less… industrial. Something about that other room just didn’t sit quite right with Erin; this place felt much, much better.
“Huh. That’s weird,” Jack said quietly. He approached the bed tentatively, getting close enough to hover his hand over Cas’s forehead. “Hmm. Well, his grace is more stable again, so that’s good. I could try tapping into his thoughts to see why he’s scared.” Before Dean could respond, Jack lightly pressed a finger to Cas’s face and started squinting in concentration. A few seconds later, his hand fell back to his side. He looked at Dean, expression full of sadness and some other emotion Dean couldn’t quite place.
"Well, I remember we were together again, and then we got stuck in the place full of monsters, of ab-abominabations, and I just wanted to protect you but you kept praying." The smile slipped off Cas's face and he took on this faraway look. "I-I could feel your soul in so much pain, you kept reaching out to me and you were hurting so bad and I wanted to help but I had to keep running so all the monsters would chase me instead of you.”
"Dee?" And there it is again. Dean nodded with an affirmative grunt, feeling entirely too fragile. He stilled when Cas wrapped his arms around his neck, hooking his chin over his shaking shoulder.
She ended her sentence on a yawn then turned to look at the clock and saw it was already past midnight.
To no one's surprise, Cas squeaked in violent protest when Dean tried to set him down. His hands were occupied with the cup but his wings kept trying to wrap themselves around Dean, and his chirping was low and displeased.
“This is me askin’. Cas, I love you. I love you more than anything. I love the way you try to hum along to all my cassettes, even though you don’t know the tunes. ‘Cause that just means I get to teach ‘em to you myself. I love the way you get clingy in your sleep 'cause it makes me feel safe when I wake up. I love the way you can’t cook for shit ‘cause it keeps you outta the kitchen, and I get to make you all my favorite foods. I’m crazy about you, man. You’re my best friend, and one of the only things left on this godforsaken planet that makes me happy, and I wanna make you happy for the rest of my life.”
"I know it hurts, honey, I—" There was a sharp intake of breath from Cas, a little wet, a little hopeless. "I know. I miss him too. I miss Daddy too."
"Oh," he breathed, "oh shit, I'm really sorry." He looked from Erin to Jasmine, concern and guilt flashing across his face. "How're you holding up? I know…" He swallowed. "I know you probably think you're crazy and that no one will believe you, but you're not. Demons are real, and you were legitimately possessed by one, but you're safe now."
"Here, catch," he said, sending a ring of keys flying through the air. Erin caught them with a confused look, then it dawned on her.
"No no no no, fuck—" He stumbled over to where Cas was crumpled on the floor, gasping for air as he dropped to his knees. The fire made everything hot and hazy and he felt like the walls of the warehouse were closing in on him.
Before Erin could get up, a hand shot out of the bunched up blanket and circled her wrist, yanking her back down.
"Erin, I'm so sorry, but can you try to calm him? I just—" He made a helpless noise. "I just can't do this right now. I can't. I'm—I'm this close to losing it already, what with Dean being gone, and I just can't handle another hourlong crying session. I can't, Erin." His eyes were shiny, breathing becoming increasingly erratic.
Erin grinned at him. “Hey, Castiel. You’re here bright and early.” He grunted and shrugged, eyes closed like he was just barely awake. “What gives?”
"Alright, good. Good. For the record, I wanna be your home, too. You have a home with me, you and Jack." The smile on Cas's face widened.
When Cas felt the familiar crunch and grind of the tires rolling over the gravel near the bunker, he held his breath. He could already see it happening; Dean parking the Impala, turning to him in the passenger seat like that one night in Rexford, looking at him with some mix of pity and disdain, telling him, "Nothing happened, okay? We took care of that vamp nest and came straight home. Nothing changed. Got it?"
In just a couple strides Cas was across the room, where he dropped to his knees in front of Dean. He carefully removed the gag and moved to cradle his face, his hands impossibly gentle. "Dean," he breathed, "Dean, are you okay?" The familiar tingling sensation of Cas's healing grace flowed through his skin, easing the pain residing in every inch of his face.
Sounded a little too simple for Dean, but he accepted the explanation anyway. “Alright then. Let’s go to the kitchen, I’ll check what we already have in the fridge.” He pushed off the bed, waiting for Cas to follow. When Dean looked back, he saw that Cas had let go of his hand and turned around, rearranging the towels around him on the bed instead.
Erin played with the idea of telling Cas she met Dean, running scenarios through her head. Her thumb hovered above the keys as she considered pros and cons, contemplating what her best next move would be.
"He picked up another word just this morning," he said, somewhat indignantly. Dean felt stupid as soon as the words left his mouth, and he cringed as Rowena's grin widened.
Grabbing the bee shirt and some tiny gray sweatpants, Dean handed the clothes to Cas and looked at Sam and Jack. "Alright, I'm gonna get him dressed, and then we'll talk more." A pause. "Don't start eating either, I'm makin' pancakes for lunch." Dean winked at Jack, a look of pleasant surprise flashing across his face. In all honesty, he definitely was not in the mood to cook, not even a little bit, but Jack clearly needed a pick-me-up.
sucked ass. When he finally came back (because Erin refused to consider the possibility that he might not come back, ever) she was gonna fucking tear him a new one for putting Cas through this shit.
"Alright, you got it. 'Ironic', coming right up," Erin said, pulling out her phone with a small smile.
Erin didn’t even know where to start deciphering Castiel’s statement. Like, this random dude really decided to wax poetic to the person working the fucking register at a chain coffee place in the middle of Bumfuck, USA.
Footsteps pattered on the sidewalk, slowly approaching Cas. He really, really did not want to see Dean right now.
Holding Dean's face in his hands, Cas just continued to stare with those big baby blues. He lowered one hand to press against Dean's chest, the other hand still resting against his cheek.
At Rowena's voice, Cas jerked and twisted in Dean's arms, growling as he turned to face her. He wiggled out of Dean's grasp and slid to the floor, still drowning in Dean's ratty old t-shirt. One hand continued to hold onto Dean's jeans while the other extended in front of him, palm facing outward. Dean could feel the kid trembling against his leg, but the expression on Cas's face was fierce and determined, irises flashing blue. He realized almost too late that this was Cas's smiting stance. He must've clocked Rowena as a threat.
Castiel’s eyes flew open but he didn’t speak for a couple seconds. “I… I’m not sure.” His voice was so soft. “I told him I love him, once, when I thought I was going to die. I wasn’t ever planning on saying it but I couldn't just let go without him knowing.”
looking after two tiny poop machines.” “But Dean—” “Nope.”), and he’s turned into somewhat of a food critic. He’s growing his own garden, and he listens to music and sings off-key while he weeds his plants, and last Monday he cried when he accidentally stepped on and killed a bee. Every day he laughs a little bit more, and it fills Dean to the brim with lovesickness, so much he’s practically overflowing with it.
“Cas, I’m gonna turn on the lights so you can see that I’m real. We’re not in the Empty, okay? You’re with me, and we’re safe.” He let go of Cas’s grabby hand and turned around.
“No, it’s—” He took a moment to collect himself. “I’m sorry, it’s not your fault. I just—I just can’t. Please.” Jesus. Erin had never heard someone sound more broken in her entire life. She looked away, feeling sicker and sicker by the second. Jack hadn’t stopped crying the whole time, and his voice was getting weak and breathy.
Sam’s eyebrows shot up his forehead while Jack made a surprised kind of squeaking noise. “Um, did Cas just shush us? He talks now? Dean, we were gone for like, 40 minutes tops. What happened?”
"Um, I didn't know I could still, uh, do that. Sorry?" A fierce blush rose in Cas's cheeks, growing hot under Dean's hands. Dean raised his eyebrows and then burst out laughing, shaking his head.
“No, n-no, this isn’t right. Dean—Dean brought me back. I got out. He got me out. This can’t b-be real.”
memory foam mattress!!!)) with each exhale. A wide, goofy smile spread across his face as he tightened his hold on Dean. "Hello, Dean," he mumbled, mouth against his chest.
Cas opened his eyes, and Dean's breath caught when he realized his eyes were glowing, even bluer than usual. He dropped his hands from Dean's face but quickly wrapped a fist around one of Dean's fingers, apparently still desperate to maintain some kind of contact at all times. His eyes returned to their normal shade, and he chirped with an air of satisfaction.
Erin held Dean there and yanked his bloody collar, pulling his face close to hers. "Dean, you bastard, you stupid,
You've saved me time and time again, you friggin' rebuilt me after Hell, you gave me something to have faith in when I had absolutely nothing else. Every time I've lost you it has
"It's okay, sweetheart. Almost there." The nausea Dean had been biting back for the better part of the day was dangerously close to overwhelming him as he walked away from the war room, whispering reassurances to Cas. Every step down the hallway elicited another pained noise, another bullet embedding itself into Dean’s chest.
"Yeah, 'course." Sam reached over them and plugged the tub before turning the spigot. Water immediately shot out of the faucet, harsh and splashy on the porcelain surface.
“Ah, fuck,” Dean breathed, reflexively putting his hands over his ears. For a second he was reminded of the first time he and Cas ever met, the glass of the gas station windows getting blown out, the shattered mirror, all just from Cas’s voice. Yeah, definitely getting a little deja vu here. He winced as he lifted one of his hands from the side of his head, gritting his teeth against the pain.
, at least not to his brother. He tried to look down at Cas, but the awkward angle made him difficult to see. He suddenly felt exhausted, the full weight of the day just now hitting him.
A few days after The Disaster, Erin still hadn't heard from Cas. She wanted to text him, but seeing as the whole thing was her fault, she didn't know if it was her place. Cas probably hated her now. Hell, maybe he blocked her number.
"Yeah, Cas?" His voice was little more than a whisper, but he just considered himself lucky to have gotten the words out without choking on them.
"So does this mean he's still got all his angelic abilities? Like will he need to eat and poop and sleep like a normal kid? Can he still heal and smite?" Sam asked, seeming equal parts concerned for Cas and genuinely curious.
“Dean? Did it work? What happened?” Sam entered the room, scanning the room for Dean, Jack trailing closely behind. Dean heard his breath hitch as he finally landed on Dean—more specifically, the trench coated-lump swaddled in Dean’s arms. Sam stood stock-still; Jack’s eyes widened; Cas shimmied slightly against Dean’s body; Dean swallowed and looked across the room sheepishly.
Erin watched them leave the warehouse first and was about to follow them when Jack waved his fists in the air and yelled. It was short and not particularly emotional, more like a
He’d honestly thought the words would've been harder to get out, but nope. They rolled right off his tongue, natural as
hi guys!! p short chapter but the next one will be longer, i have most of it written already lol!! as always i rly appreciate feedback so big thank u @ ppl leaving comments, keep lmk what yall r thinking so far :)
"Dean?" A soft voice from behind him asked. He felt a small palm land on his back, start rubbing circles into his shoulder blades, and he heaved into the toilet again.
“Yeah, okay, maybe, but if he can only say one word does that really count as speech acquisition? I don’t know how much of a breakthrough we can legitimately consider that,” Dean said back. “Either way, it probably is a good idea to get in touch with Rowena, if you wanna text her and let her know. Maybe she’s finally got a spell or somethin’ we can use.” He exhaled loudly, suddenly feeling very tired again. Cas was starting to fall asleep on him, little fists wrapped in his worn shirt.
"No. I barely said anything at all, actually. I should've stopped him though. I could tell he was starting to get upset, I shoulda said something as soon as I noticed, I shoulda done more to st—"
Jasmine scowled at him and whipped out a scary looking knife, pressing the tip of the blade against his collarbone. "God, do you ever fucking shut up?"
you to know that I-I wouldn't do that to you. I wouldn't do that." Dean could feel his eyes beginning to well with tears, and he blinked furiously, futilely attempting to prevent their release.
Erin smiled. Honestly, it kinda made her feel a little warm and fuzzy that she was one of the only people close enough to Cas to do this. She didn't have that many close friends either, and it was kinda nice to know that someone considered her special, important. "Hey, it's no biggie, really. I've definitely slept in worse places, and I honestly don't mind couches. I'm just grateful you're letting me stay."
Apparently intrigued, Cas scooted closer to the bowl from where he'd been sitting on the counter. He looked at the pile of chips suspiciously. A brief expression of hope flashed across Jack's face as Cas continued to approach the mix. Smiling nervously, Jack reached back into the bag of chips and grabbed a handful. Extending his arm towards Cas, he held the chocolate chips cupped in his hand, shyly offering them to Cas like someone offering a horse some sugar cubes.
Drawers had been pulled out and emptied, his closet door thrown wide open, hangers bare or broken. Pants and socks and jackets were strewn across the floor, and Dean realized his shirts had been piled and arranged into a circle on the bed, surrounding him in a ring of clothing. Cas removed himself from where he was plastered against Dean and dove into the wall of shirts, trilling happily. He re-emerged from the pile holding one of Dean's favorite shirts, rubbing it against his cheek and humming. He grabbed Dean's wrist and thrust the shirt towards him, clearly wanting him to take it. Dean was so fucking confused.
“I think I’d rather die than have to face Dean’s rejection, face him cutting Jack and I out of his life in disgust and anger. Yes, I’d rather die than be dead to him.”
Something like hope flitted across Dean’s face before he steeled his expression into a deep scowl. “Yeah, well, guess you’re just shit outta luck then. Already tried the white picket fence thing; didn’t really agree with me, but I’m sure you remember that, huh?” He laughed humorlessly.
hovering three feet away. It’s a sphere of light, of gold and silver and metals, but it’s also a web, like gossamer lined with drops of dew, and it’s a blue star, burning and consuming and hot, and it’s a solar system in and of itself, mini-spheres following some invisible orbit. It’s brilliant and bright, all shiny and reflective and glowy, but interspersed in the shape are streaks of black, moving with the fluidity of something liquid. Like flexible strips of the abyss. Emptiness. That’s how Dean knows he got it right.
So Naomi must've been the voice from Cas's memories at the warehouse, where he'd been surrounded by hundreds of dead Deans.
"I know, I know, I'm so sorry," Cas soothes, keeping him close to his chest where Dean practically threw himself at him. They have their arms wrapped around each other, though Cas is doing most of the work to stop them from falling over. Dean just cries and cries and cries, lost in how warm and strong and solid Cas's body is.
Tugging on a pair of sweats, Dean quietly opened the door and walked down the hall to Cas's room, just a few doors to the left. He could see Jack's crib from the doorway; Cas insisted they keep the door partially open so they could hear any potential meltdowns. Soft whimpers traveled through the air, and Dean could hear Jack kicking and squirming against the sides. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he shuffled across the room and reached for the baby, trapped under a layer of blankets. Cheeks blotchy and wet, Jack sniffled and looked up at Dean with a quiet hiccup.
“Cas loves you and you fucking torture him for it. I hope you understand how badly you’ve fucked him up, Dean. You wanna know what might be the most horrifying thing I’ve ever heard, from anyone?” Erin knew that Dean did not in fact want to hear it, but she went ahead anyway. She got real close to his face, jaw set stubbornly, and noticed a single tear running down his cheek.
"Hi, Jack.” Truth be told, Cas’s memories with Jack were very confusing. He knew him, the same way he knew Dean, but somehow still not the same. He loved him differently than Sam or Dean; a protective love, yes, but nurturing too. He wanted to
"Okay, so what we know is one) Cas is still an angel, two) his grace is there and healthy but somehow still different than it should be, three) he can communicate but not how he should be able to, and four) he seems to be physically incapable of being away from Dean." Sam said that last bit with a mildly amused look on his face, which Dean did not especially appreciate.
i would love for y’all to give me feedback on it!! anyways enough w the self plug lmao pls enjoy the chapter
"I know I love you"—Dean choked a little at that—"and Jack 'n Sam. I know I used to be in Heaven but then Heaven was… not what we thought it was. It was doing bad things and you were good and taught me about free will and I wanted to be with you so I left. I remember meeting you 'cuz your soul is my favorite in the whole wide world even though we—we were in a bad place, where I saved you. Awful, terrible scary place. No place for a soul like you." Cas nodded to himself decisively.
what he thought the Empty would sound like. Actually, nothing about the Empty so far has been what Dean was expecting, but that’s not important. The sphere pulses as the words are emitted, loud and alien and dissonant.
Erin reached out and rested her hand on a blanketed bump, grabbing what she hoped was Cas’s shoulder to give it a little shake.
The reminder sent a fresh wave of nausea through Dean, and he convulsed in front of the toilet, spewing bile with a groan. God, this was fucking pathetic.
Huh. He thinks about that for a second, and he realizes Cas is right. "Yeah, I guess you have, haven't you?" Dean looks up at Cas and he's smiling.
Erin was well and truly baffled; so Dean and Castiel live with each other, are essentially raising a son together, and are both extremely attached to one another, yet Castiel believes Dean’s feelings are purely platonic? She began to wonder if there was more she was missing. She kinda wanted to meet Dean, see if maybe Castiel’s perspective on the situation is a little skewed.
. Dean tipped his head towards the ceiling and exhaled slowly, trying (and failing) to control his breathing. A burning sensation was expanding in his chest, creeping into his throat and behind his eyelids. Fists clenching and unclenching, he willed himself not to cry, or scream, or bash his head against the wall. All equally enticing options at the moment.
(a little anxious, but overall fine). Dean was pretty sure the wings were about as clean as they were gonna get; all he had left now was cleaning near the wounds and bathing Cas like a normal human. Very carefully, Dean rinsed out the gashes at the base of his wings with just water (he didn't want to get soap in the wounds), noticing the swelling had gone down significantly. They looked much better than earlier, the open skin already starting to heal.
Jack cooed and reached forward, putting a hand on the girl before Erin could pull him back. He touched her wrist, specifically a patch of skin that looked like it’d had some kind of symbol burnt into it, like a brand. It glowed and disappeared, as well as the blade previously sticking out of her guts, and immediately the girl sat up, eyes wide with fear, chest heaving with unsteady breaths. Erin let out an incredibly undignified yell/scream hybrid and scrambled backwards, startled out of her mind. The girl (zombie? reanimated corpse?) seemed equally horrified, cowering when Erin very hesitantly scooted an inch closer, morbid curiosity quickly overtaking her fear. She curled up, bringing her knees to her chest and raising her hands as she wailed, “No, no no no,
"Is there anything else I can do to help?" Sam asked, eyeing them with a mix of sympathy, pity, and concern.
"Look, I don't like this any more than you do, okay? I hate that we're doing this, actually, but I'm worried about you and this will hopefully help. I need you to work with me. Please." Something about his tone must've gotten through to Cas, because after a moment he stilled and went quiet.
"Couldn't he do that before, though? I thought Cas could read minds but he chose not to out of respect for privacy," Sam said, looking thoughtful. "Jack said he might not have full control of his grace. Maybe he doesn't know how to restrain himself, how to
“Dean, what happened?” she whispered, needing to know but still afraid to hear the response. Dean just made a noise like a wounded animal and shook his head. Her heart felt like it was going to explode in her chest as she approached them slowly, Jack still wiggling furiously in the carrier. When she got close enough to really
Erin smiled. “Yeah, like rain on your wedding day,” she half-said, half-sang to Cas, who just stared back blankly. He tilted his head.
"Alright, if you're sure. It's Dean's funeral." She shrugged before making a shallow cut underneath Dean's eye. An extremely embarrassing whimper escaped his lips—look, eye shit is just
At first, Erin couldn't even tell where Cas was. The lights had already been on when she entered the room, but she hadn’t actually seen him in there. She looked around, setting the bowls down carefully on the dresser.
"Hey, I'm gonna go call Eileen in my room while we've got some free time. Let me know when you're done cooking," Sam said as he left the kitchen, Dean merely grunting in response. He noticed Jack sitting at the kitchen table, staring into his lap with a lost expression on his face. A wave of guilt washed over him; the whole point of this was to cheer Jack up, and he'd totally forgotten about him.
Erin hummed agreeably through her lumpy bite of toast. She swallowed and licked some excess jam off her lips. "Do you want me to grab it for you so you can check?"
Sam nodded. "I sent her another message too after Jack told me about Cas acting sick. She hasn't responded though. Sorry, man."
Erin grimaced. “My plan to weaponize your overprotective boyfriend tendencies backfired like a motherfucker. This whole thing is mainly my fault, to be honest. I’m praying some good will come out of it otherwise I’m going to feel like the shittiest person alive for the rest of my life.”
"Well, good morning to you too, Jack. Nice of you to join us." She smiled at him, big and over-the-top, and turned back towards the bed. "Now that I've been properly threatened by all parties, shall we begin?"
"It doesn't matter to me. I loved Dean in the beginning, I'll love him at the end of the world, regardless of what he feels for me. I've accepted that I want something I can't have. I'm happy to just have a place in his life, in whatever capacity I can. Dean's already done so much for me. All he does is give and give and give. I could never ask him for more than what he freely offers." A burning sensation had crept into Erin's chest. This had to be some of the saddest, bleakest shit she’d ever fucking heard, and Castiel doesn’t even seem to realize it.
him, letting himself love someone that much, letting himself care about someone besides Sam with his whole heart. But terrified as he was, Dean couldn't help falling head over heels in love with Cas. He simply couldn't. And he didn't want to be afraid anymore.
“No. No, Dean did not. But I never expected him to.” Castiel smiled, though it looked more like a wince. “He expresses his emotions through actions more than words.”
“Well, I was gonna ask you to make pancakes but Sam told me to tell you that Rowena’s here, so you probably don’t have time to make breakfast. Once she leaves, maybe we can make pancakes then?”
“Just let me see him. I never even got to say goodbye, I-I didn’t get to say it back, you have to let me say it back, you
said anything? I—I don't… I don't understand it, man. How could you possibly—all the things I've done—and still?" Choking on his words, Dean just leaned against Cas helplessly, not even sure how to articulate what he wanted to say. Cas looked up sharply, pinning Dean with a surprisingly fiery glare.
Rowena gave Dean an exasperated look and rolled her eyes. "Don't twist my words, dearie, you know I meant no harm. Anyways, not that I don't immensely enjoy my time with you boys, but I do have other matters to attend to, if my services are no longer necessary?"
“So why is he reacting like he’s sick or in pain?” Dean asked, subconsciously cradling Cas closer as he let out a quiet whimper. Jack just shrugged helplessly, looking increasingly frustrated.
It’s Cas. There’s a residual glow around him, framing his face in a twisted imitation of a halo. He’s wearing plain black clothes, the dark streaky goo from his orb-metaphysical-form-thingy having turned to fabric, akin to the transformations of other elements. Dark jeans and a soft looking t-shirt, like he’s dressed for comfort. It’s so human, so
"I'm okay, but you can choose something if you'd like. Preferably nothing too loud, since Jack is sleeping."
"This is the crux of the problem: if he doesn't want me, this is obligatory. Prior evidence makes it hard to believe he wants me. Thus he is here with me out of responsibility, not desire. Not love, the way I love him." Cas rubbed the back of his hand against his face, worn down.
he thought, finally making his way to the kitchen. Jack was waiting for him at the table, eating a bowl of cereal.
Cas giggled, sitting dormant under the towel pile as Dean dried off his hair. Then he sneezed, all but confirming Dean's fears.
"Yeah, sure, go ahead." Dean was practically growling, eyes still fixed on Cas, not even sparing Erin a glance. He jabbed a finger at his chest. "You ‘nd me are going to have a quick little chat."
"You make me wanna have faith, y'know?" Dean steps back and pokes Cas in the chest, accentuating his words. "Maybe I don't have a lot of faith, but I'm workin' on it. I really am."
didn’t kill anyone. You didn’t make those choices. Someone else taking your body isn’t your fault, and things that happen that you didn’t consent to and had no control over aren’t your fault either. I know it’s hard but you can’t beat yourself up over this kinda stuff.”
Dean was staring out the window, hands in his pockets when Erin was struck with an idea. She turned her back to him and unlocked her phone, trying to multitask brewing the tea and pulling up her messages. Erin stole a quick glance at Dean, making sure he was still distracted before typing out a text to Cas.
Cas blushed but shook his head preemptively. “It was very kind of Dean to purchase something for me, but the action is in no way indicative of romantic intentions. Dean was simply being a good friend.”
"Y'know, at least us demons are willing to admit that we're monsters, that we're sick and twisted and what have you. Angels, though." She snorted in disdain. "Y'all are a different story. Your form is fucked to hell, and you walk around in this domestic-ass vessel, still pretending you're good, you're
True to his word, Castiel sent Erin pictures of Jack on a regular basis. She’d be behind the counter and feel her phone buzz in her pocket, screen lighting up with a notification.
Then Dean was in a warehouse, dead copies of himself littering the floor. Hundreds, maybe thousands, all lying lifeless on the ground. He heard a voice booming, "Again, Castiel. Do it again," and he looked at his hands. The right was gripping an angel blade, the left held a pseudo-Dean by the collar. He felt his mouth open, whispering, "I can't. Please, I can't do it anymore. Stop making me hurt him,
I mean, she’s, like, the one normal person we know. She doesn’t deserve to get saddled with our bullshit,” Dean grumbled under his breath, clearly not intending Erin to hear. Part of her bristled at being called a kid; she was in her early twenties, thank you very much.
him in the heart, after he risked his life to drag me kickin’ and screaming outta the Pit.” He didn’t know when he started crying but he could feel cold wetness on his face. He looked back down at Jack, his eyes also looking a little too shiny.
Dean doesn’t know how to respond. He pulls Cas’s hands away from his face, intertwines their fingers between them, and Cas sighs and bites his lip.
“Sam!” He stepped in front of Erin, onto what looked like a landing or balcony, long and curved to the shape of the walls. Erin craned her neck to catch a glimpse of the interior; it looked like they were standing at the top of a straight metal staircase, overlooking a massive room with some weird, slightly angular, glowy table in the middle. Dean leaned against the metal railing, breathing just slightly harder than normal, still clutching Cas to his chest. Erin could tell the strain of carrying a body for so long was definitely starting to take its toll.
Cas's head immediately perked up as though he sensed the change, and he reached for Dean's face for the third time before his hand was intercepted by Dean, who fixed him with a look that said
“In fact, I’ve been looking at some nearby listings for Jack and I. It’s not that I don’t appreciate the security of the bunker, but I can’t raise a child there. Jack deserves to live somewhere with windows and sunlight and a front porch, somewhere he can run around and make a mess and have play dates. I want him to have a normal childhood.” Erin nodded and made a silly face at Jack, who babbled happily.
His first mistake? Leaving. Period. It felt all wrong from the get-go. The instant Dean pulled out of Lebanon, the
“Uh, not really. I mean, he mentioned Purgatory but there’s no way he’s there. He—he was talking about when the angels fell, and how it was all his fault, and he got all worked up over it and—” Dean made a little flapping motion with his hand. “He just disappeared.”
“Still in a lot of pain. Don’t really know how much good stitching up his back will even do, but better safe than sorry, I guess.”
"Yeah, of course." Rifling through the cupboards, Jack pulled out a nice big pan and set it on the stovetop.
"You bastard, I felt really guilty there for a second. And I don't know, probably? Me making you soup after Dean made it right before he left is coincidental for sure, but ironic… I dunno. I guess it'd probably help if we listened to the song." Cas stirred his soup, clinking his spoon against the glass rim of the bowl. He swallowed a spoonful with a thoughtful look before turning to Erin.
The truth is it’s a revelation. It’s breaking free. It’s too much, it’s wholly overwhelming, it’s drowning in the shallow end of the neighborhood pool. More than anything, it’s coming home. Finally coming home.
“I love you,” he whispered, finishing off the last stitch. “I know it doesn’t make anything better, doesn’t fix anything. We still need to talk once you’re feelin’ up to it. Just want you to hear me. I really love you.” He put the needle and thread away and eased off the bed. His feet had barely hit the carpet when he felt Cas's fingers circling his wrist.
"Cas, what's with all the clothes?" He was genuinely curious but Cas must've interpreted his tone as angry because he immediately shrank on himself, curling around the shirt, chirps going even higher.
Dean rubbed a palm over his cheek, sighing. “Yeah, will do.” He looked at Erin, a strange expression on his face. “Uh, thanks for helping me get my head out of my ass. I don't know exactly what you were goin' for with the shit you pulled but maybe this'll help me and Cas finally work out some of our stuff. God knows we need it."
"This is only an estimate of course, but should you let it run its course naturally, Castiel will probably return to normal within a month at the latest. In fact, if you wait a couple days there's a good chance you'll get to see him as an older child."
"Yeah, okay, I get it," Dean said, holding back a laugh. "I'm tired too. Lemme hit the lights and we can go to sleep." He gently pushed Cas away so he could rise off the bed, only to get stopped with a "Dee," and a yank of his shirt. He turned around.
get feathers in my batter.” Swatting away the attacking wing, Dean accentuated his words by pointing the giant wooden spoon at Cas. “I won’t hesitate to chuck this at you, should push come to shove,” he threatened, glaring a little. He immediately felt bad when Cas legitimately flinched away, curling in on himself.
"We need to get you home, baby." Cas began to weakly protest but Dean firmly cut him off, placing his pointer finger against his pale lips. "No arguments. We can talk more about everything when we get back, okay? Promise." He looked at Erin.
"I'll explain it all in a minute. Sam, please tell me you remembered to get kid clothes while you were out."
"Don't worry. If anything goes wrong, the worst that will happen is Castiel will simply remain as he is and continue to develop the long way. My spell can only help." She smiled and ruffled Cas's hair, making him squawk. "Though I must admit, I do quite enjoy the angel in his wee form."
"Shh, honey, shh. I know, baby, I know how it feels. I just want him to come home too." A sniffle. "Hush, honey. It's gonna be okay. We just have to wait a bit, baby. Just have to be a little patient." He let out a gut-wrenching noise, something Erin could only describe as some intersection of laughing and choking.
Sam held up a bowl, filled with what looked like finely ground up leaves. "Yep, we're actually almost set to go. Just need to get a couple more things prepared."
"Hey, buddy. What's up?" Cas looked up at Dean, quiet and still, before worming his way under Dean's arm and dropping his head in his lap. Exhaling a small sigh, he closed his eyes and curled his knees up closer to his chest, body draped half on the seat and half on Dean.
“Apologies. I’m aware I walked in at the last minute, and I greatly appreciate your willingness to still accommodate me, despite the inconvenience.” Wow. His voice was not at all what she was expecting him to sound like. Insanely deep, almost unnaturally so. Erin looked at him suspiciously. She was still annoyed but he seemed legitimately sorry, and no customer had ever apologized for something like that before. Guess that’s just another thing Erin could add to the growing list of weird shit he does.
"Bet you feel better now, hmm? See, no big deal. Told you I'm always gonna take care of you." Dean kept walking down the hallway, holding the baby a bit closer. "Me 'n your daddy are gonna keep you safe, protect you, always. I know I haven't been so good at that lately but I'm gonna do better, promise. I'm gonna work for it, for you."
"Nice of you to drop by the kitchen before saying goodbye." It wasn't quite a whisper, but his voice carried quietly in a soft tone that didn’t match the sharpness of his words. "How considerate."
There was an awkward pause, followed by a reluctant nod. "I-I just don't want you to think it’s dumb," Cas whispered. "I know it’s not very good, not yet, but I want you to like it.”
oh no," to himself over and over again. His agitation seemed to warp the entire room, charging the molecules in the air until the tension became physically tangible. His wings were fluttering up a storm, faster and faster until it came to a head, and with a terribly familiar, tell-tale flapping noise, Cas was gone.
can't do that after criticizing Dean for the same thing. Woe unto you hypocrites and all that shit."
"Okay," Jasmine whispered, "okay." She answered Dean but her eyes were glued to Cas, who was obviously still hurting something awful. "I-I'm so sorry. I hurt y-you and killed him and I didn't want to but I couldn't s-stop it and I'm sor—"
The phone was right where Cas said it'd be, facedown on the little wooden table next to his pillow. Erin picked it up and hit the power button, causing the screen to light up with a couple notifications on the lock screen.
Cas finally turned his head and stared at Dean’s outstretched hand in surprise. Slowly but surely, he extended his hand and wrapped his own miniature pinky around Dean’s with a small smile.
"Dean? You in there?" Sam's muffled voice traveled through the door, startling Cas slightly. Scooping him up in one arm, Dean opened the door and was greeted by both Sam and Jack, standing with a handful of plastic grocery bags.
"Cas, this is me begging for something I don't deserve. I…" Dean swallowed, "I love you, man. Of course I love you. I'm sorry it took me this long to say it. And I understand if it's too late, I do—" Cas grabbed his face and pressed a thumb against his mouth.
Jack, to help him grow and become and thrive. Cas’s feelings about Jack were only rivaled in intensity by the way he felt about Dean, and even then, there was a tugging in his Grace, in the very essence of his being, that told him Jack needed to be protected first. In fact, thinking about Jack was one of the only things that made Cas feel angry, hostile even, towards Dean. The memories weren’t totally clear but he knew there was a deep, deep hurt when it came to Jack and Dean—a betrayal, something utterly unforgivable. But he couldn’t quite remember what it was, and he didn’t want to dwell on it, so he didn’t. For now, all he needed to know was that he loved both of them.
Cas sniffled into the collar of his shirt. “Me too. I just wanna stay with you.” He hiccuped. “Even if I don’t deserve it. That’s what I want.”
"Minutes later, I chose him over everything I'd ever known, and it changed my life. No going back. Everything that's happened since then has been a result of that choice. Choosing Dean was my first act of free will." He sniffed, rubbing at his nose. "In a way, I guess you could call that the beginning of the end for me."
"Um—" He took an unsteady breath and closed his eyes, brows smushing together in worry. "Dean is in trouble. A lot of trouble. I need to go to him, as soon as possible, and I can't take Jack with me."
Rowena rolled her eyes but retracted her arm. "Aye, calm yourself. You wanted me to check on his grace, see why he was acting sick, yes? That requires contact. Magic makes the rules, my dear boy, not me."
"Guess I'll just have to keep giving you something to believe in then, won't I?" He squeezes Dean's hand, and Dean just smiles and smiles and smiles. God, he's so in love.
Jack looked up from the pan and smiled, Cas tugging lightly on his ears. "Oh! This is the Man song from Mulan!" He began humming along, eyes returning to the pancakes. Dean was unfamiliar with the song but he also had to begrudgingly admit it wasn't half bad.
"Dean. I meant everything I said yesterday. I want to live outside the bunker with Jack, I want you to live with us, and there is a specific house I've been looking at for us to stay. I want that life with you. That's all I want, really. You and Jack, happy, with me. A home." Dean closed his eyes.
"Finally! There's the car," she said happily, reaching for the door handle. Instead of empty space, she was greeted by an unconscious Cas, awkwardly draped across the backseat, half his body on the cushion, the other half pressed against Dean, who'd startled at Erin's arrival. His gaze landed on Jasmine, and his face grew hateful, angry, fearful. He scrambled towards the other side of the truck, clumsily putting distance between them, and Cas moaned in pain.
"Yeah, I know, I know. It's just," Dean floundered for a second, "just really hard to drop hunting, go total hands off, y'know? Like I can't see something
"Jesus, Cas, where the hell did you go?" He bent down to pull him in for a hug, ignoring the freezing damp clothing between them. Fuck, he really was cold as hell. "We gotta get you warm and dry."
Dean felt Cas sigh against his chest. "Good. Get used to hearing it, Dean, because I'm going to keep saying it, keep telling you I love you until you stop fighting it, and then I'll say it even more. I've been waiting close to a decade for this, I have a lot of time to make up for." That rendered Dean breathless for a good few seconds. He looked down at Cas, eyes wide.
Before he could respond, Cas peeked his head out from behind Dean's arm, peering at the waitress with a low chirp. Her eyes dropped to Cas and her face lit up.
“Erin is my friend. I enjoy talking with her, and Jack likes playing with her. It’s nice to interact with people who aren’t involved in what we do.” Each word was slow and deliberate, and Cas's fists clenched at his sides as Dean grew increasingly bewildered and angry.
"Dean. You have to let Rowena see him," Sam said, sounding more than a little exasperated. Rowena smiled sweetly and held out her arms, the perfect picture of motherly instincts.
“Well, first of all I suppose it’s really less of a house and more like a bunker, if you will. There's an abundance of extra rooms and empty areas, so we each have plenty of space for ourselves. I try not to impose too much.”
"Cas, you don't have to be grateful. I told you, whatever you need, I'm gonna be here for you." She smirked. "I mean, what are friends for if you can't even rely on them to help prevent an incoming mental breakdown?"
"Gimme a second and I'll play it for you." Erin grabbed one of the bowls of soup and handed it to Cas before getting her own. "Eat first though. Sorry, it's probably cold by now," she said with a grimace. Cas just stared at the bowl, not moving.
i'm kinda nervous abt this chapter eee 🙈 but here ya go hope yall like it! also. if u saw me post this on accident two days ago no u didn’t <3
Erin woke up to the sound of Jack screaming his head off. The bones in her neck twinged as she rolled over on the couch cushions, trying to kick off the blankets she'd accidentally burritoed herself into. Shrieks and wails from Jack's room flooded the air, blasting through the walls like the soundtrack to a B-list horror movie.
"Not that I can tell," Jack said dejectedly. His pacing had slowed down, and he stopped at the table and pulled out a chair, sitting in defeat. "If it is, I'm not fluent."
"Mm, not so fast." Yanked backwards, Cas fell straight into Dean's waiting arms. "I didn't mean right this second. I wanna talk to you 'bout what we said yesterday first." Cas's stomach lurched violently.
It was Dean's biggest regret from that night. By the time Sam finally found him, he'd been sobbing for hours like a fucking baby on that stupid dungeon floor,
"I overreacted back there because the thought of you leaving scares the shit out of me. And then you said your piece and I panicked and lashed out because it was too much to hear all at once, that you want me and you want us to raise Jack together and live in our own house. But that's all I want, Cas."
But Cas sounded anything but devout. No, he sounded unimaginably desperate, like a man praying to a God he didn't believe in. Quietly unhinged, futilely convincing himself he has faith the same way someone convinces themself two plus two equals five. It was breaking Erin's heart.
As Dean took a closer look at Cas's wings, he realized they were covered in a film of viscera. Downy feathers had clumped together, sticky with congealed blood. He lifted up Cas's shirt very gently; sure enough, at the base of his wings were two nasty looking gashes. The skin around them looked swollen and irritated.
“I don’t know. Maybe the healing process is just painful? I’m sorry, Dean,” he whispered, tilting his gaze down to his shoes, “I wish I knew more but I don’t.”
), both of them were too exhausted from hunting and talking to do anything more than fall asleep. Jack was already sleeping in his crib when they finally came in from the garage, leaving them free to just change and slide under the covers.
—" Dean coughed as he scooped Cas into his arms. A thick red puddle had been growing underneath him, his broken body leaking blood and light. Hands shaking, he tried to remove Cas's trenchcoat as gently as possible. Two gashes had appeared on his back, soaking his clothes in blood, and even though Cas didn't appear to be burned anywhere, there was still an overwhelming stench of charred flesh.
"Oh yeah, the whole supernatural world knows about that. It's kinda impossible to miss a cosmic disturbance of that great of a magnitude. I mean, the flesh-and-blood kid of the literal motherfuckin’
I just," he sniffed, "I just got really overwhelmed. Whatever Cas did took a lot outta me, and I just—I just needed time to take all that shit in."
The man huffed amusedly. “Okay, yeah, that's perfect actually. He loves honey. Buys it fresh from one of the local farms whenever he gets the chance.” An extremely fond and mildly dopey look lingered in his eyes.
Dean planned to spend a day or so investigating, maybe another day scoping out the area if necessary, but since he’d prepared in advance he didn’t expect the job to take long. He got to the city, found a garage somewhere downtown and started walking. The area was far too urban for the usual Winchester motel fare so he splurged on a real hotel just a block away from the museum, with decent sheets and a cool view of the skyline.
Enough time passed for Dean to go back to his room, repack his bag, and walk back through the kitchen before Cas spoke again. His hand had just reached for the doorknob to the garage when he heard his voice, barely above a whisper.
not fucking cool. Dean felt a new kind of determination spark in him, kindled by his grief and anger. He was gonna save Cas, (he was always gonna save Cas, because Cas is his best friend and he fucking deserved to be saved,
The baby began babbling urgently, making grabby hands at Dean, who looked like he’d been struck dumb by God themself. Erin swallowed, half expecting to get yelled at by Dean for bringing Jack into what looked like a scene from some freaky occult movie. It’s not like it was even her fault; still, knowing Dean, she wouldn’t put it past him to blow up at her, especially given how… clearly unwell he was at the moment.
“Sweetpea, you know I can’t understand you,” she sighed. Jack closed his mouth and squinted at Erin, and a second later she felt some kind of tugging—actually, no, it was less like being pulled and more like being pushed, propelled forward by some unseen force. She stumbled forward in shock and stopped about a foot away from the presumably dead girl; Erin didn’t know much about injuries but even she knew that your spine is
“Dean. There’s nothing to talk about. She’s just a good friend. When I drive into town we see each other and catch up. Sometimes the bunker is… lonely.”
Dean could hear his dad saying those words, almost verbatim. Drilled into his mind over years and years of growing up hunting.
” In that moment, it struck her that she really did absolutely adore and cherish Jack, and that she really was lucky to have met Cas. They’d both become a weirdly big part of Erin’s life, somehow carving themselves a little spot in her heart, worming their way into her existence and making it a billion times better.
“You’re real?” he whispered, so softly, so hesitantly. God, he still sounded absolutely terrified. Dean bit his lip and forced himself to be still as Cas ran his fingers against his face, touching his nose, his chin, his eyelashes.
"Ok, I'm good to go too." The brothers turned and looked at Jack, in the middle of dipping his fries in some ketchup. Slowly realizing they were waiting for him, he hurriedly ate the rest and gave a thumbs up.
. This took the fucking cake. She focused on Jack now asleep in her arms, trying to push down the lump that had been stubbornly rising in her throat.
Then there’s an awful screeching noise, and Dean doubles over, pressing his palms over his ears. Something flashes in front of him, and suddenly there’s a—a
"Hey, guys. What'd you buy?" Sam started to respond but Jack stayed frozen on the spot, eyes fixed on Cas's wings. "Dean?" he asked quietly, interrupting Sam, "What… what happened? What did Rowena do?" Jack's tone grew increasingly distressed, which confused Dean.
Red spread across Cas's face as his cheeks flushed in embarrassment. He smiled at the ground, blushing like—well, like a kid. Dean found it unfairly endearing.
When Dean finished undressing him, Cas basically attempted to tackle him, wrapping his limbs around Dean's chest before he could be put in the tub. Dean tried to shake him off, which just prompted Cas to start wailing like a banshee before launching into a series of rapid-fire “Dee, Dee, Dee”’s, on the brink of hyperventilating. It was pure torture to listen to, and Dean couldn’t help feeling guilty before trying to place him in the bath again.
"Y'know, I always thought that after Hell my soul was tainted. Irredeemable. Damaged goods. There was no way I could do all the—the
“No, I do not, in fact, ‘know how it is,’ but I will take your word for it.” The air quotes make Dean smile, even with the sick, empty feeling that followed him out of Stull. He steps out of the car, dry yellow grass crunching under his feet as he opens the back door and waits for Cas to get out. He’s still holding his nose as he slides off the seat, and Dean frowns.
even. "Dee," he squeezed Dean a little tighter, "Dee." It seemed as though somehow his name had replaced the majority of Cas's chirps and hums. Dean had absolutely no idea how to feel about that.
of a demon dying was drowned out by a harsh screech that seemed to come from Cas, despite his mouth being closed. A wave of raw power pulsed from his body, pushing Dean up against the column and throwing Jasmine across the room, where she hit the wall with a sickening
“But why are you getting worse?” Dean murmured, more to himself than to Cas. “I get why you’re not healing, but it’s like the pain just keeps increasing. I don’t understand it. I don’t know how to help you.”
Dammit. It really was just Erin's luck that she'd accidentally choose to make the one dish that would remind him of Dean. She turned to Cas, about to apologize profusely when he hummed lightly.
Dean woke up in a dim room, head throbbing like a motherfucker. He groaned as soon as he opened his eyes, and his vision swam in front of him. It looked like he was in a warehouse of some kind; definitely abandoned, with broken windows and only a couple working lights and a thin layer of dust blanketing the entire floor.
Dean's nose released another stream of blood, gushing sticky and hot against his swollen upper lip. He groaned in pain and grit his teeth, swallowing the thick iron taste coating the inside of his mouth.
"I-I understand," Dean mumbles into the curve of Cas's collarbone. He sniffles, and then there's a hand on the back of his neck, and an arm around his waist, and Cas is pulling him in even tighter. Words are trying to claw their way out of his chest but he can’t say them and it burns, the way his lungs are in tatters and shreds.
Castiel looked at Jack, some undefinable emotion dancing across his face. “Even if Dean did want a family, he wouldn’t want it with me. And I can’t condemn him for it, he deserves more than what I can offer. It would be selfish of me to ask him to indulge my silly fantasy of playing house.” He paused. Jack sniffled in Erin’s arms, and she wanted to cry.
"Promise? 'Cause you don't have me convinced, not even a little bit." At that, Cas exhaled shakily and finally looked up at Dean.
Shirt still lifted up, Dean brushed his fingers over the agitated wounds, light as a feather. They were hot to the touch; again, not a good sign. Cas hissed and shuddered at the contact, digging his fingers into Dean's shoulders. If he was at all phased by the physical nature of his wings, he didn't show it.
Jack smoothed out his picture with a smile before standing up, leaving the paper on the floor as he joined Sam. "Dean, did you and Cas wanna come too?"
Propped on his elbows, Dean moved to get out of bed and froze. His room looked like it had been torn apart by a tornado.
"Dude, stay in the car!" An indignant hiss sounded from the backseat, complete with a couple of angry chirps. Dean had just manhandled Cas into the Impala, shoving him next to Jack. He tried shutting the door but something caught his collar as he turned, yanking him into the back. Cas firmly grasped his shirt, anchoring Dean like a cement block with his angelic super strength.
Jack just gave her a sad look, cheeks flushed, face set in a semi-permanent pout. He put his head on Erin’s shoulder with a soft gurgle and stuck his thumb in his mouth, tiny breaths hot against her neck.
"It's okay, sweetheart. Shh, you're okay. You're okay." Dean was whispering shakily into Cas's ear, his head nestled into the hollow of his neck. Cas clung onto him tightly, face streaked with tears. It'd only been ten or so minutes since Jack had walked out of the kitchen, but Cas had still somehow managed to get drastically worse in the short period of time.
“You shortened my name. To Cas.” It was a statement, not a question, and Erin wasn’t really sure how to respond. She shrugged sheepishly, eyes downcast as her embarrassment kept her from meeting Castiel’s gaze.
"So, any news from Dean this morning?" Erin asked, pulling out one of the kitchen chairs before reaching over the table for her toast. Cas pursed his lips and shook his head. He sat down across from Jack, armed with a little bitty baby spoon and the jar of mush.
hi yall!! guys i can't believe ive been writing this for 3 months omg.. when i started this fic i meant it to be like maybe 15k max and i rly didn't expect ppl to read it lol but u guys have all been so kind n encouraging so thank u thank u thank u for sticking w me ❤️ as always thank u sm for reading, hope u liked the chapter :D if u want pls leave a comment i love seeing what yall have to say <3 also idk how soon i'll get it done but coming up next chapter - dean and cas take on the grocery store 🛒
“Got it. How ‘bout you, sweetheart?” She turned to Jack, who blushed fiercely, red spreading from his cheeks to his ears.
"Yeah, I'll take a plate. Thanks, kiddo," he said, smiling weakly but with genuine gratitude. He sat on the bench, scooting next to Jack, while Cas quickly climbed up his leg and stationed himself on Dean's lap with a happy hum. He was still repeating 'Dee' about every thirty seconds for no discernible reason other than he simply liked saying it, which freaked Dean out just a little bit.
“Yeah, dude,” Dean said lightly. He gave Cas’s shoulder a little nudge before sticking out his hand, raising his pinky above the rest of his fingers.
hi guys!!! this has been my fav chapter so far n im rly excited to post it so i rly hope yall like it too :D
"Yeah, of course, Cas. Why the hell do you think I'm here if not to help? I'm almost offended you even asked." She reached into the crib, directing a playful smirk towards Cas.
Dean narrowed his eyes, brows furrowing; his expression shifted from pissed off and mildly offended to intensely sad, looking at Cas with something like guilt. He brought his hands up from Cas's shoulders, cupping his face for the second time that night. Cas silently leaned into it; he didn't trust himself to say anything more, not with the lump still rising in his throat.
my family. I was merciless. I single-handedly massacred hundreds of my siblings, and every other angel that’s died since the Apocalypse has met their fate in some part due to me. They should all hate me.” He shifts his head, looks up at Dean, pale. He’s staring at Dean like he’s expecting judgement, like he’s expecting Dean to agree and condemn him too.
His face does that adorable scrunching thing, that thing where he gets all squinty and his nose gets twitchy and he looks
Castiel slowly raised his head, meeting Erin’s gaze with weary blue eyes. She got the sense that he still didn’t quite believe her, so she powered on. “Don’t worry about Jack, either. Sure, it’d be hard at first, but he’d be alright without Dean. He has you.” Erin tilted her chin downwards again, Jack still resting silently in her arms. She couldn’t help feeling she was holding something immeasurably precious. “Your love is more than enough.” Erin heard Castiel's breath hitch, but she didn't dare look up, resolutely focused on the baby.
look back, just for a moment, and that's even worse. Because they see you and still choose to let you drown."
“Actually, I think you may have just changed my mind. What’s your name?” Dean flashed her a smile and she exhaled in relief, giving him an extremely grateful look.
“It’s okay, Cas. It’s just my clothes, I don’t care. You’re more important.” Dean frowned. “Wait, why aren’t you using your grace? I thought angels weren’t affected by temperature, can’t you just dry yourself off?”
Dean's frown deepened. He hated to think that Cas had been in such bad shape without him even knowing about it. The fact that he could also pop in and out at will again made Dean's gut roil with anxiety. He leaned against the table, stressed and worn out, before he felt a tug on his flannel.
“But I just fucked up so bad. I fucking told him Jack wasn’t his son. God, I don’t even know why I said that. Cas is one of the best fathers I’ve ever seen, he loves Jack so much and Jack loves him. Of course that’s his son. Fuck.”
"What the fuck did you do? I swear to God, Rowena," Dean growled, "I will fuck you up beyond recognition if you don't fucking fix this."
“Hey, Cas,” she said softly, squeezing him a little tighter. It was a little awkward, what with Cas being significantly taller than Erin, but somehow they managed to make it work. He dropped his head to her shoulder with a shuddering exhale.
Cas smiled, apparently pleased with whatever it was he did, and promptly resumed lightly butting his head against Dean's shoulder, not unlike a cat looking for pets.
"Okay sunshine, we're finally done. C'mere, I'll get you dried off." He let go of Cas, allowing him to turn around and bury his face in Dean's collarbone with a happy chirp. He hung from his neck as Dean stepped over the rim of the tub, careful not to slip on the tile.
"Thanks, Dean," Cas said shyly, looking up at Dean the same way a flower looks to the sun. His wings flared out behind him, feathers puffing up slightly, and Dean smiled.
Erin nodded sympathetically, although in all honesty she was still hopelessly confused as to what Dean's job actually was. Cas kept referring to it as 'hunting', which, okay, fine. That's normal enough, except Erin had never seen any kind of typical hunting gear around the house. Yeah, she'd seen a few guns, a couple knives, but none of them were the kind that people typically use to hunt. There weren't any trophies either, no furs or meat, and she'd never even heard Dean and Cas talk about what exactly they hunt. It was all very… cryptic, and vague, and just barely weird enough that if Erin thought about it too much she would
Even though all Dean wanted to do was close his eyes and melt back into Cas’s touch, he forced himself to sit up. Cas frowned and chirped with disapproval but helped push him upright anyways, his tiny body supporting the majority of Dean’s weight. He groaned, eyes shut tight as he tried to remember what exactly had happened. They were drawing, then Cas had a mini freak out, then he did a weird overwhelming mojo thing to Dean, then he tried to say Dean's name, then all these events culminated in Dean breaking down so bad he passed out in the middle of a crying session…? Yeah, unfortunately that sounded right.
"I need to feel—feel useful, okay? I need to feel like I'm doin' something that keeps someone alive, safe for another day." Raising his eyes to meet Cas's, he tried to convey how much he wanted this.
“Damn, Cas, you really need to go shopping,” she muttered to herself, moving on to the pantry. Erin surveyed the shelves, picking through pastas and cereal and canned fruits. A few cans of Campbell soup lined the bottom shelf, and she grabbed one of the chicken alphabet noodle types. Erin was a pretty bad cook but she figured if there was an item not even she could fuck up, it would be canned soup. Plus it makes for good comfort food, and Cas could clearly use some of that.
Cas nodded grimly and craned his neck back a little so he could see Dean. They spent the next few seconds exchanging a series of Looks; Erin had no idea what they could possibly be trying to communicate to each other, but it was obvious they were quite literally having a whole ass conversation with their eyes. Eventually Dean sighed and looked away.
"Why'd he get his wings back, though? And his grace was depleted when he got taken, why is he all mojo-ed up now?"
Erin couldn't help but be disappointed he didn't misspell her name. She took her eyes off the screen and glanced at Cas, who wore a very self-satisfied smug expression. A smile stubbornly spread across Erin's face as well.
“It was selfish to go on that last hunt. It got you hurt and it coulda got Jack and Erin hurt too. I was bein’ stupid and reckless and it put the people I love in danger and that’s not okay.” He went quiet as he stabbed through Cas’s skin, moving along the ragged edges of the cut. The muscles underneath his fingertips tensed up with each poke, and he paused every few seconds to squeeze Cas’s hand, rub the back of his neck, give him something to focus on besides the pain. Something to let him know Dean saw he was hurting, and that he cared, and he was sorry, and he loved him.
A splash of water to the face was enough to jolt Dean out of his nostalgic moping. He looked back at the tub to see Cas literally
Suddenly, Dean felt another hand grab the other side of his face, squishing his cheeks slightly. Cas pulled his face close to his until their foreheads were touching, making a scrunched-up expression like he was expending a lot of effort. He hummed again, eyes tightly closed. His hands grew warmer.
hi guys!!! im rly sorry i meant to update this earlier but i’ve been crazy busy so thanks for waiting <3
"Um, maybe?" Erin cringed. "I'm pretty sure Jesus said the thing about hypocrites, right?" If her memories from Sunday school served her right, anyways. She wasn't really religious but she'd gone to church with her mom at least a couple times, so she thought she deserved a little credit.
“Dean. Breathe.” And he’s trying to but he genuinely can’t, and then Cas is pushing him away and Dean seizes up because
Cas stood next to Dean, one arm still wrapped around his pants leg. He kept yanking on his shirt, trying to get Dean to bend down. Dean sighed and dropped to a squat. "Hey, little man. What's up?"
does he sound like a twelve year-old girl. Then Cas is smiling even wider, and he’s leaning towards Dean with happy eyes, and Dean is breathing again.
"Well, at least you boys can be sure Castiel is still an angel. Not many creatures have juice like that anymore." Rowena bent down to get a better look at Cas, who had retreated behind Dean and was currently using his legs as a shield. He had to fight the urge to laugh when Cas honest-to-God hissed at Rowena, like some feral animal, before hiding behind his knees again.
Cas, who he can’t look at without hearing Sam’s words loop over and over again in his head, crackling through his thoughts like a bad intercom system from some podunk high school.
Erin’s seen this guy before. In a town this small and remote, faces become familiar pretty quick. He was easily recognizable; every time Erin saw him, he was wearing the same ugly ass trenchcoat. It was especially strange because he didn’t wear it with a suit like one would expect. The dude would walk in wearing jeans and an AC/DC shirt, sweatpants and another t-shirt, slacks and a button-up, all complete with the trenchcoat on top. Hell, he’d even worn it with flannel once. It was just kinda bizarre.
you, c'mon sweetheart, come back to me—" He hiccuped, throat feeling raw and flayed, but he couldn't stop talking. "Cas, I love you, I
he choked out, about two and a half octaves higher than normal. His gaze immediately lowered to her chest—which in any other situation,
Aw, hell. Dean can feel his cheeks going warm, and he has to look away before he does something stupid like grab Cas by the neck and kiss him on the mouth. He clears his throat and walks forward, hauling himself up onto Baby’s hood. Cas watches, looking uncertain, so Dean pats the spot next to him as guidance. The car dips as Cas shimmies on inches away from Dean, and they both lean back towards the sky.
Jack sniffled pitifully against Erin’s shoulder, a couple fat tears rolling down his cheeks and soaking through her sleeve. Erin was honestly impressed he had any left to cry; the last two hours had consisted of Jack wailing and sobbing, kicking at her when she held him but grabbing her hair when she tried to put him down, inconsolable no matter what she did. It was utterly baffling. She was beginning to understand why Cas had acted as desperately as he did earlier.
Erin watched, mildly unsettled but mostly just curious. This wasn't new behavior; there were a couple occasions where she'd noticed Cas acting… weird about his body. Almost like it wasn't his own sometimes.
“Castiel.” Huh. Weird ass name for a weird ass guy. Erin was not in the mood to try and figure out how the fuck that was spelled, so she just went with ‘CAS’ instead. She doubted the man would even notice she abbreviated his name, much less be offended by it.
"Shh, it's okay, baby," Dean whispered, scooping him up and out of the crib. "I got you, gonna make it better, 'kay? Everything's okay." He let one of the blankets rest on his shoulder, acting as a pillow for Jack. Cradling his head against his upper chest, Dean held Jack close, lightly bouncing him as they moved towards the kitchen.
Cas chirped somewhat dismissively and snuggled closer, clearly uninterested in moving. His wings flapped a couple times before bending to cover Dean's arms like a feathery bear hug.
"Anyways, guess me being extra prepared with the holy oil ended up paying off. I didn't want things to have to come to this, but it looks like you're forcing my hand. I'm gonna give you one more chance to save your sweetheart." Jasmine whipped out the knife from earlier and sauntered over to Dean, placing the tip right under his chin. She twisted around so she could face Cas. "Gimme the nephil's location, or he" she jerked her head towards Dean, "dies in front of you. Your choice, halo."
Cognitively, Dean knew she was right. Sometimes for shit to work, you just gotta do what you gotta do. However, Dean had never been one to think with logic over emotions, and he wasn't about to start now.
"Wanna put on something? Having stuff in the background helps keep me awake sometimes," Erin suggested, reaching for the TV remote on the floor. She grabbed it and held it towards Cas, who shook his head.
“Shh. You’re so good, Dean. Always been so good.” Cas squeezed his hand weakly, head beginning to roll in Dean’s lap. “Love you so much. Nothing else ever mattered, nothing can change that. You,” he placed his free hand on Dean’s chest with a pained shudder, “you have my heart, y’know? Never gonna leave you, ‘cause my heart belongs with you, beloved, always. Promise.”
They'd been in the new house for a couple weeks now, and for the most part it's been domestic bliss. Dean made a list of all the things needing repairs and was slowly but surely knocking them out; Cas went grocery shopping with Jack during the day, visiting the Starbucks regularly as well. They still spent a lot of time at the bunker; Sam was working on making a kind of hunter network, so Dean and Cas would help scour the internet and news for cases Sam could delegate to other hunters. Things were good, really good.
Dean tried to wrap his head around what Rowena said. "So what I'm hearing is the Empty put Cas's grace through a strainer?"
She peeled herself away from the wall and moved quickly towards the door, a new burst of fear and adrenaline assaulting her with each step. Thank God Cas had one of those baby carriers, the ones that strap to your chest so you can be hands-off, on a hook next to the door. It was more than a little big on Erin, and she had to yank the straps tight to keep it from falling off her, but after a few minutes she figured it out. By some goddamn miracle, she managed to wrangle the carrier on without dropping Jack, and took a second to get him situated in it. As soon as she was sure he was secure, she threw the door open and rushed down the front steps, irrationally afraid that something would stop her at the last second, snatch her and Jack away from freedom. Relief flooded Erin like she’d never felt before, but the peace only lasted for a moment. Jack had started sobbing again, arching his back against Erin’s chest like he wanted to turn back around.
“No, they have no idea I’m planning on moving out eventually. I don’t want them feeling like they need to help me with the process or thinking I’m not grateful for their hospitality.” The corners of his mouth downturned slightly. “I’m also worried about how Dean will react. He takes things very personally and I know I’ve hurt him in the past by abandoning him. I don’t want him to blame himself for my departure, or feel like me moving out means I’m leaving him as a friend.” Ah. Abandonment issues. Based on what she’s already heard about Dean, somehow Erin’s not surprised.
It only took a couple seconds of intense self-loathing for Cas to catch on and do something. Really, Dean should've known better than to assume he would ever give up on him. He suddenly found himself with a lapful of angel, Cas clambering over his outstretched legs with an air of righteous determination.
"You know what's not fair? Telling me you want this, then running away from it. Lying to my face. Promising to be here when you fully intended to leave." There was a bite to every syllable, each word meant to pierce just a little bit. Dean felt his chest constrict.
"Okay," Dean exhales. "Okay, I can work with that." There's an inexplicably happy feeling bubbling in his chest, and he's almost giddy with relief. Cas is back and he's going to stay. Cas is going to stay. He ducks his head, hides his smile in Cas's shoulder.
Well. That certainly didn't happen. Cas had been so many things Dean could lose count trying to remember them all. He'd fallen, became Heaven's most wanted, played God, became an amnesiac, gone certifiably insane, been mind-controlled, turned human, even let himself be fucking
The only relief was that Dean could feel Cas's temperature slowly but surely dropping back to normal. By the time he turned off the water, they were both shivering a little, skin gone clammy. It was worth it though, if it meant Cas was okay. Definitely would've been nice if they could've just used some kinda angelic acetaminophen, Dean thought, but oh well.
into his flesh, tearing through inches of muscle, absolutely mutilating his skin. She sank to her knees next to them, hand shaking as she reached out towards Cas.
“Oh, oh no, don’t cry, please don’t cry, Cas—” He drops the box and hurries to his feet, wrapping his arms around Cas. Then they’re falling back down, Cas sagging against Dean with his whole body and Dean too unprepared to keep them standing upright. “Shh, m’sorry Cas, please don’t cry sweetheart, I take it back, okay? I take it back—”
"Thank you, love. I know this is hard for you. It's a big adjustment, and I'm proud of you for trying as much as you do." A pang of guilt flared in Dean's gut, sour and acrid. He didn't deserve Cas's praise or understanding, not when he still planned to go on that hunt.
this, I chose him, and he refuses to see it that way. It's terribly ironic given all these years we've done what we do in the name of free will, only for him to not respect mine." He smiled but it was strained, pained. Erin decided it was not a good look for Cas and that she'd do whatever she could to keep it off his face.
lost her mother, because of Cas’s choices. And he’d torn apart Dean’s family, over and over again. How could he deserve a family when he’d only ever destroyed them?
“Shh, shh, it’s okay, Cas. It’s okay. I’m gonna fix you up. Shh, baby.” Dean’s voice cracked on the last syllable, and Cas felt it like a stab to the heart. He knew he was hurting Dean, with the moaning and the sweating and the shaking, but he genuinely couldn’t help it. He tried swallowing down the whimpers that arose in his throat as Dean laid him on the bed, flat on his stomach, but there were definitely a couple that escaped. Tears were already prickling behind his eyelids, and he bit his lip in angry desperation. Why couldn’t he be stronger? He was trying so hard to keep it together for Dean, but in the end he knew he was too weak, and it was killing the both of them.
Erin had no idea how Cas still managed to blindside her with his impromptu admissions of love and mild insanity, and yet. Here she was. Rendered absolutely speechless, again. One day she was gonna make Cas recount their whole history to her, in detail, because
"Look, you're making a good effort. Really, you are," Jasmine said sympathetically, right before stabbing Dean in the bicep. He yelled, much to her delight, and Cas just grew paler, face ghostly in the fire's light. "Face it, feathers. You're no match for a demon like me. Shit, you're barely an angel anymore."
“I want to buy it but I'd need Dean's help with the down payment and I haven't told him I've even been considering moving out yet. I want to ask him to come with Jack and I; the house is big enough and it's still close to Sam and the bunker but it's not so close that we're isolated from the rest of town and it's a bit of a 'fixer upper' but I know Dean enjoys taking on those kinds of project and I'm scared, Erin. I'm scared this might not be the right thing for Jack. I'm scared I'll lose Dean. I'm scared I'm making a mistake.”
now. They go grocery shopping together, and Dean’s teaching Cas how to drive so he can take himself to the library whenever he wants, and every couple of weeks they grill burgers and eat with Miss Macy, the sweet old lady who lives next door.
The man snorted. “Yeah, I got that, Sherlock. What I meant was”—he motioned behind Dean—“care to explain the tagalongs?”
It’s hard to see with just the light of the moon, but Dean thinks he barely catches Cas blushing. “No, but it is a rather spectacular coincidence. Perhaps I have been unknowingly adding a signature to my work.” His voice is so fond, so uncharacteristically shy, and Dean can’t stop thinking about how much he doesn’t want this to end. He hears Sam in his head again, like a message from the gods—
you, to be responsible for it. It was a gut reaction." His voice drops, coated in something like shame. "I think I somehow recognized the too full sensation, what it's like to be filled beyond capacity, and instinctively pushed everything out. I couldn't do it again."
Interesting. The plot thickens. “Does Dean help take care of Jack, or do he and Sam just kinda try to stay out of your way?”
As soon as the batter blobs started bubbling, Dean whipped out a spatula and nudged Jack out of the way, distracted and singing along. "Watch 'n learn, kid." He expertly scooped and flipped each pancake, smooth and clean. "Next batch, you can flip."
were the dream, that you never came back for me, that I was gonna be stuck there forever.” Cas faltered, sniffled. “It said that you—you don’t love me. That I’m stupid for thinking anything different. It’s wrong though, right?” He sniffled again. “Right?”
Yeah, Dean felt a little bit like that now. Totally cracked open, extremely lost, saved only by the mercy and grace of his own personal Jesus, his best friend, his angel. Cas continued to hold his cheek in one hand, humming softly, staring at him like he was the only thing that mattered. Dean's lip started to tremble.
Erin nodded. “Okay, we’ll stand by the door until you’re ready.” Jasmine opened her door and began walking towards the entrance immediately, carrying a still-sleeping Jack against her chest. Erin lingered in the truck, eyeing Dean as he clearly struggled to get out of the car with Cas limp in his arms.
“Aw, c’mere sweetpea,” she said, taking Jack into her arms. “Let’s go sit down, hmm?” Erin walked them over to the living room, where she promptly plopped down on the couch, letting herself sink into the plush cushion.
“Glad we got that settled,” Dean grumbled, still mildly unhappy that they’re turning to Rowena at all. Rationally he knew she was their best shot; he just hated the thought of Cas at her mercy, at anyone’s mercy, really. In his kid form Cas just seemed so much more vulnerable. Dean kinda just wanted to keep him wrapped up in his t-shirt and tuck him away, safe from angel blades and witches and cosmic entities of doom and black goo.
"Okay," he repeats, and he’s horrified at the way his voice trembles, the way his fists shake where they’re clenched in Cas’s shirt.
in the tub." Dean grinned and poked Cas in his side, provoking a disgruntled chirp and a feathery smack upside the head. The angel was sitting on the kitchen counter, wings draped over the side, watching over Dean as he mixed a huge bowl of batter. “Hey! Do
Clearly sensing a change, Cas ducked his head and tensed up, averting his eyes. "Sorry, I know hearing this makes you uncomfortable but I had to say it. That's how I feel and you deserve to hear it," he whispered. Dean could tell he was bracing himself for a negative reaction; seeing him expect Dean to be upset felt like a punch to the gut. Goddammit.
She peered over the edge of the couch and could just barely make out Cas standing next to the crib, lightly pressing his mouth to Jack's forehead. It looked like his shoulders were vibrating, the way they trembled, violent but suppressed as much as possible. Jack continued to sob into Cas's chest, pausing every few seconds to take a huge breath before screaming again.
Appearing to be a little lost, Jack frowned. "She didn't answer my question," he mumbled, grabbing a nugget. Dean shoved a handful of fries into his mouth before saying anything back.
him, and I was a goner. Even then, he somehow knew I had a weak spot for him, couldn't tell him no."
“How long?” Fuck. He sounded so sad, so hopelessly resigned. Dean shuddered and tightened his grip on the knob, fighting the overwhelming urge to turn around and run right back to Cas.
"So, here's my train of thought—your precious Castiel is somehow connected to the nephil, in a good way. At the very least, I think he knows where it is. Honestly, I'm pretty sure you know where it is too, but I highly doubt there's anything I could do to get you to spill. Your angel though… '' Jasmine licked her lips.
"We just have to have a little faith, honey, that's all. We can have faith in Daddy, isn't that right, Jack? We have faith."
"You like? Got it done as soon as I went topside and took this sweet piece of ass for a ride. I realized this one's a real keeper, and bam. Sealed myself in. I can't be expelled from the vessel. You can try if you want, of course. Gotta warn you though—it's hardly even a tickle for me, but it's pretty fucking excruciating for the poor bitch in the backseat." Jasmine—no, the demon's grin made Dean want to hurl. He couldn't help thinking about the girl that must be trapped in there with it, desperate for escape from her own mind, her own body.
"I'm so sorry, sunshine. I promise it's gonna get better, just gotta give it time. I'm sorry." Then Dean hooked his hands under Cas's arms and pulled him away from his chest, turning him so he'd be sitting forward on Dean's lap. Cas, unsurprisingly, was
He'd watched the people he loves die over and over again—he'd seen Charlie bloody in a bathtub, Sam impaled through his spine, Cas literally fucking exploded by the Devil himself, and yet. Something about his best friend, the love of his life, thinking that Dean had
“Okay, here’s your tea. Have a nice day, hope your friend feels better soon.” Dean blushed again at the mention of his friend.
"Dee." He looked up at Dean expectantly, like he was waiting for him to lead the way. When he failed to do anything but stay still, trying to collect himself, Cas took charge and began walking. He pulled Dean along behind him, saying his name and looking over his shoulder every few seconds as he directed them to the kitchen.
That was a relief to hear. "Is this gonna happen again, as the grace keeps healing itself?" Dean didn't know if he had it in him to go through that shit more than once, especially when he knew it was much, much worse for Cas.
"Sorry, Cas. I didn't mean to ruin your… space. Here, let me fix it." Dean reached towards the shirts but Cas yanked his pinky, hard, and he stumbled back onto the bed. Cas started frantically gathering the disorganized shirts, hoarding them close until he was almost buried in them. Again, Dean was so fucking confused.
"That's not even true, Dean. I've seen the sketches and illustrations in your journals, and they're really good." Dean's face flushed as he looked away from Jack's sincere expression. He looked so much like Cas sometimes.
Why, I couldn't believe my pretty peepers." She laughed harshly and blinked, eyes flashing jet-black. Dean didn't even flinch. It was all just routine, cliche and unimpressive theatrics, really.
"I could do this all day," Dean quipped with a wincing grin. The knife slashed through his collar and he grunted, biting his tongue to keep from screaming. He wasn't about to give the demon bitch that kind of satisfaction, no sir.
“Jack really likes you.” Erin felt her cheeks flush. “I’m serious. You’re really good with him. He’s not a fussy baby but he’s normally a lot less comfortable with people he’s unfamiliar with. Usually Jack doesn’t let anyone besides me hold him without putting up a fight, except for Dean.”
"Hey, sunshine," Dean said quietly, gently running his fingers through Cas's hair. He hoped he found the sensation grounding; Dean didn't want Cas waking up startled or disoriented. He might not be able to soothe him with grace but this was about the closest substitute he could offer.
"Did you say something to him?" Jack's question was exactly that—genuinely just a question, but Dean couldn't help hearing an accusation in there.
Cas sat in the middle of his circle of shirts, emitting a high and piercing noise as he stared at the circle's perimeter. Dean slowly realized that by moving the covers, he'd totally messed up one of the sides of Cas's clothing barrier, causing the shirts to shift out of place.
The ground disappears from underneath Dean and he’s falling, tumbling headfirst into full-blown panic mode, because holy
hi guys!!! first of all i definitely meant to get this chapter out sooner but i've been p busy helping a friend move the past week so sorry abt that!!! i probably should've cleaned it up more bc it's kinda all over the place tbh lol but i felt bad abt taking so long to update :/ also ik this was SUPER dialogue heavy, next chapter will move the plot along significantly tho i promise!! as always thank u sm for reading, pls lmk what yall think or if u have any feedback, i love reading ur comments :D
impossibly intense feelings. His lungs struggled for air as his entire being was crushed, smothered by the enormity of sensation. He was screaming, crying, getting ripped apart by things too big for him to comprehend.
as he quietly whispered, “Oh, Dean. It’s okay, beloved, I’m right here. I’m right here. You have me, Dean.”
“Jesus Christ.” Dean was breathless, paralyzed as a hand snaked its way out of the coat’s many folds, gently reaching out to grip Dean’s shoulder. He turned his head to watch Cas’s palm rest against the bloody handprint, suppressing a shudder as he couldn’t help remembering the last time Cas had grabbed him there. Now, Cas’s hand barely covered a third of the stained outline.
Apparently laundry time in the Winchester household takes place during the middle of the night, because that's what Erin found herself doing at 11 pm, criss-cross-applesauce on the floor of Cas's bedroom, sorting through a warm pile of clothes fresh from the dryer.
“Cas, that—that’s not okay, man. You gotta take care of yourself.” He didn’t respond, which only served to expedite Dean’s anxiety. If Cas wasn’t gonna do it, fine. He’ll take matters into his own goddamn hands.
Cas squeaked as the electricity surged in the bunker, lights humming and flickering. His wings flared out with a crack like thunder, fully extended behind his shoulders. A lamp right outside the main room exploded, and the lightbulb directly above him hissed and shattered, showering him with glass and sparks. Dean flinched hard before instinctively grabbing Cas, pure reflex causing him to shield the kid the way he always shielded Sam when they were younger.
“My name is Erin. Do you know who you are?” The girl frowned, and for a second Erin was terrified she’d somehow lost her identity. She was already so out of her depth, and an amnesiac? Yeah, no. There’s only so much absurdity Erin can handle, and she was pretty sure the past twenty-four hours alone had surpassed that threshold at least a hundred times.
"Thanks, Cas," she said, kinda softly. "That means a lot to me." He nodded silently and led the way to the living room, Erin following close behind.

Erin covered Jack protectively with her arms, feeling the snot soaking through her shirt as he began to cry. “Sorry, sweetpea,” she whispered, edging towards the hallway. “I know, I’m scared too. I know.”
Dean reached out to ruffle Jack’s hair as he passed. “Night, kiddo. See you in the morning.” Jack smiled and disappeared down the hall. “G’night, Sammy.”
"Hey, Jack," Dean motioned towards him with the spoon, "get over here, kiddo. Can't eat food without helping with the process." Face lighting up, Jack joined Dean at the counter. "What kinda pancakes do you want? We got chocolate chips, cinnamon, blueberries, bananas—"
Somehow, the static murmur followed them from the kitchen to the hallway, and all the ceiling lights flared wildly as Erin passed underneath them. Something indisputably Fucked Up was happening inside the house, and Erin had seen enough horror movies to know that when shit gets weird, you get the hell outta dodge, and you do it fast. Rushing down the hallway, she closed the space between them and the door as fast as she could. When the bulbs got dangerously bright she threw herself against the closest wall, putting her and Jack outside the direct line of fire of any potential exploding objects. Erin turned her head and held Jack a little tighter, hoping that he wouldn’t be bothered by the tremors running through her whole body.
She’d already been there for a few hours, calming and entertaining Jack while Cas slept. As much as she loved helping, she simply didn’t have the stamina to last a whole lot longer.
“Um. Just thinking,” he mumbled, guilt blossoming in his chest. Cas hadn’t meant to make anyone worry.
these past few days. I think I've slept a total of six, maybe seven hours?" Holy shit, that's a whole new level of sleep deprivation. Erin would bet there was probably more coffee in Cas’s veins than blood at the moment.
"Hey, just so you know, I'm dead serious about what I said earlier. If there's anything I can do to help, and I mean
"Be good for Erin, honey." Cas yanked his trusty trenchcoat from the metal hook by the door and shrugged it over his shoulders. It looked ridiculous over his worn gray sweatpants and what was clearly Dean's black t-shirt, designed like the movie poster for
"No, I know, I know you won't, I just—" He breathes in through the nose, exhales through the mouth. Repeats once or twice.
"Sorry," he mumbled, as though it physically pained him to apologize. Cas wiggled in his arms, readjusting himself so he could see Dean better. He touched his pointer finger to Dean's forehead, sending a soothing burst of grace. Rowena watched the exchange with a smile.
“Cas. Dude,” Erin said, cutting him off. “I literally told you to unload on me. It’s okay. And I think I can see what you’re saying. Like, on the one hand, you’re frustrated that Dean left because you know he’s holding himself responsible for more than he should. You want him to be allowed to do what he wants, not what he feels obligated to do, and it makes you upset that choosing hunting over you because of some misplaced sense of duty. Right?” Cas nodded.
"It is a very pretty spot. Nice and peaceful, good for deep thoughts,” Jack said earnestly. “I think we should go home though. You can still think there, right? I like this place but Dean is kind of freaking out right now.”
Eventually, Cas drew back and looked into Dean's eyes, small hands grabbing his shoulders. "Dee." He chirped and smiled before unfurling his wings, flapping them until he was pulling Dean upward to a standing position.
Dean hurried to grab the trash can in the corner of his room, bringing it by the side of the bed just barely in time for Cas to roll over and hurl into it.
"You did so good being patient. Didn't even cry again. Look at you, being so good." He really was a good baby. Dean had his doubts at first—to be fair, he's literally the devil's child, and his association with Cas's death certainly didn't help. Those first few weeks Dean couldn't even look at Jack without seeing Cas, in his eyes, his mannerisms, even his smile. It tore him up inside; he wanted to hate the kid, hate him for taking Cas away from him, but he couldn't. Jack was just an infant. As much as he'd like to deny it, Dean's motherly instincts are too strong for him to just abandon a helpless baby like Jack. He might've been the reason Cas was dead (at least according to Dean's warped perspective at the time), but he was also all Dean had left of Cas. Of course Dean was gonna take care of him. By the time Cas came back from the Empty, Dean had even started to love Jack. It was hard
“Still, I think the adversities have made us both better people, and ultimately strengthened our bond more than they’ve weakened it. I find my relationship with Dean to be the most fulfilling of my life, barring my relationship with my son. I don’t think I’d feel complete without the connection we share. He keeps me grounded. Almost everything I do, I do for him.”
Dean clenched his jaw and nodded, continuing to work as swiftly as he could. Heat radiated from the wounds on Cas’s back, hot and red and angry. Back and forth he threaded the skin, stitching the flesh back together, closing the deep gashes as best he could. By the time he finished patching up the first cut, Cas’s face was gleaming with sweat and tears, his cheeks colored an unnatural shade of greenish-grey. Honestly, he looked like he was going to be sick.
"Angels aren't born, they're created fully ready to serve their duties. There's no maturation, so Cas can't really turn into a kid in terms of his true form. However," Jack squinted like he was trying to perceive Cas’s form, invisible in some dimension Dean couldn't see, "his form is currently free of all its former injuries. His grace is as pure and strong as it's ever been. It's been completely restored from its previously depleted and damaged state, and his wings have also healed. Cas could probably fly again if he wanted, but he might not even know he has that ability at the moment."
"Can't—can't get better," he gasped, like every word was a Herculean feat. Dean's blood ran ice cold. "Never g-gonna get it back. Burnt through it all."
“Feel free to explore any of the books while you wait. I’ll be back in a few minutes.” Sam gave them one last smile before turning around and walking back out the way they came, leaving the two girls and the baby alone.
"Okay," Erin said, and squeezed her hand. Jack twitched against her chest, now fully asleep. "Okay, we can do that. Will you let me help you?"
Something in his voice squeezed around Erin's heart, made her throat close up, induced a prickling sensation behind her eyelids.
so. um. sorry to end on THEE most cliche cliffhanger but i promise things work themselves out in the next chapter :) also pls excuse my bastardization of all things relating to angels and demons and cas lol i'm just making shit up i like bc it's MY fic n i get to pick n choose what i consider canon <3
After lunch, the rest of the day passed fairly uneventfully. Sam spent the afternoon on his laptop, Dean took a nap, Jack and Cas watched a movie in the Dean Cave. No one wanted to cook dinner after spending so much time making pancakes, so Dean suggested hitting a diner. Everyone was on board except Cas, who had some kind of an aversion to the Impala.
"Cas, I'm sorry. Fuck, I'm so sorry. You're so good, both you and Jack are so good. You make me wanna do better," Dean murmured near Cas's ear, "you make me wanna be brave. I'm fuckin' terrified but you make me brave. Raising a kid scares me, I'm so fucking afraid of turning into my dad. I don't want to fuck up Jack the way I got fucked up. But I wanna try, for you and Jack." He dropped a kiss to the top of Cas's head.
Rough, calloused fingers wrapped themselves around Cas's, gently tugging them away from his face. Dean was being entirely too tender. Cas felt raw, all his nerves flayed and exposed.
Jack, of course, just stared at her, no longer crying (thank God) but instead choosing to assault her with angry babbles. Erin could almost hear him bitching about the indignity of it all as she smeared on some cream and slid the new diaper under him.
He's blinking tears from his eyes and forcing himself to look away from the Empty, away from where it’s suspended in the air, rotating at mesmerizing speeds.
romantically involved? Yet they live together? Castiel’s sleep deprived and half delirious musings were not easy to interpret.
Castiel gave her a tired half-smile. “Well, I can’t deny that he can be… difficult in the mornings. I've told him he wakes up like an angry bear, but it’s not really his fault. He sacrifices a lot of sleep doing extra work and research, trying to protect people even when it’s at his expense. He cares an extraordinary amount about others. Dean’s the most selfless, loving person I will ever know. I’m only able to care as much as I do because he taught me how.”
"Hey, I really do need to get back to work now but I wasn't kidding. I expect to get cute pictures of Jack on a regular basis."
"We've talked about this." Cas's voice was clipped, terse, and Dean's heart sank. He was not off to a great start.
"Yeah, 'course, kid. We're in no rush, clearly." Dean looked down pointedly at Cas, who had settled into a comfy position against his shoulder, all snuggly and curled up. Jack laughed as he stood up and dropped off his mostly empty bowl, pouring the excess milk down the drain.
