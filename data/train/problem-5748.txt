A sudden thunk coming from the top of plane didn't sound good, either.
Toni saw that Spangles was visibly disgusted. "I was right after all. The world hasn't changed a bit." The genius frowned. She honestly didn't like that he, out of everyone involved in this, had been lied to. He didn't deserve that.
She quite possibly could surpass the pair, in both looks and sheer genius. She had the best of both worlds, and he liked that, as frustrating as it was.
Her relationship with her father, on the other hand, had been much, much worse. When the various searches for the super soldier had failed, he began to frequently drink. Heavily. Inevitably, that meant she'd catch the brunt end of his anger. At first it had been things she could handle, just yelling and screaming and calling her worthless.
Dr. Banner interrupted the stare down between the two women, clearing his throat. "I've already gotten Fury to get ahold of any lab with spectrometer and have them placed on the roofs, calibrated to track gamma rays. It won't pinpoint this thing but I think we can get close."
...And double up on her anxiety medication.
Fury cut the two off before Steve could try and say anything to the Iron Man pilot. "Agent Romanoff, could you escort Dr. Banner back to his–"
Toni rolled her eyes. "I'm not five, y'know. I'm a big girl."
"What do you think you're doing?" The woman sighed. Spangles had come off so straitlaced and uptight it was stifling to her.
She talked herself up, commanding the attention of all the people in the room, and even called one poor crewman out on playing Galaga. All of her efforts created a distraction while she slipped a microchip that would allow JARVIS to get into S.H.I.E.L.D's mainframe under one of Fury's monitors.
That said: I absolutely despise my hasty style of writing from ages ago and feel like this work, out of everything I’ve done (published and unpublished), deserves the full rewrite/rework treatment. Though I’m not as heavily into Marvel as I used to be, I still enjoy this idea lot, and this one is still special to me.
She and her mother had never really talked about much other than him.
The Widow remained cool and collected. "You wanna think about removing yourself from here, doctor?"
"You don't look so hot, Toni. And you haven't said a word in the past hour. Something's wrong."
The Captain only pinched his nose and sighed at her. "I swear to God, Ms. Stark..." She could get under his skin like no other. What had happened to make her such a defensive person? Her personality was such a mask.
As if on cue, Stars, Stripes and Apple Pie came bursting back into the lab with some bad SyFy Original Movie-esque weapon and tossed it up on the table in front of everyone.
However, that deep, authoritative voice made her knees just a little weak.
Who wouldn't?
That did the trick. No one seemed to notice her plight, save for one Captain America, who had barely taken his eyes off of her. He had not failed to miss how weak the dark haired woman looked, more so now than when Dr. Banner was checking her out.
"So...how do you do it?" Toni had to ask. The ride back was too quiet. She hated the quiet.
Steve softened slightly at Toni's unwillingness to back down. She was stubborn, just like his Peggy had been. She even looked a little like Peggy. Her resemblance to Howard was undeniable, though. She definitely had her father's eyes, as well as his trademark smirk.
Yelling and screaming, saying he'd wanted a son; someone that could carry on the family name and be more like Captain America.
For anything.
"Damn..." She muttered, voice strained.
It pissed her her off, of course, but deep down it hurt more than anything. Bad.
For one, look at her. His artist's eye had not missed a single detail about her. She had a pretty face and curves in all the right places and she wasn't afraid to show it. The tight clothing did nothing but show them off. He had seen scantily clad women, but the fact that she showed no cleavage or leg but still made him flush piqued his curiosity.
With all that being said, that didn't mean she was unshakeable on the inside in these situations. Particularly, Toni hated confrontation, even though she seemed to be the cause of a great deal (her mouth tended to run away with her emotions...sometimes) of the incidents she had been involved in.
Finally tearing his gaze away and willing his body to start moving again, the living legend stalked off, past the lab, to the lower levels of the airship.
"You're a complete jackass, you know that? No wonder you and dear old dad got along so well, you're just alike." It was hard to control her voice from wavering at the mention of him.
She almost gagged. Brainwashed, much?
Toni figured at this point that, no, today really couldn't get much worse than this.
Toni's blood was practically boiling at that. Apparently she was damned if she did and damned if she didn't in the eyes of society; in the eyes of everyone. She forced herself up off the table, closing the space between her and the super soldier. "Fuck you, Rogers. This isn't about me."
After the door shut, Bruce finally decided to chime back in. "You two are a match made in heaven." He kept a straight face, teasing her.
And with that, the doctor snapped. "In case you needed to kill me...but you can't! I'd know, I tried. I got low, I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?"
"You forced our hand, we had to come up with something." The S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was grim in his reply.
Pfft, who cared anyway? It wasn't like she was a super model. She was Toni Fucking Stark, genius and super hero.
"Just exactly what the hell have you been doing, Ms. Stark?"
She checked herself in the mirror of the small washroom she was currently occupying. Her fairly short black-brown hair was always messy, and now it was completely disheveled. She even noticed how tired her brown eyes looked. The dark circles, though very slight, did not help either. She ran her fingers through her hair in a futile attempt to take out some of the wildness of it.
Fury was cautious, hand easing toward his sidearm. "The cell was only..."
She finished wrapping the fresh bruise on her arm – the arm Thor had almost crushed through her suit – and headed out into the impending chaos.
...Dumb as a doornail, yes, but not a bad guy.
Her physical features were mostly getting to him because she looked a little like Peggy...no...a lot like Peggy, without the natural grace. In addition, she had Howard's snark, wit, and intelligence.
Even though he did find her attitude insulting, he himself felt guilty. He had never acted that harshly towards a woman before.
If he got to the Black Widow, though, she didn't show it. "You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you."
Not one to give up her usual snark, she instantly had a come back. "I don't look good and I've been a boring lab partner? Why, if I was any less of a woman, Dr. Banner, I might be insulted."
Steve ignored the insult, and decided to be the bigger person and leave. That was the easiest way to get the best of people like Toni.
That was complete and utter bullshit. People did like her, damn it! She had Pepper and Happy and Rhodey and...erm...well... that was it.
Bruce looked stunned that he'd actually picked up the alien weapon. It took a second for him to regain his composure. With a humorless laugh he turned to face everyone. "Sorry kids, guess you don't get to see my party trick after all."
"Really? Endangering the lives of everyone on board this ship, when you should be looking for the tesseract, is 'funny' to you?" Steve's frown deepened and his gaze remained intense, staring down at her with disdain.
She winced a little, the physical pain caused in those memories still fresh in her mind, to this day.
He never entered the lab, though. Walking up to the door, he saw the two scientists through the glass, much closer than he would have liked. Banner was in front of Toni, looking down, and Toni was blushing and looking away.
Thor didn't seem too pleased at the explanation. "You speak of control, yet you court chaos."
Anyway...
"S.H.I.E.L.D's planning to use the tesseract to make HYDRA weapons." He paused for a split second, turning to Toni. "Sorry, computer was a little slow for me."
Bruce actually chuckled. That response was typical enough Toni, from what he had seen, but he didn't believe for a second that it was anything more that a well practiced charade.
...And in that very same moment, Steve Rogers realized that Toni Stark wasn't a 'bully'. She had been definitely been bullied, and he could relate to that. She was hurting under that obnoxious, arrogant, and downright rude facade, but was just too proud to show it. He instantly backed down, guiltier now than ever.
The next thing Toni's ears caught was Natasha's unsurprising defense of the agency's tactics. The redhead simply and boldly stated that 'S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats'.
Not without the Iron Man suit, anyway. She wasn't Wonder Woman. Or Natasha.
The argument began to spiral out of control, with everyone throwing in their two cents. Toni, surprisingly, stayed mostly quiet save for a few typical, smart ass comments.
"Me? But I don't mean harm to anyone. My people want peace." The Asgardian had a genuinely hurt look crossing his features. Toni almost felt a little sorry for Point Break. He hadn't come off as a bad guy.
With Dr. Banner supposedly coming on board and Loki in confinement at thirty-thousand feet in the air, on top of everything else, it was bound to be a pressure cooker situation.
"Look,
When she was growing up, everything being this eerily quiet meant she was about to pay for something she did or didn't do, mostly from her father.
Presently, the genius' brilliant mind was pounding against her skull. She was white-knuckling a corner table in the lab and silently pleading with herself not to be sick or pass out. Toni was incredibly worried about Bruce and a potential Hulk-out, as he seemed to be even worse for wear than her. The fact that he was suspiciously close to and protective of Loki's scepter ever-so-slightly freaked Toni the fuck out.
Bruce instantly turned to Natasha, accusing look fixed into place. "You know about any of this?"
"I assumed you were tracking the tesseract." He didn't bother to hide his irritation with her. Just her, she highly doubted he'd want to piss off Bruce.
Toni just couldn't resist that one.
Yes, she'd heard all the hush-hush comments from the likes of Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent about the arc reactor and the various other ways she 'ruined' their gowns, and she didn't appreciate it.
Toni looked at him, fighting the overwhelmig urge to make a dumb blonde joke.
It was odd being around someone as perceptive and as genius (well, almost...Toni Stark didn't have peers) as herself; he'd seen right through her.
"You okay, Toni?"
He actually laughed at that, but that did not take away from the seriousness of his next statement. "Whether you hate that arc reactor or not, you're lucky, Toni. Be thankful you can control your power."
Toni figured this would happen. She just had to piss Pepper off when Coulson was trying to get a hold of her. She made a mental note to at least try and not agitate the redhead again...for a while...anyway.
Though she wouldn't mind playing house with him, back at the tower. Just the two of them. Alone. With her most certainly 'bending' to his 'will'.
It stung, but she could deal with it.
Toni wasn't backing down. He was a jackass, walking in like he owned the place. This wasn't the forties and she wasn't going to just sit there and take it.
Before she could reply, Captain Rogers cut her off. "I'm sure if she still made weapons, Ms. Stark would be neck deep..."
She never thought she'd see the day Fury would be attempting to tread lightly with someone.
From experience, being the small-ish woman she was, confrontation meant things typically were not going to work out for her. She was a fit female, yes, the suit didn't pilot itself. However, she wasn't a woman that could really do a whole hell of a lot of damage in a physical altercation.
"You know. How do you control...the Hu- the other guy? What's your secret? Yoga, bongo drums, big bag of weed...?" She was genuinely curious.
Toni was appalled at Fury's logic. "So...that's your answer? A nuclear deterrent? I mean, that always calms everything right down." She crossed her arms and leaned against the table for support.
That shook her to the bone.
"Captain." She nodded. No need to gush. Her father had only practically worshipped the guy and never shut up about him.
"Oooh! Golden Boy swore! Life as we know it is about to end." She spared no amount of sarcasm.
Before Bruce could say anything, though, a third party decided to enter the conversation.
Steve just looked at her blankly, exasperated with her attitude. "And you wonder why no one likes you, Miss Stark? You're the most obnoxious person I've ever met."
"Just find the cube." He turned on his heel and didn't even bother looking back at her.
Toni looked at Bruce, doing her best look of exaggerated shock-horror.
"A little AC/DC never killed anyone. I think we should share with Miss Romanoff and Spangles down there, if you catch my drift."
Period.
Jesus Christ, did her little bit of teasing really piss him off that bad? It wasn't like she was bullying him or anything. He didn't have to retaliate by attacking her character. She really had tried to change over the past few years.
Rogers actually rolled his eyes at her. "I'm sorry, isn't everything?"
Now that had been funny. At least in retrospect.
It didn't help that he found her a little unnerving, in more ways than one.
Nothing. Just awkward staring. Sigh.
He looked up to her, but not without glancing at the glowing reactor in her chest first. It had brightened slightly. His lips quirked into a smile.
Leave it to Toni Stark of all people to put a positive spin on his situation.
With that, the doctor strode over to the small woman, intent on at least giving her a quick check over. It was obvious she wasn't in good shape. Maybe it had been his time in India, but he felt compelled to try and help.
She didn't want to be here longer than she had to.
Ahem.
"Freeze, Reindeer Games." Pretty spiffy jab, if she did say so herself.
"Huh. You really do have a lid on it." She was impressed. Toni had thought that might have upset him a little or at least evoke a little more of a reaction.
Currently, she was trying to ignore how bad she felt, chipping away at time in the lab with Dr. Banner. She was anxiously waiting for JARVIS to get into S.H.I.E.L.D's mainframe and clue her in on all of Fury's dirty little secrets.

Wait, did she really sound like that? If so, the voice of the suit really needed tweaking. It was masculine, since she had wanted to keep her identity a secret originally (she had let that cat out of the bag), but it almost sounded too auto-tuned to her. One more thing to add to the to do list.
The blonde mentally sighed, his stride quickly taking him up to the lab Toni and Dr. Banner were currently occupying. He was ready to get all of this over with and just go back to his apartment and...well, do nothing special. Continue trying to cope with the present, he guessed.
Toni didn't like it when people did this to her. In what may have been a bit of a reckless, impulsive decision, she gave a light (and literally shocking) poke to Bruce's side with the small electric prod she'd been holding. She was satisfied with the little yelp of pain and the following laugh and smile she got from him.
Banner chimed in again, in disbelief. "Captain America is on a potential threat watch list?"
The Captain's disgusted, condescending looks from earlier still weighed in on her mind, as well. Toni hadn't felt so inferior and pathetic in years, not since her parents were alive.
Toni loathed that look and the following shame it caused. Her father always gave her that look, and the same look was now gracing the face of his greatest creation, her childhood hero. The person she wished she was some nights, when she was tending to new bruises. It hurt.
"Oh, that..." He trailed off, seemingly lost.
Bruce was quick to cut him off. "Oh, no. You rented my room already."
Fury didn't hesitate firing right back at her. "Remind me again how you made your fortune?"
That runaway mouth? Yeah... It had been (mostly) in check for just a little too long. She couldn't resist, sick or not. The billionaire ended up smacking Spangles on the bicep, quickly getting his attention and causing him to raise a brow at her.
Chapters 1-9 are currently just being moved from FF.net to Ao3 per a request, and are completely unedited. I take full responsibility for all plot holes/bad writing/errors/etc. Gotta start somewhere, right?
"Look, Spangles, do you really think Fury is telling us everything? He's the
They're making progress!
“Permission for this: do you want to be my boyfriend Tony?” he asked as he grabbed one of Tony’s hands. “Be exclusive, go steady, however you want to call it. But I want to be your boyfriend, if you’ll be mine.”
“It really is. This should be illegal,” Tony pointed out.
“Oh a surprise? Wow, you’ve really thought this through.” Again Steve struggled to read his expression and tone, but it almost sounded surprised and honored. “Are you going to give me any hints?” he asked as he set his mug of coffee down on the counter.
He entered the coffee shop with a smile on his face, committed to making Tony laugh, but what he saw when he entered made him stop short. Instead of his beautiful barista behind the counter, he saw a large middle-aged man with a graying goatee behind the counter. That…definitely wasn’t Tony. Not even close. And yet this strange man didn’t seem frazzled being behind the counter, almost like it was a normal thing.
Tony chuckled as he shot Steve a smile. “Don’t worry Steve, I’m not complaining. For some reason it just seems very you. Just don’t start calling me swell.”
He knew Bucky and Sam were sick of hearing about Tony. They constantly complained that Tony was all Steve would talk about, which made sense because really Tony was all he could think about. They told him he’d get this doe-eyed look on his face any time he talked about him and Bucky had to snap him out of his daydreams multiple times. So when he first asked Bucky to come meet Tony, he refused. He said he heard enough about him as it was and he’d meet him once they started dating, but when Steve unleashed all his worry about whether Tony was even gay, Bucky quickly changed his mind and agreed to go with him.
Steve looked down at the design swirled in the foam and it looked…incredibly phallic. A proud grin spread across his face and he lifted an eyebrow. “Favorite part, huh?”
“Don’t worry Tony, we’ve barely scratched the surface. I haven’t even asked him about baseball yet,” Steve grinned.
He tried not to feel personally slighted. Tony deserved to have a day off after all, and just because he had some all-consuming attraction to the barista didn’t mean that feeling went both ways. He spent his days looking forward to seeing Tony again and spent his nights dreaming about him. It made him sound like some teenage schoolgirl, but it was the truth. But just because he couldn’t get Tony out of his head didn’t mean Tony did the same, and he had to recognize and be okay with that. Because honestly, really all he had done was order some coffee and stumble over his words like a moron, while Tony was witty and beautiful and intriguing and had completely captivated him. He was falling hard for him, and he knew it and could see it happening and honestly had no intention to make it stop, but that never meant Tony felt the same.
Fair warning that some days will be long and some will be a little shorter, but I promise there will be some fluff every day =D
“Actually, I thought we decided last night that it was Captain?” Steve pointed out with a sly smirk and a lift of an eyebrow.
He continued to talk with Tony, and he focused their conversation on hobbies. He found out that Tony liked to take things apart and see how they worked, he liked to watch television with his son, and he liked cars. He also learned he could be a bit competitive, but in a good way, and that he used to live a bit of a wild life. It was good, not only because he loved to learn about this man that had captivated his life, but it gave him ideas for what they could do on their date. Because that date was happening on Saturday: he would make sure of that tomorrow. Tomorrow he wasn’t chickening out. Tomorrow he was going to do it, come hell or high water. Tomorrow he was asking Tony out.
Tony raced around the counter, stumbling slightly in his need to get back to Steve. As soon as he was around the counter, Steve reached out desperately for Tony. He cupped his hands around his cheeks and pulled him into a passionate kiss. This time he slid his tongue into Tony’s mouth. He tasted like Italian food and coffee and he couldn’t get enough of it as he lapped at Tony’s mouth with a shuddering moan. He could feel Tony’s hands settle on his hips, and he kissed him harder as a reward. Tony’s hands slid up along his chest with a whimper until it found the first button of his shirt and deftly released the button.
“Very…relaxed,” he smirked. “I heard a little rumor that your flat might be empty tonight, so I was thinking we should stay in.”
He didn’t know how successful this idea was, but when he thought of it in his mind’s eye, he really liked it. He got one of those make-at-home meal kits and a bottle of the nicest scotch he could afford and he thought it would be fun to try and make a meal together. Tony clearly had some skills baking so some of those had to translate to cooking, so that should make up for the fact that Steve was completely useless at anything that wasn’t boiling noodles or putting together a sandwich. His hope was that while they cooked together, they would hold each other while stirring, or guide each other’s hands while cutting, or steal touches when the other was focusing on the food. It would be corny and romantic and intimate and he loved it. Or their adventures in cooking would end up being a disaster, and they would spend the entire time laughing as they messed up and goofed around. He really was fine with either way. Really he just wanted an excuse to spend time with Tony in private, and that’s what the night would give them. And if Pete was on some school trip…
He looked down at their hands and sat quiet for a moment, and Steve let him have that moment to compose himself. “It’s the anniversary of when I was forced to sign over my dad’s company,” he finally said quietly.
Tony shook his head, his hands quickly making work of the buttons. “Oh no, you are not denying me this. You have been hiding all this for way too long. I need to see it.” With the final button undone he threw open the shirt, openly gawking. “God
“Alright here you go, one Americano!” he announced proudly as he placed the paper cup on the counter. “I added a little something extra to it too - don’t worry it’s not like booze or anything like that. Just a unique blend of beans - kind of my thing,” he said in a tone that was almost dismissive, except he could tell that was this cafe’s unique claim to fame. “Guaranteed to jumpstart your morning.”
Are there only ten more days? Say it ain't so!
After waiting in line for what seemed like forever (he was just being dramatic, it wasn’t that long and Tony got through the line at a decent pace) he finally made it up to the counter. He didn’t even ask permission as he leaned over and planted a firm kiss on his unsuspecting lips. He could feel Tony lean into the kiss and he loved that he could do that, that his kiss could relax him and make him go weak. Last night’s date had been amazing and while he had shown his appreciation for the date multiple times over last night, he had been aching to show him again today.
Right, he thought he would want coffee. But without Tony here, without being able to see Tony smile when he drank his coffee or to hear him laugh after the jokes he’d worked so hard on…what was even the point of being here? Sure the coffee was great and the muffins were a great source of food after his runs, but really he came for Tony. He came to interact with him, make him smile, make him laugh, see him, but if he wasn’t here today, then what was the point?
I hope you all enjoyed watching Steve and Tony's romance blossom and grow during these past thirty days. For those of you who were able to enjoy my little writing experiment live over the past thirty days, I hope you enjoyed it and I'd love to hear what you thought of this format. For anyone who is reading it after the fact, I still hope you enjoyed it and that it was still good without the daily wait and suspense.
“Ooh, so I have two challenges tonight: beat you both at bowling and get you to love baseball. I’ve got my work cut out for me!” Steve laughed.
It was with that dirty little thought running through his mind that he entered the café and shared a coy little smirk with Tony when he reached the counter.
“Yeah, we’ll talk about it tonight,” Tony decided. He handed Steve his card back and stepped aside to make the coffee, which gave Steve time to talk to Pete.
“Whoa. What? What?” Peter asks, each one rising in decibels because that’s just wild and categorically false. “No, I didn’t. I’m pretty sure I’d remember something like that.”
, Steve,” he huffs out under Steve’s ministrations, humid and gauzy.
Tony hums in contemplation. “Well, I did have a few half-baked ideas about cocooning in bed all day, Steve.”
He sounds honored of all things, and Tony swallows over the affection that threatens to overwhelm him. He’s hoarse when he says, “Of course I would.”
“I kissed you actually.”
“I told you what Zola said about Hydra infiltrating SHIELD, but there was something he showed me that I didn’t know how to tell you. I wanted to tell you that first day in the hospital but then you got the call about my shield, and every day after that it just became harder.” He and his words shake in tandem, and Tony can’t fight his instinct to reach out. He places his hand flat on Steve’s chest, the derby pounding underneath it something vicious.
“Hey, I was game,” Steve reminds him, bussing under Tony’s chin. He dodges a swat by climbing out of Tony’s cage of limbs and rooting around in their bedside drawer. For a moment, he’s talking to himself, swearing he put it right back the last time they used it.
“I’m a changed man? It’s not like you didn’t know what you were getting into when you started dating me. Frankly, this is the case with probably twelve or more hotels between the States and overseas. I had a very disaffected youth.” Tony shucks off his pants and hops out of his briefs. Flopping down unceremoniously, he offers, “We can always go to a different hotel, you know. Aside from maybe those other eleven hotels, my AmEx is accepted everywhere. An actual upside of dating me.”
Steve’s expression brightens and god, the sun has some serious competition. “What? Tony! That’s amazing. I thought—jeez. Thought I wouldn’t see it again. Where is it?” Steve asks like he’s itching for the disc to rebound into his hands.
“Oh, anytime, but you don’t. Last time you rang me this early, I was your one phone call.”
All of the dead are living, and no amount of desperation can get Steve to give up the ghosts.
“Any chance Steve can get an invite?” Tony asks, laughing. He turns to Steve. “Oh my gosh, I finally know what to get you for your birthday. You’d want the Millennium Falcon, right? No way you would actually construct a weapon for the evil Empire.”
“So the fundamentals haven’t changed but the straps are outdated. They work efficiently enough but your handles can get better without them in the way,” Tony explains.
I know, I know, this one's really short. I know. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you I promise.
Hadn’t he made that abundantly clear? But just to make sure he got the point across, he made a disgusted face. “Definitely not. For one it would be like dating my brother, and two he’s not at all my type.”
“What?” Tony asked as he looked up at Steve. “No, I don’t need anything.”
It didn’t take him long to find his perfect running path. Steve had only been in Manhattan for a few days, but he already decided Central Park was the absolute best place to run. The clear paths had multiple off-shoots and he even found an app that would map out an individualized path based on how far he wanted to run. It was perfect. Sure the park was a little crowded, but it was barely sunrise, so only the serious runners were out; he hadn’t been forced to slow down because of a crowd and he hoped it stayed that way. Before he deployed for his most recent tour, he had qualified and completed the Boston Marathon, and he planned on doing it again now that he was back.
He walked into the shop and immediately turned his attention towards Tony and just beamed when he saw him. It was torture to wait in line, and the little glances Tony shot his way were the only things that helped him survive. He finally got up to the counter and Tony gifted him the rare, special smile that he was starting to think was only for him. “I’ve been thinking about you,” he told him as he leaned over the counter.
with no help from Dad, and it let me meet you. I’m actually
Spurred on by his need to fix this and set things right, Steve finished his run again in record time. He felt so nauseous thinking about how he screwed things up with Tony that he didn’t eat dinner and he barely slept. He kept waking up, checking to see if it was time to get up. As he ran, he scripted over what he was going to say. It was going to sound rehearsed, but he didn’t care. He needed to make sure he got this right and he needed to make sure Tony knew that he wasn’t seeing anyone else. What Tony chose to do with that information would be up to him - he still wasn’t sold on Bucky’s suggestion to ask him out right now, but he’d use Tony’s reactions to guide him.
“Hmm?” he asked as he looked up at Steve. “No, nothing’s wrong. I was just thinking about how I don’t think I made enough muffins today. But I’m fine. Speaking of muffins, how are you?” He smiled at Steve, and for all the world it looked like his normal smile, but he could see a sadness in his eyes. He was learning fast that with Tony, you had to look at his eyes. His face and actions and words would lie, but his eyes usually couldn’t.
it made desire burn in his gut. “Because I believe you promised me a kiss on this date, and because I’m not blind I
“Personal trainer at one of the local gyms,” he replied as he grabbed the coffee and took a wonderful sip. Still just as good as the first day he came in here. “It’ll be a lot of work, but it’s flexible hours and good pay and they think I’ll be able to build up a clientele pretty quick.”
“Well that’s an unadvertised upside to this mug,” Steve pointed out. “You should have led with that.”
He could feel Pete’s eyes on him as he said that and he could almost feel the tension in that corner of the room as he hung on their every word. Tony was silent for a moment, and it looked like he was struggling to keep his face impassive, though what emotion was threatening to burst out, Steve couldn’t say. “Still not sure what this has to do with me,” he finally said. “Are you hoping for a singles discount?”
Pete shrugged before he looked back at his phone. “Same old same old.”
“After the kind of date we had yesterday? You get access to as many kisses as you want,” he promised huskily.
“Stevie, it’s way too early,” Bucky groaned. “You’re lucky I got up for you at all. Now can we do this so you can stop worrying and get back to flirting?”
Fresh off an amazing night with Tony and Pete, Steve practically whistled as he jogged the last couple of blocks to Jumpstart. Last night had been perfect. He lost horrifically at bowling (no one thought to warn him that Pete was a pro because he and his best friend spent hours figuring out the math behind bowling), but that was okay because it was still a great night. He and Tony had a fun time trying to sneak kisses or butt squeezes when Pete wasn’t looking. They definitely got caught a couple times, but the chances of getting caught made it all the more exhilarating when they managed to pull it off. But more than that, he felt like he really got to know Pete beyond his schooling and interest in LEGOs. And Pete never ran out of questions for him, which he took as a really good sign. Pete had taken an interest in him just as much as he took an interest in Pete, and that could only be a good sign for the rest of their relationship.
Steve raised both of his eyebrows as he looked in earnest at Tony. “Oh? And why do we need some privacy?”
The coffee bar itself sat at the front of the room near the door, which was smart for patrons hoping to get their coffee to go. The bar had the same clean look, with a lot of glass and metal and the same white countertops. A glass case showcased baked goods that called his name after such an intense run, and long glass windows separated the patrons from the coffee machines, which were surprisingly not hidden like they were at so many Starbucks. Elaborate espresso machines sat behind the counter so everyone could see the fine metalwork that went into their design. Behind the bar was a large piece of glass that had all the options typed out on it in very clean and clear font. On the other end of the bar was a place to pick up drinks, which extended into an even longer countertop with barstools covered in a soft, grey fabric. It actually reminded him more of a bar, where a patron could sit and sip their coffee while talking to the barista behind the counter. It was clever. It was clean and open. It was unique, and he was drawn to it in a way he couldn’t explain.
“Just your ego – you’ll be fine,” the kid, who was obviously Pete, shot back with a fond smile.
But Tony seemed completely undeterred as he groaned against Steve’s kiss. “Oh I knew I wasn’t going to be disappointed,” he moaned. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and hooked a leg up around his hips and pushed up against him, drawing a gasping cry out of Steve as he strained against his zipper. Tony used his hold on him to grind his hips deep into him as he let out his own shuddering cry. Steve couldn’t help but push back in return, using his hold on Tony’s butt to grind into him deeper. He captured Tony’s mouth in another crushing kiss, their tongues dancing and curling around each other. As he pushed down along him, he could feel Tony swell and harden and Steve swore because even through his jeans he felt
Also, it looks like Steve finally admitted to himself how he's been feeling about Tony. What is he going to do with this newfound information?
He grabbed one of Tony’s hands and squeezed it gently. “Hey darling, something wrong?”
you are hot,” he gasped. Tony’s hands ran along his muscles, and he could feel his body tingle and twitch everywhere he touched. Tony’s touch brought with it pure pleasure that burned deep inside him and he moaned out his appreciation. It didn’t take long for Tony to rip his shirt off his arms so he stood bare-chested in the middle of the coffee shop.
“Sure thing,” Tony nodded, and he rang up his coffee before he turned his attention to the espresso machine.
As he left the cafe for the night, he looked up at the window he knew was Tony’s and gave a salute. “Hope he’s takin’ good care of you boss, ‘cause you deserve it.” He knew the target of his blessing wouldn’t hear it, but that wasn’t the point, and with a smile he began his leisurely walk home.
“Here you are!” Happy announced. “One Americano!”
“Oh uh, he uh, he just got it,” Pete stammered, and even Steve could tell he was making this up on the fly. He really owed this kid something if they started dating for all the work he was putting into it. “Ordered it this morning and it should be here by Saturday. So uh, I have to cancel our plans so uh, looks like you’re not really doing anything,” he declared with a grin before he pulled out his phone and started typing furiously.
Tony reached back and swatted at him playfully, but made no effort to move or pull away. “You should know better than to sneak up on a man in New York City,” he chided.
Wow, we have come to the end.
to him? They awkwardly tried to hide their arousal from the street as Tony shut off the lights and locked up the café and headed to the entrance to the apartments, both of them thrumming with need to touch each other in the most intimate way possible.
Tony just glowed with the compliment as he made his way back over to the register. “Damn right I am. Did you hear that Stacy? I’m always right, so maybe you should actually let me order your coffee for today?”
He let Tony make the coffee, and instead of wandering around the café again he moved to the other end of the counter and leaned forward against it, his arms crossed over his chest with elbows resting on the cool countertop. He came here to look at Tony after all, not the pictures on the walls. “So are you gonna tell me what’s in the Americano in case you’re gone again?” Steve asked. He managed to get his question out before he looked at Tony, and he was so grateful that he did, because now there was no way he could say anything coherent. Tony faced the espresso machine, and from his view at the counter he could see Tony’s body in full profile. His mouth went dry as he saw how Tony’s back curved right into this perfectly round butt. The jeans he wore framed it so perfectly and left nothing to the imagination. He could feel his heart thrumming in his chest as he stared. To think that had been hiding behind the tall counters this whole time and he had been missing that. His hands ached to reach out and hold those beautiful cheeks and he squeezed his hands tighter around himself to keep them in control.
good after you run. I mean…it’s really not fair how good. So I’m…this is really okay. Yeah…really okay.”
He smiled back at him. “You’re welcome.” He bent over to press a soft kiss onto Tony’s lips while he cradled the back of his skull with his hand. He felt one of Tony’s hands reach up to rest on his cheek and he closed his eyes as he felt overcome with emotion. He slid his tongue into Tony’s mouth, not looking for passion or vigor, but looking for an intimacy that connected him with as much of Tony’s mouth as he could with that kiss. Their tongues rubbed and curled against each other, and Steve felt a rush of something so warm and so wonderful rise up in him. It wasn’t lust, it wasn’t passion, but it was something so powerful it was almost blinding to touch, but he refused to look away. His mind was trying to give him a word to describe this feeling, this shared elation that this moment and this kiss with Tony brought forth in each of them, but he refused to acknowledge it. This was something else, a connection, but it wasn’t
Steve smiled wide as he looked up at Tony, definitely reading the subtle request to stay longer. “Well, the kid asked for my perfect type, but I’m sure I’ll find someone who meets all of them and more,” he replied, and with how thick he was laying on the suggestion, he hoped Tony realized that he had, indeed, found that perfect person.
stop, and even through the thick denim of his jeans he knew Tony could tell he hit that point.
Bucky had been his best friend since they were young together. He would help protect him from bullies in high school, before Steve bulked up, and he was always supportive and there for him. When his mom died when he was sixteen, Bucky’s family took him in, and he still felt like he could never repay them for that favor. He joined the military as soon as he could to get out of their hair (and because he’d always wanted to serve like his dad) but he always remembered their kindness. That experience created a special bond with his best friend. They grew up together, they served together, and unfortunately they got blown up together. Steve managed to make it out with a few scars from shrapnel thanks to Bucky’s quick thinking, but Bucky lost an arm and was still struggling to adjust.
“Oh you know what, I forgot to tell you,” Pete interrupted almost in a panic. “Ned just got this new LEGO set and we were gonna work on it Saturday night. Probably have a sleepover.”
Pete immediately looked apologetic and put his hands over his mouth. “Right! Right! Sorry! I’ll be—I’ll be quiet. Just…ask your question. I’m sorry!”
He walked into the café, and like every morning for the past thirty days, he looked for Tony’s smile. That smile captivated his heart and made him feel like he could take on whatever the day had in store, so long as he could see that smile again the next day. It was what made him get out of bed and what he spent his entire run looking forward to seeing. Tony finally looked up and there it was, the smile from his boyfriend, the man that he loved, and it filled his heart just seeing it again. He patiently waited for his turn and used Tony’s intermittent smiles to tide him over until finally he was at the counter. He leaned over and gave Tony a longing kiss hello that petered out into small, needy pecks. It had been far too long.
“It is. It’s a little Southern, but it’s shorter than ‘my studmuffin.’ Why, do you have a problem with it?” he asked with a teasing glint in his eye.
Tony shifted nervously again, but something on his face softened just a little. “Maybe you will,” he said gently before his face twisted into a smirk. “Too bad you have no redeeming qualities to keep him.”
It seemed Tony was able to think quicker through the haze though as he stiffened slightly. “What did you say?” he asked.
He trembled as he reached for Tony’s face and pulled him into a kiss. He couldn’t think of anything better to do with all his joy other than share it, the same way they shared that love just moments ago through a kiss. Just like before, he could feel their shared love blend together, except this time he knew it was love coming from both sides, and that made its effect even more powerful. He could feel tears prick at his eyes out of sheer happiness, but it was his sheer stubbornness that kept them in place. It wasn’t that he minded crying in front of Tony, but he didn’t want them to interrupt this beautiful moment.
“I do love your cinnamon rolls,” Steve agreed. He closed his eyes for a moment, psyching himself up as he took a deep breath. He didn’t come here to talk about his fitness routine after all. So here went nothing. “So, do you have any plans on Saturday?” he asked, trying his hardest to sound casual. “Since it’s your day off and all.” He could feel this tension in the room, like everyone inside it was holding their collective breath as soon as that question left his mouth.
When Tony dropped off his coffee, he had a great idea, and he captured Tony’s hand to keep him there. “Hey, you two. What do you say we do something the three of us this weekend? Something fun like bowling? I’d really like a chance to get to know you better Pete.” He knew this was a genius idea when he saw that softness in Tony’s eyes again and the happiness on Pete’s face.
Saturday morning came and went with no sign of Tony…and no sign of Steve. Given the excitement that was starting at the coffee shop later in the day, Steve knew that going in the morning would just be torture because it wasn’t time for their date yet. So he broke his tradition for the second time that week and didn’t go to the coffee shop in the morning after his run.
He was still so close to Tony’s face he could feel the heat of his blush, and he just had to kiss one of those blushing cheeks. Tony just smiled. “You’re not the only one. Never knew I wanted to be cuddled like that until you,” he admitted softly.
Happy gave him a sad little smile. “Ah, you must be pretty new. Tony doesn’t work on Saturdays, so I cover him for the day.”
This time Steve knew better to take a sip before leaving the café. Again Tony heated the coffee to the perfect temperature and it had so much flavor it was an experience drinking it. He nodded his thanks and raised his coffee in a toast towards Tony for the exquisite work. “Better than yesterday,” he complimented. And it was true, because this time he had been waiting for this coffee.
The next morning he planned to leave early for his run while Tony went downstairs to get the shop open. They were both early risers so it seemed like a great plan; until Tony kept his promise and put his damn shirt on to make breakfast…and nothing else. It was so big on him and while it was long enough that it covered his butt (that was a shame) it showed off Tony’s incredible legs. He also left a few bottom buttons undone so occasionally when he’d move Steve would get a peek of a prize. He didn’t know why seeing him in his shirt was such a turn-on, but he couldn’t help himself, and he fell on Tony again. A sweet and supportive text from Pete gave Tony permission to come into work late, which was all the permission they needed to go another round this morning. He still felt like he was in the afterglow, and it made all the flirting with Tony that much more enjoyable.
“Yeah, mine too,” Tony breathed. They kissed one more time before the door opened, signaling the first of the pre-church crowd. They separated only by necessity, and Steve took up residence in his usual spot, waiting to receive his coffee. He knew he’d have to leave eventually – his presence distracted Tony and he knew he didn’t devote as much time and attention to his other guests when he was there – but he was happy to hang around for awhile at least. So long as Tony kept the coffee and the occasional flirty looks coming, he had no reason to leave.
needed that big of a battery to power?
Regaining his composure somewhat, he spoke.
"And you haven't been? Your tactics aren't that different." Burn. Toni laughed a little. Who'd have thought Banner would've had it in him?
Toni shrugged nonchalantly, still gripping the table. "No offense, but I'm kinda wondering the same about you."
And Loki was fucking creepy. And boring holes into her with the stares.
Busted.
If there was one thing Toni Stark was known for (and she was known for many, many things), it was making an entrance, Iron Man suit or not.
Steve frowned and crossed his arms. "At least your father genuinely did something to help people. You call yourself a hero, but you really only fight for yourself. In reality, you're so self-absorbed and arrogant you don't care who you hurt in the in the process. You'd never lay down on the wire for someone else. He'd be so ashamed of you if he saw you today." Steve regretted the harsh words the instant they rolled off his tongue. The hurt look on her face was enough to let him know that he'd crossed a line of decency that he never should have.

That confrontation with Captain America and Thor had not been fun. Thor had almost taken her fucking head off more than once during that...skirmish...and Cap's bright idea to get Thor to hit his shield still had her ears ringing.
If Stars n' Stripes caused any permanent damage, it was gonna be his ass. His cute, shapely ass.

Toni stood there, shocked. She never really thought of Bruce as the type to be suicidal. She had contemplated the act a few times herself, when drunk and when sober, but she'd held the doctor to a higher standard than she did her own self...
If you’re curious to see what I’m up to, feel free to browse or follow me at breezeinmonochromenight.tumblr.com
Toni was thankful for the lull in the heated conversation, but she didn't expect anything that came next. Bruce walked over to one of the screens and turned it, almost a little too angrily, pointing at the weapon schematic JARVIS had found. "Now, I want to know what S.H.I.E.L.D wants to do with weapons of mass destruction."
Doubling up on her anxiety medication had probably been the dumbest thing that Toni had done in a long, long time. That, combined with being on an airship of all places, only served to make her queasy, lightheaded and sensitive to all the artificial light in the lab.
"Look, just because we're gathering all this information on the tesseract does not mean that–"
Toni Stark was excellent at pushing people far, far away.
He scoffed. "I was already pretty well removed back in Calcutta."
"...Miss?...Stark." Finally, someone broke the silence as Loki was cuffed and escorted to the carrier. She snapped out of her musings, partially.
Her mother was seemingly as infatuated with finding 'Captain America: The World's First Super Hero' as her father, if not more with the dreamy looks she'd give off when talking about him. She'd never seen her mother look at her father quite like that. Hell, Toni herself had never gotten any look of adoration from her mother.
"Yeah, just peachy Doc. Why do you ask?" Toni went with it, even raising an eyebrow at him in feigned confusion.
He would never have guessed that Toni had seen a blur of red, white, and blue pass, and her heart had skipped a beat.
She was starting to wonder if Howard had hit her a just a little too hard once or twice. Maybe, just maybe, Pepper had been right about her seeing a therapist.
"Just call me Bruce." He meant it. It was nice feeling like he had someone he could relate to. She felt like an old friend; there was no need for formalities.
…Oh. God. What. The. Hell?
What the hell was wrong with her, with all the erratic and completely non-logical thoughts? She was oscillating from near-hatred for the blonde to wanting to jump his bones every few seconds.
And on that note, she excused herself. The confrontation had shaken her, to say the least. She needed a second to recompose herself.
"The build. Fitting in that...getup. Do you do cardio or...?" If there was another thing Toni Stark was good at, it was being a flirt. And Spangles wasn't exactly unpleasant to look at.
"Don't even go there, Banner. Don't."
...Damn her libido.
And she hated it.
The next thing Toni knew, there was substantial pressure around her lower back and shoulders and her cheek was pressed against something cold. Terrified at the possibility she was was trapped under debris and panic overriding rationality, she jerked her head up and prepared to scream for help (though she kind of doubted anyone would come). She was shocked to find herself staring at a silver star and heard a groan of pain that was much to deep to be her own. It quickly clicked that pressure as coming from two large arms encircling her and that she was resting on something much too warm to be the floor.
She had always had a little crush on him as a child, from all the stories her dad had told her, before things got...bad.
The arguing continued, and eventually Toni thought she had finally breached that thick skull of his. At some point during it all, Bruce threw his hands up in defeat at the heated conversation and turned back to his work.
Steve saw Dr. Banner lift the scepter and immediately made a move to stand in front of Ms. Stark. She might agitate him to no end and thoroughly get under his skin, but she was the only link to the past he had left. Plus, she was only human, and not the healthiest from the looks of it. Again, he could relate.
Back to reality, the billionaire spoke. "I'll be fine, Dr. Banner, I promise." Her tone wasn't harsh, or snappy. She wasn't going to argue with him and risk a Hulk-out, not with feeling the way she did now.
She chalked that awkward, random thought up to not getting laid in quite a while with a tinge of insomnia.
She was wasn't bitter, really. Seriously.
Psshh, whatever.
Steve Rogers had decided to a do a little investigating of his own, but not before he spoke to Ms. Stark first. He didn't like the way he acted toward her, and definitely felt like he should apologize. Or attempt an apology, at least.
Fury interrupted the argument. "This was our way of getting some control back on our side."
He sighed, a little annoyed by the insult and the goose flesh she gave him by being so close.
Toni paused, thoughtful for a moment. Maybe this wouldn't be so horrible after all, this man knew what he was talking about.
She'd be damned if she moved an inch with him; she'd get the last word in if it killed her. Spangles leaving before she could get in a final retort earlier had gotten right under her skin. He'd acted like she would bend to his will, here was no way Anthoni Elizabeth Stark would act like some demure forties housewife and let him step on her.
This was not shaping up to be a good day.
Had he turned around, he'd have seen the flattered look that even Toni couldn't hide. She had always highly respected the doctor's work, and that little extension of camaraderie meant a lot, whether she'd admit it or not.
That would not always be the case, however. It had gradually become physical, from just shoving and pushing around to full blown beatings. There were times it had gotten so bad, the Iron Man pilot had been unable to move the next day.
He found his cheeks tinging the faintest of reds for looking at her like that.
. His secrets have secrets. And I intend to find out just what the hell is going on." He was on Toni's last nerve. She was practically glowering at the super soldier at this point. Couldn't he just stand there and look pretty?
The dark haired woman was shaken out of her spaced out state and glanced over at Dr. Banner, who was looking back at her over his glasses.
"Yeah?"
Back in her facade, she raised a ridiculously perfect, manicured eyebrow at him and pressed her self closer so that they were chest to chest. She noted to herself that he felt like leaning into a brick wall.
Toni involuntarily shuddered. She tenderly touched the arm that her father had broken (it still ached at times...she hoped arthritis wasn't setting in) one particularly horrific night, and let out a breath she didn't know she was holding.
Perfect.
That said: I absolutely despise my hasty style of writing from ages ago and feel like this work, out of everything I’ve done (published and unpublished), deserves the full rewrite/rework treatment. Though I’m not as heavily into Marvel as I used to be, I still enjoy this idea lot, and this one is still special to me.
Without missing a beat, the blonde spoke, deep voice tinged with anger.
That definitely wasn't Bruce she'd met earlier. Something was really wrong, and she had all beliefs it had to do with that scepter. In addition, Fury doing his best at 'politely' (Toni almost snorted, as if he could be polite) calling her out on her little hacking endeavor did not help her anxieties, either.
It's not like shutting down other people and being a smartass was largely a defense mechanism.

So, naturally, she didn't completely believe the entire shtick that S.H.I.E.L.D wanted her to buy in to. Why would they need an alien power source? What the hell could they possibly have going
Bruce actually froze for a second. He'd never really thought of it that way, considering the Other Guy more of a curse.
Toni glanced away, flustered, not willing to divulge something that personal. She also wasn't used to attention like this. Sure, she had slept with men before, but she didn't let it go any further than that. This kind of intimacy was new. She had always taken care of her own self or Pepper stepped in and loaned a helping hand, like when she changed the core to the arc reactor for the first time.
...And since when did she agree with Pepper on anything involving her personal life?
Whether he noticed Thor's discomfort, Toni wasn't sure, but the S.H.I.E.L.D director didn't miss a beat this time. "Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly...hilariously...outgunned."
"Dr. Banner, it's a pleasure to meet you. I hear you're the leading expert in gamma radiation. And, I have to admit, I'm also a fan of the way you...y'know...turn into an enormous green rage monster."
The shock wave that ripped through the ship sent an already off-balance Toni flying. She covered her face and head with her arms and squeezed her eyes shut, prepared to slam head first into the tables on the opposite side of the room. The last thing she wanted was to be knocked out cold in the middle of a crisis.
He shot an annoyed look her way. "...And I'm not leaving because you're suddenly twitchy."
Maybe he was just seeing things.
Toni had always been an intensely smart young woman (and she was going with that; she'd be damned if she admitted out loud that she was thirty-five), even if some of her decisions could be considered questionable. Or kind of tasteless. Or both.
"Loki's in your head, Dr. Banner. He's manipulating you." It was at that moment that Toni was glad that Natasha had never been a hostage negotiator. The thought almost made her snicker out loud.
Despite her over medicated, exhausted state, the genius managed a sneer and an eye roll.
...All because of Spangles a few doors down, who apparently had as much distaste for her as her father did.
But if it was true, it was bittersweet. He was glad that Peggy had found someone that he had thought of as good person, that could take care of her, but it was still sad to have concrete evidence that she had moved on to another man.
Fury paused, and actually looked as if he was just a little dumbstruck. If Toni hadn't had the practice of hiding her emotions so well, she was sure her eyebrows would have shot up, possibly off of her forehead at the current clusterfuck.
Toni Stark was officially going to make it her business, if she was going to cooperate with them.
Toni instantly looked back at him, features softened. "You're lucky too...I looked at your file. Doc...all that gamma radiation? It should have killed you."
"Hey Toni?"
Chapters 1-9 are currently just being moved from FF.net to Ao3 per a request, and are completely unedited. I take full responsibility for all plot holes/bad writing/errors/etc. Gotta start somewhere, right?
That aside, the thunderstorm had really picked up outside the carrier craft. Even stranger, Loki didn't seem too thrilled about it.
Jesus Christ he was solid. Her hand actually hurt. Shockingly, though, she suppressed the wave of dirty thoughts that came to mind.
job, damn it.
...At least that's what she told herself.
(See the end of the chapter for
...At that moment, Toni Stark realized that she would be vilified by almost everyone in the room no matter what she did.
And that was
"Yeah! And you'll have your little cube back, no muss, no fuss." The look Fury sent her way spoke volumes. He couldn't kill her, right? She was too high profile...right?
Toni and Dr. Banner had been working in the lab for some time in almost total silence after the good doctor had politely declined her offer to work and have free reign at Stark Tower. At this point, the billionaire thought she was going to go mad. Plus, he felt like a sort of kindred spirit to her, so she wanted a chance to pick the non-green doctor's brain.
"Quite the contrary, really." He smiled a little, and took her wrist in his hands, checking her pulse.
They finally made it back to the helicarrier. Toni had to admit, it was an impressive structure, at least for S.H.I.E.L.D anyway.
The computer beeped at that moment and Toni let out a laugh. "I'm sorry, Nick." She turned the screen to him. "What were you saying?"
"Never said you weren't." He didn't bother looking up. "Are you on any sort of depressants? Your pulse is really low, and your skin is clammy."
"Never mind. Guess you missed a lot doing time as a Cap-sicle." She kept a straight face. Ribbing was good, even if she was the only one that found it funny.
Fuck.
The two began to discuss how to track the tesseract when the deadly red-head chimed in. "When did you become an expert in gamma radiation, Stark?"
"How about some music, JARVIS? Gotta let Miss Romanoff know we're here."
the one holding
He sighed just a little, turning and walking back to the scepter. He removed his glasses and rubbed his temples in a vain attempt to ease the stress headache he felt coming.
"I know my rack is a thing of art, but doctor, your staring could make a harlot blush." Sure, her breasts were a little smaller in comparison to say, Natasha, but they were perky and cute and damn it if she wasn't proud of them.
However, the super soldier had all inclinations that the genius would not be an easy person to express any regrets to. He'd probably never hear the end of it.
His face glowed as he launched into all the cool stuff he saw in DC. Steve gave his input when he could since he’d been to the capitol multiple times before, but even he hadn’t seen some of the stuff the teen had seen. He also got to hear some funny stories about things his classmates did during the trip, and offered him heartfelt congratulations when he heard that his school had won the national academic decathlon.
“You know, this is starting to become a trend,” Tony smirked as Steve walked into the café, which oddly echoed the same thoughts that Steve had himself. Just like yesterday, he was helpless against the desire to visit Tony in his coffee shop again. This time it wasn’t even about the coffee – okay, it was still a little bit about the coffee – but he knew it was so he could see that barista again. See that infuriating smirk that stuck with him the rest of the day, see him smile when someone praised his coffee - he couldn’t turn it down. He was addicted and he was hooked and he just needed to resign himself that he was going to be coming here every day.
He walked over to his usual spot and turned to face Pete. “Hey kid,” he greeted.
Pete blushed at being called out. “Hey, it’s not that I don’t like it, I just don’t know much about it. But I’ll give you all night to change my mind and make me like it.”
He blushed slightly as he smiled at Tony. “It’s nothing compared to you,” he marveled while his eyes made another pass over Tony in his outfit. “You look damn good.”
“I’ll take my free Americano now,” he teased. “Oh and my muffin.”
Steve also never showed up, but Happy didn’t seem to mind or even notice. It was almost like he knew that Steve wouldn’t be showing up. It was almost like he knew that Steve was preoccupied with something else, something more important, and he knew not to expect to see him.
. He heard it, clear as day. It wasn’t some trick his ears were playing on him or some wish so powerful he believed it already came true. No, those words were real and they came straight out of Tony.
He also learned that they could just sit in perfect silence. It wasn’t awkward, it wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was soothing. Before she died, he’d sit with his mother a lot and they’d often have the same kind of silence between them. She would tell him that he needed to find someone he could sit in silence with, because that was the mark of a true connection. He experienced that with his mom, and now he experienced it with Tony. If anything, he felt more connected to him during the silence, when he just got to hold him and be with him. They may not be talking with their words, but he could feel Tony’s emotions through their shared non-verbals, and he knew it was a sign of something powerful. He didn’t want to say love – it was still too soon for that right? – but it was a powerful connection.
God what was he supposed to do?
Tony sighed sadly. “That’s only because I’m at work. And speaking of work…” He gave Steve’s neck one final kiss before he pulled away. He understood why he had to do it – more customers had arrived and he really needed to attend to them, but he loved it when Tony cuddled with him because he was just so small against him and he loved every moment of it. His only comfort was that they still had tonight, and he’d hopefully get the chance to cuddle Tony again.
Steve’s brow furrowed. Did he say anything? He couldn’t remember his mouth doing anything other than kissing Tony. He certainly had
He shook himself out of his thoughts again as he stepped up to the counter, his mind unfortunately blank as he struggled to find words. “Um, sorry. I’d uh, like some coffee. And a blueberry muffin.”
Tony sighed but detached from his side and went behind the counter where he stood at his usual spot by the register, elbows on the counter. “Well hello my studmuffin. What would you like today?” he asked, seemingly content to play along.
He walked in through the open door, and he immediately appreciated the clean, open environment. While the room wasn’t large, it had tall ceilings, which made it feel very open. The walls were a soft grey, with light grey wood laminate on the floor. Even though there were only a few windows by the door, the room still felt well-lit and comfortably bright. White tables with metal legs covered the floor towards the back of the shop, and Steve could appreciate that there were varying levels of tables depending on the kind of experience a patron wanted. Scattered throughout the room were black and white photos of cars, both new and old, and behind the bar was a large, blown-up black and white photo of the inner workings of a car. Jumpstart - now he got the pun even more.
“Yeah about that, you still giving out hints?” Tony asked with a smile. “I’ll give you a free muffin.”
He pretended to give a suffering sigh as he pulled out his card. “I guess it really is the only way.”
Every time he heard someone approach he looked up, which was quite often given that this was New York City on a weekend and there were a lot of people on the street, but finally he was rewarded with Tony’s smiling face. It was clear that Tony had the casual look down, with a faded Guns & Roses t-shirt under a sport coat and jeans that were just tight enough. That sport coat hugged his body just right and the way those jeans sat on his hips should be illegal. He looked sexy and hot and he couldn’t believe he got to have his attention for an entire evening.
It was with a bright smile that Steve walked into the coffee shop. Granted, Jumpstart always brought a smile to his face, but today it was for a different reason. He waited patiently in line until he reached the counter. “Is it okay if I visit my boyfriend at work?” he asked with a smirk. He’d been waiting all night to say that. There was just something good about being able to call him his boyfriend. He wasn’t the guy he liked, he wasn’t the guy he was seeing - he was his boyfriend. It was official, it was established, and he loved it. He loved saying it, and he was never going to grow tired of it. He lost track of how many times he said it to his coworkers yesterday, and Bucky was already sick of hearing the word, but he didn’t care because he was just so happy.
“No! No no this…this is good,” he replied as he held onto Steve tighter. But he did look up at Steve, his eyes full of emotion. Steve knew what emotion he wanted to describe it as, but he refused to even entertain that word. It was probably gratitude or fondness, or something along those lines. It wasn’t…no. “Thank you, Steve.”
When he finally left the café, he decided to take that as a good sign. Half an hour of watching Tony’s butt move behind the counter trying to fill everyone’s orders put him in a great mood, and the fact that they’d actually managed to have a decent conversation filled him with a lot of hope. He even entertained the thought that maybe all the saucy comebacks were flirts, and that made his heart soar just thinking about it. He tried not to let himself focus on that hope too much and tried to ground himself in reality, but his heart refused to see it that way. In his heart, they’d made progress, and there was hope that this could actually turn into the relationship he so desperately wanted it to be.
He released the kiss and rested his forehead against Tony’s. “Are you doing better today?” he asked softly.
Tony shrugged. “Hey, you’re not obligated to be here,” he tried to brush off, but Steve could see that he almost glowed in relief, with a smile that lingered at the corners of his lips.
“So instead of using that body to sell my coffee, what is your new job?” he asked as he set the finished coffee down on the counter and leaned back against the wall.
“Well I love—it,” Steve finished quickly, face pinking slightly. “The pet name. I love it.” Why would that word not leave his mind?!
Tony shook his head. “I’m not upset. Just distracted. I’m fine.” He pulled Steve into a surprisingly passionate kiss that made his head spin. Unlike the other kiss, he was very much present for this one, but he also knew what he was trying to do.
Tony chuckled as he leaned back against Steve. “Is that a promise?” he asked as he arched his head back against Steve’s shoulder to look up at him. The question was meant to be flirty, but Steve could catch a vulnerability there that made his heart warm.
It was still dark when two men walked into the coffee shop. They unlocked the doors and flipped on a few lights in the back, but kept the sign on the door set to CLOSED. Hand-in-hand they walked into the back kitchen and separated with a kiss.
When they finally stopped the kiss, Tony gave his happy little sigh that set Steve’s heart fluttering and he had this dopey grin on his face. “I take it you missed me?”
“Yeah, I do,” he told him honestly. “I know it doesn’t seem like the right moment, but it’s the best way to fix this.”
“I do enjoy cuddling you,” he grinned before he finally pulled away, though he continued to rub his hand lovi—softly. He rubbed his hand softly. “You know what this means? We just need to find another night.” He knew that was easier said than done with Pete, but if this was going to work they would have to be able to spend that time with each other.
Yesterday had been terrible. He spent the whole day lamenting how he hadn’t been able to see his barista. Instead of new, fresh memories of him, he had to rely on his old memories, which were fine but not enough. He knew it was probably a bad sign that he relied on these daily interactions with Tony so much and that they brought him as much joy as they did, but honestly there were worst things he could focus on. If seeing a cute man smile and buying coffee every morning brought more joy into his life, then he really didn’t see a reason for him to stop.
“Yes, you do,” Steve insisted. “Pete?”
“New job huh? Darn, should have asked you sooner to be our spokesperson, but guess that’s off the table now,” he sighed as he shook his head like he was disappointed, but his voice was dripping in sarcasm.
Tony sighed. “While I’ll never say no to one of your hugs, because damn being pressed up against you feels good, and you smell good too right now, which is so unfair, but really Steve, I’m fine.”
“You sure?” Steve asked as he rubbed his hands along his side.
“So you never gave me a when or where,” Tony reminded with a sly wink as he made his coffee.
“Can I help you?” he asked with a no-nonsense voice that was still kind, and Steve realized he’d stood there frozen for a few suspicious moments.
“That’s what I like to hear,” he grinned proudly from behind the counter. “You enjoy that big guy, and if you ever want another, I’ll be here.”
He was about to make some stupid, hazy comment about how great that kiss was, but he didn’t get a chance before he felt Tony wrap his hands around his neck and pull him down for another kiss. This kiss was more vigorous, and he melted into it gladly. He felt Tony’s tongue lick at his lips, and he opened his mouth gladly. His tongue was soft and warm and it explored the inside of his mouth before it finally slid along his tongue. Steve moaned into the kiss as their tongues curled around each other. He reached his arms up to hold Tony’s shoulders as he let Tony deepen this kiss. They finally released the kiss with a breathless gasp as Steve stared into Tony’s eyes that were filled with such longing he couldn’t deny them. He needed another kiss. And another. And he didn’t think he could ever grow sick of them.
“Yes!” he cried out loudly again. “Yes please I—yes.”
“Actually, I am,” he admitted as he nuzzled his nose against Steve’s. “June twenty-ninth is…well it’s a shitty day, I’m not going to sugarcoat it, but you helped. Really muffin, you helped.”
“I don’t…I think I would remember saying that,” he stammered, trying to deny it on an impulse.
a kiss from Tony more than he needed to breathe. He had been waiting for their date to make it special, but if Tony was offering? He couldn’t say no. He just…he couldn’t. He knew he wanted to keep their date a surprise, but he wanted a kiss so much more than he wanted the surprise. “Uh…well I…um…” he stammered as he tried to think of a hint, of something to give him, but all he could do was stare at Tony’s luscious lips framed by that beautiful goatee.
“And he will, tomorrow,” Bucky assured him. “Look, he’ll have a shitty day and a shitty night, but it’s better for him to hear it tomorrow. He’s not going to listen today, or he’ll think you’re being dishonest. You gotta trust me on this Steve.”
