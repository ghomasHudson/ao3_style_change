“Forget it kiddo. If you’re the one showing us around, this is going to be far more fun than I expected.” John shifted to include Sherlock in the conversation, opening the circle to all four of them. “Corporal House, this is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock, Gordon House.”
“I don’t know. Perhaps if I had the time and the palate, I’d be willing to taste things… No. Not at all. Never.” Nick took the bag from Towerblock and scanned the small crowd that had gathered by the cordon.
It was becoming rather insufferable, making these trips. It wasn’t on his way. It wasn’t near anything or anyone to whom he would even consider leaving Whitehall to pander. And yet, it seemed that another late night and concerned word whispered in his ear was enough to force his hand and delay his schedule only to find that his esteemed brother was having himself a lie-in.
His arms moved to cross over his chest. “Captain Medhurst, do you care to explain why you are bleeding?”
He watched from the window, knowing how it would sting but helpless to stop himself, as John reached the corner and disappeared from view. The winter night wrapped like a thick cloak around the street outside, the violent orange of the streetlamps muted in the cold fog of late evening.
The loud crack of high-powered rifle shot echoed across the yard and Gee’s yelp became a bitten off shriek as a chair somewhere behind her blew apart into multiple pieces of deformed plastic and metal.
Smith smiled ruefully. “We are. And were it just Terry Taliban taking pot shots at the gates, I wouldn’t mind. But the sneaky buggers are going after my bomb disposal unit and they’re being right unsporting about it.”
“Fucking hell, what?” Mag Aoidh stopped shy of the table and crossed her arms. “I was with a patient.”
“Lance Corporal,” Smith said sternly. “Though I’ve never expressly explained this, NOT letting the ATO get shot is whatever rule comes before the first rule!”
“Feels strange. Leaving again, I mean.” He flashed a self-deprecating smile. “At least it’s planned this time. No fun being med-evac’d while unconscious and bleeding out.”
“I swear to God, Gee, if I have to come back there and draw a diagram explaining why that is just about the worst idea you’ve ever had, I will make you walk out past the cordon to prove my point and you’ll need a medic yourself.”
“I would never… Not… At least not again…” John trailed off as Gee slowed to a trot approaching the DFAC. “Hey look, there’s your medic.”
Gee moved like a flash, throwing a solid right hook into Simon’s jaw before he could flinch. And he hit the ground with a squawk as Gee gasped and caught herself with an arm pressed hard to her ribs.
“I’m not going out there, you git!” John shoved Sherlock’s shoulder, pinning him back against the mastiff. “I’m just trying to draw their fire.”
“No. No, look,” Towerblock glared over the edge of his bunk at Mac then at Rocket. “If any one of you mentions this, I will personally make sure you have months of the worst KP you can imagine.”
“Be a dote and kill the light. You can think in the dark. Or sleep.” John dropped flat on his back, draping his right arm over his eyes. “Won’t have the only light on in the FOB. Makes us a target.”
John just chuckled and headed out of their bunk. Absolutely determined to pretend there was nothing out of the ordinary about waking up with Sherlock in his arms. Because now was, most certainly, not the time for that kind of distraction. People were shooting. For God’s sake.
With a heavy sigh, Gee eased down onto the cot, only uncrossing her arms to brace her palms against the frame of the bed beside her hips. “It really isn’t that bad.” As a final protest, it was weak. “I’d know if my ribs were broken.”
“Ah.” Sherlock nodded slowly. “So not only does he gain position on the team, but he exacts some sort of justifiable revenge for a girl you dumped horribly.”
“I know, let’s bake a cake.” Rocket perked up, turning towards Simon with a big grin until Simon added, “We can put ‘Up the Ra’ on it?”
Towerblock opened his eyes from where he was sunning himself and shot Bird a wry smile. “Do you think idiocy is like cloud cover? I want an even tan.”
Gee darted around the side of the building, dashing through the uncovered space to reach Loo. “Christ!” She planted both hands on the bleed point of his leg as she dropped to her knees, ignoring his shout. “Jesus, Loo.”
And Sherlock was still talking. He spoke. Rambled. Babbled. The words no longer made sense. Don’t worry. Don’t need. All fine. And John couldn’t decide what he felt anymore, except that he was either about to shout or vomit or both. And he figured he’d better decide before his gut decided for him. And John Watson fell back on what made him comfortable. He shouted. Barked really. Just one word.
“Shut up, you pompous twat,” she hissed back. It was the work of a few minutes before she was happy it was nothing more than a graze and it was dressed well enough to stop bleeding. “You’re also a drama queen.”
Sherlock gave John a lopsided smile and raised an eyebrow. “Um, when you were trying to work up the nerve to kiss me?”
“Enough, Sherlock. Enough. One day we’ll know more about how traits are passed down in families, and then you’ll know that you were responsible for keeping John from doing the right thing. And then you’ll have to live with your guilt.”
Sherlock blinked, pursed his lips, blinked some more, and leaned down as far as he could. He inspected the creature, recording the data and running it through his mental files:
Ereubs nods, but does not move away. He regards Anahera carefully, his curiosity respectful and kind. “She’s very rare, Sherlock, very special,” he whispers. “I’ve only ever heard of her kind before.”
“Drive safely, boys, and have a wonderful time! Your first anniversary, oh, it’s so romantic! Don’t you worry about a thing here, I’ll keep my eye on the flat and collect your mail.”
“We don’t know what the person after me knows or what information he learned about me when he was at my house, but if he knows that John and I are friends, the two of you might not be safe. As I only just met Annette a few days ago, there’s no way anyone could know to look for me at her flat. She’s closer to the police than you are. Finally, staying with her would allow me to get out from under your feet.” James held Sherlock’s gaze as he finished speaking, his head held high.
Sherlock doesn't answer. John holds his heart. Johnling. If John is on Pobeda, that is where Sherlock's home is. If John is on Cassiopeia, that is where Sherlock's home is. If John were on the moon, Sherlock would be at home there, as well.
Sherlock looked down at the book in his hand and saw right away what John meant when he said the gift was about an idea.
The boys spent Christmas Eve between their two houses, helping with last minute preparations. They cleaned out the refrigerator at Sherlock’s house so Mrs. Hudson had room for her side dishes. They unpacked china at John’s house, and pretended to polish silver. They moved furniture at Sherlock’s house, brought the kitchen table into the family room, then inserted its leaves to make it longer. They helped Mrs. Watson peel potatoes, and chop celery and carrots, but they made Harry peel and chop the onions.
John reached for his own phone with his non-Sherlock arm and found Greg’s number. Sherlock yawned and stayed nestled under the blankets, plastered to John’s side.
“Mmm.” Sherlock was aware that he was grinning just as besottedly as John, but couldn’t seem to do anything about it.
He asks Olive, and she ruffles the feathers on the top of his head, and says that for her and Siger, it felt different after bonding because they could have hatchlings together, and therefore, would always be connected through their offspring. Sherlock knows that's not what it is for him.
Sherlock brushed the crumbs off his fingers, rinsed the milk carton out, and tossed the knife into the sink. He was about to turn around when he felt John press up against him and wrap his arms around his waist. He felt John's breath at the top of his spine.
Mrs. Watson reached over and put her palm to John’s forehead. “You don’t feel warm to me. Have some more soup. It’s good for you. Probably not getting enough sleep.” The last bit was muttered under her breath, but as it didn’t seem to be a veiled reference to their relationship, or nighttime proclivities, Sherlock didn’t take offense.
"They help hold the dress up. Something strapless is more likely to slip down with nothing to hold it up, especially with dance moves like these."
John bit Sherlock’s lip and growled into his mouth, “Let’s get a cab. Now. Come on, we need to get back, now.”
Sherlock peeled the foil off the neck of the wine bottle and rolled it into a ball. Annette had a point, he had to admit.
Sherlock took it all in as the hostess led them to their table. It was only when she stepped away after pulling out one of the chairs that Sherlock realized Mycroft was already seated and waiting for them. The two seconds of silence before anyone spoke was enough time for him to observe his older brother and come to several conclusions. Mycroft’s hair was already thinning at the temples and he had lost any evidence of his youthful slenderness. Based on his suit, tie, and well-manicured nails, he was earning far more money than any self-purported local government job would pay. Perhaps most important, the fine sheen of sweat on his upper lip indicated he was at least as nervous as Sherlock. Maybe more.
And yes, there he is, his John, almost hidden from view by a small entourage of friends and family. John has his back to Sherlock and is stooped at the shoulders, no doubt keeping his careful eye on the egg. Sherlock stays on the outside of the circle of pengs and hums the first few notes of their call. The song stays soft in his throat, faint and low, but John stands tall and twists around. His eyes are round and bright, seeking, so Sherlock calls again. John sees him.
Sherlock has no doubt she will win them over, one by one, until the entire colony falls under the spell that is no spell at all.
Sherlock didn’t know why he was the way he was, so he shrugged and said, “I just like knowing stuff.”
Mycroft sniffed and averted his gaze. “While that might be accurate,” he began before Sherlock cut him off again.
“No opera for me, thanks,” John said, slipping his postcard bag into his backpack and zipping it back up.
The en suite bathroom was bigger than Sherlock’s studio apartment at school. He took in the matte-white clawfoot tub at the far end, the long countertop with two ceramic vessel sinks, and the shower with three glass sides. The shower was big enough for three or four people, and had a large, overhead rain feature, and wall-mounted massage jets. Next to the enclosed shower he spotted towel heaters, and two hooks for bathrobes, but only one bathrobe.
There was nothing for a small eternity, just gasping for breath, twitching, small contented hums. John was a dead weight on top of Sherlock, a welcome one, a weight that kept him from flying into pieces. He was aware of the pillow under his head, like a cradle, and the robe under his back, and the quilt under his heels. He could smell them, their sex, John’s sweat, his shampoo, his deodorant. He could taste their kisses, John’s lips, his own shouts, in his mouth.
“We aren’t like that. That doesn’t mean we can just do whatever we want wherever we want, though. Chicago has been great for us, in terms of being ourselves, but you know we can’t necessarily—”
Sherlock thought that sounded much better than sharing their first kiss over the remains of camembert and manchego, not to mention in view of the other patrons in the restaurant. “Yes. Let’s go.”
Sherlock was awake, lying on his stomach, his arms folded under his head. John was next to him, sound asleep on his back, one arm flung up over his head, the other pressed along Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock pushed in, slowly, accommodating for the new position. When he was about halfway in he stopped and asked John if he was okay.
This time away differs from the first journey, when Sherlock had battled fears about another peng stealing his love. Sherlock has no such insecurities now. The unknowns that plagued him ‒ will John wait, will they be free to choose each other, will the High Council understand ‒ are remnants of bygones. In a way, this peace of mind is as much a curse, because Sherlock knows what he has left behind. He knows the strength of a bond witnessed by all, and the security found in a call heard only by him.
John stayed quiet until the bedroom door closed behind them, then he crowded up against Sherlock, who had been trying to pull off his socks, and said, “Tell me.”
John thought long and hard about what kind of date to plan for Sherlock and realized he'd have to come up with something Sherlock had never done before, and hopefully something that Sherlock didn't know about John. It took a bit of organizing, but when everything was ready he felt good about the prospect of surprising the man who was constantly surprising him.
“The hotels aren’t that bad, actually. I checked travelocity, and some of the hotels are coming in around $120 a night. Nice ones, like the Palmer House, and the Sofitel. But those are downtown, and I’m not sure if we want to stay there, or in Lincoln Park, or some other neighborhood.”
John hums and moves behind Sherlock, keeping one wing on him the whole time. Sherlock feels John's chin on his shoulder, and his chest and belly against his back, and then his breath in his ear.
John let go of Sherlock’s wrists and lowered himself down, half on top of Sherlock, with his head on his shoulder. He hugged his arm around Sherlock’s waist and squeezed. “You were never freakish, Sherlock. You were always just so much smarter than everyone else.”
He didn’t want to be caught snooping, although looking at photographs on a bedside table could hardly be called that, so he climbed into bed, turned off his light, and pulled the covers up under his arms. Uncomfortable, he sat up a bit, then shuffled down again, trying to figure out how to look casual while lying in someone else’s bed. No, not someone else’s bed. His husband’s bed, he told himself, and therefore his bed, too. What would he do at home? He’d not lie there on his back staring at the canopy of the bed, that’s for damn sure. He turned onto his side, facing the inside of the bed, and soon enough heard the bathroom door open and close.
This is the 42nd chapter, which means I've been updating for 42 weeks. I know that's a long time in terms of remembering a lot of the mythology in this story, so I thought I'd offer a little summary:
John and Maryle step a small distance away, but Sherlock cannot be bothered to afford them any privacy. He stands, facing them, and stares. Maryle clears her throat a few times and gives John pointed looks while nodding her head in Sherlock’s direction, but John either doesn’t pick up on it, or doesn’t feel inclined to move any farther away.
“Sadly, most penguins do not know that they have lost their mate until the next mating season, when they call, and there is no answer. At that point, you will hear another call in response to yours, and will then take a new mate.”
Please note that I've added a chapter to the final count, as this one became unruly and happierstill and I decided to split it. You will be happy to know that the next chapter is entirely sex, like 3,500 words of it. Speaking of happierstill, I would be remiss if I did not thank her for her thoughtful comments, questions, and multiple read-throughs.
“Yeah, yeah, of course you can. This must be kind of hard for you. I hadn’t really thought of it.” Lestra moves to shimmy out of the seaweed bound across his shoulders, neck, and chest, but Sherlock stops him with a small shake of his head and a tap of his wing to the centre of the heartstone.
“And I wake up this morning, and I have an egg on my feet, and here you are. Now, do not get me wrong. John and I are ecstatic, as you can probably tell by the tear tracks covering most of my body. But, I come to find you, and you smile at me, and say ‘hello’?”
“I suppose I don’t really think of my situation as an arranged marriage as much as the result of a dating service. I did meet John through the Program but I wasn’t required to marry him. I chose to.”
a healer,” Sherlock corrects. “He’s a natural, hatched to help others. He never even noticed his own injury after the seal attack, he just kept helping others, right alongside our healer, Cetus. Did I say that he’s very brave?”
John chewed on a bread roll and pondered the question. “Maybe,” he answered. “I was reading about those prostate massage things in that store. One of those might be interesting for the person not being massaged, so to speak, or maybe for when we’re apart.”
“Thanks. My point, though, is that the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum are what fill with blood when a penis gets erect. Figuring out the cubic inches of your penis won't do you any good. You really just need to figure out the baseline of blood while in a flaccid state, and then apply what we know about the increase in blood, which is about—”
Before I forget, in order to get the "16 acres" amount, I googled "How much does farmland in WI cost?" and came up with an answer of approximately $3,550/acre. Tuition at the University of Chicago is about $55,000/year, so about 16 acres a year. Sherlock and Mycroft have 460 acres, making Sherlock's half 230, of which he'd basically give 64 to Mr. Watson in exchange for John's tuition.
He would generally wait an hour or two after the courier came so that Mummy would have a chance to go through them herself, and then he’d sneak into the library under the pretence of picking out or returning a book to one of the dozens of built-in shelves, and he’d peek. That’s all he would do. Peek.
Sherlock finds that he needs to swallow too, and blink back the irritating moisture trying to escape his eyes. Odd, that. He was sure he had already expelled all of the residual brine extracted from the seawater in his body.
Sherlock took a few more photos, each one exposing a bit more than the last, then got out of bed. He took a shower, and went downstairs to help Mrs. Hudson, trying to keep busy until the Watsons arrived.
“As soon as I’m done with biochem. That’s from nine to eleven, and I’ll probably use the entire time. But the truck will be packed and ready to go, so the second I’m done, I’m on the road. I guess that gets me in at about, what, three?”
“It’s okay. It really is, John, don’t feel bad. Go. Take her to lunch, spend the afternoon with her, make her happy. Text me later, and we’ll get together.”
John turned them around and angled them toward the center of the rink where there were fewer groups to avoid. “Anyway. There were no nets set up yet, so we just chased the puck around, trying to steal it away from each other. You had grown about four feet that year, no, I’m serious, you had, and you were super fast. I couldn’t keep up, and it was pissing me off because we’d always been pretty evenly matched.”
. They found the tooth on Cassiopeia, which is where we go in the summer. I know that you and Uncle Mycroft met
This chapter revisits the Legend of Kororā. Please note that I have changed Kororā's father's name from Kararehe, to Atutahi; I'll explain more in the endnotes.
“Not only did they reclaim the stolen artefact, but when tasked with the responsibility of delivering the tooth to the High Council, Sherlock was able to interpret the star-shaped marking on its underside. For the first time in known pengstory, an emperor held that tooth and understood what the shape meant. The marking represented an exceptional star – Kororā and Ika’s father, Atutahi. Sherlock followed it, and then, with assistance from his Rūnangan escorts, Anahera and Tui, he found something extraordinary.
“I understand, Sherlock. One doesn’t travel as far as you have to see the High Council, and then blabber all over the place about the business at hand.”
Next to him, John begins to clench and shake his left wing. Sherlock wraps his wing around John’s back, and rests his chin on the top of John’s head. He can feel the tremors moving through John’s entire body now, sending waves of his manifested anger directly into Sherlock.
Sherlock put his phone down and let his head rest against the back of the armchair he was sitting in. What would it be like, he and John living together at Baker Street? Despite it being his family’s flat, he was really the only one who ever spent any time there. Over the years he had transferred everything Mummy didn’t want in Oxfordshire to 221b and the space had become more and more cramped with mismatched furniture, stacks of chemistry journals, cold case files, newspaper clippings, shelves upon shelves of books, odd specimens, laboratory equipment, and of course, the skull that she had absolutely refused to let him bring into the house. For the love of all that was sacred, he reflected, it wasn’t as if he’d tried to bring home a wild animal. It was a skull, its owner long-deceased.
“Well, sure, of course,” John said, and although Sherlock was trying to temper his enthusiasm John found relief flooding through him. “But, I can’t help but feel hopeful.” He smiled, pouring the hot, creamy milk into the cup and swirling it until the syrups at the bottom melted. The scent of buttery, nutty, chocolatey goodness rose up and tickled John’s nose.
He nudged his book and half a glass of water out of the way, and looked at the clock on his nightstand.
John rubs his cheek down the length of Sherlock’s neck, then presses his bill to Sherlock’s. John closes his eyes and kisses Sherlock, just the lightest brush of bill on bill, and Sherlock kisses back.
“After everything that has happened, I am still not sure if the legends are true, or if they are of our own making. I'm not sure it matters. What does matter is that the heartstone is the way back to hope. Because that’s what
“You’d have put money in but there’s no way in hell we would've kissed in front of a crowd of people egging us on.”
Mr. Watson came in the back door at five minutes to 6:00, scrubbed his hands at the kitchen sink, kissed Mrs. Watson, and took his seat at the table. Within thirty seconds the food was served, each of them with their own pot pie, the puffed pastry on top browned to a shiny glaze. There was a bowl of salad in the center of the table, glasses of milk for the boys, a Coors for John’s dad, and water for his mom. Mrs. Watson made sure everyone had what they needed before she took her own seat, then passed Mr. Watson the salt and pepper before he could ask for it.
Mrs. Hudson waved off his apology. “Never you mind. I brought up tea and coffee, and just finished this batch of scones, dearie.”
John rubbed a hand over his eyes in frustration and managed to smudge patches of sanguine through his eyebrow and across his temple. “Christ, you are impossible!”
Self-preservation had never been one of his strong suits. But in spite of his intention to move forward again, a small palm planted itself over his sternum and shoved. Hard. For a moment, he was surprised by just how much force Mag Aoidh had managed to put behind the thrust that had propelled him behind the mastiff and flat on his back.
“Very good. There are support staff, other units that use the base, but they are otherwise transitory.”
“Living in London is expensive,” he muttered into his hands. “And supplies are insanely expensive, and food is expensive, and pints with the lads is expensive, and Jesus, rent is just fucking insanely expensive. And why are you looking at me like that?”
The burst of gunfire broke through the tinnitus and he winced. Hearing was back then. Oh, and the coms were on.
The sigh would be the last sound that Sherlock Holmes would bloody well make. Because Sherlock sighed as he came home as if he was sodding put out that someone was waiting up for him. Sighed like John was a nervous pet or a nagging wife or some sort of fucking burden and John was spitting fire as he turned around. His ears were practically ringing with his own rage. He was going to incinerate Sherlock Holmes with a single look. He was going to… He was going… to…
“I know that already,” he grinned. “What I want to know is if you’ve seen Gee without her shirt on.”
“Mine?” His brows shot up for a moment before he thought better of it and narrowed his eyes. “Which expertise are we talking about?”
“John!” Sherlock grabbed the front of his shirt and yanked him back down behind the body of the vehicle. “If I’m not allowed to be an idiot, neither are you!”
“Come on, Captain,” John grabbed her arm and hauled her back up to her feet. “There’s water in the CV.”
Sherlock stands on the ledge and looks for a way around the obstacle in his way. Ice. So much ice on this stupid iceberg, he thinks to himself. He could try to climb over the protuberance, but if he slips, if he falls, he’s done for. Frustrating as it is, he’s going to have to retreat, and try to ascend from a different angle.
“I can’t ask James to leave until I know he’ll be safe. Help me figure out who’s after him. If we can figure that out, he can go home, or leave here at the very least. Please.”
After breakfast, they adjourn to the training grounds. Here, the eight Junior Pengs, as they’ve come to call themselves, join the six Senior Pengs, and they spend the morning learning the workings of the colony, and the detailed history of their past. They learn the myths and legends that grew from the sky, when the world below was still only an idea. They memorize important names and events that, when strung together, create the essential journey to where, and who, they are now.
It is soft dusk when the last emperor has filed past. The sky reflects a mix of colour and starshine, light and dark. The heartstone’s glow has faded to a deep red burn.
Sherlock took a big bite of chocolate muffin and chewed. He wasn’t sure he had a monkey in this circus, to be honest. He hadn’t touched that Laffitte asshole, but he was ready to defend John should this conversation go south.
All these years, minutes upon days, upon weeks, upon months, of sharing this space, the work, their personal lives; all the harrowing rearrangement of John’s life, had led to the crystal clear realization that he’d rather have what he did with Sherlock, than anything with anyone else. He’d have accepted more, of course he would’ve, but this was a boat easily rocked, and John was resigned to not stirring unnecessary squalls.
Anahera stands out no matter where she is, but she is impossible to miss now, walking with her head held high, her wing pressed to Tui’s side. Tui’s limp is barely noticeable, and although she must rely heavily on her tail for balance, Sherlock senses it is mostly joy that bolsters her now.
John reached out, fingers arced, and touched Sherlock’s face. His fingertips trailed down his cheek to the square corner of his jaw, down his neck, and over his chest. His hand came to rest on Sherlock’s waist, with his fingers curled around his side.
Mrs. Hudson patted Sherlock’s knee, but Mr. Watson was the one who answered. “I figure I’ve got another fifteen years in me, son, and I already know that John and Harriet won’t take it on, but when the time comes I’d hire a new management team to do what I can't. I have no intention of selling. Land is the best investment there is, and if I can pass down my share of such a large plot to my children, I’d consider that a success.”
In front of him the bartender was arranging the round of drinks on a tray. Sherlock handed over two twenties and grabbed some cocktail napkins from a pile on the counter.
Sherlock picked up the duffel bag and pried John’s cold fingers open, took John’s hand in his, and led him up the stairs.
He bends low again, canting his hips to one side, his own erection bobbing between the black lines of corset and stockings. He undoes the clasp and zip of John's trousers and pulls them down and off his legs, then folds them neatly and places them with the shirt. John is wearing snug boxer briefs that are stretched over the bulge of his cock, tight around his upper thighs. John has his arms folded underneath his head now, his biceps and deltoids sharply defined, the hollows of his underarms pale beneath the soft tufts of hair. The expanse of his chest is broad, his abdomen flat and smooth, adorned only by the line of darkening hair that disappears into his briefs. Sherlock's mouth is watering now, his heart rate running wild.
Sherlock watches John glide away, trying not to be obvious as he stares at John’s upturned tail and the tufts of silky feathers around his strong legs. He continues to watch as John reaches his destination, checks the chick for any damage, and brushes off her snow-covered shoulders and face. With a kind word and gentle nudge, he sends her back in the direction of her friends.
“I see. And is Sherlock right? Did he seek revenge against Apo for what he did to his sister, and to Pono?”
They hug, swaying, the silence between them conveying more than words could ever wish to speak, inspecting each other for health and happiness and success.
“I’ve had this since I was twelve, Sherlock! No matter what you think of my playing ability, you can’t abuse my instrument!”
“Okay, okay, shhh. It’s okay. Take a deep breath, Sherlock. Slow down.” John had held both his hands in his while Sherlock had vented, and was rubbing his thumbs in circles over his palms. “It’s okay, love. And I’m sorry, so sorry, that I didn’t see how seriously uncomfortable you were with coming here tonight. I am so sorry.” John let go of one of Sherlock’s hands and pulled his own bandanas out of his pockets, then dropped them to the floor.
Sherlock inched his knees apart and thrust forward again. The angle was shallow and he wasn’t sure he’d be able to fully penetrate John, but by the sounds John was making he knew they were both going to get there in the end.
I wrote this, and then agenttanha and mmelibrarian88 asked me to put it on AO3 (asked, demanded, whatever), so here it is, a bit cleaned up for errors and typos.
“I love the way you feel. I love the way you look. I love that if I look down right now, I'll see my dick between your ass cheeks, and it'll look so fucking hot, I won't be able to breathe for a second.”
“I'd like to end the game before dinner, but thank you for your input,” Lestra answers. “It's three for everyone else, so how about ten for Sherlock?”
“You two are adorable, and I’m very happy for you. And, in retrospect, I’m really sorry that I showed up at your house on Thanksgiving. That must have been horrible for both of you.”
“Repeatable.” Sherlock propped himself up above John and smiled down at him. A damp curl partially blocked his view. “It really was rather good, wasn’t it?”
John still looked like he wanted to order Sherlock right on top of the table, but he put his glass down and picked up his menu. “Um, I don’t know. I don’t know what half this stuff is. Like cashew-lime puree.”
“I think it was the scent. We read books, and sang songs, and took baths, and all of that, too, but I think it was associating the lavender scent of the bear with sleep that did it for him. He always has had such a keen sense of smell. He could tell all sorts of things about people by picking up on scents that none of the rest of us could detect at all. Wouldn't wear clothes that had been washed in certain detergents, wouldn't eat food that smelled a certain way. But once he had associated NoNo with sleep, he slept.”
John raised his head and stared at Sherlock. “Babe, how do you know all this? That was, what, seventeen years before we were even born.”
“I do like it. It’s never dull,” John said, uncapping a container of broken up toffee shards. “It’s challenging in a different way than school is, which I like. It gives me a break from being inside my brain all the time and lets me use my body and mind in a more simple way. I’m always moving, always meeting new people, and coffee can be a science and an art if you put in the time.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t expected to be pulled into Mrs. Watson’s dating manipulations. John leaned back against the sink and smirked at him.
Sherlock was halfway to that kiss before the bishop was done talking, and John met him and sealed their lips together as the bishop declared that they could
“Mary something. She was always very friendly, but I never thought much about it. She overheard me on the phone with you one day before class started and when I hung up she looked all bent out of shape, you know? I asked her if she was okay and she asked if I was seeing someone. I said I was, and she said I had some nerve, flirting with her and leading her on. She said she thought I was going to ask her out and if she'd known I was dating someone she wouldn't have flirted back. Thing is, I had no idea she was flirting or thought I was flirting. I thought I was just being friendly.”
Couples disperse as they leave the parade, and Sherlock knows they will seek out a place to mate. He remembers what John told him of a newly bonded pair’s behaviour, but has no desire to observe what he will someday experience himself. For now, he enjoys his and John’s mutual exploration of each other’s bodies, their petting and hugging and kissing, and the warmth that flows through him when John whispers private words in his ear.
Sherlock turned his head to the right and squinted. It was the doctor. The Laffitte guy with the cerulean turtleneck. He wasn’t as old as Sherlock had thought, now that he could see him up close. Prematurely grey. Fit. Short. Napoleon complex. Probably had a teeny dick.
“Why are you making tea?” John counters, although he knows that there is no question, no matter how direct, that Sherlock cannot weasel his way out of if he doesn't want to give an answer. John contemplates this and then lets out a small groan of recognition. “What have you done, Sherlock?”
When Erebus comes, Sherlock finds himself shocked by his friend’s disimproved appearance, though his kind and gracious countenance remains constant. Erebus’ eyes are clouded, his gait slow. His back curves, as if under a great weight. His body is failing him, but his spirit is strong. Sherlock goes to him, wraps his wing around this most stalwart emperor, and guides him the last short distance to John and their egg.
“Sherlock. At one time I thought perhaps you and I – but then – and you came back – but I – and now – now, Sherlock, after all this time, I wonder, would you still have me?”
“Like Kororā and Pono?" Sherlock asks. "I don't even know if they really existed, but regardless, they exist in our history, and they will be always together.”
Sherlock delivered the drinks, looked up at the ceiling for a second, and said, “I think we’ll probably be going now. I apologize for … that.”
“Yeah. Crazy.” Kevin shook his head, still grinning, then looked over at Rudy. “You both met Rudy? Salt of the earth right here, Rude. These two grew up on neighboring farms. Chickens, horses, tractors, the whole lot. More corn and soy than you could shake a stick at.”
"Oi! Enough! Go check in with Anderson, see if he's finished processing the bedroom yet." Donovan huffed but obediently left, her footsteps stomping up the stairs.
“Enough, Simon. Mac? Rocket?” Nick bobbed his head towards the mastiff. “Shall we fuck off home?” He was met with a collective ‘Aye!’ from the pair. “Then pull out your thumbs and let’s go.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Because I need some supplies from home, and we really ought to have a chat with your flatmate.”
“’Course,” Gee smiled into her coffee. “But it’ll be two days before they stop treating it like a shrine, and half a day to realize what they could be using it fer.”
“Haggis?” Simon grimaced. “That boiled stomach-bag of sheep pluck, suet, and oatmeal? Unfortunately, yes.”
“Captain Medhurst, the med tent. Now please. And Corporal House, I would like a word. In my office.”
The Major saluted formally before shaking the Lieutenant Colonel’s hand. “Lieutenant Colonel, it’s a pleasure.”
“What did you mean by a daisy-chain?” Towerblock crossed his arms over his chest and tilted his head to the side.
Nick shrugged. “Oh, you know, just expressing myself the way generations of high society, British men have learned to do.”
Nick rolled his eyes. “Now that I’ve been forced to abandon the culinary delight that Biffa managed with what I can only assume was congealed maggots and red colored paste, what can I possibly do for you?”
John raised his brows but glanced at his empty mug. “I was due a refill.” He could feel Sherlock’s eyes track his progress to the coffee. But even the distance wasn’t enough to hide the rumble of Sherlock’s voice. Maybe it was how well attuned John was to the sound or maybe Sherlock had pitched his voice just so John could hear. Either way, it wasn’t a private conversation.
A few of the more nebulous details slotted into place and Sherlock’s face lit with understanding. “He knew you had a crush on me.”
John leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his thighs. “I spent an hour today stitching up Captain Mag Aoidh. And that makes me cross, Sherlock. She was lucky, or unlucky, depending on how you look at it, because the shrapnel missed her vest by an inch and managed to slice into her shoulder.”
Martha Hudson listened with a heavy heart to John's stomping footsteps in the flat above. Oh, Sherlock. How could you? You silly, silly boy, she thought, wringing her hands absently. She'd promised John she would go to bed but she was too worried. Worried about Sherlock, haring off on his own again like he used to; he hadn't done that in so long. Worried about John, striding back and forth across her rugs, clenching his hands at his sides. Worried about all the people that Sherlock helped, and that cared about him, and that worried for him. Even Mycroft. She worried about him too. Martha tightened her thick dressing gown around herself and sighed, settling into her chair by the fire. She would wait up. At least a little longer. She was too worried to sleep right now.
“No, Sir. We are all in one piece, as are the vehicles. I’ve two whole and uninjured PONTIs, a dusty unit, some rather irritating tinnitus, and solid IED, rendered-safe and ready for the WISWO.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson clucked, one of her hands brushing his cheek beneath a blooming black eye. Even from across the distance, Mycroft could read the stiffness in his brother’s gait, the hesitance in his movements. Injuries concealed. Mostly minor. Mostly soft-tissue. Albeit slower to heal at his age and state of being. All well tended. Not a single mark on him would be the result of Dr. Watson’s hands. Unlike the hickey on Dr. Watson’s neck.
“What about me?” Mag Aoidh crossed into DFAC. “And unless the next words out of yer mouths is ‘here’s your cuppa’ then I don’t even want to know.” She brushed past them, heading for the coffee.
John swatted his shoulder with the back of his hand. “Oi. Keep mouthing off. See what happens.” Even the back of Sherlock’s neck flushed, but John plowed on, ignoring it completely. “I’m going to grab a cuppa. Feel free to swing by the med tent when you’ve realized I packed your clean pants in the side pocket of your bag.”
It should have been enough, it should have been more than enough to keep him going. But it wasn't and it never would be.
"He's fine," Lestrade said, "I don't know where John is but Sherlock never mentioned he'd be coming. So I dunno, maybe at the surgery or something, joining later?"
“I was unaware that was a problem to which I was required to attend,” he said dismissively, picking up a fork and poking at the food. “Is this supposed to be edible?”
John cleared his throat and leaned forward, planting his elbows on his thighs. “It wasn’t about the rugby. Or… It wasn’t just about that…”
“You’ve seen the company I keep. I’ve not gotten better. Now give me that and get the second one over to Armstrong.”
Her boys had been through so much, both together and apart. She'd been there right at the start, to see Sherlock's eyes light up at John, to see Sherlock bring colour back to John's life after so long in shades of beige and grey. They fit together, belonged at each other's side, anyone who merely glanced at them could see it. Everyone who knew them could see it. But it was so tentative and unspoken between them and it made Martha's heart break to see them so uncertain and cautious.
Lestrade had tried to insist on an ambulance but had given up when Sherlock had simply walked away, making sure to be seen hailing a cab. The effort in throwing up his arm at the side of the road had pulled agonisingly on the slashes in his skin and he could feel his tattered shirt sticking to his skin where the blood had dried. Luckily none of the gang were particularly adept with their chosen weapons and the cuts felt as though they would be mostly superficial, none should require stitches. John would've known for sure, but Sherlock would clean himself, patch up the worst of them and fall into bed. Sleep. Sleep would help him heal. He pushed open the flat door with almost closed eyes and sighed heavily. He shrugged off his coat in the doorway, opened his eyes and froze.
“Alright, Holmes,” Nick leaned forward and braced his forearms on the table. “You might have my grunts fooled, but I wasn’t born yesterday. You’re a clever bloke and I’ve always respected that about you. But you and I both damn well know you’re not here to ‘facilitate an update in intelligence software.’”
Screwhole dropped back into his folding chair and unpaused the game, resuming the play-action without a batting an eye.
John sighed again. “You have to stop talking to me when I’m not here. We’ve been over this. And while we’re on the subject, rushing someone in the middle of a warzone is a terrible idea.”
“Major,” Sherlock purred in John’s ear. If he was surprised, John didn’t show it, merely raising an eyebrow as he continued to watch Lansley. “Having fun with your new pals?”
“You, me, and Watson,” Towerblock slid one of the rifles across the dead space between them. “First one to knock him down wins.”
Lestrade huffed out a laugh. “Oh yeah. He’s off… somewhere in the sun. We’re on our own on this one.”
Dr. Watson froze, his face turning bright red. Mycroft rolled his eyes. Now he was being petulant. It was a mild discomfort that wasn’t enough to make Mycroft balk. “If you insist on being childish about this, I will treat you as a child.”
“Black,” Sherlock pointed to the shoes. “Black,” the trousers. “Grey,” the shirt. “And,” Sherlock’s head tilted curiously. “Actually, your face has gone rather grey-green now.”
“Oh, yes sir,” Sherlock drawled. Even behind the reflective sunglasses, Sherlock could see John’s eyes tighten. He huffed out a sigh, “Yes, yes. Alright.”
Towerblock picked up one of the photos as Bird ran a finger over the lines of one of the documents. “Shit,” Bird mumbled. “That was Glad’s squad out of Pine.”
“So are you.” John blinked his eyes open. Sherlock was watching him, studying him with a familiar wariness, unfamiliarly focused straight at him. “Tell me you slept at some point.”
“Don’t be like that,” Nuttall chuckled. “If you’re anything like Medhurst, we can be mates. I can steal your fiancée, you can punch me in the face, and we’ll be right as rain.”
John gave Sherlock a wry look, but lost the severity in the face of the mischief in Sherlock’s grin. “Oh fuck off,” John couldn’t bite back a smile.
And Sherlock dropped onto the couch like a marionette with his strings cut. He winced as he hit the cushions, but then straightened stiffly and blinked up at John. When had his feet taken him across the room? When had John even crossed to the couch. When had he found his med kit? When…
Nick stood and dusted himself off, throwing his hands in the air. “Gee! For the love of your papist God, I am trying to work!”
“In the next CV and still terrified of you, so fuck off, Jazz.” Gee gave Loo’s hand a squeeze, “Jasmine is a friend of mine; she’ll take good care of you.”
It was another hour before they were loading into the CVs to head back to Frost. And John spent that hour watching. He watched as Medhurst managed to finish with the three small IEDs. He listened to the chatter between the infantry. He was well aware of the hushed quiet from the Bleep and local fixer. He wasn’t surprised at the solemn mood as the unit settled in their seats. And he didn’t miss the stiffness in the medic as she tried to find a comfortable position in her seat.
The loud ringing interrupted her relaxation and she snapped the chair down to the ground, reaching for the phone as Nick appeared at the head of the table.
“And how do I get him to focus?” Towerblock handed over the first rifle. “He has the attention span of a gnat.”
And the way he bristles at her polite contact is the only shelter he has. He can’t look her in the eye, and he couldn’t be near Sherlock. God forbid he nearly kill his best friend again. And John Watson certainly can’t bear to touch him, because all he can see if he has a hand on Sherlock’s skin is the blood pouring out from between his own fingers and that feeling of absolute desperateness that had him praying. Again. John Watson had prayed. And this was his penance. Self-imposed abstinence. Before he could damage anything else or anyone else with his fucking cursed touch. Healing hands? Not anymore.
The ping of bullets on metal only just preceded the loud snap of automatic fire. “CONTACT RIGHT!” Simon shouted, dropping to a knee and turning towards the shooting.
“I can probably see better from up there,” Loo tipped his head at the structures. “Better vantage point and all.”
Lestrade shook his head. “Neither of them seem to be available to answer their bloody phones. You get anything out of forensics?”
Simon glared at the extra person in his semi-private space. “No, mate. I’m not ‘alright.’ In case you haven’t noticed, I’m sodding well bleeding! Screwhole, tell your REME mate here to piss off!”
“Only on base. Nick is either trying it on with the Padre or having a wank over the Padre. Gordo’s probably watching. The CO is likely to show up the moment I mention him, so better not. Simon is probably crying in a corner. I’ve no idea what Loo does in his free time. And I,” Bird interlaced her fingers behind her head and smiled. “I am enjoying the fact that I’ve cleaned and shined all my toys, so I can sit here and-“
The smile was one that he knew looked false. It was a political, polite society expression that spoke more to duty than any overt emotion. “Perhaps you had not yet removed your earplugs.” Pipes creaked and Mycroft was glad his estimate of Sherlock’s sleep was on the far side of perfectly accurate.
“I would love to, Simon. But strangely, whenever I show my face, someone tries to blow it off. And I swear to God, Mac, if you so much as utter a blow job joke right now…”
Simon held up a hand in a wave. “Sorry. Yes. Bye. Good. Nick… There’s a…” he held the tips of his index fingers together and winced. “Small… Tiny problem. At the gate.”
“Oh good,” Bird pushed straight past them and pointedly gestured Gee towards a chair, clear of the pending Simon explosion. Gee couldn’t turn fast enough to keep up with Bird and her balance tilted dangerously.
“Of course not.” Nick’s smile was grim and sharp. “But thanks to our grounding, Glad’s now left-handed, Pine is short an ATO and two privates, and I have more than enough bitter to keep New Orleans swimming in Old Fashioneds. So as much fun as our little slumber party, night off was, it’s over.” He glared at Gee. “Next call is ours.”
“There are two recent additions,” he turned over the next sheet. “Captain Muireann Mag Aoidh. Medic. From Shankill, trained at Queen’s. Third tour. Requested remote placement after Basra and Bastion.”
“Ah, Muireann,” Bird tried to catch her arm as she passed, but Mag Aoidh was having none of it, storming out of the tent and across the yard. “Nice going, Simon!”
Sherlock startled and leaned away. “The subtlety of Scottish cuisine lost on your discerning palate?” John hid a chuckled by stuffing a large forkful of spaghetti into his mouth. Sherlock frowned at him, “When did he even get here?”
John huffed. “I don’t know if you remember, but the last time we went on base, it didn’t end particularly well.”
“I see your transport is nearly here. I’ll leave you to it. It seems most of Bluestone has come to see you off. So nice,” he smiled politely, or winced, it was hard to tell. “Being liked around here.”
“Inappropriate, Sherlock,” Dr. Watson grumbled, though it did not escape Mycroft’s notice that he was busy buttering a scone, and Dr. Watson did prefer jam. “Don’t be lazy. You’ve got legs, come get your tea yourself.”
“I’m not trying it on with anybody!” he shouted, throwing his hands up. He frowned at the passing private he’d managed to startle with his outburst and glared. “Carry on!”
John spun around sharply. “It IS something. And say what you like, but I’m grounding the whole of Bluestone for a week.”
“Sherlock, you literally have to trust the people around you with your life. All the time. It’s… Intense and… It just… It doesn’t make sense.”
Nick rolled his eyes, then rolled his head to the side as he spun to catch back up. “Listen, Bird. You share a bunk with Gee.”
Mary sighed. “Fine. Fine. But when I need a help with the Halloween party in two weeks, I fully expect you to volunteer.”
“Yes, bunk. Sorry, Holmes. Real estate on a FOB is in short supply. You and the Major will have to share.”
The question had been on the tip of his tongue. Had the battle been loud enough to necessitate earplugs? Surely, as much as they bickered, Dr. Watson would have the decency to keep it to a minimum at three in the morning. Sherlock, certainly not. But Dr. Watson? He was saved from asking, though deeply regretted the form in which his salvation came, by the very same Dr. Watson stumbling from the loo, in just his pants and what Mycroft would only describe as pleased smile on his face.
“So is this what ye do when you’re waiting for a call out? Sit around?” Mag Aoidh carefully rearranged a few of the items on the front of her kit, muttering a soft, “Why is everything here backwards?”
“Pretend all you want, Bird.” He waved a hand dismissively. “You’re not…” He paused and tilted his head, caught in a vague notion.
Sherlock groaned. The ringing in his ears was terrible enough to upset his balance and there was so much dust in the air he could feel it in his teeth. And for a moment, he couldn’t tell if he was about to be sick or the concussive blast had rattled his pancreas just so. John would have found that thought amusing. John. “John?!” It was more of a wheeze than a shout, and he forced himself to replace the missing air from his lungs and pushed up on his elbows.
“Fucking right you should.” He shifted one of the papers and frowned. “You know who would be good with this?”
Lestrade blew out a breath and nodded, his kind brown eyes full of approval. Sherlock hated how much he craved that warmth, that recognition of his skills. Brilliant, John would’ve said, and Sherlock would’ve locked that sound and that feeling away deep, somewhere safe. He hated that he needed it but more than that, he hated that it was Lestrade and not John providing it.
“Raining men.” Bird flashed a wry smile and patted his chest. “Just like the discos you went to up North.”
He closed his eyes and focused on the sound of Sherlock’s voice. Slow and steady. The rhythm of the palm stroking up and down between his shoulder blades. His hands were shaking when he managed to disengage his fingers from his hair, but he felt less likely to lose his lunch. “You can’t…”
“It’s not up to standard with the usual. Or maybe it’s above standard. Just figure it’s not right and I’d appreciate a second set of eyes.”
“Mac and Rocket wouldn’t notice anything short of their own castrations. Bird is Bird, she doesn’t complain, not really. I think she likes having another girl around the place. Loo is adjusting. He’s still pretty green, but a right enough bloke. And everyone seems to like Gee. Not just us, but the base.”
Gee let out a long sigh in the direction of the partial ceiling. “You know what I do,” she said finally.
It wasn’t so much that the door opened as it fell from the frame, and Gee stumbled out of the entry, Loo’s arm over her shoulder and a billow of smoke chasing behind.
Towerblock scratched at his chin and John almost smiled at how reminiscent it was of Murray. “The Lieutenant Colonel I suppose. But he called you in, didn’t he?”
“Then what exactly is the problem?” Sherlock poked the pressure plate with his index finger. “You mentioned that it wasn’t standard.”
John raised a brow. “If you’re done eating, I’d like a word.” He rose and gestured toward their bunk. “In private.” Sherlock sighed and pushed back from the table, making to follow John.
John leaned back, cautiously resting some of his weight against Sherlock’s chest. When he wasn’t immediately pushed away, he relaxed a bit further. “What about the name though?”
“Aren’t we all just so lucky that Gee is there. All the time. Saving Loo. Saving Nick. Punching me in the face.”
“No. Absolutely not. Your poor sense of humor not withstanding, I did think you were better than something like… This. So I’ll ask you one more time, what is
“Gee, I know you like your little tent. It’s quaint. But I prefer the open air of the chapel with God and Jesus-“
“I’m here, because the poor team that took the shout yesterday is worse for it. Lost two infantry and the ATO’s literal right hand.”
“Aye, because ye got yer eejit self shot! Now do you want to keep making fun of where I’m from or do ye want me to close that hole in yer side that’s gaping worse than yer maw, you pretentious prick?”
The Det was quiet; the odd surge of breeze shifting the canvas and rustling the wall maps. There was nothing preternatural about it, nothing extraordinary, just a small pocket of calm.
"Could of. But it's not worth losing our medic to an unspotted IED to see if someone might need her. It's not fair, but if she'd gone and someone took a shot at her, had another bomb, left a landmine..."
Simon sucked in a breath, forced a smile that looked more terrified than pleased, and shook his head. “He drove.”
Erikson held out both palms. “Sir, like I told Sergeant Donovan. It really… I’m not even sure… It doesn’t….”
“Captain Mag Aoidh narrowly avoided a few broken ribs, and eked by with just a handful of stitches. That I have to spend any of my time patching these kids up makes me cross. What makes me livid, Sherlock, is that she was out of position, she was injured to protect you.”
“It’s a survival trait.” Mag Aoidh gave Bird a wry look and sipped her coffee. “We make smaller targets.”
“John, this is an abomination! Delete!” He wrinkled his nose, winced as the expression aggravated his injuries, and frowned. “Delete! Oh God! Delete!”
He glanced up and quirked an eyebrow. The buzzing stopped. “No,” he said flatly. The buzzing started again.
Sherlock blinked as John pulled back and the brightness of the midday sun returned. John shook his shoulder and gave him a concerned look, lifting his thumb in question. Sherlock tried to pop his ears. Ah, the ringing was back. That was irritating. He gave a nod and returned the gesture and John was gone again. Damn him. Sherlock shook his head to clear it and frowned at the empty field stretching out in front of him. The dust was settling and the members of Bluestone who’d been out in the barren space were gone. Moved in closer. Bird was still off to his side, shouting down the coms. Lansley and McDowell were flat to the ground, aiming at whatever was left of the buildings, picking their shots carefully.
“Not the bomb! NOT THE BOMB!” Nick scrambled clear of the firing line and tucked down in the shelter of a structure.
Sherlock straightened and tucked both hands at the small of his back, mirroring John’s parade rest in his own way. “It’s a forward operating base.”
John braced himself off the front of the mastiff and opened fire again. Giving them a brief respite in the crossfire. “We still have two, Captain.”
“Yes. Thank you, Major.” Nick gave a closed lip smile as though he were trying to suck his face in through his own teeth.
“Me?” Mag Aoidh’s fingers curled into fists against the worktop. “Jesus! If I wanted to watch bigoted pricks like you get blown up, I’d never need left Shankill.”
Sherlock frowned and set a cautious hand on John’s shoulder. “Breathing too, I’ve heard, is rather important.”
“Yeah, right, okay. But that,” John gestured at the table. “Looks like new, fresh wire. And I’m pretty sure that’s the Fulton logo there on the pressure plate.”
Towerblock shouted an obscenity into his pillow, then leaned over the edge of his bunk to swing the thing at Rocket. “Ya, you plonker.”
“It’s a Peruvian chicken stew of sorts.” He paused to give a quick stir to the bubbling pot. “Spicy, with garlic, and cheese. Oddly Italian sounding when I describe it like that… My wife has found a new fascination with South American cuisine. I can rather see the appeal.”
“Please, Sherlock,” John looked up, eyes wide and desperate. “You can’t tell them.” He wet his lips and swallowed to keep his voice from cracking again. “You can’t…”
"John, I-," Sherlock started, then stopped, suddenly unsure. John just stared and stared, taking in every bruise, every tear, every cut, every drop of blood staining Sherlock's skin, hair and clothes. Sherlock shuddered and began talking at twice his normal pace, anything just to make John stay. Be here, be near to Sherlock again. Stay, he pleaded silently. Just stay. You don’t have to touch me, or treat my wounds or come anywhere close to me. Just, please, please stay.
“If you decide to be sound rather than a complete bell end, I won’t put you on neuro obs and bed rest.” Mag Aoidh crossed her arms. “Or, I can send you off to Bastion… If your trauma is just so much more severe than I can manage, and we all have to ask for God’s intervention.”
She flinched. The expression was covered quickly by a wrinkled nose and a sniff, but it was definitely a flinch. “Maybe a month or so. Hard to say for sure.”
Mac sighed and tried to pull Rocket away from the empty food line. “C’mon ya ninny. We can sit an’ relax.” He turned to see Simon talking to Gee and at the floor. “An’ we can stop Skip from doing whate’re the hell he’s doing.”
Mycroft’s response was the smallest flick of his brow, his eyes never leaving the page in front of him.
Nick buried a grumble in the process of lighting a cigarette. “Let’s just say that I’d rather get a buggering from a sandstorm than attend another event with that complete bell end. Come to think of it, why weren’t you there, Wills?”
“I don’t think so.” Greg grinned. “I think the first time he lips off, I’ll just yell, ‘Sherlock, I’m fucking your brother, now shut your mouth.’ And he’ll just sit there and blink for a while until his brain reboots.”
“Fine… I sodding well hate that word,” John muttered. “It’ll be easier for me to get at that lac if you’re lying down. Make yourself comfortable there, and I’ll fix that right up.” He pulled out the supplies, gave the jagged cut a cursory clean, and settled down to work. “It’s funny,” he said finally.
Mary gave Gee a long look before settling on the bench, pew, crate next to her. “Is everything alright?”
“Like you bloody well asked. Told.” John leaned back as Sherlock encroached on his space from above. “What? What are you doing?”
“Oh.” Gee rested her chin on the back of her arms and settled so that John could finish. “You’re not the only one injured in the line of duty.”
“And,” Sherlock held up the phone to study the picture against the project. “That’s not even red-green.” He tilted his head. “Or blue-yellow.”
“Loo,” John finished for her with grin. “I get that. But why the,” he paused, bobbed his head at the infantry. “Why the Johnny on the Job?”
“Going home injured isn’t much better,” John said flatly. When it became clear that Gee didn’t have an answer for that, John sighed and ran a hand roughly over his face. “Ok. Ok. Why here?”
“Going to sleep,” he cut off Sherlock’s objection and shimmied out of his fatigues, slinging them over top his shirt.
Sherlock tried to be content with their friendship as it now stood but he longed to reach out and offer comfort. Just a hand on the shoulder. Or a pat on the knee. Knowing such overtures would be pushed away and eager to never make John angry enough to leave and refuse to return, Sherlock stayed his hand. His memories of John's touch would sustain him.
Nick set his tray down at the head of the table. “Are we talking about Rocket’s mum again? Haven’t we done that enough?”
She grinned wolfishly and picked up the needle driver. “Thou shall have more justice than thou desirest.”
“Off?” Bird spared a glance at Gee before following her line of vision and squinting at the smattering of people.
John caught his shoulder before he tipped over the edge. “Yeah, the tall, dark, and mysterious act wore off on me ages ago.” He softened the admonishment with a smile. “You still haven’t answered me.”
“Really? I heard you had an MP on base and there was a car bomb.” John smiled benignly. “That must have been a worse situation.”
The table went quiet as John’s face settled in an expression of disgruntled scrutiny. Simon squirmed uncomfortably. Towerblock cleared his throat, “Er, another brew, Sir?”
“Mac? Rocket? Flank! Lansley to the front! Corporal House, Corporal Bird! I want you on this side. Slow and with cover! Go!”
Nick noticed the movement and darted out of the Det, making a bee-line for Sherlock. “Holmes?” Gee, not to be left behind, strode after him as purposefully as she could without limping.
Sherlock could picture the scene as John arrived home; shoulders drawn in and slumped, the left just beginning to ache. John would hide his discomfort, would sink onto the sofa (Sherlock could tell that he never slept in his marital bed), brightly coloured cushions and walls and artwork mocking the roiling mass of grief and anger at John's core. John would snort and reach for the bottle of whisky that had somehow moved from the kitchen cupboard to the coffee table. He would pour a reasonable measure into his glass and drink it slowly. Slowly and carefully, mindful of his memories but craving the oblivion. He would drink it slowly until he was no longer drinking slowly. Then it would fall to the floor with a soft clink and a gentle slosh of liquid, the glass slipping from his hand to join it, its contents spilling and seeping into the carpet. John's head would drop to his (right) shoulder, his face losing some of its misery as he dozed quietly. The night would crawl by and eventually a new day would peer around the curtains and wash the man on the sofa in a new wave of self-loathing.
In the ensuing silence, it slowly dawned on Lestrade that the single syllable carried more weight than he’d first noticed. He glanced up. “No, Mycroft-”
Mycroft leaned back in his chair and glanced at Anthea. “Handle it, Philip. He won’t be granted access to these files.”
Nick waved him on and dropped his voice low. “Fifty meters further and you’ll be outstanding in a field.”
“Oh!” She startled anyway and spotted him in Sherlock’s chair. “Mycroft! You gave me a fright. I didn’t hear you come in!”
Mycroft was ever grateful that his mobile opted to buzz at that moment. It was merely his assistant. Strict instructions to which she infallibly adhered: text on the reverse Fibonacci sequence from twenty-one minutes. Ensure escape where necessary.
“Eyes on!” Simon snapped. Bringing his AK to his shoulder and scanning the terrain. “This is when it’s the most dangerous.” Llewellyn followed suit. Mac and Rocket ignored him.
With the third round of shots, Sherlock found himself relieved to be sandwiched between a tense and rather action ready John and the solid wheel of the mastiff. “How many?”
Sherlock glanced across the table pointedly and flipped one of the photos. “Captain Nick Medhurst, Sandhurst, Ammunition Technical Officer. Genuinely respected bomb tech, disrespectful outside of field work.”
Sherlock startled as Towerblock edged up next to his side, two large rifles in tow. He gave Sherlock a stern glare, “Stay here.”
“How could you not?” John shot a glance over his shoulder at Sherlock, who was slowly refocusing his eyes. Still blinking.
He lost track of time and maybe, a little bit lost where he was, and when he finally made it back to the illusion of suburban perfection, it was late enough to be indecent. He tossed his jacket onto one of the horrible chairs, and dropped onto the hideous couch, and used one of the cheery throws as a blanket, settled in for something that was not even a close approximation to sleep.
“And bacon comes from pigs. And wings come from chickens. And mutton is sheep.” Rocket gazed blankly at Mac.
“As I deeply suspect you wouldn’t have told anyone about this lac and I’m now putting the tenth stitch into you in as many days, I’m going to grant you that one.”
“Well that’s quite dull really,” Sherlock frowned. “He breaks up with you, moves on, becomes incensed when you show interest elsewhere, and tries to sabotage a yet undeveloped relationship.”
She shrugged. “I was trying to keep off it, like you asked, but then I found myself disinclined to rest on my laurels while being shot at.”
Sherlock reached a hand around John’s chest to tweak the knot where it sat just loose of perfectly snug against his throat. “Pantone 19-4045 TCX.”
She coughed and nodded, flinching as the cold water ran over her eyes. “Gonna leave some for me to drink?” It came out as a wheeze, but the thought was clear.
“Passionate? You let me yell at you for ten minutes about this without batting an eye. You can’t be worried about the critique.”
“Christ!” Towerblock clutched the rifle to his chest as he started. “Fock’s sake, Watson, there’s a bloody sniper.”
Mycroft sighed and slid his phone free of its confining pocket. “Ah.” He frowned. “I do have to excuse myself.”
“Yeah, well,” John shrugged. “A group of us went there to celebrate. You know, graduate, blow off some steam, sun, tanning, hiking, diving.”
“Good,” John grinned and excused himself from the table, turning sharply to follow Gordon. “So, Gordo... Towerblock?”
Towerblock came in from the equipment room at the back and looked at the toilet with confusion. “What’s that for?”
He sighed and ran a hand over the back of his neck, turning to gaze out at the yard as a fresh cup of coffee was placed in front of him. “Towerblock?”
The second mastiff pulled in through the barriers, drawing up alongside the first; the remainder of Bluestone piled out into the yard just as Loo was off. Gee flinched, shielding her face with a hand as the helo left the ground, tracing their progress until she could no longer see the chopper. John uncrossed his arms and stripped the nitrile gloves from his hands. “Right. Captain, I want you in the med tent now.”
It was a mistake. It was all one, big, laughable, stupid, absurd, terrible, painful mistake. And John stared at the full tumbler of whiskey on the counter, where it sat next to his restlessly drumming fingers. He sucked his entire lower lip between his teeth and huffed a breath heavily from his nose. It had actually been a day. A good day. One of those rare days where everything slotted into place, where he and Sherlock moved like clockwork - seamlessly coordinated and synchronized, where he’d felt useful. He pursed his lips and stilled his hand flat on the worktop, eying the slight bruising on his knuckles. The bastard shouldn’t have run.
what you asked! Portraits. In oil pastel. On canvas. Life sized. With your modern framework addition. What the fuck is your problem?!”
“Medhurst, stop being a dumb twat and put that the fuck out!” Mag Aoidh shouted from across the DFAC.
“Ah,” Smith smiled and stepped past Towerblock. “Major Watson, Mr. Holmes,” he held out a hand to each in turn. Towerblock steeled himself against the backlash he expected as he turned to salute the Major. “Corporal House and I were just discussing your accommodation here at Frost.”
Sherlock didn’t breathe a sigh of relief until John had joined the Bluestone command behind the pair of vehicles. The infantry were still guarding them from any missed or newly arrived hostiles, eyeing the licks of flame as they escaped the buildings.
Sherlock and John were leaning into each other, Sherlock perched on the edge of the sofa, John kneeling in front of him, in between Sherlock's ridiculously long legs. Their eyes were closed, their foreheads pressed together, their arms around each other, hands buried in clothing, gripping tightly to wool coat and thin jacket. They were breathing softly, silently, lost in the closeness of the other. It was simple. Such a simple embrace. And so full of love. And Martha Hudson almost thought herself blinded by the brightness of it all, when she realised she was watching through a veil of tears. She averted her eyes and started back down to her flat. The intimacy of the moment she'd witnessed was too fragile and delicate and so long in coming that she couldn't bring herself to let anything break it. And certainly not herself. To think of them finally together, as it always should have been! Allowing herself a tiny squeak of joy Martha stepped through her door and closed it.
“Yes and ‘intelligence’ is in the WISWO job description, yet they let you soldier on anyway,” Nick snapped back.
“There’s no girl in the picture.” John started rambling. “We broke up last term. I thought he was ok with it. It was mutual. He started the conversation in the first place. He’s even seeing someone else.”
“It’s normal to be shaken. This is fine. We’re fine,” he dropped a hand onto the back of Sherlock’s head.
He stood quickly and took a step back, drawing himself up to his full height and fixing his best look of cold indifference to his face. "It's the ex-boyfriend. Made a few dodgy friends down the pub on the corner. Known to be a dive where one can find white supremacist types. Britain First, EDL, that sort. The ex wanted some revenge, frighten his former girlfriend, who, by the way, is as they say 'way out of his league', the racists were only too happy to help. Although quite how a reserved but happy woman born in London to second generation parents of Indian descent represents a radical Islamist threat to British society is a mystery not even I can solve."
“Aside from possibly explaining,” Sherlock waved a hand in the direction of their project. “That. There is no gain. I’ve no intention of outing you, so to speak.”
He let out an irritated huff to cover a bitten off groan as he straightened. “I’m pretty sure, in spite of the reaming I received from a small, irate medic insisting it’s a graze and not a proper war wound, that yes: I have been shot. The cleaning and suturing of which was not quite the agony I’d intended for my afternoon. I am also, I can only assume, late for a proper bollocking from the Lieutenant Colonel.”
“Of course you do,” Sherlock huffed. “Though you do a remarkable job hiding it. I did always wonder why you dressed in black and grey. I merely assumed you were making a statement. Stupid. It’s always something.”
“Get offa me, or you will regret it!” One of them shook his arm free of the other’s grip and stomped towards the DFAC.
He’d already muddled up the results of the hair follicle portion of the study, by not keeping his focus limited to the hair on one part of John’s body, and then he’d gone and added his tongue to yet another body part, which happened to have
“I see. So you were concerned that I was downgrading the nature of our relationship, and then I stopped our impromptu, albeit unsafe, makeout session, and, yeah, this makes more sense now. Come here.”
John smirked, but came closer, and kissed Sherlock, soft and quiet. Sherlock hummed and kissed a bit harder, then sat back and put his hand over John’s, which had started jabbing the point of the pencil into his notepad.
Sherlock ran his fingers over his chest and felt his nipples go hard. He had a flashback of John’s tongue licking at them, and the shorts immediately got tighter. Oh, God. He needed to get to the bed and lie down before he was unable to walk at all, or before the shorts ripped right off his body. No doubt John was wondering what was taking him so long.
“Of course we can,” he heard John say with lots and lots of affection in his voice. “I am sorry for lashing out. I was just …”
. It’s a proper ice cave. Second of all, we left it there because the star was an interesting oddity on its own, but out of context, nothing more. Now, in light of
Sherlock grabbed John’s shoulders and looked down between them. The sensation of John’s hand on him was one thing, and the sight of that hand on him was another thing, but those two inputs combined were an altogether exponential experience. John dragged his hand up, stroked it down, too slow to do anything but drive Sherlock around the bend.
“Well, bless her for that, then. Hard to imagine you were not always with this one, though, eh?” She nods her head toward Sherlock, who is holding his head high, as if proud to have won this ultimate prize, this Doctor John Hamish Watson.
“I like … I like your chest, John.” Sherlock glanced up at John as he said it, caught John’s eye, and looked down again.
He also wondered, though, if it was John’s ‘feverish distance’ that helped lower the tension a little bit. It’s hard to have an argument with someone who doesn’t seem to be aware of anything going on around him.
He blinked those images away, and looked up. The cloud was gone. He spread his arms out, ready for flight.
“Yes. But thank you. This has been an exceptional evening. I’ve enjoyed it very much. Especially the kissing. But I think it’s enough for now.”
As if reading his mind, Mycroft tilts his head toward Sherlock, and says, “An emperor assumes tremendous responsibility when they become the leader of their colony. Ultimately, there is no action, no decision of significance, that does not start, or end, with that individual. He would rather know immediately; of this one fact, I am certain.”
Sherlock did manage to make it up the stairs, despite the ache in his balls and his cock trying to escape his jeans. He made it to his bedroom, and took everything off. A quick sniff told him he really, really needed to take a shower, and then he panicked that he hadn’t cleaned himself, like he had yesterday, but they had condoms, so if John wanted –
Sherlock pushed forward. “I hope you don’t mind, but I called my friend, Greg, in case we needed help. He’s an expert in this type of situation. If that guy had even entered the building, I’d want Greg here. Well, fortunately, it didn’t come to that.”
Sherlock had been looking out his window when John said it, taking in the lights of Michigan Avenue as they headed north over the Chicago River. He blinked several times and swallowed down the unexpected lump in his throat, then reached across the seat for John’s hand, and squeezed it. He hoped John knew that his lack of vocal acknowledgment of John’s statement was due to emotion, not a lack of agreement. If Sherlock was lucky enough to have that kind of life with John, fifteen years from now, or thirty years from now, or fifty years from now, he’d consider his entire life an overwhelming success.
In the afternoons the group dives and hunts for lunch, and then they break apart to meet as apprentice and teacher, or in John's case, apprentices and teacher.
When John reached the door he turned back, one hand on the doorknob, and took a good look at Sherlock, sprawled loose on top of the bed, candle light flickering over his flushed chest, his swollen lips, his soft, white cock nestled in its black, curly nest of hair.
“I disagree Johnling. I think this is exceedingly good.” He kisses John's cheek and nips his shoulder, and John sighs so deeply Sherlock can feel it in his own belly pouch.
“Theirs is not an unusual tale, to be clear. There have always been same-peng pairings in emperor culture, and, in fact, all penguin species, if not all animalkind. What has changed, unfortunately, is the way in which societies respond to those couplings. If I could explain why thoughts on love have drifted back and forth over time, we would probably not be here now, having this discussion.
"Nah. There's more stuff I learned that I didn't get to say. The Council needs a quorum to proceed, for example. That means," he says, seeing some confused expressions, "that there must be a previously agreed upon majority of Council members in place before any vote can be taken. Our quorum is set at five out of seven Councilpengs."
John scraped together the last of his dignity. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have assumed anything. I should have talked to you about this, first. Probably years ago.”
“No. I mean, he and I check in once in a while, but I guess we haven’t really talked in much depth since the investigation and hearings around the Arranged Marriage Program.”
Anchored by John’s arms and thighs, Sherlock buried his face in John’s neck and licked and sucked on the salty skin there. He felt one of John’s hands slide up the nape of his neck, felt his fingers tangle in his hair, felt them pull. He heard John’s frantic, “Yes, yes, yes,” heard his own whispered response, “John, John, John.”
“I know! So now the state requires that the schools step in and take on some of those responsibilities. I know it’s a little controversial to some parents who think that certain topics should only be taught at home, but if a parent isn’t going to teach a young girl how she gets pregnant, someone needs to, don’t you agree?”
Tea and chit chat dispensed with, Sherlock flipped through the folders again, held one out towards James, and said, “Here. This one. Call this one.”
Think TeenLick™, American High School Football, and Making Out in Cars. FWIW, I grew up in a community like this, and had the most amazing make-out sessions in cars, overlooking the city lights.
I slowly make my way to the front rows of what is left of the cabin. It takes forever. I do not help the young man pleading for help, nor the woman who tries to unfasten her seat belt. There is pain every time I need to reach for one of the headrest to stabilize myself but I cannot make a connection to where I got hurt. Am I in some state of shock?
They sat together in silence for a while until another therapist told them it was time for another terribly humiliating exercise inflicted on Sherlock. This time, the name of the game was “Sitting up”. It included Sherlock having to flex all his damaged muscles and to use his almost useless arms to stabilize himself. It caused so much pain he almost vomited but did not move his body even close to an upright position.
More voices, unknown. Soft pressure on my (left?) hand. John? Hear his voice (sure it is him now), cannot make out words. Want to tell him I am awake. Try to squeeze his hand, but cannot move. Too tired. Eyes won't open. Asleep again.
John tried not to think of Sherlock licking whisky off his lips when he retired to his bedroom later that night.
John smiles and leans toward Sherlock, holds his chin in one hand, and says, “I keep telling you, love, I wasn't going anywhere. Not without you.”
“Let’s not move, all right? I don’t know about you, but I have a spectacular view, and I’m pretty sure I could live off the memories of you riding my face for a very long time.”
Imi studies John for a moment, her mouth twisted and her eyebrows scrunched, then she runs back up the stairs, yelling, “I've got just the thing!” She's back in less than a minute, her hands held behind her back, her whole body giggling with delight.
Many Peng-thanks to KarlyAnne for uploading chapter six for me, and for all her efforts to keep me sane, fix my mistakes, straighten out my various confusions, and cheerlead the hell out of this fic.
Relief washed over John’s face as he gave Sherlock’s cock one last kiss and climbed up to lay beside him. “Like this, then, okay?” he said as he turned on his side, reached down, and enclosed Sherlock in his hand. He set a slow pace to start, and Sherlock rolled to face him, tangling their legs, seeking John’s mouth with his own.
“I would’ve noticed if it’d been windy enough to shake a car,” James answered. “What he’s saying is there was somebody else in the car, somebody moving about.”
Sherlock recalls his first conversations with Erebus during that inaugural summer journey. He had told Sherlock about his relationship with Selvic, their parents’ reactions and interference, and the heartbreak of their six winters apart. Erebus had helped Sherlock understand that everyone mightn’t accept his love for John with open wings, and had helped him take action that would not only reflect his love, but prove the justness of it.
Sherlock hums in acknowledgment, but he’s not paying nearly as much attention to Janine as he is to Erebel. As soon as Janine announces Pono’s death and Kororā’s horrific response, Erebel breaks free from her friends and scurries back to her fathers. She throws herself against Sherlock and plasters her cheek to his belly. He bends low and hears her mumble into his feathers, "This is an awful, awful story, Pāpā!"
Sherlock needed to touch it. His hand hovered in the space above John for several seconds, his fingers trembling, before it drifted down, down, down. On first contact, with just the lightest touch of his index finger, John’s cock jerked and slapped against his belly.
Sherlock took a deep breath and picked up the scone again. No need to get ahead of himself. He didn’t even know if a proposal would be forthcoming.
“We are. Come on, let’s go explore. This place takes up eight storefronts, has six rooms, a rooftop deck, and an outdoor patio.”
I wrote this in a fevered, achy, exhausted, snotty haze. That there weren't as many errors as words is a mystery to me.
“I feel … finished. And I would very much like to see my Selvic, again. But the timing of my departure is not for me to determine, so you may very well get your wish, my young friend.”
“It hasn’t been until this trip, and our experiences at Sidetrack and at Kevin’s party, that I’ve come to realize how little I know. This whole … scene … is unlike anything I would have imagined, mostly because it’s nothing I ever would have imagined for myself.
Sherlock realizes that he has never even considered what Mycroft’s shell may have said about him, his future, his path. He shakes his head.
. John, I love you so much.” A warm, tingly sensation was suffusing him, a flush radiating from his heart through every bit of him, and it only got stronger as he snuggled John harder. “You pounded me through the mattress and it was incredible.”
"Johhhn." He drags his hand up John's thigh, up up up, under the t-shirt he's wearing, which Sherlock realizes is his, too big for John, long, worn thin. Sexy. Not fair. Not fair at all.
“Jesus, that’s a relief. I was beginning to regret I ever met the two of you.” Greg lifted his glass as he said it, and they all toasted to John and Sherlock's lack of imprisonment, and Greg’s continued employment.
“Look at you, look at how much you love this, holding your ass open for me, begging for it. God, I love it, too. I love your precious hole, the way it begs to be kissed. Oh, I'll kiss it all right.” And he did, he licked and kissed and rubbed with his lips until Sherlock felt numb with need, abandoned on some plateau of singular sensation, all the nerve endings of his hole throbbing and singing and screaming.
He opened the door and peered around the doorframe. John was already sitting on the side of the bed in a pair of track pants, the bottle of Champagne in his hands, his tongue peeking out between his lips.
“Hey Ma, it’s me. Yeah, I got it. Yes, I did. No, not really. Because I wasn’t there for a chat, I was there to return her scarf.
Mycroft relaxes his shoulder and extends a wing toward Sherlock, pauses, and then puts it on his little brother’s shoulder.
I have observed John Watson’s hands on many occasions and thought I was aware of their many capabilities but he is so full of surprises is my John Watson JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH his hand is on my penis or should I say erection pull it together Holmes don’t lose the plot now HE IS STROKING MY ERECTION HIS HANDS ARE OF GOD
As much as Sherlock relishes their stories, and is grateful for their company, they remind him of himself and John, and he misses his
Beyond their cocoon, beyond the tree, beyond the windows of the small sunroom, the snow had stopped falling and the sky had cleared of clouds. A few bright stars created a halo around John and Sherlock’s first Christmas tree, blinking down at them from high, and Sherlock smiled, held John tight, and was thankful.
“Okay. Greg, about last night. I didn’t know he was your ex-boyfriend. If I’d known, well, actually I still would’ve knocked his lights out, but, yeah. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock escorts Erebus back to the huddle, making certain he is tucked in tight at the center. He finds Pavo and asks her to keep a close eye on their friend. Pavo nods, but says there is little she can do now, but make sure the emperor stays warm and comfortable.
John barks a laugh from the kitchen, and Sherlock smiles at Imi and gives her hand another squeeze. Imi squeezes back before climbing down out of her chair and carrying her plate into the kitchen. She comes back with a handful of chocolate biscuits, two of which she sneaks to Sherlock, then picks up a blanket that she had discarded under the table before dinner.
"Then what?" Sherlock is curious now, so curious. He brings his fingers down down down to tease under the waist of John's pyjama bottoms.
I didn't grow up in the Midwest, but I did grow up in a place where vintage pickup trucks are driven both as work vehicles, and as an act of love. I drove a pickup for about four years, but found it impractical once I moved to a place with lots of snow.
John raised his eyebrows and tilted his head toward James. “Apparently, he’s moving in with Annette. The two of them discussed it this morning.”
Sherlock felt John lower his underpants to his upper thighs, and then the wet tip of his tongue on the crown of his cock. “Oh!” His eyes flew open and he looked down to see John staring up at him from under his lashes as he stuffed his mouth with Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock slammed his eyes shut and John bobbed up and down and then abruptly stopped, keeping Sherlock in his mouth. John tapped Sherlock’s hip until he started talking again.
John lowered himself down on top of Sherlock and buried his face in Sherlock's neck. “Fuck me, please, fuck me, Sherlock.”
Greg chewed thoughtfully, then crossed his arms over his chest and looked up at the ceiling. “Hmm. I guess I like putting things to order. It’s not so much that I like the process of solving a problem, but I like the satisfaction that comes with knowing it’s fixed.”
Obviously (says Sherlock), pengs don't tell time the way we do. There is no 9:08pm, no "five more minutes," no calendar year. I've been using "x number of winters" and solar cycles to describe years, and the number of full moons for months. But what to do about minutes?
In the morning Sherlock woke to the light of early morning, the weight of John’s arm over his stomach, and the clatter of Mrs. Hudson in the kitchen. He took a look around this new bedroom of his, of his and John’s, and made a vow to himself, then and there, to make sure that this would always be a haven for them. They would not talk about John’s mother here. They would not have arguments here. They would not watch movies, or do homework, or surf the internet here. Books, he decided, would be all right. They could read here, and sleep here, and make love here. They would keep this place sacrosanct, because it was the only place they would have, at home, or anywhere, for a long time, to be exactly who they were together.
“Oh, so much worse. Victor went home and told his mother what I’d said and she told his father. His father committed suicide in the mistress’ flat. She found him hanging.”
Sherlock leaned closer to his husband and, eyes on John, opened his mouth wide. John guided the bread between Sherlock’s lips and let the tip of it rest on his tongue. Sherlock bit down and chewed, feeling the textures of the moist bread and creamy butter mix on his tongue. It was sweet and tangy and he was still staring at John as he hummed in appreciation and swallowed.
“There are pengs among us, even today,” he confides, “who claim allegiance to Apo’s beliefs. They call themselves Apologists, and they are not to be trusted.”
“Maybe instead of giving you my shoulder to cry on, I should be giving you flirting tips. Christ, Molly, that boy was making eyes at you and you didn’t even notice!” John chided her as she turned back to the Chemex and John began work on a lavender-vanilla latte.
John peeks around the corner and smiles, seconding Sherlock's compliments. “Gorgeous, little Miss Imi, just stunning. What's the occasion?”
While they wait, Mycroft and Erebus take turns examining the tooth. Neither seem over the shock of Sherlock and John’s announcement, and are treating the tooth as if it might break, or yell at them, or transport them somewhere. Mycroft had been very angry when he realized Sherlock hadn’t come to him the moment he found it, but Erebus had been Erebus, always constant, and had hugged both him and John, and told them how extraordinary they were.
“Oh, right. Well, that happened when I was still interested in the effects of hair follicle stimulation, but I became distracted by the actual hair, and then not just your hair, but my hair on you. See, scientific experimentation should really never be a spontaneous, impulsive endeavor. There are too many potential tangents, too many ways to be sidetracked.”
For the blink of an eye John looks hurt, confused. Then he’s John again, giving Sherlock a curt nod of his head. “Show us.”
This must have been the moment just before they jumped, he thought, because their bodies were taut, their eyes wide, their mouths sealed shut into tight lines between puffy cheeks, full of air to sustain them through their splash into the water below.
“Stand still. Don’t move.” Sherlock aligns himself with John, belly-to-belly, then bends down, and slowly, with the grace and finesse of millions of pengs before him, nudges that perfect peng egg off of his feet, and onto John’s. When he has tucked it up as far as he can, and run his bill over it once more, he stands up and wraps his wings around John, his beautiful Johnling, who is crying again, trying so hard to hold it together, because he’s holding their egg on his feet.
There was little in the questions or answers that Sherlock couldn’t have figured out himself, but watching John Watson’s body language gave him so much more than any of Mummy’s inquiries could have.
Sherlock understands. He will miss Mycroft, too. It is not something he would have predicted when they took that first dive off Cassiopeia several moons ago. He takes a step closer to his older brother.
“Mmm, your coffee is divine, too. Well, like I said, the parents talk and the children talk and next thing I know I’m hearing rumors about Pastor having a male lover in Madison, but we both know that no one would be
“Your face. The patterns of flush over your skin, the complete lack of tension around your eyes, the relaxed shape of your mouth.”
John twirled his glass in a small circle near his ear, and shrugged. “We’ve been together for a long time now, yeah? No reason for that to change. We’re, you know, good. Together.”
And so he does. They take their time walking back to the colony, and Sherlock tells Mycroft everything that has transpired since they last set eyes on each other, since they ended their shared journey, before Sherlock took his leave with Anahera and Tui.
Sherlock smiled, and giggled, and John kissed his ear and said, “Now get off me. You're heavier than you look.”
Sherlock looks at Mycroft and widens his eyes, tilts his head, tweaks his bill fractionally to the right. Mycroft narrows his eyes, wrinkles his forehead, twitches his bill to the left. Sherlock stares. Mycroft blinks. Sherlock stares. Mycroft sighs.
