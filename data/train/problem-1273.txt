Once in Paris, Mamie sent them on a tour, they’d take care of Rosie so John would have a chance to properly visit Paris. The Eiffel tower, the Louvre, the Seine and many other places; had John fascinated, but as fascinated as he was watching Sherlock move around like he owned the city, taking shortcuts here and there, going to places where no one else could go; Sherlock speaking in French was another thing, each word made John’s spine tingle…
“Sherlock” He recognised the voice immediately, but the chill never ran down his spine. Sherlock was leaving his home; packed bags next to him, his phone in his hand, waiting for Mycroft’s minion to pick him up. He turned and there he was, the boy that had broken his heart. He looked good, but he had lost something. Sherlock scanned him and noticed he was tired, that he had a strange look in his eyes and the ring on his ring finger, either married or soon to be. Sherlock expected the rush of pain and anger but all he could see was John’s face in front of him and that tongue travelling over his lips.
The ceremony was short, Rosie was the flower girl; Molly and Greg were their witnesses, Mrs. Hudson and Angelo were there as their parents, Harry was back with Clara and in rehab for the last seven months, James and Mike congratulated them. Mike hugged John, James hugged Sherlock and the little event was soon over
When John finally sobered up and finally fell asleep, Mary went to look for James to tell him about what had happened during John’s visit; saying she received the cold shoulder is an understatement, but she tried with all she had, to the point she shouted to James that he was a coward and that he never deserved John. James closed the window to his room, called the police and Mary was “gently” asked to leave by a young constable wanting to become a sergeant, Gregory Lestrade. He took her home and Mary cried the entire way, blaming herself for James breaking up with John.
The night prior, John had called them and they agreed to come for lunch at their flat. They started the day by asking Mrs. Hudson to help them with Rosie while they went shopping for lunch with the Watsons. Sherlock was nervous and he tried all he could to distract himself, from doing a half an hour research on brands of salt to a full on strop in front of the beef and chicken. John managed to get all they needed in the meantime but had to go back and find his lovely genius having a break down in front of the ice creams.
The scene flashed briefly in front of him. This wasn’t the time for that, but he was glad that Eurus, just as much as Mycroft had fallen for it, him having sex with Irene. “Preposterous” he’d said to John when he’d asked.
Heard of Oedipus? Well... writers tell it quite like it was, except... except he was in love with his father... unfortunately? Us souls are meant to be together, even if we're son and father, even if belief systems, or matters of religious faith, condemn us to "eternal fires and rage," The Borgias ring a bell? It wasn't exactly his sister...
I give what you probably been waiting for the last 30 chapters, some fluff! LOL, not too smutty but here goes nothing...
“Hello beautiful” his mother picked Rosie from Sherlock’s arms and coddled her, the baby gurgled and Sherlock reached for her again, Violet obliging her son and handing the baby back “And where is your friend?” His mother asked with that know-it-all tone of voice only she had.
Six degrees of separation, every person in everyone’s life is separated from someone else’s in someone’s life by six degrees of separation. John and Sherlock were the “friend of a friend”, separated exactly by those six degrees of separation. Molly was that friend that had a friend that was the friend of a friend, Molly was Mary’s friend at school, they finished sixth form together and she went to study medicine with John at Queen Mary University of London. Yes, John was two years older than her, so when Molly started studying and by the day of the wedding, it was her first year.
. He had to check for some other poor bastard that at the end of the show tried to invite him to a drink “Or something… ya’know?”
John stared at the screen of his phone trying to rack his brains to figure why Sherlock had photos of Rosie. The last one, of the baby on his chest, eyes closed and absolutely relaxed did it for John and he wanted to leave his lecture as soon as it was possible. As soon as he arrived to his lecture, John tried to call Molly but her phone was off, he even tried Greg but he wasn’t answering either, desperate, he called his mother and tried not to worry her and surreptitiously try to find something about his daughter when the first message of the day came. It was a photo of Rosie with an elder lady; the foot of the photo said “My Mum and Rosie. She’s fine, Molly just left her”
“Water, please” Julia Watson muttered as she held her husband’s hand, trying to bring him out of his astonishment.
Hey all! Sorry for not updating all I have, but I've been a bit busy. I'll post all I can this afternoon before I have to leave for work again., Thanks for reading and happy Sherlock!
“This is Sherlock Holmes, not taking cases at the moment, don’t leave a dull message” he had only the beep to find the courage to say what he had to say, another deep breath and the force of what he was about to say hit him like a ton of bricks and left him aching all over
"Actually..." I push him softly, so he's sitting facing me on the sofa, he looks back at me, "I put the money back in your pouch; you were asleep for a few moments, your back to me. I wanted so much to see your face. I wanted you to see mine... but... his rules... I could see the ones that paid top money, so I would be... familiar."
I work 21 days a month and have only 7 to rest... Sorry for not updating as much as I should but I'm writing in my free time and publishing as soon as I get home. My work is away from home and have little communication with the world outside. Thanks for sticking with me. Love you all and happy Sherlock!
“Okay” Violet grinned “I’ll teach how to change a nappy, how to taste the milk and then you’re on your own. Let the baby guide you” She had a mischievous look. Sherlock paled the moment his mother said she’ll be leaving after teaching him whatever he is supposed to learn and absentmindedly ended telling his mother all about John Watson and how they’d met “He seems like a good enough man to me” She said seriously and Sherlock just looked at her as if she had grown another head.
“I’m going to Belgravia” Sherlock pointed behind him “You’re going to Barbican” He shifted on his feet “I’ll take the next one” He attempted a smile but failed. He was waiting for John’s answer when he saw the inconspicuous black car approaching the kerb and tried not to scowl.
You could hear it roaring if you pay close attention. It warms them, their joined hands, their feet that touch every now and then... They rest... timelessly.
Mycroft followed them closely; he had time to get to know little Rosie and grow attached to her; John was unique and Mycroft could see his brother becoming a good man, he knew it was John’s doing, the way he doted on his brother was fantastic, exactly what Sherlock needed. One thing nagged him, though, the lack of physical… activities… between them. Anthea handed him a full report on their non-existent sexual life; he was willing to humiliate himself and find about what was happened between them, but his questions were answered a few days after his impromptu visit and the image he couldn’t shake from his memory, though he also had it well-hidden on his mobile.
Mycroft texted him several times, but Sherlock just answered when it was required and necessary. He hated the way Mycroft worried about him, but he understood why he was that way. After Victor, Mycroft had turned feral, even threatening to kill the young man. Eurus had stopped him and made him understand that somehow, Sherlock needed to learn through heart break. Mummy and Eurus called him, Eurus knew all about John and Sherlock was glad he could talk to her. Eurus had chosen going to Cambridge instead of Oxford and they were too far away, but they managed to communicate every day vial e-mail, texts and calls.
“There’s an invitation on your bedside table. It has an HW on it and also several wine stains on the side from different days. You didn’t stain it because you don’t drink, but your brother does and it’s straining his relationship with his wife, your mother is probably worried that she’ll ask for divorce” Sherlock looked at the side and John picked his nephew’s christening invitation.
Mycroft was always worried about Sherlock’s condition. Victor breaking up with him proved to be dangerous; he started smoking like a chimney and Mycroft was sure he will soon turn to something more pernicious to his health, if given the slightest chance. He had to have him followed 24//7.
… something akin of a shy smile over those plump cupid bow lips and a definite blush adorning the otherwise pale cheekbones, chiselled on white marble skin. The boy was heavenly
They walked to Baker Street, John didn’t even notice, so enthralled in Sherlock that when they reached Baker Street he looked at the door and was surprised to see the black door in front of him. A lady came out to receive them, slightly older than his mother, maybe over fifty, but with a beautiful smile directed at Sherlock.
. John remembered the first night they had shared a bed and he realised that never, not even when he was lost for James he felt so warm, secure and at home as he felt next to Sherlock.
“More to the point then… We made a mistake by getting together… I made a mistake by inviting you to my life…”He looked down, unable to meet John’s eyes
Siger cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck “He’s different. He talked about you as if he had met you, his relationship with his siblings improved greatly and ever since you left Rosie with us he has called every single day” The man smiled down at John and John could feel the tips of his ears burning with embarrassment “He says it’s because of Rosie…” Siger shook his head.
“No lectures for the next five Saturdays!” John flicked his tongue at Sherlock and lifted his arms over his head in celebration.
We soulmates guide each other, help each other overcome in times of need, stay calm in times of sorrow...
He admitted to the affair to Mary’s ghost, the ghost of his past, right in front of Sherlock, the ghost of his present, before either one of them could become the ghost of his future… He was heartbroken, but Sherlock had mended him. They had talked long and hard and in the end, everything fit where it had to fit and they were together, finally!
Eurus smirked and looked at him intently, Sherlock felt scrutinized, dissected… ‘John must have felt the same way when I deduced him’ he thought and tried to keep calm, his hand was trembling, not knowing if he was afraid of his sister finding out about his sex life, or by the fact that he had a sex life now, he closed his eyes for the briefest of moments to gather his thoughts back
Another fact. When souls are meant to meet, they simply do, but only when is meant to be, not when they want to...
Their last day in Orleans, the Holmes women made John feel like one of them. Mummy even asked them how long had they been together and Sherlock had scowled at her and shook his head. Thanks to Mamie, as she had asked John to call her, they salvaged the situation by saying they were “getting to know each other”. John thanked her with all his heart, looking at the most beautiful man blush and look away.
While John was in his lectures, Molly went to visit Sherlock carrying little Rosie. As soon as he saw the baby he felt a rush of panic and wanted to reach for her, barely managing to contain his worry and school his features. “John’s at school” Molly said as greeting; she was one of the few people that could read Sherlock almost to perfection “Babysitting duty for the day” She smiled down at the little baby “You said you wanted coffee so, here I am” She looked up with a bright smile.
Tying a scarf around your neck when it's cold, handing you a pair of gloves while in a case, because you forgot yours, once again, for the thrill of the chase.
“Thanks” John said to Angelo’s back. “Okay” John said as soon as they ordered “Something to tell me?” He smiled in just that reassuring way Sherlock loves so much.
“Yes” Sherlock shook his head. “No” He nodded and tried to gather his thoughts. “Victor” He swallowed hard and tried to compose himself, his brain was short-circuiting. “Victor” he tried again and realised he had his hand on John’s hand. “My friend Victor” He memorised the feeling of the manly hand in his. “He always comes to get me after the show is over” He blushed as he felt John’s thumb stroking his knuckles.
John beamed at the news but held it as much as he could “So you solved the case” It wasn’t a question
Finally, Sherlock was able to reconnect his brain to his mouth and clear his throat “She’s barely seven months old” He said, baffled “Early talker” He looked at the little miracle in his arms once more.
John was summoned by Greg to the Starbucks on Broadway at 4pm. The young sergeant, who was now around 23 years old, had become John’s friend out of sympathy at first, and then out of pure interest and concern. They’ve talked several times, Greg even offering to take care of Rosie; that’s how, during one of Greg’s babysitting shifts, he met Molly and he fell for the young student; that’s how he found out all about Sherlock asking for John every chance he got -meaning every day, at least twice a day- and that’s how he devised a plan, considering John asked for Sherlock every time he met with Greg.
“Yes” Sherlock nodded and kept his eyes on the people walking outside the window, his mind providing information relentlessly “She said I could have the flat” He mumbled.
John eyed him suspiciously but answered anyway “Mary asked me to keep her” John shrugged “A week before the weeding we talked about what to do in case one of us could no longer be in Rosie’s life; I am her legal father, but in case her real father appeared there might be some… issues; so Mary decided to leave Rosie to me, as her legal guardian; we signed adoption papers the second she was born, just in case, we wanted to cover all the bases”
Sherlock went to him and put his arms around the both of them. Rosie launched herself at Sherlock and snuggled close to his chest as soon as he grabbed her “I missed you too” He muttered, he gave John a quick and soft kiss before holding his hand and walking out of the station. John held to Sherlock’s hand like a lifeline and leaned close to his boyfriend, feeling comforted and calm as soon as he felt his warm hand in his.
After almost ten years in the army, Marcus is to retire, but he still has a battle in him, so off he goes, the faithful seventh following Caesar to Africa. In the meantime, year 46 B.C. sees Titus teaching, one of the most sought philosophy teachers in Athens, but his father's death brings him to Rome, as he is to take his seat at the senate.
At first, the souls were together all the time, joined in love and understanding. Shapeless, Sexless. Faithful to one another. They moved together for millions of years, watching the world turn, move, change, be... And they simply were...
"Because we had just misses each other" I reply quietly; he sighs again so I decide to tell the story. "My first ever memory of being near you..." I look up and stare at the ceiling for long seconds, reach for my tea with measured movements, as if I were in my Mind Palace, wandering; he believes me, my sweet John, I'm afraid of him finding out why all this happened to us.
“I’m completely aware of that” Sherlock pursed his lips and the cutest pout appeared over his lips, John shook his head and simply smiled “I know I’m in no position of demanding all your free time for me” Sherlock continued, interrupting John and whatever he might have wanted to say” I know you have your studies, your team, you have Rosie, but so far we have managed” He gave a shy smile “I know an internet relationship is not ideal, but I’m willing to give it a try” Sherlock played with John’s fingers as he waited for an answer.
“As long as Sherlock needs to… I’m not doing what that fucker did” He huffed angrily “He was his friend when they were young, since they were five, he was supposed to be in love with Sherlock, but he made a bet with some idiots and started a relationship with Sherlock just to fuck him over and then dump him…” John could barely breathe, his anger rising “I’m not risking our relationship because my balls are blue” That made Bill and Mike laugh out loud “Besides, when it happens, I’m not telling you, those days are over” He grinned wickedly.
He managed to create a few relationships along the way; Sebastian Wilkes was a dick but an important asset because he surrounded himself with people with the means to procure information. Irene was a great asset too, and he could call her “friend” She’d been there when Victor broke it off and was a constant company to keep him distracted. She was also to thank for not allowing him to indulge in unsavoury situations such as cocaine use and certain abuse. Her girlfriend, Kate was to be considered a friend too. Her sweet demeanour always managed to get the best of Irene, even though she could be as wicked as the devil.
“She seems nice” John smiled shyly, breaking the slight tension. Sherlock laughed hard and looked at John, shaking his head and rolling his eyes “You have me” John sighed and they looked at each other for a while. If they had been together, they’d be kissing by now.
The same conversation happened over the next two weeks. John was certain that he not only liked Sherlock Holmes but that he was inevitably and utterly falling deeply in love with Sherlock. They had become friends over the past couple of weeks; they flirted back and forth but never talked about feelings. Sherlock complained about boredom, told John about his experiments, talked about his family, university and the lack of a decent murder in the area.
“Alors? Mamie looked the same way and her eyes locked in Rosie for a brief moment before turning to Sherlock again.
… John’s hand was soft; his fingers short, but worked him open lovingly, almost worshiping his body. When Sherlock was ready, John looked at him again, wanting confirmation. A slight nod was enough, Sherlock took a deep breath and John’s thickness breached him slowly, filling him up with a desire he hadn’t know he had in him…
The messages kept coming and John managed to answer a couple, one of them asking about Molly, Sherlock simply answered that he shouldn’t worry and sent another photo of Rosie drinking from her bottle. John was amazed at how at piece his daughter looked and he couldn’t wait to be there with them.
Maybe you've already guessed our punishment. No? We fell on a loop of endless repetition, closer and closer to meet, but never being able.
“Oh! Have you had sex?” Eurus surprised him but he tried not to show it. Not even Mycroft had noticed that change in him the day of the explosion.
He arrived to Oxford 4 a quarter past six and the first thing he saw as he climbed out of the train was Sherlock’s bright smile. He couldn’t believe it had only been a week since they last saw each other; he had missed him so much!
They took the phone out, stared at the other’s number and sighed, deeply, putting the phone away and closing their eyes.
“You don’t seem very afraid” Mycroft tried to loom over him, using his height and weight against him.
We all know how Pompeii went, right? No need to recall it. Suffice to say they didn't make it, but something changed the minute Claudius didn't take his own life and Flavius didn't die in combat. Sometimes, more often than not, souls like to die together.
“If you don’t jump…” Bill shook his head “You’ll have a place here, always… well…” Bill rubbed the back of his neck “As long as we’re in University” He chuckled.
At some point, the always concerned Mycroft made his appearance at their flat, only to find the most heart-warming image one could ever imagine; the three of them sleeping on the sofa, Sherlock holding John close to his chest, his head on John’s head, his arm holding him tight. John slept soundly, snuggled at Sherlock’s chest, his nose in the crook of his neck, one hand resting protectively over his stomach and the other holding baby Rosie closely. Sherlock’s other arm over Rosie little stomach, they both holding her close, all three fast asleep,
Rome, during the first century B.C. was... convulse. The Roman Republic was agonizing and the new Empire was on the making.
“I do trust you!” John stood in front of Sherlock and the latter took two steps back. “Sherlock” John tried to follow but Sherlock pushed him away with a gesture of his hands.
Sherlock’s mind was lost in the memory, his eyes wandering over it. He forced himself to listen to what his sister was saying while his fingers danced over the violin strings
“Congratulations on the engagement” Sherlock nodded at the ring and with a quick movement opened the door to the car and jumped in, leaving a baffled Victor looking at his hand and then at the moving car. Sherlock wished he could have felt something, even anger, but seeing Victor just reminded him of his childhood, the happy moments they had spent playing pirates, of Redbeard and the kiss which un-luckily -not sure if it was lack of luck or more likely the best of luck-, never really was.
“I see” Julia sniffed and looked away from John’s piercing gaze “Is he…” She waved to the flat; John just nodded “May I?” She bit her lower lip and looked at the door, asking for permission; John shook his head “Why?”
They talked after, long and hard… John had blamed him for everything and Sherlock had accepted the blame, he had accepted everything John had said, every word, every insult, every single disappointed look, everything John decided to throw his way, he had taken
“Busy?” Bill laughed out loud, his whole body moving with his laughter “That’s the worst excuse ever” He shook his head and rolled his eyes.
Tea and cake served, Sherlock gave Mrs. Hudson the latest scoop on her husband’s case. “I just made sure he’s executed” Sherlock said between cake bites “He won’t be bothering you ever again” He gave her a sweet smile and she patted his hand amorously.
“I need pick up” He said to the voice on the other end and in less than ten minutes the ubiquitous black car was there, Anthea opened the door for him, still wearing black for Mycroft… Sherlock realised he was alone, his parents blown up, his brother dead and the love of his life hating him… forever…
“Hi, Mum” he squeezed her tight before releasing her and greeting his father “Dad” he shook his hand “This way” he led them to their door where an anxious Sherlock was holding Rosie and waiting for them “Mum, Dad” John cleared his throat “This is Sherlock” He pointed politely at him “Sherlock, these are my Mum and Dad” he tried and failed to smile.
“WHAT THE HELL?” John shouted as soon as he closed the cab door “EXPLAIN” he looked at Sherlock with murderous eyes
I'd seen it. Was it last year or the last century? Always too late, always at the morgue. Is it "morgue" the correct term? Or not yet? Which century is this one? Blasted memory, remembering everything but which year is it... So many lonely years, only to find him dead once again...
“Got the car?” John asked and walked to the kitchen to grab his favourite mug, he tried to act as nonchalant as possible, he already had an uncomfortable morning, Mike and Bill had teased him relentlessly all night, he went to Tesco to buy a couple of suitcases and get some boxes and while he packed, Bill and Mike teased him about their first night together, about the love nest and other things, including having safe sex “You already have one kid, you don’t want another so soon” and “enjoy the honeymoon phase, in five months you’ll be like an old married couple”, John just rolled his eyes and continued packing.
In our haven, separations used to last milliseconds. We leave our soulmates, or go with them, live for a while, learn, enjoy, become and come back.
Silas is a married man, and tonight, he will fulfil his duty as a husband, God willing, he'll impregnate his wife and he'll keep on being exemplary; but he knows he will do it out of duty, because he only loves the man from the brothel. He came to the realisation this afternoon, when he saw Maria and felt... nothing...
“We’ve been busy” John repeated “Managing Rosie, my shifts at the hospital, his cases, school…” John rested his head on his hand “It’s as if the urge is lacking…” John smiled “I can’t wait to be with him, he actually makes it really hard not to be physical, but he keeps me quite satisfied” John chuckled
The file was accompanied by a full blood work, a letter from the army saying that if he was called he wouldn’t be deployed to any dangerous regions -(under MI6-MH-001-Q-003-007/1 request)- and Sherlock and his daughter would be able to go with him during his deployments, provided that Sherlock would marry him- his school transcripts, from primary school to his last exams taken the day prior. According to the many hours of recording he had been faithful to Sherlock, even before they started a relationship, good friend, good father, good student, good worker; his payments were made every day the same day, on the hour, he worked as much as needed and was serious about his career and his loans; he had decided to move with Sherlock before finding out about the money.
, my action was considered as commendable, at least that's what I read a few years later, when I was five, yet again...
Dinner was ready for Rosie, after pasta they had to give her another bath, considering she had more food in her hair than in her plate at some point; she babbled, giggled, mumbled and wet them both. After bath came sleepy time, John read, Sherlock played and Rosie fell asleep rather quickly. Once she was out, Sherlock took care of the kitchen, John the bathroom before they ate dinner.
When John entered he saw him there, sitting at one of the stools, in front of a microscope, his riotous curls falling everywhere around his lovely face, a frown on his brow and that look that said to John he was “busy now, John” and John just stood there, watching him, the way he moved his hands, those beautiful hands that had been all over him last night, John shivered at the memory; his unfathomable eyes rapidly searching for whatever was under the microscope lenses, his pursed lips, beautiful pursed lips that had kissed him… oh how had they kissed him… and then a bit of tongue rushing over his plush lower lip… oh the tongue, swirling, licking… oh dear god! John took a deep breath that made Sherlock look up, his eyes locked with John’s and they simply started at each other, Sherlock’s smile could illuminate the world and John somehow knew that there was no better time than the present.
“You miss him” Mamie caressed his check and ruffled his hair softly before kissing his forehead. Sherlock nodded and hid his face behind his hands “Have you talked to him?” Sherlock shook his head “You had plans?” Sherlock nodded once more “How long have you been together?”
He went to class that morning, after leaving Rosie with his mum and run, as usual, with Molly and Mike. Mike was a fellow student that had become a good friend to John in a very short time after they shared the same seats during the two months Fundamentals. Mike was one of the many people that offered to help John, moving with him after a moth after they met and finding another tenant, a nursery student, Bill Murray.
The case was easy, in the Sherlockian scale of cases it was a five, and all they had to do was check facts. Greg, already used to the rapid-fire deductions Sherlock made, had his team assembled in such a way that every single one of them knew when to step away; that is, except green Sally Donovan and the new Forensic specialist, Philip Anderson.
“One of the nurses got careless. I liked it. Messy, though. People are so breakable…” The word hit him like a ton of bricks, but at the same time it made him feel complete, for the first time in his life… He belonged
“Out!” She squealed and put her little palm over the window, pointing out. Sherlock gaped and John’s eyes opened wide. “Out!” She exclaimed again and banged on the window for effect. Sherlock held her tight and she fought her way off his arms to go out until Sherlock relented and she half crawled, half butt-walked her way to the door. Sherlock and John looked at each other, not knowing what to do until she demanded their attention again, her second word being “Daddy!” and pointing at John and to the door again shouting “Out!”.
They arrived to Angelo’s and the greeting was nothing John could’ve expected. A man practically launched himself to Sherlock and the young man simply smiled and tried, quite awkwardly to return the hug, though was more graceful when he returned the handshake.
“Maybe it was someone he knew” Mike grabbed the bottle and opened it, drinking some. John just shrugged.
At seven, John’s world was slightly shattered, he realised he was different and that his family might never understand him; after that day, he never felt like a real Watson. This reality came crashing on him at fifteen and with his first kiss ever. “Seven minutes in heaven” was the name of the game; the party was at the Sholto residency’s basement, his first party and Sarah, the first girl inside the closet waiting for him. He walked in, sweaty palms; twisted stomach and an excruciating desire to run the other way. Sarah’s lips were dry, her tongue was all over the place; she tasted like crisps and tomato basil dip; John had no idea what to do with his hands as he mentally counted the seconds for the seven minutes to be over, she pulled him a bit closer, his hands resting on her shoulders and hers travelling through his hair giving him a dishevelled look.
He opened his eyes and Eurus was staring at him. How long had he been standing there with the violin under his chin? It felt like a lifetime, had she responded to his question?
“How was your day?” Molly asked mischievously and Sherlock glared at her “Is she ready?” She asked and tried to get in the house but Sherlock stopped her.
Titus Crispus Selus is playing his lute, concentrating hard on the sounds, when a shrill cry cuts the music. He runs to the room and sees his mother, laying senseless on her bed, blood all over the place and a midwife holding his little brother. Father is called home, mother is dying and he'll have to the decide what to do. An hour later he comes to Titus' room and tells him that they'll be moving. Titus wants to cry, but father just shakes his head. A week later, Titus and his brother are sent away to live with their aunt, away from Rome, away from home.
Marcus is called to join the army, Uncle Claudius is not happy, but when Caesar himself calls you, there's nothing left but to leave and serve. He's twenty one after all. The year 55 B.C. marks a change in Marcus' life, he is sent on his first campaign as part of the seventh legion, Legio VII Claudia, to Britannia. The first was a hard campaign against the barbarians, but he manages to survive and help others, he's recognised and praised by Caesar and granted a new rank.
“As I told your brother, I don’t care about his money, or yours, for that matter” John was trying with all his might not to punch this pompous prick, he didn’t even knew his name but he hated him already.
“Why are you so tense?” Sherlock approached him and John flinched “Why are you so angry?” Sherlock walked away from John and went to the living room, settling comfortably on his chair in front of the chimney.
Sherlock arrived just in time to Paddington to catch the 12 o’ clock to Oxford. Mycroft texted him but Sherlock ignored the text, at least for the time being, and occupied himself with researching more about John Watson. He should be checking the assignments his teacher sent him, but his mind was too preoccupied with the ash blond, with the blue eyes and sturdy body to think about anything else. He found himself wanting to hear his voice again, feel his hands over his body, kissing him…
At some point, John and Sherlock were in the same place, at the same time, but separated by six degrees, at Molly’s sixteenth birthday. James was kissing John, Victor was trying to kiss Sherlock, and as the butterfly wings that define the entire faith of the universe, they didn’t meet that evening because Sherlock fled the place five seconds before John turned on his heels and recognised Victor as one of his new Biology classmates.
“As I was saying” Sherlock cleared his throat “Molly was on babysitting duty, but she left without warning” He cradled the baby closer “And I really have no idea what to do with a four months old baby” He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, trying to calm his nerves.
"My soldier." Sherlock stands and approaches me in a catlike manner, I love how graceful he is, like a panther stalking a prey. His expression tells me all I need to know; and I know the time for remembering is over as he successfully distracts me from the lingering memory.
John wanted to bolt his classes and go get his daughter but the professor chose that precise moment to greet him and ask him a few questions about the lecture; he was forced to stay. A few minutes later he received another text.
But then the text, what the hell does “out of town” means, why does he have to leave. He finished his session, the woman leaving before him when he caught a glimpse of Sherlock in a cab and ran to the car -thank god for red lights- he climbed in it and demanded an explanation, but Sherlock simply left him, unable to utter a single word… Sherlock knew about “E” and then that other women had flirted with him before he pursued his one and only Sherlock Holmes, but now he wasn’t flirting, nor cheating, he was getting help…
In less than 90 seconds, Sherlock Holmes -John Watson learned the name of the force of nature that came and turned his life upside down in mere seconds- as Sergeant Lestrade introduced him, solved the case and had the Yard looking for Mary’s ex-boyfriend, David. A text message, a threat made over drinks a few nights before, the carnage of the wedding dress, the cut on her ring finger, and the stab wounds to her heart and abdomen, the missing shoes “probably a souvenir, find out if he gave him those”, and the obvious -cue eye roll, huff and annoyed look at the moronic members of the Yard- indentation of a male shoe in the carpet right below the window indicating the way the perpetrator had come in and out of the room, startling the victim -“Mary” John corrected him- which is why she was facing the window. There was no struggle, the victim -“Mary” John huffed- knew the perpetrator and probably trusted them -“him, David”, John let out a sad groan- he pushed her, thus making the chair tumble, the victim following suit; the first wound was to the chest; he fixed her hands up and stabbed her the second time; the second wound was to the abdomen, “but she probably was dead by then. A crime of passion, performed with anger, revenge the main sentiment involved in the crime” Sherlock concluded and John just uttered “Fantastic”, startling the entire room and tinting with a cute blush Sherlock’s cheekbones.
The talk with his parents went rather smoothly. Henry and Julia Watson beamed at them, hugging them both “I knew this blokes’ thing was just a phase” Julia shook her head, looking up at the ceiling and smiling “Thank heavens!” She lifted her hands, clasping them before hugging Mary again. Mary tried to smile but her eyes were filled with tears, one look to John and she knew that she hadn’t just ruined one life, she had ruined many in less than 90 seconds.
“well, you couldn’t really tell. Is that a vibrato or is your hand shaking?” He managed to deceive her, but at the same time he was truly nervous, he couldn’t get rid of the passionate moment and he wanted to stay still, but his body betrayed him for a moment
“I could take the advanced exams and finish early” Sherlock was leaning on the door frame, looking at John intently.
Titus plays the lute like the angels. Aunt Livia congratulates him and allows him to play for hours on end. Titus plays his sorrow every day, but on his fifteen birthday the tune changes and he plays a rather happy song. Aunt Livia is marveled, she praises him, but he just nods, wanting the woman out of his chamber. He's been feeling giddy since this morning, For the first time in ten years his heart is bursting with happiness, inexplicable happiness.
She let them in to the flat and John stood there for a while contemplating their new home; Sherlock had dumped his stuff haphazardly all over the place, boxes filled with book, cases with his chemistry set and his microscope. A bed with a mattress lay on one wall next to five suitcases and a trunk containing Sherlock’s clothes. John’s boxes and suitcases were placed near the window, next to a desk and a couple of chairs. The cot they had ordered that morning had already arrived -“Mycroft helped”, Sherlock explained quietly- and it was standing next to another door.
"Sleep sounds good," He mutters, ever since we first kissed, we've been sharing dreams, we're exhausted, many of the "dreams" turn into horrible nightmares of times lost and gone. Everything is coming back to us in sudden flashes... sometimes rushes of happiness so strong that leaves us giddy for days, others, unbearable pain that renders us useless, the dreams rarely bring comfort, or sense of completion; but now...
"Oh God!" I feel my John tremble and embrace him closer, some memories too hurtful. "I... I paid... for you..." He sobs in my neck. I feel desperate, I have to tell him.
He saw him arrive and his heart started to thump in his chest, he could feel his lungs beg for air and he had to concentrate. He had arrived, once more, to see him perform, he just hoped he stayed and introduce himself… He looked a bit tired, but the minute his eyes landed on Sherlock, he smiled and clearly relaxed.
He knows he's not allowed to touch himself, but he can't help it, he can still feel the tightness surround him, quivering and bringing him to orgasm, then that velvety mouth, doing such delicious things, and once again, tight heat surrounding him. He'd never had sex with the same woman (or man) twice, much less in the same visit, but this time... this time he couldn't get enough, he never felt more... loved... more... alive.
Sherlock was satisfied with the deductions he had made the first time he met John, even though he still remained a mystery in many aspects, he was absolutely pleased with the knowledge that John in fact was gay and that the baby wasn’t his. It still remained a mystery why he was marrying Mary, but that could be easily solved by questioning him. Unfortunately, Lestrade wouldn’t allow Sherlock in the interrogation room; Lestrade even went to the lengths of calling Mycroft to retrieve his nosy little brother form the yard and fetch him back to Oxford, he had already missed more school days than he’d asked for. Reluctantly, Sherlock followed his brother, but not before he got a hold of John’s contact information.
The reason behind his enthusiasm was that he was chosen, amongst many, to become the Great Dane, the prince himself, Hamlet. He was overjoyed and began practicing day and night. After this particular performance, he chose to stay a couple more years in University and get another degree in English Literature from the University of London, so he could participate in the London theatre scene. Mycroft wasn’t happy, he was afraid Sherlock might relapse, but he had to admit that since his brother joined the club he was more… manageable… He decided to test his brother and refused to pay his tuition fee, which led us to today and Sherlock performing for a bunch of strangers “a salacious”- Mummy had called it- play… It was “Sweet Charity” and Sherlock loved it.
After washing the dishes he joined John in the bathroom and helped with Rosie; by the time they were done, baby girl changed and ready to go the park. Their visit to the park was nothing out of the extraordinary, Rosie looking after every insect and flower she could find, John and Sherlock walking hand in hand, pushing the buggy together and talking about everything and nothing.
And so their days go by, watching the tiny human being getting bigger, growing steadily and surpassing everyone’s expectations with her cleverness and the way she learns, understands, accepts and loves unconditionally. They are amazed by this little girl that has turned their lives upside down, that has made them better people just by trusting in them blindly, trusting that they’ll be there for her.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and continued walking, his mind lost in those eyes once again. He thought about the information he had gathered on the man. Nineteen; second year Med Student at Bart’s, ace grades through school, rugby captain, got the championship for his team three years in a row -and looked sinful in those white trousers- interested in military formation, had applied to RAMC, was accepted and was supposed to go to training but had asked for a licence to be married. Now his military career was on stand-by because he’s a single parent now. And those eyes… He opened the door and took a deep breath, put his phone to the side and picked his books for the afternoon lecture. Maybe a little distance could help…
Sherlock read it out loud and John smirked “Come here, my gorgeous genius” John pulled him for yet another kiss before ravishing him once again.
Mycroft was left dumbfounded; he had expected something else, something different, not this person, this man, that seemed to love his brother, so soon after they first met; could he be right in assuming Sherlock had found the person that was to stay with him for the rest of his life? He certainly hopped so.
"Coffee!" John is cheerful this morning, it's heartening, it means he's feeling well and happy. It could also be all the sex we're having, but I, too, find myself smiling more often than not, much to my dismay, and John's amusement, while in the presence of others. "Making love," John calls our physical encounters, I feel like rolling my eyes, but the giddy feeling in my chest makes me nod and kiss him again. Who would have thought I was so... physical?
“Yup” John nodded “I think it’s a good idea calling Mycroft” John picked their cups and went to the kitchen “Ready for bed?” He asked from the kitchen door. Sherlock nodded and followed him. They climbed in bed together, wearing nothing but their pants; but by the time their heads hit the pillows they were both fast asleep, it had been a long day.
Titus feels his skin start to burn in a way he's never felt before. His hair bristles and hes forced to stop playing; as he turns to see, he catches a glimpse of a blond head. His heart starts beating madly and for a second he thinks it's going to burst.
“My parents are smart investors; Mamie inherited her family’s fortune and divided it into three. Our futures are… solved” Sherlock spared a glance at John but kept his gaze low on the table “Mycroft is quite clever and he invested our three parts, just like our parents did, and our trust funds are to be delivered by our eighteenth birthday, our marriage or our university graduation, whichever happens first, though I agreed to accept mine after graduation”
First times -spectacular first times- belong in books, to literary romantic heroes. The veiled, yet somehow arousing descriptions of how a hand travels up and down a leg and finds its way back to a backside or to a nape, are just part of embellished romantic stories from the nineteenth century, or part of salacious, erotic novels that can be quite descriptive of a sexual, turned romantic, encounter between two bodies -usually a man and a woman- that finally unleash their passions.
They ate in an uncomfortable silence, neither knowing how to resume the conversation. When the food was finished and dessert was served, the silence had turned into tension, Sherlock kept looking out the window and fidgeting, John was focused on the candle in front of him, both thinking about what to do and ask. John decided it could be a good idea to come and live with Sherlock, that would give them time to know each other, but it could also ruin everything, having a baby wasn’t easy and Sherlock just had shared with Rosie a few nights at Oxford, never in London.
He usually tried not to giggle when the chosen man’s eyes popped almost out of their orbits when he winked and wiggled his arse in an enticing way.
“Thank you” John wanted to hug him, kiss him, do something but he was frozen in space and all he could do was look at him. Sherlock nodded and smiled lopsidedly.
At seventeen, the beautiful, young and little girl at heart, found out, after 90 seconds, that her life as it was, was over… At seventeen, Mary Morstan, the one which every girl never wanted to be, and every boy wanted to avoid, learned that she was pregnant…
At sixteen, he couldn’t deny it anymore, he had done some research, he had dated a few girls and after seven glorious minutes in heaven, in the same closet, in the same basement, with James, he realised he liked boys much more than he liked girls, and all he wanted to do was keep on kissing those dry lips accompanied by a light stubble on the jaw line, feel those strong hands on his hair, giving him a dishevelled look and have that restless tongue all over the place, or better yet, all over him… John faced his new reality and accepted, for the second time in his life, that he would never be “a real Watson”
“I appreciate the offer” John took a deep breath “No thanks” He looked out of the window and his face brightened when he saw the black door to their flat and Sherlock at the door, waiting for them. John practically bolted out of the car and rushed to Sherlock, kissing him like a drowning man. Sherlock smiled softly against John’s lips, whispered something in his ear and John beamed at him.
While he was with his mother Molly called. She had called him several times but John was angry; she had left his daughter alone with a stranger, a very attractive, sweet, lovely… OH GOD! Amazing, wonderful, incredible… stranger… a beautiful stranger. John sighed and answered, trying his best not to shout at his friend “What?” He barely managed with some grace.
I have no idea how getting ahead works in UK Universities, but I guess it works the same, getting advanced classes, turning papers and taking exams (At least that’s how I did it…), so I’m furthering the freeform here and extending the freeform universe to Oxford.
With Rosie settled comfortably in her carrier and snuggled close to Sherlock’s chest, they moved to the kitchen to get lunch ready; every ten or so minutes John would check his clock and would glance anxiously at Sherlock who seemed more relaxed, but the tension was evident in his jaw, his back, his hands, the way he moved as if uncomfortable with his clothes, as if they were itchy, or how he passed trembling fingers over his already tousled locks to hide the hand tremors.
I pull him closer, kissing him softly, he smiles leaning down and deepening the kiss. I respond, feeling the urge to be with him, every way I can, anytime I can. "I thought you said sleep," my voice is low and husky, he just kisses me again and lowers his hands to my back.
Marcus has become a strong young man. Uncle Claudius can't be more happy. Marcus has proved, time and time again, to be a good son and a good man. Claudius handed him the farm and its thriving under his watch. At eighteen, he's a seasoned farmer. He's learned all about farming and manning farmers, he's also convinced uncle to go into Aquaculture  and the business has flourished, they are traders and have a growing business, though now they have people working for them, Marcus likes to deliver the goods himself, particularly to the most prominent houses.
Life the next four months went by pretty much the same. John was working and had been accepted to work at Saint Bart’s, better pay than at the surgery; he had rugby practices twice a week and helped Sherlock with a few cold cases. Sherlock, on the other hand, had managed to get Lestrade a raise and a better office and the offer for a promotion if he continued the good work. He helped him solve crimes and chase criminals.
John agreed to meet at the coffee shop, it wasn’t a rare occurrence. Greg usually invited him for coffee, talked a lot about Molly, Rosie and… Sherlock; it was the only way he had to find about the young man, mostly because he was a bit of a coward and had no idea how to start a conversation with him.
“They said they’ll be in contact soon” John said, closing his eyes, he couldn’t bear lying to his parents this way. Mary squeezed his hand and he looked at her, both were lost, they only had each other and this lie.
“Hi” John said shyly to the man in front of him, wanting nothing more than to ravish him with kisses.
John also could spend hours watching Sherlock, endless hours of watching this sweet man sleep, the way his face would tell him everything while he was unguarded in his sleep. He looked younger, fragile, sweeter, his features smooth and soft, those lips pursed in an eternal “kiss me” way, riotous curls spilled over their white pillow cases and limbs, so many limbs clinging to him, soft breathing on his neck, and those eyes, when open, amazing eyes that looked at everything with wonder, curiosity and so much knowledge at the same time. Sherlock’s eyes fascinate John, he could spend endless hours watching those eyes shift colour with every passing hour, how they looked in the middle of the morning while looking after Rosie, a luminous blue when the sun was up, or a soft green when the light was just right and muted. Unfathomable eyes that looked at his soul and smiled, smiled! at him! whenever he was near or close; the same eyes that got lost behind dilated pupils in the throes of passion.
“I told him I was done with university, I told him I was out, but I don’t think he paid much attention” He pouted “Anyway” He sighed “I’ve decided to go to King’s and study Forensic Science” He put another biscuit in his mouth and drank some more tea “I’ve talked to the headmaster already, turns out I’m ahead on the programme, I’ll be done in a year… Out of university for good”
He felt exhausted, sated, exceptionally so, but he didn’t want to move, he wanted to keep the connection for a few more precious seconds while they both recovered their breaths and their heart rates went back to normal. Foreheads touching; lips ghosting over lips; sated smiles and that dull ache of their muscles after a great exertion; John’s hands running over Sherlock’s body as Sherlock’s hands roamed over his back and neck. John slipped out, making Sherlock wince, but one smile and John relaxed, knowing Sherlock was fine.
“Besides, Mary invited him to make him feel guilty for leaving John” Molly continued to chit chat and Sherlock forced himself to pay attention “He acted like a real prick” Molly blushed at the word and Sherlock attempted a half smile, watching people pass by their table.
He says hi to me with that smile and kisses my forehead, then sits right in front of me and he knows, he always knows...
“Have a seat, John” Mycroft gave him another once over as they walked inside the house, he tried to be intimidating but apparently it wasn’t working.
The music began and Sherlock started moving his hips, swaying them rhythmically. He started his part
“Of course” Sherlock sniffed “Mamie usually asks us to visit during the summer, during her birthday, but this year she wanted us to visit earlier, something about new commitments” He tried to keep his voice steady as he rattled his excuse “I’m sorry if I’m disturbing you” He continued “Maybe I should call you on a later date” he grabbed the phone with such force, he’s knuckles whited.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at the mention of Molly “She’s been helping you?” He asked; the information new to him.
“You have your bags?” Sherlock asked and looked around. John nodded and Sherlock led him to the waiting car “We’re going to Orleans, but Mamie promised we’ll have time to visit Paris before we leave” Sherlock beamed at John and helped him get in the car with his bags and his baby.
This story won't be too long, maybe sixty or seventy chapters (WHAAAAAAAT? NOT LONG???? WTF??? I know! As i wrote, not TOO long). I hope you're enjoying it, not finding it too boring.
… He still found it hard remembering when and how John undressed; all he remembered was being under John’s naked body, the weight of him, his masculine scent filling his nose, his moans and huff, along with his pants filling his brain with bliss…
They ended up in the morgue at St. Bart’s. Molly was there, she’d been working as a junior assistant for the last four months and she received Sherlock there in a regular basis. He would go to perform experiments when he had cases. Most of them, experiments that required equipment too dangerous to have at home -although his mother had offered to “buy whatever you need, honeybee”, he had to refuse- for Rosie’s sake; now the remodelling was underway at 221C, but still, he couldn’t bring himself to accept the mass spectrometer his brother had offered…
She was… beautiful… incredibly so… As they say, every girl wanted to be her, every boy wanted to be with her… At seventeen, she was at the best moment of her life, about to graduate from school, about to go to Uni… Cambridge wanted her! But just like everything in life -even life itself- things change, in 90 seconds her life changed for ever…
From a very, very young age, Sherlock knew he was different, and he enjoyed being different. Having a loving family made no difference to his never resting mind, he knew they were all different, that Eurus, at seven, was the best there was in math, her riddles almost undecipherable, except for him and Mycroft; that Mycroft at fifteen, was on his way to become one of the youngest men accepted to Oxford’s Law; and that he, himself, could be whatever he wanted to be, even a forensic scientist specialised in chemistry.
"I have a similar memory, a beach, the same year. I guess we truly "just" missed each other." He quotes in the air and he sighs sadly. "But... but I felt a happiness hard to describe. I remember smiling the entire day." And there it is, his luminous smile, my conductor of light.
John watches her fondly; and closely, she's begun to walk and is now a danger to herself, so we must keep a close eye on her.
“Yeah” Sherlock sat next to him and they waited for the waiter in silence. Sherlock didn’t want any interruptions, like last night. They ordered and settled more comfortably before Sherlock started speaking “I’ve finished university, graduation will be in July, after your birthday” Sherlock chastised himself; he wasn’t supposed to know that.
A thousand years, I've waited for a thousand years. My body has seen war, famine, disease, pain... unbearable pain. My fingers have gone through many bodies, all dead ones; and my soul... my soul has wandered alone for over a thousand years.
“Dull? Am I that boring?” John mocked hurt, gasping and putting his hand to the left side of his chest, rubbing slowly his thundering heart.
“And how do you plan doing that?” Mr. Morstan sat, defeated, not willing to look at his daughter “A teenager in charge of a child, just started medical school and no job to show” He put his head in his hands “Are you even willing to marry her?” He asked and looked up at John. The always strong man looked devastated.
"We almost met," Sherlock sounds wistful. I'm forced to nod, the memory still lingers painfully on the back of my mind.
She told John about the baby before telling her parents, of course she did, but when John asked what was she going to tell them when they asked about the father, her face fell and she started crying. John just held her and she allowed the warmth of friendship wash over her “Would you help me?” She whispered against his neck and John nodded, his arms around her shoulders and worry all over his face.
“Not coming?” John couldn’t hide the disappointment and the confusion, why was Sherlock saying goodbye, today, of all days? Sherlock shook his head and schooled his features to appear calm, but John noticed “Why?” John asked and the answer was interrupted by the cabbie grunting a “well?” That had Sherlock helping John in the cab and closing the door after him and rattling John’s address. John barely had time to look back and see Sherlock climb in the back of a black sedan.
He went out, walking his anger off… He ended up back at the train station, he could just go back to London, but what would he do until midnight? No, he was not going back to that room, to Bill and the gang, to the desperate teenager that screamed bloody murder while he fucked her… he needed to take a break from the nonsense, the drunkenness, the fucking…
They bathed together, showered together, slept naked, shared small touches, but nothing truly sexual except John’s masturbatory sessions. The need was there, increasing with each passing day, but at the same time, the respect for each other, the knowledge that it will happen in time, and the fact that they already shared more intimacy than sex could bring, kept John happy and Sherlock relaxed.
At some point, during the next weekend, John helped Sherlock solve a cold case, they had lunch together and Sherlock talked with Rosie, Rosie recognising his voice. Sherlock would play the violin so she would sleep faster while feeding, making John’s work slightly more complicated when he needed to feed her; it never annoyed John, it actually made him truly happy that his daughter liked Sherlock so much.
“John?” Sherlock put his hand over John’s and John shook his head and started laughing hard “What?” Sherlock frowned and looked at him angrily.
Neither could sleep, too excited about their meeting. John finished his reading and was up before sun rise. He had a lecture in the morning and Molly had offered to take care of Rosie for the time being.
Suddenly, I jerk awake and breathe, needing the air more than anything. I know what to do know, I know where to go. John is guiding me. I can still feel his hand in mine, but it wasn't my John, although it was.. I have to come back.
John looked at the screen and shook his head “Wait until we fall asleep?” John asked and Sherlock nodded.
“Yes, she’s been great help” John smiled and his smile turned even brighter when Sherlock cradled the baby better and shushed her softly “it has made it easier to accept Mary’s gone” he smiled sadly “She was my best friend” John shrugged and looked at his coffee “But as I said; I’ve a great support system, but the nights are the hardest, I have to feed her twice every night, but we do manage” He looked at Rosie and Sherlock handed her back, feeling strangely empty.
and is allowed to study medicine. The Legio VII campaigned over Gaul and served Caesar during the entire Gallic Wars. Marcus climbed ranks, finally becoming a Centurion and a Medicus, specialised in combat surgery.
“Come in, it’s cold out here. Tea?” She rushed through the door to her flat looking back at them all the time.
“I can assure you I’ll be here for her” John continued talking as soon as Mr. Morstan stopped for air “I’ll take care of everything Mister Morstan” John said a bit shyly, but not because he was truly shy, but because he felt like a thief, the worst person on the face of the earth for lying to a man that had been so kind to him.
The baby was fine… Sherlock was fuming and John was pissed, but they’ll do anything for their daughter. The supposed fever was explained by the doctor as "a minor case of absence fever” Sherlock scoffed and John snorted, they both knew the doctor was lying. The doctor -an acquaintance of Molly and Mrs. Hudson- decided that the best “treatment” was for them to be together for a few days until the baby was feeling better… to share some with THEIR daughter
Sherlock rolled his eyes and walked to Baker Street, composed a quick text to his brother to let him know he was in London, going to Baker, and another to Molly to ask her to coffee before returning to Oxford for the last two weeks of his Hilary. He arrived to Baker Street right after lunch and lied about having eaten; Mrs. Hudson just eyed him with her motherly look and pretended to believe him before inviting him for tea while they talked, after he ate half a tin of biscuits Mrs. Hudson offered some cake and he ate happily. They talked about her husband and what evidence she got.
“Thank you, Bumble” Sherlock pinked to his ears and kept on holding his brother. They arrived to Mycroft’s flat and Sherlock practically bolted from the car, leaving Mycroft behind, shaking his head with affection.
Luckily for John, Sherlock was finishing packing Rosie’s stuff -at least that’s what John thought- so he didn’t realise Sherlock was standing by the window, witnessing John’s interaction with his mother.
So. I graduated from University on friday and celebrated for almost two days... Sorry for the delay. Two chapters today, also sorry for all the emails. Happy Sherlock
It was past eight when the Watsons made their way out of the flat, leaving and exhausted couple to fend with an over exited baby. They had to bathe her again to try and relax her with a scented bath; they read to her, Sherlock played the violin for over twenty minutes while John read her two Winnie the Pooh stories. It was after nine when she finally fell asleep; but they still had a flat to clean before starting all over the next day.
As he lay awake for a few moments watching at the ceiling, he reflected on the day. He was happy, like he had never been, not even his experiments made him as happy as watching Rosie sleep; but he was tired too, she was a full time job, he had no idea how John managed almost on his own for over five months; no matter how many people was there to help, he was always behind on something, might it be studying, sleeping, eating… living…
“Hey!” John practically ran to Sherlock the second he saw him standing outside Bart’s “What’re you doing here?” He asked and planted several kissed on Sherlock’s lips.
By four, he arrived to Chester Square and saw the three story house and was baffled by it. He somehow knew that Sherlock was a posh man but never imagined him having such a nice house in one of the poshest neighbourhoods in London. He rang the bell and his breath caught in his throat when Sherlock, in absolute disarray but as handsome as ever, opened the door and gave him a relieved smile. His dress shirt was stained with baby spit, his trousers, otherwise perfectly ironed looked creased and dirty with baby formula, his hair resembled a black nest of curls recently abandoned because it had been blown by a nuclear bomb. He had never looked more gorgeous to John.
“I don’t know. Isn’t it too soon?” John frowned and put his head on his hands, taking a deep breath he looked at his friends “I have Rosie to think of” He fiddled with his phone, willing it to sound “What if it doesn’t work?” John shrugged. “Could I move back with you? What about Rosie? What do I do?” He started pacing in the small kitchen.
“Those are the terms. If you’re not willing, I guess we’ll have to wait” John tried not to smirk, he knew Sherlock would accept from the moment he had asked.
“OF COURSE YOU’RE RESPONSIBLE” Alex Morstan shouted to the top of his lungs and barely managed to control his urge to punch John in the face. “You’re two bloody teenagers with all your life ahead of you” He continued, fists to the sides and red faced “You’re four months from turning nineteen and she’s barely seventeen” He sounded desperate, sad… massively disappointed… Mary flinched at the last few words and felt her world crumble.
John snorted and rolled his eyes “What, did your last beau leave you already?” He asked, a lot of spite in his remark -even though he wasn’t actually feeling anything but the need to run and find Sherlock, he had him in his mind all the time-, James shook his head and lowered his eyes, fixating his stare on the black beverage in front of him.
“Who the hell are you?” Donovan tried to stop John, but one look told her she better scurried out, or else; she froze on the spot and stood there unable to say another thing.
“We’re not together, Mamie” Sherlock managed before his voice broke and he had to swallow hard, closing his eyes to stop the tears “We’re just friends” He whispered and Mamie held him close.
The small, perfect bubble they created over the last 24 hours dissolved the moment they landed in London. A car was waiting for them to take John back to his flat and to take Sherlock to Marylebone Station. The first goodbye kiss they shared was as bittersweet as expected; more salty than either wanted to admit, as fulfilling as a goodbye kiss could be. The minute Sherlock arrived to the train station he texted John.
Rosie is the centre of their universe; they work around her and for her. Sherlock is always thinking of new ways to improve her skills, being reading or playing for her for hours, showing her pictures and teaching her words, complicated words. So far, Rosie has learned to say “skull”, “forensic” -though it sounds more like frensic-, “laboratory” -but in her little mouth sounds like labotory- “femur” -feemu- “anatomy” -tatomy- amongst others. John simply chuckled at Sherlock’s attempts, but admires both of them, Sherlock for teaching her and Rosie for learning such difficult words.
They shared an intense stare down for a few moments, while John took Rosie out of Mycroft’s car, their silent conversation went from questioning motives, to silent accusations, then to realisation to finally end in a heartfelt apology from both. They both tilted their heads, both nodded and Mycroft left the happy couple to enjoy their first day in their new home.
Early next morning she went back to John before her parents called John’s. “We have to tell them before they do” She said with a slight sense of urgency.
“I will, tonight” Sherlock nodded once “I guess we’ll come by tomorrow at seven, he’s just finishing exam week today” He beamed proudly.
“No, actually we are…” He said to the cup and cleared his throat “I’m very sorry, John” He continued and looked up, but John was looking elsewhere “Victor…” John glared at the name “We’ve been together longer than you think” James looked away “Since we met…” He bit his lower lip “That party at Molly’s… I was supposed to break up with you and he was supposed to break up with his boyfriend but in the end… well…” John closed his eyes and took a deep breath, that night they had had sex…
John relented, he had no power against Sherlock’s mighty pout, he found it endearing. He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him for a kiss “Fine” He said against Sherlock’s lips “But with one condition”
“Then he left with someone in a black car and haven’t heard of him since. That’ll be about twenty minutes now” John looked at his phone and scowled at it. He left the unopened bottle over the kitchen counter.
Silas dies of old age, surrounded by children and grandchildren. Maria, his wife, by his side, his last memory is of raven curls between his fingers, soft skin against his own, the smell of jasmine surrounding him, At 64, his soul finds peace.
His heart was aching, he had no idea how he was going to survive, but he let his anger and frustration fuel him, the least he wanted was to see John Watson, the man he had given his life for and had received nothing but disdain in return. He pulled out his phone again and swiped the call of the screen, John kept calling him…
As life goes by, John had met Victor while he was waiting with Sherlock for some results at the hospital, he had a case and the information he needed could only be provided by a doctor at Bart’s; as for Sherlock, he met James while he was waiting for Victor to collect some papers at the registration office in Queen Mary University of London.
Marcus' Centuria arrives to Thapsacus. The morning of 6 April finds them preparing for battle. Caesar leaves his tent and addresses his men, the mandatory "pep-talk" to raise spirits and points to the always useful and ever present "Roman Spirit" held by the standard-bearer. The sound of trumpets signals the start, confusion, elephants, archers. Marcus holds his position and the battle goes to Caesar. Sadly, Marcus doesn't see the end of the battle, he falls under friendly fire trying to save a fellow legionary.
He could feel Sherlock quiver around him, he hit that sweet spot once more and Sherlock was coming, untouched, with a cry of his name dying on his lips as he tried to breathe, John followed suit, one more thrust and he spent himself inside the willing body under his, the ecstasy making his body tremble, tremors that died when Sherlock ran a hand over his back and whispered a low “My love” in his ear.
He had seen him and his mind was filled with information; suit £2000, shoes £700, shirt £400, watch £3000, silk tie £450, tie pin £5000, ring-less fingers, over twenty five but under thirty, clever, a doctor, probably a surgeon, bisexual, of course -he had seen him eyeing the brunette waitress the first time he’d come to see the show- but his face was unreadable, he’ll direct a polite smile to those who greeted him, he would address the waitresses with the same plastered smile, but he had something that made Sherlock’s body writhe under his gaze, the lick to the lips that would give Sherlock the best wank fantasies, and nothing else… the stranger, this JW was a mystery…
S!, moving in with said man and trying to find a job that wasn’t boring enough to kill him, raising a child and acting in ways he had never acted- failed, crashed and burned, it was keeping Mycroft on his toes, he needed to know if John Watson was right for Sherlock.
As for Sherlock, he was also halfway on his studies at King’s and was trying to manage his schedules, John’s, Rosie’s and his work with the police; his life with his little family was relatively easier than his life at school; yes, his teachers were impressed and were talking early graduation, but his peers were another thing; he had made a few friends, some he had worked with at the police, others knew him and John, but there were a few idiots on his way, Phillip Anderson the most renowned, jealous of Sherlock’s age, ability or whatever, he made Sherlock’s life a living hell.
“Are you going to tell me?” Sherlock sat at the kitchen table and watched as John moved around the kitchen to prepare their tea.
"He's always my brother," I say with a quiet snort. "He likes to play "you poor ignorant souls" once he realises he's my brother," I shake my head, I find it amusing that Mycroft, of all souls, is stuck with me. "I've told you he's always been like he is now."
“She suggested it, actually. Something about keeping your friends close” Mycroft smirked and Sherlock grinned deviously “Congratulations, little brother” Mycroft handed him an envelope and Sherlock turned it in his hand several times. “It’s not anthrax” Mycroft chuckled and Sherlock let out a huffed laugh.
Once they were done with Rosie’s room they ordered lunch for the troop, Rosie was already eating solids at eight months so they tried some rice with vegetables which Rosie enjoyed, not only tasting but sharing with the people around her. Eurus was fascinated with the little girl and tried to teach Rosie her name during the entire lunch, Rosie simply giggled and called her “Eee”
But as many times, Rosie was the cause for the spell to be broken and the magical moment to be over; not a squeal, a cry of pain that had them both rushing up the stairs to her bedroom, to find her struggling with the sheets and rubbing her tummy.
I hear Rosie so I go to fetch her, she sees me and smiles, a warmth spreads over my chest and I reach for her. She immediately clings to me, little hands reach for my neck and hair, head burrowing on my neck, My heart could burst with happiness, it has done so before.
In the morning he prepares his parcels and goes to the well-known route; but today, today he has a new client and he can't be happier, he'll get the chance to see where Paulla, daughter of Livia, lives. As he gets close to the house he hears the lute, and his heart stops. His pulse quickens and he feels like he's floating. The music runs through his body igniting his blood, heart bursting with joy, eyes filled with happy tears. He walks in a trance and catches a glimpse of unruly raven curls, he thinks is Paulla, but when he sees her sitting close to the yard, he looks away from her and concentrates on the angel playing joyful sounds.
22:50 Thanks for the help. Found the brother, singed like a canary. Paperwork tomorrow. Anderson transferred.
Vivienne, always the perceptive one in her marriage, promptly picked up on her grandson mood and took him away after the third day of watching him fade away. They went to check the covered garden, the first spring sprouts and the first bees collecting pollen from the first spring flowers.
“I’m curious about Jim” He said “He lied to all of us but was perfectly honest with my sister; is as if they are playing a game and we’re the ones that should loose” Sherlock continued talking, eyes closed, as if remembering the afternoon “I find it hard to trust him, but at the same time I can’t find reasons not to” He huffed “I should call Mycroft and ask”
The afternoon usually means nap time, potty training or a change of nappy, a quick clean-up and a change of clothes; a bit of chamomile tea with honey and a two hour nap, helped by the music Sherlock has recorded for her. After nap time, she would spend the afternoon with her grandparents, the Holmes, the Watsons or the Morstans, at least three hours every single afternoon, giving a bit of a rest to their young parents.
“Ready for bed?” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock nodded “Come love” He pulled him close by the waist and led him to their bedroom. John undressed Sherlock slowly; feather touches over his chest and back. Sherlock kissed his neck and opened John’s shirt with expert fingers. They pulled trousers and pants off and helped each other to bed. John opened his arms and Sherlock rested his head on John’s chest, hearing his heart beat
“Sherlock?” John tried and Sherlock’s eyes moved rapidly, much like when he was on a crime scene inside his mind palace.
“That’s very brave of you” Mycroft actually smiled “I wonder” Mycroft took a deep breath “What if Mary was alive?”
Sounds harder than it is? Not at all. Is it easier than you believe? Not at all. We just wander blindly for eons, until we're able to truly see... And to truly see... Means you have to let go...
“You, frigid bitch” Anderson held Sherlock by his collar and Sherlock looked at him impassively. In that moment John made his appearance and walked in the room.
He waited two days before contacting Greg, he kept calling Sherlock only to find no answer to his desperate calls. He asked Mrs. H to look after Rosie while he looked for Sherlock underground, every hidden spot, every drug den, dose house, everywhere, and he discovered a new Sherlock; a man that had done so much for so many, that demonstrated love, affection, care and many human emotions that had him absolutely baffled
By fifteen, her heart broke again when she found out Sherlock liked boys too and she wanted to cut her wrists when Sherlock had introduced Victor Trevor as his boyfriend. In time, by seventeen, she accepted her faith and her focus went to Sherlock’s older brother, Mycroft, who had recently broken up with long-time girlfriend Anthea, she found him interesting and charming and she wanted him like she had never wanted anyone. She discovered, with that crush, that she liked older men, and when Mary had told her all about the cute constable that picked her up from James’ house, she made her goal to have him.
talking about music and literature, discussing criminal law and the best way to punish and capture said criminals. He starts working with members of the senate and is well known. At eighteen, he's as known as Caesar. The year 55 B.C. becomes the year of Titus, as he goes to Greece to become a philosopher.
Didn't you know? Soulmates can lose one another, but this happens ever since one soul "killed" the other. Heard of "Cain and Abel"? Different names depending on language and belief system... Which is why I call the dawning of humanity a catastrophe. As soul-kind goes, we souls have a way of doing things, as I said...wrote...?
The first kiss was a surprise, they hadn’t even shared their names and he had that sweet tongue exploring his mouth with an eagerness that could only be compared to his own…
John approached him during the monologue and placed a cup of tea near him “I hate it when you do that” John huffed “But I love it when you deduce” He sat in front of him and sipped his tea “You kept looking at him” John moped and crossed his arms in front of his chest.
“Bring her, it's fine” Greg let out a deep breath, his plan could be ruined by the baby, but if he was right, Sherlock might be on board with the baby.
Hanno runs faster, he can hardly breathe. He feels immensely happy, full of life. He tries to catch a glimpse of the men, but he is too late.
They left Angelo’s with a simple goodbye and stood awkwardly at the door. Sherlock lifted his hand and as magically as everything he does, he summoned a cab “Want this one?” Sherlock asked, not looking at John.
He felt a few tears run down his cheeks, unable to look up, looking for a pulse and knowing he’ll never find it. She looked pale and rather beautiful, something akin of a smile over her lips, maybe the certainty, even in death; that John will be there for their daughter. Time started again when he looked up and saw all the pale faces surrounding him, Rosie’s cries brought him back to reality and he walked to his brother and held his baby daughter to his chest; at that very moment he realised little Rosie had just lost her mother and they were alone, he was in charge of a baby that wasn’t his but that was his in every sense of the word; she is Rosie Watson, daughter of John Watson, in less than 90 seconds he became a single parent.
Rosie, the apple of their eyes… Oh how many times had Rosie interrupted what could have become their first time… Since the beginning, they had stablished a routine, with her, with their families and friends, with everything and everyone, and between them; but one day, things just shifted; Sherlock caught John masturbating and couldn’t help but stare until John came with a quiet cry of his name. After that, Sherlock became a voyeur and would just watch John pleasure himself, knowing that his presence fuelled the fantasy.
, before Sholto’s deployment to Iraq- about eighty something one night stands after the break up -at least 10 every month since two months after the breakup and until he met Sherlock,
Sherlock looked up from the cocoon in the bed and covered his head again, grumbling something unintelligible. He kept thinking about all the wrong things he had done to John and how justified his actions were, but at the same time he had this nagging in the back of his head that reminded him of everything he had done, how much he had opened to John and the fact that, he too, deserved to be loved and respected. He was about to leave the bed and face John when he felt a hand on his shoulder and John was sitting next to him
And then… then… then John knew he couldn’t not board that train, that he'd have to stay and meet this mythical creature, because the beauty was standing in front of him, mercurial eyes, Gray? Blue? Green? were looking at him, dissecting him, reading him like an open book… Those eyes then focused on his hair, then followed a path down his neck… he took a deep breath and his own eyes travelled down to those lips, plump, red, a perfect’s cupid bow… his breath hitched when a red tongue travelled across them and disappeared back behind the sweet plumpness…
