“No.” He looks up in shock from where his gaze has been slipping shamefacedly towards the floor and Steve has a stubborn set to his jaw. The soldier catches himself, turns his voice soft and low before he starts again. “That’s not true, Tony.” He gets up from his chair and makes the couple steps to where Tony’s sitting before crouching down so they’re at eye level. He lifts a hand and it wavers in the air slightly before he sets it firm on the engineer’s knee. “Did that hurt?” he asks softly, gaze raking down Tony's chest and settling on the scars with a new expression the genius has never seen before. It’s not pity or probing or judgement. Just quiet curiosity and patient waiting and normally Tony would just tell him to fuck off, but-. Steve’s just waiting there, so close, the warmth of his touch burning through his jeans and his expression isn’t demanding. Just offering.
Thor’s staring down at the floor now, eyes blinking rapidly as if he’s fighting back tears and Tony’s the one to pull him into a hug this time. The Asgardian stills for a second and then lifts his arms to pull the engineer tight to his chest. He clings to him for several moments before the god’s breathing eases and when Thor pulls back he looks better.
“Nope, you interrupted poker night so you have to play. Now, come and get drunk and I’ll order a stupid amount of Chinese food while we put Clint to shame.” Tony plops down on the floor dragging Bruce along, and he can only laugh as he feels some of the tension roll out of his shoulders. He’s been gone for three months on a medical aid mission in India and while it’s certainly not the stress of battling aliens and gods, trying to save innocent people from the ravages of disease on the edge of the world with no resources took its toll.
Then Steve pulls back, settles back into his chair and Tony sees him turn an embarrassed shade of scarlet as he notices the coffee staining Tony’s shirt.
“Don’t worry Jarvis, I’ll take it easy.” I laugh and jet into the sky. The lights of the city become a blur below me, the speed on the HUD slowly increasing until I’m skirting 200 miles per hour.
“That was still a small initiative when I went undercover for this op.” Even though there’s no reason for Iron Man to lie to him, Steve is wary. What’s a superhero to gain by lying to an ancient relic? “I haven’t been under for more than a year.”
“Ah, no.” I look around for the wires that I’d left lying around…somewhere. “Have you seen a couple of copper—” Rhodey dangles the elusive wires from his fist. “Yeah those. Give em to me.”
She straightens out from her casual position next to my desk. “Toni, I won’t accept the position if your requirement is for me to sleep with you.” Her tone is so sharp I wince. “And for that matter, I’ll take it up with HR. This is sexual harass—”
He’d pressured Toni into lowering the amount of alcohol she consumed. That meant that sometimes instead of going to a bar or pub, they go to a restaurant or drive thru instead. Steve avoids thinking that the times they spend in restaurants count as dates.
“I know. It’s an accident.” I sober when I remember that he must have had a hard time these past months what with Fury’s death. “I heard about Fury…”
After making the repairs to my suit and applying the badass paint job to it, I finally collapse on my bed. I’m out like a light immediately.
“Not the time J.” Toni says, uncharacteristically cutting off her precious AI. “Now, Steve, you have a passport, right? Oops, should have led with that.”
Steve doesn’t comment on the title, not up for an argument, and nods in acknowledgement to Jarvis’ words. The ride goes by in silence; the doors opening without a whisper when he arrives at the penthouse. He steps out hesitantly, unsure of what direction to take.
Sudden lights flood the room. I’d thought I was in a building of some sort but with the light, I finally realize that I’m in a cave.
So Bucky sighed and stood next to the skinny pain in the ass, defiantly staring down the other kid. Luckily for them, Steve’s bully had been the kind to pick on the loners and seeing as Steve was suddenly backed up by Bucky, he’d left them alone.
Of course, that resentment wasn’t exclusively Steve’s. Bucky hated Steve for the fact that his parents loved him. Don’t get me wrong. Winnifred Barnes loved Bucky to pieces, but his father was another story. George Barnes was a drunk and an aggressive one at that.
The news breaks when Steve is punching a stubborn sandbag into submission. He hears the low murmuring of the agents in the gym but as usual, he ignores them. After Nat’s bombshell, Steve has been even more reticent than usual. So for a good ten minutes, he’s still stuck in his bubble, trying to work out his demons and worry for Bucky with good old physical exertion.
“Oh, right.” Steve launches into a long-winded monologue about the importance of mission debriefs and reports. Most the agents’ eyes glaze over around the ten-minute mark but Sam has a knowing glance that as much as Steve wants to bore into stupor, he knows that there’s going to be a Conversation when they get back to HQ.
“You can’t keep ignoring this Toni!” He argues behind me as I move closer to the suit. “It’s been what? A year?”
I tap the chest piece and he immediately flinches. “Relax honeybun, I’ve made this specifically for you.”
“What the fuck did you do to him?” Steve turns back to the shiny metal, his face thunderous. It’s only Sam’s soft voice that pulls him away from the edge of violence.
Natasha rolls her eyes. “You’re such a drama queen Steve. Just call her up and tell her about your other best friend’s disappearance. Maybe she’ll even help you find him.”
“Steve is Captain America?” I ask her, still unable to process more information than this shocking revelation. “Since when?”
Besides, it’s not like I’m about to become classified myself. The arc reactor itself won’t make waves but my suit…
“What were you doing in our warehouse? Were you looking for the drugs?” Each question is punctuated with punches and kicks, which if they were real interrogators, they would have realized is counterproductive to a talkative hostage. “Did the Polski’s send you?”
I press my fingers into the skin of my cheeks, a strangled sob in my throat. God, this damn thing is driving me insane. I just wish I could either find an answer to this or die already but this waiting around to see what happens is killing me slowly.
Steve coughs, stifling something that sounds suspiciously like a chuckle.  I narrow my eyes at him, but Pepper gets my attention before I can say anything.
“Quit it. You’re grown men, stop acting like children,” she rolls her eyes as she takes a sip of her own scotch. “Though I would say, “last picked for dodgeball assassin.” Tony laughs uproariously as Clint casts hurt, puppy dog eyes in Natasha’s direction.
Tony can’t help but launch into a description of all the cool tricks and toys he’s hidden away on her and Hawkeye’s floors and eventually just tells her he’ll give her the tour himself. Just as he’s about to drag her down to her quarters, his phone rings and he plucks his phone out of his pocket to frown.
That’s not to say he’s not happy to see Thor when he shows up six weeks after their poker game with Bruce. They’re all gathered in the common room; it’s a lazy night, there honestly hasn’t been enough high-level threats to assemble the team in two whole months and, in that time, they’ve settled into a routine. Most nights, they eat dinner together before settling into the common room to watch a movie or play cards. There’s Movie Night and Poker Night every week and Tony’s honestly considering breaking out some of his old Dungeons and Dragons books because he can only clean Clint out so many times before he genuinely starts to feel bad.
This night though, there’s no team-mandated game or threat. It occurs to Tony vaguely as he glances up from his tablet that it’s almost a domestic scene. Natasha curls into Clint’s side, reading a book with Russian scrawling over the cover as the archer plays a videogame on the TV. She glances up occasionally to give him a fond smile and snickers softly every time he dies horribly in the nuclear wasteland on the television. Bruce sits on the floor, hunched over the coffee table covered in papers and charts as he lets out an annoyed huff every once in a while before scratching something out. Tony smiles at the scene, his friends all gathered around him and he has a moment to enjoy the soft warmth that blossoms in his chest.
Tony laughs at that and it’s clear and loud, honest. “I don’t know if anyone’s warned you yet, but it’s basically impossible to get something through my thick skull.”
Only a week later he stumbles into the living room still rubbing sleep out of his eyes and discovers Clint and Natasha snuggled up on the couch watching cartoons eating cereal in their pajamas.

“Many thanks, fair Bruce. I quite enjoy this tunic friend Anthony has bestowed upon me. A skilled artisan has woven the beloved likeness of dear Mjolnir into my garb!” Thor smiles proudly and Clint snickers as he watches Bruce turn a dark shade of red at the word fair. Oh yeah, Tony thinks, he and Nat are totally going to be playing matchmaker with these two.
now-- Wait, no, Jesus Christ do not do that!” He stands up from the couch, running a hand through his hair he strides briskly towards the elevator. He’s waving his free hand around as he listens to the other person ramble and turns back towards the pair on the couch as he pulls his phone away from his ear. “Sorry, guys some intern’s about to start an apocalypse and I only employ morons apparently so I have to go handle it,” he rolls his eyes as if someone’s just broken the toaster, not a caused a potential catastrophe.
Tony doesn’t respond, just gives him a winning smile and raises his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry birdbrain, you forced my hand. You keep buying My Little Pony episodes on my account and it’s really fucking up my recommendations list,” he clasps a hand to his heart and continues earnestly, “I am a man of science and you are going to make their sad little algorithms explode if you keep giving it whiplash by buying children’s shows and explosive ammunition in the same purchase,” he pauses for a second and puts a finger to his trademark goatee. “Actually, never mind Clint, I am almost certain that means you are, in fact, a serial killer and I should definitely never let you buy anything under my name ever again because I do not want that evidence being traced back to me.”
as he bumps into his mug, coffee sloshing down his shirt. Steve doesn’t seem to notice though, just clings to him tight and the genius is starting to suspect SHIELD agents must be goddamn touch-starved because they sure seem to hug him a lot.
That first day is blissful, Tony thinks, pressed too close to Steve on the couch as they marathon Star Wars.
I'll be real, this story was supposed to be a short song!fic, but accidentally turned into some overly long saga of Tony!Whump.
“I’m not sure I believe you soldier. But, thanks that- that means a lot.” Steve just shoots him a winning smile and squeezes the hand still twined over Tony’s heart before he pulls back and stands.
Clint laughs back and Tony smiles at the sound--pure and clear, it doesn’t sound tainted by restrained tears anymore. “How about we get you to bed, Barton. And I’ll see if I can get some poor Postmate to bring you some PopTarts at ass o’clock on a Tuesday.”
“Alright boys!” Tony claps his hands together and Natasha clears her throat. Tony rolls his eyes as he corrects himself. “Boys and lady. Stop flirting for just a second so we can pick out a movie.” Bruce turns an even deeper shade of red at that and Tony snickers a bit as Thor gives him a confused look.
Clint tries to keep up the pretense of being mock offended, until he gives up and smirks. “Well, as long as you’re aware I am a gold-digger, by willingly living with me, you have now absolved me of any blame for strange charges on your credit card,” he sets his cereal bowl down to shrug and Tony looks up to yell at the ceiling.
, free from all the negative connotations tangled up with New York from his childhood and literal wormholes.
Thor smiles widely, the previous sadness draining out of his face. “I know nothing of these so-called ‘flicks of chicks,’ however I trust you greatly in matters of the heart, dear Anthony.”
So he makes his way up the elevator to the common room kitchen groggily, scrubbing at his face to try and wake up. He does have coffee in his workshop, but DUM-E had decided to douse his Sumatra in motor oil yesterday morning so he decides he’d rather make the trip upstairs than possibly be the first person to die at the hands of an AI with the intelligence of toddler.
Tony’s not expecting the hug that Steve leans across the table to snatch him up in and he lets out a soft
Thor flushes pink at the question and he rubs a hand through his wet hair. “I was delivering Lady Jane back to her home on Midgard when she…” he pauses trying to find the right words for a moment, “I believe the term your people use is ‘broke up’ with me. I must confess, this development came as a bit of a shock. I have never been ‘dumped’ before, as your interwebs put it. However, Lady Darcy assured me the only remedy for the ending of a courtship is one’s shield brothers and something she calls ‘ice cream.’ So I thought I might inquire as to where I might encounter this magical tonic you call ice cream.”
Tony just shakes his head at them and cracks a smile as the elevator slides open to reveal a soaking wet Thor, Mjolnir in hand.
Sleep starts pulling him under and for the first time in a while he doesn’t even think about the nightmares that might haunt him tonight. Instead, he gives a small smile to the two men curled up on the loveseat and the spies spooning on the couch.
“I’m so sorry, Thor.” The Asgardian nods solemnly at that, his eyes grateful for Tony’s comfort even though the genius can make out the dark haze of grief in his expression.
Tony just rolls his eyes. “Well Barton showed up drunk at 3 a.m. and ate all my PopTarts so this is considerably better. I’m not gonna make you leave just to make you haul your ass back through Manhattan traffic later.”
“I mean, I know you only said you wanted to hang around for a few days, but you’re welcome to stay as long as you want. I mean Clint and Natasha basically moved in already so-” the billionaire shrugs, “It’d be nice to have someone around who doesn’t look at me like I’m speaking in tongues when I try to explain just how cool my new inertial dampeners are.”
The AI doesn’t reply immediately. “I am… unsure, sir. It seems to be a localized meteorological event, but I’m finding no reports of it throughout the city.”
Avengers tower. And you are an Avenger. For some reason, I honestly cannot fathom," the archer grumbles at that, but Tony shushes him with a comforting pat to his head.  "But you do have a whole floor that I’m never going to use because I pretty much exclusively inhabit the workshop and the kitchen soo-” he trails off as the other man stares. “Yeah, man. You can stay if you want to. It gets kinda-,” he sighs looking for the right way to phrase it, one that’s slightly less pathetic. He pauses a second and bites the bullet. “Lonely. It gets lonely what with Pepper gone for SI and Happy’s down in Malibu being her forehead of security and Rhodey’s always in some desert somewhere hunting terrorists or whatever so,” he pauses, clears his throat a bit. “Yeah, I’d like it if you stuck around a while.” There’s an awkward pause that’s broken when Clint throws his arms around his neck, sloppy and reeking of booze. The genius stiffens for a second, he doesn’t get touched like this very often but he gingerly raises his arms to wrap them around his teammate.
Sure, New York is fine and Pepper loves dragging him to Broadway on Friday nights, but Malibu has been his home for a very long time. He’d chosen the sunny California city as the new headquarters of Stark Industries three weeks after his parents died and he couldn’t stand the suffocating emptiness of the Stark Mansion a second longer. Instead he founded a new headquarters in the sun and built his dream home into the side of cliff where he could hear waves breaking on the rocks below as he stared up at his ceiling night after sleepless night. Stark Tower was beautiful, sleek and modern, everything he’d wanted it to be, but nothing could compare to the comfort and safety of his workshop, his bots flitting around him as he revolutionized the future of technology. Or, more accurately, invented a sentient toaster because he’d maybe dranken a little too much of his emergency workshop scotch. Regardless, Malibu was
of fungus exactly?” He furrows his brow as he listens to the person on the other end and his face twists in alarm. “What do you mean he’s
Tony successfully stifles his laugh at the confession, but Clint’s an asshole because he starts guffawing and snorting behind him. Thankfully, there’s a thump and a crash as the archer lets out an indignant squawk and Tony makes a mental note to buy Natasha something nice. Or maybe he’ll design her some of that hallucinogenic lipstick River Song’s always using on hapless guards in Doctor Who. His mind immediately starts suggesting an entire line of deadly lipsticks and he wonders if maybe that’s something SI should put on the market. Though, he guesses Pepper would probably shoot that down, because of liability or whatever. His mind’s still suggesting chemical formulas in ten shades of fabulous when he turns his attention back to Thor and gives his shoulder another comforting squeeze.
importantly, why the fuck are you desecrating my PopTarts in my own goddamn house?” Honestly, he's primarily amused.  He hasn’t seen anyone in the last couple days so a little company isn’t exactly unwelcome.  On the other hand, he can’t quite fathom why Clint has decided to a) break into his house and b) rip open every box of PopTarts and then proceed to bury himself in them.
The rest of the team starts filtering into Avengers Tower a month after SHIELD falls. Clint shows up first, which surprises Tony initially, but as he gets to know the archer better he’s simply surprised he hadn’t found the assassin snuggled up in the Tower vents with all Tony’s blankets one day.
“Oh darling. Why didn’t you tell me how you felt. You give the warm fuzzies in all my favorite places.”
“Thanks, Tony. That really means,” Hawkeye trails off and clutches tighter. “Just thanks. Thank you.” The other man pulls back a little so he look him in the face and confusion and that warm, gooey feeling from Tony’s gut earlier is echoed back in the blonde’s face. “They were wrong about you, you know.” He says this softly, almost to himself, leaning back on his heels unsteadily and Tony is way too sober to have a heart to heart with a drunk off his ass assassin, but he can’t help voicing the question.
“Thank you, friend Anthony. I do believe Lady Darcy was correct when she told me my shield brothers would lift this weight from my chest.”
“Hey Jarvis. Pull up the blueprints for floors 56 through 62. And find a good contractor. I know some people that are going to need a guest room for a while.”
Steve turns a little pink at that, “Sorry, didn’t realize it was so early. Serum makes it hard to sleep sometimes.” He shrugs a little, embarrassed. “I can come back later if you want.”
Tony simply raises an eyebrow at him, “Because she is useful. You are a grown man who eats Lucky Charms on my couch in the middle of the day.”
“Jesus, Rogers you can’t go around lurking in my kitchen like that. I’ve got a heart condition you know.” Tony’s eyes slowly adjust to the dim light of the city filtering into the kitchen and as he squints into the darkness he can make out the familiar form of Steve Rogers at his kitchen table, sitting somewhat hunched over the surface.
“You’ll find him, Steve. I know you will,” he says it to comfort him, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t believe it. “I can ask JARVIS to help out if you’d like. He can’t punch HYDRA dickheads quite like you can, but he does have access to a possibly illegal amount of satellites.” At that, the tightness goes out of Steve’s smile and morphs into something more relaxed and true.
He has JARVIS direct Thor to his room (he’s preemptively stocked the closets with some Earth clothes for the god should he ever decide to ditch the alien get up) and orders his AI to compile a list of sappy romances and order a ludicrous amount of ice cream.
“I never knew it until I met Stark here but in the last seven days I have discovered that apparently I’m a gold-digger and will flatter this man until he agrees to a) let me borrow one of his ludicrously expensive cars or b) makes me new things I can make explode on the bad guys.”
“Yeah, it- it hurt like…” he sighs, tries to find the words and decides there aren’t any to describe those jagged glass memories of saws in his chest, “It hurt like someone was tearing me apart from the inside. I thought-” he gulps, “I thought they were tearing my heart out, at first, and I couldn’t even breathe enough to scream.  And- well, it never stopped hurting. The reactor it- I designed it over and over again, but it always hurt, hurt my lungs and my chest and my ribs and I thought the pain would go away when it was out, but-” he lets out a harsh breath and presses an unsteady hand to the mottled scar tissue painting his sternum, “I still feel it sometimes. And I know it’s not real, it’s just in my head, but I feel it, like I can’t breathe again, like, like- they’re tearing me open again. I let them take it out.  I never wanted to be in an operating room again- but, I let them take it out.  And I thought the pain would go away, but it didn’t. And now instead of a medical technological marvel in my chest, I’ve just got all this ugliness ruining Adonis-like chest.”
The room’s awkwardly silent at that. They’d been fighting off the trickster god’s alien invasion just a few months ago after all. He knows for a fact that Clint’s certainly not a big fan. But, Tony can be the better man here; after Obadiah he knows what it’s like to mourn for someone who’s betrayed you. So Tony’s the one who breaks the silence, bringing a comforting hand to Thor’s shoulder.
So he’s exhausted, but he lets Tony deal him in and coach him through the finer rules of Texas Hold’em. They eat entirely too much Chinese food and they’re all laughing as they drink and watch Clint make increasingly ludicrous bluffs as he gets drunker and drunker.
, with all the shit we do and everything. But, I don’t know, man. I really, really liked her and I thought maybe she could actually handle, well, me and all the shit I do,
Clint’s howling with laughter and Tony can make out the sound of Natasha snorting in the background.
Bruce laughs and looks around the space, the home Tony built with him in mind, and he smiles over at his friend.
“Yeah, well they do. And, instead, of those ass crackers the Catholics use they just raid your pantry for seven fucking boxes of the same disgusting fucking flavor.”
“I’m sorry, buddy. You’re having a rough week aren’t you?” He successfully contains his snicker, because, while it is admittedly pretty damn funny that a 1,500 year old god is standing in his living room sulking after his first breakup, he likes to think he knows when to lay off the teasing and just be a good friend. Though, Rhodey would probably disagree with that. In his defense though, the good Colonel thinks he’s found “the one” every six months and it’s kind of hard to muster up too much sympathy when he shows up on Tony’s doorstep puppy-dog eyed and whining about the latest succubus to break his heart.
Whereas, about thirty seconds before he was disgruntled about finding a drunk archer on his floor, now his heart floods with some warm, sticky sensation he would almost dub affection if that weren’t so irrevocably out of his emotional repertoire. As it is, he feels himself soften to the archer and he walks over to take a spot on the floor next to the drunk man.
He lets out a laugh, the sound disbelieving and wet at the edges. But Steve just shakes his head and presses his hand tighter, fingers twining with the engineer’s to rest gentle against the scarred flesh. “Your scars are beautiful, Tony. Just like the rest of you, but even more so,” he lifts his hand from the engineer’s knee, to press it against his cheek and Tony blames his sleep-muffled mind for the way he leans into the touch. “Because you survived. You survived all that, you lived through that pain and you just got stronger. You looked in the face of evil and you didn’t run. And, trust me, I’ve seen it my whole life; most men they face that evil, they stare it down and they run for the hills. But, you-” he pauses, eyes twinkling in the dark with earnestness, “you built yourself an armor and you fought. You fought like hell, so no one else would ever have to face it again. And that’s what those scars are. All your strength. All your bravery and your fight. Everything that makes you a hero, painted on your skin. I saw it when you flew through that portal and I see it now. And that’s beautiful. You’re beautiful, Tony.”
The AI’s right, rain patters against the windows now and Tony can’t choke back the laughter that bursts from his chest. Clint and Natasha both shoot him confused glares, but Bruce seems to get it because he gives him a wry grin.
person or store or whatever in the entirety of New York who has PopTarts for you to desecrate and then
He moves in officially a couple days later and he doesn’t miss the smile Tony gives him as he helps pile boxes into the elevator.
It’s an hour later that Tony gives up on cooking breakfast ever again, because everyone’s giggling and dripping breakfast condiments all over his floor and Steve’s scolding him about wasting food with a twinkle in his eye.  So he smiles and orders waffles and when they all trudge into the common room, freshly showered and dressed in clean pajamas for breakfast, it’s declared a lazy day for the sake of Steve bonding time.
The next morning a hungover Tony gives the radiation expert a tour of his own personal floor, half of which is taken up by Bruce’s private lab and features a heavily reinforced Hulk-out room. When the engineer’s done showing him all the personalized touches to his living space, he turns and gives Bruce an uncharacteristically shy smile.
“Bullshit, Stark!” Hawkeye’s yelling as he slaps his cards on the table and Tony’s laughing as he pulls the pool of chips in the center of the table towards himself.
PopTart flavor for just a second and try and get an explanation as to what you’re doing here drunk at three a.m. on a Tuesday, Katniss?”
“And you couldn’t have, I don’t know, waited until the rest of the world was awake to announce you’re my new roommate?”
They all watch the rom-com in companionable silence, Bruce occasionally pointing out medical inaccuracies and Tony snarking at particularly bad lines of cheesy early 2000’s dialogue. An hour in Bruce nods off, head lolling on Thor’s shoulder as the demigod gives him a soft, secret smile. Barton lets out a soft snore from Natasha’s lap and Tony rolls his eyes. His teammates are all sleeping on the couch like a bunch of kids at a sleepover. Instead of waking them up to go to their own beds, he pulls his blanket tight as he stretches languid and cat like on the sofa. His eyes flutter closed as he thinks he should go back to his own bed at least. He’s too old for sleepovers, though now that he thinks about it, he’s not sure he’s ever actually had a sleepover except in the most adult sense of the word. Instead of moving, he gives one last glance to the loveseat where Thor spreads out across the small couch and then shifts Bruce to hold him against his chest and the god’s eyes shut tight as the scientist lets out a soft sigh against the Mjolnir shirt.
The archer cracks his eyes open wider than that. “Even though I desecrated your PopTarts?” he sounds sad as he slurs out the question, as if he’d thought Tony was only approaching to throw him out the door.
The doctor laughs at that and shakes his head. “Um, it’s been awhile. I really doubt I’ll be taking anyone’s money if you deal me in. I should just get to bed, really,” he shuffles awkwardly and Tony scoffs and grabs his wrist to drag him over to the coffee table.
When he looks back at the man, he looks a bit shocked. “So I can, like, stay here?” he sounds bewildered as if he fully expected Tony to send his ass packing.
The sun’s starting to come up, painting the sky soft pinks and tangerines with the first stained glass light of morning. It lights up Steve’s face, settling a halo of golden light through the floss of his hair and Tony feels his breathe freeze in his chest for a moment before he catches himself.
Natasha smirks, “I think he’s onto you, Barton.” She then turns a more sincere smile towards Stark. “So boss, what’s this Barton tells me about a private gym on my floor.”
They argue for five minutes straight over the best rom-com for a broken heart and eventually come to an agreement when Natasha strangely suggests
The engineer smiles around his coffee cup in the warm light streaming through the windows. “Deal, Widow. Beat up Robin Hood for me if he tries to buy My Little Pony on my account again and I will show you to your floor.”
It certainly doesn’t help when Pepper turns down his offer to move to New York with him with a sad smile. He understands, when she’s crying and telling him it’s too much and she can’t handle the nightmares and knowing the next time he puts that suit on he might never come back. He’s expecting it when she sadly tells him she can’t make him choose between being a superhero and being
Tony just shrugs. “Hey, man, I mean it. Loki was a bag of cats when I met him, but I bet if I met him on a day when he wasn’t trying to invade my planet we probably would’ve gotten along. We would’ve pranked the shit out of Clint, you know.”
time I walk into that med lab of yours? That’s fucking right Jerry! Repeat after me--Stark Industries will not, and
“Whoa there, big guy!” he laughs, grimacing a bit at the soaking wet clothes wetting his front. Thor gently sets him back on his feet, before pulling back to give the engineer a wide, toothy smile. “What are you doing here, buddy? I thought you were guarding Loki back in Asgard.”
Tony responds with a mock offended face, “Oh, god Barton I never knew you were just using me for my money and sick SHIELD prototypes. Except, yeah, you showed up one night because you were too broke for a three-dollar box of PopTarts and ended up never leaving because you decided you wanted to make JARVIS sneak all your snacks onto my grocery list. So, yes, Merida I realize that you are a terrible, terrible platonic gold-digger, who wants to eat me out of penthouse and home. Who then invited over another couch-surfer secret spy friend over for a super secret spy sleepover, so they could eat all my food again.”
do, and I guess she really couldn’t. Or maybe she could handle the Avengers and she just couldn’t handle
Steve just smirks at him and shrugs, “That’s alright. I’ll have plenty of time to convince you while we’re looking for Bucky.”
So the truth falls out of him. Too much, too honest and raw, but he can’t stop it through the exhausted early morning haze of his brain when his lips fall open.
He doesn’t turn on the lights when he makes his way into the kitchen, just sets about making a pot of coffee, eyes drooping closed as he shuffles around in the dark. He doesn’t notice the man sitting at the kitchen table in the dark until he clears his throat softly.
When Steve finally shows up it’s only five days after their impromptu sleepover (though Thor has been in much better spirits the last couple days, if Tony does say so himself).
your PopTarts, Stark. These are unholy abominations under God. Cherry, man, seriously? You have seven boxes of PopTarts and they’re all the same terrible flavor. Desecrating,” he scoffs. “I could use these as the Eucharist for a Satanic first communion and they’d still be just as abominable as when I started.”
Tony can’t help the loud bark of laughter that escapes his throat as the archer has the decency to look a bit ashamed of the words that just left his mouth.
And no one would blame him for the way he smiles as he falls asleep that night, replaying the earnest blue of Steve’s eyes as he called him beautiful.
Bruce smiles over at the archer as Tony rolls his eyes, before calling back over his shoulder, “It’s not my fault you suck at poker, Barton,” he turns back to Bruce with a twinkle in this eye though. “You really should play, green machine. You’re too nice, which means you’ll be able to bluff Nat out of all her money before she knows what hit her.”
“Shit!” Tony jumps and swivels around, grabbing the first thing he finds on the counter to use as a weapon and brandishing it defensively in front of him.
“Friends! Shield brothers!” he booms as he strides across the floor to Tony, dropping his hammer to the floor so he can scoop the engineer up in a vice-tight hug.
“You look nice, Thor,” Bruce says quietly from the couch and Tony lifts an eyebrow as Thor turns a soft shade of pink. Huh, he thinks. Well that’s not what he expected. Bruce has a crush the god apparently seems to reciprocate. Maybe he’ll rope Nat into playing matchmaker with him.
Not that the archer has any right to judge, because Tony sees how fast he snatches up the Black Widow Cherry, even though the red-head chooses Stark Raving Hazelnuts over the Bullseye Brownie. Which is how Tony ends up with Captain Americone, making some gleefully immature mind part of his mind point out he’s basically eating Steve Rogers. And while Captain Righteous makes him want to punch him in perfect teeth sometimes, he can also admit that when Roger’s can take a step off his high horse he has his charms. In addition to being quite literally a perfect human specimen, he might add. So, yeah, you could say if Tony was given the chance he would
, which I get, I’m” he gestures at himself and makes a face eyes squeezed shut. He sighs and cuts off.
Tony can’t help but laugh at that but he’s not alone, the rest of their friends join in as Thor’s face furrows in confusion.
“Could you please block charges for any Amazon orders Clint made on my account in say oh, the last three days?” He turns and sticks his tongue out at the archer who simply looks horrified, and Natasha shakes with silent laughter.
“I’m a master assassin too,” the archer whines as he shoves at Tony, who dodges him easily and snickers.
“Everything. You’re supposed to be, I don’t know-,” he rubs at his neck, “like, a total fucking asshole or whatever.”
Instead, he feels warm and safe and much too full of ice cream.  He smiles to himself as he falls asleep; nothing for a broken heart like friends and ice cream.
Tony looks up at that and his face breaks into a brilliant smile. “Brucie-bear! My science bro, how are you?” He pulls himself up and crosses the floor to pull the nuclear scientist into a bone-crushing hug. Bruce wraps his arms around the man and smiles as Tony pulls back.
Tony pulls his hand back and clears his throat (because he’s suddenly feeling hot and he’s starting to think he probably looks as pink as Bruce when Thor calls him ‘fair’). “It’s not a problem. JARVIS is already programmed to search the globe for any signs of enhanced individuals. It shouldn’t be a problem to tweak the algorithm to search for a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier. They tend to get noticed eventually.”
They’re not exactly friends yet, even though Steve has apologized for the fight on the Helicarrier a couple times since. But Tony can’t stop himself from bringing up a comforting hand to the supersoldier’s shoulder reassuringly. Steve glances up a little surprised, before he gives Tony a tight smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
In the moment however, it’s rather disconcerting finding Hawkeye drunk on his pantry floor at three a.m. on a Tuesday. He hears noise in the kitchen, and goes to investigate, snatching up a rolling pin on the way. While, he's more than confident JARVIS would alert him to an intruder, he’s been kidnapped just an
Which is how the team finds them, an hour later, Tony gleefully lobbing eggs at  Steve as the captain returns fire with tomatoes.
The soldier chuckles and scolds him about proper diet for a growing team--Tony can’t suppress his eye roll, as if those giants need to grow even more--but, acquiesces to a healthier option.
“Oh great. Is this like some new torture method Fury’s working on? Every week a new SHIELD agent shows up to get Fruit Loops in my couch.”
can stay as long as she wants,” Tony chuckles making his way to the kitchen to brew his first pot of coffee. “I’m not too sure about you, birdbrain.” He’s pleasantly surprised to find a fresh, steaming pot already brewed with his favorite mug waiting next to it. He pours a cup black, spoons in what is probably an unhealthy amount of sugar and makes his way back over to the couch to join the two super spies. “Thanks for the coffee whoever.”
“Yes, I will ever so kindly ensure you don’t die on my pantry floor even if you desecrate every last goddamn pastry in this entire tower,” Tony chuckles. “But you might want to go to your bedroom on your floor so you can sleep all this,” he gestures vaguely to Clint, “off.”
So after the Mandarin and the surgery and digging his bots out of the rubble of his home, he arrives in New York, alone. It’s only then that he finally manages to get caught up with the news and he stands in still horror when he watches the footage of the Helicarrier plunging into the Potomac. He gives Steve a call, only to informed by a kind nurse that he’s in the hospital, that he’s stable and she’ll have the super soldier give him a call when he’s conscious. Natasha, Clint, Steve--all SHIELD agents--and he feels cool dread pool in his stomach as he hopes that they all made it safely off that flying deathtrap before it plunged into the river. Instead of giving into the fluttering panic rushing through his veins, he goes to the workshop.
And Tony likes that. The promise of more time with Steve in the warm sanctuary of his lab. So he shakes his head and smiles.
“That would be great! I mean-,” he tampers his enthusiasm somewhat, seemingly remembering his forties’ manners, “If it’s not too much trouble. That would be real swell of you, Tony.” His smile’s still soft and sweet, like the one from before when he’d seemed surprised Tony would make him coffee. The soft pink bow of his lips and the flash of perfect white teeth in the dark makes something in the engineer’s stomach do a flip.
He swears he sees Steve make a guilty expression in the dark, but the coffee maker lets out a soft beep letting him know it’s ready and he turns to make himself a cup.
“Nah, you’re more like the passable assassin. Junior-Varsity assassin? I don’t know Nat, what kind of man-killer is birdbrain over here?” He’s smirking as he lifts a glass of scotch to his lips and Clint shoves him successfully this time, sloshing alcohol down the billionaire’s grease-stained tee as the dark haired man lets out an indignant squak.
. They settle in, covered in fuzzy blankets (sue him; he likes to be warm), Ben & Jerry’s in hand.  Tony can't help but make note of how Thor chooses the
amount at this point. And as much as Tony Stark enjoys some light bondage and spanking, he is considerably less into it when it's terrorists and criminals wielding the zip-ties. Not that he would ever use zip-ties on someone--he’s not a sadist--no, he owns a lovely collection of fuzzy handcuffs and silk ties for that purpose, thank you very much.
Tony rolls his eyes as he takes a sip of his coffee and Nat laughs. “Jesus, Clint, was Laura so bad you’re trying to get into Stark’s pants now?”
“--you’ll get your geriatric behind tossed in the can for statutory,” Steve retorted, and then sighed. “Area clear of civilians. Hawkeye, maybe try a sonic arrow. Widow, let’s get SHIELD’s containment unit closer. Iron Man, you know dealing with fans with a pain in the ass.”
When he came back to himself, Steve had moved about twelve inches to the left, and settled face down into the mattress, totally wiped. Tony sympathized. He turned to look at him, only to find Steve was watching him already. His eyes were heavy, and there was a strange look on his face, an absent, curious expression.
It was the silence that broke him — Tony openeed his mouth before his brain could stop him, said, “I wouldn’t have— I wasn’t planning to—” He sucked in an unsteady breath. Go for broke, said the very very stupid voice in his head, and Tony said, “It’s you. It’s only you, Steve. There’s nobody else, not for me, you might as well—” know the truth, he tried to say, but between one breath and the next, Steve strode up to him, caught the base of his skull with a grip tighter than death, slotted their open mouths together, and his touch obliterated the rest of the world.
is an open bar too, sweetheart,” Tony teased, but Steve flushed a little more, saying, “We’re gonna— we’re gonna ignore that,” signalling the bartender over. “What are you drinking?”
The contact photo was flashing on his screen — Marissa Gold, Drubaker and Gold — and, shit, shit, Marissa was who had been planning to take with him to the charity auction tonight, on account of how they both had been invited anyway, and she was sarcastic and fun and conveniently gay, not that too many people were aware of that last fact.
“A peacekeeping force, or so the ambassador tells me,” Tony managed to reply, and then George was looking up with some alarm, and a hand was slapping Tony in the shoulder, and a too-familiar voice was saying, “Tony! There you are!”
“Hey,” Tony said, and suddenly this was— this was excruciating. It wasn't like Steve liked him, not even a little; you could fuck someone and still loathe them, Tony knew that better than anyone, had learned that lesson the hard way more than once.
Tony could feel the way his heart rate flew, the incandescent rage pouring off his skin. His smirk died. “Do you see me fucking laughing, Rogers?”
Tony looked up from his StarkPad, and found Steve looking down at him, smiling and golden, and a little bit mussed, a square-cut crystal tumbler of what looked like whiskey in his hand.
Tony bucked against him, clutched those impossible shoulders, whispered, “Fuck, oh fuck, Steve, baby, you have to— you need to stop—”
Steve's expression shuttered then, sudden and hard, the crack of it almost audible. “I’m sure you will,” he had said softly, and that was that, that was the end of it, Steve had walked out of the door with nothing else left to say, and Tony had fought to remain standing.
“Hey, yourself,” he said carefully. It wasn’t like Steve to come looking for him. He wondered what this was about.
Steve was too tall for the usual thing, the grabbing-by-the-neck, and the softly murmured dirty talk, the lazy kissing in the backseat of a limo, maybe some champagne and some moonlight to help things along. And besides, Tony didn't think the usual thing would work on Steve anyway. It wasn't that they knew each other that well, because they didn't, but there was something about fighting side-by-side surrounded by giant radioactive penguin bots in Central Park, that fine-tuned your ability to see past the bullshit.
“I had some ideas,” Steve murmured, and their voices were so quiet, even though JARVIS had probably activated the locks, and they had the whole floor to themselves anyway.
Stupid, stupid, you fucking— He wants to leave. Let the man leave in peace, you pathetic, needy idiot.
There were couches out on the deck, near the fire pit, and Tony nudged Steve down next to him, which the good Captain took as invitation to, once more, shove his face into Tony’s neck. Not that Tony minded. The problem was how much Tony
“Figures,” Tony murmured, going back to his phone. Steve meanwhile was leaning farther and farther backward, to take in the last thirty or so floors above them, and the forty foot antenna above that, bending like a goddamn limbo player over the edge of the balcony, and then his foot skidded forward, and—
Come here and find out, Tony wanted to say, but the words had dried up in his throat. He drained the rest of his scotch.
And then TOny felt Steve’s mouth rub against his skin. “Steve?” he asked quietly, trying not to tense up.
“So they’re deploying from Incirlik?” George asked Tony, who nodded, setting his phone down on the bartop, and pulling up a holodisplay of the globe, zooming in on Kazakhstan, the vast barren stretch north of Lake Balkash where the cold, barren taiga bled into cold, barren desert.
Tony had secreted himself away on the upper walkway that wrapped around the split-level living room slash common area where somebody had had the godforsaken bright idea to blast Party Rock on full — which, considering the quality of Tony’s sound system, was… a lot. He was pretty sure Clint and Darcy were teaching Thor how to grind, like the resident Bad Influences they were.
Tony smirked. It didn't quite reach his eyes. “Cat got your tongue, sweetheart?” A beat. “Sorry, that too much for you? Man, I really need to put you in a room with Rumsfeld and Cheney, don't I. Who would've thought.”
There had been a couple of Cap fans in the line of fire, when the giant, malfunctioning penguin robots came climbing out the storm drains in Central Park, was how it started. Three idiot kids, too overwhelmed seeing their idol to actually get with the program and run away screaming like everyone else, and Hawkeye had alerted Cap about them loitering near the carousel. Predictably, Steve had charged in, herded them out of the way, except that was when one of the kids swooped in and—
Oh, he thought blankly, with a little throb of heat unspooling all through his chest, and then that voice in his head was talking again, that hellraiser Tony thought he had buried at seventeen, the one that had carried him through his parents’ death and Afghanistan, through the Bruce's disappearance and Obie’s betrayal, through a hole in the sky above New York, to the other end of the universe.
“Holy fuck,” Tony mumbled, while a chorus of angels and the London Philharmonic started a symphonic orchestra in his head, because holy fuck, Steve was big.
Tony watched him, the sloe-eyed gaze, the half-unbuttoned shirt, the faint sheen of sweat and bad decisions. “So,” he said quietly, because this wasn’t the kind of question you yelled at an Oscars’ afterparty, “why did you
“Maybe we should be putting you in bed, huh?” Tony tried carefully. His heart was starting to pound a little.
Steve made this sound, this choked groan that felt like it had been wrenched out of him, and stilled, hips thrusting erratically, before spurting come all over Tony’s fist, over his t-shirt, drenching him in come, and Tony could smell it, could practically taste it, could feel the sweat dripping off of Steve’s forehead and onto his neck, and that was it, that was all it took. Tony dig his fingers into those rippling, beautiful quads, fucked that straining muscle, felt Steve lick a slow, torturous line up his neck, and he was coming too, with a barely restrained cry, hips arching off the bed like an overeager teenager instead of a grown man, stars going nova behind his eyelids, coming so hard he practically blacked out from it.
“The—” Steve glared down at Tony. There was a pale pink flush banding over his cheekbones. “Don't play dumb, Stark. It doesn't suit you.”
And sure, there was a conversation they could've had right then, about how that almost certainly qualified as assault. But Clint had wolf-whistled over comms like the actual grade-schooler he was, and everybody had gotten a brief, breathless laugh out of it, pumped up on adrenaline, while Tony firebombed the stupid waddling bots, trying to stop them before they got to the damn zoo, and stepped on the actual, stinkingpenguins.
“How the fuck do you taste so good?” Tony demanded, and realized the thing his calves had bumped up against was his bed, there had been a bed this whole time.
“Marissa canceled actually,” Tony blurted, which was a lie, a lie, he’d asked Marissa if she wouldn’t mind going stag, because Tony had— had conjured up some bizarre, ridiculous fantasy of asking Steve to come with him, what the hell, what had he been thinking, and his eyes slid shut in pure defense.
And Tony rolled his eyes, and pasted on a smirk that would've fooled God and St. Paul. “Relax, Cap. It’s a big party. I’ll find some company.”
Of course, Tony thought deliriously, kissing back just as soft and dark and wanting, of course Captain America was a faceholder, of course he did incredibly sappy things like that, just to fuck with Tony’s understanding of the laws of the universe. His calves bumped into something, and Tony made a soft, confused sound into that mouth, and Steve took the moment to slide his tongue in, hot and silken and hungry. Their kissing was growing rougher, out of control, Tony could feel his knees start to buckle, could feel the hot, hard stroke of Steve’s hands along his back, clutching his nape, hungrily palming his ass. He shifted a litttle, notched their hips together, and then pulled their mouths apart on a soundless inhale. God, he could feel it, his cock slotting against Steve’s, against the hard, firm bulge of it, unhampered by the sweats. But Steve had barely been interrupted, had moved to Tony’s jaw, to his neck, was biting a hungry noise into his throat.
“No,” Steve said. The frown had not quite gone away, and his hands were cupping Tony’s jaw, gripping his shoulder, and Tony was only just realizing that at some point he had curled his own hands low around Steve’s waist, probably to steady him, he couldn’t even remember.
“You don't look too cut up about it.” Steve’s voice was a rich low murmur, and now Tony could feel the slow drag of his gaze, touching his bare skin like a physical caress.
“Because I’m—” Steve was squinting down at him, like some kind of awful ‘09 internet meme about small, confused puppies. Tony wanted to fling himself off the top of the Empire State. “Wait, you really didn't know.”
The rest of the day passes in a blur, that brief interaction with Toni occupying so much of his attention that he makes absolutely no headway on his work. And it isn’t until he’s in bed, half-asleep, that he realizes that he hardly even thought of Peggy.
The days tick by, my chief officers and directors all give me various shakedowns that always make me feel like absolute shit, like it’s somehow my fault that I got kidnapped. Thousands of people have their livelihood at stake thanks to the Ten Rings. Apparently, me being around being a pain in the ass is just enough to keep our shares steady.
Thank you to those who took a chance on my fic, i know i disappointed and i'm sorry. Here's to getting better at writing.
We stare at each other, the air between us thick with tension that had never existed before my damned kidnapping.
Humming to myself, I tap my now empty mug with my index finger as I walk towards the exit. When I pass by Steve, I mouth ‘later’ to him. He’s got his concentration face on, a small furrow between his brows, but he gives me a responding nod at least.
“It wasn’t you who sold the weapons to the terrorists that did it.” He takes one of my hands in both of his. “I know you feel like it’s your responsibility, but it’s not. You thought you were doing something for the good of the country, hell, we both did. We have to live with the consequences of our actions but don’t take on more than is your due.”
My toes are still mangled and hurt like fucking hell when I take steps, but I can work through it. As soon as everything is good to go, I aim at the door and blast it to high hell. Immediately, I hear a siren. I look at Yinsen through the gaps of my faceplate.
“Once they have the primary schematics down and I have a chance to look over them, we should be able to produce 10 of the same high-tech prosthetics and at least 3 different varieties. So that’s around 30, give or take.” I look at them in the eye. “I also want you to understand that this is taking in account per person. If one person is missing three limbs, then that goes into the count. That’s as much as I can offer without compromising on quality.”
“Tony,” Steve murmured. His voice was low, a rough, gravelly scrape Tony had never heard before, and it went straight to his cock, curled fresh lines of heat through his veins.
He wrapped his hand around the head of his cock, thumb under the head, and wow, wow, okay, apparently this was a two-hand job, except for how Steve had closed his eyes, braced above Tony, and his hips were rutting forward, fucking into the tight clasp of his fingers, the head wet and shiny and Tony had never wanted anything in his mouth quite as badly as— “Yeah, that's it baby, come on,” Tony was saying, nonsense words, his own cock begging, aching for release, he was humping Steve’s thigh like a mentally deficient labradoodle, watching the wet, hungry thrusts of Steve’s cock, “Christ, I want to see you come, let me see you come, get it all over me, fuck, fuck Steve—”
Steve pulled away almost immediately, said, “What?” in his rough, bewildered voice, and Tony groaned; this time he did grasp the back of Steve's neck, because old habits were impossible to break, and hissed, “Don't actually stop,” right up against his mouth, before kissing him again, fucking that gorgeous mouth with his tongue, biting into those lips, until they were both sore and slick, messy with it. He tasted so good, was the thing. He tasted so—
And instead of straightening up, Steve sort of half-melted into him. “Whoops,” he mumbled into Tony’s shoulder.
So it turned out, that day was not the day Tony fucked his teammate and irreparably damaged the Avengers. Instead, it turned out, that was the day Tony helped the surface world establish diplomatic relations with, ah, Atlantis, apparently.
Tony dove in, aiming a repulsor blast directly at the hinges that connected the head to the rounded body. Jesus, these were some ugly fuckin’ bots.
“Well, shit, sweetheart,” Tony said, and his voice wasn't shaking, it wasn't, “if I’d known, they wouldn’t have been jokes, would they.” And then Tony clicked his jaw shut, because holy shit, holy shit, he’d just hit on Captain America, just openly done that, he was going to die, he was three seconds from being murdered, Pepper and Rhodey were going to have their hearts broken all over again—
So, Tony started to say, that was interesting. And then Steve would have said, That’s one word for it, or maybe, Is that what the kids are calling it these days? because he liked to play up the ninety-five year old angle, as if he wasn't actually, horrifyingly the youngest person on their team.
Steve found Tony out on the deck, cellphone in one hand, a glass of scotch in the other, staring out at the sea of lights that was New York City by night, gorgeous and glittering and seemingly endless.
And Steve seemed to breathe in deeply, and everything about him turned sort of hungry and intentional, and he said, “So I could do this,” and leaned in, holding Tony still, and kissed him.
“Right back at you,” Steve replied, and thumbed at his throat, choking his air just enough that Tony’s mouth dropped open, and Steve could kiss him again, and oh, that dirty bastard, was that how they were gonna play it?
Tony’s hand had somehow slipped under that amazingly tight t-shirt, rucked it up. He was stroking smooth, hot skin now, a steady continuous sweep of his thumb, and Steve wasn't stepping away. Wasn't even looking away, actually. His eyes had gone dark, and half-lidded, his lips had parted a fraction of an inch, and the way he looked…
And that sent a bucket of ice water coursing down his spine. It's not right. Tony could feel a sharp tightness draw over his face. “Not right,” he said blandly. “Why, Cap? Can't handle having a faggot on your precious team, is that it? Worried I won’t be able to stop myself from getting my filthy hands on you? No, no, don't worry,” he cut in when Steve’s jaw dropped in surprise, and he stepped into the guy's personal space with a sort of vindictive deliberateness, patted his shoulder, let his hand rest on that hard, defined stretch of muscle for just a second too long. “I’ll try to keep my mouth off your cock. It’ll be hard,” and the Captain looked gobsmacked, like he’d been slapped, and that sent a rush of angry pleasure through Tony, “but I’ll do my best. Anything else?”
Which was just as well. They'd never been very good at words, and Tony heard what Steve hadn't yet said, wouldn't say, not until the next morning, with the air around them quiet and still, dawn's light filtering in past light, linen curtains in a soft wash of gold — “There's nobody else for me either. Nobody but you.”
He had felt it flare up then, that sudden riptide of grief-rage-no, and before he knew it, his hand had coiled into a fist and smashed into the nearest mirror, shattering it into a thousand pieces, a soundless roar escaping his throat, his mind a blissful haze of pain, and nothing else.
Tony found the Captain in his bedroom, ostensibly waiting for him — which, you know, was very much not the usual. Steve didn't seek Tony out, not unless it was on Avengers business, and they’d just gotten through with a mission debrief from SHIELD, so that was out. Steve wasn't in uniform either, just sweatpants and one of those criminally tight t-shirts, the kind they didn't even make pornstars wear because they probably cut off circulation or something, and — and fuck, Tony had been staring too long, hadn't he?
“Oh Cap,” Tony drawled, and that hot low drag in his voice was of course totally inappropriate for a commlink open to all the rest of the Avengers, unless you were Tony Stark and had gotten rid of things like Modesty and Personal Shame back in the 90s when you were railing down enough lines of cocaine to form a Black Diamond slope. “If the sex is a pain in the ass, he ain't doin’ you right, baby.”
Tony blinked while his brain tried to reboot. What the fuck was Steve talking about. “What kind of talk?”
It's just that he had so completely not seen it coming, hadn't believed something like that could happen, which was how this kid, this teenage boy, blue-eyed and dakr-haired and skinny as a reed, ended up having more than enough time to lean over and land a smacker full on Cap’s astonished mouth, before scampering away with his buddies.
“Yeah,” Steve mumbled into the curve of his neck, and Tony found the elastic band of his pants, shoved them down hard when the fabric caught agaisnt the head of Steve’s cock, and oh sweet God, apparently the man had gone commando underneath, because it was suddenly his cock that Tony could see, hard and thickly veined and listing slightly to the left, and shit, shit—
“It’s an open bar, Steve.” He went back to the refugee crisis in Central Asia. “An open bar, incidentally, that I’m paying for, so if anyone’s buyin’ anyone a drink…”
George tapped his shoulder, the one Steve hadn’t already invaded and occupied. “Hey,” he said quietly, “I’m gonna give you guys a little space.”
“I thought I just did,” Tony replied, more than a little hoarse. Steve’s eyes were blue points of fire, dark and intent, and they stayed there, balanced on the edge of a blade.
And then it had turned out that Hawkeye’s sonics did disable the stupid bots, and Tony had configured his suit to emit the frequency on blast, using Cap’s shield as an amplifier, and everyone had forgotten about his stupid quip.
Tony set the glass down, and balanced his elbows back against the balcony’s railing, hips tilted forward. He knew what he looked like.
Steve was sitting up, when Tony came back in, sweatpants back in place, texting someone on his phone.
Bucky kept giving him pep talks whenever they were alone together, words of encouragement when training, thumbs-ups in the halls... Steve had to admit, it was helping, but not much, and there were only so many times you could hear 'You've got this buddy,' before you felt like punching something.
The Captain part of him wanted to be proud, his team were all working together to achieve a common goal. The Steve part of him, however, was
Steve swallows, straightening up "N-no, I'm fine, Tony," he says, somehow managing a reassuring smile. "Just a headache, I'll be fine after I've slept."
Tony hums against his lips. "Let me think..." he murmurs, looking off at the side with a thoughtful expression. "Uhhh nope," he declares cheerily, grinning.
Tony steps a bit closer to him, almost brushing up against him, "Well Steve, you know what they say about assuming things..." he says quietly "But there's really no need to assume because I can assure you," He leans up to whisper in Steve's ear, "I am
Steve closes his eyes, hanging his head. "They're just trying to be helpful," he mutters, and he's not sure if he's assuring Tony or himself of that. He opens his eyes but keeps them fixed on his shoes. "In their own way..."
Steve jumps, his head snapping up and eyes locking with Bucky's, who was sitting solemnly in his armchair, gazing at him with concern.
Carefully, he lowers Tony onto the bed, shaking his head at him in disbelief. Tony had been in the lab sixty-seven hours, and Steve had been beginning to wonder if he was ever to re-surface. How the man does this shit all the time and still remains functional was beyond him.
Tony's brow furrows, the brunet walking the last few strides up to him. Steve could smell his aftershave. "Steve, you've all been really weird these last couple of months. Clint keeps giving you cookies and breaking your equipment, Thor's been stocking the pantry with Asgardian mead, Bruce has been kicking me out of the lab because I don't 'talk to the team enough'." He rolls his eyes at that. "Nat has been shockingly behaved and that in and of itself is concerning..." he trails off with a tsk. His eyes meet Steve's, looking hurt and confused. "Is something going on?"
The first article is a long-winded rant about the perils of allowing a woman to create weapons, cleverly disguised misogyny as journalism, nothing new there. The second is something along the same lines with a dash of judgement on the US military for not having the armor under its control.
A sudden ticking sound halts the blows. The ‘interrogator’ looks around and then glances at a small shiny ball next to his boot. The ticking speeds up and Steve is abruptly struck with the realization.
The chopper must spot me because it turns toward my direction and hovers over the sand. I shield my eyes the best I can and when I see the man who clambers out of the helicopter, I think that I died during my escape and am now in purgatory.
A sudden crackle through the coms. “Hey Captain, we’ve infiltrated the command center. It’s empty.” The synthetic sounding voice is familiar, if unwelcome. He’d told Shield that they had no need for Iron Man at first. But after scouting the base, they’d decided to call him in—completely disregarding Steve’s wishes. “No prisoners and no further hostiles.”
I lean against my desk, clenching my hands behind my back. “You aren’t average Steve.” When things start to get emotional, deflect. Unlike earlier in the day and every other interaction with him, standing here in my lab feels intimate. Especially considering that he’s complimenting me. “But don’t worry, it’s no big deal.”
A sudden scream in the crowd makes the placid shoppers scatter in shock. Steve turns to look and sees Bucky on the ground, unconscious.
“Not necessary, J.” I scrub at my face with my hands. “Ugh, I hate it when I get like this. I’m supposed to just have flings not emotional attachments.”
This chapter was originally much longer but I wasn't sold on the idea of an alternating POV in the same chapter so ... next chapter will be from Toni's POV! The tags were updated (I know i know, again) and i'm kind of thinking of changing the summary because my original idea was just three chapters and now it's kind of huge lmao.
I snarl, finally snatching the sunglasses off my face before glaring at him. “I hate that you’re trying to get under my skin but most of all, I hate that you’ve managed it Agent.” I take a deep breath. “If Fury manages to find a cure, I’ll consider joining. But not one moment before.”
I nod. “You’re brilliant Pep. You’ll do so much better as CEO than as a glorified babysitter for an eccentric billionaire like myself.” I hug my midsection. “And I asked you out because I don’t want to leave things up to chance anymore.”
God, I hadn’t thought this would be so hard. “Sir, Happy is reporting that he is one block away from your location.” Jarvis interrupts my internal pity party.
With his Ma’s words in mind, Steve mingles with a greater ease. He might not be one of the rich, but he’s got his gorgeous wife at his side and his career is finally taking off in the direction that he wanted. Of course, just as he makes peace with the discomfort of being forced to mingle with those living worlds away from his tax bracket, he spots her.
“I—” Her cries become muffled, as if she tries to cover her mouth to cover the noise. His heart lurches in response. “Toni, honey, I want to be there for you. Tell me where you are.”
“Stark, we might have a breakthrough on your problem.” Hope flutters in my chest. “In your father’s things, we have come across a tape that might have the solution.”
“Just peachy.” She laughs, the sound far from humorous. “I gotta go Cap. It was… good to talk to you again.”
He hangs his head, pulling his hand back. Sighing, he moves to the door. He looks back, hand on the doorframe, smilies sadly, and switches the light off, closing the door silently behind him.
The sound of the elevator doors opening brings him out of his thoughts. He sighs, moving to unlock his apartment door.
Steve bites his lip, leaning his shoulder against his door. "They're, uh, t-trying to get me to ask someone out..." he says, rubbing the back is his neck. Smooth, Steve.
Steve gathers up his things. He had been drawing the night-time skyline from Tony's apartment and was definitely
Now was the perfect opportunity. C'mon, Rogers, just say 'Actually Tony, I wanted to talk to you about something.'
He walks into the room, tossing his keys in their bowl and placing his art supplies onto his desk. He slumps down onto his couch, head in his hands.
