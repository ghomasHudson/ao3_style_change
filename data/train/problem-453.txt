"I'm worthy of the Magnus Opus, the doer of the Great Work."
“No, Sherlock, and neither can you. It’s just your imagination.”
“I got sidetracked, with the terrorist case and coming back.”
“My, my, you are in excellent form today Sherlock. Correct again.”
“Close your eyes.”
How this kid was even in this world if his grandparents shared a room with bunk beds was surely a story for another day, and frankly, John was afraid to ask.
Victor poofed at the comment.
“You’ll have to fight Harry on that too, you know. See you later. I’ll check on your husband first. I need to change my clothes. I smell like dirt and death.”
"Thank you."
"That was the year the Chamber of Secrets opened."
“That would be me, then,
“So? What do you think?”
"Yes. After I finish this case, we do whatever you like. I suspect your security detail already have your stuff packed and moved into Cornwall now."
So John paired with Jia, and he had a lot of fun, slicing demons into small pieces with his long sword. He practically fought the whole thing without using magic, but he felt as he loaned his strength and some of his protective magic to Jia. He was a master swordsman, but he also carried a gun, filled with magical bullets that carried ugly curses for demons. But he preferred his sword, because since the gun was his trademark, it was easier for vampires, who decided to join the fight mysteriously late, to identify him. He also had a wonderful crossbow, but that he reserved mostly for vampires who got on his nerves a long time ago. So, not the ideal weapon either.
“Is the emotional matter related to me in any way?”
The first thing John noticed was the colour. It seemed like everything around him glowed, a kind of vague purple hue. He saw Harry and Alissa arriving at the same spot, but everything was different. There were vague purple outlines, a father sitting with his child on the fence, the child laughing. A woman, sitting close to them, oblivious, clutching her belly and crying, two different children pulling weeds in the garden. An old lady in the doorway, touching the closed door. He started to feel a little dizzy. He closed his eyes, and he focused on Sherlock's hand, which he was still holding. The last time, Sherlock had released him as soon as they entered the memory. This time John supposed that since he was the one who kept his hand clasped in the first place, he was the one who had to let go. Well, too bad, Sherlock's hand was the only thing keeping him anchored.
They followed Harry and Alissa into the cottage, they entered a small sitting room, sparsely furnished, with a couple of spellbooks over a worn coffee table. The sitting room opened into a small, empty kitchen. Nobody there. Sherlock and John followed the memory aurors in and out of each place, and he saw the detective taking in every detail, as he usually did during crime scenes. Nothing seemed to merit a deduction, because he stayed silent as they walked out of the first floor. The aurors had their wands out, and they started up the stairs. The first small bedroom was empty, no furniture. In the second room, they found two wizards lying dead on the floor. They were facing up, eyes wide open. Both of them middle-aged, in wizarding robes that seemed well worn, but not tattered or old. Congealed blood on each of their wand arms, with the word 'traitor' crudely etched on them. This room had no furniture either, so it seemed that the cottage was more a hiding place than a living space for the recently deceased wizards. Probably not for a long time, because they didn't seem to have provisions for long-term shelter. Both of them had their wands in their hands, and Harry retrieved them, using Priori Incantatem on both. Both of the tips blurted out the ghost of killing curses. Alissa looked around the room for other possible clues and found the blasting result around the doorway, where the wood was cracked.
“In simple words, yes.”
“Oh, he wants you, trust me. He wants the whole nine yards with you, baby, retirement in the country, the deal.”
One of them touched the body, disapparating with it, and the other two left just after him.
Sherlock ignored Victor’s comment and walked into the flames first, his deep baritone voice enunciating.
John went upstairs to his room and brought Sherlock an old book.
They entered through the fence, and John noticed all the plants in the front garden looked withered and dead. He told Sherlock that, and he nodded.
“Do you use magic to summon the cabs?”
He practically hauled the detective to the sofa, and removed his suit jacket. He probably didn’t remove it before when he passed out because Mycroft came by.
“Do you really want to get involved?”
"He still invites Mycroft regularly to dinner, so he is not my favourite person. His daughter Molly is my brother's goddaughter."
“Seriously? In there? It might fit both of you, quite snugly, but I don’t want to be plastered to strangers for a ride to nowhere, ta very much.”
“Yes, in about five minutes,” John says, relief washing over him. “Thanks a ton.” He disconnects before she can object, then opens his texts, typing
did. But we’ll just – get better from here. Expand our conquest into the daylight hours, too. But there’s no rush. I’m quite content to lie here in your arms all night long.”
A taxi slows in front of them, and Sherlock opens the door and gestures John in first. “We
He’d taken it well, at least. There was no drama, though he’d teared up. She had, too, but there was no regret. Maybe he knew it in his heart, too, that they weren’t meant to be together.
“What are friends for?” Sherlock quips, a bit sardonically.
Sherlock thanks him and sips. “This isn’t half bad,” he allows.
“There!” he hisses. “Sherlock! At one o’clock! Not more than half a kilometre away!”
Sherlock’s gaze doesn’t waver. “Lestrade. Cuff his feet, too.”
He makes a sound of assent, then says, loudly enough for the receptionist to hear him clearly, “They have the
Sherlock shakes his head, still flushed. “You must think – it must sound so juvenile to you. At my age.”
“Not really,” John agrees, and Sherlock untangles himself and gets up, nude, to put the oven mitts on and retrieve the cake. “Is it okay?” John asks, more concerned with Sherlock’s incredible arse than the cake.
John appears to be struggling internally, his frame twitching as he searches for an answer to this. “It’s not about not wanting to… I just can’t, Sherlock,” he says to the back of the sofa, his voice dry.
“Plus Andrea even said that Ian cheated on her multiple times,” John remembers. “Obviously he must have cheated with Chrissy, but I suppose at least one of the others could have been Gabriela.”
“What about me, then?” Mycroft asks, breaking the silence that follows.
John feigns his way through his discomfort well, posing and flexing when told, running his hands down over his chest and turning slowly, his hips undulating a little as he does his circle. Perhaps the massage loosened him up, Sherlock thinks, half-critical and half-admiring. And a little too aroused, too. He forces his thoughts into less stimulating areas and slowly feels his body calm.
He’s stumbling over his words. Sherlock swallows and scrabbles after a response to this. “I want – all of that,” he tries, though it’s unspecific and wholly inadequate. “What goes with – being in bed together,” he clarifies, and it sounds prim and entirely unseductive even to him. Prudish, even.
He’s on his back now, eyes questioning, and John can hardly speak. He’s kneeling between Sherlock’s thighs, goggling at the body on shameless display before him. He feels as though he’d died and gone to heaven, only heaven’s got nothing on this, he thinks. “Just like that,” he says, breathing heavily. “I want to see your face when I’m inside you.”
Ella doesn’t look at the clock, but she smiles. “Same time next week?” she asks.
I get myself upstairs as fast as I can, tear off my clothes and slap at the light switch, getting into bed naked with one hand already wrapped around my cock. I reach for a palmful of lube and go at it, moaning quietly, one hundred percent certain this time that he’s doing the exact same thing below me. I watch him in my mind’s eye, furtively jerking himself off under the cover of his blankets, his beautiful face contorted, breathing hard – the next time it happens, maybe he’ll want to do something about it together, I think, and the thought sends me over the edge, making a mess of my hands and sheets. I lie there, panting, and silently wish him an equally good orgasm. I feel a proprietary pride about it, since I think I can safely allow myself to believe that I directly inspired it. After a bit, I reach for some tissues and clean up the best I can, then roll away from the wet spot, set the alarm on my phone, and go to sleep.
Sherlock? What can he be doing? Has he eaten anything? What is he thinking? When is he going to come back? Is it time to panic yet?
It’s not even three yet when Lestrade releases us, the guilty husband cuffed in the back of the cruiser. We get a taxi, me saying, “Sorry it was only the husband after all. Boring and predictable, I know.”
I feel my mouth purse. “Okay, but – ”
love you,” he says roughly. “I love you to the best of my ability, and I absolutely want to marry you. I just – I just wish you were getting something better. Someone less – fucked up. I feel like damaged goods.”
“I’ll send it over on the double. What time do you need the chopper exactly?” Lestrade asks.
John’s heart immediately shatters for him. He scoots up close behind Sherlock and lets himself do something he never imagined he’d ever allow himself to do, hugging Sherlock close, every part of his body pressing into Sherlock’s. “Not if I’ve got anything to say about it,” he says roughly, and kisses the back of Sherlock’s left shoulder. “I want you to enjoy it, not just – bear it. It’s supposed to be good for you, too, you know.”
Sherlock comes to the edge of the bed and looks down at the two of them, so much there in his eyes that it almost hurts to see. He doesn’t say anything, not asking, just standing there, obviously unsure of his welcome.
To her astonishment, a second boy appears, short and stocky, sandy-haired, following Sherlock toward their imagined pirate attack. He leaps into the fray ahead of Sherlock, charging their foes, and she watches them slashing at the air, shouting to each other. Then Victor turns back and looks at her, seeing her there, and now he’s not Victor, but John Watson. He smiles at her. Vee marvels. He’s real, then. She smiles back at him and nods once, and he turns back to Sherlock, who has also transformed into his adult self, and now he looks at her and smiles, too, as transparently happy as he once was as a child.
Her lips press together, an inward thinking process taking place rapidly, then she musters speech at last, her voice small. “On my back.”
Margaret accepts this, unruffled. “All right,” she says. “What about this theory: are you finding it difficult to accept that Sherlock has forgiven you for any or all of that because you have difficulty forgiving yourself? Could that be it?”
. You have so many more valid reasons to think little of me – I mean, I’m the one who married Mary, who went back to her after everything she did.”
John deposits the bacon in the slow cooker, then comes back to the table, watches him for a moment, snickering, then takes a few sheets of paper towel and joins him. “This is weird,” he says conversationally.
John kisses him, then does it again, then lifts his face. It’s all crowding in on him, everything he feels, how much it means to actually be doing this. It’s worth slowing down to take stock of it for a second. He strokes Sherlock’s forehead and says, “Nothing, Sherlock. Just – let me touch you. I want to see you properly at last, want to make you feel good. Can I do that?”
This last is stiff and more than a little resentful. He steals a look at John, who seems to be breathing with difficulty. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asks heavily. “About the snipers. I thought I was pretty clear the night you came back that I wanted to know why.”
“Only a very stupid one, or a very egotistical one,” John says to Sherlock, ignoring the man.
“I love you,” he says, the accent on the last word very slight.
Sherlock chuckles, to my relief. “I’ve never seen her so astonished,” he says, and goes to the waffle iron to turn the heat down a little. “It’s probably the best way for her to find out, really. It would have been hard to explain it in words.”
“It wasn’t your fault,” John tells him. “None of it was: not Mary’s death, not my reaction to you after, not her ridiculous message – I mean, was she actively
John swallows and cringingly turns his face back to the screen, his shoulders bending inward. After another sixty seconds of it, he interrupts again. “Look, Mycroft, I know what I – turn it off. Please.”
Sherlock lowers his voice and leans over the desk a little. “Are there any other access points?” he asks. “Any roads in and out of there? It’s just that we were thinking about going
Sherlock pulls him closer and slips off the counter so that he can reach John’s arse and pull their pelvises flush together. “Only if you’re in it with me,” he says, voice dropping into the range that makes every hair on John’s body prickle with desire. His cock gets even harder, a wave of arousal sweeping over him.
“No,” Lucas says, his tone short but polite. “I am not a psychopath. Just a businessman.”
, the congratulations are mostly being directed at Sherlock, as though he’s the one who scored, who brought it about. They think that Sherlock fucked him, in other words. And it’s not that that’s a problem, per se, but the implication seems to somehow be that Sherlock got the better of him or something, that the grins are at least very slightly at his expense. To cap it off, Sherlock casually drapes an arm around his shoulders now, and leans in to press his lips briefly to John’s temple.
“That sounds fantastic,” Sherlock says, and John echoes him. “Thanks so much.”
John responds with a deeply appreciative sound into Sherlock’s mouth, then pulls back and says, his voice low, “Yes – anything you want, Sherlock. I’m all yours.”
Sherlock smiles down at his hands, then turns so that he’s lying down on his side, looking up at John from the foot of the bed. “The people hosting made pork tenderloin with roast potatoes and peas.” He makes a face at this last, and John snickers. Typically, the only time Sherlock will voluntarily eat peas is in one very specific thing that John makes and which he professes to love, the peas notwithstanding. “I ate them to be polite. You would have been proud of me. There was also some kind of bland salad to start with, and chocolate mousse after. It was fine. Nothing exciting. That pork tenderloin recipe we tried last month in the slow cooker was better, with the garlic cream gravy. But it was nice.” He glances at John. “The rest was good, too. You were right about the ‘drink’. That
! Yeah, like – like that!”
Their cocktails are served almost so obsequiously that they don’t notice. Sherlock pulls his toward himself but doesn’t drink. “Okay,” he says, his voice still betraying him. “So then – what is it, John?”
” he says again, his forehead creasing. “Sherlock – ”
John thinks his chest may actually explode. “I know that – I know that now,” he corrects himself, having difficulty breathing, speaking. “I know, and – I love you, too. God, Sherlock – so much. I never – I’ve been an idiot and I don’t half deserve you, but now – ”
Sherlock’s hand is on his knee. “Perhaps we should go, if you’re ready,” he says quietly to John, and John nods.
John nods. “Bit of an understatement, yeah.”
“I’ll just –  go up and put her to bed,” he says. He ducks in and kisses Sherlock once more, swiftly. “Don’t you go anywhere. I’ll be right back.”
Sherlock gives him an indulgent smile. “Of course,” he says, and leads him in through the revolving doors.
Sherlock shakes his head, putting his hands on John’s shoulders. “Was I any different, hiding from it in other ways, making myself unreachable and shutting you out? We’ve both had a hand in this, John. I’ve long thought that I had far more to apologise for than you ever have.”
Sherlock feels his face relax. “All right, then. We’ll be back before eleven. Thanks.”
Sherlock types rapidly into his phone. “Hmm. Yes, probably. And I was quite right about the prices, by the way. Well, it’s not as though Corey can’t afford it. Bit steep for you and me, though.”
“Clearly not, given my utter lack of experience apart from the past two nights – and this morning,” Sherlock says. He opens his eyes. “So, about those emails – did you read all of them?”
Sherlock looks at him for a long time, then nods. “All right,” he says, looking off to one side. “I’ve come to learn the value of second chances, myself.”
John like a common whore. He can’t even tell which bit is the most shocking. He’s angry, too, he realises. On so many levels. This place is supposedly hyper-vigilant in its zeal to squash out homosexuality in any form, yet its own former CEO is evidently into all sorts of proclivities that John wonders if the rest of the National Defense of Traditional Marriage Coalition knows anything about. He’s also angry that this creepy old man figured that he was available for hire. It’s alarming that he already suspected that John isn’t entirely straight, that he and Sherlock evidently both aren’t, and that they’re a package deal. Does he just assume that all men who are into men are like that? Is it a generational thing – that when Roy was younger, the only way to get to be with another man was to hire one? Either way, he’s angry, doubly so because of what Roy said about Sherlock. It’s true that Sherlock has a beautiful mouth, and it’s not the first time that John’s treacherous mind has had similar thoughts about it, which makes him feel guilty now. He doesn’t want anyone thinking about Sherlock like that. And ‘throwing him in’, like a two-for-one package, at that. Like Sherlock wasn’t even worth enough to consider ‘hiring’ all on his own.
John nods. “Yeah, okay. Why not.”
“Thank you for everything you did today,” he says, and I smile at him in the mirror.
more. You should know that Sherlock was totally cut up over having to do that to you, when he saved you from those bombs. You made it pretty hard for him and he felt terribly after. Now I’m not so sure that you didn’t deserve it, for this. I’ve got to find him now, and explain. I won’t make you do that, though maybe you should. Just – stay out of our way from now on, all right?”
“What’s what?” I glance at Madam Snoots again, but she’s gone back to her magazine, and Sherlock is bending to look at another label. It’s a black lace-and-net number, a bra. I can’t help myself. “You prefer that one, do you? I’m afraid you’re a bit lacking in the chest area, but we could find you a smaller cup size.”
Curious, Sherlock goes to see what’s in the drawer on the other side. His contains handcuffs (both pink and furry, and neither), an even larger black dildo made of a more rigid material, what appears to be flavoured body paint, and even more lubricant. He can’t quite meet John’s eyes. They should be able to giggle about this, he thinks, but neither of them is. Instead, it’s just a bit awkward. “Well, given the nature of the place,” he says diplomatically, and shuts the drawer again. “I suppose they’re hoping for reconciliations to occur.”
Sherlock looks almost as though he wants to reproach himself. “I should have clarified,” he says. “There is no overt threat related to – what I think I may see here. I’ll tell you more when I know.”
He looks perfectly turned-out, as ever, wearing a dress shirt, perfectly-tailored trousers, his old blue silk dressing gown over top, his feet bare. His hair is still wet but otherwise styled just so, but in spite of his impeccable appearance, he looks rather unsure of himself, hesitating there in the doorway. John risks a look at him and realises at the same time that he’s nervous, almost. “Morning,” he says, and it comes out too quickly. He knows it’s because he spent the night in Sherlock’s room, that he doesn’t know how to just sound normal now, given that that happened, even if the reason for it had nothing to do with anything remotely sexual.
“It’s
“It already is,” Sherlock tells him, and John lowers his head to kiss him again. They’re moving together instinctively, touching everywhere, and Sherlock lets his hands wander freely, trying to touch as much of John as possible.
stupid, for all his jokes. He knew I had to be told it was Mary, too. She never believed I had any right to know the truth. Sherlock did. That was always one of the biggest differences between them. He’s lied to me before, but always for a good reason, frequently to protect me. I remember asking Lestrade, stupidly,
He shifts down after, pulling himself from John’s lips, and replaces his penis with his mouth on John’s, kissing him deeply enough that he can almost taste himself, John’s hands running appreciatively up and down his back and sides and arse. It’s paradise, Sherlock thinks hazily, then remembers that he’s supposed to be thinking. He decides to say this after a little bit. “I was supposed to be thinking,” he tells John. “I got distracted.”
John’s eyes swim again and he swallows hard. “I’ll never leave you, either,” he says, his throat tight. “I promise, Sherlock. I’ll never leave you again.”
They often go out on Saturdays. “Let’s go out,” Sherlock decides. “Should I see if Mrs Hudson wants to come?”
“It was faked,” Mycroft informs him. “Just a simple ruse that anyone could have pulled. She planned it. Paid off the coroners in advance. It would have been child’s play for her. Vivian Norbury never even fired a bullet.”
“I’m not going to rehab,” Sherlock says, rolling his bloodshot eyes. “I just need you to tell me how to convince John to see me again. I
Sherlock picks up the teapot and fills John’s mug. “And it was very much like your coaching,” he says, very quickly and avoiding John’s eyes. He fills his own mug, too. “He’d put music on, and we drank some wine. It was – nice.”
“Sneaky bastard.”
They look at each other. “Thanks,” John says carefully. “We’ll talk it over. The thing is, we’re sort of trying to be sparing about asking people to take her for times when we really need it, like when a case comes up, so… we’ll see. But thank you.”
Sherlock savours the words, his eyes still closed, his arms locked around John’s shoulders. “Okay,” he says at last, and John pulls back just enough to kiss him. It last for a long time, unhurried and beautiful, and by the time it’s over, much of the tension has left Sherlock’s shoulders.
“I’d give her a bath, but she’s already so sleepy,” Mrs Holmes says. “We’ll do it tomorrow.”
John smiles, though. “May I?” he asks, very gently. “I really want to, Sherlock. If you feel self-conscious about it, though, we don’t have to do this. I want this to be what you want.”
They paint a second coat in the corridor and it takes all morning. John finds he can barely keep his eyes off Sherlock’s arms and chest in the threadbare t-shirt he’s got on today and thinks that Irene certainly would have been purring over those biceps of his were she here. But she isn’t, and he feels enormously smug about the fact. He thinks back to when they first met Irene, and spontaneously says, “I feel like an idiot now for being so jealous of Irene all that time.”
Sherlock looks affronted. “She’s your daughter,” he says again. “And there is nothing in this life that could make me not want you to come home again. For good this time. She is part of your life, and therefore part of mine. This is – non-negotiable.”
“The night before last,” Corey tells him, his fingers twisting together. “I didn’t know what to do.”
Sherlock smiles, too. “That will be fun,” he agrees. “When should we have the wedding? Do you want to do something big or something small?”
Sherlock turns his head and looks into John’s eyes, wanting to ask him plainly if this is really the truth, but somehow the words won’t come. He can feel the doubt on his face, though, and can’t seem to arrange his expression into something more neutral. Instead, he asks, “Did that photographer confirm?”
John’s mouth moves behind his mask in a way that suggests he might be biting his lip. “I… I can’t really say. I just… yeah. Would you mind? I’ve… I’ve got you a ticket already.”
He’s doing it again, John notices. He feels the instinct to go to Sherlock, represses it for a second, then remembers that it’s not only allowed, but welcome, and lets himself do it after all. Sherlock is standing at the counter, tipping dried oregano into the small bowl in front of him and John goes to him and slips his arms around Sherlock’s middle, hugging him tightly. “Let’s have lettuce, then,” he says, his eyes closed, cheek pressed into the back of Sherlock’s neck. It couldn’t possibly matter less about the lettuce. “Have we got romaine?”
Sherlock wriggles his toes under John’s arse. “I am,” he concedes. “I’m rather looking forward to tonight.”
“Whose wedding was it?” Sherlock wants to know, his eyes boring through the lady’s forehead now.
Sherlock’s lips purse but he shakes his head. “No. It’s not that. She’s probably correct.”
John smiles at him, an interesting light in his eyes that Sherlock has only seen in glimpses over the years. “Don’t be,” he says again, firmly. “If you want that – God, Sherlock, if you even knew how much I’ve been shoving back and trying to ignore all this time. I want you. I want you so badly I can taste it. If you want – anything along those lines, it’s yours to have, starting here and now, if you want that!”
“John – I want – ” Sherlock is inarticulate, pulling back and dropping downward at the same time, and it takes John a second to grasp what’s going on.
. This is all that matters to me. You and I, here at last.”
, which John had forgotten. “I need a word,” he says, keeping his voice down. “Not in here. Meet me by the concierge desk in a minute or two.”
“Sunderland Royal,” Mycroft informs him. “We’ll meet at general admissions.” He moves toward the door, where Lestrade is already waiting, then stops and turns back, his gaze honing in on John. “What we discussed yesterday morning,” he says. “I trust you put the information to good use?”
“What do you mean by that?” John spears a bit of celery on one tine of his fork but doesn’t eat it.
“Oh, I do see,” his mother says. “And then there’d be the question of how many bedrooms and where to put everyone…”
Sherlock turns to Kyle. “How long have you worked here?” he asks.
Startled, we break apart, both of us looking as guilty as kids caught in the act of something naughty. “Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says, looking stunned, one hand going to his lips as though to hide the evidence of the kiss. “Where did you come from?”
She does notice Sherlock’s ongoing absence, though, and silently despairs over it. Mary says it’s just a phase, that he’s probably taking a break from solving crimes or something, and Molly wants to believe it, so she hasn’t raised too many objections with Mary’s theory. She hasn’t seen him since the morning of the eighteenth of June. Mary said she saw him once, a week after that, but her tone was distant and she made it clear that whatever it was hadn’t been very important. She doesn’t talk about John much, but sometimes Molly can tell that she must be thinking about him, especially in relation to her pregnancy. She feels badly for Mary, abandoned by her husband only a month after their wedding, right after their honeymoon! She would slap John if she ever saw him, too.
“I trust you could give it to me if I did,” Vee says, but Sherlock’s smile only grows and he doesn’t deny it.
“If you’re amenable, of course,” John says easily.
“Would you like a biscuit?” John offers his daughter, attempting to woo her attention with a chocolate biscuit, which would normally work.
Sherlock swallows and his eyes slide sideways to John. Ella watches him for a moment, but when he doesn’t speak, she goes on, addressing John. “So up until the moment with the scar, you were equally enthusiastic about the idea?”
“I’ll do what I can.” Mycroft pauses awkwardly. “Well. I’ll let you get back to… whatever you were doing.”
“God yes,” he breathes. “I never thought I would be allowed to touch you this way – I’ve wanted to for so long…” John moans at this and Sherlock goes faster, murmuring things he never thought to permit himself to actually say out loud.
Sherlock nods and turns onto his side, away from John. “It’s fine. I can sleep with it on.”
convincingly selling our cover story, if it’s not too great an inconvenience,” Sherlock says, his lips barely moving, and John has the sense to glean that he’s truly angry.
Sherlock is still smiling. “I know. Mycroft
“You – you feel like nothing I’ve ever felt before,” John tells him, thrusting at a steady, even, unhurried pace.
John frowns, seeing it. “Right. And it looks like he took a punch in the eye, too. Only much more recently.”
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes. “Yes, if you must know,” he mutters, keeping his voice down. “On the
.” He allows John to remove his shirt, then reaches for John’s t-shirt and pulls that off, too.
John’s eyes are doing something that makes Sherlock’s chest ache. He swallows, then reaches for Sherlock’s wrist and squeezes it. “I can’t even get over you,” he says, his voice a bit rough. “What did
Sherlock frowns. “What kind of a question is that?”
“I don’t know, but I’m not gay,” the man states forcefully.
“It’s a two-edged blade, Mother,” Mycroft reminds her. “You recall what I said when he met John Watson. That I didn’t know whether he would make Sherlock better or worse. I still haven’t quite decided on that one, though you know I’ve always leaned to thinking it’s made him worse.”
John smiles at her. “It was perfect. Really good. We went to The Odyssey and then to The Cake Café for dessert.”
Suddenly, he stops, realising that he’s arrived in front of his own door. Mary’s door. Whatever. The secondary realisation of his immense fatigue washes over him like an afterthought. The sun is rising above the street now. John staggers up the front steps and unlocks the door, letting himself inside. He’s too tired to bother with the fuss of going to bed properly. He steps out of his shoes, pulls off his jacket and drops it to the floor. It doesn’t matter. He doesn’t care. His entire life is up in the air, so who could possibly care about a jacket? He stumbles over to the sofa and lies down on it, pulls the blanket that’s draped over top down onto himself, and falls into an exhausted sleep within seconds.
mutual comfort. Nonetheless, it could never have continued and he didn’t want it to.
Once they’ve finished, John insists on paying, though Sherlock tries to protest. “This time, at least, let me,” John says. “After this, we can split, if you want. Or whatever you like.”
and shows it to Mary.
Molly goes over and gives her a glass, sitting down on the edge of the tub. “It’s that cider you like,” she says.
They pull themselves into crouches, ready to move, and John has his Sig drawn. There is an answering pair of flashes from the ground. “Tell Lestrade,” John says, eyes focused on the sky for the next signal.
John looks them all over, taking mental notes and the occasional real one in his little notebook as Sherlock questions them. He notices how gentle Sherlock is with them, too. He finishes within twenty minutes, per John’s recommendation – these people don’t look like they can handle too much right now – and sends them home with instructions to make contact the instant someone gets in touch about a ransom or anything else. The six parents leave, Richard Abbott glaring daggers at Sherlock on his way out, as though it’s somehow Sherlock’s fault that his daughter was kidnapped.
“Yeah, I did.” John scans his map. “Just a little further up. Slow down. Here.”
“No!” Rosie comes anyway, and they spend ten minutes putting peel-away stickers on a page in a book until it’s time to eat, which is about as long as his toddler daughter’s attention span will last for, anyway, but it’s nice. It’s soothing, somehow, and loath as he is to admit it, soothing is rather nice just about now.
Shit. John wants to punch something. He just can’t get it right, and Aliyah isn’t helping, her perfectly innocent attention likely making Sherlock even more touchy. He clears his throat and pushes back his chair. “In that case,” he says, forcing it to come out as lightly as he can manage. He walks away cursing himself and his complete inability to just have a conversation with Sherlock without fucking it up spectacularly. The dessert buffet is long and temptingly laden, meanwhile. John chooses a slice of decadent-looking chocolate torte of some sort, debates briefly, then adds a miniature éclair, and carries it back to the table. He’s got to do better, put on a better show for the others. Sell their cover story. He sits down and notices that his coffee cup has been filled, a splash of milk added, just the way he likes it.
“Sure. Just text us when you’re home,” Harry says curtly. “If it’s going to be an overnight, just give us a head’s up.”
Sherlock smiles, directing it at a framed securities certificate on the wall. “He’s moved back into Baker Street. He and Rosie both.”
button until it’s shut all the way, his eyes pinning John to the lift wall with enough intensity to burn directly through him the entire while.
“Yes we are,” John counters immediately, aware that it’s too fast, too defensive. “We’re here to plan our wedding. We just haven’t found a venue we like yet.”
John lifts his head, smiling. “I like it,” he says. “What else were you thinking? Say, before brunch?”
Margaret swivels her chair around to reach for something on her desk. “I forgot about this,” she says, and passes a card over – to Sherlock, not John.
This gives Horace momentary pause, but then he says, “No. Day off. For both of us.”
“Done,” he says. “Now kiss me again!”
“All right.” Sherlock picks up the knife. “How much?” he asks, meaning for John.
John pauses for a long moment, then shakes his head. “Let’s not do this here.” He gets up and reaches for his clothes, scattered on the floor where he left them, takes them to his bag and to swap for clean ones.
Kyle is nodding. “That’s what he said.”
his responsibility, whether or not John wants him to assume it. Every decision he has made since the day he leapt from the roof St. Bart’s has been made for John’s sake above all else.
“’o ahead,” John says through the foam. He glances at Sherlock through the mirror, at the abdominal muscles clearly visible despite the loose t-shirt, the perfection of his torso in general, and feels a stirring in the pit of his belly. (Stop it.) He spits and rinses his mouth and toothbrush, then moves out of the way so that Sherlock can do the same. “G’night,” he says, yawning and trying not to notice the way Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms cling to his arse.
John’s fingers tighten in his; they’ve mentioned this in passing but never as a firmly-stated plan yet.
John hesitates. “Physical contact can be, er, reassuring,” he says, trying not to sound as awkward as he feels about saying this. “Touch has a way of grounding people when the trauma takes hold. I – can I, er, give you a hug?”
They’ve tried almost everything there is to try, never turning down a new idea or position or place, and instead of becoming dull with familiarity, Sherlock is amazed to see that the sense of intimacy just grows continually. John’s body feels as familiar as his own, and he loves cataloguing the sounds he makes, the specific expressions that come across his face, the particular muscle groups activated. The things he says during sex, or after, and then there’s all of the space in between. The small things – the little touches and looks and words, all of which serve to bind them more and more tightly together. It’s like being on a permanent high, and Sherlock is insanely happy, as he described it to John over breakfast the other day. “Every time I think I can’t feel any happier, another day occurs and I think that I’m even happier than I was the day before,” he told John, their hands linked across the table as they ate.
“Both.” Sherlock ducks in and kisses him again and John not only permits it, but kisses back with enthusiasm, several times. Finally, Sherlock pulls back. “I suppose we shouldn’t get too carried away,” he says, though it’s difficult. “I don’t want us to miss our reservation.”
As they’re drinking slightly-burnt coffee and what John decides is a rather unremarkable strawberry cheesecake, Steven steps up to a podium and introduces the guest speakers and workshop leaders for the week, as well as a fleet of staff he refers to as conference facilitators. John occupies himself by surreptitiously surveying the crowd and asking himself who among them might actually try to bomb the Pride parade. Steven is explaining that they’ll be divided into groups for their workshops and sessions, and he hopes that they won’t put him and Sherlock into different groups. Although, he reasons, it would give them double the opportunities to observe potential criminals in their midst.
! All right, then: you chat with your John and let me know what’s what, and what time I can expect the three of you. Just send me a text or something, no need to call. Mycroft’s coming up on the six-eleven train, I believe. Speak soon, then!”
John looks at him, dazed. “What?”
Suddenly it becomes clear. He can see John in the reflection of the darkened glass below the screen, the tight, worried expression on his face, and finally he knows how he can do this. It’s likely that Eurus will not allow them to escape her traps alive, and he’s always had a need to say this to John, anyway. He looks at John’s eyes in the glass and memorises his beautiful face. None of the ugliness matters now. Only this. He shifts his gaze back to Molly in the camera but his eyes see nothing but John. “I love you,” he says, and the never-before uttered words come out sounding unnaturally gentle on his tongue, his voice low but the conviction in his tone is real. He says it again, just for the sheer novelty of saying it to John. It doesn’t matter that no one in the room, John included, knows who it was really for.
We get home and get ourselves out of the taxi and up the stairs into the flat. Sherlock undresses me from my jacket on down right there in the sitting room and I just stand there and let him, giggling feebly. “And here I thought you wanted to go to sleep with me,” I say, trying for innocence even as my hands yank his coat off and drop it on the floor.
John grins. “Or panna cotta. Or anything involving chocolate ganache. Or mincemeat tarts. Or basically any flavour of cheesecake. Or – ”
, that he doesn’t have the heart for the time it takes to raise a child, that he doesn’t want to take that time, that he knows she deserves better.
“Don’t apologise, for God’s sake! You’ve done nothing wrong!” Sherlock swings into the drive in front of the cottage and jumps out, yanking John’s door open.
“Another child has been taken, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says urgently. “I
he types back, leaving the wording of the ‘we’ deliberately vague and steering the topic away from Sherlock and the carefully-worded message John crafted for his website, saying that he’s not currently taking cases.
“Mm-hm.” John is still frustrated by the whole thing and doesn’t break his stride, intending to go on to his own room.
Sherlock fidgets, probably already bored of the chitchat. “Did you notice anything unusual at the time?” he asks of the younger employee. “Any reason that might have led to the fall? Was there anyone else present when you found the victim?”
“Sorry,” he panted. “I – ”
But all that’s over. I moved back into Baker Street pretty soon after all that mess with Eurus Holmes. About two weeks into trying to juggle life with a baby and sitting out cases, though Sherlock awkwardly (nicely, I should say) didn’t take the majority of them, knowing I couldn’t come with, his parents had us over for Sunday dinner and suggested that maybe they could keep Rosie for the majority of the time. I saw in retrospect how nervous they were about asking, Mrs Holmes in particular. They didn’t want to overstep, plus they openly referenced their failure with their own daughter and Mr Holmes explained that they were sort of looking for redemption, for a do-over. They also made all of the logical arguments about Baker Street hardly being the safest place in the world for an infant, given that every criminal in the world knows the address, plus if we’re being blunt, neither Sherlock or I make particularly good parental figures. I can do it, when I’m not busy wallowing in guilt and borderline alcoholism, and to be fair, Sherlock’s not half bad, either. He carefully kept out of the entire discussion. All he’d say was that it was my decision, that Rosie was perfectly welcome to stay with us at Baker Street if that was what I wanted. He refused to tell me what he wanted, stubbornly repeating that it was my daughter and my decision. I wanted to say yes, except how do you say yes to that?? It’s tantamount to admitting that you’re kind of a shit father and have got priorities that you’d prefer to come before your one-year-old daughter who just lost her mother. Mrs Holmes made the argument for stability, for their availability in their retirement, for the safety of their peaceful little village. Their desire for grandchildren.
Sherlock moaned loudly, lifted his hips up hard and erupted in John’s mouth.  John kept swallowing until Sherlock slumped back into the chair.  He let Sherlock’s softening cock slide from his mouth.
“Fine,” Greg said to John and Richard.  “I’ll show him. But if there are any repercussions, it’s on you.  I’m not taking the blame this time for another one of your fuck ups.”  He stared hard at Richard before he turned to Sherlock.  “Come on.”
“When I need to say something, I tend to be very direct,” he said, “but entirely truthful.”
Sherlock stared at him and then quickly glanced back at the rest.  Nobody else had moved, but they had stopped their singing when John opened the door.  They silently stood watching him.  Sherlock walked through the door into a small room.  The door swung shut behind him.  A plain wooden table with a computer terminal sat in the middle of the dimly lit room.  Sherlock walked over and sat down placing the tubes on the table.  An old-fashioned computer monitor and keyboard.  A most unusual set-up. The glowing green cursor blinked expectantly on the black screen.
“Really,” Sherlock said, settling next to Richard.  Sherlock had noticed that Sarah had been following him from a distance since he had come to the roast, but now came closer.  Richard put his arm around Sherlock, rubbing his shoulder, staring intently at Sarah.  Sarah lingered before a moment before disappearing.
Mary turned toward John.  “Sherlock has something he wants to tell you,” she declared.
“Cuneiformist.” He shook his head.  “First time in the field, and all that, before you ask.”
“I’m John’s assistant.”
Greg looked annoyed.  “Just get it done,” he said and he walked away, leaving Sherlock alone.
He didn’t know.  He still wasn’t sure why he was there.
, Sherlock thought.  “Let me ask you then,” he said, stopping.  Greg was forced to stop and he let his arm drop from Sherlock’s shoulders.  “I wasn’t brought here for translations of Akkadian, Pontic, Greek, or even Latin.  What exactly am I doing here?  Because if you can’t...or won’t...tell me, I’m ready to go home.  Now.”
“What do you mean ‘no’?” Greg asked incredulously.  “You translated what was on the wall.  Why can’t you do this?’
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just wandered around the site, watching them as they did their work.  It was very tedious.  The bones were already exposed and lying on the floor of the pit.  A worker would carefully pick up a bone for Molly to inspect it, and after she looked it over it was bagged.  There were a lot of bones, almost like it was a mass grave site.  The bones themselves looked darker than what he expected.  He was curious about them but thought it might be best not to ask questions of Molly.
“Ohhh,” Sherlock moaned as John began to repeatedly thrust into him.  He clung to John with one arm and stroked his own cock with his other hand.  John was entirely focused on fucking.  Suddenly Sherlock’s cock erupted, warm stickiness between the two of them.  John thrust one last hard thrust into him and groaned loudly.
She put her hand on John’s forehead, stopping him.  “That’s enough, sweetie.” She pulled her hips back and knelt down to kiss John passionately.  “Go on,” she whispered.
“Fine,” Greg said.  “Here.” He tossed a key to Sherlock.  “Between now and then, do what you can.  Get me something.”  He quickly left.
John shivered in his coat as the cold November wind whipped through the streets.  He wished he had brought a hat, primarily for warmth.  “It was your idea.  Well, one of you.  Maybe you both conspired together.  It doesn’t matter.  And now I’m getting cold, so either let’s get this over with, or head back to the Tube.”
John was on his knees immediately.  Mary walked over to him and gently placed her hand on the back of his head.  He knew instinctively what to do and began to kiss and lick Mary between her legs.  She sighed as she pressed his head in and urged him on with her fingers.
"Nice to meet you Ms. Hooper,” he said, letting go of his suitcase and awkwardly extending his hand, trying to keep his duffle bag from dropping off his shoulder.
The corridor emptied into a great big cavern with a large shaft in the center dropping away into nothing.  The faint glow that highlighted the metal buttresses in the corridors and now this room gave no indication what was down there.  He walked over to the shaft.  It was pitch black.  He glanced around.  Multiple doorways similar to the one that he had emerged from ringed the cavern, leading to more corridors.  Which one to take?  None of them were appealing.  None of them gave the slightest indication on how to get out.
Greg considered what Sherlock said.  “OK.  So where does that get us?  How soon do you think you can get me something? Anything.”
It was then that six robed figures emerged from the corridors into the room.  Each person had on a white hooded robe.  They were followed by a dozen more behind each of them also in hooded robes.  Sherlock carefully adjusted his grip on the weapons, raising them about waist high, waiting, anticipating.  He spun quickly, trying to keep an eye on each of them.  “I would advise each of you,” he called out loudly, his voice echoing around the sparse chamber, “that unfortunately I had no choice but to use a device to eliminate Richard Brook, or Jim Moriarty, if you knew him by that name.”
“Good thinking.” John checks the time. “Let’s get an update on the list of missing persons who came here in the past five years. We can see who went missing while they were here, who never checked out. I wonder… it would be really handy to get onto Kyle’s computer.”
Sherlock shoos him away. “She’s your daughter,” he reminds John. “Of course I don’t mind.”
, so I just – there hasn’t been a good time to mention it. I was furious, on both our behalves. But especially yours.”
“Don’t call it that!” Molly is mortified, but Mary just grins, lacing their fingers together. Molly’s curiosity gets the better of her. “What secret?”
Anna clears her throat. “As to that, is the fee we talked about still agreeable?” she asks Sherlock politely.
John pauses. They’re standing too close together, Sherlock thinks. There’s suddenly an enormous amount of charge in the air between them and John’s shoulders seem to be rather tight. “Well – good night,” he says, his eyes going quickly to Sherlock’s. “Sleep well.” He turns away, and the tension breaks.
“I wanted you to know,” Sherlock tells her. “We’re – together now. It’s been about two weeks. I didn’t want you to hear it from anyone else.”
, Sherlock reminds himself.
Sherlock’s got an answer ready. “Now we need to eat some cake,” he states.
“Please,” Sherlock requests, dabbing at his mouth with his serviette and pushing away his empty plate. He takes another sip of his cocktail. “I want to – get to the heart of the issue here.”
He says it back, his voice wrecked and gasping, but Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind at all. They lie there in a tangled mess of arms and legs and torsos and it’s the best thing in the universe.
“Good.” John decides to start above Sherlock’s dressing gown this time, resuming where he left off at Sherlock’s lower back and rubbing his thumbs in circles, shifting gradually lower until he’s actually touching Sherlock’s silk-covered arse. He goes slowly, just passing his palms over the firm, warm curves at first, then squeezing a little, then starting to massage again. “Still okay?” he asks, clearing his throat.
Sherlock chances a look at John and sees that his brow is slightly furrowed. What is he thinking about? It occurs to Sherlock that Christmas is right around the corner, and this year they’ll be here together for it. Here, at home, because John is home at last.
He makes a movement that might be a shrug. “I don’t know. Juvenile or something. I mean, it was just – ”
he thinks, getting his arms all the way around Sherlock in turn and kissing him breathless. He had no idea Sherlock felt this much for him, in this way. It’s absolutely incredible. They kiss and kiss and forget entirely about trying to get to bed, revelling in this long-sought, hard-won moment at last.
“Good point. Let’s research first.” Sherlock sits down and reaches for his laptop. “By which I mean that I’m going to research. You do what you like.”
Sherlock’s phone starts to ring, sitting on the table. Sherlock touches it without picking it up and presses the button for speaker phone. “Sherlock Holmes,” he says.
He feels a flush of heat in his face and clears his throat. He decides to change the subject. “How did you find out that Mycroft was – part of this?” he asks.
“That we did,” Sherlock says, without meaning the berries at all, and John hears his unspoken meaning and smiles.
The massage feels heavenly. Molly drops her head forward and closes her eyes, letting the sensation soak through her as her muscles slowly relax. “Well,” she says, her eyes still closed, “I have to admit that the way you touched me – even by accident – that was better than anything Todd ever did for me.”
Sherlock’s laugh comes out his nose. “I’d forgotten,” he admits. “Such is the power of your influence over me.”
John making a humming sound and kisses him again, as though he can’t make himself stop. “Know what?” he murmurs.
John shakes his head. “No. It belonged entirely to Mary. I’ve never even seen the deed.”
In his hand, his phone begins to ring, echoing off the bathroom tiles, so Sherlock hastens out and down the corridor before answering. It’s his mother. “Hello Mummy,” he says quietly, from the sitting room.
“These things never truly die, brother mine,” Mycroft informs him dryly. He shifts his gaze back to John, his tone becoming instructional. “The Rosomakha were known for their brutality, as well as for their skill with bomb-making.”
John is sitting at the desk with his laptop, but closes it and gets up now. He goes automatically to the same side of the bed he chose earlier when looking into the night table drawers, the right side, so Sherlock goes and stands across from him on the left. It’s the side he would have preferred, anyway. “Look,” John says, very prosaically. “We’re both adults. This is for a case. We’ll just – be professional about this, yeah?”
Sherlock swallows, his face flushed with arousal. “I – we don’t have to,” he begins, obviously torn.
John wonders if it’s only he who hears it as suspicious, too. “Er, no,” he says. “No idea.” Spontaneously, he adds, “He’s quite the morning person, though, and he likes long walks. Could be that he’s just out having a walk before it gets too hot outside. He’s known for taking early morning walks back in London.” At least he didn’t say
“Nothing,” John says. “Just – that’s an interesting choice of main dish. If I may.”
“Then have me,” Sherlock tells him, his voice shot through with breath and far too much feeling, but he’s not even trying to censor it for once. “I’m yours.”
“Mmm,” Sherlock says in response. He pulls John onto him and puts his hands on his arse. John’s body is beginning to feel nearly as familiar as his own, and it’s phenomenal. John rocks into him, reaching for the lubricant at the same time, and manages to get a palmful of it onto them without even breaking the rhythm, and Sherlock groans in deep appreciation. Pleasure curls through his body in tendrils, his skin alive with it. He remembers John saying that High Wycombe would be better than he was then equipped to imagine, and he thinks now that John was entirely right, sort of. Minus the part about the Woman. It was always John. His very erections are tailor-made for John and John alone. Otherwise, what would be the point? He renews his grip on John’s arse and thrusts up against him, their erections equally hard as they slide and rub against each other’s, and he revels in being this wanted, this desired, this loved. John’s body heat is all around him, the scent of him heady, his mouth on Sherlock’s, his breath in Sherlock’s mouth, and when he comes, Sherlock can feel it in every part of himself, as though it’s his own peak. John is rigid against him, legs tensing as his penis erupts, and then he wraps his fingers around Sherlock’s sticky erection and jerks it hard, his voice urging out the orgasm as much as his fist is. Sherlock’s vision blurs and he comes precisely when John tells him to, his back lifting off the sheets as his body twists and jerks in it climax, stars flashing across the backs of his eyes, breathing turning to fire in his lungs.
, what an idiot he’s been!)
After a moment or two, John emerges, wearing a fresh pair of jeans and barefoot, holding his towel in front of his bare torso. His hair is damp and sticking up in spikes and Sherlock’s mouth fills unwittingly with saliva at the entire look. John’s eyes find Sherlock where he’s sitting and he smiles. He deposits his old clothes over the footrest of his bed, then comes over. “You lit the fire,” he says approvingly.
Sherlock keeps his eyes down, crossing the ancient carpet to set the teapot and two mugs down on the coffee table, but there’s a hint of smile in the corners of his mouth and he nods. “Yes.”
“As if I would have,” he scoffs. “I’ll be bragging about this to every other person we meet. Just wait. But now, who do you think we should tell first? All of them at once, or just a few people?”
Her hands are squeezing and squeezing, her fingertips pressing into Molly’s stiffened nipples and all she can do is gasp and nod, her mouth falling open. Her entire body has flushed with arousal in a way she thought herself practically incapable of feeling, at least with Todd. Her breath exhales shakily. “Mm-hm,” she manages, and Mary rewards her by nibbling at her ear. The sensation sends a bolt of hot sensation pulsing into Molly’s pelvis and she tries not to gasp, but it’s difficult.
“Naturally.” Sherlock nods. “I would never let on, of course.” His lips compress in regret. “I’m sorry I missed them. Next time, definitely.”
Sherlock’s lips tighten. “You don’t have to apologise by – by doing this. I don’t want that.”
“It’s all about intention, mate,” John says, then immediately reflects that ‘mate’ still doesn’t work. “Here, let me demonstrate.”
He’s defending Sherlock, Ella notes, but at the cost of throwing himself to the wolves again. “All right, let’s address that,” she says, deciding to tackle this head-on. “What would you say is damaging your relationship so far?”
Sherlock turns now, looking back at him, his eyes dark and intense in the dim lighting. “Mary killed Kyle Rosenfeld,” he says starkly. “Have you put that together yet?”
He rattles off the name and carrier before I’ve even got my phone out, but I’ve learned to keep up. “Hang on,” I say, typing as quickly as I can with both thumbs. “All right: it was delivered at 8:53am this morning.”
John smiles. “Come on up!” he calls through the open flat door, then goes to stand at the top of the stairs.
“Sorry, I don’t mean to pry,” Chris said, but went on in a philosophical tone. “Sometimes people find it helpful to talk through it, you know?”
They fly to Montréal the next day. It’s sudden but as long as Rosie is with them, she’s in danger. Besides, Sherlock had suggested that it might be easier in the long run to get it over with as quickly as possible. No point drawing it out. John had agonised, but agreed. There was little to pack; the Johnsons will provide everything Rosie needs. He packed her bear, though.
John shows him the schedule. “They’ve got me down for a coaching with that Gary guy. One-on-one!”
John gives them an awkward wave and Corey smiles at him.
Her hand tightens and she nods. “That’s just what I was wanting to ask. We already think of her that way, you know. If Sherlock ever adopts her legally, then we truly will be her grandparents. I’m glad you’ve said it, John. I’m glad you think of us that way. And – I didn’t say before, because I didn’t want to embarrass my son, but – thank you. Thank you for loving him.”
Sherlock watches him, caring for him so fiercely that it aches. “Then I’m glad I did,” he says, his voice low.
“No time for a heart-to-heart, I’m afraid,” Sherlock says, almost brutally brusque. “I need a result and then I need to get back to Lambeth as quickly as humanly possible.”
As though hearing his thoughts, John glances up at him and clears his throat. “I’m, er, really glad to be back, you know,” he says, his voice breaking into the song and the silence. “I just – yeah. Being here again… it’s good. And with – yeah.” He clears his throat again. “Just being able to… I don’t know. Not just eat together, because we’ve always done that, but making dinner together, and being around for when you’ve gone and blown yourself up and that, being able to keep an eye on you after… yeah. Just all of that. I’m glad to be – back.”
To his surprise, John gives a laugh, just through his nose, but his entire face softens. “I think I’ve always known,” he says ruefully. “More than I wanted to.” He turns and starts walking again, heading for the York Gate exit. Sherlock falls into step beside him, anxious to hear the rest of this. He waits, his face angled toward John as they walk, and after a moment John carries on. “I tried so hard to hide it, even from myself,” he admits. “The attraction was there from the start. That much, I can say now. A specific moment when I knew that I loved you, though?” He shakes his head. “I knew that I was jealous of anyone else you paid attention to. I could have throttled Irene Adler with my bare hands. Moriarty, too. There were thousands of tiny moments, though, where I knew it in my own head. Just small things. Laughing with you at Buckingham Palace, you in your sheet and not a stitch under it. Maybe even laughing with you at Baker Street, in the front hall the night I moved in.”
“I think if you’d said it then, I’d have gone completely to pieces,” John admits. “With Mary and Mycroft there, too… maybe that’s for the best.”
“That’s fine, I’ve got plenty at the flat,” John tells him. “Besides, I’ll be back in a few hours, anyway.”
John takes a deep breath. “Yes.” Good: that sounded unwavering and certain. He waits.
Sherlock looks around, surveying, and decides that John is right. “All right,” he says, and carefully arranges himself beside John, not too close, but the blanket is only so large. Without Lestrade and company around to make it seem funny or something, it feels oddly… he doesn’t know how to put it. But as the silence of the forest deepens around them, it occurs to him rather profoundly that there is no one he would rather be on a stake-out with, no one whom he would rather have at his side, warm and reliable and trustworthy. John radiates it, possibly entirely unaware of the aura of confidence in his own competence that he projects. Then Sherlock thinks of something John said, several weeks back,
Sherlock glances surreptitiously over toward the kitchen end of the flat and sees that Todd is deeply immersed in conversation with Brad, discussing the trial, based on the scraps of conversation he can hear. He wonders what Todd would think of this line of thinking.
“With a good deal of help from Mary, whom I forgave, and from my sister, whom I forgave. What each of them did was considerably worse on balance, so what more wouldn’t I forgive from the person I care about most in this universe?” Sherlock asks, drawing back just far enough to look into John’s eyes, posing it like a completely logical question. “I don’t care. I don’t care at
“Letter for you, sir. Delivered on your brother’s orders,” the minion informed him, then departed without further exchange.
a privilege. It only took about three weeks, once that whole mess with Eurus finished up. He’d started spending more and more time at Baker Street again, with and without Rosie, hating the long (and expensive) cab rides back out to the suburbs where the flat he’d shared with Mary was. They’d started regular casework again, or as regular as he could swing between juggling Rosie and a shift or two of locum work. They’d just finished a case and Sherlock asked about dinner, but John had checked the time and reluctantly declined, as Molly had only said she could keep Rosie until nine that night and he was going to be cutting it close as it was. He’d explained, and Sherlock had accepted it without challenge, raising his arm to flag down a taxi for him.
Their entire group is sitting together tonight, with the noticeable absence of Jeremy and Scott. Doug frowns. “Isn’t tomorrow the big final dinner and dance thing?”
It’s only twenty-four hours before John tries it again, and this time Sherlock cannot head it off. John went out to run an errand of some sort after supper, to Sherlock’s private relief as well as his contradictory wish that they could have gone together, but he knows better than to suggest it right now. It’s after nine when John reappears. He walks into the sitting room without taking off his shoes or coat and stops a few feet from where Sherlock is sitting in his chair with his laptop open.
John is still spasming around him even as he pulls Sherlock down to him, holding him as his body shudders through the aftershocks, his hands and voice soothing him, rubbing the tremors out of his muscles and skin. Sherlock cannot even speak, it was so intense, and John is murmuring praise into his hair, kissing him feverishly on the forehead and cheeks as Sherlock gasps and shakes against him. “You’re phenomenal, that was so, so, so good,” John tells him, wrapping his legs around Sherlock and rocking him like a child.
John comes closer still, seeming fascinated. “I never even imagined you in glasses.”
!!” The polite protests die on his lips as Sherlock closes his own around John’s cock without the slightest sign of reluctance or hesitation. It’s so blatant, too, right here in the kitchen at eight in the evening, when anyone could  walk in. He thinks of Mrs Hudson popping round for a chat, as she sometimes does, but instead of finding the idea agonisingly humiliating, his treacherous cock gives a fierce throb within the hot, wet harbour of Sherlock’s mouth at the thought of it, of being caught.
, but around the kitchen it was always somewhat diffident,
He shakes his head. “She doesn’t have any lubricant in her drawer. It’s
“Dinner first, then,” Sherlock decides. “Let’s go and see what’s out there.”
“The – abuse cycle.” John crunches in on himself even further. “The marriage. Mary. How she was to me, and I didn’t even – I thought it was normal. Just what all marriages are like. And I just – turned it on everyone around me.”
“Lights?” Sherlock repeats blankly.
John takes a long drink of water, his head tipping back, and Sherlock can’t take his eyes from his throat. John sets his glass down, then says, “Did you like the massage, then?”
Sherlock doesn’t look at him, some sort of internal debate seeming to play out within him. Eventually he says, picking up the information packet that contains the daily schedule, “Not necessarily. But our track record has been… noticeably deficient in that regard.”
Sherlock sits back on his heels. “There is so much we never say,” he says quietly, still looking at me. “Years’ worth of undiscussed subject matter. I thought it was an unspoken agreement that we simply choose not to acknowledge it. Yet today it feels closer to the surface than usual. I don’t know why, either. But I’ve felt for the past week now that there are things you want to say, or questions you want to ask, perhaps.”
John glances at Sherlock. “Were you here when it happened?”
I stop only once I’m all the way inside, waiting for his body to relax around the intrusion of my cock. The muscles of his arse are quivering frantically, which feels so good I could come right now if I don’t hold myself in check. “Okay?” I breathe, cupping his face with my hand.
“Except the stag night,” John says. “I almost slipped then. If I had… I doubt I ever would have been able to go through with marrying Mary. Now I wish that I hadn’t, but we still got here in the end, didn’t we?” This comes out sounding a bit too wistful, his guilt showing plainly.
“This do you?” the driver asks dubiously.
I open his bedroom door and smile around it. He’s already in bed, the tiny towel hung over the back of his chair to dry. Jesus. Is he naked in there? He must be; his shoulders and upper chest certainly are. I swallow. “Just wanted to say good night,” I say.
Sherlock nods. “Yes. It was a long time ago, but yes. I do.”
John looks at his daughter in slight shock; he can’t believe he actually forgot about her for a second, there. “Right, yeah,” he says, feeling guilty that Sherlock was the one to think of it. She’s still banging on her tray and she’s a mess from dinner and objects loudly to him pulling her out of the high chair, the nonsense babbling turning into shouts of protest. He hastily dabs at her face and clothes, though her onesie is a disaster and needs to go in the laundry posthaste.
Aliyah laughs at him. “Don’t be silly,” she says. “Anyone can dance to this!”
Ella looks across at him. “Yes, that does help clarify that, too,” she says, very slightly dry. “That would certainly throw a wrench into any marriage.” There’s a pause wherein John is very afraid that she’s going to try to make him talk about Sherlock again, but she mercifully stays on the subject of Mary. “Let’s talk about that. When did you find out that she was – who she was? I’m guessing you didn’t go into the marriage knowing that.”
“We’ll go the instant it seems that it’s – that it’s too much,” John fills in quickly. “Absolutely.” He stands up. “In that case, let’s get ourselves ready. I’ll text Greg and get us an address.” He’s brisk, taking his cup to the counter and switching off the coffee maker and hoping that his surface of assurance will help bolster the doubt he can tangibly feel radiating off Sherlock. He has doubts, himself – it’s only been about a week since the last nightmare, and possibly only because he’s there in Sherlock’s bed every night, warding them off. But maybe Sherlock needs this, needs to get back into it. He’ll just stay on high alert, watch for any sign at all that the trauma is being re-triggered. Somehow he doesn’t think there would be any warning, but – well, what else can he do but be on guard for it? His lack of knowledge about any of this is frustrating as hell.
Sherlock makes a sound of affirmation. “Did you bring your – ”
“Christmas lights, dear,” Mrs Hudson says. “It’s already the twelfth of December! About time you decorated for the season!”
Harry’s incredulity fades and she looks at him for awhile, then nods. “Yeah. Okay. I get that,” she says, and John remembers with a rush of relief that, despite her bluntness and short temper, Harry can really be quite decent when she wants to be. “Shall I see about getting Rosie up, then?” she asks, nodding toward the video monitor.
Nevertheless, dinner is slightly tense, at least for him, and he can sense John’s tension beside him. They eat and chat with Andrew, Avi, Justin, and Thom, who all joined their table for the meal. The fire is roaring in the central fireplace and Sherlock glances subtly around at the staff members present and wonders which of them are murderers and sex trade traffickers. He lifts mouthfuls of thick rice noodles and succulent shrimp to his mouth and also wonders absently, as John chats to Avi on his other side, whether they’ll have a chance to get back to what Scott interrupted earlier. The very thought of it makes his stomach flutter in anticipation and, thinking of their third night of sharing a bed, no small amount of nerves. Perhaps there won’t even be an opportunity for that. We’ll see, Sherlock tells himself silently, then stirs when John says his name and draws him back into the conversation.
Sherlock bites his lower lip and nods, breathing hard. “You?” he manages.
ago! I think during the first year we lived together!”
“Sherlock…” John looks over at him, his book in his lap, an odd tone to his voice.
Sherlock looks self-conscious, but a bit pleased, too. “I think it went well,” he says. “He was… surprisingly easy to talk to. I thought we wouldn’t have much in common.”
Sherlock doesn’t ask him what he means. A moment goes by, then he nods. “Okay.” This time it comes out in a whisper.
John accepts this and ducks his face downward. “I should have asked a long time ago,” he says humbly. It's always so painful to admit fault and this time is no different. “It wasn’t that I didn’t want to know – I just – everything got so complicated, there, and I just – didn’t want to rock the boat, I guess. I’m asking now. I do want to know, if you’ll tell me.” He hesitates, then gets up and goes round to the other side of the bed, then sits down there, next to Sherlock but at a safe distance, settling himself comfortably to make it clear that he’s in for the duration, in no hurry to go back up to his own bed. “I’ve got all night,” he says, wanting to make it as clear as he can. “I want to hear any part of it that you’re willing to tell me. Both because I think it might help, and because I genuinely want to know. I always have, honestly. It just… I guess it seemed like I’d missed my chance to hear about it. I guess it was never too late to ask, but I should have.” He waits a moment, but Sherlock doesn’t say anything. He swallows. “Tell me?” he requests, his voice coming out low.
her father if you choose to claim that role. If some paper somewhere says that someone else happened to contribute his genetic material to the process, what of it? That’s not what makes a parent. If you choose the reality that you are Rosie’s father, then you are. It’s as simple as that, at least in my view.”
Now, John stretches and says that he’s going to put the kettle on. “Also, we haven’t eaten yet,” he points out. “You hungry?”
Sometimes she’s more affectionate that than. Molly frowns a little, then writes back,
“The map, maybe,” John says. He goes to the table and finds it in their package. “Got it. Let’s go.”
Sherlock leans into him. “If we’re talking about your former girlfriends, then me too,” he reminds John easily, his tone light, and that actually makes John laugh.
John looks at Sherlock and Sherlock sees that they’re thinking the same thing. He doesn’t often feel empathy, but now he does. “Did he go to the steam room?” he asks, keeping his voice down.
“Well – ” Lestrade definitely sounds both awkward and apologetic and shoots a look of the latter in Sherlock’s direction. “Even, er, with the wife and that… it seems people have always sort of thought that… well. Yeah. Not just round the office, either. It’s a question that tends to come up at press conferences and that, too. The point is that if you two show up at this place, obviously people will know who you are. But I think they’ll find it pretty believable that you’re a couple. I mean, more than Anderson and Hallsey, say. Can you see Anderson posing as half of a couple in any of the group therapy sessions?!”
Sherlock absorbs all of this in silence, looking down at his tea. Then, after a little, he looks over at John through his eyelashes, almost as though afraid to look at him too directly, and John is put in mind of the bomb in the Underground, that time. It’s the same look. “All right,” he says, and that’s it: somehow that’s all it needs.
Sherlock doesn’t even try to disguise the fact that he’s breathing hard, though. He takes a step back, surveying me in minute detail from head to toe. “You’re… phenomenal,” he says, his voice low and slightly unsteady. “John…”
This time it’s particularly interesting. I watch him as he pulls out the drawer of the nightstand on the left side of the bed. Sherlock glances inside, closes the drawer, and drops to his knees to peer under the bed. Evidently that tells him little; he gets up and goes to the other side and opens the corresponding drawer on the man’s side of the bed. He glances inside, goes to shut the drawer, then changes his mind and opens it again, an odd look on his face. With his gloves on, he reaches inside and picks up a tube of what I immediately recognise as lube, though not the specific brand. I rather hope Sherlock won’t need me to explain what it is, or what it’s used for, though that could also be rather hilarious, particularly if Lestrade is about. He’s not, though; he’s downstairs in the drawing room with the forensics team.
“Exactly that. He’s not the father,” Mary says quietly, but her voice is very steady.
John grins into the phone, fighting to keep it balanced between his ear and shoulder as he ties his shoelaces in a hurry, teetering precariously on one foot. “Naturally. I’m heading down to get a taxi now! I just got a text – was that the address?”
John’s hand tightens on his knee, but he stops trying to talk at last, stiffening as Sherlock fits his torn skin together and begins his first stitch. John has stitched him up on multiple occasions before, but each time Sherlock more or less ignored it while it was happening, at least the preparations for it, and now it feels as though he’s missed out on monumentally important information. He asks questions throughout where necessary, and John guides and confirms, still grey with pain. The radio goes off once or twice, but Sherlock ignores it. He’ll phone or email later. This is too important.
Sherlock isn’t quite aware of what he says, if he says anything. He fully expects John to release his hand then, but he doesn’t. They stand jointly, and John still doesn’t let go. He will when they leave the office, then, Sherlock thinks, but John continues as though they’re still being observed. Their fingers are laced together, John’s palm warm and dry against his own. When he still doesn’t let go as they walk away, Sherlock’s mouth goes dry. Perhaps this isn’t only for show, then. Perhaps John truly wants to be holding his hand this way. The thought is stunning. They make their way through the back building and toward the north guest wing, encountering no one. They don’t say a word, walking together as though on a secret mission, hand-in-hand, and Sherlock’s pulse is hammering all the louder against his ear drums.
Sherlock wets his toothbrush and sets about cleaning his teeth, ducking in below John’s razor arm to spit once he’s finished. He rinses the brush, then dries his face and hands and leans back against the doorframe to watch the rest of John’s shave. He’s also got an ulterior motive, but isn’t sure how to word it, specifically. His obvious excuse of Rosie’s presence is absent; Harry and Gwyneth habitually pick her up on Thursdays and keep her overnight, giving John a regular night off from parental duties. Otherwise it might have made for a useful segue. He waits.
“Absolutely,” John promises. He smiles, and it seems to settle the flickering uncertainty on Sherlock’s face. He unbuttons Sherlock’s shirt, pulling it out of the waistband of his ungodly-tailored trousers, aware of Sherlock’s eyes on him like lasers the whole time. Sherlock responds by hauling John’s old t-shirt off over his head, which makes him giggle. “Impatient,” he quips, and the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twists into a smirk.
“Not quite, but I will be soon,” John says. “Want to catch the late news, or were you thinking you’d head to bed?”
John isn’t sure what he means.
John looks around, then pulls him off the crowded pavement and into a narrow space between two buildings, and kisses him for a long, very sweet moment, regardless of the passers-by. Sherlock finds he doesn’t care even slightly what they might think: the only person whose opinion matters to him now is John’s. When the kiss ebbs off, Sherlock puts both hands on John’s face to draw his mouth back and John leans into him and kisses him with even more hunger, as though Sherlock’s invitation has released something in him. They’re both trying so hard, Sherlock thinks, his eyes closed as he revels in the kiss: both of them so certain that he had damaged this fragile, so-long-unspoken thing between them well beyond the point of salvation. But now they have it, and the having of it is earth-shattering.
Sherlock pours two tots of whiskey into heavy-bottomed crystal glasses that he doesn’t remember having bought. Perhaps they were a gift. (It doesn’t matter.) He carries them over to their chairs and hands one to John. “You lit the fire,” he comments.
She and I didn’t leave the country for the honeymoon. We went to Brighton. Cue Sherlock going,
They exchange looks and Kyle smiles at Todd. “He kept insisting on waiting until it didn’t seem as scandalously quick after his split from Lucas. I, of course, pointed out that the real split had already happened years ago, but you know how it is.”
Sherlock absorbs this, his lips pressing together a little. “As you said, I’ve already forgiven it,” he says. “You were angry. Perhaps you needed the outlet.”
“But you’re completely inexperienced,” John points out gently. “Age doesn’t come into it.”
John stretches hugely, turning onto his back. “I’m sorry,” he says anyway, feeling a bit sheepish. “Must have been a bit boring for you.”
Sherlock’s heart seems to swell so far he’s afraid his ribs will crack open. “I got everything so wrong,” he says, hardly able to speak. “If I had just told you, maybe we could have avoided so much of what’s happened in the past two years.”
After a little, they pull themselves up and go for a long shower, cleaning themselves and each other and getting ready for bed. The night is still young, so they watch the news in their pyjamas under the blanket from the back of John’s chair, legs intertwined on the sofa. They drink a little more of the whiskey, then finally take themselves to bed. Tomorrow, John already knows, is going to be a complicated, difficult day. They might as well enjoy this while they can. He lies in bed listening to Sherlock breathing beside him, and Rosie breathing audibly from her cot. It takes him a long time to fall asleep nonetheless, his mind turning over and over again, relentlessly, for hours.
“I thought I held that title.” Sherlock doesn’t even sound as though he’s joking. “After all I’ve put you through…”
Ella is almost holding her breath, watching them, but John nods, too. “Yeah.” His voice cracks. “And I’ll never leave you again, either. I swear it.”
The door opens and an elderly lady comes out. “If you say so, then,” she says in a heavily Scottish accent that’s underscored by doubt.
Sherlock fixes his gaze on her and gives a smile which is in no way a smile. “Closed, yes, but never solved,” he says. “Quite a high rate of failure for the same institution, wouldn’t you say? Six out of six unsolved? Surely that warrants a second look.”
Sherlock swallows. “I’ve been – yearning to see you, you know,” he confesses, still bent over me, his cock throbbing tangibly against mine. “For – ages.”
Eventually they stop, shifting wordlessly into a slightly more comfortable position, John draped over him, his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, and in a fog of hazy contentment brought on by the orgasm and too much beer both, a heavy sleep washes over Sherlock.
“I remember that,” she says, looking upset. “That was horrible. I actually saw her, just after she fell.”
“Do nothing out of the ordinary,” Mycroft orders. “But once lunch is finished, corner them in their offices and don’t let them out of your sight. Hold them there until Lestrade comes. Keep your cover, if at all possible. These are dangerous people, Sherlock. I don’t want either of you compromised, particularly if you’re separated. Is that clear, Doctor Watson?”
“Well,” Sherlock mocked.
Not acknowledged he headed up the stairs and into the bathroom, starting the water.  Hot, so hot.  Too much for him.  How did she stand it so much.
Sherlock looked at the tablet up and down.  He pulled out another one.  “Do you know...” he started, before trailing off.
The door clicked shut behind Sherlock as he left the lavatory and made his way back to his seat.  The captain came over the intercom moments later to inform the passengers that the plane was now making their final approach to Esenboğa Airport in Ankara.  Sherlock was thankful when he was finally able to stand up for good.  Airline seats were not designed for people of even average height.  The people were slow to exit the plane.  He couldn’t wait to finally get off.  He had boarded a plane at Heathrow at 6:30 that morning and even though he had almost a ninety minute layover in Istanbul, now seven hours later he was done traveling.
Sherlock looked up and realized that there weren’t any lights, but the ceiling glowed almost like it was one large LED panel.  But where was the power coming from for it?  He doubted that Richard, Greg or even John were able to hook the ceiling to the dig’s power source, which means there had to have been an independent power source that was still working millennia later.
“I just thought that I should take my time to get acquainted with them, and not just insert myself into their group.”
Sherlock was trying to concentrate on fucking Molly, but her talking was interfering.  “Mmm. Can we not?”
Mobile ringing.  Not answering.  Mobile ringing.  Still not answering.  Mobile ringing.  Mobile ringing. Ringing.  Ringing.  Ringing.  One long, continuous ring.  Not stopping.  No voicemail.  Just ringing.  His steps faster.  Going to...
The door clicked shut behind Sherlock as he left the lavatory and made his way back to his seat.

The space they were excavating wasn’t particularly big, approximately 6 metres square.  String criss-crossed the whole area, breaking it into square quadrants.  Molly stood to the side with a notebook and would direct the three men as they slowly scraped away dirt to expose bone.  The other woman sat on the edge of the shallow pit, sketching how the bones were lying as they were exposed.
“Of course not,” Greg said, putting his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders.  “Onun için endişelenme, Veli. Onunla ben ilgilenirim,” he said to the man, who relaxed a little.
“Yes,” he said definitely, and then trailed back, “...but...no?”
Standing in front of the door to 221B. Crooked knocker again.  Was he there before?  Why did it seem like he was there before?  Was it all in his head?  Repeating himself.  Or an echo.
“We think it’s a location where they would expose bodies for vultures,” she answered a little sullenly.
Sherlock whimpered slightly and started thrusting up into her, trying to take control.  He was so close now and just wanted to finish, but he started to soften as well.  He had wanted to make sure Molly got off too, but everything was crashing down on him and he didn’t care if she thought of him as selfish if he came and stopped.
“I don’t know why I got stuck with you today.  Greg came up and told me that I was to take you to my site.  I’ll tell you this: I don’t need your ‘talents’ at my site.  I do forensics...in case you missed that Greg said I was a forensic archaeologist and I have a bunch of dead people.  Bones.  You know what there isn’t?  Writings.  Or ‘cuneiforms.’” She said that last word mockingly, mimicking Sherlock’s speech. “Greg wants you to see the site, so you are going to come watch me and my team excavate bones.  And while you do that, you’re going to keep quiet so I can get my job done.”
“Is there something you found you don’t really want to tell Greg?”  She leaned down, brushing her breasts across his chest but slowed her movement to almost a standstill.  “It’s ok. You can tell me,” she whispered in his ear.
“Then I guess you can let Veli know that I won’t be going to the site today.  I’ll need to be able to print.”  Sherlock leaned back slightly.
“I’ll see what I can do,” Greg said, interrupting him, looking a little nervous.  “Get started with what you can.”  He shook his head and walked away.
Molly was silent for a minute, riding harder.  Sherlock was getting closer.  He looked up at her, but there was something about her, as though she wasn’t really into it.  “You haven’t figured out what the symbols mean?” she asked.
Sherlock rocked his head from side to side.  “Give me until the end of tomorrow.  I have a theory.”
Sally looked up and nodded at him in acknowledgment.  “Keep going,” she said to the dig team and then climbed out of the pit.  “I imagine you’re talking about Molly.  She can be a bit...intense.”
The cafeteria was already closed for the night.  After dropping off his things in his room, he walked down the hall to the conference room.  The only person in there was Sarah, who was typing on a laptop.  “Excuse me,” Sherlock said, rapping on the door frame.
Richard laughed.  “Nothing.  It’s a bunch of scribbles if you ask me.”
Sherlock watched intently as John pleasured Mary.  He watched as John deftly made Mary moan and shiver in pleasure.   He wanted to be in John’s place, doing the same for Mary.
. . .
“Wait,” Sherlock said.  Sarah turned back to him.  “What exactly is John doing here?”
“Did you confirm that?”  Sherlock replied.
John let Mary guide his mouth down to Sherlock’s cock.  He closed his lips around it and began to bob his head up and down rapidly.
He looked up.  “I don’t follow.”
John flopped back onto the floor, his hands still firmly holding his cock, and before he could move Mary settled down onto him.  Only the tip of his cock probed at her, his hands blocking more of his cock from slipping into her.  Mary moaned loudly as she ground against his cock, feeling it hard against her clit and letting the thick head rub slip slightly into her
“Well, then,” Sherlock commanded, stopping to look at him, “bedroom.  Now.”
Greg grinned.  “You’ll get used to it.”  He looked around.  “You didn’t sit with everybody I introduced you to last night.”
Jim was no more.
His eyes flew open.  Time.  He grabbed his notebook and flipped through it.  One of the cubbies he had translated had a discourse on the movement of the planets.  He went back to the article on the Antikythera mechanism.  Other than the wild idea that it originally came from an ‘earlier advanced civilisation’ the article itself was rather boring.  The leaps of logic one would have to use to reach the conclusion required a certain suspension of disbelief and the amount of the archaeological record that would need to be ignored was enormous.
Knock, knock, knock.
“The imagery that’s associated with the logograms is similar to imagery located at other Anatolian sites around 8000-5000 BCE, like Çayönü, Çatalhöyük, and Hacilar.  Without using lasers to disprove otherwise, it appears as though the logograms were painted at the same time as the pictures.”
Looking in the mirror at his rough and haggard face.
John moaned.  He throughly enjoyed how much he had to lie there and let Mary use him.  He looked up, watching her enjoy herself, grinding down on him, and all he really could was lift his hips and she controlled how much he rubbed against her.
By the time the morning sun’s faint rays slipped between the cracks in the corrugated steel walls he realized what was written on the wall.  “Fuck,” he said quietly to himself in amazement.  “Fuck,” he said louder, reviewing his notes. “Fuck, yes!” he yelled.
“Don’t worry about it,” he said.  “The Discovery isn’t exactly the pinnacle of luxury, and this one is nearly 20 years old.  The flight wasn’t bad, but this was only the third time I had been on an airplane, so I don’t really have anything to judge it by.”
“I’ve no need to,” he said, shouting a little. “It all comes to me.  Quite often people will send me a picture of something they’ve just dug up and I’ll work on the translation and send it back to them. It’s cheaper for them to do it that way, so unfortunately I really haven’t had the opportunity to do any.”
Sherlock wandered out of the cafeteria, looking around, trying to avoid the guards, before wandering about, acting as though he moving about randomly, but very carefully working his way to the building he saw John and Richard at earlier.  But as he got close to it, one of the guards came up to him.  “Nereye gidiyorsun,” the man said.
Alone in the middle of nowhere.  Shadows flitting over the ground, over him.  Ominous shadows.  Why are they ominous?  He looked to the sky to see where the shadows came from.  Nothing there.  He looked at the sun.  A vulture pictogram covered it.  He blinked.  He stood before the wall, only it was much bigger.
“Buradan ayrılmak zorundasın,” the man said, raising his voice. “Şimdi gitmelisin.”  His hand dropped to his Uzi which hung on a strap from his shoulder.
Sherlock moved his hands to his shoulders and the thrusts became more forceful.
Sherlock carefully placed the tablets back on the shelves and hurried after him.  He’d obviously been hired exactly for this sort of work, but they kept moving the goal line on him.  He couldn’t pass up this opportunity though.
“You will be here tomorrow,” Greg said as he locked the door to the building.  “Consider this your priority.”
“Is this it?  Have you found anything else at the site with this?”  he pressed.
Sherlock opened his lap top and loaded the browser.  When the password prompt appeared, he carefully typed ‘DemBones’ and he was on-line.  He shut the computer, looking forward to finally being able to make some progress.
“I’ll show you,” Sherlock said as he led John into his room.  He opened his laptop and showed him a picture of the last tablet he had been working on.  “It’s just a request for material of a certain quantity, but I can’t figure out what the material is, and while I sort of have it worked out that they want to construct chimaera, I just don’t know what that means, but that was the closest I could get using the available lexicon I have.”
They clung to each other before John slipped out of him.  “So that’s all you’ve got?” John asked.
“I don’t know what you mean,” she demurred.
“Thanks,” Greg said, uninterested.  “I’ll send these along.”
Sherlock waited patiently before finally saying, “I can do this for as long as you like.  All day if necessary.  But, when I see Greg later, I will tell him what transpired here...and then you can deal with that.”
Sherlock stared at it.  It was a metal tube with what looked like a grip at one end.  “Clearly it’s some sort of weapon, Richard.  Or should I call you Jim?”
Sherlock stares at her, wondering if she’s suddenly veered into senility within the past forty-eight hours. “You’re aware, of course, that we’ve lived here going on six years now…”
Breakfast is good. They both order Norwegian waffles, Sherlock’s with raspberry sauce, fresh raspberries, and whipped cream, John’s with sliced banana and nutella, and they order a large side of bacon and share it between them. Washing it all down with endless cups of coffee, they discuss the house and what they’re going to work on today. John manages to almost forget about the cobweb threat of Irene, which feels like a dream now in spite of the card she left behind, and he reminds himself with a fierce throb of nostalgia for the old days just how good it is to be doing anything with Sherlock again. Just the two of them, no Mary, no Rosie, no one but them. Mrs Hudson will likely pop in once or twice to make them tea, but otherwise she’ll steer clear of the noise and clutter. They eat and chat and lay plans for the day.
Sherlock makes a non-verbal sound in return and turns his face toward mine, his lips parted, eyes on my mouth rather than my eyes. “John…” His mouth finds mine then, closing the short space between us, and a moment or two later, his arms come around my back.
John gapes at him. “You think he was involved somehow? A college student/part-time prep cook?”
“Yes. You, me, and Rosie,” Sherlock tells him, waiting to see John’s reaction. Truth be told, he can reluctantly admit to himself that he would rather like to show off their newfound status to his family, appalling as he would find it to ever say that aloud.
of John’s name never making it past his teeth, a gush of fluid suddenly filling John’s mouth. He backs off just in time, swallows and swallows again, touching Sherlock throughout and urging even more of it out. Sherlock’s face is incandescent, his eyes closed, lips parted as he soundlessly rides out the wave as it grips his frame, and John loves him more fiercely than ever. When it finally passes, he goes completely limp, the breath rushing out of his lungs, his chest heaving. John pulls Sherlock into a sitting position and into his arms and they sit there on the floor, John holding him as Sherlock pants and attempts to pull himself together. After a bit, Sherlock recovers sufficiently to drag John’s mouth back to his, kissing him for a long time.
“John?”  Mary called.  John turned but she was no longer by the toys but over by a rack of lingerie.  John nervously wandered over.  She held up a sheer, red...well, he couldn’t tell what it was.  He wasn’t sure there was enough material to cover anything.  “What do you think?”
“It’s just a dig,” Greg explained.
Mary took it and examined it.  “Maybe...” she said.  “It says we can put it in the dishwasher to clean it.  That’s a good idea.”
“That would be telling,” she said and then paused.  Sherlock looked at her expectantly before she continued.  “If you don’t know who the benefactor is, then I shouldn’t tell you who the benefactor is.”
Sherlock nodded, licking his lips, desperately wanting John to be sucking his cock right now.
“Answer me!” Sherlock cried.  “Say something.”
“And you’re not.”  Jim replied.  “You can’t kill me.  Hero.  Villain.  What is the difference between the two?  Without me, there is no you.  I have to exist, I always will exist.  I am your antagonist, and I am sooooo good at antagonizing.  I do have to say I wasn’t anticipating your impulsive action in killing me.  You’re much too...calculated.”
Things began to fall into a regular pattern.  Breakfast, wall, lunch, wall, dinner.  At meals he felt as though he were being observed.  He felt a presence throughout the day, but it was more so at meals.  But when he would serendipitously observe the others, they paid scant interest in him.  John would join him for most meals, although they never spoke about anything related to work at the site; mostly John would inquire about former work and translations he had done.  Sherlock was rarely able to ask John about his background, and when he did John would answer tersely and quickly change the topic back to him.  He noted that John rarely sat with Sarah.  An interesting dynamic.  Some sort of romantic interest there, but not a particularly warm one.  Sherlock was glad for the company.  He didn’t say anything but he noticed that John had started growing a mustache.  During the day he slowly worked through the hieroglyphs, cataloging logograms. And every morning we was woken by a horrible dream.
“You just don’t get...”  Jim picked up the device and examined it briefly.  “I’m going to guess that if I handed this to you, you wouldn’t know how to work it.  And that was the problem at first, although we’ve had some success with it simply through trial and error.  Most of what we’ve accomplished has been through that.  But I’ve seen your translations, and they will help with the notebooks we have down here.”
“What do you mean?” John asked.
“Is something wrong?” Sherlock asked, keeping his voice level.
Article after article appeared about Atlantis, and in particular there seemed to be a focus on the power of Atlantis, militarily, and the weapons that Atlantis had at their disposal, including an article on a compact beam weapon that ultimately found its way into the hands of the Israelites which allowed them to conquer Canaan. “The Ark?” Sherlock asked himself incredulously.  “Did he watch one too many Indiana Jones movies?”
“I was told,” Veli growled.  “But I’m still in charge of the lock.”  He held up the key and shook it in front of Sherlock’s face, but made no move to unlock the door.
Sherlock stirred his porridge slightly. “What am I doing here?  If you’re here because of your background in Achaemenid archaeology, then there’s no need for me. The Hittite languages, sure.  There’s not that many of us who have a working knowledge of Luwian or Akkadian or even the little bit of Hattic that is known.  Later languages?  It’s not my specialty and there are others who would be better at it.”
“Cuneiformist,” Sherlock interrupted.
Sherlock tried to ignore her questions, instead focusing on the woman in his bed astride him.  It had been very enjoyable, but the questions were a distraction.
The figure reached behind his head pulled off his mask.  “What makes you think I can give you what you want?” John asked.
“Do you prefer to work in silence too?” he asked her.
Sherlock politely said, “Hi,” gesturing with his hand.
Greg looked up at him.  “What is?”
Sherlock rarely ventured away from the British Isles; his last trip abroad had been after Uni when his parents had encouraged him to go on holiday to America.  He only ended up going because they paid his way.  Otherwise, he would rather have begun his new job almost immediately.  He was quite comfortable teaching his classes and working on a variety of translations in his office.  Traveling this far abroad was quite a change of pace for him.
The last person sat slouched in his chair.  His black hair was slicked back and he had a slight sneer as he watched Sherlock walk in.  Sherlock didn’t like him.  He couldn’t put his finger on it, but his senses were telling him to be wary of that man.
John blushed, and then said.  “I was hoping to find out how things were going on your end.  Anything you can work out can only help us.”
He was only able to get through the first tablet before he realized it was soon dinner time. These tablets seemed to be an administrative report, addressed to Inara, about some sort of material that Hupašiya had required.  Whatever the material was, it was needed by Wurunkatte to construct chimaera.   This was a myth he wasn’t familiar with.
“Sherlock!” Richard called.  “Come join us.”  Sherlock walked over to the group.  “I was just telling everybody about the amazing logograms you’ve deciphered.”
There was no talking.  He placed his hand on the bed, knowing what would come next.  Sherlock pressed his body against him, his muscles taut, his ragged breath was hot on his shoulder as one of his hands spread his buttocks and the other held his cock, probing until it pushed into him, not much resistance, but some.  Sherlock’s hands went to his hips as his cock stretched him open as it slid deep into him.
Jim put the tube down and walked over to a cabinet along the wall.  He opened it, and pulled out a block, and dropped it on the table in front of Sherlock.  Sherlock reached out and lifted the top.  It was a book. Only it was made of thin, metal pages instead of paper.  His eyes scanned quickly the logograms that filled the page and he began to quickly flip through them, going through as many of the pages as quickly as possible.  The logograms themselves were not uniform nor always neatly spaced, as though somebody had written them into the metal.  He rubbed his finger over them.  There were no sharp edges or burrs.
