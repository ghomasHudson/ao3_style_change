‘Recently’ was the one that stood out to him right then, mainly because that could mean either within the window of this whole ordeal or somewhere before then.
Well, relatively quiet. John had had to tell Sherlock that no, Ludo was in fact not intended to be a group of murdering thieves trying to escape with the loot and kill each other on the way, so that you got more loot and notoriety, which the brunet found patently absurd.
The question, one of the important ones, at least, was; would Sherlock, if he’d been in a state to realise what was happening, had put a stop to it? Yes, it had filled him with joy and contentment, he wasn’t questioning that in the slightest. But the knowledge that he had thereby allowed a courtship ritual, one that was innate and partially instinctual, to begin, would that have been enough to make him stop it? Without alerting John to what was really going on, of course.
He looked at his brother, asking for help with his eyes and his demeanour. With more or less everything other than his words because there was some things that just wasn’t possible right then.
His own distress was not entirely suppressed, unfortunately, but it smelled significantly different than hers.
“Yes, love?” John said. He didn’t expect the words to be reciprocated. Later, certainly, but not right now, and that was just fine. He was saying it in all but words, in any case, and was evidently somewhat overwhelmed, in a positive sense, by the admission.
It was warm and soft, wistful, yearning and hopeful, corresponding perfectly with the way he still played the melody. It made you believe that the journey was worth taking, however long, winding or big it got as you walked because you were progressing. In the end, the hope won out.
I liked writing the thoughts of Sherlock on this - and well, all of it, really. Next chapter I hope won't take as long but I don't want to promise something I might not be able to keep.
“Okay, then,” John said, once they’d settled him down onto the mattress. He didn’t look at the elder Holmes “Make him shift back.”
Sherlock’s mind, taxed already even by his standards after everything, spluttered and whizzed as it tried to work out what was happening. His body, though not in a much better state than his brain, did seem to catch on a little better, though. At least enough to reciprocate to some extent.
“There’s only four of you in the sixth form, one’s on holiday and another’s doing a solo act. Besides, I think you’ll like him.”
One had to hand it to the driver, however, that they could find a parking spot very close to the entrance indeed. Well, at least no airport personnel came up to tell them they couldn’t park there, even though John was rather sure he’d seen ‘NO PARKING’ painted large and white over the exact spot they were in.
The fact that he joined in managed to, as it also so often did for people, strengthen John’s own giggle into a full-blown laugh that admittedly had a brittle edge. But it was an honest to goodness laugh, almost liberating in its own way. It certainly felt that way to Sherlock as he joined in the proper laughing, too.
He still did not believe that it had anything to do with the…the physical side of things, as it were. The instinct-driven stuff. The times he’d met Moriarty had been so very…it had been mind games and manipulations, or attempts thereof, with the strings of Alpha plucked only for the fun and variety of it, as it were, not as the whole purpose.
He didn’t need to convince him because John already trusted him. Even when Sherlock had made it clear why he shouldn’t, before he’d gone into his Mind Palace, John had stood firm, hadn’t he? Declared that he trusted him, even, unrelenting and yet kind.
“Oh, I don’t know,” he answered, smiling sweetly. “I think that I’ve been rather good at sharing, especially lately.”
“He collects people, doesn’t he?” he said. It wasn’t really a question. “That’s part of the reason why he’s settled himself in the position of a ‘minor government official’ instead of being Prime Minister or whatever. Collecting people is a lot easier in the apparently lower echelons where everybody expects everything and nothing of you as they try to climb the greasy pole and you don’t necessarily recognise an eminence grise.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t know for certain. It could be any of a dozen motivations or none at all, except that he is bored, and it relieves the boredom. If I were to hazard an educated guess, however, I’d say that he was savouring you. There have been several Omegas found with seemingly no clue to who they were or were they came from.”
It was the second to last thing Sherlock had ever – that Sherlock had said to him before he’d collapsed. The last thing that had made any sort of sense. Even now, it managed to be both a relief and yet, somehow, which made absolutely no sense, also slightly a sting.
John, who’d been about to make a comment about how he probably thought he knew but didn’t, clicked his mouth shut hard and grimaced instead.
Sherlock watched his brother leave, his head a throbbing, dizzying swirl of half-formed thoughts, half-remembered snippets and confused but genuine emotions.
Not that he wouldn’t do everything in his power to make sure this proposal went off as well and as smoothly as possible so that John would see it for what it was and would be happy to accept. But if it…if it failed, then – he fought the still too-horrible thought but this time, fought to keep it in his mind rather than out of it – then he shouldn’t be…be…
He continued by saying that John should take care of him, but the Alpha should take care of John, too. This was a region with a lot of…lonely couples and it could be…well, it was something to be mindful of, in any case. Just, word to the wise man and all that.
“I was hardly in a position to have long discussions or for Mycroft’s usually obtuse references to work for me,” he protested. “He could have reminded me that water was wet or that gold was dangerous, and I would have been as likely to have been able to remember or draw use from his hinting as that turned out to be!”
The split-second but rapid and extensive expansion of the pupil didn’t go unnoticed, as he was watching for it.
Multiples weren’t as common as the media would have you believe, though. Especially romcoms that leaned on the maternal angle would have the Omega in question either be from a large litter with a doting Omega mother or they would entrance the Alpha with their fertility. Sometimes they would even stoop so low as to have the Alpha utter something along the lines of ‘You smell so wonderful and fertile; I know you’ll give me a large litter’.
In any case, his focus was elsewhere. Namely on the screen which showed a rather grainy image that was almost impossible to make sense of.
Sherlock wouldn’t be requiring him to stay in, not when he himself wasn’t in. Well, technically it was possible, but it was unlikely.
The group of three that was up on stage now was the last ones before it was his turn and though they’d elected to put music to The Jabberwocky, of all poems to pick – then again, someone thought it a good idea to recite Kubla Khan, probably purely for ‘literary credit’ or something , so it wasn’t as though it was unprecedented – it wouldn’t take them long to finish.
He bowed, with as much flourish as he could provide, keeping his head up as he did so. Beside him, he saw, out of the corner of his eye, John bow as well, a little more awkwardly, but willingly following Sherlock’s lead.
He had to prevent himself from putting his hand on the small of his back. Not because it was such a traditional Omega gesture, although it was, but because he hardly had the right yet.
Than he would’ve thought possible. For a moment, just one crucial moment, the fear in his hand pulsing gently but somehow burning still, he believed, truly believed that the dragon had got out of its captive state, despite everything that he’d done, and had merely lain dormant in an attempt to fool him and lull him into a false sense of security.
“Which means that London won’t just in all likelihood have a beast on their hands, but all your struggles and your sacrifice will have been for naught as well. So that means we’ll all have lost.”
Actually, to be perfectly honest, if it came to that, he wasn’t entirely certain that John would’ve stayed if there hadn’t been the issues with the wounds infected with dragon bone dust. His medical training would’ve kicked in, in that situation, overriding other concerns, which had bought Sherlock some time and sympathy.
The former soldier’s somewhat more openly aggressive attitude when they’d run into him going to retrieve the documents would’ve been influenced by the scent bond, his pregnancy, the stress of the situation in general and, of course, the fact that Moriarty had tried to touch his stomach.
Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to have soured things for Moriarty. At least, not in the same way. Which, in a way, was probably just as well, since if he were truly, genuinely disappointed in Sherlock, there was every possibility that he would take that disappointment out on something or someone, and not necessarily on the consulting detective. In fact, almost certainly not.
“Maybe not in the traditional sense but you’re pale and you’re swaying a little, now that I can see you,” John said, a possibility dawning on him.
John took the decision out of his hands somewhat; he bridged the distance between them, quickly sat down the guitar he’d clutched in one hand against one of the stair’s balusters, then, after a weighted moment’s hesitation, he wrapped his arms around the taller teen in a hug.
“Just thought you’d in for a social visit at a stranger’s flat, is it? Never mind that it’s up a flight of stairs and the door was locked, though, that’s just a minor detail. If you won’t tell me, then you can ever so kindly
But he had to risk it, didn’t he? There was no proper substitute for a proposal and a wedding, a marriage even if it was at the town hall rather than in a church, to signify that your feelings were…
At the same time, it didn’t feel quite as wrong as it ought to. It ought to feel violating. But it didn’t. Wrong, yes, but not that strongly so, which probably ought to be worrying in itself.
To look at Sherlock, really. Just take a moment to properly drink him in, without the need to do anything else. What he and Mycroft had talked about could, and had to, wait until the brunet was awake in any case.
Still, he didn’t have to care, and it was hardly something that was going to benefit him if he did, so there’d be little point in pushing his views onto Sherlock.
John was looking at him attentively, head cocked to one side as he listened, the smile in his eyes and on his lips warm and…happy?
When he did, he did something very close to startling but before he could get very far, he was halted again but this time, it wasn’t by any kind of furniture.
“What now? Will he recover the rest of the way on his own, now?” He paused as something else occurred to him. “Did you get it?”
Then he heard his phone vibrate. It was still in the jeans pocket he’d had it in when he’d undressed before going to bed, for whatever reason that he couldn’t quite grasp right then, and the noise of it vibrating against the denim and carpet had somehow slid into his ears.
“– But I’m not sure I was ready to admit it, to myself or to you, not before. I never wanted to lose you.”
In fact, he’d probably think worse of him for being a dragon than he would for thinking he might’ve said something like that.
The shears went in surprisingly easy, but perhaps that was merely because he’d expected something to stop him, whether it be the heaviness of the fabric itself or some sort of barrier that tried to protect possessions from harm. It sounded ludicrous but then again, this whole bloody thing was ludicrous.
“Quite. Take away all of that and then answer me this; would you want to be in a relationship with Sherlock? A full, intimate, emotional, physical, romantic relationship, that is, knowing what kind of man he is. Not dragon. Man.”
And wasn’t that a somewhat worrying account of events, too? Either the Beta, Michel, had lied to them and she had woken up, in which case she would’ve picked up on those scents and general atmosphere around them – children were always far more adept at sussing atmospheres and general moos than adults gave them credit for – and made at the very least a fuss.
There was silence in the car for a little while as they wound their way through traffic, getting ever closer to the airport.
Is four weeks acceptable as a wait? Well, not much to be done if it isn't. I've done my best to get it out, though, sorry if that shows.
In any case, they had reached the bedroom of the daughter at that point and the Alpha’s priority quickly became something other than to look for clues.
Sherlock has to navigate them home safely over densely populated London, with a doctor in his arms who is neither content nor quiet. He has questions to answer then and even more when they make it home. That is not all they have to contend with, though...
The question was, why had he woken in the first place? He didn’t need to relieve himself, he hadn’t had a nightmare, there had been no sudden noises, and Sherlock hadn’t, as far as he could tell, done anything that could set off anything latent inside John.
So, he turned back to the Beta and Omega on the doorstep. He couldn’t help but note that while John had few medical supplies with him and those had been intended for other purposes, he had immediately taken out what he had that could be useful in treating…
“Don’t lie to me, Mycroft,” he said, and not even his voice was the snap it’d normally be when talking back to his brother or refuting a stupid point in general. It was much quieter, much more sincere. Much more unnerving. “I can smell the blood on both you and John, and not much of it is mine, at least not on John. I can also recognise claw marks when I see them, particularly my own, and you’d be wilfully blind not to spot John wincing, quite apart from what he said just before.”
Sherlock and John stumble into the discussion of whether or not more children is an option, John's contribution to saving his child and in general a bit of future talk.
To say it and feel the truth of it, something out of joint sliding into place and settling unmovably yet easily, a truth that had always been present, even if he hadn’t seen it or acknowledged it.
He felt the rope shake hard, the soft threads of it digging into his hand as it was yanked with a force that he hadn’t previously experienced.
There was a small urge to close his eyes, out of concentration rather than nervousness. There was quite a bit riding on getting this right, after all.
John settled himself against the shed, sliding down it until he sat with his legs spread, knees bent and his guitar in his lap. He grinned up at the other teen, a wry half-grin.
from something like that. Or rather, he would have, had it not been for the look in the doctor’s eye that glued his mouth together and tightened his oesophagus.
As far as he was concerned, it could think whatever it wanted and behave however it liked. It wouldn’t change one iota of what he intended to do. What was going to happen, which would happen, too.
No, the exhausted expression that managed to extend to the rest of the body, somehow, told its own story, one that he had trouble imagining even Sherlock could pull off.
He didn’t want the other to ever feel like he was clinging or smothering him, or otherwise controlling him, a fear which bled over even into a situation like this, at least right then and there.
In the same breath he asked Sherlock whether they were going up or down here at this fork in the road. To which the brunet replied that they needed to go up for about three kilometres then then to the west and down again for another two kilometres, adding that they would do it properly and formally at a later point but that it was kind of him to ask.
Having your history laid out like that was still not exactly pleasant. It did help, however, in a somewhat strange way, knowing that there was no malice behind the baring of such things, no hidden agenda for why he did it. It was just Sherlock being Sherlock, and it was a mild version of that, to boot.
Anything that could possibly help him secure that his flatmate stayed with him, and not because of Moriarty’s machinations and designs, he would be willing to do. Anything.
His phone rang, the noise of it shrill in the eerie stillness that had descended on the flat in the wake of the earlier muted commotion.
Perhaps it was also a factor that this wasn’t some random person or even just someone he’d managed to form an emotional connection with. This was John. His John, which made it significant all on its own.
He was about in the right place, though, for him to stand just perfect for seeing what Sherlock’s contact had come up with as a substitute after the fire. Which, while not what he’d had in mind at all, was everything she’d said it would be, including better than the original.
For another, there were impressions on the cheek that faced John which could only come from having slept on that for some considerable time.
up the stairs, which was easily accessible by the landing, without needing to go into the rest of the flat. Of course, Sherlock could transform and break through the floor but if he slept soundly, which he was quite confident that he would, it was within the sliver of possibility that Moriarty would reach John before Sherlock could transform and get there.
“Yes, I bloody well do.” He glanced out the window, then back. Undoubtedly assessing just what time it was. It was about time he got something to tell the time with, like a proper watch or a phone. “It’s already far past – why did you let me sleep that long?”
He bit into the toast, noted vaguely that he’d burnt it and yet it was somehow soggy, and promptly sat about wolfing it down. Eating wasn’t a priority, for him, and what it happened to taste like was completely irrelevant.
The Alpha proved him right when he came closer and lowered his voice. “You are not weak for finding it difficult to cope with this right now, nor is it a failure for you to back away. It’s a tactical retreat, not running away.”
The Alpha, who hadn’t moved from the door opening but had instead started to lean on the door frame with one shoulder, grinned down at him, which showed off the slightly yellowed but straight teeth and, more importantly, the slightly longer than usual incisors.
Sherlock’s face scrunched up in surprised confusion. “What do you mean, ‘wrong’? It’s the only possible solution with the criteria you’ve laid out.” John only continued to smile. “You can’t go changing who the culprit is in the middle of the game, John.”
He tried not to let on his surprise, and his grip on the thread didn’t waver. That had hurt and had hurt quite significantly at that.
The hand around his wrist was still as tight as ever, despite the limp and unresponsive body, which only added to the confusion. Why could he do that? Why was he doing it? Why grab John’s and not Mycroft, who’d been equally close at the time and was, after all, his brother? Surely, in such a case, even for dragons, familial connections ought to matter more.
“Mine,” the wyvern hissed again, the breath gusting across John’s throat in its proximity. He thought he could feel the tip of pointed teeth start to press ever so slightly against the already abused skin of his throat.
John stopped the warning mostly because he thought he heard a groan from the other side of the ‘door’. He therefore missed the answer as he tried to look in without moving too much.
‘Not yet. That’s actually why I’m texting you.’ Honestly, why he hadn’t called him instead…and he knew why, of course, but it was a whole lot quicker to call. ‘I know which object I need for…but I can’t find it anywhere.’
Though as crumpled as the bibs had been, the fabric was larger and of a much less gender-neutral colour than they were. In fact, it was the most vivid cherry red, with just a few hints of admittedly faded white visible in the small heap.
He gave a small huff of unamused laughter with another step. ”Then again, Sherlock’s taken an ashtray before now, and a tiepin, too, to add to his collection. That’s what all the kleptomania’s really been about, isn’t it? Appeasing the inner dragon.”
“Curiosity, mostly. That and if I’m going to be part of that world from now on, in whatever capacity, which seems uncomfortably likely even if you’re not the most…if I am, then I’d like to know if everyone is going to be…”
The anger that had been steadily coming closer and closer to the boil inside the doctor’s mind suddenly switched off. Or rather, it became an icy calm.
“John, as a doctor, you must realise that the health and wellbeing of your patient comes before any personal considerations.”
The unbidden thought of Moriarty pushing along a shopping trolley was somewhat amusing. At least, until it morphed into that of the dark-haired Irishman pushing a pram or a pushchair along instead, with a child inside. A blue-eyed, blond child in a lovely little dress.
The version of his Alpha in front of him right now was the more important issue, though, as the words seemed to have short-circuited something in that massive brain; he stared at John and kept blinking as though that would somehow reboot the system.
I did consider stopping at Sherlock pushing through but felt that a bit too short for a chapter, not to mention that the other bit needed to be in here, too.
“But only up to a certain point, I’m guessing. Which in turn would be something to do with sexual intercourse in some way or another or you wouldn’t mention it at all.”
Yes, so he had known that he had a hold of it beforehand, or the dragon would’ve reared its head, metaphorically speaking, and taken violent and possibly ultimate, irreversible control the moment he faltered in any way, he knew that without a shadow of doubt. If nothing else, then as revenge for what he had done to it.
“Now you’re trying to make me annoyed, which I will not accept. You are that, and that’s good and very useful, but you’re so much more than that,” and Sherlock circled the other’s waist, drawing him close, “and I may be biased in many aspects, but I’ve known that since I first saw you.”
So…he’d changed clothes between the blond leaving and returning. Probably. Because of whoever it was that had come calling? But who would that be?
Current state? Why was there a ‘current’ state to contend with in the first place and what was it, precisely?
When they parted, it was Sherlock who pulled back first. He did it slowly and carefully, savouring it.
The notion, the hope that it didn’t have something to do with Tessa, or at least with the girl they believed was Tessa, that it was mere coincidence or otherwise unconnected was…well, a hope at this point, if even that. Sherlock had known the moment the door had opened.
Granted, he had passed through them once on his way down, able to shut them out as he did so. But as the dragon woke and subsequently started to move, or perhaps more precisely by this point, thrash, they’d started to clamour, too, and as they were part of his makeup, this deep down, he couldn’t remain as unaffected. Not when he was tired, with such an important thing in his grasp, as well.
He trailed off, the way his face worked for a moment managing to convey at least some of the inner frustration he was trying to keep a lid on, somehow. It did the trick, admittedly, but it also highlighted that it wasn’t just the concern of how Sherlock’s self-restraint was affecting that plagued his mind.
Whichever it was, the fragility of it, especially after the strength, control and utter determination he had just displayed, wrapped itself around John’s heart and squeezed hard.
He heard the intake of breath and saw the pupil contract to a slit at the insult, though more the latter than the former.
Then it was very difficult indeed to discern what was going on underneath the surface, even for Sherlock, it appeared.
The calmness was authentic enough, as was the kind of tension that was, at least in part, fuelling it and preparing the muscles for if something were to happen. Not enough to attract attention from anyone but enough that Sherlock could sense it.
A hand was on his back suddenly, running gently up and down while a voice clad in cotton said something along the lines of ‘easy, I’ve got you, easy, just…easy’.
There was no anger or annoyance at being played to, a song that wasn’t what they were supposed to be doing, or indication that he knew the brunet was showing off.
It emphasised, underlined and highlighted those feelings in the glow that they weren’t unrequited. That John did indeed feel about Sherlock the way he’d refused to admit to himself he’d felt about the doctor, and he had not changed his mind in all that they’d been through.
He held his breath as he waited. For a moment, he’d thought of going for his gun but had decided it as for one thing, it was up in his bedroom as normal, and, more importantly, he’d seen how little effect bullets had on a dragon, ones without special coating, anyway.
The expression wasn’t for them, either. The man would’ve had the same expression for anyone who came to his door so soon after this had happened to him, regardless of the number or look of them, or even the scent of them.
As he gradually got nearer – a quick jab at it would run the risk of alerting it far more than a slow approach, the movement sensed where his presence might not, due to him being it and vice versa – the energy coming off it felt progressively stronger and more oppressive. It was as though it was trying to browbeat him into submission while at the same time, also trying to seep in and convince him that he was better off with the dragon in charge. That he’d let it lie dormant, suppressed and muzzled, for far too long, and just look where it had gotten him.
“I ought to do right by her, not by me. That’s what being a parent is truly about, isn’t it? Putting your children and their well-being, their happiness, before your own. Doing the best you can for them as much as you possibly can, and I’m not…I can’t work out whether I am doing that by coming to rescue…to
Uncomfortable and alarming as that was, what sent a strong, involuntary shiver down his spine was the handwritten part of the paper. The ones in the margins were related to the details on the child, comments and speculations that were rather uncomfortably in-depth. They were also written in French.
The older Alpha hadn’t argued the point, thankfully, and so John had slept peacefully, or at least deeply, through the last hour and a half that the brunet had moved about in the flat, as quietly as possible, getting things ready for them.
Mycroft’s mouth twisted and his fingers drummed on the carved handle of the ever-present umbrella, displaying a quite uncharacteristic amount of annoyance and impatience. Not that he wasn’t necessarily feeling either or both of those at other times, but it wasn’t normally this…easily visible, as it were. Which probably showed just how fed up he was at this point.
Which certainly was a turnup for the books – and really ought to mean that his focus was on the here and now, not hypotheticals and speculations.
Pale eyes turned to him, and there was something in them that he couldn’t decipher. It wasn’t bad, exactly, but it was a little…puzzling. Then they turned away again.
He wanted to say, ‘it’s not, how can you say that?’ but realised that wasn’t his call to make. It could be argued that she was only saying it for his benefit but even if that was the case, it still wouldn’t be his call to make, as it wasn’t about him. Whatever the reason, how could he take away what little autonomy she had?
“This…wasn’t something acquired by any of my employees. It was found in amongst the dross of papers that find its way to my PA’s desk and delivered directly to me. Where it comes from, nobody knows, and neither can anyone tell me who has brought it.” The note of repressed annoyance was evident. “It is being investigated as we speak.”
Well, Moriarty had been the one to out to Sherlock, as it were, that John was pregnant, and he’d made some sort of reference to an expected invitation to a baby shower or something like that when he left. To remind John of that like this was uncomfortable, odd and more than a little creepy but hardly important enough to send someone to deliver it, at least someone he employed rather than just a courier.
He’d made some comment about John’s horribly noble doctor soul at that and John had been about to cuff him for it, until he saw the half smile and the corners of eyes creasing. Then he downgraded it to a light swat.
I don't know, it felt right to end the chapter here. Hopefully it'll feel like something's happened.
No, not hers, he agreed, and watched her retreat. Not physically, but then, she didn’t need to, and he pressed on before his treacherous, unpredictable heart could bring him into more trouble than it already had. Not like John was her mother. That was impossible, sadly, but it didn’t mean that he didn’t consider himself hers.
John tilted his head up at that and lifted both eyebrows, mostly in defiance. That wasn’t true. Though, he had thought that about the interest being based around his friendship with Sherlock, hadn’t he? Bloody hell, what if he could read minds? Could dragons do that? He wouldn’t have thought so but then again, if you’d asked him half an hour previously, he wouldn’t have thought dragons were real, either.
Sherlock soon learned just why Mr. Duffy had been so pleased with the choice of song. Not only was the piece itself well-suited to performance, the lyrics were a poem that had been put to music. Furthermore, the poem came from one of the man’s favourite books – The Lord of the Rings.
But it would perhaps explain why he had been unwilling to sleep for long. It definitely wasn’t because he didn’t
The jab wasn’t all that harsh and all it did was earn a raised ginger eyebrow. The elder brother inclined his head in the direction of the doctor in farewell, then turned on his heel and walked back out of the flat, the tapping of the umbrella a counterpoint to the tread of his brogues.
Even the knowledge that they must’ve been desperate for a child to reach the point of resorting to methods like accepting a child from a harem without any formal documentation didn’t have to negate that.
Oh, it was born and fed by emotions and many of the very worst of them at that, but it didn’t exist in his heart. In his soul, maybe, but not his heart, not truly. It was a parasite on it, for all that it was an integral part of him, and it…
Trying not to close it immediately, to not show that it irked him that much. Or perhaps not irked, as that implied annoyance which wasn’t the case at all. It was more true to say that it worried him, and that mainly because of the current situation.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue…then closed it again. Because, that was what he’d been doing, wasn’t it? Trying to push it down as far as he could, ignore what he was, find a way to control it and push it away entirely. For the sake of keeping John safe, or perhaps, purely to keep him there with him.
Despite the words, or perhaps exactly because of them, their phrasing, he did his best to keep his voice gentle and quiet. Which was possibly manipulative on its own and therefore a further step backwards. It wasn’t meant to be, however, a fact which hopefully counted for something, too.
That admiration, however, faded somewhat in the face of the knowledge that he’d employed those skills to kidnap his flatmate and shield him, too. Shield him so well, in fact, he was impossible to detect, even for Sherlock.
That was rather sweet, really, and a shot of normalcy that he honestly wasn’t quite used to yet. At least, he wasn’t used to it also applying to
I also hope that all this talking with Sherlock comes off as IC and just character-development. I don't know, though.
A shudder ran through Sherlock at that and he pushed his hands underneath the newly bought jumper and shirt, running over skin.
So, get a move on. Sherlock wouldn’t be asleep forever, and John knew from what Mycroft had alluded to that it was crucial to find the watch before the other woke, even though it was highly unlikely he was going to stop him. His instincts might kick in, however, and he wouldn’t see it in the same light as he would if he should…
As the appendage disappeared behind the sharp teeth again, the expression in the dragon’s eyes turned a little thoughtful, if not outright puzzled, which was odd.
Granted, John already bore a rather major part of the friendship, Sherlock could admit that if only to himself at the moment, far more than most would put up with. But even so, it would be a rather different thing to ask for it to be so much on his shoulders if they advanced to the next level.
Even so, he couldn’t help making a mental note to somehow get to visit them soon. Not that he thought he’d be prevented, either by his Alpha or his brother, but there seemed to be so many things that needed sorting, and with the threat that the owners still posed…with the threat
“How else would you have phrased it, then? To not mention her would only delay the shock, not prevent it, and barging in straight with what we have discovered would only be likely to make the shock greater.”
The blond didn’t try to push it further into an open-mouthed kiss, however, seemingly content with alternating pressure and angles as they kissed. Not that Sherlock minded, and not only because he was afraid of being a disappointment.
,” he said and that came out as more of an accusation than an explanation. “It’s not that difficult a concept that I should want to kiss you back, is it?”
It was slow but then it ought to be. Sherlock took the opportunity, as he wasn’t supposed to join before the second playthrough of the melody, to just watch the other teen, noting the concentration but also the…reverence, the quiet joy etched into his entire face as the fingers glided gently but confidently over the strings, the music flowing almost effortlessly from him.
The Alpha raised an eyebrow but at the same time, the corner of his lips quirked. “Perhaps just a little.”
“No,” he said. “No, I don’t believe that, and neither do you. Otherwise, you would still be deep in your Mind Palace, making sure.”
“Why – for the same reason I would never have thought you interested in a relationship in the first place, among others.”
She followed his movements with her eyes but nothing else seemed to move. No, that wasn’t quite right; her lips were moving, too, but the movement was small enough to be difficult to make out from any distance.
Why hadn’t he made the connection that the boy obviously was his age, worked at the newsagent’s, of all places, so more likely to be from the village than not, and therefore undoubtedly went to the local comprehensive? He knew he didn’t attend this school; his jumper and jeans were worn and faded in a way that said overuse, for one. There were other indicators, too, none of which signified the parental financial situation needed to attend a public school.
Sherlock felt the harsh expelling of breath as John tried to calm himself down. He also felt the hands on his back, which had been clenched hard in the fabric of his coat, loosen a little before John pulled back far enough that they could look each other in the eye.
Yes. It no doubt was, much as that hurt to realise, let alone admit. The indignance was born of hurt, too, but John was well within his rights, for lack of a better term, to show some disbelief at what was happening in front of him.
John just managed to start smiling in relief and joy when Sherlock blinked, and the eyes returned to their dragon-state. The nostrils flared and the lips pulled back further, in a parody of a smile.
When the eyes reached their normal placement, they blinked again to bring themselves into a better focus. John stared intently at them for any minute hint that the dragon was in fact lurking behind those eyes whose mishmash of colours he’d come to adore. That it had managed to tag along for the ride and was about to spring free once the connection between mind and body had been properly re-established.
That Moriarty had sent them those things wasn’t a deciding factor, though. Yes, that fitted, but it could have been created or doctored, just to mess with them.
Of course, and he knew neither of them wanted to contemplate that, that was based on the supposition that she would be a normal child, with a child’s normal curiosity and lack of thought to consequences, which landed them in all kinds of interesting situations.
All of that in turn meant Sherlock was prepared for it. The aggression, that was, if they at any point ran into the consulting criminal. ‘Ran into’ was of course the entirely wrong way of describing that potential encounter, as that had the casual feel of an accidental meeting in the supermarket.
Sherlock let it slide, as there was no heat in the comment, only warmth, which seemed to transfer over to him. He sat down and, being a little daring, chose to sit quite close beside the other teen. Not so close that they were touching but certainly closer than acquaintanceship would normally dictate.
A game that he could grow tired of any moment, especially if there wasn’t a set ‘end-time’ like there would be on a visit, long or shot.
problem, was that he couldn’t think of where or what that could possibly be. Nowhere seemed safe. Also, apart from every other point he’d thought of earlier, there was another risk to consider, and that was Moriarty.
Yet it wasn’t wrong for the Omega to promise there’d be enough for her as well as her siblings. It was about the only right thing to do, especially in the circumstances.
“Because I’m a berk,” he said eventually, “and I should’ve been clearer in my actions instead of actually being the one who’s strung you along instead. I didn’t mean to hurt you like that.”
“It might of course have been that it effected both sides, as it were, but I somehow don’t really think so. Not least because it would’ve quieted the rest of the mind, the higher brain functions, and consequently, that must’ve opened the gate and taken off the shackles for you to come through and take over. You could’ve done that, but you wouldn’t have let go once you’d gotten hold – if you really were that powerful, that is.”
But not this. Not just because they’d talked about it, though possibly not quite as much as they ought to have, or because Sherlock knew what the repercussions could be, but because the brunet had made an honest effort to listen and remember. He still made mistakes, of course, for various reasons. For all that he tried to deny it, though not as vehemently these days, he was still very much human. But John knew his consulting detective at this point, when he stopped to think about it rather than let his frustration get the better of him.
“His colleagues could hear, though, or at least his neighbour could. There was a slight sound that would indicate the volume is wrong. In any case, you could see her pause on the way past him, her head tilted. She’ll have plenty to tell her friends over tomorrow’s lunch.”
Isn’t that a bit reach coming from you, though?” he asked, but the frown had smoothed into nothingness.
Interestingly, though, her gaze did not stay permanently on one thing, such as her daughter. Nor did it even stay on it for very long. Instead, it moved, slowly but surely, between all the people she could see from where she sat in her chair, back and forth, almost like she was an animatronic programmed to have her head move like that.
That wasn’t to say that they could move easily forward from there once Sherlock regained consciousness, though. If neither of them was aware, either one or the other had no desire to act on it or it was genuinely born out of platonic feelings of friendship which had crossed Sherlock’s wires somehow, then it wasn’t a straightforward case.
Of course it could. He was being silly and unsure, second-guessing his thoughts, and while there was an explainable reason for that, it didn’t stop it being unhelpful and stupid.
It took a few long moments before he got an answer and when he did, his voice was not only hesitant, it was small and a little pained. “Don’t…please…I…I can’t…please…”
Also, to be honest, he couldn’t say that he hadn’t become something less than the ‘ideal’ he’d aspired to, before he had met Sherlock. Not that he was less of an Omega or less of a person on that account, he wasn’t buying into that nonsense. But he’d been beholden to others, most of them Alphas, all the while he’d been in the harem – and he’d signed on for that, voluntarily!
“Was that your plan from the off, then?” John continued, completely ignoring, or possibly not hearing, Sherlock’s utterance of his name. “To just get this whole thing over with and then disappear, stringing me along in the process?”
Then they got to the part where there was supposed to be singing. Sherlock obligingly stopped, expecting John to carry on as he had before, just playing. A part of him was still concerned that Duffy would think of it as not fulfilling the brief but hoped that John said not to worry about it because he’d spoken to the teacher about it earlier, and if not that, then perhaps they’d be excused given the blond’s obvious state.
“All the other experiences I’ve had, that desire has clawed its way to the surface sooner or later, normally sooner, and I’ve had to stop so as not to accidentally do it while in the throes of it.”
He felt a touch on his hip, sliding upwards over his bare stomach. It was soft and ought to have been hard to feel, if not be ticklish. Instead, the palm touching his skin felt reassuring and, when it pressed a little more firmly, rather grounding.
His focus was entirely on the Omega, who had to stop outside the room and…try not to take a deep breath so as not to stagger as he was affected by the concentrated scent of the girl.
This shouldn't be horrible, I think, but if I've misjudged and people dealing with fall-outs of such experiences bothers you (which I'm not judging if it does, at all), feel free to skip the chapter. It's not graphic but...I'd rather be safe.
He didn’t know. Or at least, he couldn’t catch the haze of the general idea about it enough to form it into a coherent argument.
Then realisation seemed to dawn for him, in one sudden swoop, and he pulled back, dropping his hands quickly.
For once silently thankful for the number of seemingly useless things that had accumulated in the flat even while he’d been there, a pair of tailor’s scissors chief among them, John moved so the opened cutters were kissing the expensive woollen fabric as well as some of the lining.
“The bones of a dragon are much denser than that of almost any other being on the planet. Why is irrelevant in the circumstances but once you know the texture, it’s easy to distinguish.”
This was Moriarty, however, and while he wasn’t the strongest of people, let alone Alphas, he more than made up for that with his mind.
His gaze passed over something as he made the decision, though, and he made an amendment; he would make one purchase and then he would head home.
It was getting dark by the time John returned to 221B. He’d decided to spend the day out; it was a day off for him, anyway, there wasn’t a case on, and he’d rather get a bit of fresh air and some distance than blow up at his flatmate.
“If you’re going to say something along the lines of ‘things that cannot be fixed’, then I’m going to either slap you or call Mycroft, whichever is worse. You’ve fought so hard since we…since it all started. What’s different now?”
So…things accumulated in 221B and John got used to it, as he got used to the rest of this topsy-turvy, helter-skelter life he led with his flatmate, none of which he’d really trade for anything. He even started to add the odd bits and bobs every now and then, too, things he found interesting or pleasing. Though it might be fun to annoy Sherlock, he’d have to cope with it, too, and so he tried to find something good.
I...I don't even know what to say except a humble but heartfelt thank you for all the stupendous, utterly heartwarming comments I got on the last chapter. I think I cried once or twice. You're the best audience I could ask for. :3
But the sweet dorkiness of the look, freed from the airs and shields he put on while awake, brought home what Mycroft had talked about. That what mattered was how John felt, how they both felt, when they stripped away the dragon and all its mess.
“You berk,” he said, and his tone was beyond fond. “I was bloody afraid you’d been kidnapped or something when I first saw that message on the bed. Then you send me running across the entire city after things, for no good reason, apparently, and without any logic to it, either.”
There ought to be plenty of choice out there, if nothing else then to soothe the poor kids whose parents left without remembering to check their offspring had brought their stuffed animal of choice.
He sighed, his heart sinking just a little again. Of course, there was the small chance that Sherlock was refusing to react purely out of spite, but the continued laxness of the body told a different story. Still, he took comfort in the fact that there had been movement in the time he’d been gone, signifying one major thing, as far as he could tell.
To the casual observer, it wouldn’t appear as though he was waiting for them. Indeed, to that person it would appear that he hadn’t even noticed them and didn’t care one way or the other if he did. Or alternatively, that he was too engrossed in what he was doing to take note of anything else.
“Oh?” the brown-eyed man asked. “Are we expecting an addition to the party, then? How delightful. It
‘Harry’, though…was that a friend? No, if it had been a friend who’d upset him or had to be dealt with, as the words and the abruptness of the sign-off the night before, he either wouldn’t have cut himself off from mentioning more or he’d have left out the name entirely, so as not to ‘out’ him to Sherlock.
He leant forward and planted another kiss, though on the tip of Sherlock’s nose rather than his lips or even his cheek. However, as though to make up for that, he pressed their foreheads together as he continued his point.
Of course, as is so often the case, one person snickering, giggling or similar will set off someone else and back again until the feedback loop has not only completed, but escalated gradually until they were both laughing, almost helplessly, their hands still clasped together as the laughter shook their bodies.
John was staring right back, his stance relaxed for the moment but ready to spring into action if necessary. His chin was raised just slightly as it had been when he’d faced the crowd earlier and, though Sherlock wasn’t in the best position to see it from his frog’s-eye view, his expression was calm but challenging.
But wasn’t that giving up? Coming back so soon afterwards and without having accomplished anything? Was he really that easily spooked?
They hadn’t said what would happen if he couldn’t shift, however. His wings felt solid and physical, with no hint that he could slip his coat over them or similar. That wasn’t even counting the other places on his body the bullets had touched, superficially or not so much.
“Well, if that’s what you’d prefer,” he said, keeping his voice calm somehow, almost to the point of detachment. Pointedly so, in fact. He also shifted a bit, so that he was no longer exactly sitting in the other’s lap.
Sherlock blinked, feverishly trying to remember whether you were supposed to say anything specific after something like that, or just generally what you were supposed to do.
There was silence for a few minutes after that, which Sherlock spent running down the stairs as he pulled on his coat, and a good way down the street. He wasn’t going to hail a cab before he had an idea of –
“Celeste,” cried the woman and it was a cry in both senses of the word, the sob tearing itself out of her throat at the same time as the words. If she had been able, she undoubtedly would have reached out a hand, imploringly.
They didn’t know about the part of him which had been to war and hadn’t been traumatised by it. They hadn’t seen his struggle to have a life worth living after being shot. Didn’t know how much he was in control of himself and of the anger inside of him. Had to be, really. They knew nothing of his medical expertise in less savoury areas or his practical approach to dealing with things, including physical violence if needed. They wouldn’t want to know how he craved danger, needed to be pushed and brought to any sort of threshold as much as he needed something stable and warm, possibly even more so.
Was it his only child? It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that it wasn’t, with the years he’d spent in the harem, keeper or not. Why would that be the only successful impregnation, given the ‘ease’ with which their children had been conceived? If he’d had several pregnancies and she was his only child, had he been unfortunate enough to suffer miscarriages?
John didn’t turn to look at what was happening behind him. Instead, he continued to move forward as fast as his legs could carry him, out of the bedroom door, which he slammed behind him on principle, as he didn’t think for a moment it’d hold either dragon out, out through the small passageway that led into the kitchen and all the way out into the living room.
Keeping his eyes very firmly closed so as not to run the risk of falling back under the paralysing and, well, hypnotic powers of the dragon again, he fought against the limbs pinning him and managed somehow to pull his leg up enough that he had some leverage, which he then used to first stab his knee into the wiry body’s chest and then kick his heel, as best as he could, into the groin.
“That’s…” The brunet expected to hear something along the lines of ‘so sad’. What he got instead was, “Jesus Christ, people are idiots.”
“Johnny-boy!” the lilting voice said, a note of what might be faked delight in it, and then again, might not be, even if it wasn’t quite as innocently cheerful as it might suggest. “How lovely! I didn’t think you’d pick up – are you free for another play-date, then?”
Perhaps he didn’t want to at all, happy in what they had. Strictly speaking, it wasn’t as though much would change if they were husbands rather than boyfriends. Not on a day-to-day basis. Legally, there were some things that would change, of course – being allowed to visit when one or the other had landed himself in hospital without having to bully their way through was one that sprang immediately to mind – but otherwise, they lived much as they always had, before they had become a couple, even. What was to say it would be different if they both wore a ring? Or if it did change, change for the better. There were some rather worrying, if tedious, statistics on the subject, after all.
He watched John’s brow knit in confusion then change and form almost an ‘m’ as possible understanding seemed to dawn, and the sympathy took residence. Sherlock didn’t want sympathy, it was what you bestowed on people and things lesser than you, the slightly lesser twin of pity.
But he had the upper hand now, didn’t he? He held the leash, on a rope that continued to strengthen and spread, not only tying it to him in a way that he was in control of but tying it
“If Moriarty had had an interest in me rather than in you, as you suggest, he wouldn’t have gone for touching your stomach. I didn’t know at the time that you were pregnant,” judging by the momentary expression at that, it was still a sensitive subject to him, though not without reason, “so if he wanted to get to me and only to me, he would have either touched me directly or touched you somewhere intimate, like your scent gland. A place that would register as intimate and vulnerable to my instincts, as well as your own, and would cause a reaction in me to have another Alpha touch. But he didn’t.”
That said, it occurred far less frequently than it had and when it did happen, Sherlock caught himself at some point during the first few hours. In fact, the last few times it had happened, he had texted John within the first hour, sometimes before the blond even had a chance to notice he’d gone.
Brown eyes looked over at her for only the briefest second before they moved on. The expression in them as they looked was not visible to the brunet, but her reaction was and that really told him everything.
Hell, when he normally disappeared into his Mind Palace for minutes or, more usually, hours on end, John could at least go and get a cuppa and possibly a bite to eat. He might even finish his newspaper or do something else that was nice and relaxing. He wasn’t waiting on Sherlock to emerge, of course. Obviously not but it did help to keep an ear open just in case Sherlock emerged from there with a shout of his name or rushed immediately out the door. Often the two were combined and…well, if he was being honest, he had to admit that he had on more than one occasion completely ignored Sherlock when he’d bellowed at him or just expected him to follow. Deliberately and pointedly ignored, as a matter of fact.
Thank you to the people who read the first part and especially those so kind as to leave feedback. That's hugely appreciated and has powered me through a bit.
“No need to start off with you as a seeming dependent, especially not to an incompetent little toad like that, when that’s the last thing you are, except in a purely financial and temporary fashion, which counts for absolutely nothing.”
What he was concerned with was the ongoing issues with the harem owners and the fallout from that. So far, the owners, at least the ones with a semblance of sense, had not come out openly against them. They hadn’t dared to, worried about what would happen, but there wasn’t much time even so, so he needed John to come in and provide some further information.
There was a veritable maelstrom of other questions swirling through his mind, new ones mixing with the unanswered ones already whirling around. It was something of a wonder he kept a clear head. He thanked his training and his concern for his friend for the focus.
That didn’t stop him from watching with what was perhaps more attention and focus than was strictly necessary.
“Didn’t know that the first time you came in, did I? It’s not like you were in your uniform, and well, with your cheekbones and – “he waved a hand up and down which seemed to include the entirety of Sherlock’s body, which didn’t make any sense – “everything, I didn’t twig until somebody told me you were a student here.”
Sherlock wouldn’t make a mistake on this or otherwise forget. Not at this point in their relationship. The doctor had faith in him.
‘Sorry, got a bollocking from the teacher. Hell, I don’t know yet. Any particular reason you’re asking?’
He unconsciously bared his teeth in frustration. Scent bonds were not exactly common but there should be
“I possibly should’ve said something about it earlier,” he continued, all the while aware that he was talking on borrowed time, that each word could be the last, “but…I suppose I was afraid. You’d probably laugh at me if you could understand me. But it doesn’t matter. I just…wanted you to know, before…well, before you eat me.” No point beating around the bush about that, was there?
That realisation brought others along with it; right behind it came the thought that if everything was him, then it was easy.
There was also the risk that it wouldn’t be enough to do that job, seeing as he hadn’t exactly been hurt by the bullets themselves. Nor had his earlier attempt to kick him yielded any result but this time, it might possibly at least shock him enough to let go. It was a frail hope, to say the least, but it was about all that he had right then.
Or perhaps he just needed the moment to cope, which was entirely fair and even if it wasn’t, it was understandable.
John couldn’t deny that some of the lingerie he’d seen would look good on the slim, tall figure, either. But they had best stay within in his head, as fantasy.
Except she wasn’t, and she clearly had been as well as was. The wetness that had soaked his shirt told its own story there. In fact, some of it…clung.
Then again, given what the argument had been about when Sherlock had fallen unconscious or comatose or whatever, it was not an unreasonable question to ask nor was it odd that he was that insistent. To be honest, Sherlock was just pleased that he wasn’t angry about it anymore. Or at least, he didn’t seem to be.
Not that Sherlock would let him, or anyone else, see just how much this affected him. Because it…did, didn’t it?
Mycroft did but while an eyebrow rose, he didn’t comment. The next noise he made was the door to the bedroom closing behind him.
He dug his phone out of his pocket to send a quick text to Anthea, just in case that this would be the case and she needed to prepare for it.
How many dragons were still capable of genuinely vanishing? There was little doubt that he’d done it, the surge of it tangible in the air. Or was this because he was drawing on the treasure he had, letting the slightly symbiotic relationship that didn’t make it into stories feed into him, making it possible?
Sherlock would never admit it out loud, but he liked the cuddles immensely. There was something about being the larger figure that scrunched himself up small so he could fit inside the hold of the smaller man that was incredibly appealing. Especially so when John pressed his nose into his hair and took to tracing nonsense patterns on his back.
A sonogram would of course be better, but you could tell quite a bit by feeling the stomach and listening to it, and John would hazard the assertion that he’d become reasonable adept, within reason, building on what he’d learned in medical school and afterwards in his stint as a junior doctor.
. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed.” Sherlock looked him up and down, assessing him but not outright deducing him.
Sherlock’s grip on him was firm and immovable, which was just as well. What had on the ground felt secure but slightly suffocating in its all-encompassing grip now felt reassuring and comforting, even with the claws still present, the certainty of the knowledge that he wasn’t going to slip out of the grasp and plummet to his death.
Only then did he turn around to face John, with much of the same fear and dread that he had when he’d turned around the first time.
At least, it wasn’t exclusively that. One crash had definitely included the tinkle of glass shattering, but a few of the others, and this one included, was the crash of something colliding heavily with some wooden surface, presumably a door, which was beginning to splinter underneath the continued assault.
“No, don’t apologise. Please don’t. I’m…I was going to tell you. I just…please.” The words got stuck in his throat.
This wasn’t how he’d intended to attract attention, if he’d intended to attract attention at all. In fact, it was exactly what he’d been afraid of in relation to why he’d barricaded the front door in the first place, wasn’t it?
Nor what he meant by the fact that he had stayed in the doorframe, waiting, rather than coming to meet John. He was calm and composed, both in face, posture and scent, but everything about his clothes and his hair, not to mention his eyes, looked dishevelled and, if John could say that, worried.
John was the one who was to start the song off and so Sherlock watched as he took a deep breath, seemingly aware of the audience but no more than that, then started to play. Sherlock followed suit when he was meant to come in, joining in with the ease that came with skill and practice.
The care was instead the kind that you exhibit when you are doing something that you want to be sure you get right, with perhaps a bit of precaution in case of skittishness on behalf of the other in there, too.
Mycroft had not been best pleased when he’d realised the enormous stash of biscuits that he’d managed to secret away at the age of thirteen did nothing to appease the growing emptiness and hunger. An emptiness and a hunger that started gnawing by the time a dragon went into puberty, sinking its claws in deeper and deeper until it was fed, and it never pulled its claws out entirely.
That thought was somewhat blown apart when he saw the pale eyes land on him and, even at the distance, he saw how wild they looked. Almost desperate as they darted around his face, which didn’t make any sense. Confused he’d understand, thrown by him not being where he thought. The desperation, however, which there could no doubt about now, that didn’t make sense. Why would he be desperate in relation to John?
“Sherlock?” Still nothing. “Please…talk to me? I’m sorry if I did something you didn’t want me to do, but please, tell me?”
He ought to have fallen straight down. A shot at so close a range with such a precise aim should’ve finished him off immediately, no matter how much of an assassin and mercenary he was. No matter how much of an Alpha he was.
“You don’t have to do it.” John said, suddenly, as though the words had staged an escape attempt through his teeth. He turned his gaze away.
That thought alone gave him hope and determination to keep on going. Not that he wouldn’t be fighting for it, regardless of hope, whatever his momentary lapse had said, but nevertheless, it did make some difference, he would have to admit.
The image was so unexpected yet felt so right and filled him with such a warmth and heartache simultaneously that he couldn’t help wishing that the man actually had his own family.
A hunger that didn’t necessarily have anything to do with the desire for something to challenge him or assuage his boredom.
“…Did you say that you loved me? No, not just that, but that you meant it, that you were in love with me?”
“And normally, when I’ve thought about it, it fills me purely with anger. Now, though…I don’t even know what I feel. It’s got to be hormonal to be this arbitrary and forceful, but it shouldn’t have an effect. Not after I got through bond deterioration with almost no reaction, other than what you’d expect from it. Which is preciously little, I know, but – and now I’m bloody well rambling, too. Fuck!”
.........hello? Anyone still there? I hope so after all that I - well, it's here, anyway. At long last, I managed it. I did take the advice of the kind people commenting here, thank you so much for your understanding and support! ❤️❤️
Whatever Mycroft had said, he just hoped that he’d calculated wrong, and some more time really would be enough for Sherlock to at least shift back. That wasn’t to say he was in the clear, of course, he knew that. But it would be something. Some indication that he was getting better.
“Get them tomorrow.” No, tomorrow wasn’t good enough. “Bugger that. Let’s get them before we leave. That way, it’s less likely they’ve been altered, and I can read them – “
He blinked, his vision blurring and darkening, and the next thing he knew, his face was being pressed into the area of Sherlock’s neck where the scent gland was. Involuntarily, he inhaled, the scent helping, as before, to quell his rising fear and panic and replace it with…not tranquillity but a peace of mind that allowed him to think again after a little while and some deep inhalations. It didn’t take away the fear or the other emotions floating about in his mind, but it did give him back the reins.
That wasn’t to say John was slow on the uptake, mind. Sherlock truly didn’t believe he was, even if he was bad at remembering to communicate that. He was merely a creature of habit, as much as he was one that needed to be pushed to his edges. Plus he was used to rolling with the punches
“Not…really, no. Not to Moriarty, at least. It might have mattered to the other Alpha, of course. That I do not know.”
“You took something of mine and I’m retrieving it. End of story. If I never have to see your face again, I’d still feel tainted to the last of my days.”
He tried to say sorry, but the blond hushed him until he had his breath back, which coincided with when he was sitting against the wall rather than standing.
‘Not since the last time I spoke with you, I assure you. Someone spotted a great flying shape in the general area at that point in time, however, and is being detained but nothing afterwards. He has gone to ground for the moment and the area surrounding Baker Street is effectively cordoned off.’
The words, though important, he’d never deny that because he knew they were and felt that they were, also felt easy and natural to say. Yes, they hadn’t known each other that long, technically. Yes, they shouldn’t be bonded already, probably, and yes, there were a lot of things unknown and unsaid, things to negotiate and reconsider.
The man shrank back from him as he came close but before he could close the door, John had crouched down beside him, effectively wedging himself between the door and the man, calm and collected, telling the other that it would be alright. That he truly was a doctor and that he needed him to sit still for the moment as he checked him over. Made sure that his injuries didn’t require medical attention.
They couldn’t be kicking, not at this stage. Could they? He didn't know. Flutters would be more plausible if anything, but it was far more likely that he did it purely as a comforting gesture, as a grounding.
“I promise that I will not touch it,” he had said in a far calmer and quieter voice. “Nor smuggle anything back home. I will not put you, any of you, in danger.”
“Oh?” John made a concerted effort not to make it sound in any way doubting. He wasn’t entire sure he succeeded but he did try.
Once the door hit the floor, several noises followed, among them the footsteps thudding hard against the flooring, bangs against walls, from something that John couldn’t identify and just audible, voices.
He left it at that, but then, he didn’t need to say anything further. What he meant and felt was reflected succinctly in his expression, not to mention his scent. Even if it hadn’t been that evident, though, John felt sure he’d have understood, as he shared the sentiment.
And that wasn’t all that he needed to keep in mind, either. Not if he intended to get them out of there whole, both in body and as much in mind and soul as he could.
He leaned down and captured a kiss, long and warm and lazily passionate. John was happy to kiss back but keep it at a slower pace.
To try and cover up, pretend that he hadn’t just blushed at something as insignificant as that, he started to undo his own trousers.
That comment not so implicitly put a timer on Sherlock, to explain before somebody noticed the guitar and thought to nick it or destroy it. Really, though, he would hardly be likely to need much time.
“John…” Sherlock mirrored, edging himself a little closer still. John copied him. There hadn’t been much distance between them before but now there was no more than a few inches. A few inches were an easy gap to close.
When he’d gone with Sherlock, they’d also travelled mainly by cab, which had limited the exposure to at least some degree.
Granted, he hadn’t been flying partially shifted like this for a very long time, as far as he still retained memories thereof, but given his relative inexperience flying in this form, his injuries and the added aspect of his passenger, he had, if he’d thought about it, expected something a little more erratic and certainly more cumbersome.
With all this in mind, it was rather a wonder that he hadn’t collapsed before now. As it was, he just about managed to stay awake long enough that he could settle himself on his side beside the lanky body instead of collapsing on top of it when he succumbed to sleep.
John bit down on the comment on ‘you tell me’, because it was neither relevant nor useful in the situation, much as it would be momentarily satisfying to utter.
No, the point right now was that he had a question to answer and he wasn’t sure how to. At least, not how to without further mucking it up.
That was in the very back of his mind, though. The rest of his mind was occupied with the tableau in front of him, which had somehow slowed down to almost a standstill.
Among others, he would refrain from doing anything garish and sappy or preposterously excessive. But he would also need to research what it was that people expected of a proposal. Then he would have to filter it through, not so much his own perception as that was bound to go wrong before he had even settled into the starting blocks never mind got out of them, but that of John. One might think that would be a fair lot easier, but which he knew from experience and knowledge of the man would be more complex than it appeared.
Before he could do that which Mycroft had suggested, though – it was just as well that his brain hadn’t entirely erased that conversation from his mind because what he’d written down…needed the brain of a sleep-deprived to understand otherwise – he would have to find the damn thing first.
“…well, yes, I suppose that’s true,” Sherlock conceded. “But it is only a thing, comparatively speaking. I’ll live.”
It didn’t get a laugh or even a chuckle, but Sherlock suspected John wasn’t expecting it to. It was more of a band-aid, a bridging tactic more than anything.
“Versatility and sturdiness trumps brand value any day in my book,” he said with a small but sincere smile that also carried a grateful note. “I’ll take one of those, definitely. Is there anything else you’d recommend that I need to have? Everything, obviously, that’s your job and I respect that, but specifically something essential for when you’re about to have twins.”
John didn’t say anything, his blue eyes equalling that of a dragon in their fire for a moment as he continued to glare before he closed them, his brow furrowing as he did so. After a long moment, he released his grip on the ginger’s hand.
“You have lessons after this?” They hadn’t, as it had been purposefully placed at the end of the school day for that reason.
Right, then. He wasn’t going to rush headlong into something where he wasn’t prepared, knife or no knife, and possibly outnumbered, though not necessarily outmatched. That was stupid and he…well, he couldn’t afford to be stupid anymore.
‘One of us always tells the truth. One of us always lies’, wasn’t it? Except Sherlock somehow managed to be both at once.
But there was also a matter of personal hygiene. He ought to relieve himself, of course, and a brush of teeth probably wouldn’t go amiss, either, for either of them, especially if John wanted to keep kissing him.
“I never learned how to sit pretty, however many lessons I got,” John said as he turned his head slowly back to look at the other. He gave him the sincerest of false smiles. “But yeah, you’re right, I probably am a little shit. I guess that’s the patriarchy for you, or maybe it’s just a side effect of being an Omega.”
He felt hands come up and he expected to have his face bracketed again. But what he got instead was one hand back where it had been before while the other settled onto the nape of his neck, its fingers sliding into the soft hair there.
It warmed his heart to know that Sherlock was so willing to help, even when it came to something like this, especially when he could be out solving murders and such instead.
‘Why do you? Why does anyone play? Because I like it. It’s fun. I get to learn things, some of which are difficult, because I feel like it when I feel like it, not because someone tells me I ought to.’
Mycroft looked at him then looked over at his brother, the shivers and the breathing that was just about visible the only indicators of life. Well, that and the continued grip on John’s wrist. His demeanour softened a little.
He was no longer a soldier. The bullet wound had seen to that, in conjunction with the Heat that had been triggered as a self-dense mechanism when he’d been spotted by an Alpha while wounded. Technically, he was still a doctor, but he could no longer be a surgeon. Not just because of the tremor or the limp at the time but because he was seen as a liability for hospitals; who know what they really had on their hands when he didn’t have any scent? It was unnatural, was the general consensus.
The brunet shrugged. “Easy, really. Your scent says distress and annoyance, a combination that is most commonly found in that concentration when people are thinking of family. That and I read some of your records, of course.”
Sherlock and Mycroft had picked a terrasse that was not too big or too extravagant, which had been easier to get hold of in any case though that wasn’t an issue as such, and where the seating arrangement was placed just so. It meant that no matter where Sherlock placed himself, he would be able to see John.
It was more that…yes, that was a benefit but to extract that, to harness it somehow, what would be the sacrifice that would take? When did that sacrifice become justified other than never truly? Also, what side effects would occur? How could they make certain that said healing factor didn’t come with a side order of the less…helpful dragon traits? And that was thinking only of if it worked, which was quite a major ‘if’, not to mention getting a dragon to cooperate or subdued enough that they could take by force, of course.
Then John shook his head and Sherlock’s heart went…honestly, it went sideways, not knowing how he was supposed to feel about that or how he felt about that, either, other than the distinct feeling it wasn’t right.
Therefore, he contented himself with saying, as he settled himself back down with his head resting on the brunet’s shoulder, “Good. That’s good.”
To see what remained of it, that was, which wasn’t any more than a few grains that had somehow stuck to his palm and was now trickling of it. Nevertheless, the glitter of those few grains were impossible to miss and brought attention to the small pile of dust at his feet.
“Beard. Keep the beard. I like it.” Despite the look of exhaustion, there was the just start of a fire smouldering in pale eyes, one which had nothing to do with his wyvern heritage.
But it would make communicating with Tessa that much easier as well as the personnel of the airport – and wherever else they needed to go between the airport and where the little girl lived.
Honestly, about the cutest teddy bear he had ever seen. He had to adjust his grip as he pulled, since it was quite a lot heavier than he had anticipated. It didn’t feel as though he was about to break it, however, mainly because it was quite well-made.
Turning his gaze just as quickly, and hopefully imperceptibly, back towards the two Alphas, the two male Alphas, he saw that while Moriarty gave no outward sign still that he’d noticed them, fully engrossed in deciding where to place his piece, Moran was looking back.
He waved a hand and Mycroft seemed to get the point; he helped to spread one wing enough that John, with some precarious balancing over the prone body, could just about reach and, with more saliva just to be sure when he couldn’t quite see, brushed it out.
Then again, that could be said for so much of what his mind had pulled him through, especially in the last day.
All these speculations without explanation was starting to do his head in a little. Not because he couldn’t handle them, it wasn’t that. He was adept at rolling with the punches when he needed to, his anger being a completely separate matter.
Of course, that rock might need to become a mountain but that was fine, too. Whichever was needed, Sherlock would do his best to try and provide.
“That’s very kind of you, thank you,” he said, taking the bag off the ginger Alpha. At the insistence of a waved hand, he opened the bag immediately, peering inside.
He reached out, still with his back unfortunately turned, and managed to get hold of the railings, which seemed, despite their obvious age, rather sturdy and in good nick. Victorians did love to make their ostentation last, didn’t they? Thankfully.
Then it would happen, whether John speculated on it or not, and so he should get on with it rather than going around it again and again like a cat circling something unknown and potentially dangerous. It wasn’t going to help anyone, least of all himself or the man beside him.
Really, given the look in his eyes, it was a surprise that he had opened the door at all, much less as quickly as he had.
There was a pause that went on for one beat of the wings. Two. Then, “I’ll explain when we get home. I promise. Any and all questions you have about this, John, I promise I’ll answer them. Fully and truthfully.”
Sherlock found that he was drawing himself up to his full height at that, unconsciously tightening his grip on both of the things he held in his hands. At that same time, he felt the hold that his physical hand had and that knowledge, that tangible and felt anchor was enough to banish the panic and fear which had flooded him in the instance he had seen evidence of the dragon.
It was more than Sherlock had and, surrounded by her scent here, he could at the very least for almost absolutely certain say it was the same girl as had worn the dress that Moriarty’s Alpha goon had thrown at John.
He paused and tried to gather his thoughts. “It’s his head, really, his mind. Then again, when the hell isn’t it? But he’s had some struggles with control, keeping the dragon part pushed down…no, contained is probably the better word. Leashed and under his control. I think he’s managed it but now he’s scared that his control will slip, during sleep or during…” and he was a doctor, for fuck’s sake, he shouldn’t be hesitating even this slightly to say one measly word to, well, to be fair, one of the most powerful men in England, “…sex. Probably more to it with the sex part – and I still can’t bloody well believe I’m about to discuss that with you.”
I know it's a shorter chapter than last time but as I'm working on several stories at once...well, it's something posted, innit?
John wasn’t backing down, however, instead folding his arms over his chest. “And I’m the one who knows what happened between you falling unconscious and your own self resurfacing, so I’d say we’re pretty much even.”
For a moment, Sherlock stiffened at whatever the ginger said, his eyes darting back to look at John.
“Oh, I don’t know,” John said, grinning. “Their past with the spy stuff and the breeding of super intelligent wasps, that wasn’t bad.”
“No, I think you’re a bastard to everyone. But you’re right…nngh, right that you’re mine. My partner.” The hand pressed more firmly against him, cupping him more fully and John bucked, just a little, the fabric a frustrating barrier and a small source of wonderful friction. “That’s cheating!”
It had been battered and tested several times already – some might even say constantly – and had emerged whole, more or less, on the other side. Not by accident, either, and they had got progressively better.
John has shown up for the concert at last. Sherlock doesn't expect him to go on but John is a stubborn bugger when he wants to be. A stubborn bugger with a suprise or two.
It would be easier for him as a Beta to mask what scent he had, especially in comparison to Omegas and Alphas, but even for them, if you knew what you were scenting for, there were distinct markers for them.
Mycroft closed his eyes, squeezing them slightly in the process as he breathed through his nose, the breathing more than a little strained. His pale complexion was somehow even paler and yet, while there was no actual sweat on the brow, the was a ruddy tint to the skin, too, one that did not look healthy.
But no, this soft toy, of a relatively realistic but still child-appealing hedgehog, was something she had held onto regardless, even when it had been attempted taken away from her.
Mycroft thought that he was tempting fate by letting it remain such a halfway state. That it was unsustainable to have just the one human so close, both physically and mentally, for such a long time, without formally claiming him, and that it would lead to either John crumbling under the push-and-pull of belonging and being pushed away or Sherlock’s instincts snapping and taking over, claiming him as hoard treasure and nothing more.
The issue, though, wasn’t just the dragon and the continued risk of being swallowed – it wasn’t that it couldn’t breathe fire but if it did that, to what was in control of the mind, whatever it claimed, destroyed him rather than consumed him, then there wasn’t much mind left to control, was there? No, the issue was just as much that he had to navigate through an increasingly tired mind, through the pitfalls and desires of the depths.
If anything had dulled his mind, it was what he’d done to it himself, through neglect and self-medication, and what John had done was bring a different perspective and nuance to things. He had enhanced even when he’d complicated what used to be so simple and straightforward.
The dark-haired man moved his leg up and away as soon as John started to shift, as though he’d not just read his movement but his intention, too. Which, given who it was, probably wasn’t far off.
John frowned, his eyes narrowing slightly. “You want honesty?” he asked, sharp in turn. “I wasn’t expecting you to turn up, if we’re being honest.”
No, it couldn’t. That was…somehow more personal and being given clothes to wear brought memories of his time first being in the harem, when there was still novelty to him, and he’d not just served as the keeper. Not that those were dominating or anything, and he might be using them as a convenient excuse, but Sherlock providing for him all-around still rankled. Enough that he hadn’t brought it up with the Alpha, and the man hadn’t made a comment about it, either.
Sherlock paused, thinking. Was that why he had taken the watch? He would’ve said so but at the same time, that didn’t feel quite right.
“Part of? Why only part of?” John asked. Then he answered his own question. “Because there are several other factors playing a part, such as the bullets, and they are all tangled up.”
“No, in actual fact, you said ‘wary’, but the point is that it’s not just an immediate response to the current situation. Even if you don’t acknowledge it right now, it’s not going to fester.”
Closing his eyes, he felt his thoughts return to him. Not fast but fast enough that he could string together a sentence in his mind. He didn’t need to think about much, however; his own instincts had been awakened, though why they hadn’t weighed in earlier he couldn’t say, and they quickly assessed the situation.
But that was it, wasn’t it? They couldn’t actually do without him. Not if they wanted to be sure that it was the right girl that they brought back with them, in any case, which was rather the important thing.
Why was it in tatters? What on earth had happened? There was no possible reason for either Sherlock or Mycroft to have shredded his coat when they’d been coming to blows, whether that had been straight-out fighting or his brother trying to contain him.
He didn’t want John to see the smile as being at his expense. Not that he was likely to, but there was a chance and they ought to be focusing on other things.
Well, that was a marked difference from the man’s usual way of answering a phone call. Not that it didn’t make sense, of course. If anything, it made too much sense.
Alright. The table was first priority, quite obviously, and then he would have to work outwards from there, in the hope that it was at least in the living room. It had to be somewhere in the flat, but it would be easier if it were in the living room.
“Fair point. It’s been a little bit longer than ‘just now’, mind, but…and I’m smiling because of this, mainly.”
The idea that the elder Holmes honestly didn’t know somehow didn’t sit entirely right with John. Not that he disbelieved him, he just…didn’t quite believe him, that was all.
The feeling only increased when the blond then asked, “That’s how you feel about it? As if it’s part of your hoard?”
For the most part, at any rate. While he’d demonstrated that he did indeed wield them, the leash tight, there was always the sense, at least to Sherlock, that it would teeter over into something else any moment without Moriarty’s knowledge and he would no longer be in charge.
Even so, there was a gap so wide it was a gulf between their normal helter-skelter experiences and the associated fun, and the complete upside-down experience of discovering not just that dragons were real or that Moriarty was one – the realisation that Molly’s boyfriend was the criminal mastermind seemed almost incidental in comparison – but that he seemed genuinely interested in collecting John and that Sherlock, who was another dragon rather than just a lanky git with a penchant for nicking stuff, had an interest in laying a claim, as well.
The hand underneath his twitched, as seemed the lips of the ginger Alpha, but then he pushed the hand up into John’s. He didn’t grip it or put his other hand on top of it or anything like that.
All he could do was the same as John. Well, that and act as a human shield, of course, but that was a separate issue.
No matter what had happened and what would happen in the future, no matter what he was or wasn’t, the world needed Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock nodded his agreement. He reached one hand up to cup the back of John’s neck, pressing at it, his intent clear.
“Yeah, ta, I’d figured that much. He’ll have left us some breadcrumbs, though, or you at least, even if it can’t have been…or it can, I suppose, have been enough time for him to…”
Likely since he had known John. More realistically, since he’d worked up the courage, with a bit of help, to progress their relationship, when emotions had become not just an expected part of half the dynamic but an equally expected and, more importantly,
This time, his brain worked somewhat faster than before, and he didn’t end up standing there staring for long enough to worry John, or so he thought.
Fine, okay. He’d write back, just a simple text saying ‘okay’ or something similar. Then he might write a ‘good morning’ tomorrow, as he’d done more than once, and then…then the ball was in John’s court again, not his.
It wasn’t even purely when the hoard sickness set in, either. The idiom of ‘the more you get, the more you want’ came, though humans of course wasn’t aware of it, from dragons for a reason, after all.
Though he didn’t know it and might’ve still scoffed at himself for doing so had he noticed, Sherlock held his breath waiting for what answer John was going to give. It ought to have been obvious and straightforward, after and considering everything, but it was not.
John didn’t notice, focused as he was on something else and not in the best position to scan the surroundings, but Mycroft had also entered the room now, looking very much worse for wear. Sherlock didn’t look any better, really, but John’s focus was on something else.
He wasn’t going to get riled up by this one Omega who’d barely presented and was using his secondary gender as a ticket to get what he wanted.
Whatever she had been born as and whatever she had been through in her life until now, she could still have a good life going forward, so long as she had the best possible support and care. From professionals, too, if need be.
As they laughed and went on laughing, he could feel the dragon sinking faster into the depths below his Mind Palace. It wasn’t gone, it never would be. As an integral part of him, it couldn’t ever be entirely gone. But it could be banished as far down into the depths, below the cellars, below the foundations, as it could possibly go.
Sherlock would’ve protested, verbally and physically…except he could hear the silence out there, which meant that they were expected up on stage.
In a way, insofar as it was powering the rest of its body, but for what he needed to achieve he didn’t need the heart. Not that the hearts of dragons were exactly the centre of their beings, in a metaphorical sense. If it had been, it would have rotted away from neglect long ago. Both the heart and the dragon.
John was able to return the purr and return it he did, immediately. It was low and rumbling and almost incandescent in its warmth, contentment and reassurance.
Sherlock had stepped in, then, not so much to take over and render John the incapable of the pairing, but to back him up with showing his own bite marks off, saying curtly that he’d be happy to show them how they fitted with John’s dental records. Then he lectured him on just how a face might change in the time that had passed between the ID photo being taken and now, rounding off with a brief aside on how the clerk wasn’t in any position to demand or question such things, seeing as how he’d taken backhanders to pass people through various bureaucratic roadblocks that they weren’t supposed to be able to cross.
Sherlock might have asked what for but honestly, he didn’t need to. He already knew what for, and he was incredibly grateful. Not so much to himself for having a ‘John’ that was fully formed enough in his mind to be here – after all, he’d be far more worried if that hadn’t been the case, given the amount of space facts about John took up and the importance the doctor had come to have in his life at this point.
Not that that had stopped the rat-like twerp, of course. If anything, it had made the resentment he felt for Sherlock merely fester and take root. Now any hint of wrongdoing, even of things nobody else got in trouble for, was enough to set him off when it came to Sherlock.
“Point is, it’s probably a bit more complicated than you or I think it is. I don’t get quite why you resurfaced, as it were, when you did and not at any earlier point, despite all our efforts.”
the Omega thought, his teeth having pulled back a little in the semblance of a challenging snarl as he scanned the street, looking for the spot and time where the other was bound to emerge.
– “Mycroft began. Thinking that if they were going to argue, or bicker, through a phone line, then he wasn’t going to be the mediator.
Then there was the matter of shaving. That really needed to be done now before it grew too long, just in case the idiot ended up conking out for the next 48 hours. Of course, you could shave that long a ‘beard’, too, without too much trouble but he’d prefer not to have to.
No, that wouldn’t work. Not only would that like as not be seen by the doctor as admitting guilt, however he swung it to convince him otherwise – and when did John become that well-versed in his little trick? Or was Sherlock ascribing more astuteness to him than warranted? – he wouldn’t accept it, and especially not from Sherlock.
It did not land on his arm or even his shoulder, but it was rather effective at getting him to stop moving.
What was most important, though, was that they had heartbeats, both of them, visible and indisputable.
He no longer felt alone down there. Not because the dragon, the huge, hulking beast was right there beside him, the continued, utter stillness of it worrying. Nor because he had the weight of everything else that was stored in his Mind Palace bearing down on him, the depravities that was contained around him.
Mycroft, his expression somewhat drawn, leaned forward from his seat on the other side of the bed. His eyes flashed. Before all of this, John would’ve written that image off as nothing more than fanciful language, just something people used when they wanted to dramatize things.
He didn’t belong here. Not in this precise store, although he certainly wasn’t the target audience, but out there, among the throng of people.
It took him only a moment to realise why the expression would be such a mess; Sherlock didn’t know what had happened between the time he’d left and when he’d returned. To be fair, he could probably hazard a guess that was more accurate than most people’s certainties, but still. He didn’t know.
Yes. It would have to be. He could not go back, now that he knew what it was like on the other side, to use a phrase that had been pummelled to oblivion and then sold as sausage filling, to what they had had before. Which would be the second best-case scenario, should he bugger this up enough that John would say no, with the first being the utopia that they carried on as boyfriends, nothing more said.
Well, yes. Compared to the other times where he had shifted, and it had been quick and…well, not violent, but with a force that didn’t speak of calculation or control but pure reaction, this couldn’t speak louder about its difference.
The consulting detective let him step away but didn’t relinquish the grasp he had on him. John looked up at him.
“You thought I perhaps wasn’t interested in that sort of thing, that might find it disgusting, that I might hate you for it, and yet, you still did it. After all that, after everything else, you still wanted to do it. Didn’t you?”
“Who are all dead and who you have managed to tie back to him,” John finished. Somehow, it didn’t surprise him or even horrify him. It all seemed rather par for the course, as it were.
“A lot of sense, yes,” Sherlock replied, and it came out almost whispered. He looked a little bowled over again but in a way that was entirely sweet and warm. There might’ve been some colour high in those cheekbones.
He looked back up at the older brother, joy in his expression. It would be easy to also express a smidgeon of triumph at having been proved right that it would help to wait and see, that it had paid off. He didn’t feel any sense of triumph, however, just a deep and tremendous relief that Sherlock was no longer so comatose as to be completely unresponsive. Which in turn bred a stronger hope that he might just make it all the way back to the surface, as it were, and wake up.
Sherlock saw him take a deep breath and close his eyes, his body giving a single shudder. But he was clearly working something out in his head and whatever that was, Sherlock would wait for it. However long it would take.
However, it was his name she called, and the familiarity and happiness with which she said ‘Jim’ – and she got the English pronunciation of it exactly right, too – sent something so cold it seared down Sherlock’s spine.
“They’re…the things a dragon collects have got to have value but that doesn’t entail monetary value, which is uncertain, dependent on human evaluation and, quite frankly, incredibly dull, and so is currency. Gold can assuage the hunger to a fairly large extent, though not as much as folklore would have you believe, but there isn’t enough gold in the world to satisfy the dragon population, and in any case, there are other things that can satisfy.”
Was there something guilty in there, as well? He’d say that John didn’t actually believe that he wasn’t in danger from Moriarty, that he knew he was but was trying to convince Sherlock and, just as importantly, himself that he wasn’t, in order to cope with it.
It loosened and warmed something deep inside of him; the knowledge, though not at this point what might be called complete, that they did indeed work far better together than they did apart. That the scent bond was indeed not something arbitrary or random or only to do with instincts or the most base level of humanity.
Applying the solution to the wounds on the back that he could get to had made Sherlock keen again rather than hiss as he sometimes did when John’s medical services had been required on living flesh. John had paused when it had first happened, trying to gauge whether the issue was just pain or something else.
He had made different choices. Better choices. He was not the person that he had been, the one who had been fascinated with and flattered by Moriarty when he had come into contact with him that very first time.
I was a bit surprised myself at this turn but as I wrote it, I found I liked it a lot and it fitted, so I was not going to change it. I hope you like it too, though, and yeah, again, the length isn't amazing, I know. :S
He almost startled as a hand enveloped his own again as best it could and looked back at John from where his gaze had…drifted. The watch was still in his other hand.
Hi? Hello? Anyone still here? I won't blame you if you aren't. It's been three months, after all. :( Apologies to those who still care.
But if, after all that they had been through and the rough start that they had had, he could look at John in what could gently be called a non-flattering light and still be besotted – him! – then surely that was a good sign.
