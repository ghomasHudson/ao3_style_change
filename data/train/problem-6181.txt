“I kind of do,” Tony returns.  “I promised that I privatized national security.  Global security problems makes it look like I am a liar.”  He pauses before adding, “Don’t die out there Captain. That’s an order.”
Tony presses his knee into Steve's thigh, leaning close. He's smiling. “What do you think?”
She is rattling apart at the edges, and Clint is in her space, nearly touching her.  She could breath wrong and be touching him. It’s like a closely choreographed dance where she moves and he follows.  The closer he is, the more she settles. Steve keeps his mouth shut and follows carefully in their wake, Sam pulling closer to him in his own unease.
It’s been three months, and they have been quietly trying to make their way through Europe, following the photo sighting that are getting sparser to find from JARVIS.  They left the jet back in France, backpacking or using Clint’s skills at picking up cars (Steve has stopped asking where he got the keys and careful not to look at the wires under the dash).
“Of course sir,” JARVIS utters calmly.  “I have Agent Romanov on the line.”
“He’s always liked you,” Natasha shrugs when Clint can’t stop laughing.  “He sells his motivations as something else. He’s always done that. Tony Stark doesn’t like admitting things like that.”
It wasn’t a date.  And I’m not looking right now.
“I worked on things for SHIELD in order to get my hands into their nice little system,” Tony responds, rolling his eyes.  “You think the pretty non branded tech and planes aren’t something left over for SHIELD? Of course Fury gave Black Widow the keys to the kingdom and she gave them to Rogers.  Been attached at the hip New York. Anyways, you were too low of a rank to be in on the their little pow wows. But then again, most of us were.”
Tony points a finger at him. “We are going to talk about this later. Extensively.” His eyes are dark again, intense, and Steve swallows, a hot stone settling in his stomach. He nods. “But right now, we're gonna cuddle over here and you guys are gonna cuddle over there and we're going to watch a movie and wait this out.”
Steve wonders about that.  Wonders why this. Why him,
He takes a deep breath and shoves his hands into his pockets.
“It’s on the avengers account, seriously don’t worry about it,” Tony brushes away.  There is another noise in the background, and he can hear Tony distantly muttering something about dummy’s and fire extinguishers.
He saved you.  He said something to you.  I believe it was, “Sorry Steve” before he wandered off.
Yes Steve
“Caught you getting beat up in some back alley.  I decided to lend a hand,” Bucky says. A ghost of a smile graces his face.  “Wasn’t the last time.”
, Steve thinks as it all slides into place.
Really?
That thought hits him hard, and Steve has to sit down on the bed for a moment and shake away the imperfect pictures that are his memories before the serum of him and Bucky laughing, arguing, and everything in between in that tiny Brooklyn apartment.  Him coughing too hard all of a sudden and the way Bucky’s eyes went tight.
He should have left the second Steve asked.  Steve doesn’t ask for thing often and Tony know, knew in the moment just as he knows now, if he had been there on the ground or on the comm line - this would not have happened.
“Oh,” she had repeated before rolling her eyes and heading back to the front of the plane.  Sam hadn’t had the decency to move. Just sat there and laughed at him to his face before Steve shoved him and moved to the back bunk to avoid everyone.)
“How’s everything else?” Steve pushes.  And for a moment he doesn’t think Tony is going to respond.
“Aye,” Thor says, “now we feast!”
“God, Natasha just keeps all the secrets and doesn’t share anything,” Tony huffs.  “Long story short, we’ve got a training facility outside New York. You’re in DC right?”
Steve wants to tease Tony, but he also thinks he may puke if he opens his mouth.  Instead he grinds his teeth together and tries to walk with Natasha and Sam on either side, guiding him and helping him stay on his feet.
Tony shifts, and it’s like Steve can feel it through his whole body, even though they’re only touching at the one spot.
(‘I have a satellite pointed your way,’ Tony had said.
“Can do Tony,” Steve responds just before the click of the line.
“According to your medical report, it seemed a little holey,” Tony replies, absently.  There is a clatter in the background, and Steve hears him lowly cursing, muttering at JARVIS before readjusting the phone, and the sound of static-y harsh breathing comes across the line.
“Shit,” Tony says. “Yeah, definitely dosed me with something.”
It isn’t an answer, but it is.
Tony chuckles again, “I’m just helping to coordinate.  Once I get a secretary or five, they will handle this sort of information.  Don’t worry about it.”
Sam’s face goes rueful.  “You know I can’t help it.  I don’t get this whole dynamic you all have.  But Stark’s the weirdest. Basically he’s helping you track down your formerly dead best friend who he has never known and it’s like you never even asked for his help.  So how the hell did he know you needed help?”
Steve’s heart stops a little bit.  “Like me?”
He doesn’t hide when he slips into trying to help. Steve is grateful for that because then he gets to decide how he wants to engage it.  Mostly he avoid the topic and moves on. Sam always lets him drop it.
“I can’t thank you enough,” Steve tells Tony, days later in the middle of one of the side closests of gear that Tony keeps filled with for the team.
Twenty hours into a problem solving jag, he’s got another tablet strewn around him, parts in various sizes and shapes across the table as he fumbles for his screwdriver.  “Where did I leave it this time?” Tony asks, throwing the pen he’s grabbed instead across the room. DUM-E whirs after it.
“I'm touching you, too,” Steve points out. Part of him recognizes that his hand has moved from Tony's shoulder to his neck and that that's...an awful lot closer than he usually gets, but he can't make himself let go.
Call sir so he can work out the logistics.  The compound does not have any food right now.
Tony shrugs, “I’m helping nameless, faceless people in the crowd.  With this, I know who is benefiting, and I’ve realized I like putting faces to who I help.”
“Your neighbor,” Tony repeats.  “The one in DC.”
“Oh,” Steve says.  “Really?”
We’re trusting this twitter user because we don’t have any other leads right now.
“He had a mask like in Mighty Ducks,” the guy groans.  “You know the hockey movie?”
He can practically hear the shrug across the line.  “Pepper and Nat text,” he offers. “What did you call me about?”
before responding with, “Tony, no.  I don’t...
Tony sighs. “Being a pain in my ass.”
JARVIS doesn’t say anything, and they sit there for a moment while Tony continues working until he finally breaks and queries, “Sir?”
He’s learned to trust Natasha’s taste in people.  And if Tony is vouching for him, well Steve is learning to trust Tony too.
Steve breaks into a grin, too buoyed by Tony's attention and the substance to even think of smothering it.
Steve looks ahead and sees Natasha and Clint talking back and forth about some topic or another.  Her gaze is warm when she looks at Clint. Warmer than Steve’s seen it before. “JARVIS mostly. He’s Tony’s AI.  He’s doing some research for this,” he waves a hand around.
That’s the moment that gunfire begins to rain down on them.
They both know that likelihood is low though.
“Ish.  Kind of.  I got your doctor bills, it’s about the same thing,” Tony offers up sheepishly.
They reach an ancient data center that looks too familiar to what Steve remembers from Zola’s digital appearance.  Natasha calls Tony and puts him on speaker. “Okay kids, I need you to put the bright blue cord from Steve’s tablet into the nearest serial port and turn the baby on.  JARVIS will take care of it from there.”
“Systematically cleaning house?” Steve questions as the gunfire pauses.  He peeks around the corner and sees no movement. He looks back to Tony and knows they both don’t feel good about this.
Steve takes the lead, keeping an eye out for anyone headed their direction and Tony falls back to walk with Natasha, the two of them talking in low voices.
Steve doesn’t know what to say, so he replies with a cautious, “Oh”.
They end up next to a river.  With the sun setting, the water looks like it glitters.  For the first time in a long time, Steve feels the urge to grab a pencil and sketch the scene down.  He hasn’t felt the urge since before he woke up.
right,” Tony says again and the hand that's been burning steadily against Steve's thigh for the better part of the last few minutes pulls away. Tony groans, but Steve has a hard time focusing on that because his leg feels
Natasha pushes to her feet and moves behind Steve, one of her hands staying on his shoulder even as she cups Tony's chin, tilting his face upward. “What kind of something?”
Tony laughs uproariously at the comment, and she even smiles a little at the sound.  It seems to warm the place up as the noise echoes around the metal building “Of course it is,” he says.  “Okay gotta go. I recommend destroying everything.”
“JARVIS,” Tony says, “body scan.”
“You didn’t have to come and rescue me or help with Bucky,” he continues earnestly.  “It really means a lot.”
It only takes a few minutes before JARVIS speaks again.  “Sir,” he pauses, and Tony sits back up for this, puts everything down because he knows this is going to be bad.  Knows it down to his bones, to his scars from Afghanistan. “I cannot ping his phone.”
He strips off his shirt and goes into his closet to pull off a fresh shirt and jeans to change into after he’s showered.  He needs something to wake him up, pull him out of the half feeling he’s in.
“Uh,” Steve stutters.  “Sam said he had some loose ends to tie up before he headed out, but to call him when I get information.”
Not that he’s counting or anything.
Steve shrugs himself.  “None. I just want to go back home.”
“What?” Steve asks, because he hasn’t had a neighbor that wasn’t Sam, Clint or Natasha in months.  And he’s pretty sure he hasn’t been flirting with any of them.
We’re not done yet Steve.  Hold out hope.
Behind the curtain, it's like seeing Fury at the grocery store. All the polish and glamour is replaced with severe practical scaffolding and wires everywhere you look. Strange and not meant to be seen.
“Whatever,” Tony huffs.  “I’ll make JARVIS watch your pretty face while I re-soder this terrible keyboard.  We all know he will have the most fun out of the two of us.”
With a rush, the whole line drops until he hits the ground, breathless and groaning what little he has left because the meat hook has been pushed nearly back out after the hook hit the ground.  Rumlow fell further away and gets up and starts running towards some of the crates, shouting.
Before she tells you, show her these texts
The man smiles and says, “Right with me sir.”
“I didn’t need to know that,” Bruce says from Steve’s left. Steve has no response because he’s pretty sure his brain is dribbling out of his ears.
There is something in the peace of the moment, in the look of Banner’s face that makes him say, “Still angry?”
You need anything?
“You find him dazzling, we know,” Thor says, with only a hint of exasperation. Steve's only a little embarrassed. Tony's incredible. He's not ashamed to let people know he thinks so. Even if his friends are maybe a little sick of hearing it.
I’ve hacked the cameras - he’s going to take you to a waiting area, and when my plane lands, you’re going to get on it.  It’ll take you to the compound. It’ll be about 45 minutes since I have to have the plane reroute. Anyone else you want to drag along on this expedition?”
The scent of tea leaves is overwhelming and Steve has to take a moment to hold his breath before he can adjust.  Clint breaks away and straightens. Natasha, however, walks up to the front desk and nods at the proprietor who smiles in return.  They exchange a few words in German before pointing to the Employee Only signed door.
Tony’s eyes glitter, and Steve has to remind himself of Tony’s words,
He asks instead.
“She’s a friend,” Nat says finally.  “Or a friend of a friend. Something like that.”  She’s put on sunglasses at some point and pulled her hair back into a ponytail.  “You need to call Tony. There has been some developments.”
good. Hurts when I stop touching Steve.”
that guy. Can't believe he got in here. Anyway.” He swipes his hands downward. “Time for dinner, right?”
This time he doesn’t.
Steve grins, “I wanted you anyways Tony, not a suit.”
“The times have changed and so have the technology,” Tony replies in between mouthfuls.  “I’d have to teach you this stuff, and it’s just faster at this point between me and JARVIS.  It’s just hard sometimes, like a needle in a haystack. Because your friend is good as much as I hate to admit it.  We have had to get inventive.”
When Tony's welcome ends, they make their way through the crowd to the back of house to meet up with him for dinner. Tony's brief speech had been electrifying and the audience fills the arena with an infectious buzz as they trickle out to join the opening night party.
“I can tell it’s wearing you thin.  You don’t have to spend all this time helping me.  I could do it the old school way,” Steve blurts out before he leans back a little bit abashed at his lack of tack.
Steve texts Tony every day.  It becomes part of his daily habits, mentioning something going on, taking a snapshot of something he would like to draw, would think Tony would find interesting, or even some terrible technology so Tony would just bitterly complain about the state of the world.
“Har har,” Steve says dryly.
“Why not?”
Natasha and Clint burst through the door, survey the room before straightening and heading towards them.  “The perimeter’s secure,” Natasha notifies as she comes over and lays gentle hands on Steve.
,” Tony exclaims. “And all of you knew, didn't you!”
They gather their things and Steve takes care of the bill. Thankfully, they don't have far to go—they're staying just a few floors up. The staff is obviously confused by their early departure from their dinner, but they don't ask any questions. Natasha plasters herself to Tony's side as they trek up to his room. Steve feels like he did after the plane crash, cold and aching everywhere, but he grits his teeth and pushes through it.
The phone buzzes as he takes it away from his ear.
Have you started learning internet slang?
Steve laughs, startled, and Bruce grins at him.  “I think he has a skewed sense of things,” Steve admits, and that is what makes Bruce start laughing.
His crush is getting seriously out of control.
“Uh,” he starts, before shaking his head as he pushes his baseball cap low as he works through the crowd.  “I was told to contact you about information?”
He used to know a lot of things.  Ever since he’s woken up in the future, Steve feels like he knows less and less.
“I don’t mind,” Tony says, his voice going softer.  “I like having people around more than some would think.”
Yeah, but we’re fine.
Steve shakes his head.  “I really don’t think so Tony.”
Head over to Germany.  We have some twitter intel
“You've had it before?”
“Yes sir,” JARVIS replies.
The video is on your tablet
“I fear I must disabuse you of that assumption,” JARVIS replies.  “I was never the one texting you. That was all sir.”
Tony.
“I swore I told you.  Maybe I told Fury and thought he would pass it to you.  Well whatever, you know now. I’ve got some of your stuff, some memorabilia, some of the Howling Commandos stuff too.  Maybe even some of Barnes’ things. Not sure. Dad’s got a whole warehouse of junk under the mansion. Next time you’re back, I’ll let you in.  You can take whatever you want.”
Instead Steve tightens his grip on the chain and lifts himself up a little more.  “I don’t even know you,” he admits.
“Coffee.”
“It’s good, great even,” Steve replies.  “But the info on the tablet. This is more than enough to start tracking down Bucky.”
Thor puts a hand on the back of Steve's neck, cupping it, his thumb stroking the tendon in Steve's neck and the relief, the instant flood of it, nearly takes his legs out from under him.
Tony steps in real close and kisses him on the corner of his mouth before pulling back.  “How do you feel about burgers.”
“Why did you attack us?” Steve asks the guy, pulling his arm back a little.
have your flirt on with your neighbor?”
Steve doesn’t end up seeing Tony until later that night.  He’s in the kitchen, cooking simple fried rice when Tony comes in, hand tugging at his Ironman red tie, and says, “I’ll pay you five times your salary to give me some of that.”
Steve wants to do that, to feed something into Tony's mouth, and he flushes hot at the thought. Instead, he digs in, copying Clint and Tony and pinching some of the food between a scrap of the brown sheet from his own plate and popping the whole thing in his mouth. The flavor is intense, completely taking over his tongue, followed by the tangy flavor of the pancake-like stuff. It's unlike anything Steve's ever eaten, despite some of the familiar flavors.
“Yeah,” Tony replies.
I don’t want to put Tony out.  He already does so much.
“You’re an emotional child Barton, so it works,” Tony says, like he is only paying half attention.  Clint weights the statement back in forth as he thinks about it before nodding like he grudgingly agrees with Tony.
It startles a laugh out of Steve from where he stands in the kitchen looking out onto the sea of trees with New York City in the distance, lighting up the night’s sky.  “Hey where are you? I wanted to thank you for your help, but I get lost in this place. Care to use the cameras to help direct me to you?”
So they're here with him in Los Angeles to show their support.
“I really don’t actually,” Steve responds.  “We fought a battle, you took a nuke through a wormhole and almost died, ate food with us, gave us everything we all needed to start our next phases, and then you picked up the bill after SHIELD left me hanging.  You build us levels in your tower, you built and entire compound for the Avengers to train at. All I’ve ever seen from you is being generous and a little over the top.”
He's going to play his cards very right.
“Goodbye, Justin! See you never!” Tony retorts.
Clint grins.  “She listens. She just doesn’t like to acknowledge them.  I think it low key annoys her, so of course I talk too much around her.”  He makes a face. “Probably uses it all to put together some psychological profile in her head about me.  Or social engineering experiments to hack my accounts. She’s evil like that.” He shrugs again, “Whatever, let’s head out.  Home base here is creepy without anyone really occupying it here.”
On stage, the Ironettes swivel their hips as one and Steve pictures Tony doing the same in those tiny, shiny shorts. His ears go blisteringly hot.
Steve sits there, staring at that text for a long time before replying with,
“How’s Pepper?” Steve asks, looking out into the dark night sky.  “Last time you said she was doing better.”
No.  But we’re still looking.
Tony had hedged the answer before distracting Steve with some other topic. Steve lets him because sometimes he thinks he wouldn’t even understand the answer if Tony gave it to him.)
Bruce closes his eyes with a soft smile before turning to face him.  “Yes, but not as much as I used to be.” He stands smoothly in a way that seems effortless.  Steve envies him. Even with the serum, he feels old today. “What have you doing captain?”
They watch as the compound burns down companionably outside when Sam asks, “How come he always answers you guys?”
“Always.”  And Steve finds he means it more than he thought, but pushes the thought away and follows Tony out of the room.
Steve looks him up and down, and Clint looks casual, jeans and a t-shirt and boots.  Like he’s finally taken a breath in after the Loki disaster. This is the Clint he’s heard mentions of in Natasha’s stories.  The one who is a “walking human disaster” and if he takes a shower, it’s “because he’s been covered in blood or bullied into it”.  “Oh hell,” Clint slumps. “What stories has Nat been telling you? I swear they are only half true.”
“How?” he asks.
in my system.”
Bucky shrugs.  His clothes are a little big on his frame, but he’s careful not to move the metal hand.  “Mostly. Still missing some stuff in here.”
Natasha presses up against Steve from behind to look around his shoulder and the ugly feeling in Steve's stomach recedes. “Dosed you with something?”
“Okay,” Steve says thickly.  “Thanks for all of this Tony.”  He swallows hard.
He studies Tony, the way he hold himself carefully still in this moment as he stares down Steve.  Steve is still out of touch with a lot of things. Still trying to learn his way around the future.  But he thinks of how Howard used to look at him. Like he was the answer to too many questions. Like Bucky’s exasperated but fond concern.
Steve’s given up trying to figure out what is going on there.  One mystery at a time.
“Was,” Clint shrugs bonelessly, and sometimes Steve wonders about his story.  How Clint came to be here, but he isn’t someone to be noisy like that. “Now I’m one of Tony Stark’s drivers.”
“Why?” Steve asks, curious.
“Hulk likes being the little spoon,” Bruce replies, very seriously. The tension is gone, broken as easy as that.
“When has she ever followed a single order I have given?” Tony deadpans, and Steve has to stifle a laugh into a cough.  “Don’t think I didn’t catch that grin,” Tony adds.
They end up stumbling towards Tony’s plane a half a mile away.  Steve’s healing but with a bullet wound in the gut, the meat hook still in his shoulder, and what is probably a concussion - he’s having a hard time walking in a straight line.  Tony is leading the way, still in the suit. He’s being short, succulent in a way Steve isn’t used to.
“True,” Bruce says, eventually when they have both settled.  “But I also don’t think he cares any more. He does what he wants and when he wants.  The only people whose opinion he cares about are the ones he lets in.” Bruce thins his lips.  “He’ll let us know if it’s too much, eventually. Or at least JARVIS will give us a heads up.”
“Yeah,” Tony says firmly, standing up with the clothes in a loose fist.  “I’m sure.”
Steve hmms, and Tony continues, “So they use site crawlers. Think of those as a Natasha for the internet to index any and all new sites.  I use alerts when those crawlers add ny websites with content around ‘avenger’ or your general names or codenames.”
He pulls the phone down from his ear and sees the text that reads,
“Your presentation was great, Tony. You're something else on stage.”
They would be called hypothesis’.
It looks like he may be retracing his steps
Just call sir
“I touched your face after that,” Natasha realizes aloud. “I think you're right.”
He moves side to side a little bit as the gunshots ping around him, trying to use Rumlow as a shield.  Steve hears Rumlow grunt as he gets hit once or twice before going silent, fingers falling limp. He knows he has to keep Rumlow there a few more moments.  It could be another fake out, but he’s losing his grip on the chain that is still biting into his hands, even though they are slick with his own blood at this point.
"Yeah,” Steve replies, peering around for any easy to spot cameras.  There is one under the United sign. “Cameras again?”
“Yes,” Tony returns as he walks through the opened doors of his room.  “But with the modifications you and I have spitballed on over the last year.  Make what you can and that keeps it within 24 hours.”
Steve puts his back to the wall, trying to keep himself still. Everyone is quiet while JARVIS runs the scan. After the light passes over Tony's body, he reaches out and puts his thumb against the keypad. A second later he draws back, sucking his thumb into his mouth.
Natasha catches Tony’s eye as they leave, and he flicks her off without looking back, trying to hurry past her.  Steve watches as she breaks into silent laughter. Clint, clearly disgruntled, goes fishing for his wallet before handing some money to Sam.  Bruce raises a mug of tea from his place in the corner before turning back to the movie he was watching. Bucky sits in a corner chair and cracks a smile when he sees Steve looking his way.
“I’m done,” Steve says and pulls out two bowls.  He evens out his proportioning before sliding the second one across to Tony with a spoon already inside.
(There are days when he misses superheroing like an ache in his chest, right in the middle of where the arc reactor used to be.
“I don't...think that's a good idea,” he finally manages to get out.
Tony sticks his tongue out at her.
JARVIS pauses carefully before replying, “Yes sir.  I calculate now would be a good time to check in on the progress of Mr Rogers if you wished.”
Thor grins. “Our Steve is always ready.”
“I cannot ping it either sir,” JARVIS says apologetically.  “Would you like me to call Natasha Romanov?”
“Years ago. We were doing a business deal in Ethiopia. Clint's obviously had more experience,” he says, raising his voice to carry across the table.
Tony huffs a laugh. “Practice. Lots and lots of practice. I used to be able to do stuff like that wasted, too.” He trails off thoughtfully.
“We weren’t really talking before all of this,” Steve offers up, and Tony huffs.
“Hey, you guys gonna dish up or what?” Clint says, waggling a silver kettle with a narrow spout. Tony raises an eyebrow at Clint, making no move to take it, so Steve does.
Rumlow ducks towards him to find cover, but Steve’s ready.   He swings his body forward, bringing his legs up so he can clench Runlow’s face between his thighs.  Rumlow reaches down to his tool belt, and Steve grips the chain tight as he lifts his lower body up. He groans as the meat hook pulls into his shoulder even more, but Rumlow’s forgotten about his tool belt with his air supply cut off and feet dangling off the ground.    His fingers are trying to pry Steve’s legs apart, so he locks his legs behind Rumlow’s head like Natasha has done to him so many times and before and squeezes. He can hear the other man’s skull creak ominously, a noise that isn’t completely the right noise, so there’s some metal in his skull, which means this just got a little harder.
Steve stills for a moment, and Clint can read the confusion in his face.  “God, when will Tony actually explain everything instead of bits and pieces?  Okay Cap, you’re stuck with me. We’re partners in crime for this hunt. Nat’ll probably stumble across us.  She usually does something like that with me when she has wandering missions. We get to use the jet. It’s part of the private security branch of SI.  Oh and Maria Hill is basically our chain of command for this sort of stuff. We’ll brief her in every once in a while, probably more because she has
Steve doesn’t know what to do with that.  Instead, he puts the phone down and starts working on finishing up his discharge paperwork.
There is another sighting in Belgium.  We’re working on the details.
Steve looks around, doesn’t see anyone else coming before heading back to Tony.  “It’s Rumlow,” Steve tells him. Tony doesn’t look away from where he is taking his shots and quietly counting under his breath.  When he reaches 15, he ducks back down and pulls out the magazine to reload. “He’s walking around with some metal enhancements.”
It takes a moment before it clicks. Sharon, the blonde nurse from next door who had later turned out to be Agent 13.  Natasha had filled him in about her before the split up in DC. Peggy’s niece who had been raised by Peggy in the halls of SHIELD.  She had gone CIA after everything.
Tony melts into the kiss, before stiffening and pulling back.  “Woah, wait didn’t you
“What’s up Cap?” Tony says after one ring.  Steve takes a second before responding, he honestly wasn’t expecting Tony to pick up that fast.
“Good,” Tony says.  “Now there is an account and credit card there in an envelope, and before you even open your mouth and say, ‘Tony I can’t’, it’s an advance on your current salary.  Also there is a folder on that tablet with some papers I need you to sign. We’ll back date it, so everything looks legal with the IRS when they eventually come knocking.  Let me know if you need anything else, but I think we should be good to go at this point.”
Is there a pattern here I’m not seeing.
“Well,” Tony responds.  “You are stopping some actual bad guys today, so I don’t think you are doing too shabby of a second job there.”
Steve JARVIS, I know you remember that.
Clint’s in the plane when Steve walks up to it on the tarmac.  He does a double take to Clint’s wide grin with his giant earphones around his neck.  “I thought you were on a mission.”
Tony laughs.  “JARVIS has that covered.”  A soft, almost fond,
He spends most of the flight talking to Tony, and the next day, and the next.  They go from talking every once in a while to every day. Now that Tony doesn’t hide behind JARVIS, he feed Steve the leads, additional information himself.
Bucky stands up and heads to him.  Everyone pulls a few steps away but watches them closely.  Bucky uses his flesh hand to grab the arm less bruised up. “Where is the medical gear in this place?”
“I can have one built in twenty three hours,” JARVIS calculates.  “Based off the latest Mark?”
“I’m missing my gear,” Steve replies.
Tony shrugs.  “No suits or arc reactor any more.  I wouldn’t be much of one in the field.  I’m strictly sticking to the desk duty these days.”
“You went through my medical records?”  Steve asks, curious.
The circle creaks ominously, before falling down and revealing Ironman in his familiar red and gold, facing him.  The eyes of the mask glow the familiar arc reactor white blue. And even though Steve’s seen Tony in no sleeve shirts and no glow through it, there is still some sort of arc reactor in the chest of the suit.
Been looking for you.  Where are you?
Steve unwinds and begins to slowly grin.  “How did you meet me?”
He types out quickly, ignoring the squeaks from Sam about, “Was that
As they get settled in to watch the movie, Steve glances over and catches Tony's eye again. Tony gives him a tiny smile and Steve's stomach flips. He wriggles deeper under Thor's arm, the warmth and weight of it washing through him in vibrating waves of contentment and he sees Tony frown. Nat pinches Tony's leg.
The line clicks before Steve can say anything else.  He pauses there, frozen, looking at the water as the sun makes it shades of maroon.
“Rush job,” Tony replies.  He looks to where Natasha and Steve are standing, and Steve knows the moment he sees how much he is leaning on Natasha.  “Let’s get bird brain and get out of here. Steve needs some medical attention. My plane is nearby.”
“Just go to Stuttgart,” Tony grounds out against his silence.  “Nat brought the jet to France. JARVIS clocked Barnes in Russia, and she’ll be your best tour guide for that part.”  He pauses. “I’m not...popular in Russia, so keep the SI talk down there. Put something over the logos of any of your tech.”
Steve looks out into the distance and sees something moving.  It’s blurry but he hair is familiar. He narrows his eyes, trying to see who it is and thinks he sees the lips moving in the shape of his name.
“Everyone at this table is classified,” Clint points out.
“Tony?” Natasha’s voice comes through, low and rough and that’s when he knows,
“Like we’re going to believe that,” Rumlow returns.  “They have been flying around in Stark planes using Stark tech.  You’ve been the man behind the machine since day one.”
So he texts Tony,
“SECURITY!” he shouts and Steve breaks into a run.
Steve can see the fire reflected  in her eyes. Between the tense lines of her face, Natasha seems younger - a little lost maybe.  She looks towards him a moment later, and Steve would almost call her vulnerable.
I saw you in the news with the blonde
, Steve types out.
There is a moment before another bubble pops up,
Yeah, your girlfriend?
If you’re sure.
“I should have called you,” Steve says.  He doesn’t follow it up with,
“What do you mean?” Clint says just before she ducks and slides down right when a bar stool breaks behind her where her head was a second ago.  He ducks too before slinking under the table.
? JARVIS instantly replies.
“Okay,” Steve says. He believes him. “You’re handsy tonight, that’s all.”
He looks around, and Natasha’s got one guy on the ground and in a half handstand as she pulls down the second guy, half passed out with his head between her thighs.  Clint got two pool cues and using them to beat up the fourth guy, who looks pretty bruised.
Good.  Sir is working on some SI initiatives.
Steve can't resist the order in Tony's voice, so he raises his eyes.
Tony had invited them to the Stark Expo under the guise of all of them needing a vacation, but he’s been working night and day for months to prepare for the Expo and Steve knows he’s proud of what’s being presented. A few years ago they'd have all assumed—except maybe Natasha—that Tony genuinely didn't care what they think about his work, but these days they know better.
Tho, she laughed in my face about it.
“Oh,” he had said.
“He was. Released for good behavior.”
Steve looks down at Bruce who shrugs.  “Like I said, he was been watching out for you all a lot.”  He take his leave as Steve sits hard down in the chair Bruce has been occupying for a while.  He stays there until the sun is high in the sky, just watching.
Tony tilts his head like he can read between the lines, and he probably can.  They’ve been a year talking about anything and everything - especially post missions.  He knows exactly how much Steve worries about the rest of the team. “Fine. We all split up.  Sam’s taking care of the snipers and Nat and Clint are working their way to our position right now.”
“Any cute ladies catch your eye?” Tony asks after a moment of silence.
“You’re not,” Tony says, quietly.  His spoon scrapes the bottom of his bowl and Steve looks back at him.  “I do what I want, how I want, when I want. If it wasn’t helping you, it would be some other side project.  And this makes me feel useful.”
Tony has very little time he gets to spend on what he wants these days.  Sleep, surfing the web, food, and coffee are some of the things he like to spend in between the moments where he is signing papers, approving projects, firing people.
“Got it,” she replies tightly.  “We’ll get him back Tony.”
Back before Jarvis told me it was you
Steve bites his cheek. He aches all over, the cold still clinging to his bones.
Lol ok
Tony leans into her touch. “Feel kinda drunk. Kinda not. Touching feels
Steve smirks, “Can we pick up someone else?”
He asks JARVIS.
Clint goes, “Whatever you want to do.  This is your mission. I’m just along for the ride and sweet paycheck to make sure you don’t try to die again
“What are you doing here?” he asks, studying Natasha.  She looks tired to be honest, but he knows he has bags under his eyes too.  He spends most nights imaging what happened to Bucky those years he was under the ice to get him to the man he saw in DC.  This isn’t the one he grew up. He’s completely different, and the more Steve thinks about it, the less he knows what to do about that.
Tony had built a tracking program to put together footage of Bucky and shifted through the information with some algorithm to discover what was the most useful.  JARVIS refused to tell Steve where the original software had come from - only admitted Tony needed to tweak some things in the initial program.
His voice is low, but Steve can still hear when he mutters, “He doesn't even want to get close to me when it
Natasha shrugs one shoulder. “If you want to be a huge nerd about it.”
“Yeah,” Tony murmurs, eyelids falling to half mast. “Feels good.” Then he shudders suddenly and, grimacing, scoots away from Steve on the bench.
How did Pepper take it?
His heart is in his throat, because maybe Steve is dead.  Maybe Steve is captured and being experimented on -
“Good,” Tony nods, pulling out his phone with his free hand.  “I know just the place. Ready to go?”
Tony nods earnestly, but his eyes give him away.  They are carefully blank. “Yeah, that one!”
“JARVIS said there was a powder on my face and hands. I bet it got on me after he put his scummy face all over mine and then I rubbed it and voila.”
Heat curls up Steve’s neck and into his ears. “Yes,” he admits, strangled. He and the rest of the Avengers—minus Tony—are in the front row at the 2014 Stark Expo welcome event in a specially roped off area just for them.
Tony missed it.  And Steve wanted to know what it was like to truly work side by side with him again.
She tilts her head, inspecting the room, and Steve leans back and takes a moment to mock outrage as he follows her gaze to the right.  The barkeep just finishes searching for something under the bar, a disgruntled look as he straightens and puts up one finger to the customer at the bar before heading to the back.
“Including the new suit, thanks for that by the way, I hadn’t even thought about the fact I needed a new one.”  Steve returns and takes a few steps into the dining area. He lets his free hand clutch onto the back of the chair and tentatively tightens his grip.  It doesn’t creak ominous, and Steve has to smile at that. That’s something Tony had to take into account for this compound - his and Hulk’s increased strength.
You’ll let me know if Tony needs anything?
Steve asks, because Tony is a private individual and JARVIS was not part of any search.  He was part of Tony’s private, non contractual work that SI didn’t own and his own attorneys had patented within an inch in so many various ways that no one could understand how he had actually done it, per Natasha one frustrated afternoon of attempting to decipher the paperwork.
“Nah, just had J hack your GPS.  It’s easier than you think.” There is some distracted tapping in the background, like texting.  Steve had gotten use to the clatter of thumbs on glass after all the times he spent wandering around DC.  “Okay there should be a man in a suit coming to your left -
Steve frowns and turns in his seat to face Tony more fully. “You are flushed.” He cups a hand around Tony's shoulder and a juddering gasp slips from Tony's mouth, his eyes going even darker. He licks his lips again and Steve's stomach flutters.
Steve isn’t completely weak, but his shirt is soaked with blood, and he’s feeling a little woozy.  He’s too off his game for there to not be some drugs in his system. And if Rumlow is what he looks to be, then they probably have him on something that will take a while to get out of his system - if they don’t reup his dose.
“Steve. Come on.” Tony holds out a hand and Steve stares at it.
I’ve got too much going on.
Pepper?
“Could you come help?” Steve asks in the quiet of the moment.  And for a second it’s too honest, too much to ask for, and he knows it.
and know he’s not giving them up. Rumlow stares Tony up and down for a moment before going, “You know, I just don’t trust you.”
Steve opens his mouth to answer, but Bucky is the one who beats him to the punch.  “His momma’s name was Sarah. He put newspaper in his shoes. And the kid got the flu every year before he got muscled up.”
Tony shrugs one shoulder. “It's fine, it's whatever, I'm not gonna twist your arm.”
?  Are we talking a one night stand?”
Captain there has been a sighting of Barnes in DC again.
Her mission had been to make sure he could handle the load of working and being a normal person outside the Triskelion.  She had had her own missions from time to time, but her primary mission had been him.
He hangs up and Natasha puts the phone back in her pocket before eyeing the computer stack.  She goes back into the hallway and comes back a moment later with a rusted pipe and begins to smash everything until it’s in smithereens.  He, Clint and Sam silently watch as she methodically destroys any source of data.
Steve’s crossed the room and pulled Tony close, kissing him before Tony can keep talking, because the words coming out of Tony’s mouth are so
“You okay without Natasha out there working on your stuff?” Steve asks.  He knows they have been working on something. He can sometimes hear her in the background, talking in low whispers in the middle of their conversations at all hours.  Bruce sometimes too. Hulk, once or twice.
She pauses, static crackling on the line.  “Are you sure?” And there is something there in between what she is saying and how she is reacting that Tony should acknowledge, but there isn’t enough time to study it.  Pull it apart and figure out what she isn’t saying.
Everyone piles back out of the limo and then into the garage elevator. Their dinner reservation is at a restaurant on one of the upper floors.
, and turns to his contacts.  He dials Tony, listens to the phone ring change before there is an out of breath, “You okay?”
“I can see your self satisfied grin right now.”
He always figures it out.
“Yeah,” Tony replies.  “Did I not tell you that?”
“I love them,” Steve replies, squeezing Tony’s hand.
about this sort of mission.”
Tony groans and it feels like Steve’s hair stands on end. “That’s good. It’s been years, oh my god.”
Clint reaches across the table to feed his second bite to Natasha.
No one answers.  The wind takes his words with it when it howls suddenly, and Steve focuses on making it back before he freezes.
“Of course I do!” Steve blurts and then goes stock still, mouth still open. Tony and Natasha's gazes turn toward him.
Tony reaches behind his right ear, and there it is.  He twirls the screwdriver in his fingers back in and forth in a lazy order for a while before he sighs.  “I should take break shouldn’t I?”
Steve feels unbearably guilty about that.  Natasha’s mentioned the amount of stress Tony is under these days.  He’s caught the news here and there on their trek. Watching coverage of press conferences.  Tony working to clean up New York and now D.C. Launching initiatives for scholarships, working on clean energy.  He’s out at galas and museum openings, smiling a bit too wide, laughing in a way Steve doesn’t imagine him when they are talking.
Manhattan would have gone so much better if he had known how to read Tony, he realizes now.  Tony was trying to tell him things back then. He just didn’t take the time to listen.
“Jay told me you had some information on a friend of mine?  I’m looking for him,” Steve says, and hopes he doesn’t sound too desperate.  The SHIELD issued phone creaks precariously in his hand.
“Also you’re about to need some back up in the fight that is about to break out,” she adds lowly to Clint.
“Why'd I ask?” Clint says with a grin and raises his hand, pointing at Tony's place. “Can we get a coffee for this guy?”
We’re good, really.
He looks up and clocks a CCTV camera following him as he walks.  “You watching me?” he asks.
“Yeah, fine,” Tony says breezily, letting his elbow press into Steve's open hand. “I'm good. I just hate that guy.” With permission to touch, Steve isn't shy about checking to make sure Tony's really okay. His neck is a little red. Apparently, the other man had a good grip on him. Steve huffs, aggravated.
“All the work you are doing here in Africa,” Steve replies.  “I can’t help but notice the trail of SI initiatives following in our wake. You know you don’t have to, but I would like to take some credit for it if it is.”
That’s when the hook behind him gets yanked on, and Steve can’t hide the low groan.  He falls back into the motion, turns and hunches, making the guy unsteady on his feet before sweeping the man’s feet out from under him.  He goes down, hard and lets go of the chain. Steve takes what little is left and wraps it around his hands before turning towards the footsteps to his right and jabs right at the second man.  He then takes the chain and wraps it around his neck until he passes out and let’s go, watching the man slumps in front of him.
And even I know that trick
Steve wakes up to a screaming pain in his right shoulder and the feeling in his head that he’s floating.  He blinks into awareness and recognizes he’s still in the middle of the warehouse in South Africa they were going to check out because there had been some sightings of Bucky around the area.
Bruce nods.  “I suspected.”  At Steve’s raised eyebrow, he adds, “Tony spends a lot of time with you guys on camera, even when he is working.  Trying to keep an eye on you or getting ahead of the things you need before you ask. He doesn’t have much spare time these days, so he’s gotten pretty good at multitasking.”
Tony laughs like the world isn’t falling apart around them.  A carefree sound that Steve can only remember before the war, before his mother died, in stuttering images of his pre-serum memory.  Like they are images put together in a projector, missing moments between each picture. “You sound like a spy in an old film,” he teases.
Tony is lying on the ground, lights still on, but not exactly moving just yet.  Rumlow is nowhere to be seen, but he hears a distant engine.
Tony tosses the rocket launcher in the air, shoots it with a gauntlet before zeroing on on Rumlow again.  “So, ready to surrender yet?”
Still, he shouldn’t be leaning so much on him or JARVIS.  Steve should be doing this the old fashioned way, on his own.
“You know him?” Tony’s suit vocalizes in the carefully modularized tone.
Yes Captain.
Tony laughs, helplessly a little.  But it’s realer, nicer. His body language is loose, not tight and shut down.  It reminds him of Clint when he is trying to make Steve see something his way. What Tony forgets is Steve is stubborn. “But what I meant is I don’t spend a year housing, paying and helping on an adventure like yours if I don’t like you.”
He’s still stuck on the first part, “You can see me?”
Uh, going into a tunnel.  Can’t talk. Losing sig-
Could he be remembering?
“Knew you wouldn’t forget my pretty face,” Rumlow says.  His face is a ruined mess of burnt and wrinkled flesh. He looks like he has been crushed and burned and then put back together.  His right eye is electronic, glowing an eerie red. He flexes the hand not putting the mask on his belt, and it whirs a little, like Bucky’s did in DC, and Steve is starting to see that HYDRA isn’t after Bucky to bring him in.  They want to eliminate him.
Tony pauses for a long moment before returning with, “You just haven’t been hanging with the right people.  Now go, leave me alone. I’ve got to get this finished.”
I am Captain
“Hey punk,” Bucky says, breaking the odd silence.
JARVIS had shared,
“I wish I was.”
“Oh my god, this is
He pushes past a mother laughing with her child, careful not to jostle their load as he looks up at the leaving flights.
“I was trained here,” she says shortly after a long time.
“I don't
There is a sharp bark of laughter. “No, it’s not Captain.”  And the voice is familiar. Steve has to stare in the direction of the voice and wait for his eyes to adjust, (something he hadn’t had to do in the dark since before the serum) and for a second that terrifies him - that he’s drugged with something that could mess with the serum.
Tony hums before replying, “Yeah I just finished a write up with Jay.  Come by the compound, and we’ll get you all the gear you need.”
Tony pauses for a moment before hunching over the table.  It’s not something he wants to talk about, that last phone conversation.  He shouldn’t have said yes. He needs to be here, finishing up the transition with Pepper - even though she could tun SI in her sleep at this point - and make sure the latest StarkTablet gets out on time even though the engineering branch has fucked the entire project beyond even Tony’s standards.  He’s probably going to have to start from scratch at this point. “Nah, I need to work on this.”
“Thanks Tony,” Steve vocalizes, still bitterly cold, even away from the snow.  There is something about this place that makes it feel colder. Like the winter’s before the serum when they didn’t have enough money for the gas bill.
“Yeah,” Clint grins, bloodthirsty.  “This is a lighter suit than usual.”
Clint hoots. “'I'll pick up a couple brawls on my way home, maybe a tussle.'”
“You don't even go to the grocery store without going for a fight,” Nat drawls and Steve rolls his eyes at her.
He takes in the scene, a mostly empty bar where they were supposed to meet an twitter user who had promised information that JARVIS had thought may be legitimate. The bar’s emptied out, and there is no one left.  Another dead end.
Sam leans into his space one dark night in Russia and says, “Who are you texting all the time?” as quietly as he can when they are all on a jet together.
Steve almost ponders it, types out,
There is a pause where Steve thinks about what that means.  He’ll have something of home. Something that is his again. Maybe his old sketchbook from before everything, maybe the stuff from his place with Bucky.
,Tony returns
.  Because Natasha rarely looked like that, and it was the same look in her eye when she had turned to Steve, right before she turned on the emulator and said,
“Kinda grabby, huh?” Clint says.
“You know I don’t just do this sort of stuff for anyone,” Tony says, finally.  Steve watches him keep looking out the window, careful to not look back at Steve.  But he can tell Tony is watching him in the glass, so he keeps his face carefully neutral and stays still.
Steve doesn’t hear the answer but sees the men on the right approaching.  He slides his eyes away and sees them keep coming out of the corner of his eyes - thinking he can’t see them.  Yeah, definitely dosed with something, but he can feel it all coming back, bit by bit. He lets get the men five feet away, listening to Tony speak to the others as he reloads, before leaping up, over Tony’s head and taking them on.
“Wow, you know how to make a girl feel pretty,” Tony returns as he finally pulls off the tie.  “God I hate these things. But seriously is there enough for me to grab some too? If not, I need to call the chinese place and get some because now I have a craving.”
“Hi, Happy,” they reply in a disjointed chorus. They pile into the limo. Steve's mildly embarrassed by the way everyone leaves him a space next to Tony, but he's also grateful. He loves being in Tony's orbit.
bubble shows for a long moment before a reply appears.  He doesn’t know it until after he reads the text, but Steve has been holding his breath the entire time.
“The rest?” Steve asks, careful not to let his concern leak into his voice.
Steve sends back a frustrated
“Shit,” Tony says, stretching his face. “Shit, Steve, I think you're right.”
Tony starts to act strange not long after they’re escorted to the rooftop patio. Steve makes a joke, something dumb about LA versus New York, and Tony giggles like Steve's said something actually funny. He leans into Steve's shoulder, the way he used to when he still got drunk regularly. Steve has mixed feelings about it. He doesn’t like it when Tony drinks, but he misses how physically affectionate Tony had been when he drank.
“God, do you know someone everywhere?” Clint asks when they get into the storage room.  “Also where are we?”
Natasha pushes a rolling cart away from the far wall, grabbing a key from underneath one of the middle rungs and revealing a door against the old bricked wall.  She unlocks it, puts the key back and ushers them through it, closing the door swiftly behind them.
Then he remembers Pepper’s glowing skin, Rhodey’s steely resolve, his breathless worry sneaking under his skin until he couldn’t think, couldn’t
“She’s good.  It’s awkward after everything.  We broke up in the middle of her treatments, and I think we both feel better about it.  Less pressure with everything.” Steve can see him sitting there in his kitchen, drink in hand, shrugging.  “I miss being part of a unit like we were, but I get it. It’s just different.”
Tony ducks his head to the side before grinning.  “Okay,” he tells Steve, barely above a whisper. “Stay here and just trust me.”
Somehow, Steve thinks that is a deflection, but lets Tony have it.  “I think I should go,” Steve says. “We’re about to head out.”
He can hear the way Tony swallows. “Wars and guns don’t make many friends.  Business makes even less. Stay in touch Capcicle.”
“Globe trotting,” Steve replies, not sure exactly how much Bruce knows.  “Natasha, Clint, and a friend of mine Sam are here too.”
“Well that is the first time I’ve been called pretty today,” Steve quips.
The waiter returns with Tony’s coffee and a companion, who carries a massive round silver tray covered in piles of bright colored food. Behind him is another guy with six plates carefully balanced on both arms. Those have rolls of something thin and brown. Up close, it kind of reminds Steve of a crepe.
“Weapons dealer,” Tony grins before sharply ducking.  He presses a hand to his ear as they both huddle behind a crate.  “How much longer J?”
A lucky break a few weeks later puts Bucky in Tunisia, so they head out in the middle of the day without saying goodbye.  Steve doesn’t like the feeling and has gotten used to everyone being in the same space, eating meals together and watching movies every night.
We can do without that.  We just need a place to stay.
Bruce interrupts him.  “You know,” he starts, “I told him he wouldn’t want to keep me around here.  There was too good of a chance of a Hulk-out, and he doesn’t need the attention. You know what he told me?”  Bruce’s demeanor changes, shifting his balance until he leans in a little and gestures widely enough that the remnants of his tea nearly fly out of his cup.  “‘I’m been doing what I shouldn’t for this long ,and it hasn’t caused me any problems I care about yet.’”
don’t
“Give him J’s number,” Tony advises.  “That way I can coordinate a flight out as soon as you are ready.”
“I don’t know what google alerts are,” Steve returns flatly.
“Yeah,” Tony agrees, rubbing his jaw. “Not usually a kisser, but it's been awhile.” He gives a full body shudder and shakes himself. “
“Vodka,” she replies, deadpanned.  There is a pause, and in that moment, something eases in her.  She doesn’t completely unwind, but there is something in her face that reminds him of Natasha instead of just a soldier.
, Steve thinks.  Oh.
He flies back again, hitting one of the hummers and feels the impact down to his bones.  He tries to roll over and move, but everything hurts. Still, he sees Rumlow throw a glowing sort of grenade that attaches itself to Tony before going off in a blinding light.
“Uh huh,” Steve says.
The security guard at the curtain checks each of their IDs carefully before allowing them back.
Have you had any sightings?
“Or 15 you smug asshole.”
“That’s true,” Steve replies.  “I just kind of want this over thought.  I want to go back to New York and take a moment and just sit down.  Not having to be rushing, you know.”
Clint nods and leads the way out of the building.  Tony takes the rear, and Steve can feel his careful gaze behind him the entire way out.
The morning breakfasts where everyone staggers in and makes jokes about Tony having to pay for them all to his disgruntled pre-coffee face.
“Bye Tony,” Steve says.
Natasha reaches out and takes Tony's hand and Tony sags, stepping toward her. She strokes his face. “That wasn't so bad.”
(Later, he finds newspapers Natasha leaves him in the hospital room.  Headlines like
“We suspected,” Tony admits.   “I wasn’t sure how much he was following you or it was an accident.  After Germany, I was suspicious.” The clanging of shots pause, and Tony shoots up.  Steve sees some more guys around the corner, and Tony mutters, “I got them.”
everything has gone to shit.  Like worst levels of shit.
“My friends will get to me,” Steve bites back, because they don’t leave a man behind.  They aren’t like that. Sam won’t let it go.
“I think I should -” Steve starts before Tony comes back on the line.
Steve laughs, even though it hurts because he hasn’t heard someone call him Stevie in that tone in years.  Never thought he would hear it again. “Just got in another fight. Of course you show up after.”
Clint shrugs, face twisting a little bit.  “I save my words for people who will listen to them.”
Helping Steve and the others is almost as good a high as a good cup of coffee these days.  Something he can grab with his hands and see the results of. See the way the ring of a phone eases the lines on Steve’s face.  Hears the laughter that he can startle out of Steve sometimes from halfway across the world.
That’s what makes this dance chill something deep in his gut.
“Yeah,” he says as he looks up into the night sky.  It’s deep blues and and purples splashed across the side of the wall.  “I think I can stay out of trouble that long.”
Steve laughs as he hangs up, cutting off Tony’s rant mid sentence, because he’s gotten used to it by now.
They are in constant contact the month he and the team search Tunisia.
He has to blink away the white after images until he can focus on the red and gold circle of metal around Tony.  It has to be some last ditch effort for security, because Tony has told him countless times he doesn’t have a suit.  Not any more.
“The amount of shirts the merchandising side of the nonprofit has sold with the outline of your shield and helmet covers it,”  There is a pause and the shutting of doors. “Like I said, don’t worry about it. How do you like your new gear?”
Steve almost goes,
Tony pulls his head back, frowning, and his hand comes off of Steve’s arm. “No,” he says sharply. “I’m sober.”
(He had been mad at Natasha for not telling him until she had said, “I wanted to get you dating.  That was one of the ways to trigger the end of her mission.”
Suddenly the main cabin door opens and the steps fold down.  All four look at each other before Clint takes off, Natasha at his back.  Sam helps him make it to the stairs as fast as they can.
, he mouths.  Steve rolls his eyes and turns back to the path Tony is leading him to the elevator.
“If you’re sure,” Steve says, careful not to push.  He remembers Natasha remarking that Tony got rid of all his suits - all but walked away from the life except for helping him.
Tony’s standing around in jeans and a band shirt, hair wildly pointed in every which direction after he has run his hands through it while narrating some things he needs to restock on to JARVIS.  Steve has been standing in the doorway, waiting for Tony to acknowledge for a while, but Tony has been steadily ignoring him since they got back from South Africa, Bucky in tow.
