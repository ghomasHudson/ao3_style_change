“Don’t worry, his scammery isn’t contagious.”
“Oh, you
Dean bowed. “Thanks! It took three brain cells to think of it.”
here's a gif of Cas praying for Greg's kneecaps that I made today while visiting my grandma:
Hermione patted him on the arm, shooting him a lopsided grin. “I know. I asked whether you’d like help with the Summoning Charm. It’s not that difficult, you just need more practise and less distraction.”
And that’s why Sherlock hadn’t left the attic since seven in the morning when he had awoken, instead opting for reading the journal. Irene had just closed the door as he jerked from the depths of sleep and dreams. She hadn’t returned since then, assuming that she immediately got to socialising. At least there was the warrant that she would let the rest of the household know that he was still asleep and no one would bother him for some time.
“We fled to Oregon, avoiding frequented roads and bigger towns. Gloria took her mother’s jewelry and we eloped, hoping to start a new life where none of us knew a soul. I built a small cottage on an island not too far from this waterfall where we could be together in peace. We lived there for eight months until one night our local sheriff knocked on our door with his fellow men to take me in handcuffs.
Irene hurried upstairs as quietly as possible. “Jake!” she hissed, reaching for the window. “Cas is coming -- I’m sorry to rush you out like this, but he had a rough day. I brought you food, will you be able to take it?”
“Are they?”
“Ah, so I was right about the kink?” Sherlock lightened up and his head made an appearance from behind the magazine stand. Greg gave up. He knew from Irene and John that Sherlock indulged in experiments of stranger nature. Hell, John even reiterated some of Sherlock’s ‘deductions’, how he called it. Truth be told, it would sound a bit incredulous if he hadn’t known a person who indulged in the same hobby. But as much as Anderson was a pain in Greg’s fancy French Canadian ass, he wasn’t sure he wanted to witness the deduction of his personal
“She asserted her dominance as the supereme lesbian in this house,” John said matter of factly. “So… there’s that.”
coming back,” she whispered, more to herself than to them. She then looked at Sherlock, her blank face suddenly frowning. He felt a pang of unease; it was as though she recognised him, in spite of the fact that he’d never set foot on this soil in his life prior to this year.
we're back!
“Sounds good,” Greg nodded, pushing the now empty ceramic bowl towards the middle of the table.
“It means that he likes his friend, and that friend likes him back, and neither of them act on it, but still desire each other a lot.”
you need, Greg,” Florida said. “I don’t talk to mediums anymore, had an incident a couple years ago that I don’t want to repeat.”
"No," he swallowed. "None of us have seen him, thankfully. Have you?"
She sent out a wave of wind that knocked them down, gathering on intensivity. Sherlock felt strong arms on his shoulders as John helped him stay up,the former leaning against him back-to-stomach.
in which there is skepticism
“I’ll show you,” she said, leading him to the enchanted stairs. After a moment of silence interrupted only by their echoing steps, she asked, “How does it feel to be a champion?”
“Are you both fucking serious?” Greg gaped. “I mean, I know you told me you went out once, and you were docked points for that too, but
"So you’re the guy I was supposed to visit?" Fletcher blurted out, his voice seeping with annoyance (and it was in itself annoying to listen to).
“But why not?” she asked, an expression of hurt shadowing her face.
“We’re here!” Mrs. Hudson announced and they pulled up in front of the shabbiest of shacks Sherlock could ever imagine. Well, if he squinted his eyes so that they were almost certainly shut, then it would pass as acceptable.
“Is the lake big?” Sherlock asked nonchalantly and he read the last few pages of the local newspaper. Even the crossword was worse than a regular newspaper’s.
“Do blue!” someone shouted.
Steps from the side betrayed Gabe’s inevitable arrival, and John braced himself for the unknown.
“John--”
“You gave me a coupon to the local boxing club,” she said, bemused. Sherlock took the boxing coupon from her to inspect it. “Really, if you don’t have the permit, just say so and stop wasting my time. I have sudoku to finish.”
“But, Greg!” Philip Anderson, the local news (trash) reporter, said. He showcased him two t-shirts he liked especially well. “There is an important distinction between ravens and crows! How can you expect me to make a decision when both birds are equally fascinating?”
“I’ve done bigger,” Mrs. Hudson assured him. She put her arms on her hips as if to dare him to challenge her again. “Why do you think I’m taking my knitting needles with me everywhere?”
“Yeah, right. As if the last ti…. Hm, well. Who knows. I think it’ll take a bit longer than that.”
“Not bad,” he shrugged, walking with them down to the Great Hall to resume their homework. “I am getting better as a Keeper. Maybe we’ll win the last game against Ravenclaw. Hey, Sherlock - how do you feel about the prospects of your team?”
“You two are like Dumb and Dumber, but enhanced to modern Canadian-British edition,” Irene fake cried over their disheartening pining. “Have you
It’s not like he planned to fall asleep in the first place. But last night they had gotten back from a case, and he hadn’t found himself nearly as exhausted as he usually was, so he decided to simply read in bed while John snored away, deservedly so. Later, however, Rosie’s cries reached Sherlock through the baby monitor, and he hushed it sooner than it alerted John’s peace. Rosie, though, had had bad dreams and clung to Sherlock, so he decided to take her to his and John’s bedroom to stay the night, which worked. He tucked them in with Rosie lying on his chest, but she rolled off eventually, and Sherlock felt himself being dragged under the soft pillows of dreams too.
The piano notes rolled over one another fluently, halting with a whirl of drama Irene intended to embody, inhaling a deep breath in her lungs, her free hand clutching over her heart as she raised her head in tune to the lyrics.
Oh, and there's more coming with Queen and Bowie! This is just the beginning! I have a lot of things in mind :3
“Hey, slow down,” John cut through his endless train of thought, his voice enough to rattle Sherlock’s monologue. Sherlock’s neck snapped up to lock their eyes, and there was a small and reassuring, if a little sad smile tilting the corner of John’s mouth almost imperceptibly. “Let’s not fall into the whirlwind and overthink, okay? Focus on me for a bit. Talk to me. Please.”
“Honestly, Irene! He’s a dog, a bloody dog! Of course it’s easier to find certain clues better, he has heightened sense of smell like all canines do. Plus, he’s closer to the ground.”
"We'll work on it," Sherlock said, more to himself than John, but the Gryffindor overheard him and poked him for that.
“First of all, there’s only four of us,” Sam reminded him, “and second, I need to talk to you guys about something. Now.”
John raised an eyebrow as he looked incredulously at the other man. “Is that really the argument you want to go with here?”
“It’s the alpha, Sir. He’s gone into a haze. We can’t get close enough to see what’s going on.”
An awkward silence descended heavily on the car as it began to move. After everything said already, neither man knew what to say as the vehicle began to roll slowly through the city. John was struck with the realization that for the most part, Sherlock was still a mystery to him. It was strange, John felt as if he had known the omega for weeks or months, certainly much longer than the handful of hours that had actually passed.
, Sherlock slumped back in his grimy seat, letting his eyes wander over the scenery of the familiar pine trees.
“It is,” John agreed, enjoying the view tremendously with Sherlock by his side. The cliff they were on wasn’t that high above the bird sanctuary. Maybe three meters. A yellow and purple parrot fluttered by, perching itself on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“You’re weird.”
“Who shut you down?” Irene asked, looking apprehensive. She shouldn’t, John basically started it and allowed the question to be formed, but he didn’t mind.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock inquired. He watched Irene frantically move about the room looking for something. She proclaimed a mighty ‘
’ -- you have no right for that. Oh, I’m sure he’s not as sentimental about the Shack, just look at the state of it.”
"I'd guess Sherlock Holmes," John laughed and outstretched his hand to Greg. "I'm John Watson while we're at it."
Blake focused on the colour, shutting his eyes closed. He had to pronounce it right and not embarrass himself. “Crinus Muto!” he said, saying it as clear as he could, and white light shone from the tip of his wand. When he looked up, people stared at him, grinning, some of them laughing.
Muffled clatter from the kitchen roused him from his thoughts intrusively. He glared in its general direction through the slits of his eyelids, vision blurred by residues of sleep. He needed to drink some water; his mouth was dry. And then he needed to use the bathroom.
“I’ve always been,” Dean arched an eyebrow. He glanced at John and Sherlock. “You two are good then? No need for jeans or t-shirts? I’ve got fake credit cards to pay for it.”
“No. I’m sorry, but none of that. Nothing new indicating any progress,” Hudders sighed. Greg toyed with his car keys that lay on the table in front of him. This was shitty.

Donna gaped at him. “What do you mean ‘that wouldn’t work’? TARDIS takes us to the future
“Huh. A crazy ex indeed.”
"I'll stop eating like a goblin when you start liking Christmas," John said, finishing his third toast.
“With me.”
Irene gave her a pointed glare, then swiftly looked to the right to indicate Cas, then to the left to imply the gift shop as a form of escape from the very unsuspecting Mrs Hudson. Kate leaned to the side to look at the man. Her brows jumped up and down and she got up, nodding.
She disappeared outside, and soon the three teens followed out and into Mrs Hudson’s awaiting truck. The radio played
Cas focused on Mrs Hudson, doing his signature head tilt. Mrs Hudson blinked. “Hi. I’m Castiel,” the angel said, dusting off his palms in the sink, which resulted in a red paprika cloud arising above it.
see Sherlock be happy and not hurt. And it was disheartening to see him deny himself this hypothetical joy of a relationship with John Watson when she saw it would only blossom and grow. In the end, she did see John’s reaction when she told him Sherlock’s into guys that second day at the Shack.
“Your words wound me,” she pouted mockingly, giggling at the flustered pair. “Relax, I’m joking. Maybe.”
Sam listened to her trying to act as normally as possible. He had to keep up their ruse in front of Greg.

I may write their POV on that one day actually...
Sherlock’s face was unreadable, his mouth thin and tightly pressed together, those extraordinary eyes showing more green in the light where they stood. “As I said that day, the journal never lied to us. And once you eliminate the impossible -- so, our chances to escape without harm -- whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”
“I’ll grow this year,” Sherlock sulked, eliciting a laugh from John. It tingled in his chest lightly and warmly, and he certainly wanted to hear it more. “I’m serious,
Sherlock felt his lips curling into a genuine smile. Maybe this stay won’t be
The girl was leaning her upper body on a flat, hot pink floatie. Sunglasses in heart shapes covered her eyes from the glistening sunlight reflection on the lake as she observed nature around her. Irene dove under and kicked to swim as far as possible, only to burst from underneath the floatie with a gasp when her lungs burned from not having enough oxygen.
From ground to ceiling, stashes upon stashes of files and crates crowded the space. The two friends watched it in silence for a few seconds, absorbing the view and getting used to the lightning.
Florida waved a hand dismissively. “Ah, the usual. Got into a fight with frogs because they refused to forecast the weather for me. Little green idiots. As if I ever needed them!”
“They better. How about we talk about something that doesn’t piss us off?”
a vampire? She could be like Edward Cullen and she could be like Bella (with more character development, though…. and personality that didn’t resemble bland cardboard). Yeah, that could work!
“Sherlock’s still salty over that Black Friday fiasco that happened last year in Toronto,” Irene snickered, ducking away from her brother who reached to flick her in the ear. John walked two steps behind them, witnessing their banter with a smile quirking his lips. “Don’t tell me you’re not! You wanted that mug with kittens for ages!”
A! NEW! CHARACTER! INTRODUCED!
He bent his knee and bumped Sherlock’s side, his gaze unrelenting but soft. And John saw that smile tug at his lips! Ha. Then it changed into a more serious expression. “But I meant it, John. Your food’s getting cold. Get up.”
“What’s wrong?” he had asked, confused. He inspected his cup thoroughly, brows knitted into a frown.
“John, you’re staring,” Sherlock’s baritone lured him out of his thoughts.
“Cas, haven’t you, by chance, met a hunter or a person who may have written this journal?” Sherlock asked while his step-sister showed John her three latest polishes.
A smack of skin-on-skin contact made him turn around, squinting into the semi-darkness of his room. Irene stood in the middle, fingers splayed on her face as she cumbersomely stared at him through the slits. “You
The burning may be relevant, but how? Would it release a spirit into the air that would lead them to the true record of the town? Would the ashes burn into the wood beneath, revealing an arrow pointing in a direction where the answers lay? Jeez, he was getting ahead of himself. All those TV shows on Netflix kept suggesting lots of scenarios, but what should he trust? His instinct told him that
begun.
Sherlock reached for another piece of slightly burnt popcorn and dipped it in the sauce. It was simply delicious. John seemed to notice his satisfaction, because he asked, “Like it?”
But enough of that! I hope you all are doing well! How's life treating ya? I hope you don't get robbed by any conspicuous racoons ;)
John contemplated it, looking from Sherlock to the backpack and at the greenery besides them. “Good point. I’ll go first, but you keep close to me, alright?”
“That's pretty cryptic if you ask me,” John said, shoving one hand in the pocket of his khaki shorts.
John jerked at the mention of his name, he was lost in thought staring at the kids opposite of them. “What? Oh, yeah, of course.”
“I know you to be quite the man of steel, Doctor,” said Tim, “but these injuries are rough even for me. I already started healing, no need for that. I know the goblin stench can get overwhelming and I already barely keep it contained from the muggles, you don’t want to smell it up close. But I appreciate the thought.”
“I have an idea,” John said, tugging Sherlock closer to the open windows. Crickets sang and sang, serenading in the vast ecosystem of a forest, covered by a blanket of darkness. “How about we watch Irene beat Janine at singing and then ditch the party? There’s too many people here to my liking. I like the Shack full of dense simpletons during the day, but this is a bit too much.”
It didn’t mean anything. And there was nothing wrong if he considered John Watson to be quite attractive. He wasn’t blind, he had twenty-twenty vision, so why not appreciate it?
. To talk about my aunt like that? Oh no. And where’s her interview with Fleur and Krum? Oh that’s neat - she just mentioned them at the end of the article! How is this honest journalism?”
, that’s nitpicking. It makes me feel short.”
into battle
“We should go down,” Sherlock said, surveying their surroundings to look for means of descent. Off to the side formed from big rocks was something akin to stairs they could use to walk down.
and John pinched the bridge of his nose.

Then why couldn’t he face Mary and say a simple no? It frustrated him to no end as he racked his mind up about it. He didn’t recall being this antsy over Mary, ever. Even during or after their breakup. But why bother? Maybe this was a problem that had to do with his upbringing; there weren’t many times when he was allowed to say no and stand up for himself when it regarded interpersonal relationships. Perhaps it grew into a habit in a couple areas of his life. However, he was over Mary, and apart from this small inconvenience, she had no power over him. Never had. He won’t let this fiasco weigh him down.
If only she knew.
Sherlock looked at him, then at the window, frowning passingly as he opened and closed his mouth undecidedly. “Uhm… For dancing?”
“Needs must,” he gave a shrug. She noticed that the hair at his temples greyed further. He should really just bleach it and dye it to silver-grey. “And they’ll have fun. They’re creative enough.”
“No.”
“Oh, the heads?” Greg looked up over his shoulder. “That was a parting gift from Louisiana from two decades ago. That’s Mork,” he pointed at a shriveled head in the middle of two others. “She’s a feisty one, lemme tell you. The rest is mute.”
“Jeez, okay? What if he needs to get something? Like his pyjamas?” John asked, flabbergasted.
“I’ll be alright, girl,” he whispered to her, letting her lick his chin. “You needn’t worry. C’mon, up you go. Time for bed.”
Sherlock hopped over the railing that fenced the porch and ran up to him. “John, I need to borrow the golf cart to save my dating-crazed step-sister from her blood sucking vampire romantic interest!”
“Night, Mrs Hudson!” they bid her farewell, silence falling upon them like a thick blanket. Static was the only sound coursing through Irene’s mind and body, the sort of emptiness that made you feel light-headed and grounded at the same time.
Kate squinted at him, lips pouting, as though he admitted to sleeping in a furry costume. Then her face smoothed out and something similar to a smirk replaced the disgusted expression. “Do you want to sleep with me?”
“Alright, let’s go.”
"That’s for our landlady," John said, yawning. "The door’s that way." Mundungus took the hint and shuffled outside, their eyes following him.
episode 11, chapter 5
Greg opened and closed his mouth. He hummed, tapping at his temple. “I just know. I see the way he looks at you when he thinks no one else can see him. Do you plan on asking him out?”
The man ended the call without a goodbye. Mary couldn’t care less. She placed the phone in its safe place and reached for her personal one. Indeed petty, she was. And even though the journal was a pressing matter of its own, she could deal with her
A digital clock on a mantel near the window in the living room blinked in periodical hypnosis as the day neared midnight. A magical hour as thought by many. It wasn’t the case all the time, but it fit, though it wasn’t magical by default but rather from necessity of pagans and other practises.
“What does my step-brother have do with this?”
Little did he know…
True, he never witnessed them move on their own, though he had an idea of what was happening. But he refused to buy into the curses the tourists wrote about. Sure, the shaman dude in Los Angeles was dodgy, but not enough to ensure Nic Cage went around passing the curse on. Nor did the Disney Princesses he got from that crazy collector lady (stealing was a more suitable word, for the lack of better expression).
The kitchen was empty, so John carefully made his way to the storage room. He overheard Gabe muttering to himself; he must be ordering ingredients. John’s legs led him to the back of the building, making sure that he didn’t bump into any racks that were ready to be brought upfront for the upcoming lunch break.
Unbelievable was one word to describe how Sherlock felt. Sharing a kiss in the rain was probably the single most romantic thing he’d ever experienced, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Well, he and John could have done without the near-constant cockblocking yesterday, but in the end, it didn’t matter. Three weeks ago, he wouldn’t believe even himself if he were told he got to kiss John. And now? Let’s say he planned to make up for the time in between.
“Interesting plan,” John said, re-reading the leaflet. “Commissions are open until the end of summer.” He put his arm on the backseat of Sherlock’s chair and Sherlock ignored the tingling in his belly. There were lame illustrations of monsters on the piece of paper to support the idea of what the photos could contain, but they didn’t top what the three of them endured.
“Fine.”
in which Sherlock deduces
“Yeah!”
“You’re helping in the museum?” Sam asked, plating another pancake.
“Why would you need a whole ship for just two people? What does a cannon have to do with reading about two people in love?” Cas frowned, though Dean started catching on.
“Do you realise how suggestive that sounds?” Sherlock chuckled, amused as John ducked his head in embarrassment.
Lestrade smiled, the two walking out into the summer afternoon air. After three days of raining, the heat picked up its pace almost immediately, though thankfully the oppressive warmth wasn’t back yet. Sherlock could use a cold shower.
Sherlock could feel the whites of his eyes flash at her while his irises rolled to see the inside of his skull for proof that intelligent life existed. “That’s not what I meant. I don’t think your date is what she seems to be.” He pointed a thumb in the mystery journal’s direction, which got her interest.
Justinkopnik regarded his mother with an arched eyebrow, calm. “Ah, there you are. I wondered where the breeze came from on such scorching day.”
“He had to cheat his way in,” said Pansy, her brows knitted in a furious brow.
“Exactly. Tut-tut, I’ll be downstairs in the kitchen!”
Hi people! New episode is here, and with it a new mystery on its on way!
Summer was over, but as much as he loved the free time, John found himself anticipating the new school year more than ever. He was eager to immerse himself in new knowledge and learn new spells and - see Sherlock again.
From an objective point of view, Agra -- Mary -- was stunning, her blonde hair done in a tight bun, no stray hair disarraying the picture perfect image of her flawlessness. And oh, how some guys around John
"Good evening, First Years," he began, his silvery beard reaching his knees. John could see from his table it was groomed nicely. "Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I hope you all have a good stay and that you retain and cultivate the education you are provided, at least until the end of the school year, that is."
“It’s not cluttered, or messy, it’s an organised chaos,” Sherlock said defensively. These people, honestly! He was a man of science, and science was an organised chaos, just like his mind. He found comfort in his room, it was a sanctuary when everything became unbearable. Same went for his dormitory room.
A puff. “Couldn’t. Stayed on the porch with Grace watching stars. I also trolled idiots on forums about beauty gurus all night. I turned Nikita Dragun and Jeffree Star fans against each other.”
“Hmmmm,” Sherlock purred with desperate undertones. The librarian was far enough not to scold him for the volume of his vocal chords. Sherlock watched John closely; his will not to look at the Ravenclaw boy almost broke, but he diligently kept his eyes glued to the page he was stuck on. “Hmmmmmm.”
“In the kitchen,” Sherlock said, flipping on his back. That was more comfortable; no curls fell in his eyes. “Don’t eat it, you’ll get cavities.”
Harry quirked up an eyebrow at Blake. “So.”
John gave a shrug. “Your curls remind me of that bumblebee, kind of. And it was cute. Too sappy?”
Irene and Sherlock obliged under the driver’s scrutinous look. They gathered their luggage and backpacks and stepped into the warm, Oregon air. Sherlock hated to admit it, but the air
“I wish you could roll me up the stairs, I’m stuffed,” John groaned, panting slightly as they ascended the enchanted stairs.
“This dude is fancy,” she concluded, pouting appreciatively at it.
“Right.”
“Of all the things I’ve imagined we might experience this summer,” John said, “becoming younger wasn’t one of them.”
Two days later it was high noon and the Shack was alive as ever. The previous day had passed without a hitch, the Mystery Museum and gift shop lurked new customers forth and nothing extraordinary had happened. Greg called in the afternoon to check in, and when no house fire was reported, he signed off and wished the kids a good night.
John took the heat wave better, although even he started fanning himself regularly with whatever flat-enough thing he had at hand, namely newspapers. He and Sherlock spent days lounging around Baker Street, too lazy to leave the flat into the warmer streets.
- be like. And it stung. The more he denied it, the more he ached for… a relationship? with John Watson. Plus, the fact that John literally lured a possessed demonic doll embodying Nicolas Cage to save Sherlock and Irene? Yeah, that didn’t help his infatuation. Memories of that night resurfaced, and his stomach fluttered as he recalled the moment when it seemed like John wanted to kiss him. Stupid, that wasn’t possible. Or? God, why were emotions always so
“So, you don’t know?” John asked, teasing. “Somehow, I'm not surprised.”
“So, if I do something to occupy your body…I can shut up your mind, right?” John continued.
John smiled. He didn’t mind the arrogance in Sherlock’s tone; he knew it was just a defense. And a poor one, at that.
“Sherlock, if you don’t want…”
“Good?” John asked, his voice deep and rough. He pressed his forehead against Sherlock's, smiling. “Did your big brain slow down even a little?”
“Lestrade?” John suggested.
“Sherlock?” John lifted his head.
There was no answer from the detective.
“John, please…” he pleaded, with so much desperation in his voice that doctor froze for a moment. The great Sherlock Holmes was pleading, not exactly an everyday occurrence. John looked up and drew a shaky breath, as he took his partner’s neediness. This beautiful man was doing wonders to his libido and it was already a miracle that he hadn’t come in his pants yet simply at the sight of this.
“I already solved everything worthwhile this morning,” the detective said, finally halting before John. “Oh, how I envy your simple mind, John. Mine is like engine, on its highest gear and without oil.”
John stopped and lifted his head up, looking into those dazed eyes. Christ, Sherlock expression was a sight to remember. John would wank to this memory for months.
That thought made him remember his own state and he glanced down, finding Sherlock in a similar situation. A tight bulge was plainly visible in Sherlock’s pyjama bottoms, complete with a wet spot of precome. In the position that John was sitting, their cocks were almost touching, but not quite. John couldn’t resist and palmed the tall man though the material. Sherlock moaned loudly and his hips twitched of their own accord.
“Sherlock, do you trust me?” John asked.
“Took you long enough to notice, you brilliant git,” John teased, and Sherlock pressed his head against the warm hand on his cheek. “So, should I continue?”
Still that insecurity in his voice, the kind that made John want to cuddle him and take care of all his needs. So unlike his usual overconfidence.
The detective squirmed and looked up, still embarrassed.
John just smirked at the sight, then stood up, feeling his joints crackle. He wasn’t so young any more. There was a white sticky substance quickly draining on both of them and John could really use a shower right now.
John twisted his hand and it was enough. Sherlock shouted and came. It was the last straw for John, who also finished. The only thing he could hear was his own loud heartbeat as he placed his head at Sherlock’s heaving chest.
“I don’t think I will be up for the next round so soon, but we can always find out,” he answered, smiling and Sherlock finally took his hand. “Let’s take a shower now…”
John shrugged. “Maybe there’s something on the blog?”
“You OK?” John asked his partner, still feeling boneless and a little like his limbs had turned to jelly.
“John, what are you…?” Sherlock tried to ask.
Sherlock didn’t deny it. He actually didn’t say a thing, instead stopping in his tracks and frowning at John.
The detective finally complied.
When long fingers wrapped around his cock, the doctor drew back, quickly catching Sherlock by wrist. Even slight stimulation now could make him come and he didn’t want that, not right now. He had a better plan.
“I…” Sherlock bit his lip and drew back, avoiding John's eyes. “If you're doing this just because I'm pissing you off…”
“You are like a precious gem, Sherlock,” John whispered, reaching up to kiss Sherlock’s deliciously full lips. This kiss was even better than the previous one. Sherlock was always a quick learner, but this was the first time that John really appreciated that.
“Of course.”
“John?”
“John…I…” Sherlock panted.
Sherlock’s hands had snuck under John’s jumper, a warm anchor at the small of his back, but he didn’t try to move them. Little needy noises were escaping Sherlock's mouth and traveling straight to John's groin. He finally drew back, nibbling gently at detective's lower lip. By then he was almost painfully hard, his trousers far too constraining. He resisted the urge to adjust himself and instead kissed his way down the pale column of Sherlock’s neck. Possessively, he sucked a bruise high enough that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to cover it, even wearing his usual scarf.
“Jo…hn…I…” Sherlock moaned, clearly close.
“Hmph…” Sherlock snorted again and whirled to resume his pacing, his nightgown flaring dramatically as he moved. “It’s unbearable!”
“No, it’s not,” John answered, frowning. “It’s dependent on your transport, as you put it. That’s why you’ve taken drugs.”
“You don’t know?” John said, visibly amused and not bothering to hide it.
Sherlock’s voice was small and breathy, and it was the last straw for John. He leaned down and pressed his lips to Sherlock's. The man beneath him froze, surprised, then began to clumsily move his lips, matching John movements. John smiled slightly, not stopping their kiss and reached down with his left hand to thread his fingers through the soft curls. Sherlock moaned, parting his lips slightly, and John took advantage, slowly licking inside this gorgeous mouth. The first touch of their tongues took them both by surprise. Sherlock shivered and a little whine escaped his mouth as John drew back, breathless and giddy.
Sherlock looked a little lost but he obeyed nonetheless. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s, guiding it gently around both of their cocks. The sensation of their cocks colliding, rubbing against each other was too much for them both and they moaned in unison. John took another deep breath to compose himself and began a slow pace, leading them both. He quickly increased the rhythm, as it was obvious that neither of them would last long.
He could stare at Sherlock like that forever, but they were both in a state that needed to be taken care of and he had a good idea how to do that. He lifted himself up from Sherlock’s knees and the detective unconsciously made a little whine at the loss. He was reminding John of a puppy, with his big dazed eyes and all the sounds he was making. The doctor just shook his head and started to unbuckle his belt and unzip his own pants.
“Great, I know this little place, the owner loves me.” Sherlock stated before turning to walk out the door. “You’ll like it.”
It took every shred of will power John had not to immediately run across the floor and rip him away from Sherlock with his bare hands.  His inner alpha was screaming in rage as he took in the sight of the omega, cataloguing the obvious injuries and the almost professional grip of the man holding him.
“If they didn't want to bond they could always just use their rights to refuse the match.” Mike pointed out.
The omega turned on his heel and stormed out of the flat, leaving his brother frowning behind him.
“Well maybe, some might think of it like that. But it’s terribly romantic to imagine having your safety and happiness being someone else’s highest priority” Molly defended herself.
For once Sherlock didn’t even have to think. “Do it.”
Most of all, thank you to everyone who stuck out the wait, to everyone who reviewed and encouraged me while I got my life together long enough to put this together for you. I love you all!!
Something sparked in the alpha’s eyes at his words. With a bitter scoff he shifted the pull in Sherlock’s body, tilting him backwards as if to let him fall. “Well, if I’m going down, I might as well take him with me.”
Sherlock’s answering smile was sharp. “Then what are you waiting for? The game is on John.” And with a whirl of his coat, Sherlock was gone.
“And yet, you have already been solving murders together. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?” John wanted to punch the other alpha in the face.  That really hit a little too close to home.
Blinking slightly John took in the room. The kitchen was enormous, the commercial grade appliances and counters were gleaming stainless steel. He could have cooked for an entire army in the huge room.  Sherlock padded across the floor as if it was a completely normal kitchen, and John supposed that for him it must have been.
"I'm sure the DI has everything he needs." John's voice was firm as he reached out to grab Sherlock's sleeve as if he were going to physically pull him away. "Come on. There is a car waiting."
Only the rapid tapping of the phone broke the silence as John considered his options. He could get into the car with the beta woman, who was obviously a member of Mycroft's staff.  He could try to find Sherlock on his own. John didn't even know where to begin to look; Sherlock could be anywhere in London. It really wasn't a decision at all, was it? After a few tense moments, he cut his eyes angrily at the car before turning to climb inside.
Nearly sobbing with need, Sherlock turned to present to John. The alpha’s hand was steady at his hip, keeping Sherlock grounded as sensations wracked his body. John took the time to stretch him carefully even as slick practically dripped between his thighs. John’s talented hands ran across him, playing his body like an instrument as Sherlock begged, almost out of his mind in desperation.
"I don't recall asking for your help at all." Greg shot back instantly. "You just showed up." If Greg ever figured out how Sherlock managed that trick, he would ride on the victory for weeks, maybe even months.
“Yes.” John agreed instantly. “I’ll need my gun.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened slowly as he realized what John was really asking. “Well, we are working with a deadline after all,” he offered with a smile.
"It felt like you were saying that any alpha off of the street would be better. Did I really do anything to deserve that?" John asked, eyes pleading with the man to just understand where he was coming from.
!!Also!!
“Christ.” John’s voice was rough as he finally broke away, leaving the omega panting beneath him. “We need to stop ending up like this.”
Anthea took the board back, tucking it neatly under her arm again as her phone pinged a notification at her. "I will file this immediately." She turned to walk away.
There was a body, or most of a body, behind a rather impressive desk at the back of the room. The woman was tied to the desk chair by a nylon rope and missing several fingers of her right hand. The missing fingers hadn’t gone far however, they were lined up in the desk with a neatness that made John slightly sick to his stomach. The stench of old blood and decay hung heavy in the air.
“Are you attracted to alphas?”
*****
John thought of the little beige room and the gun hidden safely in his desk. “Not too much really.” He admitted. “I guess you can say that civilian life doesn’t seem to suit me so far. With my injuries I can’t really go back to work as a surgeon. Nerve damage, my hands just aren’t steady enough now.”
“And if I run?” John asked, though he suspected that he knew the answer.
Right now he was glaring at the sample under his microscope as if it had personally offended him.
There you are lovelies, Chapter 4! I hope you liked it! Love it or hate it I would ADORE you forever if you would just shoot me a quick review to let me know what you think!
As he moved to go around the desk a rather nasal voice suddenly spoke up “This is a crime scene, I don’t want it contaminated. Are we clear?” A ferrety looking man glowered at Sherlock from the far wall, where he had been standing unnoticed. John shook his head in amazement. What was it with these people? Was Lestrade the only one on the whole scene that wanted Sherlock here?
The omega’s sudden change of body language when the door slammed open startled John. Instantly every trace of supplication was erased and his attention shifted, razor sharp, to the stranger.
*****
"Of course you can." Sherlock looked up at John's the bemused expression on John's face. "You've been doing it for years, Sherlock. I know you are capable of taking care of yourself."
John laughed dryly. “This is utterly surreal. Are you really suggesting that we bond forever because I’m lonely and you’re desperate?”
The words did reassure Sherlock. He looked at the Alpha, studying the stiff way John held himself and the way his eyes looked at Sherlock; the man looked at him as if he thought Sherlock would vanish in a puff of smoke at any moment. John was nervous too, Sherlock realized suddenly as he took in all of the little signs that he could read so clearly. Somehow this soothed the last of his uncertainty; obviously his feelings on the subject were completely normal.
John growled.
“Even if it means that you stay alone?” Sherlock asked flatly.
Molly’s mouth fell open. “You?” she asked incredulously.
Eventually, John realized that Sherlock would never break the stiff tension between them. Casting about for a safe topic of conversation, he realized that the buildings surrounding them were largely unfamiliar. “Where are we going?” He didn’t miss how Sherlock startled slightly, as if he had forgotten there was anyone else in the car at all.
“I’m an omega not a brood mare. I do not need to be bound ‘for my own protection’ since I can obviously do just fine protecting myself. There is no reason for me to sacrifice my Work to spend the rest of my life under the thumb of some random alpha, chosen by a committee that will most certainly take out its frustration on my brother by giving me the very worst options to ‘choose’ from. It’s barbaric, and I won’t be a part of it.”
As they approached the car, John noticed the beta woman was waiting once again just outside the door. She still stared intently into her blackberry, but now she held a clipboard and pen as well. She carelessly held them out to John as soon as the man was close enough to reach it. "Sign this."
“Sorry,” John replied easily, more relaxed now that the threat was gone. “I didn’t like her attitude.”
“I play when I’m thinking, sometimes for hours. I often don’t talk for days on end. Would that bother you?”
With a furious growl, John began to pull on the rest of his clothing. The moment he finished pulling on his shoes he stormed down the hallway and straight out of the house.
“There is a security camera on the building opposite. Do you see it?” the voice on the other end of the phone was obviously aristocratically male, but other than that John didn’t recognize it at all.
They sat quietly for a few minutes, each taking careful measure of the other, and unwilling to break the silence.  Eventually, Sherlock licked his lips and continued. “So, Mycroft offered you money to bond with me?”
At Sherlock’s decidedly sceptical look John turned his entire body to the omega. John leaned forward
Sherlock's lips tightened slightly, but he didn't respond to the alpha's words.
“Twenty-second September,” John beat his grunkle to it. Greg nodded, sighing exasperatedly. “Hey, I’m just joking old man. Grey hair actually suits you. You should dye it to silver-white. Besides, I remember the date and I’ll smother you with gifts this year.”
“If you think so,” Mycroft mused, stepping into the room. Redbeard walked up to him to get his chin scratched, to which Mycroft obliged.
perfect. It would make you look brighter and happier.
These words, combined with the action of pulling Sherlock into the standalone dimension of his mirror self, were enough to spike his panic level to Olympian heights. He fell on his knees, immediately staggering up, but when he got up to spring out into the bathroom, he slammed into an invisible barrier.
“For the last time, women!” Sherlock seethed, tugging at his hair desperately, attempting to shush them should John backtrack and overhear this ridiculous conversation. “Nothing happened! And Kate, just because we met doesn’t mean we’re suddenly in a relationship.”
Sherlock and Irene dismissed him. “It’s no trouble,” Sherlock said, swatting Irene’s fingers from his scalp. She smacked him. He twisted in his chair and soon they were engaged in a full cat fight, hands slapping at speed faster than light. It took a very determined John Watson to break them apart, pacifying especially Sherlock who wasn’t so keen on letting go of their match, so John wrestled him back in the chair, pinning him to place by sitting on his knees, having Sherlock’s arms crossed over his chest and pressed to it, tight.
A shove from the side got Sherlock off balance and he tripped, the scissors flying across the room and behind a bunch of heavy crates with Mystery Shack merch. Cage tripped him. But it was good to see he was unsteady too. The thing that was threatening, though…
“Or early. Don’t think I don’t know how horrible your sleep schedule is, Greg. It always was.”
"We fend off Dementors and Disapparate as fast as possible," said John as if it was a previously made plan.
“Alright -- here’s the battle plan,” John said, determination sparkling in his dark eyes. “We go through every available historical book in the library. If we find anything coherent that doesn’t have children’s scribbles written across the pages, we could find evidence that Balexander O’Leary wasn’t the town’s founder. That will put Janine in her place.”
“You’re no fun,” Sherlock pouted, slumping in his seat until he put up his feet on John’s.
“Coffee,” Sherlock said, shyly raising his hand but stopping mid-air. He averted his gaze and drummed his fingers on the table. “Black--”
“Such as?”
“I…. It’s nothing.”
"We're sorry for breaking the school rules," John said, eyes on his shoes. He was genuinely sorry - and he felt bad for waking his Professors up.
“Yes. Cas approved of them, so I bought them.”
“Why not?”
“What? I’m not going to embarrass myself without knowing it one-hundred percent!”
Martha cooed over him with the same affection she held for those she adored, and Dean could see that his brother also enjoyed her affections. She was their only living relative, currently. That is, as far as they were aware. But even Martha was at loss whether anyone else was alive. Welp. This was as good as it got. Dean was happy that they got someone like her and not some asshole who secretly wanted to rip their throats out.
“So?”
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” John said, aggressively rubbing his arms to regain some heat in the freezing cold. Sherlock navigated them outside the castle, narrowly missing Peeves and Filch on their way out, ignoring his complaints.
“Yes. To me, anyway.”
“Why wouldn’t I be?” he snapped at John, regretting his tone, somewhat.
Sherlock hummed and walked over to his step-sister, long fingers carefully dividing her thick mane into three even parts. Irene could do it herself, but she preferred when somebody else could overlook the process. Sherlock practised braiding her hair since they were children, and he became quite good at it. He flipped one thick strand over another, rhythmically tying the hair in place so that it wasn’t too tight, but neither too loose. He tapped Irene’s shoulder once he got to the end, palm turned upwards as she placed a rubber band in it.
“Thanks,” John said, putting the shovel between him and Sherlock. He didn’t seem too fazed by this.
The boys walked in silence, bumping into fellow students along the way, some of them sped up when they saw Sherlock, and others whispered. John stared at them as hard as he could, telepathically telling them off, but he obviously wasn't a psychic.
“Don’t be ridiculous, he doesn’t feel scared,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, looking to John for some kind of support.
As if on cue, said grunkle tumbled out of the police station, rubbing his wrists. Once he saw the kids, namely John who watched him with a sardonic eyebrow arched high, he looked away. “Uh… Pizza from Angelo’s fine for dinner?”
Silence. Nobody moved for a few seconds except for John’s pen where it wrote Cas’ testimony in Sherlock’s journal.
“Done,” she smirked, leaning back in her chair. “Take Sherlock and Irene too, if they want. I’ll be there that day, so I’ll take the opportunity and apologise to Sherlock.”
special thanks to bee, dee, and I guess crépes or however you spell that french abomination of a word
"Yeah? And what are you going to do, stab the wind?" John said impatiently. He had enough of this damp madness for one night. His gut feeling said they should get out, now, and he was willing to take the chance. "Listen, we can get here some other time when we actually know how to cast proper spells, don't you think?"
John managed to lure them to the front yard.
. As far as I know, he refused every dating offer. I thought he may be aromantic or something similar, which is fine, of course, but he said he’s not. Just that it’s complicated.”
“Finally pulled a leg over, eh?”
"John, I've said it before, and I don't want to repeat myself, although I have to due to your apparent memory loss - I tell the truth. Besides, I don't see why he should feel bad for being in Gryffindor, clearly he's been infatuated by his family's opinion of what is right and what is not."

“Fucking amazing,” he muttered, not having the energy to look for the remote. He really hoped the git who lost it stepped on Lego. Or a Lego castle. While running on a treadmill. Greg liked the show in its early stages, but he dropped out soon enough not to become obsessed, but his happy days were over. He remembered the initial plot and characters too well for his liking. Especially the King’s conservative mother grinded his gears. If there was a character Greg wanted to die or go off the show, it was her.
“Well,” John said as Mrs Hudson pulled over to a parking lot. “You better send me a link to the whole soundtrack, I want to listen to all of it.” He bumped their shoulders, the left side of his lips tilting up, blond lashes fluttering, as did Sherlock’s stomach. Here was the closeness again, the comfort, the peace that quietened every doubt and insecurity that arose in Sherlock’s mind.
“One hell of an unlucky year then, huh?”
Silence. Mike looked up at her, sadness evident on his face. “Yeah. But it doesn’t matter. We’re best friends, that’s enough.” He rose to his feet before Irene could offer any advice. “Thanks for hearing me out. I just… that damned West! Nevermind that now. If Molly’s happy, I’ll be too.”
“Bloody hell,” Irene cursed, falling to her knees. She hated running. Especially in July. Fuck running in July and August. Fuck running in summer in general. “Mike’s a good shot, but the ball bounced off a crate and back at Molly. Then this fuckboy West comes by like a knight in shining armour on a white horse and has an
"I'd have more, but we had to go," he longed, turning around to stare at the clean tables.
“Of you two lunatics? Nah. I’ll take you tossers on like nothing. I’m fucking scared of McGonagall coming for our arses. Or some Prefects. Or, oh God, Snape or even worse - Dumbledore.”
“I will,” she winked at them from the doorway. Then she fixed Greg a stern glare. “And don’t you dare smoke another cigarette today, Greg! The stench in the house is horrible during such scorching days, honestly.”
. Not yet, anyway.”
Fablehaven by Brandon Mull is what kickstarted my desire to write all these years ago *dies in old*
Donna hummed and walked around the console while telling Sherlock to hold a lever in position, which he fulfilled, the Doctor growing more and more agitated. Irene jumped in to push a button every five seconds as instructed by Donna, who talked as if she was discussing weather in London on a fine autumn day.
“Your wish is my command, John,” she said.
Soon, hums of approval and content sighs filled the kitchen.
“Sure, wanna see the love bite she gave me?” Irene said enthusiastically at Sherlock’s horrified expression when she tilted her head for him to see the red mark on her skin where blood was drawn to the surface to form a bruise. “Just kidding, that was an accident with that portable vacuum cleaner Mrs Hudson uses for the golf cart. That was fun.”
in which there is an invitation
“You know what I mean. How is the Game?”
On the TV, Sam had jumped in front of the camera.
The back room had sliding doors instead of classical ones. He double checked to make sure he wasn’t venturing into the showers or toilets -- no need to embarrass himself right now and get flashed by naked bodies of strangers. What if John and Irene spotted him?
“You’re too nice John.”
“And I overheard them when I sat at their table in the park to eat,” Donna added. “I just… we started talking, and when Irene said that she wished for time to be rewound, I thought…”
“Which he isn’t.”
“Irene,” she said, fidgeting next to her. She cast Irene a wavering glance, shoulders hunching over shyly. “I would like to tell you something.”
The gas station’s light bulbs were orange, moths and mosquitos lazily circling around the warm source of light in a worshipful manner. Their wings buzzed and halted, the dull sound of them crashing into the heated glass disturbing the peace outside of the small squarish building on their side of the lane. Everything was serenely calm.
Why the gift shop, of all places? The rudimentary room was below his area of interest when he wasn’t tortured by Lestrade having to spend his precious time there. And what about gravity? The colours? Oh! Maybe it was his subconscious telling him to focus on the Colour Wheel? He’ll make that his priority once he returns to the Shack.
John didn’t reunite with Mary. Did that mean Sherlock’s worries were over? No. But it eliminated one that made him nauseous above others, one that he didn’t consider prior. He scolded himself for how hopeful it made him feel, but sentiment seemed to be making him these days. The worst thing was that he truly didn’t mind it. John made him experience a roller-coaster of feelings and unimportant, ridiculous fantasies. But… that didn’t mean he would be interested in Sherlock, still. Much as Irene claimed it, he couldn’t bring himself to believe it fully. He did catch glimpses of John looking at him like there was no one else in the room, but why? There’s nothing that special about Sherlock to deserve such attention. And true, in the last few days, John appeared to be getting closer to him, physically and otherwise. As if their atoms’ nuclei automatically attracted the other’s like magnets. And… if he had to be honest, he would say that on the night of the burning of Nicolas Cage, they both looked at the other’s lips. But they didn’t kiss. But… it was probably close. He didn’t know.
"First of all, your wand movement is off," Sherlock said, his wand in his left hand. He drew an imaginary clockwise spiral in the air. "Second, your pronunciation is terrible and your accent takes its toll as well, no offense."
in which Kate and Cas become aqcuainted
As soon as Irene was satisfied, she nodded to John to take hold of good ol’ OG to the museum. He did it with as much gentleness as he could muster. Wow, did he take it seriously. Well, who was she to criticise the manhandling of the dead?
“She’s inviting me to her show today,” John said, face scrunched up into an adorable frown. “Says my name is on the whitelist and to bring as many people as I want. Apparently she wants to catch up on our lives or whatever.” He put the letter down and hid his face in his hands. “I mean, I get it. We haven’t seen each other in two years since we broke up. It wasn’t the worst break up, but I don’t want to elaborate on that. Anyway… Ah, to hell with it. Seeing her this once won’t hurt. I won’t be petty over something that happened long ago.”
“You can either stay sulking here by yourself, or you can interrogate Cas and stare at me making dinner at the same time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked at Sherlock, whose face was stuck between wonder and frown, but he quickly smoothed his features into a blank expression, observing.
“I bought it at a second-hand store, quit bitching. Change, I won’t peek.”
“We can brainstorm while at it,” Sherlock said and tried to get up to stop himself from fidgeting, but John held him down by placing a hand on his shoulder. He withdrew it immediately -- not hastily, but the contact was short lived, unfortunately -- and stuttered a little.
“Naturally. Presumably due to muggles visiting.” Sherlock hummed noncommittally. Mycroft wasn’t too familiar with the Watson household, maybe he should change that. It didn’t seem that John planned to orbit out of Sherlock’ periphery any time soon. Once he starts working, it will get easier to gain information.
“Are you sure you’d be able to make something as large?” Lestrade asked skeptically.
“Only you, because you’re insufferable.”
“Hm…. No,” Greg said at last, done reading the information on Kate’s leaflet.
with it. Unbelievable. Cedric, abhorrently enough, seemed excited by the prospect. A little. Of course, he was concerned, and the two of them tried to come up with spells that could work well enough against the creatures
John opened the door to the car and bent to look in at the man sitting inside. “Hello.”
Without thinking about it, Greg reached out to grab Sherlock by the arm, eyes widening as he got a full dose of pheromones in the process. Greg licked his suddenly dry lips. "Look here-"
“What about your army mates? Surely there must be a few around to form up with, at least for a little while. You know it’s not good for an alpha to go without a pack for too long. It starts to mess with your heads.”
Sherlock’s eyes took in every detail of Robert’s appearance, from the wrinkles at the cuff of his otherwise immaculate suit, to the flexing muscles in his jaw, to the redness surrounding the gold band around his finger. Shit. “Your mate.”
Sherlock leaned forward, pulling John’s lips back to his in deep kiss as the Alpha’s hands played along the waistband of his trousers. The cool air nipped gently at his chest in perfect contrast to the warmth of John’s skin.  Sherlock realized that he hadn’t even noticed the alpha taking off his own shirt. Sherlock pulled back suddenly, needing a moment to breathe as he took in the sensations washing over him. John seemed to understand, leaning back calmly as he let the omega’s eyes trail over him.
Sherlock whimpered and squirmed underneath him, his fingers digging into John’s skin hard enough to leave a bruise. John found that he didn’t care, not with this beautiful man before him, showing him the most erotic sight he ever seen.
“What are you talking about, John?” Sherlock finally asked, sitting in his armchair across the doctor.
"Ah, Anthea." Sherlock drawled. "Still wasting yourself on running petty errands for my lazy brother, I see."
“Sherlock has been abducted. We will return you to your…home.”  Mycroft looked like that was the very last thing that he wanted to do.
Mycroft brushed away the barb with obvious ease as he turned to John. “I look forward to speaking with you again soon, Doctor Watson.” Mycroft gave the other man a small, mocking bow before turning to exit the room.
*****
“Perhaps.” Sherlock allowed with a slight nod. “We are nearly there in any case.” His mind, usually spinning so quickly in so many different directions seemed suddenly focused on exactly how much time it was going to take to get to the safe house.
“Mmm.” Mycroft hummed, bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet as he leaned against his umbrella. “I would rather like to think that I’m a bit more than ‘just’ his older brother Doctor Watson. At the moment, I’m his legal guardian and alpha as well.”
*****
The pressure increased, Sherlock could feel himself stretching in a way that he never had before. Sensations battled behind his eyelids; conflicting feelings were flashing like sparks. It pinched slightly even as the feeling of satisfaction rose to overpower everything else. This was exactly what his body said he needed. John gave him a moment to adjust to the feeling before nearly pulling out entirely and moving forward with a smooth thrust. Something inside of Sherlock burst into white hot awareness and Sherlock let out a surprised cry.
“That doesn’t mean anything.” John’s voice felt rough in his throat as he spoke. “There could be any number of internal injuries.” Even the idea made the red pulsing behind his eyes speed up a little.
“Freak’s here. Bringing him in,” she looked again at John. “Apparently he brought a friend.”
"Right." Sherlock snorted in disbelief. "Then what was the point of chasing me halfway across London this morning?"
Turning back to Sherlock, John gave a small smile and sat quietly on the side of his own bed. “Yeah.”
In Which John and Sherlock Discuss Things, Snog in Mycroft's Car, Eat a Sandwich, and also Establish their Bond
John snorted, “Right. That rather does explain a lot.”
The man was beautiful, there was no denying it. Almost beautiful enough to distract from the fact that-“Why are you beating a corpse?”
John snorted, absently rubbing his fingers across Sherlock’s wrist. Sherlock was momentarily distracted, wondering if the alpha realized he was doing it. “A posh git in a big car picked me up and offered me 28 thousand pounds to bond with you.”
“I cleared it a bit.” Sherlock responded, but without bite. Turning to John he added, “Three years ago I successfully proved to Lestrade that at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, Angelo was in a completely different part of town house-breaking.”
“Oh God, no,” John realized that his hands were shaking, and his leg was in agony. Slowly, he sank to his knees and fought the urge to vomit as every cell in his body screamed at him to go now and find the omega.
“Do what, exactly?” Sherlock drew up stiffly to glare at John, hands dropping to grip at his knees with white knuckled force. “Make my own informed decisions? I’m not a child.” Sherlock’s voice was almost poisonous in its intensity.
Generally, the first matches were pretty good. The second ones were typically a fair shot as well.  But by the time an omega hit their third match, the right of refusal is all used up and they are stuck with whoever is chosen next. Sure, the alpha could object and demand a rematch, but it was rare.  There was generally a reason that third matches were third matches.
“I shouldn’t have to be registered at all!” Sherlock shouted, indignant.
Sherlock chose not to mention the fact that he hadn't, in fact, been joking at all. "I was thinking that there was a murder, dull as it turned out to be in the end." Sherlock lied easily as he turned to look through the window. "There was nothing for me to do John. I was going out of my mind."
“Do you see the camera Doctor Watson?” the voice repeated, impatiently.
Turning slightly, he studied John through the corner of his eye. John sat stiffly, staring straight ahead and rubbing absently at a threadbare place on the cuff of his shirt. He was nervous then. More than likely wondering what he was doing in a cab with an omega he had met, Sherlock glanced at his watch, 23 minutes ago. That wasn’t helpful at all.
“Brilliant.” John muttered to himself before looking up. “But what does that have to do with bonding with you? I don’t even know your name. You don’t know me either. That is a little forward when we haven’t even been introduced.”
John leaned forward to grab Sherlock’s face between his hands. “Stop it.” He nearly begged; voice a guttural whisper, shocking Sherlock into stillness with the intensity of emotion behind his eyes. “Please. I know that you’re going to be fine. I’m grateful that by some grace of God you weren’t more seriously hurt; but every time I close my eyes I see you lying bloody on the ground. Please stop and lay back in the damn bed.”
“An undue hardship?”  John felt something in his chest twinge slightly. “Is that how you feel then?”
"That's not what this is about Sherlock." John sighed, reaching up to rub a frustrated hand through the back of his hair as he considered his words. "I don't want to control you."
“Jamie, help Mr. Holmes into his seat.” The woman said as she tossed her short blonde curls over her shoulder with a huff. “Robert will be here soon, and I want everything ready.”
“Any good?”
Licking her lips Molly hesitantly offered, “If you wanted to talk about it…?”
It was silent for a moment. John got the distinct impression that the man was laughing at him. He did not appreciate it. “I assure you Doctor that if I wanted you to disappear they would not find the body, in the Thames or otherwise.”
“A trait that has served me well in the past brother mine.” Mycroft pointed out mildly. “And you as well, if I recall.”
“John.”  Sherlock’s voice was rough and low; he ached everywhere. He was surrounded by the gentle beeping of the machines but didn’t seem to be connected to any of them. There was an IV pole sitting abandoned by the bed and a piece of surgical tape and cotton on the back of his hand where it had recently been attached.  He was in a hospital. They had gotten him out of the warehouse. “What are you doing here?”
“Didn't you have some kind of special dispensation? I thought for sure with your brother...” Molly let the sentence trail off.
His leg hurt. Oh, he knew that according to both his doctor and his therapist, there was nothing physically wrong with the leg. Unlike his shoulder, it hadn’t actually gotten injured in the firefight that got him shipped back home early. It certainly didn't feel that way though. Every step was agony.
Mike nodded with sympathy. “That’s rough Johnny boy,” he said, even though it sounded slightly odd from a man who was actually a year or 2 younger than himself. “Have you thought about setting out your shingle somewhere? Surgery isn’t everything, and I always thought you would make a good GP.”
an alpha unless they want one. There is no reason for the Project to exist anymore. It’s all political posturing to maintain the status quo.”
"I don't feel like joking right now Sherlock." John sighed as he followed the omega into the car. "I'm still angry with you. What were you thinking?"
John was content to let Sherlock sit quietly beside him with the warmth of their held hands to fill in what words couldn’t. In the companionable silence, so different from the heavy tension before, John occupied himself by studying the omega.
“That little trick won’t work on me, omega.” Sherlock felt a trailing hand tease across the back of his neck. “I know you’re awake.”
Reaching into his pocket, Greg grabbed his phone and hit Donovan's name. "Yeah, Sally? We need to call the girlfriend in for questioning."
“You wouldn’t.” John agreed fondly as he crawled off of the bed. Funny, Sherlock didn’t remember when John had gone from the floor to literally being on top of him.
“Even those dunces down at the NSY could tell you are unbonded, no bond marking on your neck and a distinct smell that says that you are still available. You are holding your phone, I can clearly see an inscription on the back to Harry from Clara, so that implies that there is a bond there; most likely it was a gift since your name is in fact John. It’s a newer model and expensive but the screen is quite badly cracked. Not badly enough to render it unusable but enough to make replacing it worthwhile. If you were expected to join your brother’s pack then he would have made an effort to buy something new.
John’s easy pace really hadn’t taken him far when a black car with tinted windows turned onto the street and began to slowly roll up behind him.
“I am largely unexperienced in the realm of physical intimacy. Historically I have very little desire to experience sexual relations.” Sherlock responded flatly, still refusing to look at John. After a few moments where John stared blankly at the omega, completely unable to think of what to say, Sherlock did continue thoughtfully. “Based on my earlier experiment in the hospital room, it shouldn’t prove to be an undue hardship.”
Sherlock brushed roughly at an imaginary bit of fluff on his sleeve as he pulled himself back together.
Mike took a sip of beer. “No, not really,” he hummed, “but I’m not even the worst one for nicking interesting bits and pieces from the morgue these days. There’s a pretty stiff competition there now.”
Finally he felt the pressure of John’s cock pressing against him. Sherlock gasped, instantly trying to rock back onto the alpha until John pinned him against the bed with a low growl. “Be still.” Sherlock froze instantly with a deep groan; at this point he could no more refuse his alpha than he could walk to the moon.
“Dr. John Watson, this is DI Lestrade.” Sherlock said, obviously already tired of the repeated introductions. “Lestrade, this is John.” Turning back to the room Sherlock absently rubbed his hands together. “Now, back to business; what do we know?”
Mortification hit Sherlock as he realized what had almost happened and he pulled sharply back against the mattress. “Sorry.” He murmured, looking away as he felt his face begin to burn violently. “I didn’t quite think that through.”
“Boring” Sherlock dismissed. “That sounds utterly revolting. I would say that I thought you were above that drivel but in the end, that would be a lie.”
John wasn't a thing like Sebastian.
John could feel the blood draining from his face before suddenly rising back up with the full force of his rage behind it. “Why.” John’s voice was calm and steady. He stared at the other alpha with a deceptively mild look on his face. If the man had known John at all during the time he was in Afghanistan, he would have had the driver pull over immediately to allow John out. As it was, he had no clue.
The trailing fingers continued their ministrations as the man gave another gravely laugh. “Still in top form I see. Good. That makes everything much more interesting, doesn’t it?” he asked, maintaining the almost lightly interested tone. You would think that they were discussing what to get for lunch, instead of why Sherlock had been drugged and kidnapped.
Stepping forward, John put himself between Sherlock and the woman. “You have a radio there.” He pointed out, gesturing to the other alpha’s hip. “Why don’t you call the inspector and find out for yourself.” The woman looked at him, narrowing her eyes as she took in the clear challenge on his face and sized him up. John was ready for her to try to start a fight, but after a few tense moments she grudgingly reached for the radio.
“The Omega Project.” John looked back at Sherlock with a sudden intensity that Sherlock was not expecting. “You assumed that I was on my way there for a mate.”
John climbed inside. As he settled onto the bench seat he felt the car pull smoothly out into traffic. Great, he thought with a slight scowl. He was going to be severely put out if he had to bail out of a moving vehicle with his shoulder in the condition that it was in.
John looked evenly at the man; taking in the little tells that he was able to read so clearly for some reason. Sherlock was nervous. “Look, I had a really good time. We did something great. But I don’t think you know what you’re suggesting. Bonding is about more than just convenience. There has to be a connection there, or it means nothing. There is no taking it back if you change your mind. I like you a lot Sherlock, but I want a mate and not just an easy partner in crime. If I bond with you, I could lose the chance.”
Sherlock had been called quite a number of things in his life, most of them unpleasant, but he had never once been called beautiful. Opening his mouth slightly, Sherlock wasn’t sure if he wanted to protest the unexpected compliment or not. John didn’t give him a chance. Slowly leaning forward he pushed his hand back to cradle Sherlock’s head as he leaned in to kiss the omega.
The omega only hummed in response. After a few moments he looked up at John. “I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work.”
“It’s not my fault that they can’t keep their messy little secrets to themselves.” Sherlock retorted before turning back to the woman before him thoughtfully. “John, come here.”
Sherlock needed to see what all of the fuss was about. He had never wanted to give up his hard earned control to an alpha; it was the primary reason that he found the idea of bonding distasteful in general. This was something else entirely. A tendril of heat wound through his stomach where before he had felt only the light jittering of his nerves.
“Locked room; quite bloody yes,” Lestrade jumped right to the point, knowing his audience. “She’s in pieces.”
"Then what do you want, John?" Sherlock hissed, "A pretty omega to rub your feet and carry your brood, always waiting at home with open legs and a smile when you get in from work?"
The disappointment that lanced through Sherlock’s chest was unexpectedly sharp. “You don’t think an omega capable of the job,” Sherlock finished with forced mildness.
While Sherlock is a Bit not Good for Reasons, and has some Things to Work Out with Himself.
“Why?” John’s even voice did not betray the fact that he could feel the heat slipping through his veins as the anger spread through him like hot lava.
“I-I don't know.” Molly stuttered in embarrassment. “I mean, they are known for being sweet and strong. An alpha will always protect you no matter what. They will keep you close because you are precious to them.”
A look of faint confusion passed over Sherlock’s face as he registered the odd tone of John’s voice. “Maybe that wasn’t the best phrasing.” Sherlock allowed. Sherlock reached a hand to awkwardly pat his leg. “I found it to be quite pleasurable.” John felt slightly better, but not by much.
Sherlock moaned as John moved away from his lips, slowly nibbling his way down his neck to the sensitive glands hidden at its base. As John kissed and nipped at the delicate skin there Sherlock found himself leaning forward, pushing into the pressure of John’s teeth with a needy whimper.
In which John and Sherlock actually speak to each other like normal human beings, and also solve a gruesome murder.
Sherlock’s fingers began drumming against his knee in a complicated pattern that John couldn’t quite follow as he looked critically at the alpha. “What precisely are you suggesting I do? Run? Would you really help me leave if I decided right now that I had changed my mind? That I didn’t want to bond with you? After everything that’s happened between us already, would you let me go?”
Angelo laughed fondly, patting Sherlock on the shoulder.  “If not for this man, I would have gone to prison.”
“Yeah,” John replied with a bitter laugh. “That’s not happening. What kind of idiot do you take me for?”
John looked at the clipboard as he pulled it into his hand. The paper attached was a Registration of Bonding, the information on the certificate already neatly filled out for the day before. The only things missing were the two signatures at the bottom of the page. "Don't we need to sign this in front of a solicitor or something?" John asked.

“The bonded alpha feels threatened by the blood ties that you share with her omega.” Sherlock mused, nodding. That made as much sense as the idea that John’s sister was still overprotective of her new wife.
“Who was this traitor?” Sherlock asked, genuinely curious. Gloria ignored him and hypnothically watched the ring in Sherlock’s palm. He tried a different approach. “Can I have a look at your ring?”
Mrs Hudson tsked and shook her head. Irene couldn’t imagine having unsupportive parents. This added to her admiration for John. Not only was he a good looking badass who could wreak havoc when equipped with a shovel, he kept a positive mental attitude in spite of his apparently shitty upbringing. That showed his real strength - his kindness and cheerfulness.
He gathered everything from his mental checklist when light footsteps ran past his room and into the attic. That was Irene. There were more feet coming upstairs, the chatter of Sam and Dean talking echoing throughout the corridor.
John squirmed out of habit. He never told anyone about this except for Greg, and even that was in passing. His internal fantasy worlds were precious to him. They couldn’t be harmed by any external forces or drunken stupors that led to objects being thrown or destroyed, they couldn’t be erased or thrown into trash, they were steady and constant and always there when John needed to withdraw. They were there when he fled his home for a couple hours until it wound down and calmed and he didn’t risk being shouted at till his ears rang.
“Nineteen? You sure? Could’ve passed as a twenty-something guy to me,” Lestrade huffed a laugh, scratching the back of his neck while shooting a glance at his shoes. “Ah, you kids all trick us with your looks these days. Nothing wrong with that, mind you.”
“Have these gotten your attention?” a hooded man with cloth over his mouth asked. John’s eyebrows rose up as his silent contemplation was interrupted. The salesman pointed at a dagger in whose crossguard were three gems: one dark blue in the middle and two lighter coloured crystals. “Lapis lazuli and aquamarine. A lot of people are attracted to it because it reminds them of the sea.”
The doorbell rang, and the doors closed with a snap. As he looked up, a warm smile spread across his face. Sherlock and Irene came in, both a little sweaty and flushed from the heat. Sherlock’s hands were dirty, almost black from the fertilizer soil Mrs Hudson made him put in her flowerbeds while Irene was supposed to water the plants. John usually helped the upkeeper, but Sherlock offered, claiming that he didn’t take samples of dirt from around the Shack yet, and this was a good opportunity as any. Irene was a bit more reluctant (lazier) to help, but they managed.
Sherlock bit his lower lip, not letting go of John’s wrist, gaze focused on
“If you told me at the beginning of July I’d be sharing a shower with you, I’d laugh,” Sherlock said, turning the water off.
“You’re ridiculous,” Sherlock chastised weakly. He dropped his hand from where he pressed it to John’s brow and made a show of rolling his eyes to another dimension. “I blame the weather. You need a cold shower, Watson. Otherwise you’re risking a heat stroke.”
. As if sensing Sherlock’s thoughts, Robert leaned close to his ear. “If you make a single noise, I will make sure you’re nothing but a bloody puddle with a body in the middle before he can even cross this room.” The alpha’s rank scent curled around Sherlock, and again he begun to feel like he was drowning in unpleasantness as Robert’s lips brushed along Sherlock’s neck.
John groaned at his friends’ awful pun. They settled into a companionable silence as they each nursed their drink, caught up in their own thoughts.  Eventually Mike looked up at John. “So what have you been up to since you got home?”
Stiff silence descended on the room until a shrill ringing broke through. Mycroft’s hand instantly went to his pocket and pulled out the mobile nestled there. After a glance at the screen he tucked it away. “I’m afraid that I must run. I wanted to take some time to check on you, but duty calls. There’s a bit of an uprising in Egypt; you understand of course.”
, yes.”
John jerked forward immediately. “What happened to Sherlock?”
"Sherlock." Anthea greeted neutrally. John was startled to realize that it had never even occurred to him to attempt to get the woman's name on the long drive over.
