“Do you want me to leave?” His voice is smaller than he’d intended. Sherlock begins to ramble, but John cuts him off.
“How was that?” he asked.
bedroom - should be private. I - it’s private.”
“You wouldn’t, but I’ll buy full-cream for you anyway. D’you need anything else from Tesco?”
Sherlock left the bathroom, closing his bedroom door quietly.
"If she'd messed her nappy, how did you know before I did?"
there we go. merry christmas, starrysummernights! my unending thanks, practicefortheheart!
Through the kitchen - which was, in fact, awful after just two days - he continued. “I should have told you before she shot you. I should’ve told you before I got married, really, or even before you left. Sherlock,” he said, louder now, opening his bedroom door, “you need to know that I -”
“I - I think - I’m about to unravel. Oh God. If you do… that, and touch my tail. I.”
“I.” Sherlock flutters his hands between them. “I couldn’t trust myself. My own desires may have been clouding my observations.”
“I want to put a lot more than just my tongue in you,” he said lightly, and Sherlock shuddered and muttered into the pillow.
“God, stop that, you’re scaring me. Just eat your peas.”
“You know that he’s loved you for years?”
“It is. Yeah. Come back up here? I just want to do this right, you know.”
“This would be a dangerous one for you. Trust me, I could much easier live in a world where you hate me than a world without you.” He clenches his jaw before he says anything else, taking one more step and pressing his lips to John’s forehead. Silver and gold hairs tickle his nose.

been making noises: wordless, breathy moans. Quirking her mouth into a smile, Sherlock huffed a small laugh. John chuckled in reply and pressed a quick kiss to one thigh, then the other.
“Yes, I know.”
Soon Sherlock twisted in place and leaned back into the cushions, John following closely after. He thrust his hips into Sherlock’s, kissed him sweetly as he shifted, and thrust again.
“I understand that there is a custom that dictates we should have sex this morning,” Sherlock stated into John’s mouth, his hands finding purchase on John’s hips. “I believe it would be to reaffirm this change in our relationship.”
"Six a year, then."
"Tell me what it's like."
He thinks The Words one night while he strokes Sherlock's feet, which sit on his lap. Quietly he rolls the idea of it over in his head.
“What the - Sherlock, what? Unlock this!”
Sherlock looks away, fixing his gaze on something on the mantel for a long time before answering.
Sherlock hummed happily as John shucked his vest and pants, and rolled on a condom. Slicking more lube on himself, he cradled Sherlock’s hips and positioned them both. He rubbed the head of his cock against Sherlock’s arse in slow movements, pressing on his hole and slipping past. Once he felt as desperate as he had ever been, he took a deep breath, held himself steady, and caressed any skin he could reach.
“Jesus, Harry, you’re drunk again.”
think of me. What - what do you think of me?”
“Go on, then,” he said to Peter, although his eyes were still boring into John. “Do it.”
“Oh! J- Be careful!”
“I really don’t, you know.” Harry sat at her table, not looking at John. “You beat the gambling. You’re in the city you love, with a job you love, with the person you love. And you’re fucking miserable whenever you stop to draw breath, and we both know why.” She buried her head in her arms. “I know I’m a fuck-up, but at least I gave it a
“You said we’d have to pretend one of us is not who we are, for the case. You said I could play Alpha. But you’re not attracted to Alphas, which ruins the pretence somewhat if we say we are married. You’re not a very good actor, you know.”
“Go back to bed,” ordered, his face stern. “You weren’t supposed to wake up for another ten minutes; I was going to bring this up.”
"Obviously."
"Mycroft is named after his father, too. He was seven when Mum was pregnant with me, and they told him they would name me William, he put on his
Turning a page of the newspaper, John tries to ignore him. After less than a minute, he snaps the paper down onto his knees.
"No good murders yet, today."
“Don’t you dare leave me again, John Watson,” he says, and he’s not being serious, John thinks, but he still feels the blow in his chest.
John laughed softly. "Really? How?"
. Good
Sherlock nodded and paced off, and John chased after her, still giggling.
It makes perfect sense, of course, but John cannot comprehend it. He sits Abi in her chair.
, you know the one, and he said 'Yes, William is a good name for the baby, but he needs a Mycroft name too.' So of course he finds this book of awful old names and chooses one for me."
“I don’t want you to feel… trapped?” He can’t see Sherlock’s face, so he stares instead at his toes. They curl a little, but don’t
“John, you need to fix my ear.”
A final swipe of lubricant was pressed into Sherlock. Peter directed him to hold his knees back as he gently but insistently pushed the head of his cock inside him. Sherlock gasped and groaned.
“Again, I wasn’t really involved.”
“Sshh,” John repeats. “Can’t wake your family.”
“Okay. Alright. Well. How about you show me what you like, then?”
"Anything. Everything, John.”
“I know. Come on, a cup of tea and some toast and jam, and I’ll kiss you until your mind palace falls down.”
“God,
When he knew that, John thought he could pick up the inconsistencies in Sherlock’s voice that indicated he could not hear himself properly. He faced Sherlock to make sure he could read his lips clearly, pushing his own ears to hang behind his shoulders.
"Let me go to the bathroom, hey? We should get ready and go home."
Sherlock bends, gasping when it shifts John’s cock in him. When their lips brush together, John slings one hand around the back of his neck to keep him in place, and curls the other around his cock.
Cracking an eye open, he peers at his husband.
How did he not know about these? John chided himself for not being more observant when he tended Sherlock’s bullet wound last year. His friend had rucked up his t-shirts or opened his button-up shirts as required to let John check and rebandage the small wound, but had never actually taken his top
"Mm."
She glanced away from the lock for a second, and John grinned down at her, unashamed. Turning back to her task, she smiled.
"It was… a little unplanned. I was learning the new roadways just north of Bart’s, and it sort of just happened."
“Take it, you berk.” John flopped an arm over his eyes as Sherlock accepted the call. “Fucking Holmeses interrupting this whole business again. Of fucking course.”
Sherlock nodded and lipped at his fingertips.
"Not at all."
John smiled at Sherlock’s observation.
John grins breathlessly.
John reaches over to take Sherlock’s hand, and shakes his head.
His body is hot and tight around John, his face utterly guileless. He tries to roll his hips, to stroke himself, but John holds him still and pets his side until he calms.
Between the sheets, Sherlock took John's hands and kissed his fingers.
. John rocks back and forth inside Sherlock, stroking him in time with his thrusts.
Sherlock probably thinks he's being subtle as he sidles towards the head of the bed.
“No, sorry, John.”
into Sherlock’s room threatened to derail his train of thought entirely), he wouldn't have to spend the two hours on the train musing on those scars, where they came from, and
Sherlock grabbed his wrist, jamming John’s hand under his hips so he could feel his satin cock, stiffer than he expected. “I am, and you may.”
“”I trust you, John.”
“Mm, no. Show me on you. Show me how you make yourself come.”
John snorted a laugh, and shifted to kiss him again.
“Where is he?”
I said I was worried,” he snaps.
“You had fresh wounds on your back when I knocked you down in the restaurant? And you never told me?”
Sherlock waves him away.
“Of course, I just. A moment.”
“Harry’s. Three days. Christmas.”
"Ah, that's a secret, I'm sorry. I do it for this one, see-" he pats Marie's hand, "and if I tell her, she won't need me for anything."
“John?”
"I know you got tested too, after... everything."
to him.
“You’re doing so well, just let go. Come on, beautiful.” Sherlock’s gaze was still holding him in place, and John reached out with his free hand to push and hold riotous sweaty curls out of the way. At the sustained contact Sherlock’s back arched and his mouth opened wider, and John could only stare back at him as he came silently. He was distantly aware of Peter releasing Sherlock’s spent cock and slowing his motions.
"I'll remove it if you want," Sherlock promises immediately. "I only turn it on an hour after you've gone to bed."
“Sherlock?”
“Yes.”
The upshot is that Sherlock takes to ‘fixing’ John’s hair before they leave the house. It becomes so normal that John tends to wait by the door, head turned slightly up, eyes ready to close. He would not be able to look at Sherlock that closely and not give away his desires.
Sherlock teases another finger around his entrance, pressing it in a little. He ghosts fingers up John’s length, and John groans deep in his throat as he spills all over Sherlock's chest. Sherlock hums happily and swipes a finger through the mess to taste it as John, panting, redoubles his efforts. With a shout, Sherlock comes hard, his entire cock twitching and jerking in John's mouth.
"Just a - let me - mm. Okay," he said, running fingertips from cloth up into fur, and back down. Sherlock made a strangled noise and shifted again.
Light fingers stroked his ear, then skimmed his body to cup his balls loosely, and he was coming.
John manages another couple of pints while Sherlock judges the situation in the pub. He does not share his thoughts, though, and eventually bundles a happily pliant John into a taxi home.
“If you want. Cheeky shit,” he murmured, licking into his mouth. Shaking fingers wrapped around his own.
He stares.
“You’re such a bastard, god, I love you so much.” His hand on Sherlock’s cock moves faster, now, firmer, and Sherlock thinks he has more to say but it is muffled into his neck and collarbone. John is meeting him thrust for thrust. When he shushes him, it takes Sherlock a moment to recognise he’s groaning, and another to stop himself.
Freshly showered, John tied his robe firmly around his waist, steeled himself against heartbreak, and stepped out into the kitchen and living area. Lying on the sofa, Sherlock was clearly in his mind palace, filing or searching for something. John headed upstairs to get dressed. Sherlock had his answers now; everything would go back to how it was. He grimaced at the thought.
Hanging onto the bedhead, Sherlock positions himself over John, who holds his erection steady to guide it inside him. Instead of sinking right onto him, he teases them both by rocking his hips, sliding John’s cock against himself, over and over.
"Hmm."
John took the last step down. “You’re making me breakfast in bed?”
"You mean you don’t know?"
Time passes.
“You’re cooking for me.”
"Yeah, but she said 'family dinner'. Why do I have to come too?"
“I’m not - I can’t - I -
“Not going to comment, on the - no, of course not. Yes, I’m very good,” he replied. Burying his face in his pillow, Sherlock shifted his hips a little then relaxed into the mattress.
“You agreed. If it doesn’t work, we go to your Maker.”
“D’you guys have fun?” he mumbles.
“Lube - pass me… Pass me the lube,” he gasps, pawing at John’s arm.
“Mm.” Sherlock clenched his jaw. "Wait."
." His own cock was certainly taking an interest. Tucked up under Sherlock’s chin as he was, there was no way he hadn’t noticed.
their body, should be this alluring.
“Then what the fuck are you doing here?
John sighs heavily, but his toes when they stroke and rest against the side of Sherlock’s foot are light.
“Mm. Merry Christmas.” Sherlock rolled away from John, curling into himself. John spotted a flash of red and blue in the light that came from behind him.
“Can’t believe you took so long to figure it out.”
"What happened?" John demands, ignoring Sherlock's huff of impatience.
“You seem to be having difficulty with the concept.”
“Ah, just… the… normal - Anything, John, I’ll like it.”
"Yes," Sherlock said. "And."
"Yeah?"
John gives Sherlock a leg rub.
“This alright?”
“Christ, Sherlock."
But they aren't those people, and John hates it. Sherlock sees his discomfort, of course, and tries to be more accommodating, which has John more frustrated than ever.
It’s hard to put into words. Eventually, he says “You’re my best friend,” and it doesn’t even begin to cover it.
better.”
your pity.”
A short cab ride took him to his front door, where he hesitated. If whatever he did next did not go well, he would be as lost as he was six years ago. Opening the door, he made his way quickly but silently up the stairs - it was after 1, and Mrs Hudson was not a heavy sleeper.
“Trousers off?”
“Mm.” He turned his head a little to receive a kiss on the cheek, which John happily gave.
“Thankyou.” He stands and corners John against the bench.
The dress is beyond repair, in the end.
"When on earth did he tell you that?"
He stopped short, just over the threshold into Sherlock’s room.
“No, I like this.”
John has watched him open himself up before – they have tried many things in the last few months. He strips as quickly as he can and lies in the middle of his bed. John sits on the edge of the mattress, absently playing with his cock as it hardens.
"My hero - thank you," John murmurs, and feels Sherlock chuckle.
“John! John, yes, please. Yes! Please, John!”
Sherlock huffs an impatient breath as he feeds Abigael her breakfast and John potters nervously.
Leaning forward in small jerking motions, Sherlock touched their foreheads together. Their breath mingled.
“We could - or -”
"Alright," John said, and tried to move back, but Sherlock held him close.
Sherlock growls and catches John’s lower lip between his teeth, and John laughs more.
If he hadn't barged into Sherlock’s room uninvited (the thought of being
“Don’t care.” John loves everything about him, he has assured Sherlock, including the way he tends to cling, limpet-like, to John after sex. “Mycroft will see what you’ve done to my neck, anyway. Mum might go so far as to call you a Christmas miracle, or some such sentimentality. Let’s just see Dad in the morning before we head home. He will at least be reasonable.”
"No, Sherlock,
John can feel Sherlock’s eyes on him now, but he does not waver.
"Sounds exactly like when I am here."
“Sure. Yeah. Come on, your room again?” Sherlock followed quietly, and when John reached the bed and turned to face him, he had already undone half the buttons on his shirt.
“Do you look at jobs in other cities sometimes, John? You know, a fresh start.”
“So. Are you going to… go, or join me, or…?” and that seems to completely stupefy him. So John waits a little, and when he gets no answer, he says “Well, if it’s all the same to you, I might. You know. Continue.”
Sherlock and pulls himself off quickly, his nose buried in his pillow.
“You wouldn't mind?”
“Of course,” she replied, holding the bow poised over the strings as she decided what to play next. “I heard what you said at my gravestone, and - I feel... the same. You’re my best friend.” A smile spread itself across her face, forced but still real.
"No," agrees Sherlock. "You can't do that until you're inside me."
"I'll, uh, pop round the shop," he offers. "Let you... finish, oh God, and
“I think you’re lovely,” John insists.
"I'll tell you what happened, John, one morning in the middle of term in she walks like she never left. God, I was furious."
," he says, and leans in to press his forehead gently against John's own.
“John, ohhh.”
“All good?” His friend looked at him and smiled, looking dazed. Small panting sounds escaped his mouth rhythmically.
John sighed, long and slow. “Don’t worry, a trip to Ann Summers and I’ll be right. I’m not leaving you, Sherlock. You’re stuck with me.”
"died in a car crash, and there wasn't quite as much money in savings as she thought-"
“Together?” She sounded winded.
“I bet your boyfriend wasn’t secretly a lying assassin who tried to kill your best friend, though,” I can’t resist grumbling. Ever the drama queen, he throws his hands in the air and sighs loudly.
“Okay. Let’s do it.”
“I’m not-” she started to say, but stopped as she realised she
He lets a smile creep over his face. "Let's go to bed."
"Alright, whatever." The man rolls his eyes as he stands and stalks away. Sherlock remains pressed against John's arm.
"Would you mind keeping an eye on her while I bring up the rest of my things?"
“Baker Street is the best home I’ve ever had, and there’s plenty of people I care about here. Best of luck with the interview, Molls, but we’ll both miss you if you get it.”
The first thing he says when Lestrade arrives is directions to where he’s left John. Lestrade waves him away.
"You're welcome." He sat in his chair and pulled up a few news pages on his computer.
John’s face wrinkled in confusion and fell in understanding.
on Christmas Day.”
Understanding what he has said happens gradually. The air between us is still but for our breathing. My hands tingle as they grip the chair, and I can feel my heart beat.
"There'll be no helicopter to get us out of this one."
"Mm."
She covered John with her mouth and set to work loving John with lips and tongue, as directly as she dared. John
“It’s all moot anyway; there is no future here.”
He glares at me, and I wonder if I was not meant to acknowledge anything that happened while he was high.
when these were healing?”
“Yeah?” I prompt, a hand on his arm.
“Go on then." He waits, body and face still.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock frowns at me, and I know I’ve once again done something other than what he had anticipated.
"... Yes."
He shifted to lie in the centre of the bed, head propped up on pillows, and almost before he was settled John was climbing over him.
"How- okay. Okay."
John looked momentarily pained by that, but the expression was wiped off his face by a lengthy yawn. He ended up nodding and pulling off his jumper, unbuttoning the shirt underneath. Although he knew the likelihood of being caught out was minimal, Sherlock kept his gaze from lingering overlong on John’s trim torso when it was bared. He made himself look away entirely when jeans were pushed down.
It took an age for even the head of his cock to press inside, and John curled over to press a kiss to Sherlock’s spine. “How are you going, there,” he asked, whispering without meaning to.
don’t do anything.
“Yes. Yes, let me - yes.” Sherlock’s hands seemed to tremble slightly, so John took over the task of unbuttoning the shirt. His fingers ghosted over alabaster skin, skipping the small scar in the centre.
He heard a small noise of assent from Sherlock, who then rolled over to allow John to stroke his lower back and arse, just like he promised, just the way John liked.
“Our first time, when we – in the kitchen? That was your – your very first time?”
John shrugs.
"The book. You like it."
When he managed to look away for a second, Peter was smiling at them, tension in his posture as he held himself back. Sherlock seemed to come back to himself then, and rolled his hips provocatively.
“Of course. I’m not letting you go without me.”
Sherlock groaned and tugged at his shoulders, pulling him up once more and kissing him fiercely. John leaned into Sherlock and he obligingly lay back, letting him roam his hands over his chest and belly, smearing the mess across his skin. Although he rutted lazily against Sherlock’s thigh, John found he was more than content to continue kissing as Sherlock came back to earth, gradually calming and slowing. Huge hands traced up his body, caressed his face. Shifting only far enough to focus on his face, John smiled down at him.
“What? No, not the - were you going to tell me, I was worried about that. No, you. I’ve figured you out.”
"You've dealt with his type before." It’s a deduction, not a question, but John answers anyway.
Harry suggested they call in takeaway for dinner. John, who was already starting to investigate what she had in that he could cook with, turned to her, his expression slipping towards real annoyance.
“I could be convinced.”
“But…”
"No, John. I can
“If you say so,” John agreed placidly. “Are you ready?”
“Always.” His forehead.
"God only knows why," John grins.

"Not from this angle. I've had to sham at being a boyfriend for a couple men and women in my classes at uni, or in my unit." He does not receive a reply other than a quick kiss to his shoulder before Sherlock pulls away. They sit amicably for a time, Sherlock surveying, John nursing the dregs of his beer. Then:
He nods, his face tight, and instructs the driver to take us to Baker St. I wait in silence.
“I need you to stay,” she told the wallpaper. “I had to be better than… all of
Spreading her knees, Sherlock canted her hips up. With a giggle, John put her mouth on her again, nipping and sucking her inner folds between firm wriggles of her tongue against her clit. When she replaced her mouth with her hand, she turned her head to place a sweet kiss to Sherlock’s thigh.
“Alright, I think I’m done,” he said lowly.
“I thought it would be my last chance, so I took the opportunity. That’s… all.”
She presses him a little further.
"You're so fucking beautiful," John has to say.
"Well, there's little need for hurry. The case can wait."
.” The word drops from his lips without conscious thought. Something is about to happen, maybe ruining them forever, but he cannot stop admiring John. “How-”
“Yes, I know.” He greets a waitress, and they make their way to a table. “You talk and make friends; you’re good at that. It distracts people from my investigating.”
“‘Kay, I’ll kiss you in five minutes,” John mumbles as he turns once more away from him. “Let me get that bit more sleep.”
"Oh." His hands were a little dry, catching on cloth when he dropped one to caress him. The fingers on his other hand danced and slid through fur, hopefully creating pleasurable sensations. "Can - May I - Are you - ?"
the talking!”
"Wait, wait, ssss-no don't stop, just hang on a sec love, ah," he gasps and grips the base of his cock tight, trying to breathe deeply and evenly. "Don't want to come yet."
When he wakes up, then, with no plans for the day, he stretches in bed and shoves his hand in his pants. He’s not thinking of much at all, really, just enjoying the grip and slide of his hand. Carefully messy hair pops into thought a few times, as does a rumbling chuckle and large, delicate hands, but that’s neither new nor surprising. The creaking of the last step before the landing gives him barely enough warning to extract his hand and lift a knee to hide his erection as the door opens.
"That's just biology. Of course you want that then. But truly, in your head - and that's where attraction and arousal starts - you're not interested."
A pair of comically large hands pressed his own hand to the inked flesh, and John could feel Sherlock’s heart beating beneath his initials.
“I’ll only buy semi-skimmed milk for the rest of your life.”
“That is… actually exactly what you do, Christ, do you not even realise it? And when I
“Jesus Christ, Sherlock,” he gasped when the torture abated. “I was trying to set the mood.”
“Come on, love, you’re so gorgeous,” she crooned, and Sherlock grinned even as she brought her own hand down to stop John. Then John crawled up the length of her body and kissed her again, on the mouth, rather less gently. John tasted like her.
John nods slowly.
John squirmed and tried to bite back his laughter, but when Sherlock wiggled his fingers into his sides, he giggled and yelled.

is a favourite imagining, even more so than
"Wh-"
"Or kneel over my head," he adds, and the imagery that inspires makes John swear and thrust up.
“Oh. You were asleep, sorry.”
“Listen, is it good? It’s okay if you want to stop or anything.”
"Yeah, course," John answers, staring at the stranger. "This guy's just leaving."
“Have you.”
“Jnngffsh!”
“And that speech, Jesus! The whole - you said you had a lifetime to prove you - you - my god, and even before that, you saved me from being fucking burnt alive.
Sherlock is pleasantly warm all over from the wine and whiskey, but he feels his cheeks burn red.
. Suddenly everything seems a little cloying. Draining his tea, he stands and takes his daughter.
John shakes his head, his eyes already getting heavy.
“I love you,” he assured him, and Sherlock nodded again, grazing fingertips from John’s knuckles to wrist and back. John took that as invitation to continue the gentle movement.
"Alright, it's okay, let's get you out of these clothes, yeah?"
John shucked his clothes and returned immediately to Sherlock’s embrace. Long arms wrapped around him, and he slipped his hand down to position his cock between them, pressing against Sherlock's own. He relished Sherlock’s hiss at the sensation.
“I can’t say I ever really had any great desire to have children,” Sherlock whispers, and John stops breathing entirely to hear him better, “but if I did…” he doesn’t say anything more, but gestures loosely at the television. His hand, when it comes to rest, lands on John's thigh.

“Yes. Yes, please.”

“I’ve got you,” he repeated.
"I had it pretty well down in university, but on these meds... I don't know. I usually get about four or five day's notice, with the cramps and things. I should have four heats a year, give or take a week."

“Mm. D’you want me to stop?”
Together they clumsily undid the flies of his trousers and pushed them down. Dropping onto a knee, John kissed down from his navel to tease the skin at the top edge of his pants. He tugged them a little lower to press his lips lower and lower still. When he rubbed his nose into curly auburn hair, Sherlock made a surprised little noise.
“Do - Do I take my shirt off, now?”
“Yeah,” I murmur back at him. “Let’s go get this bastard.”
“Once I get us inside, then.”
“Sherlock.”
“But-”
John does not get angry loudly. He restrains himself, and Sherlock knows the flatter and blanker his voice and face gets, the madder he is. John stands the box of cereal on the bench and turns to look past Sherlock, who has to know this was not good.
you; how about we - no. Never mind. And I’m not even going to reply to the ‘mediocre’ jab.”
“You’ve charted Abi’s feeding?”
“Oh.” Sherlock puts a finger to his mouth, appears to actually be internalising what John has said. “That’s… good.”

They'd slept together every night since the close of the previous case, but had not had sex again after that first time in the kitchen, and John didn't expect anything more than what Sherlock suggested. He knew Dolls functioned... differently, and it wasn't as if he was starved of affection. Sherlock had taken to winding himself around John as he lay in bed or sat in his chair or stood in the kitchen, face pressed into his neck, fingers encircling his wrist to take his pulse.
“Nnf?”
, more than a year ago. I thought you were busy being infatuated."
His hand goes to his mouth. “John, all relationships have stressors, and all relationships take effort to resolve. I’m sure if you just-”
“Well, it’s going to be different every time, that’s part of the appeal isn’t it?”
Sherlock hummed tunelessly.
“My bedroom -
She was still breathless and oversensitive and quaking against John’s fingers, hands caught in the air above her, when John started to giggle, a low murmur of happiness. Her head was still between Sherlock’s shaking thighs, and she kissed them gently, her hand pressing flat against her clit to coax out another few pulses.
They shifted closer together. One huge hand slid over his skin and cupped the quivering fur, dwarfing John's tiny tail.
“I don’t want to leave either, so-” He is raising his voice, and is unwilling to stop himself- “for the love of God, will you
"Some of it," he says carefully. "If you want to - get it off your chest, I’m listening."
John sighs and lets his shoulders roll in on themselves.
"I recall," Mycroft replies in his please-punch-me-John voice. His phone rings. "Please excuse me. Start dinner without me if necessary." He disappears into the rest of the house. John picks up the gardening magazine on the coffee table and sits, leafing idly through it. Within a few minutes Marie bustles into the room. She is still a forceful character, and John can not imagine her in her heyday. He thinks of Sherlock. Maybe he can.
“Yeah, come on.”
It’s like a breaking dam, John finds. The long-awaited leak leads to the collapse of the whole structure, and he feels drunk on the truths he presses into Sherlock’s skin. He’s soft, and gentle, but Sherlock is a violin string under his hands, taut and singing with each stroke. John would happily drown himself in this moment.
- and the immediate reply -
Giggling, John took her phone back and started pecking out a reply.
“So… you meant it, then? Last night? You… love… me.”
“Good. Truly, John, I’m very happy about this.”
“I just-”
“Oh! I - John, are you going to put your tongue -
"Half past two," Sherlock answers. John nods and rolls away from him, reaching behind himself to flip back the duvet in invitation.
It’s not hard to deduce he’s out of practice. But his lips are soft, and the hand at my back is firm. I smear the edges of our kiss past the curve of his lip to the line of his jaw, the plane of his cheek.
“Shut up, beautiful.”
“If you’re still tired, get to your own damn bed,” John tells him, offering a smile.
It's said dryly, and it isn't even Mycroft's house for him to say such a thing, but John has gained some idea of when to take Mycroft at his word, and it does put him a little at ease.
“You made me watch that movie, once.” It’s been at least ten minutes, and I snort.
Sherlock only grins wider.
"Alright.” He thinks about asking if Sherlock would like to help him out with his next heat, Alpha knot or no. He is probably curious - surely he knows Hollywood sanitised what a heat involved.
“Don’t care. Love you. Loved that.”
"Just forget it."
“C’mere, you bloody giraffe. Let me kiss you.”
know I feel the same, Sherlock. I - I always have. Since that first night at Angelo’s.”
Sherlock obediently leans in slightly.
“I fell in love with you first. I should get to say it first.”
"My little dove. Let me just mix this damned formula together, love, and then you can have a nice drink. Maybe I can have a nice drink later."
“You’re sleeping too, or you gonna do your thinky thing all night?”
He can’t think of anything to say to defend himself. John is treading dangerously close to the truth.
“You’ll be alone,” John countered.
“Yes, let’s - yes.” Sherlock had fucking
“Oh,” teased John, feigning surprise. “That I love you?”
how soft and gentle he could be, if only they were the type of people who took each other's clothes off with reverent fingers and deep kisses.
“Regularity has a higher priority than invisibility; it aids in motility.”
"Nope," John ruled, setting down the newly completed tail. Sherlock pouted as prettily as he could, drooping his ears dejectedly.
John breathed a laugh.
“So if you can tell when I’ve been attracted to a man, regardless of if anything actually happened or not, why did you not know about my… that… until the wedding?”
. Running through their cases in his head, he assured himself, for whatever it was worth, that they had been sustained while Sherlock was dead and he wasn't there to protect him.
"I need you in me, John," Sherlock gasped. Holding John's wrist, he guided his fingers to his arse. "Here. Please." John nodded desperately.
"I always do, don't I?"
Sherlock’s tongue darted out to lap at his skin and he jerked without conscious thought.
“Could’ve woken up better,” he pointed out. Sherlock turned in his embrace and scowled at him.
“Merry Christmas. Is that my jumper?” Sitting up rather suddenly, Sherlock looked down at his torso with something of a grimace.
"I want you to do whatever makes you happy," John vowed.
“I’m ready enough, please, please.”
Sherlock staggers up to rifle through a cupboard and argues quietly with the VHS player for a few moments. He returns with the remote control, and a second of static clears into what John briefly thinks is Sherlock holding an infant, until he realises it is of course Will holding a tiny Sherlock.
“Yeah, I know, muppet.” John glances back from the stove to where Sherlock is trying to feed Abigael a variety of soft food. “He’s just like that. You learn to go with it.”
He remembers to check the temperature only a second before bringing the teat to Abigael's mouth, and coaxes a drop onto his inner wrist.
is that supposed to mean.”
“Yes, and now I have
"Car crash," interjects Marie flatly.
He shakes his head again.
"Jesus
“Yes, that's rather my point.”
The bed jumps as Sherlock throws himself down in a miniature sulk.
“But-” she couldn’t think. “But you keep finding boyfriends. You were going to move in with Mark.”
“Heh. Because if I let you out of my sight someone will - will blow up the living room, or drug you with hallucinogenic gas, or make you think getting
“Have you tried this, yourself?” he asked, with a glance up through his lashes. Sherlock nodded.
“You don’t look so happy with your boyfriend, cutie.”
“Of the two of us,” he points out, “the women of London have determined you to be far more attractive.”
unravelled then rolled to lay on his back beside him, shoving his pyjamas down to fist his cock desperately. This wouldn't take long.
John made sure he had non-threatening body language, a skill learnt as much in consultation rooms as in Afghanistan, before he said anything else. Sherlock was being incredibly skittish, and he didn’t want to scare him off; he needed to look after him.
John shrugged and kissed her again.
“What?”
. In the future, I need you to stop assuming you know what’s best for me. And tell me if you’re worried - about anything.”
“Actually, is kissing off-limits while you’re working?”
, you know what I mean and you know I’m right. Bathroom, shirt off, now.”
“Keep your hands there, love, hang on, I’ve got you. Come here. Kiss me while you ride me, you can do that, yeah? You can come like that?”
“Yes,” Sherlock rasped. He swallowed, feeling his heart pounding staccato from his chest to his pulse in his throat, his groin. “I love you, John.”
would be straight-up taking him to bed and shagging him silly. I promise I’ll come to your wedding when you marry the right bloody person.”
John supposed he could see what Sherlock was saying.
"She could do, yeah."
nice night.”
"N-Like hell I do! She's your mother!"
John groaned. They both knew Sherlock would win this argument.
"Christ, Sherlock. Please."
find out how to take the new Moriarty down.
"You mentioned you like bees, so..."
"I know he thinks that. But we came to an arrangement, and I got her out of that fix in Karachi. She really is under witness protection in America."
“I don’t know if- I don’t know what you want, John.” Despite his flushed skin and kiss-swollen lips, he looked nervous.
he's not being subtle with that deflection.
“I only really care what
The following day, as most days after a successful case, was a blissful reprieve from mania. Sherlock continued his (fourth or fifth) perusal of his beekeeping book, and John caught up on emails and bills. After dinner, John bullied Sherlock into letting him change the dressing on his back, with less difficulty than the day before. Sherlock began unbuttoning his shirt as he sat in the lounge room, and John tore his gaze away long enough to collect the first aid kit. This time after he smoothed cream over the fresh wound, he traced a finger lightly over a particularly silvered line.
They silently agree (John begs, Sherlock concedes) to not discuss anything that may have been overheard before Sherlock allowed him that unrecorded hour at night.
?” The question is out almost before he has thought it.
“I loved that,” John admitted happily, and Sherlock beamed back at her.
“John,”
“Always.” The tip of his nose is blessed with a kiss.
“No,” Sherlock grits out, painfully. “Why do
be like that for everyone. How would anyone achieve anything,
“Oh,” he breathed, and tangled his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “Yeah.”
“Only relatively recently. At your wedding,” explains Sherlock.
His eyes flicker between John’s eyes and mouth as he stretches his head up a little. John breathes a disbelieving laugh and bends to meet him. The fire slowly settles into glowing coals.
“I want, I want.”
He shakes his head, smiles wider.
“Alright, it’s okay,” he murmured with a little more confidence than he truly felt, dragging his lips against sensitive skin. “I’ve got you.”
“I’m starting to come to that conclusion, yes.”
“Well, it wasn’t in the
“Uh-huh. Nnn, John!” John felt Sherlock clench around his cock as he wailed softly, his hand on himself speeding up. With his own hands on Sherlock’s waist and shoulder, John held him still while he thrust into him more urgently, both chasing their climax.
“Come on, Bean, I know you want to cuddle into your cot. Yes. Alright, dear. Daddy’s right here if you need him, and I’m right downstairs. We’ll look out for you.”
Looking up from her microscope, Sherlock frowned at her as she stomped into the kitchen.
... these can make a person."
"You’re not on a case without me, are you," John started.
“I do!”
“Yeah. It’s… John?”
Sherlock huffs, and buries his face in John's neck.
Greg opened and shut his mouth only a few times when they arrived at the scene, John’s fingers tangled decisively around Sherlock’s.
Sherlock does as instructed, picking up John's blanket-covered ankles and resting them on his legs.
John was not unfamiliar at leaning up into a taller person’s space to take their mouth with his own. He pulled Sherlock along with him as he stepped back towards the bed, hands clutching his pyjama shirt like he wouldn’t follow John and his kisses anywhere.
Sherlock can’t keep up.
“Yes,” Sherlock interrupted. John laughed breathlessly. “You’d let me do anything?”
“Stop
"No! No. I like it." He reached out to skim a fingertip over Sherlock’s tattoo. Four squares arranged themselves down his side, looking for all the world like elements from the periodic table, except that they were… not.
"The case can... what?"
Sleep took her eventually, and she woke to John’s fingers (short, dextrous) brushing her hair from her face.
my ears and has been
“Mmm?”
"Not at all. I doubt there is anywhere outside Baker Street that you would be more welcome."
“You-” he had to pause. “Your back was raw with these when you climbed into that bloody bonfire to pull me out.”
“There,” he murmured, grinding down on Sherlock’s thigh. “How about this?”
About an inch into the sewing, Sherlock began to squirm.
on the forehead,” John clarifies. This startles a chuckle out of him, and while he is still smiling, John surges towards him to press their lips together.
Mrs Hudson has the kettle on and Abigael cradled in one arm, and he can't begrudge her the time for a cuppa.
“Go on,” John encouraged. “I’ve got you. Fuck my hand, Sherlock, come on, you can come for me, can’t you?”
Sherlock shuddered and groaned through his climax, dropping his head between his arms as they shook. John murmured soft encouragements to him, gentling his touch on Sherlock’s cock.
"Goodnight."
“To not speak about this. I’m quite sure I know the answer, but let me… check.”
Sherlock's in the shower when he returns, and John loudly gets himself a toasted sandwich for dinner and retreats to his bedroom - he can't imagine what he will say to Sherlock when he sees him next.
“What was that? If you’re not comfortable with that, it’s okay, we can-”
“Your tail is fascinating,” continued Sherlock. “I want to hold it.”
“Sorry. I’m sorry. You should go to your Maker to fix that, then.”
He can't think of anything else, but at the same time he seems unable to comprehend what he saw this afternoon, and
“Home,” Sherlock declared.
Mycroft, already impeccably suited, looks at his phone and tucks it into his pocket, pointedly ignoring Sherlock’s furious glare.
“It wouldn’t change what-”
Sherlock was getting dressed, his head hidden inside a battered t-shirt. His back was turned to John, and although he spun around when he heard John enter, he was not fast enough for him not to see the lattice of scar tissue marking the skin of his back. Unsure what to say, John remained in stunned silence.
,” he accuses.
“John!
“What do you need me to do,’’ he murmurs.
“Gnfh.” He squeezed lightly and gloried in Sherlock grinding down against him.
“Gonna kiss you all over,” John repeated, and he nodded and shoved down his pants entirely, stepping out of them.
“Thanks again, John,” he said as John saw him down to the street.
“Green. That’s so. John. Please. Isn’t that... Oh my God. In me. Green, yes?”
They’re chasing down a serial killer now, though, who has been targeting shorter men in their forties and fifties. Something to do with their father; Sherlock had dismissed the information once he was sure John could remind him of it if necessary.
“Behave,” he growled.
“Thanks,” was all he said, and Sherlock mumbled a “thank you, John,” as well. With no idea how to respond, John stammered something about cloths to clean up, and fled. In the bathroom he grabbed a handful of tissues, shoved his jeans down and came almost immediately. A deep breath steadied him. He ran hot water over some flannels and squeezed them out, and marched back to the bedroom.
With some difficulty, Sherlock nodded.
Three hours later, they are still sitting around the table, although John has cleared the plates and Will has packed the leftovers into the fridge. Marie has plied them all with more wine than they can drive home on, and is now amending Will's recollection of their courtship.
“Course you are.”
With that as a constant mantra in his head, John sat and rested his hand where the tail would go. Pursing his lips, he snuck his finest thread-cutting scissors into the gap between fabric pieces, snagged and cut a stitch. He could then begin the process of opening a sufficient gap to secure the decadent tail.
John frowned.
“Well. Last time, you had it cut just so around your jaw? I wanted to pin you up against the wall and kiss you there until your knees gave out.” She pressed a finger gently against Sherlock’s lips, pulled the lower down a little. “Want to kiss you now, actually.”
He watched Sherlock consider for a moment, then smile coyly.
“Your tail was twitching.” Sherlock paused. “It’s twitching now. That’s… I’m not hurting you, am I?” He tried to move back, but John’s hands flew to Sherlock’s hips to keep them together.
"I'd barely known Sherlock four months by my birthday in twenty-ten."
Molly provides the match to spark the argument John has been itching for. She mentions she’ll be interviewing for a position in Leeds, rambles about being both excited and nervous at the prospect of living in a new city. Sherlock makes appropriate sorts of noises whenever she pauses for breath as he examines the body. Then:
“Better?” he asked.
"What happened today? Would you like to talk about it?"
Defeated, John hung his head until it rested against Sherlock’s shoulder.
John’s eyebrows and hair wrinkle towards each other.
John knows he is blushing, and there are high spots of colour on Sherlock’s cheeks.
"No. No, I've already shared more than I'm really comfortable with. Some things can stay private."
handcuffs, that you stole from Greg?” John produces them. “Course I do.” He’s enjoying this, Sherlock knows. That will make him angrier about what Sherlock is about to do, and Sherlock truly does hate making John angry, but he’s nearing forty, himself. Time to grow up; time to think ahead and plan for the future. He’s not a pouting child any more, nor is he a junkie student.
“Please.”
“We’ve got nothing on this morning?”
, the train pulled in to Euston.
When she is lifted from his arms he jolts awake.
His fingers sank easily into Sherlock’s body, and he crooked them slightly as he kissed the curve of his backside. Sherlock groaned and tried to grind back onto John’s hand, but John held him steady.
John frowned, clicking through the images like they would turn Sherlock’s words into something sensible.
He says as much to Sherlock, who chuckles between gasps.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock agreed quickly. “Please.”
“Ah, well, I probably shouldn’t, so-”
“I want you to kiss me again,” he explains.
“I’ll get some dinner on soon.”
“Moriarty isn’t a
Sherlock appears unable to say anything but manages to nod, and John continues.
“John -
"'Particularly risky'," John laughs darkly.
“Let me, for you?”
“I’m just happy.” He pressed back into the lithe body behind him.
John nods and nips Sherlock's jaw, up to his ear.
As comfortable as he is, it’s easy for John to sink back into sleep when he blinks his eyes open to see the curtains blocking only the streetlights. It happens a few times, and when the morning outside seems bright enough, he smiles to himself and shifts slightly. Letting his eyes close again, he rolls away from the light of day, mashing his face into Sherlock’s shoulder. With just his mouth, he navigates from humerus to clavicle, letting his lips catch and drag as he slides inwards. Sherlock grumbles into semiconsciousness, and John can feel the vibrations with his hand on Sherlock’s ribs. A dozen nipping kisses bring him up the frankly unfair expanse of throat to his jaw. He nuzzles it blindly, loving the crisp bass voice smudged with slumber.
As often ends up happening on longer train journeys, he dozed lightly, and yawned repeatedly as the train pulled in to Manchester. Pulling out his mobile, he called Harry and found her by the escalator. A quick hug assured him she hadn't (yet) been drinking heavily today.
"Of course you did, genius. Come on, roll over for me, yeah?"
“They’re for me to remember.”
John giggles and wriggles closer.
agitated. John wonders if he is crazy for trying to read Sherlock by his toes.
He could see Sherlock smile lazily.
"Uh. Thanks."
“Don’t start with cheap tricks with me,” John warns. “I have a sister; I know how to fight dirty.”
“Shut up and wait for the tram.”
"So did you."
“Sherlock, you-”
“Yeah?” John thrust harder. “I suppose. You don’t do anything by halves, do you?”
“No, it’s… fine.”
“I’ll see you at home, yeah?” I ask. She says something in reply, but I’m already catching up with Sherlock, getting into the car before he can leave.
He settles in his seat.
“John.”
John giggled, and Sherlock felt warmth bloom through her torso.
“There is nothing ‘perfect’ about this timing,” replied Sherlock, scowling as he climbed off the mattress. “It’s Mycroft.” His scowl deepened.
“Sod the bacon,” John suggested.
He smiles fondly at them, smoothing a hand over Sherlock’s temple then Abigael’s. Then he drags himself back upstairs.
“You’d hate that more than I would.”
“You’re doing so well,” he assured him. “Do you like it?” Sherlock opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. John grinned. “You like it hard? You want to feel it all week?” The fingers clenching around his own were answer enough.
“I’ll make
. He flushed slightly when he remembered that he did, in fact, notice that, with no small measure of jealous longing that he had tried to repress. Since he’d moved back in he’d tried not to think too much about Sherlock’s habit, long in the past now, of wandering around in nothing more than a sheet or towel. John had had two years to come to terms with and move past his attraction to Sherlock, and now, after everything, he’d been telling himself it’s too soon after Mary and
“You never said that,” John teases. “I’m on my stomach, aren’t I?” He rolls his hips, presses his groin against Sherlock’s.
“Be sure to keep her warm, Dr Watson,” the nurse cautions, tucking yet another blanket around Abigael in her carrier.
John looks quickly to both brothers. Sherlock is cultivating his classic "bored" face, while Mycroft appears to not hear anything that is being said.
"Like you can talk," John snaps. After a brief period in his early twenties where he looked into surgery to remove his reproductive system, he’s mostly come to terms with what he is. He’s not comfortable with people fetishising his gender, though, and tries (fairly successfully) to keep it under wraps. His flatmate, on the other hand, makes the most of people’s assumptions, not for his own comfort, but merely for convenience.
“You’re sweet, John. I’ll see you round,” he smiled, and was off towards the tube.
Pulling Sherlock around to face him, he tried to make his friend focus.
“Yes, John.”
John shook his head.
"Me too. It's good to be home."
“What about Mary?”
When Sherlock beams up at him, John’s breath hitches in his chest. Flushing red, he clambers over Sherlock into position.
“Sherlock, are you seriously telling me this?”
“- come with my fingers inside you?” finished Sherlock, and John
“Oh fuck, Sherlock, that’s good.”
“Yes.”
, onto John’s hand, and John continued pressing into him, working a second finger alongside the first as he took him right into his mouth. Sucking at it produced a tight little bucking up of his hips, and when he finally had his fingers right into him, pushing his face firmly against him could make him twitch and moan.
“Always, John. Please.”
stop treating me like a piece of goddamned porcelain? I’m not going
"Ah. Well, I've still got a ways to go, and then I want to make sure your spinal seam is secure. So."
. I suppose I pretended that rather a lot, and it stuck. Then I was Sherlock all the time."
“Right here?” Sherlock’s eyes glistened.
“Naked on the bed, then, love. Show me what you’d do with your toy.”
. Again."
“It was about getting out from everyone’s shadow! Yours, Mum’s, Dad’s, Clara’s… I need to live my own life.”
“You think it’s merely a
“It’s good, yeah?”
John clambered onto the bed, wedging a knee between Sherlock’s thighs. Gingerly he pulled his hand from underneath him and took two handfuls of plump arse, easing them apart to get a glimpse of his tightly gathered hole.
“Then what I want is - you, John.”
“Are you still insisting on joining me, hunting the new Moriarty?” He asks as he sits opposite me.
Sherlock drew his knees up on his own chair, with John standing over him.
Sherlock had to reply; John would expect him to say something. His mind was seared blank but for the feeling of lips against his skin and the sound of those precious words from last night.
John moved away enough for Sherlock to sit up and throw off his t-shirt, wriggle out of his pyjama pants. Then he was pulled on top of John, mouths and torsos and erections and thighs pressing together.
John grinned, propping himself up enough to kiss his mouth, pushing fabric to bare his hip, pressing against his skin.
"Can I hold yours now?"
Even with his face turned most of the way into a pillow, John heard him murmur “thank you, John.”
John kisses him.
The cosy atmosphere makes him brave, or possibly stupid.
“Whatever works,” Sherlock replies, and takes a deep breath, bearing down a little to allow John to breach him.
"Yes it is!"
“I'll do it properly next time, love.” John planned on making every fantasy he'd had about them come true. Starting with: “I'll look after you right and kiss you a million times.”
"Obviously not."
“Ta,” Sherlock rumbles. John flexes his fingers and goes to rummage up some food.
“Bullshit,” John counters, smiling and tipping his head into the palm cupping his face. “You just like touching me. Don’t run away,” he continues. “I like touching you too.”
Sherlock’s eyes dance.
“No, it’s fine. This is - more than fine.” Sherlock’s hips were rutting up towards him. As he kissed his chest and hip he could feel him trembling. Nuzzling into his groin, John licked sloppy kisses up the underside of  Sherlock’s admittedly modest length and sucked at the head, probing his tongue at the slit and stroking him with his hand.
, John!"
“I know. I want to.” He rocked into him, mouthing at all the skin he could reach, running his hands over and over everywhere his lips couldn't.  Reaching around and under Sherlock, he followed Sherlock’s hand as he stroked himself.
Of course John notices the retracting arm immediately, but it takes him damnably long to deduce what it means. Then, as Sherlock wants him to keep going (doesn't he? He would've moved or said something otherwise) he continues, inching slightly higher. John’s a doctor and a crack shot, but he still takes his time lining up his move. He swallows. John’s hand darts out, further up Sherlock’s body, touching lightly on the back of his wrist. When they lock eyes, the hairs on the back of his neck prickle. No turning back.
He wanted to take longer, practicing embroidering the runes for hearing, but Sherlock loitered around him as he stitched the sigils, even bending over John’s chair to literally watch over his shoulder, often resting his chin on John’s shoulder and squashing one of his ears.
"Mm. Done?"
, John, you know what that's like, and seemed to put up with me enough to talk and make friends. It was her last semester, see, before she left work to have her little baby. I didn't know then, of course, what she'd be like with the boys, but I was just - how can academia lose this brilliant mind? What a crime. But her husband had a good job and she had a new focus."
When he thinks he might go mad with the teasingly slight contact, he enacts his plan. It’s not complex. Coming home from the clinic, he wanders around the living room to stand behind Sherlock as he sits in his chair.
“Mm? I’m good for pretty much anything, Sherlock.”
“I can kiss you when you’re done being brilliant.” She caught Sherlock’s eye, and Sherlock felt her cheeks heat at the intent in her gaze.
,” Sherlock panted. “I want more. Harder.”
“Yeah. You've no idea, love. Gonna blow your mind.”
Chuckling quietly, John gently lay Sherlock's new tail running up his back, and hunkered down to the business of closing up the small hole remaining below the base of it. He couldn't help but rest his fingers, wrist, or forearm on a plush arsecheek, and to be honest he didn't really try. Sherlock shifted a little.
"I'm an idiot."
"Are you going to stand there all night and watch me sleep?" he demands.
"Your turn now," he pants, pulling out and shuffling down the bed. Sherlock's erection strains upwards, and John guides the head into his mouth, as he slips two fingers into Sherlock, lube and come easing the way.
Sherlock glares at him. "Just pack your car."
“That was-” Grabbing Sherlock at the shoulders, he kissed him soundly. “That was bloody lovely. Can I… ? ” he snuck a hand under Sherlock’s t-shirt and trailed it down to the band of his pyjama pants.
Realisation comes slowly. The small touches are never inflicted upon him without some warning, and if John is honest with himself, they’re far from unwelcome.
“You like ‘em?” John asked blearily, still facing away from Sherlock.
“You were going to move out?”
"More. I - do you want more?"
John rolled his eyes and began to undress hurriedly.
Weeks later, when their quarry had a friend with a pistol and bad aim, John sided with Sherlock against Lestrade taking them to an A&E for the bullet graze under Sherlock’s left scapula, but quickly switched to arguing with him when they got home and Sherlock declared he would treat his own wound.
“Please, John,” he begged, and John pushed himself up with one arm to take in the vision under him. His free hand cupped Sherlock's flushed cheek, and Sherlock clasped that hand in his own, holding it there.
“Turn around, Sherlock.”
"I dunno, Sherlock, I've always had it. It feels like asking what it's like to have a hand, or a penis."
“I did,” Sherlock burst out. “You were barely conscious; it was clear you momentarily mistook me - a figure about to share a bed with you - for Mary. I apologise for replying as I did, I thought-”
It’s not until after he’s made himself come twice, laying gasping in the almost-satisfied reprieve between orgasm and repeated need, that he realises Sherlock might have been trying to offer to… John’s not sure. Sit in and observe his heat, if nothing else. Does he know John would be physically incapable of refraining from begging Sherlock to fuck him?
"I thought-"
"Sure."
“No. Stop. That’s the problem. You think I regret this. Don’t.”
Recognising she should be more involved, she pressed forward, and John smiled against her and pulled away.
"She's a good thinker, is your mum."
“Let’s get this over with, then; Sally might have an aneurysm if we take too long here.”
"You haven't done this for a while. I have faith that you'll figure it out."
His hands clench, tight, too tight, and John winces but does not pull away.
Sherlock took the hand offered to him and stood.
"It's not the same without you here.
“Mycroft told me about Serbia. And that after I - god, I attacked you and you just let me? Why would you - but you knew I was angry, knew how to let me get it out.”
Trim hips buck against his thigh.
“I… wasn’t sure what you’d want for breakfast?” Sherlock tries.
I turn to Mary. She’s as confused as me – or she’s at least pretending to be. My gaze flickers back to him.
“Idiot.”
She narrows her eyes at him, and he wonders how he has misstepped already.
, he texts Sherlock.
A while later, John gets  his revenge by gasping out his proposal while Sherlock rims him.
Sherlock grumbles wordlessly, and John laughs again.
“There’s no need,” Sherlock told him. “I’m quite satisfied. Although if you still feel the need for me to have my own tail, you may Make me one.”
"Oh," murmurs John.
it and start
“Yes.”
When it happened, then, he could
“Please, John.”
“Don’t feel like you have to hold back,” he said quietly.
“Mm.”
He tore his eyes away from Sherlock to glance at Peter, who chuckled and deftly squirted some more lubricant into his hand. When he started thrusting with some real force and stroking his cock as he did, Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut and bit his lip. Concerned, John found himself kneeling by the bed, entwining his hand with Sherlock’s.
The whole thing could have been sweet, creepy, or entirely void of emotion: perhaps Sherlock had merely been testing the camera’s settings and capabilities for future reference. He rubbed a hand over his face again. It could be anything.
Sherlock nodded, and John kissed his shoulder. His hand splayed on Sherlock’s flat belly, holding them together.
Soon after John set down a toasted sandwich by Sherlock, he heard him breathe deeply and turned in time to see him open his eyes.
“Mm, you don’t think sober John will agree with tipsy John?”
“Fucking gorgeous,” John repeats, his voice low. “I want to fuck you, here, now. Can I?”
, if you sod off to play ‘catch the murderer’ all by yourself, obviously I can’t fucking stop you. But I swear to
He thinks of Mary, and acknowledges the cold heaviness in his gut.
“I know, but-”
He offers a small smile, and it does seem to reassure John somewhat.
Sherlock grumbles under his breath.
"They're quite similar, aren't they, your parents?"
“Right. Just look after him, yeah?”
“You’re not… I don’t think you’re that drunk, John. What is it.”
“I wonder what he'll think of me... I guess he'll call me 'the old man'. I guess he'll think I can lick every other fella's father - well I can! I bet that he'll turn out to be the spittin' image of his dad, but he'll have more common sense than his puddin' headed father ever had… My boy Bill; I will see that he's named after me, I will. My boy Bill, he'll be tall and as tough as a tree, will Bill!”
Wriggling to find a better position, John grins.
Sherlock pushed himself up to stare at John's face.
“You’re an idiot?”
“Of course not.”
"No fight club, no cocaine, no cigarettes," John reminded him. "What is it, then?"
"Like it here," he grumbles.
“Like the Dread Pirate Roberts,” I realise.
“I can’t - I need
“I know,” came the reply, although it sounded quite muffled. Rolling his eyes, John paced towards Sherlock’s bedroom.
"And here's our two rascals," Will was saying to the camera. "Why don't you show me your new trick with Redbeard, Liam?"
“Christ, what was that?” John asked eventually. “I feel like that was payback for something, and I need to know what it was so I can do it more often.”
“What is it.”
“Yeah.” He shifted his fingers from inside Sherlock and hoped he was prepared enough. This time when John nudged at his hips, he obligingly rolled over, discarding his robe in the process, presenting his arse and clutching his pillows under his head.
“Ah. Alright.” He pushed, again, silky curls out of his way. Obviously he couldn’t shave it away from the area like he would with a patient made of flesh, and the strands coiled around his fingers as he set tiny neat stitches binding ear to scalp. When finished, he knotted the thread off and hid the end inside the seam. Leaning in closer, John could feel the tickle of hair against his jaw.
“You need a haircut,” John smiled.
