John could hear the water of the Thames slosh against the walls of his current shelter. He liked it, he started to get used to it and found it very calming - usually. Lying on his back now, hands folded on his slightly revolting stomach, he willed himself very much to fall asleep. But sleep didn't want to take over.
John's heart almost burst of joy when the expression on Sherlock's face changed, softened, relief took the place of suspicion. The crease on the top of his nose stayed though, which he now crinkled and said, "Cute, John?"
“You really are a fucking moron, John Watson!” Greg shook his head and slumbed angrily against the backrest. John had to agree, he probably was, but what did it matter anyway.
Suddenly the expression on Sherlock's face changed from mildly amused and annoyed to fierce and furious. He stepped forwards, narrowed his eyes.
He felt how agitated he became; the nails of his left hand scratching the wallpaper; the other hand resting on John's scared shoulder, his eyes wide.
“But, you know… that email. It was… it felt an awful lot like…,” he lowered his voice to give it a mock ironic touch “...’we-could-still-be-friends’...,” he tried to chuckle but the sadness in his eyes undermined all his efforts.
"What's Christmas-y about anatomically incorrect hearts and astronomically incorrect stars and botanically incorrect trees and… what are those?"
He took a deep breath and cautiously pressed the power button. As expected there was only one song available, he had uploaded it himself after all.
It was sticky. Slowly he woke, again, and tried to make sense of his surroundings. The surface he was lying on was sticky. And smelled bad. It was comfortable in a weird way, familiar, but it smelled horribly of everything a human body could release. He realised that he was covered by a rough and scratchy blanket, the smell a bit better if it could be called that. Less intense maybe.
“No, nothing.” Scott cleared his throat again, continuing much more composed. “And where were you heading to when you met your friend?”
Apparently Sherlock was a bit lost, didn't know what to make of it all. He frowned now deeply, looking at John quizzically.
“No, John,” Sherlock shook his head slowly, face still pensive. “That’s what I just tried to do... to tell you how important you are to me. I hoped that you might understand what you mean to me. It’s me who has to thank you. You’ve made me a better person, John. Who I am now. I am because of you!”
clear signs for hyperventilation. He was bordering a panic attack. If he didn’t interrupt it, he would risk a meltdown of some sort, which would leave him incapable of interacting with people. With John. He couldn’t risk that. He had to do something. There was only one other option.
occupied…" Sherlock said and kneaded John's arse cheek to strengthen his argument. Well, he did have a point there…
“This okay?” he murmured, scanning Sherlock’s face, almost losing himself in the depth of the emotions it showed.
“I couldn’t risk it, John. You don’t know what it would have meant for me…” he inhaled shakily. “You have no idea what
The sitting area became more and more crowded and there was some hustle around the stage. After a moment a low ting seemed to announce something, the music faded and the lights dimmed. All eyes turned to the stage and John had to admit that he too watched with some curious anticipation.
What he saw there almost did him in; Sherlock's face flushed, his already plush lips slightly swollen and bright red from their kissing, eyelids hanging low over dark and ravenous eyes, his hair a mess of tousled curls.
Sherlock's most important and special and precious feature, his brilliant mind, had left John lost for words; more of those wonderful mind blowing kisses were the only answer he had been able to think of.
“If you need another,” Molly nodded in the direction of the sheets, “just let me know, okay? I mean, they won’t change, John. Not even with a third check,” Molly looked compassionately at John.
Sherlock's gaze scanned over the neatly folded blanket on the chair which once had been John's, the unfamiliar detective story on the side table which certainly didn't belong to Sherlock's book collection, the carefully sorted slides next to the microscope now taking up most of the space on the living room table.
“Hey,” John said again, a bit louder, still gentle. No reaction. “Sherlock?” John leaned over the table to search Sherlock’s eyes. The only answer was a short grunt. “Come on, tell me what's on your mind, yeah? That’s why we are doing this, right?”
Holding her hand in place she started bending her knees and sliding down and further down in slow motion, her hand-cupped groin rubbing along the shiny dancing pole until she ended in a crouching position. Heightened by her heels it gave a free view under her skirt, suspenders straining along pale skin, stretched and ready to snap. The black lace of her panty just that sort of non-transparent that heightened the effort to catch a glimpse of forbidden territory underneath. But most of the desired sight was hidden behind a slender hand with spidery long fingers holding the Pirate's most delicate part.
“Don’t you worry, love.” he murmured against Sherlock’s lips. “Doctor John will take care of you.” He winked at the furiously blushing detective and slapped his backside gently. “Take some towels and go lie on the bed. I’ll be right back with you.” He instructed and marched off in the direction of the kitchen.
So he made use of the first moments of melody floating through the room, put on his best Fred Astaire imitation and, slowly sauntering, made his way around the table. If his hips were swaying more than necessary and the seduction-level in his gaze was Cary Grant worthy he knew he was laying it on thick, but the stunned and puzzled and a bit lost look in Sherlock's eyes was absolutely worth it.
“What do you want?” Sherlock asked defensively, distracting himself with collecting his stuff, avoiding eye contact.
"Afghanistan, by the way." he added, but a low hum on the other end of the line was his only reward. When the silence threatened to stretch for too long, John huffed, "Right. You’re not what I expected."
When he finally ran his palms quickly over Sherlock’s front to check for any missing spots, a low groan coming from the top of the mattress made him look up. The sight of Sherlock’s face, contorted in suppressed pleasure, made John cave in and yield to the urge to free the lower lip currently trapped by the teeth biting it. He surged up, his own body sliding in a wave of warm skin over Sherlock’s chilly torso. He pulled Sherlock’s swollen lower lip free with one thumb taking hold of the man’s chin and dove in for a kiss. The moan rumbling deep in Sherlock’s throat could as much have been caused by John’s passionate tongue pushing between his lips as by their equally straining erections sliding against each other due to John's move. The last remaining bit of foam on Sherlock’s freshly shaven skin made it slippery in a way that prevented any friction that might have felt uncomfortable.
promise though is that this fic will be finished. I just didn't take a pandemic holding the world hostage into account when I started posting this fic...
Even as the jealousy stung immensely John tried to convince himself that this shouldn't make a difference. Whatever was needed to protect Sherlock and whatever would make him happy was John's responsibility to ensure.
The boys will experience their very own rollercoaster ride. They will take you along, so fasten your seat belts and have fun! Off you pop... 😈😇🥰
John stopped and raised his head. He was well aware that Sherlock couldn't exactly sport fresh hickeys for this case; it hadn't been his intention anyway. He just enjoyed to silence that cocky mouth and to put his Posh Pirate into the pliable and pleading position once in a while.
“Yes, exactly.” Greg rumbled. “I know how Sherlock is. And that’s exactly why I know, that he’d never realise something like that on his own. With all that genius mind of his… he’s a big dumbass idiot!”
"I never missed them." John stated matter of fact. Sherlock's eyebrows raised. "As much as I might have longed for those dates because I thought I'd desperately need to get a leg over," he cleared his throat. This wasn't particularly familiar ground for them to talk about. But that needed to change anyway, didn't it? "Well, afterwards, when we were chasing one criminal or another? Or even during the most boring stake outs? Which you could have done perfectly well on your own by the way…" he raised one eyebrow at Sherlock who only shrugged as if to say "obviously". "Anyway, I never thought twice about them. I didn't actually need them. It took me a while, old habits and all that, but at some point I realised that it was enough. We were enough. I’d rather spend time with you than with some random woman."
He listened carefully to any noises coming from upstairs, trying to figure out John’s exact location in the flat; Sherlock didn’t feel any urge to run into him. He didn't feel like answering any questions about where he had been, let alone about his appearance. And knowing John he was certain to be pestered with an interrogation. John wouldn’t be able to resist, he never could.
he heard, pleading, asking, begging. Standing on a bridge, broken, closed off, raging waters running underneath.
The anticipation made him hasten even more, getting him slightly out of breath. At the same time, he already felt his mind quieting. But this wasn’t enough, not nearly enough. He had to get rid of all this useless and illogical nonsense to clear his mind and be able to think properly again.
It was when he nearly ran over a toddler in the aisle of the supermarket with his shopping trolley; distracted by a vain attempt to come up with a plausible argument to convince himself that it was a horrible idea after all to contact Scott again, while mindlessly throwing tinned tomatoes, frozen veg, pasta and rice into his trolley to fill up his stock as he couldn’t survive on the remains of takeaway alone; he decided that enough was enough.
"He is free to do as he wants to do. I don't care." Sherlock huffed, and it sounded much too sincere for John’s liking.
When the green charging dot finally lit up, John pushed the buttons to start his phone and rushed to the bathroom during the time it took until the system booted up properly. He at least needed to brush his teeth and comb his hair a bit.
"John," he drew his eyebrows together. "You said 'no more songs'?" Actually it was a fact but the confusion turned it into a question.
Sherlock looked sceptically at him. As if this was an alien concept to him. Probably it was. John wondered if Sherlock, at any point in his life, had had the chance to pick up proper problem solving skills that had nothing to do with murder. Not that he himself was exactly an expert on that front, but he
John chanted and pleaded in his head. John had to make a beeline around chairs and tables blocking his way. He had to hurry, at the same time he had to be careful—apparently, the other man as well as his bulky mayflies hadn’t noticed him yet thanks to the shadows; he couldn’t screw this up now. He was so close.
"He mustn't be further compromised. This time it's different. I agreed with him on clarity. It will all settle and he'll move on. He did before. He will again." Sherlock turned back into his former position and tried to ignore Mycroft to the best of his abilities. It wasn't easy.
In the back of the cab Sherlock was unusually quiet. He kept staring out of his window and only answered in one-syllables to John’s admittedly forced chatter. John was a bit nervous about what to expect and Sherlock’s silence wasn’t exactly helpful. Also, the cabby threw them suspicious glances through the rear mirror. Strangely though, it wasn’t Sherlock, all dressed up, who was eyed the most, but John who felt as if the man kept an eye on him.
. That’s what it’s like between human beings. You can’t avoid that. Important thing is though, not to give up because of that. Because we might hurt each other, but we can talk it out, make up again. And then we keep enjoying our time together, yeah? Most likely we'll even be better afterwards. I think there’d be much more enjoying than hurting each other. Because if that’s what we both want, we can make it work! Just not run if it gets bumpy.”
Hidden underneath that indecent, tempting and very feminine leather skirt was a rock hard cock pressed against his groin, grinding through the layers of fabric, through worn denim and thin lace.
All the possibilities whirling in his head and making him a bit weary, he suddenly remembered the incoming texts of the morning. Maybe they would explain something?
Thinking of his silly little souvenirs he used to carry in his pockets... Sherlock’s broken magnifying glass he had gotten back when he was handed Sherlock’s personal belongings after he… he was… God, he couldn’t even think about it . Or that bee Sherlock once found on the pavement and which he preserved in synthetic resin… a little laugh escaped him at the memory of Sherlock’s delight at the pollen which had still been visible at the bee’s legs.
However, before Sherlock was given any chance to react to it, John had rested both his hands on Sherlock's shoulders, put on a mirthful smirk and started to sway in sync to the music again. He swung his hips, tapped his feet in the worst possible impression of college times slow dance. Sherlock had always found them tedious and uncomfortable; in much too close proximity to too many idiots. He had tried to avoid those at all costs; somehow
"What do you mean… asking for a friend? What friend?" Sherlock's brows were drawn in concern and confusion.
It contradicted everything he thought to know. It was the exact opposite of what he had expected. And still, somehow, it was everything he needed to hear. Somehow it weighed more than all lectures of his brother ever had, more than all the berating of Mrs Hudson, all the scolding of Lestrade. Because it was Molly. Quiet, cautious, insecure, lovely and loving Molly.
He was reading it for the hundredth time when the friendly hand on his shoulder made John jump. He slammed his laptop shut with much more force than necessary.
"Fine! I'm fine!" Sherlock hissed irritated. "Why wouldn't I be fine?" He glared at his brother, who didn't bat an eyelid at Sherlock's anger. Mycroft held his gaze, kept on eating, absolutely unaffected, which only spiked Sherlock's irritation.
? They had been colleagues, they had been partners even if only in a professional way, they had been best friends; Sherlock had even been a best man for John - although he didn’t like to think about that part! But... when John said friend, did he mean
John wasn’t sure if it was part of Sherlock’s routine not to move or if time had just conveniently stopped. Actually he didn’t care. All he did care about was that he had opportunity enough to revel in the sight of the gorgeous creature in front of him on stage; dimly lit by orange spotlight on the one side and a green one on the other; the colours alternatingly fading in and out, creating a transcendent and surreal air around Miss Pirate whose purple dress was oddly accentuated by the light. As if it was popping out, a hologram. John was almost tempted to reach out with his hand to see if Miss Pirate was physical or just a projected image. The fog suddenly wavering around her ankles didn’t help one bit to let the ethereal creature appear any more real. She was the adored heroine out of his most fantastic dream; a dream that had become his life.
An earthy, warm, exclusive scent, a hint of fresh sweat underneath. An intoxicating mix, dark and mysterious.
He vaguely remembered to also buy a battery pack because he had left his one at Baker Street and he couldn't exactly go back there; charging it at an internet cafe, sipping on an unbelievably awful cup of coffee for what felt like hours, served in an out of date and stained mug. Sip by sip, long gone cold, he couldn't care less. The eyes of the shop owner had followed him suspiciously when he had left, in his woolen coat much too warm for this weather, collar turned up and headphones in place to shield himself from the world. He dimly recalled that he had been reasonably clear at that time.
Sherlock had to sit down. It was the kitchen chair he landed on. Hard. No idea how he had gotten there. He breathed in. Out. In. Out.
"You're regretting it. You regretted it every single day. You're ashamed and you feel guilty." Sherlock said, convinced. "I'm quite certain he never did."
God, he needed to stop drooling over a custom dancer, stripper, whatever girl this was. It had come far with him if this was the fulfillment of his wildest dreams. Wasn’t it ridiculous actually? What a cheap tactic to gain the attention of desperate men.
“That’s what I was hoping for…” Sherlock purred, pushing himself up and cupping the back of John’s head to pull him in for a kiss. John couldn’t resist to follow when Sherlock lay back down. He leaned over him to chase his kiss. Suddenly, Sherlock jerked his own legs up, practically curling in on himself without losing the contact to John’s lips, he hooked his big toes under the waistband to yank down John’s pants.
"You’re a Doctor who owns a white coat and a stethoscope, aren’t you?" Sherlock purred into John's ear. "You’re also an army Captain who kept his old fatigues and dog tags." Sherlock straightened and looked into John's eyes, suddenly much more serious. His voice low and soft when he said, “I have all I need, I couldn't possibly wish for more."
“Never again, John.” Sherlock whispered, wrapping himself in a towel, pressing his still damp lips on John’s. “Thank you.”
thank you all for liking my drunk John so much! It brings me so much joy to know that he made you laugh and root for him.
Over the cheery tune in the background, absolutely contradicting anything Sherlock might or might not feel right now, Jenny offered some final words.
But the only thing coming from Mycroft was a silent "Sherlock" and that was even worse. Sherlock growled, dropped his chin to his chest and shook his head.
John felt caught out. Hadn't he himself thought Sherlock to be a woman until that eye-opening lap dance? As if he had read John's thoughts, Sherlock grinned fiendishly.
John thought he'd die of suffocation due to excessive laughter. His abs started to hurt and he ended up having a hick up.
After Sherlock’s dance, after he had laid his heart bare, John had been sure that it had been Sherlock’s feeling of guilt and the need for atonement that had to be soothed.
“Cold?” he asked, but Sherlock only studied him intently with night-sky-eyes and faintly shook his head ‘no’.
“Anything beyond this will be his own responsibility I guess, because I don’t regard you as the most suitable person to make choices of a partner for a romantic relationship for him. We all know what it led to the last time you tried to walk that path. Not your most glorious moment … brother dear!” Sherlock snarled.
John shifted on his feet, a bit uncomfortable. Should he have seen it? Should he have realised? Wait. Stop… Why for fucks sake would Moriarty have assumed that… ? John didn't like that! And a loaded gun? In Sherlock's pants? He didn't like that either! Well, not in
He sat the tumbler back down and raised his eyes again and with that John knew, he wasn't off the hook.
"Oh, nothing, love. Forget it." John felt his own cheeks redden a bit and hurried to crawl out of bed and get under the shower.
"I... don't know…" a rough, dark, hoarse voice mumbled in his ear after a moment. "I guess, I was angry."
"Whatever it needs to get your approval, Captain." Scott's voice dropped even deeper, reminding John of the growl of a thunderstorm on the horizon. It even gave off the same electrical charge, making the air around him crackle. “Maybe you should come back and check on the progress yourself.”
Relieved by the change of mood, John grinned. He released Sherlock's dressing gown in favor of sliding his fingers into the most glorious curls on the entire planet. Who was he kidding, in the entire universe!
He must have forgotten it. Of course he had. After all, he didn't even remember when he had stopped dancing.
Sherlock snorted resigned. “As if…” he muttered under his breath and hoped that it would stay unrecognised.
"No, Sherlock. What drugs? After the…" he swallowed, "wedding? We sorted that. It's as long ago as Mary and I told you… Sherlock, I don't care! That was then, this is now."
“Yep.” John popped the P like Sherlock loved to do and felt a pleasant and at the same time painful tug in his gut at that reminder.
“Yeah, whatever, you loony,” John laughed. “I didn’t understand a single word, but I fully agree. It’s about time. Almost at the flat though… bus is already coming.”
This however had been something different altogether and left him rattled. Even though he finally acknowledged, finally knew, how deep is affection - his
He knew the place by now. He even recognised it in the blurry black and white of the CCTV camera. Without looking away he addressed Mycroft again: “That's how you knew that I'd been there.”
“I look ridiculous.” Was what came out of his mouth, because he couldn’t quite find words to react to the ethereal being in front of him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. It was even worse than he had expected. Sherlock already grieved all the innocent brain cells dying right this moment.
A silence fell. John’s mind drifted off, imagining the man being here with him, wishing for nothing more than to finally put a face to that voice. And also a body if we’re at it…
“The life I lived before I met you, was never my own.” He had to clear his throat. This wasn’t going to be easy. “Even looking back I don’t know which choices were my own and which were just me meeting the expectations I thought were demanded of me. I wanted to make my parents proud, it was about the only way to gain some affection, you know,” Sherlock’s hand settled over his own which was still resting on Sherlock’s thigh. “So the army it was, which was okay because I felt like doing something useful. And guns… yeah, I liked guns to be honest.” Sherlock raised one eyebrow and regarded him smugly. John threw him a ‘you’re one to talk’-stare back and Sherlock sheepishly avoided his gaze.
"Don't know about her ability to judge facial hair growth beyond her own." Sherlock's winked, his eyes glinted with glee. John loved to see him this uninhibited. "And anyway, John. A single set of data isn't in any way scientific enough to call it a proper result."
But this wasn’t the problem now. He couldn't care less about John's preferences as his only concern and focus had to be how to stop this and to figure out what 'this' was and why 'this' happened at all! Probably it had to do with the song itself in some way! It must have if John was listening to the same song over and over again!
contain that particular word, it just wasn’t my primary choice to describe your reproductive organ.” The man said snootily, apparently very sure of himself. John however burst into another fit of laughter.
He had never heard Greg call Molly by this nickname. But then, he hadn't seen them lately. Not together at least. He had avoided their early-love-infatuation. He kept telling himself that he wanted to give them space, but in all honesty… he couldn't stand it. He looked around, took in the situation and realised
He pulled the curtain to one side and his eyes frantically searched the street only to see John still oscillating on the pavement in front of the door - approaching, turning away only to falter the next moment and turn back again. Once he even reached for the knocker -
“Your long legs then...” John steered them back to their actual topic, “...care if I ran my hands over them as well? Or my mouth…?”
Quickly estimating his chances to move into any close proximity to tissues without making a big mess of everything, he sighed and had to admit defeat. One handedly, he pulled his pants up, unbuttoned his shirt and finally discarded it only to immediately use it as a tissue stand-in. Rest in peace poor old Marks & Spencer-sale-shirt, you lived a simple but honest life and now died a heroic death.
He was very aware of the warm, lean and very male body he was holding; all bone and muscle, no padding to soften the edges. Taller than him, he had to look up. And he didn’t mind one bit. He was always looking up to Sherlock anyway, so…
The moment the music faded and Sherlock stopped, standing there absolutely still, steady, confident, strong, breathing heavily, John faltered, already one foot into the room.
Now desperate, he walked forward until entering the open central space of the building. And at the sight he faced there he felt something shatter inside him.
Sherlock did as he was told and when John entered the bedroom he was blessed with the sight of the lean muscled body of his gorgeous boyfriend splayed out on his back over the towel covered mattress.
“Don’t make the same mistake again, Sherlock.” she had added firmly. Sherlock had winced, tried to pull back his hand, but Mrs Hudson had only held it even tighter in her strong grip. She had squeezed his hand, searched for his gaze. When he had finally raised his eyes to meet hers, he had been overwhelmed by the amount of affection they held.
“Yeah, right, it never is…” With a disdainful glare she scanned him from top to toe before she hooked her arm with Sherlock’s and pulled him along. “Come on, love, you’re late. Time to prepare yourself.”
“He's been doing this for hours now, John,” came the quiet voice of Mycroft from much closer by than John had expected. A brief tentative squeeze of his shoulder. This unexpected and unusual gesture made it even worse.
Okay, granted, Sherlock had to admit, the question hadn't been very precise. He would remember, but not all of it.
John rubbed his neck. God, his head was killing him. He looked forward to a glorious breakfast of preferably a bucket of coffee, black no milk, toast with nothing and a whole pack of paracetamol.
As was to be expected Sherlock didn’t give in and tried to appear as unaffected by John’s reaction as possible. When the day went by and Sherlock not so much as mentioned the events in the morning again, John lowered the newspaper he was reading and turned to Sherlock who was sulking on the sofa.
“He’s my…” Sherlock hesitated, looked at John, estimating, apparently unable to judge his mood. Good, because John didn’t even know what mood he was in himself. “He’s my… John.”  Sherlock settled for.
A sincere and warm and affectionate smile spread on John’s face. Not exactly the reaction Sherlock had expected.
His heart threatening to jump right out of his chest he held the envelope and looked at Mycroft, let him see, let him know. He needed the man to understand what this meant to him. When Mycroft gave him a small nod he knew the message was received.
"I'll show you sappy," he murmured, reaching up, pulling Sherlock down. Sherlock's thumb brushed over John's cheek, wiping away the tear, before they melted together in a kiss—unburdened, unhurried, carrying the certainty that they had all the time in the world.
"Seriously?" John couldn't believe his ears but followed lead anyway. Wow, what a relief, his cock had strained the front of his pants more than he had been aware of. How could he be this aroused already?
He exhaled sharply, turned away from the door and leaned against the rough wall in the grimy back alley, annoyingly lit by cheap red spots. He closed his eyes to block it all out—the alley, the lights, the noise and smell, the memories, the emotions.
and all you order are cans, instant and ready-to-eat food? Not to forget the fuckload of biscuits of course.”
This meant John hadn’t forgiven him at all. He was still angry at Sherlock. He wasn’t happy, and it was all Sherlock’s fault. There was always something. He should have realised. Stuck in his own mind, strained to detach himself from any distracting thought, he hadn't. He hadn't seen it for what it was. He had missed it, he had failed John. Again!
Neither of them moved, the moment frozen in time. When finally, Sherlock took in a shuddering breath, John woke from his trance. Sherlock lingered a moment. A warm thumb stroked lightly like a feather over Johns knuckles and with that the detective let go of John's hand, turned and hurried away. His long coat billowing behind him. Curls in disarray where the cold breeze tore at them.
Sherlock's frown deepened and John laughed again his beautiful spontaneous and sincere laugh where he threw his head back, pinched his eyes. Sherlock drank in the sight, felt it settle deep within a brand new wing of his mind palace; he would never get enough of it.
to understand them and to believe it. John was sure he did; however, apparently they still hadn't really sunk in. Why was Sherlock still so insecure about them, about what lay ahead of them, about what John knew they could become?
“What else would you want to call me then?” John smirked. He knew he was teasing. Scott however apparently didn’t.
"Well, you said sofa and there're no blankets. Mrs Hudson took them. To clean them or something equally tedious."
John plumped down in his chair, feeling ridiculous in his pants alone, but was far too worked up to do anything about it. He was tortured for the better part of an hour by shouting and cursing and swearing coming from the bathroom until it was finally quiet again. The sound of traipsing bare feet made him turn and look over his shoulder.
that could possibly come between them. It felt warm and cosy and stable—almost domestic, almost boring; but then nothing was ever boring with Sherlock Holmes. Yet, the nights were filled with excitement, thrill, danger, lust and want and temptation, and a sizzling tension crackling in the air bearing the risk to be set off and explode by the snap of a finger. It was like a drug, making them feel alive and flying high. It was addictive. At the same time it left them vulnerable and fragile, bruised and unstable. It was as if they lived in two different universes at the same time—hopping between them as if cursed by a spell, transforming at night, like a wicked inverse version of “Beauty and The Beast”.
What shook him awake though, was Miss Pirate leaving the stage during her performances to join the more than pleased audience. It started out innocently with long spider-web-covered legs dangling over the edge of the stage, Miss Pirate in a perfect school-girl manner pouting her perfect lower lip and, by doing so, drawing all the greedy eyes to it. At this point, John was pretty amused by the way Miss Pirate played her spectators. They were fully at her mercy and oh, didn't he know what that felt like… He was a bit less amused when her beautiful bum lifted off the stage and she started sauntering through the rows of chairs and tables, leaving a trace of drooling men in her wake. What wiped out his humour completely though were the touches. A traced jawline, an arm slung around a shoulder, a high-heeled foot sliding up a calf. In the end, it was pretty much the opposite of humour John felt, when the touches were rewarded—in more ways than John would have liked. Who was he kidding though, there was not a single way he'd find bearable Miss Pirate’s touches to be reciprocated. They shouldn't happen in the first place! But the banknotes, suggestively tucked under straining suspenders, into the seam of delicate stockings… into the waistband of fucking far too sexy lace panties, which were supposed to be fucking hidden under a skirt? God damnit! There was a limit to what he could be expected to stomach before losing his manners. Bloody hell!
There had been only one antidote to that kind of torture, and Sherlock had known it. There had been no way he could have stayed dead. No way he could have lived a life without John Watson at his side. Not after he'd had a taste of what it felt like to be such a great man’s best friend.
He had expected it at some point. It had all been too good to be true. He ended the call with Greg and waited for the return of his most probably disgruntled partner.
"The metrics, John. You're emphasising the lyrics in the wrong way which messes up the entire melody and rhythm of the Carol."
He was exhausted. Drained. He could feel it in every bone, every muscle, every nerve. But he couldn't stop. Because if he'd stop he had to face whatever would come afterwards. So he kept going, depending solely on muscle memory
Sherlock startled when she slapped him on the shoulder. Somehow Mrs Hudson had appeared out of thin air next to him.
“I’d prefer something much more... beer-y.” Greg interrupted his musings, already rummaging in the fridge. “Like… for example…,” his head popped up from behind the fridge door, a triumphant smile on his face, “Beer!” He held up two bottles clasped in one hand.
When he let himself fall back into the music, able to experience it inside and out, he felt himself calm down, centred, grounded. This was good. This would help him to keep his composure. Perhaps this could even help him to say what needed to be said.
He was so deep in thought and so absorbed in the content (the hotson person was right—the military stuff was quite… uhm… nice), that he was startled by a new incoming message. He frowned. Another answer? Why would they bother with that? Shrugging he opened his inbox anyway—and almost had a heart attack.
How was Sherlock supposed to go on living afterwards. But hadn’t that been the whole point of Moriarty's cruel game?
John was speechless, not that he would have known what to say anyway. How could this be the same man?
Molly left and Sherlock needed a moment to collect himself. He would never have expected Molly to be the one to shake him. He didn't even understand why exactly it was. Perhaps because she had always silently endured what Sherlock had thrown her way, never spoken up
The last thing Sherlock felt before darkness took over were strong arms closing around him. Holding him firmly.
"Okay. Calm down, drama queen. I'll think of something!" John laughed and engulfed his fuzzy and ruffled boyfriend in a tight embrace.
“Instead of talking? Well… don’t know what the two of us would get out of it though. I can't exactly rip your jacket off, can I now?” John huffed.
“Well then, thank you for calling ‘Our Nasty Bisexual Phone Sex Girls’. We hope you enjoyed the call and that you’ll get in contact again soon.” Scott rattled off all businesslike, but then added in that sultry velvety voice of his, “Hopefully the experience has been...satisfying for you. Or will be...” he purred and John swallowed hard. “It certainly was...my pleasure. I wish you sweet dreams,
“Off you go then,” John said, his heart skipping a beat at the vulnerability Sherlock allowed him to see. “I’ll be with you in a heartbeat…”
“I know, mate! I’m happy for you! I really am! But… you know… he won't care about your clothes, I think…”
“As I said…,” berating look at John, “... the lemon method first. In the beginning I used the juice of the adviced three lemons…”
"You're new here," the man said, eyeing John assessingly. "Who are you?" he asked with unhidden suspicion and disdain.
Well, that didn't help any further though. There was no background information as to why John couldn't sleep. In his current state, did he even know why?
His phone stayed quiet, Sherlock calmed down, trying to come to terms with this fact. The quietness was heavy, weighed down all other thoughts, pushed him into his mind palace. He sorted, stored away, kept safe, threw away, got it back, saved it still. When it was time for dinner, Sherlock joined his brother with much more composure. Mycroft acknowledged it with a minuscule nod and dinner was served. Mycroft asked if Sherlock wanted to know about the progress of the proceedings, but Sherlock didn't want progress, he wanted results. He told his brother that, as long as there was no date to leave, he didn't want to know anything. He wanted a clean cut, not some kind of merging one life into the other. How could he be certain that the new him wouldn't pull along the old him if they were holding hands in the meantime.
"You have seen me only mere hours ago. And the only thing I've done is trying to merge in with the furniture in your guest room!" Sherlock snarled. "What's the point of that question?"
“It’s okay, Molly. I know you didn’t! And anyway… can’t be helped now, right?” He shrugged. “It’s just… I didn’t expect anyone to listen in. It’s not something one would expect me to do, right? Well, not usually…” He raised his hands in a helpless gesture. “But desperate times and so on…”
“Sherlock, listen… Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to find something to scare me away?” A deep crease formed on his forehead. “I won’t, okay? I won’t leave. I won’t run to Greg, crying. I won’t run from idiots calling me names.” He shook his head slowly; a man out of his depth. “What are you afraid of? What kind of man do you think I am, Sherlock? Why would you think I’d leave?”
"How can it be? Our entire lives follow the principle of cause and effect. 'Because' is not a valuable cause."
At home, Sherlock dumped all his new treasures on the kitchen table and eyed them happily. He picked at them, fished some out and whirled around.
Now we have to tend to our own asks again considering they seem to have piled up for unknown reasons.
John leaned heavy on the edge of the sink and stared into the mirror. He looked at himself; his tired eyes with deep shadows and tear sacs underneath, his tanned but nonetheless ashen skin colour, his sandy-gray hair in a hideous non-style haircut.
“Oh God, stop it…” Suddenly John’s memory was full on back and he wanted to go up in flames from embarrassment. “Sherlock, I…” but Sherlock went on without taking a break.
“No, that was about something different. That was about you weighing my past, contemplating if it’d make a difference for you.”
“But you just shaved, didn’t you?” John was not in the mood for nonsensical discussions before coffee.
Bad enough that he was back home - whatever that meant - and cut off from all the things that really mattered to him; no longer on service in the army, no career as surgeon to go for, no family he could rely on, let alone any friends.
“Probably not, no.” John huffed, too wound up and breathless to manage a laugh, at the same time freeing his desperate cock, sighing with relief when the pressure finally eased a bit.
are the one shaving twice a day because you can’t stand the itch of stubble and the feeling of your chin catching on your scarf. Mister Sensitive-skin-all-labels-must-be-removed-or-I-wear-my-shirts-inside-out.”
Surely now John had to be satisfied. As this was probably his goal after all. Sherlock would never give in to this game, that much was certain!
The trauma was most likely related to that part of John's past. There was a high probability that he would have at least partly deleted those circumstances.
The first thing he realised the moment he surfaced from his fugue was music blaring in his ears. Vaguely he remembered snapping at an employee to already sell him these goddamn headphones. He had needed them. Desperately. He couldn't stand the outside world any longer, but his inside world even less. Nowhere to hide, all boltholes out of a different time. The time of the game. The time of John. He wouldn't find any peace there.
that most of the Queens aren't trans women and the men performing drag aren't necessarily gay, they nonetheless indulge in a kink they'd never confess openly, most likely not even to themselves. Most of them see but do not observe. The eye sees what the mind wants to see. And erases every detail interfering with that image."
“Darling?” He wasn’t exactly sure though where the snarl had come from with which it escaped his mouth.
His hands shaking from barely manageable self-restraint, he hammered his fingertips on the screen to dial a by now well known number. When he only got transferred to the voicemail, he would have loved to throw his phone across the room. He briefly closed his eyes, took a deep breath. And started to type.
Basic facts about life support wouldn't be too challenging for the beginning. He could still provide more advanced knowledge later on in the process.
The scrunch of gravel under approaching footsteps startled him. His eyes snapped open and he turned, filled with hope. Sherlock? Did he follow him? But the moment he caught sight of the person walking up to him, his guts turned and his stomach dropped.
He didn’t know if he should laugh or cry as he realised that Miss Pirate was slinking her way in his direction, swaying her hips provokingly with each stride. But he was frozen in place so he did neither, apart from sinking a bit deeper into his chair.
He felt Sherlock lean even more against him, his body heat only barely filtered through the thin fabric of John’s shirt; especially where the vest Sherlock wore didn’t cover his chest and where his bare arms were touching John’s sides, holding John’s wrists in a tight grip against the small of his back.
“Then what?” John asked, puzzled. It was true, John hadn’t seen the chemist in action since that memorable Bad Hair Day.
! One could also fall in love, although that was mostly hurtful in itself. Falling. The fall. Following him everywhere. In the end, he was always coming back to it in his mind. Like the never-ending circle of the come and go of the seasons, year after year inevitably withstanding the storms of autumn... of the fall. No escape.
Sherlock was sure about the fact that John would never turn off the message alert out of fear to miss anything important, for example Harry relapsing or hedging to cover someone else's sick leave at the surgery.
Just a moment later he was back in the kitchen and rummaged in the drawers and the book shelves searching for the battery pack he used to use when Sherlock and he had been out on cases, when they had expected it to be a long one.
Sherlock was disappointed that he had missed John and relieved at the same time. Not sure if he would have been able to face John but was craving it nonetheless.
Mycroft was apparently out already, because Sherlock didn't see him come or go. Nor did he see anyone else. He just waited. As the good little brother he was not. As the coward he definitely was. As the person he wouldn't be for much longer.
Somehow, he had the feeling of being close to Sherlock here. He imagined still feeling his presence in the shivers of light dancing through the dust. This place was important to Sherlock. So now, it was also important to John. Thinking back filled him with gratitude and sorrow. Also with admiration, awe. Love. He still marveled at the pictures in his head, Sherlock’s lean figure filling the room with his presence, owning it, reigning it. John allowed himself to feel the ache of loss of something he never had. Now, he could address his desire to be close to Sherlock, to take care of him. Now, he could acknowledge the moments of hesitation when Sherlock had fallen asleep on the sofa and John had spread a blanket over him, hand lingering on his shoulder, an irrational urge to stroke his fingers through the curls covering Sherlock’s forehead. Not irrational at all, it seemed. Well, surely irrational in Sherlock’s interpretation of the word. But wholly understandable for John now. What would he give to get such an opportunity again? Would he do it? Just give in? Cross this line? What about Sherlock’s bedroom door, occasionally left ajar? Although Sherlock had never said a word about it during their time living together, John now wondered if it had possibly been an invitation. Or was it only John's imagination going wild to wish it to have been an invitation? With the exception of danger nights, John had never actively or intentionally infringed Sherlock's privacy or personal space. But what if he would have? Should he have done it? Give in to his desire? Just walk up to that door, push it open and… Yeah, what then?
“Everything alright, dear? You look a bit… well…” she trailed off, probably not quite able to conceive all the emotions showing on John’s face. When he stayed silent she added: “Where’s Sherlock? Is he with you?”
He couldn’t stand this any longer! This was… it was too much. Miss Pirate had taken it too far this time. What he hated most was the way he was equally disgusted and turned on by the picture Miss Pirate presented. He could literally feel her in his own lap, his growing erection evidence of the intensity of those memories; however, they were only the ghosts of what the other guy had literally and metaphorically at hand right this moment.
He stood there in the middle of his room, frozen in place, when a cautious “Whoo-hoo!” and a hesitant knock at his door interrupted him.
He felt his own cock thicken even more and an answering twitch from underneath layers of black leather and lace.
She lifted the cord holding them with one delicate finger, running it down the chain while making sure she was still gliding across his skin. It made the tags rattle and he could feel more than hear the ragged breath she was taking in.
John closed his eyes and tilted his head, brushing his ear and cheek over Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder. He tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hips and felt Sherlock’s hands squeeze in response. A silent conversation. ...
Everything seemed to be odd, more forced, as if Sherlock was keeping himself at bay, shutting John out.
You? John felt the ridiculous nervousness of being addressed. He felt his heart beat, could hear it thumping.
didn't count as waiting. And he had taken a shower. Also not waiting. Maybe he had also had some tea with Mrs Hudson? Not sure. He couldn't remember. That wouldn't be considered waiting either, would it? Which actually didn't matter because he
“Why?” his brat of a partner dared to scrutinise his instructions, looking over his shoulder with a blush on his cheekbones and heavy lidded eyes.
The shirt buttons finally freed, it got hurriedly ripped open and his vest tugged up to have access to naked skin, naked nipples. The rib cage underneath his hands was rapidly undulating, lifting and falling, and he felt the ragged breath rasping his throat and burning his lungs. A whiff of air sneaking underneath the blanket wavered over his naked torso. He rubbed the palm of one hand over the plain of his upper body to chase away the chill, leaving traces of goosebumps in its wake, setting his skin on fire. Underneath his palm he felt tiny twitches of abdomen muscles and the tickle of the more bristly hair just above the waistband. When his marginal pubic hairs caught in the calluses of the exploring hand and sent the tug and prickle through every fibre of his nervous system, involuntarily the other hand fiercely pinched the nipple it was teasing.
He examined himself in the mirror for a long while. The man looking back at him was nothing like the jumper wearing worn out army doctor he had been half an hour ago. He looked… good, admittedly. But it didn’t feel like him. A flicker of insecurity slithered into the narrow gap between approval and dismissal battling inside his mind; is this what Sherlock would like him to look like? Is this the John Watson he’d rather want to look at?
John choked slightly, pulled back. His brain supplied with fresh oxygen, he janked the trimmer away from Sherlock’s skin, alarmed he might accidentally hurt him in their uncontrolled movements. He jolted when he suddenly felt one of Sherlock’s hands grabbing his hair in a tight fist.
He was deep in thought. He was missing something. Something elementary. He recalled and went through the whole conversation again. The phone call as well as the text messages. Where did he go wrong? It must have to do with John's question about saving lives, because it was odd. Even odder than the rest. It stuck out and Sherlock picked up on it immediately. One could call it an intuition. And intuitions are not to be ignored. They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend. There had to be
The smirk froze on his lips though, when Miss Pirate’s head snapped forward, dark curls, much more untamed and wild than usual, bouncing around her face and hanging low in her eyes, which immediately locked with John’s. He swallowed hard, he hadn’t expected it. He had been prepared to watch from the sidelines, but was more than pleased to obviously take part in what Miss Pirate had thought up. Oh, yes… pleased didn’t even come close to what he was. Not only his mind but also his body, very particular parts of his body, approved very very much of this unsuspected development. Bar stools were really not made for Miss-Pirate-watching he decided and cursed to have missed out on one of the comfy sofas. And Miss Pirate’s performance had only just begun… God gracious, he hoped the fabric of these trousers was stretchy enough...
"Sherlock?" Mycroft's voice woke Sherlock from his trance. Immediately, Sherlock spun on his heels. The look on his face switched from pained to furious in a flash.
Staring at Mary he had hissed through his teeth: “Leave Mary, or whoever the fucking hell you are! Leave and never come back. Or you’ll regret it!”
Eventually, John's softened cock slipped out of Sherlock, a bit of semen escaping Sherlock’s entrance in its wake. They quickly grabbed some tissues from the secret stack behind the pillow to prevent more leaking and dripping.
That aside, it gave him the opportunity to watch Sherlock without restraint. This way he was able to enjoy the lines of the slim silhouette against the incoming morning light. The soft sway, the wafting of burgundy dressing gown. He could make out a white dress shirt underneath and was thrown back to the last time he had seen Sherlock in such a shirt, in admittedly a slightly different state and frankly considerably less clothed. Here, like this though, he wasn’t any less… well… beautiful. The contrast of the white of the shirt and the red of the gown to the black of the trouser legs peeking out from under it and the dark mob of curls on the other end was striking, as if deliberately arranged. Bathed in light, the tips of said curls formed a glowing halo around Sherlock’s head, made him look like a piece of fine art. John couldn’t suppress the little gasp escaping his mouth. Also, he didn’t want to, he had nothing to hide.
John refused to react to any of this, too tired of all that, too confused at the moment. He tried to shut the cabby down by glaring at him, clenching his jaw and hissing at him: “If you’re not bloody going RIGHT NOW, I’ll make you see some ghosts yourself,
Sherlock opened the back door of the vehicle, checked quickly if he would be accompanied by his big brother, but when he found the back seat empty he was relieved. He’d rather delay this conversation, if only a bit. As long as he hadn’t spoken to Mycroft it wouldn’t be definite, even though Sherlock knew he wouldn’t back down… not this time.
She eyed John for a moment, scanning him, trying to figure him out. John raised his chin, trying to look nonchalant and fully in control of the situation; when actually he was completely out of his depth.
Without his doing he got pulled along and felt himself move together with John. The way a happy gleam evolved on John's features was worth all the awkwardness he might still feel. Apparently completely relaxed now John silently accompanied the slightly rough voice of the singer with his own untrained but all the more passionate one.
John almost giddily watched the transformation Sherlock had made from the sobbing man in his arms on the kitchen floor at Baker Street to the man he was holding now, confident and composed, relaxed and open
John watched mesmerized, as the circles Miss Pirate drew with her hips took hold of her entire body; like waves undulating through the lean form, rolling down her spine from neck to heels balancing on those needle thin rods John actually didn’t trust to be stable enough. To make matters worse, Miss Pirate now lowered her upper body, seductively slowly sliding her long fingered hands down her legs until she was practically folded in half. Ahhh, yes, Miss Pirate was very flexible. John smirked. That had come in handy more than once during the last year. Her hat dropped to the stage and she made a show to lean over even more to grab it, bending one knee, stretching the other lean leg to her side. John could imagine the wink she gave the audience with her long whimpered firefly eyes when she picked the hat up again. What he hadn’t expected was Miss Pirate shaking her head and making her curls bounce and fly before she suddenly snapped her head back up, threw her hair backwards and without doubt fixed her audience with one of those piercing gazes that set all your cells on fire. John’s problem though weren’t the curls, but the snap of her hips that simultaneously to her curls flying backwards made her skirt bounce forward to land on the small of her back.
"Very." Was Mycroft's cold and unwaveringly serious answer. The brothers held their gazes for a tense moment, before Sherlock huffed and looked away.
"No, you'd better not." John whispered, looking up at Sherlock who had reached him by now. He towered over him, tilting his head and watching him as if contemplating something.
He wanted to ignore the bathroom on his way to the kitchen, but his bladder told him otherwise. So he gave in and made it through a quick morning routine even if it probably was around lunch time already.
“Uh… yes. St Bartholomew’s? The hospital, you know?” John frowned. Someone who knew the map of the London underground by heart would certainly know about Barts hospital, right?
“With the right motivation one can achieve almost everything.” Scott answered and there was a softness to his voice John couldn’t place.
What else needed Sherlock to hear, beyond that John would do everything to make sure that Sherlock wouldn't regret to have taken this step? That John wouldn't leave. That he'd never hurt Sherlock again. What else could John tell him.
They woke up tangled together on the sofa, sore from too little space and cold because the one blanket they had shared had slipped to the floor during the sparse hours of sleep.
“How do you…” John turned towards Greg and made a face. “Never mind. I don’t care.” He turned away again.
If John wasn’t mistaken there was something pleading in Sherlock’s voice. As if he needed John to understand at all costs.
He had never thought that there’d come a time he’d miss someone else’s warmth lingering in the covers in the morning. Though, ‘miss’ wasn’t quite the right term as he’d never had someone warming his bed for longer than a couple of hours in the first place. The body warmth of other persons had always been a tad off-putting for him. Most of all in his own bed. He had always tried to avoid bringing people to his own place for sex. Of course he’d had sex. Sometimes including a bed, sometimes not. At good times to satisfy basic human desires, at bad times to ensure the supply to sate a different kind of craving. He had tried to delete that part of his history, but apparently he had done a poor job. The memories had come back full force after waking in that much too familiar place a couple of days ago and hadn’t left him since. Luckily they weren’t his only experiences. The more enjoyable ones, mainly from his young adult years, had stayed with him as well. They had outweighed the vileness and disgust he had gone through. They hadn’t erased it, but counterbalanced. He knew both ends of what sex could be like. Sex didn’t alarm him. He wasn’t intrigued or impressed by it. He was aware, he could estimate, he could judge and rationally decide if, when and what he needed. It wasn’t always bad. At uni he’d even had a permanent bed companion. It had held its advantages not to have to go through the initial rituals of ‘getting to know each other’ every single time. Also to have someone who knew the physical and sexual boundaries: what is welcome, what is wanted, the dos and don’ts. They’d had a good time, enjoyed each other's company during the day, enjoyed the sex at night and sometimes not at night. They’d been friends, one of the few Sherlock had made in his life. Thinking back, it might be called more than friends. Perhaps even a relationship, although it had never held any deep emotional attachment. They had liked each other, they were most definitely physically attracted to each other, but Sherlock had never missed Victor’s warmth in the morning when he had snuck out of the room again in the middle of the night.
John wouldn’t have thought it  possible, but Miss Pirate was, still hanging upside down, bending her upper body upwards, taking hold of one corner of the flag with her teeth and pulling on it teasingly slowly while lowering herself again. Just when John froze because he thought the cloth would slip all the way off, Miss Pirate flipped over in a sort of somersault and planted herself steadily on the stage on her knees again. Flush high on her cheeks, hair in a messy disarray, she still held the Jolly Roger between her bright teeth, which flashed in a sharp contrast against the devilishly grinning dark mouth.
This chapter is dedicated to my dear friend jobooksandcoffee. It wouldn't exist in the way you see here if not for her. She developed a special liking for a certain silverfox and his boat. This chapter is proof how betas can bring forth the worst (read: best) in us writers...
“Mycroft, don’t make this more difficult than it has to be! If it affects my life too, wouldn’t you think I have a right to know?” John tried again, beginning to get desperate. He was worried. What was Sherlock getting himself into again? And what about John himself? Where would that leave him?
Looking at it and listening to it from this new angle, John made his way slowly into the living room, closed the door carefully behind him. He put the coffee cups down on the couch table, shed his jacket and dropped it on the sofa without leaving Sherlock out of his sight. When John cautiously took one step after the other to get past the couch table, Sherlock seamlessly transitioned from one melody into another. John was aware that it wasn't Sherlock's usual repertoire he was playing, also not improvising as he often did in the early days. The slow wistful string of notes of this new melody softened John's steps as if he were walking on a cloud, the syrupy yearning made him slow down until he came to a halt in the middle of the room. Close enough to notice how Sherlock's breathing quickened the moment his hands and arms stilled and the melody gave way for
“Even though I'm convinced Mrs Hudson wouldn’t be shocked in the slightest, we can always tell her it's for a case." he said, amusement and joy evident in his voice.
Did Sherlock still not know that John was all his? And that he'd do everything for Sherlock? Why did Sherlock still hesitate to go all-in? Did this still feel like a game to him? Was he still afraid to lose?
John pulled a face. It wouldn’t be very pleasant. After the day yesterday the mood would surely not be very relaxed. Maybe if he stayed in his room pretending to sleep until Sherlock leaves the flat? At any point he would leave, wouldn’t he?
John pushed himself up and pulled a face at the sticky cold mess on his belly. Sherlock turned over and looked up at John; a totally disheveled wreck of a man.
John tried to breathe calmly through his nose; the pulse thumping in his ears creating more a dubstep-like sound than the buoyant tune of the pirate theme. No longer sitting on the barstool because that was impossible, he watched enthralled what would come next and barked out an actual laugh when Miss Pirate suddenly pulled out a Jolly Roger—the black flag that was the last detail that marked her as a proper pirate… skull and crossed bones and all—which she apparently had hidden underneath the back of her corset and skirt.
John took a deep breath, forced himself to look back to the screen and squaring his shoulders he asked, “Okay, what's the plan?”
Sherlock’s breath hitched the tiniest bit, barely audible if it were not for John’s senses being on high alert. John hummed appreciatively against Sherlock’s skin, bathing in the warmth it radiated and the familiar fragrance of Sherlock’s cologne mixed with a new heady and raw scent of skin covered in fresh sweat and dust and the distinct intoxicating whiff of the thrill of entering unknown territory.
“No — uhm, it’s… it’s fine. But now hurry to get off this train otherwise your route will get much more complicated.”
"Your explanatory skills are magnificent, John." Sherlock said dead serious, but John could see the smile on his lips.
Everything he had thought about tumbled over in John’s head. In panic he tried to grasp for words. What did he want? Everything! But what first? What should he say? The words stuck in his throat. Nothing would make sense in just a few words. He wanted a whole new life and still so much of the old one. Now facing the reality, facing Sherlock, he couldn’t form a coherent thought. He had to say something… he couldn’t just stand there mute like a goldfish, mouth gaping in search of his voice.
The streets they passed we're almost empty of people so the ride didn't take too long and they were both relieved to finally be home. Feet heavy as lead they made their way up. In the living room Miss Pirate stopped and turned and faced John, who slowly walked over. He reached up and cupped one side of her face in his warm palm. She leaned into the touch and closed her beautiful eyes, revealing the slightly ruined purple eyeshadow, smeared by sweat and sinful blinking.
“I’ve probably seen that movie a hundred times. I don’t know, stopped counting. It’s embarrassing really…” John cleared his throat to get rid of the lump that made his voice sound thick. He was grateful that Sherlock just listened, eyes shortly flicking up to his, otherwise concentrating on his task.
"Well. That was Mycroft Holmes." Greg shrugged. "Thought you'd recognise him." He added and winked at John. "Do you think he'd be amenable to have dinner sometime?"
Then he sighed deeply, squared his shoulders and let himself sink back on the bed. He gazed up unfocused, not bothered by the still roaring music any longer. He hesitated for a moment before nodding to himself and slowly typing the next message. His thumb hovered above the luminescent screen but in the end he swallowed, closed his eyes and tapped the send button.
But again, again, there he was. Kneeling between the shatters of his life, shoulders heaving due to difficult breathing, John looked around. Was this it? Was this the whole purpose of his life? A box of hollow memories?
Seeing Sherlock this wild in the throes of passion was almost enough to do John in, but as soon as he felt Sherlock pulse and clench around his cock, John was pushed over the edge as well. Shouting out something he wasn't able to recall later, he threw his head back and squeezed his eyes shut and felt his orgasm take over. All the pent-up sensations and tension and overwhelming desire broke free, exploded, and he came and came, shot burst after burst of his release into Sherlock's body, before he floated into the woozy and warm and tranquil space of post-orgasm bliss.
“We've been through a lot together, Sherlock. More than any relationship could take actually.” John said, looking steadily into Sherlock’s eyes. “I'm still here. I've come back. You're still here. You've come back. Don't you think we'd make it through a bit more madness?” He watched Sherlock. He could almost physically feel John's gaze on his skin. “It's exactly what I love about you. I wouldn't have you any other way, Sherlock. I'm here for this. I'm here for you. You can't do anything to ruin this.” He searched Sherlock’s eyes for one last short moment. “What can I do to make you believe me?”
He should try to go back to his usual schedule, that would do him good. Thinking about nothing would also mean not thinking about completely unwanted and unreachable, out of his league, stunning, interesting… Fuck.
This was Shezza. This was Shezza at his worst, an exponentiation of everything he had found roughly one month after his wedding.
An almost numbness caused by over-sensitivity spread on Sherlock's face when John tenderly took it in his hands, his thumbs gently stroking his cheekbones; the same kind of numbness that made it impossible to distinguish between icy and steamy hot water until one scolded oneself. That was probably exactly what was happening right now, not only to his face, thought Sherlock; but right now he would happily accept any damage it would cause.
And of me, obviously.” He took a deep steadying breath, trying to gather some courage. He had never shared this before. With no-one, not even Ella. “Here we go then.”
I hope you're all safe and well!! Here's to a 2021 that will hopefully be a bit easier on all of us!!!
“I’m terribly sorry, if this doesn’t meet your sex hotline client standards.” John hissed, dripping with sarcasm, and only afterwards noticed some interested glances thrown his way. Fantastic, so much for keeping it decent…
John’s thumbs moved slowly up and down his nape, brushing the tender skin behind his ear. Sherlock tried to hide the shudder taking hold of his entire body, but he couldn't. His trembling hands made him aware of where they were resting. He didn’t know if it was meant to steady his hands or to actually pull John closer, but that was what happened when he increased the pressure on John’s lower back. Until they were standing flush against each other. Until Sherlock could feel the warmth of their bodies mingle. Until John had to reposition his arms because the angle became awkward. They slid off Sherlock’s shoulders, trapped his arms, circled his waist. John leaned slightly backwards to look Sherlock in the eyes.
He inhaled deeply and realised that he had slowed his steps. He was still trying to avoid it. This was ridiculous. He wanted it. Sherlock had agreed on it. He had even been the one to initiate it in the end, after John’s lame drunken attempts. He was still embarrassed about it, but well… it had led to this. So, that was… good. Kind of. Wasn’t it?
After she had completed her spins, John was amazed at the canny ways Miss Pirate used the flag to cover the parts of her anatomy not meant for the common public to see. Always teasing enough to not look prudish, leaving enough view on lace panties and suspenders, tempting arse cheeks and loins. However, always just in time to not allow a full view under the skirt. It was a risky game, but then that was exactly the way Miss Pirate liked to play. As did John.
"Hey, that's my part…" John laughed despite the lump forming in his throat and the tears welling up. "Come up with your own sappy lines…"
“And if so, I’d never tell you what you told me, because that would be far too embarrassing and you’d regret it and we can’t have that, can we?” Sherlock continued and sounded… what? Smug? That bastard!
In a flash, Sherlock jumped off the bed in all his naked glory and started rummaging in cabinets, picked up his phone, made for the bedroom door. He stopped on his way, looked at a flummoxed John who was still sitting on the bed.
Sherlock growled and his wandering hands and fingers suggested that he was about to make use of the opportunity, when very inconveniently his mobile buzzed and beeped. They tried to ignore it but it went off again. And again.
Anyway, he wasn’t done here. He needed more! He hadn’t reached his limit yet. Always forcing his own boundaries; more, stronger, faster.
The other one of John's hands slid upwards, splaying between Sherlock's shoulder blades. Sherlock could feel the fingertips digging into his muscles, automatically pushing him against John's chest; until their hearts were lined up to engage in an endless give and take of rapid beats.
“Right,” John snorted. At the same time his stomach gave an angry growl, indicating that lunch time might be a good time for breakfast. He turned towards the kitchen with the intention to prepare some kind of edible meal for them and was immediately reminded of the fabulous variety of supplies Sherlock had purchased. He sighed.
“This, what I’m feeling now is so much  more intense, so much more overwhelming. It makes me…” He felt himself get out of breath, his breath becoming shallow. He was apprehensively looking at John looking reassuringly back.
Sherlock moved totally unimpressed through the corridors but John’s eyes almost popped out of his head seeing all the people crowding them. There were… dancers?... in different states of undress. Or dress? He couldn’t tell. Other staff members; maybe from behind the bar? Waiters? No, probably not waiters. Surely some of them for tech stuff, considering there would be dancing, thus music, light and John had no idea what else would be needed. Also, the occasional guy all pimped-up with gold chains around their necks and whatnot. John scrutinised them dismissively until he realised that nobody looked at him twice, he seemed to blend in perfectly in the crowd. Yeah, alright, he really needed to get the hang in this new role.
John was a bit proud of himself. After his fruitless night he had concluded, that there was no use in trying to sort things with Sherlock when there was nothing sorted within himself. He’d only end up stammering and getting twisted in his words again. Sherlock would misunderstand, John would be unable to explain, Sherlock would close up, … well, the usual. They’d end up where they’d begun, again, or
"I don't want to hurt you again." John said under his breath, barely able to stand the affection radiating from Sherlock's eyes.
Slowly, slowly, Sherlock lowered himself, knees shifting, hands gently following the motion—gliding down John’s nape, his neck, his shoulders and chest, brushing over his erect and sensible nipples, making him hiss. Sherlock settled lightly on John’s thighs, both Sherlock’s hands sneaking behind John’s waist, down to his arse and tucking John’s hips forward until their groins met. When their erections pressed against each other, Sherlock pinned John down with his full weight. John let his head fall back, tried to breathe, took a shallow and shuddering breath.
“And not the point. Not really difficult, too." Greg nodded to himself. "Point is: any progress? With… whatever?” Greg raised his eyebrows.
Before he could stop himself he slid his finger under the lid solidly sealing the envelope and tore it open. He reached inside. Took hold of the item and pulled it out, holding his breath. Sleek. Cold. Shiny.
At first they strolled through the streets a bit without speaking much. Only the occasional “Here? What do you think?” “Nah… don’t fancy Greek…” Repeated in a similar way around every other corner, none of them particularly hungry. There was no mentioning about what caused John's gloomy mood or where he'd been the last couple of days or why he even stayed at Greg's at all. They walked without destination and without plan and without knowing each other well enough to know where to go together if it wasn’t to a pub for a pint.
He couldn't keep this up much longer, he knew it. But he couldn't give up. What if it wasn't enough? It'd never be enough. He was never enough.
"He would have revealed much more information if we'd had just waited that tad bit longer. But no, you had to play the hero." Sherlock murmured in John's ear without real venom. "I have to admit, it was a tiny bit sexy…" Oh that bastard of a Pirate.
"SHERLOCK. HOLMES. You. Sit down. NOW." Mycroft's voice boomed through the kitchen. A voice that started wars, that ended them and that didn't tolerate any resistance. "Sit down and. Drink. Your. Tea." He added a bit more soothed when Sherlock didn't protest immediately. He only narrowed his eyes to slits and eyed his brother for a moment.
At first, he kept standing there utterly still, letting the music seep into him, filling every single corner of body and mind. Bit by bit he felt more immersed in it, as if the music was washing him clean from every emotional dirt and filth he felt covered with.
With that John was dismissed and made his way up the stairs. What he found there was a suit he probably couldn’t afford in a lifetime. Perfectly tailored of course, bringing out his characteristics in all the right ways. It was matched to Sherlock's purple dress in a discreet but intimate kind of way; dark purple shirt with a somewhat lighter purple jacket topped off with lapels of black velvet, which went remarkably well with his greying hair and made it somehow seem like a desirable attribute. The snuggly fitting trousers clinging to his arse much tighter than he was used to, but nonetheless comfortable due to the exquisite fabric John didn’t know the name of. To his absolute horror though, the finishing touch to the look were slippers which sparkled in silver and purple and black glitters. He eyed them sceptically, but doubted that Sherlock would accept any other suggestion; least of all if it’d be John’s.
“You… lost him?” John growled. “You, Mycroft Holmes, fucking lost him?” John raised his voice and pinned Mycroft with a razor sharp gaze, narrowing his eyes.
“This is the most important thing in my life up to now.” He said, slowly, seriously, after a moment of mementally bracing himself. How much more plainly did he have to be?
When she spoke again, she sounded much calmer, much more compassionate, much more reassuring. A friend. A real friend, Sherlock realised.
He repeated it again and again, refocusing on his transport, physical pain, so much easier. He concentrated on the stretch of his inner thighs, his flanks. The strength that he could feel held his body together and in balance.
They settled at the table, both holding onto their paper coffee cups, silently looking at each other, until Sherlock took the first sip and pulled a face.
"Cup your fist with your other hand now. Keep stroking your penis." John hurriedly fumbled to pin his phone against his ear with his shoulder, eager to follow suit. "Can you feel my throat? Can you feel your glans bump against it each time I go down on you?" Scott's voice was husky and rough now. Shit, that man really needed a license to be allowed out in the open, this couldn't be legal. Each contact the sensitive skin of the head of John's cock made with the rough calluses of his hand palm, sent sparks flying through his neurons. Wouldn't take long now to set him completely on fire…
