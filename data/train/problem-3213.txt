“Dean,” Sam accuses despite Dean’s amusement. After a moment, he smiles, ducking his head. “You deserve to live too, Dean. I just—I couldn't save you before, and now there’s a chance you’ll die again? Because what, you escaped?”
Castiel doesn’t blame him, honestly. Five in the morning is no time for any human to be awake, and Sam does it willingly. Castiel has joined him on a run once, but most of the time, he prefers to sit with Dean in silence and watch the sunrise from their porch. “I’m gifting it to Dean,” he admits, somewhat sad. “As a thank you. You helped as well, but—”
It should feel wrong—should be disgusting, the mess dripping off his face—but he loves it, probably more than he should. He keeps his touch loose as he tongues Castiel’s cock clean, his stomach curling pleasantly with the sound of Castiel’s quiet moans. They come down amid the rattle of the cicadas, and eventually, Dean pulls off, only to stand and crawl into Castiel’s lap. Only one leg fits into his chair; the other, he digs his toes into the earth for leverage. Castiel’s kiss tastes of sweat and the come from Dean’s lips, all wet heat and lust, and Dean can’t get enough of it.
There it is. Even more terrifying than the monsters is the fact that Dean’s life is in jeopardy by just existing. Monsters know to look for him, all with the promise of increasing their numbers. Worse, it’s a promise made by demons, who couldn't care less about fulfilling their end of the bargain if it means getting what they want first. That want being Dean, alive. Castiel doesn’t want to think about it after that.
Less than twenty-four hours later, and he’s whole again. “That’s anticlimactic,” Castiel says. Dean chuckles, shaking his head. “I was expecting more.”
He has no destination in mind, no monsters to chase. Part of Dean relaxes as the wind whips by, as he sings aloud to the radio and to Castiel’s quiet hums of contentment. They should find a lead, some sort of headwind that can lead them in the direction of Dean’s killer, but for the moment, all he knows is Castiel and the open road.
The week doesn’t fully draw to a close until Castiel steps out of his car Friday afternoon, his arms sunburnt and his eyes straining. Engine shuttered, he notices the smell of what has to be burning charcoal. Smoke wafts into the air, and voices mingle, barely audible over the day’s choice of music.
Looking over to Dean, Castiel gives him one last nod. “Don’t let your guard down,” he starts. “Don’t waste any of your ammunition.”
It gives him hope—but that hope is shot. Because even if Castiel is alive, then he can’t live with his wings like this. If he ever wakes up, Castiel will never forgive him. He can handle the heartache, so long as Castiel lives. Even if it’s not with him, if Castiel can’t look him in the eye again, then at least he made the right decision.
Dean looks beautiful in the sun, his skin shining with the afterglow and his body light, unhindered. Standing in the surf, Castiel looks back on occasion, at the man lying on a towel in the sand, sunglasses on his face and every inch of him slathered in sunscreen. Farther into the water, two snorkels bob; Jack surfaces, holding a sand dollar the size of a baseball, and Sam comes up with a handful of kelp.
Vegas. The last thing Dean wants right now is to show up in a wheelchair, and Sam wants him to hop on the bus and go to
As the days go on, Dean grows restless. Not for a hunt, but for something to do with his hands, to keep his mind occupied. Most mornings, Castiel packs up his supplies just in time to find Dean emerging from his room, fully dressed and half-asleep, with an empty thermos in his hand. Castiel doesn’t question it and wanders into the kitchen with him, waiting for the coffee to brew.
“Probably not up to anything other than missionary,” Dean groans. “Fuck, I was gonna get you to fuck me this weekend too. Charlie’s got us a room booked, and I can’t go like this. Shit, I can barely walk.”
, Castiel thinks. “You have me,” he whispers in return, and Dean softens in his hold. “I’m yours, Dean.”
By the time Castiel pulls out of Charlie’s stronghold and makes his way to the dorm, Dean is already there, seated on the front porch with a rag over his eyes, rocking mindlessly to the rhythm of what sounds like bluegrass instrumentals. At first, he leaves Dean be and sets his things down in their room, then returns with a thick notebook and a pencil, only to find Dean making his way to his feet, car keys in hand. He casts Castiel a look over his shoulder, his eyes red-rimmed and his face puffy, his jaw set in a hard line.
Immediately, John’s tirade stops. His familiar face changes in a split second, the hard lines of his cheeks warped in anger, his eyes narrowed, the creases around them like canyons. His hand shakes where he holds the newspaper, the material crumpled and useless. “Well, if it ain’t my own flesh and blood,” John slurs, outstretching his arms. His smile turns Dean’s stomach. “Thought I told you to keep your ass off this property.”
Shiloh meets him outside of a dilapidated building alongside State Route 109, the outside rotted and the windows boarded up. The wood siding bows in places, and holes mar the roof, the largest visible from the side of the road. Castiel parks a few feet from the church’s entrance and steps out into the humidity. Shiloh stands from the building’s front stoop. He can’t be more than twenty, dressed in an oversized leather jacket and a pair of holey jeans. Castiel waves and waits until Shiloh waves back.
Dean sprints off the porch and across the grass, in the direction of where it started. Branches crack under his boots and the cicadas continue to wail, somehow growing louder, fiercer. The barn comes into view, and Dean stomps through the remnants of a puddle, sending mud up the sides of his jeans. He ignores it—because the barn doors are open, and inside, he spots the vague outline of a man standing among the carnage.
“No.” Castiel laughs, probably against his better judgment. “Not that I wouldn't mind. Dean, look at me.” Dean does, albeit with some apprehension. “I’m not a memory. I’m not a fantasy that you replay every night, in the hopes of seeing me again. You have me. You can touch me, do what you want with me, and I’ll still be here, as I’ll always be.” Another kiss. Dean holds him tighter, his hand shaking. “Forgive me if I overstay my welcome.”
Thursday comes, and Castiel finishes up his class ten minutes earlier than scheduled. Assignments are due next Tuesday, and he offers his students a head start on the holiday weekend. Which, in and of itself isn’t a lie. But Dean texted him halfway through his session, and nothing short of a lightning strike could take his mind off it.
He does. Dean loves him, for one, and now, Castiel believes it in his heart, that his love is returned in full.
“You’d like that, wouldn't you? To be held down and fucked within an inch of your life.” Castiel sits up on his knees, hoisting Dean’s hips higher. Nodding, Dean watches him rub the head of his cock against his rim. Teasing, more than anything, letting him know just what’s in store—and Dean can’t wait. “You taunt me like you’re in charge.”
But Castiel shakes his head and thumbs beneath Dean’s eyes. Dean’s breath hitches, hiccupping as he breaks. Slowly, wholly, until he shakes in Castiel’s hands. “Tell me what’s wrong,” Castiel pleads.
“Okay,” Castiel says—the last thing he hears as Castiel sweeps him up in his arms, burying him in something soft and ethereal. Something he hasn’t felt in over a decade—and now, something he can touch, something he can
“We took that into account.” Castiel faces him. “You have to understand, we were operating off of what we were told. Saint Peter determines a soul’s fate based off of the purity of your soul, but there was… something wrong.” He shakes his head. “Dean, when you died, did you sense anything? What were you doing?”
Dean lives about an hour from Panama City Beach. At night, the drive took ages. Days later, and Castiel misses most of it, too lost in his head to notice anything other than Dean and his occasional shy smile. The city comes into view, silence replaced with the noise of the crowds, even for eight in the morning. The shop isn’t open today, according to the sign in the window, but Dean unlocks the door anyway, leading Castiel inside before turning the latch.
Shaking his head, Sam hikes his backpack higher over his shoulder. “That’s where everyone goes on vacation. Maine sounds nice, and I’ve already got a room at a B&B with Rowena—”
Said fangs gleam as Alastair leers at him, his white eyes ecstatic. “Angel,” he purrs, making his way to his feet. From the floor, Dean tips his head back, panic on his face. “And here I thought you’d sit there and be a good boy while I defile your plaything.”
Yet he climbs higher, aided by the Grace circulating through his system. “Your wings,” Castiel says in wonder before his eyes pinch shut and his lips part. One thrust, then another—then he stills, and Dean feels his cock thicken as it spills in an endless rush. Only, the Grace rallies within him, and in the shadow of his periphery, he watches the shadow of what look like wings rise from his back, barely there before they vanish.
Sam, thankfully, doesn’t speak for another few minutes. Long enough for Dean to walk back inside and pour himself another cup, and Sam along with it. In silence, they sit and rock, watching the sky gradually clear and the reds of the sun fade to bright blue. Cold air seeps in, replacing humidity with a rush of winter all too early in the season. It feels normal, mundane.
Seated by their room door, Castiel watches Dean clean the backseat of his so-called Baby and wonders just how a man so radiant, so holy could be damned to spend the rest of eternity in Hell. Just looking at him, Castiel can’t help but be blinded by the brightness of Dean’s soul, how in so many ways, he resembles the sun. He wants to bask in Dean’s presence, wants to marvel at every inch of him, down to the very atoms.
Bright blue eyes watch him from above, glowing just the faintest hint of blue as he kisses his way down Dean’s chest, all wet lips and an even hotter tongue. The second Castiel finds his belt, Dean bucks up into him involuntarily, chasing the friction that Castiel refuses to give him. “You’ll have to walk me through this,” Castiel says, unclasping his belt and working his zipper down. Dean lifts his hips, allowing Castiel to pull his jeans off, leaving him in his briefs and nothing else.
“It was demons,” Dean says between breaths. The room spins. He leans against the wall, waiting for the stars to disappear. “I got a call the other day, demanding that I pay your ransom. Said they’d had you stashed away down here and if I didn't show up, they’d kill you.” A pause. “It’s been four months, Cas. I’ve done everything I could to find you, and this was… It sounded solid. A lot better than any of the other bullshit I’ve looked into. Hell, they described you down to what color socks you were wearing.”
Castiel heads for the bathroom, and the conversation dies. Dean only looks up once the screen door slams shut and he finishes the dishes, skillets scrubbed and his fingers pruned. Drying his hands, he stops by the bathroom and closes the door, his back to the wood. Only, something hangs in the way, something that smells like the aged leather of the Impala, of wildflowers and salt and something so uniquely
“Hey.” Leaning his head into the pillows, Dean closes his eyes. In his peripheral, he hears Castiel scooting his chair closer, never once letting go of his hand. “Where am I?”
Castiel kisses his throat, again and again. Dean’s grip tightens, lips parted in a moan. “I won’t hurt you,” he promises. Dean freezes, enough for Castiel to notice and pull back. “Dean—”
The bell tinkles as he opens the shop door. Cool air replaces the warm, muggy soup of the beach, and a shiver runs down Castiel’s spine the second it hits his skin. Inside, flash art adorns the walls in frames, and black leather couches sit up against the walls of the waiting area, empty for the evening. On the wall, the clock reads ten-thirty-seven. Twenty-three more minutes, and the shop will close. Twenty-three minutes, and Castiel will have wasted an entire day in his relentless search.
Swallowing, Dean closes his eyes. “When you…” He touches his chest, then pulls his shirt down. It shouldn't be this hard. Of the few times in the past that a woman took him to bed, none of them have touched him like this, so… intently.
All that remains in his absence is silence, and Castiel making his way to his feet, chair legs scraping across the tile. His hands settle atop Dean’s shoulders, thumbs kneading into his nape. Nice—amazing, even, and if he doesn't move now, he might fall asleep just from Castiel giving him a halfhearted massage. “You gonna go to your room?” he asks, managing to tilt his head up to see Castiel looking down at him.
Dean sucks in a breath, the urge to kiss Castiel festering beneath the skin. Between them, Castiel undoes his belt, then his zipper; Dean holds onto his hips, tucking his thumbs into Castiel’s belt loops as he tugs his boxers down to reveal his cock. Just looking at it, Dean has never wanted anything in his mouth more.
“I feel like it.” Castiel sighs, so deeply that Dean feels it in his chest. “I underestimated the emotional toll that this process would take. Every day, I drive somewhere in the state and talk to people and hear their stories, knowing full and well that I can’t help them. I can’t do anything but sit there and debate becoming a social worker, just so I can do
Whatever that means, Dean doesn’t want to know. Not now. Later, maybe, but for now, he lets it slide, and drags Castiel to join Sam outside.
“It’s twenty minutes from Los Angeles. Dean, just…” Tentative, Castiel touches Dean’s shoulder, fitting his fingers beneath his shirt sleeve. “I don’t know. I don't know what will happen between now and December. You may not even like me come time, but if you still do, I… I can help you get on your feet. You can stay with me, if you want.” A breath. “I’d really like to consider you a friend, come what may.”
The sheer number of discount stores gives Castiel pause. Just driving around town, he counts at least six of them, all varying names and franchises, and all located in equally small strip malls. Older-model cars sit parked a few feet from the entrances of each, with families loitering instead of driving off, or kids chasing each other or screaming.
“But I… I just didn't think you were real. I mean, angels were real.” He leans his elbows atop the table, his brow furrowed. “I believe in what I see, man. Vamps, werewolves, rugaru, if I can touch it, I know it’s real. But you’re… People talk about seeing angels, or miracles. Hell, even stigmata, but you can’t prove that.”
“Hey.” Dean points a finger at her, to Castiel’s shock. “I’m not ‘a human,’ I have a name. And two, I consented. I’d rather have a scar than be dead somewhere because he couldn't get to me in time.”
Dean blinks, his eyes the slightest bit wet. The same as he’s looked ever since Castiel walked in the door, except now, with the actual threat of tears. “Why would you do that?”
A few feet from the seafoam, Castiel sits on a towel, beneath a pop-up tent blocking out the worst of the sun. Sam stands further out into the surf, occasionally reaching down to pull something free from within the depths. Dean could join him, but the shade is much more inviting, that and Castiel’s body, warmed from the sun and dripping with salt water and sweat.
At the bottom of the stairs, Dean finds a short corridor and a door with bars over the window. He reaches for the knob and turns it, his heart in his throat; it gives easily, and a rush of heat greets him, smelling of copper and rot. No blood on the floor, though, just melted wax from candles long-since burned out and pooled water from a leak in the ceiling.
Castiel, wandering hands and all, freezes. As he always does, averting his eyes like he’s ashamed of something. Of himself, probably. In all his life, Dean has never been with a man so shy about showing his cock off, no matter the size. “Dean,” Castiel sighs, then rolls off, to Dean’s annoyance. He flops onto the motel bedding, blue eyes staring up at the popcorn ceiling with his hands folded over his stomach.
On a spiritual level, Castiel knows Dean does. Has known for years, even when the world tore them apart, when their situation put them at odds. Dean always forgave him, and Castiel loves him for that, and many other reasons. Gentle, Dean turns Castiel’s hand over, thumbing along the crease running up his palm before slicing into it. Rather than blood, Grace spills free, and Dean brings it to his mouth, capturing it behind full lips. Bright blue sparks in his eyes.
“No, Cas.” Dean squeezes Castiel’s shoulder through thin fabric. “I can take you back there and show you. They weren’t even wings anymore, they were dead weight. And that’s the only way I could’ve gotten you out of there. I made the decision, and I knew you’d be pissed if you ever woke up.” He swallows, glancing away. “I thought you were dead.”
“It so is.” Dean pats him again, softer this time. After a moment, he drags Sam into a hug, an arm around his neck, the other around his back. Sam holds him just as tight, sniffling into Dean’s shoulder. “It’s good to see you, man.”
“Shit.” Dean throws his head back, palming his eyes. That’s fine, they’ll just have to pick it up on the way back. “Your car that giant gold thing you got parked out there?”
Dean is a man on a mission, Castiel finds. When it comes to cooking, especially. Seated at the kitchen table, he watches Dean roam the room, checking the burners and fishing ingredients from the refrigerator when need be. Apparently, he’s making soup, or so he claims; whatever it is smells good, and Bobby checks in every few minutes, like his presence will make the pot boil faster.
“Just—stop.” Palms over his eyes, Dean leans against the Impala. “I know, man, I get it. Heaven’s a bureaucracy and you’re a pawn. Trust me, it ain’t something I haven’t heard before. But I…” Pushing away, he slams his heel into the Impala’s bumper. The clang leaves his ears ringing and an ache spreading up into his calf. “I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve to die like that, and Sam tried to…”
“You keep saying that like you’re…” Dean takes his hand and presses his lips to the wound—and Castiel sucks in a breath as his wings expand to their full breadth. “Look at me. Please, man, I—You know I love you, okay? Look at me and tell me I don't. Look at everything I’ve done and tell me that I’m not in love.”
Castiel glances down, eyes half-lidded. He falls onto his side, the blankets around his waist and his undershirt pulled too tight against his torso. Hesitant, Dean rests his hand over Castiel’s hip, slowly stroking up and down skin-warmed cotton. “I could have,” Castiel murmurs. Between them, he curls his fingers into the bedding, then smooths it out. “I’ve lived a very long life, Dean. A life where I’d ascribed to the teachings of a man I’d never met, and a man that threatened to destroy everything I held dear. A man determined to destroy the world as if it were expendable. But I grew to learn that there was more to being an angel than blindly serving God, than preparing for the war to end all wars.
Dean laughs, the sound echoing through the mausoleum. “Any place’d be better than here.” Curling closer to Castiel’s side, he holds his hand tighter, eyes shut. “How long do we have?”
“No, it’s—Of course I wanna teach.” Sitting up, Dean leans his elbows atop her desk. “It’s not that, it’s…” He stops, inhales. His eyes sting. “No, it’s just… I got a new roommate.”
“That what you feel every time we fuck?” Dean asks. His tongue feels two sizes too large, his eyes too heavy to keep open. “’Cause man, I think you broke me.”
, Dean thinks. He moans and trembles, his tongue heavy, his hips desperate to spread wider as Castiel strokes him, teases him, brings him to the edge, only to back away. Again and again, Castiel urges him to the precipice and stops, and each time, Dean whines, verging on tears. Because this might as well be heaven, with Castiel surrounding him, in him, locked in an embrace from head to toe.
The shop comes back into view, the candles backlighting Anyika’s face. She stares at him with wide eyes, her jaw slack—and Dean bursts into tears, pressing his bloodied palm to his mouth.
“Castiel, are you ready for school?” he heard his mother call out from upstairs. Castiel closed his eyes and breathed in before turning around, picking up his bag, and making his way out of his bedroom door and down the stairs.
Castiel sat at the top of the stairs; he’d already taken his dinner to his room and left it there, where it was probably now lukewarm seeing as he had been served before everyone else. He heard the clinking of knives and forks against each other and the china plates, but no conversation.
It made Castiel laugh, but it wasn’t enough to get rid of the annoying edge of worry and fear – extreme anxiety, that he was feeling – and it had nothing to do with math.
Castiel simply nodded, enjoying the coolness of the room against the warmness of his cheeks. He turned to look into the mirror, and his face didn’t expose any of the embarrassment he felt. At least something was going his way.
“What happened?” Michael asked instantly, looking down at Castiel with extreme worry laced across his features. Gabriel looked pretty pale but that was the only thing relating to worry that showed. Mary looked a little mad.
Michael sighed and pressed pause on the game control and turned to face Dean, “well, our mother cares way too much about her reputation as a person to even consider being a parent. We’re just her trophies; something to show that she doesn’t just focus on her career- but that’s still all she does. But everyone just assumes that because we’re well clothed, good looking, thin but well fed, etc. That she’s taking care of us the way a decent parent should.”
The sound of Dean’s shoes on the carpet matched the speed of his beating heart; he wiped his hands on his jeans, hoping against hope that the sweat left no dark smudges on his clothing that would be noticeable to Dean. Dean turned around, frowning when he noticed that Castiel had stopped walking.
“You’re in a good mood this morning, Cassie,” Gabriel said, pouring himself juice – which was a shock to Castiel who normally saw Gabriel drinking straight out of the carton, “no shrug dance for me today?” he asked, shrugging repetitively – he almost looked like he was going to have a fit.
But everything seemed to light up when he felt arms wrap around his body. The metaphorical hands disappeared from around his throat; the arms wrapped around him the only things he allowed himself to focus on. He breathed in deep, relaxing in the arms wrapped around them. They were probably Michael’s, he knew how instinctively protective his older brother was of him. But when he looked up, he recognised only Dean.
“It must be insane,” Dean said, “I’ll admit, your brothers told me what happened,” he muttered, “and that your brother was out of the asylum...”
Castiel shook his head wearily and pointed towards the front of the class, where his name and issue was still on the board for everyone to see.
Castiel made his way slowly into the kitchen, Gabriel and Michael were sitting in the lounge room, eating their pancakes and watching the morning news. Sam was doing his homework at the dining table and attempting to eat his own pancakes at the same time, non-successfully.
“Science,” Dean said with a sad look. It was the only class, other than Castiel’s electives, that he didn’t have with Dean. He had it with no one he knew, which bugged him, because he could have really used the company right now.
Castiel shrugged and reached around for a notepad – Dean handed him one and a pen before he could even sign and ask for one. He nodded at him in thanks and started to write hastily on it.
Gabriel said, pointing at Dean- though the boy didn’t seem to notice even though he was watching Gabriel’s hands move.
He heard Gabriel snort aloud at Michael’s comment, and he could picture the frown his mother had on his face, Castiel’s eyes began to form tears, he was scared; petrified even. What if Lucifer came back and got him again? Finished off the job he’d attempted so many years ago?
Michael and Gabriel looked at one another before looking over at a peacefully sleeping Castiel; who was bundled up in his blankets on the floor.
He got out of bed, put on some clothing, once again smiling, seeing all of his clothing from the night before strewn across the floor messily, thrown uncaringly in a moment of passion, it made his heart swell. He walked out of the door feeling confident. He felt good. He felt alive.
Mary thrust the note toward him and Dean made a show of sighing and folding the piece of paper in half before placing it into his pocket, “alright, happy?” he asked, “will you go now?”
He fell asleep to the feeling of Dean’s thumb rubbing against his knuckles, the sound of mumbling and muttering voices being more comforting than he thought they should be.
During the rest of the car drive, they exchanged stories of moments in the car, pranks they’d done, multiple other things. Michael sat in the back quietly, trying to look stern but laughing anyway and Castiel smiled in the front seat, hoping that one day all of these wonderful things would have something to do with him, that he would eventually have these types of adventures.
Anyway, I feel like I should add that when I write young Lucifer, I always picture him as Evan Peters...x'D
Chuck looked at Mary with despair, and she whispered the name of the school before the man left the room and made the call. He could hear Chuck speaking in the kitchen, telling police about the situation.
Normally this would have upset Castiel, but he had a burning question on his mind that had been there for the last few days. He got out his notepad, making Dean look at him expectantly. He began writing the question that had been stuck in his mind- it was all he’d been thinking about lately and he’d been waiting for a time where they were alone together.
So Dean and Sam got into the Impala and headed home, where they hoped Castiel, Gabriel and Michael would still be. As he was driving he had a multitude of horrible thoughts running through his head. That Lucifer had found out where they are from their mother, had broken in, and was currently holding them all as hostages.
He went towards the non-fiction section and went into Languages. There were multiple books on Chinese, Japanese, Italian, German and even Klingon, which didn’t make sense to Dean at all because the show the language came from was fictional. He rolled his eyes and continued forward until he found a bunch of books.
Castiel wanted to desperately know who was on the phone with his mother, she seemed a little shaken and despite what had just happened, he still cared for her wellbeing a little. But, he sat in his chair.
Dean nodded slowly and looked over at Castiel who was splayed on his back, snoring softly. He wanted to hug the other boy, tell him that he shouldn’t have to hide his scars; they weren’t something to be embarrassed about.
I'm actually really starting to enjoy writing this fic. So. Yeah. That's why updates are coming quicker.
“You guys can stay over again if you’d like,” Dean said, “mom doesn’t really seem to care to be honest.”
“I can hear you breathing,” the voice said, “how are you dear Castiel?” the voice asked, “oh, that’s right, you can’t talk...” Castiel could hear a cackle, which set his teeth on edge, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up and his palms began to sweat nervously. He waited for the voice to continue, but the sadistic cackling went on for a while.
“Mom’s already called the police,” Dean said, “We can get her to call again and tell them that he’s at your house-.”
It was just about dinner time when Gabriel and Michael announced that they needed to get some stuff from their mother’s house. They left; taking Mary’s car after saying multiple times that they would behave on the road and if anything happened they would take full responsibility for it.
He got out his books for Math and English and muttered something about how they should be doing homework, Castiel nodded and got out his own books, but he couldn’t help but feel a little sour for not being invited to talk within Dean’s rant.
Michael rolled his eyes, “someone could have seriously gotten hurt, you know what the Stoll brothers are like-.”
“Better make my stories more interesting then,” Dean said with a small laugh. Castiel simply glared at Gabriel, who winked at Castiel when Dean turned his back to get into the driver’s seat of the car. They all slowly got in, Michael being the slowest with his school bag full of text books. But eventually, they were able to leave the school building behind and head off towards Dean’s home.
The smell of pancakes and eggs wafts in through the air vents, strong enough to stir Castiel from stasis. Opening his eyes, he finds Dean’s half of the bed empty and the door ajar, morning light pouring in. A steady breeze pours in through the window, bringing with it chilled air and the promise of good weather for the day.
. The pain, the heartbreak, all they want is to be accepted and for someone to love them and tell them that it’ll be okay, and I do what I can, but it’s not enough. I can’t… I can’t go in and change people’s minds. I can’t protect them if their families find out. I’m putting them at risk in a world where they’re already threatened.”
Said feeling grows stronger when the man looks over at him, the brightness in his eyes hardening, jaw set square. He leaves the throng of bodies and disappears into the makeshift parking lot, sidling over to stand mere inches from Castiel’s shoes. He reeks of alcohol and smells like burning pines, and probably runs just as hot. Any other state, and this would be a proposition, but he’s angry, like he could pick a fight at any second.
“I was alone, until I found you.” He smiles, tears spilling free. Dean catches them before they fall. “I think I understand now.”
“I said I was giving them an early start to Labor Day,” Castiel says into Dean’s neck. Pulling back, he kisses the rise of Dean’s cheek, feeling him soften in his arms. “How are you feeling?”
For someone with little practical experience, Castiel is a master at first aid, almost to the point of leaving Dean trapped in his bindings. With some wrenching, he pulls the bandage hooks free and unwinds it, setting it on the counter after. In the mirror, the brand doesn’t look half as bad as it did yesterday, no longer inflamed and tender. He traces a finger across the edge, finding the skin soft and cool to the touch.
Castiel nods and continues flipping through the book from back to front. “It suits him, considering they acted as Odin’s messengers.” He turns a page and lands on a collection of koi, some shaped into a yin and yang, another swimming upriver with its fins caught in the current. He gravitates toward the latter and hands the book over, to Dean’s approving nod. “Have you done this one before?”
“A couple times.” Dean takes the binder, unsnapping the center rings and removing the page. He looks Castiel over once, appraising, then disappears around the curtain, leaving Castiel alone.
“Does his dad know?” Charlie asks. She pulls a knee up into the seat, hanging an arm over the back of the bench.
Through his blurry vision, Dean finds Castiel’s mournful stare. Anger flashes through his gut, but fades. No use getting pissed over it.
“I quit,” Dean says, dropping the phone into his lap. Castiel sits up, his brow pinched. “I quit, Cas. I’m done.”
“Just Penny, baby,” she says. She pats his shoulders, her gaze turning solemn. “Gosh, it’s good to see you. We’ve been missing you in church. All your daddy does is talk about how grown up you are now, too old to see your family.”
“I suspect Gabriel must have been the author, and intended to scandalize whoever found it,” Castiel continues. Pulling his fingers free, he strokes them down Dean’s chest, then up, drawing a nipple between his fingertips. Dean swallows a noise; heat rises, and a sweat breaks out across his skin. “There’s a spell detailing graphically, the method to achieve a ten-minute orgasm. Another, how to meld Grace with soul to achieve what’s called divine completion.”
“It’s not any different from any other blood sacrifice,” Castiel explains. “Cut your palm and press it to mine, then touch my shoulder.” To demonstrate, he removes his suit jacket and pulls his tie free, then unbuttons his shirt.
. “I’m working on it,” he says with a grin. “I’m better than I was last week, so hopefully you’ll see me back out here soon.”
“You have to learn empathy,” Castiel says. “Not that you aren’t empathetic already, but you have to learn to embrace their pain and reassure them. They’re children, and incredibly impressionable.”
Not once in his life has Dean ever had a place he could call a home. So far as he was concerned, Baby was the only home he had, and the string of motels he left in the rearview. Lisa was close, the Bunker even closer—but this, this is heaven incarnate.
Blessedly, Castiel’s classroom is empty when he arrives before eight, the halls quiet and disturbed occasionally by the muffled noise of a professor speaking through the walls. Key in hand, he unlocks the door and steps inside, leaving it ajar. The only class he has to teach this semester. His other two classes, he attends Mondays and Wednesdays, along with seminar every other Saturday morning.
Castiel considers that as Dean leaves. He dresses in his clothes from earlier and a pair of black socks, now that he can. His Grace has finally stemmed the flow of blood, but the wounds still remain.
Lips grace his neck again, sucking a deeper mark to the one Castiel already created. Panting, Dean struggles to shake his hands free; Castiel lets him, only to press his palms to Dean’s chest, sinking his nails into his pecs. “Fuck,” Dean moans and grabs his wrists, holding on. Their flesh meets again and again, and Dean mirrors it with his own noises, Castiel’s soft pants joining in.
Quiet, Castiel murmurs to Sonia while she continues to thrash around in his arms, probably even more terrified than the rest of them. Dean has been through this before—but that was decades ago, and in the tattered remains of a home on the west side of Kansas. John wasn’t around, and Sam was off in California, having the time of his life while hail pelted the Impala and Dean held the shelter door closed, praying to whoever was listening that he made it out alive. Then, the storm was right on top of him—now, it’s miles away, its path unknown, and all Dean can do now is wait for the end.
“I don’t want him to die any more than you.” Kneeling, Rowena taps her nails to his cheeks. “But you have to face the fact that he might not survive. If you have any amends to make, I’d say them now while he can hear you.”
Castiel shakes his head. “Not for who he might bring with him. I’m afraid we might need to take drastic measures.”
“I’ve named her Sonia,” Castiel murmurs, scratching one of her ears. “Someone left a box on our doorstep with her and a few toys in it. I didn’t know how you’d react, so I kept her in the garage.”
Dean shakes his head. “Feels like I’m using you,” he says. Sitting up, he braces his hands on either side of Castiel’s head and thrusts; gasping, Castiel grabs ahold of his shoulder, fingers horizontal over where once, a brand seared into Dean’s skin. Green eyes stare down at him, half-lidded, his mouth hanging open. “Not using you like that.”
It builds slowly, the inevitable rise. Dean sucks in air, taking Castiel’s hair by the root as the hairs across his body stand on end, as his muscles tense. His hand can’t move fast enough, the high so close yet not quite there. His balls rise, and his hips chase any friction he can get, namely as Castiel thrusts into his fist, grinding down onto him. But the second Castiel bites him, sinking his teeth into a bruise, Dean’s eyes roll back, breath robbed from his lungs. He moans, long and winded as his cock spills, and Castiel topples seconds after, shuddering his way through each breath, every pulse.
“It might hurt,” Castiel says, but Dean doesn’t care. The second cold air hits his cock, Dean stifles a noise and bites his knuckle.
This late at night, Dean can gather his nerves and throw his inhibitions to the wayside, especially when he knows Castiel won’t turn him down. He saunters over with a sway of his hips before climbing on the bed, crawling on his hands and knees to straddle Castiel’s waist. Seductive or not, Castiel swallows, his pupils dilating just the slightest, but enough for Dean to tell.
“Shit he says.” Pushing off the fridge, Benny pulls a package of frozen waffles from the freezer. “He tries to be careful, trust me, but you should’ve seen him in high school. Nerdy kid, used to hang out with girls. We played baseball together, but the other guys used to pick at him, call him names. I mean, I got a girlfriend, and but I got eyes too. He ain’t exactly unattractive.”
Supposedly, Lilith is hiding in the basement of the monastery—and Dean has never been more terrified in his life.
Heaven is a long time from now, and it can wait, because this—this is what Castiel wants. Dean is his—and he is Dean’s, for the rest of eternity.
Today, he makes it a point to create a space where the rest of the world ceases to exist. Throughout the day, he steals mattresses from one of the storage rooms in the basement and carries them to one of the empty bedrooms, spreading them out on the floor to cover nearly every square inch of space. He brings up blankets and sheets and pillows on his last two trips and dresses each one, layering them with mounds of mismatched bedding sets and additional blankets.
Touching Dean is easy, when Dean allows it. Gingerly, Castiel rakes the tips of his nails around Dean’s ear, then again from his forehead to his nape. A whine escapes Dean’s throat, one he’ll probably be ashamed of tomorrow. That doesn’t stop him from grabbing Castiel’s hip, though, his hand trembling. “You’re allowed,” Castiel says, hoping Dean understands. Comfort works both ways. Castiel doesn’t need it, but part of him has always wanted to be admired, especially by someone so beautiful, so holy.
Of the few kisses they’ve shared in the last few months, this is by far the best, purely from proximity. Dean holds him close, and Castiel dovetails their legs, their bodies pressed flush. Idle, Castiel trails his fingers down Dean’s spine, eventually settling his hand over the small of his back and teasing his waistband. The temptation is palpable, to reach down and cup him beneath his briefs, to feel the soft swell of his flesh.
“I don’t know why, but I feel like apologies are in order,” she says, but Dean shakes his head. It’s not her fault. She tried to help with location spells and her own brand of magic, but nothing came of it. “How did you find him?”
“I’ve come to terms with it,” Dean shouts. In the trees, a crow squawks, and squirrels flee from their nests. Spinning on a heel, he grabs Castiel by the knot of his tie, yanking him close. Castiel’s eyes shine, glowing the faintest bit in the dark. “You don’t think I haven’t thought about it for the last six hours? How you fucking—You betrayed me, man. You and your whole damn family, you strung me along for weeks. Months. You told me that you were trying to save the seals, and then you turned around and broke them anyway, for what? So you could have your little party and destroy the planet?”
“No.” Dean clenches his fists, knuckles blenching. “No, hell fucking no, Castiel. I’ve been dealt a shit hand, but I’ve never fucking… sold my soul to fix any of it.”
He shouldn't—really, he shouldn't even try, but he mirrors Castiel and touches his cheek, afterward running his fingers through his hair. Softly, Castiel sighs and closes his eyes. “When you crashed,” Dean says, low, “I didn’t know what to do. I just stood there in the pit box, and I couldn't—I couldn’t move. I saw them pull you out, and you were screaming, and I just—I thought, this was it, I’m about to watch my best friend die. And you fought so hard, you did everything you could”—his voice cracks, tears filling his eyes—“and they took everything from you, and I don’t want that to be me, Cas.
, Dean thinks. His tears might as well be flames, burning trails down his face. “You can’t just—You can’t just sit there and let him die, he didn’t—”
“Look, I know him, man,” he starts again. Swinging his legs over the side of the couch, Dean stands, unsteady on his feet. He needs sugar, and the snack cakes in the Impala barely count as food. “And Cas wouldn't run off if it wasn't for a reason.”
Which, Dean knows, but Castiel wants him to learn, and Dean can’t help but be a dutiful student. “Go slow,” Castiel says. He strokes through Dean’s hair, then cups the back of his head.
For all of Shiloh’s strength, he nearly breaks in that moment, his lip wobbling until he gains control. He’s strong, stronger than he needs to be for a man his age. “If you want, I can give you a card with numbers to call,” Castiel offers and fishes for his wallet. “My friend is an attorney in Atlanta, she might be able to give your mother some advice.”
Castiel presses a finger to Dean’s lips, his jaw set. “It’s too early for self-loathing,” he says, but edges closer anyway, much to Sonia’s disapproval. “You’re exhausted, Dean. All of your life, you’ve bounced from one crisis to the next, and you’ve never given yourself the time to cope or to grieve, or to process the things you’ve witnessed, that you’ve experienced. You live in a constant state of fight or flight, and the second you give yourself a chance to relax and to reflect, all you can see is the blood on your hands and the damage you’ve done.
Inside the property sits the wreckage of every mangled wreck in Pontiac and the surrounding cities, all of them irreparable save for a few. His heart breaks at the sight of every demolished Cadillac or Oldsmobile, and the one Nash in the corner that could be restored given the right attention.
“I know, honey. You don't think I’ve seen this before?” Sitting up, Missouri leans her elbows atop the desk. “As soon as they got that new preacher, I left. There’s a Presbyterian church next to my sister’s place on the other side of town that’s been a lot better to us than Pastor Adler ever was.” She sighs, palming her face. “Look at me.”
“Thought you were hungry,” Dean joshes. He pulls two plates from the cabinet and loads them with several biscuits each, layering them with gravy from the pot on the stove. A pair of forks later, and Dean sets everything between them. “Fastest thing I could make without throwing candy at you. Your blood sugar probably bottomed out.”
“What are we looking for?” Castiel asks after a while. He takes his hat off and brushes his hair out of his face.
The only ointment Bobby has in his entire labyrinth of a house is a questionably old bottle of aloe cream. It works as well as anything, staving off the burn long enough for Dean to move his arm without trying to bite his tongue off. Sitting at the kitchen table, Dean braces his elbows atop the aged wood and allows Castiel to work the medicine in, because for some reason, angels can’t heal damage that involves souls, or whatever Castiel calls it. Secretly, Dean thinks he just doesn’t want to.
Dean kisses him—or, bites him, really, but Castiel can’t bring himself to care, not while he climbs higher, brought to the verge by Dean’s touch and by his heat, how easily he gives in. His touch alone could tempt even the most chaste of creatures into sin, and Castiel gave in without hesitation, enrapt by the light of his soul, by the adoration in his hands. Orgasm feels like a blessing, and Castiel basks in it, his wings spread to their full breadth, his hips driving in, as deep as he can go. Dean praises him, and Castiel falls, sinking, seeking Dean out at his core.
They don’t speak again until Dean pulls on his jeans and Castiel is fully dressed. Halfway into his shirt, Castiel pulls him into a kiss, the angle awkward and stilted, but it exists. “You’ll need to focus your energy on her,” Castiel says, his forehead pressed to Dean’s. “All of it. Everything I’ve given you, you’ll need to cast onto her. She won’t go without a fight.”
Slow, Dean draws his arms around Castiel’s waist, fitting their hands together. He rests his cheek against Castiel’s nape, listening to him breathe, to the faint beat of his heart. “How’s your Grace?”
And to his shock, Dean nods. Terrified as he is, Dean’s soul reaches out, and Castiel comforts it, allowing his Grace to spill free. A blue-white light pours from each of Dean’s wounds, knitting his flesh together and leaving behind pristine skin. Only, the longer Castiel’s touch lingers, the more feedback he receives, an echo trapped deep within Dean’s soul that feels all too familiar—like his own.
“I know.” Setting aside his food, Dean wraps his arms around himself. “But I just—I don’t get it. I never hurt anyone, I never did anything wrong, and if anyone knew, I’d—They’d kill me, Cas. Couple guys in high school used to call me names, but they were the type that’d—”
“What if I wanted to?” Dean sucks in a breath, holding it until his lungs ache. “I couldn’t—I saw what you looked like. Someone tortured you and left you to die, and I couldn't—I wasn't gonna leave you there. After everything, that’s not how you deserve to go.”
“Talking,” Dean mumbles. Limp, he pats Castiel’s face, inadvertently poking him in the eye. “You ever stop talking?”
“You’ve been marked by Hell,” she exclaims, and Sam continues shushing her. “Whatever help you need, I can’t give it.”
“Birthday party,” Castiel says, fighting off a shudder. That explains the balloons and shouting parents. “Though, I’m sure there’s better restaurants in town for that.”
But nothing happens. The longer he lies there, the more he thinks about leaving to sleep on the couch instead. At least there, he can rest without feeling like he’s being watched.
Teaching seemed like a good idea at the time, until he got in the room and had to handle two crying girls and a boy with separation anxiety, the latter of which reignited several memories he refuses to address.
“I don’t give a damn about your orders,” Dean snarls. He squeezes Castiel’s tie with a shaking hand. “There’s people here, man. Families. Me and Sam and everyone else on this God-forsaken planet, and you wanna end it all just because God says so? Because your boss decides it’s time?”
“I’m thinking of heading out for a walk,” Dean announces around lunch, standing up from the kitchen table and stretching his arms above his head. His shirt rides up, and Castiel pointedly doesn't look, feigning his attention more on his half-eaten tuna melt. “You wanna come with?”
The second he parks his car, Castiel wishes he were anywhere but here. His father was right, Stanford would’ve been easier, would’ve catered more to his interests and helped him on his career path. But all the money in the world couldn't buy Castiel off, nor could it make him respect the man who force fed him lies and platitudes. Here, as far away as he can get from California, he can forget the rest of the world, forget where he came from and what his last name is, and start over, at least for his senior year.
“Yes and no,” Castiel murmurs. “The warding is incorrect. It won’t trap me, but it would inflict pain if I were to step inside.”
“I offered to drive,” Castiel says. He stretches, wincing when his spine pops. “Dean was insistent.”
, he berates himself. No matter how hard he tries, his eyes continue to sting, and the agony of living finally catches up with him.
Sitting on the toilet lid, Castiel admires him, how utterly peaceful he looks half-submerged in near-scalding water, his skin pink and the lines around his eyes relaxed. He reaches up to scratch his nose, then flicks water in Castiel’s direction, not even bothering to look.
He’ll probably feel it tomorrow, the raw edge in his throat that he can’t quite gargle away. But he can’t help it, even when Castiel begins to fuck his throat in slow, steady shoves that test Dean’s limits. Dean rocks his hips into the sheets, cock desperate for friction. It works—somehow, Castiel slips in that final few centimeters, and Dean noses the thick curls at the base, all at once sated.
Each time, Dean lets out a breath, sounding both enamored and terrified. He clings to Castiel wherever he can, gripping his shoulders, his hair, his hips, his fingers slipping on sweating skin. The surf slams into the shore, the curtains billow with the breeze, and Castiel sucks a mark to the curve of Dean’s throat, dark against the blue feathers.
The washing machine buzzes, cutting off Dean’s attempt at a reply. Hopping off his stool, he wanders over and starts pulling his wet clothes from the basin and tosses them into the dryer, all while Castiel talks.
“If you were truly a Nephilim,” Castiel adds, “or of immediate relation, you would be able to see my halo.”
In all of his wildest dreams, he never imagined it would feel like this, like heaven on earth, like the stars have aligned and their light shines down on him from above. Castiel touches him like Dean is ethereal and basks in his warmth, chasing his lips, the gentle press of his tongue against his own. Salt mingles. Dean hiccups, a laugh bubbling in his chest.
It’s quaint, really. Everyone nods and greets him as he passes, and some strum up conversations that in California would never have happened. About the weather, about the festival coming up next weekend, about the most mundane things, yet Castiel thrives on the sound of other people’s voices, the snippets into their lives. Small talk is easy when neither party will remember the other, but in this town, everyone knows their neighbors, and word travels fast. Anything he says is up for Sunday dinner conversation, if he doesn’t choose his words carefully.
“This ain’t the last time you’re gonna see me.” Taking his wrist, Dean presses a kiss to the center of his palm. “No one’s dying here, okay? So don’t give me a goodbye speech.”
The red reaches Dean’s ears. If they were alone, Castiel would kiss him. Rather, footsteps approach, and Dean takes both the necklace and the money and shoves the latter into his pocket. Castiel steps away, acutely aware of how close they’ve ventured, and ducks into another stall, just in time for a woman to wander in, about twice his age and apparently on a mission.
Dean could say something cheeky, just to rile him. Instead, he draws Castiel’s cock into his mouth, reveling in the hot, heavy weight. Slow, he sinks deeper and pulls back, a rhythmic motion that Castiel falls into, his hips rising up on occasion to meet Dean’s downward bob. Dean makes a show of it, purely for sport, to see how Castiel reacts.
. “Even if he never told me, I can see it here.” He touches a spot above Dean’s heart, then runs his finger down to his hip. Dean swallows, the corners of his eyes wet. “It’s curable, but I need your full cooperation. I’d also like you to be conscious.”
Castiel winds his way through a sigh. “I have no intention of falling in line with my superior’s orders,” he says. Dean can’t find it in himself to believe him. “I see now, what their plan was for you, for the both of you, and it’s destroyed your lives in the process. They intended to…” A pause. Castiel folds his arms, his jaw tight. “As soon as Lucifer is freed, they plan to send Michael in. They’ll be looking for vessels, you understand.”
“Alright,” Dean said hastily, turning his back to Castiel and looking out the far window, “goodnight Castiel.”
Dean rolled his eyes and shoved Gabriel back into the locker playfully, “did I miss anything this morning?”
“You’re probably wondering how I got in,” Lucifer said, “you forget that this used to be my high school – I know for a fact that during the day they never lock the back doors.”
Which, now that he began recognising his surroundings, wasn’t too far away. He took a left turn into their street and slowly made their way towards their house which wasn’t far from the other end of the street. When he finally got to the front of his house, there was an alarm going off inside.
Dean closed the door behind the both of them and pulled Castiel into the middle of the room by grabbing and holding both of Castiel’s hands in his. He smiled softly at him, before muttering something that Castiel didn’t quite hear. He cocked up a brow, trying to let Dean know he hadn’t heard.
He felt like he could calm down and actually breathe once he got into the shower and turned on the water. He washed his body with just the water and no soap; he didn’t know which soap he was allowed to use and he didn’t want to cause any type of inconvenience.
He felt as if Dean knew the same thing, and how uncomfortable the thought of his own weakness made Castiel, so he didn’t ask about it anymore, the only thing he said was, “you should start spending more time at my house.”
He knocked on the science class room door and entered when someone eventually opened it - hoping that the class would be interesting enough to distract him.
Michael grabbed Castiel by the arm of his jacket and pulled him out of the ring, Dean hastily following them as they made their way out of the hallway and out of the school building.
The thought of his mother sent a shiver down his spine. Should he really keep thinking of her as his mother, or more as the person attempting to send him to his death? The person before the executioner - the one that decided he didn’t deserve to live for whatever crime he had committed. Except he hadn’t committed a crime, it was the other way round. The executioner was the criminal and he was, unfairly, being sent to his death. That wasn’t what a mother was supposed to do.
Dean was walking down the stairs towards the school hall when he heard a loud, repetitive banging. It sounded like someone slamming the lockers. He rolled his eyes and rushed over to see what was happening, thinking that someone had been locked out of their locker again, but he was surprised to see, that when he got there, there was a large crowd of boys, most of them from the school’s football team, surrounded in a semi-circle around the front of three lockers. But when Dean looked over the shoulder of one burley football player, he saw that it wasn’t someone stuck with their locker.
Castiel was sitting by himself, on the ground, near the trash cans in the cafeteria. He had nowhere to go; he couldn’t find Michael or Gabriel anywhere; so he sat alone.
Castiel looked up from the crappy hospital sandwich that was made in front of him. You’d think after all the jokes made in books and sitcoms; they’d really attempt to make the food better. Dean was standing in the door way, smiling down at him, wearing a hooded jumper and some jeans, not exactly date clothing but he would do anything to get out of this goddamn room.
Sorry it took so long to update; I've been doing a lot of school work and I recently just finished another fanfiction, a Drarry one, and that took a bit to finish, but I promise to pay more attention to this fanfiction now. To make up for my absence, here's a 2,000+ word chapter, because I had no idea how to finish it at it's usual word mark.
“Where’s everyone else?” Gabriel asked, walking in without being invited. Michael followed in, seeming a little more hesitant about it. Castiel waited for a nod from Dean before he walked inside the house.
“Well,” Gabriel said, being pushed aside by Michael as he went to the fridge to pour himself a glass of orange juice, “there was a fight between the Stoll brothers, Jim and Nathan,” he said, “and any fight between the Stoll’s is a fight worth watching,” he then glared at Michael, “except Mr Self-Righteous here decided to get a teacher and break the event of the year up.”
Multiple times the Science teacher snapped at him to pay attention but after a few minutes Castiel would go back and enter his usual stupor.
As Castiel’s arms tightened slightly around his neck, Dean’s arms wrapped around Castiel’s waist, pulling him closer. When they pulled away, it was only to catch their breath, and then they were kissing again. Neither of them wanted to stop.
Castiel almost felt relief. He felt cooped up here, and tense, waiting for something to happen. But Dean looked uneasy about the whole idea.
“What did you guys burn in here?” Mary asked as she opened the door, holding some grocery bags. Chuck came in behind her, carrying a little more than Mary was and looking a little tired.
After a long talk with Gabriel, he had to admit he felt better even though he still hadn’t told him that he knew about Lucifer and how he was out. He couldn’t bring himself to even when Gabriel had been adamant about knowing. But just talking about things like school, even Gabriel’s music had helped him calm down.
“You need to keep your mind open and not think that he’s some sort of freak,” Gabriel said, still watching Castiel, making sure he didn’t wake up randomly during the middle of the conversation and hear everything they were saying.
He made his way back to his room at five in the morning, feeling calm enough now that he could sleep peacefully until he had to wake up for school, which he really wasn’t looking forward to. But it was a normal dreading, not so much fear anymore.
Castiel bit his lip. He hadn’t told Dean about the incident with his psychologically insane brother and the reason why he wore scarves all the time. Castiel simply shook his head and looked away, not really willing to talk about it. Not here in the cafeteria where anyone could walk past and read the notes. Besides, for such a dark subject, it seemed like the wrong background. It was too light, cheerful and innocent.
The coffee seemed to taste better than usual, the air seemed fresher, the grass greener. He felt more optimistic than ever.
He’d gone ahead and done it anyway; risking his friendship with Gabriel and his acquaintance with Michael, but only ended up closer to them than ever. They’d become...sort of like a little fucked up family.
“It’s always about your pathetic reputation,” the man muttered, “I don’t understand why I should do this for you. Why I should help you with this. You’ve done nothing for me.”
Then Dean took off, and Castiel wasn’t sure whether he was disappointed or relieved. He wanted to stick with Dean, who he knew had a different class to him right now. He felt safe with Dean; but he also didn’t want to put Dean in danger.
“Well I couldn’t keep you, now could I?” they heard their mother respond, “there was so much media coverage-.”
“Come on,” Dean muttered with a small smile, reaching forward and grabbing his scarf and dragging him forward by it. Castiel walked forward slowly but without hesitation.
Castiel went to hand him a note, but he just shook his head, “I said, name. Not note; so give me your name.”
Michael punched Gabriel in the arm, making the boy curse aloud. But Castiel preferred that Gabriel didn’t sugar coat that Castiel had gone to a mental school. He made it out to be funny, which Castiel felt was better than pretending it had never happened. He also made jokes about Castiel’s throat being slit, which made the situation also easier to deal with.
Dean shrugged, “we’ll be fine,” he said casually, almost as if he were talking about the weather. Mary sighed, rolling her eyes at Dean before shrugging the straps of her back onto her shoulder, “seriously, we will,” Dean said, trying to sound confident, “we’re tough.”
The next day after Gabriel, Michael and Castiel all went home, Dean went to the public library which wasn’t too far from his home. The weather was comfortable warm, so he just wore a loose shirt and a pair of jeans. Once he got in, the librarian gave him the evil eye. Dean guessed he didn’t look much like a reader.
“What are you doing Castiel?!” he heard his mother screech from behind him, “that was for someone else!”
Castiel bit his lip lightly, he didn’t really know whether he wanted to tell Gabriel, because this could end up going two ways;
“And now you’re sober,” she said, “and you can make up for your failures. Finish the job. If you get caught, at least you’ll go in as someone who completed the job, rather than someone who went in for a weak attempt at one.”
Dean smiled, “nothing, Ashton, for some weird reason, told the principal I’d never punched him; that he’d tripped down the stairs and face planted. I have a feeling your brother, Michael, had something to do with it.”
“I thought it would be nice to take you out here,” Dean said slowly, “and tell you that Lucifer was caught and he’s been sentenced to be in prison for a good forty years,” he muttered, “couldn’t get a lifetime sentence because...he didn’t actually kill you. But he’s down for violence against a minor and stuff like that,” Dean shrugged, “I don’t know about the technicalities.”
“Talk faggot!” Ashton Moseby said, slamming Castiel into the locker yet again, “we all know it’s an act you filthy-.”
He got out as soon as he felt clean and grabbed a towel to quickly dry himself off, there was a small knock on the door and he heard Dean’s voice, “I’m going to hand you clothing through the door, okay? Knock once if yes, knock twice if no.”
“We need to go home,” Sam muttered quietly, “it doesn’t feel right being here when Castiel, Gabriel and Michael are home alone and Lucifer is on the loose.”
“Also, Michael and Gabriel went home to get some of your things for the night,” Sam said, “and to tell your mom what happened at school.”
The TV was shut off before the rest of the sentence could come out of the reporter’s mouth. Dean held the remote in his slightly shaky left hand. But it was too late.
He sighed deeply, tried to groan, but all that came out was a weird choking noise, like food had gone down his air tube and not his food one. He wrapped his favourite scarf around his neck, despite the unbearably hot heat. It covered up the scars that Lucifer had left him with. It could make him look a little bit more normal.
“On a scale of one to ten, ten being worried parent, and one being ‘this could be bad for my reputation,’ how concerned do you think our mother will be?” Gabriel asked as they pulled up in the drive way of the Novak house. There was only one light on, and it was in the kitchen, they got out of the car and walked up to the front door, which was locked. Gabriel groaned, “Looks like we have to go around the back,” he muttered darkly, beginning to walk that way.
Dean wants to laugh. Wants to say it couldn’t have happened to a better person, but instead, he weeps, silent and soundless. Gentle thumbs brush away his tears, and lips press to his temple, too tender to be real. “I want my mom,” he sobs. Castiel shushes him, cradling his cheek. “Cas, I want my—”
Dean exhales, then shakes his head. “Buddy, you could be Barney the fucking dinosaur right now and I’d still love you.”
Sam watches him from the patio, his hands in his pockets and his lip between his teeth. Dean paces in the grass, his face glassy in the light of the moon, eyes turned to the sky. Contemplative—wondering if this is the right decision. If this is just another empty search before they pack up and leave in the morning.
“Besides the obvious?” Dean chuckles, shaking his head. “I’m fine, man. Just—freaked me out with whatever the… Were you groping my lungs?”
“I’m here to take you away from here,” the angel tells him. Silver knees clang against the stone floor as he kneels. Gathering Dean into his arms, Dean allows it, his feverish skin cooled by the chill of the angel’s armor. “My name is Castiel,” Castiel says into Dean’s ear. “Do you trust me?”
But that was a lifetime ago. A lifetime before the abysmal nothing of the Empty ripped him from Dean’s side, a lifetime filled with longing and fleeting touches, but nothing further. Castiel craves the intimacy, though, of just bring in Dean’s presence, of feeling his warmth. Of seeing his soul, most of all, and the way it longed just the same.
But Dean stays, tilting his head in just the slightest. Castiel can almost taste the alcohol on his breath, can smell the mixture of perfume and cologne clinging to his bare flesh. Desire, Castiel knows, but never before has it felt like this, sentient in his bones, controlling his movements. He waits for Dean to make a move. This is his territory, and Castiel is an intruder in his space.
Squeezing Castiel’s wrist tight, Dean nods. The world keeps right on its axis, the Devil is locked in his cell, and his family is here, alive and whole.
“We need privacy,” Castiel says with a shrug. “I needed to create a space where you could be vulnerable. I’ve warded the room to where no one will hear us.” Closing the door, a silver light rips around the frame, sigils flaring to life on the walls, then disappearing. Dean stares in wonder, his mouth hanging open. Castiel kisses him then, capturing his attention in full. “I need you to let your guard down,” he mumbles between kisses, feeling Dean nod. “I can’t heal you if you’re tense.”
“No, no, not that.” Dean scrubs his face, hoping that Castiel can’t see how deeply the red runs down his throat. “Not gonna deny it, people are into weird shit. Hell, I’ve dreamt I got fucked sideways by a dragon. I’m talking actual dragon, with the wings and everything. But that ain’t gonna happen, just like you’re not gonna rip out my jugular.”
For once, he doesn’t care. Typically he prides himself on his stamina, but after an entire lifetime spent without an orgasm, he takes what he can get. White-knuckled, Dean fists the shower wall and holds his breath, stroking the head of his cock as quickly as he can manage, acutely aware of the noise even above the shower spray. Hopefully, Castiel isn’t listening, because in the next second, he comes with a strangled moan, his spend hitting the tiles and spilling down the drain.
It needs work in some places, but nothing major. Maybe new wallpaper or paint in some spots, but it works. And Dean already has the keys in hand—all they need is to move in.
Happy. Ecstatic, even, with Dean at his side, alive, breathing, whole. Briefly, Castiel looks around the motor court, at the lone car in the parking lot besides the Impala and the lack of movement on the two-lane a few dozen feet away. The one weekend in winter when tourists don't flock to the first motel they can find, leaving them alone, wrapped in each other’s company.
Oh, right, his tape recorder. “That’s up to you,” Castiel mentions. “We could either continue talking, or you can opt out. You’ll still receive compensation.”
Nodding, Dean lies back, letting Castiel bear his weight. He closes his eyes against the candlelight and feels, shivering when Castiel’s hand cups him, stroking over the hard length of his cock. Gentle, at first, then tighter, with long strokes that mimic the tight clench when he’s inside someone, so warm and wet and inviting. He can almost imagine it, his cock thickening further, coupled with Castiel’s insistent press against his tongue. Experimental, Dean takes Castiel further into his mouth, then pulls back, lips smoothing over Castiel’s thick knuckles to his fingertips. He opens in invitation, waiting for those familiar digits, the ones that get him off so well, the ones that heal and break him apart and stitch him back together.
Minutes pass in silence, then hours. At some point, Dean wakes from a doze to find Castiel wandering, aimless, before he finds a new place to roost. Said place being the end of Dean’s couch, in the gap between the arm and Dean’s knees. The closest they’ve been in hours. Dean’s heart swells, just from proximity.
In the quiet, Missouri checks her phone and the monitor atop her desk, watching the classroom to see if anyone wakes. Meanwhile, Dean closes his eyes and breathes, silence meeting his ears. Slowly, the reality of the last two days washes over him, easing into his brain. Castiel didn't get up this morning, still hidden under the covers by the time Dean pulled on his nicest button-down and left. Castiel, his apparently teacher, shares a room with him—
“Mr. Winchester, I need you to breathe out as hard as you can,” a woman tells him with little sympathy in her voice. Dean does it anyway, coughing as she pulls the tube free in one smooth motion. His throat burns—his lungs more so, but the worst part is over with, or so he can tell.
“Sammy.” Setting his knife down, Dean leans his elbows atop the table. “I died. What happened, you couldn’t’ve fixed. And I know you tried, I saw what happened in the backseat. But that’s… It’s done, it’s over, and I’m back.” Sighing, he shakes his head. “It’s not your fault.”
“But why?” Dean blinks, his eyes welling over; a tear lands in the web of his thumb, spilling down to his wrist. “You gotta tell me, I gotta… Cas, I gotta know.”
.” Castiel taps his lip with the tip of his nail. “This is a holy act. It wouldn't kill you to treat it as such.”
“I left my wallet in there,” Dean says, leaning his head back to stare at the eave. “I had like… five hundred bucks.” More than enough to get out of this town and back on the road. And it’s a step closer to finding his killer. “And all my stuff. My laptop’s probably dead.” A thought crosses his mind. “You know where my brother is?”
Dean can’t quite pitch his voice deeply enough, but it makes it work with talent, his eyes never once leaving the fretboard. A few people gather around, namely all the women, including Tammy, despite the man chattering in her ear and playing with her hair. A few men join, and Castiel suspects that if the beat were faster, he wouldn't be able to hear Dean over the noise.
At this point, he could care less. Because between them, he holds Castiel’s hand, out of sight of the occasional pit reporter and photographer. Said pit reporter approaches the booth and signals to Castiel for an interview. Only, today, she doesn’t want Castiel.
Then, footsteps. Whipping around, Castiel finds empty air—then, pressure, fingers pressing into his windpipe, the back of his skull—
“Mary.” Castiel covers her hand, pressing his fingertips into her palm. “What his father did, that’s not why he’s here.”
“But you still left me there,” Dean hisses. He yanks out of Castiel’s hold and stumbles off the bed, heading for the bathroom sink. Running the tap, he splashes his face, thankful for the chill. Gripping the porcelain, he lets out a ragged breath. “How long was I in Hell?”
Of course he’s in pain, but not for the reason Sam thinks. Dean sucks in a breath and lets it out, slow, easing the guilt in his gut. It isn’t his business to tell, but Sam asked, and if Castiel had his way, he would never tell anyone, not even if someone threatened his life.
But nothing happens. In nothing but a pair of swim trunks, Castiel stands, water lapping at his hips and salt in the air. His wings glimmer in the sun, visible to only himself and the man rising from the sand, making his way into the surf. Arms wrap around his middle, drawing him in. Dean blows a raspberry into Castiel’s feathers, his joy infectious. “What’ll it take to get you to rent us some jet skis?”
Castiel sits there, running his hands through the feathers and brushing away the dirt and grime. Limbs that were once a part of him, but now lie dormant, rotting away in the shadows.
A voice begins to speak on his phone. Castiel answers it with, “There’s been an accident,” and describes the situation as clearly as he can muster. Never once does he look away from Dean, not until the ambulance arrives, and not even after.
“It’s not that,” Castiel amends in haste. Annoyance pinches his brow, his eyes narrowed like the ceiling personally offended him. “I’m afraid you might think less of me, if I show you… If I let you see it. It’s not…”
He closes his eyes, avoiding the sight of Dean tending to his feet. The symbolism terrifies him, and to be on the receiving end only amplifies his fear. “When I left two weeks ago, I drove to Spokane,” he starts. “I spent a few days in a cabin, miles from town. I wanted to feel the rain on my skin.”
Here, he just walks, like the weight of the world has been lifted, and Castiel finds him utterly approachable.
And then it stops. With a blink, Castiel comes back to himself, still wounded but healing. The storm rages on, threatening to rip the shingles from the roof. Among it all, Dean sobs into the dirt, and jerks away when Castiel touches him. Panicked—all Castiel can do is wait.
Castiel touches his wrist. Dean tries not to swallow his tongue. “Hey, Sammy,” he says, smooth as he can muster.
“Cas…” Dean sinks further into the bed, clinging to consciousness with all his strength. He needs to stay awake—he needs to talk to Castiel, to tell him… something. Everything. About the fear, the panic, the love in his heart, all of them warring with each other. Those words don’t come. Instead, something more horrifying works its way free. “You should’ve let me die.”
“Yeah, like you walked fine yesterday morning.” Dean still has the bruise from where he fell face-first onto the floor.
Closing the door, Castiel knees his way onto the mattress. He sits, facing Dean, his ankles crossed and his wings spread wide, no matter if Dean can see them or not. Based on the blankness in his eyes, he can’t. “I don’t understand,” he starts. His eyes travel to Dean’s hands, where he fidgets with his socks, a motion Castiel has never seen him do before. “Did you curse me?”
“You’re right, I don’t have to.” Reaching into his back pocket, he pulls three twenties from his wallet. “I want to. Even if you don't wear it, it reminds you of your mother, and that’s enough of a reason.”
Castiel nods. He carries a chair over from the room next door and plops it beside Dean’s. A crack runs through the seat, and a chunk of the back is missing, but it works. Somehow. “It appears that it was abandoned in the medical center parking lot across town, and a tow company moved it a few months later, after discovering that the vehicle hadn’t been occupied. There were bloodstains on the backseat, according to the police report.”
The noise of the television enters his senses, reruns of Magnum, P.I. now replaced with the Kansas City news. Dean’s warmth bleeds into him where they slot together, Dean’s front to his back and an arm around his waist. His fingers hang limp, resting over the soft fabric of Castiel’s sweatshirt. He must have changed clothes at some point, before they wandered into the ‘Dean cave’ and sprawled out across the couch.
“Shh.” Squeezing Dean’s hand, Castiel presses it to his lips, then his forehead in prayer. “I don’t have the answers you want, but we’ll figure this out.”
Castiel spins the sword, brandishing the handle toward Dean. Hesitant, Dean takes it and looks to Castiel’s wrist. “What about you?” he asks. “I could kill you.”
The only thing left to take from the cellar is the chest, which apparently weighs close to a hundred pounds. Somehow, Dean and Sam manage to haul it up the ladder and to solid ground, Dean doing most of the heavy lifting despite the twinge in his back. Castiel follows behind as they carry it across the yard and up the two steps to the porch. Sonia wails and claws at the screen, climbing halfway up before they can even get the door open.
Castiel has never felt his stomach bottom out into his shoes before, but he suspects this might be close: heart stuttering, stomach clenched violently, the air ripped from his lungs. Dean is dead, then—dead or close, and no one wants to break the bad news.
Dean joins him on the mattress shortly after, hair toweled dry and his heart anxious. Castiel faces him, his legs crossed, coat pooled around his waist. He looks softer here, more approachable when Dean can barely see his face. Inexplicably, he wants to touch Castiel, to see if he feels any different when no one’s looking. Part of him wonders if Castiel would let him—the other half knows he would.
Charlie nods along and pulls another individually wrapped Twizzler from her pocket. “So you’re doing the whole gamut? You know, life stories and all that jazz.”
Dean takes that as a sign. He starts out slow, unlike every porno he’s ever watched. A kiss here and there as he relishes the weight on his tongue, the heat whenever he licks across his slit. Castiel likes it there, especially when Dean closes his lips around it, tonguing the underside and applying enough pressure that Castiel’s thighs tighten around his head.
