Dean couldn’t disagree with that logic.
“That’s the best you’ve got, Winchester?” She responded wryly, as she turned on her heel and walked out, the rest of her retort echoing down the hall, “I’m a New Yorker first, American second, and Japanese third. I will bitch you out, shoot you in the ass, and then thank you for the privilege. Now get out here!”
It was while he was contemplating perhaps owning a fox-skin rug with a bead accessory that the door banged open and a surreally huge young man stepped in the backdoor. He looked a few inches taller than the already gigantic-seeming Dean, and his long chestnut-brown hair was pulled behind his ears. He looked around for a moment, while Dean crowed, “SAMMY!” before he lunged out of his seat. This, of course, was a poorly-thought out action, as he caught his shirt on the table somehow, and tumbled — head over feet — over the seated Gabriel.
Yeah, he watched that anime, no shame. Anime was an art form.
stuff.
Castiel had no sense of fashion, but he had heard some of the church youth talk about buying jeans
“His wife tried to stop him, but he bit her to get away and ran in front of a car.” Abram paled a bit, and swallowed hard. “The road had been slick with rain and poor Iggy wasn’t able to stop in time. The doctor was dead, his neck snapped.”
Even worse, it was opened by a dark-haired stranger with blue eyes, who just eyed him cautiously.
“Must be nice not to feel the temperature differences,” he muttered, jealous that Cas didn’t even shiver in the chilly air, and filling with desire for the slim physique that shimmied up the ladder, his back lithe and pale in the darkness.
“She” was a
right? Is
Dean turned to look, and, sure enough, Cas was walking down the stairway carrying several packages. He moved to help him, taking a few of the hot packages. “What is this?”
The hood, to Castiel’s embarrassment, was newly installed from when Castiel had moved in, a donation from his family to the church. Joshua had laughed it off until Castiel tried to make dinner and burned it so badly they had to order out and repaint the kitchen walls.
While he was mulling over his limited maneuvering options, the elevator stopped before reaching the ballrooms. To his surprise, the blond fellow got in with the bodyguard’s brusque permission. He reached out his arms and Michael removed his heavy pea coat and fancy bowler’s hat, placing his own dark gray leather gloves and light gray scarf in the crown. He then motioned for Dean to do the same, and, with some relief, Dean followed suit, removing the heavy extra layer of warmth. He already felt better without all the fancy furs on him.
Damn Mrs. Green anyway.
start to fade, the lethargy of his well-fucked body leaving him loose limbed and delightfully achy. While they were still tied together, he had wanted to share his hopes with Cas, maybe see if Cas would let him cling on to him after this little retreat, let him share at least some part of his future. So he opened his mouth to explain the situation with John, Sam, and their family.
and a wink at Dean, the umbrella twisted once more, and then fell to the ground, normal and completely still.
She hung her head, closed her eyes, and tucked her lips in together, appearing to try and collect herself. In her own measured tones, she said, “Fine. But tell me what will stop that tail from changing Dean into something else?”
Cas stared up at him, his hands at Dean’s waist, the tips of his claws scratching his back with small prickles that healed quickly. Those blue eyes, eyes like fancy tea sets, all bright blue on white and expensive beyond his reach, were growing redder again, only the faintest ring of that familiar loved blue left.
The steaks were all “aged” beef, prepared to perfection by a master chef. Dean just let Michael order everything since he was going to regardless, and he really couldn’t go wrong with steak. Dean did hold on to the menu in order to eye their dessert offerings (they were in friggin’ French, for fuck’s sake), and as he tried to figure out if the one that said
“This is Bobby.”
Sometimes, it was warm, smooth hands that worshiped Dean’s skin as if it were precious, thumbs brushing against his jaw or bottom lip as if Cas couldn’t believe he was real. Sometimes it was soft kisses across and down Dean’s back, often following the knobs and dips of his spine, such care taken to cover each inch he knew he never had been–nor would again be–touched with such reverence, as if Cas were trying to memorize his every freckle, his every muscle.
“Never said you did.” The man hummed and stared at Dean until Dean shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. “But there
Dean shrugged. “It helps he at least knows who I am. Makes a difference.”
Dean could see how sad his words made Cas, but he was too angry to give a fuck. “You triggered my heat and I can smell your rut coming, but you want to
All he could think was he needed more, even as the Wolf snuffled in, his tongue going so deep and licking him clean of slick…
Suddenly to his left, there was the retort of a shotgun as Sam pumped the blue big guy full of rock salt, which did little to slow him down, and shouting to his right, as Akira chanted something that put a stop the red guy’s momentum.

Dean smiled. “Let’s check it out.”
He was going to kill Crowley the next time he saw him. IF he saw him again.
The question surprised Dean, and he narrowed his eyes suspiciously at his brother. “Why… is there something
Sam blushed and got flustered, smacking at the pointed finger. “Yeah, sure, Dean. Let’s
And it was something Dean would actually like fixed. He really couldn’t apply for jobs if he stank to high heaven, and using suppressants and scent blockers like he’s
“Dean, they are talking to you.” Blue eyes glowed faintly with amusement, and Dean snapped his attention back to Benny. “Wut?”
“Guys,” Dean interrupted. “Over here. Can’t Russian. English please.”
She flew free of the houses and dead metal beasts, and ran from the town itself. Although she had just fed, she was still weak and needed to go to ground. Regardless, she was curious about this new land, this new human place. It stunk of deep-set pollution and spiritual degradation; there was no purity, like in olden days, and she doubted anyone here would even believe in a baku.
“You might want to sit down for the rest of this,” Cas said in a casual voice, that, somewhere inside, Dean recognized as a bad thing.

He opened his eyes again, and, surprisingly, found the boy and omega still standing there warily. Distantly, he noted that the omega’s eyes glittered green in the afternoon light, his freckles dark against his skin, paled with anger and fear, and, when another faint breeze swirled past him, it carried his sweet scent to Castiel like a trial from God.
“So, the doc was still himself, while this… Danny guy was too sick to even move.” Dean’s eyes darted between the brothers. “That means he was unlikely to have killed anyone, if he couldn't move.”
Was that why Joshua asked him about Sam? Was just the left over scent clinging to Sam enough to send him into an early rut??
“Hush, Yana,” her mother scolded. “Один из них говорит по-русски.
What was the point of being “special” if he had to be alone?

He heard Sam scream, “Dean!”
He smirked, a low sardonic chuckle coming from his chest. “But I

Shesh shrugged and took another sip. “It’s the name of the bear mascot at the Russian Olympics,” he said slowly.

“‘Kay.”
In this form, she would be mistaken for a large, wild pig with a long nose. Hopefully, humans would overlook her and leave her be.

Whatever was going through his head was a Big Deal.
: [FIGURE/ACTOR] Because Dean and them haven't met the Trans yet in this story, I went with the lovely Michelle Yoeh, who has been in several Chinese action flicks that Dean will have probably watched. (INCLUDING the Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies)
When he emerged, Benny was sheepishly standing a few feet from the door. Dean rolled his eyes and hefted his gym bag of goods.
in here nowadays.”
Sam laughed softly at their banter, but soon grew serious.
Cas frowned. “So not rabies.”
He called out in a half yawn, “Cas, baby, you there?”
He pointed the flashlight at Cas, who didn’t even flinch or blink in the sudden light.
When Akira got clear, Gabe released the oni’s arm and leaped towards Dean. Gabe knocked his shoulder into the blue oni’s back with all his strength and watched him stumble forward, only to trip over Dean and smack into the barrier face first.
Benny rolled his eyes, and Abram poked him with his elbow. “Yes, Nikolai, of course.”
Meanwhile, John continued to leave them for unspecified amounts of time, but sometimes—while he was gone—the boys got lucky and got to stay with friends: Missouri, Bobby, or Ellen. It was an endless round of pull-out couches and air mattresses.
“She’s only been dead for a couple of hours,” Cas said helpfully.
Meanwhile, the giant red man was apparently not prepared for a huge fox to come leaping out of the hole and biting his ruddy arm viciously. The red man howled, attempting to shake off the fox, but Gabe just bit down harder, making sure Akira got out of the hole in one piece.
And, of course, Gabe
Dean shivered some more and finally said, “C-can we get some of that wing action? I’m freezing here.”
Cas peered up at him with a sad puppy expression that nearly put Sam to shame. Dean didn’t care, both his hands fisted on Cas’s chest and grinding back on the hardening cock he felt under his ass, slick starting to slide from him in preparation. “What do you want me to do, Dean?”
But his weekend in the brothel was done—even if it was already 4 a.m.—and he was finally home. Dean sighed as he put his leather jacket down on the back of the couch and then threw himself with an exhausted sigh onto the couch. He had a couple of bruises on his hips from the alpha’s grip and a hickey the size of an apple on his right shoulder where the bastard had gotten overly excited by his scent and tried to bite him. He had only missed because Dean had been watching him in the mirror and jerked away at the last moment.
to stay on the premises, help clean the building, help out with the advertising, and essentially work for their upkeep (they didn’t all have to prostitute themselves). For their own safety, Crowley allowed them out to the movies and such only when accompanied by two or more trusted alphas, like Benny, from his personal security force.
He spat out, “Pureblood!”
“Missouri?” Sam asked, his voice small and unsure, eyes huge in his pale face. “It’s going straight to voicemail…”
Not surprising, the tiny tenement room is filthy, with newspapers used to make bedding and clothing stuffing. They're both surprised the whole place hasn't gone up in flames when it's evident the tenants had been using candles to heat tinned food and keep warm. The nasty, cheap kind of candles too, the sort that stink of petroleum and stain everything black.
“So, what’s her name?” Gabriel pulled a chocolate bar out of his jeans’ pocket, unwrapping with casual ease. “Is she pretty? Are you leaving the fucking church and finally getting laid?”
The trombone adds an impromptu long, sad declining note.
Sam grinned at him brightly, and said, “Hi!” while Dean just nodded at him, a dark expression on his face. It wasn’t favorable foreshadowing for how the afternoon would pass.
cursed. Anyway, we live in a consumer world. We are all going to Buddhist hell. (Just kidding)
“Neat-hog?” Dean scowled at him. “Is it some sort of magic pig thing?”
The same was said by the myriad bystanders, apparently too shocked by the bold attack to do anything except gawk. The detective he spoke to also suspected the culprits had set up a diversion by placing a bag with a block of clay and a clock at the other end of the airport, calling it in immediately after Dean’s flight had disembarked.
Nodding, Castiel pulled out his phone and turned it on. It buzzed lightly, indicating there was a message, and when he looked, there was a missed call from Gabriel.
“I’m hungry,” he said flatly, walking out of Michael’s reach and into the building.
“Oh, her.” He remembered the cold fish. “Yeah, she hangs out with Michael, I guess?”
Mr. Edwards’ awning had needed a new piece to make it retract, so that had gone on his shopping list along with more mac and cheese, milk, and some Lucky Charms for Sam.
“Fine.” Dean stuck out his hand. “Deal. Make it happen.”
He had gotten up at 1 p.m., checked the door in case they dropped off a list of broken crap in the trailer park for him to fix. There had been. Mrs. Green had somehow broken her oven, could he please stop by? And Mr. Edwards had tried to put away his awning and had broken the handle.
He was unprepared for Dean’s hugging him, which hurt like the devil in too many ways. He awkwardly patted Dean’s back, and thought he heard him mutter under his breath, “You blue-eyed bastard. Don’t do that again!”
Generally a string of beads set in a pattern of 10 small beads, 1 large bead, where the small ones are prayers to the Virgin Mary (Hail Mary) the big one is preceded by an Our Father and a ended on a Glory Be (prayers to God the Father and latter to the Holy Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and it's used to help count out the 5 decades of prayer typical for a full rosary; the reenactment or recitation of Jesus Christ’s arrest through resurrection; an affirmation/promise that you are a believer. <- not important
“I don’t understand,” he panted, “It’s
Dean pushed himself up and muttered bitterly, “What’s this? Are you modeling for some douchebag hipster calendar, or what?”
“I neve–” Cas stopped–head snapping up–and stared at Dean, his jaw dropping open. “You thought I had
It felt like a small victory for his pride when he was still able to attend the dinner after smelling salts were applied and he was found to be physically fine and his clothing free of bile.
“Yeah, Cas stole the paperwork for me. I just had to tell him what to look for and where, and he managed to dig it up.” He grabbed the file that was sitting on the coffee table. “It says… yeah, I can’t say this. I’m gonna spell it. But first name is ‘Misha.’” He eyed the name again. “
Like the twins, Castiel was dreading Michael’s return home although it was for different reasons. The twins hated how uppity Michael got. Castiel disliked how competitive he got.
He was so done with this shit. If only it didn’t mean the end of the fucking world.
Joshua nodded. “But you were next to Sam for the past couple hours?”
A tall, dark-skinned woman with striking golden eyes and a small man with ice-blue eyes and way too much blond hair stepped into the kitchen, both dressed impeccably in black beautician outfits that tied at their waists.
In desperation, he threw on some rainboots Bobby kept by the door (there was water in the bottom of the boots, but he just dumped them out and winced at the wet) and ran out to Gabriel’s grove.
This, however, took a second seat to the steaming cup of something smelly sitting on the kitchen table when he finally made his way towards the backdoor. The small mug sat innocently in the middle, reeking so horribly, Dean imagined cartoon demons flying out of it.
Dina swanned away and Cas handed his stuff to Jo, who slapped him on the back hard for his troubles. “Told you we’d get in trouble,” she hissed as she walked away with his stuff.
“Tonight?” Dean asked in a perfectly reasonable voice, and not the high-pitched squawk others might have heard in the hallway. “
is basically a shaman.
“Not likely,” Lucifer chuckled. There was sound of texting, and Castiel gave a (muffled) groan because he knew what that meant, and it was verified by the sound of feet running down the hall.
From the top of the dresser, a small caw sounded, and he spun to find the raven sitting on his dresser.
If HELL was a dingy bar with a stage and dance floor, and Purgatory looked like a fancy 19
His story was interrupted by a slim hand slamming over his mouth. “Ix-nay on the oat-Gay!” Jo hissed, flicking her eyes towards Ellen and shaking her head.
Dean kept walking, waving his hand so Bobby would know he had heard him.
"But it doesn't seem like it affected them not woged as it did when they were woged. I wonder what they looked like woged?"
“Out of practice, old man? It’s been, what? Twelve hundred years since you last got laid?”
No, that was the issue with ‘Heat’: the chemically manipulated, higher concentration of pheromones were addictive and immediately forced the alpha into a false rut. The feeling was a wild and instant high that supposedly felt like the brink of an orgasm
“Oh I like this story already!”
He choked back his tears, and knocked his head against the steering wheel, wrapping his arms around it, holding on like it was life or death. After a moment, with the sound of the city breathing heavily into the silent car, he whispered, “I’m so sorry, Baby. I didn’t mean it.”
Cas nodded and Dean looked up to find Abram and Benny watching them closely. He smiled warmly at them. “I have some police training. I was a police recruit for a hot minute, but, y’know, stuff happens.” He made himself look sad and pathetic. “But I can help out with this investigation.” He looked over at Klim, Nika, and Lev. “Where are the bodies?”
He suddenly recalled the latest victim, and stuck his hand in his pocket, pulling out her necklace. “Actually, I just took this off the last body we saw.”
They rarely sold tail in HEAVEN though; the main attraction was the high-priced collection of slick, the finest on the black market. An ounce of the highest-grade, organic slick could sell for as much as $100,000, and the alphas could enjoy their indulgences in private rooms with happy omegas, the best slick, and all other debauchery to ease their needs. They could also lounge with others and smoke the slick through finely crafted hookahs, designed to draw the best essence, leaving alphas blissed out on fine hormones while lying across couches, leaving prostitutes or lovers to tend to their needs.
. Dean plastered on his pleasant face, smiling winningly at them. “Hello! I am your server for tonight, Rocky!”
“Alright, well, let’s do this. You two bring him here, but don’t tell him exactly what we think is going on. We’ll all talk when he gets here. Okay?”
When he came back out, Sam was sitting in the small dining area, sulking over his chocolate milk, and pretending to read Bulfinch’s Mythology.
Nervously, Dean sat completely up, cross-legged and comfortable with the white-blanket/tarp thing around his shoulders. Near him was a small red-clay tray, like was used for holding a potted plant, with a few small carrots with long leafy tops, a miniature apple, and what looked like cherry tomatoes.
They get him into his apartment, Sam snatching off their hats and tossing them on to the two cots tied together with a blanket in the gap, and a pillow taking up the blank space in the middle.
Frowning, Cas said, “I can’t d–”
Yeah, if you don't know, this company makes gorgeous lingerie. I went looking into different lingerie companies, and none of them were quite what I wanted, so... the somewhat more conservative La Perla it was. *ahem* (Lingerie is ridiculously priced in general, IMO. But hey! If it makes you feel gorgeous, do it!)
Cas fluffed up to his largest size, opening his mouth and puffing out his tail.
Abram, who had moved back with his buddies to drink and talk while they ate, again sat near them, this time Benny coming with him. Benny, it turned out, was shorter and stockier than his brother, having a large paunch that he occasionally rubbed affectionately, as if it were his buddy. His own unruly head of brown hair was like a bird’s nest along with his giant beard, making him look remarkably like a much shorter Hagrid. Nika, Lev, and Klim stayed at their table, nursing their beers and discussing taking a sauna at Klim’s house later, since it was his turn.
“Andrei, Semyon, and Arina are all missing. Andrei and Semyon went missing after church, but they walk through the forests to get to their homes. Arina, like we said, was taken from her yard. We have nothing on them, not even a blood stain.”
As it was, Dean was counting on Cas at least being able to feel several souls hunched together over a campfire, and it felt like luck when, finally, they found a small group of kids between the ages of four to fifteen at the edge of the river, fishing and collecting what looked like either shiny rocks or bait.
“Dean, how are you?”
He had been alone. In Heaven, he had always been alone. But not anymore. He brushed a trace of possessive grace over his Basherter, familiarizing himself with each atom of his body, brushing his soul. And, there! It flared up for him, tiny tendrils of Dean’s soul reaching back to him. He could search the earth and all of Heaven, and never find another human soul so bright!
“Dean’s friggin’ heat,” Sam said, gagging. “The smell sticks to everything in the trailer. We’re going to have to wash the curtains!”
Cas nodded. “
Castiel started to reply for the Omega until a steely set of eyes settled on him, and his mouth snapped shut with a click. Joshua noted that faint red swirl making yet another appearance, and his eyebrows bucked up with interest.
When the seal cracked open on the Yumekui, the Baku had trilled with delight and leaped from her prison. She had been sealed inside a scroll, bound in a bone case with more seals over it. A tengu had been watching her the whole time, but it didn’t matter now. She was free.
The young man was obviously hiding something. Joshua filed the information away. “And your father, where is he?”
) snapped from the bar, “Benny, shut your mouth. You’ll scare our guests.”
It had huffed at him and then
Another howl, somewhere to his left, and Sam was reciting sutras as fast as he could. Dean ignored it, hearing Akira also desperately trying to keep the creature still and near losing, as the red oni had kept its grip on the club and it was definitely moving now.
Sam shrugged and avoided his eyes.
. He hissed at the pain, and hoped Gabe’s weapon of choice tonight — what looked like a fancy sword on a stick — was going to work out okay.
Dean (gently) shakes his head and says, “I ain't leaving you, kiddo. It'll take more than some bullets to stop Dean Winchester.”
Cas hugged him from the side, and he just leaned into it. “
At least, that was what he
Wesen was gonna be so hard.”
“I’m warming you some food.”
. That’s just sick.”
Although it went against some submissive part of him, Dean didn’t care. He pushed the Alpha again, and watched as Cas lost his balance as he tried to back away, as the white blanket thing caught his feet, pulled away from his hips and thighs. Arousal zinged through Dean at the beautiful hips and the large half-hard cock of his True Mate. He ignored his instincts, still angry, and straddled Cas’s waist to poke him with his own clawed hand. “I’m not going through that again. I don’t care about your promises to God! You were promised to
And Dina did. Her hair was smoothed over her head and swirled into an elaborate updo, her makeup emphasized her smoky quartz eyes and full lips that most of her children had inherited, the elegant lines of her red dress fit her impeccably, with simple diamond drops at her throat and ears, and her wedding band as her only jewelry.
A hand or two went up, and one of the older Shintoists said, “It’s a summons for a nue.”
He yanked off his belt and got his erection free, staring at it, betrayed. Filled, it hung huge, heavy, and hard between his thighs, its insistence painful, as the deep-red head tapped at his belly. He randomly thought about how graceful
“Because I’ll be 18 in a couple of weeks, so I-”
For that reason, the Church was primarily made of betas or alphas with strict control. Very few omegas took to the cloth because they had to stand in front of mixed and diverse gender designations, and most alphas wouldn’t take orders from an omega. Most omega priests ended up serving in seminaries and monasteries. Some ran schools, since it wasn’t that they couldn’t run things, but that alphas tended to try and dominate them at every turn, and it was a sad truth that many omega priests had been kidnapped from the churches and never returned.
She handed over the dish and threw a flirtatious grin at Dean as she walked back into the kitchen, missing her mother’s tired sigh and accompanying eye roll. “Teenagers,” she said. She pushed the plate of pirozhki onto the table, and Dean’s mouth watered at the smell: meat. There was
This was punctuated by a loud thump that had Bobby narrowing his gaze at the ceiling suspiciously and Sam rubbing the back of his neck.
“Hey, those are for cross-cultural appreciation.”
“Where’s Dean?” Castiel spat. "Did you take him?"
“Hey,” Dean muttered, “If I saw that my snacks had been eaten and my best booze gone, I’d pitch a fit!”
"Well, I suppose that rules out werewolf at least." Dean dropped his head back against the couch and said, "Those guys won’t touch the liver. What shreds its victim and eats the sweet meats?"
“Which is?” Dean prompted.
He rubbed a paw over his white muzzle idly and finally said, “Ah, what the heck. I’ll do it!”
The meal went quickly because Dean responded to everything Michael said with noncommittal grunts. Although the eggplant parmesan was good, it wasn’t Mrs. Miller’s triple-beef lasagna just for him and Sam. The breadsticks were really nice, but they weren’t Missouri’s toasty garlic bread when she cooked for them once a week, checking in on how they were doing. The wine wasn’t a plain old beer.
“Gabe,” he muttered, “What the fuck is she doing? It feels gross.”
Dean paused in his fuming to glare at Benny. “What exactly does that mean?”
Joshua was sure to keep Castiel under constant surveillance with Sam, adding Kevin as a buffer and watchman. They were both eager young men, with Kevin contemplating the priesthood for himself. He was only thirteen himself, so Castiel didn’t push the issue or discourage it. If he received The Call, he would know.
, only to stop dead at the sight of a new ‘gift.’
Dean threw the damp dish drying towel at Sam’s head, leaping on him to mess up the mop of brown hair while Sam howled at the icky towel. “Don’t you try and act all grown up with me! Pretending you’re better than a surprise gift and shit! You’re
“Well, whatever it is, it’s ugly.”
Whatever. The brown-haired omega was leaning into the touch, nearly purring, while the alpha mostly watched the two dancers.
They took their seats (Michael actually holding the chair out for Dean to sit.) and Dean stifled more irritation at the host saying, “Your order will be out in a moment.”
“What did you find out, Bobby?”
He was about to start whimpering when a hot tongue began to bathe his shoulders and back, covering him with the scent of linen and apple pie, with the aroma of aroused molasses twining in, as Cas completely moved down Dean's naked, supine body with long, lingering,
Dean rushed to his side, and now the creature was furious, kicking at the black film that surrounded it, until a claw finally ripped it open. The creature fell to the ground with a wet, heavy splat, unable to move much and covered in foul, dark dead blood, but struggling regardless of its incomplete form to move in their direction.
Dean has to muffle more laughs as Sam pinches his lips together and says with wounded dignity, “I'm going to get some take out. Chinese okay?”
But then Michael was talking to their siblings. “So, Dean, darling, these are my brothers, the twins, Lucifer and Gabriel. Stay far away from them, they’re trouble incarnate. And this is my lovely sister, Hael. She’s in graduate school so we don’t see her very often.”
The alpha had laughed, his tongue blue. “If this is your negotiation strategy, you need to up your game.” He had taken another sip from his Slurpee and said, “Blowjob.”
soul?”
“You can’t do this, Cassie. If you’re caught, you’ll be eliminated. You’ll be kicked down the totem pole so far, you’ll be the point stuck in the dirt.”
The boy with the floppy hair squinted at him with obviously unpresented gray-green eyes and asked, “Yeah, I want to know how to become an altar boy?”
Hael tittered nervously as Lucifer sighed the sigh of the heavily put upon.
Dean nods, rubs the back of his neck apprehensively, and blurts, “I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Dean ducked his head and stared at his lap as he arranged his napkin, his lips pressed together into a thin line of frustration. Finally, he murmured, “Do I have a choice?”
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose and slumped over. “Look,” he sighed, “Dean is my True Mate. I...I can’t seem to help myself.” He grimaced and mumbled, “And dear God, I tried. You have to believe me. I tried.”
But his feet were already moving forward.
The brothers grinned at him knowingly and slapped him simultaneously on the back. “Da, the clinic. Let’s go!”
Dean scowled. “First of all, what the hell is a sue-ku-thingy and, second of all,
He lost count over the days how many times he had woken up, growling Dean’s name into his pillow and grinding his erection into the unsatisfying sheets.
Castiel frowned. “I don’t know why that is significant.”
The duvet smelled like dust and he coughed into it, deciding not to move when he heard the door swing open and a smooth, warm voice murmur, “Well, well, well. Look at what the cat dragged in.”
Dean ignored it and the apple, drinking down the water and crawling back into bed to try his right hand again.
, evil spirits, and they possessed him.”
“Huh, I didn’t know they even bothered with the bodies. I kinda thought they just ate them.”
Restraining his urge to punch the man and run, Dean looked over at Laura, who nodded and winked at him.
She licked the blood off her claws and smiled at him triumphantly, eyes gleaming with madness. “I guess I’m not the only one to lose something precious.”
Dean shuddered and tried to back up, only to find himself backed against the Lark. “Deacon Castiel,” he tried, his voice unsteady. “Sn-snap out of it. You’re a man of God, right?”
Dean blinked, surprised he even still had a scent. “I-I…” he stuttered.
Irritation sung through Cas like a choir of crabby angels, and he bit down on his immediate desire to respond, “Fuck no. Coffee now, or no sex for a week.”
A cruel smile slipped over her human lips at the thought, when she finally found it.
“My name is Ichiren-Bozu, not…
(well, not SHE'S gone. This also caused me to walk around muttering "And I know, I know, I know..." for like a week.)
He pulled out his silver lighter (a Grimm’s investment piece) and primed the flue with a bit of rolled up newspaper, but not before checking the date.
Probably more so because Castiel
But his body was in agony as he tried to stretch his arms forward to crawl, even the joints of his fingers protesting the movement against the warm, soft earth he was laying on, and a louder, more piteous whine escaped him, one he would deny to his dying day, that he didn't get very far. He collapsed face first into the warm earth.
Dean dropped a kiss onto Cas’s head and whispered, “And yours was to guard the Yumekui.”
Dean bent down and looked over Nikolai’s flushed face. He was dewed with sweat, and he looked a bit sickly. “Aw, shit. Are we too late?”
Actually, because he couldn’t smell anything, he didn’t even

Now, there was a reason why Colonel Robert Singer had not been promoted in the main office, despite his longevity and efficiency. The reason he was given his own small command in a different building, on the other side of Downtown: he failed to play the sycophant game.
“Well, call me whatever you want, but don’t call me late for dinner.”
“Like I keep telling you, Gabriel is not just any kitsune. He’s a rare nine-tailed fox. He is immensely powerful, and he likes humans. But he’s mercurial so we must be careful.” He waved at Gabriel again, who was just grinning happily and chewing. One of his tails had popped out in his joy over the tofu and was wagging almost supersonically.
much.
“Fine.” He intoned, stretching a bit, “Let’s get this over with. Otherwise, the pixies–or something worse–will find us anyway.”
Dean nodded and slowly sipped his tea. “Cas and I will take a look later. No one will mind, right?”
He threw himself petulantly onto a kitchen chair, taking care to bring his coffee with him, and said, “Well, and Cas told me some story about the Baku used to be a divine beast or something.”
“It’s a nice dick, at least,” Cas offered quietly, obviously not quite understanding the twin looks of utter horror on Dean and Sam’s faces, or why Gabe was laughing so hard, he nearly choked on his candy.
A small blonde woman stood there, her eyes going round. “Who the hell are you?” She snapped out.
“It may go against the grain” Akira had said, her caramel colored eyes intent, her polish-free fingernail poking Dean in the chest for emphasis, “But you
Pasting on a smile, Castiel looked up to through the open privacy window and at the rearview mirror. “Horrible. The turbulence was dreadful.”
Cas smiled and leaned up to kiss him. “Let’s get you fed,” he muttered, slipping away from Dean to get the pies.
“No, of course not. It’s just… something
Michael huffed softly. “Let me assure you that everything I’ve chosen is their best offerings.”
On the leather couch of the living room, he found Michael loading up a very pricey-looking hookah with what looked like Slick.
It didn’t matter, anyway. Sam reported that
Dean shivered and rubbed his hand where Michael had been sniffing, annoyance and a tinge of fear coloring the movement. He was used to handsy alphas downstairs, but he could fight if he needed to in Purgatory. In HEAVEN, he wasn’t allowed to fight. The customers were too well off; the money just too good.
“About..?”
You’re embarrassing yourself!”
No one had heard Him, not since the humans had learned how to sail across the vast expanses of water and make that land their own, whether or not the previous inhabitants minded.
Dean eyes the hand and wonders if he's still dreaming. He takes the proffered hand and it's warm and smooth, the grip firm.
Bushy brows jumped up into the cap again. He peered at the bird, who was asleep on Dean’s shoulder and making tiny bird snoring noises like a toy whistle. “Looks like ya wiped Feathers out.”
The old man tutted and shook his finger at them. “See… that’s the
with the bird. Admittedly, the air of pure burning embarrassment that swirled around the tengu was worth watching. It was, however, the fondness in Dean’s eyes — even as he roared with laughter, throwing his head back, and patting Cas on the back — that made Sam wonder (weirdly) if his brother actually wasn’t crushing on a three-foot-tall magic bird demon from Ancient Japan™.
Dean gave him a shit-eating grin through his panting, and gasped, “Hard work and dedication.”
when Castiel received a call from his mother.
The trees were not the same: there were no bamboo or glowing maples, and she couldn’t scent a single black pine, just ones that were similar but not quite right. She looked at her form, still the ethereal chimera and not suited to living in the rough environment of the woods. She shifted into her other form, shaped like an animal, but it was uncomfortable because nothing smelled right, and she was afraid of wild beasts finding her. Desperate, she changed into her human form, which was better. The smells were not as strong, the feeling of pure wrong not as bad. She was cold, as was expected from human flesh. But it was tiring. The surge of energy taken from her savior, the luck ingested, would not last long. Perhaps for a few hours.
Ellen slapped her upside the head as Castiel laughed. “It’s fine, Ellen. I know what she means.” He shook his head too. “God works in mysterious ways, Jo.”
Dean said, “What?” He picked up the telescope and looked towards the penthouse, and, sure enough, that piggy bitch was standing in the window, just grinning at them, waving one hand. He saw her lips move, and she winked, walking away. He gritted his teeth and put down the telescope.
“I’ve been employed to make you two suits and a tuxedo,” the beta tailor sighed. “A regular old beta has no chance against a hot-house flower omega in attracting a handsome,

slick, and Castiel’s mouth watered at the thought of caramel on his tongue.
The bird turned to watch Dean again, that feeling of embarrassment still hot in the air, and Bobby continued with, “Well, guardian, do you have any other ideas?”
It was without warning, only a moment after recognizing that Dean was the source of that scent, that Castiel’s Alpha took offense at being slapped and looked down upon by an omega and rose up in him angrily. He tried to rein it in, to exert some of his church-lauded control over it. It refused, and, to his surprise, a growl trickled out of his mouth.
Akira’s eyes had sharpened on his flailing ‘explaining’ hand, having glimpsed something, and then narrowed. She pulled on his hand so she could see the palm, making him yelp because, seriously, she was strong for such a fine-boned thing. She scrutinized the characters on it with incisive eyes and rubbed the dark marks with her thumb, making Dean shift uncomfortably. Finally, she lifted her perceptive gaze up and asked, “Akio?”
It was a reprieve from God that his father was out of the country for some stuffy clan-Alpha meeting, while his mother had taken the week to go to Sweden and enjoy the saunas with five of her best Beta buddies. Gabriel actually had a commission due. He had made his name as an artist, and he was often called upon to design sets and paint gorgeously realistic backdrops for plays.
Either way, it was a pain in the ass.
The Baku held her ground in the large entry area, where the lounging furniture remained, watching idly as the yōkai shook free the viscous gray-green mucus that had come with her as she came into the human dimension, and hunger raged over her inhuman features.
Castiel wasn’t sure how she knew that, but he tersely nodded. Was this the consequence for being a coward?
Laura, with the perfectly done blond hair, lovely caramel eyes, and sensuous mouth cackled, “
But it sounded like..?

But apparently distance and time weren’t enough to separate Sam from his faith, and, once their Dad decided to settle them back in Lawrence, with Missouri to watch over them and Dean in charge, Sam had decided to understand God even better. He wanted to
Money wasn’t what was on his mind this moment, though.
“And the other half?”
And when John returned and took them away again, it would be fine. He would always know that Cas would never belong to anyone else.
“Poem?”
Without looking, Dean swatted at the bird, hitting it square so it flew back and smacked the wall with a heavy thunk and a shocked squawk. There was hefty thump as it hit the floor and a rustle of feathers that just
Sadly, hyperventilating was tough in below freezing weather. Just as he found breathing had become difficult, each breath harder to inhale because it was just so cold, he caught the muffled sound of a howl, and staggered in its direction. His Omega was desperate. This was what it had been waiting for, Dean could feel it.
Her glare narrowed a touch more. “Lynn. You’d know that if you’ve known my brother long enough to house sit.”
She had spent the day resting and watching. With her human guise on, she had walked into the neighborhoods, watching children play and women fuss. The large metal beasts, she had learned, were tame and used to transport humans. Left alone, they merely sat and waited until the humans roused them. Wandering aimlessly, she found a place called a “park” and watched humans walk about and play. They ate from small paper bags, and laughed a great deal.
“Dean, for a man who swears he hates chick-flick moments, this was monumentally ‘Pretty in Pink’ for you,” Cas chuckled. “What’s the occasion?”
It made Dean wonder how many of them were also on drugs, but he didn’t want to know. He eyed Michael warily. He was probably already jonesing for another hit of Slick if the subtle bit of perspiration at his hairline meant anything.
"Contracted? What? He's got to give up his soul or something?" Bobby hated the word ‘contract’ and ‘demons’ in the same sentence, even if the creature was a kitsune. After all, some kitsune went evil with nine-tails, losing their minds as they aged and all sense of self. He didn’t know this creature, and he sure as hell didn’t trust it.
Dean vaguely recognizes the
“That happen a lot?” Dean asked as he tightened the cap on his water bottle.
Castiel’s thoughts were in shambles. He stumbled into the bathroom and barely made it to the toilet as he threw up everything in his stomach, heaving wretchedly over the bowl. When he couldn’t throw up anymore, nothing coming up but acidic mucus, he leaned his head against the cool porcelain and cried.
“The healing, I did not know about.” He ruffled his feathers from top to bottom. “It also seems that if I use too much of my energy, I will get sleepy and, eventually, as this continues, I will start to eat.”
But no. Michael had insisted they stay at his apartment.

The day after Thanksgiving, Sam and Dean were watching
Dean legitimately had no answer to that. He felt Cas wince and hadn’t realized he had tensed and squeezed his hand a bit too hard.
Nidhogg loved human meat the most.
Dear god, they’re blue. So blue. They glow in the spotlight, his eyelashes fanning flirtatiously over his high cheekbones when he closes his eyes with emotion. His full pink lips stretch as he sings and holds notes, his body posed over the microphone stand as if he’s dipping his partner in dance. Dean’s throat suddenly feels dry as he watches, a surprising desire rising in his gut: he wishes he was a microphone.

Cas quirks a grin. “I wanted to sing for a living. Hard to do that professionally while hiding out in Chicago. Besides, Gabriel was already set up here to give me a hand, so why not?”
Michael waited until she turned to address another couple of beauticians, these in blue outfits, and slid his hand into a drawer of a decorative hall table (chest? What were those things called?) to palm something and slip it into his suit pocket.
Castiel shuffled awkwardly. “I wasn’t sure until just now, while he was napping. A tiny wisp of luck flew off of him. I was hoping it was my imagination.”
sinking into his bones. “Ah, fuck…”
Smiling gamely while stepping out of reach, Dean said, “Sir, is there anything else I can get you?”

letting you go to work.”
The Baku was not as tired as when she first emerged, but she hadn’t eaten in a day, and her liberator was not sleeping as much as he had in the beginning. Now, she was not getting as much luck as she had before. And trying to get into his dreams to influence him further was nigh impossible. The fucking tengu (a proper human word for it) guarding him was a tough opponent, even as banged up as he got every night trying to preserve the human’s sleep. She shrugged. He would be hers sooner or later, and that glorified bird was also losing his power from all the battles.
Cas nodded. “Indeed, we are travelers. We heard this village was a wonderful haven for Russian customs and the people were friendly.”
Cas hummed. “Doesn’t sound like a bad thing,” he deadpanned, grabbing Dean’s ass firmly and making
Things looked up briefly as he managed to get the car going this time, even if it was for a second, but at least he knew he was on the right track. With that, he hummed happily as Van Halen filled the small garage (much quieter than he would have normally, because...it was a church after all), bent over the engine as he swung his hips along to the music, checking the wiring from the starter.
.” He canted his head slightly, feeling those vibrant green eyes narrow on him yet again, and he wondered if Dean Winchester was always so suspicious. “I am in training to be a priest.”
He was sure he wouldn't survive another round of that hell.
And then?
I am an insane ass who got caught up in, well,
“Thank you, Gabriel.”
Dean flipped his hood up and chuckled, “I bet you are. C’mon. Let’s see what’s at the end of this rainbow.”
The Baku rests. Dean dreams. Cas freaks out.
Resisting the urge to stick out his tongue at her (or flip her the bird), he grinned smugly in her direction while Michael wound a hand around his waist to lead him away. He felt almost vindicated by the burn of pure hatred in her eyes, even as he suppressed his desire to move out of Michael’s arms. They had been not-dating for two weeks, but that didn’t mean he was comfortable with Michael’s possessive shows of affection.
“W’aht izz dat?” Dean asked, holding his nose and gagging.
“Would she know?” Dean asked, as Becky swatted lightly at Michael’s shooing, scolding him “for his own good” and to represent the “prestige of Celestials Inc.” in a proper manner, oh—and by the way—
When they parted with a gasp, Cas kept his eyes on Dean’s lips, sliding his thumb against the bottom one slowly, as if doing his own bit of memorization. And then he said, looking up into Dean’s eyes, that sorrow still there, breaking Dean’s heart, “Dean, I’m sorry. Either way, I’m doomed. Please forgive me.”
already!”
He leaped out of bed, feeling the anxiety building inside. If Cas wasn’t on the bed, if he wasn’t in the
ALSO! Happy Valentine's. This is posted a tad early so I can get in my love first. No sloppy seconds for me!
He felt a huge hand shake his shoulder and an insistent, “Dean! DEAN!”
Dean turned blank eyes on Sam and Bobby and replied, “Sure. I bet you’re right.” He smiled slightly and walked back upstairs, only stubbing his toe once.
Gabriel sighed and cautiously reached out a hand, pulling Castiel in to scent their familial bonds and relax.
Those big green eyes glared up at him, and Cas cackled happily. “Holy shit, I love you, Dean. Don’t ever leave me.”
Must be nice to basically have no nose, Dean thought uncharitably at the raven’s apparent immunity to the stench.
, he had done his job diligently, aiding people of faith on that fourth day, and folks born on them, which, as it turned out, was more of a job than he had anticipated, since they tended to be quite clumsy.
Shucking his shoes and stripping off his jeans, he climbed into his bed nude, pulling the blankets around him. He was too tired to put on pajamas for Sam’s innocent little eyes. His brother wouldn’t come in any way, since he knew Dean had been working. He sighed and snuggled in.
Cas showers in the tiny bathroom, but doesn't shave, leaving a dark shadow of scruff across his jaw that Dean wants to touch so badly his hands shake.
So, here's the latest with all my apologies. I do hope 2020 wasn't the shit fest for everyone else as it seemed to be for me. Concrete criticism is welcome, as always! I will now throw myself on my blade to save face from taking so long. Thank you all for your patience.
It took his mind off the smooth body revealed last night in the tiniest sliver of moonlight, all hard planes, smooth young flesh, and broad and muscular shoulders. Castiel shook his head again. It wasn’t right. He was going to have to meditate and relieve himself of those visions.
“Dean! Stop fighting it, you idiot! Let it go!!”
Sam chewed his bottom lip anxiously. “But… Deacon Castiel is going to be a priest. He can’t… he’s not
at that. What do you expect to do?”
Castiel sharpened his gaze and Gabriel shrugged. “Michael kept bragging about the guy. How many gorgeous, male Omegas who work in a bar and smell like caramel could there possibly be in podunk Lawrence, Kansas?”

He finally strolled over and poked Nikolai in the middle of his back with a super stiff finger.
Which was true. He had his little getups in his room, but he was wearing his usual old worn jeans, work boots, and three layers of shirts before his leather jacket got put on top. Sam had even made him wear a dark green scarf and a beanie, because it was getting cold at night. So he was hardly looking like Prince Charming.
He threw himself back on his bed and, putting his hands behind his head, he stared at the ceiling.  He didn’t even know what he had done to make Cas freak out like that.
It wasn’t horrible or as deeply painful as thinking about leaving the Church had been in his youth, or even while in college.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably and continued, "They look like beautiful young women, who just want to get your attention. The second a young man responds, they use tiny hooks that grow off the tip of each hair on their heads to attack."
He thought he heard Sam say, “Oh shit!” But he was already out the door, not even putting on his coat.
Which, really, Bobby didn’t put it past Castiel to be hiding that third transformation. He knew that tengu, especially daitengu like Castiel claimed to be, were supposed to be more humanoid. At least, that’s what the lore told him.
“It means there is no Misha Quma’giinaq,” the old man said, smiling. He picked up a Seattle Seahawks travel mug from next to his seat, popped the top, and took a long sip, sucking at the lid.
Beyond that tree, a voice called out, “Whas ‘ere? Whas ‘ere? Botherin’ me trees?”
“What? No! Why would I…?” Dean groaned and rubbed the back of his neck, coughing lightly. “We might have lied before about why we were here, but… the truth is me and Cas are on the run from a lot of people trying to kill me and capture Cas.”
So when a hand grasped his shoulder and yanked to pull him away, Castiel whirled, clawed hands extended.
“Well, the swearing part is spot on,” Dean snarked, and received dark look in return. Dean shrugged and pointed at Gabriel.
Dean pursed his lips and replied, “He fucking transformed and made the umbrella normal again. He’s earned his exhaustion.”
. The hospitals were full and the doctors’ offices were overrun with people losing their minds from the sleep deprivation. There had been a rash of suicides, a higher than usual murder rate, and too many people just locking themselves indoors to avoid the world and self-medicating. The schools were slowly emptying as teachers and students alike were bitter and bitchy, everyone snapping at the slightest provocation.
Castiel managed to not throw his phone across the room but gripped it tightly enough to turn his knuckles white. “Yes, sir.”
“That’s… fine,” he said slowly, finding he had to rip his attention away from the guarded omega and trying to smile at Sam. “I’ll be here.”
27 and, as a grown-man pissing himself when he wasn’t even drunk, it would haunt Castiel until he was dead.
Dean dropped himself back into the couch with a grunt and flung his arms over his head to block out the world. He tried to ignore Bobby’s presence, as the older man took a seat in the desk chair he had parked nearby to keep an eye on Dean.
Not that Dean got to say much.
Cas thought. He didn’t worry too much about the troll; they were hard to kill without iron or sun and the pixies would probably just torment it until they grew tired.
thinking about it despite his best efforts!
Dean nudged him again and winked. “I know. Don’t worry about it, Sammy. Just don’t cook when I’m not looking, okay?”
Dean nodded. “Fine. While Sammy’s sorting out this God business, I’ll help out.”
Sam sighed. “Yeah, but what if he, like,
Cas had taken the mud balls calmly until Dean mentioned Michael, and then it was like a switch had been thrown. He surged forward, crowding against Dean, and making him lean backward, his hands holding him up, his legs still trapped inside the blanket. They were close enough to touch, chest-to-chest, with Cas sniffing along the juncture of Dean’s neck and throat, a tiny growl that sounded suspiciously like
He had taken it at face value at that point, the proper soldier, floating along with the rest of the angels, accepting his training and garrison duty under Anael, listening to Gabriel talk about humanity and how interesting they were compared to the rigid rules of Heaven under Michael’s thumb, because no one heard Father anymore.
“Uh, yeah. I met him.” Cranking up his courage, Dean leaned in and asked, “Hey, do you think you can lend me a hand with this tie? I apparently suck at doing it fancy.”
It actually smoked for a second, and Dean yelped and shook it. “Cas, is this another curse?”
By the time he fell asleep, he had decided to ask Joshua what to do.
Sighing, Dean said, “So you were talking about troubles..?”
... it was absolutely, 100% Winchester-addled
Also, Yeah... I'm a bit sketchy about parts, but... I take constructive criticism well!
Dean snapped, “I’m not going to kill myself.”
: This was something asked by my betas. As in all things, there are two minds about this. In more modern times, it seems as if Buddhism is thought of as not recognizing “sins.” But this is not true of all Buddhist sects, and, in fact, if this were true, there’d be no tengu, according to the lore.
This was a rough, but enjoyable ride. I hope you enjoyed it with me, my first J2 BB. ;)
He stabbed a finger at Castiel, who had settled on a low branch and gave every indication that he was squinting at him. “You will grant me some respect for knowing about things you don’t know, and I’ll fucking respect you for knowing shit I don’t know.”
More slowly, Sam said, “I, uh, I want to stop by that Catholic church.” His hands twisted in his lap. “You know… the one by the park?”
Becky smiled thinly and nodded. “Oh yes! As Mr. Novak’s date, you’ll be expected to know at least the most

It is at that point Cas reappeared in the doorway, for which Dean is grateful, because god knows how he was going to explain an apparating Wesen. That wasn’t supposed to be possible.
Cas pulled Dean back into his seat, and asked, “Then, please tell us who he was.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ain't my first rodeo,” Dean mumbles through numb, dry lips. Sam gives him a bit of water again, and it feels like heaven.
Although Dean was breathing hard (and Cas wasn’t), he wasn’t so out of it not to notice something was bothering Cas.
Dean held it out. Castiel chuckled. “No, it’s Gabriel’s signature. It means Akio or ‘bright hero.’ I think he meant it as a joke of sorts.”
The woman had a warm voice even if her eyes were cold, as if she were not going to take “no” for an answer. Dean couldn’t smell her, but she looked like an alpha.
The guy (what the hell was his name? Something weird with a C, right?) croons it out smoothly and with great emotion. Enough that Dean wonders if someone has hurt him.

“Well, the bouncing part is right, at least.”

How many times had he come?
A large graying Kodiak bear stood at the edge, its eyes white with age, shook its head at them, and then he lumbered back into the forest.
Unsure what that had to do with anything, Castiel replied, “I know he works at a trailer park fixing things, but I think he also works at a bar, according to his little brother.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t count me out just yet. And I have help.” Akira grinned making a hand motion and keeping Eve’s attention on her. Behind him, Dean heard Sam chanting something, and he tried not to act
“If my divination is right — and it’s
When he was first presented, it had been worse, because his face was so feminine and his body the lithe omega ideal, all lean soft muscles and limber joints. Now, at seventeen, he still had some of that, but he was big for an Omega, taller than many alphas, with broad shoulders and bulky muscle. That was also fine, but some alphas saw his physique as a reason to get offended, that an omega dared to be physically more impressive than them.
To Castiel’s surprise, Michael honestly looked lost. “Why do you want him, Michael?” He asked gently. “He’s not a possession. He’s a person.”
Sam murmured, “Ahem… again, Cas was the foreigner traveling with her.”
Gabe just smiled at him, popping a new lollipop into existence and tugging off the wrapper with two practiced fingers. “Perhaps. Or perhaps we should talk about your nocturnal emissions problem?”
“Good birdy,” Dean crooned, knowing he’d won. “The next time you drop a cold washcloth on me, you’re dinner.”
I know I said there probably was not going to be any more overlap. Well, I underestimated myself.
He looked spooked, and Castiel supposed if he were human and hadn’t even believed in Japanese gods before this, he might have been too.
There was a pause as Dean seemed to have moved his phone from his mouth and started arguing with someone, saying he was sick and tired of their shit. “I mean it! I just got back and I’m fucking tired!” A plane overhead obscured whoever’s reply. Dean snapped, “Go both—OW!”
They both staggered to their feet just as a similar-looking man to the red bastard walked up, this time with light blue skin, blue hair and ice blue eyes. They were both easily eight-feet tall, and just built like brick shithouses. Dean saw the guy’s foot pull back and braced himself for the kick by curling into a ball.

It wasn’t the biggest city Dean had been in, but being forced to go to an office Christmas party was definitely not his idea of a good time. At least he didn’t have to pay for anything, and, although he had been a prostitute (not that Michael treated him as such), Michael wasn’t forcing him to sleep in the same room.

Dean heaved out a breath and said, “Akira, whatever it is, it better be
“You’d know,” Dean snapped back, and, maliciously, flicked his goo-covered arm at Gabriel, striping him from head to hip with the clear liquid. Gabe looked appropriately horrified for once.
“C’mon then,” Dean mutters as they shut down the rest of the lights and head to his.
Fear clutched at Dean innards. “He fucking stopped
There was a definite feeling of judgment coming off the bird. Definitely. “A candle is what you call a group of baku… or, I guess, what you’d call tapir.”
Lucifer impolitely snorted. “I was getting myself a sandwich. Not all of us are as enamored of sweets.”
Dean sighed in exasperation, and Cas caught him running a hand over his face, pausing over his mouth until it dragged one and gripped his chin. “Gods, I fucking

Cas nodded. “
Absolutely.
Dean did not need his brother to know about his dick. It was wrong on so many levels.
Although Dean still thought Sam was a baby, Sam wasn’t. He was nearly grown-up and he knew what was going on. Seriously, they had had sex ed earlier in the year, and Sam didn’t know why Dean didn’t remember signing Dad’s name to the slip.

Mr. Blue Eyes looked genuinely shocked by Dean’s actions. He stared at him for a moment. Dean smirked back at him, daring the probable-beta bastard into trying something. He took on alphas all the time; a small beta like him would be nothing.
“Yeah well, so were those nazi guys,” Dean muttered, ignoring the amused look Michael gave him. “Just listening to orders will get you in trouble.”
Today was Sunday, and it was his only day off.
“Little sis, this isn’t a confessional,” came an amused voice behind them. They turned to find Gabriel and Lucifer had made their entrance and had already escaped from their mother, who was now scolding Charles about his dark hair (which was a bit messy, but not that bad).
The bird shifted, its feathers faintly ruffling, and it sniffed, “I don’t get that reference.”
Anxiously, he laid back on the bed to try and rest.
Joshua frowned and pulled off his reading glasses. “You’re early,” he stated with significantly less tact than usual.
“What are we looking for,” Dean asked in the abnormal silence. The city was never very quiet, but neither were the woods, normally. It was as if the woods was holding its breath.

She patted her belly and purred, “Let’s rain destruction soon, my pretty.”
To Dean’s chagrin, the bird bowed politely to Bobby, who was frowning fiercely at the bird like he was afraid it was going to take a shit on his desk. It then hopped up and down, those blue eyes glowing even in the overhead light.

He wandered downstairs to find Bobby had gone to bed, the first-aid kit just waiting for him, but none of his wounds really hurt. He shrugged and wandered back upstairs, scratching at his head and wondering why there was no pain. He did feel a scab, but it seemed to be much older than a few hours ago.
And—again—Dean fell into darkness.
It seemed Sam had decided to tie up his midterms and come back to help.
Then, one afternoon when Michael called to check in, mostly because he was doing business in Kansas City, Dean stopped himself from being curt and turning off his phone. He paused and recalled that the doctor had recommended spending time with an alpha if he wanted to hurry along his progress. And according to Sam, it was coming along, but more slowly than Dean liked. And, heck, Michael was an Alpha. Hell, Michael was practically begging to spend time with him.
As he stepped in, Akira caught sight of him and waved him towards the small island that was Bobby’s desk. The bead was nowhere in sight, although Cas was sitting on the couch, looking trapped, and Gabe was next to him, just looking belligerent, especially with a turquoise t-shirt that proclaimed, ‘I’d rather be snorting cocaine off a hooker’s ass,’ under a well-worn dark brown leather bomber jacket. He smiled at them, and Cas’s trapped expression eased a touch. Gabe popped a Chupa Chup into existence and aggressively sucked on it, his gaze sweeping over the assembled magicians and hunters vigilantly, just in case they decided to make a move against Cas.
“Seems in order. Let’s see what you know.”
He gave a whoop of victory as one of the closets yielded some old woven rugs that looked like they were supposed to insulate the stone floor, and further investigation found two pillows and a duvet that were dusty and bit moldy. He’d have Cas mojo them clean, if possible. Cas was trying to be as low power as he could, keeping them off the radar. This had meant taking care of some annoying human things, like washing things and showering, had taken precedence over a mojo swipe and another round of nookie.
“The best thing, really, would be for you to just get your mate to accept you,” Balthazar sighed as he furiously scribbled onto the clipboard. “But I suppose it’s not an option.”
Wiping his mouth, Dean had thought:
Before he headed back to Sioux Falls, Bobby had called Sam too, and told him to find some Shintoists from some of the California shrines because it was getting down to the wire. He also contacted the two master Onmyōji he knew — one in San Francisco and one in New York — because all the other “Yin-yang masters” were just Feng Shui charlatans who would just get eaten in their hemp hipster clothes. When they needed to know where to stick a mirror to fend off bad luck, they’d find one of the asses. The one in San Fran, however, refused to come. Thankfully, the one in New York needed only a few days to get things prepared.
“Thank you all for coming to Celestial Inc.’s Holiday Party! I realize it fell on a very busy part of the year, so we appreciate you coming out!”
since they’d heard any news. He was deeply thankful Joshua was handling the routine church matters, while Missouri had Sam and continued attempting to reach John Winchester. (She had been muttering about trifling alphas and her wooden spoon.
“I am big for a raven,” he said defensively, but after Dean started to chuckle under his hand, and even Bobby had to look away, he deflated.
want me? Am I too filthy?" He hadn’t meant his voice to crack, or the small sob in his throat to escape him as he blurted out those questions, terrified of the answers.
Castiel felt something curl in his belly he had never felt before. He ignored it and worked harder to get control. Instinctively, his claws and fangs had emerged to hold down and force the omega into submission, the first time since he had presented, while his lower body was half hard to mate and claim.
“It’s fine. She reminds me of someone who is just the same.” Dean chuckled. He took a sip of the tea and it was hot, black, and had a somewhat smoky flavor. Although he wasn’t a big fan of tea, it was hot, and he was, at his core, still freezing his gnads off. Cas’s hand stopped him from taking another sip, as Abram was regarding him with a bemused expression  that sort of looked like, “American weirdo,” and said,
His main talent at SWEETIES is an hourglass redhead with sea foam-green eyes named Josie Sands, although she’s called a knight of Hell behind her back for her dark personality. Her sultry moves and rich honey voice is what brought in the boys on the worst days, though, and it doesn’t hurt she’s a gorgeous broad.
He walked in on them having some discussion about the some musty old capital of Japan, and Dean couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose in disgust. He walked up behind Sam, who was so engrossed he didn’t notice, and slapped two hands on his shoulders. Hard.
It was all very weird.
He pulled down the bill of his ubiquitous cap with a solid tug and muttered, “You’ve seen me before coffee. I think he’s doing okay.”
Sam stared at Dean, seeing as Dean rarely gave up the chance to watch Dr. Sexy. “Um, does it matter what it is?”
Dean jerks his thumb at the thin crowd. Usually there's a zoo of guys trying to put eyes—and anything else they can—on Josie. "What's going on? Josie on strike?"
“Dean, why are you moping so much? What’s gotten into you?”
Dean thought Cas’s friend sounded like a giant dick.
Dean grinned and again tousled Sam’s hair, causing the 13-year old to slap at his hand and glare mightily. “What do you want to eat, kiddo?”
Sam snorted. “Dean wouldn’t let you. He was serious about the True Mates thing. He just got more and more temperamental the longer he fought it.” Sam stuck his hands out defensively. “I was not getting between them. Cas is trained in Savate and used to work for the Russian Police.”
Dean growled and nipped at Cas’s chin. “You better not. Besides, he’s still got locks like Rapunzel and he cries at the end of Saving Private Ryan.”
Dean nodded and said, “Well, okay. Then what the fuck hit me on the back? And then got rid of those bugs?”
“Weird.” He heaved a sigh. “Sam and I will get on it.”
“Yeah, that doesn’t explain anything. Dean?”
Of course, there was Gabriel who was just hanging about with no real purpose. He had become addicted to caramel corn and lately he had just been loitering with Ichiren-Bozu, chowing down on the stuff and marathoning TV shows he had missed in the last decade or so. He had thoroughly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies and The Hobbit, and of course he fell in love with the Star Trek reboot. Or maybe it was just Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Dean wasn’t sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean had not expected to find out Deacon Castiel was Castiel
What he was going to think about was how to convince the Cete leader. He wished he could have called Bobby for advice, because this was above his pay grade. He looked over at Cas, who looked comfortable just believing in him, and he tried not to groan at the look of pure trust.
It took them until after the dinner hour to get Bobby up to speed on Meg and her accusations.
He carefully edged himself into the room, and looked around, but there was no one there but the raven with its beady blue eyes staring at him. “Did you capture the yōkai?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, but it sounds correct. Tripping on uneven ground and slamming into a rock wrong is a possibility.”
to watch.
Exhausted, Dean rubbed his hands over his face. “I’m really not. I mean, he orders everything, pays for everything, refuses to listen to me…” He heaved a heavy sigh. “He won’t take those damn suits back, and he’s just so… controlling! It’s driving me nuts!”
Swiftly, she ran, still in human form, ignoring the dark eyes from shadowed corners, her passing a blessing to a few, as their nightmares were stripped from them. She was once a divine beast; she could not completely subdue her true self, even as infected and contaminated by hatred as she was. She still hungered for those dark dreams, pulling them into herself as base fodder. Her being now needed different sustenance, food that would grant her power and, more importantly, vengeance.
Castiel spent Thanksgiving with Ellen and Jo, laughing about Castiel’s childhood and eating until they were all stuffed.
Clearing his throat self-consciously, Dean waves a hand at the utilitarian place and says, “Uh, home sweet home.”
“You’re just lucky it’s Sunday. I’ve been sending Sam to school.”
The song in the middle is

The old man seemed to shrink on himself and muttered, “She escaped my control, as she and the eldest daughter had become
Cas flapped up and landed heavily on his shoulder, apparently being careful not to snag the fabric with his claws because Dean didn’t feel the little prick (Heh heh! The little prick!). “Because you are going to be the acolyte. I cannot do the motions. A human needs to do this part, and I can say the prayer.”
Perhaps if they had a particularly powerful onmyōji to aid them, but the time of onmyōji had passed.
She had fled down the stairs, into the house, already wondering at all the metal and human smells that permeated the place, and she knocked down a door to escape into the natural world.
“The good Doctor Lilov and the rest were laid in their graves as soon as possible.” Liza pulled up a chair and sat down. “Greg, Anna, Ed, and Feliks were buried as soon as we could. But I believe pictures were taken of the bodies before that.”
time?”
Dean scowled at him. “Are you trying to tell me something?”
“Reassuring,” Dean muttered, flipping through the files. He found one that said, “Rostov, Daniil”  and started reading through it. “Well, just like you said. He went to Homer to have surgery and returned, complaining of flu-like symptoms two weeks later. He was already on antibiotics, so it couldn't have been bacteria based. Looks like the doc was going to send him back to Homer for a followup, but it never got done.”
If Dean was dying tonight, he wasn’t going to do it while Cas watched.
Swallowing heavily and well aware of the tent in his slacks, Castiel turned back towards the house.

Dean staggered away from Michael, falling back on his ass, and stared as a
This chapter is exceptionally long, but the rest shouldn't be. This is also the only chapter that is written like this (you'll see). After this, it'll be more straightforward.
His Alpha was smug inside him, having been freed more in the last two days than in the entirety of Castiel's life.
Shesh smile and echoed Cas’s sitting position, bending forward to put his face within inches of the angel’s. “Well, now… why don’t you tell me?”
Laura smiled knowingly and said, “Yep!” With a smug emphasis on the “p”.
“What the fuck is that?” Dean demanded
wrong — there was an indication of possible apocalypse. A star that hasn’t been seen in a millennium.” She caught the gazes of the two men and said firmly, “The harbinger of fate and doom, the nue, is going to be born if we don’t stop the Baku soon.”
Considering he’s currently standing with his back pressed hard against his tiny desk and trying to stare his claws back into fingers, it was not an unfair assessment.
Dean quirks his eyebrow. "Guy's name is Clarence?"
The truth is, humans cannot live without dreams. That was what they had learned. Humans without hopes and dreams were maddened beasts who preferred death.
He sat forward a tad. “Now, look. I don’t want to be involved with the bodies. I don’t think a stranger running into them is going to look too good to the locals. We’ll tell you where to find them, and then you two can lead a party to collect them.”
“Regardless,” Cas continued, raising his voice just a bit, one hand gripping Dean’s wandering fingers along his jaw, “That’s a large age gap. I certainly think someone with your intelligence and beauty coul–”
Benny snorted and walked away. “You better not have been making out on my couch,” he said as exited to wait by the truck. “I get to do that first!”
“Hey, Garth,” he greeted as he headed up the sweeping stairway to the second floor. The brothel area was a split-level to keep things under control. The first level was administration and where most of the omegas Crowley kept were housed, with one door in and out. The upper level was for the Omegas who could handle themselves. They essentially rented their own room, the payment coming from their wages. Crowley controlled everything else, making it the safest place in the building for omegas: no weapons allowed on premises and only designated people behind Garth’s window, where the omega dorm’s doorway was hidden.
“No foul play here,” he calls over to the uniforms in the hall who are keeping the other tenants from rubbernecking. There wasn't enough room for more than two officers at a time in the room with the bodies taking up space. “Least nothing done deliberately. Just bad luck.”
“I’m studying to become a priest,” he explained quietly.
Mr. Blue Eyes eyed Sam’s posture with sorrowful acceptance, and he nodded and chuckled tiredly. He put out a hand, and said, “I… I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me.”
: Most followers of Buddhism and Shintoism are (or should be) vegetarian. In Japan, there is actually a whole style of Buddhist monk cooking called
She primly faked a chuckle and backed up, looking out into the hallway. “Alexandra, Peter, get the omega trimmed and showered. Sven, I know Mr. Novak is smoking, so it might take a bit to get him onto the massage table, but
Dean frowned and got serious for a moment. “I need to know who took care of the doc’s wife.”
In this instance, it would’ve been polite and politic to stay calm and ask where the Winchesters were at that moment.
He snorted. He was practically falling back into his wild ways already; poetry eventually led to excess. He shivered and feared, as he had spent all this time, all of twelve-hundred years, conforming, being good, learning the Dharma and never falling off The Path. He would redeem himself. He would find Nirvana this time.
Dean chuckled and asked, “How’s he doing, Bobby? Is he behaving? I’m surprised dad just let him stay there…”
He rubbed a rough hand through his hair (that also looked like it had faded a bit) and said, “Yeah, what’s up?”
“Let’s start with you, Grimm.” Dean looked over and Cas was casually walking alongside Benny, looking ultimately unconcerned. Dean felt that faint arrow of envy die in the giant bonfire of bad-assedness that was Cas. There was literally nothing the Drang-Zorn could do to hurt him, and Drang-Zorn were known as extremely powerful Wesen, even if up against a Blutbad. If that wasn’t just off the charts hot, he didn’t know what was.
Dean was summarily shoved off the pedestal and handed a white dress shirt that was very soft under his fingers, and pushed into a changing room.
Then there came a vicious ripping sound, like a million bales of cloth being ripped at the same time, and a small explosion rocked the apartment, blowing out a few windows, and setting off alarms in the building.
“Would you two
, while the blond dude has been slowly fucking that omega he picked up earlier over in the corner of the far couch.” He squinted at the couch. “The female has been just watching everyone and drinking. It’s not even affecting her.” He frowned. “I mean, why bother coming if it doesn’t affect you and you aren’t having fun?”
: More yokai help.
It was as Mr. Blue Eyes grew out fangs and claws that Dean realized what they were dealing with.
“NO! It’s not Cas!” Dean snapped, throwing the dishtowel he was drying their dishes from dinner with on the counter and turning to face Sam. “For fuck’s sake, he’s like a priest-in-training! What even gave you that idea?!”
If Dean had been privy to Cas’s inner turmoil, he would have rethought his actions. Because it was times like this that Castiel had problems remembering he was an honorable tengu. That he had lived for hundreds and hundreds of years. It was how he found himself again, despite being in his secondary form, rearing back and hissing soundlessly at Dean. He even (lightly) pecked at Dean’s finger, making him shriek, before forcing a transformation that hurt enough to make him stagger, and flying upstairs where he knew the window was open.
like his claim has wrapped around you,” Cas rumbled, a clawed hand gripping the back of Dean’s head by the short hair on one side as he dropped tiny kisses on the exposed neck and throat. Dean tried to hold in the shiver it brought on, or the gush of slick it provoked, but Cas nibbled behind his ear and a low sob escaped him, frustrated that Cas had so easily found one of his weak spots.
“Did he just get in? How did you see him before me?”
was starting to wear off a bit. That or he was just getting used to all the scent blockers and neutralizers.
Bobby gritted his teeth. “Well, wake him up. You guys need to go check out an apartment building where people have been reported as ‘half-eaten.’”
“I so want to punch you right now.”
“I thought this was like Hissy or something?”

Castiel noted the nervous fingers, and nodded, realizing there was more to this, perhaps something he didn’t want his brother to hear. In contrast, Dean was slouched in his seat, his eyes still narrowed and his lips set in a tight line of displeasure.
Dean nodded. “Then it’s settled. Tomorrow evening early, before the lunar eclipse.”
“He… he expressed a desire to nap. When he is tired, he likes to drink coffee,” he mumbled. He took the tin between his wing-hands, trying to hide it, and shuffled sideways, away from Gabriel. “I… I just thought to be useful.”
Dean smirked and rolled his eyes as Sam pulled away and eagerly put on his shoes.
Cas had turned back towards the door, eyes glowing freakily in the dark, just waiting for him to return. Dean heard him puff his feathers, Cas’s eyes moving the only indication of his nodding in the darkness.

He had thought it had been worth it, even as he had crawled under the water and puked out his guts.

Gabriel laughed. “Could be worse, you could have just had
Bobby was half-asleep at the table, a first-aid kit out. It looked like he had been trying to read a book, but sleepiness had gotten the better of him, and his hand had fallen into his lap, the book spread out open in his palm. He had roused some when the door had creaked and popped open (an old fashioned alarm) and bleary eyes glared out at Dean from under the cap. “Boy, you ok?”
Then the green-eyed man smiled at him from his upside-down position, stroking a line down his beak, and Castiel forgot everything he had ever known his entire tengu life.
Respectively, hands waved in greeting, each one a shaggy beard and rustic man. They were wearing the same sort of shirt, that was sort of long in the sleeve and at the waist, and had a closed collar. They were all embroidered too, and they all looked like stereotypical Russians from the movies. Dean wondered if they all had fuzzy hats too.
A warm, gruff voice asks, “Are you okay? You fell asleep.”
Castiel didn’t know how such a small, messy pureblood Alpha like his father could look so ineffective and mousy, but still put the fear of God into people. But Charles

She chuckled and handed him a note with a flick of her wrist. Dean took the cream-colored envelope from between her two fingers with a grimace. He glared at the script that read out “Rocky” and sputtered, “How did you even know it was me?!”
. Me!”
He spotted a bench a few feet away and dragged Dale over, unceremoniously dumping the drunk onto the bench. He threw himself onto it too, leaning heavily on his buddy when he caught sight of a beautiful girl cosplaying a blue and black kimono. He thought, for a second, he was dreaming and blinked groggily at her, his eyes admiring how the kimono's gradation of colors from light blue to pitch black at the bottom showed off her pale shoulders and cleavage, masses  of blue star-like flowers crawling up from the edges of the dark cloth. The dress dragged behind her, with a soft srrt noise, and her long, black hair nearly touched the ground. She paused at his intake of break, turning her head slowly to stare at the two men, and, when she saw Mark, her blood red lips smiled sweetly.
He ignored that Michael now knew his name and glared at Laura angrily. She fucking

Sam was sure neither Bobby nor Akira had missed the surprised and then the subtle brooding expression on Dean’s face that Sam knew all too well. He hid it behind his playful mask, but Sam knew Dean was worrying for the tengu. The 'now very attractive' tengu at that.
They strolled away arm-and-arm to check out the new artist (something in abstract florals), but not quite fast enough to miss Dina’s “They’ll be the
Dean could tell that Cas could no longer take it when he pulled Dean up and kissed him hard, the word “Mine” resounding through the bond. Cas rolled Dean on top of the table, changing their positions, and flaring his wings over them again. “Cas,” Dean gasped, as slick fingers probed his hole, and Dean knew that Cas had coated them with wing oil in order to cover him with as much of his scent as possible. His feathers were dripping in it and sweeping over Dean’s body like tiny paint brushes.
Dean looked up from the casserole dish he had been washing to blink owlishly at Missouri. Missouri was not a tall woman, but she was very intimidating in every other way, especially for just being a third-level beta. Dean often felt she could read his mind, and he swallowed nervously when she narrowed her eyes at him. It was scarier than a pack of alphas staring at him like he was meat on a hook.
Sam generally got home around 4, so Dean had done the laundry, cleaned up a bit, and made dinner. When the kid had finally busted through the door, the trailer had smelled like meatloaf and garlic mashed potatoes. Dean had even added a salad for the health-conscious dork.
Of course, Castiel knew not every angel had a vessel from The Garden; most had to find an earthly vessel to contain them. Joshua told him that he was special, and not to worry about the differences.
Sighing, Joshua said, “God did not make a mistake in creating you. You are as you are exactly meant to be. Just open yourself to His Words and remember that, regardless of all else, you are His creation and He loves you.”
At least it kept Garth trapped behind the glass and on the phone, something Dean was grateful for, since the strange skinny guy liked to hug people. It was annoying, but, again, most omegas loved touch and comfort. The beta was smart, but easygoing, and he listened if an omega had a problem. He was a good choice for guardian.
Cas listened to the Russian exchange for a brief moment before storms rolled into his darkening blue eyes, and Dean
He nodded idly to himself as he checked the back door, which was deadbolted and blocked with a large wooden barricade. That was interesting. The rest of the house didn't seem to have so many locks set up around it; the front door was easy to pick and the windows didn't have bars on them. He eyed the wood bar again for a moment, filing it away for later perusal.
. If his scent blockers had completely worn off, Michael would have noticed the aggravation and revulsion churning through his scent and called him on it. Thankfully, the blockers were still holding strong, not revealing a thing. It probably didn’t matter, though. Michael was out of it (thank god), and as an apparent CEO (whatever) and Alpha, he was used to getting his way. Dean’s repulsion would more likely be a turn on.
Castiel greeted him but, thinking about his conversation with Joshua at the beginning of his rut, he asked, “Where’s Dean?”
“You’re finally back,” he said cheerfully. “I did what I could, but, honestly, it’s still going to be rough.”
Dean jerked his thumb at Cas at asked Bobby, "Y'know what's wrong with him?"
Smothering his desire to growl at the man (and maybe break his nose), Dean grimaced at being trapped between the guy’s arms as Michael shifted and moved into his personal space, bracketing him. It forced Dean to lean back against the bar to keep his space and made the smooth wood of the bar dig into his back as Michael leaned in close, stinking of arousal.
