“He…” Castiel chews on his words. Searches for a way to make Balthazar understand. “I didn’t ask him to, Bal.
Castiel really can’t help the small smile, at this point. “I believe that I did. But thank you for saying so.”
Castiel nods. He wants so very badly to reach down and hold Dean’s hand, but he won’t. Not now. Not in front of Sam, who is wiping his eyes and clearly trying very hard to avoid another breakdown. Dean, of course, surprises him. He reaches down and intertwines their fingers, tugging Castiel into a hug of his own.
to do. The rules are different here, because Cas cares about him – he knows that now. Believes it now. So, no – his alpha wouldn’t care at all if he... yeah. In fact, with as weird as he is, Cas might even be
Dean takes pity on him. “Cas, I’m just gonna take a shower. You gonna make it without me that long?” He resists the urge to invite the alpha to come along with him, if not. Something tells him Cas wouldn’t appreciate that sort of humor, even if – maybe
Her hand is on his arm again and he gulps in a breath, then another, desperate to keep his panic under control so he can fix this, so he won’t be sold back. He’s standing up. He doesn’t remember standing up. Pamela’s eyebrows are drawn together. “Castiel doesn’t want to hurt you.”
“Angel,” Dean reminded Scott impatiently, tucking his gun into the back of his waistband and fixing his jacket. “Come on, kid. We don’t bite.”
Dean laid a hand on Cas’s shoulder, applied the gentlest pressure, and Cas found himself moving, kneeling at his feet, guided down like that was where he was always meant to be.
She leans back on the table and adjusts her glasses. “You can say no. Or, you can let me check you out and fix what I can and we can keep anything I find to ourselves – I’ll give him the bare minimum that he needs for you to be safe.”
God, he doesn’t want to say it. But he knows, even though it hurts to admit, that he’s so much the product of someone
“Your case,” Castiel adds eventually, “was unprecedented. I’ve never… we’ve never done something like this,” he says helplessly. He abandons the stove and sits down in front of Dean, a good few feet away to give him the space he probably wants. “I know that this arrangement must feel unfair.”
Dean huffs out a laugh, rubbing a hand across his mouth. “Yeah, I know,” he agrees, wonder still very present in his voice.
But instead of fury, a thoughtful frown is on his master’s face. “Never. It would be wildly unfair for me to assume that you understand my expectations here, especially because they’re likely very different from anything you’ve experienced. How else are you going to learn, besides asking?”
at him. His fear, abruptly, twists into anger. Anger at himself for being so obviously weak, and anger at
this routine, loved to dangle precious forgiveness over his head that he would never be good enough to receive. If he doesn’t admit everything he did wrong now, it’s only gonna be worse for him in the future – or, at least, that’s how it’s always been. “I… I messed up, though. So… I deserve it.”
“I don’t…” He can feel himself blushing, dammit, hot all the way up to the tips of his ears. And it’s dumb that something like this should mortify him – Cas has seen him in far worse states. So he powers through, the reward far greater than the risk. “I ain’t got a clue how this thing works.”
“But he–” Sam feels pathetic. Feels small. “I think he. Uh. Tried to call our uncle. But not me. Why wouldn’t he try and…”
Claire,” Jody says, eyes flitting between her and the alpha, calculating. Absorbing. Her tone is even, and it’s clear she’s trying to de-escalate things before they spiral even more.
Dean weakly sits back on the ground and drops his head between his knees so he can take in deep, hungry breaths.
Despite the circumstances, Castiel can’t help but feel a flutter of pride at that. Can’t help but feel
, and once it was over he could see why. Cas was standing, arms stretched towards them, breathing hard.
Dean drops the cup from his mouth abruptly, staring at Castiel with wide eyes. “I didn’t,” he blurts, and his voice shakes. “I didn’t drink anything, alpha. I swear.”
Hello friends! Hope you enjoy the new chapter. Many thanks to HD as per usual (light of my life, heart of my heart) and a shout-out to thanks_tacos as well!! They helped me think through a couple parts of this chapter and I'm grateful!
“Got it,” Dean said on a nervous laugh. It seemed he’d be doing most of the talking tonight. “I mean, you know. We could do some
Heart in his throat, he does eventually pull himself out of the tangle of blankets and rub at his face. The scents in the room are chaotic,
“If you’re asking if you’re going to stay here with me, the answer is yes,” he finally says, and Dean’s eyes fill with water that he hastily blinks away, hiding his face. And it sickens Castiel that there’s suddenly
So sorry for the long wait, y'all! I have had a crazy busy week. Hope you are all staying safe out there!
“May I propose something?” he asks after a lull of silence, and Dean glances up at him curiously, nodding. “Perhaps we could simply put the mattress on the floor?”
Dean drifted over, reached out a hand, then let it drop back to his side. He had no idea what was needed here. Another hard fuck? A good cry? To talk it out? He felt completely out of his depth, because despite having been friends for over a decade, this new change in their dynamic had made things shift between them. He didn’t know what was expected of him. How far he was allowed to push.
and wouldn’t exactly be hurt by the little switchblade the brat was brandishing, panicked. He tossed his gun to the pavement and ran up behind the child, pinning his arms to his sides as he wrapped his own in a vice grip around the kid’s chest. The demon child squirmed and writhed, kicking him solidly in the kneecap, then shin with a bone-chilling screech, but Dean only tightened his hold.
Sam stares up at him, feeling his eyes fill with tears. He takes in Balthazar’s thunderous, almost desperate expression, the way his hands are balled up into bloodless fists at his sides.
He feels like he’s wrapped up in a sleeping bag on a cold night in the woods. Like he’s floating in a warm, lapping lake, face to the sun. He could fly up into the air and never touch the ground again.
Clearing his throat, Castiel retreats to his side and pulls back his covers, crawling into his bed without looking at Dean. He doesn’t want to pressure him, doesn’t want to influence his decision in one way or another.
“From what I understand, you went unclaimed.” He pauses, but Dean doesn’t react – he forges forward. “After a 72-hour waiting period you became a ward of the state automatically. That often happens with slaves that are found and picked up by law enforcement, but aren’t reclaimed by owners in time.”
Like someone else has taken control of his legs, he finds himself walking out the door. Finds himself shutting it quietly and carefully behind him, so softly that it hardly makes a sound. It doesn’t feel far enough, so he goes through the second door as well, and shuts that one just as carefully, till he finds himself alone at the end of the hallway.
While his presence in the room is large, it is not looming, and Dean sinks slowly to the ground. His knees are a little sore, but the carpet is thick. It doesn’t hurt, not really. It hurts even less when Castiel nudges the pillow in his direction and he holds it to his chest, trying not to be obvious when he inhales the alpha’s scent off of it.
It didn’t matter, though. Unfortunately, most of the cops here in Sioux Falls tended to treat any protests that didn’t line up with
An idea slowly starts to form in his head – one that is probably far too transparent to work. But it’s worth a damn shot.

like, surprisingly, and he only feels a tiny squirm of anxiety when he limps over and pours himself a cup. Cas nudges cream and sugar his way, gently insistent without saying a word. Dean adds them with no complaint.
Dean squeezes his hand again. “Yes. Yeah. I –” He chews on his words for a minute, nearly vibrating in Castiel’s arms. “I
But, of course, there were always ways around the system. Alastair had found one. Dean’s gotta wonder if he’s the only slave Alastair’s had that tried to escape. Or, more likely, if he’s the only one the bastard
“Dean,” Castiel prompts gently, heart clenching when the omega flinches at the sound. “We’re here. Can you get out of the car for me?”
he continues. “I understand how unrealistic that is. I’m simply asking that you think about what you just heard, and come to your own conclusions.”
this? They must, because the man doesn’t look shocked by anything he’s saying – on the contrary, he’s acting like this is a run-of-the-mill conversation.
I now have a discord, thanks to the hard work of Old, Alone, Done For for! They set up basically everything and gave me a crash course on how to handle discord at all. Come say hi!
Because he didn’t think he would survive that explanation. Not when it was taking every ounce of his being not to break apart as it was.
he reassures Dean, shaking his head. “But don’t make the mistake of thinking it was an inconvenience to me. It wasn’t.”
Heart pounding in his chest, Sam keeps his head held high and meets the omega’s eyes. He doesn’t say anything, just waiting for Balthazar to make the next move. And apparently, the omega recognizes his strategy, because he laughs.
“Yes. Think about it. You’re hardwired by evolution to guard vulnerable members of a pack, yeah? That’s why alphas are typically a bit bigger, why they tend to be a little more aggressive and hyperaware. Makes you a better protector. It’s easier to do that if your body is inclined toward it physically, right?”
Dean glances at the offending piece of furniture, even more exhaustion seeping into him at the thought. It looks comfortable, but…

In spite of what his instincts insist, he can’t rescue Dean from what he’s afraid of; namely because the omega is afraid of
He waits, and he trembles. But there is no sound of another man’s breathing in the room, there’s no tug of chains at his wrists or collar, no acrid scent or tell-tale soreness that would prove he’d been used. He’s been in a bed all night, and no one has touched him.
His master had punished him every time. Mostly, it was just the whip, his go-to for just about everything. Rarely, when he was good and frustrated, he kicked him. But worst of all, there were times when he fucked Dean himself, so hard and fast and vicious that orgasming was the last thing on his mind, yanking on his collar until Dean was arched backwards and choking.
Dean made a mess, and instead of cleaning it up, instead of freaking out and scrubbing it away and leaving no trace at all, he left it there. And then, he sought out the very same alpha that he’d been sure, what feels like eons ago, would
The alpha winces, but Balthazar knows better than to think he’s expressing sympathy for the alpha in question. More likely, he’s thinking of the harsh
Cas doesn’t look like he wants to make fun of Dean, though. In fact, his face sorta screws up like he’s getting emotional, and that’s
Scott peered down at the missing person report Dean had pulled up in three seconds flat. “They’re all over the place looking for you, dude. They miss you. Ain’t no way they don’t.”
When Castiel opens his mouth to protest, she holds up her hand. “Don’t forget that he’s not had a natural heat in a very long time, Novak. In
It strikes him, much later than it should have, that he isn’t the only one that’s confused and scared right now. Isn’t the only one that feels betrayed by the way his body is acting.
Sam’s expression shifts from mild confusion, to a broken sort of understanding as the meaning behind Castiel’s words sink in. “But you thought it’d be a good idea to… to buy him yourself,” Sam says shakily. “You. An
flinches, “but the sooner you become accustomed to those parts of yourself, the more comfortable you will be.”
crying, tears hot on his face, and he has to hunch over and hold his hands over his mouth to keep quiet. He doesn’t even know what he’s feeling. Doesn’t understand why this isn’t
But Dean, being Dean, worked in silence. Actually, it was so comfortable that somehow, despite how twisted the whole situation was, time slipped by and Cas eventually relaxed. Dean’s touch was nothing like his own harsh tug, he was so light, skimming across the feathers, burrowing close to the skin of the wings. Ten years was a very long time to go without physical touch, and now Cas soaked it in, became drunk off of it.
“Maybe he just wants to stay anonymous!” Charlie shoots back. This isn’t the first time they’ve discussed it, and her impatience with that fact is bleeding through into her tone. “He’s an

body has to fuck everything up. He’s throwing all the nice things that Cas has done for him right back in his face, by acting like this. Dean wanted to be
“I know her. Jody forces me to come see her every other week, seems like,” she grouses, crossing her arms.
Dean jumps when he breaks the silence, and Castiel tries and fails not to feel guilty about that. Balthazar had said to be clear about his expectations, so he thinks he should warn Dean of Pamela’s impending visit like he failed to do last night.
The question makes anxiety squirm in his stomach, though he’s not sure why. Maybe it’s because any alpha who had tried to figure out what he wanted before now had done it so they could be sure and dangle those things over his head, just out of reach. It might be naive, but he believes Castiel’s question is earnest. Still, he can’t open his mouth, can’t make himself ask for something just to be denied. He just twists the strings of his hoodie around his knuckles and pulls them tight till his fingers are white.
. Castiel can smell layers of fear, sour and old on the omega’s skin, an emotion so often felt that it’s now a permanent stain on his scent. He can only begin to imagine what Dean has been through to put him in this state of apathy.
He glances at Balthazar, but the omega waves him off. “I don’t need to be up there,” he says dismissively, shaking his head. “He’ll get all territorial over you, and I’m not in the mood to deal with that.”
Balthazar had texted him about twenty minutes ago. He taps on the new conversation with a tiny trill of trepidation that intensifies into nausea when he reads it.
When Hannah is done, she stands and brushes her hands off on her pants. “You’re thin as a rail, my dude. You’ve gotta let me in on whatever diet you’re on.” She’s obviously joking, trying to put him at ease, but Dean’s face goes disturbingly blank at the casual remark, his hands balling into fists. Hannah looks at him curiously when he doesn’t reply.
The omega shakes his head. “We’ve got about thirty staff members. Most of them live on the main campus with the rest of the residents.”
,” he blurts, and Dean flinches, cowers lower to the ground than he already is. “I mean – that’s not what you’re here for. Not that. None of that.”
Hannah looks between them, a slight grin on her face, but she doesn’t say anything and he’s grateful. “You wearing those out? I can just pack up the rest.”
for that, that it would be a team effort to keep the kid’s innocence intact. But it hadn’t taken long for Dean to understand that protecting Sammy meant shielding him from
tainted, gross. I’m sorry I touched you in the first place. You should have said something earlier, because now I feel like
Balthazar resists the urge to make a quip about the omega looking in a mirror, sometime, and tries to be a little more subtle. “It makes him hesitant, that guilt. Makes it difficult for him to act freely. He’s always concerned that he’s going to make the wrong decision.”
Castiel pushes himself off of the wall and stands, though he stays a respectful distance away. Dean looks at him over Sam’s shoulder. His eyes are soft. Full of
The assumption isn’t all that far off – there’s something feral inside of Castiel that just won’t sit quietly and watch the omega be abused anymore. For once, he simply gives in to that hot, murderous rage he feels when he sees cruelty like this, and he allows himself to snarl, his teeth sharp. The man

of sleeping – and so, as the night had worn on, his resolve had worn down too, thinner and thinner until he’d stumbled out of bed and bolted down the stairs, his heart in his throat as he’d finally given in to the insistent, vicious little creature inside of him that wanted him to be at Cas’s side.
He makes another embarrassing noise when the alpha bends and presses his brow to the crown of Dean’s head. The even, measured movements of his chest are predictable and comforting. He holds him close. Drags his thumb up and down his nape.
He averts his eyes, unable to face the way his brother is about to look at him for what he’s going to say. “I don’t want to run away.”
Dean’s scent wavers, as does his expression. “But…” he says, desperation in his voice. “But he wouldn’t have put Sam in danger,” he insists, and the fact that he doesn’t include
It’s a while before things start making sense again. Before he can feel the water still raining down on his skin, before he can shakily try and get his legs back under him. It takes a few different attempts.
He struggles to keep his scent under control, to contain the flare of distress that the man’s words cause. He can’t know anything – he wouldn’t have gotten this far in the building if he did, right? Face carefully blank, Sam cocks his head to the side and puts on a polite expression of interest. “Yeah, I can totally understand that,” he says sympathetically. “I’m sure you get all kinds of weirdos trying to walk through those doors.”
slaves. Something niggles at the back of his mind, but he pushes it away, too dazed to examine the thought. “Okay. Yeah.”
The shame, along with the slick-free fresh air, is more than enough to knock out his arousal. As soon as he can breathe correctly again, he fumbles for his phone.
for any length of time, let alone a blanket or a pillow, or the freedom he’d need to organize his space.
Dean half laughs. “Come on, Cas. I know you wouldn’t let some random alpha sink his fangs into me. I ain’t that stupid.”
The realization makes him press the heels of his palms into his eyes for a moment, makes him have to hold back something close to a whine.

In the relative safety of the fitting room, he can admit to himself that a tiny part of him had been expecting something different from this trip. It had whispered that he’d be lucky to get clothes at
No idea that in just a few short hours he’d have a fake alpha cock shoved so far down his throat that he’d puke, no idea that he’d be forced to keep going until his stomach was empty, no idea that after that he’d be starved until he started kneeling, started begging, started
The unfinished words hang in the silent room like a gunshot, a direct contradiction of what Castiel just told him. He’s basically calling his master a liar. Dean’s nostrils flare, taking in Castiel’s scent, searching for the anger that must be coming. But there’s nothing more than a little more of that sadness from before that he doesn’t understand.
He calls for his alpha before he can think a single coherent thought, clamping his mouth shut right after when his brain catches up with him. If Cas isn’t here, it’s because he doesn’t

guilty about how badly he’d apparently scared the man – it hadn’t really been his intention. But he also hadn’t known any better. He resolves, privately, that he’ll find a way to apologize to Balthazar. But he doesn’t say sorry to Novak – he just meets his gaze with his head held high, jaw clenching. The tension in the room creeps up a little more.
It’s a lot. Lines upon lines of text he doesn’t understand the first time around, sentence after sentence that he has to squint at and read a second or even third time to comprehend. It’s a lot of legalese, a lot of commas, and a lot of what appears to be C-Y-A crap that he has no patience for. More than once, when a particularly harsh or callous sentence gets to him and the words start to look more like angry, buzzing wasps, he has to look away from it.

of forehead kisses while I was being a looney toon, didn’t you?” he teases, smiling shyly against the alpha’s chest. He already knows the answer – he can remember them, just a little. Little bursts of pleasure and happiness, stars in the sky.
Dean swallows down his fear. Reminds himself that Cas trusts this man, and that Cas would never leave him alone with someone he thought might hurt him. It helps him calm down right up until the therapist opens the door again.
Dean allows himself to be steered to the window seat, allows himself to be gently pushed down onto it. He looks as though he’s sitting on a bed of nails, for how comfortable he is, but he doesn’t protest. Castiel has seen him sitting here before, of course, but he has a hunch that Dean’s reluctance has more to do with his presence than his general aversion to sitting on furniture. He’s never stayed seated here for long, after all.
After a moment, she sighs, tapping the strap of the worn leather doctor’s bag on her shoulder absently. “I’ll come back in a week or so to check up on everything – eventually I’ll look into getting the kid on heat suppressants, too. He’s way too underweight and too scared to be able to handle them right now, but that will change eventually.” She rubs her hand over her mouth, something haunted in her eyes. “Castiel, he’s… they did things to that kid that I can’t even…”
But, predictably, he can’t let it go. Laying here reminds him too much of the other times he’s been in a bed for any length of time, none of those memories pleasant. It makes him think of grasping hands and pressure on his neck and pain in his wrists, of the always terrifying and painful initial
But that’s not reality. And Dean’s not interested in looking back and thinking about what-ifs and maybes.
The alpha’s palm is warm when it wraps around Dean’s arm, but he feels far away. “Too much?” Cas asks gently, no judgement in his voice. He keeps his words pitched low, so only Dean can hear. “We can leave.”
Instead of getting up right away, as he has been for the last few mornings, he stays curled on the floor and goes over his thoughts again and again like a hamster on a wheel. Frantic, going nowhere. The downside of being fed and well-rested is that he has a lot of energy, almost all of which gets fed straight into his anxiety. It tangles his stomach into little knots, claws into his gut whenever it gets the chance. He
It’s Sam’s fork that scrapes hard over the edge of his plate, though, with a goosebump-raising squeak. Dean grits his teeth, just waiting for his shoulder to flare up at the sound of Cas’s name, but it doesn’t.
. If what I am is going to continue to be an issue for you, Winchester, then I’d rather find out about it now, rather than later.”

of his thigh, just running a finger up and down the seam of Dean’s jeans—well, it turned out that Dean getting really turned on wasn’t gonna be a problem.
Oh, yeah, real nice, Winchester, mention Sam’s toxic farts in the same breath as him and Cas having a room all to themselves.
He watched the little golden queen—she’d nearly tripled in size in the five years since he’d first seen her, now as long as his outstretched arm—dart feet-first against the top of the waves and carry away a twitching fish that looked much too big for her, her wings straining and her tail lashing back and forth with the weight of her prize. He chuckled softly. “Well done,” he told her.

told Bobby he’d lost his first set of marbles. He hadn’t—he’d snuck out and sold them in the market for coin to get a birthday gift for Sam, their first year off the streets, and told Bobby he’d lost them. In retrospect, he had no idea if Bobby had believed him.)
“Sir,” he grits out, then stalls. What else is he supposed to say? His dad’s a former Marine—he damned well
He shows it to Cas, though, while they’re sitting and waiting in the library for Sam to get out of Trivia. He’s not even sure why he does. He’s pretty sure he knows what Cas’s says. He knows that Cas is the kind of guy who applies to freakin’ MIT and Northwestern and places like that.
Only one of the remaining buildings still has four walls and a roof—though the stone is cracked and pitted. It looks like it was, once upon a time, a temple to the Lord of Light.
The single piece of advice that Castiel’s mother gave him about the situation was this: “When Angel’s ready to fly, you’ll know.”
Dean laughs and reaches out, pulling the book and the apple towards him. “That’s me, always the good Samaritan,” Dean says, puffing out his chest. “I’m
Cas? This asshole needs protecting about as much as Dean’s boots. It’s not like he even really matters, right? He’s just doing his job. That’s all they are to him.
“No…” Cas says shyly. “It takes a long time to cook, so I already had it in the oven. Besides, I don’t want you to see my kitchen; it’s a mess. I haven’t had time to clean yet. I’m afraid to let Grace back in, because tomato sauce is very difficult to get out of her feathers…”
“Oh,” Cas answers, in a tone of divine revelation, and gets to it with an enthusiasm that almost ends it for Dean right there.
“Yeah, yeah, yuck it up,” Dean muttered, turning away, Impala’s big paws kicking up gravel. But he turned back almost instantly. His hand was tight, white-knuckled around the grip of his harness. “Uh… Cas?” he started again, his voice a low thrum that Castiel leaned closer to hear. “You, um… shit. You be careful out there. I’ll be watchin’ out for you guys, but you—anyway. Right?”
“I suspect it’s never been tried before because most storm-mages don’t work in groups. And when they do, it’s pretty much never with a book-mage,” Sam explains, watching text go scrolling over the pages of his journeyman book and disappearing almost as fast as Dean can track its motion. Lord of Light, mages are weird, every last one of them. “Rowena thinks it’ll work.”
He counts the shotguns in the trunk, settles a machete carefully back into the holders made out of egg cartons so that the edges aren’t nicking and clacking and dulling against each other. The neat rack of shotgun ammo stuffed with rock salt has three shells missing from the left-hand row. When Dean lowers the false bottom, there’s an old duffle bag that used to be navy blue stuffed in the right rear corner.
“Why?” he asks. The way he says that makes sense come back to Dean’s brain for a little, because that? That’s the question of someone who’s
“Damn,” Henricksen mutters. Small puffs of ash come up around their feet every time they move. But they don’t leave any footprints behind them as they creep along. “It’s like it burnt out everything. Even topography.” He talks in a low voice, but not a whisper. They already know that whispers echo here, hissing in the background.
Castiel stared at the fading bruises on Dean’s left arm, the swollen lower lip he was sporting, and felt his heart thump, thump, angrily behind his eyes.
Dean’s about one hairsbreadth from just picking up and leaving, but after a long moment, his dad sits down in his normal spot. Sam does too, more slowly, giving Dean a look that Dean doesn’t quite understand. Everyone else follows suit.
Dean had said, so Castiel eased back—just enough to give himself some room—and pressed himself back in, all the way to the root. It wasn’t enough, it wasn’t
“C’mon, show me. If Sammy has to learn how to punch, you do, too,” Dean said, settling his legs down and his body a little sideways. “And if anyone says any of that stupid stuff or makes fun of you, for, I dunno, for
“The itching was the worst, though,” Cas adds, just a little grumpily, and Dean muffles his laugh into Cas’s bottom ribs.
Dean took a huge, messy bite of Castiel’s pie, filling up his whole mouth with a too-big piece, so big he had to open his mouth just to chew.
He says that every few weeks. Castiel’s stopped wondering who he’s saying it to. Just as he’s stopped wondering at why he dreams about the curve of Dean’s lower lip.
But the good he has is… really good. Fireworks in an empty field. Sonny telling him, "Great job, kid," for a wrestling trophy. His mom’s smile. Scooby Doo. “I’m proud of you.”
Dean checked the highway in front of them—bare—and turned and stared at his brother. Sam’s jaw clenched tight, but he didn’t look back.
Now that Dean’s looking for it, there’s a wry little curl that tilts up the corner of his mouth when Cas turns towards Jo. “I don’t dispute that either,” he notes, “but you have seen firsthand what angels and demons can do, in a far more intimate fashion than most people have. Are
. He looks like a guy still wearing a too-big, ugly suit because he’s been in meetings all day and the idea of changing into something more comfortable is more tiring than just staying like he is. There’s an uncapped pen on a pile of papers in the middle of the desk, and Dean realizes: he was probably still working.
By the time the call comes, it’s been two days since Dean’s slept. He’s running on coffee and a full bladder, piss and vinegar. He was really fucking looking forward to a full four hours of shut-eye. Or even a nap, he’s not picky. Whatever bullshit mojo it is that the demons put out that changes humans to monsters, it doesn’t last more than a few days—thank God, ‘cause otherwise there’d be no hunters left. If the combination of the monsters and the demons didn’t kill them, the exhaustion might. The sky’s been clear; they

after all, not dragons yet. And Castiel wasn’t even a rider—the dragons communicated with him well enough, but none of them
But Donna’s smile was hopeful and pink, her cheeks creasing, and the dimple curved them like the smooth sides of the Weyr’s walls. She put a hand gently on his shoulder and patted, twice. “Everyone always wants to know what they did wrong. You didn’t do anything wrong. It just isn’t your time yet.”
Yeah, they’re poisonous, too. Doesn’t kill. Just makes you sick as shit while they start eating you wearing your own face. Fucking
Dean crinkles his nose, looking at the cover. “That about ghosts?” It doesn’t look like it’s about ghosts, though: it’s got big angled letters and a purple sky, and is that some kind of tower? Maybe a spaceship. Huh. Dean has to admit, he finds most ghost stories kind of boring. They’re all slow and creepy-like, and ghosts just aren’t like that in real life. Sam likes reading them, though.
His headset mic transcribes the words onto the blank white page. It even gets the punctuation right. Well, that’s a first.
now: Cas’s has a little more padding, so it normally goes under them, and Dean’s gets thrown over them as a blanket. Between that, the protection sigils that Dean sets up, and Cas’s own ambient magic, they’ve weathered out full-on ice storms that way.
Dean grabs at his arm, but not for balance. “Cas, buddy…” He looks him up and down, and starts patting. Nothing’s wet, though—no blood. “Did they get you?”
But the stuff on the inside is more solid: guns in racks, ammo—all of it useless, of course, but the first wave didn’t know that yet. Food packed in crates, a man-high wall of machinery against one corner that Cas told them was the predecessor of the portable radios that they have now. Henricksen uses the butt of a rifle to swing the tent flap closed.
“Nothin’, just, I get it. Pretty sure I’d have the same look on my face if you were petting me and giving me head-scratches too,” Dean blurts.
The wherry herd set up a whimper, and then a scream, throwing themselves against the bars of their pen as the bobbing threads of the demons fanned out from the scarlet rip in the sky. The Wing stopped, scattering from their travel formation into a staggered, irregular line—their bodies, at this distance, looking so impossibly tiny against the Hellgate’s mouth, against the dozens of threads of smoky demons drifting out of it.
Cas settles Dean on the edge of the twin bed, and kneels beside the little mini-fridge that’s slotted against the foot of the mattress.
“General Novak riding your ass, too?” Unlike Adler, General Novak’s never bothered to come watch them. Maybe she just watches the tapes or reads the reports. Dean never did ask how exactly Cas, the poor sap, got roped into being the point person between a big-ass set of tug-of-war over them. But he
to yours, and Rowena had to tell me when you were planning to come by to pick up the augury reports so I could catch you!”
The man adjusted a cap that covered the hair on his head. The raggedy thing wasn’t quite blue, though maybe it had been once upon a time. It was dirty, pulled down low over his eyes. He had a beard along his chin and his cheeks and his upper lip. His clothes weren’t fancy—homespun shirt, old breeches with the seams starting to wear. The sword he wore on his hip and the crossbow strapped across his back looked clean, a lot more than his hat.
yet. Hell, even if Cas’s bare feet hadn’t been brushing against his ankle every so often, he wouldn’t have wanted it to.
when crossed, especially where Sam was concerned. He’d never thrown a punch at Castiel, but Castiel wouldn’t put it past his best friend—not when it came to this. Dean’s whole body shook once, and his hands were in tight fists in his lap.
Cas not more than half-hard, neither of them are, and that’s fine—that’s just fine. That’s its own fun, too. Dean tastes him down slow and soft, just little motions of his lips and the tip of his tongue, because Cas is
“Hannah asks too many questions,” Dean grumbles. “And she’s all sciency about it and shit.” He has to admit, he was pretty surprised when Hannah decided to join Cas on the Hunter Project—but considering she’s cooked up some neat little portable scanner things that help triangulate residual pockets of angel dust, he can’t complain about her too much.
Dean does think about it. He’s spent more years than he should have letting that idea flit at the back of his mind. And now, knowing what he does? Could they have—could they have, maybe…? If he’d still been talking to Cas, ten years ago, would he finally have said aloud,
and not just brethren, leaves Castiel aching in a strange, delightful way. They weren’t born to this—or hatched, or created, or whatever angels were. They will sit here and debate with him on the nature of whether angels were created or hatched. They
His skin was chafed and uncomfortable, and even the rub of his thin undergarments was making him wince as he walked.
“Hello,” the boy said, and looked down at the basket on his lap like he had just remembered it was there. “I brought lemons.” He considered, tilting his head to one side. “And bread. I think.”
But Impala, triumphant, butted the side of Riot’s jaw with the top of his head. Then did it again when Riot, just barely, cracked open an eye and yawned, his forked pink tongue poking outwards. One of his tail-tips flicked off his nose and narrowly missed swatting Impala across the face. Impala grunted and dropped the piece of wherry in front of the significantly larger brown, lowering himself down onto his stomach and poking Riot in the neck with his nose again.
It’s not a bad itch, though. Kind of a tingle. There’s no reason it should—it’s ink, not scar, not anything else, and Cas isn’t an angel anymore anyway—but it does.
They’ve practiced this part often enough that there’s something almost calm and settling about it. They all separate and swing over to their packs, taking all their equipment out for a once-over for craziness that might have happened in travel. Sam finishes first, and heads out of the meeting tent to start the mechanized little cart carrying some of their supplies. Dean hears him retching outside again before the noise of the motor starts up.
He didn’t bottom for Cas as often as the other way around—they both liked it a whole damned lot, yeah, but there was no getting around the fact that it took a lot more fuss to get through the whole deal than it did when Cas presented for him like his body was made for it. Dean loved the careful gliding feeling of Cas’s long, slender fingers in him, and the delighted expression on Cas’s face every time Dean reached back to open
But maybe he’s got something else. It’s like he said: the body he wears—Jimmy’s body—isn’t really his. Isn’t really him.
Their daughter is lying all the way sprawled like a puppy over Cas, completely horizontal and facedown, her knees and shoulders supported by the bolsters of the pillow nest. She still probably wouldn’t be able to keep balanced where she is if not for the fact that Cas has one hand draped on her back to steady her, even dead asleep like he is. Rachel’s bright red Steve McQueen is stuffed under his chin.
“Novak says the eggs will be ready tomorrow,” Naomi told him, in lieu of a greeting, when he walked into her office. Castiel’s feet felt numb in a way that had nothing to do with the padding in his boots; he wasn’t sure how he hadn’t tripped on his way there. Familiarity, probably, from all the times he’d walked that path. “I’ve told Ellen and Donna. Can you talk to Jody and see what gear we’ll need to requisition? All the trainee rooms in the Rookery will be full, after this. I know you can keep the hatchlings from fighting, but trainees are more…” She pursed her lips. “Volatile.”
They looked out together over the walled city surrounding the Magisterium—the high walls that glowed, just faintly, with Sentinel incantations, refreshed four times a day by whatever Sentinels were in residence; the long row houses that were actually wood, rather than stone, because they trusted in the Magisterium to protect them against the storm. In the distance, clouds danced across the sky, but Dean was starting to be able to tell the difference now: they were just clouds.
The man looked at them, back and forth, and scratched his beard. He sighed, and his shoulders dipped. “Your daddy said the same,” he muttered, “not six months before he ran away with your mom. And look how
They both pause to watch Monster Zero get freed, the rumbling drama of the collapse of the base and the lightning intensity of the massive dragon heads rising from the ice. Dean doesn’t take his eyes off the screen.
“Most of the time I find it a little sweaty, honestly,” Castiel answered hesitantly. He truly didn’t like that Dean hadn’t answered the important part of the question. “But I’d be happy to work on it.”
The beauty of him smooths out again when Castiel lowers his hand again. His thumb brushes back and forth against Dean’s temple, where the first few sparks of grey are starting to show, like evening stars.
That was unlikely to happen, though. Lollipop—no one had any idea if that was the actual name of Gabriel’s playful blue dragon, but that was what Gabriel had been insisting it was since the day Lolly had hatched, and he answered to it—probably wouldn’t have left Eden Weyr even if Gabriel had wanted to go. Even if Naomi told them to go. Even if
Cas sits patiently as Jack and his three friends look over calendars and make a fuss over him. But Dean reaches out to pet the upper curve of where his wings are fluffed—so
Most of the Weyr and all of the dragonriders turned out to watch the spectacle of the dragons taking off on a queen’s mating flight—as always. It was rare for the dragons to gather in bunches like this on other occasions, but in the thin morning sunlight, Angel was
“Sure, man,” Dean answers, immediately. “I mean, was already planning on it, weren’t you? I got a stack of really good stuff for you. Can’t believe you’ve never seen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. But you gotta bring along one of your sci-fi things, too, or else Sammy’s gonna complain.”
bit intimidated by the director of NASA, or a big fancy general, or… whatever Henricksen is (Dean’s pretty sure by this point that he’s not just some random FBI agent either).
Cas settled, then, the sense coming back into his eyes as he looked back and forth between them. He never tried to pretend he hadn’t done something stupid. But he never tried to explain why he was doing it, either.
The next day, as Dean drops himself into his now-usual lunch seat, Castiel rolls an apple across the table towards him. Well, Dean doesn’t exactly know it’s an apple when he moves to stop it, just sees motion at the edges of his vision and slaps out at it, automatically, with his left hand. (His right goes to his belt knife, where it’s secured inside his pants with the hilt peeking out over his belt line.)
But it made him smile when Sam give him a big grin and started eating his piece in tiny little bites, ‘cause Sam was just weird like that. He always felt like he had to make everything last rather than eating it all at once the way Dean did.
saying is that maybe we wait until we all survive this to have a sleepover and braid each other’s hair, huh?” Dean answers, reaching out to flick Sam’s long hair off his cheek. “Or maybe me
(He was so beautiful, aroused. Even knowing it was only Dean's own dragonfever didn't keep Castiel from being grateful, in the tiny part of him not consumed by the rising tide of
Dean sighs, and kicks hard at the edge of the inn comforter with his toes, then gestures to the mattress. “Don’t be stupid,” he growls, flopping over to face the wall anyway and then turning to glare over his shoulder when Cas doesn’t move. “Get in here. Can’t have you waking up the rest of the inn with your nightmares.”
The little green, when she finally made her way out of her egg, sniffed at Ambriel and eyed Lisa thoughtfully before trotting over towards Bela—a snooty young woman with a rich, rolling accent. Castiel had heard that she was the daughter of one of the Council, which explained why her linens were accented with gold thread and why she was here, at a Weyr very distant from her own home. The baby blue dragon, right on her heels, Impressed on Muriel—an equally petite blonde from Paradise Weyr who, unlike many other Candidates, had been very polite to Castiel when she’d brushed him in passing in the hallway.
Castiel knows his truth in a way that, he thinks, few angels will ever bother to: if there is nothing else that his years of being a friend to the Winchesters,
(Smiling feels really good. His lips move right, not stiff or numb anymore, the way they’ve been for days.)
Dean was looking right at him, and his face was sharp, jaw a bright angle like there was something too tight underneath his skin. Castiel saw Dean’s mouth move, just out of the corners of his eyes. He thought he almost heard his voice, Dean calling his name, even among the cheers for everyone else.
Benny and Lafitte had left at the end of last year, returning to Louisiana Weyr by the invitation of its Weyrwoman, Andrea. Even knowing that it would have likely had to happen eventually—bronzes had a stronger mating drive than any other color, and not being able to fly queen flights was
“Wanna see how you like a finger while I’m sucking you?” Castiel’s soulmate said, holding up the packet he’d extracted from his jeans. Oh, lubricant.
Dean stabs a finger towards it and takes a step back, cradling his fist to his chest. “Don't touch me. Don't fucking touch me.”
,” Dean objects, flushing brightly enough that it eradicates his freckles—already fading with fall, Castiel had noticed. “You don’t have to… shit. Look, I swear I can be an adult and take care of myself on a good day!” There’s something about the stiff, defensive way Dean says that that makes Castiel frown—that makes him wonder how often someone has told Dean the opposite. Or how often he’s told
“New sim today, right?” Garth says, like nothing unusual happened. But he hands Cas’s suit jacket back to him with a few hearty pats on the shoulder. He’s grinning. “Joshua promised us a new sim.”
It was summer, yeah. But the ambient temperature in the bunker was generally pretty comfortable, both in winter
“I, uh, sorry, it’s just…” he squirms a little, embarrassed, but finally says, “Is it okay if I use your bathroom?”
Sam blinks. “Really?” He looks around and peers at the little wisps of soft grey cloud in the sky. “It doesn’t look like it.”
It’s not the first time Dean’s dad has said something to make them mind and not get them all kicked off the reservation. But yeah, Dean thinks it’s probably the first time he’s ever looked at the mad dog and snapped the leash.
But when Dean looks up, Cas is watching him hopefully. “You’re always nice,” he says warmly. “That’s obvious from the fact that you were even willing to call me back and give me a second chance, even thinking that I was, well… springing an atypical relationship on you,” A shy little dimple peeks out of the corner of full pink lips that Dean’s only just barely had a taste of. “I’ve known you were kind since you helped after my car broke down, though.”
So he just bites off the rest of that statement, chews it, and swallows it before nodding at the other three.
,” he chokes, lust and memory the size of a walnut in his throat—remembering the feel of Cas’s cock thick and hot in his hand as Dean kneeled with him to make sure Cas got his, too. That tie ended up yanked back off and crumpled into a ball, thrown to the side, because Dean wanted to suck on his Adam’s apple when he jerked him off. “Cas, man, you can’t just… you can’t just spring that on me like that.”
Cas rumbles, more purr and sensation than sound. “Dean…” he says, and then again into that little sensitive spot on Dean’s shoulder. “
” Castiel interjected, alarmed, and barely kept from covering his ears. “No, thank you. I don’t want to know.”
“I know we’ve only been on a few dates,” Castiel says softly, “but would you like to come to my home next time? We could have dinner, and you could meet Grace.”
“In Bobby terms, halfway past tarnation but not all the way to damnation,” Cas says, and flicks a tiny smile in Dean’s direction that hurts more sweetly than stretching after a long nap, preferably in a place Dean shouldn’t be napping in.
They’re gonna do this like hunters do, it looks like: without the public knowing what they’re up to. Somehow, Dean’s okay with that.
Castiel thought that should startle him, but his whole body felt heavy and hot and empty. His white linens stuck to his back and to his legs and
“Sure, sure. He’s a bit odd, and no mistake,” Donna told him, unfazed. “Never met a movie he couldn’t get wrong. He’ll prob’ly never know the right thing to say. If you ask if a dress makes you look fat, he’ll say ‘yes’ and not even tell how how pretty the color is with your eyes.”
That’s how they end up with Cas’s shirt off, both of them sitting on the little calf-high ledge that separates the motel shower from the rest of the bathroom. And, well… okay, so, yeah, Dean
Cas doesn’t call any of them on the fact that none of them are too worried about the fact that they’ll have to walk the whole way through a literal other dimension, but they’re
For a moment, he thought that his best friend wasn’t going to answer. Dean was staring straight ahead at the little rough oval of eggs, each in their carefully-dug little bowl of sand so that none of them tipped over—Novak’s clutch mixed comfortably together with Barnes’s so that they could enjoy each other’s warmth before they started to pip. The only one that was off by itself was the gold egg, and she was cradled carefully between Novak’s paws at the edge of the sands.
He trails off. Because saying “I’ve never had to share” sounds so fucking childish. It’s not the truth—it’s not at all; he shared
“She’s not. Just bein’ a bitch. See? Cas here can say ‘Fuck you and the dragon you flew in on,’ while still being caring, Princess,” Dean said sweetly. “So who’s up for pool tonight?” he asked, his mouth full of the piece of bread he’d just shoved into it. Castiel wrinkled his nose as Dean masticated—that was really the only word for it.
The first wave of this is… okay. They’re up to their ass in zombies, and yeah, it sucks. The fog and the weather outside the circle have gotten thicker and thicker the longer they’ve been moving. It doesn’t get
Castiel wasn’t surprised that he was the only one of the former Candidates who’d bothered to attend school today.
“Of course,” Castiel answers, closing the door behind him. Dean doesn’t have a coat hanger in his entryway, he notices—there’s a chair near the door that has three coats and a jacket slung haphazardly over it, and Castiel carefully lays his on top of the pile. “But… we should exchange phone numbers. Just in case. For the future.”
, of all people, to be arbiter for this particular… odd situation. Maybe familiarity with Eden Weyr—of course, since he’d been raised here. Maybe familiarity with Castiel.
And why the heck anyone would think about lending Dean Winchester anything, when Dean’s just as likely to be gone tomorrow as he is to be here by exams is beyond him. But he guesses people who live in houses and go to the same school every day don’t think like that.
Castiel stared at her. “That’s a joke in terrible taste,” he said disapprovingly. “Even for you.” His fingers curled into the surface of the table, the grain of it catching on his fingertips. It was a distraction, but not enough of one. There was not enough distraction in the entire Weyr from the temptation of that thought.
Rowena, after an arched, silent moment, smiled—a long, slow pull at the corners of her lips. It looked like approval. It looked like
Cas frowns at him. “I don’t know why you’d say that, Dean,” he says, in that too-serious way he’s got, all eyeballs and lips. “You’re as smart as Sam, and I know you expect
. Which scared Dean a lot more than a skinny know-it-all ginger, because what the hell; she couldn’t be
Maybe that says things about how sane Dean is, himself, these days. But he’s trying. Goddammit, he’s
The only one of them who looks comfortable there is Sam, nodding and already pulling out a notebook from his pack to take notes. Jo picks at her nails with a knife. Rufus lets out one deep snort that turns into a loud rattling snore. “I’m too old to go back to school,” he complains.
“I’d like to experiment with it, too,” Castiel said honestly. “But I don’t want you to be in pain. I also liked being inside you very much, so no matter how much I enjoy the reciprocal, don’t expect me to give that up.”
write something for Dean in the first place—silly as it was, he’s always been so much more eloquent with the fictional written word than he ever was out loud. (Yes, as someone who dictates his stories and has for the past few years, he realizes the irony of that statement. Nonetheless, it’s true.) Dean has seen his writing, and has seen
Cas blinks, and the tiny, pretty little smile hovering around his lips turns its way back downwards like it took a nosedive off a cliff.
Or, for that matter, like John and his sons, who would have had a hard time finding a space anywhere else.
was an experiment in ‘what the fuck;’ Dean wasn’t quite desperate enough to go on Google, but he was getting close—until he can tuck the softness of it into the ring of his fingers and just suck back and forth at the head. He’d play with it a little, normally, but maybe another time.
Naomi hadn’t looked even remotely surprised when Castiel had come to her office to tell her that he was standing for a Hatching at nineteen.
Dean lifted his head off Castiel’s pillow. “Oh, huh. Yeah, you’re right.” He dropped his head back and chewed on his lower lip. “I guess that’s true.” He sounded a little happier about that. “That’s okay, then. You’re right, that’s more important. You’ll be fine by yourself in your new dragonrider room without us.”
Dean collects a tray table—mashed potatoes, gravy, some kind of pot roast—and surveys the crowd. Dad is sitting with Rufus, their heads leaning in. Sam’s by himself at the end of a table, scrunched in a corner with his notebook already open under one hand, his other shoveling food into his mouth. Dean doesn’t see Garth, Benny or Jo at first—oh, they’re still up there in the meal line, Garth saying something to Joshua that involves a lot of arm waving and a few alarmed looks from the rest of the line—but Gordon’s taken up position with some guys in BDUs.
“I met a Fate once,” Garth muses. “It was, uh, right before Texas. She was nice, though. Told me Bess and I were gonna have twins someday.”
“Look, having someone inside my head with the attention span of an angry fire-breathing goldfish isn’t always fun,” Meg answered, smirking, “The way I see it, dragonfever is one of the
in just the right way. It wasn’t too much, the way Dean was sure a mouth or even a hand on his cock would’ve been—
He jerks himself free of where he just took a step towards it. Dean realizes he’s sweating cold, thick droplets. He hasn’t sweat, he doesn’t think, since they stepped through the gate, and these ones are rolling and tacky as… as…
to be an FBI agent—though Cas has clearly stuck his fingers into it, because it’s flipped back-to-front again, and the knot is hanging somewhere at the level of the divot of his collarbone. Which Dean can see, because he unbuttoned the first couple of buttons. His throat is long and bare, and there’s a delicate shadow of strap muscle down the side of it. He doesn’t need a shave yet, but by tomorrow, he definitely will.
John Winchester turns and strides away before Dean responds. Not that Dean was going to anyway. “Burn them,” he calls out to the group. “And reform positions. We’re moving out. Henricksen, you’re on point again.”
nice for them to sit together in the communal indoor basking pits—three large rings of grey volcanic sand, each about thrice the size of the little dragonet ‘nests’ attached to each room in the Rookery.
Castiel blinks at him. His full, gorgeous pink mouth, with its little dip in the upper lip, tips open, and then closes again.
But that isn’t exactly a conversation they’ve had since their last argument. It also isn’t a discussion that they’ve had with Eileen—or, well, Mildred, whose inn this is.
Dean doesn’t care about whether or not he’s about to get his ass whooped, but fuck, he’s gotten sent away before, when his dad looked at him like that. But for once, Dean doesn’t know what the fuck he
since the last military expedition into the gate. Yeah, Dean gets that for pretty much his entire life, their whole deal has been about
Castiel nodded his silent agreement, his head moving creakily up and down like the handle of a pump. Dean
Dean chokes out a small wet laugh. He looks up and pretends he can see stars and clouds overhead. “Me, too, and I’m willing to bet I know a lot more people who like knives than you do.”
No, it hadn’t been Cas’s angelness that had made him a weirdo—as evidenced by where Dean finally found him.
Cas raised an eyebrow at him and lowered the bottle, looked unimpressed. He sure as hell did not bare throat and submit the way Dean’s hormones were telling him that his mate should. And he didn’t look one bit intimidated.
Cas is the one who draws him back into a second hug. He’s quiet about it, like he maybe thinks it’s something they shouldn’t be doing. But Dean doesn’t say anything about that, and neither does Cas. His hand cups the back of Dean’s neck, warm and shaky. It’s trembling.
“Heh,” Dean chuckles. That sweet, solicitous smile that Cas has got on his face right now, well… Dean’s not sure when the last time was that he thought a six-foot-tall guy with heartbreaker eyes and thighs that strain the fabric of his thin dark slacks—because Cas wears
“Grace!” Cas says, in that low earthquake rasp of his that normally makes the insides of Dean’s thighs tingle. “That was
It wasn’t that Dean wasn’t occasionally hurtful—he was, and thoughtless, brash and beautiful. But he wouldn’t mock Castiel with that.
He’s sitting with a pile of walkie-talkies on a spare uniform to keep the dust out of them, rewiring them in pretty much the same way he used to rig EMF detectors out of a Walkman when he was a kid—they’re probably going to screech like a
Yes, even though Fitzgerald was already more than big enough that he couldn’t be altogether comfortable sleeping in one of the tiny sand pits attached to the Rookery’s rooms. Castiel wasn’t really sure how he even
It’d be so easy to say nothing at all. So fucking easy. They could go back to pretending. They could go back to when things were… comfortable.
Castiel adjusted the straps of the heavy pack on his back; it sloshed, full and unwieldy as always. Angel leaned over to give him the support of her neck as he rebalanced it, grimacing. “Someday,” he called out to Charlie—the little blue rider with the red hair and the nonstop energy who’d moved to Eden about a year ago, bringing the idea that had led them to where they were today—“we’ll figure out a way to make these easier to carry.”
Benny waits a few more seconds – waits for Dean to fall still. Then he nods his head forward, gesturing loosely for Dean to go ahead. “Now, dig.”
Kevin whistles. “Damn. I wonder how he got into freeing slaves? It seems so wild that a rich alpha like him would–”
When they’d cut them off at the holding facility, his arms had felt so light he’d thought they’d float away. He’d cried like a bitch yesterday when they’d cuffed his hands behind his back to move him out of his cell. The guard had slapped him for his trouble.
Something that can only be described as mischief sparkles in Dean’s eyes, then. “I bet you can figure it out, Cas.”
Sorry this one is a little later than usual, folks! I really struggled with it for some reason, and a lot of it was stuff that I had only blocked in and hadn't actually drafted... Anywho. Hope y'all are having a great week. For my Thanksgiving-celebrators; we're almost there! 5 more days until a break!
Guilt worms its way into Dean’s stomach. Just like him to crash land in someone else’s life and fuck it up. And he isn’t even allowed to be
The alpha’s scent wafts up every time he shifts, curling around him like an oversized, purring cat. Dean thinks maybe he could fall asleep right here, just like this; standing upright in a dark room with flickering screens and soft static. Trapped by his own pathetic fear.
Appreciation for Balthazar’s fierce loyalty and fear for Dean war inside of him. On the one hand, it is nice to be defended. On the other, he knows that he doesn’t deserve it.
Drumming his fingers on the table, Sam finally breaks and gives in to his curiosity. He flips the notepad to a blank page, writes down the number attached. It’s something with an unfamiliar area code. Whoever it is, they aren’t from around here.
if you wanna,” Dean said into Cas’s hair. Cas nodded against him, so Dean continued. “I won’t pretend to know what’s happening, but if there’s trouble in paradise, you’re more than welcome to stay with us for a while.” His desperation was
Cas doesn’t even blink. Dean gets the feeling he’d been anticipating that question. He sets down his bowl carefully, mulling his words over before he speaks. “Your file caught our attention,” he says slowly.

I was afraid of that,” he chokes, ashamed of himself, ashamed that he can’t go ten minutes without an absolute freak-out. What will Cas’s employees think, if he’s spent nearly three months with the man and is still melting down over getting in an
“I was just saying,” Cas continues, his eyes lingering on Dean for a long moment before he returns his attention to the woman at the front desk, “that I’d like to introduce you to Mrs. Fitzgerald.”
Swaying in exhaustion as he kneels, Dean nearly topples over and touches his hands to the carpet to steady himself. When he realizes what he’s doing, he snatches them back, and they flutter around his body for a moment like he can’t decide where to put them. Eventually, shaking as he does so, he grips his arms behind his back like he’s done a few times before now.
Heart pounding, Castiel edges forward, faltering when Dean tenses impossibly farther, his grip white knuckled around his own forearms, his breath escaping in short, sharp pants. He pushes forward, sits at his side and does the only thing he thinks he can.
Benny makes a low, sympathetic noise. “Right. So, to put it as simply as I can, your body learned that
It may be insignificant, but Castiel can’t help but feel a little victorious that he was able to find something Dean finds comfort in.
“You can go ahead and pull up your pants, Dean, but I’d like to do a quick ultrasound on your abdominal scarring. As long as you’re alright with that.”
He struggles to his feet as quickly as he’s able to, and resists the urge to pace. He can hear the man bumbling around in the room, can hear the hiss of the scent neutralizing spray and the spritz of disinfectant.
Castiel frowns at him, and Dean deflates. Looks back down at his lap, his expression twisting into something bordering on frustrated. “I don’t know how to explain it to you. It was something I wanted, last night, but I don’t now. Don’t want it all the time. Just… just when things are too much.”
Rick backs up another step, exchanging a bewildered look with the other handler. “Easy there, tiger.
“They have cut you down in ways I can’t even begin to understand,” his master says softly, and Dean swallows, face flushing in shame at how right he is, “and I’m so sorry for that. But the things that got you punished in their households will
When he does finally look up, he smiles. The expression is pleased, and genuine, and Dean feels a little buzz of satisfaction at that. Fuck his pride, or whatever – he’s happy to make the alpha happy. Makes him feel ten feet tall.

can’t call up the image of Cas holding him in his arms like he can with every other time that’s happened. And it’s not because Dean was panicking – he’s done that often enough, and still, those moments with Cas are crystal fucking clear, high definition memories of safety and security that he’s gonna treasure for the rest of his life.
He rolled his shoulders again, and the twinges of pain that shot down his back almost made him change his mind. Almost. But he had already put this off for far too long, and there was nobody around that would help him. He was on his own.
it, though – it's not his choice, being an alpha. Dean turns his back to Claire and catches his eye, smiling at him when he focuses. “Take a breath, Cas,” he says softly.
“Good morning, Dean,” he says, glancing him up and down with a visible sort of approval that makes Dean warm. “How is your knee?”
When he looks up, Dean has curled in on himself, his knees drawn up to his chest. He’s blinking groggily, staring at the floor of the tub as though he doesn’t understand what he’s looking at or even where he is. Tentatively, hand shaking, he reaches down and touches the tips of his fingers to the water creeping up around him. His eyes widen.
He looks at the bed for a long time before he takes the blanket off of it and clutches it in his hand. Apparently he really

“Yes,” the woman replied simply. Dean waited for a beat for her to ask a follow up question or offer more information, but she said nothing more. From behind a spinning rack, Cas approached, holding up a leather cord with a plain dark disk attached.
Castiel can’t even begin to imagine what he could say to make Dean understand that isn’t the case. So he says nothing. He leads Dean into the house, snagging a blanket off the couch on his way to the kitchen. When he hands it over, the omega holds it like a live grenade.
Has he really been that transparent? He’s already told Dean about his physical feelings, at least, but he hasn’t said anything about the
But Dean just shakes his head, the simplicity of his words making them all the more impactful, shots to Castiel’s chest that feel so good they hurt. “You ain’t your family, Cas. You can’t blame yourself for the shit they’ve done.” He pauses.
Sam drops his eyes after a while, looking fragile in the silence. He scrubs at his face and fixes his eyes on the floor.
Moving slowly, he stretches out his legs until his toes point forward, and takes in a deep breath. And, as he shifts, he realizes that there’s something warm and heavy draped over his back.
She rubs the bridge of her nose like an overworked kindergarten teacher. “Of course not. I’m not saying either one of you should

wants this – doesn’t know if last night was a one-off, or a product of a particularly rough day, or if it’s something that Dean might consistently desire.
“I can’t use that as an excuse,” Castiel argues, guilt twisting in him at the very thought. “I’ll never use that as an excuse.”
The words make something uncomfortable shift inside of him, a feeling he’s beginning to become familiar with but doesn’t want to examine too closely. If he does, he knows he isn’t going to like what he sees.
He stares down at the omega with his heart in his throat. The lines that normally score his face are gone, smoothed away by the first truly peaceful sleep that he has gotten in far too long. His chest rises and falls slowly.
to stem the frankly alarming amount of blood pouring out of him to say as much. “Just because Winchester’s napping during the day doesn’t mean
His first wild, pathetic thought had been to beg. To plead with Cas to keep him, even though he doesn’t want to. But he can’t do that –
Sam had always been dead-set on moving to California, or at least on someday living near a beach. They’d never gone, as kids. Not once. But Sammy had seen beaches on TV, had read about them in books, and the kid had become enamored with the idea of someday spending an afternoon wandering in warm sand, picking up seashells, swimming in clear blue water. He’d fallen in love with the type of sunshine and glittering blue beauty that he’d never had a chance to see. He’d been desperate for the sort of peace that Dean had never had a chance to give him.
She gives him a sad sort of smile in return, something soft in her gaze. “You’ve got a lot of kindness inside of you, Dean Winchester.”
The Cas that he’s looking at now is nothing like that cold, blank man he’d seen in his nightmares. The Cas that he’s looking at now is
he feels like this, though he’s fuzzy on the details. He yawns, stretching his arms above his head, and the movement makes the water in the tub slosh around.
He traces patterns on Cas’s back, nuzzles a little closer until his nose is in the crook of the alpha’s neck. Enjoys the warmth and the soft, content scent coming from him. He sighs as the last of the tension leaves his body.
The alpha’s jaw tightens a little, but he nods, shooting Dean a questioning glance. Dean can only nod too, and try not to whine when Cas sneaks his hand over Dean’s shoulder and squeezes briefly before reluctantly departing downstairs. The loss of that cooling touch is nearly enough to make him cry.
Cas draws him in closer, and Dean follows his guiding hand easily, sighing as the alpha wraps his arms around him. They sit like that for a while, until Dean doesn’t feel like he needs to bolt anymore.
Predictably, a wash of fury floods the room, and Dean’s rage disintegrates into pure, stomach twisting fear; he flinches back and covers his head, knowing that alphas love to make him bleed when they’re pissed and that they’ll aim for whatever’s most convenient. But instead of boiling over, Castiel’s anger simmers, then fades until it evaporates completely. In its place is something else, something softer and sadder that wraps around them both until Dean can’t stand it anymore.
be freaking out right now. A lot has happened to him over the past few days, after all. A lot of things that have sent him into tailspin after tailspin, nosedive after nosedive. Not the least of which was the friggin’ story he just told Cas. Dean’s not even sure why he did that – why, suddenly, it was so vividly clear to him that it’s what Cas needed to hear. How he had known that he had nothing to fear now, that he really could tell the alpha about his old life. How he’s really had nothing to fear all along.
Cas looked pained at the idea. He allowed Dean to guide him up the hill silently, chewing on his words. “I know that our lifestyle is not suitable for children,” he said after a while, sighing. “But I find myself wishing…”
Dean glanced at Cas out of the corner of his eye. The angel was looking innocently at the middle distance, his hands clasped lightly in front of him, but he could see the tension in his shoulders. Whatever it was that had been bothering Cas last night was clearly still bothering him now, and he wasn’t real keen on dumping the angel in a room with a moody teenager on top of it.
of attacks like Hell endured are never identified, whether they live or not. Some misguided attempt by the government to protect them from further violence, should they survive. But the tip about Dean himself had come from an inside source, and so it’s possible that the information is out there somewhere.
for Dean to go anywhere undressed, even after a shower – he’s quite meticulous about being fully clothed when he’s out and about. Castiel can easily understand why.
“Dean…” And, God, Dean looks up at him with those big green eyes, wide and scared. He doesn’t want to ruin this – but he can’t stop now. Can’t let Dean make this decision uninformed. “Balthazar pointed out to me that it’s very likely we’ve...”
, Castiel realizes. High on pheromones. Outside of heats and ruts, this sort of state is rare – but he supposes that Dean is scared enough and malnourished enough and
Cas turned and squared his shoulders to the water. It was dark, gently lapping up against the small strip of sand by its edge. He took a breath of the warm night air, and before he could convince himself not to, he turned back to Dean. “Are you coming?”
So he didn’t stop to think. Didn’t allow himself to analyze any more than he already had tonight, because really, his heart couldn’t take more. He pulled at his trenchcoat, which had obediently morphed to accommodate his wings, and now shifted again so he could slip it off, the fibers weaving apart and then back together again as the coat hit the grass. Layer by layer, he removed the rest of his clothing until he was standing in nothing but his boxers.
Sam looks taken aback for a precious moment. Then he hardens again; cocks his jaw and looks away. He looks very young, even in his nice slacks and button-up; even with his solid, lean runner’s body. Castiel reminds himself that Sam
Cas doesn’t laugh. He just squeezes Dean’s hand again, and pulls back onto the road. “I wish I’d known you back then,” he says wistfully, a perfect echo of Dean’s thoughts from before.
Dean swallows, shaking himself, and comes back to the present. The blonde woman behind the desk has an easy smile on her face, something that  makes Dean feel comfortable. Unlike Meg, the woman has a matronly air about her. She’s older than Dean – older than Cas, too. He likes her immediately.
doesn’t surprise Castiel either. This, too, is something that his friend used to do all the time. These waiting games, where Castiel was never sure if he was supposed to push, pretend like nothing was wrong, or keep his mouth shut entirely.
They sit together, intertwined, for a very long time. Dean can feel the last of his anxiety falling away, can feel a weight lift off his shoulders. He feels settled. Calm. Like he can

“I didn’t know,” they insisted in a whisper. “I didn’t know that’s what it meant. I just. I didn’t want to be
Initially, Cas stiffens when Dean leans against him. He’s obviously surprised, and with good reason – Dean ain’t exactly been the one to reach out first for this kind of stuff, not since Balthazar came over. But he does now, twining his fingers with the alpha’s and reminding himself that he’s safe, he’s safe, he’s safe.
Cas closed his eyes and let his hand fall to his bare thigh. He seemed to deflate, all the tension and anger seeping out of him. Now, Dean allowed himself to move. He helped the angel up and pulled him to lie limply against his chest. Cas hooked his chin over Dean’s shoulder, breathing hard.
Despite the circumstances, Castiel can’t help the slight smile that tugs at the corners of his mouth. “I am not. Read for yourself.”
There’s something soft in Castiel’s gaze that Dean is too pissed off to understand. “I was probably better off,” he says gently. “My family was… is. Not progressive. To say the least.” He sounds supremely uncomfortable. “Being raised away from them and those ideals probably kept me from becoming a much worse human being. So I suppose I’m grateful.”
none aside from his own – bright white and soft and not at all clean enough for use as a bandage, and he curses again. He jams his hand under the sink and hisses as the cold water makes the cut sting fiercely.
that,” he mumbles. He’d sound petulant if he wasn’t so exhausted. “Would’ve locked the damn door, if I’d known you were gonna come up here.”
Dean turned around to share an amused look with Scott, but the kid wasn’t paying attention. Instead, they were staring up at the news that was playing on the old box TV mounted in the corner above the register, their arms limp at their sides.
“I mean I, uh. I kinda. I lost my temper,” he admits, voice small. “His situation is… it’s complicated. And when I showed up there, they didn’t know who I was. Some stuff got…”
Sighing, Castiel shakes his head. “No. Up until that day, he’d been solely at my home due to the capacity limits. I… failed to mention it.” He swallows the still
himself relax, lets himself curl his head forward and press his face to Castiel’s collarbone, his guilt caught in his throat. His hands catch the fabric at the back of the alpha’s shirt and hold on tight.
one at that. The way he’d spoken yesterday had told Castiel so much – had told him exactly what kind of person Dean’s father had been. Cruel. Harsh with his words and with his actions. Uncaring, narcissistic, and destructive, with a victim complex a mile wide.
Beside him, Balthazar has materialized and matched his stride perfectly, his hands crammed into his pockets and his scarf over his nose. His eyes are trained on Castiel closely. “Where’s Winchester?”
The hunger creeps in slowly, at first, and then all at once – Dean can’t believe he hadn’t felt it before. He
Taking a steadying breath, he tastes a little of Dean’s natural scent for the first time in the back of his throat. It’s omega sweet, of course, along with notes of something else that he’s too far away to identify.
The words are cold. Castiel studies Dean for a long time, until the omega looks back up at him – his expression is fierce, but Castiel can see the hurt there, too.
And even though he’s done it more than once now to calm Dean down when he’s panicking, this is the first time he’s done it just
Oblivious, Cas settles in next to him. Their knees are touching. Just for something to do, Dean takes a sip of his tea.
He feels Cas’s hand on his arm a moment later, and it’s such an emotional whiplash that he feels like he’s starting to get a headache. “As much as I’d like to see you getting some physical activity,” Cas says, “The trainer is… well.”
Stomach twisting painfully, he closes his eyes and grips his knees. Dean had truly believed that his only reason for helping him was to use him as an
I thought I fucked up so bad – not that you fucked up!” he adds in a rush, looking up at Castiel with a wild expression. “That’s not what I meant!”
, and the man still wonders if Dean wants to steal his shirts. Instead of answering, he holds his hand out and gestures for the bundle impatiently. A flicker of a smile appears on the corners of Cas’s mouth as Dean drops his towel to his waist and wriggles into the shirt, the fabric sticking to his skin a little. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Dean drops his gaze back to his lap. Nods. He doesn’t know how to feel about that – considering all the other things his heart is having to deal with, the news that John is MIA doesn’t even have the power to touch him right now.
Meg shrugs. She pops her gum, leaning to the side to get a better look at Dean past Castiel – and at their clasped hands. She raises her eyebrow, lets out a low whistle. “
Still, the alpha doesn’t relent. Stubbornly, he shifts until he’s leaning forward, his chin resting on his fist with his feet flat on the ground. And for the first time, he actively watches Dean nest, abandoning the pretense of watching the news entirely.
They slowed, no longer pushing and pulling apart, but just laying together. Breathing hard. Castiel propped himself up on his elbows, knot buried tight in Dean’s ass. Dean flopped down hard onto the grass and ran his fingers through his wet hair, exhaling hard on a laugh. He sat up an inch and gazed at Cas, looking sated.
“Nope,” Balthazar disagrees cheerfully. “I think you’ve spent a long time being braver than anyone should have to be. You’re entitled to take your time,” he reminds the kid, shaking his head. “Entitled to move slowly. Just so long as you’re
thing he’s had in years, and he wants to hold onto that novel feeling for a little while longer. Maybe that’s selfish, or ungrateful. But he does it anyway, and Cas makes it easy, because he never pushes.
Dean is too fucked up to ever be fixed, and he knows it. But here he is, no fresh bruises on his body, no fear of going hungry hanging over his head. Sitting here, on the
Pam pushes her glasses above her forehead, rubbing at her eyes. “That kid is a lot stronger than even I gave him credit for,” she says. “I honestly thought this was going to be a whole other can of worms when I came. Figured it was going to be a talk off the ledge, that he was going to be out of his mind terrified because of those false heats from before.”

is really the type of thing that will help Dean along on his recovery – it’s not a happy story, by any means. But that hasn’t really seemed to matter. Over the last few days, it has taken Dean less and less time to relax into the mattress as Castiel progresses through the pages. Tonight, he’d fallen asleep before they had even finished the chapter.
Underneath him, the boards of the dock creak when he takes a seat, protesting until he settles. He wraps his arms around his legs. Stares out at the water with nothing but static in his mind.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice is serious, earnest, and Dean already knows that he’s about to start pouring out reassurances and kindnesses about how he’s safe here, and how he has nothing to fear. And while he appreciates it... he doesn’t really want to hear it.
“Because no one ever even sees that dude,” she snaps, tapping her foot on the ground. “He’s a recluse, or something. That’s what everyone says.”
Dean would laugh at that, except he’s too busy curling in on himself like he’s been hit. He’s thinking back to what he’d thought Cas wanted him for in the first place, all those weeks ago. Thinking back to how he’d believed the alpha wanted to
I do the finances here,” he says, the most distant edge of a laugh in his tone. “If anyone here can take time off to help someone with their recovery, it’s me.”
He tries to reason with himself. Tries to make excuses. It was bound to happen sooner or later, right? Sleeping every night with Cas was gonna affect him no matter what he did. Hell, even
Dean shrugs, looking away. “I meant… I meant that I’m grateful you don’t make me sit in that chair, even though we both know it’s what you want. I’m grateful you pulled the stupid mattress off the bed-frame last night instead of making me sleep up there, because you didn’t want me to have nightmares. I’m grateful you made me a breakfast you know I like because it’s gonna be a rough day, probably, and you wanted to start it off good. I’m grateful that you’re
easy to find, luckily. He limps slowly back to the main hall, quietly taking in the sights and sounds and smells. He can scent plenty of omegas, and some faint hints of a beta here and there, but the only alpha smell he can pick up on is Castiel’s – and he’s pretty sure it’s only because they’re bonded. No other alphas seem to be around. It seems strange, at first, but then he realizes that’s probably entirely intentional.
How easily Dean spoke, how easily he shattered Castiel’s heart. How could Dean possibly understand how much those words hurt? How much he was dangling in front of Cas? How much he was allowing his hope to grow, only to be crushed again later?
especially when an alpha is angry. His whole body feels cold. His heart feels trembling and small. A tiny mouse in his chest.

“Glad my trauma can be of service to you,” Dean replies grumpily, and for a moment Cas balks because he thinks he’s serious – but Dean grins at him, some weird mixture of tentative and mischievous.
