It was too much - too rough, too hard, too fast, too much. Pure sensation: not pleasure and not pain but rather some hot electric shock of feeling like all his nerves were exposed, his insides were exposed. Bucked on reflex, tried to pull away on reflex, wanted to struggle on instinct but he was pinned firmly in place, Sherlock above him and inside him and around him, the movements merciless.
The two of them stilled, petrified in their bed, listening. And there it was, curling into their ears, seeping into their bones... the ghostly, disembodied voice of a child singing, beautiful and pure, carried on the night wind.
In the school gymnasium, at this very moment, John will be dancing with some girl named Clara. He will be sliding his hand to her waist, holding her in the way that the crooners sing about, the way that most red-blooded teenage girls dream of being held.
“Oh, god, yes,” John said, pushing his hips forward so he could rub himself against Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock immediately took his hand away. Jerk.
85 miles per hour on Rte 466 and near head-on collision. Failed side-stepping racing maneuver; any moron would have seen that they didn’t have enough space or enough time. Multitrauma: left foot crush injury, broken cervical spine, internal bleeding; hemorrhage likely. Nearest hospital 28 miles away, pronounced dead on arrival.
Home: the black door with the gleaming bronze letters, the wallpaper with the bullet holes, John’s chair,
He could not stop panting. He was surrounded by Sherlock on all sides; his knees on either side of John’s thighs, Sherlock’s arm curled around his head, caging him in.  John had one hand clutching at the leather of his jacket - whether to keep him close or to keep him at bay, John could not say - his hand tense and still. His whole body was trembling with tense stillness.
Sherlock would ask him, always careful, always checking on him. He was frustratingly gentle. Playing as if it were John's first time, and he had to be careful, careful, pushing his fingers inside one by one as John had lain, nervously willing, in the backseat of his car. Edge of danger in the timbre of Sherlock’s voice that made heat sweep over John’s cheeks, down his chest, the pit of his stomach. It was obvious in the flush of his nipples, the twitch and strain of his cock, the throb inside of him.
Now he finally understands, with a bubble of sound caught in his throat, the moonlight on the gleam of scales and wet skin pressed against him. Strong arms with corded muscle slide around him, wrap around him and trap him, sinuous steel, and wet lips press to his ear.
John, for all his supposed idiocy, was fairly certain that you really oughtn’t to shake people with concussions like this.
Sherlock’s tail sparkled in the sun like new coins and glitter, like treasure. When he lifted it up, the fin on the end shone sheer, and it flowed like silk when he swished it about in the water.
With each thrust, Sherlock’s lower abdomen brushed against John’s knuckles. He was so close now, fucking his own fist frantically in time to Sherlock’s cock fucking his hole, twin pleasures vibrating through him. He reached with his other hand down to where Sherlock had stretched him open and was moving in and out. He could feel everything there: the touch of his own fingers against his stretched-open rim, the solidity of Sherlock’s cock moving inside him. The sense of connection ripped through him, and, seizing up with pleasure he came with a shout, ribbons of come painting both their stomachs, his body rippling around Sherlock to shoot cascades of pleasure through him.
“Well, you boys let me know if you need anything,” says Mrs. Watson. She looks at Sherlock for another moment before letting her heavy gaze drop. Down his body, then to her own hands, down to her dress, down to the floor.
“Oh, Harry, there you are!” a pretty Indian girl said as she stuck her head out of a compartment. “Come on, we’ve saved a spot for you!”
John took his potion without fuss, although he made a face because it tasted like it looked: all mashed up leaves and bitter, salty slugs. Or, at least, what he imagined slugs to taste like.
He’d nearly exploded with joy when he saw the great-horned owl; two days after he turned eleven. It was both a surprise and a rather fortunate thing that he hadn’t; it was difficult to attend school to learn magic when one was a messy pile of once-John smithereens.
The bowl of the spoon dripped with a thick coating of honey; John’s tongue twirled through it -  pink, wet, and mobile.  He sucked and lapped carelessly, unaware of the performance he was putting on, or that he could probably get away with charging a viewing fee.
“Well, he must have gotten out somehow!” Hazel hissed. “If I didn’t forget to lock it, and you didn’t forget to lock it, and John can’t reach the locks, then
His father, and his endless wanderlust, his distant eyes always looking beyond the horizon, at something John could not see.
It was driving Hazel a little batty, to be quite honest, but she supposed that these things were par the course if one lived with two children, and a cat and a dog, in a quaint little house by the sea.
John thought of the dog that he’d seen, flayed open and bloodless. He thought of the boy that had disappeared, and how the adults, the authorities, had just...stopped looking. It had only been a month. As if they all knew they wouldn’t be able to find anything. If they held a funeral for him, they would have to bury an empty casket, but they didn’t know if he was
John had spent his whole life up until that moment like a match unaware of its own purpose. Now he was lit, and the knowledge would consume him.
The wind was the unexpected factor, carrying the fire, roaring down the canyon where the men had sat down to eat their dinner; all of them unaware and placid until it was far too late.
“Well, you get the picture,” Bill finished quickly. “And again I don’t have to like it, but it would make me feel much better if you would wear this.”
Was it that obvious? John flushed, embarrassed by both Sherlock’s upfrontness and his own inexperience. Up until last night, the thought of even kissing a boy was beyond his imagination. And now they were in bed, with Sherlock on top of him, pressing into him, and a great blank space in John’s knowledge as to what could possibly come next.
John, surprised, remembering an old argument about the Earth and whether it revolved around the sun or vice versa - “I thought you didn’t care about -”
“It’s plastic bubble paper,” said John. “Don’t ask me what plastic is, I don’t know, only that it makes up loads of stuff, like trays and furniture and toothbrushes and probably even some people. But the bubble wrap is like this stuff you wrap stuff in so it doesn’t get damaged when you send it in the post. Because we don’t use owls. Or Muggles don’t use owls.”
"Where?" Sherlock prompts, lightly tapping the tip of one erect nipple with his fingers. "Right here?"
“Well, because Batman’s not real,” John explained. “And I know Batman’s not real. But Mum said you aren’t allowed to believe in one thing without the other. You can’t believe in evil things without believing in good things, too. There...there has to be a balance. So if I’m going to believe in imaginary monsters than I can believe that Batman is out there and he can fight monsters and save people, and save me when I need him. ”
John and Sherlock did not speak on the cab ride back to Baker Street. The space between them vibrated with silence. Sherlock placed his hand down on the seat in the space between them, John’s hand resting next to his. Their pinkie fingers brushed against one another, right hand against left, and then their hands stilled. Neither of them were shaking, visibly.
She looked at the door and then back at him, dropped her eyes and asked, wouldn’t he maybe like to come in for a while?
“So maybe you third years could use a prac-tical demon-stration from this little firstie,” John said, enunciating his words carefully, so as not to lose their impact.
John began to talk, describing the plot of a story, something about a crime lord with a disfigurement who became a maniacal jester. He was already yawning by the point in the story where the man fell into a ‘chemical’ vat, which Sherlock gathered was something like a botched potion.
“Oh,” said John, when Sherlock determined that he could safely remove his hand. “I’m still here?” John asked.  Which was, of course, a stupid question, but was a better question than “why am I here?” which would indicate some sort of traumatic memory loss.
"We only have dried dittany," Madam Pomfrey said tightly, but she got out the bottle regardless. "As it is dried, it is not as effective as the fresh herb, which is nowhere as good as an extract or a Potion."
John could barely even meet his eyes. When he looked, a moment later, he saw that the clerk’s eyes and hair were the same medium sort of brown.
“You don’t really need to do anything,” said Sherlock. “I’ve got it all handled. You can just sit there and take notes.”
“Do you like that, John?” he breathed into John’s ear. John shook his head, but squirmed more with another tugging pinch and a taunting squeeze to his cock. “You do, don’t you?” He did; Sherlock could feel it in the anticipatory tension of his body. He moved over to give the other side the same thorough treatment, and admired the way John quivered, suspended between the quick shifts of pleasure and pain sparking through the sensitive erogenous zone of his nipples.
"Sherlock," John slurred, slinging an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders. "You’re alive! Drink with me."
gastropodic and slimy. Sherlock was not sure if two eyestalks and some sort of indiscernible mouth-opening met the requisite qualifications of “cute little face” and he knew for sure that slugs did not possess the emotional capacity to be adoring.
On nights when the moon is full and bright as polished bone, and the sea pulls away from the earth in rising tides, there is a song that spirals deep in the whorls of John’s mind.
" She trails the tip of one sharp fingernail down Sherlock's neck, and this time, Sherlock does pull away. "I'll be cutting out now," she says, and presses a kiss to Sherlock's cheek, leaving an imprint of crimson. John makes a sound that Sherlock hasn't heard before, choked back in his throat. "Ta, darling."
, as promised, and then made Sherlock hold out his hand so she could sprinkle out the allotted amount of dried dittany onto it.
Sherlock knew who it was without even looking, so he took a moment to let John fidget. It was brave of him, to come over to the Slytherin side of the room, with everybody watching and judging.
He imagined himself kissing girls, touching them, making them coo and sigh against him. He had always thought of himself romancing a girl, sweeping her off her feet like a regular Prince Charming. He can’t remember a time where he hasn’t liked girls. That’s normal. That’s good and right.
“Don’t worry too much about people who don’t know anything,” said Greg, as he started to get up. “Focus on doing good things. Like getting better at Quidditch.”
“My apologies, John.” Sherlock leaned down over him to press a kiss to a strip of John’s exposed stomach, so the words rumbled against John’s skin. He didn’t sound apologetic. He mostly sounded smug. Another finger wormed its way inside him and pressed right into his prostate. “I’ve never heard you beg like this before.”
John puts the tiny Pony Express rider on the dashboard, next to his growing collection of souvenirs. Sherlock glares at it as if this is a personal affront, as if the tiny horse might make tiny droppings in his precious car. John surreptitiously moves it behind his miniature catsup bottle (from their visit to The World’s Largest Catsup Bottle; Collinsville, Illinois).
The doors to the houses opened and whoever was home stepped out; mostly the ever-vigilant mothers in their smocks and their frocks, their housedresses speckled with daisies.
“Yes, I suppose we are,” the Head Boy said with a little smile, teeth glinting and badge glinting. “Welcome to Hogwarts, Mr. Watson. I hope you do not regret the side you have chosen.”
In the movie, someone was being stalked. They didn’t know they were being stalked, but the audience knew, from the predatory eye of the camera and the rising intensity of the violins.
“Take it off,” Sherlock suggested, so low and quiet that it was almost hypnotic. John’s hands moved without thinking; didn’t want to think too much about what he was doing, until he was naked except for his socks. He felt shaky on his own feet.
Potions class was shared with Gryffindors, and Sherlock had very mixed feelings about this, because he loved Potions and he did not, so much, like Gryffindors.
His method of asking, however, still lacked a certain...consensuality: John was leaning in, halfway to a kiss with his eyes drifting closed and mouth already parting, when Sherlock abruptly plastered a hand over his mouth.
he’s good. They’ve all kept on the good side for years. But even if they weren’t, even if they didn’t, do you reckon we’d know about it? They have all this money and all these smarts, they could cover up
John cleared his throat politely, but the boy gave no response. He really was sleeping, then, and not just resting his eyes. John wondered whether it was nicer to ask him if he could join him, or to let him sleep in peace. Considering that this was probably the last somewhat empty compartment in the train and he didn’t quite fancy spending the journey sitting in the hall or a closet or toilet somewhere, he decided upon the latter.
John ran his hands up Sherlock’s tail and stopped where his tummy was, where the scales scattered, fading into skin. He looked up to Sherlock for permission. Sherlock nodded.
John paused, aborting the assault he’d been about to launch over the back of the chair. “You watch me sleep?”
He was a criminal; they were certainly criminals both. The things they did that night were illegal in Oklahoma and Kansas and 47 other states besides. They committed unspeakable acts together, made crime scenes of each other. A whole world passed by outside of their locked door, ordinary and unknowing.
The trees formed a black latticework against the blood red sky. And then the red calmed into a rosy pink, which gave way to a deep blue. The trees grew darker, and the orange light subsided into cool blue tones.
John right underneath him, clinging; this is the exact way he will look when he finally fucks him. The way his whole body shifts on the bed, the sound of the bed creaking quietly beneath them. John, his body trembling, his mouth hanging open, panting hot, humid breaths between them. His mouth. The inside of it red and wet, scrap of tongue peeking just slightly out. How it would feel, sweet lips wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s cock with his tongue pressing just right, rubbing against the glans and John hasn’t even learned any of this yet.
“We do not use those words, Bill,” said Mike, who was wise in the methods of intervention. “Say sorry. And John, put your nice S.W.A.G. on, and say thank you.”
They drove around London, taking the long way back to Baker Street to rack up the meter. Sherlock did not call attention to it.
And when he finished, John said, “That was brilliant,” with applause in his voice, and Sherlock said, “Of course,” with perfect nonchalance, and turned away. It wasn’t until he set the violin down that he realised that he was smiling.
, flashing red, this man might be looking to hurt him, looking for a fight and not a f-- the other thing, the word that still makes John feel hot and flush a little, even inside the privacy of his own mind.
John turned to see an older Ravenclaw girl, with light brown skin and thick, curly black hair. “Yeah?” he said, tentatively. He then regretted revealing his true identity right away. While she didn’t look the type to start hurling insults or to push him around, it would have been far smarter to say he was...Wilson, or something, until he was certain that she was not a threat.
Every Sunday, the talk of hellfire and to beware the Devil; terrors that seemed so real when he was sat in the hardness of the wooden pew, but ridiculous now as Sherlock scoffed.
John did not look up from his plate; he was very busy poking his beans around with his fork to form a crooked smiley face. “No, Mummy,” he said.
“Here, let me see that,” Sherlock said, and put his hands on the wriggling plant to restrain it. “Now squeeze it and catch it in the bottle,” he instructed John. “Pinch it with your thumb and index finger on both sides until it bursts.”
. More of Sherlock’s cock, more of his force pinning John down to the sofa, more of whatever Sherlock wanted to give him.
by wandlight. Every now and again he looked up to watch John shift around in his sleep, which he seemed to do 2.5 times per hour. John was currently curled up into a tight ball on one side of the bed, the majority of his blanket gathered up in his arms and the sheet half off his bed.
An experiment.  Sherlock drew in a long, slow breath through his nose.  Shouting at John for his stupidity would be counter-productive just now.  Instead, he carefully placed his mobile on the table, leaned forward as far into John’s space as he could get from where he was standing, and captured John’s eyes.
A tiny little feeling of smugness squirmed up into John’s chest. It was the smallest consolation, really, considering that he had lost so many points and now had to serve Detention, on top of the shame of having Professor Hudson so disappointed in him, but, oh gosh,
Caught off-guard again, John tipped forward over Sherlock, catching himself on one hand with the front of his jeans firmly in touch with the groin of Sherlock’s expensive trousers. He glanced down to where they came together.
“Oh!” John said, dropped his pail and went down to his knees in the water, so that he could put both small hands on Sherlock’s tail. “It’s so smooth,” he said, because it was, it was so nice to touch, all slippery and smooth. Like nothing John had ever touched before. The slide of it underneath his little fingers was fascinating.
“Yeah, can I?” asked John, curious to see what Magical stitches would be like. Maybe they would sew themselves, or dissolve into his skin, or maybe they were made of dragon guts or something.
“No, no, Bill, I’m sorry,” said John quickly, dutifully abashed. “I didn’t mean it. It’s a beautiful S.W.A.G.”
John hopped off the bench. He strode over to Sherlock, stopping just before him. His hands went to his own shirt; his fingers were trembling and his fingers lingered over the next button, but he kept his shoulders square.
He traces the shape of one with his tongue, tasting cleanness and the light sweat of excitement.  One hand finds a pink nipple and gently circles, touches and presses until it's hard as a button. John moans softly and he looks at Sherlock with surprise that anybody can make him feel that way. Sherlock thinks about  anybody else making John feel this way and sucks hard at the other nipple until John is pushing at his shoulders, whimpering.
He spun her and dipped her. She gasped when he leaned in for the kiss, her cheeks flushing a pretty pink that brightened the rouge on her cheeks. He held it for just a second, kept it dry and chaste.
There was a blunt pressure - there - where he was held open. Small feeble whine with the feeling; thickness behind him. And big, bigger than he’d thought, it felt too big, impossible to fit, but Sherlock was unrelenting, insistent. Suddenly there was a give, and his mouth split open with a keening noise, as his body yielded, split - he was being split open, like ripe fruit. Juice dribbling. Spit in his mouth. Tears in his eyes.
“Real is such a subjective term,” said Sherlock. “What is real? Reality can be a matter of perception. I think, therefore I am. Am I here, right now, with you? I think I am, and you think I am, so that much must be true. Unless of course, you don’t believe. Don’t you believe in me, John?”
"What do beans have to do with anything?" John needed to know. "And why does the number of them matter?"
The earth is soft and springy underneath John’s feet; the smell in the air of hot green things growing.
And then there was a very logical, very plausible, very awful reason: John had changed his mind about Sherlock, and would rather skip class altogether than have to break the news to him. John had experienced firsthand what it meant to be associated with Sherlock Holmes: ostracisation from one’s own Housemates and mockery from the rest of the school. Within 24 hours his previously comfortable social status had plummeted to the level of unhousebroken house elf. The choice was obvious; one would have to be extraordinarily stupid to not cut off all ties after
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Firstly, what’s the point of us giving it a respectable name if you’re only going to butcher it, and secondly, that is
It’s just friction, layers of denim between them and not enough contact, but Sherlock’s 18 and any friction is good, hell, any kind of touch is good. Through the denim he can feel the shape of John’s cock hard against his, the heat of it, the heat of the thought: John is all hard like this because of him. John’s tight little body underneath his, rocking up to meet his, eager for the press of his cock thrusting against him. John’s mouth forming the shape of his name, panting softly
“Remember,” Sherlock murmured, mouth suddenly close to John’s ear, “I’m a scientist. I know the human body, each muscle, tendon, ligament, and blood vessel. I know pressure points and erogenous zones. I know where to touch you where you’ll feel it in your dick. I know what the twitch of a muscle means, the increase in your pulse. I can feel it when I wrap my hand around your cock. I don’t have to hear you beg in my ear to know when you’re about to come. I’ll know when your balls tighten and rise, when your breathing stops, when your body arches up to push your dick into my hand.”
“Did I win?” John asked, panting, as he laid out on the cold flagstone floor. “I think I won.” Everything hurt and one eye was already swelling closed. He could feel something warm trickling down his cheek. “Did you hear that? He
“A new blog.” John sat back with undoubtedly premature satisfaction to regard his screen. “The other one is so…” His face twisted up. “Commercial these days. I'm trying to think of a name, though." He leaned forward and typed something.
John frantically shook his head no, too afraid to actually form words. His face burned, inflamed with shame; Professor Hudson was so
Pressed so tight to Sherlock that it made his sternum ache, sucking in little gasps of air when a shift of the head or brief parting of lips created space for it, John realised dimly that no one had ever kissed him like this, never clutched him so tight that he could feel the blood throb in their veins like their pulses had merged. He tugged at his wrists, still pinned to the wall as if Sherlock was afraid he might lose his mind and decide to leave. “Mmph,
,” he said again, as if trying out how to say the name right, like John did, when trying out a new word that he’d just learnt. Sherlock smiled to himself, then, the kind of smile you got when you’d just had a sweet and it tasted particularly nice.
They’re meant to be tidying up, John knows, but all that seems to be happening is making more mess. Or rather, moving mess around, as he opens folders and shows Victor their crime scene photos and newspaper articles: “Junior Minister Suicide After Drink Binge;” “Journalist Slain in Impossible Murder” - acting as tour guide through his life with Sherlock.
“John’s okay, Bill,” Mike sighed. “And besides, if he were under a really good evil spell you probably wouldn’t know until he tried to kill you, but I don’t think Holmes is powerful enough for that kind of magic ‘cause he’s only just a firstie like us.”
“I like tea,” Victor says. “I drink a lot of it. One could even call me a tea expert.” His expression is sheepish. “Of course, my expertise does not include the making of, as I have never had to do that myself.”
Not Sherlock, of course. Sherlock probably couldn’t look abashed even if he were caught naked in Buckingham Palace.
“I’ve just...it’s not safe, all right?” He didn’t want to pick up the paper the next morning and find Sherlock’s picture in it.
Sherlock swore, mostly cursing himself. He had miscalculated the angle when he had aimed, he had not quite accounted for the kickback of the gun in his hand, and although this wound was most likely fatal, it was not the easy kill-shot he had been hoping for. He had never been the excellent marksman that John was.
“I’m fine, Sherlock, really, it’s okay!” John said, smiling to show that he wasn’t trying to be brave. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed suspiciously as if John were trying to get away with a terrible lie, but then he nodded and released him.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she says, shaking her head. There’s a pity in her voice that makes Sherlock grit his teeth, just slightly. She slides an arm around his shoulders and gives him a squeeze. Sherlock tenses.
For a man hunched over a frozen corpse, John looked fantastic. Sherlock hadn’t realised anybody could look good in forensic photography, but the light caught John just right: brought out that lovely hidden curve of his cheekbone, turned his eyelashes to sunlight and his eyes to the murky shade of a winter lake. His blazer stretched appealingly tight across his shoulders, and what his position did for the jeans wrapped around his arse couldn’t be denied.
“But can you imagine! Just for breaking curfew! The sun was still up when he left my house, I swear.”
Nape, nipples, and belly button, inner thigh, from the curve of his ankle to that shallow puddle at the base of his spine, Sherlock chased golden trails of honey across John’s golden body for the rest of the morning, till he had him moaning and sticky-sweet all over.
"Hey stud," Irene says; she catches Sherlock by the football field after school. She comes up to him, popping her gum and swaying her hips with sinuous grace. Her nails and lips are bright red, her jacket bright pink; she wears Chanel no. 5. "You haven't come around in a while. Where've you been? Do you have a new squeeze you haven't told me about?"
John through the thin fabric of his T-shirt, and Sherlock’s tongue slipping into his mouth and all those damn butterflies burst through their chrysalises and just had themselves a
Her touch was too tender; a mother’s ignorant love. There was so much that she didn’t know. He wanted to cry. He wanted to roll over and be sick.
“That’s mighty big talk coming from someone who…yes, hm, who still wets the bed,” Sherlock replied. He looked him up and down, scrutinising. He was doing what John was starting to think of as the Sherlock Scan, wherein he tallied up one’s attributes, personal history, and calculated their stats in the matter of minutes.
Sherlock slapped John's arse just to hear the sound of the sharp smack of his palm meeting flesh and John whimpered in the back of his throat, sucking at Sherlock's tongue. His fingers tightened, tangled in Sherlock's curls and tugging in his need, which made Sherlock grip his arse in both hands and squeeze.
John squints and his vision blurs, Sherlock’s image going soft like a smudge in a photograph. Maybe a day will come when the photographs he’s taken are all he’ll have left of Sherlock. It is a 4 am thought that he cannot shake.
,” he managed. After a moment, Sherlock let him loose to lock his fingers into those taunting curls.
Sherlock wants to delete the word no from John's vocabulary, and the word don't, and especially the word stop. He would replace them with new words, finer words, words like please, like Sherlock, and
She wasn’t wrong. They could look high and low, but his heart was nowhere near to be found. Where was it, neither of them wanted to ask. Like a fool he’d lost it. John was afraid that it was in someone else’s pocket, being worried over with strong, slender fingers - the touch familiar, deft yet unsure.
“Still,” said Bill. “Not to worry, John. The whole House doesn’t hate you. Just a large majority of it.”
“You  look fantastic! ” Sherlock snapped, nettled.  “What you are is an idiot if you don’t think so. Do you think I would waste days of my time chasing you around with a camera so I could take
Military instincts kept him in a balanced stance while he retrieved the sugar from the cabinet. He was calm. Casual. Nevermind his frequent darting glances back into the living room. If he could just reach the sofa before he was intercepted, he would be safe. He’d keep his back to the wall, with a clear line of sight to the doors. He couldn’t be caught unawares there. He spilled a line of steaming tea onto his fingers and cursed, switching hands to suck at the burned spot. A sharp, speculative gaze lingered on him. He could feel it just out of sight, observing his every intently nonchalant movement.
Caught with his pants down and his arse out, too tangled up to save himself, on the living room sofa in full view of God and Sherlock and...well, nobody else really, but it was the principle of the thing. It should’ve been humiliating, and his cheeks burned with the knowledge of it, but the butterflies in his stomach were fluttering a path right down to his cock.
, right in the center of his body, rubbing against him just slightly whenever Sherlock moved, that electric jolt of pleasure that sang through his body like a note through a string, thought of kissing Sherlock, rubbed his thumb over the sensitive head of his own cock and felt the wetness of his own excitement, thought of kissing James Dean, shivered hard, stroked himself with a fresh spurt of his own wetness, and tumbled over the edge, belly swooping, and in that moment he was flying,  in sharp, hot pulses of white all over his own hand, getting a little on his stomach.
"I thought you'd never ask," John says with a smile instead, and that’s when Sherlock sees that when Clara laughs she leans into Harriet, and their hands and skirts gently brush together.
Sherlock spent a good 20 minutes or so just looking at John, this image of him caught unawares at the edge of a crime scene photo. The glossy plastic was smooth underneath his fingertips. Sherlock realised, then, that he had never seen a photo of John that wasn’t taken when he was deliberately sitting for a portrait.
“Sherlock!” John spluttered. He straightened up. “You can get yourself up.” With a noise of disgust, he turned and walked away, abandoning Sherlock, left all by himself on the floor.
Sherlock had claimed him for his. He didn’t need to say it. He didn’t need to tug John close and  whisper in his ear who he belonged to, although he did it anyway, to feel the shivers wrack through John’s compact little body. But this John already knew. John was his, every inch of him - his desperation, his need, the bead of sweat slowly trickling down his chest, the swallow of his throat, the frenetic beat of his heart.
Sherlock’s grip tightened around him. “I’m honored,” he said, voice deep and silken. John searched his face for derision and found none, only the molten intensity of his gaze. The distracting feather-light touch of Sherlock’s fingers tracing, over the small of his back, the vertebrae of his lower spine, gently petting wherever he could reach. As if he could not stop touching, even now. John’s skin tingled all over with the stimulation, that insect buzz. His breath hitched.
And John, he’s never felt so stupid, knees and elbows bruised up from practice, hair wet and flat against his head from his shower, shirt sticking uncomfortably to his skin because he didn’t have the patience to wait to dry properly. He’s parceled out to awkward pieces under that look, indexed down to his smudged glasses and the spot he forgot to wash behind his ear.
by Sherlock, and perhaps Sherlock was a little more vulnerable to flattery than he would care to admit.
“John!” Hazel cried in relief, splashing over to him. He had emerged from the depths, sleek as a baby seal, dripping wet with seawater.
"Shh, don't carry on so," Sherlock shushes him, but is surprised when one of John's hands scrabbles for his. The way their fingers entwine, the way that John's small hand clutches at his, is nearly as fascinating as his fingers inside of John. He's never actually held John's hand before; John's palm against his, heated and damp with sweat, his fingers gripping tight, squeezing their knuckles together. He surrenders his hand over, their two hands clasped together, resting on the quivering flesh of John's stomach.
“That tickles,” Sherlock said warmly. He turned and slapped his tail into the water, splashing John playfully with a small wave of water.
“But what if...what if I had stayed? What if I had been there? Would it have turned out any different? I could have--”
“Right,” John said. “You’re always cool.” He paused. “Jeanette says her parents are out of town this weekend.”
The way Sherlock took up space reminded John, again, of a storybook panther, prowling in the night, black and languid as ink. Fear and excitement fluttered inside of him. He had to make a move - Sherlock stood tall before him, waiting, watching with his panther-eyes. Again, that feeling of inexplicable dread, a voice inside that said
Now John was starting to worry. What if Sherlock wasn’t going to school this morning? What if he was sick? Or worse, what if something had happened to him?
“I know.” At John’s questioning glance, Victor continues, “You haven’t been back here in nearly two months. In the time that I’ve known you, I’m guessing you have - 6...7 shirts on rotation? Either you really love those shirts, or you only packed an overnight bag. And you’re staying with your sister despite the fact that you two fight like cats and dogs.”
At the end of the day Sherlock tells John to go find a bar, and he’ll meet them him there by and by. John goes wandering, taking his time, finds a place calling itself The Buccaneer.  It’s small and none too fancy, dark inside the way all bars are, whether it be high noon or midnight. He’s not yet old enough to drink but he stands up tall and strides in like he belongs there.
John shook his head, body shaking as well - the first move voluntary and the second uncontrollable.  His eyes were dark and shining with sheer excitement. Sherlock gave his cock another squeeze, much gentler this time, to feel him twitch and pulse in his hand. John winced as if it hurt; Sherlock knew that it only felt too good, obvious from the precum that trickled down his shaft.
“Anderson, isn’t it?” Sherlock continued. “I know your type. Secondhand books, hand-me-down robes. Your parents have way more children than they can possibly afford, all of you with the same rat-like faces. You have separation anxiety issues and a blatant case of Middle Child Syndrome.”
It’s surrounded by a handful of people who have come around to whistle at it, saying “Wowee,” and clucking their tongues, turning to each other and saying, “Now ain’t that somethin’?”
“Is that what you wanted to discuss? Cats?” Sherlock would tease. “Now why would you want to talk about cats when there are so many more subjects of interest in this world?”
Sherlock’s kisses are wet and hot, a heat that John thinks would consume him if he let it. It’s starting already, the feeling warm and low in his belly like coals glowing bright with breath. Girls don’t kiss like this, John’s sure. At least none that he’s ever known. Not like this, with Sherlock’s hands in his hair and his lean body heavy on top of him, flat chest against his own and a growing erection heating his thigh.
“Well, your arch-enemy, according to him,” John clarified. “Sometimes. Do people have arch-enemies? And is that a real part-time job?”
it’s all got to be true. When they say human experiments, they mean it, like he cut people up and stuff and sewed them together…to
John let out an involuntary giggle, squeezed out from the tension in his chest. It sounded far too bright and wrong to his ears, but he couldn’t recapture it once it had wormed its way out.
You’re very lucky I found them before they started to smell and alerted the rest of your Housemates to their decaying presence.”
John sucks a bruising kiss on Sherlock’s throat, above the collar line; a visible mark in the shape of his mouth.
But when John smiles at him and says something like “You’re kookie,” because that’s the little bit of lingo that he’s hep to and so he says it a lot, Sherlock doesn’t know how to stop the endless meiosis, and all he wants to do is smear him with his DNA.
A rush of terror, stifled scream in his throat, and he was twitching, another pulse of thin fluid wrung out of him. Then Sherlock’s voice was in his ear, shushing him, “Shh, shh,
“Thank God,” John agreed, finally peering over at his rescuer. Sherlock smiled at him, then, which made John’s spine tingle in a not-unpleasant way.
“Well, aren’t you just a clumsy Clyde,” she said, and placed a pink lipstick print directly over the purpling mark.
“I bet he was a great detective,” Victor says. He has found the deerstalker and he is examining it, turning it front and back.
Sherlock’s hands wandered, tugging the belt open, popping open the button on John’s trousers, and then unzipping the fly. He slipped his hand inside to palm John’s cock, warm and half-hard already with sheer anticipation.
“John?” Hazel said, not liking the way her voice instinctively rose. The fear, once forgotten, slid sly fingers around her throat and squeezed.
He was ensnared by Sherlock all around him, cradled in the cage of his arms. He was still hard in spite of the burst. He was being fucked into still, his own white release smeared onto his stomach, rubbed into his skin by the motion. Sherlock felt so big around him, his limbs everywhere, his hands everywhere, so full inside of John that it stretched and ached all over again, like he’d increased in size. Pinpricks of pain on John’s thighs, his hips, his chest and his vulnerable throat, hot needles of sensation. John felt so small and strangely fragile, suddenly aware of the fact that he was made only of soft flesh and white bone and thin skin and a network of veins. Sherlock could rip him apart.
They laughed together, and then kissed, John’s hands on his shoulders clutching just a little too hard, still needing to feel the solidity of one another.
was sitting patiently across from him, observing and getting his fill of John’s concentrated face, heartlessly ignored. The situation was a simple enough fix. Sherlock rose from his seat to stride across the room, leaning in to press a tender kiss to John’s forehead. It was the sort of romantic gesture that usually earned him the adulation that he deserved. He hovered, waiting for John to look up at him with adoration shining in those dark blue eyes.
“Hey,” he said, with an easy smile, and leaned out the window. “You really shouldn’t be out past curfew.” His eyes were pale, the color of the aquamarine stone set in Momma’s favorite ring. They looked luminous in the streetlight.
“It feels good, doesn’t it?” Sherlock asked. His deep voice surrounding them both, his mouth, close enough to - “Being so afraid, sometimes. The adrenaline in your veins. It excites you, stimulates you.” And he was pressed right against John, weight of his body fully upon him, John trapped between Sherlock and the car door.
A few years back, Tulsa, Oklahoma was dubbed America’s Most Beautiful City by Time magazine. A city with wide, clean streets...towering buildings that gleam in the clear, fresh air of a smokeless industrial center . . . mile upon mile of residential areas as beautiful as a quarter million prideful residents can make them . . . one of the nation's finest vacationlands right next door . . . and general --
“Exactly,” Bill nodded, as if that explained everything. “You’ll be fine!” He dropped his voice to a whisper. “Deny everything! You’re an innocent man!” He punctuated his words with a very obvious wink.
The snap of the shutter gave him away, of course.  When he looked back up from his phone, John was glaring at him, a self-conscious blush spread charmingly across his cheeks.  Sherlock stared him down.  “You can
“Shh!” John shushed him, quite rudely. He was typing mostly gibberish, as far as Sherlock could see.
There was nothing to do but to stand out in the hallway and wait, and listen to his sister in the shower, completely unaware of what kind of brother she had, and listen to his mother downstairs, completely unaware of what kind of son she had, and with every passing second he could feel the body-temperature wetness soaking into his underwear.
His current abhorrence for Gryffindors was borne of their detestable attitude and resulting behaviours to his person. The way they whispered about him so obviously when he swept past, and the way the more idiotic ones - like that third-year, Powers - saw fit to knock over his books or hiss “freak” at him in the halls.  He also despised their tendency to band together and laugh and to steal away potentially interesting people who might have been friends once if not for the pathetic House bigotry.
“John!” Sherlock said, scandalised. “Leave that alone. Firstly, that’s evidence. Secondly, that’s what
John wanted to be spread open, pushed down, he wanted sex just like this, hot shame and excitement mixed together in the pit of his stomach until it was like a dagger of desire straight through his gut.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up with that rare, beautiful look of wonder that John got to see when he’d done something truly unexpected. He glanced with an uncertain frown between John’s face, probably red with more need than he’d ever felt in his life, to his hole, gripping hungrily at the two fingers that were managing to only tease him with the promise of being filled. He was this close to begging for Sherlock’s cock like one of those porn videos he’d watched in uni between girlfriends.
At first he’d been elated. He may have whooped. He might have hollered. He would, under extreme pressure, perhaps admit that there may have possibly been something akin to dancing involved.
“I didn’t make it up, I saw it, it was flying right behind us.” John pointed. “Oh, look, there it is again!”
John allowed himself to be led easily enough, no real resistance to his soft little limbs. His small fingers were cold in her hand. “What a mess, John,” she chided, her voice overly loud and falsely cheerful.
"Do you like it?" Sherlock asks, the answer so obvious, easily deducible in John's shallow little panting breaths, the twitch of his hips and Sherlock rubs his fingers inside of him, the leaking erection against his belly.
The ground was cool against his back, soft spiky grass underneath his hands. He could smell the richness of the earth and the green juice of the crushed blades of grass. The world had stopped spinning. Sunlight was warm upon his legs, but the rest of his body lay in the shade. Blessed, gentle darkness. A breeze ghosted over him, and off in the distance, birds were singing. Inside the building, the choir was singing.
“Yes,” John said, and slowly approached him. “Do you have something to say to me?” It was no use denying who he was, really, and it seemed like
“I know it’s not possible! Do you think I don’t know that? But then there’s the sleep-walking, and that...that
He’d followed Sherlock into an empty classroom that afternoon, sat down on a desk and let Sherlock kiss him breathless. They’d propped a chair against the door to prevent anyone from coming in unannounced, although by that hour the only person left at school was probably the janitor, maybe the principal.
He shoves at Victor. “Oi, get up, you’re heavier than you look.” His mouth tastes like the floor of a public toilet in a bordello.
Had the walls always been so tight and close? There seemed to be no space in between the stone and the rows of wooden pews. Had the windows always been so large? The hard, unforgiving wood of the pew pressed back on his thighs.
He pulled back, both from surprise and the need to attempt to get a hold of himself. “You’re so cold,” he breathed.
“Hey Sherlock, let’s play Gwydion and Arawn,” Carl was saying, giving Sherlock a little kick. Judging by Sherlock’s ruffled hair and robes, he’d been pushed down to the ground and roughed up.
A thorough check in the mirror in the third floor toilets revealed absolutely nothing, except for two older boys, a Ravenclaw and a Slytherin, who abruptly stopped talking when he entered. They then made rude gestures and faces behind him while John stood at the mirrors, as well as strange attempts to measure his height. The whole encounter left John frankly confused and slightly terrified.
"What did you go and do that for?” John said, barely able to comprehend the carnage that lay around him now: glass and squirming slugs
“I can still be educated. There was nothing wrong with my education up until this point. We’ll call the tutors back and you can teach me when you come home from school, just like always. We can get Mrs Moira to come back. I liked her.”
“Where do you live?” John asked quietly. “Where’s your family from? I’ve never seen you around before…”
“Sometimes,” the Head Boy admitted, which only further confused matters for John. Being a part-time enemy probably wasn’t very lucrative. “In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, depending upon his mood, he might even say archenemy. He does love to be dramatic.”
John was 11 years old when he first laid eyes on James Dean. He loved going to the movie theater even if he couldn't afford the pictures; didn't get much pocket change because Momma always said they just didn't have the money to spare, not with the car acting up in the winter and the heating bill so high, and how he and Harry kept growing and needing clothes all the time and don’t forget new shoes besides.  Dad was always yelling about the
John didn’t see anything in the bedroom other than the dark curtain of Jeanette’s hair falling around him as she pushed him onto the bed. The sheets were alarmingly, surprisingly pink. He saw the grey of her eyes and the sweeping shadow of her lashes and then he closed his eyes as well.  He felt her body surge against him and his own surged in response. It was happening. His first time with a girl. It was really happening.
Sherlock realised, with a dizzying surge of lust, that John was coming again, a smaller orgasm tripping on the heels of the first, at the sensation of being filled with Sherlock’s cum.
Once inside 221B Sherlock could not resist a kiss, this one harsher, tenderness sizzling in the surge of need. He pulled John to him and he held him tucked just right against his own body, and felt the air in his own lungs and the blood in his own heart. He was aware of being alive. He was aware, even more, of John being alive. He wanted his tongue in John’s mouth and pressed for it, their mouths melded together and then pulling back so that he could lick at John’s lips. John wanted it too and opened for him with a soft moan, the sort of sound that travelled directly to a man’s cock.
In London, Sherlock says, in the morning the sun glints off the river like it's tipped with crystal.
“My apologies,” Sherlock said, and climbed up on the bed. The mattress dipped underneath his weight as he straddled John’s torso. “It
“The beat, the beat, it makes their bodies feel so hot, and they begin thinking things, these immoral things, they get these ideas in their head, hellfire in the core of their bodies-”
“Hey, John,” Harry said, sitting down and nicking an eclair off his plate. John looked around to see if anybody was watching; Harry had expressly told him that he was “undercover,” after all, and surely he was meant to be even
“An enemy?” John whispered. He had never met anybody’s enemy before, and thusly had no experience with them, although this Head Boy did look like he could easily have played a Bond villain, with his haughty features and the cold look in his grey-blue eyes. Although he was far too young Bond villain, to be sure. It would have to be one of those prequel type movies where James Bond was still in school, training to be a spy, and the Head Boy would be going to Villain Academy.
They’d awakened on the sofa a few mornings later, having fallen asleep arguing over the relative merits of an Edgar Wright movie marathon, and exactly how ill-advised it would be to start one at 11 pm. Morning found them with John’s nose squashed against Sherlock’s pulse, Sherlock’s cheek resting against ruffled blond hair, shielding John from the worst of the bright early light that had dared to wake them.
His first instinct was to run. But there was no way to outrun a car, that was silly. Not even if he dropped his bag and abandoned his bike.  And where would he go? Into the woods, that dark unknown? Or to a stranger’s house, banging on the door - a stranger himself? Why, they’d call the police! Even if they didn’t, they would not let him in, that was against the rules.
“No,” says Victor, “I mean, literally. He told me his name was Hunter Van Savage.” He blows on his cappucino to cool it. “So it’s our first year of uni, and I’m at this big party and this bloke comes up to me in this leather jacket with these Ray-ban sunglasses and stone-washed jeans that were so tight I thought he was going to sound like a soprano.”
Oh, yeah. John shivered. The wet touch of Sherlock’s tongue over his body was now graven into his muscle memory. God, the blissed-out look on Sherlock’s face as he had licked honey off John’s trembling stomach. He’d deliberately made his noises as obscene as possible, slurping and sucking and groaning with deep, thoroughly expressed pleasure, and he’d narrated the progress of John’s debauchery as he went, painting a picture with words of how John looked as he got increasingly flushed and damp and lost all physical restraint. Sherlock had reduced John to a writhing mess, just as promised, making high keening noises of such desperation that John couldn’t let himself think about it too much till he was in bed and could have a good wank.
“Oh,” said John, and he immediately released the blankets. “I don’t always sleep with him...I mean, of course I don’t sleep with him, that’s babyish and silly and--”
“Wow,” said John, agreeably. “But I bet Hogwarts has a whole lot less students who go to the Infirmary with vines and leaves and stuff stuck in funny places,” he added, remembering the pictures from Sherlock’s illicit book.
of the students at Hogwarts are Dark Wizards, potential Dark Wizards, Dark Wizard spawn, or anything of the sort. I shall not have you or any other student using such language or making groundless accusations. Nor do we refer to our fellow Housemates as House traitors. Do you understand?”
"She must be something real special," Irene says, leaning in  and inhaling, the tip of her nose brushing against Sherlock's neck. Sherlock holds himself stock-still. "You smell good. Like frustration. She doesn't even put out, does she? Never thought you'd stand for that, babe."
As for Sherlock, he is all gone to ashes, incinerated, with only pieces of bone and teeth recognizable.
If one were to look at him, he would appear to be sleeping. His little body laid out, naked and still, sunken underneath 16 inches of water. His arms floated at his sides, his entire body suspended in the water. The surface of the water was as smooth as glass; the fairytale coffin that held him.
Sherlock had smiled at him then, with his wolf-bright smile. No pretence, no cover up, just open honesty. People often find his honesty frightening.
It was Sherlock who insisted that he date. John hadn’t wanted to, but he didn’t want people to think he was weird or a loser either, like Sherlock said that they would. He was well-liked enough, after all, and he was on the football team - although he thought himself only a passing player. It wasn’t like he was a total nerd. People would think something was wrong with him if he didn’t date.
"Shh," Sherlock soothes, and although there’s a soft whimpering sound, it seems to come from very far away.
“I’m Sally,” she said. She held out her hand and smiled. John was relieved. It was the first time all day that someone had smiled at him, and not out of derision. “Sally Donovan.”
around Sherlock’s dick, warm and fluttering when he convulsed, as if his body were built purely for Sherlock’s pleasure.
) like the broken radiator in church, it was so hot, he was so hot everywhere, when he opened his eyes his vision was blurry, blurring with - sweat? Tears?
Sherlock glared at her, his gaze unwavering. John was starting to see why some students thought he was a frightening person. One day, he might even be terrifying.
“I never would have predicted that for him. He was so brilliant it made my teeth hurt to think about it and he had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. He could have been anything and excelled at it. Actor, scientist, philosopher - you know.”
Said Gryffindor cronies were already seated, arguing over the best way to crush snake fangs. They, too, had an empty seat at their Potions bench, and neither of them seemed concerned that John was missing. Of course, it was also wholly possible that neither of them had even
John held out his hand so that Bill could place a tarnished small gold amulet into it. It was covered with sigils. In the middle of it there was an intricate eye, and embedded inside the pupil there was a deep red stone, that might have possibly been a ruby, although the stone was chipped.
“Oh!” Sherlock said, and did not make fun of John for still having a doll at eleven years old. Instead he turned the puppy over and over in his hands, very carefully, as if he were made of glass instead of soft fibres.
“Are you going to take her to the Fall Ball?” Sherlock asked suddenly one afternoon. He was lounging on John’s bed, carefree and lackadaisical, while John was being tortured by trigonometry.
"Oh," Irene titters. "You are real gone, aren't you? Never thought I'd live to see the day. Who's the lucky lady? Not anyone I know, I would be able to tell by now."
He told him about the size of whales, like giants, and how they sang to one another, the songs travelling great distances in the ocean. He told him about jellyfish, drifting slowly, gracefully through the water - some of them small, little translucent moons they could fit in the palms of their hands (but watch out for the sting, John); some of them metres and metres long, their tentacles streaming like colourful ribbons behind them. He told him how he saw a new kind of jelly every day, and how he catalogued them, and he figured, at this rate, he would have to be fifty before he saw them all.
“Should I be worried that you’ve both thought about this?” John asked. He had not had much time to think about it himself, considering that he’d been recovering from his head injury and all, trivial things like that.
Sherlock pushed away from John’s body to hover over him, up on his arms for better leverage. His hair was a chaotic cloud and his face was flushed pink with the force of his arousal, with a crease of concentration between his brows and that lush lower lip caught intently between his teeth. He was the most glorious, wild thing John had ever seen. The idea that it was all because of
With his tongue darting over the seam of John’s lips, he had tasted him, he had learned him. He had calculated the amount of time he had for maximum enjoyment before John pushed him off, and it had come out to an average of 86 seconds.
He and Sarah did all the things that he always thought he would do with a girl. They went to the movies and they went to the malt shoppe. At school he carried her books for her and often held her hand. He even took her up to Makeout Point because he had that damn reputation to uphold. (Five States Watson or something? God only knew where
Instead there was an odd hollowness inside, a disgusting feeling, an absolutely detestable feeling. Sherlock swallowed and concentrated hard and he pushed it all the way down, deep far down inside, until it reached a place where it didn’t bother him anymore.
Their eyes met, and in that crystallized moment of knowing, they shared something. They were more intimate now than they had ever been, closer in this dark secret than if their bodies had locked together.
He tries to think if he will be able to stand it. Wraps the blanket tighter around himself, but he can’t seem to get warm.
John gasped, feeling the razor-cut of pain, but he’d always been good about handling pain, he never even cried at getting injections, and something told him he couldn’t yank his wrist away. Sherlock’s fingers were curled tight on his wrist, his grip iron-strong.
He had leaned out of the window far enough to fall, and the swoop in his stomach was like he already was falling, with only Sherlock there to catch him, to pull him out into the night.
John caught Sherlock’s wrist in an attempt to guide his hand back to some safer place, but he kept squeezing and rubbing as if he hadn’t felt John’s touch at all. He was so strong.
He took one last look around at Harry - still splashing, tackling the other girl into the water; at Mummy - still reading, finger in her mouth, book cover no less confusing; at Daddy - still snoring, turning slightly red on his chest and tummy because he never put on enough sunscreen, and Mummy always yelled at him for it.
“But that’s a bit rude,” said John, “Maybe we can give him or her a name. Then we can call her or him by his or her name.”
In Barcelona, the kill was messy. A shattered jaw, flaps of cheek, scattered teeth and a surprised black hole where an eye used to be.
“Oooh,” said John. He was impressed, Sherlock could tell, from the soft way he breathed the sound and leaned in, just a little. “I’ve never read
Then, a knock on glass. John turned, and jolted: there was Sherlock’s sly face at the classroom door, peering in at him through the window. Seeing all. He squeezed his eyes shut and when he opened them again, it was Bill waving at him, pulling a face. John lifted a hand in a feeble greeting back, face burning with embarrassment. Spent the rest of the class staring at his treacherous hand, the sweaty palm. Idle. The devil’s plaything.
“Found it!” Bill cried, thrusting his fist up into the air in triumph. From between his fingers, a thin gold chain glinted in the light.
“It’s dangerous to be out alone at night,” the young man continued. His voice was low, almost soothing.  “Anything could happen to you in the dark, you know.”
“Even if we could convince anyone to tutor you for any extended period of time, you’re not going to be taught all the essentials of magic and wizardry from tutors, Sherlock. You need the structure of a wizarding institution.”
John collapsed on him afterwards, languid and boneless against Sherlock’s chest. He was warm and panting where he lay, a sweaty, trembling mess. His strength had been entirely sapped and replaced by a gelatinous sort of exhaustion. Sherlock reached behind John’s head and gently undid his gag. It was wet with saliva. John stretched his jaw, flexing the aching muscles, sticking out his pink tongue. With his hands still bound behind him, arms still bound tight to his torso, he raised his head and nuzzled against Sherlock’s throat. He pressed kisses up his jaw, until their mouths finally found one another. They kissed, open-mouthed and sloppy the way that kisses can be when both parties are uncoordinated with weariness and bliss, their tongues and lips gently rubbing and caressing with no particular purpose. Neither of them found it in them to care.
“John,” Sherlock said, patiently - and he’d never been patient before, “it is only a Horned slug. There are literally hundreds of them in the Greenhouses.”
“I’m loyal to my friends,” John declared, staring the much older, much taller boy directly in the eye. “And it’s not the only thing about me.”
said, ‘you’ll pay for this Watson!’ when they dragged him off, I didn’t think people actually said things like that, only it sounded like ‘you’ll bay for dis Wadson’ ‘cause I think I broke his nose!”
Each face of the sign stands 30 feet by 30 feet, looking proudly down upon the stretch of Route 66 that passes through 11th Street and Lewis Avenue.
Sherlock chuckled at John’s attempts to move his hips, to increase the friction and speed. “You’re at my mercy like this.” To illustrate, he shifted his hips, side to side and in little circles. John whined, able only to lie there and take it. Heat flooded him at the thought, his prick twitching where it lay, so hard that it rested on his stomach. His face reddened at how much it turned him on.
very smart, and I’ve…I’ve never tried to brew a potion before, so I don’t even know if I’m any good…and it’s…easy to muck it up…”
“We can’t,” John said, although the hitch in his breath betrayed him. He shook his head as if to clear it. “We’d never get anything done. We would starve to death. Who would make dinner?”
He wanted to own it, to be bold, but he let Sherlock push him back until his bare bottom hit the cool metal of the hood of the car. "It's the way you look when you blush," Sherlock said, and John didn't understand, didn't care to understand. Sometimes Sherlock spoke in non sequiturs.
“Yes, you do, don’t you?” Sherlock’s eyes shone with interest, glow of blue phosphorous. He leaned in and for a moment John thought that he might just raise the window himself, and slip into the room. “How do you plan on paying me back?
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Of course I do.” There were two available exits with easy access, currently, just in case this was a trap.
Sherlock’s hands were all over his body. Touching him wherever they could reach, over his hair, his neck, his chest, his arms. Exploring him, running all over, wandering all over, up underneath his shirt, cool hands on his bare skin, skimming over all the sensitive parts of him, squeezing him as if trying to feel him out.
It turned out that Hogwarts was a lot scarier than anyone had ever told John it would be. Not even Harry had said it was scary, and she loved to tell him things like that. One time she’d graphically described A Nightmare on Elm Street to him in all its bloody, gory glory and he had spent the next six months sleeping with a cricket bat, all too ready to pummel whatever monsters came his way.
the way in which two or more concepts, objects, or people are connected, or the state of being connected.
The wall was good. The wall was fine. John could have stayed there happily kissing Sherlock until neither of them could hold themselves up anymore. Sherlock seemed to have another idea. His hands bit hard into John’s thighs and then gravity up-ended for a heartbeat as they spun and tumbled into the sofa. John was still gaping up at the smiley face, trying to reassure himself that up and down still worked, when Sherlock managed to scramble up to his knees to attack John’s clothes. The jumper went up and then stuck there; John clawed at it while his jeans got pulled down, with rough bone-jarring yanks like he was some kind of prey animal Sherlock was trying to shake into submission.
The homeroom bell rang, its shrill chime bringing an end to conversation. They sat up straight and faced forward, paying attention as the teacher began roll call.
“Sh-Sherlock,” John stutters when he is completely exposed. The hitch of breath is delicious. He shivers although the room is warm. His eyes are nearly black when he looks up at Sherlock. It’s this kind of look that exposes a person, and so Sherlock covers John’s eyes with one hand when he bends down to kiss behind his ear.
John couldn’t look, couldn’t focus on it, like looking at the edges of a film as if the camera had lost focus there, and it was so pale, white, skin so white, no, not white but
He could see the outline of Harry in her bedroom, chatting on the phone. He could hear the faint strains of the record she was playing. He could see his mother moving about in the kitchen. He could hear the radio going and smell the warm waft of dinner, aromas of onions and savory meat and roast potatoes in the air. Home safe home.
Sherlock played slowly, coaxingly, breathing in and out in time with John’s breaths until he could feel the fatigue pulling at his own limbs. Initially John watched him intently, but soon his eyes drifted closed, as if to listen more closely in private bliss. Sherlock let him pretend to listen, and every now and then John let out a soft “mm” in agreement to a question never asked.
"Baby," he hears himself say, body covering John's again, hands tilting his hips, his hips colliding with the soft flesh of John's tight ass. So that is the kind of obscenity that tears out of him in this awful all-consuming passion. It's because John is whimpering the most beautiful broken sounds, and every now and then moaning loud and shamelessly. He looks so lost, taken over by pleasure. The sight of him is mesmerizing.
To this day no one knows what happened to the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke...it was as if the entire settlement had simply vanished into thin air.
and the chalk tapping away on the chalkboard and all the figures of lines and his teacher’s droning voice John felt the heat between his legs and the itch at the base of his spine, the sudden fullness and aching. It was impossible to think. He was aware of the subtle friction of his trousers - how, when his fingers clenched on his thigh, it dragged, just barely- over him. As if hypnotized by the sensation, he could not stop doing it, struggling only to control his breathing.
“I want to hear all the noises you can make,” said Sherlock. Yes, that roiling feeling in his stomach, that was excitement.
and he assumed John would be able to keep up, but John’s pulse was hopped up, heart skittering, and Sherlock was still looking at him with such predatory intent, and John admitted, blurted out,  “I’ve never...you know, with a boy before.”
What was wrong with him? Was there somebody else? And what did he mean by stringing her along all this time? These were questions that he knew the answers to, but he could not tell her.
John had climbed plenty of trees in his childhood so this one was no real challenge. He had only twisted an ankle once, and sprained his shoulder another time. Momma said that when he’d hit the ground, his sense of fear had been knocked clean out of him.  Once he reached Sherlock’s window, he took a look inside to confirm it was the right one.
“It is,” Bill said, proudly. “I’ve had it for a while but I think you’re going to need it far more than I do, if you plan to hang around freaky-creepy Holmes all the time.”
Professor Hudson’s office was spacious and bright and nothing at all like a Doomy Dungeon where a young Watson’s dreams might go to die. It smelled like what John imagined Heaven might possibly smell like, like a giant bakery where a dozen bakers baked a hundred of one’s favourite pies, all warmth and cinnamony sugary spice. Red and gold tapestry covered the walls, same as in the Gryffindor Common Room. Vases of royal purple flowers (the same hue as Professor Hudson’s robes) sprouted randomly from various surfaces as if the seeds had alighted upon desks and cabinets and bookshelves and decided to take root and flourish there. The room was filled with squashy floral print sofas, all of them covered with assorted doilies, and one sofa was covered with an orange tabby cat stretched over a lace doily, napping in the sunlight.
John laughed. “Now I know I’m worri--” Sherlock cut him off mid-snark, shoving his knee up and to the side to deposit his lower legs on the back of the sofa. The other leg went with it, both of them caught in the knot his trousers had formed around his thighs.
He didn’t tell Mycroft about John. What did Mycroft need to know about John? He had nothing to tell him, really. It wasn’t like they were friends or anything. It wasn’t like they would be, because Sherlock was a very intelligent person, and he knew how these things generally worked out.
chair, the stacks of medical texts and loose papers, old witness reports half-written, casual messages left in sticky notes gently curling at the edges, kitchen sink a mess, bath tub with questionable stains, the violin silent in the corner.
“So, he was under the water. I understand you’re frightened, but he was only playing. You know how little boys are.”
The lack of John made his arms ache and left his front cold, but it was worth it to watch the sudden deprivation rip through John’s frame. He twisted around to look at Sherlock, puzzled betrayal shining magnificently in his eyes.
When Victor finally pushes inside of him, it’s a heavy,full feeling that makes him keen and gasp, Victor’s hand on his cock stroking him, coaxing him through it, telling him to push out, relax, you can do it and then John’s mind is so overloaded with sensation - especially when Victor begins to rock and rub inside of him - his mind, it goes completely blank. Being filled like this wipes it clean, he’s too overwhelmed for thought or speech, nothing left except for the connection of their bodies together and Victor rubbing gently in and out of him and the thump of blood in his hard dick between them. He is painfully, wonderfully, still aware of who it is inside of him, fucking him in Sherlock’s bed, and Victor squeezes his hand as he pins it to the mattress, and whispers in his ear, “John, John, John, “ as he rocks into him, and then thrusts into him, the headboard knocking rhythmically against the wall. Victor fucks him slowly, careful for his first time and all John can feel is the heat of their bodies and pleasure that sparks bright inside of him, and he wants it to drag on forever, nothing to think about, nothing left but this feeling, ache and fullness and pleasure and pain all twisted together.
It was too hot in the church, hard to think. John looked up to see Jesus with his muscles straining in quiet agony, the godliness of his torso, the tightness of his chest and abdominal musculature, the perfection of his divine features.
“Do they?” John asked with great interest, trying to envision what the healing process could look like, people into tiny amphibious creatures and then back again.
“Even better,” John said, eyes wide and bright with enthusiasm.  They glittered in the half-light of
“Did he, John?” Bill asked, concerned, taking John’s face in both of his hands so that he could peer into his eyes. “Tell me, what do you remember? Anything? Do you recognise who I am? What’s my name? Wait, do you remember
John comes in his trousers, hot and easy, groaning against Sherlock’s mouth. Thinks about the other times he’s come in his pants, just like this, with Sherlock’s voice in his ear whispering obscenity or Sherlock’s mouth on his or Sherlock’s long fingers lightly tracing the crease of his thigh, shudders against the second wave of pleasure that ripples through him. He feels Sherlock keep rocking and then gasp and moan and go still. His chest feels filled with the light of the sun; he’s absorbed the warmth of the earth into him.
Sherlock placed his hands on the workbench, on either side of John’s thighs. He was sizing John up as if there were something about him that he hadn’t seen before. John didn’t think that was possible. When Sherlock leaned in John could smell him; that scent of clean male sweat mixed with motor oil - unmistakably masculine.
Hazel walked down the stairs to find Gladstone baying at the front door. “Shush!” she hissed sharply, clapping her hands, but the dog did not quiet. He would not hush no matter how she scolded or yelled. Gladstone knew, the way that animals always had an instinct for such things, that the storm was closing in upon them.
Sherlock then goes on to complain about the lack of anything interesting in the scenery, and says he is shocked that the road isn’t littered with the corpses of citizens who have dropped dead of sheer ennui, or even a good car crash caused by someone falling asleep at the wheel, what he wouldn’t give for a good car crash, John.
John relaxed totally under his lips, submitting to the promise of sex and soft touches. The shudder of his body was pure temptation. Sherlock cupped John’s cheek, stubble scratching his palm, and petted the bags under his eye with a calloused thumb. He took his time in covering John’s neck in his lips, alternating firm presses of sweet kisses with the sharp slide of his teeth over his carotid artery. He wanted to leave his marks all over him, the impressions of his teeth, the blossoming red that would deepen to a pretty purple later on from the strength of his sucking. He would imprint his kisses into John’s skin. He would implant the knowledge of the heat of his breath and wet slide of his lips over a tendon. He wanted John’s skin to absorb the memory of his touch.
. The eyes were the worst: large and luminous and glassy, like those of deep-sea fish that never saw the light of day. They seemed to glow with an unholy light.
“It’s just....everything,” John said. “A lot of stuff. I really am knackered.” It wasn’t a lie. He suddenly did find himself exhausted, and he didn’t want to be angry and he didn’t want to argue with his friends. “Will you...will you just think about what I said?”
“Open up,” Sherlock commanded, and then, almost kindly: “And try not to gag.” Although that had to be near the top of the list of the greatest earthly pleasures, the sight of John Watson gagging helplessly on his cock.
John choked back a sob, broken little half-sound. His head full of fog and confusion, and heat, and the way Sherlock was rubbing inside of him, in that place, made shockwaves of stimulation ripple through his body. Flicker of     something
In 1939, Julius Robert Oppenheimer, who would one day father the atomic bomb, wrote that a star that has exhausted all its useful nuclear fuel can no longer support itself against the inward pull of its own gravity.
“Welcome,” Jeanette said, making a grand, sarcastic gesture. Her presence was too big for her picturesque little home;  she clashed with the butter-yellow wallpaper, the baby-blue vase of daisies on the coffee table. Next to the daisies sat the August issue of
The paper was already folded open to the latest update on the new NHS policy. John tilted his head a bit to read the second line, blowing absently on his still-steaming tea.
John was usually a careful drinker; too wary of the thirst programmed into his genes. Harry’s stints in rehab, her cyclical addiction, was enough to turn anyone off. When Sherlock had first come home he’d found the bottles, in their cabinets and in the refrigerator, where his experiments used to be. He had done them both the favour of catapulting them out the window, which only earned him the rather mild rebuke of “Sherlock, that’s dangerous!”
Eager to test his hypothesis, he twisted at the little nub. John responded with a hiss of indrawn breath and another squirm.
The stranger, in a gravely serious voice, tells John that he is a rum-runner. A man who is capable of anything.
They had spread out the map on the table, looking at the tiny capillaries of blue and red and green and black, the beige shapes of states, the wide, light blue of ocean. John had never traveled farther than the neighboring farm until he was eleven, when Dad left. After that they traveled a lot - first to his aunt’s and then (when his mother got sick of fighting with his uncle) to his grandmother’s, staying in motels and sometimes sleeping in the car in the times in between. He and Harry had loved it; every day an adventure, every night a new bed, or the car parked in the unknown quiet of someplace new.
"Something rebellious?” Although he’d said nothing of the sort, Sherlock’s tone brought something sordid to mind, as if John had been out necking with a girl before her folks came home.
“It’s all a ruse. I fool people into thinking I can cook by knowing how to make a few things beautifully, and most things not at all,” Victor says, cracking two eggs into a bowl. “Breakfast is a
“Good on you,” said Harry, grinning. “I am in full favour of anyone whose fist makes friends with Carl Powers’ smug little face.”
John's entire body jerks on the seat with the sudden stimulation and he gasps for air. "Oh," he says, and "oh," again. "Go on, stop it some more."
“Touch.” Sherlock gasped, carried away by his own pleasure. The word was almost lost in their resounding groans when Sherlock drove into him with the full force of his body weight. “Touch yourself. I want to see you.”
John’s eyes went wide, darkened, then, with arousal, his breath caught in his throat. His other hand tightened on Sherlock’s jacket, twisting and wrinkling the fine material in his fist, and he nodded.
It was too much vulnerability. John felt silly and exposed. Sherlock pressed a soft, affectionate kiss to the side of John’s face, and then his neck, dropped another one on his collarbone. He pulled back to look at John with his mesmerizing, memorizing stare, touching himself through his jeans, palming and rubbing at his own cock. John didn’t feel so silly anymore. Still very exposed.
they been in a relationship? Did their first declared ‘date’ as a couple count for more than celebratory post-case dinners where a starved and triumphant Sherlock ordered half the menu? Or a stakeout with John huddled around a mid-afternoon cuppa like a warming fire and Sherlock bent low, ostensibly to peer through a dirty window but really so that he could keep looking at John’s charmingly red nose? And what about the romantic walks through a moonlit park while they searched for discarded pantyhose and lubricant from a string of rapes in the North London area?
“You should not worry about anything at all, because I will not allow you to be expelled,” Bill said. “I will testify for you on the stand, even under oath!”
“You leave him alone!” John shouted, he didn’t care who heard. He hoped one of the Professors would hear and put an end to all this, but it seemed like help was not coming. None of the students watching seemed inclined to go and run to any of the authorities, either. It was far too entertaining for that.
“No. I think this will be a good lesson for you,” John said. One of his eyebrows was raised in that way that turned his forehead into lopsided Celtic knots.
Tension melted from John’s body, and he reached up to cup Sherlock’s jaw. His fingers were light on Sherlock’s skin, applying barely any pressure. He touched Sherlock with the same careful hands that stitched skin and set bone, as if this were the most delicate of operations. Being allowed to touch so intimately was still new to John.
“And then you spin her,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand and guiding him. “1, 2, 3, 4.” His touch was confident and sure, his movements deliberate; a natural leader. He caught John as he came back to starting position, placing his hand on his lower back. “Now signal for the dip.”
“Right here,” Sherlock whispers again, gently pressing and massaging until John pushes his hand away.
He was meant to take her to the Spring Fling, but five detentions in three months meant that she was
Rumor has it that that new kid Watson is a real ladykiller; the evidence of it in passionate splotches on his skin.
“Thanks for fixing my bike,” John tried to recover. “I really owe you one,” and laughed a little, to show that all was cool (even when he was feeling decidedly uncool).
John cocks the rifle and hefts it up to his shoulder, staring down the length of the barrel. “I’ll protect you, too,” he says, and pulls the trigger. A can flies off the fence with the hollow sound of a bullet piercing metal, 650 meters away.
Victor shrugs. “I was just wondering. I’m thinking of staying in London a bit longer than I originally planned, and you know my sister and my parents are driving me batty.”
John hesitated. He'd never seen this boy around before, he was certain of it. But the rules were getting fuzzy in his head.
“So what you are saying,” John said, “is that we could get away with murder as long as we don’t get caught.”
“Well, for one, I suppose I could make sure that Victor’s broom will royally dump him on his arse every time he attempts to mount it at next week’s flying lesson.”
Oftentimes it’s smoke inhalation and asphyxiation that kills a person before the flames. But not always.
John tilted his head and regarded him curiously. “How do you know so much? Do you really have evil powers?”
"Relax," Sherlock instructs, "and breathe." He watches the obedient rise and fall of John's chest and belly in response, and licks the crease of his thigh  as reward. His tongue catches the smallest drop of sweat that has formed, like evening dew in late summer. "One day," Sherlock murmurs against his thigh, "two fingers won't feel like enough."
"Oh," says John again, softly, a world of realization in the sound. He scoots himself closer, close enough so that their thighs are pressing together.
Satisfied that John would stay where he’d put him, Sherlock started rooting around between the sofa cushions for something. John entertained himself with pinching and stroking at Sherlock’s abs and nipples while he watched, enjoying the hisses and gasps it won him. “Is now really the time when you desperately need to find the remote?” he asked.
The closest thing John had ever done with a girlfriend was a bland and unappetising experience with chocolate body paint that tasted awful and, once spread, looked even worse.
“This music is a contributing factor to juvenile delinquency. How do we know this? Because of how it feels, when you hear it. What it does to you. The evil of the feeling - the beat, the beat. The rhythm stirs something inside of you. It is a sound sent from the Devil himself, straight from the bowels of hell- ”
Tom got to his feet as well, throwing his newspaper aside. The two of them rushed to the water, screaming John’s name. Her husband headed for Harriet; Hazel could hear him demanding to know where her brother was.
"It’s already enough that you’re here. You didn’t even get a detention! I'm fairly sure I'm meant to do this alone. I mean, not that I’m not
“That’s how it works,” Sherlock explains, not pulling his hand away; if anything, fanning out his fingers, stroking over it through the material of John’s trousers. “You’d be tight, but I’d stretch you. Open you up with my fingers until you were ready. The hardest part is the outer ring, but that’s muscle, and, as is its nature, it contracts and expands. And then, right inside, there’s your prostate gland, which contains a bundle of nerves that are directly connected to your cock. When that part is stimulated, it reacts the same as to any sexual stimuli, resulting in sensations of pleasure and arousal. Right there, that’s where I would rub against when I fucked you.”
Can you imagine Sherlock just working, flexing unnecessarily, pushing an errant curl away from his forehead, bending over to show off his ass, just loving the fact that he has an audience - oh hello John didn’t see you there, I don’t know what you’re talking about I always work on my car like I’m going for Mr. July in a “Hot Boys and Hot Rods” calendar
When John opened his eyes the house had gone silent. His bedroom door was closed. Darkness all around him. The middle-of-the-night stillness that befell all living things; the silence of sleep.
In Boston, Sherlock says, they say that the cobblestone paths are the same that the founders of America walked upon, and when it rains in Government Center the air smells like the sea.
“Two fingers now,” Sherlock says, other hand stroking the crease of John’s inner thigh to watch him shudder and twitch. “They’ll feel like a lot, but you can take it.”
"Yes, oh god yes," John says, nodding frantically. His eyes are squeezed shut with the sensation of it, eyelashes dusky against his cheeks.
At first Victor stays on the sofa, neither of them needing to talk about the way sleeping arrangements will go. But the week Victor intends to stay turns into two, and after that the days roll into each other, filled with trips to the various fancy cafes around London, and takeaway dinners, and excellent breakfasts, and easy conversation, stories about Sherlock, or what Sherlock might think, and horror movie marathons, and John is doing locum work again, and Victor has his firm send London cases his way, and there’s the dull ache that has nested in muscle caged by his ribs, and sometimes they laugh so hard their stomachs hurt, and one night John wakes at 2 in the morning from a nightmare to find Victor already up and making his horrible tea because he can’t sleep, and they’re forced to admit that kipping on sofas is not a long-term solution, particularly not for a man like Victor.
The colonists began repairing the houses that the first failed expedition had built, as well as building new homes. However, they were low on food, tools and supplies, and fearful of attack from natives. And so they persuaded Governor John White to return to England to explain their desperate situation and to seek help.
The new church was rebuilt in stone and loomed imposingly over its congregation with its sharp spire that seemed to reach for Heaven. Outside, the white signboard reminded everyone “
It was enough to make one want to throw a blanket over one’s head and refuse to come out, not that Sherlock did that sort of thing.
His heart thrummed. Sherlock was definitely probing too much, but John couldn't think of a suitable lie. He bit his lip, but the silence was unbearable. “True Tales of Terror," he said eventually, and flushed.
John felt hot all over, trapped underneath the weight of Sherlock’s hand upon his chest, pressing upon him, heat in his stomach and tingling in between his thighs, as if the engine were still rumbling underneath him. His whole body felt as if it were vibrating, and he didn’t know what to say.
Sherlock was secretly brave. Maybe they could both be brave together, and go on adventures. Maybe they could play Quidditch together on the same team,  and take all the same classes and see each other every day…
John frowned. He had heard something similar to that before, but now he couldn't quite place who had said it.
He found himself grabbing at Sherlock’s wrist; Sherlock let him. His skin was warm and dry to the touch, just as skin should be. John placed two fingers over where the radial artery ought to be, and thought, for one horrid moment, that he would feel nothing, Sherlock’s body still warm but blood bright red on the pavement, skull shattered as if it were sugar and thick red seeping out and—
is where Sherlock has him, where John needs him. Thrusts right up into him and John clenches, spins out a sound that is half-whine and half moan. "Ready?" Sherlock asks, hips moving in teasing, rubbing motions, pulls out just enough so that the head of his dick is rubbing against John's prostate so that he can watch John shake.
Sherlock kisses up his neck and tells him about New York, about Boston, about London, all the places that John’s never been, while his fingers work on opening his shirt.
He brushed the back of his fingers over John’s heated cheek, another fleeting touch that didn’t last nearly long enough.
John whimpers when Sherlock's hand finds his erection and lightly traces the shape of it through his trousers, fingers skating, teasing. John squirms as if unsure whether to push into it or to try and pull away, but one thing is for sure: he does not attempt to push Sherlock's hand away.
have time," said Sherlock, as if he were the owner of all the time in the world, and those who sought to use some had to sign it out from him.
“How could you forget to check if the door was locked?” Hazel whisper-shouted. She suddenly wanted a cigarette. She had not smoked since before Harriet was born. Instead she got up to put the kettle on for tea. “How many times have I said that door needs to be locked? He could have drowned!”
"Extraordinary," Sherlock praises, pressing kisses against John's face, kisses against his neck. Soothes him with press of mouth against heated skin as he forces him open, stretches him with his cock.
Downstairs breakfast was waiting, and Harry was in the bathroom messing with her hair ribbon, making him wait for his turn, and he could hear the familiar sounds of paper bags rustling as Momma bustled about the kitchen, packing their lunches with all her curlers still in place.
things with it, like talking about sentimental matters. He made a sound that could have been loosely interpreted as “Do we really have to do this?”  He would have much rather slept, which was saying something. Or had sex again, of course, which should always be included on any list of options when options were available (and even when they weren’t).
The hallways were eerily quiet, empty of the normal hustle and bustle of students. The heavy, oppressive silence made John think of a ghost town, or perhaps, even, a
“What a trap. What kind of idiot pays 25 cents for a penny’s worth of twine?” Sherlock asks rhetorically.
; meaning clear, bright, famous, renowned. Her name doesn't matter; name her Mary or Sarah or Jeanette.
“Well I think everybody’s making a big deal outta nothing. Philip said that the Sheriff said that the next time he’s caught out he’ll be spending the night in jail, just to teach him a lesson!”
He smiled, also, because that meant that there was a lot that he knew about that Sherlock didn’t. “Well, I don’t know too much about how they work, but they use them to power small machines, like torches and toys and ‘lectric razors and stuff like that. They come in different sizes and provide energy, and they eventually run out. There’s a negative side and a positive side and when they get old they might leak or explode and the acid inside will burn you so you mustn’t play with old batteries.”
He managed to pull off a fair imitation of humble for long enough to get Madam Pomfrey to allow him into the Infirmary, although he was warned not to disturb John, who was sleeping as the potion worked its magic. She needn’t have worried. Sherlock had never been given an opportunity to watch anybody sleep before (and indeed, he’d never had an inclination to) and now he wasn’t going to ruin it for the world.
He could feel the stiffness of John’s body underneath his palms, the way his muscles tensed, contracting and coiling, the way his mouth was still and slack underneath the insistent press of Sherlock’s mouth.
“I want to see you,” said Sherlock. He pulled back, pulled out, and with that withdrawal he wrenched a feeble soft noise from John’s lips just as the head of his dick caught on the rim of his hole, before that was tugged out as well. John felt empty, open without it. Not so tight anymore. With equal parts horror and pride, he thought, I might never be the same.
Sherlock didn’t need any further encouragement. He reached down between them and guided the head of his dick right where it needed to be, slick and warm and waiting for him to fill it up. A moment of pressure, a moment of resistance.
Sherlock had read this in a document found in a manila envelope, left on the  kitchen countertop labeled
She pushed back the covers and leapt out of bed. Her breath and heart both fast in her chest, she slowly cracked open the bedroom door.
"Good," John decides, and in an instant he's pulling Sherlock  towards him, over the gear shift. He mashes their lips together with no coordination, click of teeth colliding at first, but then he finds his way, licking at Sherlock's mouth and demonstrating what an expert study he is.
“Augh!” Pillow to the face, camera to the eye socket; John had incredible aim and a hell of a throwing arm. Sherlock tumbled backwards over the coffee table to land sprawled on the sofa. The camera landed with unpleasant loudness on the floor--hopefully it wasn’t broken, bloody thing had cost enough--while John shouted, “Damn it, Sherlock, not while I’m sleeping!”
They stop for dinner in Baxter Springs, Kansas. They walk into the restaurant with both of them still covered in dirt with little clouds of dust nearly puffing off of them. Sherlock introduces them to an uncaring waitress as Al and Lucky, a pair of good boys “just passin’ through, not lookin’ for no trouble.”
“No,” said Sherlock quickly. “Well, yes. I mean, yes, but it’s not what you think. Don’t take away House points. Can you get me a terrarium?”
“You leave him alone,” John said, taking a step forward as well. “Looks like your nose healed crooked. Maybe you need me to fix it for you?”
Sherlock snatches the lighter out of Vic’s hands and pitches it as hard as he can. It lands with a clatter on the pavement, too far away to be heard.
His eyes are closed. His mouth is open. Nothing comes out. No whimper, no sound. He can’t even form the word
Sherlock clutched the edges of the book tight, and waited for it. Weird. Boring. Strange. Unhealthy.
that you’re here, but I don’t want you to get into trouble for helping me! I bet they wouldn’t like it if I had help."
There are few scars on John’s torso, on his back, and their sizes and shapes speak to Sherlock of a belt strap here, maybe a switch here; easy enough to see that there might have been marks of a heavy hand as well but those scars are invisible. John laughs at Sherlock’s insistent probing and says that he reckons most people take their fair share of beatings every now and again; Sherlock has for sure, fists and elbows and kicking boots, but never from someone legally bound to ensure his well-being. The twist inside gets tighter and higher and there’s a hot feeling in the back of his throat.
He saw them later, chasing each other in the water, giggling and splashing and acting silly. He looked back to where Mummy sat, higher up on the beach, in her hat and sunglasses. She was busy reading her book with the shirtless muscley man on the cover who was struggling to hold up a lady in what appeared to be some sort of windstorm.  Daddy snoozed on the beach blanket, the radio crackling out the game, and if John listened real hard, he thought he could hear him snore.
John swayed on his little feet, standing there in the middle of the hallway. The movement was small and graceful, almost as if he were moving to some music that she could not hear. His eyes were closed.
“Go away,” John said, against Sherlock’s mouth. He dropped the sheet to push at him playfully. “I’m not ready yet. Go outside and then come back in so I can be waiting for you in your bed, all sexy like.”
John stammered, caught off guard by such a question. He didn’t have much to offer, now did he? What could Sherlock possibly be interested in?
And if he doesn’t concentrate, if he doesn’t think, he can fall into step with someone whose strides are longer than his, each of them compensating for the other, can remember what it was like to occasionally bump shoulders, can hear the various deductions and horrible insinuations about passersby.
Hazel got out of bed, putting her feet in her slippers and pulling on her robe. Something was wrong. She could not explain it, but she was sure of it.
John came with a shout, dick twitching, spurting thick drops of semen onto Sherlock’s shirt. He came with shudders and cries, the sounds leaking through the gag, his body jerking, clenching and squeezing around Sherlock’s cock. The pleasure was so intense it was almost excruciating, and Sherlock felt his orgasm milked out of him, John’s muscles fluttering and contracting around his cock. He watched John fall apart as he filled him with his cum, watched John writhe and come completely undone, while his own pleasure unspooled from where it had been wound tight in the core of his body.
And so Sherlock had known the altercation with Powers would escalate the moment he saw the boy with the red-marked Charms quiz clutched in his hand. He had predicted that a crowd would gather and that none of them would offer any assistance: Bystander Effect. What he had not accounted for was John Watson, who was baffling and fascinating in the extent to which he baffled him.
Sherlock smiled at him, as if he weren’t an idiot at all. It was an obvious lie, but Sherlock’s smile was warm and perhaps only the slightest bit amused.
Sherlock stopped. He pushed a curl out of his face with the back of his hand; he still left a smudge of grease on his forehead.
“John!” Hazel shouted, as if her little boy was only hiding, playing a game. Her voice was loud in the night; large in the small, dark room. She could fill up every corner with it.
Sherlock pulled out of him carefully, still breathing heavily. He helped John lower his legs down to a more comfortable position, thank god. John wasn’t sure his joints still worked. They could worry about the potential mess on the sofa later. For now, he reached up and pulled Sherlock down to him, wanting to feel their bodies together as long as possible before prickly heat and stickiness drove them both up to seek cleaning. Practically purring with happiness, Sherlock kissed him on the forehead and stuffed his nose under John’s ear.
“Of course,” Sherlock told him. “It wouldn’t hurt any. Well. It would only hurt real quick, just for a moment. And then you could breathe underwater, just like me.”
Sherlock really thought he wouldn’t wake up until morning, which was terribly dull, considering how very not-tired he himself was. He considered giving John a shake himself to wake him up, and after another moment’s consideration, he slid himself out of bed to do it. He had both hands on John’s shoulders and was about to shake him when John stirred and woke of his own accord, letting out a sharp little cry of surprise when he saw how close Sherlock’s face was to his own.
“John?” Hazel knocked on the door. There was no sound from inside the bathroom, not even those of water splashing or childish imitations of explosions.
“What? No, of course not,” Bill said quickly. “People always act strange. Everybody’s strange. Duck!” The three of them ducked just in time to avoid the swarm of duck feather quill bundles that sailed over their heads.
"I can still walk!" said John, and he slid off the stool to prove it and nearly broke his nose in the process. Lestrade stumbled forward and caught him, just in time.
hungry gaze. His mind was clouded, as if with fever. He could not speak, only sounds. Low, whining, plaintive, like a wounded animal. His lips felt strangely sore, linger of metallic taste on his tongue, lolling out,    (
Despite Bill’s not-really-reassuring statistics, he still felt that he was Gryffindor House’s Undesirable No. 1.
even if he wanted it, and his own helplessness makes his body shudder, a reaction as involuntary as the galloping beat of his heart.
In reality, it wasn’t all that different from kissing a woman, although the height difference was admittedly new - the tallest woman John had ever dated had been 5’8”. Aside from the craning, the only true difference was that when John opened his eyes, it was Sherlock blinking lazily down at him. John felt revealed under that gaze. It was a little like the first time they had met, when Sherlock could tell everything about him from a glance. John had wanted to hide from it and bask in it all at once. Kissing Sherlock, with his soft, enthusiastic, supernaturally unchapped lips, made a warmth unfurl in John’s chest, made his breath catch with excitement. Most of all, it had made him want to do it again.
“Maybe I don’t want to be popular,” said John, who had only just had his first taste of what it meant not to be.
,” Sherlock declared grandly, already using the sleeve of his robe again to mop up the potion already on John’s forehead. He was dabbing and blotting very hard. It made John wince but at least it didn’t feel as if his flesh were being eaten away..
John sat up a little straighter, and tried his best to hide his smile behind his cup of tea. This proved rather difficult, so he took a sip of tea instead.
Carl was a Gryffindor boy, two years’ John’s senior, in Harry’s class. He was a Beater on the Quidditch team, a position that suited him perfectly. Although John had only known him for a few weeks, Harry had described him as a particularly detestable boy, which was something, since Harry found all boys somewhat detestable. John was inclined to agree when he found the ‘Welcome to Gryffindor, Firstie’ frogs in his bed, courtesy of Carl.
“Yes, and ghoulish stuff, mysteries, true crime stories and murders, yes, all of it,” John finished for him, hurriedly. He had to fight the urge to squirm with embarrassment.
Sherlock quickly pushed himself up with one hand and scooped the camera with the other, scrambling to his feet. He then jogged off into the other room, leaving John blinking at the ceiling. By the time John pushed himself up onto his elbows, Sherlock’s long legs had already carried him away, before John could even get to his feet.
The reality of John’s skin was warm and soft in a way underneath Sherlock’s hands. The muscles in John’s arms were tense still, battle-ready. How Sherlock wanted to unfold him.
After a few seconds of that hangdog expression, Sherlock took pity. He set the camera down on his chest of drawers, stepped forward to drop to his knees between John’s legs, and pulled him down into a slow, sensuous kiss.
When the shivers subsided the embarrassment set in. Day had come; harsh sun chased away the night’s phantoms and filled the room with heat. His face flushed with warmth; his bedclothes were overly hot and stuck to his skin.
In answer to Sherlock’s cocked eyebrow, John added quickly, “Shirtless. I can do shirtless. And then...we’ll see. No promises for now.”
She lay in bed with her eyes wide open, blanket clutched tight in both hands. She could feel her nails cutting into her palms even through the softness of the blanket.
"Don't you dare do anything like that again, you hear me?" Harry said, and then she cleared her throat to release the tremble from her voice. "You could have gotten killed or kidnapped! Mum and Dad would have my head!"
“Cool it, Daddy-o,” John says, and they both laugh, muffling their laughter into each other: Sherlock, with his face pressed into John’s hair, inhaling the golden hay-in-sunshine scent of him, John, face pressed into Sherlock’s leather jacket, tucked warmly against his chest, the fit of him perfect.
Victor pushes himself up, carefully peeling them apart, and then makes a face as he looks down between them. “Well,” he says, “that’s disgusting.”
John did not wake again until after Madam Pomfrey called “Lights out!” in the infirmary, and all the lamps had dutifully extinguished themselves in little puffs of smoke. Sherlock had camped out in the neighbouring bed, sprawled out on his stomach and reading
“No,” John replied, and put his bike into that awaiting chamber. He had to reach up on the tips of his toes to get the lid of the trunk, before slamming it closed with both hands.
John was nodding, begging, “Please, Sherlock, please,” agreeing “yes, yes,” over and over again as Sherlock stroked him and his cock rubbed inside of him. He was sultry with heat, fevered with need, mouth open panting hot, insides squeezing, and oh, how he needed to be fucked, good and hard and

Taking his clothes from him with ease.
He gets up, instinctively, grabbing the blanket at the end of the bed - tucked in far too tight - and gives it a good yank so that he can pull it around him. Sherlock’s pillow is askew, dimpled in where Sherlock’s head had been. The clock on the nightstand reads 4:38.
"So they're saying I came from a bean?" John said, not knowing quite why he should be insulted, yet he felt a little slighted regardless. He looked down the table to see if any beans were being served, and whether he should be concerned that they were human beans.
Sherlock pushing in, too much, too quickly, the burn and the stretch and the cleaving of John’s virgin body. John’s throat felt raw; felt rawness inside of him -something so hard pushing deep, all the way up into the core of him.  It was inside of him, forcing him open. Split open, from his belly to the base of his throat. John clutched at his pillow, something, anything, for an anchor, for comfort.
