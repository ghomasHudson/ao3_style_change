God this was fucking weird.
"Will you can it and carry something Stark?" Clint demanded, jogging to retrieve the ball and stick it back in the basket he'd been carrying. "We're at the beach, not creating your newest source of unnecessary income."
There was a silence between them for a moment, Tony fighting to focus on Steve at his side rather than the stars above. Finally he glanced over, and Steve reached out to give his hand an encouraging squeeze. Tony didn't want to sound stupid, but he'd seen Steve through some of his nightmares, and Steve had definitely been there for a few of Tony's. Steve wouldn't think he was stupid over this.
That at least got an attempt at a laugh, one of Steve's hands coming back out of his pockets to rub the back of his neck. "So it hasn't changed," Steve breathed, a mixture of relief and dread to his tone. "It's been- Well. I figured it wouldn't be the same place."
"I uh... Well, that is.. You know those little vaccum cleaners that move around by themselves?" At Steve's nod, Tony grinned. "I kind of invented the Jarvis. You know, the-"
"He's not. So it doesn't matter. And he's not going to be." Steve tried to make that part perfectly clear. Nat especially had a habit of trying to set him up with people and he just was not in the mood for that. What he had going with Tony was good. Maddening, but good. "He sleeps around way too much for me and I don't think he wants anything serious anyway. He's had opportunities to make a move. So have I. Neither of us have taken them. So.. just.. drop it. I'm inviting him, though, yes. I think you guys will love him. He's.. he's really great."
Steve wasn't looking at him as he said, "He died three years ago, the day before out anniversary."
Silence, brought on by a forceful kiss from Steve. Tony groaned into it, pressing his still cloth-protected erection into Steve’s leg. Dammit. Steve was just as hard, and it thrilled Tony to no end to realize that Steve genuinely wanted to explore this kink with him.
"Come on then," Steve urged, hoisting Tony up to carry him bridal-style.
"Anyway!" Tony said loudly, decicind this was perhaps a little too much when he was trying to make a good fucking impression on Steve's friends, who he was meeting for the very first time, just now. First. Time. Kill him. "So these are my lovely friends, Steve, and while I'm sure they'd love to tell you all sorts of dirty little secrets about me I think it's only fair that your friends get a chance to do the same for you, right? Right."
"Hey shell head, are you listening to me?" Steve asked, removing his arm from Tony's shoulder to instead place his palm on the top of Tony's head and give him a playful shake. "Tony? You in there? Can you help me set up the chairs?"
"Tony." Rhodey's voice was firm this time. He'd done it again, hadn't he? Tony offered his best friend a tired smile and a short nod. There was no sense lingering on it any longer.
"Wanted you so bad Tony," Steve said as he gazed down at the man, one hand resting teasingly between Tony's thigh and pelvis, holding him in place. He slowed his thrusts for a moment, and Tony, god bless Tony, he did his best to grind against Steve but that grip was so strong. "Want you so bad," Steve corrected. Tony stared up at him, catching the meaning behind the words. Steve didn't want to be a one night stand. Tony.. didn't want him to be, either.
The second finger met some resistance, if only momentary, and Tony’s erection gave an impatient twitch. Tony wanted it now, needed it now, how could Steve be so cruel? How could he make him wait? Why, Steve, why won’t you just fuck me? And it was then that Tony realized he’d been saying all of this out loud, because Steve laughed and pulled the fingers apart, pressed as deep as he could manage. Tony let out a groan, trying to push back onto the knuckles even though he knew he couldn’t.
"Not the hat," Tony pleaded, eyes shooting to the mock-dunce cap sitting behind the bar. 'I Make Shit Decisions' was written on it a few times, and it would not be the first time that Anthony Edward Stark was given the fool's crown. "I'll be good. Scouts honor."
On the other side was Bucky, and the moment Steve saw him he was grinning. The two exchanged a quick hug before Steve realized Natasha was along with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What?" Tony demanded. Steve handed him the phone in his hand, and Tony read over the text message.
The concept of sex with Steve had definitely crossed Tony's mind a time or two. He would be a shitty liar if he even tried to say it hadn't. Steve was so attractive, and deeper than that, he was an incredible person who Tony definitely had some feelings for. But Tony liked the bachelor lifestyle. Kind of. Even if lately he spent more nights hanging out in Steve's apartment than bedding strangers, even if he preferred eating the home cooked meals Steve insisted on making ("You order food too often," he'd argued with Tony) to dining with beautiful men and women who he wouldn't want to see again. Fuck.
"Jerk," Tony squeaked at him, and then dropped his head into his hands. He hated when Steve was right. He'd known last night- when they stopped arguing- that he'd have a sore throat today. It was why he'd said so little when they went to bed. He was hoping to fix the situation before Steve caught on. Too little too late now, wasn't it?
For a moment Tony was shocked into silence- and hey, Steve deserved applause for that right? But then there was a goofy grin on his face (uh, no, Tony would later insist it was a really seductive and attractive and manly and... just not goofy!) and he was reaching up to tug Steve down to him.
This had become like a strange little game, if Steve was being honest. Each time he came home there was a prize of sorts for letting his neighbor use his home without calling the police. First the new door handle, then some fancy pens (Steve had to assume it was because he kept using the ones laying on the coffee table) and a toaster. Which was great, since his didn't work. Normally Steve might be a bit put off by how many one night stands the stranger had, but he was so amused by it all that he didn't really care. Now he was eager to run into A. E. Stark.
"Drink it while it's warm. I've gotta go tell Barton about this, he'll enjoy it."
It was the first time Tony met Steve and Bucky, but it was far from the last time he saw the couple.
"Push you into this," Rhodey snorted. "Wow. I can't believe you Tones. Since when are you afraid to try to fuck someone?"
Hey everyone! Sorry for the delays, my life has been super hectic! I think part of the problem too is I knew how I wanted to end this, and how I wanted to start it, but I stalled out on what should happen in the middle. I'm getting there, though, I have more ideas and I'm ready to write!
It took Steve a lot longer than it should have to get dressed. He was honestly hoping that Tony would walk in, explain he'd just gone to get breakfast. He didn't expect Tony to cook, after all. After a solid twenty minutes swept by with Steve sitting on the couch and no noise from the hall, he slipped his shoes on and took what he definitely considered his walk of shame.
"Good, because I'll be honest, I was kind of afraid we might get into a fight and.. I mean, look at you. Shit." This did earn a laugh, and Steve realized with a start that they were still pretty close. He stepped back, and the stranger in his doorway stared. "I.. I should let you into your apartment. Shit. I am so sorry. Here, lemme." The guy stepped back, into the apartment once more, and Steve followed.
"Alright, well what about Puppis there?" Steve continued. This one seemed to get Tony's attention, though he wouldn't admit it was because he'd never seen that one. "And Canis Major."
"Tones?" It wasn't Steve or Bucky; it was Rhodey, reeling him back in as gently as he could. Tony blinked rapidly, turning to look at him before sighing quietly and pulling a rag from his shoulder to start wiping down the counter. Rhodey was... he was right, it was time to close up and move on. Maybe next year he shouldn't come out here on this night. Maybe he should take that night off, specifically, and move on from this weird fixation he had on Steve and Bucky returning. There were a million and one possibilities, ones he'd gone over more times than he should have.
"How'd you tell Jarvis not to let us know where you were?" Steve wondered, pulling down a fresh tea bag and coming to rest with his chin on the Island that Tony was seated at. Stark finished off his firecracker and flicked the stick at the super soldier. "Jarvis, secret code one zero five." Steve dropped his voice to a mocking rasp, and he couldn't quite complain about the shove it received.
“If there’s a bigger piece, I’m gonna make you guys wrestle over it,” Tony declared, earning a laugh from both that left him feeling a little dizzy. “I can’t interest you in some dinner to go with?”
"Do you have a better mirror?"
Steve was moaning into the rough kiss Tony offered, and didn't that just get him going? Tony was backing up, knowing exactly how to get to his bedroom from here, and Steve was following along like a lost sinner on his way to sanctuary. And fuck was he coming to the wrong place, because Tony was all about furthering their sins together. If Tony's kiss was raw, Steve's was fucking filthy. He slammed Tony into the door to his bedroom, and all Tony could do was whimper and grind against Steve, looking for any sort of friction. He was achingly hard now, ready for this to get going, thinking about how it was overdue. Luckily, Steve had control of this part, and he hooked one arm around Tony's waist before shoving the bedroom door open and backing him in until he fell on the bed.
Why had he invited his friends?
Tony stood and stretched, glancing at his watch. "You know, there's plenty of things I could catch you up on," he offered. And okay, he would have said 'like dinner', but he was trying to behave. He didn't need one of his conquests to live a floor below him. Not that.. Steve would be a conquest. Steve was the type of guy you introduced to your parents. You know, if you talked to them, or if they weren't dead. But the point was he was that type. Tony absolutely refused to think about (today at least) how Steve was also the type of guy who'd have you fisting the sheets and crying into the pillow of your parents bedroom because good god look at him, he was definitely the type to fuck you thoroughly and-
Up until the door shut and Steve actually realized what he'd said.
your love. With Bucky and Steve, though? He didn’t respect it. He idolized it. It was the sort of love that you never wanted to see broken. He could listen for hours to their stories (and did, on more than one occasion) and watch the way that Steve’s eyes crinkled when Bucky called him doll, catch the subtle way that Bucky seemed to melt whenever Steve touched his hand in passing conversation. It was something good and pure, and Tony thought to himself that when he fell in love one day, that was the sort of love he wanted.
"Stupid!" he told himself, rolling his eyes as he headed for the bathroom and a shower. "Guy hides in your apartment twice a month from one night stands and you flirt with him. Nice."
just stop and take our order, can you?” Tony gave him a scandalized look at the accusation, before letting out a little laugh and shrugging his shoulders. Well, you got me. After that, it was pretty much his usual night. Tony got their order, he let them eat in peace. He watched, occasionally, letting himself get swept up in the love in their eyes and the way that Steve laughed at Bucky’s jokes. Steve, who’d laughed at a lot of things in this diner, but seemed to have a
"You've got it bad man," Clint commented with a sigh, causing both super soldier and genius to glance in his direction. Clint didn't seem to want to elaborate, though, and Natasha promptly grabbed him by the wrist to drag him towards the ocean. Tony didn't ask why, silently thanking her for taking him away before he could say anything more.
"Is that what this is about? You missed me?" And the way his lips twisted up into a smile had Tony's eyes narrowing because damn him. And he was about to give in, this was all about to go so well when suddenly Steve was pushing off of the wall, coming over for what Tony was sure was a kiss, and Tony moved to brace himself against the table behind him and-
Tony stepped out of it.
Steve offered his own broad smile at this, and leaned down to kiss Tony's lips once more before breaking his grip all together.
"I know the constellations," Tony grumbled, a little put off that Steve thought he wouldn't know such a simple thing. Steve didn't let that stop him, though.
The thing was that the kiss had been great and spontaneous- and then it had been over. Tony hadn't known what to say, Steve had been blushing too furiously to even bother, and none of the others were around to call them on that shit and make them deal with it. In fact, as far as Tony knew none of the others were even aware. Because nothing had been said up to this point, Tony wasn't sure where they stood. He'd done his best to just act like they normally did. It was normal to kiss your best friend spontaneously (actually Steve had been the one to do the kissing and could Tony just say, wow) when you were worked up over a really exciting day of beating the shit out of super villains.
"Why do you have to say it like that? It's absolutely not what you're making it out to be." If Tony didn't sound at all convincing, it was because even he was having trouble lying to himself these days.
The shovel talk. Tony licked his lip, trying to keep calm. He was getting the shovel talk. How much had Steve said about him? Was it that serious that they really thought they were going to hook up?
, but he realized that night that he’d also learned that the diner was the true definition.
It didn't take much thought to figure out that Bucky was the friend who'd served with Steve. His prosthetic was nice, but it was obviously that. Tony's inventive brain was kicking into gear, but he remembered Pepper drilling a simple message into his brain; don't buy people. He needed Bucky to like him before he started offering to build him prosthetic masterpieces. If he even could.
He still remembered (with great clarity) the first time he was fucked against a mirror. His face pressed against the cool reflection. Cock gently rubbing against it from time to time, leaving thick, slick residue that definitely was not window cleaner. What Tony remembered best, though, was staring deep into his own eyes and reflecting on how absolutely shattered he looked. He’d come completely undone at the hands of his lover- who’s name he unsurprisingly couldn’t remember- and Tony had openly wept at how beautiful this surrender was.
Notice anything new about your door? Besides the note. That's right, you have a new door handle! Why? Because the old one was way too easy to break into, and we just can't have that. Don't worry, I didn't steal anything. In fact, as you can see, I replaced the only thing I broke. To be fair, it only broke because of faulty production- you should really be thanking me for breaking in. Imagine if someone bad had done it. Anyway, the point is. I had a crazy one night stand pounding on my door and needed a place to hide. I'm really sorry it was your place but I remember that time I dropped that box on your foot. You apologized to me. It was totally my fault. So I figure you're a nice guy. I'm sorry, this is long, isn't it? I had a lot of time to kill. What the hell are you even doing that has you away this long? Alright, in closing. I got you a new door handle which means new keys. Come up to apartment 6E and pick them up.
"Steven Rogers do not fucking finish that sentence," Tony hissed, pushing Dum-E aside as he tried to sweep up the pieces. No, maybe it was.. fixable, maybe it could just.. Okay no, this thing was garbage now. Days without sleep for nothing, and the reason was reaching for his shoulder. Tony turned on Steve in an instant. "Why the fuck did you think it was a good idea to come barging in here when you knew I was probably-"
Steve wondered what sort of things Tony had gotten up to when he was tired of Netflix. Wondered where he'd sat, what things he'd touched. It was strange to think he was okay with this situation, with a stranger in his home, and honestly he couldn't explain why. Maybe it was because there was something incredibly non-threatening about his neighbor. The worst thing he could imagine Tony doing was peeking around in the bathroom for toilet paper.
"I'd like to say you have a really nice apartment." Tony was apparently trying to make small talk happen. Steve might not have laughed, but his eyes definitely lit up and Stark's smile had Steve sure he'd been caught. "Simplistic usually doesn't feel homey, but it's comfortable. And the art is nice, but I don't think I've seen it anywhere else."
With that, she and Clint were gone. Steve spent the next forty minutes scouring the tower. He'd asked Jarvis, finally, but apparently Tony had set his location to be accessed only upon emergency. Of course. Steve was frantic, heading for the elevator to check the lower floors when..
Tony held the door for Steve, following him inside and after a moment of thought flipping over the closed sign. They didn't need any more guests tonight. He would have absolutely followed through on closing up if Steve hadn't been the one to show up. Tony didn't have to be the genius that he was to tell that Steve really needed this, for whatever reason. He watched him freeze in his place and seem to consider as he stared at the booth he usually sat in. With Bucky. After a moment Steve finally made his decision, wandering over to the booth and taking a seat. Tony looked to Rhodey, who wore sympathy on his face as he set to making Steve's glass of Pepsi. Steve had once confided that he didn't often drink soda, but their trips to the diner were meant to be a special treat, so why not?
And of course Tony helped his customers. He moved from table  to table. He dropped a dollar in the jukebox and played a few songs, kept conversation light at his tables. Tony had definitely associated Steve and Bucky with the word
"Accurate shit talk," Steve corrected, setting the tea down.
Tony's head shot up, eyes centering in on him in a second. Part of him wanted to rejoice because of course he'd missed his best-friend-boyfriend while he was gone. But Tony was a complex creature, so rather than going with what most of him wanted he listened to that tiny voice in the back of his head demanding he holler at him.
There were the bad possibilities, too, but Tony had done everything he could to push them away even as they became more and more frequent. What could have happened to the two? What the fuck would Steve and Bucky ever deserve in this world besides something good?
He spent the better part of the night talking himself out of following up with more flirtations the next time he saw his neighbor. Finally he settled on the idea that he didn't even know if any of Tony's home intruders were male, so he shouldn't be thinking so hard into it anyway. Maybe Tony had grinned so big because he took Steve's words for a joke. It was kind of a joke, right?
Then Steve was laughing, and Tony instantly flew into panic mode.
"But he's always in the lab," Steve protested, and perhaps it was because she loved him or perhaps it was because Captain America had a really nice set of puppy dog eyes, but Natasha was rolling her eyes and shoving him aside.
“You just wait, Tony,” Bucky’d told him then. “You’re gonna see us every year from now on. The day we got that cake. It’s real special, you know? Me and Stevie like to make a big deal out of little shit. You make sure you remember that one day. Always make a big deal about the little shit. Love ain’t about a perfect relationship. It’s about he perfect moments.”
So here Tony was, sulking in the woods around a camp fire. Except he was quick to insist he wasn't sulking, even if everyone else was really enjoying picking at him for it. The thing was Tony was trying to be a good sport about this. He was trying to suck it up. But he'd forgotten how different the sky was when you got this far away from the city. The stars were so bright, dammit. They were getting closer. They had to be getting closer. There was no way he was imagining that.
"Anthony," Steve tried again, this time at least getting a scowl. But Tony went right back to sucking on that popsicle, and Steve found himself steadily becoming distracted with it. No, wait, there was a real problem here!
"Don't just barge in here and shut off my speakers," Tony snapped, abandoning Dum-E's scolding to instead lash out at Steve. He was tired. So ready for bed. So ready for those big strong arms, and all the things that those calloused hands could do to him. "I'm busy, you know I hate when you-"
"Of course man, Tony's got actual owner things to do anyway," Rhodey said, cupping his hand on the back of Tony's neck and drawing him away by the shirt. They didn't stop behind the counter; they made it into the kitchen, and Tony sagged against the wall where Steve couldn't see. "He say anything?" Rhodey asked, voice gentle. He knew that Tony was torn up about this, and Tony hated himself for it. He had no right to be, but watching Steve hurt after every laugh he'd shared with him and Bucky, the stories, the smiles... It was difficult, to say the very least.
"Don't-" Tony tried, but Steve either ignored him or didn't hear. With a sigh the genius gathered his tea and another popsicle and went to hole up in the bedroom. Lab would be nice, but he felt like moping now.
"I'm not an idiot!" Tony paused, considering. He lifted his hands in surrender at the very clear look that Rhodes gave him. Fuck Rhodey for knowing him better than anyone in the world, honestly. "Okay I can be very, very stupid with people sometimes but even I'm not that bad." The look just kept going. "I'm not!"
"I still say we would have had more fun at an amusement park." Tony was grumbling at Steve's side, toes twisting in the sand. They'd been here a grand total of five minutes and already Tony was full of complaints.
Steve found A. E. Stark- Tony- to be really easy to talk to. The conversation was all over the place, and at one point technology somehow got worked into the mix. Steve ended up completely lost, but hearing Tony talk about it was absolutely mesmerizing. He didn't have the heart to tell the man that he had no idea what he was talking about, but Tony haad caught on about ten minutes in when he started making shit up on the spot and Steve just nodded.
"Where are you going?" he wanted to know, wondering if he had actually crossed a line here.
knew how and when to drop a line just right to leave you cracking and it seemed like he never failed. The first thing Tony noticed about him was the way he wore that ragged worker style while still looking so
"Alright. I'm trusting you to handle this one." Tony wasn't sure that look really conveyed trust, but at least it wasn't as severe now. Tony eyed the cake on the nearby counter top, rubbing his hands over his apron as they felt suddenly sweaty. Maybe the cake would be too much, or maybe it would be just right. Hadn't he just said to Rhodey that he wasn't stupid? That he could handle this? Well, he hadn't promised, and Rhodes should know to make him promise so that there would at least be less of a chance of him totally fucking up.
laugh at the scathing, scandalous look that Bucky gave him- “And
Before he could explain himself, Steve was kissing him silent again. This time held more passion rather than raw need. It was very reassuring, and then Steve was breaking away and planting a gentle kiss in Tony’s hair.
Tony fidgeted, a little overwhelmed with how sweet Steve was. Sometimes he just got so caught up in his own pride that he forgot how nice it was to have his super soldier here to take care of him.
There was a sharp inhale as Tony caught sight of his skin, exposed to the cool air of the bedroom, and he leaned his head back for ease of access. Steve took to unbuttoning the shirt, easily slipping Tony out of it.
Only Tony had the honor of loving it.
"Here, would it be better if we pushed the bench up against one of the mirrors?" Steve offered, a hint of excitement in his voice now.
Perfect moments.
"Tony, are you alright?"
"That's the feeling I got too," Tony replied. "It's why I walked out when I did. You looked like you might want to, standing there and all, but then you turned around and I got this feeling like you wouldn't come back again if I didn't stop you." Silence fell between them for a moment, before Tony finally decided he could ask. "Where's Bucky?" It was innocent. Steve could answer it a number of ways. He could just say not here and Tony would let it drop.
There was one time in a fun house, in the hall of mirrors, the little maze. He’d brought a fling there and.. well, one thing lead to another, he’d been asked not to come back and-
"Is that what you do for a living?" Tony pressed, and Steve offered up a teasing grin.
"So," Tony said quietly. "I take if you're not eating cake tonight?"
It wasn't hard to find Tony. He was a little loud with his footsteps, trying to fight off the panic gripping his chest rather than worrying about being careful or quiet. That suited Steve just fine. He didn't want Tony to hide from him.
"I don't have time for your sass right now, Steve wants me to go out to the bar with him and his best friend," Tony hissed, flailing his arms like a madman. "He just called me and I swear to god he tricked me into it because one second he's asking how my day was and what I'm doing, and I told him nothing honestly and he goes good, then lets go get some drinks with my pal and I had no time at all to come up with a proper excuse and... and..!"
“You already go on the news,” Bucky pointed out. “Don’t think you need Stevie’s art for that. But you’re damn right to wanna buy some, ‘cause it’s beautiful like him.”
"Oh," Steve finally breathed, face a little unreadable for Tony.
"Rhodey," Tony whined as he entered the bathroom, peering under the stalls for those familiar shoes. He leaned up against the door that sheltered Rhodey from his invasion of privacy, palms flat against it as he tried to talk himself out of what he was about to do. "Can you ask Bruce to play the dancey music?"
"Anthony Edward Stark!" This time Tony's head shot up, and he opened his mouth to say something but then pursed his lips tightly. That did it. Steve didn't know what the hell was going on, but he was getting to the bottom of it now. "All this over some stupid little fight last night? You've got to be kidding me. What do you want? I'm sorry, alright? But you're just being childish now. I've been worried sick about you all day. Cling and Natasha searched the whole tower and-"
"To bed," Tony replied simply, shaking Steve's hand free. "You can come if you'd like." It was the least inviting invitation Steve had ever been given, especially by Tony, who would typically drop every hint ever that he wanted Steve in his bed. The soldiers confidence was knocked a little, but he did follow Tony up to bed. He even held him, albeit a bit awkwardly as both of them were still a little stiff from the tension between them.
Steve figured he'd fix things in the morning.
"Yeah?" Quite the opposite of Steve, Tony sounded as though he'd had all the breath sucked out of him.
"Hell naw, he was sober before he met you," Rhodey said firmly. "We're talking about this later, Tones, don't you think you're getting out of-"
"That's a long time to park a car," Rhodey offered gently, putting a hand up on Tony's shoulder. Tony's world was spiraling. If Steve wasn't waiting for Bucky, Bucky wasn't here. Which wasn't right. You can't just get a slice of Red's cake without Bucky, or without Steve. It wasn't- Where was Bucky? What was taking so long?
"Tony, so wonderful to see you, I always love when you practically knock down my door at weird hours. I'm not doing anything right now." To be fair, he really wasn't. Tony could tell by the fact that there was no mess on the table and that he'd answered the door right away.
"You did that because I was going to beat you, right?" Tony asked. "Because you know I was going to. I was just uh.. warming up, is all."
His favorite was the idea that Steve got into one of the art schools he thought about constantly but refused to try for. Bucky had been threatening to send his portfolio in, and while he didn't think Bucky would ever go through with it who knew? Maybe Buck had finally decided that Steve was pining hard enough and he deserved something good. They'd moved off for him to go to college, and they thought fondly about their dates at the diner, but they'd moved on to bigger and better things. Or Bucky finally got a better job, one that didn't demand such long hours and hard labor and they'd gotten them a house with a picket fence. They had a dog, and a cat, because they couldn't decide which between the two of them. Steve painted pictures of them all for the walls. Bucky asleep on the couch with the cat tucked under his arm. The dog in the window. The cat rolling around with a toy. Those pictures were beautiful pieces of life and a family they'd built together, and they would have them for as long as they had those perfect memories.
"We better get to work on that castle, huh?" Steve ignored Tony's groan and suggestive look. Sure the jet was on his mind, too, but he figured they'd get around to that. Something told him this thing with Tony Stark was just beginning. And Steve Rogers was a patient man.
"Brought you more tea," Steve told him, trading the book for the cup on his bedside table. "How's your throat? Better?"
"Because I missed you, Tony, you know I hate being away- Tony, stop yelling, you're going to regret it- And I knew you'd be down here trying to avoid the bedroom because I wasn't there-" Steve wasn't stopping.
He had a bit of a reputation, after all. He could whisper sweet nothings to Steve now but.. well, their first fight, Steve might worry. Nope, he needed a grand gesture. He broke away from the kiss, but not Steve's grip on his hips, to start pondering that when suddenly Tony was the one being caught off guard by a pair of lips.
"So lets be a little later." Steve’s tone was playful, one that Tony absolutely adored. It was such a private tone. Not many knew this side of the super soldier.
"Well then I'm going to need you to go to dinner with me. You know, for science."
"Absolutely gorgeous," Steve whispered in Tony’s ear, reaching his own free hand up to grip Tony’s chin, tilting his head to nip at his neck. "Look at you Tony, god why didn’t you ask for this sooner?"
"Working on something, something important, I don't spend nights on end down here without reason. Not without good, logical, result-producing reason-" Tony wasn't stopping, but he was getting louder.
do anything.” Tony loved to tease them on their occasional slang and accents. Bucky’s was thicker and raw, in a way that Tony honestly felt wasn’t real the first time. Who the fuck had a Brooklyn accent that thick these days, anyway? “Secondly I love art. And one day you’re gonna be big and famous, and I’m gonna be able to go on the news and say, ‘Hey! I know that guy! Look at this cool painting he did for me!’”
There was suddenly a surge of upbeat, electronic music, and Tony's face split into a grin. He didn't care that Rhodes rolled his eyes, or that Clint was snickering. He turned towards Steve, ready for his moment and-
It had been so stupid. Tony was cranky, his latest science-binge was not going well. Dum-E had just poured scalding hot coffee all over Tony's crotch and for some god awful reason one of the speakers wasn't working correctly. The bass sounded way off, and that threw off the ACDC Tony had been trying to enjoy. One of those days where anything that could go wrong, had gone wrong, and now Tony was throwing things.
Steve was sitting back on his heels now, hands on his thighs as he stared down at Tony, drinking the sight in, and Tony was starting to feel paranoid. What was he thinking? It didn't take long to get an answer, because Steve was kissing his fucking chest, and before Tony could protest Steve was biting his nipple and Tony moaned, Tony wriggled, Tony begged. They could take each other apart and draw maps later; for now he just wanted to be properly fucked.
want… Gosh, Steve, I’m gonna say you want to eat
"I told you it would," Steve reminded him as Natasha made her exit. "Seriously? A doctor? Ow- Tony don't pinch me, it's your own fault that I have something to make fun of you for now." He shoved Tony back into a seat and moved to the stove, turning on the kettle and pulling down a mug. "That'll teach you to yell at me, won't it?"
"I guess I forgot to ask you if you wanted to dance with me," Steve admitted, and Tony realized that Steve was pretty sober. There was no slur, and his blush had been just that- only a blush, not a flush from alcohol intake.
Steve's first thought was that he had to apologize. He knew Tony well enough to skip the search and head straight to his workshop. Stark was such a predictable guy, though Steve never once had a complaint about it. It was one of the things he loved about Tony. Even with how off the wall he could be, with the surprises he could manage to toss at Steve, Tony stayed consistent on the important things.
There was something deliciously erotic about the sound of the cap popping off, and Steve easily shimmied out of his boxers and pulled Tony’s down. There was a moment of pure satisfaction, Steve dropping his gaze to admire Tony’s thick, hard cock and silently reminding himself that he’d been the cause of that. The moment passed quickly enough, and Steve helped Tony turn towards the mirror. Tony propped himself on his knees atop the bench, hooking one arm around Steve’s neck as the super soldier gently squeezed Tony’s right thigh. Tony sighed, Steve chuckled, and suddenly there was a slick, slightly chilled finger teasing at Tony. Steve was all too familiar with how to work him open and he wasted no time in getting started.
"Hurts," Tony finally grunted, voice a thin rasp and once more Natasha's eyes were rolling. Oh boy. This was the last time she was helping Steve find Tony.
"Stevie, I think I'm glad this guy ain't your boyfriend because-" Bucky started and Steve threw his hands up. Could he put his foot further into his mouth?
"I'll send you one- least I can do for all the break ins."
"Steven Rogers get down here and kiss me now," Tony demanded, and Steve complied. He kissed Tony until they were both breathless, and then finally blessed them with faster, harder thrusts like before. Tony was a mess of wanton moans and misguided demands. Harder? Steve was already railing into him at that point. Tony was saying words just to say them, because if he didn't he might forget how to speak.
"Fuck you," Tony said, and eyes lit up as he realized how clear the words came. Throat still protested slightly but that was alright! He was much better now! Now Tony was the one with the smug grin, and he sat up in a rush. "Hah! So take that Capsicle, I'm fine now. What was all the smug shit talk earlier?"
"Tony it is," Steve replied, offering his hand. "Steve Rogers. Gonna tell me about the E or should I just guess?"
"Now that that parts over with, why don't we do a-" Bucky paused, obviously catching himself. "High five. We should do a high five." Since he'd probably made Tony uncomfortable with the almost-shot-offer, he promptly held up his prostetic arm, and Tony struggled to keep a straight face as he took the man up on the offer.
Neither of them was stopping.
The door opened with all the grace you could expect from a diner door; the bell chimed loudly from the force of him pressing his body into it, like if Tony was a second later he'd wind up missing Steve even though he was moving one step at a time. "Steve!" he called out, and watched the man freeze in his place and lift his shoulders. He didn't turn for a moment, and Tony left the safety of the door to come up and get in front of him, looking at that face. There was nothing good there. The usual spark to his eyes wasn't there. His hair wasn't styled the way it usually was, the shadow of facial hair he'd been able to note from inside under the dull light of the street lamp and the diner's sign was much less sculpted than he had thought. It wasn't thick- a light smattering that said he'd given up on it a few days ago.
"I want to fuck you," Steve breathed, leaning in to press their lips together, tongue sliding into Tony's mouth long enough to taste before he pulled his face back again. "I've wanted to for weeks, and now that I'm here.. Fuck, Tony, this is just how I want you."
, but he could see the glint in Domitus’ eye when he talked about it. Tony was
"Steve?" Tony gasped, body beginning to tense. Steve nodded, picking up the pace.
"Welcome to casa de Stark," he said, leading Steve into the apartment and looking anxiously at his reaction. Tony's place wasn't exactly fancy, but it had a very modern feel to it. Most of his expensive stuff was stored in his vacation home. This was where he liked to relax, not to show off. Usually, he didn't care what his dates thought of the decor, but as he turned to press his lips to Steve's again, he was very pleased to see the appreciative look on his face.
Tony pulled back, and this time he was red for a different reason. He'd never really.. talked about this with Steve. He didn't exactly bring it up a lot. "I uh.. I wasn't always a vacuum inventor," he admitted softly. "My dad's company- when it was his company- made weapons. I wanted a piece of the action, or rather the money, so I was a part of it. While demonstrating some new stuff out of the states, the unit I was with was attacked. Rhodey barely got me out of there alive, but I got pretty messed up in the process. Didn't quite have it in me to make weapons after that."
"Forgot you- well it's been put to good use for this month at the very least." This got a laugh, and silence fell for a short period while both drank.
So maybe this was a bit of a big deal. Maybe he was hoping that this was more than just hanging out with the friends. He wanted this to be meeting the friends. The big introduction. Honestly, that was why he wanted Rhodey and Clint to tag along. He had been toying with the idea of asking Steve on a date for a while, and if he did he wanted to get this part over with quick and easy.
Hey 5B!
"I like to watch myself get fucked." Tony blurted it out anyway.
"I’m fine," Tony reassured him. "Just got swept up in my thoughts."
"Hey Tony." There was something thick about Steve's tone, and the small smile he offered wasn't like any Tony had ever seen on his face. Dread filled the pit of his stomach, but he didn't know how to ask. Something awful had happened, he was sure of that. But Tony didn't know what. He couldn't imagine a horrible break up, but for a moment he contemplated if he should give that praying thing a shot. The alternatives were awful.
laugh for Bucky. Bucky, who looked like he probably could have had a resting bitch face for the history books, gazing at Steve with the softest smile on his lips (and just a little bit of icing that Tony was
"Tony." This time Steve's tone was gentle. He was sure he'd figure this out easy enough. "Do you want to talk about it, or do you want to talk about technology?"
For a moment Steve was quiet, leaning in to kiss Tony.
He probably could.
"Oh I am," Steve assured him.
Everything was fine until Steve had his hand down his pants and Tony caught sight of his eyes reflected, and then he was moaning and leaning forward to ground himself against the mirror. Steve paused, and in the glass Tony could see Steve eyeing him curiously. Tony’s cheeks burned, trying to think of how to explain this one. Steve was trying, very admirably, to adjust to Tony’s kinks. Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for this one.
"That's not even a little surprising," Tony said with a grin. Steve looked almost like a kicked puppy, and so Tony quickly held up a hand. "Not a bad lack of surprise, don't worry. There's like this whole retro vibe going here, and then the art everywhere. I don't know, it just makes sense to me. Huh. Never thought to check out our art museum. You give tours?" Steve's nod earned a bright smile. "Well then I guess I'll have to swing on by and take a look."
going to be a man in the robotics industry, but the diner was his second love. He was invested. At twenty two years old, Tony Stark had personally paid for a visual update and become part owner of a business that he’d once thought of as a way to pass the time and maybe meet some folks. Tony realized that, despite it being
He stood suddenly. "I've got to.. uh.. I'll be back." Yep. He had something very, very important to do. Something that couldn't wait. Something-
Clint rolled his eyes, already abandoning the argument.
When Tony Stark was eighteen, he could have left Red’s. He could have left sooner than that, really, but he liked making himself available for shifts during the holiday season to help out. And if he made absolutely positive that he always had hours on the day that Steve and Bucky were meant to come in for their cake, Rhodey was the only one to call him out on it. Once. Tony had put so much salt in his apple pie afterwards the Rhodes solemnly swore to never comment on it again (and Domitus MacKinnon, trying not to cackle, had warned him about ever ruining a perfectly good slice of pie again). He couldn’t exactly pick a favorite interaction with the two, but Tony
"Brucie!" Tony cried as he walked through the door, putting on his very, very best innocent face as the man stood with his arms folded beside his traitorous friends. "Don't tell me the kids went running to daddy the second they got here? I'm hurt. They don't trust me."
For a moment they were apart, catching their breath, and Steve was staring at Tony so intensley that the man actually blushed. And what the fuck was with that? Blushing? Was this college?
"You made me stomp around and holler up here for 2 hours last week so you could play hideout in his apartment," Clint pointed out, nearly earning a punch to the shoulder. He was a bit quicker than Tony, though, so the inventor was left with a miss and a pout. "Well, I'm in. Lets go to the bar and see you fawn over him in person."
Tony shivered at this, and then he dove into Steve’s lips. Tongue forced it’s way in, his hands torn between tangling in Steve’s smooth blonde hair and groping his ass. It took the genius a full thirty seconds to realize he could do both, and by then it was too late. Steve had shoved him down to the bench and with that impressive strength of his shoved the furniture and it’s burden easily up against one of the floor-to-ceiling mirrors. The look in his blue eyes was enough to make Tony groan, reaching up to yank him forward by the back of his neck. Steve accepted the movement, biting at Tony’s bottom lip, before breaking apart once more.
Tony honestly could have done it forever. He’d already gone into talks with the MacKinnon’s about how one day he’d really like to partner with them, provide some security to the diner, make sure it was always a staple in their city. The bakery wasn’t happening,
"A. E. Stark I presume?" Steve offered, shutting the door behind him.
It didn’t take long for Steve to get back, but when he returned to the dresser he had this.. look on his face. Like something was wrong. Like.. Oh god, Tony had pushed him into this hadn’t he?
The super soldier's shoulders began to shake with silent laughter, before he was outright chuckling, and while Natasha fixed him with a quirked brow Tony only ducked his head and tried to flee.
"You'd better be the guy who lives here or I am so calling the cops," the serial-break-in told him, and Steve fixed him with a very stern glare. He was aboslutely NOT fighting off laughter.
Steve was actually a little more aggressive than Tony would have anticipated. Not that Tony was upset about that- he was all about Mr. Big and Muscular tossing him around the bedroom. But the thing was, they weren't in a bedroom, and that right there was why it struck him as surprising. He hadn't taken Steve for staking his claim in public, but there was a tongue shoving past Tony's lips and fuck yes, fuuuck yes he was all about this.
"Sorry, he just got here," Steve noted. "I would have called off the search but I was a little preoccupied. Apparently Tony is much more interested in this pop-"
"There's no pressure for this," Steve said firmly, reaching up to cup Tony's cheek, searching his eyes. "I know that everyone has been.. pushy.. I want you to want this because you already did, not because they talked you into-"
There was a moment of awkward silence as Bruce and Thor found their own reasons to disperse, and then Tony was clearing his throat.
“Where’s Adrian?” Bucky growled, playful and smooth. “I tell Stevie every year I’m not gonna put up with your shit, punk, and then every year you get away with it.”
Tony went first. The view was enough to finally send Steve over the edge.
The water came to a boil and a few minutes later Steve was setting a piping hot cup in front of Tony. For a moment they just stared at each other, Tony trying to look angry and Steve unable to drop the goofy grin from his lips. Then he was leaning in to capture Tony's, kiss sweet and apologetic. As much as he was enjoying this he hated to see the man in any sort of agony. Finally he broke away and gestured to the tea.
As Tony opened his mouth to go on Steve brought their lips together, tugging Tony into his lap. There was a momentary struggle before Tony huffed and relaxed, and as they broke away the genius didn't even have it in him to glare. Steve pressed a hand to Tony's cheek, gently tracing the right corner of his bottom lip.
Tony Stark was sixteen years old when he met Bucky and Steve.
"So the first time I was willing to overlook it," Tony said casually. "But if you're going to make a habit of this kissing thing-"
"Weren’t you just complaining about being late?" Steve pointed out. "We’ll be even more late if we have to pick out new clothes because these are wrinkled."
Cue Steve. Big, dumb, beautiful, wonderful- okay, no, just Steve. He'd been away on some super special secret mission with Natasha and honestly all he wanted to do was drag Tony to bed. What happened once they got to the bed was honestly free to the imagination. Point is, he was tired and a little sore, pent up from a few nights on his own, and overall not thinking when he entered the lab and actually turned off the music.
"Isn't there one called Hydra?" Plan b was of course to try and push Steve away. The super soldier was a little too sturdy for that.
"Go handle that," Steve said with a grin. "Nice to meet you, Tony. Next time you break in you owe me dinner." It was bold, maybe too bold, but the winning smile that Tony sent back was enough to leave him breathless.
Soon enough the teams were set. Natasha led the opposing force, with Bruce and Clint on her side. Thor, Tony, and Steve stood against them. It was one hell of a game. Tony was a little useless, but that was why Steve had picked Thor. The highlight, however, was when Tony spiked the ball at Steve who in turn sent it rocketing up with some impressive speed, and Thor met it to send it sailing over the net and down into the sand. That was the game point.
Steve was pretty sure he wouldn’t be able to look at a mirror the same for at least a week.
"Yeah well..." Tony paused, realizing that it would be strange to tell Steve that he specifically came in on this night to see if Steve and Bucky would come through. Three years was a strange amount of time to fixate on people who he didn't know outside of his job. His old job. "You know, busy time of year. I'm part owner, it's only right that I show up when they call."
"Want a beer while you wait?" he offered, headed for the fridge. Tony just nodded and soon they were seated in the kitchen chairs each holding a cold Budweiser.
Tony Stark doesn't have to hope that Steve and Bucky come back, but he does anyway.
Steve was obviously trying not to laugh at him, and honestly Tony adored him for it. "Well, this is Bucky." Okay, man bun had a surprisingly non-threatening name. "Natasha." Yep, looked like a Natasha. "And Sam."
"Steve, baby, we really don’t have to-" Tony attempted.
Instead Steve took a long breath, dragging his hands onto the table and touching the ring that Tony hadn't gotten a good look at yet. It was simple, exactly like Tony would expect. A silver band, but in the light he could see a streak of gold that seemingly ran through the center all the way around. It was hard not to stare.
"If that's all," Tony replied, voice much stronger now that he had his wits about him.
Steve shook his head, tried to crack a smile and failed. "I wanted to be here tonight," he admitted, and Tony didn't dare interrupt. "I wanted to be here a lot of nights. I wanted things to feel normal. Everyone keeps telling me that I have to just do things to feel... But I don't think I would have come in if you hadn't come outside."
Steve was yanking him up by the hand, pulling a very, very stunned Tony towards the floor with a flushed, determined face. It was fucking adorable, if Tony was being honest. Adorableness aside, he'd kind of just stolen Tony's thunder, and a glance back at the table found the entire group shaking with held back laughter. Assholes.
"I still say you kicked that sand in my eye on purpose, so I think we're even," Tony replied.
"I thought this was supposed to be a fun day at the beach," Tony complained.
"Well that’s the main purpose for it," Tony grumbled, trying to shove some of his excitement over all of this down. His dick was definitely hard, and that was all the excitement he really needed. "But I used to use it for.. well, other things."
slices of the cake. Yeah?”
To the water he went, and within minutes he had returned to begin his work a few feet away from Steve. He was considering the possibility of how to make a working draw bridge, and wondered momentarily if Steve would call it cheating if he got some... accessories from the jet. Probably. Fine, good old fashioned sand castle couldn't be too hard. Look at all the suits he'd built! A little bit of sand was cake.
Steve flushed momentarily, but crossed his arms.
Tony hesitated, but cleared his throat and decided to give it a try.
"Sorry, I'm with you, sourpatch," Tony said by way of the worst apology ever, but Rhodey slapped his arm and Tony gave him an offended look. What? What could possibly be wrong with his usual half-assed apology?
Finally he found him. Tony was sitting on a stump breathing as carefully as he could. Steve wasn't sure what was wrong but he was determined to find out.
"Pepperoni is fine," Steve cut in, dropping his keys on the table and trying not to offer a fond smile. He wasn't fond. Break in, remember? Seriously, Steve, priorities. "Is this gonna be a habit Tony?" He tried, absolutely battled, to keep his voice stern but even he knew that there was a sparkle to his eyes, and he was pretty damn sure Tony took note of it as the man stared at him. Within seconds they were both laughing, and Steve was plopping down on the couch and grabbing a slice from the box on the coffee table.
"Do you have an incredible tolerance or something?" Tony asked, quirking a brow.
"If it helps, you're first pick for my team," Steve offered with a teasing smile.
"Who?" Right, Tony, because Rhodey can't see through that falsely innocent tone. Sometimes it was easier to pretend that Rhodes wasn't nearly as smart as he was, or that he didn't know Tony better than Tony knew himself. "I'm just tired, the door was there, must've faded off somewhere for a minute. I'm not expecting anyone sugar bear."
"What were you thinking about?" Steve had stood at this point and wandered over, wrapping his hands around Tony’s hips and pressing up against his back. Steve left a lazy trail of kisses along the brunette’s ear.
It was just as well, it was about time they talked.
"You… you want to-?" Tony was pretty sure that’s what Steve was going for.
"You know no one ever believes me when I tell them its your fault." Tony was trying to be good about this. This was a fairly important get together. Something about money, and donations, he was sure of it. "They always just roll their eyes."
"Rhodey help me," Tony said the moment his neighbor opened the door. Rhodes stared at him for a moment, before waving his arms and rolling his eyes.
to you, who cooked from the heart and who’s adorable young husband had really brought perfection to the baked goods here. Tony was banking on them opening a secondary spot, a bakery, one day and he would honestly fund it if Domitus MacKinnon would just promise him free dessert for life.
"Tony!" Steve called, smile splitting even wider if possible as he followed the gaze of the pair. Luckily, Tony felt Rhodey, Clint, and Bruce at his back, so he didn't end up rushing out of the bar as though his life depended on it. Instead he walked over, happy to accept the pat on the back from that familiar stocky blonde as the two groups merged.
“He sure does,” Tony replied, cocking his hip off to the side and letting his hand rest on it. “Take it that’s what you want? Coffee to go with? Milk?” Tony was a big fan of that cake himself, though the way Bucky lit up when he confirmed it was available, you’d have thought it was the best cake in the whole damn world.
"So, Tony." Bucky had his arm slung over tony's shoulders now as they walked towards the table, and Tony did his best to keep that calm, collected smile on his face. He wasn't nervous, not even slightly. Why should he be.
"I'll help you build a better sandcastle." There was something playful in Steve's tone, and Tony waited. But he didn't offer anything more.
Tony took a moment to glance over at Steve, who seemed to be locked in deep conversation with Clint. Briefly the man wondered if his friends were giving Steve a similar talk. Suddenly Tony wished he could have a shot. The more he thought about it, the more and more he wanted to try things with Steve. This was the perfect setting to make a move. Everyone seemed to agree that they were trying to start something. What if he just...
Steve couldn't stop the grin from spreading to his lips.
It was time to be cool and collected. Out of the car he got, glancing at his watch. Ten was a little late to hit the bar, but it was probably a good thing in the long run. Less time to be around that sweet, seductive bitch known as alcohol. A quick scan of the parking lot told him that Rhodey and Clint were here, and better yet..
“They’re gonna be the same size Buck.” That was Steve, and his eye roll seemed to have been perfected and doused with affection over what Tony could only assume was perfected through the course of a
"I mean I've done some updates," Tony admitted. "But if you think ol' Adrian'd ever let me change the place enough that it was something brand new, you weren't paying attention all the times you've been here." Quiet fell between them, comfortable and yet so strained. Tony wanted to ask questions. Steve looked like maybe he wanted to talk, but didn't know how. That was fine. There was nothing that Adrian's cooking couldn't solve, right? "Please come inside Steve," Tony suggested quietly. "It's been a while. I've been practicing how to be piss poor at serving, you'll love the attitude. It's perfected, I swear. The MacKinnon's would be pissed if I closed up before I let a customer in."
"And I say that after the latest news about ride breakdowns everywhere, it's not worth the work of breaking out a disguise," Steve replied, slinging his arm over those familiar shoulders. Tony was tense. He just needed to lighten up a little!
"He's... waiting for Bucky," Tony suggested. "Buck's parking the car." It wasn't like Rhodey had asked, or like Rhodey really cared to ask (not that Rhodes didn't care about their customers, but he wasn't as attached to these two as Tony tried not to be) and they both knew that Tony was saying it out loud for himself. He waited a solid minute, just staring ahead at Steve even as the man continued to look down the street, stock still.
He fell silent, suddenly listening to shouts from upstairs. Steve listened, too. It was definitely a feminine voice, and the stomping sounded like heels. Steve fixed Tony with a wary look. Tony rewarded him with a nervous smile. After a moment of thought Steve sighed and shrugged.
"Seriously, fuck yeah," Tony repeated, and Steve's reply was a testing thrust. Tony grunted, wanting to lift up and draw Steve down, but this positioning was definitely good. Steve had just the right angle, and as his thrusts began to pick up in pace all Tony could do was take it. His hips were rocking with Steve's momentum, and the sounds Tony was making were probably enough to wake the neighbors. Good thing the neighbors were out at the bar.
P. S. I would really love if you didn't call the police.
"They're still beautiful," Steve told him firmly. "You're just looking at them the wrong way now. Look, Tony, that cluster there." Steve pointed one finger up to the sky, and watched as Tony hesitantly followed it's direction. "See, the little dipper. When you look at that-"
Steve knew he should probably leave well enough alone, but come on, how often did he have a chance to tease a silent Tony?
Steve switched on the light and deposited Tony on the chair, moving to unbutton his own shirt. Tony huffed and made grabby hands, but Steve just chuckled.
know he didn’t want to miss out on any just because of something silly like.. Preparing to take over a multi-million dollar company. Who had time for that?
“I like to use my hands.”
The closet was more like it’s own room, of course. Tony had a lot of clothes. A lot of shoes. A lot of ties, and non-mechanized suits, and basically just a lot of things in general. Steve’s favorite part of the closet was Tony’s silk collection. Steve had his own personal kinks too, after all.
For a moment the room was quiet, Tony giving Steve a moment to collect himself. He couldn't imagine what it was like, couldn't begin to grasp it, and didn't want to say he did. In fact, he was pretty sure this was where he was supposed to leave.
"Tony." Steve's voice was a bit thicker than before, and Tony finally met his eyes. Well he was a little closer.
Tony gave an exasperated huff.
"Broke in?" Nat was all ears at that, fixing Steve with a stern look. "And you just decided to make friends? I knew the security here was crap but-"
"If," Steve confirmed. "If you let me kiss you again."
"Busy yelling over nothing?" Steve countered playfully, hoping to ease Tony into a better mood with that winning smile of his. The way Tony's eyes flickered told him no, no that was not the case.
Nearly an hour later, and Tony was getting antsy. He'd gathered the group back together, and everyone seemed to get on just fine. Clint and Natasha were swapping stories, Rhodey was discussing the armed forces with Steve, Bucky, and Sam, and Tony.. well Tony was watching and enjoying. There had been the occasional drink offer, but Tony had been on this sobriety kick for a while now. As much as he had wanted to say yes to each, he was at a comfortable point where he knew when and how to say no. Now was a good time for that, not only because he had a group of friends ready to jump him upon sight of a glass in his hand, but because if he wanted this thing with Steve to work he couldn't have a glass of liquid courage to spurr him on. As rare of a thing as it might be, Tony Stark wanted to be sober when he finally fell into bed with a gorgeous blonde man.
"Better neighbors in this sort of place," Tony replied with a shrug. "Like, my next door neighbor, Rhodes. He's some big shot in the military. And when he comes home he always brings me souveniers from wherever he's been. And Clint, on the other side, he's got hearing problems so I can blare my music most days and not bother either of them. Which is good, because I work best when I can't hear myself thinking."
"Absolutely." And maybe it was too quick of a response but fuck it. Steve was completely enthralled with Tony. He didn't need to hesitate to agree to spend more time with him. Who cared if Tony slept around and broke into his apartment all the time? He was great company.
- A. E. Stark
"Huh. Forgot I had that subscription."
They both paused, Steve pulling back slightly to search Tony’s eyes. They hadn’t dropped that line yet. Tony hadn’t meant to do it now- though he had been intending to do it sooner rather than later- but now that cat was out of the bag and Tony just flat out stared waiting for some sort of response.
"Steve, looks like Stark went to see a doct-" Natasha entered the kitchen, only to find that Tony was here. "Oh, good. You found him. Thanks for calling off the search."
"Are you five?" Tony wanted to know as he jogged over, crouching down next to Steve to admire his work. It was a pretty sad castle, actually. Tony didn't say that though.
"It's really worth it," Steve assured him, and Tony laughed at the enthusiasm. Steve would later insist that was absolutely not a blush on his cheeks, and Tony would only bring it up twice.
It was not cake.
For Steve Rogers, Tony Stark shone just as brightly as any of those little balls of gas. For Tony Stark, Steve Rogers outshone the sun.
"Lets get out of here," Tony suggested, and was met with an enthusiastic nod. Tony chuckled and leaned in for one more kiss, just as Steve threw his arm around Tony's shoulder. Bruce knew he was good for the tab, so Tony didn't head for the bar first. Instead, he and Steve found their way out to the parkinglot and to Tony's car. There was a moment of silence, Tony staring up at Steve as the blonde stared down at him, and before Tony could ask-
"Who says you get to be team captain?" Tony fired back, prodding him in the chest with one finger.
"Rogers what do you think you're doing?" Natasha demanded. "After all that coaching you're just giving in?"
"Tony?" Steve's voice was full of worry as Tony shot up from his seat and abruptly walked away from the group. Looks were exchanged around the fire. Steve didn't wait for anyone else to volunteer; he'd find out what was wrong with the man.
Quiet stretched for a bit longer. Steve usually didn't mind- living alone meant it was usually quiet. Noise was saved for the weekends when he got to gether with his pals. What was he supposed to say, though? Should he try to get to know his neighbor or should he just let him go on his way?
Now the question was, how did Tony say that?
"For me to be able to yell at you again?" Tony replied. "Well you're a little strange with your kinks, I'll give you that-"
"You mean to tell me you lost Tony?" Clint asked as Steve explained the majority of it- leaving the details of their fight out for the moment- and Steve didn't miss the light in Barton's eyes. "This is priceless. How's it feel to be in the doghouse?"
"Stevie, it's so good to see ya," Bucky offered with a broad grin, stepping inside and glancing around. It was so much less depressing in here than the last time he'd been around. "You cleaned the palce up! And it looks like you're back to doing art?" He recognized the style in a few of the things hanging along the walls. Steve just shrugged, not wanting to get into the reason why.
There was just something about mirrors. It had started out innocent, of course. Simple fascination with his reflection as a child. Who was that staring back at him? Oh, right, that was him. Tony spent hours at a time making faces at mirrors, trying to view himself at different angles. Setting mirrors up around one another in order to create infinite reflections. It was all in good fun.
"Steven, you're really killing my boner right now," Tony told him firmly. "Of course I want to. If you're having second thoughts, though, you can head right back inside. I won't be upset, I'll still hide in your apartment whenever I want to."
The third wasn't quite so menacing, probably because he was the one making Steve laugh. But that dude with the man bun and the red head under his arm had locked eyes with Tony the second they saw him staring, and Tony knew that they knew that he knew that he was completely, totally, irrevocably fucked.
"Oh yeah? Are you gonna show me how to build a proper sand castle? Can you even build things without a wrench and a torch?"
"It's not nothing, I have scalding hot coffee all over my pants now, an experiment that wants to fight me every step of the way, malfunctioning hardware-"
"I love you too, Cap," Tony replied after a moment, leaning in to rest his head on his shoulder. "I guess I'm kind of sorry too. For uh... yelling louder than you did. Or something." He could feel Steve's chest rumbling with quiet laughter, and he flicked him. "Hey, I'm trying to be genuine here."
"That would be me," Steve assured him, and the guy visibly deflated.
Tony was touched. Honestly. It wasn't like Steve had known- Tony had given him no indication that he was recovering. It was moments like these that Tony found himself truly thankful that he'd had a crazy one night stand waiting for him that first night he'd broken into Steve's apartment. It had been the best decision he'd ever made, and hello, he'd invented something.
"This morning. Nat and I took a power nap and figured we'd stop over to grab you and hit a bar. Sam said he's down. And he said that maybe you'd bring your boyfriend along? Why didn't you tell me you were seeing anyone?"
It went without saying that they were gorgeous, but there was more to Tony’s instant admiration of them. There was such a softness to their interactions, something that Tony had never seen in all his life. His parents loved each other, sure. He and Howard might not always see eye to eye (they nearly never did, actually. Don’t get him started on the fight that broke out when Howard learned he was wait staff at a diner.) but he never doubted that his father loved his mother, and Maria was enamored with him despite his many, many character flaws. Tony might not understand it, but he’d always respected it. And so he’d grown up thinking that was the goal- for people to
he’d been safe guarding it all night? Blasphemy, Pep, honestly.) and offering them both that usual charming smile.
Tony was ready to argue, but Steve was dragging him by the wrist over to the net. Tony wasn't sure he minded as much as he wanted to. Did this count as holding hands?
For Steve Rogers, the stars were a beautiful thing. For Tony Stark, the stars were.. not so bad.
Tony wandered back out to find Steve staring at the spot where Bucky would usually sit. It was difficult to watch. The entire thing was hard, and Tony wasn't even the one who had theoretically lost someone. Steve had his hands on the menu, but it was closed, and Tony hummed before making up his mind. He walked over and sat down on the edge of the seat next to Steve, startling him and bumping him with his hip until he got the message and moved over. Steve didn't smile, but he looked a little less lost, and Tony would take that.
And they kissed. God, they kissed. Tony felt Steve's lips press against his own chapped, waiting ones and his fingers slid up the back of Steve's neck to tangle in his hair. Steve encouraged this, though his hands moved down rather than skyward and Tony was pleasantly surprised to learn that Steve was an ass man. The beach seemed suddenly very empty, and Tony was very aware of just how many steps it would take to get the jet where they could have a little privacy. He was factoring in how many of those steps he could bear to spend parted from Steve's lips when suddenly Steve was pulling away for air.
"Nah, but I think I'm gonna start staying in your apartment for a whole new reason," Tony replied. Steve's answering kiss was the reason they had breakfast cold.
Finally both Steve and Tony were back under control. Tony met Steve's eyes once more, goofy grin now absolutely refusing to fade away.
Steve hadn't really thought about the fact that the key had turned easier than usual in the handle, and as he opened the door he found himself chest to chest with just the man who'd been running in and out of his thoughts. And, you know, apparently his apartment.
"Brucie baby, please!" Tony cried, reaching out to take the man by the face, searching his eyes for some sort of understanding. "Steve is an adonis and if everyone wants to see my actually put the moves on, I need to do it right, and I need to make this something that's worth telling people when they ask how we got together!"
Tell Stark to quit getting pretty and get here - N.
Things became a lot more intense when Tony Stark reached adulthood.
He pushed past Steve, leaving the soldier actually a little startled. Tony usually gave in to that look. When the genius didn't stop at the door, Steve followed him, reaching out for his arm.
"Hey, man, thanks for not calling the cops. You know, any of those times." Tony sounded so sincere, and Steve had to wonder if the guy had ever gotten in trouble for this. "I try not to make a habit of it. But.. sometimes people just don't like to take no for an an-"
"I don't know, I didn't get a menu," Steve replied. Tony rolled his eyes and handed one over. "Good to see the service is still terrible. You're lucky the MacKinnon's are too nice to fire you."
He’d never forget their first conversation. He’d never forget any of them, he was convinced, but it had been such a nice moment.
"Tony," Steve tried.
Spoil sport.
"I won't be hanging out that much," Bruce admitted. "I own the place. Got some work to do. But there's a couple free beers with your names on them tonight." He shot a pointed, warning look at Tony, before heading back to his office to finish up some work on the books.
"Well I just figured this is the kinda thing you're supposed to do at the beach, right?" Steve countered.
Steve didn't let him keep going. He closed the distance between them, tugging Tony into his embrace, and kiss him hard. He would have lifted him onto the counter if there weren't two plates of steaming food in the space he would have used. As he broke free, all he could do was offer Tony a stupid smile.
Part of him wanted to call the police immediately. He had proof right here. A note! Handwriting, finger prints. So how he ended up knocking on 6E's door minutes later was something Steve often looked back on and wondered about. What had he been thinking? There he was, clutching the note which he'd found taped to his door as if this was the most logical thing for him to do.
For Tony Stark, the stars were a billion small nightmares.
"Yeah, and Dum-E should be given sharp objects," Tony grumbled, before sitting up once more. "What's for dinner? It's Clint's night to-" He froze. "Oh.. oh no, you didn't tell them, did you?"
"Steve, fuck, Steve," Tony gasped. "Didn’t- god didn’t think you’d- fuck you really like this don’t you?" It took a bit of grunting to get out, but Steve’s answering thrust was enough to confirm.
"Maybe another night," Tony suggested instead, and Steve grinned.
That wasn't the end of the shenanigans for the day. There was lunch, which was pretty uneventful. Everyone had worked up an appetite. Natasha took the opportunity to lay in the sun while Clint went to climb on submerged rocks down the beach, and Bruce explained Earth's sea creatures to Thor. Tony was about to flop down for a nap and some needed sun when he caught sight of Steve.. building a sand castle.
Before Tony could even argue, Rhodey held up a finger. "And I'm gonna make sure that you tell Steve you're not drinking, and if I catch you with a drink I'm calling Pepper, who's gonna send Happy, who's gonna manhandle you out of the bar right in front of Steve, and you're gonna look-"
Tony didn't notice the way Steve watched him bend over, but that was alright because Steve didn't seem to notice when Tony returned the favor moments later. Tony did notice when Steve started to pull his shirt off, and guess who didn't bother pretending he wasn't watching? That's right, Tony Stark.
His stomach curled. He didn't want a slice of that damn cake. Don't get him wrong, it was delicious. Adrian really did know how to make the perfect Irish Cream Cake you'd ever sink your teeth into, had it down to a science even. Tony could build and tinker and science his way through a lot in life, but you put him in front of the oven with Adrian while the man gave him in depth step by step instructions and there was always some sort of disaster to follow. He didn't understand it. He'd tried after the second year that Steve and Bucky had come in to give them a slice of his own, and he could still remember the exaggerated face Bucky'd made when he took a bite.
"It's my fault." God bless Steve for trying to defend him, honestly. "I didn't realize, I offered. It's been a while, though! Maybe he wasn't-"
"Slow down," Tony said, tugging Steve back a bit using the man's grip on his wrist. Steve looked worried, like maybe Tony was going to deny him a dance, and all the brunette could do was smile. Steve would worry about something so ridiculous. "I'd rather walk with you than have Bruce worry that you're dragging me outback to beat my ass for making a move." He nodded towards the door, where Bruce was chatting with one of the bouncers.
favorite waitress, not some punk kid who just bordered on being too sharply dressed for this sort of restaurant.
"Listen it sounds horrible I know," Steve cut in, not wanting a lecture. "But he fixed my door handle after that, got me a better lock, and started coming here to escape his one night stands when they-"
"Sure, but I mean.. you're not even doing it right." There was something Tony's tone that made Steve smile, and the Captain looked up at him.
Gradually Tony began to relax, began to join in. He laughed here and there, pointing out different clusters. He swore one looked like Dum-E, and promptly decided he was going to tell the bot about it. Steve showed Tony his favorites, and promised to show him his art books.
There was an awkward moment where Tony met Steve's eyes and looked like he wanted to say something, but then he just... walked past him. Was he seriously still upset with him over last night? Not even a hello? That was just about that, and he followed Tony into the kitchen as the billionaire opened his freezer and pulled out a firecracker. Stark had insisted the freezer stay stocked with the red, white, and blue popsicles as a joke at first, and it had apparently stuck. Steve's mood soured even further as Tony took to eating the snack but still wouldn't say anything to him.
me, Steven?” Tony asked, placing a hand over his chest in mock astonishment. “First of all, I know I don’t
"I have no idea what you’re talking about," Steve replied with a playful wink, and ducked out the door as Tony shouted curses after him.
Just as he was about to release his hold on the current tower, catastrophe struck. Another collapsed. Tony made a pitiful sound.
He glanced back at their friends, who all seemed to be pretty interested in their table. Had they been watching them? Not the whole time, he was sure, but probably checking in every once in a while. Good. That meant they could sneak away without any unnecessary comments or knowing smiles or more shovel talks. Good, good, good. Eyes were back on Steve, and he took him in for a moment. Flushed, but obviously thrilled with himself. Well kissed lips, and a shine to his eyes that told Tony he had all the same thoughts that Tony did. At least, he hoped that's what that look meant.
For Steve Rogers, the stars were a distraction.
"Am I allowed to ask why you're not now?" Tony obviously didn't want to pry. But Steve hoped he was just as invested in getting to know him as he was with Tony.
Steve had come up with the idea at the team's last post-mission meal. The winter had been kind of a long pain in the butt. Spring had been one of the colder ones, too, which didn't make matters any better. Everyone was tired, they always looked so tired lately, but it hadn't hit Steve until the Summer weather rolled in how pale they all were. He was the Captain of this team and it was his job to keep his soldiers in fighting form. As hard as they'd all been working lately, he decided it was time for a day off.
"I've been waiting all day for this," Steve admitted.
Sure enough they did, heading out to take a quick shower and slip back into their suits. As they reached the front door Tony shot back up to their room for his watch, and when he returned to Steve’s side minutes later, the super soldier was shaking with silent laughter.
Tony never realized how often he associated them with the word
Some nights back in his time, during the war, he would look up at them and imagine he was a million miles away. For a few minutes he was free of the stress and the concerns he had about what tomorrow might bring. He loved to sketch the stars, constellations, create his own and morph them into beautiful pieces. He didn't get to start doing that until after he emerged from the ice, but now he spent whatever time he could really appreciating that he was alive to see those stars still. There was something about them that made him feel secure.
"I may have had a beer or two at Steve's place!" Tony admitted.
"I need dance music," Tony announced as he opened the door.
And quite literally, he did.
He was supposed to be honest with Steve. Pepper said. Happy said. Rhodey said. Steve said. Literally everyone, okay. Steve was going to accept him, or he was going to work around it. But he and Steve had to be open and honest with each other. Steve was doing a good job at it. Tony wasn’t sure this was what they all meant- maybe blurting things out like this wasn’t the best method- but it was too late to take it back.
It’d worked. There was no reason why the Diner wouldn’t work, too.
of practice. “And if they weren’t, then
http://snark-naked.tumblr.com/
Steve stopped, thinking hard. Doctors? For what? And the popsicle...
"Because Steve asked you to do something and you would have gone to the inside of an active volcano if it meant spending extra time with him," Clint finished with a roll of his eyes.
He was sure to have a sore throat again by the time dinner was through.
"Tony, come on, you're being unreasonable-" Steve tried. Really, he tried here.
"You want in, Clint? You could help me come up with games," Tony offered, and though he wasn't derailed from his train of thought he did pick up a few of the folding chairs.
"Well, some have been more of a problem than others," Tony admitted. "The ones that stay late.. they're the problem. Hell, one guy? He stayed til like. Two in the morning. Rhodes came out and threatened to 'shove this medal of honor up your ass if you want something there that bad'." He was grinning now, and added, "Looking back, it's hilarious, but at the time I was practically groveling to poor Rhodes and apologizing as much as I could."
"Was that even legal?" Clint wanted to know, inspecting the ball and finding it had begun to deflate. Apparently Thor had hit it a little too hard.
"Turn around, Tony," Steve insisted. His voice was thick now, and Tony shivered. Oh god, yes.
"Well why’d you turn around?" Steve asked, and there was that tone bordering on downright seductive and still somewhat playful. Tony was shocked into silence.
"U-uh.." Tony wasn’t sure how to handle this one. He licked at his top lip, hesitating. "It’s not like- it’s not like I have a set up in my closet for-"
And so it went on this way for months. Steve started seeing Tony outside of his apartment, too, which was a nice turn of events. They'd been to a lot of movies. It was probably Tony's favorite thing to educate Steve on. Not just the current ones, either. No, they'd hit the dollar theater for older showings even more than they'd gone to the see the new releases. Steve had also gotten Tony to go on not one but three of his morning jogs, and while he had to go at a painstakingly slow pace to keep Tony from quitting he found he didn't mind the occassional company. Sam, his buddy from a wounded warrior support group, liked when Tony came along too. His favorite passtime was teasing Steve about the way he looked at the billionare, and teasing Tony about how his genes had to include a snail somewhere.
"Look it’s alright, we can move, I just- I thought I would mention," Tony assured Steve. "It’s no big deal. It’s a small kink, not really important. More of an accidental discovery than anything. We don’t have to- but can we still-"
"I'll help you," Clint offered, and a moment later Rhodey was excusing himself to go to the bathroom and- and...
Who had two very, very scary looking friends with him.
“Mr. MacKinnon will
Steve doesn't have to finally show up to answer questions and create even more, but he does anyway.
"Volleyball!" Natasha called, hoisting one pole up in the air and digging it down into the sand as Clint worked the other into the ground.
"No, no, he hasn't said anything," Tony replied. "I dunno what that means. I saw a ring. He has a ring, Rhodes, they went off and got married. And he's wearing it. And you know, maybe Steve did something bad and Bucky left, because if Steve left Bucky I don't think he'd be wearing the ring, but I can't imagine Steve doing anything wrong to any-"
But Steve fired right back. "Now hold on a minute, of course I thought it was a good idea to come see the man I love after being gone for days-"
Fuck, where did Tony want the night to go?
This escalated rather quickly, to the point where Tony was actually screaming at Steve rather than reverting to being cold and cruel as he typically would. Steve was being a pretty good sport, but he was only human and so after a bit he started to sneak in a few comments that he knew would only fire Tony up more. Steve's version of sneak was actually more so bluntly throwing things out there without any sort of tact, but oh well. The point was, after about ten minutes of this they both finally fell silent, and Tony stared at him with his jaw clenched while Steve gave him that typical look, arms crossed.
I'm taking prompts. I REALLY wanna get back into writing. Please consider it.
“You ain’t always been ya rotten little punk,” Bucky snorted. “Ignore him, doll, I get the bigger piece. I know there’s a bigger piece. Don’t hold out. And two coffees!”
Tony turned, trying to figure out how to not make this awkward. The sex was still a thing he very much wanted. Just, alright, not against the mirror.
"No matter how hard you stare at that door, they aren't coming through it." Tony hadn't realized he'd been staring, zoned out as the clock ticked by and the night crept towards closing time. Rhodey was right there with him as he leaned on the counter, which was probably lazy and unbecoming of a partial business owner but what was the point of buying part of the diner if he wasn't allowed to mope a little when and where he wanted to? Not that Tony would admit he was moping, because that would have required him to fess up to what he was moping about. And there was just no way that after three years he was still waiting for Steve and Bucky to come in and get their anniversary cake, because that was ridiculous.
They were still dancing. Kind of. Mostly, they were making out. And Tony was completely okay with that, until he realized that a few songs had gone by and he had a very, very uncomfortable erection which was being pressed down by the tight jeans he'd worn for the night. Okay. He could fix this. He just had to.. stop kissing Steve for a minute. It actually took a minute for that to happen, and then he was grinning up at Steve, enjoying the way his cheeks flushed, the way he shrugged his shoulders like it was no big deal. But it was. To Tony, it was a huge deal.
Tony didn’t pick up the job because he needed it. Working part time at a diner was never really in his cards, not with well established parents and a mind that would secure a future in robotics and wealth. It had been a pure need for socialization. A thirst for something that was out of his element. And above all? A suggestion from Rhodes that it wouldn’t kill him to experience a minimum wage job so that when he followed through and took over his dad’s company one day, he wouldn’t forget what it felt like to be on the bottom. Rhodey had the absolute best suggestions from the very first day they met, standing awkwardly in a dorm room and trying to figure out how to bridge the gap between roommates caused by the age, the reputation, and the uncertainty.
"You were never a-" Clint began, but all at once Tony's face was lighting up. Clint didn't even bother finishing. Tony was shooting past the group and straight towards Steve. Steve who was smiling. Steve who was laughing. Steve who's muscles were twitching with the laughter, who's eyes were just as touched by the smile as his dimples were, who-
"I felt bad that I suggested we all hit a bar when I found out you were recovering," Steve called over the music with a shrug. "Figured if you were going to stay sober, I would too."
Okay, he totally was.
"Oh we can tell," Steve added helpfully, and Tony just threw up his hands and rolled his eyes, stormed off to the kitchen to get them an authentic piece made by Adrian. It was a fond memory, one that he liked to sink into. Tony loved those little moments. It was his favorite thing about working at Red's.
“Oh please, my shit is exactly why you come here,” Tony retorted. “And the cake. I’ll admit, I’m pretty sure it’s mostly the cake. Don’t worry, I’ve actually already got your order in. Second I saw you two pull up I knew what you’d want. Bring us any new art this year, Steve?”
"Shit, Pepper is going to kill me," he groaned, standing up and grabbing his now empty bottle, chucking it in the trash. "Listen, it was so nice to meet you finally. Seriously. But I've got to run- I have a thing- a uh- listen, if you ever meet Pepper you'll understand. I've gotta go." He swiped the screen and offered a nervous, "Pep!" The angry chattering that came through was enough to convince Steve.
For just a few minutes things slowed. Their kisses were still needy, but they weren't quite as fervent and demanding. Tony was memorizing Steve's taste. Steve would break apart every now and then to suck another light bruise into Tony's skin, and Tony was delighted by the idea that Steve was trying to leave his mark. Steve was kissing up Tony's jaw line as he withdrew his fingers, and he pulled away from Tony all together as he drew himself up, kneeling over the man as he finally pressed his cock into Tony's now stretched hole.
The elevator had never been so silent. Steve had nothing to focus on but the disappointment of letting himself hope when he should have known better. He stepped up to his apartment door, grasped the handle so he could put the key in and.. It turned. Unlocked. Steve stood still for a moment, licking dry lips, thinking hard. Suddenly, he threw the door open.
"Stevie's not going to be one of your one night stands." It wasn't a question. It was a very, very firm statement, and Tony nodded vigorously. "Because the thing is, Stevie is our boy. He's sweet, he's handsome, and he's the sort of bleeding heart that guys like you could eat for dinner. But you seem like you've got a real good head on your shoulders, so I'm sure you understand that eating him alive would essentially ensure that me, Nat, and Sam here would beat you senseless if you hurt our boy."
Silence fell between them for a moment, and then Tony was shoving Steve onto his back and flopping down beside him on the ground. Tony dared to look up at the stars. He decided it was fair to give Steve's hypothesis a shot. Steve wrapped his arm tight around Tony's shoulder, his free hand behind his head, occasionally freeing it to point up at different groups of stars and ask Tony what he thought they looked like.
So when Tony wasn't there in the lab, Steve felt momentary panic.
“I have a piece out in the car,” Steve replied. “I honestly kinda thought you were jokin’ when you offered to buy one last time we were in here. You know you don’t hafta do that, right Tony?”
“Please, please, please tell me old man MacKinnon still makes the meanest Irish Cream Cake you ever bit into.” This one, Bucky he’d later learn, was the first to make Tony laugh. Steve was funny too, had his charm, but
"Technically?" the man demanded, and Tony didn't have to look up to know that Steve was smiling at the display.
All of this barely processed through his mind before he was leaning forward to capture Steve's lips in a kiss that, if he was being honest, he'd been wanting to go for since they sat down to watch Netflix together for the first time. Who would have thought that running away from commitment would drive him to actually wanting it with someone?
For a moment Steve just took the chance to breathe, watching as Tony’s face twitched, his throat contracting with the helpless moan that escaped him. Steve’s hips picked up the pace at that, driving up into Tony in quick, calculated movements. Tony’s right arm had lifted to hold the back of Steve’s neck, the left gripping one of Steve’s that had wrapped around him. His eyes. They were so blown, so gone. It was beautiful. It was-
Problem was, by the time morning came and Steve finally opened his eyes the bed was empty. He decided he must have overslept. Of course Tony would use that to his advantage. Steve couldn't help it though. Curled up close with Tony, inhaling him and clinging to his familiar warmth had been so welcomed after days of sleeping alone. He always slept best this way.
"Bet you didn't think I'd remember," Tony said with a wink as Steve caught his attention. "Pepperoni good with you? I will hands down order another one, but this one is already here so-"
The first time, Steve was a mixture of furious, amused, and concerned. Furious because an absolute stranger (he didn't count the time that apartment 6E dropped a heavy box with clicking mechanized parts in it on his foot as a meeting) had the audacity to not only break into his apartment, but also had left a note. Amused, because the note was oddly charming and this was certainly a way to finally officially meet. Concerned because there was no damage to the door or the frame. Apartment 6E was apparently good at breaking into things. Should he be worried?
Tony was cut off by a beach ball bouncing off the back of his head.
"That's not what I want from him dammit!" Silence. Tony knew that Rhodey was grinning. He did not want to actually see the smile, so he stood straight once more and huffed. "Fine. I'll do it myself. Thanks a lot sugar bear, knew I couldn't count on you." Before Rhodey could talk him down (as if he even would), Tony was out the door and headed straight for the all too familiar office. He'd been there a time or two, and not just to catch up. On some of his lower nights, Bruce had pulled him into the office and made him sit until he sobered up some. Tony was never sure if he was comfortable here, or if he just felt like a kid in a Principal's office everytime he crossed the threshold.
Tony was just so happy to see him. Even if it wasn't in the happiest of circumstances, and even if he wasn't sure why.
"If?" Eloquent today Tony.
Tony was too tired for this.
"Hey Steve," Tony replied after a moment, gesturing to his rag tag bunch. "This is Rhodey, Clint, and Bruce."
"Hey!" Tony snapped, rubbing the offended spot just as they stepped out into the hallway and almost walked into Clint. He had a look on his face, and Tony groaned, because he was about to be sandwhiched into a lecture and he was so not about that right now. "Listen. I know. I know it was stupid, I know it wasn't my best idea, but Steve asked me out. I mean, he asked me to come meet his friends. At a bar. And I agreed before he said at a bar, because-"
At age twenty, Tony did get involved with the company. Of course he did. But he made sure he had a clear spot in his schedule for those two (and the MacKinnon’s! It was all for them! So they didn’t have to hire new help! Totally!) and at twenty years old, Tony was standing right by their usual table (what do you
Rhodey gripped his shoulders, looking him in the eyes. "Tones. C'mon man, don't do this to yourself. I'm sure Steve'll tell you if he wants to. You shouldn't ask, though."
"I think telling people you repeatedly broke into his house is a good story," Bruce pointed out. When Tony only pouted, Bruce groaned and swatted his hands away. "You are the reason I have to drink calming tea and meditate, you know that right? Fine. I'll see what I can do, but go out and mingle in the meantime."
"But buttercup, I can't! I don't want anyone else trying to push me into this thing with Steve-"
"I wouldn't expect anything less from the good Capsicle."
Another few moments of hopeful waiting and Steve took the hint- and the key- and headed back downstairs to his own home. He pushed open the door and looked around. Looked like Stark wasn't kidding. He hadn't touched anything. Hell, it didn't even look like he'd sat on the couch. Steve, on the other hand, flopped into the spot easy enough and spent the rest of the night trying to think of what to say next time he ran into his neighbor.
"I love you too," Steve told him quietly. "And I’m going to love fucking you into the glass and watching you come undone."
Calling them regulars might have been too much. Bucky and Steve weren’t the sort to come into the diner once a week, if only because they didn’t really have that sort of money. Steve was nineteen, working through art school, and Bucky’d been working through different warehouses to secure experience and one day become a foreman.
Steve looked troubled by the idea, but Tony just held up a hand. "I get the feeling you're not they type who wants charity, but it's really not that," Tony assured him. "Steve, I'm a multi billionaire. I have thousands of these things in warehouses. Giving you one in exchange for letting me bust the lock on your door is hardly gonna break the bank."
"Steve has told me all about you," Same piped up, and as Bucky smirked Natasha smacked each upside the head. Tony's heart leapt a little. His friends knew about Tony. Good. That was good, that was.. irrelevant. This wasn't..
"Come on, I can handle a loss, but that scowl on his face?" Steve replied, and Tony tried to ignore the way that warmth shot up his spine. Steve liked his face without the scowl, then?
When Steve woke up to an empty bed.. His heart fell. For a moment, he was hopeful, but a quick run through of the apartment and he found no Tony. And maybe that was what he should have expected. Over the last few months, he'd come to know Tony pretty well. He might even be ridiculous enough to say he was falling for Tony, but he'd known from the moment he read that letter that Tony was not a relationship kind of guy. Still, he'd thought Tony had more respect for him than this.. that the man would at least talk to him about it. Explain that he couldn't settle down. It wouldn't have made leaving the apartment any easier, but at least he would have left with some dignity.
Steve had been looking at the menu, but he glanced up at that. He didn't look surprised. Tony had always talked about the other things he thought about doing. "You look like you're working?"
"This one isn't even my fault," Tony protested. "She's not even a one night stand, she's a reporter!"
It was comfortable. Steve, Bucky, Tony, chatting like Tony wasn’t in the middle of a shift. Never once did he feel like he should take for granted the warmth they afforded him, the way that they invited him into their night for conversation and laughter and soft teasing. Tony would like to call them his friends, if he didn’t only see them a few times a year and know nothing more about them than the fact that they had a romance of epic novel proportions. It was good. It was wholesome.
