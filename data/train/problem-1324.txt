God, and beyond just being unenthusiastic, it was also heartbreaking to see how little Sherlock thought of himself, that it was easier for him to believe that John was extending this invitation out of guilt than out of genuine interest in dating him.
Sherlock hesitantly sniffed at his own drink, nearly recoiling as the smell assaulted him.  Not wanting John to think him weak, though, Sherlock took a healthy sip of the rum.  He forced himself to swallow the mouthful, despite its awful taste.
Sherlock groaned and dropped his head into his hands. “Never speak to me again,” he muttered.
“Pretty sure everyone knows the rules,” Donovan said. “We go around in a circle, and whoever’s turn it is will say something they’ve never done. People who have done that thing will take a drink and hold up one finger. First person to hit ten fingers or to do ten things has to finish their drink and buy everyone another round.”
John took the watermelon from them and pulled out a knife to start slicing it up. He handed a large piece back over to them, and they let out what sounded almost like a mechanical whir. John watched them with a fond smile as they bit into the watermelon properly this time and chirped happily with every bite.
Sorry this took me like a month to update!  I haven't lost motivation for it, I've just been crazy busy!  This chapter is a little on the longer side though so hopefully that makes up for it :)

Sherlock had been apparently prepared for that argument, because he responded right away. “But this is a city. I could be in hospital in no time at all if something happened to me. But you—you’d be in an entirely different country, and the hospital here could phone you if something happened to me, but if you’re off God knows where, then how will I even be able to figure out that something’s gone wrong with you?” He started to sound a bit panicked, and John squeezed him tighter.

Sherlock called Molly—rather than sending a text as he usually would have done—the second he arrived back at his room.  He would have done it as soon as he left Speedy’s, but he had a (slightly irrational, yes) fear that John would somehow hear him if he was even on the same street as the café still.  He paced restlessly, hands tangling in his hair as he waited for Molly to pick up. It was still greasy and unkempt from the night before.  He desperately needed a shower, but he supposed there was still time for that. Was there really six hours until dinner? Six hours simultaneously felt like an age and not nearly long enough.

Although that was hardly a stern command, Sherlock found himself obeying almost automatically, which might have been troubling had he not been growing increasingly aroused at each passing moment. He stripped off the t-shirt and pyjama bottoms John had apparently dressed him in while he’d been unconscious and tossed them off the side of the bed.
“Would you like some tea?” Sherlock asked, the sight of the kettle prompting him to remember those manners he’d been chastised about neglecting when growing up.
Lestrade was looking him in a strange way—like a twelve-year-old’s father observing his son interacting with his crush.
Sherlock smiled, choosing to take John’s ‘wow’ as a compliment. “I thought we should wait for Lestrade first.”  He gestured over toward Molly, who looked like she was feeling a little out of place.

Before John could even take a step back, Sherlock reached out and pulled him close.  “You could come in,” he suggested, not caring that he sounded frayed and desperate.
The alien was sitting on the counter trying to bite into the side of a watermelon, but their teeth didn’t seem capable of piercing the exterior. There were books and papers from the station’s “library” scattered about. Nearly every text was about the monkeys endemic to the adjacent forest, and every one was written in English, but by the looks of it, the alien had tried to read them all.
While taking a break about six days into his cleaning rampage, he read through his conversation with John and pretended that he was doing it for purely logical reasons. What those logical reasons were, however, remained to be seen.

Mrs. Hudson tutted as she brought a tray of tea and biscuits over to the coffee table. “You’re not dying, dear,” she told him. “You just need a nice case. That’ll cheer you right up.”
John pressed a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head, and the arms around him tightened and released. It was, all in all, a perfect moment.
John raised an eyebrow at his tone. “I’m staying here,” he pointed out.
John frowned, wondering what this attempt at communication was supposed to convey.
Was that significant?

Sherlock tore his eyes away from John to look at the stranger who had just taken a seat at the other end of the table he had claimed. He forced himself to offer a polite smile. “Not at all,” he said, as charming as he could manage, even though he wanted to point out that the man had already sat down before getting permission, so Sherlock’s answer was quite pointless.
Stamford muttered something unintelligible and nearly tipped over. John was almost grateful for the distraction, even if it meant he would likely need to clean up vomit before the night was over.
He had gone there for fairly innocent reasons. Marcia Short came to him convinced that her fiancé was a member of the team that had committed a rather elaborate and compelling bank heist a few days earlier. This was the second such heist to take place during the time in which her fiancé, Marvin Gash, was home on military leave.   Ms. Short had thought it too much of a coincidence to ignore, and Sherlock decided that potentially capturing such an impressive thief warranted his attention.

John looked around, as if expecting to see his mysterious caller peering in from one of the windows. All he saw was Sherlock staring at him with obvious interest and concern from over by the oven.
He didn’t bother staying awake long enough to see whether or not they truly left the room. Either way, he slept more soundly that night than he’d ever done before, reassured with the fact that something interesting was actually happening to him.
John seemed surprised, which was ridiculous, and his face broke out in a grin again, which Sherlock greatly preferred to the stiff expression he’d been wearing moments prior. “Yeah? Right. So we’re both looking for more. Good.”

For approximately a week, he neglected his emails and his experiments alike as he tried to work out how to make the flat look a bit tidier for John’s military tastes. He toyed with getting rid of some of his scientific paraphernalia, but he didn’t exactly want to hide his interests from John, so he settled for merely re-organising them so that the clutter appeared to be less dramatic. He also sorted through the piles upon piles of documents that lined the walls of the sitting room. Ultimately, he threw out every bit of it when he decided that there was no way he could possibly get himself to sit down long enough to determine if each page needed to stay.

With every round, Sherlock and John used their turns to expose another part of their relationship to their companions, saying things that clearly only applied to one another.
After months of kissing and over-the-clothes touching, Victor asked Sherlock for something more.  Sherlock, who fancied himself in love at that point, had readily complied, eager to please. Sherlock brought Victor off with his hand that night, and it was the most intimate thing he had ever done with anyone before.
“Rush of endorphins,” John said cheerily by way of explanation. He lifted his head, grinning, and kissed Sherlock gently. The fact that he still wanted them to kiss was certainly reassuring.
When John finally trudged up the stairs, Sherlock was grateful that he’d had time to mentally prepare for this moment; otherwise, he might have collapsed into John’s arms on sight.
John frowned at him from over the top of his own mug, where he was blowing gently at the liquid within. “I feel like you were having a conversation with me in your head again,” he said, “and now you’re expecting me to just catch up.” His words were fond, but they were not the response Sherlock had been hoping to hear.
“I think you just like seeing guys run around in tight shorts,” John teased.
“Don’t be like that, baby,” he said with a laugh, like this was some sort of game they were playing. He stepped closer and handed Sherlock his phone. “Here.”   Sherlock took the phone with slightly clumsy fingers. “Put your number in. I’ll call you tomorrow.” Sherlock hesitated, and the man touched the side of his face. “Don’t worry. I’m not going to try anything tonight. You’ll put your number in, and we’ll get you home safely, and when you’re feeling up to it,
“Not interested,” he said, turning back so that he could look in the direction John had gone.
Mm, I’ll be the judge of that.

Mrs. Hudson smiled, clearly knowing that she had won their little argument. “Do be nice to him.” She retreated back into her own flat—which was undoubtedly free of strangers—and Sherlock glared at her door.
Sherlock scoffed, as if it was ridiculous to assume that he was anxious in any way, and made a conscious effort after that to appear outwardly unaffected.
Struggling with obvious disbelief, John was apparently rendered incapable of speaking for a few moments, simply staring at Sherlock, perplexed. “How is it that you can tell me that I’m studying medicine, that I have a sibling I don’t get on with, and that I work at a bakery, but you can’t tell that I’ve been flirting with you for ages?”  He let out a startled laugh. “You’re rubbish when it comes to this sort of thing, aren’t you?”

In hindsight, Sherlock probably could have been a bit more tactful. Instead of asking his client to meet him and then saying, “I informed your wife that her missing jewelry is with your mistress,” he probably could have sent a text and kept his doors locked. Unfortunately, he had not considered the fact that his client had a particularly violent temper before revealing his findings, and he was now face-to-face with a furious man who had just had his affair revealed to his wife of four years.

“You’re heading out?” John asked, putting his pen down.  All of his attention was on Sherlock.  It was intoxicating.
John walked up the stairs, and Sherlock stood in the sitting room, hands clasped behind his back, ready to present the problem to John.
Sherlock kept his face hidden, but he wrapped his arms around John’s middle and squeezed tight. “You’re not really a terrible boyfriend,” he said, as if worried John would take it seriously.
At that, Sherlock did look up, and it was only to shoot John an exasperated glare belied by the upward twitch in their lips. “That sounds idiotic.” After a pause, they added, “Actually, Sherlock Holmes might not be a bad human name.”
The last week had been incredible. When he had been younger, back in his early teenage years, he had longed for a proper relationship as many teens do. He had always envisioned what romance would be like with a dashing man who cared deeply for him. Of course, it hadn’t taken long before his peers notified him that people like him—that

Sherlock slowly dropped their hands away from their face, studying John’s expression as if trying to determine how honest he was being. “So you want me to be your significant other?” they asked slowly.
“You should eat,” Sherlock said, unable to keep the concern out of his voice.
John smiled and approached him, stomach swooping nervously. “Been waiting long?” he asked as he seated himself across from Sherlock, gesturing to the now-empty mug sitting in front of him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, feeling more confident. He had a definite mission in mind, and he would not let his own uncertainty deter him from it. “I’m not stopping this,” he said, wiggling his arse a bit just to feel John’s hands tighten around him. “I’m getting—” He fumbled around in his drawer for a few moments before pulling out a small bottle, triumphant. “I was getting this.” He tossed the lube over at John and pulled himself back up on the bed properly. “We’ll be needing it.”

As with the previous texts, the reply was almost immediate.

By the time his entire cock was buried in Sherlock’s arse, both of them were out of breath, and Sherlock was letting out soft, desperate noises with every exhale.
“Let me know if this is moving too fast,” John said, managing to work through his lust with obvious effort to be reasonable right then.
Sherlock stared and blinked and generally looked vacant enough that John worried he’d broken him somehow.

A month into their relationship found Sherlock and John in the library, as per usual.  John was studying for some practical exam he had coming up, and Sherlock had a case file spread out before him.
And now they were standing outside on the pavement. All of John’s rugby mates had dispersed already, leaving just the two of them. This was always the most awkward part of a date, in John’s opinion. He wasn’t sure if it was going to end here or continue, and he didn’t know whether or not Sherlock would even be comfortable with the latter option.

John’s smirk was back in place, and he took another few steps toward Sherlock until the heat from his body could just about be physically felt. “For you, Sherlock Holmes, there’s no charge.”
“I found your ID badge.” They pulled it out of their trouser pocket and tossed it over to John.
Sherlock looked away from John and said nothing.
The man smirked, and he reached one hand up to brush back some of Sherlock’s hair in a move that was entirely unwanted. “You’re going to be so much fun, aren’t you, baby?”
It was ridiculous to indulge in such thoughts just because of a dream, he knew, but knowing it didn’t stop him from spending two hours carefully sorting out his appearance on Monday morning so that he could look his best for John. Sherlock had to look perfect, because John always looked perfect, and Sherlock would have at least liked to be on the same level as him for once.
Sherlock glanced back over at him but didn’t say a word.
She didn’t.  “You’re into one of the rugby guys, aren’t you?”
Sherlock cocked their head to the side. “Did you take it?”
“Sherlock, where are you going?” John asked, his tone concerned.

John set a comforting hand on his knee, presumably to try to make up for his disappointment. “Back when you said that stuff about moving in, I thought you were just making up an excuse to get me upstairs. I had no idea you were actually serious.”
No, you didn’t.
Everyone was already there when Sherlock and John arrived, and from the look of it, they were already about one drink in. They were all crowded around a few tables that had been pushed together, and they had left two open seats for the two of them.

In the absence of the distraction, John put a little more command in his voice and again growled, “Get down from the tree.”
John was clearly still hard, his cock a heated reminder of the fact that they weren’t done for the night, and before either of them could say anything, Sherlock began pulling John toward the bedroom.
.  John had seen him walking around and had thought to announce his presence so that they could talk.  Sherlock was starting to worry that he had developed a heart condition given the irregular beating it seemed to be doing lately.
“Thanks,” John said with a grin, and even his voice was perfect. “Hey, you’re that hot bloke from the library, aren’t you?”
[4:29AM] I’ll prove it to you. JW
John had been on an unfortunate losing streak with regard to dating for the past month. Well, it was more like the past year. The past twenty-three years, even. Every girl he tried chatting up was just so unbearably boring. He’d started anticipating nothing more than a one-night stand, because his romantic prospects were—in a word—underwhelming.
Having certainly realised his mistake, Sherlock’s comment only made the client angrier. He released one hand’s grip on Sherlock’s jacket, and that newly freed fist immediately was drawn back. Sherlock had just a moment to grimace before he was forced to turn his head to the side and move with the hard punch colliding with his cheek. Lovely. Now he would have a bruise. The man then lifted Sherlock by his jacket and slammed him down on the coffee table, causing two of its legs to collapse under him.
“I want to,” Sherlock responded immediately, meeting John’s gaze. He kissed the scar again before moving his lips to other parts of John’s chest, trailing his lips reverently across every bit of skin.
The alien stared at him in shock for a moment before tentatively laughing in return. It was low and deep and suffused with a happiness that seemed to surprise them. John thought it might have been one of his favourite sounds in the world.
[27 August, 9:07AM] Well, we can’t have that. JW
The man—John, as Sherlock later learned—had looked up to find him staring, and rather than seeming put off, he smirked and raised his glass, as if to share in a private, long-distance toast with Sherlock. Sherlock, lacking a drink, had raised his phone in a lame reciprocation of the gesture.
“Hi,” John said, shuffling his feet a little awkwardly.
John seemed torn between amusement and arousal as he took in what Sherlock had been grabbing. “You’re just perfect, aren’t you?” he murmured before leaning down to kiss Sherlock again. This time, the kiss was a bit sloppy and incredibly hot.

John laughed. “Well, it was definitely unprofessional.” He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s lips again, chaste but lingering. When he pulled back, he said, “If that’s what it’s like working with you, though, I guess I can’t really refuse.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the vehemence directed his way. Before the other men could process it, he reached out and grabbed the radio for himself. “I’m not a private detective; I’m a consulting detective,” he explained. “I’m

“Yes, but after that, you had a very long and very stressful journey back here, so you need to rest some more.”
“You’re a medical student.  You maintain good marks in all of your courses, but you still feel the need to study relentlessly for them.  You’re twenty-three years old, and you’re left-handed.  You’re not an only child; you’ve got a brother named Harry that you’re not exactly close to, but you do sometimes try to put in the token effort.  You’re likely primarily putting yourself through school with very little assistance from your parents.  You don’t come from a wealthy family, and you’re only able to attend this university because of scholarships and the minimal money you make from your job.  You work long hours on the weekends—at a bakery, I’d wager.”  Sherlock paused for a fraction of a second before adding, “And you’re bisexual, though it’s unlikely that you’ve openly dated a man, but you’re not opposed to the possibility of it.”  He wasn’t sure of that last bit, but it would be good to see John’s reaction to the statement.
Sherlock smiled back, and for the first time since this had all started, he allowed himself to accept it as reality rather than an unlikely possibility.
And Sherlock liked that idea very much as well, so he let the matter drop.
John smiled in spite of his tone and kissed his nose gently. “Because you were moping, and you ought to know by now that it’s better to just talk about things that are bothering you instead of refusing to speak to me for days.”
It didn’t take long for John to get the table’s legs back in place, which was both impressive and disappointing, as it meant that John now had no further reason to stay in the flat. Still, Sherlock noticed that John took a ridiculously long time collecting his tools, putting each one away one at a time, making small-talk with Sherlock all the while.
Just as he felt on the verge of collapsing, two firefighters stepped calmly through the flames, protected by their thick boots and trousers. One of them—a lower-ranking member, he couldn’t help but notice—stepped forward and took the victim off of his shoulder. Sherlock stumbled to the side with the loss of her weight, and he started to wonder whether or not they had been supporting one another equally all along. The other firefighter—white helmet, signaling higher rank—scooped Sherlock in his arms without a moment of hesitation.
He would have complained verbally had he not felt three slick digits pressed up against his perineum. A shot of electric arousal went through him at the touch. When had John opened the bottle of lube? How had Sherlock not noticed this? His whole body stilled as he adjusted to the new feeling.
“Now,” he pleaded, his cock throbbing. He needed John inside him properly, felt that he would go mad if he didn’t have it.
to at least give consideration to how this fits into the plans of your long-term partner. SH
John wasn’t sure if Sherlock’s bedroom being on an entirely different floor was the cause of concern for the alien, or if that last bit had merely been an unrelated piece of information. “Well, you can’t sleep in here, and you can’t keep coming in here and waking me up.” As much as John liked the idea of Sherlock sharing his bed, he knew that it would merely make his attachment to them all the more obvious, and that would in turn drive them away more quickly.
Sherlock opened their mouth, no doubt to make a sardonic comment about how they had, in fact, already seen flowers before, but the words never came out. John smirked, noting the exact moment that Sherlock laid eyes on first one fuzzy little bee, then another, then another, before it became clear that the flowers were alive with the tiny creatures.

Sherlock was almost grateful when his shower began to malfunction, as that gave him the perfect excuse to get John to his flat for a seventh time. The last several had been for relatively unimportant reasons. A broken mug was hardly an emergency, after all. John surely knew by that point that Sherlock was more interested in having him physically at the flat than having anything in particular repaired. But John had brought dinner for him the last time and had by that point called him “gorgeous,” “love,” and “sweetheart,” so Sherlock didn’t exactly care if John was on to him, just so long as those intimate things kept coming. He might have suspected that John was just flirting with him in order to benefit his business, but since John still refused to charge him for any of his services, Sherlock was hopeful that perhaps there was genuine interest on John’s side as well.
He bit his lip as he considered going over there to join John at his table. Surely he wouldn’t be opposed, especially not if he actually had been flirting with Sherlock before.
The alien studied John’s face for a moment before grinning. It looked a bit like someone who had never smiled before was trying to imitate human emotion while in a massive amount of discomfort. All in all, it was a bit disconcerting, and John stopped smiling. The alien’s smile dropped as well. Their skin then lost its blue-purple-green hue and instead became suffused with a lighter version of John’s own colouring.
John opened his phone to discover very gruesome images of a very dead man staring back at him, and he quickly glanced over his shoulder to ensure that he wasn’t being watched, his adrenaline going as he wondered what the hell SH was on about. It was interesting, though; more interesting than his current activity, which involved staring blankly at his textbook in the university library. There were three such pictures, all of the same corpse, all showing different angles. The dead man had discoloration around his mouth, and he rested on a chrome tabletop that made it clear that SH was in the morgue. John waited for five minutes after receiving the pictures, but there was no explanation forthcoming from his hyper-perceptive arse.
Sherlock spared a thought for how good an army captain John would have made if he’d gotten that far. “I understand,” he said, nodding once more at John before he grabbed his drink and made his way over toward a solitary table nearby.
Sherlock met Victor when he was fifteen.  He had been flattered that someone like Victor, two years older and infinitely more experienced, had taken an interest in him.
He looked around at his half-tidy flat. John probably wouldn’t care about the state of it. He’d be there only to sleep, and in spite of the flirtiness of their emails, it was likely that John would seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere. After all, they weren’t exclusive. They weren’t
It only got worse as they started playing.  Sherlock didn’t know the first thing about rugby, but he didn’t need knowledge of the sport to appreciate the match.  John, it turned out, could even look attractive when he was sweaty and covered in dirt.  And, god, the way he tackled the other team’s players.  Sherlock wasn’t sure what it was about that overt show of strength that was affecting him so much.  He had never been a particularly sexual creature, but something about watching John Watson right then made him

John chuckled and kissed his cheek before trailing his lips down Sherlock’s jaw. It was an annoyingly pleasant feeling, and Sherlock’s posture relaxed automatically. “Now, can we talk about this?” When Sherlock again said nothing, John sighed heavily. “Right, so you want me to move in with you, and you’re upset that I haven’t thought about it before.”
Unfortunately, his response seemed to only encourage her more. She was quite passionate about birds, it seemed, and though John usually found it attractive when his partner was passionate about something, that principle clearly didn’t apply with this particular girl. Well, he reasoned, he was just trying to have sex, not marry her. Sex was easier than trying to navigate the mess of relationships with people he was generally only half-sold on. Besides, he was planning on joining the army in a few years, so he hardly saw the point in trying to establish something real now.
John groaned again and rocked his hips up into Sherlock’s hand. “Are you sure?” he asked, and Sherlock would have told him off for his over-consideration had he not been so distracted by the prospect of getting John to fuck him.
John stepped up to his side at that moment, wrapping an arm around his waist. “Well, Detective Inspector, I think you have enough to be going on for right now,” he said, doing a rather impressive impression of Sherlock’s usual dismissals of Lestrade. John tugged Sherlock out the door, which was confusing, as the case wasn’t over yet, but Sherlock went along with John easily enough.
He was a bit obsessed, and the day his last case ended, he wasn’t able to keep that obsession from going to work on his flat.
Sherlock licked his lips. John’s midsection was a few shades paler than his face and hands, and he was in peak physical condition—the very manifestation of Sherlock’s deepest fantasies.
Sherlock did look up then, but it was only to glare. “Shut up,” they said. “It’s hardly as if that’s important information to know.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I suppose that’s fair.”
John smiled at him. “A very handsome corpse, but a corpse nonetheless.”

It took him another minute or so to pull himself together and to remove the heat from his cheeks.  When he felt confident that he looked as calm as he ever could, he lifted his head and tried to bury himself in the book he was meant to searching through. With John sitting just across the table, though, it was incredibly difficult to get himself to concentrate. John kept glancing up at him and smiling, and it was driving Sherlock absolutely mad.  He was out of his depth in a way that he hadn’t been since Victor.

This continued for the next few days. John would ask if Sherlock would like to join him, and Sherlock would cite some excuse about needing to do something else. They never responded when John questioned them about it. Indeed, they remained wrapped up in their head so often that they barely spoke to John at all.
Sherlock huffed out a put-upon sigh, but whey they arrived at the market, the first thing Sherlock did was locate an umbrella and give it to John.
John frowned. “Can you understand me at all?”
John thought he heard Sherlock’s breathing hitch, but he must have been imagining it, as Sherlock looked remarkably composed as they retracted their antennae until they weren’t visible beneath their hair.
And yet, he still found himself saving the number, wrong as it had been, under the contact name ‘SH.’
John’s relief was profound. He nearly jumped up and down in his excitement, but then again, he was a grown man, and he doubted that he’d ever be able to live that down. He’d already been open about his feelings once that day, and he certainly wasn’t going to do it twice in the span of ten minutes.
He went out the next day on his own. Everyone else had left El Panadero, so now he had the freedom to do things a bit outside of his normal duties. He took his machete as well as his gun—a token from his army days that was useful, if not strictly legal.
The reply was almost immediate, meaning that SH had apparently been waiting around for John to ask questions before revealing anything.
Sherlock let his head drop back against the wall, panting as if he’d just chased a suspect across the entirety of London. “Is that a wrench in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?” he asked breathlessly.
Fact: Sherlock was interested in John.
John was admittedly nervous. He hadn’t been like this before any of the other dates he’d gone on recently, but Sherlock was different. Granted, this wasn’t so much a proper date as a very large dinner shared between several couples. Still, he had made his intentions clear, and now Sherlock knew that he wanted this, and, God, he was really very nervous.
Sherlock let out a put-upon sigh but put the compress back against his cheek.
Sherlock noticed. Of course they did. They were bloody brilliant. They approached John while he was cooking one morning, and their expression belied their obvious confusion at John’s recent behaviour. “Would you like to come out into the forest with me today?” they asked. They looked hopeful enough that John actually felt his hardened demeanor soften a bit.
The reply came mere seconds later, and Sherlock felt a bit warm at the thought of John watching his phone, waiting for Sherlock’s text.

Everything except John.
The man, still smirking in a way that made Sherlock want to slap him, had the audacity to reach under the table and grab Sherlock’s thigh. “What do you think?” he asked, his tone somewhere between playful and threatening.
[4:23PM] Aw, I can practically feel you blushing from all the way over here. JW
Sherlock couldn’t quite get his mind to cooperate with him. He had no idea how to respond, and he couldn’t even begin to think of words to string together. He ought to be better at such things by this stage in his life. He was twenty-four and should have been prepared to handle hot military repairmen standing in his flat, smirking at him, looking so unbearably handsome.
and miles of long legs. Stunning.
Sherlock moaned and tried to grind against John’s to get that feeling once more. John’s hands tightened on him in order to keep him upright as he undulated his hips. “Too big to be a wrench,” he said, caught between shock and lust. John must have been incredibly large, and while Sherlock had previously noted the distinctive way John walked, he hadn’t quite put together the implications of that particular stride on penis size.
Sherlock rutted against him hard, his eyes squeezing shut, mouth open as a surprised

When there was no more stalling to do, Sherlock stood from the sofa and pulled out his wallet. “How much do I owe you?” he asked, determined to actually pay this time.
To: Sherlock Holmes <sh@thescienceofdeduction.co.uk>
[6:28AM] Look, love, I’ve got to head out. I’ll try to get back to you soon. JW
He was just about to get up and sit by John when the man himself stood up and walked toward him instead.  He didn’t bring his books, which meant that he was likely planning on returning to his own table at some point, but Sherlock was still thrilled that John had thought to come over to him at all.
John looked positively charmed, and Sherlock wondered how he had missed looks like that before they’d gotten together. “Something fruity it is.” With that, he stood up and made his way over toward the bar.
John laughed good-naturedly, and Sherlock hated how much that sound warmed him.
John laughed again. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I’ve been a little love struck, too.”
, and it was perfect. He pulled back to kiss both of Sherlock’s cheeks just to watch the brilliant turquoise flush that bloomed out of Sherlock’s skin on those spots. “God, you’re beautiful,” John breathed, and Sherlock ducked their head away adorably.
He ran a hand through his hair, tugging at it in slight frustration. If he didn’t have a heart, then why did it still hurt like this?  He felt pathetic.  He had imagined that he could have something with John, but, really, why would John Watson want someone like him?  He had deluded himself into thinking there was something there, but there hadn’t been. Or perhaps John had simply changed his mind, like Victor had done.
sake, I suggest you never contact me again.” He slammed the phone down. His heart was racing. Someone knew about Sherlock. Someone very creepy and obviously very powerful knew about Sherlock. John didn’t like that.
Sherlock whimpered again, his movements speeding up. John wanted to see him so badly, wanted to expose them both to one another, but he didn’t want to derail their current momentum. Another time, he told himself. Another time they could try this unclothed, and, oh, maybe Sherlock would want to ride him, and he could have this new fantasy acted out.
John, grimacing, had shaken his head. “Guy troubles.”
John started to wonder if Sherlock was offended at being called normal, but that didn’t seem to fit with what was happening o far. “It’s fine,” he hastened to say, wanting to smooth over whatever had caused Sherlock’s mood to drop. “Normal is boring anyway.”
By that evening, he had changed outfits seven times, had changed his mind about eyeliner three times, had showered twice, and had carefully selected the appropriate cologne. Finally, he was ready. He wore arse-hugging jeans and a tight maroon V-neck that showed off a bit too much of his chest to be decent. He stood awkwardly in his sitting room, fighting the urge to fuss with his outfit and his hair, as he waited for John to arrive.
Molly laughed.  He was in the middle of a crisis, the likes of which he had never dealt with before (Victor didn’t count, as Sherlock had never had to react to the break-up with him), and Molly was
John took the compress and placed it on his shoulder. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that. Have you seen yourself lately? You look like a corpse.”
“You should be a detective when you get older,” John went on.
John picked up the tray of food, and, as there was no room on the table, headed into the sitting room to set it down on the coffee table. Sherlock had apparently predicted this move, because by the time John had everything set, Sherlock had already taken up one half of the sofa. John moved to sit pressed against him, and though he kept both hands free to pick at the food, he made sure that half of his body was touching Sherlock at all times.

and that a different sort of predator wouldn’t have been making promises about just getting him home safely and meeting up later. This had to be the man. And yet, he couldn’t remember what he was supposed to do in this situation. He put in a number that didn’t quite match with his, mostly due to his inability to get the image of the phone in front of him to stand still, before handing the device back to its owner.
John smiled back and turned his hand over so that he could twine their fingers together.
John was eager to work on cases with Sherlock as they’d done years earlier at the beginning of their relationship, back when John going off to war had been an impending but far-away concern. Now, there was no such thing lingering over them, and they both found that it was almost more enjoyable to work together then than it had been when they were younger.

Sherlock returned the smile and made to move away.
last night.”
He resisted the urge to seek out the site of the fallen tree. It was likely in the middle of the dense forest, and his presence was needed back at the main house shortly for the departure of the primatologists.
Sherlock ducked their head down, hiding their face. “I—er, well, I’ve never. You know,” they muttered.
John laughed and reached up to place his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “You don’t need to worry. I’ve only got eyes for one person right now.”
Comments and kudos are greatly appreciated!
“I’ll get teams together to try to prevent that from happening,” Lestrade said. “We’ll stake out the bars in plain clothes and hopefully stop this bastard from getting to anyone else.” He already sounded tired.
“Enough of that,” John snapped, wrestling the blade away from the alien. “Is everyone in your species such a handful?” Even as he said it, though, he knew that he wouldn’t trade this for anything. Meeting them had been the best thing that had ever happened to him since returning from war. He let out a slightly disbelieving laugh, shaking his head. “This is an insane situation. I’m bickering with an alien who can’t even speak my language.”
[4:17AM] That long, hm? JW
John smiled brightly at him again.  “Fantastic.  I’ll see you tomorrow, then, Sherlock.”
Sherlock ignored him.  He was such a fool.
Subject: RE: You never do this
He took a deep breath and let it out.  “Give me an example of an E1cB reaction,” he said, and Molly seemed to take the hint that the personal discussion was over for the time being.
John grinned and, after removing his shoes as well, climbed on top of him on the bed. He placed his arms on either side of Sherlock’s head and straddled his hips. John’s hips pressed against Sherlock’s, and he groaned, his forehead dropping down against Sherlock’s. Christ, he hadn’t even realised how hard he was, and now here was the proof. Sherlock let out a gasp below him and bucked up, his own clothed erection rubbing against John’s. John kissed him again, keeping it light at first to attempt to keep at least some part of this chaste. He didn’t want to go too fast too soon and scare Sherlock off. Sherlock was having none of that, though, and he kissed back passionately, sloppily, as he ground his hips upward and whimpered into John’s mouth.
“For the past twelve hours,” they replied. “It didn’t take me long after hearing you speak, and I read all the books in your library. I’m fairly certain I have a good command of your language now.”
As they left the restaurant, Sherlock, feeling bold, reached out and twined their fingers together.  Past experience indicated that John was comfortable with minimal public displays of affection, so he figured that the gesture wouldn’t be refused. He was right.  John squeezed his hand and smiled in his direction, making no move to pull away.
“You like that, do you?” John asked.
[10:21AM] Please tell me I’m right. SH
John tried his best to imitate the sound, but he was fairly certain he butchered it, judging by the alien’s amused expression. John shook his head, and there was a slight smile tugging up at his own lips. “Can I just call you Sherlock? That sounds like Sherlock.”
Even still, he couldn’t stop fidgeting, not even when he entered Speedy’s. He shoved his hands in his pockets, hoping to prevent them from giving away his anxiety.
John sat there, panting, until he finally had enough energy to gently lift Sherlock’s hand away from his own so that he could refrain from becoming too sensitive post-orgasm. Sherlock used their newly freed hand to scoop up some of John’s come on one finger and daintily slip it into their mouth.
Sherlock was oddly endeared by John’s fumbling right then. It was refreshing to not be the one blundering through a sentence for once.  “Italian is fine.  I like Italian.”
Right.
Sherlock planned to go into the library on Thursday at noon. Coincidentally, John’s usual schedule did not permit him to be in the library on Thursdays at noon.
Sherlock was mildly offended that John had essentially implied that he’d looked bad during the last seventy-two hours. “What were you shot doing?” he asked as John continued pulling at his arm until he followed him into the loo.
The next chapter will be up on Tuesday!

John felt something uncomfortable settle in his stomach. “Some people happen to enjoy a bit of sentiment.”
Sherlock let out a frustrated noise, but dropped their hand to their side. John was glad, as he had no idea how a bee sting would affect someone like Sherlock, someone not of this world.
I suppose a week is a decent amount of time. Not much sand and heat in London these days.
To: John Watson <john.h.watson@email.co.uk>
Sherlock frowned. “What are you doing here?” he asked, which, as greetings went, was not exactly stellar.
John grinned back. “I know, but it wouldn’t be very gentlemanly of me to let you do that.”
[12:12PM] Miss you, too. Love you, too. Sorry, too. JW
Lestrade perked up at that. “I’m thinking of joining NSY. We could go in together.”
[6:25AM] Why can’t you come home? SH
And there it was, confirmed. John had been a right arse. “I’m sorry I got angry with you before,” he said. He generally wasn’t good at admitting fault, but this time, he knew it was necessary. “Those things you were saying about yourself before—the things you thought
John shook his head but couldn’t help smiling as he did so. “You’re ridiculous,” he told them. “And I certainly hope that’s not poisonous to you, or you’re in deep trouble. I may be a doctor, but dealing with extraterrestrial species might be a little too much for even me to handle.”
The following day at school, someone called Sherlock gay. He was, so he didn’t deny it, but he saw the look on Victor’s face as it was said.  There was shock in his expression, as if he hadn’t expected anyone to come right out and say it.
to know you,” Sherlock said, pausing slightly before adding, “I’ve got someone else.”
John quirked an eyebrow up. “Not everyone likes them so much that their landlady knows about it.”
Sherlock suddenly felt quite faint.  He had always prided himself on being aloof in the face of comments from others, but even he couldn’t prevent the blush that rose to his cheeks at John’s words. He could only hope that it was minimal enough to not register to John’s less observant eyes.  God, he was an embarrassment.  “I—I mean, I don’t know if I’d say that, but I do see you at the library quite often.”
“Brilliant,” John said, and Sherlock’s cheeks felt warm again.
John paused for a moment at that latest text. He had thought that it was obvious that he just wanted to talk, but perhaps he was actually inconveniencing SH. Well, only one way to figure that out, he supposed.
Molly smacked him in the arm.  He sat back and glared at her.  “What was that for?”
John waited until that Monday to text Sherlock again. He’d needed to get all of his teammates on board first before he could really commit to going through with this.
It took thirteen minutes to get back to his own room (would have taken eleven, but the cab driver had been unbearably slow), leaving Sherlock seven minutes to change before he needed to head out to meet John at Speedy’s. Sherlock rubbed himself down with a wet flannel, put on deodorant, brushed his teeth, changed, and brushed his teeth again in six minutes flat.  There was nothing he could do about the marks on his neck, dark purple and livid against this pale skin.  He would have to look into asking Molly for some of her concealer at a later point, but there was no time currently.  He wasn’t anywhere near as presentable as he’d have liked to be as he walked out of his flat, but it would have to do.
“Oh,” Sherlock said as something clicked in place for him. “You’re a
Everyone else around the table merely shrugged and deemed Never Have I Ever to be an appropriate way to pass the time and to work on getting others drunker. Eventually, John acquiesced as well. Sherlock resolutely did not comment. He knew that this was only being used as a tool to humiliate him in front of John. Donovan obviously wanted to demonstrate to John all of Sherlock’s oddities, but, little did she know, Sherlock had recently undergone a series of ‘firsts’ with John that would put him on a much more level field along with the other participants of the game. He simply stared her down when she shot him a smug look.
Sherlock turned to the one called Matty.  “You were with two different girls last night.  You didn’t have time to change clothes after you left the second one.  Had to get back to your actual girlfriend, I imagine.  She doesn’t know you’re cheating on her, and you have no intention of telling her, but if you keep walking around in a shirt that has smears of two different types of lipstick on it—neither of which belongs to your girlfriend, who prefers gloss for her lips judging by that smudge on your cheek—you’re bound to get caught.”  He turned to Bernard and smirked a bit.  “You have traces of lip gloss on your neck, the same kind of lip gloss that Matty’s girlfriend favours.  I’m sure even you lot can make the connection there.”  It was always good to show off his talents, and when it caused discomfort for guys like that, that was all the better.
“Good,” Sherlock said at first, but he reconsidered.  “Well, it was good at the time, but now I fear there may be consequences.”
Sorry this chapter took so long, but here it is, the finale!  There will in all likelihood be a short epilogue to this in the next few weeks, so keep an eye out for it!
[2:59AM] I can always tell when you’re crying. JW
John smiled reassuringly back at them. Or, at least, he tried to, but he was sure it ended up coming off as a bit stiff. Christ, for someone who came from a sentimental species, he really needed to work on his flexibility with emotions.
[1:36AM] Yeah, genius, I’m just going to leave. Maybe I’ll check my messages next week. JW
John kissed their nose before batting their hands away. He pulled his shirt up over his head and tossed it down onto the floor. He was gratified by the way Sherlock’s eyes went wide. He liked to think that he’d remained relatively fit since his army days, and with all the blatant staring going on, he could tell that Sherlock at least thought he was still in decent shape.
It was far too soon when they arrived back at Sherlock’s room. He turned around, back to the door, and made no move to go inside, reluctant as he was for the night to end.
John picked up one of Sherlock’s hands and brought it to his lips briefly. “Don’t worry about it. Wilkes is the worst, and that cheating bastard deserves to have his night ruined.” Sherlock still looked stiff and a bit lifeless, though, so John kissed Sherlock’s cheek and murmured, “That was a brilliant deduction, by the way. Absolutely amazing, you know that?”
This takes a decent way through John's tour in Afghanistan!
Sherlock, again, was baffled by the words before him.  Was John really content not to talk about what had happened?
“He has a girlfriend.”
Sherlock was confused beyond belief, but he didn’t want to say anything to draw attention to the fact that John was reacting strangely. He was inherently selfish, and he wanted to keep this for as long as possible.  “Oh,” was all he seemed able to say.  Luckily, John seemed to find that charming, as he kept smiling over at Sherlock.
They shifted even closer to John. “Now, back to kissing, I think.” They shut their eyes and tilted their chin forward, lips pursed, and John was sure he had never been more in love. (Not that he would admit to that last bit, as this was all still far too new to be throwing around sentiments like that.)
“So greedy for it, aren’t you?” John nipped at his neck before sucking hard on one spot, and, god, that felt incredible. “Go on, love. Get yourself off now. Take the edge off, because I’m nowhere near finished with you yet.” He licked at the bruise he’d sucked into Sherlock’s skin and reached around to grab Sherlock’s arse, guiding his thrusts.

“I can pay next time,” he offered, subtly testing to see whether or not John would want another date.
“Get down from there, or I will shoot!” John shouted.
“How did he die?” Lestrade pressed. “And who killed him?”
True to his word, John texted the number the following morning. Stamford was spending the day, miserable and hung-over, being cared for by his girlfriend, and John felt the sting of being single a bit too prominently right then. He was just desperate enough to try going on a few dates with Bird Girl, as he had taken to calling her mentally.

Do you have something for me?

Sherlock opened his mouth to respond but found that he truly didn’t know yet.

“No offence, mate, but like my boys said, we can’t just let a private detective—or
John laughed, his smile breaking through the weariness that had seemed so permanently etched in his features. The veiled mention of their sex life was apparently what John needed to get back to feeling normal in all of this. “And I’ll be sure to spoil you rotten later for everything you did to get the flat sorted out for me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock ignored him and pulled out a pasta dish he’d apparently bought during his shopping excursion. He warmed it up per the instructions and was so focused on that task that he was startled into jumping when he felt a hand on his arm.
[7:00PM] Fine. I’ll focus better on my own anyway. SH
Sherlock’s skin glowed for a moment, and John tugged them into an unoccupied aisle so that no one would see that. “You really think so?”
Sherlock merely shrugged, not quite looking at her.  He shouldn’t have even been upset about it. After all, it wasn’t as if John had promised him anything.  The perceived flirting Sherlock had picked up on was likely John’s natural friendliness coming out.  They had only been in contact with one another for about a week.  No strong attachment should have been formed in such a short span of time.
Thanks for reading!  Sorry again that this took so long to upload.  The next chapter is going to be a lot shorter, so that one shouldn't take me nearly as long to get finished, and then I'll add a little epilogue to this!
“We were talking about the status of our relationship, and you said, ‘I would prefer it if no one else new about this for now,’ and I said, ‘That’s fine,’ and then we went into the library to do some work, and—” Now Sherlock was the one frowning. The memory was there, but it wasn’t quite right. John simply let him think his way through it. “Oh,” he said after a long moment. “The library. But we don’t have a library.”
John quirked an eyebrow up and laughed. “Right, so you meant to run into a tree.”
Only he wasn’t drunk.
“If I earned points in this ridiculous game for the true artistic interpretation of these words, I would have absolutely no problem,” Sherlock muttered, tossing the pen to John.
, in ways that were not wholly platonic, and he was still so in awe of it that he couldn’t allow himself to think about it for too long, lest he risk his mental capabilities for the next several minutes.
Sherlock pretended to think for a moment. “It might.” John could feel him smiling against his skin.
“Good morning,” John said. He was once again sitting on the edge of Sherlock’s bed. He had changed since the last time Sherlock had seen him.

Sherlock had perched himself on the little bit of counter space beside the sink to ensure that he had a good view of John working.

“There’s three types of monkeys that live around here,” John told them as they made their way down one of the easier trails. He found that hiking along it was much less time-consuming in the absence of his limp. “You’ve got spider monkeys, white-faced capuchins, and mantled howlers.”
Sherlock glanced over to where John typically sat.  Sarah was still there, clearly trying to pretend like she wasn’t watching the two of them interact.  Nearly all of the other tables in the room were empty. None of this was making sense.
“Is that so?”  The man clearly didn’t believe him.

John stopped kissing his mouth, his lips instead trailing down Sherlock’s neck. “You’re close, aren’t you?” he murmured against Sherlock’s throat. “I’ll bet you haven’t gotten yourself off in
John squeezed his hand and leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I’d be perfectly happy to never go to a night out again. We can just stay in and have sex instead, and while they’re all out together, they’ll know what we’re doing, and it’ll have the same effect as what we did tonight.”

“You’ve been denying me all week,” Seb said lightheartedly when Sherlock reached them.  “Come on, you’ve got to do your trick now.  None of these guys here believe you can actually do it.”
The alien looked back at him, blinked, and then said, “All right.”
. Sherlock pretended to ignore her. She apparently thought better of trying to bring it up with him right then, as she remained silent. Sherlock was glad for that. Standing so close to the entrance of the building meant they ran the risk of being overheard by any rugby players who were in the immediate area.
Sherlock hummed dazedly and slowly rolled themselves over. Their cock was flagging and covered in ejaculate (greyer than human ejaculate, he noted distantly). Their eyes were partially closed, and their usually haughty demeanor was hazy around the edges now. “Let me help,” they murmured, and they shimmied down the bed a bit so that John was straddling their stomach. They wrapped one hand around John’s on his cock. Realistically, it wasn’t all that much help, but just having Sherlock’s hand touching him, even overtop his own hand, was enough to bring John that much closer to the edge.

Sherlock’s anger over the injustice was downgraded to minor irritation. His own hands, which had still been pointing in displeasure at the picture, settled around John’s shoulders.
And everything was a bit perfect, and even Sherlock had to admit that ‘happily ever after’ did seem to be where they were heading.)

“Amazing,” John breathed, and when Sherlock turned to look at the man, he was shocked at the awe in his expression. It was so poignant that it made his cheeks heat a bit.
“Idiot,” he muttered scathingly to himself.
The library, it turned out, housed many treasures, but none quite so great as John Watson.

“Can you eat this?”
There was a groan from across the table. “Get a room,” someone muttered, but neither Sherlock nor John seemed to hear.
I’m going to start charging a consulting fee, because we really can’t just live off of your savings.”
There was a slight pause.  When Molly spoke again, her tone had changed drastically.  “He actually ditched you the morning after? That bastard.”

“Well,” John muttered, “you don’t need to worry about them any longer. They’re going back.”
Sherlock smiled timidly then, turning toward him once more. “I’m—er, likewise,” they said.

Sherlock stared at him for a moment, expression guarded, before he seemed to decide that John wasn’t trying to be cruel. A slow, barely there smile tugged up at his lips. “It might have something to do with that, yes,” he conceded. “The tackling isn’t terrible to watch, either.”
“Never have I ever taken hard drugs.” That was another sip and now five fingers up for Sherlock.
From that point on, Sherlock and John would enter the library together every weekday at two o’clock, hand in hand.  The first time they had done that, Seb Wilkes had almost commented. He’d gotten as far as opening his mouth and taking a breath before John was glaring at him.  “Talk to Sherlock again, and I’ll break your fucking nose,” he had said, voice deathly low.  Wilkes had seemed offended at the threat, but he apparently believed it, as he hadn’t tried speaking to Sherlock since.  Sherlock hadn’t realised how much he had dreaded interacting with Seb until it had all stopped.
He checked the time on his phone. It was well past the time John’s flight landed, and yet the man hadn’t texted. Sherlock had a brief moment of panic, thinking that perhaps John simply wasn’t going to speak to him at all. Their relationship started with the unexpected arrival of a text, and it was going to end with the absence of an expected text. Or possibly John had gotten injured, and Sherlock hadn’t gone to fetch him from the airport, and now it was his fault that John was in some terrible situation, and Sherlock was never going to forgive himself, and—

Sherlock didn’t entirely relax, and he seemed to grow more closed off when talking to the others. He remained relatively open with John, though, so that felt like a success regardless.  He only hoped he could keep it up for the rest of the night.
I meant to ask, what was so important that you wouldn’t take cases last week?  I popped by your flat on Wednesday, and your landlady said you had company over.  Anything you’d like to share?
At that, Sherlock had stopped arguing, and he’d ducked his head away to hide a smile. John counted that as another success on his part for the night.
He felt his cheeks heat, and he dropped his face into his hands. “This is utterly embarrassing,” he mumbled, and John just laughed playfully.

Sherlock tried to glare at him, but he found that he was having a rather difficult time making the look as biting as it normally was. “Why don’t I put my mouth near your erection and see how eager you get?” he returned, proud of himself for getting all of the words out coherently.
“Was that a bird, or was that the others?” Sarah asked, as if she didn’t already know the sound of every bird in the forest.
John laughed. “Of course, love.” He knelt down beside the bed so that he was eye level with Sherlock again, and he kissed them sweetly and deeply. “In that case, I’m going to make this so good for you,” he murmured when he pulled back. “Take off your trousers.” He straightened up and watched as Sherlock hastened to comply. They sat directly in the middle of the bed when they were finished, looking over at John expectantly.
Sherlock was having heart palpitations again, he was sure. “What am I supposed to do, then?” he asked.  “I’m nowhere near prepared for a date, if that even is what this is.”
(“The DI called
And yet, his stomach turned as he conjured up Sherlock’s expression just before he’d left—so full of disappointment, pain, sadness. John felt like a monster for putting that look there, even if he didn’t know what he’d done to make it happen.
She smiled sympathetically back. “Don’t worry about it,” she replied, her high, thin voice grating on him. She put on what must have been intended as a coy expression and added, “You could text me sometime, maybe, and we could pick up this conversation.”
Sherlock didn’t see how that would be a problem. He had always been criticised for being selfish, prompting other people to commiserate with John for having to put up with him all the time. John himself had been upset that Sherlock’s selfish desire to keep John in London with him had caused so many arguments after he’d gone to Afghanistan. “So you don’t want me to focus on you?” Sherlock asked, not seeing how that would solve any of their issues.

that you have. Mine simply aren’t waving around all the time.”
Sherlock shrugged. “You’re at least as bad as I am if you’re content to spend time with me.”
John remained standing over the suspect, although he glanced back in Sherlock’s direction, his expression softening a bit. He reached one hand out and said, “Come here.”
John broke the kiss, tearing an involuntary whine from Sherlock, and murmured, “God, the things you do to me.” He kissed and bit his way down Sherlock’s neck, all the while grinding their hips together, and,

John almost felt bad when he took the kettle off the stove and poured the water over the teabag that was settled in his mug.
Sherlock glared over at Mrs. Hudson. “Don’t you dare answer that,” he threatened.
[4:57PM] Of course you did. You weren’t the one professing love the morning after the second date. JW
[12:40AM] I just wish you were here. SH
John looked at the calendar tacked to the kitchen wall. There were only seven days crossed out for that month. Seven days since Sherlock had arrived. (He hadn’t bothered keeping track of the passing time before Sherlock, and he tried not to think too hard about the significance of that.)
Sherlock could feel his face heating, and he wasn’t sure what had caused it. He blamed it on the heat, even though they were now crossing the threshold back onto the pavement in the cool, rainy air.
, this was heaven. Sherlock had never been so attracted to the person kissing him before, and it left him feeling dizzier than he could ever remember being. He let out a noise as John licked into his mouth, no trace of that chaste first kiss lingering between them now. It was intoxicating and deep and unbearably sensual.
Sherlock grimaced. It was a talent, a skill, not a trick. “I hardly have time right now.” It was a lie, of course, but he couldn’t be bothered to put up with Seb at the moment. Before the man could get a reply out, Sherlock made his way behind a tall shelf, putting the front desk out of sight.
“What?”
“I’m capable of covering my own meal,” Sherlock had argued.
Hours later, sulk completed, Sherlock glanced up from the only book at the research base that didn’t have anything to do with monkeys. They frowned. “Are all human relationships heterosexual?” they asked.
John didn’t miss the fact that SH didn’t claim that boyfriends weren’t his area. He was ridiculously pleased by that. So, his mysterious man was single and gay. Not that it mattered, of course, but John couldn’t deny the way his heart started beating faster with that knowledge.
“I’ll watch what I’m saying when your little sideshow date does the same,” Wilkes spat.
This sudden concern about my ability to swallow—are you thinking back to our night together?
Sherlock felt a shy smile unfurling on his lips.  “You’ve got a bit of flour just…there.”  He pointed toward John’s cheek, where a bit of the stuff had gathered.  “And there’s some on your sleeves as well.  A bakery seemed the most likely option.”
Your confidence in me is, as ever, inspiring.
John raised his eyebrows but didn’t look too outwardly shocked. “Are we finally going to talk about this, then?” he asked after a long pause.
[6:17AM] Don’t go telling people that. SH
John huffed out a laugh that wasn’t entirely amused. “I guess we really don’t do well with the whole long-distance thing.”
About a week later, John was struck with the impulse to text SH again. Well, fine, it had actually been a constant impulse since their first conversation had ended, but it was only a week later that he finally had a proper excuse to do it.
Sherlock’s response, when it came, was less enthusiastic than John might have hoped, but he was still so pleased at the fact that they were actually talking to one another that he hardly cared.
“How do you know?” Sherlock asked, and he was in the dark so rarely about these things that the words felt strange as he spoke them.
[1:19AM] No, you’ll just sacrifice your life to save someone else, and you won’t think about me while making the decision to do that, either. SH
Sherlock rolled his eyes and tried to ignore the way John’s laugh made him feel. “If you didn’t write it, then by the process of elimination, it must have been one of the ones I wrote down. We’re the only two people playing.” He gestured around the empty flat as if demonstrating for John that there was, in fact, no one else around. John had told him that Pictionary was usually played with more than two people, and Sherlock had asked him if he knew of anyone he wanted to invite over to play, and John had agreed that, no, they really didn’t need anyone else taking up their time together, so they had settled into this rather poor imitation of the game. Six days into John’s leave, they were running out of ideas on how to entertain one another, clearly, but Sherlock at least took heart in the fact that John hadn’t yet grown bored of his presence.
“Incredible,” John said, loving the way Sherlock’s skin seemed to glow again after every compliment. He hoped that people would simply assume it was a trick of the lighting. “How did you learn to pick up on all of that?”
Sherlock stared down at the shattered phone before lifting his head with concentrated effort to see what had happened to his suspect.
After that, there was no trace of any of the softness of their earlier kisses. No, from that point on, it was pure, carnal passion. John gripped his wrists in one hand like he’d done on the sofa and propped one of Sherlock’s legs on his good shoulder. He used his other hand to brace himself above the other man as he pounded into him. John set a fast, brutal rhythm that left Sherlock positively howling at every brush against his prostate. John’s every breath was punctuated with, “
It wasn’t long before Sherlock’s noises started to get louder, until they were outright moaning, “
Subject: RE: You never do this
Finally, after about an hour, his phone buzzed.
The signs were all there.  John’s impeccable appearance, her obvious comfort with him, the way they looked at one another.  They were dating, Sherlock concluded, and he really felt like he was going to retch. God, he had been so foolish. How had he let himself believe that John Watson might actually be interested in
holding his hand. In public, no less. The night before, Sherlock had been thrilled that John had touched his hip when they were out in the open, but this—this was so much better.  This blurred the boundaries between strictly platonic and something more, and Sherlock knew that it was dangerous to allow it to continue.
John did something particularly clever with his tongue, and Sherlock shouted, hips jerking up off of the bed. John’s finger slipped from his mouth, as John apparently decided that it wasn’t worth the effort to try to stifle him any longer. One of John’s hands pressed down on his hip to keep him from moving about too much, and the other one—
Sherlock leaned forward and pressed a tentative kiss to John’s lips, still not entirely sure that it would be welcome. While much of the initial awkwardness regarding the state of their relationship had dissipated, there had been no move on John’s part thus far to bring them to the full extent of what they had been before he’d left.
“You bastard,” Matty shouted, lunging for Bernard, who seemed interested in going after Sherlock.
“You really like me?” he asked, a tad breathless. Startling as it was, Sherlock had meant for it to sound more like a statement than a question.  He was still having a difficult time believing it.
From: Sherlock Holmes <sh@thescienceofdeduction.co.uk>
“Like that, do you?” John panted as he inched in further.
John worried about the answer. If SH turned out to be older than thirty, this little half-crush might be unworthy of future pursuits. That would certainly be disappointing.
That was disappointing, and Sherlock had made a fool of himself by bringing this whole thing up in the first place. He set his untouched tea on the coffee table and slouched down so that he could curl himself up facing the back of the sofa. God, he was an idiot, and John didn’t want to move in with him, and maybe this relationship wasn’t going that well after all. For John, this could have merely been a casual fling, just something to pass the time, and yet Sherlock had gone and gotten deeply invested in it, making it out to be something greater than it was. Idiot, idiot, idiot—

“No, we don’t,” John helpfully supplied.
He pulled back after a few moments, barely able to do that now that Sherlock was apparently getting the hang of the act of kissing, and he pressed their foreheads together. “Christ, I could do that all night,” he murmured.
“How’re you feeling?” John asked when Sherlock returned the remaining water to him.
“Why are you telling me this?” John asked, feeling a bit lost.
They had been dating for a little over a month when Sherlock brought it up again. He was fairly certain that their relationship was going well. John hadn’t left in a fit of terror at discovering the eyeballs in the microwave, nor had his sexual desire for Sherlock diminished at all, as evidenced by the fact that they slept together at least four times a week. As of yet, Sherlock hadn’t managed to screw it all up. It seemed like the perfect time to call John’s attention to the fact that, in spite of their prospering relationship, John still hadn’t moved all his things over to Baker Street.
“We are here together,” John pointed out.

Sherlock just stared at him with that same stunned expression. Their skin, which had gone back to the pale humanoid tone, started to look slightly purple.
.  Claimed by John Watson, no less.  He rocked his hips forward on instinct, his moan growing louder as he felt John’s arousal there.
John chucked a piece of bread at them. He was surprised to find that he was only moderately amused rather than genuinely affronted at the generalization about his entire species. “Careful how you talk about humans, or this human might just leave you outside with the monkeys all night.”
“Stop that.  You’re supposed to be helping me, not making fun of me.”
The timer buzzed, and Sherlock stood up from his seat, feeling victorious. He smoothed out his shirt smugly.

John sounded so displeased that Sherlock immediately sought to clarify, despite not knowing what ‘these things’ were. “No, I’m not.”
“I never pace myself,” Sherlock informed him.

John must have noticed his silence, because he wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and held him tightly. “I’m going to miss you, too, you know,” he said, dropping a kiss into Sherlock’s curls.
Sherlock watched as the teams assembled into some kind of formation, likely indicating that the match was about to start.  Much to his surprise, John glanced up at the stands as he took his place. The rugby captain smiled brightly and waved when he caught sight of Sherlock.  Sherlock felt his cheeks heat a bit as he waved back, hoping in vain that Molly had missed the gesture.
temporarily occupied.
John smiled and accepted the umbrella readily. It looked like the sort of thing a child would pick out—all bright colours and convoluted patterns—but it was certainly not something one would picture Sherlock with. John had merely assumed that Sherlock, with their near-emotionless nature and occasional coldness, would simply choose something plain and black. When Sherlock went over to look at all the gossip magazines in the shop, John decided that perhaps he didn’t know them nearly as well as he’d thought.

Almost simultaneously, the two of them broke out into a fit of giggles. John collapsed down on the bed next to Sherlock, and Sherlock rolled over so that they could kiss John again. They only broke apart when their smiles got too big to allow for it any longer.
“In the article, it said that the only suspicious activity found at the scene were chips of green paint on either side of the gravel pathway.  It’s

John turned back around to face Sherlock, putting them
Sherlock made a face. “I don’t work for Scotland Yard, and as I’m already clever enough to solve crimes, I don’t see the need to wait until I’m older to start putting my skills to use.”
“No, I guess you wouldn’t.”  John knocked back a bit more of his whiskey.  “So, what do you do for fun, Sherlock?”
She hadn’t.  She smacked him in the arm, a grin in place on her features.  “Oh, my god,” she whispered.  “I can’t believe you’ve got the hots for John Watson!”
you wouldn’t take cases last week? I popped
“Yes.”
Sherlock picked up his fork and twirled it around amidst the pasta he’d apparently ordered.  “Thank you,” he murmured, smiling faintly, cheeks still pink due to the topic at hand.
“Nothing,” she said. “Just wondering how much longer until John comes to his senses and gets out.”
“What took you so long?” she demanded as he sat beside her. “I’ve been sitting here for nearly twenty minutes by myself.  It was starting to look rather pathetic.”
Is it? I hadn’t noticed.
Sherlock barely refrained from rolling his eyes.  Really, with the man offering things like that, it was no wonder he and Molly hadn’t done much of anything yet.  “I’ll pass,” he said, walking away before Lestrade could make any more idiotic offers.  He glanced back over his shoulder to watch the two of them talk, both blushing lightly and smiling. It was ridiculous. He would have called it disgusting if he hadn’t been slightly jealous of what they had.
Even though John had essentially been calling him those sweet names non-stop, nothing additional had happened between them, not even when John had brought dinner over for them both last time. They had merely eaten together quickly on the sofa before John set to work on sweeping up the shards of ceramic on his kitchen floor. Because neither of them were keen on talking about whatever this was, it seemed to Sherlock that the intimacy was just going to be slowly increased until—well, until
“You hooked up with someone last night?” Wilkes’ girlfriend asked, voice low. “I knew it. I knew that thing about needing to study was bullshit.”
[2:44AM] I know they did, and when I get my hands on Mycroft, I’m going to kill him for making you worry. JW
John stared at him for a moment, seemingly steeling himself, before he licked his lips and slowly advanced, like a predator stalking its prey. “You could always repay me in some
, Sherlock thought to himself, and he dropped his eyes from the ceiling over to John, who had taken up residence on the part of the sofa unoccupied by Sherlock’s legs. “You still haven’t moved your things in,” he pointed out. He scooted up the sofa until his back was propped against the armrest. He grabbed his mug and held it between his hands, letting it warm him.
comfortable with John, given the fact that her hand remained on his shoulder even as he turned around to face her.
John nodded, crawling onto the bed now. “Yes, I do. Absolutely gorgeous. Breathtaking. Out of this world.” He moved until he’d resumed his earlier position on top of Sherlock. He pressed a few soft kisses to Sherlock’s neck, his cheeks, his lips, before passion began to seep in.
John stared at him in open amazement. Sherlock was rarely that forward, in his experience, and he could only assume this meant that Sherlock was finally warming up to him. “Oh, God, yes,” he breathed, and he leaned up to press their lips together again, unable to survive without another kiss.
And what was to come, it turned out, was John looking him up and down for a long moment. John’s eyes still held that fire, that intensity, and then, before Sherlock registered what was happening, John pounced.
Sherlock nodded once and broke their embrace as he strode purposefully over toward the bedroom.
“You’re already thinking that far ahead?” he asked, amazed that Sherlock really saw that much of a future with him, that Sherlock had been imagining this future for quite some time now. His basic training was still a few years off yet, after all, and they’d only just now agreed to date properly.
There was a prim sniff from the other end of the line. “Right. Well, in that case, they will have immediately deduced that I was the caller. They do so love to defy me. They hated life back home, and they wouldn’t go back just because I want them to.”

like him—don’t get that sort of happy ending. He had really, truly believed them, which made it all the more surprising when John made it clear on that first night that they were—for all intents and purposes—in a romantic relationship, albeit a temporary one. John held his hand constantly when they went out, kissed his cheek whenever the urge arose, snogged him up against every piece of furniture in the flat. John told him that he was beautiful and perfect. John brushed his hair out of his face in the morning and cooked him breakfast and acted interested in his work and experiments.
John didn’t even hesitate, just reached out and grabbed Wilkes by the collar from across the table. Other patrons were staring, and John knew that the only reason the whole group hadn’t been kicked out by now was because the owner was known to like them well enough. “Do not ever talk to him again,” John growled. “You’re not good enough to be in the same room as him. Get your things and
John couldn’t help but smile wider. So Sherlock liked an army man. That was certainly good to know. It didn’t quite explain in John’s mind why Sherlock clammed up whenever the topic of the military arose in their conversations, but he made a note to just ask Sherlock about that later.

A soldier, huh?
Sherlock reached out and grabbed hold of John’s hand where it lay on the seat between them. John, for his part, didn’t seem shocked by the sudden move and merely turned his palm over so that he could intertwine their fingers. And just like that, Sherlock knew that whatever this was between them would need to be addressed soon.
“I’d offer you some, but I’m worried I might inadvertently end up killing you if I do,” John said, and the alien merely gave what appeared to be aggravated clicks in reply. “What’s gotten you so upset? Are you mad that I took your friend away?” He laughed lightly but had to admit that it had been rather cute watching them try to communicate with boiling water.
that was very good.)
“Not impossible,” Molly countered.  “Trust me, this is definitely a date.  Did he flirt with you at all when you saw him?”
He sat up, fully preparing to wallow in self-pity for the rest of the morning in his disgusting flat in this disgusting state, when he noticed a slip of paper on his other pillow.
Sherlock ducked his head.  “I wasn’t sure if you considered last night to be a mistake.”
In the end, he settled on wearing a pair of dark jeans (tight, because he did want to be at least a little bit provocative) and a charcoal button-up (also tight, with the buttons undone slightly more than usual). It wasn’t his flashiest outfit by far, but it would show off his body without giving him the appearance of trying too hard (hopefully).
John’s face did a complicated thing right then, settling into an uncomfortable grimace. “You’re really going to make me actually talk about these things, aren’t you?”
When the game ended, Sherlock didn’t leave immediately as he had told Molly he would.  The players had left the field to shower in the nearby locker room, and Molly was determined to stick around until Lestrade came out.  Sherlock told himself that he was merely waiting there to keep her company, which was mostly true.  It also had something to do with the fact that it was easier to hide certain, over-active parts of his anatomy while sitting down.
John huffed out a surprised laugh and smiled broadly over at him, and Sherlock decided that he had absolutely made the right call. “Good,” John murmured, and before Sherlock could even think of a response, their lips were pressed together.
Sherlock grimaced. He hadn’t actually paid much attention to what he had done to the flat in order to get it into a state worthy of John’s expertise. “I have no idea how that got down there,” he said, jutting his chin out with pride he didn’t feel.
As he got older, he could feel himself standing out from the other children a bit more.  He was too loud at times and too quiet at others.  He was too curious, and his parents indulged that too much.  He often felt like he wasn’t speaking the same language as the other kids, and he hated it.
“Never have I ever invited my partner to watch a documentary on bees as part of a date-night,” John said, and there were a few chuckles from around the table as Sherlock grumpily took a sip of his drink.
John was silent for a long moment, and Sherlock wanted so desperately to look over at him, but he couldn’t blow their cover.
“Are you all right?” Molly asked him. He had almost forgotten that she was beside him.  “You look a little flushed.”
“Girl troubles?” Mike had asked.
He had been drugged.
[3:53AM] Unless you want to stop. JW
John was on his way back from the village, where he’d purchased a bottle of beer for lack of anything better, when he started to feel guilty. He supposed he couldn’t really blame Sherlock for being a member of an unfeeling species. Beyond that, Sherlock was hardly unfeeling. John recalled the way Sherlock had looked at the howlers the day prior. All that awe and wide-eyed fascination. Beyond that, what sociopath left an entire planet for the sake of seeing dogs and bees?
Sherlock shrugged. “That was one of the few things I was good at back home,” they said. “I couldn’t do it here until I learned more about your Earth culture, though, so I was limited in my abilities until just now.”

“Sometimes. They used to not take me seriously when I went down there, but recently, they’ve been a bit better. Last week I even gave a DI my information so he could contact me again if he needs help.”  Sherlock couldn’t help the pride in his voice.
John had tried holding his hand across the table at first, but Sherlock had needed to shuffle the file around before him, so John eventually let him have both of his hands free.  Instead, John’s legs were pressed up against his own under the table, a subtle, reassuring point of contact.
“Of course I am,” Sherlock muttered.

The door to 221A opened almost as soon as they entered the building, though Sherlock had already made a mad dash up the stairs. John wasn’t quite as fast, and, besides, he was curious as to what Sherlock’s neighbour was like.

John was right. This was going to be a proper business, and they had a proper relationship and a proper home, and they were really, properly happy. It was all of the things Sherlock had never really dared to imagine for himself, and it was all happening. He felt like it was too good to be true sometimes, but that was all right, because when he looked over at John, he could tell that John was thinking the same thing. They had carved out a space for themselves in that too-good-to-be-true future, and they were settling in there for good.
“I want you inside of me,” he said, and while he’d tried to make it sound sexy, he only ended up coming off needy. He was too turned on to care.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up, and their antennae twitched excitedly, and John had to take a few deep breaths to get himself under control.
John didn’t look convinced. “Don’t care. I still wouldn’t have allowed it.” His expression dissolved into that cocky smirk Sherlock had become so familiar with during John’s courting of him. “You asked me to call you ‘baby’ after that. Do you remember that?”
“Yeah, that’s good,” John breathed, pulling Sherlock’s hips down. When Sherlock got the hint and started moving against John on his own, John murmured, “Yeah, just like that. So good.”

Lestrade nodded. “Just found him.” He paused for a moment, as if getting up the nerve to add, “Will you come?” He clearly hated asking for help from someone like Sherlock, a relatively young former drug user and all around unpleasant man, but at least he had enough sense to know that it was better to seek Sherlock’s help than let a murderer go free. That was more than could be said about half of Lestrade’s colleagues.

As they waited for John and Lestrade to finish their showers, Sherlock tried to ensure that he still looked presentable.  He smoothed his hair down and did the same with his shirt. He wondered if Molly had a mirror on hand.  That would have certainly been useful right then.
“No need to thank me, love.”
“You were going to be a soldier,” he blurted out, because his mind, in its current addled state, was only capable of repeating back the last deductions it had made.
That did it. Sherlock was still tense, and he didn’t look up, but he did sigh, and after a moment longer, he spoke. “I find military men attractive for a number of reasons. It’s a dangerous profession, which makes them moderately quick on their feet, resourceful, and strong. I like all of that.” He lifted his head at last and made eye contact with John. “But, with you—well, it’s easy to adore military men from a distance, but it’s decidedly harder to cope with the danger of it when you’re fond of one of them.”
Sherlock licked his palm and reached down to wrap his hand around John’s cock. The movement of John’s fingers in his arse stuttered to a halt as Sherlock tentatively began to stroke. He had never done this with someone else before, and the angle was odd. He decided that if he couldn’t pleasure John with his hand just yet, he could certainly do it another way.

Sherlock had only ever had a bit of wine before, despite being twenty years old. Drinking had simply never come up, as he usually avoided the kinds of situations in which alcohol consumption was prevalent.  “Rum,” he said at last, not really sure which would be better.
John smacked him in the arm but kept smiling, even as he took a sip and held another one of his fingers up.
Sherlock was fairly confident that he knew what John was referring to, so he nodded. This tension between them and the continual flirting couldn’t have just been his imagination.
Sherlock’s hands slowly crept down his chest before reaching his trousers. At that point, Sherlock, cheeks tinged blue, looked up at him. “May I?” they asked, and John would have teased them at their sudden politeness if he hadn’t been so turned on.
Subject: RE: You never do this
For half his life, Sherlock had believed that he could never have this, and John had come along and given it to him without prompting. Even though he knew that this wasn’t a real relationship (there had been no discussion of feelings or commitments, and John had never indicated that he wanted this to last), Sherlock couldn’t fight the sliver of hope that had bloomed in his chest that maybe, when John returned for good, this thing between them could develop into one.
Sherlock found himself blushing ridiculously at the way John was talking. It wasn’t even that obscene, but it seemed like an enactment of fantasies he hadn’t even known he had. Another moan was startled out of him as he pressed down, getting the pressure just right.
“Well, lead the way,” Sherlock said.
The worst part was, though, that he would keep doing it. He would keep trying and keep trying to get accepted into their ranks, to be recognised by his peers. He had been denied that all his life, but, oh, how he wanted it.

. He held his hands out to his sides and spun around to give John the full effect. He was wearing a navy suit with a simple white shirt underneath, and although he knew he looked presentable, he wasn’t sure how well this look would fit in with the rest of their companions at the pub.
He forgot all about his own body as soon as John’s was revealed. “Oh,” he breathed, eyes going wide as he took in the sight before him. John was…big. Bigger than average, certainly, and thicker, too. Sherlock’s mouth watered. He needed that inside of him.

Sherlock frowned.  “You’ve got an exam to study for.  You’ve been moaning about it for weeks.  You need to study.”
Twenty. That was actually not a bad age for SH in comparison to John himself. He would be twenty-four in a few months, but even four years was hardly that big of a difference, especially not with someone as clever as this man appeared to be.
Close to ten minutes had passed by the time John walked out of the building. (Nine minutes and forty-eight seconds, but who was counting?)  He was smiling, his hair still damp.  He had changed out of his gear and into a pair of dark jeans and a beige T-shirt. Despite its plain colour, the shirt clung to the musculature of his torso in ridiculously pleasant ways. Sherlock forced himself not to stare.
Mike had convinced him to go out to a pub by their shared flat, and John was desperate to get a leg over. The girl he was talking to (Sarah? Shannon? Sam?) was nice enough, if a bit dim. She started the conversation by asking after his zodiac sign, and from that point on, he’d mentally checked out.

Anyway, here's the first half of John and Sherlock's date!  I was working on writing a longer chapter encompassing their entire night together which is why it's taken so long also (I've had this section written for like two weeks but thought I was gonna add more), but I decided to just break it up into two chapters, so you'll notice that the total chapter count has gone from seven to eight.

John laughed and kissed Sherlock’s curls a few times. “I’m wounded, Sherlock, really.”

Sherlock lifted their head up. “It really wasn’t difficult. I was able to deduce a few key bits of information about her husband from the advertisement she posted online,” they said, “and after that, she was eager to give me a reduced rate.”
Sherlock tore their eyes away from John’s cock with noticeable reluctance. “My mouth?” they repeated. That seemed to give them an idea, though, and they stuck their tongue out to lick carefully at the head.

Victor would invite him over, always under the guise of helping one another study (Sherlock was clever enough to be taking advanced courses), and he taught Sherlock all about carnal pleasure.  They never went very far, as Sherlock was still largely terrified of all of that.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up at that. They were apparently so excited at the prospect of a cobbler that they tried to get John to just skip dinner altogether and jump straight into dessert. John tried to remind himself that Sherlock had no idea that moving straight to dessert had certain sexual implications on some societies.

Some of his rugby mates had roped John into going out to dinner with them after their match. Of course, these particular mates all happened to be dating at the moment, leaving John the only one without a partner in attendance. Bored and feeling out of place, John figured that this was as good a time as any to try to strike up another conversation with SH.

There was another hoot farther ahead of him, right where the tree had fallen.
John furrowed his brow. “You’ve never…had sex?” he asked.
Sherlock knew he had brought this on himself. A few days prior, Donovan had come to him for help—a rare thing for her to do—and he had been so preoccupied with John that he had (perhaps rudely) refused to look at the case she was offering. It seemed that Donovan, when upset, reacted much in the same way that a wild animal might, by lashing out at the thing that had caused her pain. In this case, that thing was Sherlock, and he had a feeling that it was only going to get worse.
Subject: RE: You never do this
“Wait,” John cut in, voice firm in a way that made Sherlock immediately fall silent. “Why did you think I want this to be a secret?”
The last time they had argued about that particular topic, John had ignored Sherlock for two days, gotten shot, and had ended up in hospital. Sherlock immediately felt ill. He was getting used to that feeling now, as it had been plaguing him since that argument. “No,” he rushed to say. “No, we’re not.” He turned away, trying to find something safe to do, something to show John that he regretted everything. “Are you hungry?” he asked. He made his way into the kitchen and began looking through the fridge for anything that was pre-made that he could heat up for John.

Really? I was starting to think you’d decided against it. For how long?
“If you didn’t want your wife to be upset, you shouldn’t have hired me to find her missing jewelry,” Sherlock pointed out. The man had clearly thought that his decision to hire a consulting detective would absolve him of any guilt in his wife’s eyes, and he severely underestimated Sherlock’s intelligence.

John frowned. He stared at Sherlock, then at the cashier, and then back at Sherlock. “How could you
,” John murmured when he pulled back. Sherlock started to look a bit self-conscious, so John trailed kisses up their neck to their lips. “It’s hot,” he added.
Sherlock hummed noncommittally, barely processing what John was saying. He was too busy hunched over his laptop, trying to sort out the best possible arrangement for the business cards he was going to make for them.
The soldier-turned-handyman exited the cab first when they pulled up outside of a brightly lit bar called Vitality, and Sherlock was grateful that at least John had let him pay for the fare, even if he had so steadfastly refused compensation for his services.
Sherlock looked pleased at the praise, as he always did, and turned away from the mess on the coffee table to face John fully. “Your nails are meticulously clean. So are your clothes. The lines in them indicate that they’re folded with precision before you wear them. They’re not expensive, but you take care of them. That indicates a long-standing personal habit of ordered cleanliness. A man like that wouldn’t have a messy flat.”
Sherlock hummed noncommittally, his head resting on John’s chest. He shut his eyes. In the morning, his pants would be sticky and uncomfortable with dried ejaculate.  In the morning, he would need to actually process what had just happened. In the morning, he wouldn’t have the haze of alcohol guiding him through.
A waiter came over to take their orders, but Sherlock was far too distracted to even pay attention to what he ordered.  As soon as the waiter stepped away from their table, Sherlock looked back at John.
He tried to ignore the way the simple contact between them instantly unfurled the tension in his chest.
But then John was there, in full view, and Sherlock took in his war-wearied face, his awkward gait, his hair that had grown out a bit beyond the standard military length. John looked tired. He was tanner than he’d been when he left. His hands seemed more calloused as well. He seemed to have lost some of his muscle weight since being shot, but he was still as slim and as fit as he’d been when they’d first met. The cane didn’t bear his weight when he was standing, but he leaned on it heavily when he walked. The bag slung over his right shoulder was almost immediately dropped to the floor, as if it had been excruciating holding it up.
In which John and Sherlock text.
John jumped, not used to seeing another person in his room, and fought the ridiculous urge to cover himself up. He was glad he didn’t sleep totally naked. “Christ,” he said, rubbing a hand over his eyes. “This is generally considered to be a bit not good.” The noise of the howlers in the background died down. John pointed toward the door. “Go occupy yourself with something else for a few more hours. I’m going back to sleep.”
Sherlock continued smiling down at his mobile for a full minute before he remembered that he was meant to be using that time to be getting ready. He pocketed the device and turned his attention back to his appearance.
John stared at him and licked his lips. Sherlock unconsciously followed the movement with his eyes. “Right,” John said. He nodded once. “Right.” And then he dropped the wrench that had been in his hand so that it clattered onto the tile, and he advanced on Sherlock with a fire in his eyes akin to that seen in predators right before they pounced on prey.
John let out another laugh at that, and he was pleased to see Sherlock chuckling a bit in return. “Yes, you do,” he said, and he kissed Sherlock deeply once more, just for the sake of it. “Now, how about you lie on your stomach, and I’ll get to work on making this good for you.” John felt that he owed Sherlock the best first time ever. Not only was Sherlock amazing and more than deserving of that, but they had also gotten their feelings rather hurt over John’s actions earlier. He wanted to banish any thought in their mind that they were unwanted here.
Sherlock’s awed expression made John’s heart kick in his chest. “You’ve got too many to count,” they reiterated, obviously fascinated.
“I certainly see yours,” Sherlock muttered in reply.
Stamford stumbled towards the two of them, and John immediately reached out to steady his friend. “Had a bit too much to drink there?” he asked, taking in the obvious inebriation on his ineffective wingman.
Subject: RE: You never do this
It wasn’t long before Sherlock felt himself start to get hard. While a bit embarrassing, especially given the fact that he was pressed up against John, he was actually rather proud that he’d managed to stave off his arousal for this long. He tilted his hips back a bit to disguise his situation, but John wordlessly pulled him forward again, his arm behind Sherlock’s back preventing any additional attempts to retreat. Sherlock’s cheeks began to heat as his erection pressed firmly against John’s hip.
“It’s all right, love,” he murmured. “I’ve got a bit of a crush on you, too.” That was certainly an understatement, but it was as much about his emotional state as he was willing to reveal.
John hated that Sherlock’s personality was rather sweet in person as well, because it made it that much more difficult to get a grip on this big-and-growing-bigger crush. “Want another cup?” John asked, gesturing to the aggrieving mug. “I should probably get some for myself.” They were ostensibly meant to be having coffee, judging by Sherlock’s choice of meeting location.

[3:49AM] Are we still boyfriends? SH
“I’m fairly confident I can eat everything you eat,” Sherlock said.
“How much?” he asked, prepared to pay any amount. Granted, he didn’t exactly know what amount was considered ‘normal’ to pay a repairman for three hours of work on most of the kitchen appliances, so John could have named literally any price without Sherlock picking up on the validity of it.
He cursed under his breath and hoped he hadn’t driven away the most interesting thing to ever happen to him.
[1:01AM] I think you just don’t want there to be evidence that you’re in love. JW
[4:32PM] And why would we need make-up sex? Are you expecting us to fight or break up? SH
Sherlock frowned at that. “Did he now,” they murmured. “Well, I wasn’t expecting that, but no matter. I’ll take care of it.”
, Sherlock thought for perhaps the millionth time that evening.
“Yeah,” John said with a soft smile. “I think so, too.”
Sherlock shrugged, picking up a slice of toast and tearing off a small piece of it for himself. “Sometimes. She thinks I don’t eat enough.”
John laughed, a high, pleased giggle, and Sherlock positively melted underneath him. John leaned down to press a kiss to Sherlock’s nose. “Well, we’ll just have to move things along, then.” He stripped his jacket off, leaving only his vest covering his chest.
Why did you sign up for this in the first place?

“Excuse me, sir, but where do you think you’re going?”
John grinned over at them. “Mycroft also talked to me about your parents,” he mentioned. “He seemed to think that you’d gotten grand ideas of romance because of them.” Sherlock looked a bit caught-out, and John smirked. “He hinted that you might have gone and gotten attached to me.”
And it did.
God, somehow talking about this with Molly was about as embarrassing as it would have been to bring it up with his mother.  “Yes,” he muttered at last, because while Sherlock had remained fully clothed the whole time, and while John had been the one to bring himself off, it was indeed true that both of them had reached orgasm. “We kissed, too.” It felt important to add that. “It wasn’t just…you know, the carnal stuff.  We kissed.”
I’ll come over.”
Subject: RE: You never do this
[12:32AM] You’re upset. JW
At first John thought that Sherlock might have been rattled by the man on the phone. Of course, Sherlock didn’t have nearly enough emotional range to experience something like that, so it seemed unlikely that they would be worried. Besides, they had seemed remarkably unconcerned when hearing about it. The only part that had surprised them was the man’s insistence that they return to their home planet. Still, John doubted that Sherlock would be the sort to simply pack up and leave at vague threats from some creep.
In a moment of desperation, John ran outside and caught sight of Sherlock’s silhouette over by the laundry station. It was just a cement foundation with a roof suspended above it, covering two large sinks. Sherlock was perched inside one of the sinks with their legs pulled up to their chest.
After that, things got progressively better.
John had just brought him a cup of tea and set it delicately on the coffee table in front of where Sherlock was sprawled on the sofa.
John realised that the book must have been some sort of unimaginative romance novel. “No. A lot of them are, but a lot of them aren’t.”
brilliant at what we did last night.”
John had nodded, and Mike had slapped him on the back and invited him out to the pub, saying, “Tell me everything.”
“Never have I ever been kept in hospital.” Sherlock, John, and a few others drank to that, leaving John and Sherlock with eight fingers up each. Apparently things that most normal people had not done were the sorts of things that the two of them did regularly, leaving them closer to losing the game than anyone else.
Sherlock felt that blush coming on again.
At that point, Sherlock came bounding back down the stairs and stood next to John, tugging on his arm, but John refused to budge, his curiosity piqued. “What have you heard?” he asked eagerly, smirking over at Sherlock.
.” Molly muttered something under her breath that sounded like
“His name is Joey,” Mummy told him.
Sherlock seemed fascinated by this subject, in spite of John’s awkwardness. “That’s how my people are. With the sex, that is. And there are rarely any pair bonds between two individuals exclusively. It’s very much a society in which people mate to increase their fitness.”
He lay there, panting, recovering, for several long moments afterward, feeling the lingering traces of that incandescent pleasure in his veins.
John placed a hand on his shoulder, and Sherlock immediately shook it off, not deigning to speak to him. He was just going to lie there and be massively upset that his whole understanding of their relationship had been flawed from the start. Was this even a relationship? They’d never talked about labels, so for all he knew—
Sherlock smirked.  Molly’s romantic life had been fairly non-existent since her attempts to pursue something with Sherlock, so it would be nice for her to have someone.  Besides, Sherlock rather enjoyed when he could tease Molly about these things.
He stared out the window, doing his best to limit his glances at John’s reflection to about one per minute.
“I should still get a point for accurately describing what was drawn,” Sherlock argued. He couldn’t believe the unfairness of this. John was at fault for doing the drawing incorrectly. “You said we got points based on guessing. Well, I correctly guessed what you put up there. I demand a point.” He stomped his foot in emphasis.
[8:37AM] John, don’t do this. You can’t do this. SH
Sherlock nodded and offered a shy smile.  John’s expression brightened even more, if that were possible.
His first thought was to backtrack, to say that he hadn’t been offering and had merely been explaining his plans for the rest of the evening, but John smiled over at him as if he’d said something particularly clever, and he found that he didn’t regret anything that made John look at him like that.
Eventually, Sherlock was getting far too bored to keep up the pretense of being busy any longer.  He began to pack his things away, noting that John immediately looked over at him as he started to move.
Sorry if there's been a bit of wait for this chapter!  It's here now!
, and then there would be a party hosted by the rugby team, at which John would be present and would talk to him some more. Sherlock supposed that it wouldn’t be terrible.  Besides, he could always bring Molly along.  She would surely be interested in attending a rugby party, if only to find the chance to talk to Lestrade a bit more.
The reply was quick. John figured that SH must have kept his phone on him constantly, and he definitely appreciated that promptness right then.
John came back with their drinks, setting down something that was an unnatural shade of pink before Sherlock. “What’s going on?” he asked as he sat down. Underneath the table, Sherlock moved so that their legs were pressed together, trying to get some modicum of comfort from the contact.
Sherlock took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself back down, although his body seemed intent on punishing him for that sudden movement regardless of any deep breathing exercises he did.
John pulled back, laughing.  “Oh, my god, Sherlock, stop thinking and just relax.”
,” he said at last when his mind began functioning properly again. “Oh, right.”
Sherlock ducked his head and fought back a blush.  Ah, yes, the two weeks where he’d operated under false assumptions and had removed himself from John’s presence.  There was always something, it seemed, and this time, that ‘something’ had been a rather large thing to miss.
[6:19AM] I’ve said that you’re a big softy. Showed them the letters that you sent me. Very romantic. JW
Sherlock appreciated his gentle expression but didn’t exactly see how this was the time for looking like that. “You were shot, John. You went off to war, and you got shot, and you almost died.”
While his boredom had previously hit him rather hard, his current state was quite different. Although there were no more cases, he still had a great deal to occupy his mind—namely, John Watson, whose surname he has learned from Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock had been unable to keep the man from his thoughts, muscular and handsome and soldierly as he was. And so

“You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to,” John murmured, his tone much softer now that he was speaking from a place of concern rather than a place of rage.
Sherlock’s face flushed, and he hid it against John’s shoulder. “I hate you,” he grumbled. “You’re a terrible boyfriend, teasing me like that.”
“No,” Wilkes said, though his anger was still keeping his focus on John’s date instead of his own. “He’s a damn liar is what he is.”

, really. That hurt, yes, but Sherlock had always been very good at ignoring pain. He resolved to drop his efforts to impress John then and there, as it would clearly be a waste of time, and if dropping his efforts meant that John was going to be put off by him, then so be it.
Every day, John would go about the duties that went with his position as caretaker, and Sherlock would tag along, most often making things more difficult than they needed to be. After that, the two of them would try to entertain themselves in any way possible. Mostly, that involved trying to figure out more about one another.

“I, er…”  He paused.  He couldn’t exactly tell John his true reason for wandering around that night.
John smiled. “You’re not really a terrible boyfriend, either.”

Sherlock shut his eyes because that suddenly took less effort than keeping them open.

Instead, he sighed and let everything else fade into the background as he once more drifted off.
I’m fairly certain that’s not a story you want to hear in great detail.
John met his gaze, and said, “Can you blame me for being eager? I mean—look at you. You’re perfect.”

“If you scare him off,” he had warned them gravely, “I’ll make you all do sprints for an extra two hours after every practice for the rest of the year.” He had sounded serious enough that none of them had dared to defy him.
