Sherlock ran up the stairs two at a time, gradually feeling the weight lift off his chest. Alone. Finally. He knew he couldn’t afford to miss another class but he just didn’t have the energy to pretend he didn’t care today. Because he did. He cared so much that it hurt.
“You were that careful, huh?” John teased, smiling at Sherlock.
Just as John had suspected, he wasn’t going to be able to do it tonight. Sherlock had gone off and gotten spectacularly drunk at the party. He didn’t even know there were actual stations with different types of people with different kinds of alcohol. He just knew that tonight was
They were able to get him downstairs with no incidents. Molly hailed a cab and John and Greg laid him out on the back seat as gently as they could.
John had noticed his two friends glancing at each other more than once and had finally asked, “What?”
They left as quickly as they came, loud and larger than life, walking down the hall and disappearing down the stairs.
“So you in?” Mike said.
,” said Molly sardonically. “Did I interrupt your little meeting in
“We don’t want to pry or anything, mate, it’s just you’ve not exactly been in the best of moods lately. Is there anything you want to get off your chest?” Greg had said.
Not that he wasn’t pleased. He was happy that Sherlock seemed to be enjoying himself. It was just that… John sighed.
John looked apologetically at the cabbie. “Sorry, mate. He’s a little pissed.”
Sherlock stirred but didn’t open his eyes. He mumbled something and gave a deep sigh.
Sherlock didn't have to look up to see who it was. It didn't matter, anyway. They were all the same. He might as well paint a bull's eye on the back of his head (or all over his body, for that matter) the way their attention never failed to hone in on him. It was just a matter of time. He could be walking downstairs from his room, or toweling off in the bathroom, or eating breakfast, lunch, dinner. It always, always happens. One of them gets bored with whatever mundane teenage activity they were currently undertaking and it begins.
“You smell nice.” Sherlock started sniffing John’s neck and John almost dropped the keys.
going to be
“Care to elaborate?” John said, feeling Sherlock enter the kitchen. As he turned around, he realized that Sherlock might still be naked and felt a twinge of disappointment when he saw him dressed.
Molly had gently laid a hand on John’s arm and had said softly, “You know you can trust us, right?”
Sherlock felt the happy bubble in his chest burst.
“So…” Jeanette smiled at him and licked her lips. “What’s new with you?”
things were probably waiting for him outside which made his hunger disappear.
I was supposed to write an only-John-and-Sherlock fic (you know, the one where they're the only two characters apart from secondary characters that are just there for context) but this got away from me. I feel like friends are an essential part of the school milieu so enter Lestrade, Anderson, Stamford, and Dimmock!
She moved even closer and put her hand on John’s knee. “I’m doing okay. I miss hanging out with you.”
Walking quietly towards the stalls, he saw blond hair and strong shoulders. Water was cascading down his back and his head was tipped up while he rubbed his torso. Eyes closed, the boy turned his head and Sherlock saw who it was.
Greg and Molly looked at each other, amused smiles on their faces.
John sighed. He started taking Sherlock’s shoes off while Molly tried to position Sherlock comfortably.
John smiled, “Yes, I think so, too. Can you help me get you upstairs?”
Sherlock, unsure of what just happened, found himself walking with this stranger who offered to help him. Help him. Him. Sherlock. Someone actually offered to help him. It was such an unfamiliar feeling to be on the receiving end of kindness that he actually felt a little suspicious. His annoying older brother Mycroft, in his efforts to try to help Sherlock, once said, “People are not naturally kind, Sherlock. We are selfish creatures. Think about toddlers, for instance. They are the best example of what human nature is, stripped of all learning and conditioning. Yes, human beings have evolved to become a better version of ourselves, ‘better’ a word I would not choose myself, but our primal urges have always been to think about what we want as opposed to what is good and right. If someone offers to help you, you can be sure that they want something in return.”
They were talking about sharing toys. He was seven.
John made a hmm sound of acknowledgement and started to relax as he walked beside Anthea. It was a beautiful and warm April Monday. Granted, he wasn't in the best, most relaxing situation in his life, but the worst was over. He had finally been admitted. It was touch-and-go there for a while.
It must’ve fallen while he was running. He was sure he put it in there this morning. Just to be sure, Sherlock grabbed his backpack and upended it, letting his things scatter on the bed.
“No, no.” Sherlock’s reply was a little too quick. “You wouldn’t want to be associated with me, anyway,” he added with a brief glance at John before looking down again.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open and he squinted at John. “John?”
“I did!” John exclaimed, “Weird as fuck.”
“I hate myself,” John had groaned. “How do I do this? Should I just move out?”
“Okay, sure,” Sherlock said. “Thanks.”
“Should I just order any breakfast food for you? You allergic to anything?” John called out, willing his voice not to shake.
Jeanette grabbed his arm and led him towards Molly’s room. It was empty, its occupants migrating to the bedroom next to it to play a drinking game that could be heard all over the flat.
Molly had looked at Greg and he’d nodded. “Don’t take this the wrong way, John, but…” Another look at Greg.
“You smell nice.” Sherlock started sniffing John’s neck and John almost dropped the keys.
“Of course I can, John. I’m not pisshed,” Sherlock said as he drunkenly attempted to sit up. As he sat up, his hand automatically went to his mouth.
Still shocked, John grabbed a blanket from Sherlock’s room and put it over his dozing friend. Tucking the top end underneath Sherlock’s chin, John couldn’t help but smooth away the dark curls on Sherlock’s forehead. John always thought Sherlock looked incredibly vulnerable when he slept. Everybody does, he supposed. There was just something about sleep that made his rude manic flat mate seem more childlike when in this state. John felt his lips tug up into a soft smile when Sherlock started to stir.
John finally walked away, his legs feeling like lead as he tried not to look back.
“Hi,” John took a couple of steps towards him, extending a hand out. His smile faltered when the boy seemed to shrink back an infinitesimal inch, almost as if he were afraid John was going to hit him. “John,” he added.
"Alright," John said. He needed to get ahold of that as soon as possible. Not because he was in any hurry to follow the rules written there, but to be able to devise ways to get around them. He was mulling over this when Anthea lead him towards the building a little to the left of the soccer field.
“It was for a case,” Sherlock said. John heard him shuffle around the living room and walk towards the kitchen.
He headed for his room, willing his erection away.
“Just started last semester when that school chewed me up and spit me out!” Mike’s guffaw was just how John remembered it. “This place isn’t bad. I’ve been trying to clean up my act, though.”
He sat on his bed and contemplated his next step. Should he just go to the cafeteria for breakfast? He was pretty hungry but then again… More
John moved his neck away from Sherlock’s face as far as he could while still supporting Sherlock’s weight.
Greg had snorted. “He may be a genius, mate, but you know how stupid he is when it comes to this.”
“He’s not much of a drinker,” John agreed, feeling exhausted all of a sudden.
"Hey, our boy's here!"
“Uh…” John absentmindedly rubbed the back of his neck. “I kinda already have plans, but rain check?”
“I just moved here from Brent,” John said, trying to keep his voice light. He pointed to the door Sherlock just emerged from and asked, “Is that your room?”
Keeping his facial expression neutral, John let go of Sherlock’s hand and looked away, feeling disconcerted and more than a little confused.
The three of them got up and John tapped Sherlock gently on the shoulder.
“I think I’m inebriated, John,” Sherlock announced.
Sherlock heart skipped a beat and he found himself smiling back. “Yeah, I was in a hurry.”
John, thinking hard, decided he couldn’t let Sherlock run away without at least trying to do something. Breakfast, he thought, elated. Everybody eats breakfast. He would invite Sherlock to eat breakfast with him.
As the sounds of early-morning banter in the hallway progressed from low humming to full-on cacophony, John contemplated his emotions inside closed doors. He needed to breathe.
“Listen-“
They trudged up the stairs slowly and reached the sitting-room. John deposited Sherlock on the sofa and went to the kitchen to get him some water.
As dawn approached and the smell of early morning permeated his cozy room, he finally gave up on sleep and got up. Sherlock grabbed his shower kit and headed towards the common bathroom. Yawning loudly, he thought that getting up to shower early had its perks. Nobody would be around to steal his clothes. Or take pictures while he showered. Or squirt him in the face with shampoo. Or put his things in condoms. Yes, this was definitely a good idea.
Sherlock turned his head and looked Henry in the eye, feigning loss of focus. He squinted, frowned, and mumbled behind the tape.
"Right." John drifted into the dining room that they'd converted into a modest home theatre – well, it was a home theatre in that it had a large television and a comfortable sofa. Nora was sprawled on the sofa watching an incomprehensible cartoon. "Hey. Mind if I join you?"
"Ha! Right, right. Well, let me speak to the powers that be, perhaps we can work something out regarding an event. If my wife did win, she'd be forever grateful to me, I should think. Meanwhile, I'll get you up to the – which lab did you want?"
"I know the way, thank you," Sherlock said airily, and beckoned to John. "Let me bring you up to speed, John."
"I've got a little girl," John said.
As Martin walked away, Benedict stared after him. He heard the sound of footsteps ascending stairs.
"Well? What about it?" The arms tightened fractionally about Sherlock's upper body and there was a deep nasal inhalation, a drawing-in of scent. "'Cos I missed you, you know."
"You must miss home."
Janine threw her head back and laughed. “Sweetheart, that was
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Mycroft?" John couldn't hide his flush of pleasure at the warmth of that greeting, and found that he didn't want to.
"Why wouldn't it be?" Sherlock let Tom in, noting that the sky was darkening. Autumn was coming with its crisp days and chilly nights. Statistically, fewer murders were committed in autumn, but there was always a pleasant anomaly now and then.
Stupid thought, but not totally inaccurate. Everything would change soon. Was there any way to be really ready for it, and did that even matter? Ever since the day that Sherlock had invited him to investigate Lady Howe's death, John had felt the grey bubble that had enclosed him for so long – a bubble that had taken ten years to utterly encapsulate him, and at such a stealthy pace that he'd scarcely realised it was there – begin to dissolve, and he'd tried to appreciate the change from moment to moment because it was so tentative. But now, there didn't seem a need for that clenching preparatory feeling, that perpetual anticipation that always seemed to spoil the present. He had now, and he had the future.
"Indulge me," Benedict said sharply.
It was typical suburbia:  she passed a Shell, 7-11, Chevron. Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Home Depot, McDonald's, Arby's, Payless Shoes, a cinema multiplex, a Target, Starbucks, Mattress Discounters, Men's Wearhouse, Dress Barn.
Even given that TWH had been upset and was perhaps attempting to assume a jaunty casualness, the style and the tone seemed more than a bit off…and the lack of an apostrophe in 'we'll'…. Tom's texts were grammatical to an admirable standard, ridiculous sentiment notwithstanding, nearly as precise as Sherlock's texts.
Calling a racecourse at ten o'clock in the evening. Not what he'd expected.
Mycroft sighed.
Sherlock tilted his head to one side, blinking innocently. "I haven't taken anything yet."
"Yeah, you weren't really specific. When were you in Serbia?"
"What? Are you okay?" John rolled off, afraid he'd pushed Sherlock too far. Sherlock wasn't terribly experienced, after all.
"Sounds marvellous," Sherlock said. Pasta in 221B with John Watson sounded, in fact, like heaven. He got up and followed Mycroft and Anthea down the staircase and out into the street.
Obediently, John dropped, slithering and then hurtling down to the floor, and the world filled with fire. A heavy body toppled onto him, knocking his head against the floor and crushing the breath from him. He gasped and struggled, his arms thoroughly trapped.
to think. He'd have guessed it was a practical joke, but as far as he could tell, Mycroft Holmes didn't have a sense of humour and probably had never played a joke in his life. And all the rot Mycroft was talking, quantum events and cosmic inflation and strings and whatever else the ever-loving
Sherlock pressed his lips together and nodded. "Of course. How's the practice going?"
that?"
Grateful thanks are due to my superfine beta/Britpicking team, kimberlite and vilestrumpet.
The doorbell shrilled again, but he paid it no mind, trudging back up the stairs and into the darkened bedroom, where he slumped back into bed. He'd walked from NSY to Hampstead, surprisingly unbothered and, finding himself exhausted at the end of his trek had collapsed immediately. Now he picked up his phone and discovered he'd slept nearly ten hours. Several more texts and voicemails had come through; he deleted them methodically, without opening a single one.
"Oh, God –" A third shrill, someone
"Mummy, Mummy, Mummy…."
Many, many thanks, as ever, to kimberlite and vilestrumpet for beta and britpick. <3  All errors are always mine.
"Fucking hell, Sherlock," John said. His voice was low and his eyes flashed with rage and what looked like impending murder. He pointed at Benedict. "Don't you – don't you
"I understand." She'd seen enough. Not even the best undertakers could perform outright miracles.
He scrolled through a few more texts.
"Look, I think we'd better get you to A&E. Just sit tight, okay? I'll be right back."
"When you say he's leaving, I assume that means –"
"Erm…yeah, a couple. Don't you remember those blowgun murders?"
"Wow. I'm a millionaire." Nora paused and considered. "A thousandaire."
"Er, yeah. Martin."
“Yeah. I mean, to this day I don’t know why Mary picked me. We weren’t really great friends. I’m not sure she actually
"It was among the probabilities of occurrence."
"What are your Christmas plans?"
"It's true," Sherlock insisted. "First the knee, now this. I've been hit
John put the phone close to his nose. "Oh. Oh, Christ." If it wasn't his, it looked…no, it was his. No mistake.
money, let alone become accustomed to living like people with money. "I didn't think of it."
Sherlock chuckled. "Me."
Perfect. They wanted charm? Then charm they would receive.
"You switched to directing, though," Tom whispered, his cheek and eye pulsing with pain. "You said you'd had enough of acting. And then you dropped out. Henry, we were hardly ever up for the same roles – I don't understand why –" He cried out as Henry hit him again.
The day came into focus. He'd gone to lunch with Benedict and Mark and Ian, and apparently Benedict and Mark had had a little liaison in the gents'. Had it been the first, or just one of many? Tom had left, gone home, Henry and Graham had come by, had drinks, Henry had come back for his mobile and had pulled out something awful-smelling and pressed it to Tom's face. Not choloroform, couldn't be. Tom had never smelled it before, but the effect….
Benedict fumbled for Mycroft's phone and found his number. It was getting late, Mycroft probably didn't want to be disturbed, but too bloody bad.
"Fine. The invitation's open, though, just so you know." She bent close to the corpse. "Sherlock?"
"I'm almost eighty," Tresler said. "Eamonn was eighty-seven. He'd had strokes before. He wore special undergarments so that he wouldn't get piss on his trousers. I have emphysema and lymphoma. The fucking doctors don't expect me to live more than ten months. And now you and your friend are sticking your noses into a bad business, Mr Holmes. We're all on borrowed time, one way or another."
"Yeah, sure." The girl opened her desk drawer and got a new key card, fiddled with the card machine for a moment, and handed the card to John. "Tell him to bring the old one when he's got a moment."
"You feel guilty."
"Right to the point. Well…." Moriarty poured a cup of tea and offered it to Benedict, who shook his head. He shrugged, dropped two lumps of sugar into the cup, and stirred. "
"Not right now. Can I take my seat belt off?"
"I told you that you should have called him first."
Benedict jumped and gave a little yelp. He spun on his heel and gaped at Martin, carrying a doctor's bag and fixing him with a stern glare.
"Yeah, yeah. Let me get my bag –" Martin broke off and squinted, starting into Benedict's eyes. "You're dead pale."
Some time ago, this narrow concrete-walled hallway had held the worst of the worst:  all terrorists apprehended in the United Kingdom, pending trial or extradition or trade. More recently, the UK had initiated a quiet policy of mutually assured destruction, including but not limited to terrorists' families via clever and stealthy abduction. It was astounding how quickly a Tube bomber folded when he saw his wife and children water-boarded in front of him. Of course it wasn't utterly foolproof, but it had done wonders to reduce the number of incidents in the UK. Of course, His Majesty the King and the Prime Minister had plausible deniability; humanitarianism was the public order of the day. Poor sods.
Benedict frowned. "Why does that sound like an insult?"
Sherlock sat up, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "I think I managed REM sleep."
"Deck the halls with smelly cat pee, fa la la la la…." Mary stepped down and took the garland. "John. Relax."
Intense. Too intense. He didn’t know whether he was going to survive this.
They touched their plastic cups together and pretended to clink them. John laughed and took a drink. “Hey, sorry about earlier. You know how Sherlock is.”
“Running back to your room? I wonder why?” John’s smile was a little devilish as he started looking around for the phone.
"Young man, I would like to reiterate our no-drugs policy here. It is imperative that you not only understand but follow this." The woman speaking to him - a Ms. Hudson, from what he gleaned from his father - was the Headmistress of Brixton Preparatory. "The school is very strict about this matter. If I so much as hear anything, anything at all, about this sort of trouble from you, I will personally escort you out of this institution." Her eyes were grave and her tone severe but John felt like laughing out loud. It was an unfortunate behavior he had adopted from growing up in a stressful environment. He often laughed out of nervousness. This time, though, he succeeded in keeping a straight face.
"Novikov unit functional."
--" he pointed at the kitchen – "clean that up yourself.
Steeling herself, she opened the text. He'd sent it at midnight. Had John been there? No. Couldn't have been.
Flailing, Sherlock had complained to Molly. "He's ignoring me. I must have made him angry." Maybe it was the text about Moriarty, though Sherlock wasn't about to mention that to Molly. Surely John would have wanted to know, though?
"Obviously she didn't know about it."
Benedict frowned. "How so?"
"I didn't think you were capable of that level of dishonesty, Mary."
"No, of course I do. She's your only child, it's natural you should want to protect her." Sherlock got to his feet. "When are you leaving?"
"And after that?"
---The IV –
John drifted toward the window. "Do you know Lord Moran?"
As the waiter glided away, Janine shrugged off her coat and smiled at Molly. “So. How’s Sherl doing?”
Sherlock ignored that last and turned to glare at Mycroft. "Where's John?"
Mycroft put a hand out. "Sherlock, don't – you've just woken."
There was a desk, with bookshelves next to it, a closed laptop. His desk, his books, his computer.
Tom re-entered the room bearing a tray filled with cardboard containers. "I had them in the warming oven." He set it down on a low table and handed one container to Sherlock. "Sir. Pick your feet up, please, and let me sit."
"I think I'll get some sleep."
"I'm calling organisers. This is ridiculous. Will you come upstairs with me?" He increased the pressure on John's hand incrementally.
John nodded. "She'd love that." He put the phone in his pocket. "I'd like it too."
"Yes, if that's what you want. And lemon chicken. You still like lemon chicken?"
"Watched you – yourself and Dr Watson."
"Don't bother." John turned on his heel and went back to the front room. He collected his coat and slammed the door on the way out.
"Cold!" Sherlock yelped.
Benedict grinned, pleased with himself despite the severity of his predicament. "Thanks. Look, I'm really sorry about all this. I wanted to tell you, but I thought you'd have me sectioned."
A soft smile appeared on Moriarty's face. "I told you I'd burn the heart out of you, but I didn't say how." He drew his phone from his inner breast pocket and punched in a number. A raspy male voice answered, and Moriarty said, "Now will be fine. More than fine."
"No, no." Sherlock snatched his coat from a nearby table. "Come along, John. We've got to take advantage of your truancy. See you tomorrow, Molly. Wear your respirator."
Amelia's father stood and pocketed his phone. "Well, she announced it just before class." The unspoken reprimand of
Sore subject, obviously. Sherlock edged away. "And Nora?"
"Still thirsty?" Moriarty waited. "No? Good. See you in a while. Oh, and you can try to break free, Sherlock, but even if you do, there's no way out of the cellar. Trust me, you're going nowhere." He slid his fingers up and cupped Sherlock's cheek. "Not at the moment, anyway." Moriarty turned and left, followed by Moran and the two thugs. The light overhead went out.
"Fantastic," Sherlock said, and threw the door open, leaving John to pay.
"Mm."
"Thank you. I hope it lasts and the bloody satsumas don't get shrivelly before Christmas Day." Mary ascended the step-ladder and draped the lights over the mirror. "How's that?"
"Can I have Tabasco?" Nora wheedled.
"Oh, I think you heard me." Sherlock smiled. "Actually, my first suggestion was garroting you with wire myself, but that would have required too much explanation and paperwork. Apparently, according to Mycroft, there's some legal loophole for using nerve gas. The details were dull – you understand."
Wrenching his eyes away from the gunman, Benedict angled his head to see John. John was okay – wary, his lips pressed tightly together, breath issuing from his nose. His eyes sparked with anger, but he caught Benedict's eye and nodded.
"Every covert photograph you've taken of unsuspecting clients, people who trusted you with their greatest vulnerabilities." Sherlock wouldn't have said that; Irene had intrigued him, as he'd intrigued her. But Irene didn't intrigue Benedict. She was a few steps up from the sort of people who let tabloids pay them for tidbits of information, but not by much, when one came down to it. "Every scrap of information you gleaned from some fool in a post-coital haze, every document you stole from a phone when somebody's back was turned." Benedict held the phone up, well out of her reach, though she wasn't moving. "And emails from MOD officials stupid enough to trust you. I don't necessarily consider myself a patriot, but even on a sliding scale of morality, it's pretty reprehensible, wouldn't you say?"
Nothing.
Mycroft set his phone on a side table. "Do you know who it was that took him?"
"Okay." John started typing.
"Damn it," he whispered.
Sherlock closed his eyes again.
"We heard shouting," one of the men said.
Mycroft Holmes answered the door, immaculate in a three-piece suit, tie firmly knotted at the neck, and shining shoes. Greg hated ties himself – he’d never fancied the choky feeling they gave him. “Inspector. Do come in.”
"Okay." Tom trudged off to the bathroom, and Sherlock went into the bedroom to change clothes. His were dirty, and if by some miracle the police did happen to stop by, it would be better not to have clothes soiled with dirt from the Burgess property as well as sticky gaffer tape residue. He found an old, soft grey t-shirt with some sort of architectural design on it and a pair of tracksuit bottoms.
John took a deep breath. "Sherlock…."
Sherlock frowned. “What –”
"Then why did you wake me?"
intelligence at best – but feigning exhaustion and aping Cumberbatch's eager-puppy demeanour would only take him so far. Their relationship was secretive; there weren't any YouTube videos of the pair of them kissing or bantering or exchanging syrupy glances. It wasn't going to be easy to extrapolate the nuances of a relationship from the few cues TWH had given him; there were months of physical familiarity and affection and references known only to them. Christ, why did people bother?
"That was an impressive collection of evidence in court," Moran said. His voice was soft, controlled, the voice of a man long accustomed to an audience. "You're concise and efficient when it suits you, it seems. Well done. I'm afraid I haven't got time to chat, though. I have an appointment."
. Though disposal didn't seem to be too much of an issue, if Henry owned as much land as the petrol station clerk had asserted.
"You spoke with Mycroft? My God, that can't be good. I'll have to sort him out."
"And no news on the –" John checked himself before uttering the word 'autopsy.' He wouldn't mind explaining it to Nora, but not during dinner – though to be fair, she seemed to have a high tolerance for gory details. Her latest ambition, to hear her tell it, was to be a doctor – specifically, a surgeon. Still, some explanations were best reserved for after mealtimes. "The lab results for Lady Howe?"
"You'll be back to London in no time." Seb went to the freezer and pulled out a bottle of vodka. He poured two generous dollops in glasses and handed one to Stephen. "Come on now.
Sherlock bit his lip to keep from smirking. Burgess Method indeed, as if Henry was that original. Original killers came along every fifty years, if that. And obviously Henry had lived with the odour of corpses so long that he'd become desensitised to it. Any officer worth his salt would recognise it the moment he stepped into the cellar. Covertly, moving only his hand, he began sawing delicately at the tape that bound his wrists. "It was you. The letters."
," Sherlock growled, went to delete it, and accidentally opened it instead.
"That's what I'm afraid of." Mycroft opened the door. "I'll be in touch, little brother. Sleep well. Mind your leg."
Tom smiled down at him. "You're all red."
The laughter bubbled again.
Much as Sherlock hated to admit it, even to himself, he was exhausted. "Can't it wait?"
A million skillion thanks to kimberlite and vilestrumpet for beta, britpick, and general awesomeness.
"Scouting," Sherlock replied primly. "Got an activity badge for it."
"And Mummy would like you to phone."
"Yes." John turned to see Mycroft, impeccably dressed and unruffled as ever, glancing over the cottage with slight distaste. "Because I really didn't have anything better to do this evening."
"If it happens again – that is, if we switch back and we're still trapped in each other's universe – I see no reason why it shouldn't happen again, balance of probability and all that, I want you to contact Mycroft."
The bottle crackled again. Sherlock felt dampness, then wetness, and then a diffused and dust-gritted stream of water flowing into his nose and mouth. He clamped his mouth tightly closed and exhaled harshly through his nostrils.
"Hardly a girl. You've left it a little late, haven't you?"
"What about these?" John asked, showing Sherlock some similar letters.
Molly hesitated, caught on the hop. She didn’t really want to face her empty flat, but she wasn’t sure she wanted to spend time with someone who’d evidently shagged Sherlock Holmes the length and breadth of England. Even if she was over him, it still stung a bit. But it would have been a lie to say she wasn’t curious. “Okay,” she said softly.
"You came to –" Sherlock coughed again. "Kill him."
"They're all sort of weird," Tetchy said.
"What?" Benedict stared at John in puzzlement.
"Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. My friend got a bit of…erm, product in his eyes, and it's stinging him. So if you've got some eyewash, that'd be great, thanks."
" Moriarty pointed the gun at John's chest and hiccupped out a sobbing giggle. "I mean, how many times does he have to tell you?" He drew his foot back and kicked John again.
"I had to rush to make my train, though. That's why I've still got my costume and makeup on."
Replete and with only a slight headache to attest to the excitement of the afternoon, Sherlock reached down for his shoes. "Ready to go, John?"
Father chose the stage name Carlton. "Sounded less like a fart in a bath."
"Headachy."
He stuck his fingers in his hair and rubbed briskly, then heaved a sigh and went back to YouTube, resuming the programme. He sat in silence, watching his life – his and John's, the beginning of their life together – unfold on the little screen. As he watched, he relaxed a bit. He wasn't given to nostalgia – waste of time – but he couldn't help smiling at an odd detail here and there. Lestrade's weary patience, John's confusion –
"Yeah, I know. Stay still anyhow, I've got eyewash." John gently pushed Sherlock back to the bed and fetched a hand towel from the bathroom. "Open your eyes as much as you can. This might sting."
Sherlock's heart stuttered. He shielded his eyes from the late-morning sun. "John?"
John frowned. "Other adaptations?"
Mark nodded. "Look, we'll just…it was my fault. I shouldn't have…God,
"Yeah," John said, hardly believing any of this. "I'm okay."
There was a sharp smell of vomit and a fainter odour of faeces in the air. Sherlock sniffed and glanced into the toilet. "Did you flush?"
"Three days," Mycroft said. "That's all you have." He went upstairs without another word.
"Don't do it again." John put a finger beneath Sherlock's chin and lifted it, then mimicked Sherlock's earlier gesture, moving his thumb over Sherlock's mouth. His eyes were swimming with tears. "Don't you ever, ever do that to me again."
"Yeah, I know. Have a seat." The man stepped a few paces closer.
Cumberbatch's secret boyfriend, and while Sherlock wasn't totally opposed to some transient pleasure and exchange of bodily fluids (though he hadn't indulged in a few years), he wasn't ready to give the game away so quickly. "Give me a minute to catch my breath. It's been a hell of a day." He flopped on the sofa and stretched out. Pretty comfortable, he had to admit.
"Mycroft's people did reconnaissance. Let's hope they're not quite as incompetent as they were last night. By all reports our man in the luxury vehicle left in the very small hours of the morning."
Based on his research, TWH had gone to Eton and Cambridge (nothing special) and was a classics scholar (useless), but that meant bugger-all in the general brains department, evidently. Well, Sherlock had had plenty of school and uni acquaintances who were even more stupid. All of them, actually. "What else would it mean?" Sherlock snapped, then sat up and gave Tom's arm an I'm-just-having-you-on push. "I'm fine. Really. They performed every test under the sun. You know, star treatment."
Sherlock picked up the white silk scarf, slippery and cool in his fingers, and pulled it taut, then put it against Tom's mouth.
"Not this time," Sherlock replied. "Just a threat. Nothing to be concerned about."
His breath whistled out of his lungs as he ran, his feet splashing in freezing puddles of filth that didn't bear thinking about. The path ahead of him dipped downward into utter blackness, but that was fine; he knew every last scrap of Finsbury Park like the back of his hand. The tube station wasn't far away, and that was reassuring. Less reassuring were the pounding footsteps behind him, gaining on him. Five men, two decidedly armed.
Did some people become beautiful over time, or was it that they'd always been beautiful, but it took a while to notice? The changes in Sherlock's face and body had been so gradual, a slow-bending shadow in the sun. Jim had watched him so long. He'd given Sherlock so much space. There'd been ample time for contemplation, or so he'd thought.
"Sherlock, did you deliberately not solve this crime?"
"You go to Brighton, you find out who actually committed the murder, and you have them arrested. Get Mycroft to help you, get Lestrade – Christ, get Donovan and Anderson if you have to, because clearly you're not competent to resolve this on your own."
Sherlock paused to examine a portrait hanging on one wall. It depicted a dark-haired, pale-skinned woman in a full-skirted late eighteenth-century dress of butter yellow, creamy pearls at her throat and adorning her ears. A smile curved her red-lipped mouth, but her expression was distinctly unamused.
Sebastian Moran stepped forward and took a thin, flexible cane from the wall. "You ruined my brother's life, Mr Holmes."
Slowly, Sherlock heaved himself to his feet. "Why do I have the feeling that you already know?"
"Honestly, was that necessary?"
Tresler chuffed out a smoky laugh. "Mr Holmes, such curiosity. What do you imagine you know?"
He sagged. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge."
"Not poison?" Benedict asked.
"Hey." John wet his lips and glanced round the room. "How are you?"
The people carrier had blacked-out windows and a tiny bar with thermoses of tea and coffee, and it was comfortable, certainly more so than the jail cell John had occupied for an hour or so after processing, but it didn't go very far to assuage John's unease. Neither the driver nor the two silent and stoic security men who accompanied him answered his questions, and John was forced to conclude that this was yet another covert Mycroft operation. At least he hoped it was. He really didn't want to visit with Jim Moriarty again. The security guards had been polite, if nearly wordless, and hadn't belted him to shut him up, so that was a start, at least.
Benedict began to walk round the kitchen, gathering up what looked like rubbish and throwing it in the bin liner. He found the syringe that John had mentioned, stuffed with something unidentifiable; it looked a bit like melting plastic. He pitched it and began clearing the table, putting dirty flasks and tubes in the sink. No dishwasher, damn it. He hated washing dishes. Anyway, John was still in the shower.
It was getting light. She moved faster, shoving the bag of glass and the table base into the outside bin, then scrubbed hurriedly at the stain on the wallpaper once more. Satisfied that it was as good as a hasty cleaning was going to get it, she set up laser tripwires on the front walk and just inside the front door, scooped up the dead man's firearm, and locked the back garden door. Then she crept downstairs carefully, leaving the light off.
"Budge over," he said, and sat beside her, taking her hand. "Yes, darling. A lot of trouble, I think. I'm going to try to help him."
"Yeah, but I'll just have some toast. I think I know a young lady who's eager to tear some presents open." Mary grinned at Nora, who grinned back unabashedly.
"What about you?" John asked, sitting. "Good to be back at work?"
The tepid-bath closeness of the afternoon air engulfed him the moment he stepped outside. Revolting, particularly at this latitude. This universe's global-warming crisis must have been a much grimmer reality than his own. He sniffed:  the usual mélange of fuel exhaust, cooking odours, simmering rubbish, and the perfumed, soaped, or unwashed smell of human bodies. Not much different – just hotter. Awful.
"Wait here, please." The woman smiled again and turned on her heel, exiting the room.
Wild times. Sort of.
Sherlock grinned and set the phone down. The very word was enough to make even the most thick-headed people back away and avoid eye contact. With luck, he'd have privacy for at least twelve hours. After twenty-four hours he supposed that the hordes of minders would descend again, intent on rushing him to hospital to check for intestinal flu or irritable bowel syndrome or perhaps necrotising enterocolitis.
Oh, dear God.
"Not exactly. I did remind him that you'd just received a pretty nasty shock, though."
Her eyes, full of sorrow, stirred the last of John's compassion, but he couldn't forget why she was leaving, why all this was happening. "How could you have lied to me for so long, Mary?"
"He can't have kept his hands entirely clean. He might be broken, but that doesn't mean he's not clever." Sherlock dropped his napkin on the table and pushed back his chair.
"He's leaving for Spain," Sherlock said. "Today. In an hour." He pressed his lips together. "He wanted me to have breakfast with him and Eleanor this morning, see him off properly, but I begged off."
Benedict sank into a kitchen chair, looking around bleakly. The flat was horribly cluttered; Benedict was by no stretch of the imagination a neat freak (laundry and housekeeping services were just a couple of the nicest perks about having some money), but the accumulation of stuff in the kitchen and front room seemed to be approaching hoarder territory. And yet, it looked not too much different from the set. Tentatively, he got up and wandered into the front room. Everything was the same after all; funny how it seemed unusual out of his own experience. He paced from object to object, touching them as if any moment they might dissolve to nothing beneath his hands. He glided a fingertip over the bleached, smooth topography of the steer skull, decorated with its headphones. He'd invented his own little backstory for it – it had been a souvenir of a case Sherlock had solved in New Mexico, a counterfeiting operation in an abandoned mine near Carlsbad Caverns.
"Don't worry," Henry said. "In and out."
"Of course," Guthrie intoned, bowing his head slightly. "A terrible loss. A very fine woman, and a tireless advocate for victims of Nazi plunder."
Molly blinked at the tall woman in the green dress. She did look vaguely familiar. Oh,
"Mr Cumberbatch," John said
Immediately after ending his call with Benedict, Tom went into the bathroom for a shower, leaving off the music he usually played and scrubbing determinedly at his sweat-soaked and gritty hair and body, a slightly painful yet reassuring ballast of reality against the frightening, nightmarish quality of the latest letter he'd received.
A shrug. “Nothing happened to me, and nothing continued to happen. I had to move out of London, not enough money. Ended up in Glasgow, working in a NHS walk-in clinic. Was run over by a car one winter when it skidded on an icy road. I was 62.”
“Or maybe never”, Sherlock finished for him.
“There was a reasonable chance that I picked the right bottle. Besides, you barely even knew me.”
“You idiot!”
“Of course, Sherlock”, Mycroft said, his voice gone gentle again in a way that reminded Sherlock uncomfortably of his childhood. “John is your friend. He deserves nothing less. I will send you the doctors' curricula vitae shortly via email, I know you'll want to assure yourself about their qualifications.” Before Sherlock was forced to thank his brother once more, Mycroft terminated the call.
Sherlock had the decency to look apologetic as he nodded. “I’m afraid it’s the only explanation for the amount of these specific drugs in the tissue samples. There would have been more in the bloodstream, and that might have killed him, but since there was very little blood to make certain…”
Yes, John thought, there it was. “Harry, please. We’ve been over this many times”, he muttered, hoping against hope that Harry would leave well enough alone, but she only switched tracks.
As he put his seatbelt on, John was strangely relieved that a black cab was still a black cab, the interior a little scuffed and with the slight aroma of old shoes and curry. As the cab took off, John looked out of the window, frowning. Glad as he was to be leaving the hospital, he now realised that it had at least been an environment he was familiar with, ten years of advances in medicine notwithstanding. The look out of the cab window however hammered home what he had been trying to forget: He was a man out of his time. He could not feel the ten years he'd lost, instead, it was as if he had fallen asleep in one London and woken up in another. He couldn't quite put his finger on why what he saw disconcerted him, but the more he looked, the more the usual visual background noise of the city became unfamiliar to him.
“Sherlock, look. I don't know this man ten years from now... I mean, the man I am... Oh this is confusing.” He sighed. “If you want to, I will give you carte blanche to find out anything and everything about the last ten years of John Watson. I don't care, I'm not him after all.”
“Don’t worry about that, John. The police will handle it”, Sherlock said quietly, no trace of impatience in his voice.
John took a few small sips of water and sighed. “Doctor John Watson”, he replied wearily. “I thought it was established that I don't have a concussion?”
Sherlock stood at the end of the hospital corridor, watching as John was wheeled away to another pointless MRI scan. He knew it was pointless, and he highly suspected Doctor Carlton knew it was pointless. There was nothing physically wrong with John's brain, although it would be a relief if there were. A physical defect could be treated and eventually healed. The psyche was far more difficult to mend, and there was nothing Sherlock could do except hope.
John had retreated slightly under the onslaught of motherly worry, but he rallied and plastered a smile onto his face which Sherlock knew was fake. “Yes, I've been in a bit of a brawl”, John said, “but I'll be fine. Sherlock will help me, right Sherlock?”
Sherlock very carefully put tea and spoon on the counter and raised his hands. He made eye contact with John, being as non-threatening and calming as he knew how. “John”, he said softly, trying not to spook the man. Carefully he took a step forward, then another, as if approaching some woodland creature that would bolt if he made any sudden moves.
John's gaze was drawn, as it usually was, to the stained-glass window showing the Rod of Asclepius surrounded by a blue circle and stylised sun rays. It glowed in the late afternoon light, a promise and obligation at the same time. John chuckled softly at his fancy. He was almost finished with his studies, and he would be a doctor, and he promised himself he'd be a damn good one. He would make people better, as best he could.
Then came the Tuesday when there was no note in John’s trouser pocket. The weekend before, they had closed a case after a mad dash through Holland Park. In a last-ditch effort to evade them, the criminal had pushed John off the ornamental waterfall and into the koi pond of the Kyoto Garden. John had surfaced sputtering, bruised, bleeding from a cut to his forehead, and watched in a daze as Sherlock tackled the fugitive to the ground, knocking him unconscious with some force, then jumped down to where John was sitting and pulled him out of the water, questing fingers making sure that John was not seriously hurt. In his dazed state, it appeared to John that Sherlock was fussing over him, but surely, that could not be.
“How do you know that?”
“I'm glad you think so.”
Finally, they arrived at Harry’s flat. “Do you have a first aid kit somewhere?” John asked after he had helped his sister into the living room and onto a sofa. “In the bathroom”, she replied. John went to fetch it, doing his best to ignore the mess and the empty bottles in his sister’s flat and the frankly disgusting state of her bathroom. More evidence that Harry hadn’t been as sober as she’d said.
I've already started on the next chapter, though, and I assure you that this WIP is most definitely not abandoned.
He turned on the tap and splashed his face with cold water to get rid of the stickiness in his eyes, then he finally looked up into the mirror. There was a bandage on his head, presumably where he had been kicked, a black eye and a few already-healing scrapes, but that only registered briefly in his mind as he stared at his reflection. Wrong, it was all wrong, how was that his face? Crow's feet at his eyes, wrinkles on his forehead – wrinkles all over, and his skin looked …
John felt ice trickling down his back and settling in his stomach. There was a cold fluttering under his shoulder blades and a buzzing noise in his head. The dizziness he had felt earlier was returning. His vision narrowed down to the detached face of his doctor.
It was only then that John realized that his best friend’s eyes were closed and he was snoring lightly. On the couch. Wearing absolutely nothing.
“Long story. Tedious. Just a case of missing exam papers. I had to seduce the secretary,” Sherlock accepted the tea John offered him and took a sip.
John did have a juvy record that would make any school shudder at the thought of welcoming him, but he also had something that swayed most of them. It was his last name and everything else that went with it.
"Hey, freak!" A hand pushed Sherlock from behind and he almost faceplanted.
His eyes widened as he thought about all the things he had on his phone. No, no, no. He would die if anybody found it. True, it was password-protected but what if...
Jeanette nodded. “I do.” She chewed on her cup thoughtfully while looking at John. “But hey, if you need a break from Sherlock, we can hang out sometime.”
John cleared his throat. “Okay. So do you wanna order something? My treat.”
Jeanette mumbled a quick apology and left, leaving John behind still sitting on the bed.
John turned to look at Sherlock again. He was facing the side of the bed they were leaning against so John got a good look at his face. Sleeping Sherlock always seemed so unlike Awake Sherlock. Like this, John could almost imagine being able to reach out and touch him without receiving an acerbic comment. Awake Sherlock, though, that was another species entirely.
“Sherlock!” John bounded up the stairs two at a time, his backpack slung over a shoulder and his arms full of groceries. “Sherlock! Where are you? You’ll never guess what I just—,” John’s thought processes screeched to a halt as he took in the scene in front of him.
Sherlock thought. He quickly averted his eyes, looking down. Then, because he couldn’t help it, his eyes darted upward to take another look.
“Defending his honor, huh?” Molly had said.
Anderson punched Greg on the arm hard and said, “Yeah, as if you’re not trying to get into her pants!”
“Uh… sure. Thanks,” said Sherlock.
Sherlock felt his fake frown begin to turn upside down at the energy John was exuding. He was just so much like a puppy it was hard not to be happy around him “Yeah, I’m starving,” he admitted.
“You lost your phone?”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock muttered, moving towards the kitchen once more.
“Come on, let’s get you to bed,” John said as Sherlock stood up shakily. “I’ve never seen you drink like that before,” he commented mildly.
“Oh, I’m
Molly and Greg knew. The three of them had been out at the pub one Friday night and John had been particularly frustrated with Sherlock that day (an “important” experiment had resulted in bits of spleen all over the kitchen) and he had drunk more than his usual share of alcohol.
John pulled his hand away as if scorched and stood up too quickly. The back of his left leg smacked the coffee table with a
Sherlock was up and walking in a millisecond. He opened the door and walked out into the hall.
John’s jaw dropped. He always
The silence felt nice. Companionable, really. Sherlock’s thoughts were running along the lines of past friendships (not that he’s had a lot of those) and the possibility of new ones, when John cleared his throat.
"The dorms are across the campus, in front of the soccer field," she said. "It has a great view at the back and all rooms are singles, as you probably already know. This ensures students’ privacy and comfort.”
“Yes. Yes. Greg. I don’t think I’ve ever conveyed my gratitude to you…for looking after Sherlock. I know you must have protected him from any number of uncomfortable situations.”
Tom smiled and took Benedict's face in his hands. "It is you." He kissed Benedict and caressed him, his back, his hips, back up to his hair, then his face. "I only just found out last night – you have to tell me everything. Everything."
"Aye, there are – none open this early, though." The man sniffed. "It's Sunday." His expression made quite clear his opinion of sleekly besuited men from London with expensive sports cars.
John was peering at him curiously, but said nothing for several moments. At length he turned to Sherlock. "I don't know if you heard, but I found something –"
"Sherlock, for God's sake –"
Sherlock joined John and held the door open for him. "You know how unlikely actual coincidence is."
"Who does?"
"Yes, we can do that." She directed her minions to pack up, and within fifteen minutes they were trooping out the door, leaving Mycroft, Anthea, and John alone with Sherlock.
He hadn’t even been arsed to hang up his little string of Christmas lights in the window. He rarely indulged in any of the usual Christmas twaddle, but the lights were a time-honoured tradition even during the worst Christmases. Sort of pagan, really, lights driving out the darkness on the shortest days of the year and what have you. But not this year. Laziness, he supposed. It wasn’t as if it was the worst Christmas of his life. Last Christmas had been utterly abysmal; in comparison, this year was like receiving a package in the post that turned out to be a human ear carefully packed in salt. In a word, fantastic.
"You're a brilliant father. That doesn't mean you won't make huge errors now and again." Sherlock stepped back, took a clean handkerchief from his coat pocket, and handed it to John.
Mary kissed John's mouth. "Still think I smell good enough to eat?"
Sherlock watched in silence as Mycroft addressed the server – footman, oh
Lady Howe's smile stayed nailed in place. "Mycroft, don't tell me you've come to talk business – not looking the way you do. You're simply marvellous in evening dress."
Sherlock thrashed fruitlessly again. "Don't," he said. "Don't do this."
"So presumably, if there was some sort of falling out that precipitated her murder, it happened after that. She did send him a Christmas card, not that it's overflowing with warmth. Keep looking, John." Sherlock found another Christmas card with a saccharine Nativity scene on the front: a dishwater-blonde, pale-skinned Mary and sappily doting Joseph looming over an impossibly rosy-cheeked blond infant Christ. Sherlock opened the card.
"Well, don't feel as if you've got to," Tom said, and leant forward. "Want a chocolate? They're fantastic, I can't stop eating them."
"Sherlock, Mycroft is not fat. I've known him for thirteen-odd years, and he's never been fat in all that time."
John scratched at the back of his neck. "How's your case going?"
"Because it's really exhausting sometimes, Sherlock."
"Oh, God in heaven," Moriarty sighed. "Nice try, Sherlock. Full marks."
Lord Moran didn't speak a word on the drive to Baker Street, presumably because there was no partition between them and the driver. That was perfectly acceptable. Sherlock wasn't in the mood for chatting just yet.
Benedict followed. It had always been difficult to repress his strongest convictions, and he was nearly bursting with a thousand pieces of advice and pleading. He'd keep his lips zipped, though.
He assembled the food and tea on a tray and brought it back to the coffee table. Benedict was lying full-length on the sofa, staring holes into the letter. "Creepy, isn't it?" Tom said, putting the tray down and sitting on the floor beside the sofa.
a rational person, and reasonably intelligent. There had been a few times in his life that had required what had felt like an extraordinary leap of faith:  first time on the football pitch, surrounded by bigger boys. Asking a girl to dance. First time he'd had sex, with a girl, then with a boy. His first oration in Greek. First time onstage. First time in front of the cameras. Afterwards, he'd marvelled at his own fright – sometimes, it was simply a matter of taking a deep breath and accepting the outcome of a decision. And he liked to think that he was still open to the world's extraordinary surprises.
John sighed. "Why did I know you were going to say that?" He didn't sound upset, though, and when he met Sherlock's gaze, his eyes twinkled. That was good. Very good. "Jesus," he said, looking around again. "This place is like a museum."
Finally satisfied, Sherlock closed the mirrored door and gasped in horror.
He dropped to Sherlock's side and peeled a tiny corner of the tape down, careful not to injure Sherlock's skin. Then he paused.
Benedict nodded. "Exactly the same. There are a few differences. Sherlock has better hair and skin. Takes a while for me to get all this." He tugged at a curl with a rueful grin. "His eyesight's better, too, and I guess he doesn't need to work out or eat in a particularly healthy fashion to stay in shape."
Benedict looked from John to Moriarty and back to John. He didn't understand –
"Darling." Irene caught Kate's hand and kissed the palm. "Not now, it's just too complicated. I'll send for you, I promise." She shrugged into a navy cashmere coat, supple as silk, and drew on a pair of gloves.
Presently they arrived at the Met. "Here we are, sir. My little girl will be so thrilled that I drove you."
"Hakuna frittata," John said, and Nora giggled. "Your mum's right, you'll love it – it's like scrambled eggs."
"Shall I call a doctor?"
"Henry's the big story right now." Tom's lips thinned into a stern line. "Luke mentioned it to me – he knows Henry slightly – but nobody's called, nor stopped round. I can't believe he hasn't said something."
John clutched his chest. "Jesus Christ."
"Sherlock Holmes to see Lord Moran."
John stood up. "Could I have a word with you outside?"
More comfort seemed to be in order. John hugged her closer and kissed her cheek. "Sorry, darling. I know you were just getting to know her again."
"I'm well aware." Mycroft dialled a number. "Holmes here. Begin the sequence, please." He nodded at Sherlock and stepped back.
Lecia twinkled a return smile at him and smoothed the skirt of her dress, a crisp sheath of china-blue linen. "As it happens, yes. Do you want a carrier bag? You're going to lose all that."
"No." Benedict stood still and clasped his hands behind his back. They were sweating. "I need you to do this, Mycroft."
it, Sherlock. God! You can keep a secret, can't you?"
"He's got a dodgy knee, but he's been a stubborn bugger about getting it looked after," John said.
Sherlock set Cumberbatch's phone on the kitchen table. "No."
Nora obediently kissed him and slumped in her seat, but didn't take her eyes off John. "I don't want to stay here."
"Please," he whispered, and then went to pack.
"Okay. I'll try to check back in a bit." John hesitated, then bent and tenderly kissed Sherlock's cheek. "See you later."
Sherlock waited beside him, turning to watch the foot traffic in front of Dedalus Communications. A Greek food truck painted blue and white squatted next to the kerb, sending out aromas of souvlaki, moussaka, and halloumi, reminding Sherlock he hadn't bothered with any of the free food. He tilted his nose and sniffed as a woman walked by munching on an enormous gyro.
"Oh my God. I didn't – didn't I say? You're famous, you are, John Watson, and have been since the late eighteen hundreds. A man by the name of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote dozens of stories about Holmes and Watson, and they've been best-sellers forever. There have been movies, earlier television series, animated versions, radio plays, et cetera, et cetera. Everyone loves you, and Sherlock too. The whole world knows the names of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. It's wonderful to be a part of that. I love it to bits."
Impulsively, John put his hand out.
"I'm fine," Sherlock insisted.
"Not that that matters," John muttered.
"Jesus, John – are you okay, love? You're not hurt?"
"If you'd like me to stay dirty, say the word," Sherlock said, and drew his hands through his hair. "By the way, your hair is disastrous. You should think about cutting it short if you can't control it."
Bloody hell. John was one thing; they hadn't been living together too long, if the timeline was as Benedict suspected, but Mycroft…Sherlock's own brother, canonically more intelligent, certainly devious, at least the way Mark played him (and that was Mark's identical twin standing there, so logically, or at least as logical as one could be in this phenomenally weird situation, it was sound to align personalities), and not a little scary, staring at him with cold, narrowed eyes.
TWH shivered. "What…what are you going to do to me?"
"Not worth it right now," Sherlock said, and replaced his mask. "Still, maybe later. Put that book down and make yourself useful. There's a ton of hair that needs bagging."
Sherlock straightened and smiled again, backing out of IE. "Sorry. Just checking Twitter. I don't want this going public, if you know what I mean."
"Erm…." Mary took it and sprang up. "You can chat with me while I get ready. How was your day? Did Beauchamp come back from Aruba?"
John turned to Sherlock. "What –" He looked back at the screen. A picture of a young, ferrety, and vaguely familiar-looking man had replaced the journalist.
"Almost."
"Why?"
"Yes. Hope you drink red."
and it wasn't a fucking set in Cardiff, there was traffic and running water, and John was there, John fucking Watson –" Benedict drew a breath, only dimly aware that he was crying. "And I was in a London I thought we'd invented, do you understand? It's not the Doyle canon as it was written, it's mostly a figment of Steven and Mark's imagination, and he looks like
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked down at Loo. Her hair was a bit mussed and she was examining the skirt of her dress carefully, but she didn't seem terribly annoyed. "Mo – my goodness. Erm." His voice shook a bit.
Sherlock turned back to John. "It wasn't just for you," he replied coolly. "It should have been done a long time ago."
"You're sure? Oh, good, I feel so much better," Sherlock snapped. "You're sure – how, exactly? You've no idea what Moriarty is like, and there's no way to be certain that Cumberbatch hasn't cocked the whole thing up. One wrong word and John could be – never mind."
"Living parents? Close friends?"
, Sherlock." John exhaled heavily. "You've got a list of fugitive Nazis, an entire fucking book of them in your pocket. You don't find that creepy?"
A group of guys stood on the threshold like a pack of wolves, grinning at John.
He listed names in his head he didn’t want it to be, taunting faces blurring into one huge confusing collage. There were actually decent people at school. Or to be more accurate, people who just ignored him.
Sherlock gulped, trying hard to look at anything else but John. “Umm… yeah. Couldn’t really sleep,” he mumbled. He decided then and there that doing something was the best solution to his discomfort, so he stepped into the shower two stalls away and proceeded to strip. He turned the water on and let it soothe him.
She shut the door and John was dragged to the bed where she pushed him to sitting and promptly sat next to him, inching towards him until their thighs touched. He cleared his throat and shifted a bit, trying to put some space between them.
Greg came back with a glass of water and some aspirin. He placed them on the bedside table and sat next to John. All three of them were silent for a while.
. All muscular shoulders and thighs and strong calves and oh – Sherlock has never felt this way before. He was wrong. There was absolutely nothing similar about his previous experience to this. His eyes ran up and down John. He couldn’t look away even if he wanted to. He was gone.
He considered making an excuse to get out of his offer to eat breakfast together with Sherlock but… He didn’t want to. Honestly, what he wanted was to see Sherlock again. Maybe make him laugh a bit or get a glimpse of that beautiful neck while it arched-
John frowned again. He was bothered by how much he was bothered that Sherlock seemed to not want to take care of himself. Maybe he should get him to eat. He was way too skinny. Not that John minded. He turned off the shower and dried himself off. Wrapping his towel around his waist, he started walking towards Sherlock’s stall.
+++++++++++++++
his mind bitterly spat out.
“I don’t really know. I’m technologically-challenged,” John said, then winced. “I mean, I’m not stupid or anything like that but I still believe in actual conversations and like, you know, actual dating. Stuff like that.”
“C’mon, John,” she murmured. “I know you’re not dating anybody… And I miss you…” She started to kiss his neck.
, but most of his mind was running around in frantic circles. The injuries that he didn't remember getting, being found in a place he had no business of being, and the wrinkles on his face, it all made sense, he knew he was barely thirty and now he would be, what, forty? An old man? What had happened to him, what...
But sometimes, very, very rarely, John wanted to drown his life in a glass, wanted to feel terribly sick for two days, wanted to put distance between himself and what was happening.
“Sentiment?”
John was applying bandages as he went along, but there were still dirty and bleeding wounds. He kept working, concentrating on cleaning and dressing as he would with any other patient. Harry had run down and was silent for once, watching him. John suppressed a sigh. He knew from experience that there were two options now, given Harry’s state of inebriation. She would either become whiny and self-pitying, or she would start to needle him. He wondered idly which of those would be preferable, and if he could finish the job and get out of there before Harry got started.
Damn. He had forgotten about the fourth man.
“You have me at a disadvantage, Nurse...”
“PTSD?” John asked at length.
Sherlock looked up at the sliver of sky visible between the buildings. "Physically he's well enough for someone who was beaten into unconsciousness", he said. "His body will heal. There doesn't even seem to be a concussion which is lucky, given that he was kicked in the head." He paused to discard the now empty coffee cup and light another cigarette. "There is no apparent brain damage, but they are scanning him again nevertheless. His doctor suspects a fugue state."
It was true, he did feel tired. He nodded once. “I'm not going anywhere”, he said vaguely as he closed his eyes. Whatever had happened last night after they left the club, he was sure he would remember soon.
Brawn chuckled as he saw that John was fenced in. “Yeah, mate, no problem”, he said in a mocking sing-song voice, “but first gi' us your money, right? We'll have that off of you. Phone too if you've got one.” He held out his hand, crooking his fingers as if expecting John to hand over his wallet and phone without protest.
As soon as he stepped out of the pub, the cool night air hit him like a brick. “Oooh Jesus…” he groaned, just managing to put out a hand against the wall to steady himself, eyes closed and head bowed. He took a few deep breaths against the dizzyness that swept through him. “Increased oxygen flow”, his medical knowledge supplied, “combined with a change of posture, sends more alcohol to the brain.” He groaned again. Medical facts wouldn't help him when he was feeling like he was strapped into a funfair ride. He swallowed a few times, then opened his eyes. There, that was better.
Time passes. Time stands still. The fire in the fireplace flickers eternally, casting light and shadow over the two men. Somewhere else, a world is waiting.
“Harry’s been in a fight, she’s been arrested. And since I’m next of kin, I’ve got to bail her out. Look, I’ve got to go, will you be alright here?”
“Good, good”, John muttered and went to make his way upstairs.
I apologise for the late update; real life and a persistent cold made my brain too fuzzy to write. But you're getting a double chapter as compensation.
Unexpectedly, the scents he breathed in from the coat – warm wool, stale cigarette smoke, with a hint of an after-shave he couldn't place – helped to make him calm down and feel more secure. He knew of course that the sense of smell was most connected to emotions and memories, and this more than anything Sherlock had said convinced him that they were indeed good friends. He sighed.
The lights in the pub flashed a few times, then settled into uncomfortable brightness that illuminated the remaining patrons, an international sign for last orders. “Time, gentlemen, please”, the gruff voice of the proprietor announced, still using the traditional phrase despite the relaxed licensing laws, and he started to collect the remaining empty glasses from the tables. Time, yes. Time to go home.
OMG an update! (I know, right?) I'm sorry it took me so long to get back to this. I had some serious plotting issues but they seem to be resolved now (fingers crossed). I will not abandon this story, and I thank you for sticking with it. I appreciate you all.
John appreciated the warning, because of course Mycroft called. As if John had any influence over whether Sherlock took a case or not.
Overhead a helicopter flew through the skies of London. John heard someone come into the church and sit down next to him. He looked up at the face of the young man with short red hair and a riot of freckles on his face, and smiled a greeting. The man just looked at him sadly. "Why did you have to save me, John?" he asked in a soft voice.
“That night, last time we met,” Siobhan continued hesitantly, “that was... really good... but...”
Sherlock was spending his time in the morgue examining the latest murder victim in minute detail. He had even rounded up Molly, who for some reason unknown to him appeared to be working Sundays.
After a few moments' consideration, Carlton shrugged and went to unfasten the restraints. John rubbed his wrists and sat a little more upright in the bed. “Thank you”, he said, “I appreciate this.”
He swallows the pill. For a moment, there is certainty, triumph, elation – then there is pain, defeat, resignation, and darkness.
“I knew it was real. I know a real gun when I see one.”
“Oh, a few ideas. John?”
“Yes.”
When John returned to Baker Street, Sherlock was nowhere to be found, something which suited John well. He didn't feel up to explaining where the wine on his clothes and the wound on his head had come from. He peeled off his clothes and chucked them into the wash, then took a shower to get the dried and sticky wine out of his hair. After towelling himself off, he checked his head in the bathroom mirror. There was a swelling where the bottle had hit him, and a small laceration that, although it had bled profusely, wasn't as deep as he'd initially thought.
Instead, the skin of his hands was more wrinkly than he was used to, the lines on his palms deeper, his fingertips rougher and a little calloused. Some of those callouses were in unexpected places, not from handling surgical implements. What had he been doing for the last ten years?
“Quite possibly, with your head injury. Does it hurt?”
Sherlock nodded. “Yes”, he confirmed, “and your flatmate, and your friend. Just friend, don't worry. We've been sharing a flat for a year and a half now, and we work together.”
Infinite worlds turn. The game is played again and again. Worlds change, rules are created, discarded, kept.
“Of course”, he said. “Tony Blair, he just got re-elected on Thursday. I sat my last exam that day.” He looked closely at Stephanie. “So, did I pass?”
John looked Brawn in the eyes, trying to stare the youth down. “No”, he repeated, a little louder and more forceful this time.
“Hope was right there. I couldn't tell you or he'd have left and the chance to get him would be gone.”
“I taught...” John frowned. This man, Sherlock Holmes, was an easier puzzle to solve than his missing memories, at least for the moment. “Who are you? I mean, who are you to me? I should obviously know you, but, well...”
He struggled to wake up, brightness flashing by overhead even behind his closed eyelids. There were loud voices speaking gibberish. He was sure that if he concentrated just a little bit, he would be able to understand them, but his head hurt too much. He still felt cold, but he didn't hurt that much any more, and for that he was thankful. He breathed in carefully. Familiar smells. Antiseptic, blood, bandages. The voices sounded tense but professional. He was in a hospital, then. Good. They would take care of him. He trusted them. They were doctors, just like him. Whatever had happened to hurt him, here he was safe. He relaxed and let unconsciousness take him again.
John frowned. “That's on the other side of London from where we were. How did I get there from Waterloo?” Another thought occurred to him. “What about Mike, and Jamal and Kirsty? Were they mugged too?”
John tried to clear his throat, wondering where the black-haired person had gone. “Yes, please”, he whispered, and a blonde, softly curved nurse stepped into his field of vision, holding a cup and a straw which she gently directed into his mouth. He sucked in a few sips and swallowed gratefully. “Thank you”, he said when he was finished, already feeling a little better. The nurse put the cup away and returned with a pen light, holding his eyelids open and shining it into his eyes. “Concussion?” he asked in a murmur.
