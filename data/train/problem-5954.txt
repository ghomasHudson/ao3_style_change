… to see if the sound of footsteps will return back once again. When five minutes passed and there was no sign of someone coming back, the teen sprint into action, standing shakily on his legs before taking his suitcase from under the bed, opening it and throwing everything of necessity to him in it, before slamming the suitcase shut when he was done and rushing out of his room hoping that he will be able to leave before He comes back and finishes what he was planning to do.
Steve had been hard at work since eight in the morning it was reaching the stroke of twelve and Steve was happy with his progress he had mopped the floors and cleaned the kitchen along with dusting and changing all the sheets and curtains. Steve doesn't want to brag but he could see his reflection on the floors after he was done with them, and now all that was left was vacuuming the upstairs carpet and the restrooms.
J's words got another curse from Tony, all the Avengers were with him in the workshops, wearing their gears, ready to leave any second Tony will provide them the go-ahead, they just need to find where Steven's location was. "What about you, Edith?" Tony asked desperately; he was still feeling guilty. If only he didn't leave when Steven ordered him to, then maybe the Hydra agents wouldn't have overwhelmed Steven and sedated him.
This time it will be a Stucky one!
16-Herra minn, við höfum fundið þá, fimmtán alls. -My lord, we have found them, fifteen one in total.
"Please, be strong." Steve plea with his friend running toward the ambulance that contains the pup, the paramedics were hastate to let him ride with them, but the Beta from before told them to let him.
people truly were, forcing Omegas from all kind to be nothing but pets, dressing up only in dresses and acting only in one way, never raising their heads, and accepting Alphas' wondering hands without a word or a pip of refusal, his people respected Omegas as bringers of life, they never forced them to act all feminine, only to act as themselves… it made him wonder if the Hydra king wants his death to be sooner than later.
"Not… n-not a lot, but I remember…" Steve's voice cracked as he said those words, taking a shuddered breath before looking at Bucky who was still gazing at Steve with so much hope in his eyes. "W-we were going back home after an appointment with the doctor… you wanted to name our girl Sarah but I hated that… I wanted her to live her life as her own, not a reminder of Ma…" Steve's voice cracked when he heard Bucky let out a sob, clenching his hands into tight fists Steve continued. "Tony Stark crossed the red light and ended up T-boning the car on my side, I… I couldn't even warn you, it happened so fast that I…" Steve's voice trailed off, his lips trembling when Bucky slide down the ground and put his head on Steve's knees, his shoulders were shaking as he started whispering 'Sorry' over and over again. "I… I am so sorry I couldn't remember… so sorry for causing troubles…" Steve sniffled as he put one of his hands on Bucky's head and run it through his husband's tangled hair…
And we got to know more about Steven's relationship with his Tony!
"Actually, he is the boss from the start." Tony said which made Bucky whistle at that, looking at Tony with a knowing look, as he nodded his head when everyone looked at Bucky for confirmation. "Which is why I didn't go and pummel Howard to death at this moment, knowing Steve he broke him completely." Tony said as he glared at Howard who was hissing when Jarvis pulled at his broken nose harsher then it takes to reset it.
Tony was stress, so stressed that he knows if he didn't find anything to take the stress out, he will commit a murder; as hard as that sounded, Tony was prepared to kill everyone in the room with him and then kill himself, just to get rid of the stress that kept on increasing because of a certain Addams who doesn't know when to stop or what the word No meant.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Think? Tony, we know it is haunted!" Rhodey hissed, keeping his voice down, last he startled Morgan who was cooing and drinking her milk. "Do you know what I found when I went to search in the town's hall? The owners of the house, the Rogers, their son didn't die of sickness like everyone says he did! He was killed here, drown in the same lake we went fishing in a few days ago; tell me, did Mr. Carter tell you about this when she sold you the house?" Rhodey asked and Tony can see the desperation in his eyes, the way Rhodey pleads with Tony to think this through and just come with them, that they will protect Tony.
Steve was stupid, he was so, so stupid because he left his home and let Tony get to him, he had endangered his baby's life because he couldn't handle Tony being with someone else, he nearly hurt his baby who was innocent in all of this; how stupid can Steve be? He knew that someone was stalking him, but he still went to his friends' unprotected apartment, not only endangering his life but theirs as well.
It was either a stroke of dumb luck on Steve's side, or the doctors and nurses were happy that he was leaving, that no one came to stop him from leaving the hospital; even if Bucky and Becky were to search for him, Steve would have managed to contact Tony by then that he wouldn't need to fear the consequences.
The Alpha snarled, which made everyone froze in disbelief, eyes going wide when they realized that the man used his voice, and when they did, Howard let out a raging shout; he was ready to pummel Stane to the ground, however, he was stopped by Tony who had a blank face. Howard shook, wondering what would happen to his son now that Stane had used his voice on him, but he was stopped for the second time from attacking the Alpha by Peggy, who nodded towards Tony, which made Howard turn to study the Omega, his eyes widening a little when Tony resisted the command.
… went unsaid, but Steve can hear it as loud as his heartbeat that was pounding in his ears.
The sound of the desperate meowing coming from the box and Rogers frowning and shushing it after shaking the box harshly broke Tony from his frozen state, and he rushed to take the box out of Rogers's hands. "Are you crazy? It's still alive!" Tony cried out as he opened the box to free the cat, squeaking and letting go of the box when he saw what could be qualified as roadkill inside of the box, looking at him with dead yellow eyes before standing on its legs and run as fast as it can on its broken spine, which was really fast if Tony has to say so.
About Steve's true age:
Bucky stopped when he reached the edge of the webs, not going in for the fear of being stuck in the webs. Bucky-doll let out a few squeaks and squeals, which were answered not a few moments later with chirps and whistles and the sounds of skittering following the chirps. Serpentine raised her eyebrow when she noticed the shoe-size (Red?) black widow, making its way toward them.
Tony whimpered as he tried to stand on his shaky legs, letting out a cry of pain when his left leg gave out of him; taking deep and shaky breaths, Tony let out a huffed breath as he hoppled toward the lake hoping that by some miracle Rogers was still here and wasn't angry at Tony for his display hours ago.
Humming to himself, Anton gave an amusing grin as he stood up, leaving the Shield on the table as he went to find the queen; it would be interesting to see Steven's reaction to seeing his Shield after all these years. Maybe the queen would stop fighting him every step of the way like they were enemies instead of allies.
The doctor had told him that his son was sick, he was sick with something called 'Leukemia' some type of blood cancer, Steve remembered crying and begging the doctor to save his son, that if they want they can take all of his blood or do something to save him! He remembers the doctor's sympathy, but Steve didn't care, he felt broken, it was like his mother all over again, his baby was sick, and it was Steve's fault…
Tony shook in his place, the horror of what he nearly did finally starting to seep into him, making Tony nearly lose his footing. The horrifying scene of Steve crying was still fresh on his mind, playing at the same time as Peter's scene when the small boy found them; tears clouded Tony's eyes as he tried to catch his breath, only now realizing the gravity of what he did.
Tony stayed in his place for a few more minutes, not knowing how to act, and a part of his mind refusing to make any connection between the doll and Bucky Barnes. No, nope, nada, yadda, Bucky Barnes didn't turn into a doll, Bucky Barnes was probably away, trying to chase Steve's ass and force him to return his undying love, Bucky Barnes wasn't cursed into a doll because he threatened him about his doomed date with Steve, that was just Tony's imagination, that's it, that's the thing, it's Tony's imagination.
A small burst of childish giggle came from behind the door, causing the woman's breath to leave her in a rush, her eyes widen even more as the past came to embrace her once more, causing her to suffocate. In and out, in and out… the woman whispered inside her mind as she finally managed to calm down, raising her shaky hand and knocking on the door, wondering how foolish and stupid she was to return back to this house after all these years.
"Daddy, Mr. Steve!" A whiny voice made both Steve and Tony look up from their place on the floor (The two had fallen without noticing) to look up at Peter who was gazing at them with the most heartbreaking pout in the world. "What about me? You promised you will call me if something fun happened…" Peter sniffled; gazing at Tony with a look that told Tony, Peter was so disappointed in him (Damn Aunt Peggy! What did you teach his boy?)
The woman scrunched her nose and huffed, gazing at Tony up and down before looking him in the eyes. "My name is Peggy Rogers, Steven's wife, I came to see him and our child; I would ask once more, is Steven home?" The woman… Peggy, stated, causing Tony to pause and blink his eyes, only for a deep scowl to take over his face when her words made sense to his shocked brain. Her husband and child? Is she real? She is talking about his husband like the man didn't leave her for abusing Peter and acting like everything is alright!
"It's not only about you not telling me! You knew that I could have found him in less than an hour if you told me; do you even realize what could happen to Harley on the streets? Drugs addicts, murders, for God's sake even pedophiles would have kidnapped him! And you think I am angry at you for not telling me? I am furious!" Tony snarled taking a step forward causing Betty to flinch and take a step back. "How the hell can I even trust you with Harley's wellbeing when you couldn't protect him the first time? He is staying here and this is final!" Tony crossed his arms over his chest, glaring down at Betty.
"Oh…" Steven breathed as he rose up causing Tony who was standing near Peter looking out of the window turn to him with a lifted eyebrow, waiting for him to say something when he caught the recognition on Steven's face, which caused Steven to shuffle uncomfortably when Peter shifted his eyes to him with a hopeful glance. "It seems that you have been speaking about me." Steven mumbled which made Peter scrunch his nose in confusion. "The second star to the right is my caretaker; I'm the one underneath it, the one that disappeared…" Steven said awkwardly when he saw the realization painting Tony and Peter's faces.
When the Ancient One left, she left everyone with the feeling of confusion, fear, helplessness, and so much more emotions than everyone wonders how they were even able to hear all of this and still not run away screaming bloody murder, the Omegas of the group looked at each other with fear and confusion, the geniuses of the group running through all the possibilities of what they just heard, the Alphas looked at each other with confusion and determent, everyone didn't know what to do, and they could only stare at Steven that was attached to the IV and heart-monitor looking at his glasses, then wear them and looking at the ceiling.
Finally Steve and Tony talk! I don't know but maybe it was a little rushed?
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve turned his head to the side after blinking his eyes to adjust his vision, Steve was sure he was dead after all a direct hit with the missile would kill anyone even a super-soldier, he may have had a small chance of survival if he wasn't injured, but his body was broken when that missile hit, so Steve was sure he was dead, he looked at the person sitting by his bedside and gave a smile, he knew he was dead, after all this person in front of him had died a long time now, and it made Steve's heart flutter in happiness at being able to see that person again.
Tony hummed to himself as he tucked the clothes in the basket, dividing them into their designed places; it had been a few months since the conversation with Steve had taken place, months since the two of them became closer and closer every moment that took place, so close that Tony realized he couldn’t imagine his life without Steve and Peter in it anymore. Tony was so grateful to Steve and Peter, so thankful that they remained with him even knowing that he was damaged and there is no hope of getting better, even when Steve spent his days assuring Tony that things are going to be fine, he just have to wait and see.
Tony shivered as the voices echoed in his head, getting louder and louder, causing his breath to hitch. Tony curls around himself, hoping to wake up soon from this cruel nightmare, hoping that the cold and emptiness will leave him. It made Tony wonder, how can he have a nightmare and still realize it was one? Tony never had a strange dream like that before.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence, maybe fluff, Tony being mean, and poor Steve! All reviews are appreciated.
When Tony was out of sight like someone possessed Bucky rushed toward Howard snarling, the screams of terror behind him were unheard as Bucky throws punch after punch with his metal arm, taking in the pleasure when he heard Howard's nose break under his strong fist when he was pulled from the Alpha, Bucky struggled and screamed and shouted, it was only the growl of Peggy Carter that froze him in his place, because if one thing was known, the woman was a prime Alpha, not even Alphas can disobey her.
when he was known to never take any survivor not even a babe recently birth… except… Jamti sighed at that and returned his gaze to the Omega that was surrounded by his people as they tried to shield him away from everyone's eyes. "Come on foolish princess, we do not have the whole day for you to pretty up!" Starkad snapped at the Omega which got him glares and hisses from the people surrounded the said Omega.
"I think you already know why I am here Officer Fury, so cut the chase, what do you know about Steven Rogers and this town?" Tony asked, irritation coloring his voice as he glared at the man sitting in front of him. Tony was a little unease with how uncaring Fury was, but at the same time it made him relax a little, with the way he was acting, Fury was unlikely to sing Steven Rogers praises and look at him like he was a God on earth.
"Can I help you, my queen?" A voice asked which made the Omega turn around to look at the speaker, only to narrow his eyes when an Alpha with a black hair and green eyes greeted him, a little pause made Steven memories inform him that the Alpha in front of him was the one who was there on the night of the Hydra kingdom destruction, and the Omega pressed his lips tightly, the Alpha didn't look like he was after a fight, so maybe…
The man Steve was sure was the love of his life, the Alpha with dark brown hair, and chocolate eyes. Their first meeting was not that much of a meeting, more of the Alpha hitting him with his car because Steve was in such a hurry that he didn't pay attention, thankfully instead of panicking or running away, Anthony had taken him straight to the hospital, the poor Alpha had apologized over and over again until Steve waved it off saying that it was his fault and not the Alpha's. As much as the Alpha complained that he had a work that day, he still stayed with Steve in the hospital the whole day talking with him, and he visited the next day, and the next, until Steve was discharged from the hospital a week later, with his left shoulder in a case.
"Oh, God, you are finally awake…" Peggy's voice cracked as she ran her hand over his face and hair, trying to reassure herself no doubt that Steve was awake; the action was so familiar that it brought tears into his eyes, causing Steve to sob, taking shuddered breathes as he tried to calm himself.
"Does James share the same sentiment as you?" Anton raised his brow, decided to go and retrieve his clothes, the chance of taking a bath has long since gone without return, leaving Anton grumbling in his place; Anton just had to post point his bath until another time, when noisy Omegas weren't there to annoy him.
"Am I… am I dreaming?" Sarah asked, taking a step after step toward the young man, wanting to touch him so much but is afraid that if she did, the man would vanish, leaving Sarah in the ruins of her once beloved home.
So what? Part of Anton snapped, glaring at everything in front of him as he marched once more toward his workshop, trying to ignore how his Alpha's hackles were raising and raising and how his hands clenched tightly wanting to punch something or someone until it gave up and blood started to ooze out. So what if the foolish queen decided to get remarried? So what if he refused to wait before remarrying? Or decided to marry someone from his people? It wasn't like it was any of Anton's business to feel angry about how foolish the Omega was… the Omega has nothing to his name, nothing! Does the Omega know how hard he would be forced to work to gather the dowry for marriage even when the person who proposed said he didn't want one? Or that his guardian should at least know about the Omega remarrying? Does the Omega even have a guardian at all?
Asked Peggy in a serious voice making Tony raise his head a little when he heard footsteps running outside of the office, he hid under his father's disk. "Some people broke into the house, I don't know how many but from their footsteps they are a lot of them, and they shot Jarvis!" Tony's breathing speed up as he heard footsteps getting closer and closer.
It was hectic months and admittedly Tony was tired all the time, between helping SI create the patches, going to his therapy twice a week, and taking care of his baby, who finally turned five years old not a week ago; every time Tony saw his child he tears up, for Peter was healthy and growing, how long did he wish for his baby to have the childhood he always deserves, and to Tony's delight his prayers were answered against all odds.
So when Steve finally entrusted him with Peter for a whole day, you can say that Tony was ecstasy at the thought of spending the whole day with Peter, a whole day with his son… just the thought made Tony buzz as happy as a bee in a meadow of flowers, even spent the day before that going with Peter about the places the small boy will love to see, though the pup jumped up and down at the thought of seeing his lab in the Stark tower, which made the Alpha puff his chest in pride and happiness at the thought of his boy wanting to spend the day with him in the labs to invent and tinker…
"H-heat?" Tony squeaked; hating how his voice was high pitched when he nearly shrieked the word out, he ended blinking his eyes in disbelieve, the notion of going into heat after years of nothing kind of overwhelmed him, for he thought that his body was too damage from malnutrition and abuse that he wouldn't have any more heats, nor have any other child after Peter, but the thought of his heat approaching after years made Tony's head reeling.
It made Steve wonder when he would wake up from this nightmare, it made him want to ask for Dr. Strange so he would send him back home, but he always paused at that remembering that Dr. Strange start learning the ways of mystic arts in 2016 that if he told Peggy to bring the man to him, there would be a possibility for him not getting into the accident that shaped his future to become the best sorcerer that was known after the Ancient One, and he was afraid to call the woman least some damage was done to this universe.
A harsh sigh left Steven when he saw the two boys run toward the village square once more, squealing in delight as they rushed to see the bear that was the talk of the village. Thinking of his options, Steven gritted his teeth as he started walking to the king's massive home, wanting to have the conversation there and not anywhere near where his people resident last he strangled the Alpha. The king seemed to catch on to his line of thoughts, for the man shut his mouth and didn't start any conversation until they reached the house, which Steven was grateful for because if the man had dared to open his mouth before Steven was ready to hear him, he would have castrated the Alpha right here in front of anyone who would see.
"Oh, great, great, blond, blue eyes, and a secretly abusive A-hole; great job." Tony pouted hard, stabbing his ice-cream as he thought about his marriage with a dark cloud surrounding him this time, he should have known, he should have turned into a monk or a priest after Ty, no, not after Ty, after Sunset, but Tony was an idiot and he hoped, even with Steve, which turned out that Steve was probably worse than Ty, being an Addams and all.
going to take you." Steve growled the possessiveness in his voice causing Tony to shiver in anticipation; to prove his words, Steve withdrew his fingers; it took only a few moments for Steve to lower his suit pants until his cock was free before he positions himself and sank into Tony's heat.
"Greetings Avengers, welcome to Asgard, my name is Frigga I will be the one to take you to meet Odin." The calm sound of the woman made them look up to see them waiting for them on the top of the stairs, which caused everyone to bow to the woman when they saw Steven do it.
So what do you think?
Their silence was cut by Jarvis who hummed and looked at Steve like only now he remembered something. "Say, Steve, what happened to those doctors and nurses who were responsible for Master Anthony, ever since that night when Dr. Banner was assigned for Master Anthony I never saw them?" Jarvis asked making Steve scowl at the mention of them.
After they finished packing, Tony stood with Steve outside, waiting for Bucky to start the car and drive Steve to the airport, it would have been a swift exit for Steve if Harley and Peter didn't choose that time to return from Clint's house and pester Steve about where he was going and what he should buy them… well, it was Peter who was pestering poor Steve and jumping all over the place, Harley was just shifting and looking at the ground like Steve kicked his puppy. That was the scenario that both Tony and Steve tried to avoid, well, it was Steve who tried to avoid that scenario, mainly because how Peter was becoming more demanding when he sees one of them about to leave for a small amount of time, at least Steve was going to return next week so Peter didn't kick a strong fuss about the matter.
I really hope that you liked the chapter anyway.
"Wait, I thought Uncle Gomez and Fester ended up killing Dad, why didn't you tell me about this?" Steve asked part of him intrigued with his mother's story, and a part of him still thinking over what his mother advised him, so it was either he goes out with someone that will love him for who he was but he will never love them like he loves Tony, or trying to act like (He is getting sick just thinking about it) normal for the rest of his life just to be with Tony, and ending up hating him in the end.
Oh, God please, please, please, please! Please save his baby, please. Chant Tony as he put a piece of clothes with cold water on his son's forehead, his son was whining in pain, making Tony held his tears as he nearly gags at the scent of sickness.
"I really don't know, Tony, I have Peter to think of." Steve said carefully which made the Alpha look at Steve because it wasn't a no, but it wasn't a yes either, but it gave him hope, hope that maybe Steve will give him a chance in the end, after all this was his sweetheart, his lovely smart Omega who always forgive everyone… who wasn't a bully that was.
"She is beautiful…" Tony whispered, his finger gently caressing his daughter's cheek, causing the baby to scrunch her face before snuggling into Tony's chest, causing the Omega to let out a happy laugh, enchanted by his baby's action and a falling more in love. His husband seemed to have the same thought, for he didn't leave Tony's side, sitting on the hospital bed beside Tony as he held the Omega and the baby tightly, not letting go as he gazed at the baby with awe in his eyes.
In the end, Tony decided to take care of everything in the morning, and fumbles his way up to the house locking the door tightly behind him, even putting a table and a chair before going to the kitchen to pour himself a glass of water, the glass clattering against his teeth as he takes slow, careful sips. He turns on the cold tap and holds his wrists under the water until his fingers turn numb, staring blankly as the water circles the drain.
"It is because of the Ancient One's heart." It was Thor who accepted to explain, saving Steven from suffering to explain the matters to his band of merry. "No one in Midgard knew, but the ancient realms are experienced in the legends of the stars in the sky. A star's heart is the most powerful form of magic, not only can you forge the most powerful weapons in the universe in the heart of a dying star… but consuming a star's heart will grant you immortality." That statement got Thor noises of surprises and distress.
"Yeah! I put ever sweet with blueberry in it!" Peter chirped happily which made an amused smile stretch over both Steve and Tony's faces, so that's how. The harsh knocking on the door made Tony and Steve frown; Tony though, already had a feeling that he knows who was knocking on the door so he stood up and went to open the door. Just as Tony expected a frazzled Betty was standing outside of the door with dark bags under her eyes.
A few seconds later, a harsh gust of winds blows up inside the plane, causing Tony to narrow his eyes and turn to the side, only for an insane grin to take over his face when he noticed his husband standing beside him, covered in blood from head to toe with a shivering mess that was no doubt the Mandarin kneeling beside him. "You are late!" Tony said happily, his eyes not leaving the shivering man at all, his mind going through all the nasty ways of how to make him suffer and what sort of painful death he was going to receive.
"Just as soon as we find where they are staying." Steven said as he starts walking, looking around the place hoping to spot someone familiar, his heart was pounding uncontrollably in his chest, especially when people stopped in their places and start gazing at him while whispering and pointing, and Steven wondered if he should return to the king's house, maybe demand that he be the one to escort him, which will probably get him a screaming match with the Alpha and the man refusing to let Steven leave the house again, so the Omega kept quiet and walked around, trying to push his fear and heartbreak in the back of his mind as he tried to search for someone from his friends.
She knew it was wrong of her to go to the Omega's house, to force herself on the Omega and the pup's hands after what Howard did to them, but she couldn't help it, she couldn't, she wanted to see the Omega who stole her son's heart, she wanted to see her grandchild, she wanted to say sorry because if she knew about Steve and Tony back then, she would have helped the two of them to run away from Howard even if it hurt her in the end, but she didn't, she didn't help, she didn't notice, she didn't care enough… it was her fault that the pup was sitting all alone on the front porch, tinkering with whatever it was in his small hands without his father by his side to help him and smile at him proudly when he did something right.
What Tony couldn't wrap his head on was how everyone seemed to be swooning over Rogers. At first, it was only Bucky who was madly in love with the man. Then it became two when Thor started showing interest in said man, always telling him about how Rogers reminded Thor of home and his brother (Tony still refuse to think about that statement, uh-huh, nope, he was not coming near that line of thought at all). Then Natasha came into the mix, something about her always having a crush on the man and that said man was the one who trained her when she was still in the Red Room. Then Clint hopped on board in a creepy way really, because Tony may or may not have caught the man stealing Rogers' underwear… and the most surprising development was Bruce… something about Rogers not fearing the Hulk and seeing Bruce as a real person… Needless to say, Tony was 100% sure that Rogers brainwashed his teammates.
So what do you think?
Steve will admit that he was a little jealous; jealous of Tony, Peter, Peggy, Bucky, Thor, everyone! He was so jealous of how they could sleep whenever they like and still wake up in the morning or any time they liked. Not like Steve, who can't stay awake when the sun rises and show him its face.
With that Peggy started telling him in the most gentle voice she can about his life… his real life and not the made-up one she thinks of… she told him about his husband, James, who is also known as Bucky by their friends; she told them how the two of them were childhood friends that became husbands and mates when the graduated college and how the two of them had been practicing together since high school. She told him about the Barnes family, his mother-in-law Winnie, his father-in-law George, and his sister-in-law Rebecca 'Becky' Proctor and her husband and their six months old boy… she told him about Daniel and their eight years old daughter Sharon. Told him about the car accident he and Bucky had seven years ago, how the two of them were coming back from their doctor appointment when a reckless driver hit their car from Steve's side; she told him about Bucky visiting him every day and how he fared without Steve. She told him about there being no one by the name Tony in Steve's life… she told him so many lies (Truths?) that his head start spinning and his heart was pounding uncontrollably in his chest.
Steve tried to hold back from crying or even cursing, wondering why his husband was acting like a grade A asshole; part of Steve was curious about what happened between the brothers to make them act like this toward each other, but another part was tired of them continuously fighting. Steve doesn't want to be thrown into the Stark family's affairs, especially when he wasn't welcomed by them most of the time.
That night though, Tony stood up, gazing at the lake that seemed to gaze back at him, Tony not knowing what to do or say; frowning at the overturned grass and mud on the shore, before taking a big breathe and return his gaze once more to the lake. "I'm pregnant… I guess you know that already, it's not like I was hiding it or anything…" Tony shifted in his place, turning his gaze to his house for a second where he knows that Pepper and Rhodey were preparing dinner, then he turns his face to the dark water that seems almost inky black in the night. "It's a girl, I learned her gender today." Tony wet his lips before biting the lower one. "Look Rogers, I don't care what you want from me, or if you want to kick me out of the house or something, but please, whatever happens, please don't hurt her, Angie said you don't like bullies, her words not mine, but what you are doing is bullying, please, just leave her alone." Tony begged, waiting for a sign that his pleas were answered, seconds turned into minutes before Pepper called him to come inside, causing him to sigh in disappointment, he turned around and start walking home.
"I'm not that type of a person Tony, you may be my fated mate, but that doesn't mean anything, I just hope the two of us can be friends, that's all." Steve said gently which made the Omega sigh and nod his head letting go of the pup and lowered himself to be able to carry his pup to bed.
The Omega looked at the woman who was humming as they continued in their way, and Steven paused a little before he looked at his baby who was looking at everything with wide eyes and dropped jaw, making the Omega smile a little before he swallowed and walk toward the woman, squaring his shoulders, for the question that Steven was about to ask will decide the path Steven will choose.
"Of course you will not, you are too busy chasing ghosts from the past to see what is in front of you… you were so busy pinning after a dead Omega that you did not realize you accused an Omega (And a queen at that) of prostitution for his act of goodwill." Jamti glared, which did nothing but make Anton bite his lower lip to stop a growl from leaving his throat. "You are no fool Anton, but sometimes your head is as hard as a rock; nothing can go through it!" Jamti continued, not caring about how angry Anton was. "As soon as we get back you need to ask for forgiveness, I do not care about your Alpha's pride; the accusation you spoke of in the moment of anger is not forgivable, even more with the queen being a widow." Jamti's words gained nothing but a nod from Anton, making Jamti huff and turn his eyes forward; Anton suspected that the only reason Jamti stopped growling and hissing at Anton was that the Alpha ran out of words, not knowing what to say to Anton without repeating the same words he kept throwing at Anton since they departed.
"Yeah, Howard even said that we can use the serum you have in your body to create a cure for Peter." Tony grin when he heard the gasp coming from Steve; raising his head Tony's smile widens when he notices the hope and surprise on Steve's face. "Howard said it will be easy to create the cure for Peter because you are his mother, hopefully, the cure will be ready in two months or so." A sob left Steve, and a big smile made its way toward the Omega's face; it happened so fast, one minute Tony was holding to Steve and the next his mate was kissing him all over his face, causing Tony to give a joyful chuckle and hold tightly to his mate…
Tony counted from ten to zero, taking deep breathes to calm himself down; when that didn't work, Tony growled and looked down, grinning darkly when he saw one of Steve's doll sitting on the floor looking up at him. The doll was cute with its blond hair and blue button eyes. Tony though; he wasn't charmed, he accepted the doll as a substituted for Steve, and he starts stumping the doll with all the rage bottled up inside his body, ignoring how the poor thing squeaked and tried to run away.
"We only want what's good for you Tony; for you and Morgan, we just want to protect you." Pepper whispered, stretching her free hand toward Tony, which Tony took and gave a comforting squeeze. "The thought of you and Morgan getting hurt because of this… of this stupid ghost and the stupid town is too much, especially when we are miles away, with no way of reaching you as fast as we want." Tony gave Pepper a sad smile, holding her hand tightly giving it a last squeeze before letting go.
The only bright spots in his life were his mother, who always loved him for who he was, the dorky teen who loved robots. His aunt Peggy, even being Captain America it didn't stop the woman from considering Maria her best friend, the two of them with Ann, Jarvis' wife always gathered once a week, to try and embarrass Anthony as much as they can. And Jarvis, the kind doctor who was his father's old friend, the two of them weren't friends anymore, but the older man considered Anthony his own, he was the only father figure in Anthony's life, so Anthony always cherish their time together, it didn't hurt that his wife Ann, was aunt Peggy's friend, and there was Rhodey, his best friend, who enlisted in the army years ago.
vith your family, vith your mate und children." The man said once more, his words nearly hard to distinguish because of the heavy accent that seemed to get heavier as the man continued to speak; OK, now that was a little presuming of the man, does he go around supermarkets every day harassing Omegas with these kinds of words? Because for one these kinds of words are a little on the discriminating side, for another, this was a completely strange man who was ordering Steve around.
"Excuse me?" Steve asked as he turned to the older man, the fight leaving him a little when the Beta gave him a happy smile as his eyes soften when it fell on Steve's pregnant belly. OK, maybe the man wasn't talking to Steve, maybe the man was talking to someone else on the phone and Steve just happen to be here and hear the man's words, thinking that they were meant for him.
… left unsaid as Steve continued to pack his bags, putting the clothes he needs in his bag while continuing to go back and forth between his stuff and his baby's.
Margaret screamed as she looked at the Omega, his eyes wide and wild refusing to believe that the Omega sold himself to the Iron King to gain their freedom, was it not enough? The queen has been under Johann's thumb for over a decade, and now he treaded that prison for another? Another that not one of them knew about!
Steven felt his son's hitched breath as he hid his face in Steven's breast trying to stiffen his whimpers of fear. "It will be alright, love, you will see, Mama is going to protect you." Steven whispered to his son while keeping his trembling body close. "I am sure these fine men can be reasoned with. We will be alright." James choked out a sob, hiding his face further Steven's breast, the Omega took a deep breath looking at the warriors around him, wondering if he can plea with them to save his son, maybe he can give his son to Margaret who was kneeling beside him, he was sure he will be able to distract the Vikings long enough for the Beta to run with his child.
"Even better, he makes me sing all night long; a fate that you never seem to manage especially after being wasted from the first time." Tony sneered, taking twisted pleasure in the anger that shined in Ty's eyes, Tony felt empowered, knowing that he was able to insult Ty without the man doing a thing unless he wanted a scandal to follow him after leaving SI. "Now if you excuse me, my fiancé is waiting for me." The shock in Ty's face, made Tony bear his teeth in a feral grin before turning around, marching to where Steve was scowling and glaring at the women who didn't seem to get the meaning of the word 'No' no matter how Steve kept repeating it. "Darling, here you are, what took you long?" Tony cooed after reaching Steve, hugging Steve's left arm, causing Steve to blink his eyes before giving Tony a smile full of adoration.
Steven took a deep breath, and left the safety of his room and went to the common room to see all of the Avengers waiting for him wearing their tactical gears ready to go with him, that made him raise his eyebrow at that, getting a glare from Peggy who was still looking at him with concern, it made Steven smile, only Peggy know how to sass the shit out of you while doing it with worried face.
"No!" Tony growled, coming to stand in front of Steve and glaring at Gamora as if daring her to continue with her words. "How do we know that this is not a trap? After all, isn't this woman Thanos' daughter? Who says she isn't working for him and trying to lore Steve toward Thanos?" Tony snapped, glaring daggers at the guardians, standing in front of Steve and hiding him from their eyes.
If you thought that Tony used to avoid Steve in the past few months of pregnancy then you haven't seen anything; because as of now Steve was 89% sure that Tony moved out of their home and into his office or the penthouse above SI. It was hard, it was heartbreaking, it made Steve feel like he was lacking something, because why else would Tony refuse to return home and be with Steve? Why wouldn't Tony be home with his pregnant mate preparing everything for their child if he didn't feel like Steve was lacking something? Maybe Steve shouldn't have said anything, maybe he should have kept his mouth shut; maybe then Tony will at least be with him for a little bit, even when it meant that Steve would only be wanted for sex.
"A village that is three days' journey from here, after crossing the mountain in the north follow the river in the forest and you will reach it… though it was destroyed six years ago by the Hydra King." The Alpha said which got him a nod from the Omega, but nothing more, which made the dark-haired man concern and he turned his gaze to the Omega who has an emotionless face, now and then until they reached their destination. "This is what you seek my queen, the house is where your people are." The Alpha said just as a woman rushed out of the house running toward the queen with teary eyes.
What helped Tony in the hardest time to get over the nightmares and fear was surprisingly the lake. If Tony couldn't sleep or was having a hard time; Tony would just take the boat and some blankets and start rowing to the middle of the lake, where he will end up falling asleep in a record time. Tony wasn't really afraid of what will take a place when he leaves the world of the living to the land of dreams; not when he knows that when he wakes up, he will wake up in his living room, cocooned in his blankets, and warmed by both the blankets and the fire burning in the fireplace, even when he never sees his knight in shining armor who made it his priority to keep him safe.
It made Tony wonder if this is what it would have been like if his baby was alive if both of them would have spent their time building up things in Tony's lab after the two of them enjoyed a big breakfast filled with laughter and jokes and light conversation. Tony's heart gives a bang at that thought as he tried to ignore it as fast as it came.
"Ah, you are talking about Harley Keener. You know I can't really tell you that much about him, patient-doctor confidant, and all of that." Betty let out a sigh when she drank her hot tea, shivering pleasantly at the warm feeling spreading through her body, causing her to relax more.
Fury – Nicolaus Fiðr:
"You already met Grandma Sarah." Harley nodded when he heard Sarah's name, clutching Tony's hand tightly when they reached Howard who was gazing at the boy with furrowed brows. "Well, this is my Dad, your Grandpa, Dad, this is Harley." Tony smiled as he introduced the two of them, his smile widening when Howard kneeled and shook Harley's hand.
Chaos broke once again, but this time it was between the Avengers and the Scarlet Witch; Steve could only watch in mute horror when the person behind Wanda came to light, taking their hood off to reveal Nebula, one of Thanos children… Thanos was here… Thanos knew Steve was here, he knew Steve was here and was planning on kidnapping him and hurting his family.
"Yes, totally! We are going to introduce you to the wonder that's the shawarma; you are so going to thank me after taking one bite!" Tony grin playfully at the end of his speech causing a chuckle to leave Steve, the faint light twinkling, informing Tony that Steve was very happy, which made Tony relax, a slow smile stretching his lips as he gazes at Steve. Tony doesn't know why, but gazing at Steve at this moment made him tilt his head thoughtfully…
You will think that being cursed to marry an Addams will make the universe stop torturing you for at least a day, but guess what? When the universe hates you more than you hate yourself for being an idiot who married an Addams, it doesn't matter. That's why a week after the unfortunate day of him discovering that he is marring and Addams, and him having a year to do it or he will be cursed with death, pain, and torture (Serpentine's words not Rogers…) Tony found himself sitting in the living room, getting attacked publicly by Hammer from all people on national TV; Hammer who was showing false evidence about SI avoiding taxes and dealing under the table.
Today Thor decided to take them for a walk around Asgard's roads and shops, telling them about Asgard's history all the while, for Steven he just nodded his head now and then, already knowing the history behind every stone in Asgard and the new Asgard, heart heavy in his chest as he took the happy smile on Thor's face. The rest of the Avengers looked around Asgard with wide disbelieving eyes, taking everything in, the people, the shops, the houses, the roads, and horses and carriages, how Asgard live in harmony with science and magic working together to create an amazing modern world that still holds into the old ways of life without one life erasing the other.
No matter how much they torture him, he will always hit back when Stane comes near him thinking he can touch him. He was a virgin and he will stay a virgin until he chooses his own mate. No matter how much he was slapped and hit, no matter how much they thrust his face into the water's until his lungs screamed for air, no matter how much he was thrown around like a ragdoll, or how much they starve him in hope that he will be weak the next time...
It was an hour later that Peter and Tony finally left, and not from the lack of trying, but because Steve kept tugging both of their ears when they tried to sneak off, it was when Steve deemed them ready, after packing Peter's back bag, and giving him his cellphone, while making sure that his baby knew what to do, (And threat Tony with death if something happened to the boy) Steve finally let the two of them go, gazing at Tony's car until it was out of his sight before he entered the house, a thoughtful look taking over his face before he closes the door behind…
Before Tony hightails it into his house and ignores the get-together, he heard a throat being clear which made him jump and turn around only to see Bucky Barnes looking at him… just his luck. "Are you going to go inside?" Bucky asked as he opened the door which made Tony nod his head, his throat was as dry as the desert and he didn't want to embarrass himself by squeaking, though he was getting uncomfortable with the way Bucky Barnes was looking at him with narrow eyes.
The child whispered shakily, but he said these words while looking straight into the Iron King's eyes, making them widen a little before looking at the Omega.
Tears gathered in Tony's eyes, a lump stuck in his throat preventing him from pleading with his mother, hoping that she will pity him enough to at least give him a half an hour start before calling Howard. He swallowed as he saw his mother's eyes taking him in, not commenting on the bruises, the swelling around his left eye, or the cut on his brow that's still bleeding sluggishly, or his shaking hands and knuckles skinned and red-raw. And Tony's heart beat in his chest like a scared, caged bird with no way out, not being able to breathe a word, hoping against hope that he will be able to save his child. Please, God, please! Tony begged with himself as he saw his mother moving.
To Steve's surprise, Thanos stopped in his advance gazing at Tony up and down before his face darkened; Steve's breath nearly stopped at the furious gaze Thanos sends Tony. "So you are the one who dared to touch my bride," Thanos stated, his face getting darker with every word he spoke, and Steve couldn't help but expect the worse to come… Steve had to think of something, Steve had to find a way to save Tony. "It saddens me what I am about to do, Tony Stark, I thought you would have made a wonderful addition as one of my children, especially with us being cursed with knowledge… but you have touched my bride, unforgivable…" Thanos hissed as he took a step after step, the sound of clashing weapon, broken bones, and stabbed skin resume once more through the battlefield.
Since when did the man knew Steve's name? Steve was sure as hell he hadn't exchanged names with this strange Beta, he was sure he never met him before, so how? How does this man knew Steve's name? Fear and panic sized Steve as he gazed at the older Beta in front of him, wondering if he should run away or call Bucky before it became nasty. "I… I don't know what you are talking about…" Steve whispered, wondering if Bucky would rush to him fast if he screamed.
"Good morning sleepy heads!" Tony called out when he heard Rhodey and Pepper shuffled to the dining table and throw themselves at the chairs, yawning and grumbling as they tried to go back to sleep while sitting in their chairs, which did nothing but make Tony snort and put the breakfast plates on the table in front of the two of them before taking his seat. "Eat; the two of you have 16 hours' drive back to New York." Tony stated which made Rhodey groan as he straightens in his chair sending Tony an angry pout.
Since the second day of haunting (Tony still won't admit to his friends that a ghost tripped him into the closet; just thinking about it made Tony scrunch his nose in disbelieve) the only victims were Rhodey and Pepper, thankfully, Morgan was never hurt or anything; at first, it made Tony feel bad thinking like this, but as the days progressed, he was thankful that his daughter was as fine as she can be.
"Steve." Tony said as he stood up, flushing pleasantly as he saw that Steve was wearing fancy clothes like his, it made Tony's heart flutter in his chest because it looks like the two of them were going on a date, and not having dinner in Tony's house, but Tony shook that idea away, after all, Steve was his friend and it will be kind of like a betrayal thinking of the Alpha like that when the Alpha have Peter to take care of.
"You wanna hold her?" Tony asked, causing Howard to look like a deer in a headlight before Steve and Tony managed to calm him down enough to put the baby in his arms; leaving Howard stunned as he gazed at the baby with lost but happy eyes.
…" Steve's Ma's last words were said in a banshee-like shriek that nearly deafened Tony, leaving the inventor swaying as the woman disappeared.
Bucky's joyful voice made Steve snapped out of whatever dark thought he was spiraling to… blinking his eyes, Steve looked around the place hoping to catch Bucky, only to find that he was alone and that Bucky was nowhere near him.
He remembered gazing at the boy with shock, the small boy was no older than ten, and his heart starts pounding in his chest like it was about to claw out of his chest, the boy was not like Anton, but he was Anton, his aura said so, instead of the blue eyes Anton had, the boy's orbs were brown as was his hair, and his skin was tan, he should leave him, he knows that he should look the other way and never gaze at the boy again, ignoring him, but he couldn't this was Anton, his beloved.
"His name is Peter." Steve said which made Jarvis give a small smile, picking the blanket that slid from the pup in his constant movement and covered him with it.
"So you are finally awake, good…" The man in front of Steve sneered making Steve tense and glare at him daring the man to do something, but the man did nothing but pointed a gun at Steve, making the Omega's heart nearly stop, but the blond man gathered himself, listening to the Alpha's demands, something about convincing Tony to give the nuclear codes to Hydra which like hell Steve was going to let his Alpha do something as idiotic as that.
The dry tone made Tony huff and he turned to the workshop, grimacing as his eyes fell on the stuffed and flammable toys everywhere, the pink wallpapers that dominated the lab, holy water, and salt in every corner and incense that Tony instructed Dum-E to never let snuff out, all in the hope of banishing Rogers and his demons. And while he was grateful that it seemed to work, Tony didn't even know how long it was going to last before Rogers came into his lab and turned the toys into voodoo dolls, or the salt and holy water into blood and ashes with his creepiness. Tony practically had to change the salt in the corners over six times! It turned black every time Rogers came to knock on his door and plead with Tony to get out! Well, more like scratching at the door like a puppy. But what the hell, black salt! That only proved Tony's theory that Rogers was nothing but a demon!
The sound of screaming and laughing children coming from the backyard, made a soft smile paint Tony's lips, a chuckle leaving him as he caressed his belly before continuing to fill the bowls of chips, before Harley coming to swoop the bowls away, giving Tony a soft glare when the Omega tried to carry them; thanks to Steve, Tony was benched from even carrying a tissue paper least it strained him and hurt the baby, the sentiment seemed to be mirrored by Harley and Peter who became overprotective of him just like Steve.
OK… OK… so things got a little awkward after the kiss… awkward on Tony's end but still awkward. Part of Tony doesn't even know how to act around Steve anymore; I mean the man just kissed Tony out of nowhere! In a very creepy way, but still, it was the same. Tony was kissed without consent and he doesn't even know what to do! Should he scream at Steve? It never worked before and Tony doubted it will work now; should he hit Steve? Every time he thought of that the image of Steve's red face after Tony throw the holy water at him, flash in Tony's mind, making the genius more guilty than ever.
Steve blinked his eyes, his mind wandering to the small box under his bed, hiding under a loose floorboard, a box that contains all of the drawings Steve draw for the man in his two weeks stay at the hospital, drawings that were writing on the back of one of them
Tony starts going down the stairs, growling at every ominous crack he heard every time he took a step; halfway through, or what he thinks is a halfway to the bottom, the air around him became chilly, too cold in the heat of summer like they were in Winter, causing Tony to shiver and pull his suit tightly around him.
"What about me? That's not fair!" The boy whined as he shuffled, snuggling into the Omega's stomach more, glaring at his father, giving him a warning look, causing both Tony and Steve to let out a laugh. 'Brat' that's what the blond Alpha whispered, affection in every letter in the word; the Alpha grin as he ruffled the small boy's hair causing the boy to squeak, and try to slap the big hands away from his hair, which gained him nothing but happy laughter from both the adults surrounding him.
"I said get them out! Out, out, out of here!" Tony scream and shouted the doctors and nurses rush into the room, at that sight, Tony started screaming loudly, which ends up by having the doctors sedating him. He continued to scream and plead with Steve to get everyone out, it left Steve shocked and frozen, and he could fell the heartbreak rolling from everyone at that. What Steve hated the most was when Tony starts crying when Steve didn't do as he asked…
The days after that night was spent calmly and as happily as Tony and the kids can spend them. Mornings were spent home with Tony waking up the little devils for breakfast; that always ended up with groans and whines and pleas of '
Tony grinned widely as he walked through the alley, a skip in his steps and an ax in his hand, humming happily as he tried to find his prey for the night; an idiot by the name Zemo. A bastard who tried to fabricate a video of Steve killing his parents hoping to initiate a split in the Avengers; all in the name of sweet revenge so he can steal Steve away. What an idiot! Did the bastard really think that Tony was going to hurt the love of his life for something as nasty as his parents? For all Tony care, the two of them can fuck into limbo and Tony wouldn't pat an eyelash; Tony knew he wouldn't pat an eyelash, especially being the one who sends them to the other world with Hades not five years ago.
"I want, want, ugh, I want a noodles salad!" Peter said after a long while of pausing which made the Omega raise his eyebrow little lips twitching up at the pup's request, most kids would have asked for candy to be their lunch.
The next day, Peter shuddered as he opened his eyes, yawning a little before he hides his head under his pillow, looking tiredly at the door one last time before the boy to curl on himself and turn his back to the door putting the pillow over his head, sniffling as he remembered last night, and how the Alpha didn't show up after he promised him... just like... The sound of the door opening made Peter pout and try to stop his wobbling lips, knowing that it was his mother, but not wanting the Omega to worry about him, especially when Peter wanted to do nothing but curl into a tight ball and cry his eyes out.
"Are we talking about the same James who didn't show up to our engagement party and wedding, or show up to any gathering between our friends, or show up when you wanted to introduce me to your family or when we have a family dinner every month, or was he the one who to this day never called or texts or even sent a postcard, is it the same James or am I wrong?" Steve asked while raising his eyebrow, which made Tony sigh at that and leaned toward the Omega a little, making Steve tense when he saw the serious look on his husband's face.
Tony hummed under his breath as he prepared breakfast for his friends; the three of them had spent the last week of Rhodey and Pepper's stay preparing the baby's room and installing J.A.R.V.I.S. who turned out to be just like how Tony imagined him, smart, sassy, and too much like the person Tony considered his parent when he was young, even if it was an A.I. just two more days and the A.I. will reboot in as a security system in the house.
But what if Peter was really his baby? What will Tony do? As much as Tony fantasy about nothing changing between him and Steve, and that the two of them are going to stay together to raise Peter, he knows that deep down that was not true, that Steve won't forgive him for what he was going to do, that he will be angry, violated, that he will never trust Tony ever again… but he has to make sure…
Hearing his voice, the Alpha raised his head and a relieved expression took over his face, he waved to Steve shyly giving him a hesitant smile when the Omega stopped in front of him. "A-are you OK? You scared us when you fainted last night…" Bucky whispered, staring at Steve than at Tony who was standing behind him, and Steve ignored how Tony's eyes were still on him, clouded with worry and concern.
Taking a deep breath, Steven let out a tired sigh, grumbling as he looked around the place he was in to see that he walked deeper into the force in his hast of putting as much space between him and the Alpha before he did something he would regret. A few more deep breaths, Steven managed to calm his temper down enough to start tricking back toward the village, planning on spending the next fortnight with his people and ignoring the useless Alpha as he flounders around the place.
Her precious son seemed to have been in a heated argument with Bucky, an argument the brunette didn't survive unscathed by the look of it. The doll jump from his sitting position, waving his hands around and mimicking actions, jumping around the place and letting out angry little squeaks, all the while Serpentine hummed and nodded her head, trying to stiffen her laughter at the sad beep Bucky let out at the end of his explanation.
Steve didn't know what to say to that, he just give the child's hand a gentle caress and a small smile, it only made the kid give a wobbly smile in return, the sound of shouting and footsteps increased, making Steve tense and look at the door, only to relax a little as he saw the paramedics running toward him, he saw how few of them looked shocked, and other looked they were going to be sick anytime now, Steve hoped they are going to be fast about their job, before anything else was going to happen.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, darkness, horror elements, creepiness, a little bit of violence; Steve is so in love, and poor Tony! And we will meet surprising characters! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Everything starts getting worse after his son's eighth birthday, his son was always tired these days spending half of his time lying on the couch or sleeping in his bed, he stopped eating too, and Steve fearing for his son's health was forced to feed the pup, who whine every time Steve brought him food. When the bruises start to show, that was Steve's breaking point, he went to his baby's school and talked with the principal, he asked them if his son was getting bullied nearly shouting if May who was with him that time, didn't hold him back, the principal assured him that his son was not getting bullied, in fact, the boy spent all of his time sleeping in the classes, and that if the pup wasn't the first student in his classes, Steve would have been called earlier.
"Where is this 'Howard' you are talking about, Lady Natasha?" Thor asked which made Natasha frown a little thinking.
"Probably because uncle Bucky work with him, you know that he and uncle Bucky are a pack, right? And uncle Bucky is a family, so that's probably why." Steve said avoiding the question with a pounding heart, fear taking hold of his chest at the possibility of Peter knowing that Tony was his father; it will be a disaster…
/Warning/: this chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of fluff, Tony can't help but being a little shit, always, Steve is a grumpy little snowflake, and Peter is the cutest little fella out there! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Because it's the only thing that will power this A.I., even the Arc-Reactor isn't strong enough to make an armor as powerful as any of the Infinity Stones," Tony explained, he didn't know what he hoped for, maybe he hoped for Steve understanding and offering to help him, but what Tony didn't count on is Steve's face becoming as pale as a corpse when he continued to take in the codes in front of him.
By the way, I publish another story of my own, with the name 'Stardust', go check it out and tell me what you think!!
The Omega bites his lips to stop his wide smile from widening even more, but that was already a lost cause as the Omega was already grinning like a loon. It ended with Tony going to the bathroom to regroup, taking a nice long cold shower to calm his flush down a few pages before going outside and embarrassing himself in from of the Alpha. By the time he was finished with his shower, Steve and Peter were already finished with their morning routine, the Alpha taking it as his mission to wash his baby's face and brush his teeth and hair… caring for his baby like he was the Alpha's own always made Tony curl in pleasure and relief, the Alpha was already taking the first step to being Peter's
After Steve was done paying the barber, he took Bucky to a homey hole in the wall restaurant, where the two of them could relax, the two of them spent the dinner joking and exchanging stories; Steve was so happy that Bucky opened up to him, the Alpha was shy, shyer than any Alpha Steve saw in his life, it was endearing. Bucky was so different from his brother, while Tony thrives in the spotlights, Bucky prefer the calm and quiet, it really made Steve warm on the inside that he was able to take Bucky out and show him around Manhattan. Poor Alpha, spending nearly twelve years of his life in the military and only now he returned home, of course, he will be unbalanced and confused by everything, Steve still couldn't get over how he and Tony didn't notice that his brother was suffering all alone.
… Tony's mind whispered and Tony doesn't know if that word was for him or for Rogers. "Mama…" Tony blinked his eyes when Morgan whines and fisted his shirt in her tiny hand.
“Like what you see, honey bear?” Tony joked with a large grin, his words caused Rhodey to laugh and shake his head, Pepper was sniffing and trying to hold herself and not cry at the sight in front of her, Tony was feeling the same, the last time he has seen his friends was two years ago; after he graduates from college at the age of seventeen, his father and Stane had made sure to cut him completely from his friends, if only they knew that Tony wouldn’t have been stopped easily.
Steve gaze at Stane with hard eyes, the once billionaire Alpha who always made sure his look was always perfect… looked like shit, like a homeless man, even calling him that was a light word to descript the situation, it made a dark part of Steve smile in glee at the sight. Stane was thrust into the chair harshly making the older man groan in pain and throw a glare at the agents.
Tony was saved from answering by his mother calling his name, he ends up giving a halfhearted excuse to get rid of the child and the woman, he tried to ignore the pup's sad look when the Alpha rushed away, feeling like the lowest of the low when the woman lowered herself to wipe the boy's teary eyes and whisper something in his ears, Tony had realized the pup was smart when he told his aunt about what the gala is about, so Tony knew that the boy thinks that he did something wrong because the Alpha starts acting weird when he heard his name…
"You are welcome, little bambino…So Mr. Rogers, fancy seeing you here." Said Tony as he stood and turned his face to Mr. Rogers who was looking at the two of them with soft eyes that it made Tony a little flush, which was strange because the Alpha was scary just a few seconds ago.
Tony sighed as he looked outside of the window, keeping his eyes on Peter who was sitting on the carpet coloring and singing a childish song he learned in his class, that made a smile take over his face as he looked outside of the window with a sad look, grimacing when he saw a paparazzi who was idiot enough to climb over the fences and run to the house got chased by the mansion's guard dogs and Shield agents. God, will they ever leave him alone? Even after half a year, and the media world was still going on and on about the story of Captain America rescuing the Starks' heir from Stane, all of the topics they talk about were outlandish! From them saying that he get deformed from the torture he went through, to them saying that he secretly went with Stane to help he create weapons, to him going crazy and that he was actually in the loony bin, it made Tony want to throw up every time he heard them talk shit about him, especially that woman whose name was Christine Everhart who seemed to make it her life goal to dig into Tony's past destroying his image by doing that, going on and on how he was nothing but a playboy in his teenagers years, and that he probably gave Stane the idea that he was his… it always made his mood sour when he hears her voice.
It had been a few days since the heart to heart with the queen; a few days since Anton knew the reason for the hate between them and how justified it was. A few days since he knew about the oath breather that turned not only the queen's life upside down, but his as well; a few days of Anton nearly snarling at everyone and anyone who as much as looked in his direction, scaring them away and making them flee if they caught his shadow moving toward them. It had been a few days but to Anton, it felt like years and years; years that made Anton unbalanced, wondering what is he to do to gain the forgiveness he doesn't deserve but needed because it turned out that he was deceived by the person his village wanted him to wed.
Today the three of them were in his workshop; Tony was doing a few updates to the armor, planning on making it more durable and light than it already was. He was halfway in, before Peter came into the workshop, dragging Steve behind him and chatting his ear off, pointing to his section in the lab; his baby had taken liking Steve to the very next step, that sometimes Tony fear his son will adopt Steve as his father and disown him.
It seems that the news of Steve having a match with Petey-pie made everyone crazy, as every one of their family, even Goose showed up to see the match that was going to take a place, even Angie who usually sleeps until noon was awake in her nightgown sending Steve harsh glares threatening him with death if he hurt her baby, which made everyone blink at that and look at the woman who was narrowing her eyes at Steve who was ignoring her, but needless to say, everyone was taking Peter's side cheering for the pup who was going to go against Captain America, while sending glares to the Alpha ordering him silently to lose, even if it meant going at it dramatically like fainting when Peter put a finger on him.
"Why does it matter? Steve would appreciate it either way." Rhodey said after he finally gathered himself enough to stop the giggles that wanted to leave him; count on Tony to surprise him with his unexpected questions and actions. "Anyway, I came here to get you; Serpentine nearly killed everyone trying to get them seated so the ceremony would start soon," Rhodey stated, only to tilt his head when the music starts playing.
Stars… Steven's eyes widen as he sat up with a cry, looking at the dark sky with horror, nearly letting out a shriek when he looked around him, then he looked at himself, his breath coming out in short gasps as his mind trying to take everything in, trying to make a sense of this mess he found himself in.
"Is that why they moved away?" Rhodey asked causing Tony to nod his head, unwilling to tell Rhodey the truth of the horror that lay under the lake and the lies and half-truths that came from the town in walking distance. "You know, it will be a shame if this room was left to waste, what do you think?" Rhodey asked as he turned around, taking in the room, and giving a small smile when his eyes fell on the ceiling that had
The silence was the only thing that hung between Carter and Tony, mainly because Tony refused to talk with the woman, hiding in the closet as he waited for the action of the crazy woman outside. This Peggy Carter… the woman left the realm of unstable and entered the realm of crazy; she was crazy… crazy for denying that Steve has moved on and got married, crazy for believing that he would want to see her when she continued to act unstable and assertive, crazy for breaking into someone's home and trying to steal their child; how did the doctors treating her missed her psychopath side?
"Daddy, Morgan, say, Daddy!" Tony cooed the funny face he was making was causing his daughter to squeal and laugh and clap her hand. "Come on, say it! Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!" Tony jumped, tickling his baby mercilessly, causing the girl to squeal and kick her legs, trying to run away but couldn't because Tony raised her in the air. "Do you surround, princess? Are you gonna say Daddy now?" Tony asked, the smile stretching his face wide as his daughter giggled happily, snuggling into Tony when the man brought his daughter into a tight hug.
"Can you read this?" Steve asked Tony, which made the Omega blink and nod his head, Steve sigh and adjust the Omega's bed into a sitting position, he gave Tony the papers. Tony read and reread the papers with a shocked look on his face; he looked at Steve with a shocked look.
OK… that was getting creepy… "Can you understand me? And how do you know who am I?" Steve asked sitting on the chair that was facing the computer, too interested to stop now he can blame that amazing smell for this.
"Really?" Steve asked as he turned his attention toward Tony, a happy smile taking over his face as he gazed at Tony; Steve probably didn't know how stricken with wonder Tony was because Tony couldn't help but gaze at the star with wonder and wide eyes. The faint shining that surrounded Steve since the beginning of the night just grows stronger; it was still faint but this time Tony notice it without straining his eyes too much.
"I will, Papa, I promise!" Peter chirped happily, causing Tony to sniffle as he tried to stop the overflow of emotions taking over him at how grown up his baby was! Kids grow so fast! Tony still remembers how they found their son six years ago like it was yesterday, and today his baby was going to school!
"To be fair, I don't know." Tony finally admits with a sigh, a serious look taking over his face. "I mean I don't mind if I spent the heat alone, Dr. Banner informed me I can't take suppressant until my heat is regulated or it will disturb my system, I know that you will take great care of Peter so I'm not all that concern, especially when it's time for the little munchkin to have his own room." Tony smiled when Peter pout and moaned; probably still recalls how the discussion about picking up his own room went. "To be honest though, I was planning on asking Steve to spend my heat with me." Tony informed everyone shyly gaining understanding smiles from his family…
?" Steve asked which got him a sniffle from Tony and wide teary eyes being directed at him, which ended with the man twitching when he saw how broken-hearted Tony was… Tony wasn't that emotional even when Pepper married Happy, he wasn't a crying sniffling mess when she had her daughter Morgan! So why was Tony sniffling in front of his husband like he got his heart ripped out and stumped on? "There, there, sweetheart, we will see our baby soon, just a little more patient and we will have him in our arms." Steve coos as he pulled Tony in his arms, kissing his forehead and causing Tony to grumble.
Tony sighed as he reached the town, pausing for a second before pasting a smile on his face as he continued his way, cheerfully waving to the people stopping to chat with him about something. Seeing the happy faces that greeted him made Tony feel sad and heartbroken; finally, Tony had a place to call home… at least that's what Tony thought. Tony thought that he was finally free to raise his daughter in peace, that there wouldn't be any pain or fear; Tony thought that the only lie he had to live with was the lie about his name and from where he was, he thought he would be safe in a town that doesn't even exist on maps… the truth… the truth that Tony learned was a hard pill to swallow, especially when he loves the town and everyone in it.
The universe that Steven woke up in is different, as werewolves lived in that universe, as you read werewolves have this A/B/O Dynamics the reason that Edith put the dynamics she found in the category fiction, was because when she cross-references the information she found on the A/B/O Dynamics, the information she got was not the information that was similar to wolves, but with fictions from her universe, remember, Edith is an AI that can hack into any software she wants with Steven's orders, she also has an unlimited storage unit, even if she was created to resemble a small glasses… let's just say that's a sliver of what 30 years science from the future is like.
"Tony… what do you mean? How did you get this information?" Peggy smart and sharp, it was easy for her to snap out of her shock, and asked him; she was already in her Captain America posture, preparing to make a backup plan after a backup plan with the information Tony was going to share.
"And do you know your father, piccolo bambino?" Maria asked which made the pup eyes sparkle at that, which took her breath away how similar the small pup was to her bambino when he was the same age as Peter right now, the pup looked around the place until his eyes fell on a photo frame on the coffee table, he then rushed toward the table to take the frame and return to the older Omega showing her the picture. Maria had to hold into her sob when she saw it, looking at the picture with disbelieving eyes, because here he was, her Anthony from a decade ago, smiling happily with sparkling eyes with no care in the world as he held his Omega closely toward his chest, she looked at Steve, only to see the pain in his eyes as he stood up and left the room, which made Maria swallow at that a little.
Suddenly, the blade of a double-edged ax was pressed against Johann's throat, the cold sharpened metal that was causing a superficial cut on his neck is more than enough to shut his mouth. Steven smiled at that which made the redhead look at him with narrow eyes than she pressed the ax against the king's throat harder, her expression became steely when her eyes turned to the king and she hissed in Steven's mother language.
"He is not good for you!" Bucky cried out as he was pulled along Rogers who was trying to run after Tony, uncaring of the weight that was holding him back which consisted of every Avenger that wasn't Tony, as they held into Steve in hopes of the man forgetting about the inventor, but to say the truth they were impressed and more in love with how strong Steve was…
Tony returned a little after eight, humming to himself and singing under his breath, a big smile making itself known as he took careful steps going toward his home. He was already planning on spending a little time on the boat but he knows that he can't today,
"No cold… please…" The man slurred which made Steve shush him gently taking out a hot pack and putting it gently around the man's neck, which got him a relieved breath from the man as his muscle seems to relax.
"No Ma'am, it's just me, no family or a wife... I am a carrier, as for the kiddy I just confirmed the news with a pregnancy stick two days ago." Tony said trying to joke but failing at that miserably, especially when he saw the woman clench the car's wheel tightly after he said those words, which made Tony fidget and turn his gaze to the greenery outside. They followed the curve of the lake, the path leading down to the water's edge, and the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter's answer made Steve frown a little knowing that there was more to what his son said. "And?" Steve said gently which made the pup fidget once more and look at the table with a small flush on his face, causing Steve to take a deep breath at that and look at his baby who was trying to gather his thoughts.
One year… that's how long since Steve died protecting Tony and Asgard. One year had passed since Steve sacrificed himself, and taking Thanos and his armies down. One year… since Tony saw Steve turn to dust in front of his eyes, unable to save Steve as he tried desperately to gather the shiny stardust that Steve left behind… one year since Thor brought a shell-shocked Tony back to earth, explaining everything that happened to the Avengers, getting nothing but tears and denial for the words he spoke… one year… one year, since Tony lost the love of his life, standing uselessly in his place as his lover was taken away from him. A year since Tony couldn't look at one of his Iron Man suits without feeling like a failure; a year since Tony left the Avengers because every time Tony don his suit he could only see Steve's face as he turned to dust…
Biting his tongue, Steven forced a smile on his lips as he gazed at the pups, trying to stop himself from turning and slapping the king in the face; not only the stupid Alpha forced him into this kind of situation, but the man also tried to sway his pup away from his side by using this low trick. "You can go and see the bear, sweetheart, just make sure you behave… take Margaret with you," Steven said through gritted teeth, counting in his head to stop himself from doing something stupid like kicking the Alpha where the sun doesn't shine.
"I used what Erskine gave me years and years ago, the Super-Soldier Serum." Howard stated, causing everyone inside the room to freeze, their breath getting stuck in their throat, unable to make any sound; the only sound in the room was Steve's pained whine and sobs of agony, making everyone blink their eyes and snap from the trance they were in.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Coincidently' Natasha, Peggy, and Bucky were also inside the diner, getting their lunch break before returning back to work. With that Tony sealed the rest of the day by spending it with Bucky and Peggy, the two of them were extra friendly that day, if Tony didn't know any better he would have enjoyed his day with them to the fullest, but the truth that Tony now knew, made Tony stay on the edge, it was not only his life on the line but his Morgan's too.
Starkad huffed as he walked around the house, looking for the Omega with a frown on his face when he didn't find him. It has been a month since he allowed the Omega to go and see his little friends, what was supposed to be a one-time thing turned out to be an everyday affair as the Omega either went to check on his friends, or they come into his house to check on the Omega, and it was driving the Alpha a little mad because no matter how much he screamed at them to not come to his house they always show on the second day, and not only did the Omega took it as his chance to run loose and start slacking in his work, he didn't listen to him anymore.
The third one 'He Is An Addams!' with Steve being an Addams and the Winter Soldier in this fic, trying to court Tony, being desperately in love with our feisty brunette, while getting the cold shoulder from the said man, there is a side Steve Rogers/Everyone, but man is Steve only has his eyes on Tony?
"Do we have to? Why don't we stay in bed today?" Tony asked as he looked at the blond Alpha through his lashes, hoping to convince the Alpha to forget about work today and spent the time in bed with him, which gained him nothing but a chuckle from the Alpha and a kiss on the forehead as the Alpha detangled himself from Tony's arms and stood up, giving Tony a cheeky smile before going to the bathroom causing the Omega to huff but the happy smile never left his face…
but you have to." Margaret said his name in a whisper as if she was afraid that someone will listen to them, and Steven would not put it past the Hydra kind to do it, afraid that his prized possession will lead a revolution against him, which Steven hoped will happen sooner than later.
Returning home, whatever happy mood Steve was in has vanished when he remembered that Tony had abandoned him on the most important day of their life. That caused tears to threat and fall from his eyes once more, and for the fourth time that day, Steve cursed how the hormones were making his emotions go highway. Going inside the house Steve gave a few sniffs before wiping the tears off, pasting a smile on his face as he entered the house, wondering if Bucky or Tony were home.
When Tony and Peter returned, the Omega had to give a small smile when he saw the Alpha holding the sleepy pup, raising his eyebrow when he saw Peter's clothes covered in spider webs, which one look at Tony's proud face, told him that the boy finally mastered his web shooter, which made a smile take over Steve's face as he shook his head a little at that, waving for Tony to follow him.
Steven even if he didn't answer, he just walked to the desk and took the stick before giving it to Peggy, the Alpha only needed a few seconds for it to click in her head, and when it did she let out a shriek and nearly ran out of the workshop to finish what Steven started, but Steven put a hand on her shoulder and pointed to Tony, which made the Omega gulp, already feeling like death was approaching him…
He doesn't need someone to take his house away from him, he doesn't need someone in his land; it was his land, his right, the only thing that he has left, but everyone seemed to try and change that, everyone continued to sale his house and land over and over, ignoring that he was the one who owned it for more than fifty years. That doesn't matter though; he will give this boy only until he births his baby before letting it be known that he wasn't welcomed in his house.
"Mother! Loki! Where are you?" Thor called out as he took a step toward the door, only to shriek when the ground under him broke into pieces and start falling down… down a fiery pit where there were thousands of souls trying to pull at each other and climb up, the sight made Thor shook in his place as he let out a whimper when he saw that he was stuck on a small shaking rock that could fall any minute into the fire and scary souls and the strange hell he saw.
"I think you should give us the names of the major players in Hydra we can take them all out this way." Steve said for the hundred times maybe, but Steven only groan at that and push his slightly longer hair away from his face, his younger self was a second away from having a broken jaw.
I became rusty at writing after a month and a half of hiatus T^T
"What's on your mind?" Anthony hummed as he twirls Steve making the Omega laugh a little and look at the Alpha, which made the said Alpha smile happily and lean down to kiss Steve when the Omega was in his arms once again.
Tony gasp for his breaths sending a glare toward Steve who didn't even have a hair out of its place and was looking at him with a smile, which made the Omega glared at the Alpha hard. A month had passed since Tony's first therapy session, a month since he asked Steve to teach him how to fight, and he hated that he spent half of that time on his back! It was just impossible to one-up the Alpha, though Steve always praises him, saying that Tony was the first person who could go against him and not lose in the first five minutes, which Tony know that this was a bullshit cause he saw Steve and Natasha fight one day and his jaw nearly fell on the floor from how fast the two of them were fighting, if the Omega didn't know any better he would have thought that the two of them were dancing their own dance, and as much as Tony hated to admit it, it made him a little jealous seeing them like that.
"Thor can we please get this over with, I don't want to be in Odin's presence more than necessary." Steven said coolly which made Thor pause and look at Steven with surprise and a little bit of confusion. "You will know everything when we reach Asgard." Steven said which made Thor nod his head and clear his throat and call out for the guardian of the gate, Steven sighed at that, this was going to be a long day, though on the bright sight…
The bear let out a roar at the pain, causing everyone to cry when their horses neighed and bucked, sending several hunters to the ground, one of them being Tyber. "Fool, what have you done? You angered the Gods!" A hunter snarled, trying to jump away from the bear that decided they were its enemy and attacked, causing the hunters to prepare their weapons to attack before the bear killed someone. (6)
The sob that came from Barnes made everyone look at the man in disbelieve, and Tony had to shake his head because... Nope! Nope, and hell to the Nope! This wasn't happening! "You know, I was actually joking when I said that Hydra was nothing but a bunch of weaklings that breaded each other's hair in their downtime, but I didn't mean it literally! This is not even torture!" Tony finally snapped as he stood up and pointed at the video of Rogers whimpering when the female Hydra agent shook a stuffed toy in front of the man (A cute white bear to be specific). This was just… no…
So now, here Tony was, sitting in his private jet with cross arms, tapping the floor with his right foot as he waited for his husband to come back with the asshole who dared to destroy his beloved mansion. An ax was already in one of Tony's hands, waiting for his husband to come back with his prey so he could dissect him into small pieces and feed his meat to the sharks… Tony should have accepted Steve's proposal of taking the shark as their pet, maybe then, he could throw annoying people in the shark tank and enjoy their suffering.
"Oh, don't be shy, tell me what kind of inventions you made, little bambino." Tony cooed at the pup which made the pup look at him a little leaving his father's side to stand near Tony, and then the pup start talking about some of his ideas, which were actually impressive, especially for a pup this young, so Tony nodded at every idea the pup said, with a huge smile on his face as the pup start moving his hands in an animated way. "You are so smart! You know Steve I may steal the pup away so be careful." Tony said as he cooed to the pup which caused the small boy to giggle and smile.
They wanted to keep him sedated until they knew what was wrong with him, and how much of a mess his brain was. They all went about how severe his PTI was that he not only had amnesia and confusion but also created a whole different life separated from his… that's at least what Steve heard the passing nurses says when he acted like he was asleep half of the time, which did nothing but enrage Steve as he tried to move his body to push them away from him. Want it or not, no matter how much Steve willed his body, the useless and weak body he has right now refused to move, and when it does move, Steve is left breathless and tired like he ran a marathon. Steve was so frustrated with this, he hated feeling this useless, not being able to move and for his every move being decided on by the nurses who came daily to give him either his medicine, his glass of enriching milk to start his liquid diet, or sedative when Steve decided to act up.
They kiss each other over and over again, both humming into it. "Tony… Alpha… please…" Steve begged in between kisses, and Tony's body agrees with the urgency in his voice. He moved to pull away from Steve's sleeping pants, pulling all of the layers off without much finesse, and then Tony shrugged his own shirt and pants off.
' left his mouth and his face turned to a frown. "Maria! Tony is here!" Howard called out as he left the door opened for Tony before returning inside.
Clint and Natasha found him later, with the assassin lying limp in his hands… if he roughens the assassin beyond recognition, no one mentions it…
Steve hummed and closed his eyes, waving his hands over the crystal ball, waiting for an answer, any type of answer really, but he only wanted to talk to one person, and one person only, someone who will be able to give him the answer he wants, someone who knew what's like to love a normal human who doesn't have the Addams genes, someone… someone like his mother.
"I… I didn't m-mean it, Papa! The room was open, and… and…" The boy's voice left him as he heard another sob leaving the Omega, making the boy's lips wobbly at that, as he starts sniffling, begging his father to understand.
… and tug with all he had until he finally exposed his core and start to disintegrate it.
That was Tony's voice shrieking followed by howling of agony, it had been nine months since Tony's heat finished, six months since the discovered that Tony was expecting, something that they thought Tony will hate, but the Omega surprised them, being the most enthusiastic about the news of another baby, followed by Peter and Steve.
"Is Thanos…?" Thor couldn't finish the question that plagued his mind; a childish part of him hoped that if he denied the arrival of Thanos then it meant it will not happen, that it will be impossible, that it meant he will wake up soon from this nightmare. His mother's silence and the grave look on her face was the answer that Thor feared; in the end, Thor could only take a deep breath and straightened himself.
"What's going on here?" Bucky's cold voice caused both Tony and Steve to turn their heads to the place they heard the man's voice coming from; Bucky was only wearing his sleeping pajama bottom as he walked down the stairs, the gun in his hands lowered down when he saw only Steve and Tony in the living room. "What's all that screaming about? Did someone managed to get in?" Bucky asked the gun in his hands lowered down as he looked around the place probably trying to find the intruder he no doubt thinks is here.
The shock was so great that Tony couldn't answer, he couldn't believe that Steve was taking James's side; James, who caused everything to go wrong in their lives, ever since he stepped inside this house. Steve gave a broken sound when Tony didn't answer him; he bit his trembling lip before leading James to the kitchen, probably to put some ice on the swelling eye…
"Good… morning…" Peter mumbled, letting out a yawn as he rubbed his face in Tony's shirt (A shirt that was originally Steve's) letting out another yawn as he pulled away, scrunching his nose at how dark everything was; the action made Tony's lips twitch up, and he couldn't help but lean down to kiss Peter's forehead, letting out a soft chuckle at the whine that left his baby.
"You weren't in the DIY section," Maria stated walking to where Tony was sitting on the floor with Morgan in his lap surrounded by kids' books of all ages. "And you didn't respond when I called your name the last three times." Maria looked around frowning when she noticed that they were in the kids' section. "When did you arrive here?" She asked turning her sight to Tony who shushed Morgan when she babbled loudly.
It had been six years since Tony brought the baby home with him; the boy was a lovely addition to the Addams family with his monstrous side and similar line of thinking to Tony. He was the perfect boy Tony and Steve could ever want or need; a baby that gained the love of all the Addams Family and the Avengers, especially Serpentine (When Serpentine approve of someone, then the whole family welcomes them… mainly because she was terrifying even more than Grandma Addams) who threaten everyone with pain and death if they hurt her grandbaby.
Steve's words seemed to have frozen the man in his place; it was a few seconds later he returned to his dish playing with his food. "Yeah… military…" The man whispered absently, picking on his food while taking a bite now and then before turning to Steve who was looking at his plate uncomfortable. "My… my friends call be Bucky… if you want you can call me that…" The Alpha offered as an olive branch, gazing at the Omega whose smile widen at that until he was beaming happily.
It had been years, but still, Thor couldn't help but feel safety and happiness being home once more, even when it meant that being here was because the end of the world is near. Arriving at the palace, Thor couldn't help but let out a sigh, happiness enveloped him at the thought of him being home, finally being able to see his mother.
Margaret said which made Steven let out a relieved breath at that and held his son tightly when the young Alpha turns his head to see where Margaret's voice was coming from.
"My answer is yes…" Tony finally gathered the courage to say which made the Alpha tilt his head a little showing the Omega that he was a little confused at that. "You asked me if I wanted to consider this a date… and my answer is yes… so, Steve Rogers, will you go out with me on a date?" Tony asked nervously as he gazed at the Alpha waiting for his reaction… the gentle smile he was at the end of made Tony's heart flutter happily in his chest when he got the Alpha's answer…
"'Morning, Mr. Stark, Mr. Jarvis." The pup muttered as he rubbed his eyes with his fist, yawning as he looked around the place with sleepy eyes, Tony nearly squeal at the adorable sight, and he had to give it to Steve for not jumping when he heard the AI repeated the young pup's greeting, which caused the Omega to smile, make sure that his wallet, keys, and anything he needed was with him.
"And this is the libraries of Asgard you can find anything you want here, we also have all the history of the nine realms recorded and stored here, it's not as big as the royal library but it comes a close second to it." Thor said as he pointed to a huge looking building made from gold and marble, making the Avengers awe at what their eyes were seeing. For Steven he just hummed and nodded his head, following Thor when he entered the library, pointing at the sections and every book kind of book in that section.
"Yes, after you came home drunk and fought with your brother!" Steve finally snapped, which made Tony raise his eyebrow, looking at Steve like he sported five other heads. "How could you do this to me, Tony? Why did you break your promise?" Steve's voice cracked, tears start clouding his eyes, which caused the Alpha jump in surprise and rush to him.
"It's my fault, Mama…" Peter who was standing quietly this whole time finally spoke, causing Tony to turn toward the boy who was looking at the ground with trembling lips. "Harley was drinking some water and I pumped into him and then… and then the glass broke and I… I am sorry…" Peter said, tears finally sliding down his face, causing Tony to sigh and wonder what he was going to do… Peter was obviously lying about pumping into Harley, considering that he was far away from the boy, and Harley on the other hand no doubt was terrified of what Tony would do if he knew he accidentally broke the glass… if only Steve was here, he would have known how to salvage the situation.
"Steve… why do you think that you died?" Peggy said gently as she took a step toward the man which made him blink at her with confusion.
"Tony, are you OK?" Rhodey and Pepper rushed toward Tony, who was too shaky to his liking but was relaxing now that Ty was far away from him, from the corner of his eyes he saw Angie growl something under her breath before Pepper cut his vision of her, which wasn't that important, he will ask Angie about it later.
"Oh, you are so sweet!" The woman cooed as she pinched his cheek, making Tony hide his wince at the pain he was feeling, hoping that the woman won't bruise his face badly; he doesn't want any rumor that will come when people will see his bruised cheek. "But that's OK; I will just make myself comfortable in my Stevie's room! It will be just like old times once more." The woman gave him a dreamy smile, causing Tony to shiver because the look on the woman's eyes was pure hunger. "The last time the two of us were together, we caused the Great Depression with the help of the whole Addams family!" Steve's Ma let out a sigh, happy noises leaving her as she starts floating once more, ready to leave Tony alone, finally. "I will see you soon, Anthony! Treat my son right,
Tony waited for a little for Steve's response, frowning a little then throwing his phone away when fifteen minutes passed and there was no replay, which made Tony hum sadly as he lay on the bed looking at the ceiling. The sound of his phone's notification made Tony look and sit straight; snatching his phone once again to see what was written.
It was only a few moments later that Tony saw Bucky, the older man holding his tool kit ready to go through the crowd only to drop it in shock when he saw the state Tony was in. "Good lord, kid, what the fuck happened?" Bucky rushed to check him over, and it was then that Tony lost it and start sobbing uncontrollably, which caused the man to shush him gently, pulling him in his arms running his hand on Tony's back until the teen finally calmed down.
"It is true… and just like Anton, it seems that you cannot keep a secret, probably why they called you crazy in Athens, big futuristic thoughts and dreams but no filter." Steven grumbled, ignoring how wide everyone's eyes became, as for Tony he was skipping toward Steven with the most serious look on his face.
Even… even if Tony starts obeying Stane, letting the man use him for more food, so he can produce more milk for his starving baby, for little clothes to hide his baby with, letting the man use him just so he would stop hurting Tony, whose body was going weak and weak day after day, even if Tony feared that Stane will finally give him the blow that will kill him… he had to live for his baby, he had to…
"Anton, they are here…" Magna stated, disgust coloring her tone informing Anton of who she was talking about; those simple few words caused rage and hate to war inside Anton and the Alpha wondered if he could just say fuck it and kill Tyber for once and for all, ending all of his sufferings at once. A low and dangerous growl left him, causing Magna to sigh but stay with him in his workshop, probably waiting for him to gather himself. "I know you want to kill him for being an oath breaker, but right now, it is the queen's words against Tyber's, and you know how many people follow that weasel," Magna said, causing Anton to curse his people for how stupid they were sometimes.
Sorry for the short chapter, but well…
So what do you think?
"Just because you are dancing with Tony doesn't mean that you need a man to teach you how to dance; what if Tony wanted you to lead the dance? Peggy would be a much better choice at this!" Bucky stated causing Steve to tilt his head like a puppy as he seemed to think things through.
Steve still worries constantly, but one look at Tony, and Peter is usually enough to calm him. He knows Tony worries too but stayed strong and stable for them, and that gives Steve the strength to push his own fears away. He also knows that Tony will be an amazing parent to their little babe just like he was to Peter, and Steve knows that he himself will strive to be the best he can to match that.
Tony then went to help Steve putting their bags in the trunk, they didn't travel with heavy suitcases, but it seemed that they have bought all of Chicago with them when they returned to New York, which was sweet, Tony wondered if there was a present for him in there, it was only a matter of minutes before Steve and Tony were sitting in their seats, Steve was the one behind the wheel this time, something about Peter wanting to talk with Tony and him wanting to busy himself.
"You made a deal with him?!" Howard snarled as he took hold of the front of Steve's suit, making the blond Alpha hold himself back from killing his friend, his friend was on thin ice and any second now Steve was going to crack and snap. "How could you? After-" Howard wasn't able to say anything next as his words got stuck in his throat when he saw Steve's eyes.
So forward he marched, already planning on how to bring the meteor with him, wondering what he will find in it, or maybe it would just be a useless rock that he will bring with him just to spit on the universe and give it as a gift to his baby who was going on and on about that space show he was watching for like forever, wondering if bringing a meteor home for his son will give him the father of the year award.
"How can you do this?" Bucky snapped when he finally reached Steve, his body was shaking as if he was trying to stop himself from jumping Steve and holding him tightly in his arms. "We searched everywhere for you, we thought something bad had happened, it was only thanks to an elderly man we managed to find you! How did you even reach Central Park? You should be in the hospital recovering, not give us heart attacks you punk!" Bucky snapped, breathing harshly as he tried to calm himself, before starting to scream once more.
Six years of Tony raising the little tyke with Steve, every day was a lovely adventure for the three of them, bringing nothing but creepy laughs and happiness as they tortured their chosen victim to death. Six years of engraving themselves as the family that no one should ever mess with, no matter how desperate someone was or how his want for revenge increased. Six years of raising the perfect little monster to be their successor and their boy were off to school, enjoying the humanity outside and what it offers on his first day… Tony was so proud…
As much as Anthony hated lying to Steve about who he truly way, he didn't have the courage to tell him about being a Stark, he didn't want Steve to change because of that, he didn't want the love of his life to look at him and only see money and fame, never the person who was behind all of that. So he continued to be a Carbonell, and what a freeing thing that was, Anthony Carbonell was an inventor who loved the simple things, who wanted to work to make things better, who could act like he truly wanted without the press hunting him and the most important one, Anthony Carbonell has Steve Rogers' love, not that fake love and respect people shower Anthony Stark with to be on his father's good grace, not the Alpha who was forced by his father to create missiles and guns and hurt people.
"T-the one that Captain America fought in the seventies?" The pup asked with wide eyes, and he couldn't even believe his ears, was the Alpha telling the truth? Were Hydra really back once again after years of everyone thinking they were gone, or maybe the Alpha was talking about the mythical creature with the five heads, which then it will be even better! He will ask the Alpha for one of that thing scales or even a photo of it to show it to Harry and Gwen, which the two of them will be so jealous!
"Mr. Wilson…" Tony's voice trails off as he saw the Beta looking at him with guilty and sad eyes… No… Tony swallowed as he took a step after a step toward the Beta putting the gift bag on the desk; he then pulled the file toward him and starts reading through it.
"Oh, it's Ok Steve…" said Peggy as she straightens herself and smiled a little. "I tried to call you earlier but you didn't answer me…" She said making Steve sighs at that.
So what if Tony kissed Pepper Potts? What if he did more than that with her? Steve should have been grateful that Tony let him be in their home and didn't raise his hand on him. Steve should have been just like his mother, he should have listened to her advice and just kept his head down, letting his husband do what he wants if it meant that he would return home to Steve and his daughter. His mother done the same thing with his father, and the two of them stayed married until she died; even when it hurt both her and Steve, the two of them managed to get by until Steve went to college. Why should Steve be any different? Why did he decide to open his big mouth and argue with Tony about a stupid kiss if it would have ended up like this?

Dark chapter I know, but we are more than halfway through the story so cheers!
Gave him the whole tale of what took place on Midgard two years ago Steven realize that not only was he held on this plane of existing, but the stone that was connected to him was in fact what those Midgardian calls the Tesseract that was lost in space when they were able to close the portal, and not only that but it implies that Thanos finally determined to carry out his plans, seeking to gather every Infinity Stone out there and that alone made Steven concern, because Thanos alone was bad news, but Thanos with the Stones? That means the end of the universe. Did he also mention how Thor will remain with him on Midgard until the Bifrost Bridge repaired? Ignoring the fact that he was stranded on Midgard for the last two years? Just his luck. The powerful idiotic warrior was replaced by a scary whimpering cat at the thought of Steven having a rough time breathing.
It ended up with Harley and Tony being left alone, gazing at Peter and Steve as they disappeared before their very own eyes. Tony narrowed his eyes, feeling betrayed as his own fiancé sat him up like this, how did Steve not notice the uncomfortable look on Harley's face? God, this sucks, this totally sucks!
"W-wait!" Squeaked the metal thing in a robotic voice… and Steven knew it was metal because the hit that he received after slamming into it made him dizzy and end up falling down which made Steven curse at how stupid he acted not a few seconds ago, but Steven can blame it on the shock and confusion he was feeling.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, so much sadness, a little fluff, Steven being a gentle Mommy, while Bucky and Peter being cute and sad! All reviews are appreciated.
"Tony already has the best doctors, Steve," Maria said looking at the Beta up and down, she wondered when she had last seen him for he looked quite familiar.
Tony dozed fitfully, too agitated to fall into a deep sleep, too exhausted to try and make himself more comfortable, thinking that the reason was that Tony used to stay with Peggy and her husband, as their house always has some movement going on in it, and not this quietness that made Tony feel cold. When Tony slept, he dreamed. He dreamed of running along the roads lined with tall trees fear seizing his heart as he heard Stane and his father getting closer to him, he dreamed of bright-eyed shapes moving between the branches closing on him nearly trapping him when he tripped. He dreamed of still water, black in the moonlight, the surface mirror-flat, though there is movement in the depths, a flash of something pale among the reeds, and when Tony tried to focus on the shape, he let out a terrified scream when he saw a body of a small baby floating in the lake.
"He refused to see your birth, and then was hated by the others for not approving you to be the king." Bucky finally spoke, filling the blank page that Thor couldn't do, his words made everyone blink at that, a mix of shock and disbelieve about how someone can be hated for centuries because he refused to gaze at a woman who was screaming her head off as she pushed a child out of her body.
"What do you mean I have to come to the office, Fury? It's eight PM, on my day off!" Steve's voice filtered to the living room, causing the three to turn their heads to the hallway to see Steve talking with Fury on the phone, the Alpha's annoyed and agitated voice, made Tony concern about his husband, especially, when the Alpha was left in that state since Peggy Carter left their house earlier that morning. "Of course I am going to take the next four days off, we agreed on that Fury!" Steve's raising voice caused Tony to sigh, knowing that his mate was far too agitate and angry by the tone he was using on Fury.

Those who were alive when Hydra was going to take over the world knew what kind of rotten terrorists they were, and those who were born after Hydra takedown didn't know anything other than the stories they were told. "You are hiding more information aren't you Steven?" Peggy asked which made the older man look at Peggy with a small smile; he could never keep anything away from her.
"Why do you think it was me? Maybe he was in fucking cult or something?!" Tony huffed, taking Ty's state with a dark look filled with pleasure, the dark and satisfied look on his face made everyone shift… they never saw Tony sport such a dark look on his face before, usually, that was Steve's job, not Tony. "Besides, I was with Steve all night long yesterday… all night long…" Tony stated before standing up, heading to his lab as he laughed darkly every time Ty let out a shriek; Tony's dark laugh caused everyone to flinch and even Bucky double-take at the sound that left Tony… he looks like a satisfied villain whose plan finally worked.
"Oh, my Addams! When is the wedding?" Serpentine asked, her eyes going distant as stars start sparkling around the ghost as she starts muttering about the guests' list and baby Addams and creepy ever after. Several things happened when Serpentine's words decided to make sense in Tony's mind, the first was Tony freezing like a rabbit who was caught by a hungry pack of wolves, the second was Bucky giving a war cry and ran to attack him but was tripped by Pepper who fainted at the killer blow of seeing a ghost and hearing about Tony's marriage, and thirdly Natasha who could only blink her eyes and swayed, sliding down to sit on Bucky's back, the shock was too much to keep her standing.
"Tony!" Clint's shout made Tony roll his eyes, as he left his room and head toward the stairs, he descended the stairs looking at Clint with mock annoyance, only to see the fellow Omega grin at. "So what did I hear about you babysitting the hot Steve's pup?" Clint leered at Tony when the Omega stood near him, his words causing Tony to flush wondering how in the bloody hell the other Omega knew about that. "What are you waiting for Tones! Spill the beans, the whole neighborhood had been talking!" Hearing that only made Tony groan in annoyance and grumble something nasty under his breath which caused Clint to laugh. "Oh, hello Peter!" Clint said happily when he saw the pup getting out of the kitchen. As soon as the pup saw Clint he froze in his place, and Tony's heart nearly stopped when he smelled the scent of fear rolling out of the pup in waves which caused Tony to look at Clint only to see the confusion on the Omega's face then the realization crossing Clint's face. "Shit, I forgot he fears Omegas…" Clint cursed under his breath and looked at the child that was whining and backing away slowly from Clint.
They stayed for a month in the hospital, Steve getting more worried by the hours when his baby was struggling the first week, but after that, the little fighter managed to surprise everyone by pulling through, it made Steve proud when his little baby fought to keep his place in this world, it gave Steve strength to continue for another day…
"I did all of that, Mr. Wilson, and the files you have in your hands are the only things they were able to uncover," Tony said looking desperately by the second, from the corner of his eye he notices a photo on the desk. "I came to you because I was told that you were the best, that you could do the impossible…" Tony looked at Sam who was looking at the files on the desk. "Don't you have pups, Mr. Wilson?" Tony asked which got the Beta's attention.
Peggy on the other hand just sneered and pulled away from Tony, straightening her dress and gazing at Clint with distaste. "Mr. Coulson, I see that you are as hotheaded as ever; glad to see that not everything changed around here," Peggy stated with narrowed eyes, causing Clint to growl and cocks the safety of the gun, which made Tony's stress level rise uncontrollably; there were children around for God's sake! What if something happened and the gun fired on its own?
"Why… why are you here?" Tony finally dared to ask, he doesn't know why, but he feels so afraid looking at the short woman standing in front of him; hell, Tony didn't fear Wednesday or Steve when he first saw them, but this woman, this woman… she made Tony feel like he was an ant about to be crushed. Now Tony knew from where Steve got his creepiness and scariness from; that woman was clearly Satan in disguise, and Steve was the devil spawn for sure.
Tony gave a wobbling smile, rushing to Steve to hold the Alpha, taking comfort from him; it has been a month since the Omega saw the man, a month since he nearly destroyed everything because he refused to talk and explain to Steve, forcing the Alpha into something that hurt them, but when the Alpha held him tightly and kissed his forehead, the Omega let out a relieved sigh, the hope of fixing what happened increased that now Steve knew what really took a place that day.
"Yes, you were an inventor, nearly in all of the lifetimes I saw you in." That caused Tony's eyes to widen and for an insane glint to shine in his eyes, and when he turned to Steven to order him to explain, the star was already making his way out of the room, with Peter in his arms, the little one was chatting Steven's ears off, but the star didn't seem to mind that at all.
"You are sure it wasn't because I was
"You are making a mistake, Steven…" Carter stated in a too calm voice, that caused Tony to swallow several times as he tried to calm his breath, trying to stop the terror taking hold of his heart that his husband was finally back home.
"Are you sure this was the only note you found? What about the note I left for you?" Tony asked, causing Steve to furrow his eyebrow and shake his head; Steve didn't find any note near the nightstand when he woke up this morning. "Are you sure?" Tony stressed, causing Steve to tense and gaze at his husband with a frown.
It took a few seconds before everyone finally saw him, and when they did everyone become quiet as they took him in various degrees of surprise and not so surprisingly pleasant expression (Natasha and Bucky) "Tony… what happened?" Bruce asked, adjusting his glass and blinked hard as if the image in front of him will be banished if he did that and the real Tony will show up.
That answer made Bucky whistle loudly then he starts laughing harder and harder by the second. "You were right Stark, he is your big boss." Bucky sniggered at Tony, that made the brunet Alpha hiss at him like an angry cat, causing everyone to look at the pair with amusement, though Tony couldn't help the hope and happiness that bloomed in his chest at the thought that Steve cared about him… maybe they can start over again…
Someone in the crowd whisper causing a hushed silence to take over the village as they turned to gaze at Steven, their eyes were wide as disbelief shine deep within them, causing the Omega to straighten and glare at anyone daring them to look at him. "Nattalegg, what is going on?" Nicolaus asked when they came near the red-haired Alpha, '
"Here!" Peter pointed at a direction after opening the window, causing Steven to lean down a little to see where the boy was resting his sight, ignoring Tony who stopped behind them. "The second star under the big one to the right…" Peter pointed, suddenly starts explaining a few things about the star. "It's not bright like the other ones, but it's still pretty, Daddy said he followed it when he was in Afghanistan and it saved him, that's why it turned into our lucky star, I don't know why it disappeared; it's a thousand years old not billions, me and my Daddy always go to the garden at night on weekends to gaze at it…" Steven couldn't help but block every word Peter said when he was finally able to locate the place Peter was pointing at, a few digs in his memories informed Steven that the place he was staring at was not a mind trick his mind was playing on him.
By the time Steve stopped shining, by the time his core lost all of his magic, by the time Steve felt like he was about to collapse any second… Thanos was finally dead, and what's left of his armies was destroyed, leaving only Steve and the Asgardian standing in the battlefield, cheering for their victory. Steve's lips wobbled for a second and his eyes were full of tears, but Steve swallowed as he turned to Tony… his beautiful lover was standing up, leaning heavily on Thor as he gazed at Steve with happiness and relief shining in his tired brown eyes.
It was only a few seconds before Peter was pulled away from him, which caused the scream to be trapped in Steve's throat. The star wanted to scream and rage and let loose, but his body, his damn stupid body! "Let me go!" Peter screamed, fear and pain in his voice, and Steve, Steve raged!
"Please, stop…" Steve whispered, trying to ignore the heartbroken look that crossed over Bucky's face, taking a step back when the Alpha raised his hand to touch Steve's cheek. "Please don't make this harder than it is…" Steve whispered, turning his back to Bucky as he returns to back his clothes, trying to ignore the way Bucky let out a shuddered breath before he left the room, slamming the door shut behind him.
"He is perfect, isn't he? What do you think, Mr. Rogers, are you ready for parenthood?" Tony asked, his questions getting choked cries and shriek from the Avengers and a happy laugh from Steve who pulled him in a hug, nuzzling his cheek and kissing him on the lips…
"What does Steve want?" Tony said tiredly as he pulled his legs to his chest hugging them tightly waiting for what Bucky was about to tell him, he already know that Steve was probably hating him, so he, of course, will want to stay away from Tony as far away as he can, Tony tried not to let a whine at that, at the possibility of not seeing his mate or his child ever again, it made fresh tears run down his face, and he hated himself for crying in front of Barnes, but he simply didn't have it in him to care anymore.
"I don't need my sister following me to go anywhere, I am a grown-up woman," Carter stated, turning her face toward Steve, a harsh look stilling over her face as she send an icy glare to Tony. "I want to meet our son if you don't mind," Carter stated after a while, ignoring the way that Steve continued to glare at her as if ordering her to leave; Tony for his part, wanted to escape this stressful situation, but he doesn't want to leave Steve alone to deal with Carter who was mentally unstable at the best of times, so he sucked it up and waited for what his husband was going to do.
Sorry for the short chapter, but life refuses to give me a breath.
"How dare you speak with your betters like that?" Doom exclaimed with anger, glaring at Steven harder when the man rolled his eyes and did a backflip to avoid the arrows Clint start shooting at the bots, Peggy was trying to evacuate the civilians with Bruce, but there were some stubborn idiots who wanted to stay so they could get exclusive stories.
Ever since he was a kid he always loved gazing at the stars, he always gazed at the stars in wonder and amazement, his eyes trying to follow the ghost of an unknowing light he always dreams of and was never able to forget. It was after escaping from the caves in Afghanistan that he finally found the light he was searching for; it all started when the armor was destroyed when he was forced to land the first armor he created, he remembered walking and walking until it turned into night, he remembered shivering in coldness and fear, not knowing where to go and which way it was for salivation, he remembered gazing at the stars as he shivered in coldness and fear.
The AI's voice made Tony's face snapped to the ceiling. "The person who was here a few minutes ago…" Tony said which made the AI pause and play the security fid for Tony.
"You are here! Why did you come here without telling me? I am going to tell Papa, so mean!" That was Peter who skipped into the room, running toward the giraffe and hugging it tightly, ignoring Harley as the teen trying to pull the boy away from the tony least he broke the toy or something.
"Steve…?" Peggy asked a shocked Steve, who was still trying to make ahead or tail of what he heard right now.
Peggy, it was nice to see her again, to talk with her and hear her, and just be near her in general, indeed, he doesn't love her anymore, their ship had long since sale, but that doesn't mean she didn't have a special place in his heart, after all, she was his 'Best Girl' the woman he went to when he needed someone to guide him.
