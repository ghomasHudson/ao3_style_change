He said another goodbye ‒ careful this time to keep his hair out of reach from his daughter ‒ then set out for the village.
Castiel stood where he was, at loss as to what to do or what had happened. He listened to his mother and father shout. He listened to Gabriel try to ease the argument then give up and take the girls to his grandmother's bedroom.
unsanitary. He had just given Dean a bath and brushed his teeth. His pet's mouth would be as clean as it would ever be. And it wasn't as if his pet would think it was degrading, he was only a pet.
"I hope so," Castiel said. He hooked the rope handle of the bucket onto the shoulder yolk. "They deserve to be happy."
the father?"
He whimpered when his master started moving forward.
His grandmother pulled him into a hug while he sobbed. She rubbed his back until he calmed down. When he stopped sniffling against her shoulder she eased him back into his seat.
He breathed deep. "That's great."
For one brief moment the empty feeling disappeared. His gut twisted up in anger. Wasn't yesterday payment
"I'm a witch and I curse this whole village!" Castiel shouted. He swept a glare over the crowd until his eyes landed on John Winchester. "And I curse
His master scooped him up from the table and carried him to the bedroom. His master put him down on the bed and spread his blanket over Dean.
"Granddaughter..." The other human paused. His eyebrows furrowed. "Grand
Castiel watched the still burning bundle on the alter. He looked skyward. He suspected he'd been favoured by Strife. He'd spent nine months finding out all the ways his parents had lied to him, the father of his child had run away instead of mate him, his face was burned with a brand, his muscles head to toe felt pulverized, his stomach sagged under the loose binding his grandmother had helped him into this morning, and his crotch was sticky with blood. Strife had most definitely smiled upon him the day his grandmother had asked for divine favour.
Anything. He needed Dean.
They reached the Goodson house when the sun was high overhead. Castiel didn't hear any screaming from inside. He couldn't find it in himself to do anything but hope they weren't too late. He couldn't spite an innocent child either.
Dean reached for the bowl. His master pulled his hand away. Dean scowled at him. His master tapped his head with a claw. Dean rolled his eyes. He had learned that the tap to the head usually meant
His master stopped and stared at a blue circle on the wall. His dagger tail flicked— not in an angry way but Dean still stepped away to avoid it. His master tapped the circle.
Every turn he took came to a dead end. All the corridors were closed off except the ones that led between the kitchen and the bathroom.
Very slowly he tugged his mating tail out of the warming sheath. Dean watched with narrowed eyes as he moved his mating tail closer to Dean's mouth.
A deep sense of relief settled in Castiel's bones. He touched the coins in his pocket. He'd have to buy something to sacrifice. Whatever god it was that favoured him would want their payment.
The store employee took a few more minutes to finish his bill and pack all his things into a shipping drone. Castiel watched the overladen drone take off with a sense of defeat. He had bought a pet.
The Silver Head was what passed for an inn in the village. It was really Cepheus Redwood's house. He rented out a room or two and provided meals at night. Most of the people in the village were skeptical of it. It wasn't so much that they thought the Silver Head would encourage people towards dubious vices but rather that Cepheus Redwood let strangers stay in the village.
The priest shot him a smug smirk.
"He didn't stick
Castiel laughed. He thrust his hips up in response. "Me too. Try not to get yourself into more trouble between here and home. I don't want to wait
"I gotta run," Dean said and did just that. He took off down the mountainside, stumbling in the dark and cursing his poor family for not being able to afford shoes.
any better. He was just an innocent pet.
A gush of slick flooded out of him. He groaned again. He knew the wooden cock wouldn't really help. He'd get a few moments of relief and then be right back to where he was. It wasn't worth having to face down his family after knowing they had all heard him screaming from a fake cock.
He might have some social issues from doing long deep space runs alone but he wasn't that far gone that he didn't recognize what people would think if he admitted to what he had been doing. As understanding as his therapist was he doubted he'd be sympathetic to zoophilia.
Castiel trembled and closed his eyes. He had Daven's cock hard in moments.
"She asked?" Castiel was surprised. His grandmother hated taking charity more than he did.
He bent down to give Deidre a kiss on the top of her head. "Take care of grandma."
Dean chose then to wake up. He yawned and let go of Castiel's leg and blinked in slow surprise when he saw Castiel's mating tail wrapped around his midsection.
on his list. He had read that humans were more relaxed and better behaved if they got at least
His master led him on a winding path through the ship. Dean still hadn't managed to map it all out in his head. He knew how to get to the bathroom, the storage bays, and his master's bedroom. That was it.
Gabriel kicked the side of the cart. "Three people wouldn't sell us rice today and the baker charged us double." He glared at Castiel's grandmother. "Is vengeance and pride going to feed us?"
"He was my friend." Castiel sobbed. "He was my friend and I think I loved him and he ran away as soon as he found out what we had done." He wrapped his arms around his grandmother and cried into her shoulder. "He left me here and now I'm a whore."
looking at space," Dean muttered. "Everything in it wants to kill you."
"Castiel?"
It wasn't until he was spitting a shirt out of his mouth as his master tried to pull it over his head that he realized he was finally getting some clothes. He managed to wrestle himself away long enough to put his arms through the sleeves on his own. His master seemed content to let him put the pants on by himself after that.
Gabriel spun around and pushed Castiel back down the alley. "They've got Sam Winchester."
Castiel looked over his shoulder to see Sam standing at the mouth of the alley. Sam made a lewd gesture and leered at him. The men laughed again. Sam winked and strolled away with a skip in his step.
As far as Castiel knew, an alpha hadn't come to the village in three generations.
eggs was unsettling. He knew the vast majority of species that ate animal based diets were usually ovivorous to some degree but still they were
Dean's cock slid over his asshole. Castiel threw his head back and moaned. He had never felt anything like that before. Dean grinned and did it again. Castiel's back arched. Something twinged deep inside him. He moaned again. He rocked his hips as Dean's cock slid over his asshole and nudged at his balls.
And Dean had been particularly good at following commands today.
The bed bounced with the weight of something being dropped beside him. Dean squirmed around to look. His master had dropped a box of balls beside him. Dean looked up, surprised. His master had never given him any kind of throwing toy before— Dean figured it was probably because projectiles and ships didn't go so well together.
The priest sucked in a breath. "This
Maybe this was one of the few sensible humans and he wouldn't have to train it to not get into trouble.
His master picked him up and tucked him in close to his bony chest. He hissed a few times then went silent.
He turned his head away. His master hissed and clicked at him. Dean didn't look back. The hissing and clicking stopped.
They laughed harder.
"We'll be up the mountainside. In the field with the lightning struck tree," his grandmother said.
He used twice as many sanitizing wipes than what he probably needed to but he couldn't stop worrying about infections. He bathed Dean regularly but
"I hope were gonna eat this time," Dean grumbled. His master snorted and pet him. Dean leaned against his leg. "Yeah. See? I'm really happy about being wiped down like a baby. Now let's eat."
As if he was stupid enough to bite the hand ‒
"Daven is..." Evan panted above him. "...missing...out.
Castiel tried not to squirm. It felt strange to have Evan's fingers flex inside him. Evan slowly withdrew them then pushed them back in. He pressed his fingers up and dragged them across that odd little bump inside that Castiel had discovered not so long ago.
Castiel was at war with himself. Dean didn't seem to understand what his mating tail was. He just seemed to be interested in the new thing his master had decided to do. It wasn't upsetting Dean to have his master's mating tail wrapped around him. But Dean didn't
His grandmother reached for the chain. She took it and looked it over. She passed it to Gabriel. Gabriel held it up and narrowed his eyes at it. He scratched at it with a finger nail. He turned away and did something at the counter. He hummed to himself. He nodded and turned back around.
The priest turned to Castiel. "Confess your sin! You seduced an innocent mated beta! You bewitched him! You slander his family name!"
But there were no angry growly noises from his master. Instead his master looked down at his blue-stained arms, clacked his claws together, then reached into the box with his other tail and picked up a ball. He offered it to Dean.
his body do something he hadn't even known it could do until last year?
"Stop!" His grandmother shoved her hands down against him and pushed
"She's old and tired." Gabriel interjected before Castiel's grandmother could say anything. "She didn't mean it. She'll say she'll curse anything if she can't have a lie down in the afternoon."
A soft hiss woke him up hours later. Dean jerked upright. The blanket tangled around his limbs. He kicked and thrashed against it and ended up on the floor.
They both froze.
A timer went off, interrupting his work. It was time to feed Dean. Castiel looked over at Dean sitting off to the side. He'd finished the puzzle toy and tossed it aside and was now staring dejectedly at Castiel.
voice. Not another weird alien. Human.
at him but they also pleaded
His grandmother poked his side. "Get your cloak on. Anna will take care of DeeDee while we're busy."
"Can't get enough Winchester cock?"
His grandmother nodded. She snapped the chain into two pieces and handed the smaller half back to Michael Goodson.
"You little thief!" His grandmother growled. She had Adam Winchester by the back of his torn coat. "Give it up!"
He woke to a strange sensation in the small puffy breasts he'd grown in nine months. He looked down to see his baby with their lips firmly attached to his nipple and sucking hard. He bent down to kiss the soft head. He laid his head back down. He was exhausted and sore. He felt like he'd been crushed by a horse and made to walk up the mountainside.
"That's the most decent way I think I've ever heard it put about what my cousin gets up to in public," Castiel laughed. The village elders complained to no end that the youngest generation was morally corrupt, and frequently Gabriel in particular. But Castiel's grandmother had taken him aside and told him every sordid detail about the village elders' youths. All young people, his grandmother informed him, were a moral disappointment to their elders. Gabriel was no different.
Dean chattered on as Castiel worked. It had taken a while for him to get used to how much noise Dean made but now that he was used to it, it was rather pleasant.
Dean leaned against his leg and looked up at him.
Castiel laid where he was and watched Dean scramble to get dressed. It was sunset. Dean was supposed to be home helping with the evening chores. Castiel stretched languidly. He'd be in trouble too but it wouldn't be any less if he rushed home.
Castiel stripped off his work clothes and cleaned up then crawled into bed. Dean was quick to wrap around his leg and murmur against his skin.
He felt the opening of his mating tail unfurl.
along this twelve feet of corridor. He just couldn't see the damn thing. Either his newest master could see beyond or below his own range of vision or else he was hooked up to the ship. But he knew there was
From the back."
Castiel listened to his mother and father argue in the kitchen.
It did not surprise Castiel at all that he was soon following her through the store with an ever increasing pile of things for the care of humans.
"Ow!" Castiel flinched. Deidre never latched on so hard. He pulled the baby back from his breast and shuffled her around. He tried again. It still hurt but not as much.
His master scooped him up from the table and set him down on his feet on the floor. Dean had a sneaking suspicion his master had only carried him to the bathroom because he knew he hated it and didn't want him trying to get away.
"Don't know how people actually
The human made a series of faces at him before hesitantly edging closer. Castiel tapped the floor in front of him again. The human crept closer then sat down on the floor in front of Castiel.
Gabriel darted back around the cart, Castiel close behind him.
Castiel let out an explosive groan. He just wanted this day to be over.
"It's not the same," Castiel muttered before biting into the toast. If it was the same he wouldn't have a brand on his cheek.
Maybe the giant lizard wasn't so bad after all.
Hadn't he paid three times over? He had a child and a brand instead of a child and a mate.
Mashed carrot splattered up Castiel. He sighed and wiped carrot from his face while Anna and Hannah laughed.
It was harmless but stupid.
His master hissed and leaned into his chair.
Castiel was sure he would have accepted the mating bite only if it wasn't for his grandmother. She had shoved Gabriel out the door with a pack full of his clothes and told him that Blackdogs didn't get along with
was supposed to mean.
His family came back in the early evening to find him sprawled on the cool stone in front of the fireplace. A wet patch of slick had spread across his pants but he couldn't bring himself to care anymore. Slick leaked out of him faster than he could clean it up. Being an omega in heat was disgusting. No wonder the village shunned him.
He remembered reading a book or two that featured dragons when he had still been just a kid on earth. He had thought dragons sounded cool back then and that it would be
"Please let it be a station," Dean begged. A station wasn't as good as a planet with real ground and a real sky and real atmosphere but it was a hell of a lot better than a ship.
Castiel didn't remember screaming like that. He glanced up at Michael Goodson, worried for Michael's wife and child despite his own anger.
"Should I come back?" Castiel asked, keeping his eyes on the rag as he cleaned himself.
Dean tugged his shirt over his head. He bent down and kissed Castiel on the lips. The tension drained out of him. He smiled. "You're gonna get me in so much trouble tonight."
"I'm gonna be stuck in my room for the rest of the week," Dean complained. He dropped down on top of Castiel and rocked his hips against him. "Probably gonna be thinking about this the whole time."
His grandmother prodded him out of his shock and set him to work. By midafternoon they had delivered a baby and the after birth. Castiel was exhausted and felt disgusting. He hadn't realized how much blood and shit was involved in labour; his grandmother and Gabriel had cleaned away everything before he'd noticed.
The mob came closer. Castiel shivered. He heard shouts of
"Who's scary?" She asked.
Castiel did as told. A moment later the baker's weight was settling on top of him. His fists clenched in fear. Daven ground his cock along the cleft of Castiel's ass.
The priest looked down at Hannah scornfully. "Are you sure your grandmother didn't sell them to him and forget? She's quite old."
and put him on the floor if he persisted. He
Castiel wouldn't have believed anyone else but those sounded awfully like his grandmother's words.
"They want you to hide. They want you to be ashamed of who you are and what's happened. Don't let them have that." She tilted his head up and looked him in the eye. Castiel felt like he was falling into two endless expanses of sky. He could believe his grandmother was a witch by her eyes alone. She put on a steeled look, "Hold your head high and look them in the eye so they remember who you are and what they did to you. This is their shame, not yours."
He pressed his face harder into his master. His master snorted and stroked his side. Dean snaked his arms around his master. He hated taking comfort from masters but he didn't have anyone else.
When they got to the ship his master dropped him down onto his feet. His master froze. His eyes flicked over Dean, lingering on the spots where the blue sticky stuff had rubbed off onto him. His master let out a furious growl and snapped the big dagger tail up.
He tried to twist away but that only got him tied down with the leash and collar. His master brought the toothbrush back up to his mouth. This time Dean refused to open up for him. He set his jaw and glared.
Dean sleeping on the floor lasted three nights before Castiel's will broke down. He missed having Dean curled up with him. He hadn't realized how well he had been sleeping with the pet in his bed until he wasn't there anymore.
Mary Winchester took a step forward. "No."
"Yeah, well, you try getting flung out into space in a damn box," Dean growled. He grabbed the blanket and tucked it more tightly around himself.
A tiny group of humans crept out from among the broccoli looking trees. Dean thought he might cry. It felt like
Evan reached down and drew a finger along Castiel's softening cock. He trailed his finger up until he was drawing it through a splatter of come. He rubbed it into Castiel's skin. "I heard sirens couldn't come with their cocks."
he'd deign to give it to him.
His master responded by looking him over and making a weird lizard face at him while hissing. His master clacked his claws twice then went to a cupboard across from the bed. He took out a pile of stuff that Dean didn't immediately recognize.
"What do you think alphas are like?" Dean asked from his spot beside him, half hidden by the late spring grass. It was already knee high and would only get taller with the summer.
It was probably a weird fetish. He wrinkled his nose. Was he agreeing to something depraved by Hflip standards?
His master's second tail arched around Dean. The very tip dipped into the bowl and scooped out a mouthful of mush. He clicked his claws and hissed and said Dean's name.
Castiel hesitated, not sure how to say why he had come. He drew in breath and straightened his shoulders. "I don't want charity."
feeding session for breakfast. His master got all nervous about it and practically shoved him off his lap halfway through and raced out the door.
"Oh, don't feel bad. It took me forever to get here." Qech said as he led the way to his lounge. "It got so much easier once I had learned some human and they had learned some Ipix."
for it.
"The stabilizer," Castiel tested.
Gabriel pushed Castiel behind a cart in the alley and shoved him down behind it. The shouts of
Dean jumped in surprise when the puffball started making a whistling noise. His master hissed and clicked at it. Dean relaxed as he realized the purple puffball was the shopkeeper or the cashier or something like that.
A part of the wall popped off and slid down. Dean yelped and stumbled back. He glared at the door that had been all but invisible a second ago.
Castiel closed his eyes and tried not to fall into the jaws fear and worry. Out of all of them Gabriel was the least likely to pick a fight with the priest and bring a mob down on them. He was very probably just going to find out how much the priest saw. Or thought he saw.
One handed Castiel helped Gabriel heave the sack into the cart. Gabriel frowned at the sack. He bit his lip. He breathed deep. His face went carefully blank.
Her arm spines flexed again. Castiel decided it was in excitement and not anger. She must be from Kuqq. She tapped a code into the panel. "We've been calling this one Dean for short. Its last owner called it De*anlk."
"It's always helpful when you're still nursing, a wet nurse can be hard to find sometimes." His grandmother explained without looking at him. "Some mothers don't make milk right away or they're too tired to nurse properly."
Castiel bit his lip. Kali's family had influence with the elders but it took money to persuade the priest. And what if Kali said things in favour of them and the priest turned the village on her too? He couldn't do that to Gabriel.
He watched his sisters take Deidre out into the yard, still talking about leeks. He pressed his hands to the table, wanting to push away and go after them. He didn't want to talk about Daven Hills' leathery hands holding onto his hips. He didn't want to talk about being a whore just like the village said he was.
Things fell back into their normal routine after that. He taught Dean new commands and Dean showed off trying to out preform himself, always begging for extra food after.
"I doubt it," Castiel said, rubbing at the thump of pain on his head. He loved his daughter. He truly did. But he thought he'd
Castiel glared at him. He tossed the coins down for the smaller loaf of bread and snatched it off the counter. The baker laughed. Castiel turned away. He tugged the hood closer to his face and yanked at the satchel he wore to slide the bread inside.
He cursed to himself. He knew the door was
They stayed until Rachel Goodson woke up again. His grandmother explained all the proper things to do, the charms to carry, and the spells to say to keep the baby healthy. Rachel listened raptly and thanked them. Michael showed them to the door and shut it in their faces.
While the humans ate, Qech offered advice on how to make bath time easier for Dean. There were a few things that Castiel thought would work ‒ not waiting until his pet was practically falling asleep and to let Dean investigate the brushes and wipes outside of the bathroom ‒ but there were other things that were utterly absurd. He wasn't about to let his pet clean himself or decide when bath time should be. If he let Dean pick bath time his little speckled pet would be speckled with dirt instead of spots.
Castiel backed up. He remembered his grandmother doing that to him but he hadn't cared at the time. He'd just been so mad at all the pain. But he wasn't in pain now. He couldn't stick his fingers into Rachel Goodson's cunt. They used to buy rice from the Goodsons.
Dean jerked back at the twitch of his bladed tail. He chattered worriedly at Castiel.
Cold anger burned in Castiel's stomach. He knew his grandmother would say yes. She'd never spite an innocent babe.
Although, he wasn't sure his master
Mary Winchester glared at him before she spun on her heel and left. Gabriel followed after her and yelled at her from the kitchen door.
And he was considering it a bad idea as he stood in the store and watched the humans tear things apart, fight with each other, and make a general ruckus.
at his master he was getting fed or an extra treat between meals. It was a complete turnaround from how his master had been these past weeks.
the priest bellowed.
Castiel braced himself. His grandmother reached out with the cloth and gently pressed it down. Castiel's eyes rolled into the back of his head.
Qech bent his head around to nuzzle his face into his human's chest. He chuffed in delight when his human wrapped its arms around his head. He stuck his tongue out and flicked it across the human's bare stomach. The human squirmed and made pleased sounds.
The light in his chest sputtered and died.
Dean groaned and let his head fall back. "I hate
Castiel watched them for a moment. There was no more Ipix-sounding chattering. He glanced at Qech. He didn't seem to find the performance particularly astounding. Castiel quietly snorted at himself. Had he really just wondered if a gang of
He wasn't so naïve to think that he was the only person who had ever thought of taking advantage of his pet. He had heard about those shady closed community boards where people discussed it. Had he stumbled into a secretive human-sex group? He shot a look towards the door and debated on making a hasty getaway.
Castiel eyed the human carefully. It had ducked down and froze at Castiel's quick movements and was looking up cautiously at him.
normal. He could still be clingy sometimes but not to such an excess. Even so, Castiel kept
All the breath left Castiel's lungs.
Dean eyed the wall warily. He reached out slowly and tapped it. Nothing happened. His shoulders tightened up. He took a step over, braced himself, and tapped. Nothing happened. He took another step over and did the whole song and dance again.
It took Dean a few more days to return to
be compatible.
And Brianne always traded in food his family needed.
He climbed up his master's huge chair and snuggled in next to him. His master wrapped an arm around him and pulled him in closer.
Dean stared at the tail in front of him. He turned and looked up at his master. "You've got to be kidding."
Castiel flicked his mating tail in the air and snorted again. He had been so worked up about it. But Dean was a good pet. He knew better without having to be trained not to.
Castiel spent the rest of the day in his office. Dean spent the day alternating between napping in his lap and wandering around his office while he chattered away at things— a trait Castiel had learned most humans carried. They didn't seem to be able to differentiate between something living and something inanimate.
He flung himself down into a chair at the kitchen table and tried to cut leather for charms but his fingers wouldn't keep still long enough. His first heat hadn't been this bad but his grandmother had said conceiving Deidre had lessened it.
Castiel wiped carrot from Deidre's face. "Evan Fawkes." His own face heated up. "He'll pay in coins."
Castiel wanted to crush the tiny flicker of hope in his chest. "...did Dean come back?" What if Dean had changed his mind? What if Dean had realized what he'd done?
"Yes," Castiel said. Dean glanced over at him but quickly decided that he wasn't being called over and went back to his chattering with the other pets. "More than that would be impractical on a ship."
Castiel jumped, turning to find Kali behind him.
into you?" his father snarled.
Gabriel snorted. "You sound ready to go into fits of happiness." He gave Castiel a gentle slap to his arm. "I get it. I'd be leaving. But we'll still live in the village for most of the year. And I could send money home when we're gone."
Anna snatched the packet from his hands and opened it up. She inspected the needles carefully and nodded to herself just like their grandmother would. "Do we keep them or ask Gabriel to trade them for something else?"
He wanted to go out. He could trade for their food and spell supplies, put the feeling under his skin to good use. He knew how to do it right now. He could do it. He'd feel better and they'd have dinner on the table.
Gabriel shoved the door open. "Gran! It's happening!" Gabriel called out. "Auntie, take the girls to Kali's mother!"
They both gasped when Dean's cock caught at his asshole. Dean did it again. He bit his lip. He pushed forward. Castiel whined as Dean's cock speared him open. He didn't know if this was part of sex or if they were doing something new and sinful but it set him on fire and made him want to squirm and whine and scream.
Sam gave a short whistle. Adam Winchester slithered out from the shadows. Sam bent down and whispered in his ear. Adam ran down the alley. A moment later Mary Winchester stepped around the corner.
He plastered himself against the wall and contemplated just how very wrong he had been as a kid and whether his master had been feeding him all those extra treats to fatten him up so he could feed him to a dragon.
Hannah and Anna came bouncing out of the throng of people in the village square. Gabriel was behind them hauling their food staples for the month.
"Good." Castiel took the leash and stared down at the human.
on the flying death trap and they were finally going to get off.
He tried to piece together what
"It's meal time for my pets," Qech said, breaking the silence. "Do you mind if your pet eats too?"
He checked his watch. He could find another store tomorrow. He still had time. He sighed to himself. If he left here today without one he'd never work himself back up into looking at them again and then eventually he'd lose his mind on one of his long deliveries and his therapist would use him as an example to his future patients of the dangers of touch deprivation.
The purple puffball whistled at him and tugged at his leash. Dean stepped forward. The puffball whistled again and started leading him down a hall behind the desk. Dean followed it, wondering if it had hands hidden somewhere under all that fuzzy purple stuff.
"It is," his grandmother insisted. "It's just a bunch of overfed priests who think otherwise."
He peered at his fingers in the near dark. There wasn't any blood, just a clear sticky fluid. It spread apart in strings when he opened and closed his hands. He grimaced;
Once Castiel had the warming sheath on he laid back in bed. He motioned for Dean to lay down beside him. Dean hesitated for a moment before slowly cuddling against his leg. Castiel reached down and scratched Dean's head.
bare their teeth in aggression." She stopped scratching the human's jaw and flexed her arm, clicking two spines together to make a sharp click.
snuck into the honourable Winchester home."
He darted behind his master and put the dagger tail between him and the
Castiel stopped. He peered into the alley. He looked around himself. No one was paying him any more attention than they did these days; just quick looks to confirm he was the whore. He tugged at the hood of his cloak again.
The second tail unwound from his shoulders to pick up the bowl from the counter. Dean gently took the bowl from his master's second tail and got another
to have his mating tail wrapped around a warm body but it was his
He went over to the pile of tools and picked out the one his master was asking for. He didn't know what the long stick thing with a red ball on the end actually did but it was the size of his calf and damn heavy.
He pet Dean's head and chuckled to himself. "You just like to stay warm. Don't you, little pet?"
"You haven't been with a woman?" His grandmother asked. Castiel blushed and shook his head. His grandmother nodded. "Well, when you do, she won't want a day's worth of dirt and grime in her bird's nest." His grandmother stopped and looked up at Castiel. "The same for an omega boy. Clean fingers if you don't want a bout of the itches." She nodded to herself. "And a clean cock if you don't want a love sickness."
Castiel wiped his mouth clean and sat back on his heels. It wasn't the first time he had finished with Evan Fawkes then come out to have Cepheus crook a finger at him and take him into his private rooms.
Castiel stared at Rachel Goodson. He knew how big Deidre had been when she was born. He didn't know how something that big was going to come out of Rachel. He didn't know how something that big had come out of
"He's trying to keep me to himself." Kali said absently. She frowned at the priest. "What happened?"
His grandmother started yelling. Gabriel darted up from the bed. He reached for the door just as it swung open. Mary Winchester burst into the room, his grandmother close behind her.
His master set the sanitizer unit down then reached for Dean. Dean braced himself for lift off. That was something else about having a master twice the size of him, he could pick him up.
He pulled up the hood of his cloak and hurried. No one stopped him. No one talked to him. But he could still feel them staring.
"How long has it been?" His grandmother asked.
His grandmother offered him a cloth. "You'll miss it when she's older."
Gabriel elbowed her. Hannah snorted in amusement but had the propriety to look offended.
Hannah held up the protection charms. "He had these in his pockets."
to mark the doors because his master would stop in front of them and read what he thought must be manifests or inventories.
Dean made a pleased noise against his neck. "Yeah. Perfect."
"I told you!" his father yelled again. "I told you if we stayed we'd be cursed!"
He spit at them. "I'm not selling my daughter."
His thoughts must have shown on his face because his grandmother began explaining while she pulled back the blankets from Rachel's lower half.
Castiel had read that isolation was an effective punishment for humans but he hadn't thought it would be
He sat down on the bed and started to roll the warming sheath on. He caught movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned to find Dean watching him roll the sheath on. He froze with his hands on his mating tail. Dean was watching him getting ready to masturbate. A sharp thrill went through him. Was all the training finally working?
He'd have to find out soon. He couldn't have a pet running around frightened during an emergency.
"Did any of the men stop you?" his father asked next.
The dragon's head snaked down to stare at him. Its tongue flicked out. His master hissed again. The dragon's head angled up. It hissed back. The dragon recoiled its head and made a noise like rolling thunder.
Mary Winchester held herself tall. "We all know who that baby's father is."
"See? It takes you by surprise," Dean chuckled.
Daven pushed forward. Castiel gasped in pain as the hard cock speared his hole open. Daven kept pushing in. Castiel whimpered, it felt like his hole was tearing apart. It hadn't hurt like this when he had done it with Dean. It hadn't hurt at all.
warm body. His pet that didn't know any better. Dean probably just thought it was some new show of affection.
Castiel nodded.
Dean gave his mating tail a few more licks before trying to squirm away. Castiel let him. He didn't want Dean to associate the command with anything bad and he wasn't about to let his mating tail unfurl because of a pet. He might be desperate for a bit of physical contact but he wasn't
"I don't want to trade." Castiel told her. "It's a gift for your babes."
"And your heat will make you loose enough that you don't have to worry much about the size of a cock unless he's a bull in bed," his grandmother said. She mixed together the ingredients then set the bowl down in front of Castiel. "But when you're not in heat, you have to do it yourself. Or get them to do it for you."
His grandmother passed Deidre to Hannah then crouched down beside him. She laid a hand on his head. "Not too hot," she commented. She stood up, her knees cracking.
"If you were just a good pet about brushing your teeth..." Castiel said sadly. Dean hadn't acted up about bath time since he'd been punished but it was obvious to Castiel that bath time was taking its toll on his pet.
Castiel bit his lip. Maybe Gabriel had been right. Maybe the Blackdogs needed to swallow their pride first if they wanted to eat. Castiel looked up and down the street. He breathed deep and stepped into the alley.
Even inanimate objects or other animals. And tentatively worried about human mating cycles. The procedure done at the shop had sterilized Dean but it didn't alter his body's hormonal systems. Which meant he'd been letting a fully sexually developed human in the prime of their breeding life sleep in his bed. And humans would mate with anything.
"They don't scold their children for it where you can't hear them." Anna growled. Despite being younger she had grown protective of him. "And you know they won't do it as soon as you stop making milk or their babies get older."
Dean sighed in defeat. "If you just let me do it..."
Dean didn't even seem to mind that Qech's human was pulling him along by his hand. From Castiel's experiences at bath time he knew Dean hated having his hands immobilized.
Dean kept his distance from his master as he hissed at the purple puffball. The puffball whistled and made a shrieking noise that made Dean cover his ears. His master clicked his claws then scooped Dean up and marched out of the kennel.
Castiel hissed. He looked over his shoulder, Michael hadn't followed. "They can pay more than one—"
More leaked out of him. He grabbed more grass. His heart started to beat in panic when it didn't stop. He stuck his hand between his legs then brought his fingers up to his face, fearing blood. Maybe what they had done wasn't how sex worked. Maybe he had hurt himself.
The priest and three men marched past the alley shouting. Two men followed after them dragging a bound and struggling Sam Winchester between them.
Dean yelped and jumped a foot into the air as a door popped open. His master snorted at him and pet his head. Dean scowled up at him. "Yeah. Really funny. Just wait until you literally scare the shit out of me and have to clean
"They're fine to walk with unprotected feet on most smooth surfaces within temperatures they're comfortable with but otherwise I recommend the foot coverings that we picked out," the store employee said, clipping a collar around the human's neck and adding a leash. She passed the leash to Castiel. "Dean's very well trained to walk on a leash."
being fed with his mating tail.
Castiel could feel his fellow pet owner's eyes lingering on the patches of blue that peaked out from his coveralls but Qech had so far had the courtesy to not ask.
one partner when he stopped.
Castiel hadn't been thankful that Gabriel had moved in with Kali when he had returned a week ago until that very moment.
The kid sucked in an amazed gasp. She spun around and started waving and fluttering her hands at the dragon. The dragon watched her and hissed sharply when she went still. The kid practically
"Good Dean," Castiel praised, taking the tool.
Evan Fawkes stared at him, eyes flicking back and forth, before he nodded. He closed the door behind him and set his lunch on top of the dresser. He crossed the room in two strides and stopped in front of Castiel.
"Kali's..." Gabriel sighed. "One day."
His grandmother squinted at the note. She gasped softly. She hobbled over to the hearth and tossed it in.
Dean hesitantly reached out and took the ball. He winced, expecting punishment anyway, but his master made a low approving hiss and gave him a pat on the head.
His therapist had suggested a few different animals that formed close pack bonds but none of them were suitable for long term space travel, he had only begrudgingly suggested he get a human when Castiel had told him that he was thinking about installing a basic AI to talk to.
"You know." Mary Winchester said.
The store employee gave Dean one last scratch to the jaw then congratulated Castiel on his new pet before hurrying away to help the next customer.
at his body before. Daven just told him to lay down then did what he wanted to do.
Castiel packed up two crates of their wares then joined his grandmother at the front of the cart. She had Deidre in her lap, dangling a protection charm in front of her to play with.
Maybe it wasn't
In seconds Castiel could hear Dean's breathing even out. His pet was already asleep.
Castiel shrugged. "We'll ask grandma what she thinks."
"Shit!" Dean swore. "I'm gonna be in so much trouble!"
Kali narrowed her eyes at the priest back. "I could talk to the elders."
Castiel nodded wordlessly. He started pulling his clothes on. Evan took a bite of his lunch, watching Castiel dress as he ate. It made Castiel's skin crawl. Evan Fawkes had just fucked him until he was moaning and now he was watching him indifferently while he stuffed his mouth.
"Ah! Shit!" Dean jumped back. His body prickled with nerves. He
A week before Kali had left to go back to the coast for business Kali and Gabriel had given each other a mating bite. They had planned to marry before she left again but the priest had refused to do the ceremony.
Michael Goodson led the way to his home, slowing for Castiel's grandmother. Michael kept looking over his shoulder at them, trying to will Castiel's grandmother to move faster.
Dean repeated the ritual twice more before Castiel realized Dean wanted to be fed again. Castiel sighed at his semi-successful attempt at training Dean then got up to catch Dean and bring him back to bed.
The next morning he woke up with Dean wrapped around his leg and his mating tail exactly where he had left it.
Castiel pet him for a few more moments before gently lifting him off his lap and placing him on the bed. He made sure the blanket was tucked in around him before leaving him to sleep.
Dean didn't know what it meant but he recognized a command when he heard one now. Dean shrugged at him. "I don't get it."
His grandmother let him rest through one more contraction before making him push again. He grunted and screamed and swore as he pushed down for all he was worth. Castiel felt something impossibly wide push against his hole.
"He's a siren and a witch!" John shouted. He locked eyes with Castiel. "He put me under a spell and seduced me!" He turned to the crowd. "You all know the Blackdog women are witches! They had David Milton under their spell for years! He's no better!"
"What're you going to call her?"
His grandmother stood and went to the cupboards. She took out a bowl and ingredients. "You were in heat the first time. That's why it didn't hurt. When you're in heat it doesn't take much at all to make slick. A little bit of kissing should get your pants wet."
He spent a few hours reading up on human life habits and came away thoroughly amused by how humans had been observed to mate with
His master glanced down. His face did the weird thing again. He reached down and pet Dean's head.
Apprehension suddenly filled Castiel. How did he tell them that he couldn't? That he had to go back to the village after breakfast. Even after his grandmother's advice on how to trade himself they still didn't talk about what he did.
His master kept him close the next few days and spoiled him rotten. Every time he so much as
He didn't try to tug the sleeves down further. It would only draw more attention to his sexual blunder— he had rushed the Hflip through explaining the finer details of their version of sex and missed the part where the mating fluids stained their partner's skin for upwards of a year. And to make matters worse, the sex had only been average at best.
Dean pulled back. His face was bright red. He stared down at Castiel's chest. "Does that...did we..." Dean bit his lip. He flicked his eyes up to Castiel's. "Was that sex?"
Castiel turned on his heel and marched out of the alley. He felt himself start to shake. He had turned down food and coin that could keep his family fed. He had turned down the chance to erase the mark on his name. He had turned down an easier life for his daughter.
This time his master didn't flip out and managed to get through the whole bowl before letting Dean go. Honestly, Dean wished his master was still nervous about it. He'd rather feed himself.
sexually aggressive.
"Like this." Castiel said. He squirmed until his legs were spread wide and Dean was between them. He rolled his hips up. His cock slid against Dean's stomach. He shivered when it pressed against Dean's cock. "Th-then that."
They came to the end of another alleyway. The noise of the mob grew louder. Gabriel put his hand up for Castiel to stop. He leaned around the corner to look.
He wrote himself a note to absolutely not pass on finding partners at his next stop even if he thought he didn't need to by then.
home. "With..."
His master took his claw out of his mouth and unclipped his leash. He reached out to pet Dean. Dean recoiled from him and his claws.
He tapped it again.
Dean picked a ball from the box and absently rolled it from hand to hand while he watched his master. It was weird. His master definitely wasn't busy. He was getting ready for bed. Dean frowned down at the ball. Had he misbehaved so badly that his master thought he couldn't be left alone and unoccupied for more than a couple of seconds?
with him.
Castiel sobbed into his arms. He didn't want to be a siren.
The snorting sound was good this time. His master made a series of noises that Dean knew meant
Dean made a desperate embarrassed noise and started to pull away. "I'm such an idiot. I don't know anything."
Dean shuffled over and draped an arm over his master's leg. He wasn't exactly tired. He hadn't done anything all day. But he knew his master liked the physical contact. He'd doze for a while then get up and try to figure out more of the ship. He'd make sure he was back in the bedroom before his master woke up.
Dean curled into the blanket and ignored his master. He didn't know if it would be better or worse if his master understood him. Maybe he could explain to him why he hated bath time and his master would finally let him do it on his own. Or maybe he'd explain it and his master would just snort at him and do it anyway.
Dean breathed hard through his nose and started thrusting forward. He groaned. Castiel cried out. He squirmed on Dean's cock. It was too much but he wanted more. He wanted Dean's cock to push in forever and never stop.
It didn't take long for the bolder humans in the bunch to drag him into a hug then start tugging him along to a tiny clearing in the broccoli trees and showing him how to get lunch from the food dispenser.
He heard his father march to his room. His father didn't knock. He pushed the door open and came in.
Hannah and Anna raced around the end of the cart next, shrieking out Kali's name and yanking her into hugs.
"I don't know yet." Castiel said. He stroked his hand over the tiny bundle on his chest.
"That's what an aggressive show will look like," the employee said. She clicked her spines again. The human relaxed. "The lips only pull up in front. You actually see less teeth."
Castiel squeezed the opening of his mating tail around the fake egg at the bottom of the warming sheath. A little rush of pleasure raced through him. Dean squirmed as his mating tail flexed around him.
Gabriel's face turned stony. He let go of Castiel's arm. "Stay here with grandma. Pack up what you can." He stalked away, quickly disappearing into the market crowd.
Castiel chewed and swallowed and didn't taste a thing. He kept his eyes on the crates. "I didn't ask to be an omega."
Castiel didn't indulge him often, he didn't want to overfeed his pet, but the occasional treat wasn't harmful.
Mary Winchester walked closer to him. She dangled the purse with his bride price in it before him. "I'll give you this. You just have to let me take Deidre Dean home to her family. You won't have to ever worry about her again. We'll make sure she doesn't starve. She'll grow up strong and happy and loved."
The employee led him back to the one that had curled up into a frightened ball. No amount of coaxing could get it to come closer to Castiel. They tried another that had seemed mildly interested in Castiel but it ultimately had just wanted to be fed.
"What for?" Anna asked, puzzled. Her eyebrows furrowed in concern when he didn't answer. Castiel could see it when she realized what he meant. She looked over her shoulder at the cupboard where the two loaves of bread sat. "But you already..."
Castiel shivered in relief at the sound of Gabriel's voice.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the brush. Castiel was sure he was going to stubbornly keep his mouth closed but Dean glanced up at him and slowly opened his mouth.
"Push!" His grandmother demanded. "Now, Castiel!"
It didn't sting at all. Not even with the light burn Castiel was used to now. He groaned and wrapped his legs around him. It wasn't anything like being with Daven Hills. His hole was loose and pliant, ready to open up for Evan and let his cock slide in with a rush of slick. Everything inside Castiel lit up with pleasure until Evan's cock was fully sheathed inside him.
His master started making grumbly noises at the dragon. They hissed and grumbled at each other. Dean got the drift that his master wasn't too impressed by whatever the dragon had to say.
Castiel looked across the kitchen to where his sister was holding his child on her knee. His stomach ached with the memory of pain. He didn't want to go through a birth again even if it wasn't his own.
Dean chattered at him, worried and confused from what Castiel could tell. Castiel sighed. His pet didn't understand what he had done. Punishing him for it would only confuse him more. Dean probably wouldn't make the connection between the punishment and touching his mating tail.
"I think that was still kissing." Castiel said. He wasn't entirely sure but he was mostly certain. Gabriel had told him people have sex with their mouths but he hadn't said how.
"We can find something else if you don't want to keep paying in trade," his grandmother said. She pat his knee. "But if you do keep doing it you have to get yourself ready first."
They employee motioned for Castiel to try out scratching the human's jaw. The human stiffened at first but when Castiel didn't make any sudden movements it relaxed and made a pleased noise. He ran his knuckles over the human a few times, exploring its skin, before he stepped out of its cage.
He looked down at himself. The shirt was solid pale orange with long sleeves and the pants were yellow with a purple pattern on them that Dean had seen often enough to know it was the store logo for the pet store he had been in. They were boring in comparison to what his last master had bought for him but he wasn't going to complain. It was the first time he had been dressed all year.
Castiel waited until Dean had gone an entire day without making a nuisance of himself before he thought about resuming training Dean at meal times.
The priest gaped like a fish as his eyes flicked over his initials on the letter opener. He snatched it off Hannah and hastily stuffed it into his pocket. His eyes flicked over each of them until they landed on Castiel.
He pressed his hand against the bread in his satchel. It wouldn't be enough. They hadn't had enough the past two months. Each time they had dipped into the money his father had left behind. They would have to do it again. There wouldn't be a next time.
cuddling up with his master— he always had to watch out for claws. He'd rather cuddle up with other humans or some of the furry pets his other masters had kept. But he had gotten used to wrapping an arm around his master's leg and the way his master's tail would wrap around him.
His grandmother stiffened in her seat. Her face flashed with anger.
His grandmother snorted with amusement. She took Deidre from Castiel's lap. "You need to change then. He won't pay as well if you're covered in carrots and drool."
"How much for that one?" Castiel pointed to a loaf that would reasonably feed his family for more than a day.
Castiel wiped at his eyes. "Ready?"
Castiel's bladed tail arched in surprise. He turned to find a store employee watching him. The spines along her arms flexed. Castiel curled his mating tail close to his body. She was Thuud, depending where she was from she was either happy to help him or she was about to pick a fight.
"Okay." Castiel wasn't sure how he felt about that. He didn't enjoy doing this. He doubted he'd enjoy
He knew his master had bought him shoes and clothes but apparently he didn't want to bother cleaning them in transit because Dean hadn't been given a single stitch to wear since getting on board his master's ship.
"Whoa! Hey!" Dean squawked.
want to?" Castiel asked.
It was weird sleeping alone again. He didn't actually
Castiel let her baby drain both his breasts before giving him back to Brianne, the poor thing needed a full meal. Brianne whispered another thanks and turned to go. Castiel was pulling his shirt back into place when Brianne froze. A desperate whimper left her.
He didn't have long to contemplate an answer. His master clipped his leash on and told him to follow. Dean didn't waste time obeying if it meant another trip to the park. He hadn't really had enough time to make friends last time but there were a few people there that he hoped he'd see again.
A quiet cough from behind him caught his attention. He turned to find Brianne Shields, the butcher's wife, peaking around from behind the cart. Castiel looked between her and Anna. He sighed and went to Brianne. She'd had twins and as well as the butcher fed his family she simply didn't make enough milk for both babies.
"No," Castiel said. A familiar chill settled in his stomach. It hadn't hurt until after. Not until Dean had run away instead of staying and the village had called him a whore for it.
"I have to go back to the village after breakfast," Castiel said, trying his best to sound casual. He held up a spoonful of carrot for Deidre. She managed to get more of it on her face than in her mouth. "I'll meet you in the woods in the afternoon."
His master finished cleaning the bowls from breakfast and dinner. He hissed something at Dean then bent down and picked him up, blanket and all.
At the end of the day he scooped Dean up and carried him to the kitchen for dinner. He watched in amusement as his pet yawned his way through dinner. And was more than thankful that Dean had tired himself out enough to barely complain about bath time.
He stopped paying attention to where they were going ‒ it wasn't the pet park so what did it matter? ‒ so was surprised when he realized that the bustle of the main halls of the station had given away to the quiet residential areas.
"Thank you," Castiel said. He hurried down the hall, grateful to be out of sight of Cepheus even if he had never bothered to look up.
There was only one ad from a fellow Helodem on the station. Another spur. A mated rasa-olio pair would be
He hated having to—
There was no hot pain of teeth tearing into him.
was racing through his blood.
"In his room," Daven said. He stepped aside, letting Castiel past him to the cooling racks. "He lives out of the Silver Head. Off the main street."
Castiel looked his human over. It stared back at him, waiting for a command. Castiel sighed. There was no point in stalling. He should take the human back to his ship and start training it while he was grounded.
"Nothing." Castiel tugged at his shirt. He looked over his shoulder to see the priest marching away, the stick up his ass keeping him ramrod straight. Castiel hoped it was nothing. He hoped he hadn't just invited another mob to their home.
"No?" Castiel said, perplexed. "There aren't any alphas in the village."
Anna and Hannah were quick to push away from the table and head out the door. Castiel's shoulders slumped as he sank deeper into his seat. He let out a long sigh then picked up a cold piece of toast.
Dean's shock became a sly grin. "Are you a horrible hairy creature?"
Castiel flinched with pain when Daven pulled out. He felt a warm trickle of come leak from his hole. Daven laughed and ran a finger over Castiel's hole.
He called Dean over before he could think Qech was setting a bowl out for him too. Dean cast a longing look towards the other humans but was immediately distracted by the dental treat. His pet started stuffing it into his face as fast as he could.
it. It felt weird and it tasted funny and his master never seemed to realize he was jamming it in too far and too hard.
"Oh, no!" the employee said. "We have everything right here. Even the travel options."
He found big green and scaly half inside the wall working on something. Dean hoped that something was whatever had been making that godawful screeching noise last night.
His master snorted ‒ Dean thought it was probably something like a laugh ‒ then started to take out Dean's bowl and the food. He kept his second tail where it was, still rubbing under Dean's chin.
He raced back to the kitchen. It was the last place he had seen Dean and the best place to start looking for him. He'd get Dean, carry him back to the ship as fast as possible, finish resupplying, and then never come back to this damned station again.
"Ummm..." Dean looked down at the ball more confused now than he had been before. "Okay?"
"Where would I go?" Gabriel smiled sadly. "You're all the family I have."
"I couldn't ask you to do that." Castiel wouldn't watch Gabriel and Kali live hand to mouth to support them.
Castiel could hear the baker in the back. He called out. The baker yelled at him that he was still closed. Castiel gulped down his fears and went to the back.
His master stared at him expectantly. Dean rolled the ball between his hands. His master pet his head again and cooed his name at him.
He had thought they were just going to cuddle then go to sleep but his master never gave him toys and left him to entertain himself unless he really was busy.
Her arm spines flexed in delight. "Excellent." She tapped out a pattern on the panel of the human's cage. The panel faded to a murky green hiding the human from sight. "Do you have everything you'll need for a human?"
He almost sent his therapist a strongly worded letter for suggesting he get a pet in the first place and being the source of the entire ordeal but stopped when he realized he'd have to admit to having thoroughly thought out how to go about using his pet to masturbate.
Castiel brushed a finger along his baby's nose. He looked up and gave Mary Winchester a predatory smile. "I'm sorry, Mary. I'm a whore and a liar. I slept with dozens of men before I ever slept with a Winchester. I really couldn't say who Deidre Dean's father is."
"Deidre is for grandma's great aunt." Castiel explained. He didn't think he needed to explain where Dean came from.
His master clicked his claws at him and tugged on the leash.
"Do you think Gabriel's married yet?" Hannah asked, passing Castiel a full bucket.
It was a thoroughly embarrassing display of intimacy between owner and pet. At least Castiel confined his perverse behaviour with Dean to the solitary confines of his ship and didn't do it in front of people.
Castiel swallowed back the pain in his throat that threatened to be a sob. He was sore, his breasts kept leaking, and he had cloth wrapped around his nethers because he was
Dean poked at his mating tail and the warming sheath. He glanced up at Castiel and chattered.
"I think, uh, if you open your mouth a little..." Dean muttered. Castiel opened his eyes to find Dean turning pink above him. Dean nervously bit at his lip. "I saw Gabriel and Kali do it that way. It...they looked like they liked it."
Maybe there'd be a pet supply store at his next stop and he could ask about alternative bathing techniques for humans. He was sure he had read something about dental chews.
good in relation to him.
Dean gulped. He grabbed at the hem of his shirt and pulled it off. He crawled off Castiel to squirm out of his pants while Castiel did the same.
He shuffled up the bed and wrapped an arm around his master's leg. His master reached down and wrapped his second tail around Dean. It was bandaged up again. It flexed around Dean's waist. Dean shifted his arms and let it snug up higher on his chest.
Guilt settled into his stomach. It was one thing to get his pet to lick at his mating tail and get a little bit of an aroused buzz. But getting his pet to lick up his come and slick was just...
He added that to his list as he carried Dean to the kitchen.
The sponge brush was yanked out of his mouth. He got another rub of the knuckles on his side and a
Castiel glanced up at her. "...dry?"
Castiel glared. He knew his grandmother was only teasing him, trying to bring him out of his mood, but he
His grandmother made an approving noise and held her hand out for the satchel. Hannah and Anna crowded around her and talked excitedly about the spell work they could learn now that their mother was gone. Gabriel disappeared around the side of the cart. Castiel slipped off the edge of the cart and followed him.
"Finally." Dean hurried in after his master before the door chopped a piece of him off.
for all your lies!" She craned her walking stick back like she meant to hit the priest.
His grandmother cursed at herself again. She stood up and moved to the chair next to him. She sat down, groaning softly under her breath about her knees. She ran her fingers through his hair and pushed it from his eyes.
He should have known it was an accident. Dean only cared about pleasing him, eating, and sleeping. Dean had never shown any interest in mating. It was an accident.
He shoved in through the back door of his family's tiny home well after dark and
"Get me ready." Daven spread his legs and motioned to his cock.
Anna made a strange noise, half laugh and half scandalized squawk. Hannah elbowed her to be quiet.
Dean didn't even want to fight it this time. If his master was willing to take him out of the kitchen and away from the outside view he would be happy to sit through another bath.
"Don't," Castiel pleaded. They couldn't afford for his grandmother to pick a fight with Daven Hills. They needed the bread. They needed so much more. And he'd trade for it when he could. "I want to do this. It doesn't matter if it hurts as long as we can eat."
effective. Dean had barely left his side since after his punishment. He had enjoyed it at first, having Dean eager to sit with him and cuddle up to him, but after a few days of Dean being constantly underfoot it was aggravating.
Gabriel swung around the end of the cart and wrapped an arm around Kali's waist. "And tell them what? That the notorious sinners in the village tricked you into their family?"
"Well, I don't think I'm going to get eaten anymore, so, pretty good." Dean said. "And it's

to market?" The priest's voice was sharp and scathing. He reached across the crates and yanked the hood off Castiel's head before Castiel could jump back. "You think you can bewitch honest mated men into sin, threaten the village with curses, and then simply walk about with the fruits of your sin?"
a nose.
Castiel grabbed the cloak and threw it around himself. He pulled the hood up to hide his face. Gabriel stuck his head out the door. He listened for a moment then waved at Castiel to follow him.
The priest grabbed Castiel's arm and jerked him around. He motioned for two of the men to hold him still. They grabbed Castiel's arms and dragged him over to the side of the well. They pushed his head down until his cheek was pressed against the cold damp stone.
"Of course!" The priest agreed. "No one would believe such lies from such an obvious sinner!"
They had another weird hand feeding—
shoved Castiel's head down to pull his shirt off. It was yanked roughly over his head, snagging on his ears.
Dean stared down at him like he had declared him god's favoured on a feast day. Dean gulped. He rolled his hips the way Castiel had done. He stopped and shivered. "I didn't think it'd be..."
Dean craned his head back to look up at him.
"You're an omega," his grandmother said softly. She reached down and pushed the hair from his eyes. "Your father had hoped calling you Milton and having the priest bless you would banish the curse but everyone knows that every Blackdog boy grows up to be a siren no matter their father's name or how hard their family prays."
The human immediately squared its shoulders and showed its teeth.
Cepheus didn't pay him as much as Daven or Evan but he only ever wanted his mouth and he didn't treat Castiel like a stray to be kicked out of his business or leer at him afterwards.
"Third room on the left." Cepheus waved distractedly towards the hall. He didn't ask why Castiel was there.
rather quickly. Castiel scritched under Dean's jaw. "Yes. A treat."
Castiel scowled at the crowd as he was stripped in the cold village square. Nine months they had waited to do this. He had started to show just after three months. They could have dragged him from his home then. But no, they wanted spectacle. They wanted to see the huge pregnant swell of his sin.
He scrubbed the brush over Dean's teeth, happy that Dean was obeying again, when he felt the scales along his back rise up.
It was his first heat since Deidre had been born and it had come on like a plague two days earlier. The first day had been subtle. He'd felt feverish but excitable, like he'd been drinking all day. He thought it was just the heat of the summer but the next day his grandmother had dug out a box from a cupboard and gave it to him.
He'd been careful to keep away from it after that. He didn't want to give his master a reason to think he'd attack him.
Dean didn't recognize what language was being called out to him but it didn't matter. It was a
He was thankful no one was home when he came screaming into his pillows.
He curled his claws into his palm and tried to pet it again. This time it was more than happy to let him rub his knuckles along its neck and cheek.
Dean spent the night curled up on his master's lap hugging the second tail to his chest.
Daven Hills slowly picked up the pace of his thrusts. Castiel tried to mask his whines of pain for moans of pleasure. It didn't stop hurting.
He pushed his fingers in and pumped them in and out a handful of times until his slick started running. He pulled his fingers out. That was good enough. It would burn a little bit at first but the feeling didn't take long to dull.
Evan sat up. Castiel could feel his eyes play over him. Evan stood and took his lunch from the dresser. He sat back down on the bed. "Maybe in a week or two. I'll get Daven to tell you when."
Anna glanced over at him but didn't say anything. Hannah's story about finding a grove of leeks stuttered but continued. His grandmother stared.
Mary Winchester's face turned bright red. It reminded him of Dean on that fateful day.
Castiel sighed with him. Then all he could do was bear the pain and wait.
Castiel was seconds from giving up ‒ apparently he was not only terrible for trying to train his pet to do this he was plainly terrible at training his pet ‒ when Dean's tongue darted out and licked delicately at his mating tail.
He flopped backwards onto his bed and stared at the ceiling. That now familiar ache pulsed in his gut. He glanced at the wooden cock on his bedside table. He pressed his face into the pillows and groaned.
His master pushed and pulled him into different positions as he wiped him down. The most awkward part was always the last. His master would pick up a little sponge brush with his other tail and jam the brush into his mouth. He had seriously considered biting that second tail more than a few times when his master had shoved the brush in a little too hard.
He finished up in the bathroom then went in search of his master so he could start begging for breakfast.
had practically had its
Daven shrugged. "I told him I'd ask."
Castiel pulled his head closer for a kiss. Dean's words died on Castiel's lips.
His master huffed. The dagger tail slowly drooped down. He made a soft noise Dean had never heard from him before. He crouched down to Dean's level and carefully drew a claw along the blue sticky stuff that had smeared across Dean's sides and stomach. His master made the soft noise again then hissed and stood up.
Pleasure raced through Castiel's body until he was shaking from the over stimulation. It was too much. It was burning through him and turning into something overwhelming. He clutched at Evan's arms and bore it. He wasn't here for his own pleasure.
Castiel welcomed the distraction. There was something oddly endearing about watching his pet try to coax responses out of inanimate objects or worry over them when he bumped into one.
Castiel's hand went up to the still healing brand on his cheek.
"You'll have to do, I suppose." His grandmother said.
"Yet?" Castiel asked.
He contacted the Hflip a day before he docked at the station. They messaged each other back and forth, messages coming faster the closer he got. The Hflip's given name was unpronounceable for him. They told him to call them Uth instead and explained Hflip sex in greater detail.
The village had come to life while he had been at home. He did his best to disappear into the bustle of the street.
Evan came to the side of the bed and stopped. His eyes travelled over Castiel, lingering here and there. Castiel tried not to squirm under his gaze but he hadn't had anyone really
Somehow it was worse than Daven Hills's gruff attempts at conversation after and then being unceremoniously kicked out of the bakery.
Dean gave a shaky nod. "I think so." He looked down to Castiel's chest. His eyes flicked up and down. "I just...I've only seen animals and...and people are different," Dean repeated, shyly.
Castiel knew his pet was probably no more intelligent than most humans but with nothing else to focus on during a shipment it was hard not to be endlessly amazed at all the commands Dean could remember.
He already knew which loaves of bread he'd take. He'd be gone long before Daven opened his shop.
Castiel snorted in amusement. He would bet his ship that the human's last owner was a Lsserwrat. No one else would name their pet after body fluids.
Dean looked at his clothes covered forearms. What was wrong about the blue stuff that his master didn't want anyone to see?
He started over to his couch but his master caught him around the middle and heaved him up.
"Say something." Castiel's cheeks burned red the longer Dean said nothing. "...Dean?"
The human inside squeaked then curled into a ball and shivered. Castiel wasn't an expert in human behaviours but there were very few species that did that when they were happy. He moved on to the next one.
A shiver crept through Castiel. He pulled his hood up and looked up and down the street. It was too early for most. Only a few people in the village were awake and those that were, were busy getting ready for the day.
Anna turned just as red. "Oh."
Dean's mouth dropped open. He hadn't heard another human speak English in
His master walked right past the turn for the pet park. Dean's shoulders slumped. He slowed down, lingering as long as he could before his master yanked on his leash.
"Where are you going?"
Dean gasped at the room beyond the door. It was made up to look like a park.
Dean filled the silence, rambling about anything that came to mind, as huge knuckles rubbed along his spine.
Dean hated it ‒ he had gotten clawed by accident the first few times ‒ but it usually meant his master was happy about whatever he'd done. Not to mention he didn't have to stand around and guess where the doors were. His master just carried him through. It was worth putting up with.
His master didn't let him go after dinner which meant one thing: bath time.
Castiel gently pushed Dean's head back down with a claw. He said the command again. He could feel his pet squirm with confusion. He pressed his mating tail to Dean's lips and told him to
Castiel stood awkwardly before the little family alter in their snow dusted garden the day after Deidre was born. Dean Winchester had runaway instead of taking him as his mate and now he would raise Dean's bastard while he was branded as a whore. Castiel had thought he'd feel...
Gabriel strode over and took him by the arm. He led Castiel to their shared bedroom. "Stay here," he said then closed the door in Castiel's face.
Castiel shrunk back. He stared at his father. He felt tears well up in his eyes and come leak from his ass.
at him again and drag him to the village square once more.
All Dean did was stare at him and chatter for a few minutes before curling around his legs and going to sleep. He didn't make a move to touch Castiel's mating tail. He didn't start trying to mate with the blankets or the mattress. Dean just wanted to sleep somewhere warm.
..." He squinted at the air between them. "....taught me."
"Even though Michael Goodson is an ass." Anna said. She turned to Castiel and looked him fiercely in the eye. "He was mean about Deidre Dean. We went somewhere else." She looked back to their grandmother. "We only had to go to four different people to get everything. And I think a lot of it's better."
His master clicked his claws and rumbled to himself while staring at Dean. Dean tried to make himself invisible while his master decided on a punishment for whatever it was he had done.
Castiel burst into laughter. He craned his head back further into the grass and smiled up at the sun. Today was perfect. When he went home tonight, he'd make some small trinket to remember it by.
He shook his head. "The water requirements are far too high."
He was wrong.
"You cursed the whole village and John Winchester." His grandmother stopped to spit on the name. "A curse always costs, Castiel. You don't get them for free. And if you're not careful you can get caught up in them."
"It's not your fault," Castiel repeated. That fire between his legs was crawling up his skin. He stroked Dean's arm. "Kiss me again?"
He'd have to get Dean another pet bed and start making him sleep on the floor in the bedroom. He'd move Dean's bed from the kitchen into the bedroom in the meantime. At the next stop he'd purchase a second bed for Dean. And maybe inquire about some of the sterilization techniques that reduced the mating drive. He
man than how,
Castiel paced the kitchen. It was market day but his grandmother had forbidden him from coming. She had gone so far as threatening to tie him down like a goat if he tried. He knew she was right. He couldn't go to market covered in slick ‒ the priest really would form a mob to run him out of town ‒ but the urge to
Dean glared at him and made huffy displeased sounds but he did stop squirming. Castiel didn't chastise him for it. He knew when to pick his battles when training Dean. And this wasn't the time. He still had to brush Dean's teeth. He hoped they wouldn't have another incident over the toothbrush today.
His hands jerked apart. He dropped the bread to his feet. He backed up faster. Would anyone believe him when he told them that he hadn't been the one to steal it? The Winchesters had made him a liar as well as a whore as far as the village was concerned.
Gabriel put his hands up, trying to calm Castiel. "I don't think he's gotten another bug up his ass about you." He pulled a cloak out of his satchel and held it out for Castiel. "But I think it would be better if there weren't any Blackdogs in the village today."
"My mother wants to talk to you." Sam said. He motioned behind himself, further down to a bend in the alley.
Affection. An AI couldn't provide that. Pet therapy would be the best solution.
Only Brianne Shields ever came to him anymore to feed her babes. The priest had dragged her name through the mud almost as badly as he had Blackdog. If there was another butcher in the village her husband would have went out of business. As it was, the villagers had no choice. They either bought their meat from Liam Shields and his witch-associating wife or they didn't buy meat at all.
Dean grimaced. "Seriously?"
"Where is she?" Castiel asked. He peered down the alley. "How do I know you're not trying to rob me too?"
He wasn't about to advertise he had gotten a pet on his therapist's advice.
His grandmother took the cloth. She dabbed some of the kitchen salve onto it. She held it up. "This is going to hurt almost as much as when it happened." His grandmother warned.
of his grandmother's walking stick made them snap their heads around. The high pitched wail of a child filled the air.
Qech's sides inflated as he let out an amused chuff. "I know what you're thinking; this Thwerq has decided to stab himself with his own spines. But they really do understand more than basic commands." He pointed one long claw at the gently swaying horizontal yellow lines on the door to the hall. "They understand Oueyi at the level of a yearling. Not to mention the handful of Ipix words they can manage if you have the patience to teach them."
Anna came dashing around the corner of the cart laughing. Hester gasped in fear. She grabbed her son from Castiel's chest and shoved the packet of sewing needles at Castiel. She pulled her cloak around herself and disappeared into the market before anyone could see her.
He hated it every time. He didn't want to go back to the bakery next week but he knew he'd have to if he didn't want his family to starve.
His master made a snorting sound that Dean still didn't understand. Sometimes the snorting was a good sound but sometimes it was bad. He wasn't even sure it was supposed to mean anything. Maybe giant lizard guys were all prone to runny noses.
His master hissed again and rubbed his knuckle on Dean's cheek right where there was still a blue smudge that hadn't come off. His master made a grumbly noise. Dean looked down at himself again. The pants and shirt hid the rest of the blue stains.
someone do it to him.
Nothing happened. The dragon didn't eat him.
The sound of coins clicking together made him turn back. He watched Mary Winchester dropped three coins into a small heavy looking purse. He backed up towards the street. Whatever it was the Winchesters wanted him to do it wouldn't be worth it. They had already made him a whore, now they were probably trying to make him a thief too.
His master's second tail draped over his shoulder and rubbed under his chin. Dean leaned into the touch. His master made a bunch of pleased hissing.
had dripped from his asshole.
The other human blinked at him. He mouthed what Dean had said. He scrunched his nose. "Is blue. Are you. Is blue. Are you." He shrugged at Dean. "Grandmother..." He stopped and did a series of hand motions. He said a few things in Ipix and looked at Dean expectantly.
They looked up to find the village priest. Castiel pulled at the hood and shrunk back. He could feel the priest's words curl into his ear,
Castiel shook his head. "No. But Gabriel
Castiel stared at the door stunned. After all that they had done for Rachel and Michael had thrown them out like stray cats.
His master dropped him down onto a table in the middle of the room. Dean flopped backwards, closed his eyes, and let his mind wander. He knew there wasn't any fighting this. He had tried to wash up by himself the first few times but his master had eventually tied him down and done it anyway. If he didn't want to be tied down he had to go along with it.
He didn't wait long before Evan pushed the door open and froze. Evan made a startled noise and nearly dropped his lunch to the floor.
Dean didn't hesitate at the command. He jogged along beside his master grateful to be off the damn ship.
"He'll move out," Hannah commented sadly. She filled the second bucket and attached it to the yolk. "I know I should be happy for them. But he'll move out."
Evan nodded. He went to the dresser and took out a pouch. He counted out enough coins to buy two generously seized loaves of bread. He set it aside then turned back around to face Castiel. His eyes flicked up and down Castiel again. He huffed and nodded to himself then pulled his shirt off and started undoing his pants.
Was he really in a position to judge?
Cepheus shook his head. "This is fine."
fickle. They could turn on the Winchesters at a moment's notice. He held his ground and kept his head high.
Dean glanced up at his master. He wasn't sure if this was a play date or if his master was getting rid of him. His master reached down and unclipped his leash but left his collar on.
His father bent down and sniffed at him. "You smell like someone else."
Dean took his bowl and went over to his couch. It was practically doll furniture in comparison to his master but it fit him well enough.
He wasn't going to make that mistake twice. When he went to bed tonight he'd crawl into his master's bed, no matter how he felt about bath time.
"It belongs to Michael's older brother." His grandmother said. "Now be quiet and learn."
Gabriel made a disgusted noise and waved his hand at the cart and their family. "Look where our pride got us? Look what our pride did to Cassie." He shook his head and went back to the front of the cart. He picked up the arm and motioned for Anna to do the same. He heaved the cart forward; dragging all their worries with him.
Castiel added
Castiel's back arched up. A warm electric feeling spread through his body. It was like coming but different. It lit his whole body up instead of just his cock.
His grandmother sighed. "Do you know what it means to be a siren?"
"Good Dean. Good pet," Castiel cooed. He bumped his mating tail against Dean's lips again. "Lick."
He wiped at himself furiously but Dean's come kept leaking out. He swore when he realized how dark it was getting. He pulled on his pants. He'd have to walk home with Dean's come still dripping out of him.
"For filth," Castiel chuckled. He picked grass, dirt, and a spider from Dean's hair. "And horrible hairy creatures."
, John Winchester, to a fate worse than my own!"
"You were spying on my cousin?" Castiel teased. He trailed his fingers up and down Dean's back. "Did they catch you?"
Castiel sighed and clipped Dean's collar and leash on. He tied the leash off to the counter. For a short while Dean had been good about being bathed but lately he wouldn't sit still.
The village might hiss
Michael held the door for them. It was the first time Castiel had seen anyone act like a Blackdog was an honoured guest. Castiel stepped inside and blanched at the decadence of the Goodson house. From the outside the Goodson house was modest and well-kept like every other house on the street but inside it was a palace.
He came to a sudden stop in the hallway. It occurred to him that he had never actually asked if Dean had reached sexual maturity or was too old to be fertile. He didn't even know if Dean was sexually intact. He hadn't thought to ask. He'd never had any intention of breeding humans and he didn't have a second one to worry about.
Castiel nodded as he adjusted his shirt. He combed his fingers through his hair, checking for any stray carrot.
harming his pet to just wrap his mating tail around him for a little bit. If Dean didn't like it or was being hurt he knew the human wasn't afraid to bite him in retaliation. The swelling in his mating tail from a bite would be his own fault if it happened.
"Yes. Very good," Castiel cooed. He gave Dean a few scritches just under his ear. "You're quite a smart little pet, aren't you?"
His grandmother chuckled at the look on his face. "It'll pass soon. Another day or two." She eyed the wet patch on his pants. "You should drink some water."
For as old as she was it never surprised Castiel how observant his grandmother was.
Dean pushed at his mating tail again and chattered. He looked pointedly at the bowl in Castiel's hand. He pushed Castiel's mating tail towards the bowl.
"Uh, well," Dean stammered. "You, I thought..."
He dressed silently. Every shift of his legs made him wince. He hobbled over to the cooling rack on shaking legs and took the two largest loafs. They didn't fit into his satchel. He wrapped them up in his cloak and limped home.
His eyebrows knitted together in embarrassed concern. Was this Dean's come? His own come didn't look anything like this and there wasn't nearly as much. What was wrong with him? Or was something wrong with Dean?
He dragged it over to his master, braving the dagger tail, and reached up to tap him on the hip.
His head kept playing Dean licking his hand over and over and how close his mating tail had come to Dean's mouth in the past. He could feel the scales of his back try to rise up again. He twisted in bed and pushed them back down. His mating tail twitched. He wrapped it tightly around his bladed tail.
"What did he do to you?" his grandmother asked bluntly.
They crept through back alleys and only dared to use main streets when there was little other choice. Castiel could hear the sounds of a mob rumbling over the rooftops. Whatever had happened the priest had managed to rouse most of the village.
Castiel's grandmother nodded. "Alright then." She waved a hand at Castiel. "Put our things out then tell Michael Goodson we need water that's been boiled."
His master turned around and froze when he saw Dean playing with the ball. Dean tensed up. He was doing something wrong. He just knew it. He reached out and carefully put the ball back. Maybe they weren't for him after all.
He rolled the ball up his arm and popped it off his elbow then caught it. He grabbed two more from the box and tried out juggling. He couldn't do it but his master seemed particularly pleased. The only thing his master liked more was when he tried balancing a ball on his nose.
"What do
Castiel bit his lips, hesitating. His grandmother and Gabriel had managed to be even
It was the feeling of an imminent orgasm that woke him up. He snapped his eyes open. The dream of perfect mates didn't fade. He sat up to find his mating tail wrapped around Dean and the human nuzzling his face against it, nosing at the sensitive opening that had unfurled in his sleep.
"Speak the truth, Castiel
He grabbed his own cock with his other hand and started pumping as he thrust the wooden cock in and out of his hole.
time to play with other humans on occasion. Maybe it would help in the future.
Brianne Shields dashed away with her babies. Castiel half expected the priest to stride forward and slap him across the brand on his cheek, to sneer
The human sat up alert and stared at her intently.
Brianne whispered her thanks.
"We're sorting it out ourselves." His grandmother snapped. "Shove off."
Castiel reached out and slung his arms around Dean. He tugged him closer and leaned back into the grass. He pulled Dean down on top of him.
unless he had taught it to them. "Holy shit! You can speak English!"
"You can take your pick of the loaves on the cooling rack after." Daven said. He angled his hips. His cock pressed against Castiel's hole. "If you're good you can have two."
I realized, writing this, that there is no non-human-centric word for anthropomorphize. The best I could come up with was civilize and event hat sounds awkward.
in the kitchen. But his master never bothered to find him.
know?" Castiel repeated. He smiled cruelly at her. "I'm a whore, Mary." He reached up to brush his fingers delicately over edges of the W branded on his cheek. "I've been on my back for so many men and alphas..." He shrugged. "How could I possibly know which one had the honour?"
And besides, his master wanted it this way. A good pet did what their master wanted or risked being abandoned, spaced, locked away and forgotten, or
"I meant it." His grandmother said.
He walked through the doorway, shoulders tense, and only breathed in relief when he reached the other side. The door sliced back up into place behind him. Dean shivered. He didn't know how the doors knew not to chop him in half.
his pet sadly pace down corridors was even worse.
What if his master was dead? He'd be trapped in the ship until he died with him.
The baker took the other loaf down and placed it on the counter. He named his price. Castiel looked at him disgusted. That price would be higher than what even the priest could afford.
Gabriel darted forward and snatched it off her. He tossed it aside.
"You want me to
"What did it say?" Castiel pulled the baby's basket closer to himself. What if his mother didn't want something but rather, wanted to get rid of something? What if she'd come home but only if they left Deidre out in the woods for the fairies?
His master reached out with his second tail and pushed something on the nearby wall. Dean watched and wondered just how many buttons and signs were scattered throughout the ship that he couldn't even see.
Dean snuffled in his sleep. Castiel draped his bladed tail over Dean. Dean sighed and snuggled closer. Castiel snorted in amusement. How had he been afraid of his own pet? His little speckled human was anything
Dean huffed. "Yeah. Great."
The baker put his hands to his ears and yelled back. "Take him outside!"
Castiel opened his mouth to ask what his grandmother meant but the question died on his lips. He knew. His father had abandoned them and now his mother had too.
His master crawled into bed. He tapped the wall above the top of the bed. The light dimmed to near absolute darkness.
Castiel hesitated. He knew Dean would act up if he watched other pets being fed but he couldn't risk Dean trying to grab at his mating tail in front of someone.
A second later he felt himself get lighter. The ship was syncing up with the gravity on another ship or a station.
Castiel thrust up again. Dean rocked his hips down. Castiel could feel a mess of pre-come starting to form on their bellies. He groaned at the slide of cocks over his stomach. He hadn't thought it'd be like this either. His skin sparked at Dean's touch, his cock ached to be held, his heart pounded in his chest, and a fire burned deep in his gut.
"I know how," Castiel said. He reached out and curled his hand around Dean's hip. He dragged his hand along Dean's stomach and stopped in the middle. "You've touched yourself before?"
He took a left and headed for a cargo hold that had been giving his master trouble since day one. Whatever was in the non-descript yellow boxes in that hold seemed to shift around and move on its own. His master was forever rearranging them and tying them back down. Dean didn't want to know what was inside.
Castiel picked up the tooth brush with his mating tail. It was too delicate for his claws to grasp. He let Dean see the brush well before he brought it to Dean's mouth.
People still stared at him.
A series of hisses and clicks of claws made him pick up his pace. His master was calling him. He jogged down the rows of crates, careful to avoid stepping on or in anything on the floor. Not for the first time he wished he
"Get me clean water and cloths and the kitchen salve." His grandmother commended.
He wandered the corridors and called out for his master but didn't hear any of his master's hisses or clicks. His master was probably deep in one of the cargo holds again. If he wanted breakfast he'd have to find him. Which meant wandering around looking for doors.
"Gabriel." His grandmother said. She nodded at the water and food set aside. "Make sure he drinks at least."
"Yes! Don't stop! God, Dean, don't stop!" Castiel grabbed Dean's face and kissed him. He dragged his tongue over Dean's lips and down his jaw until he was mouthing at Dean's neck. "Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop."
If it hadn't made his master so angry Dean would have thought it was funny. It reminded him of a tv show he had watched as a kid; something about a blue, maybe purple, giant lizard that wanted to teach kids about sharing.
"No." Castiel relaxed his stance. "But my therapist suggested I get a companion animal."
Dean frowned to himself. He looked up and down the corridor. He thought it was the right one but all the corridors looked the same. He thought over the map in his head. He was almost certain it was the right corridor but he had never gone from the bathroom to the cargo hold before. He must have gotten turned around. Normally he would be coming from his master's bedroom.
His grandmother fixed her cloak and started the walk home without so much as a backward glance. Castiel caught up to her in three quick strides, his anger resurfacing. Michael Goodson called him a whore and Deidre a bastard and refused to sell rice to them but they had still come when Rachel needed them. They deserved apologies, not a swift shove out the door.
The baby gave a soft cry. Castiel jumped. His grandmother pat his shoulder and told him she'd show how to breast feed again.
"She traded needles." Castiel held the needles up. They didn't need them at the moment but they would eventually, or they could sell them to someone else.
His grandmother swatted his knee. "We talked about this. You stop when I tell you to or you tear open and bleed everywhere."
It laid on the ground and made harsh huffing noises. Castiel waited a moment before helping it upright. It looked up at him with wide eyes then tried to hide behind him. Castiel looked at the door to the ship. He wasn't sure if his new pet had just been startled but the sudden noise of the door opening or if his pet had a fear of loud noises.
He had finally resorted to putting Dean on his leash and tying him off a short distance away from wherever he worked. Dean hadn't liked it at first but Castiel had given him a few puzzle toys designed to keep humans occupied while he absently talked about his work. The combination of activity and his voice seemed to be enough to calm Dean down a little bit.
Castiel cringed and turned his head again.
"To get the bride price. That little thief ruined him. They're going to pay."
He was grateful when Rachel was finally nursing, it gave him a moment to wash up and breathe. He peeled off the layers of clothes that had gotten messy and bundled them up, glad that he wore so many layers in fear of milk leaking out of him. He sat down in a nearby chair. He was exhausted. He hadn't thought being a midwife would be exhausting.
Once he was done his master took the bowl back to clean. Dean sat on the floor beside him and leaned against his master's leg.
The baker groaned in his ear when his cock finally pushed in all the way. "They say sirens are tight but..." He rocked his hips forward and groaned again. "God's tits they never said
He didn't get out more human food, Dean's food was rationed during trips just as his own, but he picked the bowl up and squeezed out a dollop of flavouring paste into it. He handed the bowl to Dean. Dean snatched at the bowl and dropped it. Castiel jerked down and caught it but at the cost of getting flavouring paste all over his claws and fingers. He grimaced but he knew the paste was harmless.
"Sure, dude," Dean laughed. He moved his head in tangent with the rubbing. His master did his own weird giant lizard version of smiling. Dean shot a look up at the counter. "Now how about dinner?"
He kicked his pants off. He didn't have to rub at his hole. He had been loose and slick all day. He reached between his legs and gathered up his slick. He wiped it onto the wooden cock then slid it inside himself with a groan.
No one mentioned it but Gabriel counted their days against their food stores and worried.
Dean retreated to the kitchen. He went to his couch and grabbed his blanket. He wrapped it tightly around himself. He was trapped. He wasn't dying so whatever was going on was happening outside of the kitchen. But then that meant some kind of ship wide emergency was going on outside of the kitchen.
"In a heat, no less!" The priest finished. He turned to Castiel. A hint of a smirk played at the corner of his lips. "And now he bears the fruit of his sin."
he hesitated. When he went to the baker's no one else knew about it but here he'd have to ask Cepheus Redwood which room was Evan's. Cepheus would know. Cepheus would know that what the village hissed at him was true.
The kid tumbled to the floor in front of Dean. She smiled up at him then tugged at his pant leg. "Yellow enjoyment." She laughed hysterically and tugged at his pant leg again. "Door."
He reached home before his family had sat down for breakfast. He put the loaves of bread away then went with Hannah to help her draw water from the stream for the day.
He took off at a run in the opposite direction. If he wasn't currently dying then that meant something bad was going on, on the other side of the door and he didn't want any part in that.
Anna, however, turned and glared before stepping closer to Castiel.
sirens," Dean scoffed.
Castiel could feel the heat before the brand touched his cheek. That breath of a moment before it hit his skin was the longest he'd ever lived. Then the brand pressed against him and pain seared through him. He screamed. His stomach clenched in pain again. Water rushed down his legs. The two men holding him down jumped back. The priest stumbled backwards; yanking the brand with him.
Castiel squirmed on the spot. His skin crawled with desire. He wanted Dean to never stop touching him. He nodded; mouth still open and breathing heavy. He pulled his shirt off his head. He stopped. Dean was staring at him.
He squirmed against his master until he had his face shoved into the one soft spot on his master's belly.
At the time Dean had been sure then that he was going to get punished for whatever it was he had apparently done but his master had disappeared for a bit then come back and pet him. Dean figured he must have squashed the second tail in his sleep or something but that his master had figured out he hadn't meant to hurt him.
His master bumped him and said the command again. Dean sighed. He wasn't the first master to want to hand feed him. He looked at the lump of mush on his master's second tail. He guessed it wasn't as bad as that master that had wanted to toss him bits of kibble and watch him catch it with his mouth.
Gabriel's laughing quieted down. He squeezed Castiel's shoulder. "What was Kali going to talk to the elders about?"
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and pushed as hard as he could. He screamed and swore as the head finally pushed free. He pushed again and then his grandmother was shoving a squalling baby into his arms.
"What's gotten into you?" Dean asked, leaning into his master as he fastened the collar around his neck. "Not that I'm complaining."
No one mentioned their bad luck at the market as they unpacked the cart at home. No one mentioned it when they ate the last of the bread. No one mentioned it when they came home the next day, exhausted from collecting plants.
Castiel bent his head up and pressed a kiss to Dean's lips. He laid his head back down in the grass. Dean turned and stared at him at him in wide-eyed shock.
Castiel marched himself to the bathroom to clean the warming sheath and wash up. He skipped filing the paperwork to dock at the next station in favour of searching personal ads. He needed to find
He mixed it up and gave the bowl to Dean. Dean swallowed it down so fast Castiel was concerned about him choking. But as soon as Dean was done he started eyeing the tube of flavouring paste.
His grandmother and Gabriel had been arguing about this for months. Castiel's mother had refused to help, the girls were too young, Kali was away on business, and none of the other women in the village would come near their home. Gabriel was the only person able and willing to help.
Gabriel groaned. "Great, now I have to share."
excited before.
Castiel hissed as he sat down for breakfast. He shifted on his seat but couldn't ease the pain. He leaned to his side. A bolt of pain shot through him making him flinch.
Evan sat back and chuckled. "Ready?"
"If you see him, tell him I'll be waiting in his room," Castiel said. The words felt like weights in his gut but each one came with a thrill of excitement. He could trade for coins instead of bread. He could put them aside for another day. They could live beyond one week.
Kali rolled her eyes and peeled Gabriel's hands from her waist. "We aren't married yet."
They laughed again. Castiel hurried away cursing Sam Winchester.
He crawled back onto the bed and waited.
It always unsettled him to walk into the village alone now. The people he'd meet on the road would always stare at the brand on his cheek. It wasn't much better in the village but there was usually something to distract people or he could always turn down another street. On the road there was nothing more interesting than him.
A huge clawed hand wrapped around his head. Dean yelped. The tip of a single claw pushed into his mouth and lodged between his teeth. Dean froze. Those claws were like razors. He looked up at his master pleadingly.
Deidre's hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of his hair. She yanked hard. Castiel yelped and grabbed for her hand. He tugged his hair from her grip. A few strands of hair stayed behind in her chubby fingers. His grandmother laughed and told him he'd miss that too.
"Yep," Dean agreed. "I'm a hell of a lot better when you actually remember to feed me."
The employee clicked in agreement. "Humans
"Shut up." Castiel snapped.
Castiel reached over and pulled Dean into his lap. Maybe Dean hadn't understood the command because he associated it with being in his lap.
Castiel reached down and pet Dean's head. It was a soothing ritual all things said. His therapist was right. He needed touch. And a pet was the exact kind of low key touch he needed.
He turned back around and unclipped Dean from the leash and collar. He picked up his pet and carried him to the bedroom.
