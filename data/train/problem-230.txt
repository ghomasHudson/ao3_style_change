to do it, right?”
“Crosswords puzzle?” John asked with a smirk. The look it earned him from his flatmate said all he had anticipated. “I wouldn't say so, no.”
John immediately retrieved his teeth. They morphed back into the normal set Sherlock was accustomed to seeing in a human being. “Careful!” John's concerned voice rang through his ears and the mug was out of his hands before the trick played out in front of his eyes had even sunk in.
“So, now you do know. What do you want Mycroft?” John watched the tall man as he hung the black umbrella over his forearm by the handle. Their voices rang in echoes through the silent hall. Drama seemed to earn the Holmes' trademark.
John scoffed an unhappy laugh. “
“You forget that I am your family.” Sherlock replied and emptied his mug in the sink, setting it down after. “I'll be in my bedroom.” he simply said and left for said direction. John knew he meant that this was an invitation to knock whenever he was ready to either talk or to just drop the topic and he was grateful for it. He was grateful for Sherlock in general. No, he wasn't very good with handling emotions, neither his own nor anyone else's, but, like John, he was by no means incapable of being sensitive. He just saved that for the important people. John knew how much of a chore it could be to let someone in or to just open up to them, which made him only more thankful to have Sherlock do it for him. He felt privileged in a way that no other could make him feel and it meant the world to him.
“It's nearly 11am, I thought I might tempt you with a bite now.” Sherlock said, mild amusement on his face.
“What has this to do with us?” Sherlock enquired, impatient.
They'd spent the following evenings together on the couch, watching telly, cuddled up, until they didn't look at the screen any more.
A shave and a splash of water later, John felt fresh. Fresh and clear and ready. They would leave Baker Street and try to find other people. He couldn't continue sitting around, waiting for some quirk of luck to turn the world back around. Someone else must have survived until now; someone must still be out there.
He vaguely felt the mattress dip beside him before a pair of strong hands shook him into consciousness. John yawned heartily before looking up and over at Sherlock. “ Mornin'.” he greeted sleepily. He certainly felt better now than when he'd fallen asleep and Sherlock seemed fine as well. Maybe this was a plan that could actually work out fine.
“Yes. Whenever have we made it to bed when we weren't already in it?” Holmes leaned his forehead against Watson's, his lips split in a smile so big, it was a rare sight even to his friend.
John wasn't an expert on the area, but that was some very good wine!
“But what about her? The baby?”
The arrogance in those words still rang through John's head. It had been only a month after he'd got to know Mycroft Holmes and it was now another two months since. It always shocked him how well he'd settled in with Sherlock within just a few weeks and now he felt like there was nothing more natural. It was true that John had shared many flats and even more beds, but nothing had ever felt as easy as his friendship to Sherlock Holmes. Just their first night together had been a right spectacle, with a rush of Adrenalin that had John feel alive for the first time in a long while. Afghanistan had been nice – a suicide mission, but an adventure nonetheless. He'd planned to die there and he nearly had, only when he'd looked that prospect in the eye, he found his desire for death vanish very effectively. If you were “one of his kind” as Mycroft called them, death meant a part of yourself and, with the feeling of eternity on your shoulder, boredom came quick and was not lifted off your being quite that easily.
John sighed. He'd kind of expected that. “Well- just-... look.” he concluded, pulling back his lips to give Sherlock an unhindered view of his teeth. The brunet focused on them with both intrigue and nonchalance, only to spit out his sip of tea when said teeth quickly shot out to become two rows of long, very sharp-looking spikes. It was only the incisors and canines, but enough to have Sherlock clumsily splash more hot tea onto himself from his mug as he tried to dab away at his chin and lips.
One more update later tonight (or possibly tomorrow morning, depending on how long we'll take to eat and tidy up again), which is going to be the second chapter to my kidlock Christmas fic :)
As he handed it to her, a spitefulness inside her surfaced. “Isn't that nice for you.”
John sighed. “It's not that easy. There's a lot of paper work and inspections and it takes a long time until we are allowed to take a new one in.”
“Actually I'm surprised how easy I find it to trust you with mine..”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him in challenge. “Then I'll cut it open. Although I am fairly sure that I'd lose a lot more blood that way.” For demonstration, he moved to get up.
he did it, but we still have nothing on who it was..”
“You think so? I don't recall having met any of my girlfriends through you.”
At this, Sherlock frowned at him as if he were a particularly stupid new specimen. As if he wanted to say “have you seen me?!”, but without actually uttering the words.
John was sitting in front of a startled Sherlock, who, after fully coming back to reality, drew his eyebrows together in question.
“What do you think
The man smiled, but there was a twinkle in his eye. “You have a strange way of showing gratitude. And what is that tone of voice?”
“Really, John. You have very limited capacity, you shouldn't waste the space by filling it with trivia and the likes.”
The edge of Sherlock's lip curled up in a satisfied smile. Lestrade wasn't quite as pleased. “So we know
“Of course, that would explain your general incompetence with modern technology.” Sherlock remarked, taking on tea from him to put some sugar in it.
Sherlock would mostly lay in John's arms, snuggling back against him. Not because John was the dominant party, but because it comforted him, made him feel safe and secure. In John's arms, he was free from accusations and prejudices. In John's arms, he felt at peace.
John stopped looking around and up at the younger man. All this humming and hawing, that was nothing like Sherlock. “So.. why are you not just, you know, going away?” John teased.
The blond's chuckle was silly in its innocence and sweetness. “No. You were... unexpected. You know we can't be together like that, right?”
John, hand on the banister, sighed deeply, not ready to stand right in the middle of the storm. “Can we do this tomorrow? I'm tired, I just want to sleep right now.”
“Anything the matter, John?”
Sherlock reached out with one arm, letting his hand glide down John's arm as he finished painting a skull on his son's face. “There. Go, put on your shoes and your jacket.”
“So you keep saying, yes.” At that moment, he was no doubt mulling over all our exchanges, my little remarks and those times where I did not think to take care in my choice of words. “Come to think of it, I have not once heard you compliment a woman's appearance in words not cited from another's mouth!”
Then, I could not even stay sitting across from him. My excitement forced me onto my legs and I paced for a minute or two. Never had I allowed myself to trust a man like I did my dear Watson and yet there were things strangers knew that I had never dared to tell him. In this one moment, it felt like I had betrayed his trust, but I knew it was a mere fancy of mine. He understood why I had kept it a secret. It was not because I did not trust him. It was out of pure fear. “You are correct.” I finally found the courage to admit. I still dared not to set my eyes upon him, scared that I may reveal more than I intended, but I could sense his own body humming with anticipation, the confirmation to his theory so close to his grasp. But he said nothing. He waited for me to share my part and I was and am grateful for that. I would scoff time and again at my own hesitation and how I took a breath for several seconds before uttering the sentence, “I am a homosexual.” At once, my attention was drawn back to the face of the man who had given me room to admit this. I felt a strange kind of relief, especially as I saw that his face carried no judgement.
None of the respectable papers told of such an incident. A prank? The attempt to raise attention to smaller and less respected publishers?
He was avoiding eye-contact. These conversations had never been easy for either of them. “You didn't. You were angry and you forgave me.”
They sat up, each picking at the other's waistcoats, neckties, pushing aside braces, unbuttoning shirts and finally pulling their vests off, hardly ever breaking contact between their mouths. So they sat, half naked, Watson nearly in Holmes' lap, with his legs bracing Holmes' hips in a now less comfortable manner. Holmes' slender fingers slid across his chest, playing with his hair there like a delicate instrument. He himself travelled with his fingertips down Holmes' abdomen, slotting behind the rim of his trousers and wandering them to where they could unfasten them. A luxurious sigh sounded through Watson and into the kiss when his partner, in response, reached for his crotch, massaging the sensitive flesh through layers of fabric.
“No, yes of course, I want to. I'm just.. surprised. You know you don't have to do this kind of stuff, right?”
“Mh, that's why we're going with him.” John answered, stepping up to Sherlock and placing his arms around the taller man's hips. “He's so delicate.. there's no way I'm letting him walk around alone!”
With a jolt he sat upright, looking around him until he found John, sitting not far from him, a smile growing across his lips. “I must apologise. We were getting too close. I wanted to see you safe back home and it was easiest to have you out for the time it took us here.”
Fact, however, was, that they were chasing Efkan Cetin through London by the end of the day, having just surprised him before he'd managed to kill his fourth victim. Unfortunately, the chase ended with John pulling Sherlock out of the Thames, but he'd informed Greg about their killer swimming downstream so they would be catching him along the way.
“Breakfast first, love. We can go through the presents together afterwards, hm?”John suggested gently, waiting for Hamish to accept.
His brother straightened himself and released a sigh of disappointment “What dear John is so clearly afraid of is an old story. To sum it up, it tells of a curse that was once laid upon a family of English sailors. In their travels they came across a sea witch with a long-held grudge against humans. She cursed them, making them what you see in John now.”
“Plenty of sunken ships and treasures on the bottom of the sea. Not yours, I'm afraid, but better than nothing, yes?” The way his head was cocked just that bit to the side, the friendly glimmer in his eyes. Sherlock reached out and touched his cheek. John was so handsome in his own way, even though conventional beauty seemed to escape his weathered features. John set down the bag on Sherlock's stomach. It sounded and felt like coins. “I can always swim back there and get more.”
John's fingertips glid up and down Sherlock's back. “Inside. Seventeen.”
The dare in both of them was almost tangible in the air around them. “Well, what are you waiting for, then? Being a chicken?!”
John stopped in his movements as Sherlock drew his eyebrows together at his stunned look.
Unfortunately, Mycroft didn't know what had been the cause of all this either, but he informed they were aware, that this was a world-wide affair and, according to him, America had a far worse time; not that there should be a competition to being taken over by the most undead – it was promising to be the same result: death.
The brunet leaned back in his armchair with amusement written across his face. “Shouldn't go swimming in the Thames at this time of the year.” he advised.
adventures.”
Sherlock noticed, of course, he noticed, John thought. The most observant man on the planet was hardly going to miss the way John’s breath quickened, or the way he had to swallow away the saliva that pooled in his mouth. So the problem became, what to do about it. Ignoring it, wasn’t working. Like a rubber band that was given an extra couple of turns each day, the gradual escalation of tension was beyond painful, and no amount of furtive wanking was solving the problem.
Sherlock stood, meeting John’s anger with frustration, “Then I don’t see what the problem is!”
Sherlock blushed as he felt himself pulse within John again and his mate shivered, “I hadn’t.”
“Has it fixed the bowl?”
Sherlock’s arse was already glistening with lubrication, his cheeks already starting to gape as his dark hole beginning the process of natural dilation in readiness for an Alpha, “Fuck, Sherlock, you’re the perfect Omega, laying there waiting for me.”
“Mmmmm, huge,” Sherlock moaned.
The words tasted vile as he forced them out, but a drunken shag with John was a recipe for disaster, “No. I think it would be best if you went alone.”
“Go to bed, John. You’ve had enough.” Sherlock said the firm words laced with gentle care.
“Hey, I'm not your mother!” John reminded jokingly.
A couple of floors and many dead bodies later, they had cleared the building, five new guns and many rounds of ammo at hand. They decided to call it a day, settling down in Greg's old office, where John sporadically prepared a meal for them.
And he'd felt bad about getting them thrown out of the group like that. He hadn't meant to, not with John having it had set as a goal to find and stick with other people, Sherlock told him quietly from where his head rested on John's thighs. The older man caressed his head and told him he didn't mind.
Sherlock wouldn't have thought so either.
John nodded at the obviousness, not quite getting why Sherlock was making this such a big deal as he was aware; had been aware for a long time. “Yeah. Alright.” he said in irritation. His next thought left him stumbling, feeling awkward to discuss such matters so early in their not-yet-relationship. Still, it was important to be clear on all terms to avoid unexpected conflict. “It's still okay for you though, if I... I mean,
“I'm a pirate!” the blond said proudly, chin raised as he pulled out his plastic sword in victorious manner.
As soon as he had John resting against the headboard, face pinched up in pain, he thrust his arm at him pressing it against John's lips. “Bite me!” John protested with a low growl, trying to turn his head away. “Come on, John, you need to drink!”
“Chinese, I should think.” Sherlock replied, mind already a little absent again, as he had stuff to think about and John being out of the flat was the best condition under which to do so. Until he did something unexpected; something
“No. No, of course not.. I mean, it's stupid and a romantic ideology, really..”
One night, about three months in, Sherlock hadn't left the sofa by the time John had finished his routine. He lay there, on his belly, staring at some unidentifiable spot on the floor. John told him he wanted to drop now, but instead of leaving the cushions, Sherlock rolled unto his side, his back pressed against the back of the furniture as if in invitation for John to take the free space, eyes still fixed on nothing. And despite knowing how awkward it was and how many lines he'd be crossing, John lay down next to him, his back to the other man, naturally. Even as he thought it, John couldn't help but notice how incredibly lonely he felt, how much he craved closeness and human touch. It felt bad to use Sherlock like this, but, even though John knew the man didn't view things that way, the younger seemed to feel similar, if he was willing to share such a small space with him. Three months. Three months without contact to the outside world, a bit over two of them without any social contact beside each other whatsoever and they rarely talked, still. So now, cuddling up with Sherlock seemed more comforting than unsettling. Everyone thought them gay already and now no one was around any more, so what did it matter anyway. Right now he was good with just feeling that he wasn't alone in this. All this madness and he didn't have to go through it alone – good enough for him.
With a pang in his chest, he felt very guilty for what had happened the previous night. He hadn't planned it, of course, and neither had he intended to, but he now felt like he'd used the younger man. He reckoned it'd been simply because he had felt so lonely, still did, and if he was honest, he wasn't quite used to living in celibacy. It had been a slip. The kissing was just a bit of romance he liked. Sherlock surely understood. No, he was Sherlock, how would he understand.. Surely he didn't think anything of it. Anyway, he had made it more than clear that he wasn't interested in that sort of interaction and his reaction to John's advances had confirmed that.
“Then why didn't you account for it? Why did you still marry him?”
“What did you mean, 'read a book'.” Sherlock interrupted as he sat up, his feet planted on the stone.
“Hm, I seem fine.” the detective argued, sipping at his coffee again.
“One?”
He drank slowly, taking his time and being extra neat with giving as little of his saliva into Sherlock's bloodstream. Sucking at the flesh, Sherlock moaned a little and his arms circled his head and shoulders without causing the wound to shift away from John's mouth. John, likewise, slung an arm around Sherlock's waist, grabbing the one he was drinking from with his free hand and supporting it gently.
Sympathy fell on her face and she patted his hand. “Oh, my boy, I am so sorry. Who would have done that?”
He eventually pulled away, licked the limb clean in one swipe of his tongue and cleaned his own lips as well before speaking again. “I should be cooking lunch. We still need to eat.”
Yes, he could have done without Sarah getting into this kind of trouble, but she'd gone with it. All of it. From Sherlock's rude behaviour to almost dying and she still wanted to see John.
“Yes, I have. I am positively famished after my day at the practice. The recent outbreak of the flu is keeping me on my feet, I have not had a proper break.” His hand came up to caress his friend's cheek. “I have it come up around eight tonight.”
“No, but you can make one!” Hamish piped in, looking at them with wide, happy eyes, like he wanted them to do that right now so he could have his companion right now.
“Mh, cheers.” John replied with mild amusement.
“Nobody gives me orders. At least nobody that need concern you. I haven't come to harm; only to help. After a storm like that last, we always come up to seek out survivors. Fortunate I found you when I did. You seemed out cold, like your men. I had nearly given up hope.”
I hope you liked that bit of fluff. I sure did :3
The following 5 hours were spent on the bed together. Sherlock had brought John his laptop and the brunet sat next to him, tapping away at his mobile, clearly ordering Greg around to get the last of the gang they'd been following and who'd shot John in the end. When he was done with that, he just retreated into his mind palace, laying there, in silence, like a dead man.
“Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.” Sherlock exhaled. “A woman of her height and build? He must be rather strong to lift and hang her up like this. Also at least as tall as she is, as the only thing he could have stepped on in this room was that stool laying on the floor because the only dents in the carpet are those of said stool and that is barely high enough for her to have stood on and touched the ceiling. It must also be someone with particular knowledge of this part of the city. How else would he have know about this unused room
For a brief second, there was a tinge of disappointment in Sherlock's eyes, but, as always, it didn't hold on for long. “Alright. See you later.” he replied, leaning down to peck John's cheek while pulling his gloves on.
was real! And if neighbouring countries had been affected with their borders closed, who could guarantee it hadn't reached England yet? Some travellers bringing it in? Something in the water? The air? Birds? There were more possibilities than John wanted to think of.
“Have you ever turned anyone?” Sherlock asked, curiously.
“Mycwoft feigns disintewest in sweets because Mummy always looks at him with that mingwing fear he might go back to being fat again, but later, when he checks my sweets, he'll steal some, ashuming I won't notice.” Sherlock informed innocently and Mycroft took a deep, calming breath as the woman's eyes widened and her face flushed with her feeling inappropriate.
“Are you sure you're fine?” Sherlock's question was not a doubt of John's judgement, but rather of the possible misplacement of his pride.
Meanwhile John handed Sherlock a little box, in which lay an anklet. Sherlock twisted and turned the simple silver chain around, reading the plate with their names and the date they got together on it.
Sherlock pressed his arm against him more forcefully, trapping John head painfully against the wooden headboard. The blond shoved at it with his own hands. “I need too much! It'll kill you or turn you!” he protested.
“Anything?” Sherlock asked taking a sip of his coffee.
“That really wasn't a surprise.” Mary replied, her face looking something like sad resignation.
The elder Holmes brother looked down at him, bright blue eyes over the crooked nose. John had long understood that Mycroft had a certain fondness for him. Just like Sherlock, he seemed to enjoy his wits, thickheadedness and, most of all, his loyalty towards the younger one.
Only a force much fiercer, much less forgiving crossed their path. If Sherlock believed in luck, he would call this journey the most unlucky they have had. The English ship they came across overpowered them easily, in their weakened state and he watched his men be slaughtered and drowned. With a nasty trip in his step, he fell backwards over the lip of his own ship. He landed flat and his vision swam before it went black.
(See the end of the chapter for
A week into their new relationship, Sherlock has been rather open to explore the basics. Not that John would be surprised. But at least, he was flattered.
“For a pregnant woman you don't put a lot of effort into keeping calm.”
At some point, they heard guns being fired in the distance and made their way in that direction as quickly and undetected as possible.
“I didn't.” Sherlock replied in mild disgust, as John raised the palette of greasy colours to their son's face.
Sherlock was about to address John, already having forgotten Mary was to come around, but he recognised her perfume as he climbed the stairs. His gaze lingered on her for a moment, aware that she was cross with him most of all. He had no opinion on her, really, just facts. “Turns out the case wasn't half as interesting as Lestrade made it sound. He really needs to get a hold on his enthusiasm.” he informed off-handedly, taking off his coat and rounding Mary, to drop a kiss on John's head and diving straight for the kitchen to make himself some tea.
“I can't make that commitment. Not now, not ever.”
John regarded him with an exasperated look, sighing in resignation. It caught Sherlock's attention and the human sank to his knees in front of him. His hand cupped John's cheek again and he didn't care to hide his pleading look. “Not yet.” John said firmly. “Let's wait and see how well we work together over a longer period of time.” He budged up close to whisper into Sherlock's ear the sentiment to intimate to him to share with anyone but Sherlock. “I want to build something with you, not dive head over heels into cold water.”
Sherlock smirked back a little, but his amusement quickly fell again. “I read,” Sherlock continued, effectively pulling John away from his memories, “you fear garlic and have no reflection?”
The brunet shifted closer, his lips right by John's ear as he whispered “because,” his hand skimmed along an angled jaw, then down his throat, taking note of the strong heartbeat fluttering just below the skin, “you fancy me.”
He did take some time to cool down, not wanting to put Sherlock under any more pressure than necessary. He'd already fuck up plenty with him today and wasn't keen on pushing his luck with a man who wasn't known for his patience.
And there John had him. Mycroft's eyes softened ever so slightly into the gaze he'd come to know as the Holmes' fondness. “Indeed I do.”
“You seem incredibly confident with your theory, John.”
“Tea?” He indicated the mug with a look and Sherlock sat up, taking it from John's offering hand.
They carried out their routine as usual. No word about it fell all day. In the evening they ate, paying close to no attention to each other, just like the last months. After dinner he got up, took care of the dishes and went to the bathroom. In a moment of rare motivation, he reached for his razor.
“Twick or tweat!” Sherlock sang cheerily and the woman grabbed two handfuls out of her bowl, cooing softly at the young child at Mycroft's hand as she put the sweets in his bag.
Sherlock, remembering and blushing with a mild shame, pulled his legs to his chest. “So you wish not to see me again? Or is it not possible either way?”
It was an honest, serious question. There might be no way back. Sherlock nodded without hesitation.
Maybe it was because Sherlock was doing this voluntarily, his blood wasn't flooded with adrenalin and other hormones that marked the fear of a victim, but he definitely tasted a lot better than any of the others that John had taken advantage of. Drinking from Sherlock like this felt, in fact, nearly ecstatic and he felt his eyes fall closed.
“Sex.”
“Can it be used as a murder weapon?” Sherlock asked, humming at John's touch.
“But how did the murderer get out? The door was locked from the inside.”
The look Mary gave John said more than he cared, but he knew Sherlock hadn't actively antagonised her; he just didn't know better. And he liked routines like that.
John folded his arms on the ground and laid his chin atop them. “I have experiences.” he confirmed before elaborating. “I used to travel a lot. I have been with women from three different oceans.” He held up three fingers like Sherlock wouldn't believe him otherwise.
was welcome to lighten up his mood. He'd not expected that the brunet's trip to the bank would be to get involved in a case of theft, smuggling and murder and, sad as it was for young Soo Lin Yao, John could only say that it'd been brilliant.
“But I want to be a piwiiiite!” Sherlock cried, stomping his feet and throwing his arms in petulance.
And just how much he cared was to become clear to John at the pool.
“Are you crazy?!” John yelled at Sherlock, who was laying on his back on the moody river bank. John looked at his pale skin a blue-tinged lips.
Most people were certain such creatures did not exist. Sherlock Holmes was one of them.
“I can't kiss you, Sherlock, can you not understand that?”
Occasionally, John had to actually look up from where he was writing up the case on his blog and held his fingertips under Sherlock's nose to see if he was really still breathing. Almost like clockwork, Sherlock came back six hours and five minutes after the last feeding and, checking the time on his mobile, moved John's laptop out of the way and offered his left arm again. John didn't want to reopen the last wounds now either, seeing as they were healing rather well and he wanted to prevent scarring where he could, so his eyes wandered up the limb. He took a sad note of the inside of Sherlock's elbow, many little scars from needles leaving reminders of the past. It wasn't a past John shared, though, so he moved on without a word. He bit Sherlock's upper arm this time, making sure he didn't harm either of the two muscles there.
“I'm not entirely sure I can believe this, but the evidence of your teeth is a little.. hard to contradict. And all this detail.. You couldn't have thought it all up within a day.”
“Which is what tells us about her habit of chewing gum, yes. She had a strong jar and could hold herself up for quite a while. In the end, it was likely the pain that made her let go, not the exhaustion. And once she'd let go, she couldn't go back.”
Deep in the pocket of Sherlock's tatty clothes, discarded after his rescue from Serbia, Anthea finds a handwritten note.
“I keep dreaming you’re there, with me,” now his desire was unmasked, Sherlock seemed more willing to admit the magnitude of the truth.
“Sorry, I should have said yesterday when I arrived, Mary told our friends that I’ll be helping you with an investigation all week,” he paused and then added with less assurance, “is that alright?”
“We were in Baskerville in May. You… “ John checked the sheet again, confirming the information, “You can’t have done this, we were in Baskerville.”
“Sorry,” John tensed, embarrassed at the desperate restraint hidden in the noise, “Oh, I’m so sorry, that wasn’t fair of me at all. Touching you with such abandon.”
There are certain words that set John’s hackles on edge, ones that can spell injury and death. Gun….drug…explosions…knives. Rolling Sherlock gently, the severity was clear to see. A long, deep gash ran through the coat, Sherlock’s shirt and through the pale skin of his torso. Within the rapidly spreading blood, John caught a glimpse of ribs and worse.
They lay panting, spooned together, and heedless of the mess covering John both front and back, content to simply catch their breath and rest in the sated bubble of calm that settled around them.
“It’s fine.” I murmured; sleep already tugging me back into its embrace.
“Because I want you more… “ he growled, rutting against John as his hand moved to steady John against his lap.
Sherlock was resting, draped across John’s chest, leg sprawled between John’s, “Small price to pay. I’ll add spinach and pumpkin seeds to the shopping list… and dark chocolate.”
John and Sherlock fell into an uneasy silence, the emotional upheaval of the day catching up with them both. Finally, John nudged Sherlock’s shoulder with his own and murmured, “I meant it, you know… about Rosie.”
With a final hard thrust, Sherlock breached John’s opening with his knot as it swelled and locked, just as John arched with a groan and covered his fingers and John’s chest. As John’s orgasm spasmed around his cock, he felt his own release jerk and fill John, and he desperately clutched at John’s thigh as he shuddered and twitched.
“Alright, this isn’t working for me,” John stood in the doorway, fists clenched at his side and feet solidly planted shoulder-width apart. His tone was frustrated, bordering on angry.
“I need to pop out for a few hours today,” John’s voice was steady, calm and matter-of-fact.
“Rosie,” John mumbled desperately, “take care of Rosie.”
“You’re asking me to stay and share my next heat with you,” Sherlock took a step forward, slipping into the musical cadence of his deductions, “You’re asking me to yield to you, let you claim me, mark me and let you fuck me over and over and… “ he took another step, “over again until our minds and bodies are catatonic with exhaustion and even then, rut together helplessly until our breath is burning in our lungs and we feel our hearts will burst from our chests.“
“What was that?” Her fingers stilled.
“Could what, Sherlock? What are you saying?”
“No, wait, I have more. I knew you hadn’t forgiven me, would never forgive me, so I did what I could to make your marriage a success.” He was almost trembling with barely suppressed emotion now, “I gave you up!” He sat down hard in his chair, finally coming to the end of either his speech or his energy reserves before whispering, “It seems like all I’ve ever done is given you up.”
“Fuck, Sherlock, fuck.”
“Sherlock!” John brought up the arm that wasn’t encumbered with a set of vampire teeth and clocked Sherlock on the side of the head with a balled fist.
“Hey,” John tapped his cheek, “Hey, look at me. We’re OK, yeah. This doesn’t ever have to happen again. Not if you don’t want it to. I know you don’t do… this”
Sherlock approached and without permission lay a flat palm on John’s chest, gently easing him back down onto the fluffy pillow, “John….” His deep voice seemed to unravel every reservations, “Lay back….” The pillows were soft, the sheets warm. One night wouldn’t hurt…..surely, “Rest…..” Sherlock cooed, “You saved my life tonight…..let me tend to you now.”
His eyes meet mine, seeking confirmation and I give a tight-lipped nod. With anyone else, they may take my look as reservation. But John knows me, and sees it as the tightly restrained passion it is.
John turned to look up, eyes wide and skittish, “Yeah,” he glanced down at the case, “I’ll just –“
Oh John, how I wish this letter need not be written.
“Go ahead,” Sherlock’s murmured response rumbled against his skin.
“Again,” John demanded, pressing just the tip against the spongy flesh.
It was bad enough that Sherlock had needed to take him in again, like a stray puppy, after Mary had been taken into custody; the baby that was never his had been fostered out to a better home than they’d ever been able to give her.
It was John’s turn to apologise, “Sorry, old habits I suppose. You’re looking better.” John added noting Sherlock’s colour had lost the unpleasant grey pallor of the alleyway.
“Brilliant,” Sherlock grinned, releasing John to dart to the doors, the click of the lock satisfyingly decisive before Sherlock turned back to where John stood against the kitchen table. To the casual observer, John was calmly unbuttoning his shirt, but Sherlock noted the tremble in his fingers as he fumbled a button through the hole. Stepping close, Sherlock placed his hands on John’s hips, “John.”
**-**
Laying flat on his back, head pressed gently against the curve of Sherlock’s thigh, John turned the three words over, then over again, finding no additional revelation on each subsequent pass. In the end he simply lay there blinking silently in time with Sherlock.
Sherlock paused, nodded and smiled, “No… not really… my area.”
A shudder ran through Sherlock before he whispered “John,” still staring at his knees.
John took in the gentle tinge of sadness in Sherlock’s voice, a window to a soul very few saw.
“Wouldn’t mind,” Sherlock mumbled blearily, drunk with need, “Just fuck me, for God’s sake. I need it.”
“Did you remove the chock from the door?”
“Oh, God.” John exhaled a relieved breath that caught as Sherlock trailed the backs of his fingers across the already damp cotton exposed within John’s flies, “Sherlock… “
The words piqued John’s interest and in spite of his better judgement he whispered, “I never understood what, Sherlock?”
John however had paused on the stairs and, rather than completing his trip, sat quietly, an invisible audience to Sherlock’s monologue.
John hummed in approval and lifted his head, eyes dark and drunk on the power he had over the amazing creature below him, “And that’s why you can have me. “ With a tilt of his head, he brought his exposed neck to Sherlock’s mouth and pressed, hard.
any more.”
Sherlock nodded again and in a tiny voice said, “You never came to me… since your heat, you’ve never asked.”
So this is me, writing a letter to a dead man. Not because you’ll ever read it, but because I need to find a way to stop playing stuff on an endless loop inside my head.
to find my spare clothes still in my wardrobe upstairs,” John gave him a fond but exasperated look as he took his seat and as simply as that, their dynamic was restored. The easy banter and jibes cushioned with the underlying solidity of their friendship, “This looks lovely, Mrs Hudson.”
“But…” John touched a hand to his neck, “I didn’t feel you feed. You bit me, but didn't feed.”
John twitched in response, wiggling his toes under Sherlock’s gentle touch, “But not subtle, it should make its intentions clear.”
The signs of Sherlock’s impending heat were all over the flat. There was a pile of bottled water stacked in the kitchen, endless packets of beef jerky and fruit rollups on the bench and fresh linen and towels strategically placed next to Sherlock’s bed, John’s bed, the sofa and even in the bathroom. John had never been privy to the preparations Sherlock undertook prior to his ‘confinement’ but it was clear that Sherlock intended to celebrate his heat in style. For John’s contribution, there was a large cardboard box next to Sherlock’s bed labelled
Sherlock risked a glance down while John was consumed in watching his own hand on the shiny cloth and confirmed what he already suspected. The tenting of John’s pants was visible even under the camouflaging fabric of his robe and with an unsteady swallow he placed his own palm over John’s and stilled its movement against his chest.
“They would never have been simple,” Sherlock muttered.
John checked the notes again, her name was Justine Miller and she’d been an unremarkable assistant to an equally unremarkable office manager, “Was she important to you in some way, Sherlock?”
“I does help, John,” Sherlock whispered, “It helps to know I’m not alone in this struggle,” John’s breath hushed across his damp knuckles, “and it
He must have made some sort of a noise because John lifted his head and turned sharply toward him, sudden concern in his eyes, “Sherlock?”
With now practiced experience, Sherlock managed to reposition them so they could comfortably catch their breath while they waiting for Sherlock’s knot to release them. He raised a shaky hand to wipe a bead of sweat that was threatening to roll into John’s eye and John grabbed at it before he could pull away, placing a tender kiss on his fingertips.
“Shower, and then,” he looked firmly at Sherlock, “I need to go out… and do… stuff.”
“Bad day?” came the question from the kitchen, and John hadn’t even had the energy to grunt in reply.
For a sickening moment, John thought he’d overstepped the mark and offended Sherlock until the voice in his ear whispered, “As much as this pains me to say this, John, No.” Sherlock held his fingers gently, “Sore, John, remember? Try up here instead.”
Sherlock knelt by the body and silently put the pieces together in his head.
The conversation was interrupted by a frazzled looking Lestrade, who was attempting to manage the entire scene single-handed. He checked on them and once he’d assured himself they were alright, began to move away when Sherlock quietly asked him to check on Mycroft.
A secret man with a secret want
John remained crouched, looming over Sherlock’s prostrate form in the chair, “And I am. So, if this is going to work, we’re going to need some rules.”
John growled, actually growled at Sherlock’s words, fingers tightening further and pulling Sherlock’s head to the side, allowing him to lick and suck at the long stretch of Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock could feel the sharp sting of blood rising to bruise and gasped as he ground upward into their hands roughly.
“A few, yeah. Just a few,” John mirrored the movement, lifting his mug.
John took a step forward, mouth tight, “Have you
John threw the folder down on the coffee table, momentum spilling several pages out and onto the floor, “That! That’s what happened. You prick, you insufferable, pathological lying prick!”
John snapped his fingers, “Sherlock, pay attention… I’m not finished.” John took another couple of steps, bringing him within arm’s reach of his mate, “Mr… ‘it’s all just transport’. You think I…” with Sherlock kneeling, John was almost at eye level with him, “don’t want… you?” he emphasised the point with a poke to Sherlock’s chest.
But John had squared his shoulders, dragged in a shuddering, calming breath and put the kettle on. To Sherlock’s despair, they’d never spoken of it again.
“Can’t sleep. Overtired.” John muttered.
I trail a hand down his torso to find him in a similar state, my hand enfolds his length, warm and heavy in my hand as if made for it.
**--**
John scratched idly at the nape of his neck, “I didn’t want people thinking you were the cause of…” John coughed, “you know… Mary.”
With a groan, John took in Sherlock’s wide, glittering eyes, the shallow rise and fall of his chest as he pulled in ragged breaths and the way the sheet had tented at his groin.
John returned with two remarkably familiar tumblers, both carrying an inch of good Scotch and an ice-cube. The way the lamplight shone through the amber liquid buffeted Sherlock with another way of memory and he shuddered as his hand closed around the cut crystal.
“I hate to ask, but he’s not using, is he?” Greg leaned in close.
Sherlock settled back in his original position, ear against John’s chest as if listening to his heartbeat, “I would think so, it’s been dropping hints for months.”
“CHRIST…FUCKING CHRIST, JOHN…” Sherlock was shouting, writhing against him, “TOO BIG… SO BIG…”
“No,“ John watched Sherlock circle the corpse again, “I don’t know what this is, but it’s not drugs.”
“He’s just sitting here,” Molly’s voice was hushed, muffled in a clear attempt to conceal her conversation.
The laugh, when it came, was unpleasant and his eyes narrowed even further, “How comforting it must be, to not remember. But don’t worry, John, I have my own methods for deleting unwanted material. Those little, irritating
It was a near thing; the professionalism. When John eased through the door, he was confronted with the almost unimaginable. Sherlock’s bed was strewn with tissues, and the man himself was naked from the waist down, a situation that would probably have been more arousing had the top half of his flatmate not still been swathed in a crisp white shirt and his suit coat.
“There’s water on the side table. You’re probably dehydrated.” Sherlock gestured with one hand before resuming his prayerful pose.
John shouted over the sound of the shower as he stepped in, “But they had your DNA, that’s why you were tagged with the kills.”
“Yeah, just… “ John clasped Sherlock’s hand a little firmer, “yeah.”
“Yes.”
She smiled back wryly, “Probably not, but then, you’ve already deduced that… Mr Holmes.”
Sherlock held John’s eyes, gaze bright and searching before his mouth tightened marginally as he seemed to come to a decision. With agonising slowness, he raised his arm and placed it gently around John’s shivering shoulders, tugging him closer to his side. That done, he appeared at a loss as to what to do next, so settled on closing his eyes and leaning his head until it rested against John’s forehead.
Reaching up to cup the back of Sherlock’s head, John replied tenderly, “I think I’m getting the idea. It’s alright, Sherlock, I want you just as much.” The evidence of how much was evident between them as their cocks lay hot and hard alongside each other. John shifted, dragging them against each other.
“You’re an intelligent woman, Molly Hooper,” he shrugged, “Or at least what passes for intelligent, “and you’re a damned fine hunter although I hate to admit it. So we’re going to talk like rational creatures and then, if you don’t agree with my reasoning,” he glanced at John, “well, I suspect one of us will be going to die.”
“Why do you need to know?” Sherlock added tonelessly.
A garbled noise escaped from Sherlock that may have been John’s name and the detective’s hands briefly fell away from his diligent work to rid John of his jeans in favour of clutching at the bed sheets, his back arching off the bed. John smiled and tongued at the pebbled flesh as Sherlock shivered and writhed beneath him.
“Yes, alright,” John leaned back, tugging Sherlock’s shirt out of his trousers as he felt long fingers tugging at his belt, “so you’re saying I don’t need to take my time seducing you?”
John winced and tried to pitch his voice somewhere in the flippant range, “Yeah, sorry. You just… I’ll get a rag, or something.”
With a final moan and lurch of his hips, Sherlock went rigid and started to come, his hand giving one stuttering tug before warm wetness spread between them in a series of pulses. John gasped his name, the smell of sex suddenly so pungent in the enclosed space pushing him to his own climax.
**--**
“Because I didn’t think you wanted me to.” John waved his arms in frustration and Sherlock swayed as the movement battered him with a fresh wave of pheromones.
“God, so much. I want you so much.” The voice at his neck was broken and ragged, “You have no idea.”
“God, Sherlock…” John gulped a shaky breath, “This is better than last time, I didn’t think… that was… possible.”
What? You say I should proclaim my heart?
“Sorry, yes,” John stuttered a moment before adding, rather redundantly, “sorry,” before lapsing back to silence.
“Almost got it,” Sherlock groaned suddenly as their cocks slotted together and rubbed gloriously against each other, “Oh, that’s…”
“I missed you too,” John replied, understanding all the ways he meant.
“I’d have thought you’d have left several hours ago, won’t Mary be waiting for you?” the detective asked; the question clearly not a suggestion.
“Was I?” He asked quietly, behind his fingers.
“Story of the century, wouldn’t you say? Story like that…would make a career. Now who do we know… in the media… with a grudge against me in particular.”
“Sherlock,” Lestrade butted in, “Stop, just… stop. You need to come,” for the first time he’d known him, Lestrade’s voice broke on the other end of the line and a sudden, sick feeling welled in Sherlock’s gut, “There’s been a… It’s Molly, Sherlock, she’s —”
“Sherlock, I need you to come to the morgue,” Lestrade’s voice was flat.
Sherlock shook his head, stopping the flow, “Change it…” he whispered urgently.
“Of course I want you home.” Sherlock’s gaze flicked up, eyes shining in the dim light from the vehicles, “Of course.”
“Then what, Holmes,” John’s voice softened, using the stillness of the small hours to encourage an atmosphere of confidentiality.
“Sherlock, of course I —”
“Fuck! Sorry, shit… sorry… Sherlock, ow… damn it.”
Sherlock tugged John’s hand up, above the edge of the covers and guided his fingers to wind amongst his curls.
I edge forward, testing the way before pushing home. John’s whine is equal parts discomfort and contentment. I know the feeling, having been in that position myself. The odd feeling of having to make way and yet welcoming the intruder.
mattered to me.”
“What? Why?” At the hint of a mystery to be solved, Sherlock’s alertness was returning swiftly, “Watson? What are you doing up?”
“Interesting?”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock’s voice dropped, and John shivered at the edge of the dark promise it held, “I came back with so much more than a magic cloak.”
And as was alway the case, John found himself running after Sherlock Holmes, and trying to wipe the grin from his face while doing it.
It was bad enough that he’d been left with an unsolved mystery regarding his faithful friend, but John’s hours spent resting between his sheets had hopelessly tainted them with the subtle and not undesirable scents he associated with the stalwart man.
“Perhaps he’s in his mind palace? You’ve seen him do that, yeah?”
“No… “ John glanced at it, “No, it’s not. That bowl is unsalvageable.” John reached down again, “So I got you this.
“The police are on their way, John,” Sherlock murmured in John’s ear reassuringly, “we’ll have you out of here and warm soon.”
“Christ, Sherlock, more of that, do… more of that,”
beautiful, and it’s perfect for me. Now come back to bed.”
“What we want to know, is whether you really matter to him. You see, we think you were just useful to him, a tool to be applied as needed. Bat those pretty eyes at you, pitch that voice
John seemed surprised that Sherlock had capitulated, and having been given a free ticket to the deepest recesses of Sherlock’s brain, appeared to be momentarily shocked to silence. Sherlock simply steepled his hands beneath his lips and waited for the inevitable axe to fall.
Janine hung up again and shook her head, “Pity. Looks like you’re out of time, Molly Hooper.”
“Oh,” Sherlock’s eyes flicked briefly toward his own bedroom before his lips tightened, “of course. Night John.”
John paused and internalised what were the answers to his five leading questions, instead opting for, “you’ve been preparing for this conversation for a while?”
He spread a hand wide on the shiny door, the rich brown of the varnish catching what little light there was. He imagined Sherlock on the other side, despondent forehead bent to touch the wood, warm breath creating little patches of condensation on his side of the door. It would be so easy to knock, or to let himself in. He’d lead Sherlock to the bed, push him down… or let himself be pulled down… and forget about the world outside the door.
“John?” He whispered, low and intimate.
“Is this OK?”
“Mmmm?”
“I didn’t
When Sherlock appeared the following morning, it was freshly washed and dressed, all signs of the previous night's revelations hidden from view under carefully tailored trousers, shirt and attitude.
He was moving before he quite knew what he was doing, whimpering as he heard the door of the flat close. Throwing open his bedroom door hard enough to dent the wall he thundered down the hall, wide eyes confirming the flat was empty. His legs buckled as the cloying, delectable scent in the sitting-room flooded his nose and suddenly nothing mattered more than trying to get John back in the flat, with him.
“You… were perfect!” he murmured.
“I’d have thought you’d understand the risks of touching potentially contaminated equipment, Mr Holmes.” He turned around to face them both, “Now, if there’s no other specific questions, I think it’s time you left.”
“You’re not repulsed by my… urges?” The question came hesitatingly as Sherlock lay his forehead against John’s, leaning into his touch but ready to pull back if John so much as flinched.
Our hands have found comfortable resting places on each other’s bodies. Mine on his hip and chest, his is buried amongst my curls and the other nestled tight against my shoulder. Our legs are restlessly shifting against the others, perhaps similarly hesitant to advertise the need we’re both clearly feeling to press and rut together.
Sherlock, meanwhile, had resumed pacing the small room, his hands clenching reflexively and his face tight.
“It’s not what I’ve been taught.” There was something in John’s voice, a desperate note of hope.
John awoke the following morning pleasantly achy and unpleasantly warm. As expected, Sherlock was nestled against him, exactly where he’d been when they finally succumb to exhaustion. What John didn’t expect was for the two of them to be wrapped in Sherlock’s Belstaff, sides tucked securely around them both and encased like a red lined woolen sausage.
for me, Holmes.”
doing.”
good. Just, it’s not something I’ve ever been able to do, you understand?”
“That’d be… umm, yeah, that’d be… good.” Sherlock was now running his firm hands along the lengths of both feet, sliding smoothly up and back down John’s calves as far as he could reach.
“For what?” he asked quietly.
John hadn’t been prepared for Sherlock to be a good man. He’d been lulled into expecting the fairy-tale lurking horror, forever poised to commit evil acts of brutality on the weak and innocent. Instead, Sherlock used his heightened senses to bring evil to justice. Certainly John wasn’t naïve enough to think Sherlock did it for anything other than the rush of the chase…but still….justice was served by his actions.
Sherlock took three long strides and pulled open one of the empty cadaver drawers, standing to one side without a word.
Moment passed before the shaking he thought were aftershocks rattling Sherlock’s lean frame resolved themselves as quiet laughter, rocking him in John’s arms.
“And I’m home,” John agreed.
“Well, I know that NOW! I said
Sherlock winced, fighting his own instincts and uttering the hateful words again, “I asked if I should leave.”
Without a word, Sherlock rose and stepped to the door, closing it against the chance they should be overheard before he returned to his seat, “This concerns your husband.”
In response to a gentle tug by John, there was a breathy moan that John took to be affirmative before he surrendered what remained of his rational thoughts as Sherlock picked up the pace and did something altogether new with his fist and John felt his balls tighten.
John’s hand slipped from Sherlock’s hip around to rest at the small of his partner’s back with a small whine, “God… stop moving.”
Sometimes Sherlock would read, holding a book open in his other hand and awkwardly turning pages, other nights he’d turn on the telly and drop the volume low. But always it ended the same way; Sherlock would finally put aside what he was doing and apply his focus to John, smoothing, stroking and setting John’s skin alight with tingles until John drifted to sleep.
“Jesus, how drunk did I get?” Even the sound of the gas jet under the kettle seemed abnormally loud.
And with that, John’s eyes rolled back and he pitched head first into Sherlock’s lap.
, he thought,
“Sherlock?” John began quietly.
Tucking his arm around John and settling more heavily, Sherlock rumbled, “This was about trust.”
“Now who’s the threat?” John reached for the water as his voice rasped on the final word.
After the first couple of crime scenes, where John had been sure that some overt symbol of depravity must be inked on their faces, and he waited nervously for every passing person to confront them and brand them pariahs, his nervousness had started to calm. Even Mrs Hudson failed to remark on the frequency with which John elected to spend the night rather than go home, and slowly, finally John ceased jumping at every passing remark that could be construed as hiding judgement.
With a long waking breath drawn through his nose, the detective's eyelids opened and he looked blurring toward the doctor, “John?” He mumbled on the intake of breath before shaking his head a little and correcting himself to the more formal, “Watson?”
Sherlock seemed suddenly to realize himself and brushed away the tears, clearing his throat thickly, “Agreed. It won’t be easy, you understand that?” He rubbed his fingertips together as if concentrating on the bloody fluid between them, but John knew his focus was entirely elsewhere.
With a startled squeak, he found himself suddenly beneath Sherlock as the taller man rolled them over, and buried his face against John’s neck, breathing harshly.
John settled more comfortably, now lounging against Sherlock, his hand shifted from Sherlock’s throat to nestle in his hair, “No more mind tricks. I mean it, Sherlock. You said last night was about trust.”
“Or throwing up at a crime scene,” John added.
We shall die
“Shut up.”
His eyes still shut, Sherlock murmured dismally, “I can’t.”
“Of course it’s you. Go away.”
“Never,” John managed to mumble as the thumb brushed featherlight across his nipple again as he felt it pebble in response, “Nobody has ever touched me like this.”
“Mmmm, perhaps” Janine thumbed the redial button and put the phone on speaker.
Sherlock returned his gaze sheepishly, “Almost never.” He shifted on the chair and winced, “Shower?”
Now I don't know if there's more.
Sherlock rolled them over, pressing John’s shorter body beneath him and proceeded to map every inch of his skin, worshiping with eyes, and tongue, and fingers, methodically shifting down the bed and devouring each new area as John mumbled, and cursed and tried to tug Sherlock back up where he could get at him. But Sherlock wouldn’t be deterred, treating John with every bit as much focus as a crime scene, and all John could do was submit to the onslaught. When Sherlock finally took John in his mouth, it was all John could do not to scream with the sheer joy at the feeling, fisting his hands in Sherlock’s curls as Sherlock bobbed, and sucked and rolled his tongue over the sensitive head. He could feel Sherlock hands, those beautiful, glorious, magical hands, pressing his hips down onto the bed so that, even in this, John was completely at the mercy of Sherlock’s ministrations.
John’s mouth fell open under the barrage of bitter words, “I don’t understand. Who’s hurt you, Sherlock. What happened?”
, and with a sigh Sherlock finally conceded defeat and mentally used the name with the intimacy it inferred, had again pressed for information concerning his private life. He’d rightly remarked that opportunities such as those were rare, and now John was married, rarer still. Sherlock avoided these conversations wherever possible and where impossible, diverted or obfuscated. Because the alternative had seemed too horrific to contemplate.
“Less chance of us ending the night in lock-up,” Sherlock smiled ruefully.
John dropped his eyes, “I didn’t know if I still belonged there anymore. This isn’t about me, Sherlock. This is because I broke something, and I need to try and make it right for you. This is so you know that sometimes, things can’t be fixed, but maybe they can be replaced by something else. Maybe something better.”
John relaxed against Sherlock’s hand, the lines on his face easing into an easy smile, “Quite, my dear man, quite alright.”
Sherlock picked up the sorry excuse for a bowl, cradling it carefully in his hands. There were several large pieces missing, including essential pieces in the base, “It’s never going to serve as a bowl again, is it?”
John grinned and lowered his hips so they were pressed together and John mumbled, “finally,” as the move gave some much needed friction and Sherlock’s head dropped back with a dull thud to the rug.
John followed the track of his gaze before shaking his head, “No, I don’t know why you’d think…no,” he said said more firmly.
, Sherlock thought with growing frustration,
Stepping to the side of the bed, he shook the slumbering man’s shoulder gently and without result. Increasing the effort, it was only after he had hands on both shoulders and was physically lifting Sherlock’s torso from the mattress that the man stirred.
“Ngghtt, less thinking, more - that, yeah - that’s - good,” John rocked his hips, trapped between the delightful feeling of Sherlock’s hand through thin cotton and the firm column of another man’s desire pressed against the crease of his pants at the back.
“Not sure, ‘cause I’m going to keep saying it until you listen. I was drunk, what I said, whatever I might’ve done was way out of line and… I’m sorry.” John tried to put every shred of sincerity he felt into it.
Sherlock growled and lifted his head to look seriously at John for a moment, “Promise me…PROMISE we won’t go back to how we were again.”
and a particularly violent temper tantrum resulting in the purchase of a new tea set.
“Will you let me stay here with you next weekend?” He asked quietly.
this night to go, if you could do it again?”
“Molly…” John began.
“The one who
“It’s fine, here…” John took hold of the edge of the sheet with his own sticky hand and passed it to Sherlock, “we’ll need to change the sheets anyway.”
“You ok?”
“For Christ sake, bite me,
John groaned low and rough and after another hard press of his hand against the back of Sherlock’s neck, he pulled his face away and spat obscenely into his palm, wriggling backward just enough to align their groins and wrap his hand around them both, throwing his head back at the first touch.
There was a moment of confusion in John’s face. Confusion at the words, at the use of his first name, at the fragile expression on Sherlock’s face; impossibly intimate between two men, even in private. He leaned back for a moment, chin tucked back against his chest as he processed the admission, “I don’t – Holmes?”
“I’m not afraid…”
“And what about this?” John licked a line up Sherlock’s neck before latching on and sucking hard, “It always seemed to me that you’d like that,” he chuckled as he pulled away and Sherlock shuddered under his hands.
John ran his hand gently up and down Sherlock’s arm, “Slowly, Sherlock; they’ll proceed slowly. For all my experience as a married man, this will be new to me too. I told you of my experiences in the army and that is the entirety of it. Let me simply say that my intention is to bring you joy and that, in turn, will give me the greatest pleasure.”
I don’t bother thanking him. The rumbling wheeze has already resumed and he’s swallowed up by the voluminous comforter he insists upon.
Sherlock placed the skull on the table and smiled, “Dost thou mock me, fair John? Thou makes a mockery of my wit.”
“Sherlock, it’s me.”
Sherlock mumbled something, eyes averted and John strode up to him, stepping into Sherlock’s personal space and scowling up into his face, “What did you say?”
about this for you at all,” John took a deep breath, “In fact from what I can see, there’s
Finally Sherlock whispered hesitantly, “I’m in your arms now.”
Sherlock had curled in behind him, half an arms-length away yet John was sure he could feel the heat radiating from his friend. The ghost of Sherlock’s breath tickled against his neck as he breathed in and out in time with the pass of his hands.
“It’s like… it’s like the scent of pine lingers in a room after the Xmas tree has been removed. It reminds me of the celebration.” John winced, “Sorry, it’s the scotch, that sounded twee.”
John’s brow furrowed, “But you’ve always said that.”
Sherlock scowled, “I don’t understand why you think I hate you, Molly. I thought we were friends.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened, and what little colour he carried in his cheeks bled away.
**-**
Leaning close to John’s ear, “Sorcerer Supreme,” as all John heard before Sherlock was casually gesturing and arcane symbols burst to life at his fingertips, weaving around John and noticeably clustering around his groin. With a gasp of disbelief, John was again erect, the satiation still warm in his muscles, but his arousal back at his peak.
I recall lying there, under the sheets, warming quickly but still shaking with the aftermath of that dream. I could sense you beside me, so silent and yet I could hear your mind working as if there were gears rattling around in your head. I never understood that, Sherlock, how you and I could understand each other so completely without a word being said. I never had that with anyone else, and I certainly don’t have it with Mary.
“So it’s the magic…?”
Sherlock’s brow creased and he leaned forward in the chair, “I’d expect we go on much the same as before. We chase criminals, catch bad guys, you call me brilliant and I forget to tell you how important you are to me. What needs to change?”
“Didn’t say it was fair. I’m just making sure you understand who’s in charge.” John began tugging Sherlock’s shirt from his trousers.
“You gave my belongings to your damnable Baker Street irregulars, didn’t you?”
“Yes, it did… it does. It’s nothing to be afraid of.”
, thought Sherlock.
“And talk her out of killing you,” John entered the kitchen, towelling off his hair.
John lifted his head, “You didn’t…” he trailed off, not quite knowing what he was trying to say and Sherlock smiled.
that I need her to curl up behind me and hold me like you used to. But I can’t ask, because then I’d have to explain why.
Sherlock, a matching tightness in his own voice as he resisted the urge to prevent John from leaving hissed back, “Intolerable.”
“This…” John managed, opening his eyes and staring deep into Sherlock’s as they sought release together, “this is what I need… Partners, equals,” John paused and grabbed a gasping breath as their rhythm began to falter, “knowing you’ll keep up with me, whatever I want.”
John rolled onto his back with a sigh. It was just that Holmes often seemed so alone. So quick to deride and dismiss, Holmes isolated himself from people before they had the opportunity to discover the fragile yet enormous heart John knew was protected behind the aloof and massive intellect. John’s sympathy often bordered on a physical thing, curling within his chest and gripping him oddly at sometimes painfully inopportune moments. There was nothing to be ashamed of in that, was there? Simply the empathetic reaction of one dear friend to another.
“John!” Sherlock and Molly exclaimed together, and then all three broke into an easy chuckle.
“That was a good night, Sherlock, thanks.” John huffed around a high pitched giggle, “For giving us a second chance, I mean.” He looked to the man on his left with a smile.
“Donovan. I thought you’d enjoy drowning her in milk every morning.”
“Sherlock, leave her alone. Sorry Molly,” John’s voice wasn’t far behind.
they were going. I’m not quite as sure as perhaps I would have been before that case with the bride. For all I know, your brother has her out doing his
Sherlock rolled onto his back, eyes wide and mouth open, and stared at the suddenly very Alpha male crouched on his bed.
John tensed at the touch, “God, you’re going to be the death of me.”
John’s uncertain frown matched Sherlock’s own, “And that bothers you?”
You ask me why I moved away from you on that dark and emotion-laden night, whether I wish you’d followed my movements and pressed for more. You know the answer to that already John. You were always in lock-step with me, barely a pace behind me at every turn. So, in much the same way that you had reached your limits; so had I. Trust your instincts, John, they’ll never lead you astray.
“Idiot,” Sherlock’s smile widened further as John’s matched it.
Sherlock looked up without raising his head, making him look unaccountably young to John’s eyes, “You mean that,” He said, wonderingly, “you truly think no less of me?”
John paused, caught again by Sherlock’s surprisingly demonstrative response, “For me too, but I’m serious. I was fully aware that you influenced me to stay in your bed, and you tried it
John was practically marching inside and up the stairs to the flat, his own pains apparent in the slight limping and swaying.
It is not my usual fancy writing in prose, however the good man asked me to contribute to his private collections of our adventures in my own hand and there has rarely been a day that I could refuse one of his requests. In his interest, I will recall the events not just as precise as is my usual habit, but also with the touch of romanticism and dramatics that come so naturally to him and have given me many opportunities to frown so very fondly on him.
“And yet here I am.” John shook his head. “I'm not saying I believe in it. But I'd rather not risk anything.”
And so, Hamish got a set DVDs of Classic Who and a sonic screwdriver and spent all of noon watching William Hartnell, clutching the twelfth Doctor's screwdriver to his chest.
Sherlock's voice was demanding, panting, breathless and weak, but with a force of will as if he could make it so with just his words. “Are you alright?!”
“Can you-?” John asked, but Sherlock was quick to answer.
After readying his tea, letting it sit for a couple of minutes, he turned around, leaning against the counter top and looking at the kitchen table just because it blocked his view to the floor. His body was obviously already released of some of the tension, but he was still noticeably agitated. “Are
“Yes.” Sherlock replied with a nod and turned his head to face John. “I'd tell you if I wasn't.”
“Children aren't presents, Hamish.”
They were taking him with their ambulance. Sherlock hadn't been allowed to drive with them, so he'd promised to follow in a cab.
The man smiled brilliantly, as if fond. A sound of laughter stepped right to the border of his teeth, but never through. “You ask a lot of questions. I have no need for a vessel.” he replied. A second later something the looks of a tail fin reached above the water's surface and Sherlock did not believe his eyes. “Why do pirates steal from others? You are a pirate, are you not?”
“What did he mean when he asked me to question you?”
Carefully, they fought their way through to them.
Holmes gave a dismissive expression, then he smiled. “I simply know my Watson.” He pressed his face into the crook of Watson's neck, working his mouth across the skin there.
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock asked, ignoring the last statement. He moved over to the sofa and sat down beside John.
As John approached to hand him a paper towel to clean himself with, Sherlock took a step backwards. “H-how did you do that?!”
John watched and allowed Sherlock to change the old ones. “She knows I'm here?”
Sherlock's next question sounded like genuine curiosity, like John was an interesting new specimen or a case rating 8. “Why-ever not?”
John sounded angry, frustrated. “What aren't you telling me? What are you scared of?”
Despite the cold, John felt himself blush. “I could have drowned, too..”
The handsome merman smiled. “Fair point.” Effortless, his upper body leaned on the wood as his tail moved them forward. Sherlock had never anticipated meeting a creature of legend and yet now he was staring at one, he had no trouble believing it.
Sherlock let out a deep chuckle. “Non, Hamish. Pas pour Noël.” he answered in a cheery manner and Hamish made a disappointed noise.
“You lost your head, is what truly happened! You cannot believe you fell in for fairytale, Sherlock, you are above this!” Mycroft protested, but Sherlock would not hear him.
Sherlock watched him with great interest. When John's head sank back against the cushions, the brunet cupped the back of it with his free hand, lowering it slowly, making sure the contact to his wrist didn't break.
He spent the night sitting on the kitchen floor, leaning back against a counter in mild frustration.
“It is just as well. The timing is, in fact, ideal. It will be right in between rounds.” Holmes replied with a sly grin. To Watson's display of exasperation, he answered just as confidently. “Oh, don't play coy now, my dear. You have said worse to me.”
John nodded. “Yes. Because our blood is free of anything that is immune system, it is a lot thinner and moves faster through the body. It's not quite clear how or what it is, but something about the right balance between human and vampire blood is capable of any healing process in record time. It can even cure cancer.” the doctor explained.
The excitement in those blue made Sherlock beam happily. He didn't say anything, just reached up with his small hands to touch the item on his head as if to see if it was real.
They actually made it out of London by dusk, clearing out and settling in an old apartment building for the night. John dropped the backpacks with a relieved sigh, stretching his back, ignoring Sherlock's offer to swap at least the 50/50 bag with one of John's. However, the younger man did not let him battle him down over taking the night watch, Sherlock just insisted and John was too tired to keep his persistence up.
“Six months, I told you. I'd have been dead within six months either way.”
John chuckled. “Mainly decoration.” He flexed the muscle briefly, like a handshake. “Is it working?”
“I arranged for us to have a nice evening with your favourite show and my favourite wine to celebrate our new status as... partners.” Sherlock answered, hands behind his back as he indicated the scenario with a sway of his head.
happened in those two years, I just know that it couldn't have been a sunny holiday. You... changed.. So did I. In all my life, after war, after everything, I never felt so betrayed like when you stood there in front of me. And I know why. Because I have never trusted a person like I trusted you.” past tense, not good. “For some very strange, very horrible reason, I felt good about your solitary lifestyle. It made me feel powerful, strong, important. You had let me in. Me. No one else. Not like that. And when you.. you know, I lost that. Now, Mary gave me something similar, but never the same. I wasn't
John's jaw clenched. “Sorry to be such a disappointment.” he commented. It was that tone of voice that should tell anyone to take a step back. It's not the loud, shout-y people one should be afraid of, but the calm, repressed ones. John was one of the latter.
He found her one morning, collapsed in her kitchen. From what he could tell, her heart had just given out. Their sweet, old landlady. That woman had been more than just a business partner; she'd been like a mother and especially Sherlock had taken such a liking to her. He glanced at the man over his shoulder, his body nothing more than a silhouette in the late evening light, the shadow of his moving arm dancing across John's face. They hadn't been able to bury her, not straight away. He asked himself what they were even doing any more. Sitting around, day in day out, occasionally eating something. Now they were missing two persons; Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft, who was yet gone without further words. If he didn't know better, he'd say Sherlock was unaffected by it all. But more often than he'd ever admit, Sherlock stood and looked out the window, sometimes he watched the never-shrinking crowd, which he had never done before, or he looked into the small garden behind their house, the few patches of green that Mrs. Hudson had almost worshipped. John knew. He felt the same. People always thought of Sherlock as a cold and arrogant bastard, but somewhere between the front and the back of these old walls, there was reality – crude and brutal. He gave it a couple more days before Sherlock would lose his patience; a couple more till boredom ripped first him and then John apart.
John's eyebrow twitched up at the mocking tone. “Thanks. I'll just leave you in next time.” he agreed.
“No. No, I'd rather we play fair in this.”
Carefully, so as to not rip the paper, Hamish took the paper off of the small, flat present. Inside was a dark box and he took off the lid. “Woow!” the boy marvelled, taking the bracelet off its cushion. “Thank you! This is the exact one I wanted!!” he squealed, standing up from where he had sat on the floor and walked up to John to help put it on. John fastened the bracelet with its little charms and received a hearty smooch to the cheek, as did Sherlock. John himself was very confident in his masculinity, but he was more than proud of their son for being this open and experimental and lived the way he felt, regardless of what others said.
Sherlock took a moment, sitting, glaring out at the sea. His love for it the same, but it was not the scattered, unfocused admiration of just a day ago. Suddenly, his affections had a centre, a point on which to fix on. He had only known him for some hours.
“Ya.” John said in a clipped tone, rubbing his nose.
John groaned at mention of movement. He felt dizzy and his upper body clearly wasn't ready to bend. He heard a beeping that wasn't his heart beat monitor. Sherlock had turned down the dosage. It started dawning on him what Sherlock was talking about. “Oh, crap..” he sighed, moving to climb out of the bed, hissing at the pain he could feel despite the drugs.
“Sherlock, please don't start this as well now. I need someone to stay sane in this for me.”
“I did some research and I have questions.” Sherlock shot at him instantly.
Arriving at his mother's house, he let himself inside. His clothes had dried and he carried on straight through to her bed. She was asleep when he found her and he held her hand. Her tired eyes blinked open. “Sherlock, oh, my boy! I expected you back yesterday, what happened?” she cried immediately.
“I'm just trying to think of
“What? Will what hurt?” John asked, taken entirely off-guard. Sherlock said nothing but simply inched his arm closer to John's face, holding his stare steadily. “Wha?! No! Sherlock, what're you thinking?!”
Instead of going with the majority, they stayed in London, doing what they could, in the short time they had, to make 221 Baker Street a safe place. They were lucky, really, to be one genius and two reasonablycunning people under one roof – they had taken precautions instead of fleeing, that put them one step ahead of most people.
John giggled. “Hehe, no. Nineteen.”
The merman looked, too, for a moment and adverted his eyes. “I have lost my life as my family died from fishermen's careless hunt. I was lucky the harpoon had missed in this way, but am I truly lucky? I have no one left. You have family, however. I found your hat swimming in the same way as us. I imagine that is your father's name?”
Sherlock threw him an exasperated look. “I wasn't here, how would we have agreed?! This is hardly fair!”
“Not at all.” replied Mycroft with an even voice.
“A-” Mycroft exclaimed, reigning back his voice and staring at his brother like he was alien to him. “Dear brother, is your head unharmed?”
“Hm, that may have been part of the reason, yes. Do you believe me?”
Disheartened, I drew back into my chair, but his kind tone sat with me and spiked my rationality to emerge once more over the sentiments that had had a grip on me the last few minutes. “Quite right. We would hardly want to let the emotions of these moments to guide our actions with the promise of euphoria. So often has it mislead good people into hasty mistakes.”
John offers, Sherlock takes....until John decides he's had enough
John entwined their fingers, “No more rubbish about me not wanting you, OK?” John said tiredly.
“Oh God,” Sherlock whispered as he leaned heavily against Lestrade and stared sightlessly at the sheet covered body.
John scanned the area and saw a glimpse of their quarry exiting the far end of the tight alley, but no sign of Sherlock.
“And…umm… how would it start, this meal?” John shifted, his own feet now stroking at the side of Sherlock’s thigh.
John had almost resigned himself to the need for another cold shower when Sherlock whispered, almost too low to hear, “I want to try, John. If you want me as much as I want you, I’d like to try.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.” The thought was overwhelming, to claim Sherlock as his, always his, forever, and John’s stokes faltered as he desperately tried to tamp down his climax “Christ, yes. Of course, yes. But not like this, OK?”
“Arse.” John smiled down fondly.
“Come here,” John leaned forward and gathered Sherlock into his arms, crowding against him and slotting his chin over his shoulder to nestle chest-to-chest.
He opened his mouth to apologise again, but Sherlock stilled him, raising a hand to halt his words before he could begin.
“Is this helping, Sherlock,“ he managed to mutter, teeth gritted as the pleasure rose, “is touching me working?”
“All this time…” Sherlock whispered on a breath, awestruck.
“Professional, as in Doctor, you understand, just…” Sherlock was rambling, which usually meant either he was solving a case, or that he was rattled. And going by the expression on his face, he was going with the latter, “… just, I’m expecting some bedside manner. I know they teach you that stuff at college, and —”
For him to affect me so.
Sherlock panted, and John was sure the look he was given was supposed to be stern, but came across more as desperate, “You’re a very bad man, John Watson.”
“Just a few cycles more than you, I should think. Oh, you call it, what.. Years, I believe? What is the number? Look,” he paused his speech to show Sherlock, with his hands, three tens and one eight.
Eventually, the blond would turn his head into him, close his eyes and just seep away into their own harmony. Sherlock would rest his head against the other's, listening to the warmth in his chest, pondering the strange appreciation for feeling nauseous like this.
Sherlock observed John's face. He was giving him the decision. It wasn't about anything other than the wound and he couldn't say how grateful he was if he wanted to. “You do it.”
“With Sherlock.”
A quick, almost amused, exhale announced John's answer. “Surely you know.”
“It's fine.” Sherlock interrupted. He wanted to spend as little thought to it as possible.
“We,” Sherlock had his voice slip from his lips, taking in the strong, muscular torso of a man and the sleek, scaled tail of a fish. An artistic example of one, he would admit, but obscure nonetheless. “We share. My crew, we.. share. With our families, the less wealthy. I never saw adventure in taking more and more fortune without any purpose for it. There is no... temptation in something you already have.”
Still, it wasn't until Mycroft showed up, that it all seemed real. No doubt he had made preparations of his own and one of them would be to look out for his brother because, their squabbles aside, it was obvious how much he cared for Sherlock, which would be heart-warming, if London was not currently on the brink of being invaded by hordes of walking dead people.
Sherlock shuffled as close as he could get, tightening his own embrace around John to the point where John had to slap his arm lightly because it hurt. He made a noise of protest, but loosened his embrace nonetheless. The slapping turned into caresses.
“It's Watson-Holmes, Mr Holmes-Watson!” John insisted, stretching up to kiss his partner. “It'll be fine.” he whispered then took Sherlock by the hand and leading him out and down the stairs after their son. Hamish stood there, dressed and pumpkin bowl in his hand. “God, you're adorable.” John smiled proudly, leaning down to caress and kiss his boy's head.
“Because,” John dragged out the word as he turned around, leaving the kettle to boil the water behind him, “I don't think you're quite open to this sort of thing.”
When he came to, it was just as well: they had been plundered, every last one of them. Even his hat they took. He was about to move when he heard a noise. They must still be around. He played dead. His pride was great, but if he could take one treasure out of this, it was his life.
“Don't people always say children are a “gift from God” or something?”
As he drew back, Sherlock saw the darkness had conquered John's eyes, the ocean pulled under by the blackness of a catastrophe. He would lie to say the danger left him unaffected. “Clever human.” the blond replied, a pink tongue pressing forward to wet his lips. “You forgot but one piece in this puzzle:” the thin lips brushed his chin before sucking at his throat, “You fancy me just the same.”
John tilted his head in amusement and irritation, looking at Sherlock. “You're teaching him three different languages, Chemistry and sodding forensics, but you can't be bothered to bloody educate him about reproduction?” he asked disbelievingly.
It wasn't like him anyway.
brilliant! I need to see Lestrade right away, will you be coming, John?” he was already beginning to dash about, a new wave of energy flooding his body.
Sherlock blinked grumpily against the sun shining right in his face. They'd fallen asleep on the sofa, cuddled up, watching something he didn't care to remember. John's arm was still around his waist and he buried his face deeper into the wool of his jumper, listening to his heartbeat. Like this, he liked to reflect everything that was happening around them, listening to the traffic outside, Mrs Hudson downstairs and John's watch next to him. He smelled the dust of the flat, their food, the books and the wood. He smelled John, felt his solid, warm weight against himself and his chest rise and fall beneath his cheek. He idly traced the line on his abdomen, a scar long gone white, still visible, but it didn't bother him. It was just another one. He had come out to some people, his friends, and was glad to see none of them seemed bothered. He didn't mind his scars as much any more either. They were there like John's was on his shoulder and the smaller, more plentiful ones on his back. He'd cared less and less every time John had kissed around his chest. He didn't avoid them and didn't pay them any extra attention. They were just scars – lines on his body.
“Well, then, Mr Pirate. Why do you not show me how your youth outweighs my looks? I see you are slender, but you lack my strength. Will you really fight someone who could strangle you – more so in their own element?”
He was sucking on a spot on John's neck when strong arms wrapped around him. A peck to his jaw. John turned his head so they were looking at each other. “I'm ready.” Sherlock's voice made John look up into the blue sky in Sherlock's eyes, preserved as night broke dark above them.
Sherlock nodded and stretched out his hand, intending to shake John's on the deal. The merman took it and guided it to his lips. He pushed back from the rocks until he could sink back into the water. A few feet he travelled backwards, his eyes on Sherlock, before he dipped back and disappeared.
Sherlock smiled back at him. There was a silent 'likewise' that no one heard but both knew it was there. “I guess that explains why you became a doctor. Staying healthy so you don't have to drink blood.”
“We're not immortal.” John negated. “Our life-span is just stretched out a lot. How long a life-expectancy a vampire has, depends on the age at which they became one. Someone born a vampire will live up to five hundred years. I was turned when I was forty, so almost exactly a hundred years ago. At my age, my total life-expectancy lies at about two hundred and fifty years. The turning, by the way, can be caused either way. It's not the saliva or the blood specifically that induce the turn, it's a poison that is contained in all bodily fluids, which is why one has to be careful in interacting with a human that one does not want to turn. Too much exposure will lead to it. However, the poison is more highly concentrated in the blood, so there is lees blood need for a turn to happen than saliva or... others.” John finished, looking to the side awkwardly.
They went swimming together once, but John ended up frustrated with how slow Sherlock was and Sherlock himself found his pride greatly damaged by his natural disadvantage. Mostly, they kept to the stony beach, idle and comfortable.
“Chinese it is.” John confirmed, zipping his jacked and walking over to plant a kiss on Sherlock's head. “Later!”
John clutched his side as he sat up. “Did you just...?” he half-asked with a disbelieving grin. He shook his head in fond exasperation. “And here I thought you were reasonably sensible.”
Slowly, he lowered on his belly, his face inches away from his saviour's and he studied its many movements and angles as he spoke. “How old are you?”
“You may believe as you do, brother. I merely wanted to inform you about the misfortune that took apart my life.” he said evenly as he descended back down the stairs. He left without another word, furious. He had not dreamed it up and quick as it had happened, it was right. It felt as if he had known it for all his life, a reveal of a long-known truth. He had sailed without clear course and he had found it now. He decided to spend the approaching night with what little fortune he had left, stolen out of his brother's pocket. A pub would have him many beers or a bit of rum for it.
“Well, no offence, but you're not what one would consider a 'family person'.” Mary answered, crossing her arms over her baby bump.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was crazy how Sherlock had made John go from depressed, disabled, lonely man to confident, adventurous, employed and committed within three months. That's way more than what he could say of Ella. His therapist had gotten him next to nowhere and he was seriously thinking about quitting therapy. He still wasn't back to who he used to be, but he guessed that he'd never get there again anyway, and it was fine. He was fine right where he was.
John took his tea and the newspaper into the living room, flopping down on his chair. “No, it's my day off. Why? Have any plans?”
“Alright, Hamish, you go first. That's your pile over there, pick one and open it.” John instructed as he and Sherlock sank into their armchairs.
However, the sound was curious. There were arms pushing through water, but no legs. If a man came down here to loot further, even without a boat, there should be adequate sounds of a swimming body. Yet the second part of it was missing.
He hadn't consciously believed them, but still subconsciously secluded himself until he was alone and able to blame everyone else, calling them simple-minded and stupid, not worth his time, while he was just fleeing the mockery and the shaming comments, the hurt these people had caused them.
Sherlock broke away. “Oh!” he exclaimed, looking as if the entire world had just gotten a meaning to him. “John! Fantastic! As ever my unrivalled conductor of light! I am indeed high, just not on drugs! I've felt it the first time you bit me, too. A sudden rush of luck and happiness. John you're making me high on endorphins! I saw it in my blood samples when I analysed them after you'd bitten me that day. That's been making me feel so ecstatic.” the brunet eagerly explained.
“Oh, do read a book, Sherlock.” Both he and John turned in the direction of the voice, too familiar to Sherlock. “Aren't you going to hide from me?” Mycroft asked John.
John, however, was adamant about apologising. “No, it's not. I'm sorry I said that. It was incredibly insensitive and really unnecessary. I do hope you can forgive me that slip up.”
As his grin spread, Watson closed his eyes suppressing a great many reactions on his face. “I
Short, but sweet. It came to me as I was sat in uni and I originally scribbled the beginning of it on a receipt from our uni's library. Oops!
“I'm sure you have.” Sherlock found himself smiling genuinely. He turned on his side, moving his head closer to John's, swept away by him like a tide. The merman's eyes dropped to his lips and as his own thin stripes of pink parted, his chin tilted away.
“Nothing, I'm just not surprised. He does have a.. maternal touch to him.” the blond mused.
John was just washing up the dishes and immediately displeased at her resentful tone. “Yes, well, I
The taller man was intent, however, on getting more attention than that and also gave an answer to all unspoken questions by gently grabbing John's chin, turning it to face him and dropping a long kiss on his lips. They looked at each other for a solid second before Sherlock closed his eyes and John followed him, kissing him back.
“Now, I'm not
It was a wash of white noise through John's head. The smell of the chlorine and the rush of blood through his ears; he could practically taste the adrenalin in the air. The shouting woke him up again, drunk-like he heard Moriarty bellow “That's what people DO!” followed by a barely audible, quirky “some sooner, some later. Some of us would know.” with a not-so-subtle eye rolled at John.
– Yes, seductive and brilliant. John had been woefully unprepared for the sheer genius of the man. The quicksilver thinking, the insight into the humans around him; It was intoxicating to walk in Sherlock Holmes’ world. John was as much addicted to Sherlock Holmes as the vampire was to the blood. They both needed it to survive.
“It’s not, and you’re an idiot,” he muttered back, “but you're my idiot, so we’ll do it your way.”
. Right in front of me, sparkling and vibrant and…
“It seems rather determined,” I chuckle.
“No,” John turned carefully, arms stretched to maintain his balance, “you said… you don’t.”
Sherlock sighed, having finished with his shirt and begun undoing the button on his trousers, “Of course. Shared body heat is the most effective process, and the best chance we have of making it through the night without chilblains. Speaking of which, I’d appreciate if you could pick up the pace, I’m getting a trifle chilly here.”
John felt the anger melt away at Sherlock’s tone and sighed, coming to sit on the edge of the bed, “No, Sherlock. That’s not what I’m saying at all. I’m saying,” John’s own gaze dropped before he straightened his shoulders and looked back up, admitting the truth, “I’m saying I don’t trust myself.”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock rumbled thoughtfully, watching him shuffle about the room.
Sherlock gave up the struggle and the rich chuckle resonated around the room, “Heaven forbid; our breakfast would be unsalvageable.”
“Can I talk to you?” John folded his morning paper and put it aside, his heart hammering in his chest.
“You called for me,” John paused, “You sounded upset.”
Not sure why I’m writing this, to be honest, you being dead and all. But Ella’s suggested that one way or another, I need to get the shit that’s in my head out, or I’m not going to be able to properly move forward, with Mary.
“I may not like it, John, but yes, I understand it.”
Sherlock lowered his glass to the coffee table, “Why would you think my reputation was at risk?”
“Yes, you’re absolutely right. I’ll see you in the morning,” With a dismissive wave, Sherlock fell silent and with a frustrated grumble, John turned away to stalk up the stairs.
“Begin with tea; tea always helps,” Sherlock nudged the cup closer and John enfolded it with both palms. Sherlock was right, the heat against his hands contributed to ground his whirling thoughts and in a very literal sense, gave him something normal to cling to.
“But I…” John felt his knot firm again and his cock pulse as Sherlock shuddered through secondary orgasm.
John stroked fingers through Sherlock’s sweaty hair, “Then what was it about?”
John smiled fondly, “I’m immune…” he ducked his head down and placed a very firm kiss on Sherlock’s pated lips, “… you idiot.”
of a job well done.
The bubbly smile fell away and was replaced by something more appraising, “Reporting in?”
“Go on… “
The noise that woke John was more a whimper of pain than a moan of pleasure. He opened his eyes and rolled to his side, looking to the twin bed beside his own. In the dim light, he could see the indistinct mound of covers indicating that Sherlock had tried to go to bed at some stage, although the tossing and turning clearly showed he wasn’t asleep.
Sherlock looked confused, “Why?”
“Please… stay.” That dam being burst, the words started to tumble out, “I know I’m not what you want, but please… please, just once more, please stay with me…” Sherlock brushed angrily at the tears that had begun to fall without permission, “…let me look after you one last time. I promise it will be the last time… I’ll let you go next time. PLEASE…I’ll do ANYTHING.” Sherlock’s knees gave out and he crumpled to kneel on the landing, “I’m sorry…” He covered his face with his hands as the tears began to fall in earnest.
“I hope you find him. I think he’d be lucky to have you, and I’m sure you’d be just his type.”
“Only if I can have a goodnight kiss.” John responded without thinking, before belatedly realising it could be terrible mistake.
“No, stay down, I want you like this, or I’ll leave you here, dripping and desperate,” John pumped away over and over, “I could do this forever, hammer into you until you’re bruised and broken. Would you like that?”
This, Sherlock thought with an inward sigh, is the John that takes his wife to bed. Careful, attentive, verging on submissive. With despair, he realised that he was failing Mary, failing all three of them. This wouldn't calm the tumult inside John, and would never satisfy the very need that Mary had sent him to quell.
silence, this was an unhappy, sluggish silence that profoundly disturbed John. Sherlock was rarely normal, but this wasn’t normal, even for Sherlock.
“Would it surprise you to know that in the last five decades, humans killed by vampires’ feeding is outnumbered by hunters that have killed my kind. And not just by a few, by a factor of twenty!, Would it surprise you to know….hunter…that your entire order was founded by a madman with an grudge against a vampire who was begged…BEGGED by his dying wife to turn her? Would it shock you….JOHN,” Sherlock was on his feet now, magnificent in his anger, “…to know I’d willingly DIE before even feeding on an innocent, and that it’s a sentiment that’s shared by every vampire I know.”
Sherlock squinted at the yellow and black blob unconvinced, “If you say so.”
“Never,” Sherlock mumbled into the feathers.
Taking a fortifying sip, John weighed his words, avoiding Sherlock’s eyes, “Well, you know… people still talk.”
Sherlock sighed and motioned to the waiter for the bill, “Let’s walk then, take some night air before returning home.” He pushed his chair away from the table and stood.
“This leaves the question of who… “ Molly began.
“Yes, I suppose you have. Sorry, I hadn’t noticed,” Sherlock’s gaze started drifting again until John stepped in front of him.
Sherlock turned his face further into the pillow for fear of what might come out of his mouth.
“Your shirt; this would be easier without it,” Sherlock repeated, “less friction.”
, she thought,
Sherlock shook his head sceptically.
“Give it to me.” Sherlock gestured to his arm petulantly, “I’ll seal it.”
Sherlock seemed to pause, considering his next words carefully until finally settling on, “It’s fine, I’ll just,” John felt him shift, rebalancing on his hands and knees, “I’ll just stay like this.”
to me,” He looked back up, his eyes desolate, “stop
“Much…” Sherlock murmured, all signs of humour gone from his voice, “Again?”
I lean across him, chest to chest, and push. One arm around the wrist of his outstretched arm, the other across his clavicle and palm down on his shoulder joint, flexing away the cramp.
Sherlock released a shaky breath, “And would they… Mrs Watson.”
A brief look of dismay entered Sherlock’s eyes and he shook his head definitively, “No, I want this. It’s only that,” the blush rose high in his cheeks again, “I feel somewhat at a loss as to how things will proceed from here… John.” His name slipped slowly out as if Sherlock were again testing out the feel of the word against his tongue.
“John, it’s…” Sherlock licked away the saliva that threatened to spill from his mouth.
“I heard. Was it the truth?”
John laughed and wondered why he’d imagined this, and he had imagined this, any other way. Sherlock was the same focused, demanding tit that he always was and John realised he was delighted at the revelation. John threw caution to the wind and pushed Sherlock’s shirt up his chest, his mouth descending to suck at a dusky nipple, revealed on Sherlock’s pale chest.
“Not good?” Sherlock’s movements slowed.
Sherlock awoke the following morning to the hushed sounds of John talking to Mrs Hudson, lifting his head he strained to make out the words.
“Different,” John relaxed in the taller man’s arms, seemingly too tired to move.
John smiled at Sherlock’s dilated eyes and the flush on his cheeks, “Then we’d better get back inside.”
I know I shuddered, I may have actually whimpered. It was just so intimate, and I was confused. But you saw that, you saw everything, didn’t you. You chuckled low in your throat and smoothed your hands down over my arms, firmly enough to be comforting without being construed as arousing.
. His mind replayed the preceding hours, the flash of her name on his phone, calling for help, calling desperately for him and he’d disregarded her. She’d saved his live at Barts and in return, he’d left her alone when she needed him most.
Sherlock chuckled gently, “That’s nice to know, you’re good too, John.”
“More than – alright – gonna be – more than – enough,” John was breathing hard, trying desperately to think of something other than the feel of those amazing hands on his skin as Sherlock tightened his grip a little, “God, don’t stop.”
John had seen the gentle machinations of Sherlock’s brother in the process and although thanks had not been asked or offered, John’s gratitude was clear in every conversation with Mycroft following the incident.
John was just considering a trip to the bathroom when he felt the touch of Sherlock’’s hand on his, quietly intertwining their fingers. Oddly, it seemed the most intimate move of the evening and John found himself bizarrely close to tears.
John shrugged in resignation. It seemed oddly unfair to stand on principle when Sherlock could have simply ended his life while he snored opposite him.
“Hang on, John,” Sherlock’s extra height gave him a slight advantage as the water rose. John’s feet were now floating free of the floor, and he hung in the detective’s arms. Sherlock could feel the weight of the chains at John’s ankles threatening to pull him under.
John stumbled backward into the kitchen, the rational part of his minds screaming at him that what he’d just seen in the quiet, domestic space of 221B simply wasn’t possible. Sherlock still stood unmoving in front of him, beautifully tailored suit and jacket, crisp black shirt, carefully tamed curls and… incongruously, like something out of Lord of the Rings, a dense vermillion coloured cape draped over his shoulders, gold clasps settled against either collarbone and a very high collar turned up almost to his ears.
“You heard?” Sherlock asked simply.
Sherlock frowned, “Would you have stayed… If I hadn’t.”
With a nod, he motions me to take my time, and with a breath I shift, rocking against him and delighting in the press of our flesh together. Soft and rigid at the same time, slippery and rough, a cavalcade of sensation for my brain to lose itself in.
me, I think I’d have been able to rationalise it all away as some sort of post-nightmare weakness. But you didn’t, did you? You had to push the fucking line.
Sherlock lifted his eyes to John’s, achingly vulnerable at last, “Without you, John.”
“We’ve had far too much to drink,” Sherlock regarded the almost empty Scotch bottle sitting next to him.
“But it is, it already has, you have to see that?” John’s fingers inched toward Sherlock without conscious thought, until John frowned and moved them back again, “Whatever we say to ourselves, you have to admit that our hand was a bit… forced… on this?”
John couldn’t stifle a rough chuckle at Sherlock’s eagerness as he took the stairs two at a time and through the door to their sitting room, unsurprised to see the lanky detective hot on his heels, closing and firmly securing the door behind him.
Sherlock paused, his voice vibrating against the wet skin, “Did you expect it to be?”
Without a word, Sherlock took John’s hand in his and began to tug him backward.
John hated that he needed to do this.
There was something crawling on John’s neck. With the reflexive brush of a man half asleep, John’s hand rose to swipe at the offending bug only to end up tangled in curly hair. The events of the previous night came rushing back and with them, the reality that Sherlock was snuffling at his neck, nose pressed against his skin.
“Yes,” Greg agreed with a nod, “Isn’t it?”
I stare down at him, my intense inspection met with his apologetic gratitude, different shades of blue both made slate in the sparse light. There’s no need for thanks, we save each other from pain on a daily basis, this is just one more type. I ease my weight off him, wary of the cramp’s return.
“What,” John asked, confused.
“I’m chained down here, I can’t –,” John sounded exhausted, head tipped back to keep his chin above the rising water and Sherlock shrugged the heavy coil of rope off his shoulder, ignoring the harsh bite as it cut into his neck as he pulled.
Sherlock barked a short laugh and some of the tension left the room, “No. No, I daresay that doesn’t cross the fish’s mind.”
“John, we’ve ALWAYS been who we are, Hunter…..Vampire…John…Sherlock….None of that has changed. All that’s changed is that we’ve admitted it to each other. It’s one less secret for us to conceal from each other.”

“He looks sad, John. He looks
Live for me.
As the two men settled to sleep, having hardly broken a sweat or raised their heart rate, Sherlock despaired for the future of their nascent sexual relationship.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock took one look at him and fell to his knees at John’s side, their faces close enough that Sherlock’s warm, almost human breath ghosted over him with the words.
The bottle lies between us, as it always does and John adds more before he silently returns to his task, circling and pressing, each time a little firmer, a little more persuasively as he counsels my body to give way to his intrusion. He needn’t worry, my body is fairly screaming for his, edgy and raw. I wriggle against his hand, whimpering as his glacial progress continues.
John found he had no reply, and the silence returned.
“I don’t —”
“I’m gonna need iron tablets,” John’s words held no rancour.
“Anything else I should be aware of,” John drew Sherlock toward him, his hand settling in dark curls to tug him down for a long, filthy kiss.
God it felt good. There… I’ve said it. It felt fucking fantastic to be held by you. That’s what kept me there when my British, conservative,
They stayed like that for a long time. Long enough that John’s knees began to complain and Sherlock, perceptive as ever, eased them forward on the chair, “Now, can we talk about this?”
“Never tire of calling me that, do you?” John said, shortly.
Sherlock looked almost offended, “It’s not a thing, John. Well, yes… it’s a thing, obviously. But please don’t use that tone when talking about it.” Sherlock ran his hands over the material again, smoothing it with a gentle touch.
John turned in the cage of Sherlock’s arms, laying the bowl aside in favour of placing his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face and drawing him into a deep kiss, “Perfect.”
“He’ll find you, he’s probably on his way now.”
Just when I was starting to relax into your arms, you couldn’t resist the opportunity to take those long musician’s fingers of yours and have a nice long tactile feel of my scar. Nobody does that, Sherlock, but you did. What’s more, the way you did it…..Jesus Christ, it’s like you were reading my DNA through my skin.
. You called me
“You’re… mmmm… good,” he added determinedly.
“Sherlock,” John finally whispered the over-intimate name and reached to lay a gentle hand on Sherlock’s side, steadying him as the taller man made a subtle, broken noise and his knees threatened to buckle at the hushed use of his first name.
There was a sudden cessation of movement before Sherlock resumed the fine adjustments on the microscope focus knob. Even with his crushing hangover, John had seen it.
“John… “ Sherlock whispered warningly.
He’d just concluded that things might look brighter in the morning and resolved himself to call it a night when John muttered in a  slurring voice that cut through the silent air and tore Sherlock’s already bruised heart into pieces, “Frigid, fucking, cocktease.”
“Show me?”
His voice has become a series of grunts, little huffs of breath catching on his vocal cords in their frantic flight from his lungs. It won’t be long now and I begin to give myself over to my own rising swell of desire.
“Won’t – stop – can’t, Oh John…oh… Oh!” Sherlock gave three short, hard erratic thrusts and briefly stilled, pressed hard against John’s arse and the feeling of wetness increased suddenly as Sherlock shuddered and moaned low in his throat.
“What?”
Perhaps if the thought of simply crawling back into bed hadn’t been so appealing, John would have considered the words more carefully, as it was he settled back gratefully into the chair, reaching again for his mug, “Alright, thanks. Tell me all about it when you get back, yeah?”
“If I let you in, you need to give me your word to treat the situation in a professional manner.”
Only last night
“No John, I know you won’t be able to act, not with his saliva in your system. I just ask you not to intercede.” She stepped away from them both, edging toward the desk.
I experiment with a gentle nip and tug of his bottom lip and he draws back startled, before sucking the offended flesh between his own lips, quirking an appraising grin at me and diving back in, the lip pressed back between mine with unabashed consent.
Sherlock chuckled and John felt the sharp edge of fangs where they grazed the skin as Sherlock smiled before he drew away, “Sorry… yes, you’re right. I apologise.”
“No indeed,” John’s moustache lifted as he smiled broadly before stepping forward to crowd Sherlock against the door, “we have a reputation to uphold, after all.”
“But you
“Call him —” She spluttered as talking filled her mouth with water, “call him again.”
A terse grunt was all the response Sherlock gave as he disappeared out the door.
“Disaster,” and with that decisive comment, silence fell between the two men, easy at first but growing in density as the seconds turned into minutes until John broke it.
“All the better for seeing you, and hearing you plan to spend the day,” Sherlock answered, pushing himself up to sitting heedless of the way the sheets puddled around his bare torso.
Would you have wanted me to be brave, I wonder? Or were you as afraid as I was, taking refuge in the safety of friendship and never daring to reach for more. We’ll never know.
Sherlock sat silently, fingers steepled under his chin watching John as he went over the sheet again.

that have been building for you, I’m clearing out the attic, John. I’m done with them. ”
done on the moors and what John had absolutely
A wordless nod and an answering clasp of his fingers was all the confirmation John needed to tug him down the hall.
“You have questions,” Sherlock murmured around the cup at his lips.
“Oh…” John smirked, eyes demanding, “I think we can do better than that.
“You sure?”
“Bedroom, now,” John mumbled into his mouth, “or we’ll be finishing this here and I really don’t want our first time, after so bloody long, to be up against the kitchen counter.”
“Jesus, sorry. I really fucked up that night, didn’t I?” John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s arm.
Sherlock shrugged, “Who knows. I’ve heard cuttlefish can hypnotise their prey so it doesn’t escape.”
“You’ve…” Sherlock danced around the words, “… In the past.”
. The file’s a fake, Molly. They’re not my kills.” With a rustle of papers, Sherlock was between Molly and her desk. John glanced back to where he’d been, reassuring himself that there wasn’t two of him.
Due to enthusiastic requests (what is wrong with this fandom, that we love to be hurt) I've extended this to another chapter.
, John. I think you’ve
John whimpered and cleared his throat to try and respond in a tone more close to normal, “And you saying things like that isn’t helping the situation.”
“OK, no forcing me… or MOLLY!” John hissed, “Or anyone else we know, for that matter. That stuff can do damage, Sher… Christ, how many times have you done this to our friends?”
“Christ, Sherlock!” John grabbed desperately at the sheet as Sherlock’s head dipped down and engulfed his cock again.
