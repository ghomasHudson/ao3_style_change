“Don’t be nervous kid, everything will be fine,” Dean reassured. “Just remember they are like demonic dogs. Anything that would kill a demon should kill them too. Just give them one good jab by an angel blade and they’ll be down for the count. Try not to smite them right away, it’s good for you to practice without hulking out. You are only allowed to use your powers if it’s a life-or-death situation. I’d rather you be discovered than mauled to death. Capiche?”
On the drive back to the Bunker, Jack tried to come up with ways he could distract Dean, but he came up with nothing.
“It’ll hold. My mind, my rules.” He reassured Sam and Cas who stared at the door cautiously. They could hear they archangel yelling and pounding on the door from the otherside of it. “I got him. I’m the Cage.”
“There’s my special little man!” He heard the voice of his mother say from another room. The sound of it triggered a memory from deep into his childhood. A time when his life had been different and safe and normal.
“Yes, I’m fine,” Jack said honestly. Sean didn’t scare him for a second, he knew the man was too big of a coward to ever actually hurt him. Even if he did succeed it would’ve been the last thing he ever did. Jack knew he could stop him with a blink of an eye if necessary and either way the Winchesters and Castiel could easily kick his ass.
“Haha nice try,” Claire said sarcastically. “Except, I already gathered the materials for the summoning and inside of the box is a picture of me not you. Which means, I get to summon the demon.”
On the ride to the motel, Castiel texted him asking how everything was going. Jack wasn’t going to answer. He was too worried that this conversation would lead to Cas finding out that they had left Jody’s. Then he realized that if he didn’t answer, the angel would assume something had happened. So he replied:
“Yeah, I had done some digging around the house on my first day here.” Dean tried to recall any questions he had. “What happened with my Dad? He seems like a sore topic around here.”
“There’s Patience, she’s a psychic; there’s Alex, she was raised by vampires; and there’s Claire, she -“ Dean interrupted his brother.
“Cas, please just tell me. I need to know. This is my brother were talking about.” Sam practically pleaded.
“Your really think I need powers to beat you.” Michael rolled his eyes. “I destroy worlds, I can crush you with my bare hands.”
Then everything came to a halt yesterday when a hunter who had been working the same case turned up dead. He was young, in his early 30s. Jody said she’d only met him a few times, but she could tell he was a good guy. Of course that was all it took for Jody to freak out and they’ve stopped research ever since.
Jack nodded. “Yes Daddy. I’ll be a good big brother. I promise.” Dean nearly chuckled at the serious look the kid had on his face. It was the same serious gaze older Jack had, but he was sure both Jack’s copied the look from Cas.
Claire sighed in defeat. She knew Jody was right and she was only fighting to be petty. No matter how much she loved the dorks, living with the Winchester’s would be a nightmare. Jody and Alex were bad enough, but having Castiel constantly over her shoulder with his dumb puppy dog eyes would be worse. The corny Dad jokes and bottled up emotions would make her feel like she was suffocating.
“Why are you looking through my coat?” Jack turned around to see that Dean and Cas had already come back and quickly pulled his hand out. The angel didn’t sound angry with him, only curious, giving him a bit of relief.
“Hey Dean!” She greeted him cheerfully giving Dean a hug that he returned, holding on for a little longer than appropriate for a casual family greeting.
“Fine. Then I’ll walk back over there, tell the Winchesters that you hired me, then they can pay me the money themselves.” The idea that Sean would sell him out and ruin their plan made Jack’s stomach feel uneasy, but he refused to show his nerves.
Jack knew that Sam was implying that Dean wouldn’t come home with them because he’d be staying with the girl. He’s seen it before. They would leave in the Impala while Dean stayed and they wouldn't see him again until late the next morning. He’d stumbled into the kitchen with a big grin on his face wearing the same wrinkled clothes from the night before and they were all conditioned to not question it.
“I can’t say too much about John’s perspective on the matter, but I can say my own. I have to admit I was cautious about your father before I even met him properly. From what you’ve told me, he sounded strict and like he was too hard on you growing up. When I expressed my concerns, you quickly came to his defense saying that he had strong moral code and that deep down he was a family man. So, I believed you, I mean I had no proof to show otherwise.
The rest of the album was more photos from Jack’s childhood. They all showed the life the kid had with Dean and Cas as his dad’s and an occasional photo with his Uncle Sam.
Castiel rolled his eyes irritably, but before he could comment a voice from behind Sean spoke up. “I’m pretty sure he told you no,” Dean said calmly, “so scram.” He moved past the guy, placing the pitcher of beer and basket of fries on the table.
“I would have been a lot nicer to him if I knew more than Patience’s freaky vision where he had glowing eyes,” Claire pointed out. She felt kinda bad about it too. The Winchesters brought the nephilim along for a social experience and all he got was Claire giving him a hard time for being naive. Welcome to the real world… I guess.
“Do you even know which angel would trap you in a dream like this? And if we do manage to summon him, how do you expect us to fight it? We don’t have access to any weapons.” Dean thought about it. He tried to think of which angel would do this, but came up with nothing. There were very few angels left, most of them he didn’t know. There was Sister Jo, but he couldn’t think of a motive, she seemed to do anything to keep herself alive. Messing with a Winchester was like signing your death certificate. Then there was Naomi, who was an evil bitch, but these days she seemed mellow, especially with the extinction of angels nigh. Besides that, the only other angel he knew was Cas, which he ruled out for obvious reasons. He felt like there was another angel that he was missing, but when he tried to remember his brain went fuzzy. Even trying to dig deeper gave him a headache.
“Look Baby, we’ve gone domestic.” The last time he remembered seeing a booster seat in the Impala was when Sam needed it. Not that they used it for very long after their mother’s death. They got rid of it as soon as Sam was able to use a seatbelt.
His brother rolled his eyes. “No. I’m saying that you were never meant to be Mike Brady. I think you need someone who’s a little weird. Someone that will keep you on your toes. Otherwise, you would get bored pretty quickly.”
“Unless, of course, you think this is a dream brought on by the djinn and you plan to use that knife on yourself.” Dean was in shock. It didn’t make sense that this Cas knew exactly what a djinn was. In his previous fantasy world the supernatural didn’t exist and everyone thought Dean was crazy.
“Papa usually reads to me from a book, but you make up stories.” Dean sighed. He would have trouble thinking up a story that was also PG.
The sheriff gave her a sympathetic look, “I don’t know if this makes it better or worse, but they’re bringing Castiel.”
“Dean this is isn’t real. Michael is keeping you locked in some… weird fantasy world.” Sam explained quickly. Both him and Cas looked out of breath like they were in a hurry to leave.
“Look, we can buy you a box of Legos tomorrow.” Dean brushed off Jack’s comment with a joke. No use dwelling on what they didn’t have.
“No, he’s too innocent. Besides it’s an 80s movie, Sam will show him when he’s ready,” Claire rebutled.
He definitely took Dean’s attention away from her and put it on himself. It took Jack an hour to convince Sam, Dean, and Castiel that he wasn’t dying again. He tried telling them that he just drank water too quickly but apparently his excuse wasn’t convincing.They all kept a close eye on him the rest of the night, but at least Dean didn’t try flirting with the waitress again.
“No, she’s right. We should talk about the case.” Sam quickly pulled his tablet from his bag. He ignored Dean, who muttered “nerd”, as he pulled up his notes page that he had been typing during the car ride. “So, hellhounds usually only attack people who made a demon deal when their time is up. So, it’s unusual for this many attacks to happen in the same area and this close together. It’s also odd that a hunter was attacked, especially since he was working the same case which means there’s no way he could’ve made a deal.
Jack was completely entranced by every word Castiel was saying. It made him feel a wonderful warmth growing from inside his chest. Although that didn’t prevent him from noticing the way Castiel’s eyes seemed glazed over as he spoke and he immediately knew that the angel wouldn’t be this open about his feelings if it weren’t for the spell. The angel seemed to be speaking from a faraway haze as his eyes were looking directly down at the table in front of where he was sitting. Which is why neither of them were prepared for the voice that rang out from behind them.
“I told you that you should have asked Sam cause I knew whatever I’d say would be crappy. His speech would be better and he’d be able to say it without blowing up.” Dean gave him a half smile to show that he wasn’t mad at him. Jack wasn’t afraid of Dean anymore, but he knew the hunter still felt guilty about the time when he was. “Listen, I don’t want you to feel sorry for me because of anything you heard me say right now. I am fine. Seriously. People make it seem like you have to have this big romance in order to be happy, but I want you to know that’s not true. I am content with not having that type of relationship.
By the time 11:00 rang and they were headed to the bar, Jack had nearly forgotten about the plan entirely, his mind too busy replaying the night's events.
“I think it’s… sweet.” There was a long silence that followed Castiel’s answer. Jack had to fight the urge to open his eyes and see the look on their faces. However, he knew that he couldn’t let them know that he was awake or else the moment would be ruined.
The album started off with pictures of him and Cas during, what he guessed, was the early stages in their relationship. Cas looked younger, like when he first met the angel’s vessel Jimmy Novak. Dean appeared to be younger too, only a reminder to how much he’s aged in what felt like a short amount of time. He reached a page that showed him, Cas, and Sammy. His little brother still had remnants of his bangs that didn’t last very long past his Stanford years.
Jack called her only to replay the entire story to her, Alex, and Patience who were listening in on speaker phone. They all sounded very disappointed by their failure although they didn’t blame Jack for it.
“You’re right. I’ve been a total bitch,” the blonde said honestly, “I really am sorry. I’ve been told that I’m a little guarded when it comes to new people.”
“Oh please, as if he could have known that you would react that way,” Castiel sounded as if he thought Dean was being ridiculous.
“Oh, I’m so sorry Samantha that you guys don’t know how to have fun without me,” Dean said sarcastically.
“Relax. Sam said it was ‘nearly’ impossible, but not impossible. We clearly have enough manpower, but we just need to do a little groundwork first. Tonight we settle in and we’ll start first thing tomorrow morning,” Dean said, clapping his hands.
Jack gave him a guilty grin with his cheeks puffed out from the creamy filling. He swallowed the bite in one big gulp and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, leaving behind smudged streaks of white frosting.
Claire sighed. Her initial instinct was to go straight to the Winchester’s motel and confront Jack head on, but Jody’s voice inside her head told her to be rational. One, she didn’t know what he was and exposing him straight on could end badly. Two, Patience visions never revealed the entire story. Maybe the demon they’re hunting possessed the poor boy and that’s why his eyes glowed. In that case informing everyone of Patience’s vision would be a good idea. Three, Jack had been living with the Winchester’s for over a year, there was no way the world’s greatest hunters never realized that he was not human. If that was true, they wouldn’t have brought him here if they thought he was dangerous.
“You should go back to sleep and get more rest. I’ll explain everything in the morning.” Dean could have fought him and demanded him to tell him now, but then he realized how tired he felt. A few more hours could actually do him some good considering how terribly he ached.
The nephilim looked down at his phone with a pinched expression that quickly melted into a big grin. “It worked! He says he’s coming home soon.”
At this point he was only half listening to the conversation Jack and Cas where having. Jack was talking about some kid in his preschool class that was always picking on him and pushing him down during play time. Then on Friday, the kid stole the extra cookie Cas had packed Jack for lunch.
“Well… it was just on the table… a-and it kept going off… it could’ve been an emergency… and…. and who the hell is Patrick?!” Dean looked like he was struggling to get his words out. He was caught between shame, embarrassment, and anger.
“Damn that kid has been a cockblock lately. That’s like the third time I tried hooking up with a girl and he interrupted. You don’t think he’s doing it on purpose?” he heard Dean ask, sounding irritated. Jack held his breath. If Dean was already onto him before their plan even began then he was screwed. How was he going to follow through with the rest of the plan if Dean already had an eye on him?
He knew that he was being childish. That the Mary Winchester from his childhood was the same as the one brought back. His vision of her had been impaired by a childlike innocence and years of grief over her and what his life could have been and warped her into a being that was perfect and free from flaw. It just wasn’t a realistic expectation for anyone to live up to. But, that didn’t stop him from feeling like his relationship with her was strained. Sure, he’d forgiven her for that Men of Letters crap from a few years ago, but it still felt like things between them could never go back to the way they were.
“We should probably pick up Jack.” Dean realized, feeling bad for leaving the little guy all this time. Especially after his tearful goodbye.
“Yes, but he is not a ‘buddy’. In fact I kinda hate Patrick. I thought he died a long time ago,” Castiel informed. He was still staring at the screen in puzzlement. “I’ll tell him to stop sending me inappropriate messages.” Jack cringed. This was going terribly and he was almost glad he couldn’t read whatever Claire had been sending.
“It’s safer for it to be me because the demon can’t kill me, or at least they won’t kill me,” Jack chose his words carefully. “Just about every demon knows who I am because I live with the Winchesters. No demon would miss the opportunity to screw with them. They’ll want me alive. Demons don’t know who you are, they could kill you before I get the chance to sneak up on them. It’s better this way, trust me.”
“Okay…” Dean said cautiously. He figured he was going to have to say yes to whatever Cas thought of. It wasn’t like he could tell him the truth. But, he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued.
“I’m not saying this is entirely your fault. It’s Jack’s fault too. I’m just saying that you should take some responsibility.” Alex said calmly, trying her best not to piss off the young Novak.
“You’ll get a baby brother or sister someday Jack, just not right now. Until then, you gotta show us that you can be a good big brother by looking after Sammy’s kid. Do you think you can do that?”
“Are you sure this isn’t overkill?” he heard Sam ask Dean. “I mean, I know it’s a demon, but we usually only bring Cas and Jack for the big boss fights.”
“N-nothing.” Dean quickly answered. “Just you don’t mind if we go slow. I mean as much as I love doing this-” He gestured between the two of them. “It’s just a lot to wrap my mind around. I mean even though your Cas, your not…”
She was also like Dean in the way she made Jack question whether she liked him or not. Of course he knew the eldest Winchester liked him now, but in the beginning it was less clear. But Claire couldn’t be more ambiguous. He could tell that she was trying to avoid talking to him as much as possible and when he did talk she always gave him funny looks. The only time she ever cracked a smile was when she was being sarcastic or lying. And everytime he turned his back he could feel that the girl’s eyes were on him. Jack hated it.
“I-I j-just…” Dean stammered. He decided to just go for what he really wanted to say. “I just really love you Cas.” Since this was the time to say things he thought about, but would never admit in real life, he figured why the hell not?
“Yes!” Alex nodded. “At this point, they’re clearly not going to do it themselves, they need a little push in the right direction.”
“Yeah, I do,” Jack admitted with a slight blush. “I’d eat it all the time if I could. But, Sam and Dean made me promise to only eat it on special occasions or else they would stop buying it. I think you spending the night is special enough.” With that last thought, Jack decided to grab one more and tucked it away in his pocket.
“What the hell are you talking about Dean? Of course this is real and you for real screwed up and got plowed by a car.” Sam said with a hint of attitude, clearly he thought Dean was crazy.
That was the wake up call he needed to grasp the reality of the situation. This was his fault. All of it. He was the one to spike their drinks, he was the one who made Cas open up, it was all him. He was the one who got his father into this mess and needed to be the one to get him out. He needed to make this right the only way he knew how.
Dean sighed. How could he explained what happened without sounding like a total sap? “Michael wanted me to stop fighting him. So, he gave me what I really wanted: my family safe and happy.” In some ways he got off easy. Michael could have subjected him with endless hours of torture, but he didn’t. He gave him a perfect fantasy world and Dean reacted exactly as he wanted him to. If it weren’t for Sam and Cas invading his head, he could have been stuck there forever. At least until Michael bit the dust or decided to let him die. It was still an unsettling thought.
“I don’t know what you should do about Dean and Cas, but I think they need to work things out for themselves. You should try talking to Jack,” Alex told her with a sigh. Claire didn’t respond. She didn’t see the point in pointing out the obvious fact that Jack didn’t want to talk to her. “Hey, you said this movie was what got you into this mess, maybe it’ll give you an idea about how to get out,” Alex joked while turning up the volume with the remote.
“Hey Sammy. What’s up?” He wasn’t even sure what he was going to say. He just wanted to see if his brother had anymore answers.
Claire couldn't stop herself from laughing at the genuine concern on the boy’s face. “I don't know how to cook either. Don’t flip, I’ll figure something out. Besides, the food is the least important part.” If they really had no clue they could always order food from a restaurant, put it on a plate, and call it a day. Although, Claire also enjoyed the thought of making Dean eat whatever horrendous meal the pair came up with. She had no doubt that Castiel would force him to pretend that it tasted good.
He was walking through the Bunker hallways as he thought about this when he ran into Sam, quite literally.
“No. I mean if I have to stare at this screen for another second I will actually blow my brains out.”
“Oh right,” Jack smiled before launching into his explanation. “Sam’s number one rule is that you must always hunt with a buddy. No matter your skill level. Even Castiel takes a buddy and he has powers,” Jack refrained from saying that he had powers too and even he would prefer not to go alone.
“Hold up Jack,” he was stopped by Sam grabbing his shoulder. “Look, I know you don’t want to tell me what’s going on and I’ll respect that. But you gotta know that Dean isn’t looking for a relationship right now. I mean yes he’s in a good place and I want more than anything to see him happy one day, but you can’t force this kind of thing. Dean is happy with the way things are and he’s not looking to change that. If one day he changes his mind, then that’s his decision. I know I might be way off here, but if I’m even a little bit right, then I’m telling you to let this go.”
“Ooh, I’m sorry lads I wish I could, but I’m in Reno right now. It would take me over a day to reach you. By then I’ll just be wasting my time,” she said in a fake sympathetic voice. “I would tell you the countercurse but I’m afraid the ingredients aren’t easily accessible. Even if you did manage to get them the level of expertise the spell would require, I’m afraid none of you possess. If Samuel were there I’d feel comfortable passing the information to him knowing he’d stand a chance, but unfortunately he’s not.”
After that Jack rushed to his bedroom so that he could think of what he would say to Dean. He already knew Jack couldn’t be as straightforward as he was with Castiel. Naturally Dean just wasn’t as willing to open up about his feelings. Jack was also nervous because if he slipped up then it could potentially end with Dean getting angry and Jack would prefer to avoid that at all costs.
“Cas? What the hell is going on? What is this?” He asked feeling relieved when he saw his friend. He had been almost certain it was going to be a demon or some other shitty monster-of-the-week.
“I’m sorry!” he said quickly. He felt his face turn red as he scrambled for a safe response. “I-I was going to give it back, but when I checked your room you weren’t there, so I thought that I would hold onto it.”
“W-we were having a nice time and I knew that if you left with that lady then it would end. You guys are always so busy we rarely spend time together when we’re not hunting. I just didn’t want you to leave me alone.” It was partially true. The Winchesters were busy and they often left Jack by himself in the Bunker while they went on hunts. Also, the eldest Winchester probably spent time with Jack the least and that made him sad, but he understood. Besides, he kind of enjoyed staying home when no one else was there. It was nice to have time to himself especially when Sam, Dean, and Castiel were virtually the only people he ever talked to.
“I know I’ve never said it, or shown it, but I love you kid. I really do.” Even though he knew that was something that was meant to be said to his Jack rather than the sleeping child, it still felt nice to get it off his chest. He softly stroked the boy’s head before turning off the bedroom light and leaving.
When Dean woke up he found himself sitting in the Bunker library wearing Michael’s stiff, scratchy suit. He had no clue why the archangel was so attached to it considering how uncomfortable it was. It was constricting and claustrophobic and he felt like he could barely breathe. Eerily, the outfit made him feel like he was stuck wearing somebody else’s body, instead of them wearing his. It made his skin crawl. He decided that the first thing he needed to do was change as soon as possible.
“I feel a little bit nervous, but mostly excited,” Jack replied with a grin. He always liked hunting. Not for killing monsters, but for helping people. He was proud that their work made the world a better place. Hunting was what his family did and for that reason, Jack wanted to do it too. It reassured him that he was on the path to being a good person, given the way he could have turned out. He knew his father was probably rolling in his grave knowing the lifestyle his son led and Jack was unashamed to admit that the image made him pleased.
“No, it doesn’t ‘suck.’ I like living at the Bunker,” Jack said honestly. He was aware that their lifestyle was far from normal, but that didn’t mean he disliked it.
“B-but, like Dean said, his mother was half human and she was an amazing person and Jack has shown no signs of being anything like Lucifer. He is good. I swear, we wouldn’t have taken him in unless we were absolutely certain.”
“Don’t do this. We’re just trying to have a good time.” Dean gave him one last attempt at a peaceful resolution. “Go harass someone else, but not us and not him. I mean, his kid is watching. He doesn’t want to hear you say gross shit about his dad.”
Jack actually related a lot to the main character. She also had never attended a real school and didn’t understand what was happening. Although the way the other characters were treating her made Jack feel glad he never had to go to high school. The other girls were mean to her and even when people acted nice they didn’t really mean it. It was all very confusing.
Sean put his hands up in surrender. “Okay, I’m backing off.” Then he finally walked away from their table. Jack let out a breath of air that he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. He followed Sam and Dean’s lead and sat back down in their original spots.
Dean went quiet after that and Jack felt disappointed. This conversation was not going as well as he had hoped and he knew Dean was reaching his breaking point. If he toed the line any further Dean might get angry with him, but he had to. He owed it to Castiel to try harder.
The woman who answered the door had short brown hair and a kind face. Jack noticed the hard look in her eye when she first stuck her head out, but it slowly melted away once she saw who was on her doorstep. Jack could already tell that he would like her.
“Doubt it,” Dean scoffed. “This is Cas’ personal phone not his business one. I could probably count every contact here on my fingers. He only ever talks to you, me, or Sam.”
Sam and Jack walked out of the men’s bathroom, both identically stopping in their tracks when they saw the unfamiliar man standing at their table. “Who is that?” Sam asked, confused.
“It’s fine,” Claire kinda felt bad for the big lug. He clearly had a lot to get off his chest. She had no doubt that it was a build up from being stuck in a house full of people that’ve been mopey and quiet for the past week. Claire must be the first person actually willing to talk to him in a while. “There’s a lot more action here than Jody’s. Probably because you guys spend more time together. Although, I’m starting to see that it’s probably for the best that we don’t.”
Jack followed behind as they walked into the bar and took a seat at a booth in the back corner. He automatically took a seat next to Castiel and checked his phone when he felt it vibrate. It was Claire telling him to try and get Cas by himself. He felt his anxiety levels raising as he wondered how he would accomplish that. Part of him wanted to back out of the plan right then, the leftover stress from the hunt and now this was starting to get to him. He knew that if he told Dean he wanted to go back to the motel they would take him in a second, but a part of him preferred doing this now instead of holding it off for another week.
He crept down the stairs and out the front door as quietly as he could in order to not alert Castiel. Once he got outside, he turned his cellphone in his pocket off, in case Cas tried tracking it. Next, he just needed to find where to do it, as dark as that seemed. It didn’t take him long to find how. He left their neighborhood and continued to walk until he found a street that was fairly busy. He would just wait until a car was about to pass him then he would step in front of it. Timing would be key, he needed to wait until a vehicle came close enough to where they couldn’t stop once they saw him. The impact didn’t even need to be hard enough to kill him, he just needed to be on the brink of death.
Normally, Jack would have found the sentiment kind of sweet. The idea that Dean cared enough about his well being to not make him witness something potentially upsetting. It would be kind, if it weren’t irrelevant from the truth. Because Jack wished he listened to Dean’s advice. He wished that he didn’t listen. Blissful ignorance was looking far better than the heart wrenching reality. Sure he would have been confused, but at least he wouldn’t have this black hole of anger and guilt eating him from the inside.
“I’m not Sam,” Claire winced. “I’m way too short and far less nerdy,” she added as an attempt at a joke.
Dean put the back of his hand to Jack’s forehead and pulled his hand back like it burned him. “Shit kid, you’re burning up. I should probably take you home,” he looked back and forth between Jack and the cashier as if he was conflicted. With an eye roll and a sigh he turned back to the woman. “Look, I’m really sorry. My kid is sick and I gotta take him home…” he apologized.
Watching the next movie, Jack decided that he liked it a lot better than the first. Although he did not understand what it had to do with Dean and Cas. Jack and Claire weren’t twins and he was pretty someone would notice if they switched places.
Between the long drive and the lack of conversation, Jack really had time to sit with his thoughts. What started off as feeling sadness and guilt slowly morphed into anger. He couldn’t even pinpoint who he was angry with, it was like his rage was pointed in every direction.
“Thank you,” Castiel let out a relieved breath. “Now, I know what djinn is because I’m a mythology professor at the university. It’s my job to be an expert on mythological creatures like a djinn. Of course, you should know that already.”
There was another long silence that followed. Every second that past made Jack’s anxiety double as he dreaded Dean’s response.
“It was. We were living the normal life we’ve always wanted. Me, Sammy, Mom, Cas, and you.” He added once he realized that Jack didn’t include himself.
“You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to,” Alex quickly added. “None of us like talking about our past.”
“I know you and Jack may not have gotten along at first, but you do now. I see the way he looks up to you. The way he’s always trying to follow your footsteps. You’re his hero. And I know that you care about him in return. I see it on your face and it only makes me love you more.”
Although Jack was thankful that his part in the plan was very small and it didn’t involve acting, he still had concerns. Who was this guy and where was Claire getting him from? Was he a hunter? Could they trust him? Jack couldn’t help but feel a surge of protectiveness for his father figure and the idea of purposely letting a strange guy come on to him rubbed him the wrong way.
“What makes this kid so special? Don’t the Winchesters usually drop wayward kids off here. We better watch out, they might be planning on leaving him here forever.” Claire knew she was being difficult, but she was still upset about Jody calling back up.
Sam gave him a look, “Seriously? You could have at least gone for the beef jerky. A little bit of protein is better than just straight sugar.”
Dean shook his head. “No. You and I both know that there’s a big difference between in here and out there. Colossal difference, really.” That was the first time Dean started feeling self conscious from his brother and best friend being inside of his head. It meant that they had both seen his big secret. He had a feeling Sam had already known before, but it was a little embarrassing knowing Cas saw it too. Now, nothing between them could ever be as it was before.
“Yeah me too.” Sam said with watery eyes. “Does that mean you picture yourself with Cas, when you think of having a normal life?”
The rest of movie night went smoothly after that. The tension that had been in the air from the moment Claire walked into the Bunker was now gone. In its place was the usual homey atmosphere that she normally associated with the Winchesters home. Sam even convinced Dean to let Claire pick the movie since she was their guest. She decided to ignore Sam’s egging to play a “chick-flick” to annoy Dean even though she would normally be all for it. After hearing about his fight with Cas she would rather not upset him and potentially Jack.
“You know what?” Dean interrupted, saving Claire from another lecture from Jody. “It’s been a long day, it’s cold out here, and I promised celebratory beer and pizza.”
This Cas was a better kisser than he imagined his Cas being. Even though according to Meg his Cas had learned a lot from the pizza man, Dean still imagined him being more hesitant and slow. This Cas clearly has a lot of practice in the kissing department, more specifically, he had more practice kissing Dean. He didn’t seem at all nervous, proving that to this Castiel, he was just kissing his husband.
Jack flung the door wide open. Both Dean and Cas turned towards him, practically jumping out of their skins. Dean looked like he was seconds from forcibly making Jack leave, so he held up his phone as if it was a white flag. “Um… it’s been three hours,” he told them with a gulp.
“That bitch Angela cast a truth spell on us, so we need you to get your ass down here and fix it!” Dean barked angrily into the phone.
Not wanting to make Dean more upset, he stood up taking his cue to leave. “I’m sorry for upsetting you,” he mumbled before turning and heading for the exit.
“Yeah but, doesn't it get kind of annoying?” Claire asked. She understood where he was coming from, but it was odd how easily he accepted it.
“Actually, we have you and Cas to thank for helping us make that decision.” Jessica spoke up, “If it weren’t for us babysitting Jack for the past few years, we probably wouldn’t have been this eager to go through with it.”
“No? That’s all you can say for yourself?” Sam continued to bitch on. Maybe he was wrong. Maybe this was real. Sam yelling at him wasn’t exactly proof that this was the dream world. Sam ragged on him all of the time. Although, his mom’s watery eyes put up a red flag. He’s had injuries far worse than a bump on his head and nobody really cared. Usually Cas would fix him up and he’d be good to go. “Your not in your twenties anymore Dean! You can’t just get drunk at a bar and start wandering the streets! You have responsibilities! You have a frickin’ family dude!” Family. That was it. One of the biggest discrepancies between his world and the dream world was Jack. He was a toddler in one and practically an adult in the other. He was also the only member of his little family that was missing from this room.
“Are you in love with anyone?” Jack asked as innocently as he could. He knew it wasn’t much better than what he asked Cas, but he didn’t have any other ideas.
She said she wanted to use the “make Dean jealous” strategy again since she liked the reaction they got last time which Jack didn’t understand. All they seemed to do last time was make Dean upset and put Jack into an awkward situation.
“That’s alright Sam. You were feeling emotional. I understand. Sometimes when Dean is overwhelmed with emotions he expresses it through anger. It must be a Winchester trait.”
“Don’t worry, it’s totally safe. We’ll summon you. I figure if I’m right, this could go one of two ways. Either the real Castiel will come and hopefully he’ll take me out of here, or you’re the real Cas and you just don’t realize it. If that’s true this might snap you out of it.”
“Let me try. Please,” Jack said, determined. “Can you keep watch?” he waited until Claire turned her back reluctantly. Jack jiggled the door handle so it would sound like he was struggling to open the door. Then he pushed the door open with ease. He managed to snap the door lock like a toothpick.
“He sure acts like it…” Alex mumbled and Claire had to restrain herself from attacking her foster sister. Claire wasn’t exactly open about the details of her past and she wasn’t sure how much of it Alex actually knew. This place basically had a don’t ask don’t tell when it came to backstory. They could only assume that each girl had an equally tragic story that led them to Jody’s doorstep. Even the sheriff had a story that she didn’t like to talk about.
She quickly shoved her stuff back into her backpack and headed out the door. She needed to leave now if she was going to make it to Lebanon, Kansas before it was too late.
“I just grabbed the ID that says I’m 21. Dean only made it so that they can take me to bars, but they rarely ask and most of the time I order water.” Jack neglected to mention the times when they automatically brought him water, not believing that the ID was real.
Jack nodded. “Yes, sir.” Dean felt relieved that Jack believed their explanation. If only Sam was that easy to convince.
They were probably worried sick trying to find a way to save him. In fact, every dumbass moment spent here was another moment lost in real life. He could be putting his family in danger by lingering around here to long.
“Can you do this?” Jack asked, referring to the rock that was hovering moments ago. He knew Castiel had powers and he knew that they were not as powerful as his own, but he never knew the extent of what his father figure could do. Cas usually refrained from using his powers unless it was absolutely necessary.
Sorry that this story took a long hiatus. Finals and a migraine kept me from updating, but now that I'm on summer break we should be back on track. To make up for it I give you a long chapter!
“Um… yeah. You mentioned Jack’s real parents, who are they? I mean I know Kelly is still his mom here, but who was she?” Dean asked. He just wonder how different the story was. It seemed similar, but yet different.
“I read Jody’s texts when she wasn’t looking,” Alex said with a smirk. The three girls simultaneously laughed while Jack pretended to chuckle.
“Yeah, of course. I think I can convince him to join,” Sam said eagerly getting up from his chair. “I’ll go get him. You two can get started on the popcorn.”
“Yes!” Jody snapped back. She let out a breath of air and collected herself. “Look, I promise that there will be no case talk while you're gone.”
He hugged each family member a little tighter than normal. He had to swallow down any tears that threatened to come when hugged Jessica. At least, everyone else he would see again, even if it may be a different version, but this would be last time he’d see her.
“At least you told me the truth,” Jack attempted to joke, but it fell flat. “Maybe you can tell me about something else. Like…” he thought about it for a moment, “Tell me more about your dad Dean!”
Which led to Claire staring into her plate of her spaghetti only taking a few bites cause her stomach felt like shit. It was the typical feeling of hunter’s guilt. The mindset that every minute she sat here doing nothing, was another minute wasted. It meant another innocent person would die when she could be doing something.
Unfortunately, Jody was less helpful than Claire had hoped. She was useful when it came to making rational decisions and revealing confidential information the police kept, but her range of supernatural knowledge only extended slightly further than Claire’s. They tossed around the idea of it being a Wendigo, but the conditions weren’t right. Wendigo preferred the cold winters over the warm early October air. Also, Wendigo’s usually stayed in the forest close to their hibernation cave and one of the bodies had been found in the middle of a park next to a residential neighborhood.
“Because acting like the shittiest Dad in the world is not going to get me laid,” Dean said flatly, “and now I can’t even go back because it’ll look like I left you in your hour of need.” Jack laughed anyway knowing what he really meant by saying that.
“He’s our son, Jack.” He lowered his voice a little. “I know you were drinking last night, but seriously Dean?” He only heard that last part of what Cas said because he was too busy staring at the young boy. The longer he looked the more he noticed the resemblance between the Jack he knew and the one sitting in front of him doodling with a crayon. Was this what the kid should really look like? He couldn’t even imagine this little kid going through the crap his Jack went through. That he put him through. It was so easy for him to forget the kid’s real age due to his appearance.
“I just finished working a ten hour shift at the hospital. I get to watch whatever I want,” Alex said, clearly not caring about her feelings.
“Yeah, okay I’ll be nice,” Claire gave in, “I mean we’re all a little weird and have baggage. What can go wrong?”
The following weeks Jack stayed on alert for his part of the plan, which proved to be harder than he anticipated. The next few hunts Sam and Dean went on they left Jack and Castiel behind. During that time, the angel took Jack on a road trip of their own to restock the Bunker’s supply of ingredients used commonly in spells and summoning rituals. Once both pairs returned, it took another week for them to rest up and find a new case.
“Anyway, something in you snapped and you stood up to him. I think you released years of pent up anger on him. After that incident, you stopped talking to him. It only lasted until six months later, when your Dad had a heart attack and was put in the hospital. The doctors knew that he didn’t have much time left. You visited him in the hospital everyday until he died. Jack and I joined you a few times. That’s when your father finally turned around. He apologized for the incident with Jack, everything he put me through, your childhood, all of it. Thankfully, I think the John Winchester in the hospital will be there one Jack remembers when he’s older.”
“I guess you’re right,” Claire sighed. “Being overprotective is their nature... shit!” She cursed the moment she heard the creaky sound of the Impala pulling up. Claire couldn’t hold back the eyeroll she gave when Jack waved at the car with a big dorky smile on his face.
“Wow that sounds so exciting,” she said sarcastically. “You said it was quiet, is no one else home?” As much as she enjoyed Sam’s company, her plan was for nothing if Jack wasn’t even there.
“What?” Claire shot her head up. She hadn’t been expecting Jody to talk and especially not about the case.
“Can we stop soon? I don’t think I like this game,” Jack admitted after what felt like the hundreth question. At this point he’d rather go back to watching the movie about the mean popular girls.
“Call Rowena. Break the spell. Kill the witches,” Dean gritted out, purposely keeping his sentences short.
“Only some days,” Cas shrugged. “He’s usually more compliant, especially when we take him to Sam’s house. I think yesterday’s events made him more clingy today, but he’ll calm down eventually.” In that moment Dean was thankful that the Jack from his world didn’t pop out as a baby. There was no way they’d be able to handle a crying baby and hunting. Their short experience with Bobby John was proof enough. Dean suddenly earned a lot more respect for his Dad for making it work.
“Then I’m prepared to wait that long.” Cas said honestly. Then with a flirtatious look in his eyes he scooted considerably closer to Dean. “Although, something tells me that won’t be the case.”
Jack turned around and groaned. “Dean, you don’t need to lecture me. Cas already made it perfectly clear-” Dean rolled his eyes and cut off his sentence by pulling him into a hug. After a few seconds he finally returned it and wrapped his arms around him. Dean nearly chuckled at how similar it felt to hugging Cas.
“Please. He’s just a kid,” Sam voice wavered, with what Jack recognized as fake fear. Still, the trio complied and slowly placed their weapons on the ground.
The rest of the night was filled with congratulating the new parents and asking them questions about the new baby. The all laughed as Jack tried to feel the baby through Jess despite the fact that her stomach was still flat. He claimed that he could hear it and he already knew it was a boy, even when they tried to explain to him that the fetus didn’t have a gender yet.
That didn’t stop Jack from feeling concerned, but he nodded and did as he was told. However, his mind wasn’t fully focused on the screen. He was busy wracking his brain for ways to get his surrogate parents to start talking. This was a delicate situation that required subtlety, which unfortunately was not the nephilim’s strong suit. The second episode was starting and he was starting to feel frustrated as he still had no ideas. He considered texting Claire, but he was afraid that she wouldn’t answer in time.
“Hi my name is Jack,” he stepped forward offering his hand. When she didn’t shake it he awkwardly put his hand down. “I’m Dean’s son.”
He carefully nodded in agreement. He still didn’t think there was anything romantic between his two adopted parents and he knew that Sam’s response would be the same, but a part of Jack also wanted the girls to be right. Castiel deserved to be happy, especially after everything he had done for him, and if Dean would make him happy then Jack would do everything he could to give him that. Also, selfishly Jack always wanted to have two parents that were in a relationship. It would give him some semblance of a normal life.
“Hello Dean.” The angel replied with a smile that was enough to make Dean feel nervous. It was weird, he’d known Cas for ten years and this was the first time he lacked his usual confidence while talking to him. It was one thing expressing his feelings in the heat of the moment, but something about sitting face to face in the now quiet bunker was nerve wracking.
“No, because it’s dangerous,” Jack took a deep breath before revealing the next part. “And I know you’re not really getting something from the car because I saw you put your knife in your pocket when we first arrived.”
“Really?” Jack lit up. “You would let me help?” Dean never let Jack anywhere near him when he was working on the Impala. Dean said he wasn’t ready and that Sam had to wait 24 years before he taught him how to work on the car.
“I really love you too Dean,” It warmed his heart hearing Cas say it back, although he knew it wasn’t true. Well aside from Cas’, I love all of you confession which proved to only disappoint him further. He had sworn that Cas’ initial I love you, was said directly to him and him only. Of course, he was wrong.
Disappointed and feeling like crap, she drove back to Jody’s wondering if there was anything she could do to make her feel better. Once she got home she immediately plopped down on the couch next to where Alex was watching TV.
“You’re such a freak,” she teased, with no real bite behind her words. Jack must’ve understood because he merely smiled before turning back to the popcorn.
“That’s exactly what I think! There’s no rule book which means I have free reign to collect my fee whenever I feel like it. As long as I collect souls, no one cares how I do it.” She smiled at him, “Look kid, I’m not doing anything wrong. The humans make their deal, I collect, it’s the circle of life. It’s how this system works.”
“Thanks a lot Cas! Your seriously going to pin this all on me - son of bitch!” He was interrupted by someone opening up the front door and of course it was Sam.
“Yeah kid, your social skills kinda suck and I entirely blame that on Cas,” Dean quipped, ignoring the glare Castiel was giving him. Jack moved to follow Claire, but Dean stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. He leaned down and spoke in a low voice so only Jack could hear. “Look, I know everyone here is a hunter and all, but try not to mention the whole son of Lucifer/nephilim thing. It doesn’t go well in most circles.”
“No. Giving someone their dream life doesn’t sound like the trickster’s MO.” They usually went after people who had it coming to them. Not that he didn’t, but nothing about this seemed vengeful.
Sam sighed. “No Dean, I’m sorry for going off on you like that. Talking about Dad has always been a sensitive topic.”
Dean rolled his eyes and smiled. “Come on.” He grabbed Castiel’s hand and intertwined their fingers and pulled him in the direction of his bedroom.
Jack pouted then slumped back into his seat. He pulled out his phone and sent a text to Claire telling her that he won’t be able to call her until the morning. Then he obediently curled up against the car door and closed his eyes. He didn’t have a lot of room to put his feet on the seat with Sam sprawled out next to him.
She gave up on calling him after the last time her phone gave her an electric shock before going to voicemail. It didn’t really hurt, but it was enough to make her throw her phone in surprise. She had a feeling that it wasn’t a coincidence.
“I’m sorry Sammy.” He apologized, but it was hard to feel bad for something he didn’t do. No. Cross that. It was exactly what he did. In his reality he always looked up to his father. No matter how many days he’d be gone, no matter how many times they struggled to find food, no matter how many times he came back drunk, Dean always stood up for him. He always tried justifying his father’s actions and it irritated Sam to no end.
Once it was time for them to all retire to their separate rooms, Sam pulled Claire to the side and thanked her. When Claire went to sleep that night she was pleased to find that her lump of guilt had finally gone away.
Jack obediently took the remote and moved to sit at the end of the bed not occupied by Dean. He flipped the channel to the first cartoon he found that wasn’t for babies or adults. He decided to accept defeat for now. He was on a time crunch, but he figured he could afford wasting an hour while he thought of a new way for them to talk.
“The one on Bradley and Finch?” Claire asked. “We already found it. We also found out who the next victim will be.”
After that incident she tried just accepting that she would never get a hold of him and move on. Except Claire was a girl of action, which meant that doing nothing only made her guilty lump feel worse. She had hoped that going on a hunt and killing something would be enough to make it go away. But by the time the hunt was over and she was wiping the vampire blood from her machete, she found that the feeling was still there.
“Honestly living with all men in general sounds awful,” Alex spoke. “Just thinking about the smell is disgusting.”
It was at this point Jack decided to “wake up.” It didn’t make sense for him to keep pretending anyway. If Dean and Cas were being loud enough to wake up Sam logically the same noise would wake Jack up too. He wasn’t exactly a light sleeper. “What’s going on?” Jack asked eagerly, sitting up straight.
“Because he hates Mondays,” Claire answered with a smirk. Jack felt confused because it was a Saturday evening and why would a stuffed cat hate a weekday? He didn’t get the chance to ask because a girl with long straight black hair was walking towards him.
“I’m as good as and whatever was holding you back in your world is gone now. The end of the world danger doesn’t exist here. If you feared your family finding out, they already know here and they still love accept you. If you worried about your feelings not being reciprocated, I can assure you that isn’t true.” Dean could feel himself buying into every word dream!Cas was saying and he hated it. His brain was warning him to not be a dumbass and fall for it, but since when did he ever listen to his head?
“It’s pretty clear that we’re very different people with different personalities and I can tell that you don’t like me very much,” he could see Claire begin to protest but he didn’t let her. “Which is okay, not a lot of people do. All I’m asking is that you give me a chance to prove myself.”
“You heard me. Go wait in the car. You shouldn’t hear this.” Dean repeated, this time with more bite.
“Who’s Jody again?” Jack asked from the backseat. All they told  him was that she was a good friend and the sheriff of Sioux Falls. Which didn’t make sense to him because Sam and Dean usually didn’t get along with law enforcement.
The four boys arrived on their doorstep early the next morning just as promised. Sam and Dean came wearing their usual fake FBI get up, which meant that today would be a long day of going over information on the case that she already knew, but of course they wanted to start from scratch. Sometimes Claire wished they could just skip to the part where they fight the monster already.
Dean smirked. “That’s pretty much the same as my world. There was dubious consent issues and Jack’s father is actually the Devil. Seriously, he’s Lucifer. Kelly also knew ahead of time that she would die during labor, so she choose you to raise him. So, my Jack is half angel, half human.”
“Then I guess it’s not your business if I want to talk to your hot friend,” he fired back. Sam, Cas, and Jack all seemed to be frozen, anxiously watching to see what Dean would do.
Jack looked down at his phone, “It’s been an hour and forty five minutes since we left the coffee shop. So at least another hour left.”
Also, how was he going to distract Dean? Jack was not a good actor and he knew that the older hunter was aware. In fact, he could usually pick out when Jack was lying. How would he be able to successfully pull off a believable performance?
“Kid, you do realize that it’s a truth spell not an answer-to-anything-you-ask spell,” Dean told him as he unlocked their motel room.
I think there's only one more chapter after this. And I apologize now for not knowing how to write fight scenes lol.
“Claire can be… difficult. Especially when it comes to hunting,” Castiel said as he walked in the room and sat down on the couch beside Dean. “She often mistakes our protectiveness for distrust.”
It was also odd knowing that her he could touch Cas whenever he felt the urge without it being awkward. Earlier the back of his hand brushed up against Cas’ while they were sitting next to each other on the couch. If this was his universe, they would’ve kept that subtle contact until the angel would move his hand a millimeter closer and then Dean would cowardly recoil his hand away. In this world it was different. This Cas just gave him a look before instinctively lacing their fingers together with a satisfied look on his face. It made him wonder if things could ever be this easy in real life.
He flipped the page and was surprised to see a photo of his father. It seemed like the only picture of John Winchester in the entire photo album. The only person standing next to him was Dean. Cas and Sam were standing next to him and Mary was to the far opposite end. Both his parents had awkward smiles on their faces that seemed forced. He knew there was a story behind it. Too bad he won’t be sticking around long enough to find out. He flipped forward a few pages and stopped when he saw more pictures of Kelly. This time her stomach was twice as big, like she was ready to pop any day. He deducted from the pictures that Cas had thrown her a baby shower. It seemed like in this universe, the two of them were close friends.
“Yeah, of course you can,” she could practically hear the smile on his face. “It’s pretty quiet over here tonight. I’ve been having a thrilling time of reorganizing the Men of Letters files. I swear their filing system makes absolutely no sense to me,” the nerd let out an embarrassed chuckle.
Once the full moon cycle ended and more bodies continued to pop up, she put an axe through her werewolf theory. Eventually she turned to Jody for help, despite her pride screaming that she could do it herself. She was working on burying that part of her and opening herself up to help from others. Claire was so used to being on her own that it was still a foreign feeling that she was trying to get used to.
“I have an idea,” Claire said to him gently. “I’ll ask Sam if he thinks there is anything between them and if he says yes, then will you help us? You have to trust Sam’s opinion, he knows the two of them better than anyone else.” Jack thought about it. He did trust Sam’s opinion the most, especially when it comes to his brother.
“It’s not like that. We have a great relationship, right Jack? Anyway he was just leaving,” Dean looked at him expectantly.
“I’ll fucking kill you,” he growled as he shakily stood up and lunged towards Jack. Before he could react, Castiel swiftly stepped in front of him and put two fingers to Sean’s forehead. The hunter's eyes rolled to the back of his head as he immediately collapsed to the ground.
“Now? I don’t have anything going on now - carburetor,” Dean said shortly, holding out his hand towards Jack. The nephilim had to think for a moment before he remembered what he was doing. He carefully picked up the part and placed it in his hand. Dean went back to hiding his face under the hood of the car before he continued. “The most recent experience I had was with this girl named Lisa. We were together, but that was nearly a decade ago. I think I was in love with her at the time. I was living with her and her son Ben for a while. I thought I had lost everything, Sam was in the cage with Lucifer and Cas was busy ruling heaven. She was all I had… but that relationship was destined for disaster the moment I showed up on her doorstep.”
“Eh. Not exactly.” Dean shrugged. “Not all angels are good. In fact, most of them are stuck-up, dicks with wings, but you’re one of the good ones Cas. Actually, you’re the only good one, if you ask me.” Castiel smiled.
He followed the sound to the next room over and the scene that caused it made him nearly choke up. It was his mother picking up Jack up into her arms and squeezing him tight. She held his head close to her chest and pressed a kiss against the boy’s forehead.
That thought only lasted so long before he shook himself out of it. That was exactly what the djinn wanted. They wanted to give you a perfect life while in reality they sucked out your life source while keeping you happily oblivious from it.
“Fine. If you don’t like it then we can drop you off at the library on the way to the morgue,” Dean said, pretending like he didn’t know what she really meant.
Cas gave him a sympathetic look. “Can you tell me more of where your from? Your world?” He chuckled. “So that I know this is more than you having brain damage.”
that they could never be together doesn’t mean that he doesn’t feel the same. He has low self esteem, he probably thinks he doesn’t deserve Cas.” Claire swore she saw a flash of hope in Jack’s eyes.
It didn’t take long before the phone beeped again. “This is Castiel’s number right?” Dean read out loud. “Who the hell does this guy think he is? No wonder Cas doesn’t answer this douche.” Jack internally debated what to say. They wanted Dean to be jealous, so he needed to convince him that this was a guy Cas was friends with and not a random number. However, he also didn’t want to get caught so he needed to act oblivious.
The sound of Jody laughing cut off the brother’s argument, “Sorry don’t mind me, it’s just strange hearing you boys having domestic arguments.” Then her face turned soft, “Bobby would’ve been so proud of you.”
The big question was whether the Winchesters were aware of it or not. If they were, she knew that they wouldn’t have brought him over unless he was trustworthy. However, if Jack really was this powerful being, then maybe it was possible for him to slip under the Winchesters radar and past the Bunkers warding.
“Jack, you don’t want to know our past. Maybe one day we’ll tell you the good parts, but the bad parts I’d prefer it if I never told you at all,” the angel sucked in a breath. It seemed like the truth spell betrayed him as well.
“It isn’t always,” his face suddenly turned somber. The angel plastered on a smile, “Don’t worry about me. Go back to your cartoon about the biologically inaccurate sea sponge.”
“You didn’t even tell us that you were leaving! For all we knew you could have been killed or kidnapped!”
“Well it’s been a long day, so if that’s all you wanted to talk to me about, I think I’m going to call it a night.”
“Really?” the woman asked, making a face. When Jack eagerly nodded she turned back to Dean. “He’s yours?”
“It wasn’t me. It was the old married couple up front,” the younger Winchester murmured from his sleeping position with his eyes still shut.
late, but I agree we should get going. Especially if I’m driving, I’d rather get ahead of Friday night traffic.” He pulled out his wallet and tossed a couple bills on the table. “We should watch a movie when we get home. Finally we can pick a movie we actually want to see instead of rewatching
“Alright fellas, let’s roll out,” Dean announced, slinging his army green duffel bag on his shoulder. “If everything goes right, we’ll get a celebratory beer and pizza after. Until then, eat this to fuel your energy,” he tossed Jack a package of beef jerky and a Twinkie. The nephilim shrugged and opened up the sponge cake and took a big bite.
Claire followed Jack into the kitchen and watched him put a bag of popcorn into the microwave. She hopped on top of the counter and swung her legs absentmindedly.
Noticing the way Castiel began to open his mouth - probably to ask about Jack’s well being again - he decided to interrupt. “I have to pee,” he said suddenly.
“It’s pretty similar to the other hunter’s plan, but it works a lot better with two people. So, I’m kind of glad you’re here,” Claire explained. “It’s simple, I’ll summon the demon and keep him distracted. Then you’ll kill him from behind when he least expects it. I know, it’s not exactly foolproof, but running into situations half-cocked is my usual style of hunting.”
She searched the internet and the few books Sam and Dean had given her for about an hour until she reached a dead end. The only humanoid supernatural being with eyes that matched Patience’s description were yellow eyed demons known as the Princes of hell. It seemed like the closest match even after they determined that in the vision, Jack had been stabbed with an angel blade. Eliminating any possibility of him being an angel. Yellow eyed demons were one of the few creatures that couldn’t be killed by them.
He woke up with a gasp. He tried to hold on to the memory of the dream. It felt like an important clue to his predicament, but he felt it slowly fade from his mind until it was gone.
Dean took a quick glance at him before going back to the car. “Jack, we already had this conversation a while back and I’d rather not repeat it.”
“I realized something,” Dean begun. “This is my dream world, right? Then, how bad could it be to be stuck here. I mean here I have everything I ever wanted.”
“How many fucking times do I have to tell you I don’t have feelings for anybody?!” Dean flared, then pinched the bridge of his nose. “You know what Jack? You can leave, I’m almost done here anyway.”
Jack was kicking dirt with the side of his shoe burying the edges of the box that was still peeking out from the ground. Claire was currently hiding in the bushes, angel blade at the ready, waiting for the demon to arrive. Once the box was covered the nephilim carefully stepped outside of their slapdash attempt at painting a devil’s trap. It definitely lacked the precision that was present in Sam’s and Jack only hoped it would be enough to trap the demon. He stuck his hands in his jacket pockets and rocked on the heel of his foot.
“No. Our home in Lebanon, Kansas is the Bunker. Not whatever this place is.” Seriously what the hell is going on? He thought.
“I guess it hasn’t been very long, but it feels like my whole life,” Jack chose his words carefully.
The walk back to Jody’s car was long and awkward. Instead of walking next to Jack, Claire walked directly behind him, eyes firmly staring at the back of his head in case he tried to pull anything. She decided that she mostly trusted the boy. He hadn’t given her any reason not to, besides the whole nephilim thing. The look in his eyes as he told his story made Claire believe that he was telling the truth. Regardless if he was or not, she couldn't help but remain cautious. A lifetime of getting screwed over will do that to a person.
“Try again,” Claire said, still pointing her gun directly at the boy. “If they all knew then why wouldn’t they just tell me. We’re all hunters, it’s not like it would have been a big shock.” It didn’t sound like Jody to let her work alone with Jack and not let her in on this crucial bit of information. On the other hand, it sounded exactly like Jody. They’ve been keeping her away from this whole case, of course they would keep this away from her too. Regardless, she still wanted to hear Jack’s explanation.
Jack weakly struggled against his hold to keep up appearances, while he waited for his cue. “Yeah whatever, start heading towards the door!” he barked, not releasing his hold on Jack.
Basically, Jack really didn’t know a lot about this case. He figured he didn’t need to since the Winchesters usually put him on research duty while they did the field work. Apparently, he looked too young to be an FBI agent and he was a “terrible actor.” Regardless, he found Claire’s notes to be fascinating and he admired the tactical organization that shone through her hard work.
Except with Jack he thought things would be different. She had known him from the moment he was born. There were no gaps, no long periods of time she’d missed, nothing to catch up on.
“We don’t leave because we don’t know how to have fun without you. We leave because we don’t want to watch you sucking face with some random girl. It makes us all feel uncomfortable. It’s not your fault but… I’m your little brother, Jack sees you as like a father, Cas is… I don’t know. We’re your family and we don’t want to watch you doing that. It's weird dude, but that’s not the point.” Sam’s raised voice made Jack wince. He didn’t mean to start an argument between the brothers. Sam and Dean arguing was a common occurrence as long as the conversation didn’t escalate they should be over it in a few minutes.
As soon as Jack and Claire were out of the room, Jody turned to them with her arms crossed. “Alright, so what’s his story? Don’t tell me there isn’t one because I know there is. I gave you a break on the phone, but you gotta fill me in.”
Claire narrowed her eyes at him. Either he had to confess or he would make up an excuse for knowing that information. “How do you know that?” she pressed, feeling desperate to learn the truth.
“I suppose not…” Cas trailed off looking at him oddly. “Are you trying to ask me to pick between the two of you.”
It was a relief the moment the Bunker’s rusty front entrance came into view. The moment the gear shift was switched to park, Castiel fled the car and retreated into the Bunker. Jack had been expecting Dean to do the same thing, but instead the hunter lingered in the car for a second.
“Okay, well just let me know. If you change your mind, our kitchen is free. There isn’t much in it, but help yourself,” Sam looked apologetic and unsure about what to do next. “Sorry, you didn’t come on a better night. Everyone’s been keeping to themselves today, so there’s not much excitement. There’s a TV in the “Dean Cave” that you can watch if you get bored. Dean will probably give me an earful for it, but it’s the best TV we have. It has cable and Netflix. You should use Dean’s account, he gets really touchy when people mess with his algorithm. Sometimes I like to go on there and play trashy Rom-coms just to screw with him,” Sam laughed.
Dean suddenly woke up with a gasp that quickly turned into a groan. The movement was so abrupt Jack was startled out of his thoughts.
“Hit my-?” He touched his forehead where he felt a big bandage wrapped around it. “What the hell?” He felt extremely befuddled. If he was attacked by a djinn, shouldn’t he just be experiencing blood loss? Unless he put up a pretty big fight before he was captured, which would make a little sense, but it didn’t explain why Sam looked pissed.
“Oh no, I find it very annoying,” Claire snorted with laughter from the honesty in his voice. “But Mary Winchester told me that it’s a parent thing and that I just have to get used to it. She said that one day they will lighten up, but it will always exist in some capacity. Just like how Dean gets overprotective of Sam even though Sam is one of the best hunters in the world.”
“Bullshit,” Claire interrupted him. “It’s obvious why he left. He just confessed his love to his best friend and was rejected. He probably feels embarrassed, and now he’s avoiding Dean at all costs. Once he sees your text he’ll feel guilty and come back. He knows he’ll inevitably have to face Dean and besides, he’ll do anything for his little boy,” Claire pinched his cheek as she said it. Jack wrinkled his nose and swatted her hand away. “Trust me, it’ll work.”
“Daddy? Can I have a baby brother? Please?” Jack put on his best good boy smile and looked at Dean and Cas with pleading eyes.
“No, but he kept asking if he was back home. Whatever that means…” Cas’ eyes locked onto his and he knew he failed at pretending to be asleep. Everyone else followed Cas’ gaze and suddenly he had three pairs of eyes on him.
Jack picked up a pair of dark rimmed glasses and fiddled them through his fingers. He was excited for his first hellhound hunt. Even if he wasn’t the one to kill the mutt, he still wanted to know what they looked like. Sam and Dean would probably make him wear the glasses regardless if he could see them or not. They didn’t want Jody and Claire to get suspicious if he was the only one not wearing them (besides Castiel).  Still, if he could manage it, he wanted to try and get a peek without the glasses. So that he would know for future hunts.
“No dumbass,” Claire rolled her eyes. “We mean like are they in love? Like are they in a  secret relationship?”
Jack looked down at the phone with his face still scrunched. “Are you coming home soon? I miss you,” he read out loud. “Why did you put that?”
“Thank you, Jessica and Sam. That’s very flattering and we promise to return the favor when he or she is born.” Cas said with a warm smile.
“That’s fine. I would’ve told you guys from the beginning if Dean hadn’t stopped me. Also, thanks for being cool about that. Most people wouldn’t want to be my friend after hearing that.” Jack said sincerely.
“Thanks. He’s probably just dehydrated, you know kids,” Dean gave her a weak smile and led Jack out of the diner.
“We know Jody. His whole life has been monsters, so it’s easy to forget to teach him the “real world” stuff,” Sam explained. “Which is why we thought introducing him to you and the girls would be the best place to start.”
Sam looked up from his book startled, until his eyes landed on Jack and his whole face lit up. “Jack!” Sam exclaimed, ignoring Claire’s question. “H-how are you doing? I feel like I haven’t seen you in days.”
He let Sam lead the way to the men’s bathroom as he slowly trailed behind. He had no idea how much time he needed to waste, so he would try to drag this out as long as he could. Also, he prefered not to be there when it happened, since he knew it might make him feel guilty.
Since Jack was only three years old, the Winchesters and Castiel were used to him asking weird questions. The nephilim hoped that if he screwed this up he could hide behind that cover and Cas was the most likely to be forgiving.
“It’s not Dean I’m worried about,” he mumbled. Jack knew firsthand just how scary the hunter could be when he was angry and the hunter was not afraid of causing a scene.
“Did he say anything about what happened?” Claire asked curiously, wondering if he knew any details.
Patience sighed. “Fine, but don’t read too far into it because it could mean anything. B-but I think there’s something weird going on with Jack.”
“Okay. Hold on, because my brain is still trying to process this. How the hell did you figure that out?” He hand was pressed against his already aching brain.
“You’re getting closer, but that movie isn’t edgy enough. We’re supposed to corrupt him a little bit.” Claire said ignoring Cas’ warning from earlier.
“He did say that he didn’t understand why Cas would like someone like him,” Jack had his brow furrowed as if he was thinking it over.
Dean was stunned. It was freaky how exact Cas’ story matched with his. “A-actually, yeah. That’s exactly what happened.”
“We’re not dumb Patience,” Claire pushed. “We know you had a vision when you touched that kid’s hand.”
“And you realize that back in my world, Cas and I are nothing more than best friends. And any romantic feels I have for him have been shoved so far down inside of me for over a decade that it may be a long time before I feel comfortable with showing affection. And I mean a long time. Years even.” Dean tried to emphasize just how long he meant. He needed this Cas to know just how emotionally stunted and fucked up he was.
“Alright. Fine.” Dean grumbled. “But I’m only doing this for the kid. We’re leaving the second we got him.”
“He’s not my Dad,” Claire hissed. Honestly, she had no idea how to explain her complicated relationship with the fallen angel. Yes, he was a fatherly figure to her, but a part of her felt weird calling him that considering he wore the face of her dead father.
Once Sam and Jody got back, Jack noticed that Claire subtly slipped away to her room again. He decided that he would let her have her space. The nephilim was certain that he was the last person she would want to see right now.
The bunker was in full commotion, everyone seemed to be too busy at the moment to even notice his brief absence. The apocalypse world hunters were cleaning up the bodies of Michael’s minions, while giving nervous glances towards Dean as if they thought that he would snap at any moment and reveal himself to be Michael. Another reason for him to change immediately. Sam had pulled Maggie to the side, mostly likely to ask her what happened in his absence. Dean always enjoyed watching the pride on his brother’s face when he talked to the younger hunter. On the other side of the room Cas was dragging Jack into the kitchen. The angel had a “concerned father” look on his face and the nephilim looked like a guilty child. Yep. No one would notice him disappearing for a few minutes.
“How so?” Jack pressed, feeling like he was sitting on the edge of his seat. He already was aware about everything Castiel said about him and Sam. Dean was the one he really wanted to hear him explain.
Sam laughed. “All of that is hard enough, but imagine that on top of his powers? One burp and he’d blow up the Bunker.”
“We don’t want to overwhelm her folks, so Sam, Jody, and I will go in first. Cas, Jack, and Claire will stay out here and be the lookout. We’ll call you in once we finish explaining the situation.”
“Dean!” Jack exclaimed once he caught sight of the eldest Winchester. “How are you?” Jack repeated the question that Sam had asked him earlier.
“Yeah I kinda figure Claire had something to do with it,” Sam smiled. “I’m just glad to see that you’re okay. I was starting to get worried.”
“So, what’s your deal anyway?” Claire asked, clearly eager to break the tension that filled the room.
“Wow you really have been living with them awhile if you’re already spewing the company line,” Alex laughed, but he didn’t detect any mocking from her tone.
He flipped a page only for a loose paper to fall out. He turned it over and let out a groan, “oh no…” The paper had picture of Kelly on it and in big cursive letters said “In Loving Memory Of”. Dean noted that the date of death was a day after Jack’s birthday. It looked like she faced the same fate as the Kelly Kline from his universe.
Jack had been worried that Dean would be mad at him. The hunter tried giving him the cold shoulder during the ride home, but one glare from Cas and he stayed quiet.
“The point is, we really appreciate this Jody.” Sam said quickly to avoid starting an argument between Dean and Cas. “The poor kid hasn’t eaten a home cooked meal in his life.”
He waited until Dean’s breathing evened out to talk. “What do you think he’s dreaming about?” he asked Cas.
“No, Dean it’s only been a day. Michael has manipulated your memories as a way to keep you here.” Cas and Sam had matching expressions of empathy and Dean hated it. He started shaking his head in disbelief.
“Cas, I just wanted to say I’m sorry about what happened earlier. I know I overstepped, especially when I brought in Jack. That was a dick move on my part.”
Jody laughed, “Because they’re new parents and we already know that this was your idea and not his.” The sheriff leaned in, giving her a warm hug,“But believe me that I am relieved to know that you're okay.” Claire couldn’t help but smile as she hugged her back. Jody raised her voice after pulling back from the embrace, “Besides, Jack is not off the hook, right boys?”
“It’s nothing…” He mumbled to Cas and continued to drive. Cas was staring at him with a concerned look of disbelief, but he ignored it. Whoever Michael was, he was the one behind all of this. Dean knew it, but he couldn’t risk telling Cas and alerting Michael that he was on to him. It’s not like this was the real Cas anyway.
The hunt took a total of three days, and Jack’s mind was way too preoccupied to put too much thought into his and Claire’s scheme. He only gave her short update responses the few times he noticed her messages. On the evening of the third day while they were preparing to raid the nest, Jack sent out a short text to Claire telling her that it will probably be tonight as long as everything goes well. The Winchesters were big believers in buying victory beer, or at least Dean was.
“Do you hear yourself right now Cas? Cause to me it sounds freakin’ hysterical.” He ignored the flash of hurt on Cas’ face. “Don’t you get it? I like you and you like me. But none of it matters you dumb son of a bitch! It’s not like we can just ride off into the freakin sun set! Screw what we feel! It can never happen.”
“I’m not possessive and that was not flirting. We all wanted him gone and it’s not like you were going to say anything to him. When I got here all three of you looked like deer caught in headlights.”
He froze when he saw that Sam and Castiel were watching him. He knew right away that they were the real thing and not the fantasy version.
“We can’t force Dean and Cas to talk to each other, they have to realize it on their own,” Claire explained, already forming a plan in her head.
“What?” Dean asked feeling confused. The way Cas asked about the djinn didn’t sound like he thought Dean was crazy. It sounded like he knew what djinn was.
“Yes, I do love him,” Castiel answered softly without hesitation. Jack felt his heart soar. “As I said I would die for him without thinking twice about it and I would follow him to the end of the earth. He is one of the most important people in my entire existence. I love him just as I love you.” Okay, that also wasn’t what he was looking for. He knew Castiel didn’t love the two of them in the exact same way. Cas loved Jack like a son and he was sure he didn’t see Dean that way. No, Cas loved Dean like a… well that’s what he was trying to figure out.
“No, I got this Sam,” Dean held up his hand while his eyes never broke contact from Sean. “We’re the freakin’ Winchesters. The same guys who started and stopped the apocalypse. That have defeated the devil and death multiple times. Who have looked into the eyes of God himself and told him to shove it.”
“No,” Jack said firmly. He was feeling more confident now that Claire was almost at the edge of the devil’s trap. “Because you’re still a demon. If I let you go you’ll just get a new hellhound and pull the same trick in another town and I can’t let you do that.” The demon smiled.
They stepped inside and looked around the hunter’s cluttered motel room. Claire immediately made her way over to the desk filled with paper and books while Jack began searching the inside of the duffle bag lying on the bed. Underneath a rolled up wad of unwashed flannels and underwear, he found more crumpled up papers, a flask of holy water and a silver knife. He carefully smoothed out one of the papers to read the content. They were lines and lines of what seemed to be poetry. Many were crossed out and rewritten, while some were scribbled out entirely. This was clearly a failed draft of his, but Jack still took a moment to appreciate the effort that had been put onto the wrinkled page. “He was a writer,” the nephilim said aloud with a soft smile.
The strange voice that didn’t sound like himself did have a point. Somehow everyone being here made him feel less like he was abandoning them. Maybe this was the universe giving him a second chance. He deserved it more than anyone. Maybe Chuck was finally taking pity on him. Or maybe he was dead and in heaven. Either way there wasn’t anything he could do about it. “That’s right Dean. This is your second chance. Just relax and enjoy it.”
“Fine. Do it,” Jack said calmly with a hint of a smirk. “I’ll just lie and deny everything you say. Let’s see who they believe. Some random scumbag they met in a bar who is asking them for money. Or the young boy they raised and consider to be like a son. Sure, I’m willing to take that bet.”
“It’s not an act… and what’s wrong with liking chocolate milk?” he asked innocently. His face scrunched up as if he was trying to decide whether or not he had been offended.
“If he didn’t want me to fight him then he shouldn’t have walked up to our table in the first place,” Dean grunted.
“Now, the last time we worked a rogue hellhound case, it was going after a girl who struck it with an axe after it attacked her boyfriend. So, it is possible that he may have been protecting someone, got a hit in, and the hellhound was feeling vengeful.”
“Come on, don’t be like that. You can’t actually want to stay here with these guys.” Sean gestured towards him and Sam.
“Dude dial back on the possessiveness. He was just flirting, that’s what people do at bars. It’s not like he was actually trying to hurt him.”
“Why not? I don’t even mean all of this not hunting - apple pie - white picket fence crap. I mean why can’t we ever be happy for five freaking minutes!” Hell, all he ever asked for most of the time was a vacation, but no. The universe could never allow him a small break from hunting. It could never allow him to have a fraction of what true happiness was. Every time he felt happy, even if it was for a short moment, he was just waiting for the other shoe it drop. And it always did. Every. Damn. Time.
“Come here, Jack.” Cas said leaning down and taking Jack into his arms. Cas held the kid close and rubbed the back of his head. “I love you so much and we would never leave you.
Claire gave him an odd look he couldn’t decipher before continuing. “Yeah well, you can hang out here while I get the other two losers. Just-” she hesitated, “don’t touch anything.”
Cas breathed out a sigh of relief, “Thank god. If I was incorrect this may have been extremely awkward.”
“Can you tell me more about Jack? How he’ll be like when he grows up?” Dean smirked thinking about the snot nosed kid from earlier and the young man he left behind.
Dean laughed at the scene, “And who says he’s not really my kid?” Sam dramatically rolled his eyes, but couldn’t hide the fond look he gave his brother. Defeated, Sam snatched the package of beef jerky for himself, while Jack took another bite from his sugary treat as they followed Dean out the door.
The next time movie night came around Jack kept a close eye on the coat waiting for an opportunity when Cas would leave its side. That opportunity came when Dean asked Cas to help him carry the popcorn and beers while Sam tried to fix the TV. Jack subtly scooted towards the trench and dug his hand into the first pocket. What Jack didn’t anticipate was that Castiel kept a lot of stuff in his pockets. He found his wallet, three chocolate bars, a cassette tape, and a bag of honey, but he did not find his phone. Assuming it was in his other pocket Jack flipped the trenchcoat over and dug his hand into the other pocket.
“The four Princes of hell?” She turned around to see that Jack had noticed a book she accidently left laying open on the page she last looked at. She silently cursed herself. If Jack truly was a demon she had no doubt that he would be on to her after this. It was too big of a coincidence that Claire randomly was searching for the same type of demon that he was. “You think our demon is a Prince of Hell?” She let out a breath of relief. Maybe if she went along with the false story that she was looking for this demon instead of the one sitting in front of her; maybe she could escape his suspicions.
“No, I’ve definitely had enough of this for today,” Sam said, while closing the book. “I think a movie night is exactly what I need.”
“Mom and Dad were divorced?” He asked shocked. John and Mary were supposed to be the perfect couple. A match made from heaven, literally. Without being hunters their lives should have been perfect. From the last djinn dream, he remembered that there was always a catch. One flaw in a seemingly perfect universe, because the truth of the matter was that nothing can be perfect.
“It can’t be that bad,” Jack wondered out loud. “In my experience, lying always leads to problems. Maybe it’s a good thing.”
He acted like he was following Dean’s orders up until he was on the other side of the door, because there was no way he was missing this conversation. The second he closed the door he pressed his ear up against it hoping that his powers gave him the advantage of enhanced hearing. He closed his eyes and held his breath trying to concentrate solely on listening. After a moment of silence he was about to give up when he finally heard Dean’s voice.
That was until he saw Dean’s face and he realized that the elder Winchester looked equally as terrified as Cas. He even swore he saw a hint of anger.
“Hey Cas,” Jack perked up when he heard Dean speak from the front seat. “I’m sorry for implying that you can’t take care of yourself and I’m sorry for saying that you let people walk all over you. That was a dick move.”
Normally, Jack would shrug off Claire’s comment, without question. However, something in her eyes made him feel like she wasn’t telling the truth. “Okay. I’ll come with you,” he offered as kindly as he could.
Claire watched helplessly as Patience’s dream was unfurling out before her. The boy with the sweet smile who liked PB&J sandwiches was gone and replaced by a merciless powerful being. The sadistic smile on his face as he effortlessly raised the demon in the air was unrecognizable.
More clattering from the next room snapped Dean out of his thoughts and back into reality. He quietly crept into the kitchen, trying to get a view of who was in it. He was surprised to find Cas standing there trying to flip an egg in a frying pan.
Claire agreed that she didn’t know if that was better or worse. On one hand, she was starting to miss the dork. The Winchesters hardly ever brought him along, especially for these so called “minor” hunts that they usually went on with Jody. On the other hand, she knew once he was here that the angel would go full on overprotective dad mode and not let Claire anywhere near the hunt. The case that she found and had been working on for over a week. As if Dean wasn’t already enough to deal with.
“If I had to live off nothing but burgers, beer, and pie, I’d puke.” Claire said with a grossed out look.
Before walking out the door the angel warned them “to be careful” and asked Claire to not “corrupt” Jack. He looked like he wanted to say more but was stopped by Dean pulling him away by the sleeve of his trench coat. “Wouldn’t dream of it!” Claire called out with a mischievous smirk before pulling the door shut and clicking the lock.
Jack immediately got an idea and started searching through the bag faster. He dug through the side pockets and a mountain of dirty socks only to find nothing. He looked under all of the pillows only to find a small handgun. Next he stuck his hand under the mattress until his hand touched a hard object. He pulled out a thick, leather back journal. He scanned through the first couple pages to confirm that it was about hunting and he flipped to the last entry.
“What’s this boy’s name, Jack?” Cas growled. He was clearly angered at the thought of anyone messing with his son.
Jack’s mood improved once he had food in front of him; it turns out that Jody’s pot roast was just as delicious as Sam and Dean described. It was one of the best meals he’d eaten in his entire life. His two years of eating take out and Winchester surprise paled in comparison to Jody’s cooking. The rich flavors of the meat, carrots, and potatoes left a pleasant warm feeling flowing through his body. It left him feeling so nice that he couldn’t even bother to care about the judgmental looks all four women gave as Sam, Dean, and Jack simultaneously moaned around each bite of food. He felt bad for Castiel who just watched them all eat with a fond look while taking small sips from his bottle of beer. He silently thanked his mother for the bit of humanity that allowed him to enjoy the taste of food.
“Like I said there’s not much. Jack just likes spending time with you and if you get mad at him for that then you're the asshole. All you can do is wait for a time when he’s not with you. He doesn’t come on every hunt with us and you can slip out whenever you want, but until an opportunity like that comes you’re just going to have to wait.”
“At least if he slips up here, he won’t get arrested,” Dean quipped. “And believe me, that kid slips up a lot.”
“I felt suspicious about you from the moment you woke up, something about you just felt… different. After that I just paid close attention to every weird question you asked throughout the day. Then I made up my theory by connecting all of my clues together. I mean it isn’t rocket science. I didn’t pull the djinn out of nowhere, you were the one to bring it up first.” Cas said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Jack and Claire had been going back and forth on this for the past hour. It was a big change from the excitement he felt when he started this conversation. That all disappeared when Claire told him her genius plan.
The worst part was, she couldn’t figure out what she did wrong. She replayed that last phone call with Jack over and over in her mind and everytime she concluded that she was innocent.
The photo could have been entirely possible except for one person that caught Dean’s eye from the beginning. Standing next to Sam was the love of his brother’s life, Jessica Moore, alive and safe with a big smile on her face. The bottom of the picture frame said “Our Family” printed in cursive and he felt his heart ache wishing that this was real.
“Cause you kinda sounded like you were trying to say… B-but you couldn’t possibly mean that…” Dean sounded like he was about to freak out and Jack couldn’t understand why. Castiel’s words had made him feel all warm and excited, but Dean’s face looked like he was feeling anything but that.
“Why not?” Dean asked feeling as if there was a story behind this. The idea of Sam and his Dad not getting along in this world didn’t come as a shock to him. Although without hunting, Dean couldn’t imagine what they would have to fight about.
Sam chuckled. “Yeah I can see what you mean. Here, we’re all each other has. I mean when it’s good, it’s really great. But when it’s bad - “
“Okay. That does sound pleasant.” Castiel stood up from his chair, but hesitated instead of walking towards Dean. He realized that the angel was feeling nervous and he was relieved to know that he wasn’t the only one.
“Goodnight Dean.” The angel remained firmly seated in his chair clearly not getting the hint. Dean groaned. He had no idea why he expected Cas to understand that, as if he wasn’t aware that he had a history of misinterpreting social cues.
Jack felt his stomach unclench when they managed to make it back to the house before the Winchesters, Castiel, and the sheriff. They sat back at the table and opened their computers to make it look like they had actually done research.
“Hey!” Jack protested, recognizing the insult for what it was. He was getting tired of people assuming that he was naive because of his age. He knew that there was a lot about the world he didn’t know, but that didn’t mean he knew nothing. He wasn’t a child that knew nothing outside of sunshine and rainbows.
The hunter rolled his eyes. “Sorry buddy, but if your cat gifs to Sam are so private then you shouldn’t leave your phone in the middle of the table for everyone to see.”
There was a long silence that rang out, neither of them daring to speak. Jack was feeling nervous, this conversation was not going how he expected it to.
The conversation was interrupted by Sam walking into the room and dropping a pile of glasses in front of them, “Alright. Here are five pairs of glasses that I ran through holy fire. The fifth pair is for Jack. You probably won’t need it, but since we don’t know for sure if you can see hellhounds, you should have them just in case.”
“Can you change it to literally anything else?” she whined. This was the last thing she needed to be watching. It was the movie that got her into this mess.
“Look, I’m sorry that we didn’t tell you where we were going, but I didn’t think Claire’s plan was stupid,” Jack defended, rubbing where Dean had hit him. “The deaths wouldn’t have stopped unless the demon was dead. Also, it’s smarter to attack her before we killed her hellhound. If we waited until after she would have been on to us and left.”
“Son of a bitch…” Dean cursed before pulling Cas in for a kiss. This wasn’t the first time he was kissing this Cas, but before it had felt like he was just playing the character of domestic Dean. Something about Cas knowing the truth made this one feel more real. It was dream Cas kissing real Dean. It was nice, there was a passion on both receiving ends that wasn’t there before.
“I can stay awake with you Dean,” Jack offered. “I’m half angel which means I only need half the sleep.”
“Oh look we’re here,” Dean said abruptly pulling the car into park and practically flying out the door.
“I did whatever dumb shit you wanted me to. Now it’s time to pay up.” Jack’s eyes widened, Claire never mentioned that he was supposed to pay him. He didn’t have any money and even if he did he didn’t know the amount she promised him.
“Jack wait,” Dean sighed, stopping Jack as he was reaching for the handle. “I’m sorry for getting mad at you like that. I feel like an asshole. It's a sensitive subject for me, but that is not your fault.”
“Of course kiddo, now get some sleep.” Dean smiled and kiss the boy on the forehead. He listened to Jack’s soft breathing until he was sure the child was asleep.
“If it helps, I’ll let you get final say on the guy I pick,” Claire suggested kindly and Jack agreed.
Dean continues to find a way out of the dream world, but only gets sucked further into it. Cas grows suspicious of Dean's weird behavior.
“Laying it on a little thick Dean,” Sam muttered under his breath low enough that only Jack heard it.
Jack went to check his phone, knowing that this argument could last for hours. He saw a text from Claire telling him to call her when it was done. Wanting nothing more than to be anywhere else he realized that calling Claire was the perfect excuse for him to leave.
“Uhh. I hate to break up your guys’ moment, but the doctor’s going to come in and check Dean over so he can clear him to go home.” Sam told them.
He quickly opened his eyes at the sound of somebody calling his name. He was sitting in the same position he had fallen asleep in with dream Jack and Cas glued to his side. The TV had turned to a soft static, the movie had ended hours ago. He felt a chill on the back of his neck and felt as if he was being watched. He carefully stood up from his place on the couch and turned around.
“Your in a hospital, so no your not home technically.” Dean rolled his eyes at the angel’s bluntness.
“It was… enlightening,” Jack gritted out the last part as he thought back to the text Sam sent Claire. He wasn’t necessarily mad at Sam, since he never actually lied to him and it wasn’t like the subject was life threatening. But he also couldn’t help but feel bitter about the fact that Sam asked Claire not to tell him specifically. He didn’t mean to give a petty response to Sam’s innocent question, it just came out naturally.
“Well it’s good to know everyone agrees with me for once,” Dean groaned. “What about you Jack? Are you okay?” Dean glanced at him through the rearview mirror.
“I’m Jack Winchester and my Daddy is Dean Winchester and my Papa is Cast… Cas Winchester.” The little kid stated. Castiel ruffled the kid’s hair a little.
“We’ll see…” Dean looked at the ground. The more he thought about the situation, the more he realized that there might not be a way out. At least not for him. He could try expelling him out of his body, except Michael had gotten one thing right, he wasn’t sure he wanted him gone. Obviously he wanted him dead and he absolutely hated being an archangel condom. But what would expelling him really solve? All that would happen is Michael would possess another innocent person and continue to wreak havoc on this world. Dean couldn’t let another person suffer for his sake. He’d rather die. And he had a feeling that it might come down to that.
“What else were we supposed to do Jody? You guys were so focused on killing that stupid hellhound, even though killing it solves nothing as long as the demon is still alive. We knew going after the demon was more helpful than sitting around playing backup for you guys,” Claire argued.
Dean closed his eyes feeling a sense of safety and serenity that he hadn’t felt in years. The road ahead of them looked darker and dimmer by each passing day, but in this moment he could pretend that everything would turn out okay.The feeling of a solid warm body next to him was enough to keep him grounded and reassured him that this was indeed real life.
“Are you guys done yet?” he heard a voice say. “So we can actually talk about the case.” A girl walked into the room with long wavy blonde hair that brushed over her red flannel shirt. She was wearing a lot of eyeliner and an old shirt from a band Jack never heard of.
It's only been a week and I already miss Supernatural oof. Anyways, I hope everyone is doing well and I hope you enjoy this chapter!
“I don’t think so,” Jack started slowly, “I confronted her about it and since then she’s been a lot nicer.”
“You guys know a lot about me, but I don’t know that much about you. You’ve known each other for nine years longer than I have and you’ve barely told me anything that happened,” Jack said honestly. He really did want to know more about their past. They would only tell them a bullet point version. Cas raised Dean from hell, the Winchester’s started and stopped the apocalypse twice, God came back then left again, then Jack was born. He had a gut feeling that there was a lot they were leaving out.
Hello everyone! I hope you've been having a good 2021! So, this chapter and the next chapter were originally supposed to be one chapter, but it was getting to be too long so I decided to split it up. So hopefully the next chapter should be up soon since it is almost finished.
“No, the people aren’t this bad. A lot of it is overdramatized,” she told him, picking up another slice of pepperoni pizza.
Dean glanced over to where the angel was sitting awkwardly at the library table, clearly unsure of what he should do, and he chuckled. “I don’t think any life with Cas could be considered normal.”
“That’s ok. If she doesn’t want to watch Star Wars we can watch Sleeping Beauty. I like that one too.”
While Bobby gave Sam a pat on the back, saying “I’m proud of you son,” Dean noticed Cas whispering something into Jack’s ear. Whatever it was, it made the kid grin and nod his head enthusiastically. After, that he hopped off Dean’s lap and walked over to Jess. He motioned for her to lean down to his height, then he gave her a big kiss on the cheek.
She gave him a sad smile, “Word of advice: next time you want to get laid, don’t bring your entire family with you. It scares off girls like me,” then she walked away.
“Not much. He seemed rather disoriented. He said he felt “like crap”, then he asked for you, and then he asked what happened to him.” Cas answered.
The second the door opened Claire whipped around and stared at him in shock. Jack gave a satisfied smile back.
“Jack might be new, but he’s smart. He’s done it with us enough times that he knows what to look for,” Dean defended the boy, who was currently staring at his shoes like they were the most interesting thing in the world. “Just trust our process kid, we have a pretty good success rate.”
The girls continued to raid him with random questions about Sam, Dean, and Castiel. They ranged from really strange to personal information that not even Jack would know the answer to.
If the Winchester’s wanted her to do research, then she would do research. Although she wouldn’t be researching the case. Instead, she researched creatures with glowing yellow eyes.
“It’s okay I totally understand. I have two sons of my own and they get sick all of the time.” She smiled and touched Dean’s hand. Jack considered throwing up on the floor to get them out of here quicker, but his better judgement decided against it.
Dean looked at Cas and could tell he was trying to come up with an answer. It wasn’t like he could tell Sam the truth, he wouldn’t get it.
“How?” Alex asked, staring at her like she was crazy, but Claire didn’t care, her mind was already far away.
“You seriously killed a Prince of Hell? By yourself?” She was almost impressed and a little confused.
“Of course I know what a djinn is.” Castiel studied him for a second. “I’ll tell you exactly how I know if you promise to put the knife down.” Son of a bitch. Why the hell was this Cas so damn smart?
“Is dad coming?” Dean asked. He knew his dad was probably dead. If he was alive he would’ve been in the photo and his mom wouldn’t be with Bobby. He had to ask anyway. If Jess was alive who knows who else could be.
The next morning, Jack found Dean in the Bunker’s garage working underneath the hood of the Impala. Jack slowly walked over to him. “Hello!” He said cheerfully, he needed to make sure the hunter was in a good mood.
“Thank you Sam. I appreciate your concern, but I think I would like to stay,” he gave Sam an honest smile. He really did appreciate his worry and he might have even taken him up on the offer if it weren’t for Claire’s plan. Bars were noisy and filled with inebriated people, going back to the motel for a quiet night in with just the four of them was preferable. “It helps to take my mind off things,” he lied, wishing he was anywhere else.
“So, are you in for the movie or are you just going to cry into your books all night?” Claire teased, going back to her question.
“So, that’s it? We’re just going to sit back and do nothing?” said Claire, clearly annoyed by the Winchesters.
“Woah buddy, slow down. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around the whole ‘we’re dating’ situation. Also, I wasn’t kidding when I said that I need to sleep. I was just hoping that you would sleep with me...literally.”
“Fine. But, you two have to stay here.” Castiel said firmly. “The second you see any sign of the hellhound run inside and warn us. Do not try to fight it by yourself. You are not it’s target, so it will not come after you unless it senses that you’re a threat.”
Castiel smiled. “I understand. I am still trying to grasp the topic myself. Feelings are still very new to me and I’m still trying to come to terms with my own. What they mean and why I feel a certain way.” That seemed rather vague to him, but he nodded for the angel to continue. “I suppose the way I feel about you is different from the way I feel about Dean and that’s different from the way I feel about Sam. Although I know that I love you all very much. The way I feel about you is similar to the way a father loves his son. I’ve watched you grow from the moment you were born and I feel an overwhelming urge to protect you from any harm.
“We’re having a sleepover, we have all night to do that. Besides, you dumbasses really need my help fixing things around here,” she said assertively.
Which is why, instead of giving Dean a proper answer, he gave him a small smile and nod of understanding before hurrying inside the Bunker. He headed straight to his room and closed the door. Jack paced back and forth, trying to get his feelings in order. He needed to let out this slowly building mass of emotions in a safe matter and that usually meant curling into a ball and crying. But the angry part of him didn’t want to cry. He already felt enough shame today and crying would only make it worse. He only stopped pacing once he noticed the light bulb above his head was beginning to rapidly flicker. He took a deep breath, the last thing he wanted was to lose control. He didn’t think he could accidentally hurt someone from inside his room, but an exploding light bulb would be hard to explain.
“Woah, uh no. First off, you’re not real. This is all just some weird fantasy my mind made up. Secondly, you’re human and Cas is an angel. Angels can’t…” Dean suddenly stopped. A realization had suddenly struck his mind. “Angels… that’s it!”
“Yeah I am.” Dean smiled. There was a part of him that was still itching to find another way back, but reason tamed that part by reminding him that Sam and Cas would come for him eventually. They always did.
“Yes,” the blonde pressed. “We can’t exactly get him with Castiel if he’s sleeping with other people.” Jack sighed already knowing this would be a losing battle.
“Based on past experience, when Sam and Dean tell people they’re in danger, it usually leads to  a lot of follow up questions.” Cas shrugged.
“I said that I think you’re right. Killing the hellhound might save Casey, but it doesn’t stop anything. We will have to kill the demon at some point and the sooner we do it, the less chance he has of killing anyone else. Besides, Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Jody are skilled hunters and they don’t need us to stop one hellhound. We’re helping more people if we do this now,” Jack explained. He still didn’t like the idea of going behind the Winchester’s backs and ignoring Castiel’s request, but he couldn’t let Claire do this alone. Going solo is what got the last hunter killed after all. “Also, I thought that we were hunting buddies.”
The drive to Sam’s house was quiet while Cas would sneak worried glances in Dean’s direction. He had made things worse when he asked Cas to put Sam’s address into the GPS on his phone since he had no clue where Sam lived. He reasoned that he was hoping the GPS would give him the fastest route. He thought it was a normal request until Cas argued that Sam lived close enough that it would be pointless. Luckily for him Castiel eventually gave in, but he could tell it only made his fake husband more suspicious.
“Um…” He thought about it. “I’m not sure. He does have his own bottle that he keeps in his room and no one else is allowed to use it.” Jack answered, not fully understanding the purpose of this game. Was the point to share useless facts about the people he lives with?
“Dean, if you knew what was going on out there-“ Sam started, but Dean cut him off looking his brother in the eyes for the first time.
The next morning the Bunker was quiet, everyone was keeping to themselves in their own corners, and Jack figured it was a good time to try out his plan. He found Castiel lying in his bed watching cat videos on Sam’s laptop softly giggling to himself.
Jack lifted his head from where it was leaning against the window as he felt the Impala roll to a stop. He stretched out the ache in his neck from the uncomfortable position he’d been in for the past hour. By now he’d been on many long and boring road trips with the Winchester’s, this one being far from the worst; and he still had not found a comfortable way to rest in a car. He asked Sam for advice, but all he enclosed was that the last good sleep he had in a car was when he was five. He warned that, “It never gets better, you just get more tired.” Jack was starting to see his point.
“I didn’t need your help. I can take care of myself.” Castiel finally spoke up and he did not sound happy.
“I can always grab one of my ID’s from inside of the Impala,” Jack suggested. “I have a bunch and none of them are real anyway.”
“What was the point of all this anyway?” Dean gestured around the room. “Giving me a happy life, making me think there was a djinn, what kind of sick game are you playing?”
“Stop it!” He said suddenly, when he realized that he finally had their attention he continued. “First of all, I don’t understand why everyone is so concerned with what I eat? I eat fine. Sure I eat like that when I’m with Dean, but Sam makes me eat healthy on occasion. He also doesn’t let me eat a lot of sugar, although Castiel does when he’s not around. S-second, Dean makes sure the Bunker is super clean. One time, it was my turn to do the dishes and I forgot. Then when Dean came home from a hunt and saw the dirty dishes he got mad and told me I was ‘grounded.’ Although, I’m still not sure what that means.” He stopped talking once he realized he was rambling at this point. He felt his face heat up when he saw all three girls giving him odd looks.
“I can’t say that I have any experience with relationships, but I do know that humans tend to make things more complicated than necessary.” Dean laughed at Cas’ comment because despite the angel’s bluntness, it was extremely accurate. “I like you and you like me. Isn’t that all that truly matters? We’ll figure the rest out from there.”
He looked around the house at all the family pictures. They were mainly pictures of Jack at different ages, looking like he had a proper childhood. There were photos of him playing at the park, covered in dirt, with chocolate stains smudged around his mouth. He had scabs on his knees and a big grin that showcased his missing teeth. Everything that Jack Kline had missed out on.
He casually sat down near the elder Winchester and set Cas phone towards the center of the table. Then he pulled out a book and innocently pretended to be reading it.
“I mean I don’t want to sit on my ass all day doing research. I’ve been researching this case for weeks! I want to actually do something.”
“I suppose that’s true. Although I don’t know why you…” Cas paused once he noticed the phone in Dean’s hand. “Why do you have my phone?”
Why would Sam not want Claire to tell him? The thought made him feel a twinge of irritation towards the younger Winchester. He hated when they kept information from him as if he was too fragile to handle it. Sam was usually the most forthcoming with Jack and always said he deserved to know the full truth. Then here he was treating him like a baby and it caused Jack to feel a hint of betrayal. He was pulled from his thoughts by Claire speaking up.
“Don’t worry Jack, I’ll rescue you from these monsters,” Dean sounded serious to Jack, but when he heard the sound of the girls laughing behind him, he figured he must have been joking. When they reached the hallway, Dean lowered his voice, “But seriously kid, are you okay? You looked a little spooked back there.”
“Oh yeah. Dean thinks he keeps his feelings locked away, but he’s usually pretty obvious. At least to me he is,” Sam answered with a fond look in his eye.
“Still aches a little, but don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.” Jack eyed the bandage on Dean’s head sadly.
“Um…” Jack thought about how he should reply. He knew he couldn’t tell the truth, but he didn’t want to make up a total lie. “Why not?” he shrugged trying to buy himself extra time.
“I wouldn’t have left you,” Dean said softly. “I would have taken you home and came back when her shift ended,” he added with a playful smirk. Jack didn’t mind. He was used to Dean adding a crude joke to prevent the conversation from becoming too emotional.
“Yeah, but you don’t know all of it,” Dean mumbled. “Look,” he continued only louder, “when I was a kid, around four years old, my parents used to fight all of the time. They didn’t give a damn about if I was there or not. They probably assumed I was too young to understand it, but I wasn’t. I knew they were fighting; and that memory has stayed with me since. It’s one of the few memories I have of my parents being together and I hate it. I hate that it’s what I think of, but it is. Looking back on it I can’t help but think that maybe if I wasn’t there, I would have a better memory in its place.
“I guess his plan was to summon the demon on the day Casey’s deal was up. He must have thought that he could take on a demon and a hellhound by himself, but obviously he couldn’t,” Jack said with a sigh. It always made him sad when he thought too hard about the victims. It made him wonder if the hunter had a family and if they would ever get a chance to read his poems. Did they even know he was a hunter? Would they ever find out what happened to him? “Here. He wrote down the crossroads that he summoned the demon,” he showed Claire the book, she knew this area better than he did.
Jack loudly started to cough into the crook of his elbow. He tried to make it sound as realistic as he could without actually gagging. He coughed until “Cindy” walked away with a grossed out expression.
Instead of answering her question he sighed, “Look, I know you think I’m new and I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m not useless. I know how to hunt and I think I’m good at it. Sam and Dean have taught me a lot.”
“Before we left you said something about winning a bet, what was that about?” Sam asked him. Jack internally cursed himself for not being more careful. He was less prepared to answer this, but he still came up with a believable story.
“What the hell was that Dean?” Sam said as soon as they sat down. “You were acting kinda over aggressive.”
Cas took a few steps closer to him until he was practically invading Dean’s personal space. “Unless you’re talking about Jack being full grown, then no there really isn’t.” This time Dean took a step backwards shaking his head.
“Yeah well, I guess whenever I picture you living the good life, I imagine you with her.” Which was true. The closest Sam ever had to a normal life was when he was at Stanford and Dean knew how happy she made his brother.
“Don’t worry. With both of us looking I’m sure we’ll find something soon,” Jack gave her an encouraging smile that only made her more irritated.
“Yeah, like that’ll be easy. His whole personality is off.” Alex quipped with an eye roll as she went back to her room.
And despite being a Preschooler, he was into a lot of stuff Dean liked. He could only assume it stemmed from his own influence. His favorite movie was Star Wars, his favorite superhero was Batman, and he even shared his love of cowboys. Although, Jack’s favorite was Woody instead of Clint Eastwood. When Jack got bored of playing with toys, all Dean had to do was tune the television to old Scooby Doo reruns and Jack was entertain for another hour. Soon enough, Cas came into the room and told him it was almost time to go to Sam’s house.
