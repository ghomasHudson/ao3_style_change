‘I have missed you both,’ Mrs Hudson said after she’d inhaled deeply from her fag, looking a bit misty round the eyes as she reached to hold John’s trembling hand.
‘Kiss me,’ Sherlock murmured, grabbing John’s shirt sleeve, pulling him closer. ‘John, kiss me.’
‘Yes, spare me trivial details, what do you already know?’ Sherlock pivoted and shone his torch in Lestrade’s face, who squinted and backed away from the light. ‘Or think you know, sorry,’ he said, illuminating the barrels and crates in the cellar rather than Lestrade’s nasal hair.
‘Don’t you ever try and talk to me again,’ Sherlock spat, stalking over to where John stood, chatting kindly with a couple who were clearly Frank’s parents.
reached its end and began to hiss. It was a sunny day for March and the usually gloomy kitchen was bathed in a warm light that came from both its own window as well as the windows in the living room. Sherlock’s hair was tinted auburn where he stood, slipping the record back into its sleeve, humming under his breath. John’s hair was blonder than usual and the lines on his face less deep.
‘Nettle,’ John murmured, his tone almost pleading.
"Ah." Sherlock's voice was clearly trying to be calm. "Care to share?"
Cheers,
(See the end of the chapter for
Then the impact came.
Ireni explains her reappearance, and asks to complete a favour.
Very reluctantly, Sherlock let go of John and watched him get dressed. He’d watched him do that dozens of times in six months; why did it feel so wonderful to watch John pull a jumper on?
Sherlock didn't even bother protesting. "You know me too well."
Cheers,
Nonplussed, John looked toward Sherlock. Sherlock's eyes were narrowed, fixed on the girl, but there was still no aggression in his posture.
“What do you have planned?”
“The hell it isn’t. You care for him more than you ever want to and so you hide behind the same cold look you give everyone else, because,
Molly hesitated. “You are a Princess. And I am a commoner.”
"Kitty, you could have been hurt!"
Roger Dimmock is rather cold to Stan at first, but he gets the pronouns right and offers him lodging and a job, so Stan puts up with it. It takes about six days to realize that Dimmock thought he was their mutually disliked cousin Stephanie, not ‘Eliza’. They’d been mistaken for twins as children, so Stan managed to forgive the confusion. He still never lets Roger live it down. (“How the hell did you think I was Steph?” “Your…hair was different.” “You don’t say!”)
He took her inside the alehouse. “No more wine,” he told her sternly as he set her in a booth.
John looked at Sally, whose eyes were wide with fear. “Do you not like boats, Sally?”
When Maria was twenty-five, having crossed several countries walking through nights and sleeping from dawn to just before noon, she was forced to admit that it was very hard indeed. Ten years was a long time. What if the six fingered man had sailed across the ocean?
“Slow going?” She tried again.
“You never said we were killing anyone,” Grezzik said, horrified.
“Really?” John couldn’t stop the smile that spread across his face. “That’s wonderful! So what’s the prob—oh.”
The man in black seemed to notice, and yanked him forward, making Sherlock stumble. The man pushed him onto a rock. “Catch your breath.”
(See the end of the chapter for
(I mean if you've read my stuff so far you know I wouldn't hurt a wee smol...grownups, on the other hand, are very much fair game).
For Arvi, who asked for more Billy (congrats on finishing all your finals!)
“I know you don’t. You think your daughter’s gone.”
She loved him fiercely, even twenty years after his death. It was just the two of them when she was small, her mother gone before her first smile.
“Grezzik,” Maria said desperately, because the scream was starting to fade, “please, help!”
Watson had been very cold about it, colder still when Holmes explained that Watson didn't need to go. Why subject both of them to an uncomfortable train ride?
Sherlock nodded. “Come, John, Anderson. We’ve got a long trek ahead of us.”
“He’s out looking for feverfew,” Martha explained in a low voice. “She’s getting much hotter than I like.”
"Excuse me," John said, and once more attempted to move around her. This time she deliberately blocked his path.
“I want to,” she said frankly. “It’s my home, Hell or not, and with a new face I might be able to find another start.”
When Molly Hooper was thirty-six she stared at her wedding invitations and wrote
“No problem. I’m a healer, that’s what I do.”
“She’ll do,” Sherlock said, looking away.
This, apparently, was even funnier than what Grandad John said.
And then Molly saw the girl change.
The lovers reunite, and John has his own revenge to take.
“I beg your pardon?”
“Your funeral.” Moran stepped aside.
"Nothing. I want to give them to the horses."
John stepped away from him. “I need to leave.”
It opened onto a small sitting room with two armchairs close to the fire. A bookcase stood next to the wall, all of their books neatly organized. The kitchen was just through the next door, a bright, airy space with two large windows overlooking the sea.
They were ringing so badly he didn’t hear the giant until he was right in front of him and there was a blade at his throat.
Sherlock buried his face in John’s chest. “I won’t go with him, John. I won’t.”
“The bed’s too small.”
“We haven’t received a letter in a while,” Watson said slowly, worried. The Inspector had been forced to retire due to poor health, and had gone off to Scotland to live with his daughter.
Despite his joke to John, Mike loves to teach, and he’ll often borrow John’s case stories to illustrate different aspects of medicine. He had Sherlock in as a guest speaker once. Once.
Holmes leaned into the touch. "You said you were going to go away for Christmas," he said quietly.
“Take this.”
That was the first time Molly had ever heard him say that.
“Good afternoon,” Ireni called.
With that troubling thought, Sally closed her eyes.
With Molly's help, Sherlock positioned the dead body near the window and draped the dusty curtains over it. Moriarty wouldn't come into this room, but it would be the first place Sherlock would run to, if this building were really on fire. Finding the body here, burned beyond recognition and identified tearfully by John, would raise little suspicion.
For a second Sally felt at ease, and the noises of combat fell away outside. This was her father, the King she’d known all her life. He had calm even in this moment, so she could find it too.
Maria walked up to Grezzik as they got ready to cast off. “Ireni, she can whine,” she whispered.
Watson swallowed hard as he cradled the baby close. Quiet as anything, Billy blinked up at him, big blue eyes like his mother's assessing this new face. 'Hello, Billy," Watson said, voice thick. "Welcome to this world." He rocked the child for a moment. "Shall I introduce you to your other namesake?"
"When you like and where you like," Watson said playfully.
What is the mystery song? Will the wedding go well? Tune in next time for the answer to one of those questions, and the time after for the other! (I swear it makes sense). Cheers!
“What can I do?”
Ireni’s eyes widened. “And he took that and ran with it, didn’t he?”
Sherlock furrowed his brow. “John, you must listen, and you cannot interrupt, alright? Not until I have finished.”
Cheers,
“Oh, yes I am.”
“Then explain me.” Watson cradled Holmes’ head with one hand. “Explain how you have given me entertainment and kindness and affection. How you have given your heart, dangerous as it is.” He drew back just enough to look Holmes in the eye. “You deserve to seek comfort for the pain in your heart, Sherlock. And I’m here, I’m right here.”
Cheers, Acme
Sally bit her lip. “I…I figured it out. No one’s threatened me, but—”
“Your parents can’t afford to pay me. It’s alright, but I want to give us a good life, you know? I want to travel and see the world with you. I’ve been planning it just in case you…well, just in case you ever noticed me.”
Angelo directed them to ‘their’ table, which was always free any time they went to Angelo’s. John suspected Sherlock of making a standing reservation.
"And you expressed the same. I'm not sure what you're asking me," Watson said carefully.
The man in black bowed. “What can I do for you?”
“I’ll tell him about your alliances—he knew about Sanctaphrax, but not Regalia or Archenland. I’ll tell him about your guards, and how you don’t know how to deal with magic.”
“Of course not! Don’t be stupid, we’ll break our necks. No, if they come out alive, they’ll come out on the far end. We’ll wait there.”
“Yes?”
Sherlock looked at John, who was smiling shyly. “We really chose the same song?”
But….
Hadn't he the right to be cheerful?
"Gruner is announcing his engagement to Delia day after tomorrow." Sherlock's lips were tense. "And he never marries with another Blossom alive."
“GREZZIK, PLEASE!”
“Rather that I love Sherlock.”
“Sherlock, I’ve thought long and hard about what I wanted to say to you, because all you said was ‘could be dangerous’…and here I am. Here we are. I want to tell you that I'll wake up every morning with you and solve crimes and watch bad telly and hold hands at crime scenes, and I know that I want to give you everything you want from me, but…dear, I mean so much more than that. I suppose the best thing I can tell you now is that I was so alone, and now I’m not, and I am so grateful that we are together. And I swear that I will tell you that every day of our lives in as many ways as I can think of, and show you when I can’t tell you anymore, because I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and I always will.”
“Can’t you tell us apart yet?”
“Whoever he is, it’s too late. Look! The Cliffs of Insanity!”
"Ah, you enjoy verbal sparring as foreplay," Sherlock guessed.
“That was beautiful,” Grezzik whispered.
“Grezzik!” Maria shouted. “That is the Man in Black!”
“You know more about music than I do!”
John came in less than an hour later with a strong feverfew tea, and Sally drank it all. Her fever came down hard, leaving her weak and chilled, but that went away soon.
“Oh yes?”
Well, now that Waverly's home, there'll be no more drama, right?
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not going to marry Prince Jamiarty. I’m free to marry John. I suppose you won’t be needed.”
That made Sherlock’s blood run hot for the first time in years. “I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.”
Grezzik blinked a few times, but it was definitely a bird. Large enough that he sat comfortably on its back. It was bright red, its feathers shining in the sunlight, and was clearly carrying them to the top.
“Oh no! Is she better now?”
The King patted his shoulder when he reached the door. “Jamiarty will be along soon,” he promised.
Warning for character death.
The prince did, shoving the pale man to the ground. He tossed the knife on the table and drew his sword. “To the death.”
Sally hadn’t run since before she was pregnant.
And she did, and she laughed, little arms coming out to him. Grezzik made a silly face at her, the wind roaring through his ears. He continued to flutter-kick. The beach was rushing towards them, but Grezzik didn’t panic. He would get to Waverly, and he would hold her in his arms and shield her from the impact.
The basement of the Zoo of Death, far below the animals Jamiarty had collected to kill, was the Pit of Despair.
The fog became even thicker, far too quickly to be natural, and Holmes drew Watson down the path. When they looked back a moment later, the fog was beginning to clear, the lamplight was normal and their strange meeting was over.
“Mummy said we can go to the zoo with Daddy tomorrow, and we can see the pretty birds! That’s better than a fairy!”
Uh oh...
Should he have seen that coming? Billy thought about it. He was, after all, being trained by both his Mum and Grandfather Sherlock to be observant. But if everyone was trying to keep it secret…and he hadn’t known men could be in love with each other. Billy decided he could be forgiven missing that.
“But why?”
“Well, that’s not true.” Janine nodded to a guard. The guard curtseyed and opened the door.
Then, as luck would have it, Sherlock came in the door. Mycroft and Greg were with him, hand in hand. The room went completely silent.
Stam the albino shuddered as he picked up his wheelbarrow. He had to dispose of Watson’s body, but his ears were still ringing with the man’s cry. “Damn shame,” he muttered, feeling guilty all over again as the words came out easily, soothed by the man’s recommendation of tea and honey.
“Have you heard from Mycroft?” Molly asked hesitantly. “Maybe something came up?”
“How are we going to delay things?” Anderson asked.
Holmes smiled at him with a tenderness he usually had to hide and squeezed his hand. He took his own ring out of his ‘pocket-watch’ and put it on his free hand. “Lead on, my dear John.”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around and smiled tolerantly. “Apologies, my dear John. It appears we had the same goal.”
“No, Sherlock.” Mycroft's voice was sharp with alarm. “I was calling to inquire why the good doctor abandoned the plan of joining me here. I thought he went with you.”
Grezzik fought the pain of the burns, but the woman—a witch, she must be a witch—raised her hand, and the fire vanished. She was suddenly airborne, high above Grezzik, high above the castle.
"John."
“I love you.”
“Feels like it.” John cleared his throat. “So since it’s a small wedding, there won’t be much for you to do—we’ve got a place picked out, Mrs. Hudson is insisting on cooking…”
Billy promised eagerly.
much.” He pressed a kiss to the back of Watson’s neck.
"What?" John looked up. "But it was thrown from outside."
“This being your first time, I’ll use the lowest setting.”
? You’re one up on my Holmes.”
“But Ireni is dead.”
John tilted Riley’s head back, holding her firmly in place when she tried to thrash. He tipped two drops onto her tongue, and then stepped back. The woman spat, but her spit was clear. She’d already swallowed the potion. Her body relaxed in the chair, and she smiled at them all. “Hello!”
Sherlock led him into the room where they’d looked over their first dead body together. The room was empty other than a bright light clearly nicked from Scotland Yard and a chair with a folded up newspaper on it.
Grezzik helped him off his shoulders and set him down. Ireni was kneeling next to the rope, sawing at it with a knife. Sherlock wanted to cry out—
"Mrs. Hudson. Greg."
Cheers,
“Sherlock?” John sounded tired and…sore, the way he sounded after a long day of work and chasing criminals. Sherlock’s heart ached in response.
"Or incredibly awkward," John put in. Sherlock shuddered, remembering That Afternoon.
“I will not.”
Watson bowed his head. “Not a problem.” He got to his feet, still looking at the ground.
Watson, Holmes, John and Sherlock have an ordinary day.
The other two were still. It was impossible to tell what they were thinking with the swirling fog around.
It surrounded her like a dozen woodpeckers in the spring, barely piercing the mist that sheathed her ears. Everything felt numb and far away. Perhaps she was dying—she’d heard you could do that. Die from a broken heart.
Sherlock nodded absently. His breath was still too shallow and fast for John’s liking, so John kept one hand in his partner’s while he typed.
“Grezzik!” Molly snapped.
“I thought I could shelter Waverly from the crash,” Grezzik explained. “But Ireni caught us before we landed.”
“Right,” Molly said. “Sorry.”
“Brides generally are when they pack for their honeymoon.”
“Mol—Maria?” Grezzik whispered.
"The firsts have always been good, with you," Sherlock mused. His voice had dropped almost an octave. "I think we should make love now."
When they got to Greenland, though, he encountered the toughest crowd.

Cheers,
Note: I hope I have made this as historically accurate as the internet (sans Bradshaw) allows me to be, and any liberties taken are entirely artistic (also we are in a world of dreamwalking gay detective-doctors, history may be rewritten a tad).
Grezzik rubbed his arms. "I'll go tend to the horses and get food. Does anyone want anything in particular?"
John tried to collect his thoughts. "Which question?"
"Oi, what's the idea, Donovan? I'm trying to—"
Luckily, the Pit was clean. Even the Machine was gone. It was hardly empty though, with nineteen Female carriers staring up at him. They were all chained to tables. One of them was bleeding.
“Well, I wish you the best of retirement,” Mycroft said. There was a pause. “Do you need something from me?”
Molly looked at Grezzik. “You’ll carry the King.”
Molly kissed her tumbling hair. “You will have to send me away,
The Queen joined her husband. “You did have a child, then? How lovely.” A strange look crossed her face. “Not Jamiarty, I imagine.”
John shook his head. “No.”
“Where’s that fool husband of hers?” Max snarled. “At this rate the child will be blessed before its father comes!”
John rolled his eyes. “So did I, love, and you know it. It was wonderful.” A whole month without cases, without interruptions…they’d had a golden honeymoon.
“And Mycroft and I will handle the rest,” Greg finished. He stood up. “Don’t worry, John. We’ll give you a good wedding. God knows you deserve one.”
“What?! Oh, I
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know the house!" Kitty snapped. "I can show you the way!"
“I thought it might be interesting to meet your Sherlock’s Mycroft,” Holmes said. “I imagine there are some similarities, though from the way you describe him there are some marked differences. I am, of course, willing to supply my own.”
“Inconceivable,” Ireni said.
“No, nothing. Go on, now.”
“You don’t know who I am.” Kitty’s face was drawn with fear as she stared up at Hopkins. “If you knew…”
The giant picked him up and slung him over his shoulders. Sherlock felt a rope go around his legs, and another around his shoulders.
“Your brother called, by the way,” Mrs. Hudson said at last.
“My father was that gardener.” Riley’s shoulders slumped. “My wrists hurt.”
“Getting the last bit of evidence,” Grezzik murmured back. “Now shush.”
Warning for briefly suicidal Sherlock.
“I don’t love him John.” Sherlock was panicking now. “I swear to you, I never wanted to marry him, but you were dead, and he ordered me to, and…”
“We’ll be fine. We can’t do anything until nightfall anyways.”
Lestrade drew an envelope from his pocket. Mycroft’s breath caught; he recognized it. He’d buried it.
The first time Sally screamed, everyone jumped. She’d moaned and whimpered, but this was the first raw, broken cry. And it wasn’t because of pain.
And if anyone wanted to fight him on it…well, he still ran rooftops twice a week. They were welcome to try.
Well, perhaps he would visit, but only to torment Watson.
He didn’t care.
A few years later, Molly returned to that town. Waverly had a new husband, a newly-man named Tristan, and a baby at her breast. When Molly asked about the woman that night, Waverly shrugged. “I didn’t notice her, sorry. And we don’t have many Natives living around here, and none fit that description.”
Grandad John gasped, clutching Billy to his chest. "Did you hear that, Billy? Understanding of social customs and an acknowledgement that the Earth goes around the Sun, all at once! Your grandfather's learning!"
Sherlock reached out for his hand. “John, just…just come upstairs, alright?”
But Molly knew. As excited as the giant was to see the new baby, he also had a weak stomach for the…other products of birth. And really, there wasn’t room for him here, and he couldn’t make much of a difference. He’d been taking lessons with Miracle Max too, but his strength wouldn’t help here.
elp John and Sherlock with their private cases. Stan calls it double-dating. Greg calls the Holmes’ a bad influence.
“They won’t catch us,” John said, as if he’d read Sherlock’s mind. “And if they do…well, we’re guardians of the Princess’ child. I think we’ll get off.”
Sherlock and John are out of the Fire Swamp, but there are enemies everywhere. Sherlock says goodbye.
"No," Sherlock said softly. "And it seems as though we have time to fully appreciate the men we love, without hard drive space taken up with nonsense."
“We won’t pursue the Princess, but we do not want war, either. In the moment Princess Sherlock left, he may have become…confused…about the Prince’s intentions.”
“Only those in the chapel know that, and several of those people are now dead,” Moran answered.
“Then you go ahead and do that. We’ll go to the dungeons and see if we can find the Carriers, see what happened. Meet back here, and if we’re not back by sunrise…wait for the others.”
Holmes looked at Watson, a little non-plussed.
And this concludes the Mystrade trilogy.
Kitty managed a smile at that. "Grief is the price we pay for love," she quoted. "Queen Elizabeth was a wise woman. And I wouldn't trade a moment of the happiness that we've had. You two gave me justice, a family...love. That's worth any pain."
"I had to do this!" Kitty was tiring, her struggling becoming weaker. "I had to hurt him, he can't ever hurt anyone else like this, no matter what happens!"
They hadn’t written vows. Stan had found a set he declared ‘perfect’, and the way they spoke them sounded like the words were new, that no one had ever had a love like theirs. Maybe they were right, John thought. He remembered how they’d looked when he’d first seen them; two frightened, damaged people who clung on tight to being good in defiance of a cruel world. Now they stood together, their delight palpable, and John felt the proudest he’d ever been of being allowed to witness this moment.
John turned back to the street, where Sherlock was staring up. John gave him a thumbs up, and his heart broke again when Sherlock collapsed, dropping to his knees.
“I have every faith in you, Seb,” Prince Jamiarty said warmly. He’d always liked Seb, the best and most faithful of his hounds. Sure, Magnussen was fun, but he had complete and utter trust in Moran. “It’s a shame you’ll miss the wedding.”
When they were all gathered, Janine looked Moran right in the eye. “And royalty to royalty, take back this message. We are willing to keep a truce for the sake of our people and the innocents in Florin, who have no role in this quarrel. But our royal person has been insulted and threatened, and our people are still in danger. We advise Prince Jamiarty that our allied leaders will know the truth of this exchange, and if there are any threats they will be informed and we will go to war. And if this should happen, expect it to be short, fierce, and unstoppable.”
There was one woman left. One woman sitting alone on the steps of the Thieves’ Alehouse. (
The beach was soggy and a bit grim, but Billy went walking anyways. He had to think.
“I stayed for five days after the baby was born.” Riley’s jaw clenched for the barest of seconds. “There was no Announcement.”
Holmes flinched at that. He stayed quiet for another moment, then whispered almost desperately, "do you still desire me?"
“Well—” Sherlock stopped and looked up guiltily. “Doesn’t matter. They can figure it out.”
“Not your fault. You’re from away, aren’t you?”
When Molly Hooper was thirty-five she and Mike bought a tiny house together. It was in a quiet neighbourhood and they had flowers in the garden and plenty of room to hang up her Dad’s paintings. There was even room in their dining room to dance as long as they pushed the chairs out of the way.
"What were you doing at our window?" Sherlock asked. To John's surprise his husband's voice was soft and nearly gentle, with no hint of the usual menace with which he confronted people who broke into Baker Street.
That made everyone shut up. Sally swayed.
"We met at the library," Stan explained. He was still blushing under his newly grown beard. "She was there with Lily and Jacob. It was my day off—"
Moriarty laughed. “Oh pet, you being dead, Sherlock seeing you broken and bloody, that's certainly part of the final number. How's your precious detective going to deal when you're gone, hmm? I do think that'll destroy him—burn him out, as they say.”
“Don’t be so sure about that,” Greg said wryly, remembering Mycroft’s enthusiasm at planning even the most dull political gathering.
Well that, he knew how to fix.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock said urgently. "What's happened, what did I do?"
“The Prince gave orders you bitch!” Another Brute launched at her, and her sword flashed. He howled, pressing a hand to his arm.
“I think that went well,” he said as Sherlock sat down, Mycroft standing near the bar. “I mean...there's no way they're going to let him off, is there?”
John thanked every deity in existence that Mrs. Hudson was gone for the weekend to her sister's. The window could be fixed in the meantime, although he wasn't sure that Kitty would be gone when she returned.
“I know a little about healing,” Watson answered. “My…my mother was a healer. She learned it from her father. This is his book.”
Roofs?
“Do you mean that Prince Jamiarty was going to kill the Princess and blame the murder on my country?”  Princess Janine asked. Her voice was so calm, but Molly could see the fury in her lover’s eyes.
Sherlock poked his head in, and saw Jamiarty there with Moran. He nodded to both men. “Any word from John?”
“That sounds terrible.”
“Nothing,” Watson said, in a voice that was more sob than speech.
There was no point asking, John knew. Sherlock was getting better at sharing things since they’d become partners, but he still had a flair for the dramatic. If there was a surprise brewing, John wouldn’t see it until it happened.
"Four—oh, stupid, stupid," Sherlock rolled his eyes. "You already knew each other, didn't you?"
“I don’t think we have any plans,” John replied. “I’ve just been reading, might keep doing that. Did you have something in mind?”
“Ireni will never sell him.”
The immediate aftermath of the Kitty arc.
Watson shifted uneasily. “Then why am I here?”
"I miss them too," Kitty said, tears running down her face. "But we'll see them again. Have faith, darling. If I learned anything from your grandfathers, it's that you cannot keep people who are meant to be together apart forever. It's just not logical."
So rejoice, because it is going to be every day updates! I also apologize in advance for the quality of the duel; I'm not great at writing action scenes.
She knew that the way John looked at his friend was beyond friendship, beyond law—and one time, just once when she’d come into Baker Street to find John asleep on the sofa, she saw Sherlock Holmes looking at him the same way.
“Who was my father, Max?”
Kitty noticed. “Something funny, Dad?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then…” John’s eyes went wide. “Wait—it wasn’t Mycroft who sent the man, was it?”
“What was that about?” Sherlock asked.
The other man—Sherlock—rushed over. “John’s not here,” he said—rather strange, why did that matter? “He’s visiting Harry.”
That got John moving. “How are we getting there?” he asked when he swung himself out of bed.
“Were you here today?” Cerise asked hoarsely.
"I...I believe so."
Max snorted. “You do too much for that cousin of yours.”
“Yes...well, the point is that the title would do nothing for me financially nor socially. If anything, it might damage my reputation, as it insinuates that I am somehow better than my circle of informants and acquaintances.”
John’s head swam, and he stumbled.
Lestrade flushed. “I know it is a great deal to ask, but—”
That was Grezzik’s last thought before he fell unconscious.
“It’s not me you’ve hurt, Queen of Trash! Your true love lives, and you marry another! Boo! Boo!”
"Now this, John, is why I fell in love with you."
“She couldn’t be.” Stam shook his head. “Are you that loyal, cousin? That you would stand behind a child murderer, a kinslayer?”
Greg chuckled. “None needed, though I might be deaf in one ear. So here’s what I think we should do…”
“Five.”
Donovan stayed put.
Ah. They hadn’t made it up two flights of stairs. Interesting. How had he missed that?
Kitty stared at him with wide eyes. "I thought people only carried those in books."
“Grezzik, are you going to ride?” Ireni asked, trying to mount.
It has been months since I wrote in this journal, simply because nothing of great note has happened in my personal relationship with Sherlock Holmes; at least, nothing that I cannot write about elsewhere. We have been married nearly six months now, and we are very happy.
And John kissed him then, and Sherlock slipped his fingers into John’s hair, it was longer than on the farm, and he couldn’t feel the ache anymore and all he felt was warmth, pure warmth…
“How hard was it to say that?”
When they reached the Pit of Despair, the woman was already there, her head pressed to Watson’s chest. She stood up when the giant entered. “Grezzik?” There was terrible hope in her eyes, the kind that might break you even if it is fulfilled.
John beamed. “Brilliant, Lily.”
King Lotharon looked at the others. “I assume you trust these people.”
At the end of the year, the sword was finished. It shone even in the dim light of their tiny hovel, balanced perfectly.
“Oh, Guilder was happy to do it. Princess Janine hates Jamiarty as much as he hates her, and she graciously agreed to conquer London and keep it secret. I then staged a heroic rebellion, we overthrew our usurpers, and our peace treaty made London its own country, with Princess Janine staying on as advisor. Guilder and London are still good friends, of course, and France, Archenland and Sanctaphrax have joined our cause as well. Fascinating people.”
"I suppose loving minds think alike," Sherlock replied, practically dragging John inside. "I've got one too."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock winced. “That's why I'm telling you now. I'm trusting you, John, you have to keep this a secret.”
“Where did he move her?” Stam asked. He refused to give quarter. “Where did he move the remains of the seven year old girl he murdered, Sebastian?”
Molly swallowed, remembering Ireni’s promise. “Now I suppose…we should try not to be apart.”
“What is your name?”
“No, of course not. That’s why Henry seemed alright until this evening. The drug must have kicked in.”
Mycroft smiled. “That sounds wonderful.”
“Who is she?”
The girl was lying on the ground groaning, glass in her curly brown hair and streaks of blood marring her dark skin. She was still conscious, but the nasty looking twist to her ankle told John at a glance that she wouldn't be running away. Which was grand, because he wasn't exactly going to let her get away without explaining two things. One, how she'd even gotten as high as the window of a first floor, and two, why she'd done it in the first place.
Sally was positive her child was going to be a boy, though no one actually knew for sure. She’d dreamed of a boy-child twice, and she and Anderson had already decided to name the baby Tom.
Kitty whirled in his arms and sobbed wildly. Sherlock put the book down and hugged the girl close. "It's done," he promised. "And I will not judge you, nor will anyone else. It's over, Kitty."
“So we are,” John said. He gave Sherlock his free hand and they stood up together. “Shall we go to Canada, then?”
“Even at the Yard? Doctor, you’re slipping.”
Sherlock laughed. "I quite agree."
“Noble of you,” Watson said.
John shrugged. "It's not any of her business."
He was reclined on some sort of sofa, but the material was utterly unfamiliar. The clutter in the room was ridiculous—piles of unrelated objects on every surface but two chairs by the fire, a violin case propped against the windowsill, a strange box on the mantle.
"Why the HELL are we going to see
I am still hesitant to write these words, for fear of this book falling into the wrong hands. But I must write these words down, to stop them from coming out of my mouth. I must trace my love across these pages, as I cannot write them anywhere else.
Watson knew it was over when the other doctor gave his professional opinion.
“Her fifth. She’s getting on, but she’s always loved children. As does her husband.”
Mycroft was ready to walk to the post office—it was his weekly exercise, even in this icy winter—when his phone rang. When he heard Maggie’s weeping voice, he knew.
“Always,” Watson promised, and for the last time that day, sank into sleep.
Anderson nodded. He straightened his back, and Sherlock caught a glimpse of royalty, of strength in his pose. “You’re right. I’ll do it.”
Whatever he'd been expecting to come out of his husband's mouth, it certainly hadn't been that. "I...what on Earth do you mean, Sherlock?"
“Then it must be John…Mycroft.” Watson grinned awkwardly. “It may take some time to get used to that.”
, what a marvellous word) chat with their family and friends. He ate slowly and methodically, watching his hands as he used his knife and fork. More specifically, he watched his left hand.
Sherlock smiled tolerantly. “Of course you will, love.”
“Donovan?” Sherlock was shocked by the detective's tone. She was clearly crying.
"Sure, why not?" Greg was, after all, in a good mood. He could always tell Mycroft (and Sherlock too, while he was at it) much later, when they were publicly out.
“I’ve earned back my name now,” Molly replied. She was trembling now. “It’s been a long time.”
Curious, Holmes opened the telegram. “Come to Plymouth docks. Case for you. Wear your best.  Bring Dr. Watson.” It was signed Mycroft, which meant that his brother was anxious yet happy. Odd.
“Don't worry about that,” John said with a grin. “I'll just sit on his lap.”
“Enough of that!”
The girl seemed to relax just a bit. "My boss."
“I know that story too, but I just thought this was his real first one, and he was ashamed. It’s a cowardly way to kill.”
Well, that's that taken care of.
Grezzik brought her the bowl, and held the spoon for her as she tried to eat. “I’m here now,” he said. He took a deep breath. “Ireni is dead.”
That was very clearly the wrong thing to say.
Outside, the panic was beginning to set in among the guards.
(See the end of the chapter for
Greg read the title and looked up, shocked.
"No, a detective case," Grandad John explained. "We're detectives, you see, when we're not being grandfathers."
Martha grabbed her by the arm. “You’ve got to sit down, dear. There’s been too many shocks today.”
John grinned. “You got him, then?”
“Harry’s a woman, actually. Harriet.” Sherlock pushed Watson’s hands away from the wound, examined it himself. “Knife. Nasty cut.”
A woman had appeared out of nowhere, golden hair turning gray and clutching a frying pan.
“I know,” the King said bitterly. “But I never imagined—he was only ten years old! How could he…” He shook his head. “I’ll tell you what happened—what I saw. Perhaps that can help.”
“I want to spend our anniversary together,” John said. “What we’re doing is rather immaterial. So long as we have my surprise tonight.”
P.S. Hopefully that was enough of a reference for cookies, NovaNara!
Next chapter we'll get back to Grezzik, don't you fret!
“Ross and Emma Lee,” Wiggins called back from his lofty perch. “Congratulations, Doctor!”
The next day in the courtroom, John swore out loud when he heard the verdict. Making an obvious show of his outrage, he stormed outside, calling Sherlock immediately. “Not guilty! The bastard's not guilty! Sherlock, you know what that means—Sherlock?” Furiously, he shoved the phone back into his pocket and walked up the street.
"She very much might be," John whispered back. "Gruner's got a pretty tight hold on her, but the more worrisome part is what he's going to do if he decides that she's no longer useful."
"No," Ireni said, and her eyes softened. "You won't be able to do anything with them until the spell ends, but we can get there quickly."
Text in bold is my voice, speaking to you all. Kinda like what William Goldman does in the book. It is a faster way of doing exposition (and let's face it, I can just tell you what you need to know about Florin's gender politics, and then we can move on).
Sherlock pretty well figured he was dead, but somehow, somehow, Grezzik had gotten within arm’s reach and yanked him out of the water.
“I’ll go help Holmes with luncheon then.” His grandfather left the room and Billy set about unpacking. He took a big armful, dumped it in the top drawer, then took another and put it in the bottom drawer. Finished. Easy.
If you kill me you won't get the end.
“I do,” Sherlock and John said in unison, and they ignored the laughter around them as they kissed for the first time as the ‘married ones’ of 221b.
A shadow passed over the King’s face. “What has my son done now?”
John shook his head. "You're horrible yourself, my girl. Why didn't you tell us? We were hoping you two would like each other. Well, not necessarily in this way, but we're quite pleased. Aren't we Sherlock?" he nudged his husband.
“Yes, and the most intelligent of the professionals, with the exception of your father,” Holmes answered readily. “We should try for a visit, John, when we can.”
, there were words woven deep into the melody; not lyrics or libretto, but words that were music in themselves, words like
"Yes," Watson nodded, but his attention was drawn by the door. It didn't appear to be locked, and when he tried the knob it turned easily.
“Yeah, but—”
“Just tell me, Kitty. Please don’t think the worst of me before I’ve given reason.”
John blinked hard. “Was that—”
And here we have the first part of John and Sherlock's wedding! It's a day early to mark the 2 year anniversary of the first gay marriages in the UK. I'll update every other day for the next three chapters since they're all connected. Cheers, and happy reading!
“I don't know!”
“My name is Molly Montoya,” she whispered to the corpse, “you killed my father, and now you are dead. Rot in hell.”
John smirked. “Tonight?”
He fought twenty, thirty, forty people at once, but it wasn’t enough. And the crowd began to boo again. Grezzik was now over seven feet tall, several hundred pounds, and he was so strong that he could…well, climb the Cliffs of Insanity using only his arms.
“On the contrary,” Watson bowed, hoping they could see. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. Again,” he dared to add, hoping that was not against some hidden rule.
“How big is this flat?”
No, that wouldn't do. John closed his eyes again and took Sherlock's hand in his. the cool of the metal was somehow just as soothing as the warmth of his skin, and soothed by that, John did manage to fall asleep.
“Is that any of your business?” his brother replied. But he looked at Lestrade, and John saw a story there, a story that had never gotten past the first sentence.
Janine kissed her. “You’re welcome, as always.” She looked up and flushed. “Oh, your intended has come, Sherlock. We can speak later, Molly.”
John stepped forward uncertainly, eyes momentarily drawn to the faded scratches of ‘Rache’ on the floor. When he turned Sherlock was staring at him from across the room.
They fell silent then. The only sound in the caravan were the sounds of the King and Queen snoring quietly.
“Man or woman?”
“You murdered my daughter, and tried to murder my niece.”
“Spy?”
“I’ve uncovered no plot from Guilder. You’ve discovered information that I have not, and I am meant to be your security; this realm’s security. I have failed you.”
Watson stepped forward and gripped Holmes’ shoulders. “I’m sorry,” he replied. “I didn’t think of that.” He paused. “I can’t let you keep going out alone, though. Will you at least take one of the erstwhile Irregulars with you—Wiggins, perhaps?” Bill Wiggins was now a constable who’d been taken under Hopkins’ wing—surely he could protect Holmes.
You could get a fair bit of fun out of tradition, John conceded as he tried to keep up with Stan. You just had to use your imagination.
“Are you using the royal we again?” Grezzik asked. He found that confusing, so Mycroft and Janine tried not to use it around him.
The one next to the wailer, a six foot tall Male woman Sherlock recognized as Eria, stared wildly. “Princess? It’s—she’s having a night terror. And we can’t wake her.”
“Since when are you Head Priest?” Sherlock interrupted.
He was right back carrying a damp flannel and a glass of water as well as the other items, but in that time tears had begun to seep out from under Sherlock's eyelids. John quickly placed the things on the nightstand and knelt beside the bed, drawing Sherlock into his arms. "It's alright, dear, I'm right here."
John’s jaw dropped. When his eyes met Sherlock’s, he wasn’t entirely surprised to see his husband tear up.
"What's going on?"
Secondly, I've made a final list of chapters. I currently have four more weeks worth of chapters (there's one multi-parter that will come out in the same week.) So I'm going to take prompts from today until next Wednesday (October 19th). Any that come in I'll add to the list, but otherwise this story will end on November 9th. You can still submit prompts after the 19th, but I won't be posting any further chapters until about 23rd of November at the earliest; I need to take a week's break, especially since I've got school deadlines (and another deadline that will be of interest in January) all that month.
Cerise smiled through tears. “My daughter loved parties. Let’s throw one!”
“We’re starting a war, idiot. They always start with a dead body. Preferably royal.” Ireni’s lip curled into a smile. “This is a prestigious line of work, you should be proud.”
“What, you don’t think a woman can be smart?”
“Well obviously, I saw the ring. Nice, by the way.”
“You don’t smell so good either,” Grezzik said. “Don’t worry, Molly. I will take care of you.”
"You heard me." Greg glanced over to where Kitty sat on the sofa, curled under one of the many shock blankets Sherlock and John had nicked over the years. John was speaking to her soothingly. "Just...don't let John write this one up, okay?"
Sherlock leaned his head against John’s chest. “But we didn’t have a chance to fuck their start up.”
“Jamiarty does have allies,” Savira agreed. “Archenland borders one or two. We can talk about that.”
“Mycroft, when one is dating a policeman, one should not be making death threats in their earshot.” Sherlock took John’s hand. “Come along, John, let’s leave them to it.”
Mycroft was surprised. “Would you like me to write to you?” That seemed to be what the other man was leading towards, but it…couldn’t be.
Lord Moran and his companion arrive on Sunday, and they've got plans for our happy little family.
“What do you gentlemen have on later?”
“Yes, he has.” Moran had a couple drops of Veritas in him, but he was speaking very quickly, as if he was trying to outrun the truth spell. “It’s all in his book. He doesn’t want the care of a Kingdom, so to speak. That’s why he was so upset when he had to get married; it tied him to the throne. But he absolutely wants control.”
THIS HOWEVER IS: http://archiveofourown.org/works/8549506
“But you must have at least suspected that I knew the powder’s origin, which means that I cannot choose the wine in front of me!”
“Don’t worry about that,” the woman said. “You won’t have much to worry about very soon.”
Maria needs to track down her father's killer. But it was never going to be easy.
“But Jamiarty’s first kill was an elephant,” Stam answered. “And he charged at it.”
Holmes reached out and took the doctor’s hands.
Now he knew for a fact that wasn’t true. John was open with his affection, clear with annoyance and laughed as loud as Sherlock did at crime scenes (well, they weren’t supposed to giggle, what else could they do?) It was only pain he hid, and Sherlock wanted to know why. He needed to make plans, specific to important details, so that John would never be hurt again.
In the village close to where they retire, most of the inhabitants have accepted the fact that the odd men in the cottage are a bit…different. They don’t particularly care; Holmes’ honey is good, Watson’s generous with his time and his vegetables, and really, they’re doing no harm.
“I don’t believe I can help with that,” Holmes replied. His hands fidgeted. “How are you holding up mentally?”
“More to the point,” Lord Moran said loudly over the bickering, “how do we say we found out about the baby?” He turned to Riley. “Is the news public in London?”
Janine held up a hand before Philip could retort. “Is that what you advise? To let two dangerous enemies return to their stronghold?”
But when they stopped for lunch and Sally fed Waverly, Ireni felt a tug on non-existent heartstrings.
“I know.” Janine kissed her cheek. “I suppose those ten years were long enough for me.”
"Better hurry back to him before he gets bored," Donovan called, just loud enough for John to hear over the music.
“And you grew up into a kind, brave, wise man anyways,” Sherlock continued in a low voice. “And you fell into company with others like you, but you couldn’t see that, because no one ever told you that you were wonderful. And why would they tell you that? They must’ve thought you knew.”
Although just as a hint, she may not always be a girl.
Mary smiled up at the man who had saved her from loneliness, who loved her despite loving the man beside him. The man she loved with all her heart.
They were out the door before Stan finished talking, out into a wild winter storm.
Mary would never tell, of course. She couldn’t bear the thought of John in jail, nor even Sherlock. The love in John’s eyes was quiet, a little sad, and hopeless; it would do no harm to anyone, not even her. After all, John did love her.
“Leave, Sally. Find Anderson and go. Your services won’t be necessary.”
“Is that why Riley took her?”
“You’ve got to get used to that,” John explained. “He’s not always so rigid.”
Sherlock pulled John into his arms, letting him bury his face in the crook of his neck. “They didn’t love you,” he whispered.
“I’m so sorry. He tricked me. He’s cleverer than me.”
going to kill the Princess, and make it look like it was them. The country will be furious, and we’ll be at war. When I take over, you can help me run Guilder.”
Beyond that, he hadn’t the foggiest.
The woman's husband, by far the most innocent of the four, was wracked with remorse for the pain he was putting his wife through. She'd wanted this as much as he, but he wasn't the one upstairs, he wasn't the one who was risking everything to bring a child into the world. Could he ever make it up to her? Only, he figured, by being the best father he could be, and that wasn't an easy thought, having never known a father.
Next chapter, we'll be checking back in with the people getting nearer the Castle. I wonder what they'll find?
First he would look. At the least, he had to bury his friend…
“What?” John hugged him even tighter. “I wouldn’t leave you while you’re coming down from—”
Sherlock was about to ask John, rather hopefully, if perhaps they ought to go downstairs and see if Mrs. Hudson might be there (he had very little data on this apparent afterlife, it was rather disconcerting to find out there was one at all). A creak from the stairs stopped him.
*********
“Someone may still come in.” Sherlock returned to the old woman’s voice. “What happened to Eria and the other Carriers?”
That didn't stop either Sherlock or John from wishing.
“I understand Holmes and I,” Watson replied. “I must, after so long.” He paused. “I don’t like this much, Mr. Holmes, but it is how we must be. I am willing to live this way.”
She held her sword up and smiled.
“It’s alright,” John said. “I just…wow. I thought they were long dead. And I couldn’t remember…it doesn’t matter now. Why am I here?”
“We will fight. As humans should. No tricks, no weapons, skill only.”
This time Stam did retch, bile spilling onto the floor. He’d been down there several times himself.
I just laughed, for if I know my husband and my surrogate niece I know two things for certain. The first is that we will both speak to Hopkins, and make it clear that he should have Kitty’s best interests at heart. The second is that Kitty will have prepared him for this talk, and will make a scene of great distress and enjoy herself hugely.
John’s cry of pain snapped Sherlock into action. He leapt to his feet and aimed a swift kick at the rodent. It dislodged the rat from John’s shoulder, which was good, but then it leapt at Sherlock, which was Not Good.
Sherlock turned just in time to see a dark hand throw a bottle through the open window to his right. He heard a horrible scream.
Sherlock didn't answer for a moment. "I know, John. But we rarely spend any time with your...friends, as a couple. I wanted to rectify that situation."
“What can we do against her magic?” Grezzik asked. “I was powerless before.”
Sherlock curtsied. He was surprised that Molly didn’t; she didn’t even bow. She was staring at the Princess, eyes wide with shock.
Knowing a task, however mundane, could keep Holmes grounded, Watson patiently talked the detective through the bandaging of the wound. It had been hastily bandaged at the Yard, but Watson hadn’t quite trusted the police doctor. Either way he knew that Holmes would have insisted on redoing it.
“Lords and Ladies.” Prince Jamiarty smiled with all his teeth. “Riley’s done it again, and this time she’s discovered something actionable.”
This chapter is probably one of my favourites so far :)
Holmes took the bandage away as if Watson had burned him. “I thought I should sanitize it,” he explained, his shaking lips betraying his worry.
"Christ, don't worry about that." Greg patted Sherlock's shoulder awkwardly. "Feel better, mate."
“I wasn’t finished,” Molly interrupted. “I know she loves me, and that I love her. But she wants—and she needs—a child. Guilder doesn’t have a Carrier right now, and I was wondering…”
“Good idea. Thanks.”
"Yes. My attention was wholly on Molly."
Dread slowed his footsteps, and it was the darkest hour before dawn by the time he reached the Cliff’s edge. To his horror, there was no body, nothing. Grezzik wept as he stood by the Cliffs. Had the man in black thrown her body over the side? If so, he couldn’t bear to climb down.
Goldney Hall, which is where John and Mary’s reception was in ‘The Sign of Three’.
Raz, looking weary and angry, was standing at a desk, flipping through a dusty book. The pages were edged with silver—a legal book, then.
“Seriously, though…” Lestrade paused for a minute, trying to gather himself. “You’ve both become so important in my life, both professionally and personally, and I don’t say this enough but I do enjoy every minute of the madness…and I’m so glad to see two good and great men get a chance to be happy together, because it’s been clear for a long time—and maybe clearer to everyone else than to you—that what you’ve always wanted is to be with each other.”
“And what about when you promised your group that you would make sure they got back, no matter what it cost you?”
“Of course. Let the verdict go out, and news of Princess Sally’s naming as Heir go out as well.”
Then John swore and pulled him down into a kiss, and the warmth flooded through Sherlock’s entire body. He let go of John’s hands, lacing them in his hair instead, and John was tugging on his curls. And when they pulled away Sherlock’s eyes were shining, and he was beautiful. Tenth in the world.
“What’s funny?”
“I tried to free him. But he refused. He wants to save his Princess, and I want to see that happen. I have a wheelbarrow, we can use that.”
“Oh really?”
*****************
“John?”
“Could you have perhaps offered some form of support?”
Plus it reminds me of the Winkin Blinkin and Nod song and it's an awesome lullaby.
Thankfully they caught the early train, but it was still nearly supper time when they reached Plymouth. Holmes led Watson down to the docks, growing more puzzled by the moment. There were no obvious signs of political unrest, and the summer crowds made the town far more crowded than Mycroft liked. If his brother ever left London, he tended to retire to their old family home in the country. What on earth would possess him to come here, especially if he could simply send him and Watson?
“We’re only ten minutes early,” John said, losing the battle with his laughter. “We should have knocked, though—sorry.”
John watched through blurred eyes as Sherlock sank to one knee.
“There is no Guilderian plot, stupid.
“You don’t look so good, Molly.”
When the door closed behind the bell hop John glanced up at Sherlock, suddenly and unaccountably nervous. "Do you want to...well, shall we have a drink?"
“You know, those mundane little habits that people pick up in childhood and never get rid of?” Sherlock ached to watch his lover’s face, but he knew that wasn’t a good idea.
Kitty beckoned them over, and once Watson was close enough she carefully held the bundle of blankets out to him. "This is William John Hopkins," she said. "I thought we'd call him Billy."
"I swear to God I'm going to wring both of their necks."
“Somebody did,” Sally whispered. “Somebody brought me dresses and made sure that I had my favourite candy. Somebody made sure I wouldn’t carry my brother’s child.”
“I think you two should pack up and be ready to leave,” Stam said.
Sherlock's whole body went cold. He raised his arm and checked the time listlessly. 5 AM. 0500 hours, as John put it, or oh-Christ-hundred-hours when they were up too late.
“Stop saying that!”
“She can’t be treated that way!”
“Who are you?” Molly snapped.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock heard a pop. “John!”
Ireni pouted. “Oh, that’s so simple! All I have to do is take what I know of you, and deduce whether or not you’re the type of man to put the poison in his own glass.”
Sebastian finally met Stam’s gaze with empty eyes. “Cousin, my hands aren’t clean either. I’m a spymaster. There are parts of that job that …well, they were no worse than anything in that diary.”
But it didn’t matter, Holmes realized, and he could tell John knew it too. They were married now because they loved each other and they had a family who loved them enough to make a special effort to see them together. That was more than enough proof that it had happened.
“Riley Canterbury.”
"Is that your real name?"
“He is your grandfather,” Grezzik added.
“How often did you turn to the drug because of me?” Watson asked, voice shaking as he remembered the early days of their friendship, the days just before his marriage…oh God.
There was a pause. Billy listened intently.
https://www.pinterest.com/pin/523402787914737725/
Anderson had curled up, his knees drawn to his chest. “Will we make it by nightfall?”
Sherlock glared at his husband. “Anderson, could you find the executioner and subdue her?”
“Then it came to me,” Sherlock whispered. “You’ve said before that you don’t want to be alone again. I can promise you that you will never be alone as long as I am alive, because if there is anything more pleasant than being loved by you it is being able to love you back.”
And the woman did, and screeched louder, in defiance of the past, of the horrible dark moments where she'd known, not thought,
“Like I said, the little girl will likely die if you’re all fighting, and that ruins my favour.” Ireni glanced over her shoulder. “We’re here now, anyways. I didn’t have enough time to come up with a brilliant plan.”
“No, Grezzik! I have yet to earn that name back.” She brushed past Stam, storming down the stairs.
“I don't know, but I know that Rich—that M-Moriarty is going to hurt him. The little boy woke up, and he told us about the man in the suit who showed them pictures of you and told them to scream. He identified him as Brook.”
“Don't make this kind of decision without me again. Please, dear, I can't bear thinking we're safe, that we've got no secrets and then find out something like this.”
He watched in shock as his grandfather’s face went a bit pale. “Well…yes, we do. We’re getting on in years, Billy. We thought it might be best…and anyways, this cottage is still quite small. It gives us space for the study.”
Lestrade squeezed his hand. “I want to sit with you for a while,” he replied. “Sit and tell you all the things I could never write. Does that sound alright, love?”
“There was a fight here with a giant,” Jamiarty said, raising himself from his kneeling position. Just before he stood, he spotted footprints. “There are the Princess’ footprints! He was alive no more than an hour ago.”
“I'll look straight away. Damn him, why didn't he take the tracker when I offered?”
“I’d tell him so, but I can’t find him,” Seb frowned.
“Because of the wedding, the guards have been doubled. I believe there are thirty.”
Then a group of soldiers, lead by a man with a blue cloak and six fingers on his right hand, rounded the corner.
“So Jamiarty has always wanted to be King?” Mycroft said in disbelief. Of all things, he hadn’t expected that.
He would have been the first, but that’s when the news came.
She accepted these burdens, knew there would be weight and trouble, knew the grief of the past would be part of her, but there would also be joy and a chance to do some real good for her country.
To his surprise, Lily pouted. “You were supposed to say you didn’t approve!”
“It’ll take a miracle,” Martha said. “Lucky they have one.”
“Not a bad one,” John replied. His legs folded under him, and Grezzik lifted him up.
Sherlock let go of John’s hand and darted for the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
Waverly snuggled into Grezzik, delighted that her guardian was there. He lived in London, which was only a day’s journey, but he was also the Duke’s husband, in charge of law-keeping there. He came as often as he could, but Waverly still missed him. Anyways, her tenth birthday wouldn’t be the same without him.
“I changed my mind,” John retorted.
Husband?
"Not just her."
When they finally got out John had a strong sense of déjà vu. They were staring up at an old building. There was no crime scene tape or Yarders, but John knew exactly where they were.
And what if she wasn’t his daughter? What if she and the others were wrong after all? What would the King say, to see a Carrier stand and pretend to be a Princess?
Holmes looked about, but he couldn’t see any sign of land, nor even another ship. “Which is where, exactly?”
“Thank you, Prince John.” Eria’s eyes filled with tears. “Go now. I fear what is happening to our parents. We can protect each other, but they are out of our reach.”
“Was it worth it, your Highness?” Cerise advanced on Jamiarty. “Is it worth it now?”
“Very well. Let’s get married.”
Grandfather John was halfway through a story about a runaway train when they got to the cottage. Billy gasped with delight—Dad had sketched it quickly for him, but he’d never seen it. It was beautiful—small and all gray bricks with neat flowers all around. The rain was still coming down, but Grandfather Sherlock came out anyways, his lips turned into one of his special smiles. Billy leapt out, nearly knocking him down. “Sorry, Grandfather,” he gasped.
They’d made more progress than Sherlock thought, because the sun was only just setting when Anderson stopped in front of him.
"Oh don't be silly, Molly's plenty." Molly pulled some T-shirts and a pair of jeans out from the bag. "I hope you like the colours. You can keep them as long as you like."
“They have to find her. And then…I suppose I’d better take the throne.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. "I never knew you were a dancer, Blackwater. Did you, John? Why don't you show us your steps?" He relinquished his hold on Blackwater. The rest of the crowd had backed away now, frightened by the chill in Sherlock's voice.
"I don't believe so," King Lotharon said. "There are a lot of travellers in the Capital, especially since the 500
There were books on the small table, lit by a sputtering candle.
The dungeons of London were nothing like the Capital’s dungeons. Those were dank, dark and musty, with mold growing out of the cracks in the wall. Here, there were new torches every twelve hours, and the floors were tidy, swept free of dust despite the lack of prisoners.
“Less than forty-five minutes,” Grezzik said.
Kate waved from her post. “Sally! What brings you here?”
Cheers,
Sherlock stopped in his tracks. John sounded so calm, so serious. So matter-of-fact.
Another grunt, one of Grezzik’s most polite. He knew that Molly was never good when she had to be still, when all they could do was wait to get to the problem. He also knew that was to be expected, after twenty years of waiting to find the right man to kill. He could row and listen at the same time.
“I’ll tell you in a minute. First, I’ve made my decision. Let’s drink from our own glasses.”
“I demand to be treated properly! I am a Prince, and I worked against my country. I murdered members of the Royal Family. I demand my right to die!”
“Apologies, Mr. Holmes, for disturbing you.”
“What?”
It resurfaced a few nights later in an utterly different mood, a few low arpeggios in the dead of night as faint moans of pain and terror filtered through the firmly-locked door. The scales softened into low melodic chords, and the nightmare faded.
On the other hand, a couple of years later, Mummy was not at all pleased when she found out that Billy had been playing page-boy the day a dangerous criminal was invited for tea. At least they got the yellow stone back, but Mummy nearly broke Grandad's real head when she first heard, and only stopped shouting when Billy swore he'd gone for the police right away and hadn't heard any of the conversation.
“That, my dear Holmes, is because the
“You’ll have it.
Thanks again, Debbie, this is lovely.
There was still no sign of Sherlock and John.
“Not at all. It’ll be much easier for Sally to walk in if we just take out Jamiarty tonight.”
Maria's not giving up on John, and Stam the albino offers a solution at a little cottage deep in the woods...
that a man that talented would be anything other than Roberts himself. So that must be a lie. And he went to great effort for the Princess; he would be here by now if he could. Therefore he cannot. And Grezzik—Guilder didn’t kidnap the Princess. We did.”
“You’re
“Do you accept?”
“John was too,” Greg replied. “He had one idea, but he’s convinced it won’t be any good.”
“And France is allied to neither side,” John said. “Which means she can settle in and they won’t ask questions.”
"And what's in the book?" Sherlock asked.
"We have the rest of our lives."
"I know, dear." John traced Sherlock's cheekbones. "I know, and now we know for sure, and we just made a really big promise, and we're joyful about it, and that's what makes this night special. It's another first."
The King looked at her. “Before you came here, I believed that it was the sea air and the change of scenery,” he said evenly. “Now I am not so sure.”
Prince Jamiarty blinked.
“Yes, no good,” Molly agreed. “I’ll be useless there. Very well, I will hang on. And when we get to the top, if you can hold the magic I will use my sword.”
Mycroft and Gregory spent many hours sitting together, often in silence, sometimes discussing the latest strange occurrence in London or Matt’s last prank. There was something comfortable about the silence; two men near the end of their days, finding solace in a new friendship.
“Damn right we do!” Wiggins called from the sails.
Mycroft lived another year, his time divided between Scotland and Sussex. Fittingly, however, when he died it was at the Diogenes Club, stopping over in the Stranger’s Room for one last memory.
“Not by sailboat,” John agreed. He seemed to understand what his husband was getting at. “But rowboat. Think, Grezzik. Were you tired when you climbed the Cliffs of Insanity?”
“Why are you asking us?” Sherlock asked, ignoring John. “We’re not the only wedded couple in your life.”
"Stan, they don't need the whole bloody story!"
Waverly smiled. Ireni was her favourite tutor, because she taught Waverly how to understand people, how to lie, and just a little touch of magic.
He’d missed it. The eyes. Stupid, stupid.
Raz shook his head. “Dragged out of here at noon. All the Carriers were. They’re being charged with high treason.”
John stumbled forward, dropping to his knees and cradling Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Yes,” he whispered. He was shaking so badly he could hardly speak. “Yes, yes…I don’t know what else to say—”
“Why did you come to this palace?”
“Because he knows that if we tell people that he was trying to start a false war by murdering an innocent man?”
“What’s—where are we?”
Molly fell sideways that time, and several minutes of calling her name accomplished nothing.
They were breaking many rules tonight; what was one more? “I love you,” Watson whispered. He could have sworn he heard an echo just before he fell asleep.
Ireni sank back in the water. “Well, there’s no sense going tonight. We’ll head there in the morning.”
"Alright, alright." Kitty thundered down the stairs, glitter still smeared on her cheek from the arts and crafts she'd done with Lily and Jacob. Without pausing, she dashed into the kitchen, grabbed the cold beers and biscuits, turned sharply and somehow landed between John and Sherlock without upsetting plates or dropping the cans. "You do realize that we're watching a DVD, right? The show can start at any time?"
“A daughter. I had no ambition above that once.”
Downstairs in the kitchen, their husbands were sitting silently at the table. The maid had been shooed away by the formidable guest, who'd sat down next to the woman's husband seconds after the doctor had gone upstairs. The men sat in silence, both trying not to wince at every fresh scream. Both failing.
In the morning, both men were still and cold.
When she turned her attention back to the stage, King Lotharon was sitting. Cerise, who Molly had met the night before, stood on the stage. Her arms were still swathed in bandages, and she looked exhausted, but she looked at Jamiarty with a fiery, powerful hatred.
“Thanks, mate.” John was still smiling, although he suddenly looked a trifle nervous.
John wasn’t smiling right now. He had pulled away from Sherlock completely .
“Grezzik!” she screamed in anguish. “Grezzik, HE’S GETTING AWAY!”
“I will! And I choose—good God, is that a fire?!”
“Welcome, your Grace, your Highnesses.” Janine inclined her head.
“I love you, John.” Sherlock kissed his hand, lips on his wedding band. “Pass the potatoes?”
Hope you all enjoy this modern take on Kitty's story...it'll be a bit different from the Victorian (hopefully that was made clear from her...ahem, dramatic entrance) :) The next chapter will be up on Saturday, and so forth until this arc is complete.
"Actually, I'd appreciate it," John said. He bit his lip to keep it from twitching. "Go on, then."
“Excuse me?”
"I don't want to be a ballerina," Rachel sobbed. "I want you to be alright!"
"Mummy, my grandfathers are going to be alright, aren't they?" Rachel asked. She was nearly ten, knew the secret, and was also far too good at figuring out the exact questions people didn't have answers for.
“Well of course it’s non-consensual, it’s for interrogation!” Janine’s grandmother shook her head. “I still don’t know how you’re going to manage your laws when you become Queen, my dear.”
“We’d never be here,” John answered hoarsely. Kitty held Rachel out to him and John cradled the baby—
“Will you write back?” Mycroft asked. “That will be helpful, to ensure that I am writing the proper sort of letter.”
Jim was not in love with Sherlock Holmes. But he wanted him.
Queen Bella took his arm. “Husband, sit down. Sit down, please.”
“John?” Sherlock was at his side in an instant. “John, what’s wrong?”
"Of course."
“Hello everyone,” Lestrade said cheerfully. “I know it’s tradition for the best man speech to go before tea, but it’s also tradition to have only one best man and several more boring people here, so I reckoned we could do away with that.”
We will keep together what measure of trouble and sorrow our lives may lay upon us,
"Gruner's not married yet," Sherlock interrupted. "Your friend isn't beyond us until then. You haven't slept in at least forty eight hours and you've got a twisted ankle. The best thing for you to do right now is sleep. I'll go and make sure you weren't followed. I've got informants of my own, they may be able to give us a lead on where the book is."
Sherlock smiled. The sunlight was not as bright where they sat, in the shadow of the house, but Sherlock’s strange eyes still shone brilliantly.
‘Mrs Hudson will get it,’ Sherlock muttered against John’s lips, yanking John round by his hips and pressing against him from the waist down, giving his still-injured ribs room to breathe.
‘Good,’ John murmured, landing the first blow, making Sherlock twist on the bed and yell. John was still sitting on the backs of his thighs, but it increased the pressure on his cock from where it was sandwiched between his own body and the mattress.
‘Would you like a drink?’ Sherlock said, oddly quiet, oddly polite, as he locked the door behind them, removing his hat and jacket and throwing both over the back of the sofa.
John blinked. ‘I’m sorry, what is?’ he said, sipping his tea, gripping the handle tightly.
John tucked his pen away as well, and lay down on his side, kit bag tucked underneath his head.
‘Excellent. Shame the evidence won’t be fresh.’
‘I love you,’ he groaned, face against Sherlock’s throat. ‘I love you, I love you...’
‘Best not, Doctor. There’s a murdered prostitute in Hyde Park we need you to come and have a look at.’
Sherlock nodded and hesitantly leant to kiss John’s cheek, brushing his spit-damp lips across John’s jaw. ‘You leave first.’
Pushing Victor’s hand away, Sherlock took his cigarette case out of his pocket and lit one, sucking the smoke in quickly, leaving the cigarette between his lips as he put his lighter and case back. ‘I want nothing to do with you, Victor, I would have thought that was quite obvious from the thirteen years of ignoring you and ignoring your wife and ignoring any brats you managed to fuck into her.’
‘Hardly a difficult deduction,’ Sherlock said dismissively, looking over to where John was being introduced to the people who were quite obviously the children’s parents.
Sherlock pulled a face and looked around at the children running on the expanse of lawn that hadn’t been turned over to growing vegetables. A number of adults milled about, drinking something pale out of patterned glasses. Mrs Holmes handed Sherlock and John a glass before leading John over to where a group of adults stood clumped together. Sherlock left his glass on the drinks table, his eyes sweeping around the garden once more before resting where a tall, handsome-looking man stood, his ginger hair parted at one side, curling at the very edges. He had a neat moustache and kindly eyes and a large, easy smile.
Sherlock pulled Mrs Hudson’s chair out for her, kissing the top of her head before he sat himself at the head of the table. He took the cigarette John had pushed out of the packet for him and put it in between his lips, leaning forwards, placing the tip in the small orange flame that snapped up when John flicked the wheel of the lighter.
Mycroft swept his torch along the opposite bank. Foliage, ferns, flowers, scattered across the outcropping of rock, and in the middle, a pair of pale white buttocks, suit trousers caught around a pair of pale white knees, a pair of pale white hands clamping shut a mouth. A shock of red hair and a pair of pearl earrings and a powder blue dress, stained with grass and mud.
‘Oh yes, very serious,’ John mumbled, giggling as he rested his palm on Sherlock’s upper back, oblivious to the audience they had attracted at the edge of the floor. ‘We haven’t quickstepped since before the war, this is--’
care about polite, you can't just tell someone you're coming to lunch and then not turn up on time, it could ruin the dinner and there are--' John whimpered as Sherlock tightened his hand around John's arousal, his mouth moving back to the scar, '--there are --
,’ Sherlock grumbles, collapsing in his usual position on the sofa, one sodden arm slung over his eyes. ‘It would have been so much easier to just
His skin flushing pink, Sherlock closed his eyes and frowned slightly, pressing his lips together for a brief moment before he spoke. ‘I want you to spank me, John,’ he mumbled, stretching out underneath John, pushing his bum up slightly.
The salt-laced air kissed John’s cheeks as he stood at the head of the path leading down to the beach. Over the sea lay England, and London, an home. The dull, throbbing pain in his shoulder seemed to lessen somewhat as he stood atop the sand dunes, staring out across the lines and lines of men in uniform.
‘Do you want to hear the rest of this?’ Lestrade asked, waving his notebook.
Other couples moved back into the space John and Sherlock had vacated as John dug in his pocket and handed a shilling over to Sherlock. Sherlock grinned and flicked the coin to the boy manning the record player and flung his arm around John’s shoulders. ‘And you still owe me a dance,’ he murmured against John’s ear, breath warm and moist in the late night chill.
by Dylan Thomas. I struggle for time to reply to comments individually these days but please do know that I appreciate and am very thankful for your responses to my writing. <3
Freddie’s struggling weakened bit by bit, Moriarty deeming it safe enough to nudge his legs open again and thrust back into him. ‘Good boy,’ Moriarty purred, thrusting furiously, his usually immaculate hair falling into his eyes as he fucked into the just-twitching boy, coming with a guttural moan at the moment Freddie’s eyes went glassy and his body went limp.
‘I... I thought I loved him, once.’ Sherlock made an unhappy face and sighed heavily, his next words coming in a rush. ‘We were at Oxford together, he’s the one Mycroft caught me with, he was my friend, my
A red bus rounded the corner just as John bent to take one of the larger cases inside, rolling his shirt sleeves to his elbow and bracing his weight on his good leg, grasping the handle.
‘Hello,’ Sherlock replied, taking John’s hand in what could be mistaken for shaking it, rubbing his thumb over the soft inside of John’s wrist. ‘I’ve missed you,’ he whispered as Mrs Hudson stepped inside her flat and laughed gleefully, flipping the light on.
‘Settle,’ John barked, his tone indicating that there would be
‘No,’ Pierrot said, playing with the hem of Sherlock’s trousers.
‘I can’t say for certain.’ Nettle knelt down on the stained carpet next to Sherlock and rubbed his sweaty palms on his trousers. ‘He caught a piece of shrapnel in the shoulder. Weren’t any doctors around, weren’t anything to clean it, he just. He got ill. Very quickly. Over in an afternoon. Last thing he did was write to you.’
Mycroft paced the length of the hall.
‘Oh, Sherlock, keep your hair on. People are interested!’
‘No,’ Victor agreed with a sad laugh. His eyes caught on the picture of Sherlock in his Home Guard uniform, propped next to the telephone. He smiled briefly. ‘He looks pleased.’
‘Yes,’ he said hoarsely, adam’s apple bobbing up and down as he did so. ‘Yes, I want it, I want you.’
John took a step back and ran, the mud clinging to his boots, making movement extraordinarily difficult. He growled in frustration, sweat mixed with dirt dripping down his face, arms and legs aching, blisters bursting inside his boots as he fought with the mud. A bomb hit the heart of the village, behind John, and he turned to look for a fraction of a second before a second bomb hit the field John was in, its own banshee wail drowned out by the first.
The marigolds in the window box outside bobbed in the early evening breeze. Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s side, just below his underarm, and closed his eyes. ‘Doesn’t make it any less unfair,’ he murmured, breathing in John’s scent from his skin.
‘You can’t just--’ Sherlock cut himself off and snarled, hands going to where his fine leather braces rested at his shoulders. He thumbed them off and hastily began to undo his shirt, his eyes locked with John’s.
The boys giggled. ‘Go on, what else?’
Both of them continued to dance slowly to music that wasn’t playing.
Mr. and Mrs Turner smiled politely and nodded.
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ Sherlock murmured throatily, bringing one of his hands to John’s front, hooking his thumb in the waistband of John’s grey trousers. ‘Perhaps I’d like to undo these buttons--’ he tapped at said buttons with his fingers, ‘with my teeth.’ He bit down on John’s earlobe, causing John to shudder and drop the bar of soap he’d been holding into the sink. ‘Perhaps I fancy parting the material and pressing my tongue against you before I drag down your underwear--’ Sherlock inched his hand into John’s trousers and began to stroke John’s cock lazily, ‘before I drag down your underwear, and then swallow you whole.’
He shook his head, pulled on his hat, scarf, gloves, coat. He would post the letter on the way to the hospital.
There was a silence. Mycroft took a deep breath. ‘I wanted to see how you are.’
‘I don’t imagine that’s the case, no. Why don’t you see if you can use your... your deductions in your line of work? Is there a profession where you could do that?’
‘So are you, Doctor.’ Victor smiled. ‘And I’ll do my utmost.’ He shook John’s hand again. ‘Look after him, John.’
Moaning, Sherlock shook his head, his fingers playing at the edge of the scar. ‘No,’ he said. ‘It’s interesting and... and good, and part of you.’ He let his hand drop down John’s chest and moved it to wrap around his own cock, closing his eyes tightly as he applied a tight pressure.
‘Ten bob and a go between those dolly lips of yours,’ the man said, reaching out to touch Moriarty’s reddened mouth. Moriarty clamped down on the man’s wrist with his fingers and shoved the hand roughly away.
Sherlock nodded.
‘A shilling
John smiled as he flipped the postcard back over, shaking his head at the cartoon on the front with its allegedly hilarious gag about breaking wind. No doubt Sherlock hadn’t even looked at it before buying and sending the thing.
The dying light from outdoors cast the bookshelves that surrounded them into shadow. A breeze blew in again and a clock chimed once in the silence.
Sherlock glanced at John and then out of the window again, face pale.
‘I’m not a child!’ Sherlock exclaimed as he pulled onto the huge drive, parking the car next to Mycroft’s.
Sherlock ducked his head, looking like an overgrown schoolboy rather than the young man of twenty he was. ‘Not exactly the career choice Father has in mind.’
‘As you wish.’ Sweat broke out at John’s temples as he thrust into Sherlock’s grip. ‘My god, you’re lovely,’ he murmured, kissing Sherlock again, lying half on top of him.
And would it have been worth it, after all,
‘It’s rather late for all of that, don’t you think?’ John straightened his back and widened his stance, easing the pressure on his leg. Victor’s gaze dropped to the floor.
Sherlock visibly perked up, rubbing the soap aimlessly down his arm. ‘I want a pickled egg.’
Glancing at John, Sherlock began to move backwards as John led them in a faltering box step to the music. They reached the living room and Sherlock stretched one of his arms out to start the record again. He pressed his lips to John’s forehead for a long moment as they moved slowly around the sitting room, John wincing every now and again.
‘Yes, ah... sorry I’m late.’ John coughed.
‘Well, I hate being undercover
John pointed towards the sky. ‘We’d be sitting ducks, Nettle,’ he said quietly, so as not to attract the attention of the NCO at the front. ‘Best to keep walking.’
Nettle checked the door number against the number on the bloodstained letter he held in his hands. He took a deep breath and rang the bell, tucking the letter back into the large envelope he’d acquired for the purpose.
‘Let ‘em have the fucking place. The French fucking hate us as it is - they can have their empire, we can keep ours, and Bob’s your uncle and Fanny’s your fucking aunt.’
‘Sir.’ A young woman in uniform dropped a telegram onto Mycroft’s desk.
‘Where it happened,’ John finished. ‘What did you tell Lestrade?’
The weak morning sunlight spilled over the bench and dead potted plant the roof was home to. Sherlock pulled John close and kissed his forehead, arranging them both in a loose hold, beginning to sway back and forth. Sherlock began to sing again, barely above a whisper.
‘Your left thumb. Are those your girls?’ Sherlock nodded towards where two children with long ginger curls ran around with the others.
‘Please.’
On the back:
‘I’ve already eaten today.’
‘Wrong. I look a fool. I expressly told them that I wasn’t having any of it, playing at soldiers in a field, for God’s sake. It would be bad enough if it was just with the others at BP, but there’s dozens of old boys from the Somme and every other stretch of mud from Ypres to sodding Verdun bawling about jerries and--’
Grinning, John kissed her again and left their little cottage with a wave, closing the gate carefully behind him.
‘Who has?’ John prised the lid of the tin open and folded a cigarette paper out, sprinkling some tobacco onto it.
‘We miss him very much at home,’ Frank’s mother said, her east end accent thick. ‘Still, he’s very happy here,’ she added, clearly taking great care to pronounce the letter ‘h’.
‘You really do. Shh, now.’ They kissed. Sherlock’s body was warm and tight inside. They both shuddered and outside, the sun went down.
‘Beautiful,’ John murmured, stroking Sherlock’s face with the back of his hand, kissing him again, harder this time. Sherlock started to come back to himself, his senses and mental functions returning to their usual state. He sighed breathily and grinned up at John, who leant down for another, slightly more insistent kiss. ‘So fucking gorgeous, Sherlock, Christ, I...’
John procured lube from the bedside table and squeezed it awkwardly onto the hand that was inside Sherlock’s trousers, pulling his fingers out all the way, yes, yes, and God, no,
‘Bed,’ Sherlock said, pushing one of John’s braces off his shoulders, spidery hands suddenly everywhere. ‘Take me to bed.’
‘It can’t be as bad as nineteen forty-three,’ Sherlock said.
‘And then scalped...’
‘You’re covered in blood.’
, Sherlock,’ he murmured, low and dangerous, and Sherlock gasped, nodding desperately as best he could with John’s hand holding him against the mattress.
The white underwear Sherlock wore had turned see-through, the material clinging to the visible outline of his cock. He clutched his flask in his right hand, his knuckles whitening around the neck. John glanced at Sherlock’s face once more then averted his eyes, cheeks pinking as he wet his lips.
‘Oh, John, this is marvellous.’ He glanced up at John, a look of pride on his face. ‘I’m so pleased. This is... it’s just marvellous.’
They looked at each other for the first time in four years. Both of them smiled, Sherlock snorting half a laugh from his nose.
‘Don’t bother yourself.’ Cigarette in the corner of his mouth, Sherlock shrugged his suit jacket off and rolled his sleeves up, throwing the jacket over one arm and grabbing his drink. Mercifully, the bell rang from indoors to announce lunch and everyone began to make their way inside, giving Sherlock a chance to get away from Mycroft. He went back to lingering near John for a moment before rushing ahead and swapping the name cards at the dinner table around to ensure that Victor was as far away from him as possible and he was opposite John.
John laughed, lifting a mug out of the murky water and placing it on the draining board. He turned and caught Sherlock’s lips in a soft kiss, lifting one wet, slightly soapy hand out of the water to touch to Sherlock’s jaw. ‘I don’t dare, not with this leg.’
An hour later, after taking the dust sheets off Mrs Hudson’s furniture and putting her suitcases of belongings in the appropriate rooms in her flat, the three of them were sitting at the kitchen table in 221b. John fussed with a pot of tea as Mrs Hudson opened a tin full of things to eat she’d brought with her, laying the crab paste sandwiches and slices of dripping cake out on a plate.
Giles Gilchrist was tall and slim with white blonde hair and watery blue eyes. Sherlock disliked him instantly just from peering at him from behind a pillar in the hallway, but Sherlock disliked most people instantly, especially if they had anything to do with Mycroft.
‘Everything’s so very dull without you.’
‘Mmm,’ John replied, taking his hand away after another moment and concentrating on Sherlock’s backside, bending to lick and kiss and nibble as he stroked and pinched and squeezed at the same time.
‘How did you get this?’ John murmured late one afternoon, curtains drawn against the daylight outside as he and Sherlock lay together in bed. He kissed the thick scar that lay just south of Sherlock’s underarm.
Sherlock squeezed John’s thigh and put the cup and saucer in the sink. He sat back and closed his eyes again, tracing patterns on John’s leg with his finger for a quiet moment.
He ran and wrenched the door open before John could ring the bell and shoved his note into John’s hands before striding off in the direction of the library.
‘Yes, my mad flatmate,’ John said, laughing. ‘Who’s on the list for today, then?’
,’ John snarled into Sherlock’s ear, and then there was a solid weight on the back of his thighs and an unrelenting pressure on the back of his neck and his face was being shoved into the pillow underneath his head just as his legs were being pinned in place by John. ‘Now do as you’re fucking well
‘How long ago did your nosebleed stop?’ John wiped the dark, crusty blood away from Sherlock’s nostrils and filtrum.
John frowned minutely. It wasn’t like Mycroft to have not deduced everything about the situation with barely more than a passing glance at Sherlock. ‘He fell in the fountain,’ John replied. ‘Well. Jumped in.’
‘It’s not a trick,’ Sherlock said slowly.
‘I can help. Let me help.’
‘Oh, it was a number of things, Mrs Holmes, please allow me to apologise,’ John said. ‘I insisted on giving the car a check before we left and couldn’t resist tinkering with the thing, and I made Sherlock stop halfway here so that the engine wouldn’t overheat. I’m ever so sorry I made both of us late, I hope lunch isn’t ruined? Mycroft and Mary both expressed a concern--’
‘I ought to go.’ John smiled. ‘Ah... tell Sherlock that I hope his flask’s alright.’
‘Yes, but the sandbags do smell so awful,’ Sherlock replied as John’s money was exchanged for a ticket each, spinning on his heel and leading the way to the platform for the eastbound Metropolitan and District line.
Sherlock looked John up and down and shrugged. ‘Suit yourself.’ He headed outside. John sighed and followed Sherlock out into the cool Spring day, casting a sad glance back at the murdered boy.
John pushed Sherlock’s fringe to one side and gently stroked the side of his face. ‘You need a wash, too,’ he said, standing up to lean over the table and kiss Sherlock’s forehead. ‘Finish your tea and I’ll help you get undressed.’
Sherlock flushed and looked away. John kissed his forehead. ‘It’s not much of an ask, Sherlock, playing at soldiers a couple of times a week,’ he said quietly, drying his hands on the teatowel hanging on a peg underneath the sink before turning and pulling Sherlock into a tight hug.
The knocking became a loud, dull thumping.
‘Rotten thing, divorce. Anyway, darling, what would you like for your tea?’
‘Yes, with a screwdriver.’
He closed his eyes as he smoked, the image of Sherlock at the fountain’s edge - soaking wet and stumbling - replaying in his mind’s eye. It had been nearly four years since he’d let himself think of Sherlock in that way, and the events of today and the artificial distance they’d crafted between themselves over the past year only seemed to exacerbate John’s desire.
Satisfied with a job well done, John began to walk back to the spot where his and Sherlock’s paths had diverted, despite it being earlier than they’d said. After five minutes of walking at his own slow pace rather than trying to keep up with Sherlock, he found a bench near enough to where they’d agreed to meet, sitting down and stretching his leg out.
‘Oh, I won’t inconvenience you any longer, Doctor Watson. Although I don’t suppose...’
‘You clearly know him far better than I ever did, Doctor Watson,’ Victor said quietly. ‘Thank you for speaking with me.’
‘I don’t think anyone’s bothered, my dear,’ John said quietly, brave enough to brush Sherlock’s knee as he reached for a crab paste sandwich.
‘I thought I told you to keep
‘That’s a very bold estimation of both the speed of our stolen ship and our sailing abilities. The Caribbean and India are also in entirely different directions. Normandy would be far more reasonable.’
‘You can’t
‘You know there’s nothing wrong with my leg.’
The air was close and humid, the algae and waterlife in the still pond giving the night a strange, cloying smell. The stars above shone brightly.
friend...’
‘Look,’ John said, taking Sherlock’s hand and squeezing it tightly. ‘You’re fine.’ He looked around again. ‘A lot of these people aren’t.’
‘I think everyone would have to see that to believe it,’ Moriarty replied, laughing again, drinking his tea. ‘What happened to your hand?’ he asked, gesturing to John’s fingers trembling on the handle of the teapot with his cup.
Victor smiled, his perfect teeth showing briefly under his neat moustache. ‘Tell him I’m sorry, won’t you? I think we both know an envelope with my handwriting on it will end up in the fire.’
‘Start it again!’ he demanded of the young lad of about fourteen who was controlling the record player, waving his hand imperiously. ‘Start the record again!’ He pulled John onto the makeshift dance floor (wooden boards laid flat on the street’s cobbles) and assumed his position. ‘Stop giggling, John,’ he slurred as they waited for the record to begin again. ‘Serious business, this is.’
‘I’m sorry today was a disaster,’ Sherlock said quietly as they sat on a bench on one of the outdoor platforms, darkness creeping in around them.
‘N-not an option,’ Sherlock said, moving his own hand to provide John with some attention. ‘Later... Tomorrow... You can have me slow and sweet and whatever the bloody hell else you want but...’
‘Deduce it,’ Sherlock replied, sneering at his brother.
‘I ought to go soon,’ Sherlock whispered, reaching up to straighten the knot of John’s tie. ‘I’m on duty in the morning.’
“Right, thanks Sherlock,” he picks up his phone and gives the order. Outside they can hear footsteps and raised voices as the news is passed around to everyone in the Yard. Sherlock and John collapse in the chairs in front of Lestrade’s desk and it takes everything Sherlock has to keep from yelling for the DI to sit the fuck down. He rolls his neck and slumps sideways in his seat, letting his eyes slip close just for a few moments…
Sally rushes in without knocking just as Sherlock raises his head, hair slightly mused on the right side.
“John come now, you know that I depend on your input after all you are the doctor.”
“We need to look at some old files. In fact it might be more comfortable if we just have Lestrade take us back to Baker Street with some boxes. It might be a long night.” John resists the urge to groan out loud because he feels like this is just a repeat of the millions of crates of books. However, when they get inside and Sherlock actually speaks to Lestrade about the records he wants there are only five crates to sort through. They grab Thai on their way home and eventually John is sitting in his chair eating Tom Kha Kai. Sherlock is pacing the floor tugging at his hair and John knows that whatever he’s about to say must be upsetting or at least Sherlock thinks it will upset John.
“I love you too John,” Sherlock said to the empty room.
“So what, you are ridding the world of sex offenders out of the goodness of you heart?” John asks, annoyed that a damn serial killer is making more sense than most of the current world leaders.
“Bloody Christ, if you could see yourself,” John breathes, trying to gain enough composure to take over. Sherlock must see his intention in his face because he shakes his head.
I love you Sherlock but I just can’t do this anymore, it hurts. Sherlock clutch the note to his chest and suddenly understood the look on John’s face the previous night, he had built a mind palace and that is the only place they would exist anymore.
“No, not as bad but still rather unsettling. I imagine the killer went a little easier due to the fact that this victim is a woman. Which means he is probably close to his mother. Also he has to have some kind of a moral compass to leave Charlie unharmed.” John just nods as the flow of Sherlock spouting deductions washes over him and it steels his nerves. He lifts the sheet off completely in one go like ripping off a band-aid.
Sherlock’s eyebrows raise in his typical ‘obviously’ way.
“Oh, well the answer is still yes,” He mutters this to the sheets and there is just a smidgen of pink spreading across his cheeks. John gently pushes Sherlock back onto the bed until he is laying down.
This chapter was rough on the writing side thanks so much to my lovely beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes for keeping me sane
“Mycroft if Lestrade wants our damn statements so bad he can bloody well come here himself. Rather than sending his recent conquest, alright?”
Sherlock wishes, beyond just about anything else at that moment, that they were in a cab. He can feel Lestrade’s gaze on them in the rear-view mirror and if he could pull himself away from John’s gaze he would, just to spare him from having to declare the five hundredth time that he is not gay. As though everyone hadn’t heard that enough for a lifetime. The thought is enough to at least drain some of the heat away and yet John’s gaze is still filled with desire. Sherlock squeezes his hand as hard as he dares trying to signal him to relax a bit before they end up jumping each other in the back of a bloody squad car, for Christ's sake. John still seems enthralled though, that or he just doesn’t fucking care anymore. Sherlock leans in, bypassing the mouth that seems to permanently call for him, and instead rests his mouth against John’s ear.
Sherlock worries his lip between his teeth before he answers, “They have all committed sexual abuse towards a child.” John is so silent that if Sherlock didn’t know any better he might think that he had gone into shock.
“Come on,” John says rocking up into him and oh fuck that is it. John can tell the moment that Sherlock switches to needing to pound and it will be the first thing that John sees anytime he’s jerking off.
“So, from what I can tell the time of death was likely around twenty four hours ago, the body was cut up post mortem. It seems our killer left the teeth, which suggests that he wants us to know who his victims are. But the most disturbing bit is that the genitals are missing.”
Sherlock can’t help but be interested in that and he can already feel himself combing through his mind palace for any kind of sacred practices that involve genitals, but a tug at his wrist yanks him back to reality. He knows it’s John cause it would be suicide for anyone else to touch him when he is thinking. He forces himself to bite his tongue against whatever rude outburst was moments away and instead locks his eyes with John’s.
John had been ready to say no, say he had to get back, but that one word stopped him, Sherlock rarely said please. John looked at Sherlock who was looking at the ground and looking so very vulnerable and John grabbed his hand and led him to his bedroom. They climbed into the bed and moved towards each other till they were wrapped around each other in the middle of the bed.
“John, I never wanted to leave you, but Moriarty forced my hand. He would have killed you and it would have been much more permanent. I am sorry for the pain I caused you though.”
“How could he possibly know?” John asks because he really doesn’t see any way that Mycroft could just look at them and be able to tell.
“Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just thought it was his displeasure at your refusal more than anything else.”
“Nothing suspicious?” Sherlock asks for what feels like the tenth time.
“I am not a damn sack of potatoes.” Sherlock just chuckles as he throws on the bed, turns on his radio that he hardly ever uses and begins what could only be called a strip tease. Sherlock bloody Holmes is strip teasing to Cheat Codes. John has to pinch himself to make sure he’s awake then he leans over slightly to make sure there isn’t a damn pit to hell that's opened up.  Sherlock has the rest of the buttons on his shirt open and he’s slipping out of it like it’s water rather than silk. John’s mouth is dry and he finds himself licking his lips trying to just fuck.
It is hours before they come across anything worth talking about.
“Since I felt that way? Probably after the pool incident with Moriarty. Since I acknowledge it to myself? Not until after I faked my death and I couldn’t talk to you. I would dream of you every single night and I’ve been told there were many nights that I would wake up screaming your name. When I got back and found you at the restaurant I was going to tell you. I thought… well I don’t know but Mary was there and you had that ring and well it just seemed better for everyone to not say anything.”
“Right, well let’s get to it then.” John finishes his food and pulls the nearest crate to him. Sherlock is already plowing through the files looking for the killer.
“What’s wrong?”
Sherlock groans as he recognizes the line as his own. Sometimes he thinks he has created a monster but most of the time he’s… proud.
I know I am evil for how I left you at the end of chapter 8. I hope this makes up for it though ;) All my love to my beta @SherlockWatson_Holmes
“I am not going to the music store for new strings if you break those so perhaps play a little lighter.” John supplies this matter of factly as he makes his way into the kitchen. Sherlock’s playing has stopped completely, his shoulders raised up to his ears as though a sudden tension has filled his body. John turns the kettle on and leans against the kitchen counter watching Sherlock’s back. He stands with the violin hanging on his left side and the bow on the right. He lets out a soft sigh before lifting the instrument backup and starting a piece that John has never heard.
Shades of purple reflect in the glass, the last rays of the fireworks caught casting Sherlock’s wet face in color. He flinches every time it happens but can’t bring himself to clean up the remains of the broken mirror. Mrs. Hudson is still at the reception and Sherlock is completely alone just like he was for those awful two years away from Baker street… and him. Sherlock doesn’t like to think about those two years and usually it’s quite easy to keep those memories under lock and key. But John isn’t here, likely won’t ever be again and there is no case to distract him. Sherlock weeps curled up into himself as he remembers a cold night from a year ago.
“But I’m illegitimate,” Sally objected.
“Well, we can fix that! There’s a small county named London. It hasn’t had a Princess in a long time.”
“Father.” Sally laid her head on his shoulder.
“How about you both sit down and spit it out,” Sherlock suggested. He and John sat in their chairs, pulled close to the sofa.
P.S. Jane Steele, by the way, is a fantastic book that everyone should read. It's by Lyndsay Faye, who also wrote Dust and Shadow, which is the best Sherlock Holmes story I've ever read. (May have a slight author crush)
Grezzik picked her up, and Ireni let him without a thought. “I will,” he replied. “For now. These horses can hold me, and when they are tired I can run.”
Everyone looked towards the door. Grezzik stood there, a steaming sword in his hand.
"Well I had to have some kind of insurance, pet. To make sure you couldn't win no matter how lucky you got." Moriarty's eyes went dead, just for a flash of a second, and John flinched. "So here's how this works—if you don't jump, fine. You live. But your family dies."
“I don’t think they’ll let that happen,” Jamiarty mused. “No, I think it might be best to keep that a secret. Just comment on how lovely the baby is and leave. Then I can send a message expressing my shock and disbelief at your report.” He looked at Riley. “You can control yourself, right?”
“Do you?” Watson asked, looking up.
Raz shook his head. “They still need their trial, and the King isn’t back yet. Jamiarty has sent for him. What’s…” he looked around. “What’s happening, Princess?”
"Mummy, Grandad John and Sherlock told me all about being a detective! And it sounds more fun than being a policeman, and they found lost jewels in a goose and saved a lady from being buried alive and they run about all over London and can I be a detective too?"
Unfortunately, Anderson wasn’t the brightest when it came to women. Not only did he not realize that Sally was
Sherlock just held him for a few long minutes, running his hand up and down John’s back, trying to avoid the scars. He pressed a kiss to John’s bad shoulder, then to his temple then tilted John’s face so he could kiss his forehead. John stared back at him, eyes soft with pain.
“Sally Donovan resigned.”
“So…a donor, then?”
Greg shook his head. "I know you're lying.
“We’re the farthest fucking thing from traditional—I’m a retired sex worker, he’s a cop, we’ve been living together for two years, I just…why is this what I want?”
"Don't you dare speak to him that way." While Donovan had kept her voice low, Sherlock raised his, drawing the attention of people nearby. John wanted dearly to look at his feet, but just then Sherlock shifted his gaze to him. The anger bled out of Sherlock's eyes, but the passion remained.
The only sounds were Sally’s quiet sobs. Sally, who still couldn’t lift her child easily, who was still taking painkilling tea every few hours, who’d spent her whole life believing any child she would bear would belong to someone else, was crying, bent nearly double in a chair. Unlike the night of Waverly’s birth, Anderson wasn’t crying. He sat beside his wife, both her hands in his, and stared straight ahead, staring at nothing.
Cheers,
Grezzik picked her up and held her. “Happy birthday, Waverly.”
Once he was dressed too they made their way out to the kitchen. Sherlock heard footsteps on the stairs, wasn’t surprised to see Mrs. Hudson coming up the stairs. She had a large tray of food, too—his and John’s favourites. That was a little more surprising.
“And if he does?”
“Answer it,” John said.
“There’s been no further sightings of the witch,” the Duke announced. “The only person who saw her besides Grezzik was one of the dockhands. She flew in, took a boat, and left.”
Kitty was smiling now. “So I should just ask him?”
John swept her into a tight hug. “We won’t count it as one,” he promised, voice thick. He turned to look at Sherlock. “Suppose we’ll have to flip for it, right love?”
Ireni stepped forward. She spoke three sharp, quick words, and Jamiarty slumped forward, unconscious.
“Waverly? It’s time to get up, Keed.”
“Thank you,” Grezzik whispered. He could see Molly now at the top. She was staring, her sword high.
Watson should have known something was afoot the moment Holmes sent him to the Diogenes Club to ‘pick something up’.
"Which is?"
“As you wish.” And Sherlock flung himself into John’s arms.
“It’s alright, Grandfather,” Billy said simply. “I know. And I won’t tell.” He paused. “You know, you can call him John in front of me now.”
Quote from ‘The Reichenbach Fall’.
Watson was looking determinedly at the ground.
Sherlock seeks the help of a librarian, and he and John discover that John will have to face his old trauma.
From the moment Kitty and Stan met, they'd begun sniping at each other. In Stan's defence, he couldn't have known that Kitty abhorred anything to do with Brontë, so beginning a conversation with a Jane Eyre quote was a mistake, hardly malicious.
The text was brief and curt. Coming home. Have plan. Love S.
Watson leaned forward to rest their foreheads together. "I'm sorry, dear." He pulled away with a frown. "You're warm, Sherlock."
“You’re only saying that because no one ever has.”
