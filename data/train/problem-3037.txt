“Well maybe you shouldn’t leave your clothes laying around,” Dean bit back, taking a sip of his coffee. It had gone lukewarm in the time spent arguing with Sam. Great, he’ll have to get another refill if he wants to stay warm until they got back home. He flagged the waiter down just to do so. “It's warm, so it's my jacket now,” he grinned at his brother.
“How can Cas be in charge-” Sam was gone with the slam of the door. “Asshole,” Dean grumbled, rubbing his nose red. No matter what Sam said, Dean wasn’t sick, he just had a cough and a runny nose. That’s not the flu,that just means he’s been outside for too long. They had spent the morning running around like cocks with their heads cut off after all.
“Told you.” Michael said. “Also, did you just volunteer me to help hunt down an inhuman monster that already killed 3 people?”
Sam stood up and walked over to Dean, he put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Okay.”
“Well.” Sam took a moment to gather his thoughts. “Dean, I think this is the next big thing for me. Saving people and hunting things, and I want to make sure there will be hunters after us.”
The woman pushed Michael down on his ass, and rushed at Jordan from behind. She put one hand on Jordan’s back, and the other on her hand, the one with the knife. Before Jordan could realize what the woman was doing, she had been pushed right up against Dean. And his silver knife was thrust into his back.
The students walked off, Jordan kept her eyes on the “Agents” as they left. Sam gave Dean a look.
“Well yeah, I guess marines are just like that.”
“Easy, vampires.”
“Come on, don’t ‘nothin’ me.”
“Elric and…” Sam looked up from the laptop. “Aren’t those names from-”
Michael grabbed it by the shoulder, and put one hand over its mouth. He stared into it’s eyes, and it started to shiver. Sam looked up for just a moment to see the demon convulsing in Michael’s arms. He couldn’t worry about whatever was happening with them, Dean was bleeding out in his arms. His brother.
“That’s Fullmet- you watch anime?” Sam couldn’t stop himself from laughing.
“Yeah. Okay.”
“Okay.” Sam relented. “Fine, okay.” Sam thought for a moment. “So you two knew that thing was a wraith?”
Btw I didn't put Cas in the listed characters bc I wanted to make his entrance a surprise!
“True.” Sam said, thinking about his answer. “What would you pick then?”
“Nothing.” Sam made sure the kids were out of earshot.
Dean didn’t remember how he got on his hands and knees. He heard the banging at the door. Where was he?
“We’re listening.”
“Yeah yeah.” Jordan waved it off. Michael did a casual salute. “Don’t mention it.”
“Well you two obviously know your way around a monster.” Sam said. “So are you hunters or…”
“Okay?” Dean asked as his brother walked past him, taking Miracle to the car.
“No, I just made ‘em up.”
Sam pulled his gun on her. “What the hell are you?” he asked. “Both of you?”
Jordan took a deep breath. “Yeah.” She said, almost nonchalant. “Cas is alive.”
“Actually, he mentioned more than one.” Michael corrected.
“So it’s a-” Dean stopped to look back to Michael and Jordan, still not leaving. “It’s what we thought we were dealing with then?”
Hustling was harder, knowing Sam was sleeping alone outside in the car. Dad goaded the guys into games, bragging taller stacks of singles each time. Dean, well, he was the sugar-sweet clutz who missed pockets and grinned mistakes into his palm, catching the eye of anyone assuming an easy win.
No response. He looks at the journal where they'd been recording case notes and his lips pinch in irritation. "How's the research going?"
White chips off the creaking door as Dean shoulders inside, immediately heading for the radiators. He takes in their single storey, placing his canvas on one of the double beds wedged into the timber room. It's gloomy - an arched window at the front, thin panes of glass squashed into the two-tile wide kitchen, where cabinet doors drowsily yawn.
"He hasn't been
It steps out of the mirror and into the mist.
"It's not that bad." Sam shouts, stepping out of the car, his voice either drowned by the crashing waterfall or ignored in his brothers' misery. Mud slips under their boots and when he tilts his head to see the source, stray droplets splatter in his hair and face, trickling down from pine branches.
They wait as he composes himself, posture tense like he had more to say.
His shoulder spasms and he drops the surrender, to concerned shouts down below. These new recruits for his brothers' network weren't exactly Einsteins.
"It'll damage your heart." Cas warns anyway.
hello, thank you so much for reading! this one was much longer than the last, because i wanted to explore sams' displacement as a kid, as well as dean being his parental unit :) i hope this was alright? please tell me what you thought below!
Outside the circle of crackling fluorescent, he can't sense anything strange about the shadows. Braver, he makes to move for the second when a crashing sound shocks him. He waits. When he hears it again, he switches off his torch and dives for the door it came from.
It wasn't just in the car.
"No." Sam responds plainly, trying to find his sentence again.
"Two."
"Excuse me,
"Uh, yeah."
Another voice asks, roiling his heart and sending his speech to a separate stratosphere, paralleling Baby right inside two white lines.
Greeting his husband with a kiss, Daryn gestures to their presence. He scrambles to slam the brakes on this sudden sensory info-dump, tries to maintain neutral as the man shakes Sams' hand first. But fuck if he can't kill his heart rate at that same easy smile, the thick tanned arms leading to a hand that easily dwarfs his in welcome.
Tucking her hair, she offers to buy lunch and his empty stomach soars. They walk with idle chatter into the deserted school, a nice rhythm of conversation. Standing in the sun hadn't helped his smell though and he needs to find showers, searching the unhelpful school signs.
Behind her, Sam had dug down warding into the mud and was whispering what to do, the monster shambling forwards. Alarmed, she shakes her head, but he nods and presses the crowbar into her hands.
"Dude, no. Don’t be a dick to me out there, and we're good." They'd be moving soon anyway, it wouldn't have worked, he convinces himself.
"I can't explain it." Daryn says, hands tight on his glass. "Last night I came down to get water, when fire started coming up from under the cabinets. I tried throwing my glass, but it was… terrifying, it didn't stop." He gulps, wafting imagined fumes away. "It was so hot and the smoke, it…"
"You usually scare them off." Sam responds quietly and it makes Dean laugh.
It didn’t stop their talk though, Dean finding trickles of amusement among the usual town gossip, eyes flickering less to the bar as he enjoys the company. It’s not until Gunner drums his hands on the table to get them another drink that he realizes with a slow curl of dread - he’d just used Dads’ move. He glances to the bottle filled bar, seeing his father firmly in a stupor.
Machete tucked in his jacket, he bursts into the booth filled with stagelight switches, Sammy laughing over shared sweets with his friend. He turns around at Dean’s abrupt entrance and it breaks his damn heart to see his brothers’ confusion morph into anger and then awful acceptance, reaching down to get his bag.
When he wins and acts surprised, his crowd laugh in good spirits, deeply contrasting the shoves Dad endures as he silently takes their singles to the bar. He takes a table near the window with sand caught in its' scratches, keeping an eye on Sammy outside and Dad in the reflection, settled for a long night.
take Cas out on a date, he'd dream up more than a motel evening. They'd see a movie, not one they'd already watched though. No, something new, for both of them.
"See you soon." It's a promise.
Cramming his freakout far below detection, he shrugs and stands, leaving his brother to investigate in the living room. "Sure."
"I'm waiting for someone." His hearts slows. "Mrs Parish needed to go."
Sam had a secret he was keeping from Dad - he really liked the theatre club.
, hurriedly he changes the shapes so they don't bring a creature into the already charged room.
i had a bunch of fun making the lore for this creature and also the water related names - as always, i'd love for feedback if you have any below, it'll really help how i form the upcoming chapters! about the case or characterizations, anything <3
It's staring past them, forgotten snacks. It's main meal stands horrified by his brother.
"There was this girl at school today-"
Sam raises his eyebrows. "Are you advising our dog on how to beat me, at a walk?" He laughs at Deans' bad cover up, clearing his throat and straightening his jacket.
Their eyes slide in sync to the butchered bloodied face staring out at them through a gleaming metal bar.
Sam slips silently away, ignoring the sigh. "Next town, it won't be like this." It's not a promise his brother can keep, knows that he'll try anyway and will bruise for his troubles.
"Why are you humming
Daryn drifts his fingers over the frame, head tilting softly in remembrance. "This was the Clayton House in Scottsdale… oh, everyone was stunning that day." Sam stops when the glossy image filled with floating lights and an arch of flowers slides under his gaze. It beams, each catch of light shining on another person's smile. "That's all my side and then of course, Gunners' sisters there." His finger taps two smiling faces, one who's black hair curled into a bun and the other who's blonde curls fell forwards.
, genius. Go get us some food before the stores shut."
"It's rude to take back gifts." She grins, verging on a cackle as her thunderous father curses the other for teaching her manners. She plays keep-away with it all the way back to the kitchen, until Eileen trips her and it devolves into a wrestling match.
“Chin up and dazzle them, fighter.” That’s all Dean has time to advise before he’s running down hallways and closing doors - the more they can funnel this thing, the better.
Dean slaps his shoulder, indicating he would handle this as Sam continued investigating. But, despite a triple check for symbols or hexbags, there's nothing besides a stack of receipts from a company called
"It's nicer than you think." Cas says with an air of someone who was around to see the damn grapes get plucked.
A fresh beer lands next to his knuckles and he tips it against the other, looking over as he drinks. Sure enough he's being watched but, distractedly. "Something up?"
So what, he's going to be somebody's secret again. Just because this has been one of his better catches didn't mean he got to hold on. He struggles in the silence, knowing he can't keep him hooked forever.
"I'm real glad these fires are getting the attention they deserve." Gunners' accent had changed, smoother and mature. "Daryn, did you tell 'em about the others already?"
"Sam," Dean struggles, halfway between a plea and a snap. "I know you want to do your play, I know, and I'm
“Take the other corridor.” Dad commands and Dean does just that.
, no, instead he's in some state charming the shit out of hunters he'd never met, who wouldn't think twice about making an angel a prized possession.
Miracle bounds over and Dean chucks the stick out into the field. "What did you see them as?"
Avery should be along shortly, she was helping get the lights out of storage." He waves back hesitantly as she leaves, exhaling in the sudden silence.
It's not bad to be known, not bad at all.
"Go, go, go, get it open for us while I hold o-
, he was that lucky.
"I tried - I asked him, okay?" Through the blur of tears, he sees the crack in Deans' defence, the bruising around his eyes that only appeared after a sharp slap to the head.
That's not his problem.
Aldana blinks, somewhere far away as she speaks with a sleepy slur. "One… my sister."
“What the hell, man." He says, wiping the spot with a shudder. He doesn’t look at Gunner as he throws his shirt on, checking his reflection with a burst of nerves. A reluctant sigh beside him makes him flickers a look to the flex of muscles. He kept playing this cat-mouse game with the guy, flicking on a flame only to douse it before it could really race into a forest fire. Confused, his heart stutters on the dejection shadowing the kind face he'd come to care for - why did he stop?
“Why?”

managed to fight his way through the commitment issues, emotionally unavailable, afraid-of-love bullshit Charlie had been lecturing him on for years, now wasn’t the time. “I’m sorry I was angry,” Dean said instead, and Cas smiled at him, and he knew it was over and everything was okay.
“Okay. How?” Charlie responded, unfazed, and Dean frowned. “I was hoping I’d figure that out once we got here.”
“You are Batman.”
,” he said, offended, but Charlie just rolled her eyes and stood.
Amelia confronts James. Dean schemes.
, okay? What was I supposed—” He realized that Castiel was laughing, and had chased Dean’s hand across the table to hold it in his own again.
“Tempting, but I’ll pass.” He’s pushing himself out of his chair and reaching to take his laptop back from Sam when Cas walks into the library, arms filled with the next set of old books to categorize, and when he smiles at Dean it’s so fond that he doesn’t have the heart to be irritated about losing another day with him to their archiving project.
“What was?”
Dean scoffs.
Amy widens her eyes and shakes her head. “Oh, no. We come here every year, and we’ve

It takes a moment but then Sam laughs, and then Eileen laughs, and even Cas grins, one of the rare ones that shows his gums, and he (finally) crosses the driveway to slip his hand into Dean’s. Claire and Kaia share a confused look but join in as the laughter grows, and when they’re

He trailed off there, and something warm and comforting bloomed in Dean’s chest. He slid Castiel’s phone back across the table towards him, then left his hand there, open, inviting. Cas slid his own hand in without a second thought, and he linked their fingers together.

animal,” he gestures to the Yeti, “we might as well save the rest of them. At least turn the poachers in to the authorities.”
The last word sounded more defeated than angry, so Dean forced himself to look up. He swallowed and nodded, not wanting to apologize a third time, and they held tense eye contact for a long second before Castiel sighed, rubbed a hand across his face, and took a step forward. “I’m sorry,” he said, softly, placing both hands on Dean’s shoulders. Dean felt even
It’s nearly 4am when they get back, and all Dean wants to do is crawl into bed, but the caged Yeti in the backseat (and the other one in the cabin) demand more immediate attention. As it is Cas is already appearing at the car as soon as Dean turns off the ignition—without even saying hello he yanks open the car door and then the cage, and attempts to coax the creature out in the same soothing tone he’d used for the first one. It doesn’t work, though—the scared Yeti curls into the back of its cage, teeth bared, not moving.
Unfortunately, the blonde woman didn’t seem to agree. She blinked, then quickly shook her head. “No. Listen, I know you mean well, but if there’s anything I’ve gotten from all this, it’s that no matter how sad they are they don’t even want to talk about what happened. I can’t imagine forcing them together would go well.”
Before Cas actually did die. Before Jack blew up and then became God and Eileen disappeared and reappeared and you had the whole—” he gestures vaguely at his own shoulder, “—shooting God thing. Come on, man, we deserve a break.”

By the time he fell asleep, Dean had an idea. A

They pull up to the warehouse a few hours later, park the impala out of sight, and Dean sneaks up without warning to rap on the window of her red car. He’d feel bad for laughing at the way she jumps if Kaia didn’t also laugh from the passenger seat. Claire glares at her girlfriend, then turns the icy stare on Dean as she rolls down the window.

There’s a heavy sigh. “Yeah, okay.”

Dean looks down. He shrugs. “I was thinking, uh. You’re always going on about us needing a vacation, right? So let’s say this doesn’t shake out—or if it does, but it’s painless—I figured we could hang around a bit. You can grab Eileen, we’ll call Jack down from God duty, and…you know. Relax.” He looks back up at Sam, who looks even more confused.
Cas looked up and shrugged slightly. “You’ve met two of them.” And as that was Dean’s only real rebuttal, he was at a loss again.
) even without any of his family backing him up, so they all trudge off to bed with the promise of Dean proving them all wrong tomorrow.
Cas doesn’t slow down, but he acknowledges Dean with a sidelong glance.
, right?”
Claire calls them three hours in with the basics—they found the place, looks like there’s only two guys, they’re right on time because she overheard them talking about moving “the cargo” later tonight, and—yeah, there’s another Yeti.
“Huh.” Dean eyes them in mock suspicion. “We’ve heard some rumors of weird sightings, but kinda thought it was just bears.”
Sam doesn’t share the sentiment, though, which becomes obvious when Dean slides into the seat across from him in the library. “A kid fell down the slope and broke an arm, Dean. That’s not a case.” He waves his hand at Dean’s laptop screen, where the article is pulled up.
“Apparently not.”
It had sounded better in his head.

“Dean.
But until Charlie updates them, there’s nothing they can do. So Dean sits against the wall, with Cas, drinking their coffee, and when he drains the mug he presses a kiss to Cas’ temple before climbing up to go make lunch.
“Right. And how do we know that?”
Step two was to search her face for any sign of recognition.
estranged from you didn’t even tell your fiancée.” She pointed at him. “Tell me that makes sense, Jimmy.”
“You nerds have fun,” he grumbles, but there’s no heat behind it, and he squeezes Cas’ shoulder as he leaves.
Claire scoffs. “There is
Will Ferrell's voice drifts out from inside, meaning Elf has won the battle.
“So we
Oh. She had forgotten about that.
This is another cliffhanger but only because I want consistent chapter lengths, the next one is already written and will be up today too :)
“I didn’t know you were on Twitter,” Sam frowns, either missing the point or ignoring it.
In the full light, James could see the entirety of the hurt/angry/panicked expression on his fiancée’s face, and he stopped. “What?” he asked, and she stood, arms crossed tightly.
Hours later, Castiel snoring softly beside him, Dean was staring up at the dark ceiling and doing the exact opposite of letting it go. There was always a way to fix it—Dean had Bob-the-Builder'd his way out of enough situations to learn that. He just needed more intel.
“I’ve met your brothers,” he argued back, because it seemed the most obvious fallacy. Gabriel lived close enough that they saw him somewhat regularly, and he’d met Michael over an incredibly uncomfortable dinner while he was in town for business. Neither of them had mentioned a mysterious twin.
“It was beautiful,” Eileen ads, and Dean feels a little bit bad about not noticing her appear next to Sam. He leans back against the car and looks around, surveying the notably Yeti-less space.
getting in my car.”
She signs off, and that gives them an hour or two to prepare for whatever wild snow leopard/Yeti rescue mission they’re facing, which means it’s time for more coffee. He brings a mug to Cas and slides down the wall to sit next to him on the floor—he’s with the Yeti, who still doesn’t trust anyone else. Cas accepts the coffee with an appreciative smile and leans instinctively into Dean’s shoulder.
“You’re right, you know? We were supposed to be close. And we were. But I…needed a break.”
“Just a few more hours, buddy,” he says to it in what he hopes is a calming voice, and Sam spends the trip back feeding it strips of steak from the passenger seat.
“Maybe that means you shouldn’t be investigating,” Amelia pointed out, and Dean frowned. He shook his head. “I know, man, but…he just seems so
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah,
A few hours later, she pulled out her phone, finding the message thread created when Dean had texted himself the picture. Taking a deep breath, and hoping for the best, she typed out a short message.
Dean can feel his cheeks heating up with the praise. He looks away. “Thanks, Cas.” He mumbles.
. Dean raises his eyebrows and leans back. “Oh, yeah? What’s over there.”
“I’m glad he’s doing well,” Dean tuned back in at the sound of Cas’ voice, and he looked up to see his boyfriend smiling softly at the phone. He looked back up at Dean and held his gaze, smile faltering.
endangered. And that’s without getting into all the folklore about what they mean spiritually. Cops find one, they’ll end up being poached too. It ain’t work the risk.”
Amelia sighed, checking her phone for the time. “Listen, it’s been really great meeting you, but I have to go. I’ve already eaten up enough time, and I have an exam Monday.”

hunts ever turn out to be Yeti rescue missions.”
“Is there something you want to tell me, Jimmy?” she asked, trying to fight the anger. It didn’t really work.
“Hey, Sam? You think Claire and Kaia are still in Nebraska?”
” Charlie retorted. Dean began to respond, but Charlie quickly shushed him before he could, eyes wide and gesturing entirely too unsubtly to the door behind him.
But then there’s a soft noise from behind Cas, closer to a whine than a growl, and suddenly the smaller Yeti is clawing its way out of the car and past Cas to throw itself at the larger one, who’d followed him out of the cabin. Dean watches through the car window as the two hug, and he smiles. He’s seen that before.
There’s a pause. “Like. Monster poachers, or people poachers?”
to make out with you.” The emphasis was on ‘trying,’ and Dean winced.
Cas turns to face the rest of the group, still frowning. “Exactly.”
Cas sighed heavily, removed his lips from where they had been working their way down Dean’s neck, and dropped his forehead to his shoulder.
When Dean had convinced Sam to let them take this case, this wasn’t what he had in mind. Somehow, the possibility that he’d be barreling down the highway on his way to save snow leopards on the off chance they’d walked away with more than one Yeti—more than one because the first one was still at their cabin Sam’s girlfriend, his ex-angel boyfriend and his son, who was simultaneously 3 years old and
He shrugged. “Nothing more than that Jimmy exists, and he snapped at me when I tried to ask more.”
enough? Was it because—
“We have to stop them,” Jack is already rising from his chair. “Snow leopards are nearly endangered, we can’t just—"
that’s not me, that’s Castiel.” He said, as if that was supposed to be helpful.
He knows even less of what to say than Cas did, and he’s reaching out for the standard shoulder pat, but—“It’s okay, Dean,” Jack says, and Dean drops his bag of groceries to pull the kid—
Dean stared at him, mouth open slightly. Cas was really sticking to this story, and even though it was

I’ll help archive the library for a week.”
Cas looks so proud he might burst, and Sam smiles and leans across the sofa to clap him on the shoulder. “That’s really great, Jack.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not risking Baby’s paint job in a shootout.”
“I’m not gonna just—
The smaller one looks like it’s about three seconds away from sprinting into the woods and never coming back, but the bigger one makes a soft noise and looks at Jack, who'd wandered out of the cabin after it. He steps forward and reaches out a hand, the Yeti takes it, and Jack smiles. “I’ll be right back,” he promises, and then…disappears.
Dean knows it was the wrong thing to say as soon as Cas stops walking and turns to glare at him. “My memory is immaculate. I have no idea why, but there
“Fine,” she bites out, but the back door lock clicks open anyway. Dean grins as he yanks the door open and climbs in, and Sam mumbles a sheepish

Cas takes a step forward. “Cas—” Dean starts, but he’s shushed before he can keep going.

pay off.
Step one was to casually walk to the trash can, ‘accidentally’ shoulder-checking the blonde woman on the way. Just enough to make her stumble, enough that it would be plausible for Dean to catch her by the shoulder, already apologizing.
the first chapter got so much (completely unexpected) positive feedback (thank you all omg) that I had to keep going!

investigate—or, at least, as serious as they can be on the snowmobiles they had to rent because he didn’t want to risk moving Baby in the snow. They hang around the main lodge of the resort, posing as first-timers looking for tips on what parts of the slope to avoid. They finally hit the jackpot with a couple of middle-aged women who are simultaneously warm and welcoming, and eager to gossip over cups of hot chocolate. They go through the standard spiel about easy hills for beginners, but then one of them (the one on the right, named Amy) leans in conspiratorially. “I’d stay clear of the eastern slopes, though. If I were you.”
Neither of them had any idea when, in a windowless lecture hall, in the middle of her economics class, Amelia got a panicked text message accompanying the worst photo she had ever seen.
Dean couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Dean blinked at it, staring at his phone just steps in front of his classroom, and he could feel the blood rushing in his ears as his vision turned red—to match his face, he was sure. But if there was

Dean froze, staring back at his boyfriend, who seemed blissfully unaware of what he had just
“What?”
“I thought I was going to die, Dean. I shouldn’t have put you through that. I shouldn’t have left you like that.”
Dean kept his eyes on the road, smiling to himself.
Michael leaned over to Jordan. “So you think these guys are crazy or…”
“Oh.” Sam said. “Uh, sorry.”
“Because the one thing I want...”
“Well I don’t want that wraith to kill anyone else.”
“What?”
“Well maybe you should hear different.” Sam said. He knocked his hand against Dean’s, a sign for him to calm down. “Cas was a hero, he was family.”
“Well the new boss missed having him around.”
The two of them laughed. It was the first time Dean laughed since…
Getting back into the motions of hunting without Cas was strange. Dean still had Sam, and now he had Miracle too, but how could he not feel like there was something missing? Not to mention Jack was gone too. Not the same kind of gone, but he wasn’t around. He kept telling himself the same thing he’s been telling himself ever since dad didn’t come home from that hunting trip.
“I’ve been alive a long time, Dean. And time never really meant that much to me. Just watching the earth spin for centuries at a time. But then I found you. I raised you from hell. And the moment I touched you, I felt something unique.”
“Sure, that’s a word for them.” He leaned his head on the shaky window. “Think Cas is gonna invite us to his wedding?”
“Always been a hard worker.” Jordan said. “Took him a while to get on the right side of history, though.”
“I love you too, Dean.”
“I know… that there is a plan.”
Jordan huffs and they both walk to the car. They get in the back seat and watch Dean make a call. Jordan crosses her arms and slumped in her seat.
“What?” Michael said, also looking out the window. “Oh.” Sam and Dean both turned around and looked out the window. They saw a man standing down the street from the diner, underneath a streetlight. He was wearing a beige trenchcoat.
Dean smiles as he passes them, hauls the groceries to the kitchen counter and pulls out a six pack. When he returns to the living room the fire is lit, and Jack and Eileen have joined them, and the quiet comfort of
Instead, Cas starts speaking in low tones, a language he can’t identify (“Tibetan,” Jack supplies, helpful as ever) and eventually, the creature peaks out from behind the tree. Then, slowly, it creeps towards them. Cas is crouched a bit, as if talking to a child—which is odd, considering this thing is the size of an adult human—and he reaches out a hand. The Yeti looks around at the rest of the group before cautiously taking it.
A sick feeling creeps into Dean’s stomach, Jack looks genuinely distressed, and Eileen has brought a hand up to cover her mouth.
“Could you send me that picture? Of me and Cas?” he asked, suddenly shy. It
"Yeah? Let's find out."
An hour and a half (and some intense debate that Dean
“Claire,” he explains, then sighs. “Look. We’ll just go check it out, alright? If it’s harmless we leave it alone, if it’s a bear we leave it alone
“I love you,” Cas replies, voice heavy with sincerity, and Dean rolls back to face him to pull him down into a kiss.
“Sounds like a plan to me.” Sam leaned his seat back. “Lemme know if you want me to drive.”
“Once you start seeing monsters everywhere you look,” Dean cut in, “you’ll never feel safe unless you know how to kill ‘em”
“So you worked with him?” Sam asked.
“I think so.” Michael said. “Yeah, I think so.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh.” Sam tried to read Dean’s face. “You got plans you haven’t told me about?”
“We wanna help.” Jordan said. The entire table looked shocked. “What?”
“I am.” Michael said. “I think so, anyway. I would say so.”
“Sam, move.” Jordan said, standing over them both.
“Okay.” Dean leaned in. “One more question.”
Hope you all enjoyed this! It was quite a journey to write, especially being my first Supernatural fic. I especially hope that you had a good time reading it, Jo. Hopefully I got your character down good. Despite the late nights, this was such a blast to create. Also if any of you judge me for making a self insert spn character I will find you and move all of your furniture 4 inches to the left. Thank you all for reading! <3
“Did you know who we are before you found us?” Dean asked.
“It came here.” Jordan said. “We’re not near it, it’s near us.”
“Well I was thinking we were gonna leave and go back to living our lives.” Michael said.
“What’s with the look?”
“The years don’t pass me by anymore, Dean. Time isn’t moving on without me, it’s like I finally have the chance to be here. To have a life for myself.”
They sat in silence for a moment.
Dean had gotten used to the idea of letting people into the car over the years. Having people in the back seat, in his seat, that felt wrong to Dean. Sam didn’t think they had to bring them along, but he knew it was the safer option. Michael and Jordan had figured out that these two weren’t FBI, but they still had no idea what they were.
“Good call. I’m sure we’ll be far from the only non-humans at a Winchester wedding.”
“Me too, Dean.” They kissed again. “Wait for me to get dressed, I want to be there when you tell him.”
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas said, wiping his tears on Dean’s shoulder.
“Yeah, you’re taking this really well.” Sam looked back to the two of them. “Have you seen stuff like this before?”
“Four on one sounds pretty good to me.” Jordan added. “I’m in.”
“Yup.” Sam said. “They’ll be fine. You two, though.” Sam looked at them like a teacher looks at a late student. “What are you two gonna do now?”
“You son of a bitch!” Dean screamed back at himself, his voice scraping his throat. “Say something!”
“Happiness isn't in the having. It's in just being. It's in just saying it.”
“Yeah, me and Dean will handle the wraith. You just gotta bring it to us. And remember, don’t touch it’s skin.” Sam went back into the motel room.
“Dean.” Sam walked over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. “Listen.”
“Oh my god.” Michael said. “God! Oh my god! So god is real?”
“Hold up, Sammy.” Dean coughed. “I think this is strike three for me.”
“I love you too, Cas.” Dean choked out. Cas smiled. Dean laughed. “Wow, okay. Can I try that again?”
“Our treat.” Sam cut him off.
They drove off. Something about the reunion they just saw made them feel better about things. They didn’t know what things, but they felt better.
“Hey, don’t tempt me.” Dean leaned in and they kissed again. Dean turned away when he heard the door to the Bunker creak open then closed. “Sammy’s home, breakfast time.”
“Wow.” Sam said.
“And when Jack brought me back, I didn’t know what to do.” Cas clutched Dean’s jacket in his hands. “I thought you might not… I thought maybe you didn’t…”
“Don't do this, Cass.” Dean spoke at the same time as himself.
“Do they usually just poof away like that?” Michael asked.
“Wait, there is... There's one thing she's afraid of.”
“Read about it in the paper tomorrow.” Dean turned to find Sam approaching. He felt that weight leave him again. “The officer saw someone, ran when he saw us. We lost him but I think we were right.”
Dean turned to look at Cas. He was looking up at the ceiling and smiling.
“Oh no.” Dean shook his head. “Sam, no.”
“Well I do, Cas.” Dean nuzzled into Cas. They rocked each other, slowly swaying in the warm night wind. “I… god I was about to sound like a chick flick just then.”
“Yup. You’d be surprised how many characters from that book I’ve ganked.”
“Dean.” Sam rolled him back over. “Dean. Dean, you okay?”
“Wait.” Dean said. “Wait a minute.” He looked up at Jordan again. “You said you know him.”
“What talk?”
“Why are you telling me this now?” the other Dean said. He looked back at himself and wished he could take his place.
“Oh please, a kid with a fancy fork could take it.”
“I don’t know.” Michael said, checking to see if the wraith was actually dead. “What’s going on?”
“Was that what all that weirdness was?” Jordan asked again. “Around ‘09?”
“No, Jo, you think something’s going on here.” Her friend chimed in. “I’m only here because I don’t want you to get attacked by whoever is killing people here.”
“What is?”
“The... The price was my life.”
Dean looked at the small hole behind the dead teacher’s ear. He looks back to Sam and mouths a single word to him.
“So… these guys seem…”
“Your dad sounds like a dick.” Jordan said.
Dean ran to the young woman and helped her to her feet. He told the two kids to stay with the girl and ran to Sam. He pulled the wraith off of, and Sam called out for him as he grabbed it by the arm. Dean fell to the ground and dropped the silver knife, succumbing to the madness inducing powers of the wraith.
“In your dreams, kid.” Dean responded. He heard Sam chuckle. Best feeling in the world.
“God, you sound like my dad.” Michael crossed his arms.
“Wow.” Cas said. He never felt more human.
“And I mean in terms of hunters, me and you are no spring chickens. How much longer do you honestly think we have before we just… can’t anymore.”
“Cas I… I lo…”
“Hey I got no problem-”
“You two? I thought I told you to go home.”
“Okay, let’s hear it. Why ghosts?”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean waved them off.
Sam’s mind raced for a moment then he focused back on the kid. “You’re one of the psychics?”
“Shut it. Sam, hotel, plan, that’s what’s happening and if you don’t like it you can get the hell out of the car.”
“And I wish he wasn’t, just so I could watch that son of a bitch die again!”
“Part time.” Jordan said. “Quit a while ago.”
Sam patted him on the shoulder and started on his way back to the table. “Why not?”
“Well I mean I believe in ghosts and stuff.” Jordan said. “So one more supernatural thing being real isn’t too much more to accept.”
“If you don’t want to tell him yet-”
“Sam, how many times have we done this?”
Dean stood up and followed Sam away from the table.
“Nothin’.”
They stood up and hugged Sam. Dean held them both close.
“What are you talking about, man?” he heard himself say.
“Shut up.” Sam said. He felt the blood soaking into his jeans. “You shut up, Dean.”
“Gemini mostly.” She said with a smile. “You’re probably gonna try too, I bet.” They both laughed. “What about you? Aren’t you worried they might put a bullet in you when we tell them?”
“I want a life too.” Sam said. Dean didn’t expect to hear that. “One day me and you, we’re gonna be out of the game. I don’t wanna go out in a fight, Dean. I want to live a life outside of hunting. I always have.”
Dean didn’t answer. He didn’t look at him. He didn’t even look like he was listening. He just looked up. He wondered how he couldn’t feel it before. He spent hours and hours every day just looking up, thinking about him, hoping that he could feel him somewhere out there. And now he can. He cried some more.
“Oh so you noticed?” Dean remarked. “Yeah, big bad battle between Michael and Lucifer.”
“Hard to forget what angel healing feels like.” Dean never took his eyes off her.
“Jordan, I’m having a panic attack because weird creature thing just almost killed us both, and you give me an I told you so?”
“You deserve it, Dean.” Sam couldn’t stop himself from crying too. “You too, Cas.”
Dean and Michael shared a shocked look.
Jordan and Michael walked outside and stood there for a moment in the night air. Michael loved when the night wind hit the perfect temperature, reminded him of a happier time. They found Jordan’s car waiting for them outside.
“Stab wound to the back of the head, right?” Sam asked.
“I’m not giving them the talk.” She said.
“An ex-angel and another one of Azazel’s psychics shows up and I’m supposed to just let you two go?” Sam asked. “Is that what you would do?”
“What was it?”
“He can.” Sam walked to the fridge and grabbed another water bottle. “He said I should come along just for fun.”
“Dean!” Sam screamed. He held Dean and slowly laid him on the ground.
“Okay.” Dean said, cheerily turning towards the students. “Who’s hungry?”
“Hunting.”
Sam looked back up to the kids. Michael laid the woman on the floor, black smoke dissipating around him. Jordan was shouting at him.
“Dean can I talk to you?” Sam stood up. “Alone, for a second.”
“There's... There's one thing strong enough to stop her.”
“We’re still not invincible, Sam.” Dean turned to his brother for a moment, so he knew he meant it. “Just because we took down the baddest sons’a’bitches there are doesn’t mean we get to cruise.”
“Okay. Yeah, I got a plan.”
“I think so.” Cas patted Dean on the shoulder. “At first anyway. But ever since I met you it feels like time itself is… slowing down for me.”
“Yeah.” Dean smiled at his love. “Finally.”
“You’re biased.” Sam said with a smile.
Sam looked them over. He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
“I think they tried.” Jordan said. “At least a little.”
“Okay.” Michael said.
“Well you’re gonna help, right?”
“Listen-”
“I sure hope not.” Dean looked around. He couldn’t help but keep an eye on everything around him. “What are you doing here?”
“Car.” He said sternly. “Now.”
“So that guy was… not just a guy.” Michael asked.
Michael and Jordan stood and watched. Michael held up the girl with one of her arms over his shoulder. Jordan held Dean’s silver knife, ready for the monster if it gets back up. The girl was still hyperventilating.
“Okay, so you get the general idea of all this right?” Dean said, handing the guns out.
Sam was right, and Dean had been thinking about it. No Chuck, no Lucifer, no more big boss villains to beat.
Sam stayed quiet and let Dean talk.
“Nope.” Dean dug into his burger, barely paying attention.
“Okay, why is this awkward?” Dean asked. “This is a good thing, this is finally happening, y’know? It’s everything I ever wanted, but I…”
Jordan helped him to his feet as Sam came out of the hotel room to get them.
“About them.” Jordan waved her arm back at the room. “I’m not sure what I expected from the legendary Winchesters but…”
“Nah, let’s give ‘em the long story actually.” Dean sat up straight in his seat. “Wanna know about God? Well his name is Chuck, he’s a bitchy, self-obsessed writer, he’s a massive douchebag, almost let the apocalypse happen a handful of times.”
“You saw it?” Sam asked.
Dean felt a powerful weight keeping him on the ground. He never wanted to stand up so bad in his life.
“I know.” Cas said, leaning on Dean’s shoulder. “I’m not used to it either, being happy like this.”
“I’m not gonna throw a couple of kids at a monster, Sam! Not like dad!”
“Bingo.” Michael said. “Can’t do much with them nowadays, but I can still take a demon and return to sender if I’ve had a shot of the good stuff.”
“Are they okay?” she asked breathlessly.
“Um… sir?” the taller one asked. “Are we in trouble?”
“I’m sure that unique thing was my bad attitude.”
“Yeah well, he was a dick.”
“So what he’s not gonna show up himself?” Michael stretched and yawned. “Sounds pretty dumb to me.” Michael laid down on the bench, looking up at the handful of stars he could see past the streetlights.
Dean never kissed another man before, but he thought about this for almost as long as he knew Cas. As he pulled Castiel’s face in towards his he didn’t know what to expect. Would it feel wrong? Would it feel uncomfortable? He had never been so scared of anything as kissing the man he loved. But when Castiel’s lips met Dean’s, he knew they were made to meet like this. Maybe at one time Dean would have said that they were destined to be together. But Dean has spent his whole life giving destiny the finger.
“My family.” Dean pulled them both in even closer. “This is my family.” Dean’s voice shook. For the first time in a long time, maybe for the first time in his life, Dean was looking to the future with excitement and joy. He gave Cas a kiss on the cheek. “Finally. My family.”
Dean tried to talk on the drive back to the school. He was out of practice, he wasn’t very good about it. The new kids were, well, kids. Dean thought about them, he was about as old as dad was when he went missing, back when he went to find Sam. They weren’t like him. Maybe he wasn’t like dad. Then again maybe he was.
“This.”
“I think its past your bedtime. Both of you.” Dean pointed to both of them. “Get out of here, it’s not safe.”
“I don’t know.” Dean hung his head. “I don’t know.”
“And he asked you for help? That kid can handle a few vamps.”
“Okay, are we really calling them vamps?” Jordan asked. “What are we from 2003?”
“I just feel like I have to keep making jokes and… the usual bottled up emotions. But I don’t have to anymore.” Dean laid back on his bed. Their bed. “It kinda scares me.”
“Michael, don’t you want to find out what happened here?” she pointed back at the classroom.
“What, you mean a mess?” Dean pulled back onto the highway. “Yeah, but we usually win too so, y’know.”
Sam looked on with a whirlwind of emotion flowing through him as Jordan lifted her hand from Dean’s back. She nearly fell over, but Michael knelt down and caught her. Sam’s mind lost all focus for a moment, then snapped right back to his brother. He leaned over and felt the wound. But there was no wound. Sam looked at the two kids with fear and relief.
“...it's something I know I can't have.”
“So what do you think?” Jordan leaned up against the machine.
“Yes.” Jordan answered. “Who the hell doesn’t know the Winchesters at this point?”
“Look, Dean-”
Dean looks back at the table. Then back to Sam.
“No. But he’s not gonna stop us.” He headed back inside. “Tonight, same place as the last attack. Wait for us in the car.”
“Cas, what—” Dean starts, but he’s already starting deeper into the woods.
“Lucky for you, there was only private plane recorded in U.S. airspace, traveling from Nepal, landing within 500 miles of Aspen in the past week. It landed in Rawlins, Wyoming last Tuesday.”
. They’ve gotta be, like.
Dean tries again. “Would a bear sneak in the open back door of a cabin and raid the fridge while everyone is asleep?”

a footprint—humanoid, but larger. And broader, and shorter, with a larger big toe. When Cas sees it his eyes widen and he crouches next to Sam, reaching out to trace the outline of the print with his bare fingers. When he stands back up, he’s frowning.

Neither of them noticed a young woman, across the lounge, surreptitiously snap a photo and send it off to her best friend.
“It was nice,” Dean tells Cas, later, beginning the nightly ritual of only being able to talk about his feelings when one or both of them is half asleep (he’s
Amelia frowned. “You were just going to let us get married without telling me.” It wasn’t a question. His shoulders sank, and he looked down. “I was going to tell you. I just didn’t know how. You can believe me or not, but I don’t have any way to prove it. I don’t have pictures of us and we haven’t spoken in four years.” He looked up to meet her eyes at this, and she wasn’t sure she’d ever seen him look this sad.
“Snow leopards—native to the Himalayas. They’re poached and trafficked globally.”
There’s a longer pause this time. “As much as I’m all for animal conservation, isn’t that more of a call for someone like Jody than for us?”
“I don’t know, Sam,” he snaps, and it comes out more frustrated than he intended. “Probably before I almost

Dean can’t help but huff out a laugh. “Dude. Weren’t you alive when they formed?”

here,” Cas asks again, later, as he’s pacing back and forth in the living room of their cabin. The Yeti is in the corner, chewing on a steak Dean had been planning on cooking for dinner, but it’s kept it calm for the past hour, and that’s all they can hope for.

Cas stays that way, just kind of watching the world pass in silence, until they stop at as gas station for fuel (both for them and the car) and Dean sucks it up and asks for peppermint syrup in one of the awful gas station coffees.
worse. Was she not
“Uh huh.”
Castiel looked up when Dean approached, immediately greeting him with the wide smile he had come to know and love, but Dean fought off the warm fuzzies and kept his face tight, unforgiving. The smile faded and Cas began to stand, but before he could, Dean slammed himself into the seat across from him and fixed his boyfriend with an icy stare.
"What happened?" Sam asks, swinging a white bag of store food as he steps up the porch. "You're smiling."
Clothes caught in the washing machine, dirty dishes in the sink and an overflowing bucket of rain under a gap in the roof - left in status, as if the home had been plucked clean of its' occupants.
Gunner grins, leaning back on the sunny sliding of his house. "You said that to me before you left. I thought it then and I think it now - when a blood covered boy holding a machete tells you to have a nice life, you get one, because you're scared to become him."
He couldn't get this often. When he tried with girls they got confused why he wanted them on top - guys never offered a choice. He'd be more cut up about it, if he didn't love seeing them like Gunner, sweating, struggling to hold himself up on the arms caging either side of his hips. What he'd give for a room alone right now.
With her waved promise down the hallway, fingers catching the sun struggling through the locker-lined windows, he takes her advice. Sure enough, the door by the blue bucket leads to a room - the gym showers.
for a long time. Look at him, look at us." Aldana persuades. "Deep down, you are a Rivera not a Tarn. His vengeance is not yours to bear." Swaying on her feet, voice a soft plea. "Let him go."
"Shadestalker." Dean stiffens, assessing the threatening shadows around them. “We need to draw it out." Dad gestures where light, music and laughter seep out from under the large door at the end of the hallway. "What's that?"
Before he can convince himself not to, he flicks off the overhead so only distant lights leave slivers of outlines around them. He tilts his chin up and Gunner meets him halfway, in a bruising kiss. Concern, loss, fear tangles with fond, lust, care.
"Hey, don't try to get up, that shelf was rough on your ribs." Dean advises, tying the thigh tourniquet. Her hands weakly push his away in confusion, curling into herself. Once the bandage is done, he backs off and gives her some breathing room. Not that there's much down here.
"Sam Martins. My family just moved here so, I came in early to talk to a teacher." He rattles off the lie, a well practiced performance and her tension softens.
He rattles off his fake identity, normal enough for them to settle again. Daryn rests a ringed hand comfortably on a broad shoulder,
"Got inspired by this guy in high school. Kind of turned my world on it's head and ran - never thought I'd see that heartbreaker again." He leans on the counter with complete recognition in his kindly brown eyes and, well, fuck.
A snip of scissors across the thread. "He never told you what that mark meant?" It's curious in the same way he asked what the rules of a game were before he won it, holding the winning hand. "You should ask him sometime."
"Uh, it's great." Sam says, which spurs the enthusiastic teacher to demonstrate each buttons' use. She explains not to touch the taped down switches, miming an explosion.
"I wish I was there, too."
"That's why," Sam searches in the box, triumphantly folding out two laminated cards. "We should go look at their house."
He knows his brother, covered in protective warding, believes that. Believed they were free, as much as he thought they could stick around in one town longer than a month. Sam drops his head, losing the fire in his argument.
Sanguineous wounds, thick deep carvings into milky flesh that staggered the figure, supporting whatever organs remained inside itself precariously. Its' sightless eyes stare right at them from the mirror, the frame viciously slashed with
Are they under attack? Physically he feels fine, no bleeding eye sockets or sudden heart pains. He tightens his grip on the wheel, and looks again.
The play is in full swing when he sneaks into the booth, Sam and Avery pointing animatedly to their cues and mocking some songs. He leans an arm on the filing case, not needing to see what his brother does in this stuff to know he's having a good time, for once.
It was one of the last horror films they'd watched. He recalls Eileen laughing over the terrible decisions and that Dean was silent towards the end, his hand curling into Cas'. More than anything, he remembers the ridiculous monsters.
Distracted, he checks his circled shoulder with an enochian symbol inside, lines of blue broken by that bite. "Uh, don't remember. Cas wanted me to get it." His brother didn't need to know he'd been searching for an answer too.
A hand eventually touches his shoulder, there long and steady enough for him to know exactly who it is.
thank you for reading! :)
He folds his arms, brown eyes amused in the low light. "I didn't think so. Do you often get that?"
He's steady pulling Dad from his stool, steady working their way into the Impala, steady staring down the dark dusty road ahead. He wonders where the hell he's even driving to, since Dad didn't book a room. He sees Sammy sleeping in the backseat and dreads the day when he'd have to hustle tables too.
She only remembers it and the tempting stories waiting inside, when she sprawls out next to Kaia in bed. Flicking on the bedside lamp, responding to muttered complaints that this was revenge for late night painting sessions, she unbuckles the clasp.
under his breath, a break in the act slips through as Cas grins, rubbing foam into his bristles.
"Someone put a hit out on us." He realises. "Fake us, anyway." From the corner of his eye, he sees Sam lean almost nose to nose with the thing, condensation on the inside of the mirror where the creature pants.
"I hate him." Sam realises, the truth settling in his heart. Tugged like dogs around the world, tied up at stores or schools, never given the time of day unless they made a mess.
"I don't want to go!" Sam shouts from his clenching chest, pushing out of his grip.
"It'll help get the ink off." He stays steady until slowly, she takes it. Her face crumples, breaking off a measured piece.
"No. Whatever, I'm gonna get us a table inside." He points threateningly. "Don't lose him." Sam rolls his eyes, knowing Miracle had joined a particularly precious collection of things that Dean would wreck the world for.
His heart picks up pace, thudding expectantly for him to deny, deny, deny until the danger of discovery passed. But - his question isn't a searchlight, instead it's one of the many homely lamps scattered in the house he shared with his husband.
Murmurs against the sensitive shell of his ear, pulling back from where he crushed Dean into the counter. Muttering
Sam reaches up towards the mirror - the monsters' eyes snap to his hand, tracking where it couldn't reach outside of the thin metal frame. "There's something scratched on the back of this."
, about Cas. His face pinches disapprovingly until Dean catches on, asking sweetly for another order so the waitress walks away.
Dean huffs, amused. "You're kidding."
this shot of serotonins' got some hints about what's in store! from here on out the chapters get long (~10k each kind of long) and can be read as stand alone cases -  they all have relevant trigger warnings at the beginning because I don't want to play with anyone's mental health
"Is she still alive?"
Dads’ tone hardens to flint, staring him down as he shrivels. "You told someone."
"I saw you two in the hallway."
Sam looks at him expectantly and, no way is he leaving. This womans' got their names typed up, ready to bundle their death away as another disappearance. His brothers' eyebrows bounce, making his jaw set. They needed to find more, and this was a chance to poke around. Fine.
"Because, she knows where he is."
"T-there’s only two hallways leading to the stage,” He stammers out. “I locked all the doors. Only way that shadesucker could get a meal now is by blasting itself inside that lightbox."
And the mystery becomes clearer - this twisted being bearing down was, at some point, Wade Tarn. Remnants of what he had been before the creature ate him alive.
Hissing and snarling as his backdrop, he moves low and slow in the shadows, where the monster shouldn't be able to see him. There's a box of bulbs but it's wedged between others and right now, noise is his enemy.
He sees Dad, machete already raised. Particles rip off his brothers' body, the creature clinging to him but it can't scramble a hold. Dual screams cut short as Dad slices the machete through the creatures neck, severing it from the body and spraying ichor blood.
"Gunner."
The slap comes sharp and sudden, sending his head sideways with the force. Skin throbbing under the impact, blood rushing to the surface. He doesn’t dare meet the brimstone brown eyes burning shame into his skin. Blood splatters from his fathers' wound onto the floor, passing silent judgement on his failed soldier of a son.
Distant chatter with clinks of
"Come get me later!" He demands, fighting against his brother as he catches his shoulder.
The room collapses into pants, Dean falling forwards to the floor.
"Think he's a lead?" Sam asks curiously beside him, but he hasn't been able to make heads or tails of this case.
"Vanished but no reports, that's what's been bugging me about this case." Sam stops, holding the newspaper still in recognition. "Get this - B. Tarn wrote all these articles on the disappearances."
Ah, they didn't think that far ahead and as he's spinning a lie, the front door opens. "That'll be him." Daryn explains, standing up as they turn around to greet -
He pats the sleepy sandy head and sets off, a jolly bell ringing as he enters the diner.
"Not this time." He waggles his brows, tapping the cheerleading picture. "I got myself a way to keep busy."
He leans against the column with it’s lone lamp and rapidly inhales, nerves shaking his chest. He’d never forgive himself if this thing got hold of him and made him hurt Sammy. Whistling in air, he sees someone pacing idly between the shadows.
"Yep, it’s starting now and everyone’s wondering where you are." Dean confirms, ushering them down the hallway, cracking jokes until they get close. The light and music pounds, but behind them builds a screech - he pushes at Gunner’s back, forcing him and Mrs Parrish inside the door.
"Oh, hi." His pen hovers, unsure how to explain himself. "These are runes right? It's just my brothers big into… witch stuff." He doesn't feel bad about throwing Dean under the bus for this one. "This rune means 'burning'. Were you trying to hex the room?"
He can sense an awkwardness in the air, as Daryn tugs his gown closer and laughs politely. "Excuse me just a second." He motions, heading up the stairs. Sam wonders what he said out of turn, checking over to see Dean distracting Gunner as he's given free range of the room.
".... parched as hell because the dickbag owner cut our water." Dean speaks into the flip phone wedged between his shoulder and ear, turning the Impala into the sunny school parking lot. "Yes, sir. We'll meet you there. Understood."
A shell of a case, emptiness waiting for them to fill in the blanks and he was irritated Cas was missing out on it. He kept turning to the space over his shoulder, like he did in that month before Cas returned, only this time he
"How in the hell did you work that out?" He asks warily, he hadn't been basement-buried for long.
He bottles it up, storing it away in his cellar of shit he can't say.
Bernadette stares at her reflection in the dirty crowbar. "He's my husband."
No point hiding now, he slams down the lamp and the creature screeches, running for him. He falls in a tangle of wires near the outlet, cables catching his arms as he shoves them out of the way - he jams in the plug, swinging back around as blinding light fills the room.
For towns now, he'd been robbing joints so Sammy could eat, putting his ass on the line during hunts, pretending there would be praise at the end of it. He's been bugging his brother to join a club, so he wouldn't eat, work, sleep in the cold car and now Dad's going to blow their motel room money at the fucking
Sams' surprised by the vitriol in her voice. "Scarlet?"
His brother forces a laugh, pained and uncomfortable, red blood glinting as his throat works. He waits until John fades into the shadows before crouching down by Deans' side, using his sleeve to scrub the blood off his face.
A flash of silver arcs through the air, and she catches it with a flick of her hand. She stares at the keys in awe - it was something they'd talked about in passing, the perfect place to run operations from, though she never really thought it could happen. She'd been stepping up as Sams' second in command since the incident, but being told she was great was nowhere near as profound as the proof.
Moms' ring was their last real evidence that there'd been a life before all this, that maybe there would be after, and it never left Deans' torn knuckle.
With sudden concern, Cas leans over to Dean, whispering in a way he's never mastered, "Did you take that page out?" They share a slow look of panic, whipping their heads to the journal now nestled safely in her grasp.
Leading them inside across a muddy doormat, the wood creaks under their weight and moonlight glimpses through slatted walls. Anything that once made this place a home, was faded. Old towels in the kitchen, crackled vinyl chairs and string-bundled newspapers beside a typewriter. He scans a few lines of the paper loaded in, fingers pressing one of the tempting keys - it snaps down, startling in the silence. "Please, don't touch that." Bernadette Tarn asks.
in that car, so he could keep his promise to Sam.
Maybe for once, he got help not based in pity.
So when he sees Dean in the dark parking lot, he can't help his own hope. Then he sees the slouch, the defeat in his eyes and twists away, balling his fist to his head. Now?
It's just him and his brother in the motel room. Dean cleans his gun on the same tick-torn table that he serves up dinner, the same place Sam spends time answering senseless questions.
Metal lingers on his tongue like lightning, a furious blinding blue-white crackling around the warding tattoo on his shoulder, it's lines broken by the bite. Whatever was in the sigil makes the creature rear back, mouth misting around the edges, sloughing skin fragments to the floor.
"It's just, my last names’ Winchester."
Close but no cigar. He can hear his brother struggling with his lighter, so a fire related monster doesn't seem likely. He sighs over the article boasting another loss.
"Shame about the scorches it's uh, nice place you got here." Dean offers, hands clenched in his pockets. "Safe." He taps the extinguisher perched on the counter.
"We understand that you experienced the same devastating fires as the other families, except that this house somehow survived." Sam starts off, holding his reporters notepad.
"Just sneak out - or take one of these costumes." John gestures to the hanging racks around them. "Dean won't mind wearing the fairy one will he?"
Sliding against the wall, the waiting shadows breathe fouly on his face, impatient for him to make a mistake. Too bad for them, that he can’t fucking afford another. The world shifts, the moonlight elongating the shadows until they wrap over Dean’s legs.
In his outstretched hand, is a leather journal emblazoned with the Men of Letters mark, but the stitched corner claims its' owner to be
"Oh Sammy, you sly dog!" His brother laughs where he lays in the backseat, breath fogging in the cold car. He leans over, knees knocking into the wheel to shove him in embarrassment. "Breaking hearts all around town, is that it?"
Oasis, Arizona, here they come.
Dad grunts in consideration. "That plan will work if everyone stays in the hall. If one person leaves, it could possess their body and move out of the shadows.” And then it’d head straight for the people controlling the lights, Sammy.
"Look, hey. The interval's probably over by now, so no slacking. Otherwise that goth girl might have her own machete." Deans' split lip quirks up and so does Sams'.
"He do the same work as you?" Gunner asks cautiously, losing his air in a huff when he nods. "Christ. At least we're in good hands." He looks to the burn marks on their wall, shaking his head. "I'm just glad my sisters moved out when they did, unless the fire goes to them next."
these stories will focus on dean, sam, cas and eileen as the main characters and build on their relationships/arcs. for me, this story is closure on certain things, which may not be the closure you're looking for! i respect that :)
"A little." He admits, flicking ash away. "I want to believe it's all over, being a soldier in that tools' toybox." His nose twitches on the exhale of smoke, losing Cas briefly as it blows over the screen. "I want this hunt to prove that."
"What do you think?" Cas asks.
His brother looks warily between them before he slides out, slamming the door. Silence makes him twist his ring over his knuckle, only comforted by Sam kicking pebbles.
If they had issues, they'd have to raise it with someone else because Dean sure as shit wasn't going to stop this. Blue-white shines through the fabric of shirt, skin hissing and spitting where the glory of grace commands it back together.
"Thank you." She whispers, shell-shocked.
"Samuel! Are you listening?"
"Have we worked a case in Oasis before?"
He'd cleaned up, Dads' call was surely over - but Dean was going to make him
In terms of the case, Gunner was a dead end.
, goes unsaid. "I mean, his grace is mostly gone so we're still figuring out what that makes him. We're still targets."
He picks up his shirt, fabric sticking uncomfortably to his blood-slick side. The needle bites, a numbed sensation of tugging skin with each stitch. From the car he keeps an eye on the sisters, but they're kicking this things' ass now that it was trapped.
"Aldana?" He calls her name gently, then again more firmly when she moans in distress. Her lower half trapped under a fallen shelf, hands limp over the metal as if she'd forgotten how to push. "Aldana, hey, can you hear me?" Consistently he draws her attention, hefting up the heavy shelf with a grunt. She sucks in air once the weight is gone and he shoves it away, clattering into some mirrors. Crouching by her side, he winces at the blood and bruising, tearing off a strip of his sleeve to wrap around the worst wounds.
Aldana struggles over, wrapping her hands around her sisters'. A silent strength builds between them and together they raise the crowbar, crashing it down onto the monster who shatters into mirrored pieces under their force.
be here - and wasn't.
Quickly twisting around the corner, his blade bears down - meeting another machete with a clash and a grunt.
“Should I do anything?” Sam asks, tensely, knowing he’d be the last line of defense for his friends if the monster snatched up the hunters.
Middle of day, middle of class, he's glad to have already done this module on the road - forty times over. He lends a pen to some guy, indifferent when it splinters under his shoe, asking for another. Answers filled early, he stares out the dusty windows until it's time to go back to Dean.
"Ha, what a gun-slinging pair we make then." He grins and it’s not a line, but it reels him in anyway. Taking in how Gunner leans with his beer, bicep pressing up against the thin varsity jacket sleeve.
"No!” He panics, fumbling a lie. “He trusted me when I asked -"
Not missing this chance to run, he jostles Aldana and sprints through the shelves. Her headwound must be clearing up because she gets her feet under herself, struggling not to slip as they race past piles of useless garbage - he skids a little, his flashlight catching on a long beam of metal, fingers fumbling to drag it along with them. Who thought he'd be so glad to see a crowbar, he could almost kiss it. There's no time though as they bump against the steps, Dean pushing at Aldanas' arms to get her ahead and closer to the door.
He blindly backs up, hitting something and spinning so it doesn't crash to the floor and - oh, perfect. A long pole ending in a high lux lamp, he flicks out the legs and hears the hissing go quiet. It knows he's here.
Every reflective surface, windows, glasses, metal pipes, the same stare. Empty of anything but hunger, frustration. It stalked their movements, waiting behind a thin barrier to attack, withheld only by sheer luck that they'd used fake identities.
He flicks around - nothing in the seat behind them, no ghostly chill.
"How do you think I left?" His indulgent smile grows as Dean roars in laughter, slapping his leg for his phone.
Creeping inside the stage storage room, he hides behind racks of costumes and uses boxes as walls, waiting crouched until he can peer his head out of cover. He frowns, confused to see Dean shuffling around, stumbling, leering forwards unnaturally.
"Not anything like that, gross!" He smiles, telling his brother all about Scarlets' animation over her clubs, slowing down when mentioning theatre. Thing is, her excitement had stirred bittersweet memories and he falls silent, picking at his fingers.
." His knuckles sting, crashing them into metal.
"I need some help changing the bulbs." Bernadette continues, pointing up to the jagged glass remains surrounding a wire in the ceiling. "They burst a couple of nights ago." She shows her palms, small red welts where she'd grabbed the broken glass. "I have some spares down in the cellar - the doors' just to the side of the house."
Haunting eyes stare back, filling the entire frame of the mirror.
Moonlight through windows makes mountainous shadows out of the lockers, a thin path of light to stalk the halls in, machete drawn. A door bangs. Dean crushes against the wall as he creeps to the corridors’ corner. A slow shuffle starts and he steps lightly, jacket barely brushing brick as he moves.
Cas' tilts his head to the sky, wind buffeting against his tan coat. "Homes."
"And now, you're not." Dean grunts, pinching at the weak flesh on his brother's wrist to win the phone. Leaving him to huff into his hair, he goes behind the truck stop to light up a smoke.

of lurking in it's pages." Smug as anything, he folds his arms. "Yeah, it used to be mine - until Sam started scrawling in it and then Cas, so it's a gift from all of us."
Something, something, ditching them again. "Clear." He slips back into his book but the letters look like scratch marks, sentences scored lines on paper.
"Man, just - take this and go wash up, I'll come get you after school." He slips a bar of soap into his hoodie pocket, ferocious heat flooding the car when he creaks open the dusty door.
Mirrors, so many mirrors.
he'll never see again - and he knows, even listing them out, he was still going to do one more thing.
dean does smoke and drink in this fic, as unhealthy coping mechanisms.
The phrase pulses in his mind, turning his thoughts to a case. A thin thread to follow but he clings to it, running low on patience and time.
A burst of light from the bathroom door opening jumps them apart, catching a skeletal monstrous hand wisp and disappear where it had been hovering behind Gunners’ back. Alright, he needs to stop panicking and get these people to safety.
"Lucky guess."
"Aldana!" She cries through fingers caging her mouth, unphased by the monsters' presence. "¿Te hizo daño?"
Sam tenses nearby, ready to help if the warding hadn't worked, but the creature doesn't move. It stares at Bernadette in the same eerie way it had them, trembling crowbar and her head bowed.
"Even if our hands were forced, there's still blood on them. So when revenge comes? It'll come for us."

do that to Sammy, not again. What he's about to do though, leaves him no other option. He exhales, rubbing his ring over his lip.
Lost in possibilities, his watch-digits flash close to midnight. A shadow falls across the dull orange light slanting from the bathroom and his gaze drifts over Cas leaning against the doorway.
"Structured, orderly, clean. A devout woman in 1901, had a wonderful home. I remember feeling ashamed to mar her finery." Blood splatters against petticoats, rips in bodices. "She felt my doubt, settling in and looking at her painted family portrait. I was stripped from her, returned to Heaven for conditioning."
Sam shakes the newspaper out, alarmed by the title. "Another one." He informs his brother, ditching the paper on the table strewn with research. It's been a week without any clear link between victims, and the local lore books were less than helpful. "It's picking up pace."
Had he forgotten the pitifully pained looks when Dean flirted with someone else? Shit, if he was in that situation he'd have lost it by now - while not quite telly novella levels of dramatic, his brother and Cas got close to it sometimes.
"I used up all my luck on you." Gunner laughs, shrugging into his varsity jacket again as Dean pulls on his own, flipping the collar up to hide his neck.
Because the monster was coming, here. And as much as he hates thinking it, Gunner knew the people better than he did. He’d have more luck keeping them in the hall.
Aldana is quiet, breathing heavily where she leans against his side, the unsteady air crystallizing with cold. He tenses, swinging the torch through the mist on mirrors, only seeing his own reflection -
"Kids. She had three kids, plural." He corrects idly.
Fire Lieutenant Dunnel was
Sams' eyebrows raise. "It stopped burning?"
Sam grins, coming to the same conclusion. Damn, it feels good to smile now that the case was wrapping up. He ignores the flash of tan, black and blue across his mind - still stuff to do before he could think of home.
"That's not even true-"
Dean doesn't dare think of controlled centuries, his hand twitching forwards for comfort. "Are you still squatting in Jimmys' suburban then?"
. Mm." He feels panted over his lips and grins hazily upwards, already wanting more.
like he'd been all around town, clothes dusty and ripped in places, but he'd found them some money - Sam had stolen from the kitchens, so their evening was filling with laughter and mostly satisfied stomachs.
"I'm gonna stop soon." Dean announces to a grunted agreement, pulling into the outer lane and preparing to turn off into a pit stop. Sams' phone breaks the lull of noise, sharp and soon quelled by him accepting the call.
"Will you come and see some of it?" He asks hopefully.
"Nah." Dean dismisses with a dry throat. "Not the same."
"That your guy?"
He blinks the tunnel lights from his vision, watching their wandering trail catch on Sams' smile. Not for the first time, he's proud of his little brother, thankful Eileen was the one guiding him out of the dark - dotting dates and dreams like lanterns.
A month and a bit after Dad bailed on them for his hunting group, it's the chilly evening of Sams' play, the darkening sky filled by flashing lights for final checks as the guests settle in.
"I would’ve told them to get back themselves, but my sister and cousin live with us - they're not exactly fun wine aunts." Gunner says regretfully and though he doesn't mean to, he latches onto that honesty while the rest of him begins building walls back up.
Gunner hums into his coffee and the world moves on, though he can breathe a little easier. The spiraling doubts turn slowly into indistinct patterns, fears with no fire. He opens the message from Sam and nods, looking up to meet a kind brown gaze.
"Theatre?"
"That's alright, I know the paper these guys are from." They stiffen in surprise, going with the curveball. "They need all the facts to do a good job. So, I'll tell them off the record - these fires had no accelerant and started in unusual places in the home, no electric cables or heat sources."
Avery bounds out and he sweeps Sam off the floor into an overwhelmingly proud hug. "Look at you! Hunter by day, play prodigy by night." He lets his embarrassed brother go. "Well done, fighter."
scored down the spine. It's thick with newspaper and notes, not falling apart but close, the brass clasp barely containing the contents.
He'd been here two months, maybe less and it'd been years.
"Oh, right." He drinks, drowning the dejection. It was a stupid thought anyway.
, he searches for a pen,
Holy shit.
"Her husband." Aldana croaks, heavy hands tentatively touching around her wounds. "Names… in a notepad. I thought finding one would help her." She's not making much sense, but she is speaking without coughing blood and that's good enough for him.
"No, sir."
That was way too close, like a car flashing across the interstate when he's driving forwards, a life altering moment and it missed by a breadth of hair, of time.
He shudders into the backseat, staring at the shadow of Dad as it silhouettes the streaking rain outside.
Sam peers into the kitchen to beckon her out, as if nobody else could see him. Seriously, those kids of his were making him live by their rules. She dodges past her pleasantly buzzed friends, sneaking out for her -
That was what Cas would've said before, unsure and needing guidance. Human adjacent now, all he does is run a hand over the bristles and hums. "It's a sign of aging." He muses softly, an ancient creature content with creaking human bones. "My vessels never got the chance to age."
Falling dust catches in the flashlight beam as it stutters on. Straining against the dark, he pieces together his surroundings - tall shelves stacked to the dripping ceiling, the log lined walls weeping with groundwater. There's a dragged trench through the mud on the floor - the width of a body.
"Woah, cold hands." Shocked, the words slip out as a defense for anyone stumbling across them. They probably knew by now that a gentle touch to the forehead would woosh away worrying injuries, that the way Cas covers the wounds on his side was a tad too intimate.
Listening to the deepest caverns inside himself, maybe he was missing him.
"Sammy," The leather crinkles as Dean leans earnestly over to catch his eyes, brows raised and resolute. "Join the frigging club, okay. You got the time for it," He lists off on his fingers. "You already got a little girlfriend over there, and you got the smarts."
"Sam! Where are you going, we're about to start!" Avery exclaims as he scrambles for the torch inside his backpack.
"It's a journal, smartass, and it's got creatures you've never even
His oversized jacket forgotten in the front seat, misted windows excused by the cold air, Gunner slides a hand up his side. He hushes encouraging noises as a strong build backs him down horizontally. He lets himself enjoy the weight keeping him pinned, knowing he's protected by the knives wedged under the front seat.
, c'mon, you know that!" Using his butterknife, he starts cutting the air in demonstration. "One over the chest for distraction and then-" A strong rapping of knuckles on their door has his brother switching to his sharper blade, only opening up an inch.
when John leaves with another hunter in the morning and tosses them a few singles, what brings him the most comfort is Deans' promise.
"Are you coming too?" He asks into a dead line meaning yes, he would be following the monsters here. He exhales sharply, flipping the phone closed and pressing a knuckle into the tension between his eyes. How the hell is he supposed to round up all the kids and parents - lips press against his jaw and he jerks, roughly shoving back the offender.
"Samuel's in the theatre club?" Dad questions with abject annoyance. Dean defensively licks his lips and adjusts his grip on the machete.
worse. "You're the new guy, aren't you?" Her stuffy voice crackles, tissues wiping away more mess, he nods. "If you can, avoid the girls at the back of the class." She sniffs, wiping her nose. "They're not as nice as they seem."
Cas smiled as he reached for it. “I wasn’t sure if you’d believe me, and I have no pictures of the two of us, so I texted Gabriel—” he opened a message before turning the phone to show Dean, obviously trying not to look at the photo too hard himself. “This was our sixteenth birthday.”
Cas looks between Jack and the Creature. “We’ll take it back with us. Once it knows it’s safe, it’ll warm up to you.”
), and Sam knows this. Dean stares at his brother, incredulous, until he breaks. “What.”
And then it was just him and Charlie, who sighed. “Alright, I’m tapping out.”
Sam raises an eyebrow. “Like a bear?”
“Showtime,” he mumbled, not bothering to look at Charlie as he stood. He didn’t need her disapproval messing up his game.
“You’re telling me that you have a secret,
By the time the other four come back they’ve made a small army of snowmen and there’s hot chocolate on the stove.

“This is a terrible idea,” Charlie said, looking over her laptop at him. “For the record.”
Dean sighed, and nodded again, this time saying something. “Okay.” Cas visibly relaxed, and Dean took this as permission to wrap his arms back around his boyfriend’s waist, pulling him closer. “Okay. I’ll let it go.
“Likewise,” Dean replied, and then she left.
“I know, I’m sorry. I just think—” Cas cut him off, harshly. “Let it

Dean paused. “Um. I don’t know. You did that part.”
But Castiel just sighed and picked up the phone, zooming in for closer inspection. Dean stared at him, closely, as the expression on his face shifted from confusion, to recognition, to something like…grief?

“Yeah, my brother Castiel.” He rolled his eyes at the expression on her face. “Come on, Amelia, I told you I have brothers I don’t talk to.” As if that made it all better.
“It just…you’re obviously sad about it.” It was a weak attempt at an explanation, and they both knew it. Dean shifted, not meeting Cas’ eyes. “I just keep thinking about if it was me and Sam not talking, I guess. And it sucks.”
She shrugs. “Just, you know. Not killing something, for once.”
, this is your fault in the first place.”
were going to change that.
"Could still be a bear," Sam grumbles, with the air of a man who knows he's lost. Dean chucks his empty cocoa cup into a nearby trash can.
He’s about to hang up, but Claire protests on the other end and he reluctantly raises the phone to his ear again. “Burning daylight, Claire.”
“Castiel.”
He is
. “Dean, wha—” he began, but Dean cut him off with a snap. “Don’t play dumb, Cas. You know what you did.” His boyfriend blinked, and then frowned, concern replaced with deep confusion, tinged with a fear that almost made Dean feel guilty.
Finally, he looked up to meet Dean’s eyes, and he saw plenty of sadness there, but no guilt. Something inside Dean ached. Did he care so little that he didn’t even feel

Dean flushed and pulled back. “I

Cas stands up, smiling, and then Dean is looking at his boyfriend, former-angel-of-the-Lord Castiel, holding hands with a Himalayan cryptid.
“They bonded,” Cas explains, as if Jack being buddies with the Yeti was the weirdest thing about this situation.
Easy. Quick and clean. They should do animal rescues more often.
The next morning Dean is ready for Sam in the kitchen, armed with eggs and toast and Twitter. He waits until Sam accepts breakfast before launching into it. “We gotta go to Aspen.”

Unfortunately, that wasn’t the end of Castiel’s sentence. “I love you, and I know it’s because you care. But I don’t need you to fix this. I don’t
Cas excuses himself and slips from his place at Dean’s side out onto the porch.
“You’re on the right,” Dean said, instead of any of the other things he could have, and when he looked up, Cas was gaping at him. “Yes,” he replied simply. “Yes, I am. But, Dean, nobody has ever been…”

It’s over nine hours to Aspen, but they’ve done worse in one go. Dean automatically loses the fight for the music when Cas says he actually
Cas sighs. “I spent some time in the Himalayas a few centuries ago. I know those prints.”
Cas hums. “Knowing I won’t be alive to watch them erode, or to watch more form…” he pauses. “They feel more permanent.” He turns to Dean, smiling. “Thank you for risking archive duty to come out here.”
Dean, who is knee-deep in Himalayan folklore, sighs without looking up from his laptop. “That’s the million-dollar question, buddy.”
“What are we walking into?”
Dean glowered.
Dean stares at him. “You mean—the Yeti thing was a

and calls it 'a break?' Knowing Cas, it's probably just some dumb misunderstanding that blew up." Dean paused, then smiled, an idea forming. He leaned forward, conspiratorial. “So. They don’t talk, they’re both sad about it. We’ve got three months left of senior year. What’s a better grad present than a family reunion?” he grinned.
it.” She sighs. “And I probably shouldn’t be surprised by anything, at this point. Okay,” she nods. “I’ll get you deets in an hour or two.”
The rest of them share an uneasy glance. Eileen is the first to shrug and start after him, but Dean passes her as he shrugs to catch up. “Cas—hold up.”
“If they’d tried to take a baby in front of it’s mother, they wouldn’t have gotten out alive,” Cas points out, and Dean shrugs.
In the photo they were both laughing, happy, looking towards the camera but completely at ease in each other’s company. Dean wanted to ask what had happened, but Cas had made it very clear he didn’t want to talk about it so Dean shoved that question down for later, too. Instead, he scanned their faces, looking for any differences. The two boys in the picture were remarkably identical, even for identical twins, but there was something different about one of them; how he held the photographer’s gaze, piercing and steady, even through the smile and the happiness in his eyes.
“Thank you,” he says, and it’s not just about the coffee.
He recounts the whole scene to Cas later, when they’re changing for bed—because complaining while getting ready for bed is a thing they do, now—and Cas just hums placatingly as they climb under the comforter. He thinks that’s the end of it until, when he’s almost asleep, he feels a puff of air at the back of his neck as Cas sighs. “It
“To everything. And all time. All at once.” He furrows his brow. “At first, it was overwhelming, but now…” he looks around at their small circle and smiles. “Now I understand.”
laughing by the time Jack returns from the Himalayas (where the Yeti were safely reunited with their family), it’s a sign they all need to head to sleep.
They load up the car and take off just after 10—Cas is in the passenger seat, leaning grumpily into Dean’s side and nursing a full thermos of coffee, relegating Sam to the back. They swing by Eileen’s and all traces of Sam pouting about seating arrangements disappear when she climbs in next to him and greets him with a kiss. Dean watches them in the rearview and smiles, and Cas squeezes his hand across the bench seat.
that meant he was trying to figure him out, and now Dean regretted it even more. “Why is this so important to you?” he asked, and Dean shrugged.
He doesn’t say any of that, but somewhere along the line, Sam’s expression has shifted from confusion into something softer. He takes a deep breath before speaking. “Okay.”
Dean calls Claire.
Dean takes the hint.
, but she could support him. And move on. But couldn’t he have told her, and saved her the pain? She knew he had a complicated history with religion—was
just an elaborate ruse.
Cas moved back a bit, consternation written across his face, and he fixed Dean with a look that said he knew something was deeply wrong, but he had no idea
He smiled, but it was thin. “Yeah, of course. I just—” he gestured with his phone. “It’s good to see him happy, you know? It’s been a while.” He swallowed, thickly, and that sad look was back, and Amelia made a decision.
Dean only notices the others have caught up when Sam cuts in. “Woah, what about the abominable snowman?”
“Dean,” Cas began, yanking Dean out of his thoughts again. “I would appreciate it if you didn't bring up my family while I'm
Dean frowns at the non-sequitur. “What?”
Dean turned slowly, disguising it as a stretch, to watch Amelia Everett walk across the café to order her usual. Right on time. As predicted, through—as much as Dean hated to admit it—stalking.
Dean sighed, as the last bit of doubt faded away. It
unbelievable, but a lot of things about Cas and his life were. And, honestly, so were a lot of things about Dean’s. He opened his mouth to—what, tell his boyfriend he believed him? Apologize for his anger?—but Castiel’s phone buzzed before he could say anything.
Sure, Cas didn’t want to talk about it—but what if he didn’t have to? What if there was someone else who could?
Maybe their stalking
“You could’ve just confronted them,” Dean grumbled, almost petulant. Charlie sighed. “I was late to class. Besides, I don’t

Jack apologizes for not visiting sooner—he needed to make sure Heaven was stable first, but he happily reports that upstairs is secure enough to leave for a few days. “How do you feel?” Cas asks, and Jack shrugs. “I feel like me. Just more…connected.”
“—but there’s a monster over there. I’ve seen it.”
“Hey,” Dean started, softly. They hadn’t said the words yet, but they were there, he knew. He’d put money on Cas knowing it, too. But even if he
A split second later, before he could really even process it, he was pulling Cas across the table to kiss him, and nothing else mattered.
Cas blinks at him, then nods. He turns back towards Jack, who visibly relaxes a bit, and nods again. “You’re right. All of you.” He crosses his arms. “We need to find that plane.”
“A plane?” Jack offers, and Cas shakes his head.

Claire stares at him. “You are
I don’t want to talk about it. I know you have this intrinsic need to save everyone around you,” at this point he had uncrossed his arms and was gesturing angrily, while Dean kept his gaze trained to a single knot in the wood floor, “but you don’t have to save me here. You

“—Guys?” Eileen cuts him off, and they all turn to follow her pointed finger, just in time to see a small figure duck back behind a tree.
“Yeah, it’s good to see you too. Now open up,” he knocks on one of the back windows. “We’re staking out with you.”
“It’s
“I wish I knew. I just told it I’d get it home.”
“I get it,” Sam cuts him off with a huff, then pauses and sighs again. “Look, if you’re really that stir-crazy, call Jody. I think Claire and Kaia are tracking a vamp nest through Nebraska.”
There’s an awkward silence.
