“What did you mean?” Castiel asked when they settled for a break. At Dean’s confused look he continued, “You called this game…sick, what did you mean?”
Feathery D*cks.
Whilst Maddison and Jo where quietly talking Dean felt himself drawn to District 1s tributes. Meg Masters and Castiel Novak.
Not before offering Spider-Man a deal to sell his soul In order to pass his final year exams.
The younger man blushed deeper as he got in, jumping when he felt Castiel put his hand around his waist, legs tucked against the back of his knees and head resting at the crook of his neck, Castiel’s strong, lean chest against Dean’s back and Dean felt himself falling asleep with the even beats of Castiel’s heart
So yeah, a night after sweet love making, Bucky expected a late morning with breakfast in bed, which usually happens because after his boyfriend comes back with Wilson from their God awful early morning run, Steve wakes him up by whispering beautiful things in his ears.
"Where are you, Dean?" a raspy, dominating voice asked.  Steve smirked slightly. He knew that tone, he used that tone on Bucky in the bedroom.
“Oh yes, once we find Winchester, I’ll be the one to kill him but first I want to ravish him.”
"Uhm... Yeah, I think we done, FRIDAY, get some pie for Mr Winchester."
“Is that why you killed him?”
“What do you mean you have no plan?!” Sam exclaimed ad he followed Dean to his huge ass room.
He was handcuffed to the chair. Body relaxed.
Sam and Cas were in the Bunker. They were still figuring out how to get rid of the Mark of Cain.
Sam his hands. Once again the Capitol was turning something blossoming into a Game.
Dean was setting up everything has he spoke. Castiel was surprised at how unaffected Dean was in the biting coldness of the cave.
"If you give me time, I can maybe ask someone for help." Dean said. Although he made a disgusted face. As if the person who would help him was actually going to be the last person he would want to go to.
"Take care of yourself Sammy." Dean Winchester said in his big brother voice as he pulled his tall yet younger brother into a hug.
If Winchester was suprised by a talking Racoon he was good at hiding it.
“Are you going to kill me?” Castiel wondered.
“It seems as if our boy on fire and our golden hero from District 1 are getting cosy, an unusual scene am I right? Could it be that a love could blossom from this Hunger Games, if so, it’s gonna be the best show yet.”
Albeit, reluctantly and after 2 bottles of Capitol Liquor.
Dean wasn’t stupid. He knew that what he was about to do would make others perceive him as weak because he was helping another Tribute.
Also, regarding Dean's sexuality (if Dean's Bisexuality was  actually Canon) I had a feeling John wouldn't mind because there's worst things out there then him kissing boys
He ignored her. He couldn’t get attached. For Sammy, but damn all his paternal instincts screamed at him to hug Jessica and save her from the horrors of the Capitol.
Upon arriving the team were attacked by humans who were not affected by any of the Abilties of the Team.
Dean was no virgin to anal sex. He had multiple male one night stands when Dad left him on his own to hunt after Sammy left.  But he never had to face aftermaths because the guys he slept with were always average in size. Not small to be embarrassed but not too big like a porn star.
As it went on, people got below 10 but above 8.
“I’m not scared for me,” Sam said quietly, “I’m scared for you.”
“You wanna know how to throw a knife?” he asked softly.
"I'm sorry, ain't this a violation to my rights?"
“Aw, look at that, love birds, you know Winchester, under different circumstances, it would probably be you against my chest, me railing you from behind.”
Movement caught his eye and when he looked ahead he saw Castiel Novak on his balcony. The two of them met eyes. Each one not looking away.
After everyone, including Dean, got over the shock and fact that Dean slept with the almighty Thor, (seriously, pinning over an Angel and sleeping with damn
“We’ve dealt with Thanos, I’m sure we can handle a bunch of monsters.” Quill pointed out.
Castiel growled and tried to attack Allister but the man was brutally strong.
Dean blinked as he tried to process the long name.
The three guest made their way downstairs towards the room where they would be meeting up with the team.
Fury saw some look curious.
"Thank you for coming, this is a very important meeting as it is to discuss what happened yesterday when some of the Avengers went on a mission." Maria greeted.
"So the dudes Buffy, big deal, why are we here?"
Enjoy ❤️❤️❤️❤️😉
Also, I am going through some issues that I need time to sort through.
Somewhere on the ruins of the forgotten a forgotten District, a spark was finally ignited.
"Wait,youre telling me that
They were preparing for the parade of the tributes. The rally where all the tributes dress up to earn attention and sponsors or like how Dean dubbed it…whoring yourself out to the Capitol.
But motivation is a key and I just don't have the motivation to complete this book now.
“D-Dean…”Jo gasped
"Well, Squirrel and I did share a bond for a while, ain't that right darling?"
“Holy Shit!” he exclaimed as he saw two exhausted girls.
Sam was holding his breath as he watched his brother trek into the woods. He smiled fondly when he saw Dean steal the careers weapons. He felt disgusted by Allister.
Hell hounds!
He rolled his eyes and cleared his throat.
“FRIDAY what’s going on? And if it’s dangerous please evacuate civilians and children including Pepper and Morgan.”
It was easy. Michael and Gordon fell for the trap as soon as they saw the smoke. Dean prayed to all the different God’s above that neither Lucifer or Allister see the fire as well.
Jo went up next. She poke about her mum and her friends from District 12, she played the innocent girl naïve to the horrors of the world.
He stared at the shocked audience with amusement in his eyes before bowing mockingly.
“White stands for peace and purity, it reminds me of the peace I have managed to hold through our my years as President.”
"Yes but we not sure, we could ask a source of ours but...he's not exactly, friendly."
Castiel put his hand on Dean’s cheek which was starting to form a stubble.
Kudos and comment. It motivates me.
Quill did not like the way Thor said Captain. It felt like he was mocking his position.
"What did you ask for? And how come you had a year?" Barns grunted. Winchester looked grimm. "My brother was killed, I asked to bring him back, little did I know that the it was all pre prophacised, but that's not the point of this, you don't need to know how the apocalypse was started yet,"
Dean.
The golden eyes glared in jealousy and anger as his consort received pleasure from someone who wasn’t him.
"So, me being...here...was pre planned?" Winchester -
When they trekked the Arena the next morning, they came across the campsite for Michael and Gordon.
They stare at each other, even has the carriages pull them away.
Thor made a mentle note to inform Valkrye to be prepared to fight in another war.
“C’mon, son…you got this.” He heard his father murmur. Unfortunately, Sam didn’t see what happened next cause the camera switched to the other Tributes.
“Dean accidentally asked me to marry him, I believe humans say things when they are still half asleep, after Dean explained to me I created a ring which Sam mentioned was a promise ring, I gave that too Dean.” Castiel looked proud after his little declaration.
He watched as Winchester handed the blonde a knife, leaning down to her height he gently spoke to her a few instructions.
“Killing a defenceless person… It’s not in my nature, my dad thought me to ask first shoot later.”
"And by someone you mean your brother and this Cas person?" The Raccoon asked.
Winchester sounded like he was in tears. Though he had an edge in his voice.
Castiel was stunned, but held onto the berries Dean put into his hands.
“Holy shit, Winchester was here all along.” Lucifer commented.
"Hell." came the same answer.
Sam smiled, tears forming, his brother was the only approval he needed right now.
“Shit!” Dean growled as he dodged another Hell hound. That was two already. They usually hunted in packs.
Another video popped into the hologram, it was one of the Districts, 11 judging by the clothes, they were protesting.
"Okay fine, to understand what you're dealing with, you need to know one of the greatest love story of Hell, When Lucifer was cast down in hell, he created the Knights of Hell, but he also created the commander of Knights, Druid, who ruled besides Cain as first Commander.
Even though Castiel pulled away, watching Dean’s heavy pants with lustful eyes, it still felt like a intimate moment being interrupted.
Steve narrowed his eyes. Winchester said it so casually. A challenge in his voice.
“I believe you volunteered for your younger brother, Samuel… Am I right?”
All errors are on me.
“That leaves only…” Castiel started,
And Dean sobbed loudly as he pulled out the knife and cried even louder when he stabbed Johanna Harvelle in the heart.
Benny brought in a leather suit. (A/n: Hawkeyes (Avengers) outfit in black.) When Dean put it on he noticed that it brought out his muscular built and feminine features. Not that he was proud of it but Rowena did say that it would make the Capitol fawn over him.
Instead of getting angry like Dean expected, Allister laughed instead. “Oh Dean-o… We’re gonna have so much fun.”
Castiel raised his hunting knife and Dean strung his bow, facing Allister.
, Dean must have really done something good in his past life) they went back to the matter at hand. Crowley, much to Dean’s annoyance, agreed to help them fight.
Michael and Gordon were camping at the cornucopia, they were talking strategy. Mostly about taking down Lucifer and Allister.
"Dean Winchester." Fury said finally.
See, all Dean wanted was some coffee. He didn't expect to be kidnapped because even with hunter instincts, he somehow was not prepared to see Iron Man's gloved hand in front of him sending some sort of knock out gas.
It was the day of the interviews. Their last night before going into the Arena and Dean did not sleep peacefully.
Walking away to protect your family was harder.
He was used to this.
And Thor always talked wierdly with names. Like how Tony was son of Stark. It made it seem as if he was House Stark from Game of Thrones.
Castiel stared in horror. He couldn’t believe what he saw.
Lucifer scoffed. “It was Gordon’s turn on night watch but it seemed he got distracted, resulting in our weapons and water supply to disappear… We are now down to 6 knifes, 1 set if arrows and an axe.”
No one ever got that high. Rowena cheered but Bobby looked grim and Dean knew why, he was now a threat.
See, there are also different ranks of demons , Crossroad Demons, they are the ones you go to when you want to 'make a deal with the devil', you can ask for anything you want and in return you sell your soul away, literally, which will be collected after 10 years, it was how I landed in hell, however the deamon only gave me a year."
So last night, he must have hit a jackpot. (of cause, Cas was his main jackpot).
, thought Fury.
“You’re saying I’m a caterpillar?”
So Winchester was here. It was an unspoken agreement to take down Winchester first as he had an impressive score of 12. The highest so far.
“Good morning, Dean.” Castiel greeted. Looking down at Dean in a fondness that Dean felt he didn’t deserve.
And Fury must have sensed it cause, "Team meeting tomorrow at 8:00, don't be late, we need to discuss something important, I want everyone here including those who are doing mundane stuff." and then he dramatically walked out. Leather coat flaring even though they was no wind.
But the war never really is over right? And from the hard and tired look in Dean Winchesters eye, tells Bucky that even he is tired of fighting.
They were killed brutally.
"So, now that your knowledge of Demon lore is done, let's get to the matter at hand, the message you received was obviously mentioned about a higher power, even more powerful then a Prince of Hell, it can't be Lucifer because he's in a cage trapped for eternity with Michael the Arc Angel,"
"Oh come now darling, don't give me that look, they truly care for you...the problem with you lad, is that no one hates you more then yourself and you need to forgive yourself."
: The encounterd species are unknown and seem to be a possible threat to humans.
Okay, so no one was expecting this. Everyone watched with their Jaws dropped as the guy in the trench coat, ‘Cas’, push Dean against the wall. Pinning him there with his body.
Dean felt her take his hand and move towards the knife in her stomach. She smiled at him. Through pain.
"Um, well..." Winchester started awkwardly, "What you guys encounterd were certainly demons."
So he was confused when he was still alive and felt warmth.
Castiel Novak. He had the usual luxury look. A suit with a light brown trenchcoat an arrogant smile and ice blue eyes filled with pride. There something intriguing about him though. He had this aura. As if all the glamour was just a disguise.
“Just do it!” Ruby hissed, but Dean couldn’t.
Shuri managed to remove the soul stone from Vision before Thanos could take over Wakanda. Which resulted in him being more human then synthezoid.
The truth is though, I lost motivation to write this book. It doesn't mean it won't be completed, I will come back to this book when I get the motivation again.
He mumbled an apology before grabbing a cup of water.
She came out looking pissed but was taken away by the House Peacekeepers.
“Ah, Mr. Winchester.” The man smiled. It was warm and charming but his Hazel eyes were cold and calculating.
"Fury kept a file on you... You knew that?"
“I mean that I'm just taking this as it goes, as off two days ago I was happily eating my pie before Iron Boy and Captain Wonders decided to kidnap me, so sorry Sam, for not having a plan on how to stop a psychotic Knight of Hell who wants me to be his corpse bride and have babies with me while planning world domination.” Dean snarked back.
There was more cursing and arguing for the dagger.
"It won't be forever Dean, Cas and I... We'll... We'll give you some time for yourself, but we will come find you after we feel you had enough space, and we will bring you back home... I...Dean I-"
There was talk about Leviathins. Creatures that came from mid world Purgatory. Where Winchester and the angel Castiel git dragged into after killing the head Leviathin.
“Um… I guess I raised him ever since my mum died in a fire… My dad was busy in the Mines so he could try and provide food for us, as you know District 12 is one of the poorer Districts and I highly doubt anyone in the Capitol even cares for us.” He laughed in the end, shrugging it as a joke, Earning forced chuckles, because everyone knows it was a dig.
"Who are you? How the hell did you get on here?" Stark demanded as everyone eased back to their positions at Winchesters go ahead, although they were more alert.
“Everyone’s new favourite, Dean Winchester with a score of…” he trailed off with a shocked cough. Even Roman looked stunned.
And Bucky couldn’t blame him. He heard was Winchester went through. Bucky respected the man.
"We just need your help on this, Rocket, please." Stevie, ever the patriotic leader, begged.
“Johanna Harvelle with a score of 8.”
Dean awoke to a knock on his door. Finding Bobby on the other side he invited him in.
“That’s going to get you killed, and it’ll be a shitty death.” Castiel observed.
It was a huge wolf dog, only it looked odd… Like an experiment gone wrong. His mind drifted towards one of his dad’s old history and lore books. The same exact creature was attacking him.
"Dean..." 'Cas' voice sound so understanding and broken, Steve saw Tony steal his expression.
"Demons possesses a host, which is why they appeared to be humans when they attacked you, unlike Angels, Yes, Me Stark, Angels exist, they are douchbags if you must know, Angels need permission to possess a host, Demons just force themselves into you, they usually come in the form of black smoke smoke, it depends on the rank and you can be prevented by being possessed by having an Anti possession tattoo."
“Cas…”
Sure it was a brave thing to do but District 12 was nothing. When his mentors, Uriel and Naomi, gave them the analysis he found himself captured by the beautiful man in District 12. The man with forest green eyes holding so much yet nothing, long eyelashes and pink plum lips. Freckles scattered like stars on his face and Castiel was curious as to weather he was littered in Freckles.
He didn’t cry when his father hugged him. Warmth and love combined. The first time he showed affection ever since Mary died in the fire. He didn’t cry when his father said he was proud of him and to remember what he thought him about Hunting. Dean wouldn’t ever forget hunting. It was in his blood. He was the best Hunter in District 12.
. Vision is alive because Shuri managed to complete an algorithm that got the stone out of Vision.
Again, Steve wouldn't have believed him if it wasn't for the device.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel greeted.
“Ready Clearance?” His companion, Meg Masters, flirted. Castiel just nodded. He had to put his game face on. He must not show weakness. It will only destroy him, just like it destroyed Jimmy. Pulling out his arrogant smirk he held Megs hand as they were pulled towards the light.
"Wait there was an apocalypse?" Stark asked, looking even more intrigued. Winchester sighed. "Yes, but I don't want to get into it, it's not the point I'm making." Winchester sounded off. Almost distant.
“Guys… Look.” He pointed. They all saw a note like paper, pinned on the tree with what seemed like a sharpened piece of branch.
"We not sure about Demons, but yes monsters like werewolves and vampires exist, among other things."
Like hell was he going to allow some freaks harm his family.
Winchester tensed. Seemingly at war within himself before sighing defeatedly.
“I’m sure your little brother loves to read and teach the children of your District? I wonder how he’d teach without a tongue, and your father…he works the mine right…it would be tragic of the mine just collapsed one day.” Shurley said in mock sympathy.
Thank you guys for being paitant with me.
They ate in a comfortable silence.
"Sorry fellas, I'm Jon Smith, Sheriff of this town." Dean said and flashed his fake badge.
"I'm here, Dean." the voice was now soft and broken. Through the small Strak camera, Steve saw Winchester close his eyes.
"I'm saying, that this is it Sammy, you know, I... We... Have been fighting in and for this messed up miserable world for so long, we've been fighting the good fight and after almost killing you and hurting...hurting Cas... I don't want to do it anymore... I love you Sammy, so damn much, and... And I'm proud to be your big brother, okay... I'm proud of us."
"The mark managed to help me in our fight with Abbadon, the thing about the mark is that it feeds if fear and killing, it turns your soul demonic, giving you and urging you to kill even if you don't want to... After Abbadon, an Angel...well...ghe Scribe of God, Metatatron, stabbed me... Seeing as the Mark managed to make someone immoral, when I died... I became a Demon... A Knight of Hell."
Despite John been an hardass and Sam questioning his authority, Dean was glad to have them by his side.
He knew he had to respect Dean's decision to leave him alone but unfortunately Sam Winchester was having none of it.
“Two.” Dean’s eyes flash down to Castiel lips.
Jessica got a 8, Dean thanked the gods, Jessica at least had a surviving chance.
He knew Cas felt the same way for him. He heard Cas's confession when he assumed Dean was sleeping. But Dean, much as it broke his heart, pushed the angel away. Because he couldn't... He couldn't accept that Cas would  him.
He certainly left most of the Avengers speechless after his little confession of being to Hell and Purgatory, including Heavan.
He was rebellious, yet surrounded by baby parachutes.
"Well, you should have asked dme first, I am... After all your captain." Quill said with a loud voice. Trying to assert his domince. Thor just looked amused and Quill heard Rocket murmer, "Oh Boy, where we go again."
He put on the bandages and ointment in the respective places, packing it up once done. He pointedly ignored the curves and strong muscles on the now shirtless boy.
He grabbed a bow and arrow, quickly grabbing a backpack of supplies and twin knives. Relieved that the others were distracted fighting, Dean didn’t have to even shoot an arrow.
There was only 10 Tributes left and it was only Day 3.
He heard Jo cry out and went besides her.
Sponsors.
Turns out 13 survived the day: Himself, Castiel, Jo, Allister, Meg, Abaddon, Jessica, Gordon, Michael, Lucifer, Adam, Anna, Ruby and Cole.
Sam hugs Dean, grinning. If only those days could come back. The camera shifted from Dean and Castiel to the careers.
Seeing has the Orignal Cain is now dead, thanks for that Darling, and Dean holds the power, Druid has fallen into an obsessed love with Dean and would rule the broken world with Den besides him.
“Just Castiel.” The angel replies, shaking the hand.
Dean was at the front of table, the Avengers and Guardians seated on all sorts places.
And then the creep walked away. Dean shivers at the creeps hungry stare.
“That’s an odd way to live.” Castiel said slowly. Sitting up, wincing at the moment.
Finally it switched back to Dean and Sam gasped at the site.
When Sam heard the announcement he applauded Dean for thinking smartly. Two Victor’s.
"Okay, that's it, Raccoon, bring the device." Tony said.
. John knew about Dean's bisexuality and was okay with it.
“People are betting and cheering on innocent kids as they kill each other… murder each other…for what? Pleasure, fun? It’s sick that they find freaking kids killing each other fun, bloody vultures.”
Sam Winchester breathed in the last scent of his brother. His Idol. "Thank You, Dean."
Crowley cursed as he received the scroll. The whole system of Hell was now disrupted because Monsters were disappearing and Demons vanishing.
He proceeded to hunt for rabbit, after covering Castiel with his tarp. Fruit can only do so much. Castiel was still unconscious so he proceeded to shred and clean the rabbit before starting a small fire.
@Lennysgirl1
Last night was exhausted. After Steve, Tony and Vision came back from the steak out, Steve was feeling romantic. So they had a romantic dinner and then proceeded to have romantic love making in the bedroom. Steve had in him in so many position and made him orgasm so many times before both their super soldier serum was satisfied.
Everyone was stunned and sympathetic and Dean figured it was a good ploy.
Dean started muttering to himself as he went back to the place he was standing earlier on. Blush still evident. Ignoring the amused glances from the Avengers.
His brother was in the Games when Castiel was only 9. Everyone loved Jimmy Novak. Until he got too cocky in the Games. Started to challenge the Gamesmakers and Shurley himself. He died on a mysteriously appeared land mine. But no body was found or collected even thought they all saw Jimmy leap and avoided being turned into Capitol Mince.
“Okay, now that we know what we’re up against, we need to prepare.” Fury, and honestly where the Hell did he come from?
The Capitol was sick.
"I need a drink." That was Tony's cue.
“Dee…please…
“Touché.” Dean muttered. Castiel, who seemed to be in a deep fascination about something on Dean’s head asked, “When are we getting married Dean? Did you already pick a date?”
"Im afraid so, Squirrel." for the first time the King of Hell sounded sympathetic. Tony could understand. Dean literally had no control over this situation. It was like a violation to his body. As of he isn't controlling his destiny and shit.
He glared at the sky once he recovered.
“They will love you, brother.” Benny said with a secretive smile.
“On three.” He confirmed.
Castiel and Dean Winchester. The star crossed lovers of The Games. Managing to beat the Odds.
“Any advice before going up?” Dean asked lightly to Bobby.
“Morning, Cas.” He grumbled, looking at Castiel with hearts in his eyes has his angel reached behind him, without taking his eyes off Dean, and handed him a steaming cup of black coffee.
He, like Cain, was Lucifers only and closest ally. But Druid got greedy for power and fell in love with the power Cain held,
"So are we done here? Can you like, release me and actually tell me what you need me for? Also do you have any pie? I swear New York pies are so different."
That didn't work out though, and Dean almost forgot about the 37 million dollars in the 3rd, unknown trunk, of the Impala. Just below the weapons.
And the car was soon filled with broken sobs.
Castiel moaned and Dean would have carried him bridal if he wasn’t so heavy with muscles.
Everyone shifted through the uncomfortable staring that was taken place between Dean and the handsome man in the trenchcoat.
"You need to live Dean, for your brother, your life is important." Castiel gritted as he pinned Dean to the ground, holding the dagger against his own throat.
Dean clenched his fist in order to stop the tremors that wanted to come.
He heard Allister snort as well as a bit of shuffling. Glancing down he saw them setting camp.
Dean looked at him in disgust. “Sorry buddy but you not my type, now beat it.” He hissed.
"What do you mean biggest enemy?" Steve asked.
Great. Just what he needed.
Tony did a double take. "I'm sorry, did you say... Book series... On your lives?"
“Walk? I was-“
“Hell Hounds.” They stated at the same time and then ran straight forward.
Benny laughed. It was like whisky. “But what they don’t know is that even the simplest things can grow into something more amazing…like a caterpillar. “
"We need to protect, Dean, that's the most important mission." Thors voice boomed. Which startled almost everyone. Thor usually stayed quiet unless he had a plan.
"Yeah, Cas... I hear you." Winchesters voice was raspy.
: 36 Hoirs and 160 Seconds
Cain, who was incapable of feeling love after killing Abel, also had some sort of feelings towards Druid, they made the perfect Duo, killing and defeating their enemies, it was thanks to them Hell won their first Victory, I was lucky enough to watch them from the sidelines and I've never seen anything like it, but this isn't a happy story,
"I know Sammy... Me too."
After Dean left his rather proud message for the careers to see he started making his way towards North. He ate some fruit, drank some water and then trekked all the way towards the river.
As Winchester finished his last piece the phone rang, startling everyone. They heard Winchester sigh.
: Unknown
Castiel was in charge of the fire that would lure them out and Dean, because of his skill with a bow, was in charge of blowing it up.
Crowley leaned back against his throne. Closing his eyes in irritation and worry. Surprisingly it was worry for Squirrel.
Because loyalty like that is hard to come across on today's world.
Castiel and Allister were having it out on top.
“What? This is good Dean, we can both survive.”
"This is Dean Winchester, according to the government he is a sociopathic killer that is supposed to be dead, however, he is an old failed recruit in our files, Winchester is a Hunter, he hunts things like Vampires and Werewolves."
He backed away. And noticed that everyone was watching Winchester for some reason.
"That's not creepy at all." He heard Dean mutter and Phill gave an amused smile. This guy was worst then Stark.
“Um, sir?” a young man called, raising a arm.
“We need a calling, a signal that will help us find each other or warn when either of us is in trouble.” Dean stated once he out the last of leaves on the wood.
He turned back, only to realize it wasn’t a Boulder but Castiel Novak.
“Dean?...”
"He seemed to love pie." Steve mused as he watched Winchester eat the last bit.
Soon he was left alone with Benny.
After regaining his thoughts, Dean raised an eyebrow, he tried to silently ask:
Everyone cheered and clapped. Jo looked relieved.
Thank you for the comments and Kudos. Even though I don't reply to most comments unless it's to clarify information in this book, it still motivates me to write more.
“You act really well.” Shurley stated.
“Really? Because I thought people always hated dressing District 12.” Dean snarked. He felt a slight shiver and realised that he was still naked and as if sensing his discomfort Benny handed him a golden silk gown.
Dean studied the two pictures. Gordon was a well build, dark skinned man that had madness in his eyes, he seemed like a ruthless killer, so he was a threat to Dean, Jessica on the other hand was a pretty blonde 12 year old that held so much innocence, it was actually scary. An innocence he had managed to keep in Sam. Dean felt anger surge through him. She was only twelve for gods sake.
If Dean could give Kudos to the Capitol for one thing though, then it would be that they make pretty good pie.
Fury was expressionless although the small rinkle on his face expresses shock.
“No!” he exclaimed quickly.
The hounds seem to be getting closer. Dean and Castiel found themselves back at the cornucopia.
Dean spotted the two Mentors on top of the stage. A gruff looking man with a baseball cap on a wheelchair and a thin lady with a sparkly long black dress and bouncy red hair.
It was a fast and blurred fight for Dean. All he remembers was trying to hold onto the spoke on the building as to not fall down and become dog food.
Sam felt mixed emotions has he saw Dean cuddle with the boy from District 1. Castiel Novak.
It was only Wilson, Stark, Wanda, The Racoon from outer space, Fury, Maria and Steve.
Sam and Dean looked at the fallen angel in surprise.
Instead of answering, Castiel hugged Dean tighter. Burying his face into the soft blonde hair, “We’ll figure it out, Dean, I promise.”
“Meg Masters with a score of 9, not bad actually.”
It was then he acknowledged the bandages that was on him. Seeing Winchesters distant look he decided to not mention it.
He thought about Jo’s last words. He was going to honour it.
Dean Winchester stared at the dull and pale sky of the Victors Village at District 12. Castiel will be arriving shortly as he decides to stay at District 12 with Dean. Instead of 1.
He planted the thoughts in your one eyed leaders head to call Dean to consult the mission once he heard how guilt ridden the older Winchester was."
Steve saw a haunted look in Winchesters eyes. A look he usually when Bucky wakes from a nightmare.
“It was an honour to work with you, Brother.” Benny said with a tight smile. Dean hugged him. He needed the comfort.
Benny seemed to grin at that and Dean felt himself loosening up. Benny seemed like a great guy.
Having heard the crude words being said.
Just who exactly was Dean Winchester?
All. Mistakes and errors are on me. And I did make a few things up as it went with my Canon on this fic.
He has finally come to terms with his emotions towards the Angel but believed that Castiel will never love a monster and broken man like him so he kept quiet.
"Dean...Dean wait! Why... Why... Will... Will you keep in contact with us?" the youngest Winchester asked. God, he sounded like a child.
Dean entered his and Castiel shared office. There was President Shurley. Wearing a bright, snow white suit with a light pink tie, a white Rose in his hands.
Dean met Lee after the games. Castiel was asleep when Dean had a nightmare and because Dean did not want to disturb his boyfriend he walked on the outskirts of District 12, just a few feet away from the electrical fence.
Soon it was District 12s turn.
It was now nightfall, the fire was out and Dean ties rope around himself and the tree so he won’t fall down, the tarp wrapped around him and Dean counted 11 canons, and 11 faces appeared of those who were dead.
“So flattering love.”
President Shurley, however, didn’t feel the same. After the act of defiance from Dean Winchester, something in the air shifted.
Team A was soon approached by a man in a white suit and yellow eyes. According to the source, he was stronger then most of thses inhuman humans and seemed to be well respected.
"So what... You trynna say Monsters like Werewolves and Vampires are real? And what... Demons in a Biblical sense?" Wilson asked.
"Look Cas, I know my brother, guilt has always been his downfall, I'll be damn if I'm going to allow him to feel guilty for something he has no control over."
“And for the boys we have…Samuel Winchester.” Deans head shot up as he felt his brother squeezed his hand in shock and then let go.
“You know better then to sneak up on me, jackass.” Dean frowned with an eye roll.
Everyone settled. Vision and Wanda seemed to have brought in snacks with their freaky powers. Tony couldn't believe Vision was alive. Yet alone almost everything about was human expect for the intelligence (Ultron and Jarvis mixed), red skin and walking through walls, he had and could feel full human emotions.
"What you came across, we are suspecting, was Demons." Fury held up. A hand at the interruption. "Wait for me finish... You see there is other crtures in this world as we found out first hand, Aliens and Mad Titans but there also creatures that come from legends."
Enjoy guys.
“Winchester needs to die!” Lucifer growled, Castiel noticed a hint of fear in Lucifer voice. Unusual for the normally sadistic man.
He kept quiet and helped set up camp, ignoring Allister’s disgusting musings of what he wanted to do to Winchester when they catch him.
"Because, you have the device that allows a person to speak the truth, which we need, if what Winchester confirms be correct... Then we have a whole new war in our hands,a war with an enemy worse then Thanos." Cryptic Eye patch said.
They kept on moving. Stopping now and then for breaks. They never come across the remaining four. Just hiking around the Arena.
And Dammit, Sam looked like a kicked puppy and brotherly instincts forced Dean to pull his brother down into a hug.
The Moose of a man besides the guy just rolled his eyes as of the suffocating Sexual Tension between the two males were normal.
Steve, unlike Tony, held in the surprise gasp of shock. The fact that Winchester was close to killing the brother he obviously loved deeply...
“Such beauty…young love.” Shurley just said with a secretive smile. He pulled a hologram phone, Dean and Castiel’s berry scene playing. Dean saw himself determined to give his life for Castiel.
"Why did you leave them and come to New York?" Fuey asked. As of reading Steves mind.
As he watched her eye the knife range. She nodded and then hesitated before reaching out to Dean. He gently pulled her to the range, aware of everyone looking at him, except for Castiel who was just finishing off. He grabbed a few knifes and waited for Castiel to finish.
Tony saw Clints face fall. Today was not his day with Arrows.
This was probably Sam Winchester.
When they got back to their house everyone was talking about District 12s outfit. They started dubbing Winchester as the Boy on Fire. And Castiel hated to admit it, but it suited him.
It was when the un natural natural disasters happened all over the world.
It certainly ain't The Angels unless they were planing another apocalypse with the Demons.
He was left alone in the dark dressing room. Two sweet and kind women who introduced themselves as Donna and Jody, made sure he was spotless and perfect, they cooed at his green eyes and left his golden, sand blond hair as it was.
Dean glanced at all the things he had received from his sponsors. There was healing medicine galore, a medical aid kit, a tap for drawing out natural water, a freaking book on some Mystery Maze with a bunch of boys who had amnesia, and… Pie?
Dean slammed a hand over Castiel’s mouth. Trying to bite down the blush and the more howls of amused laughter and scandalized look from Steve.
Dean found his river. He washed up himself. Taking out the blood and grime. He hid his naked self in the water. It was bad enough Sammy saw him kill, he did not need Sam to also see him naked.
Then he remembered Crowley warning him about their arrival and the anger dimmed. A little.
That was when he spent 40 years in hell. He was then brought back by an angel named Castiel. Steve remembered a 'Cas' in the phon call and wonderd if it was the angel.
Once he was done he took a seat, eyes drifting off to Castiel. He was at the knife range, flawlessly hitting the targets. He was so agile and graceful.
“I can’t believe you girls survived.” He said in amazement as he offered them the last piece.
Dean stepped in the room and now knew why Jo was so pissed. It seemed like his audience was board already and were now eating and talking.
The next day was training day. This was where they would meet with the other Tributes. See who they want to partner with. Dean didn’t want to partner with anyone. Even if he does, he will get too attached and then in the end, will find it difficult to kill them. So No, he will now be getting any allies. He’s here for Sam.
"You can also trap a demon by painting a Demon Trap, you know you're facing a demon and not another supernatural creature when you either smell sulpher, throw holy water on the hosts or say Christo, you cannot, however kill a demo,  you may exorsise it, which will send them straight to hell where they are banned form earth for a period of time, you can use the demons killing knife, which is in possession of my brother (thankfully) and the colt, a gun that kill any supernatural creature or demon except for Lucifer, trust me, we tried it,
“It’s not in my nature.” the man replied. Obviously seeing the confusion on Castiels face.
No one expected the ending but it was very satisfying.
It was a gentle of pressure of lips. Soft ones. As if testing this new territory.
Dean glared at him angrily. “You son of a Bitch.” He growled.
“D-Dean Winchester has a score of… 12.”
Fury heard Dean growl the name, looking murderous,
The only problem is that Steve's back by 8:15. And no matter what you tell Bucky, that 15 Minutes of sleep is everything.
"Ooo guys, can I go now, Hope just came up with a hypothesis on the Quantum Machine, if what she discovered is correct then we could be getting a huge barrier break." Scott said excited. Forgetting his leg was castrated and then hissed in pain.
The 2nd one howled. Maybe it didn’t like his buddy being dead or something because it howled once more and Dean spotted 3 more Hell hounds.
"As for Lucifer, well, he was apart of the apocalypse, which, like I said, we will not be going in to."
“So basically…just act like I am a fake who lived in the Capitol all my life?” Dean grumbled as he ate a piece of Apple pie. Bobby nodded in amusement and proudness.
Dean smirked. He was going to do something where Sammy would probably give him bitch face #4.
"Look, if you want the graphic stuff... You can check out the book series based on out lives."
They were in the huge office that held surveillance on him when he was first captured by SHIELD. Bucky recognized it when Zemo brainwashed him.
“I heard about those birds, but District 1 is full of sky scrapers so we hardly get any animals.” Castiel said sadly and Dean thought that maybe not all the Rich Districts were as good as everyone assumed it was.
Dean shrugged, “I’ll be fine, I always am.”
He saw the Avengers and Guardians nod in agreement. Dean tried not to think about how this would go so much faster if Sam and Castiel were here.
Dean snorted. “You really think that the Capital will allow that?” despite the obviousness in his voice there was a hint of hesitation. An insecurity. Like Dean desperately wanted to believe the announcement.
“What do you mean he got married?” Rocket asked, annoyed that he was interrupted from the super cool gun and discreetly eyeing Bucky's arm.
He didn’t care who Dean hooked up with or loved. Unlike Dean, he read his father’s diary to the end. He was surprised when he saw an entry regarding Dean’s sexuality.
Lee shrugged. “When does the tour leave?” he asked as they walked back with their prey.
"Nope, the King of Hell actually."
He didn't trust this mark. When they read the only copy file of Winchester there were a lot of blanks that needed filing.
“Just be careful guys.” Sam warned. Looking at Dean. “You’re going to be okay?”
"Holy Shit, I... I slept with... With Thor?!" Awe and shock laced in his voice. With a hint of disbelief.
“I wasn't aware –“
Obviously not Lucifer. He was confirmed to be in the cage where only Crowley can visit and has jurisdiction.
“NO!” Dean screamed as he lifted Jo. She still had a pulse. He saw another knife swing by and managed to pull Jessica, Jo and himself down just before it could hit them.
After cleaning up, Dean spoke, “I only have one sleeping bag and with your injuries you should take it, I’ll sleep on the tarp.”
Dean saw Sam almost drop his laptop through the blurry eyes he had when he choked on his coffee.
The area I'm living in was a war zone and it was tough to concentrate, yet alone write during the aftermath (as apart of the youth committee in my area we were busy with clean ups and shit.)
Dean held he hand up before anyone could question that information. Jesus Chris. Just how much did Winchester see and go through? Angels, Demons, Monsters.
“…below Lucifer’s cage, a huge explosion occurred, Sire, I think Knight Druid as escaped.”
"I believe so, Daughter of Thanos."
“Ugh, I just want a piece of that Winchester.” He heard Allister moan.
Before either male could say anything, a voice interrupted, “Attention Tributes, this year we decided to spice the game up, seeing as there is 6 of you, grouped into 2, President Shurley had decided that there will be 2 Victors this year, Thank you, this will be the only announcement.”
Dean dodged the attack from Ruby. The brunette from District 9.
"Dean... W-what... What are you saying?"
Winchester closed his eyes. He seemed to be counting in his head. Tony could relate, this guy seemed sketchy. He was, afterall, the King of Hell.
He guided Castiel towards the desk. A women, looking like she was done with life, glanced up.
Sam resisted the urge to roll his eyes. As if Dean’s life was any less important then Tony Stark.
“How’s your boyfriend?” Lee asked. Sneering. Dean rolled his eyes. For some reason his new friend and boyfriend despised each other. Always making quips at each other and bantering. Fighting for Dean’s attention.
Dean sighed.
Gabriel’s voice was soft as he explained Dean’s plan. Goading him on even though Dean couldn’t hear him.
Thank you for being patient with me 🤗🤗🤗
Tony looked confused. "As in, serial killer slash psychopath slash delusional domineering sociopath and now dead, Dean Winchester?"
He studied the sunset. It was beautiful. The water sparkling as it captures the sunrise.
Castiel never expected him to storm into his life. But Dean did, and now, he would do the right thing and allow Dean to live.
They stared at each other before Castiel saw shifting and glared at the young blonde girl who would probably be the first to die. Then squinted when he saw Winchester step in front. Shielding her.
"D-Dean...wait...what are you talking about?" there was confusion and denial in Sam Winchesters voice.
Bobby Singer has seen tough shit in his life. He was after all a Victor. Even though it caused him to be paralysed leg down. So when he saw the Kid, Dean Winchester, actually take down 2 Peacekeepers and avoid another just to volunteer for his little brother he didn’t know weather it was brave or plain stupid.
“Do you know what happened after you pointed out the berries were poisonous?” Shurley asked naturally.
“I think I’m falling for you Cas,” Dean said softly against his chest. There was a certain fear in his voice. Castiel knew it was because in the end, only one of them would be able to come out alive.
Steve saw Winchester gesture to the spot on his arm where it was a pulsing red from beneath his clothes.
Kudos and Comment?
He opened his bag and found supplies. A long thin water flask with water, a notepad and pen, a pack of raw meat, rope, tarp, sleeping bag, a chocolate bar and…huh…a Pen Knife.
“You remind me of my brother.” Castiel heard himself say. Which suprised Castiel because that is not what he wanted to say. He hasn't spoken about Jimmy in a
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looked at Sam with a his ‘I have a plan face’
He was in the middle of explaining about Djinns when the door opened and Dean lost his balance from the edge of the table he was sitting on.
“Too lucky, although, Dick Roman did give a good Game, the Capitol loved it.”
It seemed Sam was the first to recover when Dean gave a particularly loud moan that was swallowed by Castiel.
"No I mean literal Hell, like the blazing fire, the torture, and you know what's the best part, Everytime you get broken from a piece of torture... You get put back together again, and then it happens again and again, oh and also time is different in Hell... 4 months on land equals 4 years in Hell... For three years I was on the rack... And the fourth year... I was the person torturing souls on the rack... And I loved it."
"Crowley..." Dean growled. Much to the amusement of everyone.
“Hope is the first step to disappointment, ” Dean whispered, leaning in to press his forehead against Castiel, “But for you, I’ll hold on to it.” He continued, with a chaste kiss.
Steve had a hard time coming to terms with this information. He was a raised catholic. But after the war, religion didn't matter much to him.
“We could whistle?”
He back away, “What you did for the girl in District 11 a few days ago, no one ever did that before.”
Dean hated this. He hated what all these people were going to loose.
The girl seemed to have sat straighter. Concentrating now. “Oh yes, Mr um Winchester, Mrs Potts was expecting you, right this way please.”
“We’ve neat Lucifer himself, Sammy, and besides, we fought these sons of bitch’s before.”
He had a death glare that could rival his. Forest green eyes with gold specks glaring in fury, anger and irrattion, although there was something else in them... Something Bucky recononised. He seemed to have a good, well built body beneath the awful lot of clothes.
"What baby? You have a kid?"  Tony asked. He sounded panicky.
He thought the war was finally over. No more fighting and no more powerful psychos.
His heart beating as he saw a bright light ahead and soon he was in the arena.
After the…
Dean wished Jo luck as she went in for her turn. She was damn good at lifting heavy shit as she helped in Roadhouse.
“Dean.”
He shot an arrow to the first one, hitting it straight in the eye, the thing whimpered pathetically before falling.
"Well, he calls himself king, he is now in charge of hell seeing as the Knights are either dead or banished and the Princes seemed to have disappeared."
"We can give you all the resources you need, Mr Winchester."
"And that one time almost cost me my other eye, now you will finish your homework and listen to Wanda."
Deans smile fell. His breath hitching. Castiel’s eyes dropped to Dean’s lips when he licked them, Dean’s eyes unconsciously doing the same before shyly glancing back at Castiel.
"The information we get-"
Scott looked like Tony just gave him the moon and stars.
“What do you mean we need to prepare, I thought none of our weapons could kill these thing.” Steve asked.
Fury had a feeling that it wasn't the end.
“Attention Tributes, unfortunately, there can only be one Victor, we are sorry for the inconvenience.” Dick Roman’s voice called,a clearly heard grin in his voice.
“It’s a Mockingjay, you remind of them.”
“You have grace and innocence to you, use that and play with Capitols emotions for you Jo, it will get you sponsors and sympathy because of that.” He advised her. He went on about how the Capitol always love a good drama so if possible she must make up a sob and sad story. Not that it was hard. District 12 was full of sadness and dullness.
"Hey Cas, whats up?" Winchester asked, putting his phone on speaker.
Castel was as impressed as the Capitol. The blonde chick, Jo, Castiel thinks her name was, looked stunning in her dress. But Dean looked… Well… Words couldn’t describe him.
Castiel was awoken by cursing and ramblings. When he got up he saw Allister, Lucifer, Gordon and Michael look frustrated and annoyed. Meg was suspiciously quiet.
“Mrs Potts, my brothers life is also important, so anything happens to him because of your husband and his team of mutants, then I assure you, you will have the wrath of Heaven at your doorstep.”
Everyone’s eyes popped out of their head when the man pulled Dean into a full blown lip lock. Taking full control of the  kiss.
“Me too, Cas.” Dean whispered. Castiel felt his heart leap. There was pure honesty in Dean’s eyes. Castiel hoped that his eyes conveyed the same message. It must have did because Dean leaned in, slowly, stopping a breath away, hesitant.
Then you get the Middle Rank Demons, they are much more stronger and possess a higher amount of abilities then Lower Ranks, they possess Low Rank abilities as well as Biokenies (the ability to manipulate the body's of other beings), Invisiblity, Pytikenises (ability to create fire out of nothing), Soul Reading, Terrakenises (cause minor natural disasters), weather manipulation,
“Your outfit, it’s heat and extreme weather tolerant, it’s what little I can do to help you.” Benny said, putting Dean’s amulet around his neck, safely hidden in the comfortable leather outfit, he also pinned a golden token on Dean, when Dean glanced down he saw a Mockingjay.
"Start again, Stark... What actually happened?" Fury asked once he was done. There was something off though. It was as if Fury was pleading to be wrong. Which was so wierd.
Dean doesn’t know why he didn’t immediately escape from there or even kill them but it probably had to do with the fact that Castiel smirked with shake of his head and winked up at him before going back as of nothing happened.
Once he was done, he packed what he didn’t need right now into his bag and then he dug into the pie. Moaning when his taste buds seemed satisfied. He was about to take another bite when shuffling distracted him. Quickly, placing his pie down (like hell was he gonna waste it) turning with his bow strung he saw Jessica and Jo.
All mistakes and errors are on me. ♥️
Yet the fact that there was this whole plane of Angels and Demons and the Supernatural, it amazed yet scared him.
Dean, do you know what could have happened if you hit someone important? Bobby, say something.” Rowena reprimanded. Dean rolled his eyes.
"I'm sorry..."
They were camping at the Cornucopia. In the centre of the re dug mines where a leap pile of food and survival supplies.
Tony did not want to know what that was about.
"My name is Phil Colson from the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."
“Screw you…” And to Sam’s horror, Dean effortlessly raised the knife and aimed it at the camera. Causing a Crack, before he climbed a tree and went out of view.
He’d burn the whole world for his beloved Dean.
"Anyways, you get the lower rank demons with mediocre Abilties like Demonic Possesion, immortality, super strength, super stamina, super senses... These are usually the pawns in the war or battle or fight,
"So, what can I help the Avengers with?"
"Found him." Sam said, smiling in victory.
"Does anyone want to talk about what just happened?!" Tony Stark exploded. They were in the briefing room.
I do not live in America and my country currency is much different from it, so I know Jack Shit about Dollars and how much money means weather something is expensive or reasonable or cheap, so sorry for that Inaccuracy.
“People took your form off…young love... as a sign of defiance…they think that if a boy from District 12 can get away then surely, we can…”
“Dammit, Cas!”
Winchester just looked resigned at the nickname. And Tony couldn't blame him. Dean-o was better then...then Squrrial.
Just as he made his way towards Baby, a black van pulled in front. It looked FBI and Dean mentally prepared himself for any Law Enforcement.
Winchester refused to talk about Sam or Castiel. Vaguely mentioned them only.
“You…have…to…win.”
The Guardians were actually looking intrigued by the turn of events. Wanda, Barns, Steve, Peter and Scott were looking slightly awed (probably at the fact that this whole new world exists). Everyone else was focused.
"Why do you think we need your help?" Captain America asked.
Fury hoped that they were not dealing with demons because from what he heard, they were nasty motherf*ckers.
I have also found new motivation to write this fic so you can expect regular updates.
“I heard four other canons go off…” Castiel said, hesitant.
Dean snorted. Clearly they were dealing with A Prince of Hell and his minions. But the curious 'He' would not have been mentioned if the Prince of Hell arrived. So there's a much bigger power in play.
They moved out for the day. They would begin training tomorrow. The Guardians decided to stay and help seeing as Captain Marvel or Carol Danvas, is taking care of things up in space.
Castiel swore that one day he would avenge his brothers death, but, like the usual Capitol style, everyone forgot about Jimmy Novak.
“What happened to your merry band of misfits? I heard Canons go off a while back after…never mind.” Winchester suddenly asked. Breaking the silence.
"Woah there, we were not going to do anything like that, all we want is some consulting on a mission we working on but before that, Fury wants to do a psych evaluation on you as well, which will be added to your file."
Dean held back a sob. What the hell is he going to do?
“Well…this…is unexpected…come on stage dear.” Rowena said. Something flashing in her green eyes.
“Yeah, not really attractive.”
"Can I get you without the flannel? No, so I think that answers your question doesn't it darling?"
“Someone or something breached the security Boss evacuation was a success but I will need to put the tower on full lock down… it’s bad Boss.” FRIDAY said, sounding way to distressed for an AI.
Who nicknames someone squirrel?
"Ah, Captain Rogers, I see you grew a beard, love it by the way, very
Dean Winchester watched as his little brother went away with the bus. He pulled his phone out when he heard a chime. John was back from the bar. Dean sighed.
Castiel. And you and your brother, for the part you played in it all. But my dad is in Heaven now,” she said with a smile, looking peaceful for the first time since their conversation had begun. “Castiel died before someone brought him back to life. My dad died when Cas did, but whatever brought him back, didn’t bring my dad back, too. He’s been gone a long time, and that’s okay, really. I know he’s happy up there, with my mom. And I know I’ll see them again someday.”
Dean watched her go, blinking blankly after her as her words slowly sunk in. He turned on Cas with a bright red face, refusing to meet his eyes. Castiel didn’t look so ruffled by the woman’s assumption, though he did stare after her with a hint of confusion.
“Honestly, he may not right now. But grown-up him? Pretty sure he knows.”
, he growled to himself,
,” he whispered, tearing the room apart until he found a flashlight, flipping it on and waving it around frantically. There was red paint all over the floor, covering it in strange symbols. It looked like there had been some kind of fight there, with holes in the walls and things knocked over onto the floor. Shoving his worry away, Dean kept moving, praying that he might find Bobby or his brother hidden away somewhere safe. Something must have happened while he was away; there was no way Bobby would have done a ritual like that with Sam in the house.
Castiel didn’t waste any time, striding forward to hover over the largest vampire, waiting for the others to move into position over their own targets before reaching down, slamming his machete down on the unsuspecting vampire’s neck. Mary and Dean struck at the same time, killing their own monsters. Dean’s let out a loud, guttural scream though, choking on his blood due to a weaker strike. Dean, panicking, struck again. The vampire died on the second strike but it was already too late. The remaining two monsters woke up, instantly moving into fight mode.
Why is it never anything pleasant, like
Travelling via angel express was a lot less jarring than via spell, and Dean had Cas to thank that his stomach was so used to travel like this that he barely acknowledged it, other than a small stumble as he tried to find his equilibrium.
She handed a blood-coated machete to Dean, then passed one to Castiel, as well. As their hands brushed, she looked up, catching his eye and subtly jerking her head towards Dean. He unsheathed his angel blade from his sleeve and rolled nodded solemnly.
Dean stared up at them, wide eyed as a deer in the headlights. Were they joking? This sounded like a really bad joke. “Kind of regret asking, now,” he said, laughing awkwardly before kicking his boots off. He stretched out on the couch, throwing the blanket over himself, and watched Claire scurry up the steps, leaving him alone in the room with Jody.
“Holy shit,” John breathed out, glad that he was already sitting down. Though the angel (
) He was just a small-time hunter; the worst thing he ever ran into was an angry spirit or a skinwalker. Now, Sam was here talking about ‘celestial beings’ and demons and vampires? How much had the world,

“Hey, Rowena,” Sam said with an awkward little chuckle, shaking his head. Dean stared at him; was this Sam’s girlfriend or something? “We, uh. Well, Dean kind of got on the wrong end of a spell. We were wondering if you could come lend some expertise?”
That was actually pretty depressing, he should probably keep that to himself.
John looked gob smacked for all of three seconds before he whirled back towards the window, pulling up the blinds and looking around the desolate parking lot with a furious expression on his face. But, of course, there was no black Impala parked near his monster of a truck, or anywhere else he could see. John turned on Dean, face red and eyes blazing.
He felt like a person, and that was a terrifying thought.
Did they turn out alright, even after everything that had worked against them?
? “Taught you better than that, didn’t I?”
; when they hugged each other after world-ending events, holding on as if they would never let go.
“1994. I’m 15. Sammy’s supposed to be 11.” And wasn’t that weird, that none of what he just said was the truth today. The year was 2020. He was supposed to be 41. Sammy was 38, now. What a trip. “We’re staying with Uncle Bobby for the summer, ‘cuz Dad found a big hunt out West. Didn’t want to drag us along, I guess.” He looked up at Jody, wiping his mouth again, looking hopeful. “Is Bobby still around? You said his house has been empty for a while.”
“I can eat, but I’m an angel. It all just tastes like molecules, sadly.”
Dean stared at her with wide eyes, slightly intimidated, still reeling from the revelation that, apparently, he had the hots for a guy in the future. No, an angel? A guy-shaped angel?
with that? With some monster
“What year is it?” Sam asked instead of touching that topic with a ten-foot pole; it
Dean snorted and traded an amused looked with Sam, before taking control of the conversation once more. “He’s not lying. Cas is a true-blue angel. Do the wing-thing, Cas, that always convinces people.”
No one spoke after that outburst and everyone seemed more than thankful for it. Mary pulled up in front of the first motel she saw and threw the car into park, hopping out as quickly as she could. “We’ll stay here tonight, search around for any good hideouts the vamps might be using, and then check them out in the daylight.” Dean nodded, following Cas to sit on the hood of the car while Mary stepped into the office to grab them a room.

“Okay, kid,” the woman said, sounding exasperated, “what the

Rolling his eyes, Castiel did as was asked of him, though he didn’t look happy about the delay in their mission. “That’s not going to do anything to me, either,” he grumbled lowly, but let John cut his arm all the same. Dean leaned across the bed to pat his arm consolingly, smirk in place as his eyes sparkled at Cas’s grumpiness.
! Why would you talk to a
Castiel looked more than ready to start throwing punches, but took a steadying breath and nodded, tilting his head down and fully facing John as his blue eyes turned electric, the lights began flickering in the room, and a burst of light cast large shadows against the far wall in the shape of injured, broken wings that could hardly extend past his shoulders. He held the pose for a moment before the lights returned to normal and the man just looked like any other regular, sleep-deprived tax accountant.
Though he was trying super hard to be quiet, he swallowed just a little too loudly, his dry throat clicking in the silence. The door was yanked forward, away from his hiding spot, and a beam of light was shone in his face. He blinked awkwardly against the light, flinching back as he brandished his weapon.
Dean had woken from his nap, it seemed, as he was sitting at the table with Cas, Sam, and Rowena. They were smiling, laughing together, but Dean’s face looked a little strained, like he wasn’t totally feeling the mirth.
It was daylight so Mary wasn’t too worried about the vamps having the upper hand. All she had to do was kick open a window and they’d all be scrambling for cover.
Dean gave Claire a long-suffering look, raising his brows at her. “Sorry if you forgot, but I got no clue who the hell that guy is. Who’s Cas?” His face screwed up in confusion, looking back at the picture. “Kind of a weird name for a dude, right?”
, y’know? I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, or Sam.”
to be driven. He smiled wide, hustling over to the driver’s side door, but Sam shooed him away like an annoying toddler.
“Uhm,” he stammered, glancing between the phone and the woman. “Define ‘okay’? Are you my Sam? What the
Mary kept quiet. Castiel moved to stand beside the brothers and Dean loosened his hold on Sam, leaning his arm around Sam’s giant shoulders instead, pushing his little brother’s head until he was leaning against Dean’s stomach. “It went great. Got all five of ‘em, burned and buried the bodies. In and out. All’s good.”
Instead, she found herself wandering back through the bunker. Eventually, her feet led her to Dean’s doorway, peeking inside. Castiel was still propped up against the headboard, one hand holding up a book and the other threaded through Dean’s short hair. He heard her shifting in the doorway and lifted his head to meet her curious gaze with a protective, fierce expression, as if he would fight her if she made just one wrong move. She nodded, took one last look at Dean’s peaceful, youthful face, and walked away.
Finally, the door to his room opened slowly, and he sucked himself into the corner, making himself as small as possible, holding his breath as he saw a stream of light move around the room.
Dean nodded, filing that away for later. Maybe he could try to pump Cas for information on older-him. Claire did say they were best friends, right? “Uh, what are you reading?” he asked instead, not really caring but definitely wanting to break the silence between them.
Thank you everyone for sticking with this, I hope you enjoy it!
Dean was laughing, and it hurt, but it was cathartic. He felt like an idiot, but what was new? “Okay,” he admitted, feeling more than a little stupid, but it felt good to laugh. “I’ll admit, I didn’t think about that.” He threw a crooked grin Cas’s way, feeling his cheeks tint pink. Castiel just knocked their shoulders together in a friendly way; Dean didn’t question it, just let himself enjoy the feeling.
God, Bobby was going to absolutely
, before turning a fierce, warrior-of-the-heavenly-host gaze on the man in front of him. “John Winchester,” he boomed, using a bit of his grace to let the tiniest hint of his true voice shine through, and felt satisfaction at the fact that the man flinched, “Nice to meet you, I suppose.” John reared back like someone had slapped him, eyes wide as he looked Cas up and down, one hand rubbing at his ear.
to be a kid. If I’m supposed to be an adult, then
Sam shoved his phone in Rowena’s face as soon as he found his bearings, and Castiel helped Jack sit down to catch his breath. The kid was looking pale again, even a little more sickly than before, too. Dean moved to the kitchen and filled a glass of water, before returning and silently pressing it into Jack’s shaking hands. He drank from it gratefully before setting it aside, hands fidgeting in his lap while he waited for Rowena’s judgement.
has been closed for years.”
“I’m just going to touch your head, dear,” Rowena explained, reaching a long, soft hand into his personal space. Castiel’s heavy hand on his shoulder helped ground him, and he took a deep breath, letting her continue. “I’m going to try and see if I can find the spell holding on to you. See if I can unravel it.”
Dean nodded, though he wasn’t quite sure what, if anything, they could honestly do. He had never heard of witches doing anything like this before, but, then again, Dad usually kept him away from witches if he could.
Surfacing for a moment from his shock and pain, Dean’s head whipped up, turning to give the blonde a more intense once over. “You’re a hunter?” he asked, voice higher pitched than he was honestly comfortable with, but he couldn’t control himself. Her, a
Suddenly, Dean didn’t feel so hungry anymore. The food he had shoveled into his mouth just minutes before felt like a heavy, uncomfortable stone in his stomach. He leaned back, folding his arms on his knees, trying to school his face. God, but he hated how easy it was to read him, sometimes. It always took him a second to clear his face, and in that initial second, he always gave away a lot.
Sam just rolled his eyes, and Dean didn’t think a shapeshifter or a djinn would go to that amount of trouble to copy his little brother’s mannerisms. His smile was just the same, too. “Yeah, man. And you
“Dean was heading up to Bobby’s to grab a few lore books for me. I don’t know if he touched something he shouldn’t have, or if it was something more malicious than that. Hey, Cas. Can you give Dean’s cell a call? See if he’s still here?”

? This was a dream come true; his brother a badass hunter working side by side with him, his mother alive and well and right in front of him, and he was being a big, stupid, crybaby about it all because he wasn’t who he was supposed to be. How ungrateful could he be?
“Not for me. Not if it’s you.”

Castiel scoffed, rolling his eyes fondly. “Of course I meant if,” Castiel said, almost hurt that Dean could believe anything less. “Dean, you’ve
“You’re
Dad’s old Led Zeppelin mixtape was blaring through the speakers, and Dean was honestly impressed the thing was still working. He would have thought it would have spun out by now. Sammy was driving, which was weird, but this wasn’t his snot-nosed little brother. This was Sam, the seasoned hunter and honest-to-God adult behind the wheel.
The man next to Sam was shorter, with dark, messy hair and brilliant blue eyes. He had crow’s feet when he smiled, his lips pulling up like it was an expression he wasn’t used to wearing.
Growing up, Mary Winchester had practically been a religious figure in their family. Dean hardly remembered her, and what he did remember was hazy and rose-colored. Dad only talked about the good things, about how loving and funny and bright she had been. Over the years, the woman had been practically deified. When Dean had been young, he had made up stories for Sammy about their mom, made her into a superhero, something larger than life. Eventually, she had become something bigger, something

“What’s going on in here?!” Jody asked, rushing into the kitchen, sounding flustered and worried as she rounded the corner, still buttoning up her shirt. Her eyes looked a little wild until she saw Dean at the stove, not Claire. She sighed in relief, shaking her head, one hand on her pounding heart. “Oh, thank God. I thought Claire was trying to cook again.”
There was a long, tense silence, followed by the sound of banging and things moving around on the other end, before Rowena finally answered. “Why is it every time you call me, it’s because something’s gone wrong?” she asked, sounding angry and put-out. “
“I’m not sure how much of this you’re going to remember, if we can reverse this, but I do have…
He opened the door with one quick movement. He had been expecting his mom, or Sam, or some other person he hadn’t met yet, but what he hadn’t been expecting was a worried Castiel, standing at his door with one hand in his trench coat pocket and one hand raised as if to knock again, face open and worried and a little bit sad. His eyes grew wide when the door swung open, but attempted to give Dean a weak smile anyway.
fifty years old, stood behind them, shotgun raised and aimed their direction, a scowl firmly in place as he eyed them all warily.
. He was a pretty straight-forward guy, with a simple thought process, simple needs, and simple wants.
Just as she was closing the trunk, Dean skidded into the garage, Castiel on his heels. She smiled as Dean silently debated where to sit, before crawling into the backseat, tugging on Castiel’s sleeve until he followed him. Mary settled into the driver’s seat, put on some soft classic rock she knew Dean would recognize, and started toward their destination.
of pent-up air.
The sun had set and cold was starting to sink in. Bobby had only sent him down the road to pick up a few things from the store for dinner, and he had gone and passed out, or gotten knocked out, or
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean crowed, moving up behind his brother and pinning him into a headlock, ruffling his long hair playfully. Though Sam could have easily broken his hold, he let Dean mess with him until his big brother was throwing around a real smile, too.
trying to find the counter-curse while Dean had been in constant pain. Witches, man. He wondered if Sammy even remembered that whole disaster.
“Oh, my. You really are young, aren’t you?” she breathed out, sounding worried, now. “Well, don’t fret. I’ll meet you at the bunker, yes? I can be there in a few hours, I suppose, if I hurry.”
“I always wanted a little brother,” the dark-haired girl chimed in wistfully, giving Dean an appraising look, her eyes soft and teasing. “Hi! I’m Alex, this is Claire. Patience is the one yelling upstairs. What’s your name?”
-and are still playing at some game we don’t know yet. So, no.
Could he go back to that, and be okay with the things he had seen and done?
“He just could never see things from my side, y’know? And no offense to this Sam, but he’s always been kind of self-centered. Side effect of being the spoiled baby of the family, I’m sure, but he’s always been a good kid, just not totally understanding. But
Sam turned and gave Dean a
Were he and Cas… together?
“Are we done arguing now?” Cas asked into the silence, sounding exasperated. Dean laughed loudly, clapping his hand down on the other man’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” Dean said softly, shifting again to shove his hands in his pockets, rocking uncomfortably on his feet. He couldn’t meet anyone’s eyes. He was still within arm’s reach of his brother, though, who had always clung so tightly to him growing up. Well, until he had become a teenager and started fighting with
“Dean?” she breathed, and Dean shivered, a chill rolling down his spine. He barely remembered her from when he was little, before the fire. To hear her say his name, it was like a miracle.
He was content, if not happy, as an adult. Even if he was scared, too, but that was a part of life. Shouldn’t he be getting back to that? To that life that seemed so damn important to all the other people in his life?
The woman swung her flashlight around the room, squinting oddly at the empty space where the lamp had sat, before she turned around and started heading back out the door.
Dean nearly choked on his spit. “Excuse me? We’re friends with
Dean felt a swell of frustration erupt from his chest and he trembled beneath the angel’s grip, his own hands clenching into fists as he tried to keep himself calm. He couldn’t fix himself and this witch couldn’t fix him, either. What was it going to take? He wasn’t supposed to be a kid; Sam needed his big brother back, and Castiel needed his friend. No one needed
The angel was sitting grim and dissatisfied beside him in the back seat. Mary was scowling through the windshield, still rubbing at her sore throat. Though he was trying to calm down and settle into the high of a job well done, Dean still felt adrenaline pumping through his veins, his heart hammering uncomfortably against his chest as he tried not to look between the two adults in the car.
“Wow,” Sam drawled unconcerned from the side lines, leaning back against the bed on his arms, taking in the scene. “Just like old times, huh, Dean?” That seemed to break the tension, and Dean reared his head back, smirking in Sam’s direction. Castiel rolled his eyes, and John slowly felt his heart rate slow, the red in his vision receding enough to realize he had just made an ass of himself, but no one was even batting an eye.
Sam sighed, blowing out a long breath and ruffling his hair up in the process. “We, uh. Well, we need something that got destroyed a long time ago. I didn’t think this was how we were going to get ahold of it, though. If we take it from this timeline without returning it, we won’t have it in your present timeline when we need it. Unless Cas can make a copy, or something. Rowena wasn’t very upfront about the spell.”
Sam gave him a little self-deprecating snort at that observation. “These are yours, actually. I just browned them.”
about it.”
“No, you aren’t,” he said in response, sounding exasperated.
There is a fight scene in this chapter, so, sorry you have to suffer through that to get to the emotional drama at the end (fights are NOT my forte). We're almost to the end! One more full chapter and then maybe an epilogue? Haven't decided yet!
Jody and Claire both seemed to have noticed how sad, how angry, how
Castiel, the angel, seemed to perk up at the song, a little smile on his face as he glanced meaningfully at Dean, who simply chuckled brightly and nodded in response. John wasn’t sure what exactly that was supposed to mean, but the angel leaned back in his seat comfortably and did something with his hands that John couldn’t quite see.
. He may have time travelled or something, but he wasn’t a total idiot. He was more interested in… “And that’s Cas!”
Dean stared at him in shock for probably longer than he should have, seeing as he had a gun trained on them, before he turned on Sam, dropping his arms so he could wave them in their father’s direction. “What the hell, Sam? Did Rowena screw up the spell? This is not what we were going for!”
Claire took it the wrong way, bristling at his tone, his words.
Bristling, Mary nodded. She felt a little hurt, though. Did Sam really think she would be so hard on her own child?
. Huh.
“Sure thing, sister. See ya around,” he told her, before turning and waving at the others he hadn’t interacted with much. He watched in silent fascination as Claire moved on to Castiel, hesitantly wrapping him up in a hug, too. He looked a little unsure of what he was supposed to do with his own arms, but finally did settle on tugging her close to his body, and she practically melted against his chest. When she pulled away, her voice was a tiny bit shakier than before.
“Dean,” Sam said forcefully, making his brother glance up, “whatever’s going through your head,
He had never expected to see her again, certainly not in the flesh, and he wasn’t sure how to handle her and all her real-person issues.
about it. Like we were
With Castiel on Dean-watching duty, Sam felt marginally better about leaving his brother to his own devices. Instead, he focused on discussing their current problem with Rowena. They traded ideas back and forth while Mary stood off to the side. She watched them like a tennis match, if she had no clue what the rules to tennis were.
Instead, they were hardly paying attention to him. Sam was staring at the shard in Castiel’s hand, nodding along to something the angel was saying softly. They weren’t even paying attention as he tried and failed to fix himself.
The third man, leaning into the second’s personal space, had short, spiky hair, his own familiar green eyes staring back at him as he sent the camera his signature cocky grin, though it had softened with age.
Sure enough, there at the end of the street Dean caught sight of a diner he and Bobby and Sam frequented when Dad would ditch them there on his more dangerous cases. So, if the diner was there, then Bobby’s…
“Hey. Don’t look at me like that, man. I’m fine. It’s all fine. Let’s keep trying.”
Dean held his face in his hands, wide eyed and confused and hating every second of this. “But! I don’t
“So, it is your kid?” Bobby asked, like a dog with a bone. Sam was really laughing now, and Dean sighed, deflating beneath Bobby’s expectant glare.
Dean blew out a relieved sigh, running a hand over his face. “Okay. That’s something, at least.” His fingers drummed against the counter, anxious as his eyes flitted around the diner, eyeing the other patrons, watching the door, checking the kitchen through the little service window.
He stared at the door. It was solid and wooden, something that looked like it would be difficult to knock or kick down. It was a good door. He
“So,” Claire said, breaking into his little bubble of peace. He glanced up at her, mouth full, cheeks puffed out as he tried to chew through the excess food. She looked vaguely disgusted, partly proud.
When no one answered, Dean reached up and grabbed the spare key from the porch light, easily slipping it into the lock, though it was hard to shove the door open. Looking around, Dean didn’t think the place had been touched in years. There was dirt, dust, and ash everywhere, signs of a massive fire following him around the house as he moved deeper and deeper inside.
job of it. He set his burger down and crept towards the doorway, leaning forward so he could hear Sam’s half of the conversation better. Castiel watched him go with a sigh, but he didn’t try to stop him, so it couldn’t be anything too bad, he reasoned.
too trusting with all these strangers, so far.
He loved these moments, but nights were long in the bunker, and they could get boring without anyone to interact with. He had taken to falling into a sort of meditative mindset, letting his mind wander through his memories, his thoughts, his fantasies of the future. He let his hand continue moving through Dean’s hair, scratching at his scalp, enjoying the happy little sighs he released at the feeling.
“This is my cell phone. Everybody’s got one now and they’ve gotten a lot better, a lot faster. Kind of like a little computer you can carry around with you.” He turned the phone so John could see what he had pulled up. There was a picture there, of an old, leatherbound book. He couldn’t make out the title, but it looked ancient, probably rare, and he wasn’t sure where the hell the boys thought they were going to find it.
, he thought callously to himself, but the way she was looking at him, he knew he must be close with her as an adult. Maybe he really
Dean whirled on his heel and headed the opposite direction, knowing more or less where he was going now that he had somewhere to start. The town dwindled away, and he followed the road until he caught sight of the sign for
, really. Dad’s never gone up against ‘em, far as I know.”
Looking around in a daze, Dean tried to figure out where he was, but nothing looked familiar. The street was empty, most of the lights in the surrounding buildings were off, and he didn’t recognize any of the street signs or businesses.
, looked up and met Dean’s eyes as she said, “Well. I’m standing here in Bobby’s house with Dean. But he’s about, oh, a foot and a half shorter, and missing about fifteen, maybe twenty years.”
“Not that he’s not scary as shit, but after you’ve seen him grumpy in the morning without a cup of coffee, or waxing poetic about bees, or looking confused about movie references, he’s not so intimidating. At least, not to us. He’s been a part of our family for, what, twelve years now? Nearly thirteen?”
Feeling that empty maw inside himself opening up, Dean eagerly leaned forward, looking forward to the promise of more food than he could eat. “Thanks,” he said through a mouthful of food, shoving bite after bite in his mouth, practically shoveling it in. It tasted good. Homemade, even, if he had to guess. He couldn’t even remember the last time he had had something homemade like this.
“He’s our kid, but he’s adopted. He’s still a Winchester, though.”
Dean was grinning so wide he felt his face might crack in two. He had a kitchen, and a fridge, and was in one place long enough to have pre-made burgers ready to fry up whenever. The future
Jack shook his head at the thought, but couldn’t deny the truth of it. He loved his crazy life, and his crazy family, and settled down at the table across from Sam with his laptop, trying to emulate their casualness. This was his home, this was his family, and he couldn’t ask for more.
) looked away, suddenly more interested in whatever Jody was doing by the front door than their conversation. His ears were tinging pink, though, and Dean was morbidly fascinated.
“So,” he started, turning to look at Sam, “you’re really my baby brother, huh?” Now that he was alone with them, Dean was starting to feel some doubts.
“So, Claire!” Jody said, a bit too loud and bit too obviously trying to change the subject. “How did that hunt in Minnesota go? You went with Donna, right?”
. However, I believe you smelled my scent on your pillows because we use the same shampoo.” The statement hung in the air between them, and Dean frowned. “Sam has a special bottle for himself, and you and I share the same bottle.”
“Really, you guys don’t have to do this for me. I’m sure I’ll be fine.”
Bobby stared at them for a long moment, apparently digesting that fact, before he turned to the library and started rooting through books. Castiel stood as well, moving around the room and taking in the books, the weapons, the dust surrounding them with a fond look in his eyes. Dean watched him with a soft face, but Sam just looked sad.
?) of himself that he had made the plunge by age forty. He thought he would probably bury that desire deep enough that he could never touch it again, after all of his father’s drunken ramblings that still played like a bad recording in his head any time he looked at a boy for too long, too hard.

“Sit,” John ordered, pulling out a silver knife. Dean smirked at this old song and dance, when the worst thing that happened to them was shapeshifters and demons. He sat on the edge of the bed and bared his arm, Sam following suit though he looked more than a little longsuffering for doing so. After he gave each of them a cut, and nothing happened, John turned to Castiel, waving for him to roll his sleeve up, as well.
Dean had screamed into a pillow for a few minutes, trying to vent his frustrations, but it hadn’t helped much. His insides were squirming uncomfortably, and it felt like a million ants were marching beneath his skin, and he was having trouble focusing. This whole jump into the future was freaking him out, more than he had realized.
be. But yes, the more he looked, the more certain he was that the woman was their mother. Mary Winchester, alive and in the flesh, standing between her two giant sons and beaming ear to ear.
The music filled the silence in the car for all of two or three minutes before Dean couldn’t hold back anymore, a little bit of trepidation starting to filter into his mind. He had been a
Castiel just shrugged. “I can’t say it’s happened before with
Dean whipped his head around, breaking the glare that was forming between him and the angel. “Hey!” he grumbled, staring at Sam with defiance. The angel ignored Dean’s hostile mumbling, taking a seat next to him on the couch as Dean tried to lean around him, still glaring at his brother. “I’m right here, man.”
“I found three barns out in the middle of nowhere that look likely. We’ll get some sleep tonight and then check them out tomorrow.” Castiel nodded; the sun was already starting to set on the horizon. Dean stood and flopped down on one of the beds, grabbing the remote and flipping on some old Scooby-Doo episode. Then, he pulled the weapons bag close and started sharpening the machetes Mary had grabbed from the bunker storeroom, as if it were routine to be maintaining weapons while watching cartoons.
Looking up at Cas, the guy that had been so kind and calm towards him since he found himself here, well. He found he really didn’t mind. Cas was a good guy, sweet and a little awkward but kind and considerate and fucking terror in a fight.
When they pulled into a short driveway in front of a cute, normal-looking house, Dean noticed the windows were lit up with lights, a few people moving around casting shadows, and his insides squirmed uncomfortably.
“Mom,” Dean called softly, dropping his machete to reach her side with both hands outstretched. “Are you okay?”
“Hey now,” the vampire said, flashing her teeth dangerously, “gotta eat, don’t I?” She smirked, leaning down to take a deep sniff at Mary’s throat, and Mary let out a loud, cut-off shriek. “In fact…,” she drawled. Mary glared at the far wall, eyes determined and hard as she flexed her hands around the vampire’s, her nails digging into the other woman’s skin.
“Excuse me!” John barked again, waving the gun menacingly, as if they had forgotten he had it. “Who the
It was moments like these that Castiel treasured most. Dean was snoring lightly at his hip, one hand fisted in Castiel’s trench coat. Cas let his hand move through Dean’s short hair in a reverent manner, over and over, soothingly.
Mary’s eyes were fierce, fiery, ready to start an argument. Sam cut in as quickly as he could. “I don’t really know how to help him, but we’re going to do everything we can. And part of that is making sure we don’t freak him out too much. I want him to be happy while he’s here with us. God knows he was never very happy as a kid. He deserves a little bit of a break.”
than a real person in his head.
“We left a lot of stuff in Bobby’s house after it burned,” Sam said with a sigh, running a massive hand over his massive face. “He might have touched something, you know how he is.” Sam looked off into the distance, probably trying to think back if Bobby had anything that powerful just laying around.
“Alright, Sam. We’ll catch up with you guys tomorrow.” She waited for Dean to nod before she hung up, pocketing the phone and turning her flashlight towards the front door. “Come on, kiddo. I think we have some leftovers in the fridge at home, I know how much you love lasagna.” Dean wasn’t so sure about hopping into a cop car, but the lady let him sit up front with her, and that went a long way towards making him trust her.
Dean wolfed his food down as if someone were going to yank it away and Mary watched him closely, eyes growing sadder as his plate emptied. When his food was gone and he was staring at it blankly, Mary finished off her sandwich and silently pushed the rest of her fries his way. He glanced up, eyes wide and a little shocked, before gratefully pulling them closer, eating those up too. Finally, he looked sated, leaning back and wiping his greasy fingers off on his jeans.
Mary refused to meet the angel’s eyes, instead choosing to focus on finding their turnoff. How had this conversation derailed so horribly? She had just wanted to know a little more about Dean, about where he came from and what he was up to. She didn’t understand how she had screwed things up so badly, once again.
“Alright,” John said, propping the gun up against the wall and placing both hands on his hips, looking the three over critically. “What the devil is going on, boys? You look like you’ve been through a damn
“Not officially,” Claire admitted, and the angel (
“I know this must be extremely trying for you,” Castiel began, eyes sad as he stared up at Dean. “It was much the same the first time around, when you met your mother again. You have very complex feelings about her. I’m sure having her here on top of everything else going on can be… a lot.”
“All this trouble for

Were they
“Yeah, Bobby sent me down the road to pick stuff up for dinner, while him and Sam were cleaning the kitchen. Sam kept griping, wanted to come with, but Bobby said it didn’t hurt him to help out.” Dean was grinning wide, laughing as he recounted Bobby’s stubborn grumpiness. Castiel cracked a smile, too, easily envisioning the scene.
, Claire ran a hand through her long hair before waving it through the air between them. “So,” she started, sounding like she was going to be giving the most boring lecture of her life, “to start off, angels are real.” She paused, waiting for his reaction, but he didn’t move. Didn’t even twitch a muscle. Was she fucking with him?

The angel was staring at him closely, like he couldn’t make sense of what he was saying. Sam just rolled his eyes and backed away, taking the hint. Jody watched the entire exchange with sad, pitying eyes.

Sam grinned back and relaxed against the seat, sighing into the silence. “I know this must be kind of scary, man. But we’ll figure it out. We always do.”
Dean led them into the diner, picking a booth near the back where he could see the front door while also still looking out the window. Mary put her back to the door and let Castiel sit beside Dean.
A horrible realization hit him.

“Uh, hi!” he said, a little too enthusiastically as he stood and tried to make it out of the room. Dean watched him go, knowing he was trying to hide something and doing a, frankly,
.” Sam waved his hand at Dean, and Dean frowned. The food he had on his plate no longer looked so appetizing. Was he really that much of an idiot?
He was smiling in every single picture, that ever-present terror dimming and overpowering him depending on the picture.
“Now, fair warning; the girls can be a little overwhelming. I’m sure you’ll be fine, though,” Jody said, patting his arm before opening the front door, leading Dean in behind her.
Dean seemed to realize where his thoughts were going, because he just laughed, reaching out to tug the angel against his side again. Castiel the angel went willingly, practically melting against Dean’s side as the hunter jostled him gently, and suddenly Dean’s words from earlier made more sense
“Oh, dear,” Rowena sighed. “Is he there with you?”
“No wonder you had such a shit reputation with other hunters,” Sam went on, shaking his head. “I mean, you used other people as bait
“Fine, I guess,” he grumbled, shrugging his shoulders casually, though inside he was feeling anything but. Castiel kept throwing him clues, stories, thoughts about his older self, and it wasn’t helping him want to grow up again any time soon. He knew he needed to, though, but it was one thing to know what he should do, and another thing to actually man up and

“You want anything to drink while you wait, kiddo?” the waitress asked, noticing how anxious and jumpy he was. Dean gave her a tight-lipped smile and shook his head, trying to calm himself down. It still felt like bugs were crawling under his skin, itching at his organs. “Why not try some lemonade, honey? On the house.”
It was a police officer.
“Of course, of course,” she said, setting her bag down on the table. “Sit, dear. Won’t take but a mo’.” Dean didn’t look so agreeable, so Castiel wrapped a hand around his shoulder and gently guided him down into a seat, hovering behind him as Rowena moved closer. She held out a hand and Dean jerked back, glaring.
, said. “As in,
Claire deflated, sighing and wrapping her arms around herself. She rolled her eyes and looked away, towards Jody. “It’s fine.” With another breath in, she started in on the hunt. “It went great,” she told Jody, eyes lighting up. “Donna let me call the shots. Easy werewolf case. In and out.”
, anything with a pulse, basically.
Dean bristled at that, just like he had earlier, but stood up this time, pulling the kid into his arms. The boy, Jack, let out a whoosh of air, surprised, but melted easily into the hug, tucking his face into the crook of Dean’s neck.
? “But you two have always been really close. I’m literally just waiting for the day you finally admit how you feel to yourselves and get on with it.”

Truthfully, Dean knew he looked at boys as much as he looked at girls. He had never acted on it before, though. Was actually kind of surprised (maybe even
Dean didn’t know where to start, but it seemed Cas did.
Collapsing onto the bed, Dean groaned and tried not to think too hard about the decisions he was going to have to make. Instead, trying to take his mind off of the clusterfuck that was his life, he let his eyes wander around his room, searching for a distraction. In the mess that had been the last few days, he had only given his room a cursory once-over. He hadn’t snooped except for a few minutes on the first night, and that was just a crying shame.
Hmm, weird, but not the weirdest way he’d ever woken up. He gathered his things as quietly as he could and snuck out of the house; he wasn’t too keen on Bobby waking up and shooting at him again.
Her smile faded slowly, quickly falling into worry as she stepped forward, putting a heavy hand on his shoulder and rubbing her thumb against the bone, there. It wasn’t like when Castiel put his hand there, though; the weight wasn’t comforting. It was more alien than comforting, and it made his skin crawl.
“That was the idea, yes.” And then he was leaning forward, pressing their lips together. Dean groaned into the contact, opening his lips for Cas’s tongue, and they made out like two teenagers, hands and lips and eyes flying everywhere.
if they had his name. Maybe he could make a run for it? He was probably faster than this lady, but she might shoot at him, and he wasn’t looking to get shot at tonight…
Thank you everyone for sticking with me here.
“I guess. Easy mysteries, the good guys always win, and it can be funny. It’s easy watching.” Then he rolled over and wormed his way under the covers, head settling next to Castiel’s hip. “I’m gonna go to sleep. You guys don’t have to keep watching this.”
There, on the screen, was a picture of a group of three men, all smiling awkwardly at the camera, with Claire sandwiched in the middle. One was taller than the others, with long brown hair and bright eyes. Dean recognized him immediately.
, if that wasn’t doing something to Dean’s insides. “Did I say something wrong?”
“Should we just take him home, then?” Sam asked Castiel, as if Dean didn’t have a say in any of this. As if he were just some
“Hey, guys. Cas, could you take a look at this?” Castiel stood, peeking into the bag that Sam held open for him, a look of intense focus on his face as he squinted at the contents. He reached a hand inside the bag, pulling out a shard of pottery.
? We would have used the one from our time, but your house kind of, burned down, a while back.”
“It has?” Dean asked, words flying out before he could think better of them. It seemed his mouth was speaking without input from his brain, because then he said, “But, I was just here this morning!”
?” he asked, sounding a little squeaky the longer he ranted. “
“You enjoy this show greatly,” Cas stated, staring intently at the television set. Dean rolled his head until he was looking at Castiel, the tv lighting up behind him.
“How come you don’t eat, Cas?” Dean asked, mouth full as he shoved more food in his mouth.
How Sam could say something that monumental with such a straight face, Dean wasn’t sure. He mulled that information over for a long time, jaw working as he stared at the picture until the screen went dark. Their mother was alive (
“Be careful, old man,” she told him, before sliding away, refusing to meet his eyes. He assumed she didn’t want to admit she was worried about him, and instead of pointing it out, Dean just gave her a cocksure grin.
The silence between them stretched on and on, and Dean was already regretting opening his mouth. He couldn’t face the angel and see what he was feeling.
Dean stood, moving to take his placed beside Cas; he had spent more than enough time with John towering over him with a bad attitude and he definitely wasn’t going to tolerate it today, not when their kid’s life was at stake.
When neither Sam nor Dean seemed happy to answer, Castiel did instead, turning his intense eyes on Bobby as he explained. “Our child was cursed by a witch, and his grace was bound. It has caused him great discomfort, and we fear it may have worse side effects if we cannot reverse it. There is a spell in this book, which I read years ago, in this very room, that could help him. However, I could not recall the specifics, and I did not want to guess with my son’s life in the balance.”
that? Claire didn’t seem to need a response from him, though, already swiping around on the screen. She came and squished herself onto the couch beside him, practically shoving her phone in his face.
“No problem, ma’am. Least I could do, really,” he mumbled under his breath, sliding the bacon onto a plate to cool. “It’s almost ready.”
“We helped a couple cosmic beings sort out their shit, and one of them gave us a gift; she brought Mom back.”
,” she said sternly, her tone one Dean hadn’t heard directed his way since he was four years old, and he winced, smile fading. “Don’t you try to lie to me. What the
He dug through a trash can, then moved on to a dumpster in the next alley before he finally found a newspaper. The date claimed it was 2020, and his fingers froze on the page. That couldn’t be right? Could it?
“Time to go?” Jack asked, and Castiel nodded, joining the group. Jack closed his eyes, glowing faintly gold, and then they were gone in a burst of light.
Jack nodded solemnly, wiping his face and looking up at his family gratefully. “You’ll be careful?” he asked, voice shaking. He sounded so young in that moment, it hurt Dean’s heart to hear.
He didn’t think too hard about the date. The only good news was that the newspaper stated it was the local Sioux Falls print, which meant he couldn’t be far from Bobby’s. He headed toward a busier road, probably the main drag, and prayed he would see
“Likewise?” John said, sounding unsure about that. “Surprised you boys let another hunter tag along with you,” he mumbled afterwards, though he sounded like he didn’t quite believe his own words. This man, a
Dean’s breath eventually evened out and Castiel stared straight ahead at the television. Mary laid down, as well, under the covers, watching Castiel comfort her boy on the opposite bed.
“Well, we’re still pretty much stuck here. I really think the best thing we can do is try to get you to
useful. I know you’re letting me stay here because I’m your brother and you think you need to look after me and I’m just some stupid kid, but you don’t need to worry about me. I know where I stand. I know you need me older. I know I’m not who anybody wants here right now.
John watched their interaction with a raised eyebrow, obviously trying to superimpose the boys he knew in this time over the ones in front of him, now. He eventually broke away from his internal panic to rub anxiously at the back of his neck, walking away to settle at the little table by the window. Maybe some distance would help him wrap his mind around this whole situation?
“Uh, right,” Sam said, tearing his eyes away from Bobby long enough to pull his phone out again, bringing the picture up to show Bobby. “It’s called the
? But, she was so
He wasn’t sure what would come of his confession but he desperately hoped it wouldn’t ruing everything they had built together. This Dean, so young and yet so damn jaded already, had taken it in stride, had ever told him that perhaps his older-self loved him back. Castiel had noticed the picture on the bedside table, of him and Dean standing side by side, smiling at the camera, shoulders brushing. It kindled something bright and burning in his chest, at the thought that Dean kept a reminder of their friendship so close.
at me last time we went mini golfing.”
“What are you three even here for, anyway?” John asked, trying desperately to bridge this enormous gap between him and his boys. In his head, he was still raging at Dean, furious that he had left without permission, but he realized he couldn’t really take it out on this Dean without making an even bigger ass of himself than he already had. Moving on with this conversation sounded best.
Sam rolled his eyes so hard it looked painful, but eventually he had to admit defeat. “Fine,” he ground out, shaking his head as if he already regretted agreeing to this. “But take Cas with you. At least you’ll have more protection with him there.”
“Hey, Jody. What’s up?”
“I’ll go with you,” Cas said with finality, and Dean deflated on the spot, though he looked secretly relieved. Mary smiled, already a little excited about this whole endeavor. She barely knew Dean as he was in the here-and-now, and she didn’t know anything about how he was at sixteen. This would be an eye-opening experience for both of them.
“Well, Samuel. Long time, no see!”
Sam sighed, his face softening as he talked to Dean like he was some scared little kid. “Dean, we know you didn’t mean to. But I’m pretty sure you- well,
“You didn’t have to do this, Dean,” Jody continued, letting Claire go in order to wrap a soft hand around Dean’s shoulder, instead. She gave him a warm smile that Dean didn’t know what to do with. He looked up at her; she was only a little taller than him, and, once again, he felt like a little kid being praised and coddled by his mother.
, more reluctant allies during world-ending catastrophes?”
John paled a little at that but nodded, looking away out the window again, unable to meet their hard, judging gazes.
. There are always ways to erase history and shit,” a blonde girl said scathingly, one hand rifling through a bag of chips and the other flipping the dark-haired girl off.
, or something?” He sounded scandalized, and Claire couldn’t help but laugh out loud.
Dean still felt the tips of his ears flare red and he glanced around, hoping the waitress hadn’t heard him. He just nodded, looking at the menu with new eyes.
“Time to go, boys,” Rowena called, giving the ingredients one last stir. They surrounded her, trading uneasy looks, before linking hands. Rowena began chanting, the candles’ flames growing higher and higher as the bowl caught aflame.
Dean had started pacing about ten minutes ago, after Rowena had explained her hair-brained idea. He didn’t like it, but if it helped Jack…
,” she said, pointing at the paper, “is something I can do. You know I’m not good at sitting around and waiting.”
! Do we have a brother now?” She didn’t sound shocked, just exasperated. Long-suffering, like this had happened before. “You have a serious
“I don’t think it’s as simple as that,” Rowena began, cutting in before it devolved into an argument. “Right now, Dean does not remember being an adult, and I’m sure he hasn’t heard many good stories. All he knows is being a teenager. That’s like you right now, as you are, being told you’re the wrong age, so please remember being older than you are now, and
Not for the first time, Sam kicked himself for being inattentive around the boy; on their last hunt, weeks ago now, a witch had gotten the drop on them, knew they were coming even, and had prepared a spell to weaken any angels they might have with them.
“No, but that’s a good idea. Maybe she’ll know what to do.” He dialed a number and put it on speakerphone, the loud dial tone filling the car. Eventually, someone with a high, Scottish brogue answered, sounding excited and a little tipsy. Dean glanced at the clock; it was only nine thirty in the morning.
of him?
“Us too,” Dean said with a nod, and that was that. Rowena cleared up her things, gave Jack a tight hug, and then moved on. Sam moved to the table in the library with a stack of books and lost himself there. Dean and Cas took each other’s hands and disappeared to their room. Jack watched them all disperse, like it was no skin off their noses that they had time travelled, or seen their long-dead family, all for him.
When he saw the blonde hair, and the green eyes, and the shocked expression, he knew who it was, and was
“You want to leave again?” he finally said, looking up to meet her eyes. Mary winced, wilting beneath his judging glare, so similar to how John would look at her when he was disappointed. It hurt like a knife to the chest. She stood her ground, anyway.
Dean didn’t even flinch.
Excited, Dean quickened his pace, practically running by the time he came to the mouth of the driveway. Something was wrong, though; it was dark, all the lights extinguished, and the house itself looked a lot more rundown than he had ever seen it before. There was something that looked dangerously like char marks climbing up the border of the siding. Dean couldn’t breathe. What the hell had happened?
“Call it mother’s intuition.” Castiel nodded gravely, looking away, face suddenly grave and solemn as he thought through her words. Mary rolled onto her back and sighed, letting herself settle enough to fall asleep. There was nowhere else more protected, she thought, than under the watch of an angel like Castiel.
“Alright, now what’s this about a book?”
He wandered through the bunker for a while, anger and fear and pain spiking through his heart, his head, thrumming through his body like contained lightning. He was going to vibrate through the floor if he didn’t find something to distract himself. He stepped through the library, intent on just moving forward and maybe hiding out in his room (
. I’m going to miss grown-up you, but I’d be more than happy to have you around, too. I’m not trying to force anything on you. I just thought, I
“That’s all water under the bridge, dear. Now, come along. I need some blood.” Dean held his hands to his chest like he was clutching a set of pearls and scowled, but Sam was already reaching out and pricking his own finger, letting the blood well up before squeezing a few drops into the bowl. Stupid, trusting little brother.
Dean?”
“Okay, so we’re probably looking at de-aging, then,” Sam sighed, and Dean could almost picture him rubbing a hand down his face. “Me and Cas will head up there. Probably can’t get there until morning, though. Can he stay with you and the girls, tonight, Jody? We’ll get there as soon as we can.”
Dean waited for the name to mean something to him, maybe knock something loose in his head that he could recognize, but he didn’t know the guy. Nothing sounded or looked remotely familiar about him. He was kind of adorable, though, in an old-man kind of way.
kid! None of it matters, Cas will just wipe him clean before we leave. Calm down, Sam.”
Dean’s silence was thoughtful, either because he was attempting to restructure his world view, or because he was attempting to wrap his head around the fact that he had been friends with a monster, Castiel wasn’t certain. He didn’t look angry, though; that was one step in the right direction. Mary was silent in the front seat, but Castiel could tell she was burning with curiosity. Perhaps the boys had not shared this story with her, yet?
Dean, one hand over his rapidly beating heart, was too distracted to notice the final vampire, who had taken the distraction as an advantage, sneaking up behind Mary. She wrapped inhumanly strong arms around the hunter, cutting off her airflow. Mary struggled, slamming the arm with the machete against the vampire’s legs, but nothing was connecting.
“2004. I was working an easy salt-n-burn. Just finished up when you three fell through my damn closet door.”
Glancing through the menu, Dean let muscle memory take over as he searched out the cheapest option. Castiel tapped the table in front of him with jittery fingers. “Get what you want. No need to worry about funds, yes?”
“It’s a complex spell,” she said sadly, folding her hands over and over again as she fidgeted. “I’m sure I could create a counter curse, but it will take time. I’m sorry, boys. There’s no easy fix for this.”
Castiel didn’t even blink, just handed over a credit card that the waitress used to settle their bill. “What?” Dean hissed under his breath, trying to be quiet and struggling, “are we
Hopefully he wasn’t making a terrible mistake, taking her word, and Sam’s supposed-older self’s word, that everything was on the up and up. He watched her carefully, gripping the knife he had found in one of his pockets. He would be ready for anything.
the book to save dear Jack, so
“So, did you find any likely spots the vampires may be hiding?” Castiel asked, turning towards Mary now that they were both finished eating.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” she said, a little colder than she meant to, but what’s said is said, and she moved on. She wrapped a hand around his shoulder and squeezed in apology, but Sam might as well have been a stone sculpture. She sighed and moved out of the room, gathering a few machetes and a bottle of dean man’s blood on her way towards the garage.
“So. I’m cursed?” He glared at the table and shook his head. “
“Be careful with him, yeah?” he said, sounding exhausted. “Watch out for him. Try not to grill him too hard, okay?”
“What is bothering you the most, Dean?”
“Mom?” he breathed, and
His eyes flew open, probably showing everyone else just how panicked he felt inside. Did he really want to be that person? Did he want to know what put that terror there in the first place?
, you’re like two feet shorter than usual, and I am
Castiel looked confused for a moment, before he shook his head, looking fond and exasperated in equal measures. “Not quite. But one of your friends was able to hack into some kind of offshore account. Set us up with a credit card that never runs out.”
“Yeah, buddy. We’re fine. Should probably move on, anyhow. Hmm?”
“We’re going to try this spell, and it should help ease the restrictions on your grace, if not fully release you. Here’s hoping for the best,” Sam said, throwing a few things into the bowl on the table, and then Rowena began chanting. Jack closed his eyes and waited for
When he turned to look, bright green eyes were staring up at him. Dean, with his freckles and his tan skin and his sandy blond hair. Dean, decidedly
. He had so much to think about.
“Calm down,” Dean growled, and was more than a little proud that that made John falter, gun dropping an inch as he fought the instinct to follow orders in that tone of voice. Dean was already over this whole situation, and it hadn’t even been five minutes, yet. “Take a closer look, Dad. It’s us. Sam and Dean. Your
? Claire just smirked, leaning back against the sofa, spreading out like none of it ruffled her feathers. Dean knew better. He played the same act, all the time. It was exhausting, he knew.
“It’s gonna be okay, kid,” Dean said gently, rubbing Jack’s back. He couldn’t do much more in that moment.
Castiel squeezed his shoulder one more time before pulling away. Dean hated that he felt so cold without the pressure there. Instead of asking the angel to touch him again, because, wow-no, Dean instead spun around and reached into the backseat footwell, grabbing one of the extra blankets they always kept there just in case. He wasted no time wrapping it up tightly around his shoulders, bundling himself in. It was mid-October, Claire had told him, and it was just starting to get colder outside. The pressure was calming him down, and he sighed. Because he was so focused on his breathing and his blanket, he didn’t notice the odd look his brother threw his way, like he had never seen Dean act so strangely before. Dean huffed, puffing out his cheeks before he turned toward the glass window, pressing his forehead against it as he tried to calm his breathing.
. “And that’s you,” she said, pointing at the guy with spiky hair, which, again,
“Thanks again, for letting me crash here tonight, ma’am. I do appreciate it. And you getting ahold of my brother.”
It was time to get some answers.
“I’m fine, buddy,” he lied, looking away and moving back towards the bed, leaving the door open behind him. Castiel hesitated in the doorway for a moment before tentatively following Dean, closing the door gently behind himself. Dean collapsed against the headboard and absently patted the bed beside him. Cas nodded, seating himself beside his friend, clasping his hands between his knees. Their legs stretched out in front of them and Dean smiled, knocking his foot against Castiel’s.
After a few minutes of searching, Castiel peering over his shoulder, Sam let out a sound of relief. Dean huddled closer too, squinting at the book and trying to make heads or tails of the elegant handwriting.
They waited long enough for John to gather up his things, then they all piled into his monster of a truck, Sam up front with John while Dean and Cas squeezed together in the back seat. John thought that was a little weird, but didn’t point it out; he wasn’t blind, he had seen the way the angel and his oldest looked at each other. The way Dean kept touching him, drawing him close, the way the angel allowed it. The guy was apparently a warrior of Heaven, and he was just letting some human man-handle him like it was nothing? No, there was
“Uh, yeah. Sure.” He placed the proper pans on the stove and started cracking eggs, cooking bacon, frying hash browns. The easy repetition and calming familiarity of the task helped calm him down a little, enough to joke, at least.
The waitress made her rounds again, and Castiel ordered something for Mary, while Dean ordered a deluxe burger, with all the toppings and extra fries to go, and watched Cas with wary eyes for his reaction.
“Bullshit!” Dean shrieked, flinching when his voice cracked. He waved his machete at the vampire threateningly. “You brought trouble on yourself when you killed all those people.”
The future couldn’t be all bad, if his Baby was still around. He settled back in the bench seat, one arm propped up on the windowsill, and watched the scenery fly by.
“So, Bobby’s then?” John asked. He wasn’t really looking forward to seeing the man again; last time they hadn’t parted on such great terms, and he didn’t enjoy the thought of a gut full of buckshot.
Sam’s phone started ringing and Dean watched him disinterestedly as he chewed his burger; he had to give it older-him, he could make a
Nodding, Jody began explaining, continuing to study the strange stare-off happening between Dean and Castiel. “Yeah. Somebody called in that they saw lights on in the house. Dean had found a flashlight and was looking for you and Bobby. Said he went to the store, woke up on the sidewalk.”
“Huh,” Dean grumbled. That would suck, he thought, never being able to task food or drinks. He didn’t think he would be able to survive like that.
Sam didn’t look convinced and Dean winced, looking away. Castiel was staring at him, too, like he was trying to read his mind. Dean shivered, moving his gaze to stare at the table instead so he didn’t have to look at anyone else.
. Also,
Castiel hesitated, watching Dean out of the corner of his eye. “It is… complicated,” he eventually said, looking away to stare at his knees instead. “We have been through much together, you and I. We have betrayed each other, hurt each other greatly. But we’ve also cared for each other, as much as we could in the moment. I would not trade these years with you and Sam for another millennium as an angel.”
“Yeah,” Sam said on a sigh, looking lovesick and happy. “She’s a hunter, too. We met on a case, actually, and helped each other out. Now that things are starting to calm down, we’ve decided to really give it a shot.”
“Yeah, I guess. There’s not much else we can do about this here,” Sam said, and
Anxiety was beginning to claw at his throat, his chest, causing his heart to hammer painfully against his ribcage as he searched each room. “Sammy?” he called, desperate. “Bobby?” There was no answer, but honestly, he wasn’t expecting one. “C’mon, guys. This isn’t funny!”
John hummed noncommittedly, not so sure about all of that. It was odd that Dean was being so touchy-feely with another person, too, but he wasn’t going to unpack that now. Instead, he glanced out the window again, scowling when he didn’t see the Impala there.
weird, though, he thought as he got a safe distance away in his truck. He didn’t remember coming to Bobby’s house, or drinking the night away, or even why the hell he was in Sioux Falls to begin with.
didn’t think it was so damn funny…
Hoping for the best, Dean crept up to the doorway and knocked as hard as he could. If this really was 2020, then was Bobby even here anymore? By the looks of the place, he doubted it.
None of that happened, though, because Sam rounded the corner behind him and froze, gaze moving between them, assessing the situation. “Uh. Hi, Mom,” he said dumbly, and Dean turned a watery glare his direction. “You made good time.”
“Of course, he can stay with me,” Jody said, rolling her eyes like it had been a stupid thing to ask. “I’m sure the girls will get a kick out of this.” Sam snorted over the line and Dean glared. What girls? Why would they think this was funny?
) at his little baby brother. Dean barely reached his shoulders, and wasn’t that just a kick in the nuts? Sam moved forward, dwarfing Dean even more, and reached out. He wrapped one massive hand around Dean’s shoulder and brought the other up to cup his face, tilting his chin until their eyes met. “Are you alright?”
Claire’s gaze was intense, to say the least. She looked uncertain, though, and Dean felt for her. If he had ever met a younger version of Bobby, or his dad, he wasn’t sure how he would react. Eventually, she seemed to come to some sort of decision as she reached into a pocket and pulled another sleek device out, waving it in his direction enticingly. “I don’t know if I’m screwing up the space-time continuum or whatever, but want to see some pictures?”
Dean tried to backpedal, squirming in Sam’s hold as gently as he could but he was stuck. “Sam,” he grumbled, hating chick flick moments, “don’t worry about it. I get it. Okay? You want an adult, someone who actually knows what the hell they’re doing, and is
Dean opened his eyes, searching Castiel’s, and sighed contentedly. “Well, ain’t that romantic?” he drawled, smirking dangerously. Cas’s eyes flashed, unspoken challenge accepted, and he reached out, yanking on Dean’s collar until they were inches apart.
“Adorable,” Rowena breathed, clapping her hands together. “Like the angel is his wee little teddy bear.” Mary was smiling, as well, but she looked a little sad, too.
Shaking himself back to reality, Dean smiled softly and plopped down into the chair across from Castiel. “Course not,” he said easily, leaning back and threading his fingers together over his stomach, the picture of lazy contentment. Castiel seemed to take him at his word, giving Dean an uncertain nod before turning back to his book. Dean took the time to just study him in the warm, comfortable silence between them.
“Vampires, I think,” she said, meeting his gaze head on, and smiled weakly. Sam was scowling at the table, anxiously rubbing his fingers on the pages of his tome.
“How are you doing, Dean?” Castiel asked, arms folded against his chest as he watched through the window as Mary interacted with the kid behind the front desk.
“Slaughterhouse Five,” he said proudly, shocking Dean into silence. He blinked slowly up at Castiel, who smiled again, a little brighter this time. “You recommended it, and you reference it frequently. I thought I might finally sit down and read it, to better understand you, and the things you enjoy.”
he had killed the witch, but not before she had finished her spell. Cas hadn’t been with them at the time, thankfully, but Jack had been, and he had doubled over in pain, clutching his chest like he was having a heart attack.
He pounded a fist against his curled-up leg and used his other hand to wipe away the tears from his cheeks. He was being so stupid. Stupid, and ungrateful, and spoiled; like a little brat that didn’t get his way. He should just go out there and face them, apologize for freaking out, and move on like nothing had happened. But he didn’t want to face their heavy gazes, their judging eyes, or pitiful looks. He wasn’t something to be pitied.
Growing up, Sammy had always been the more religious of the two of them. Dean had never spent much brain power on digging too deep into the mystical origins of their world. (
power at my disposal.”
“Are you alright?” the angel asked softly, a little shocked and worried.
Castiel’s smile was sweet, a little bashful, and Dean couldn’t believe the guy was supposed to be an angel. He just seemed like a dorky little guy. “’Heya, Cas,’” he quoted, fingers reaching up to do the little air-quote things. Dean’s heart throbbed at the gesture. “You often say the same thing to me, when you’re older.”
He loaded up a plate, throwing toppings on his burger and settling at the table against the far wall. Sam followed with his own plate, and Castiel settled down across from Dean, plate-less but watching them fondly.
“My best bet would be that Bobby has it,” Dean said, arms folded across his chest, face hard and eyes focused now that they were getting down to business. “We thought the spell would take us to his place, so we could just borrow it, but I guess that blood we used took us to our blood in the here-and-now, instead. I’m going to
Cas nodded, face soft and caring. “I’ll watch over you?”
“I suppose I’ll take your word for it, ya paranoid bastard,” Bobby said, already looking like he regretted saying it. “Get in here, ya idgits, before I change my mind.”
made a lot of food while lost in thought.
. Mom loves us, but she doesn’t really know us. She had a really hard time finding her place here when she first came back. She’s still trying to figure it out, if I’m being honest. She goes off on her own a lot, but she always comes back, and she always tries to be here when we need her. She said she would be here by tonight, probably around the same time Rowena gets here.”
, apparently, made him feel things that no one had ever made him feel before, and that was more than frightening. When Castiel looked at him, he felt bright, weightless, worth something more than whatever his father wanted him to be. Castiel made him feel like more than a second-rate parent for Sam, or a novice hunter, or worse, live bait.
Shaking his head, Sam sighed, but didn’t answer. Castiel took over the conversation, instead. “Rowena MacLeod. She’s a three-hundred year old witch. She’s also the mother of the King of Hell. She’s helped us out on multiple occasions.” Dean whirled around, trying to sniff the bullshit, but Castiel looked as stoic and stone-faced as usual.
She scanned the picture, eyes flying back and forth as she hummed at the information. “This should help,” she finally said, nodding along as she began piling things up on the table. Dean hovered over Jack while they waited. Sam helped her pull together the ingredients. With Castiel’s comforting hand on his shoulder, Jack practically collapsed against his father, burying his face in Castiel’s hip.
“Uh, Dad left us there for the summer, while he was working a few cases out West. It was always nice when he did that, though; we got to stay in one place for a while and Bobby was always awesome.”
“You, well. Younger-you should be back in a few; went out to grab dinner,” John said, turning back to the boys and their scary friend.
not prepared to deal with this, too.
She knew she didn’t have to say anything, even nonverbally ask it of him. Castiel understood, probably better than she did; if anything happened, he would protect Dean first, and she was more than grateful for that.
“I really believe it’s them, Singer,” John said gruffly, glancing between the boys before shaking his head. “Don’t really understand half of what comes out of their mouths, but they seem legit.” Dean snorted at that, and Sam seemed to bristle. Cas just looked indifferent, if a little impatient.
“I think I found a case,” she said eventually, bringing the paper out of her pocket and placing it gently on the table. Silence fell over the room, and she felt it like a fist around her heart. She didn’t know why she kept screwing this up, but it seemed inevitable.
Dean’s face was on fire. No one ever did things to better understand him, let alone
Sam snorted, looking far too amused for the situation, while Castiel reached into the bag, retrieving another piece of pottery. “I believe this is temporary, at least,” he said, squinting at the shards in his hands. “Right here, it says as much.
that?
Maybe Dad was right, and he wasn’t good for anything more than an extra body, backup, waste of space bastard that he was.
Just another Thursday, it seemed.
An ugly sneer snuck across Dean’s face, and he couldn’t hold it back. He shook his head, gritted his teeth, and tried not to let his heart break. He had always known Dad saw him as a disappointment, more soldier than son, only kept around to take care of Sam and take care of Dad, to be his father’s useful little blunt instrument.
“That’s a lot of faith you got there, sister,” Dean said, uncertain about this entire situation. What the hell,
“Sorry,” he said miserably, folding his arms onto the table and hiding his head against them, groaning.
. Ever fought them before?”
Eagerly, watching his every expression, Claire rattled off their names. “That’s your younger brother, Sam,” she said, pointing at the man with the long hair. He rolled his eyes.
“Dude,” she drawled, waving a hand at the angel before shoving him away from Dean. “He doesn’t remember you. Personal space, yeah? You’re making him uncomfortable, scoot over.” Before Castiel could react, Claire squeezed herself in between them. Once there was more room, she moved herself out of Dean’s personal bubble and leaned against the sofa, groaning loudly. “You people are ridiculous,” she grumbled under her breath, rubbing at her eyes.
