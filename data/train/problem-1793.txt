Sherlock broke away to lean his head back into the couch cushions. “For God’s sake, John, you’re going to be the death of me.” He blew his breath out sharply at the ceiling, hips shifting under John’s attentions.
John had to admit that as much as he wanted to do the right thing and ask, this situation served him rather well. When they were both in an amorous mood, Sherlock simply took John in hand, or in his gorgeous, gorgeous mouth like a humble servant on his knees. Sherlock would finish in his own hand, tucking himself away as John lay in the afterglow, and John would be too muddled to care overmuch that he wasn’t really doing his part.
“Whoa, whoa whoa,” the other half replied, leaning back in its chair and throwing its hands up, “Who said anything about love?”
“I don’t need a wheelchair,” Sherlock growled. “I am only a teensy bit,” he swayed on his feet here, and the doctor pulled him back against her. “Lightheaded.”
When they both looked back at Alex, a second longer than was really appropriate to stare at each other in public, he was wearing a tight smile.
John really was picking up a lot from Sherlock. He had to put the effort in, but when he did, he started to see things that came a lot more easily to Sherlock-- but didn’t come to most people at all. The wear of the furniture-- not replaced in a few years, but not secondhand. Middle class. Single child-- no other children in the family pictures, only three coats on the hooks by the door. Both parents working; two pairs of restaurant non-slip shoes by the door, one pair smaller. Latchkey kid-- what else could they be, if both parents worked?
“Mm, wisdom tooth came in, cut off something or other, caused an infection. When they took him in for surgery, he was running 104.”
Sherlock also nodded, seeming a bit hypnotized. John took pity on him, leaned forward, placed a hand on his neck (he was happy to note that the pulse against his palm was racing), and kissed Sherlock full on the lips.
John jumped when a deep voice chuckled from the shadows. “Well, we’re learning all these dances, are we not?”
Maybe John hadn’t gotten up to kiss him goodbye because it was cold and he didn’t want to get out of bed.
“Yes, you,” Mike inclined his head. “You were right back from a warzone, grumpy and frankly, a bit bitchy.”
John and Sherlock got the text and went down to get a cab. John felt the usually adrenaline in his veins for the thrill of a new case, alongside the new addition of nervousness sitting in his gut.
Sherlock didn’t bring him back to the flat after that first night, though, and for that, John was grateful. He felt all clenched up whenever he was near the man. John didn’t have a mind palace, but on his running shitlist he upgraded the Macfucker from “mildly irritating” to “in need of chinning”. The next step would be, “he should’ve been disciplined as a child but the second best time would be now and by myself”.
Sherlock didn’t acknowledge the remark, and John pretended he didn’t wait up in his bed to hear Sherlock come home later that night.
They came back quite quickly. Sherlock, when he had appointments of any sort, seemed to go through the process much faster than most. John suspected it was due to him annoying people into doing their jobs faster.
“Oh, as good as can be expected. Rubbing sniffly noses, assuaging WebMD fears, the usual down at the clinic.”
Knowing how rare it was that Sherlock deigned to eat, John looked up. “Right. What do you want? I could order us some takeaway.”
Sherlock came around the desk as Hargrove quickly pulled up the grading software. Sherlock pulled a sheet of Teddy’s homework and entered a problem. “There. An answer confirmed to be correct by the smartest mathematician in the city, and--” Sherlock dramatically hit enter. A red screen illuminated Sherlock’s pale face.
“Ah, fuck, cold,” John winced as they squeezed water on to him. He hurried out to put on his clothes; brown and blue linen in the sturdy shapes of the working class. He poked at the shutter which was swung inward so the birds could get in. If he had any sense, he’d fix it so he could sleep in until the rooster crowed. But it was probably better to be up before the quartermaster, anyway.
Two months later, John set a cup of tea down at Sherlock’s elbow, and without looking up, Sherlock said, “I’m in love with you.”
“It’s not-- hard to see, even through your suit.” Sherlock took a deep breath and straightened. “I could teach you, you know.”
“Oh I am very serious, doctor.” Sherlock tried to wink, but through the haze of drugs, it came out more like a convulsive blink.
John lay back down. He felt an odd sprig of discomfort at the sound of Sherlock having such a good time with someone else.
Well there you have it folks! Thank you so much for following on this! I am so grateful for your nice comments and kudos!
Sherlock blushed a little heavier now. “Not important. Here’s the picture of you and Wilkney.” He shuffled through the photos for a moment with apparent familiarity before finding the picture. John was standing in front of the sign that said “ROTC recruitment”, smiling at the camera, arms around a taller man in more formal military dress and some other recruits.
John looked up with a proud smile to show Sherlock that he was following along perfectly and met Sherlock’s eyes. The rumors had been true in that way, at least. Sherlock’s eyes were inscrutable in color, changing from blue to gray to green to amber as they turned in and out of the candle light. John felt as mesmerized as if he were looking at a rainbow.
They collectively came to the same conclusion to let the teacher go on believing that they were with law enforcement. “Well, Teddy here thinks there may be a problem with his homework.” Sherlock stated.
Lestrade, on the other end of the line, leaned back in his desk chair, eyes raised. After a brief moment of contemplation, he set his feet up on the desk and agreed. Then he settled into a long discussion of details and backup plans with John, before hanging up the phone and shaking his head at himself. When he’d made Detective Inspector, he’d expected gruesome murders, grizzly detectives, and oodles of paperwork, but he hadn’t prepared himself for all of the hell that went along with Sherlock Holmes and company.
John chuckled, chastising himself for the place his mind had gone. “No. Nobody else can do that but you. You just seem to be spending a lot of time with this Alex fellow, I mean, you’ve taken fewer cases even, and we don’t even--”
So, someone who Alison spent time with, clearly quite close to based on her proximity in the photo. Picture taken through glass, photo hung lower than the others; the parents didn’t like these friends and the friends wouldn’t willingly submit to being photographed.
He didn’t get far into his normal routine-- he had only mucked out one of the stalls, before the quartermaster dragged him away. He had to ride into town, he told John. The king was calling upon every young man in the kingdom. With no more information than that, John rode into town as quickly as he could, desperately hoping they weren’t engaged in some war that was going to get him shot with another arrow.
Lestrade looked down at John, who was rapidly approaching ‘internally screaming’ levels. “Uh, if you ever need to borrow a set of handcuffs, you can?”
“Because you have a fever!” John retorted loudly. Sherlock squinted against the noise. John sighed. “Okay, c’mon, I’m taking you into the clinic.”
Sherlock tilted his head in curiosity. “Is that so? Does he do this often?” Sherlock subtly starting leaning forward until the man unconsciously took a step backward, which gave him the opportunity to step inside.
John leaned back on the sofa, looking up at Sherlock again, who was still sat stiffly on the couch, holding his cup of tea. “Yeah, alright,” John said.
“Alex? Love, I’ve found a case I think I could use you on. Please do come along with us, since you want to see what we do so desperately.” Sherlock grinned into the phone speaker.
John snorted. “Not panic, just… surprise. Not at the heterosexual-- or not heterosexual-- part, just at the date part. I didn’t really peg you for the type who, y’know…”
Sherlock nodded, looking entirely dazed. He turned to look up at John, who had come over to hand him a cup of tea.
Now, however, they were at an impasse. John had experience with men, some, of course. Sherlock presumably did, too, based on how bloody well he handled John through his trousers, but he hadn’t disclosed much of his history.
“I’m not sure,” Sherlock said, pulling his coat in around himself and crossing his arms. “I’ll have to think.”
He started mucking out the stalls as soon as he was down, already so used to the smell that the earthy (read: shitty) scent of the stables did him no harm. He didn’t even hold his breath anymore, as he’d done when he was first sold to the castle by the orphanage. His back hurt from morning to night, cleaning the barn, brushing the horses, reshoeing the horses, feeding and watering the horses, saddling the horses when the members of the family wanted to ride, de-saddling the horses when they were done ten minutes later. Mainly it was the horses that he worked with.
It was still too early for Sherlock to be running around, in John’s opinion, but it was that or suffer another boredom tantrum, so John tagged along when Greg gave them a call.
As they walked up to the set of flats surrounded by caution tape and flashing police cars, John briefly wondered about Sherlock and money. He had it, yes, obviously, but where did it come from? They made tiddlywinks on private cases, and most of their cases were for Lestrade, which were all nonprofit. Actually, he knew that his rent was suspiciously low for inner London, which lent itself to the implication that Sherlock was paying more than half the rent. Where was it coming from? Who was paying for it all? Who got the bill for those bespoke suits that hugged Sherlock’s ass like they never wanted to let go?
Sherlock flipped another page and stopped, tilting his head in confusion. He looked into his own face, he had his hands steepled in front of his face, his eyes closed. The shadows danced across his jaw and cheekbones, giving him a sharper appearance. He found it hard to tell where the shadows stopped, and he began. It was fitting, he supposed, Sherlock lived a life half in the shadows, drifting through life pretending he belonged in a world of light.
After another moment John gave another small sob and lurched to his feet, steadying himself against the wall. He allowed himself a weak moment to whimper at the overwhelming turmoil within him, before squaring his shoulders.
“Are you hungry?” John asked the small girl, trying to fight his own exhaustion. The girl silently shook her head from her place perched on the far side of the couch, her little bottom nearly off the edge and toes still not touching the ground, hands primly folded in her lap. Trying to make herself as small and unobtrusive as possible. “ah… right. Do you… want a bedtime story?” John asked, racking his brain for his own bedtime routines as a little one. He recalled Harry whispering stories into his ear as a small boy when she’d sneak into his bed after an argument with their father that went too far. He was always unsure if she was trying to make him feel better or herself. The girl stared at him hard for a minute before turning to look at Sherlock who was preparing three mugs of bedtime tea. She pointed at the gangly man.
“My eyes?” John asked, feeling unbearably slow, though Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, just bit his lip and nodded. With a doubtful frown John took up the rag and covered his eyes. He couldn’t help the sigh of relief as the cool cloth met his face. His whole body relaxed back into the chair, legs going lax and spread. He wasn’t even feeling self-conscious about his lack of a packer at the moment.
“Hmm,” he hummed, “your room.” John froze, straightening. Sherlock could see how his throat bobbed, swallowing thickly.
And fate wanted him to go to fucking Med school. John Watson, with the alcoholic father, disowned, queer sister quickly falling down the same path, and world weary, frequently abused mother.
“So,” Sherlock finally said, turning back to the crowd, “to honor this, we’ve decided to have our wedding at the places he first defied them. Many years ago, John Watson, a man just returned from military service after being invalidated home, took a stroll through Reagents Park. Unbeknownst to him, a man with a far-reaching gaze felt it prudent to set him on my path without my knowledge and set the wheels in motion for John to bump into an old friend during a stroll through Reagents Park all those years ago.”
He flipped the page, more sketches of him, some of his empty chair, and obviously the sketch John had been working on. It was incredible, especially considering the lack of tools at John’s disposal, the image was almost photo realistic. As if the bits of graphite would begin to slide across the page, shadows expanding and growing with the setting sun. The image depicted Sherlock stretched out on the couch, thinking. The drawing took up the whole page, surely it had taken John hours to capture Sherlock and the background of 221B so faithfully.
” rang out and John took that as his cue. He swiftly stood, revealing himself and taking up his place behind Sherlock with his gun leveled at the leader of the cult, a man who headed the history department at
“Oh,” Sherlock said simply, after a moment he let out a large sigh of revelation, like pieces were falling into place, “but… why didn’t you say anything sooner?” John shrugged weakly.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and laid a kiss on John’s check before pulling the soldier close. They both fell asleep that night with questions of “
John found himself smiling like a fool as Sherlock showered in the next room. As he took the two chocolates he had purchased that morning from his coat pocket and situated them on a small tea saucer, John found himself humming one of the songs they had danced to.
They whispered words of love into each other’s skin, primal sounds of desire and adoration filling the spaces in between. John clung to Sherlock and Sherlock to John. Sherlock pressed his thumb into the gaping wound on Johns' wrist, causing both men to gasp in delight every few minutes.
He’d never seen such a tidy child. Even as a little one, even in his tumultuous home, John still left dolls and toy cars laying about, coloring books and crayons on the coffee table and half-filled milk glasses on the counter. Her almost robotic movements, silence, and nearly neurotic tidiness was unsettling and heart breaking at once. She should have been asking a thousand questions, gaping at the books and beakers, trying to grab the skull on the mantel and touching Sherlock’s violin. Not staring at him with the most somber face he’d ever seen on a child outside the battlefield.
His shoulder screamed in agony; his wrist twinged in pain. Oh fuck, Christ, he needed to come. Sherlock hummed in acknowledgment, lifting his head to eye John. John moaned at the sight, Sherlock’s own spend on his lips and chin, Johns’ slick wetting his lips, and fuck, Johns’ blood stained his mouth. Sherlock analyzed him for a moment before slowly lowering his mouth, finally, fucking
So, for that, I must thank John. I did not see myself as a man with friends, with companionship or human connections. I thought myself above all that, but like many things in my life, Johns' mere presence has proven me wrong. It’s something he has a knack for, taking my expectations and turning them on their head,” the crowd chuckled, and Sherlock gave John a bright smile. John flushed and grinned back at his husband.
bring him back Mycroft, Moriarty used him once. Others will do it again. Besides, I hurt him. He’s been gone three days, he wouldn’t even want-“
They deserved this. They all deserved to be happy and have a family, they deserved it more than most, if John was honest. He looked at Rosie and couldn’t imagine ever being like his father, couldn’t imagine ever looking at her with anything but an overwhelming and awesome love. He’d do anything to protect this home he’d made, to protect these people who deserved his devotion. He made this for himself, he pulled himself out of blood and bone, he learned to be love and loved, he deserved this, and he would continue to put in the work every day to deserve Rosie and Sherlock’s love. To be the man they needed. Protector, provider, supporter, father, and husband.
John took a look out the glass wall that separated Greg’s office from the bullpen. A little girl sat on a bench, thoroughly unimpressed at whatever Donovan was saying to her. She had pale skin, probably from being locked inside all her life, dark golden hair that fell in ringlets around thin shoulders, and wide, intelligent, sad blue eyes. The girl flicked her world-weary gaze up and made eye contact with John. John could almost feel the misery in her bones.
After a tense few moments the Professor spat something in French at one of the women, she was one of the ones who had her palm slit open in the blood rite, the crimson liquid now staining her white linen robe and fair skin. With a glare that could only be described as murderous, she moved towards the captive and none too gently ripped the bag off the girl’s head. The girl cried out in pain, her head jerking in a way that told John a chunk of her hair had probably been removed along with the bag. She was young, perhaps of legal age, perhaps not, with fair skin and wide brown eyes which watered with tears. She looked around herself in fear, before casting her eyes on John and Sherlock with something like hope. John gave her what he hoped was a reassuring smile.
“Did… did you have a nightmare?” John asked quietly, invading Sherlock’s space. After a moment Sherlock looked down, his lip wobbling as he nodded shyly. Tears started up again in his stormy eyes, John only caught a glimpse before Sherlock folded into the older man. A head of righteous curls tickled John’s nose as Sherlock’s face tucked into the soldier’s neck.
“No, you don’t.” he murmured. John relaxed in margins, toes uncurling, thighs unclenching, finally, his hands going lax in Sherlock's grip, allowing the younger man to gently pin him to the bed.
“And you damn near gave Phillips a heart attack when you told everyone his Da’ was a drunk son of a bitch. Not that he didn’t deserve it, mind. He’s a right cock, nice to know who made him that way.”
She seemed so small. Too many bones. A baby bird all hollowed out, not yet able to fly, not even able to chirp. She looked at John with her intense doe eyes for a long moment before her tiny hand squeezed his and she snuggled down. His gun callused palm dwarfed her tiny grasp, some long forgotten and abandoned part of him ached as he tucked the blanket around her and took back up his place opposite Sherlock. Sherlock had paused, looking at him in wonder, for what he didn’t know.
“Is it… are they here?” the boy asked breathlessly, flashing his eyes around for a new person. Perhaps a new classmate or teacher, or even the two girls at the booths. After a moment, fighting for air, John shook his head, motioning for the boys to go on without him. Riley, the one who had recognized the signs of a string pull in John, began tugging the others along, nodding to John in solidarity and understanding. John didn’t nod back.
“Would that be so bad?” Greg quipped. The Detective Inspector blinked suddenly, shocked at himself, had he really just flirted with
Damn the older man, but he was right, he had been right all along. Sherlock had ignored him once, and what had it left him with? A drug addiction, a dead lover, and a handful of wilting flowers stained with his tears.
a great asset to the Work,” Sherlock gave a wry chuckle before closing his eyes and shaking his head, “I only said that to hurt you.” He said quietly.
. Clear as day, painted across you in neon colors. Like a bloody sign on your back. It’s obvious to anyone with working eyes.” Greg eyed him for a minute, but when the boy zoned out, seeming to forget the DS, Greg grudgingly left.
“Good, good. Mycroft’s over at the flat. They’re looking at swatches. It’s been nothing but wedding planning for weeks.” John groaned as he sat at the second chair, waving over a waitress and ordering the same meal as Greg. Greg gave him a sympathetic look as the waitress swiftly retreated behind the counter.
“It’s nothing,” John started. Sherlock raised one eyebrow again, highly unimpressed, “look I just… Don’t take this the wrong way but… I don’t care.” John finally huffed out.
The trio worked in a silence only John seemed to feel. Sherlock, in a surprising show of tact, didn’t ask the girl questions about her captors. Instead, he made a pot of tea and dropped a blanket and pillow on the couch.
to be. You arsehole, I can’t… I’m leaving.” John forced himself out the door, probably fearing he’d raise a fist if he stayed any longer. He slammed the front door a moment later.
The notebook itself was old, blood and dirt painting the earlier pages. It was filled with sketches, rough lines and shadows tossed onto the pages in a haste. Broken bodies, somber young men in uniform with guns strapped across their backs, dismembered limbs, bloodied local civilians in Arab dress with darkened skin, multiples of a man with piercing eyes and a gruff smile. He was half nude in some. The only ray of light in an array of terrors.
A week later he returned, the lad had showered this time, the hair Greg originally thought to be black was actually a dark, dark auburn with a touch of red. Sherlock helped Greg catch a man who had murdered his brother-in-law because he was in love with his own sister. Greg never would have caught that. But
smaller. Just… suits and our closest friends and the officiant, you know? I mean, I don’t give a rats arse if my great Aunt Janine is there. All I care about is if
“Well-“ John cut himself off, his voice a little high pitched from the crying. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Well,
Sherlock shrugged, “Related memories, mostly. I would find myself organizing new information or reviewing old information. It’s… set up like rooms and halls in my mind. Occasionally I would be perusing a room and find something of theirs under a metaphorical shelf, hidden behind other memories, combined with information that related to them.”
“I feel ya, mate.” Greg sighed and shook his head, “the wedding planning is a right horror show, it is. I
John swiftly turned and walked away, no, he wasn’t doing it. He didn’t want that. He didn’t want to see that kind of violence. (
They had taken up cases again, but now only John got the end say. He hated having that responsibility. Truthfully, he couldn’t tell which of the safe cases would annoy Sherlock and which were going to engage his attention. Though, to be fair to himself, he felt he was getting better at it. The light cases and wedding planning had been enough to keep Sherlock from being a danger to himself or shooting up the wall, so John counted the whole affair as a win.
“Not what?” he asked, belatedly realizing his hand was still on the man’s arm and removing it while trying not to flush.
Even as he watched all the survivors being shuffled out into the sunlight for the first time in who knows how long, four ambulances looking people over and beginning to transport them, this didn’t feel like a win. He felt hollowed out. This had only been the tip of the iceberg. They didn’t have the people who ran the illicit site, they didn’t have all the users, and there was a stack of receipts inside, humans being bought and sold like cattle. Maybe some of those smaller kids went to unsuspecting parents on black market adoptions, but it was unlikely, and those numbers were slim. These people had been at it for years, at least a decade. There was no telling how many they were too late to save.
“You’re 3 and a half minutes past usual, what happened?” Sherlock snapped. John just rolled his eyes, which elicited a small smile from Rose, before standing and approaching the adults in the room. Greg huffed in annoyance.
good, actually. His eyes seemed a little brighter, his skin a little tanner, he stood a touch taller as he tugged on his matching tie. He liked himself like this, if he was honest. He smiled at himself a little in the mirror, running a hand through his carefully combed hair one more time. Sherlock liked it longer like this, John knew. Some days he couldn’t get Sherlock's hands out his hair for anything less than threatening to botch an experiment. And Sherlock had taken to holding John in place by the greying strands in their bedroom. Something John was in no way inclined to argue.
Finally, Sherlock found his way between Johns' thighs. “Lift your legs.” He commanded, gentle and firm all at once. His commands came with no threat, no consequences. John was free to obey if and how he so chose. Free to put a stop to all of this, as gentle as it was, at any moment. And for this reason, John lifted and parted his thighs, baring himself to Sherlock's gaze and touch.
“Well, seeing as you seem to know my whole life’s story-“ Greg snarked. The boy groaned and rolled his eyes.
a window. And walls. It all felt wrong. John sobbed again, the room felt tight, small, but also impossibly big. And he was but a minuscule man, watching the door from a thousand miles away.
” John, who had been trying to remember how to close his mouth while gaping at his fiancé, let out a surprised bark of laughter.
“I’m not… particularly attached to the Watson name. Watson's tend to die drunk, and young, and alone. I don’t plan on doing that.” John confessed, leaning into Sherlock. Sherlock searched his face for a moment before breaking into a wide grin.
That morning, a few hours before the detective left, Mycroft Holmes had stormed into his living room without so much as a how do you do, taken up a seat at John’s chair and glared at his brother.
John continued untying her and shushing her gently as Sherlock kept an eye out for any cult members attempting to escape. As soon as the girl’s hands were free, she threw her arms around Johns' neck, babbling in French as she sobbed. John awkwardly patted her back as Sherlock frowned at them. Wither it was from annoyance at the girls blubbering or at John for allowing it, the soldier couldn’t tell.
The group was buying children through the dark web from others, independent contractors, who had in turn bought the children from desperate, or just plain evil parents or family members. Older children, the teens, claimed they’d been obstinate at home, or sold to cover debts. They were beaten and bowed, trembling. Only one girl was abducted rather than sold by her family, a sixteen-year-old American girl who had been visiting family in Ukraine over the summer and gotten snatched at a festival after being separated from her cousins. The network had been using the docks to smuggle people into the UK through containers, where they would deliver them to buyers, before again moving the operation to another country. It was sheer luck they caught the group before they moved once more.
“You’ve wanted it for a while. I just didn’t really think about it, and I think you didn’t either.” Sherlock shrugged. John groaned, laying his head on Sherlock’s chest, and shaking his head.
“And yours?” John asked, nodding to the flowers pinned into Sherlock's lapel. Sherlock took John’s own far rougher hand in his own, bringing it up until John gently began to trace his fingers over the flowers. So light, so soft, like whispering his hands over a baby’s eyelids, precious and fragile.
A few hours later they found themselves at the top of the Eiffel Tower, John peering through binoculars out at the people below them.
“I know what your doing, kid.” Greg said, leaning against the cell casually. Sherlock’s brow pinched in frustration.
John gasped, he felt his whole body relaxing, so unlike that night. It burned a little, the stretch a delight instead of a torment, the friction heavenly instead of cruel. His wrist dripped warm blood down his forearm as Sherlock bottomed out. The blood smeared across Sherlock's pale back, catching in the man’s own scars as it smeared across his skin. John wrapped his legs around Sherlock, arching into the man.
Four months later, just after New Year’s, Sherlock came home from a day of watching Harvey. Mycroft and Gavin (
“I’ll be there in 20 minutes.” Greg snapped the phone shut, bribing the cabbie to break every speed limit on the way. (
The nearly invisible line was cut along both sides, the very skin removed instead of the scar simply being open back up as Sherlock had done with the other smaller scars. John hissed in pain but held still, staring at Sherlock the whole time. When all was done Sherlock set the scalpel and the stripe of removed flesh to the side, cradling John’s hand to his chest, smearing his white button-down with John’s blood.
And his hands. A soldier’s hands, a healer’s hands, a lover’s hands. How softly they touched Sherlock, even when the detective knew he didn’t deserve it. Stitching Sherlock together with care, carrying out acts of violence in his name.
“He doesn’t have a housekeeper,” Lestrade called after Sherlock who was already starting toward the stairs.
John, in his reminiscence in future years, would wish that their first time together wasn’t frantically humping each other on the sofa like randy teenagers. He really did wish he’d taken just a few moments more to consider, to take Sherlock out for dinner, and have wine together, and laugh with each other before rubbing off together on the sofa like randy teenagers. But really, who could blame him? He’d had a whole two months of awareness of Sherlock’s sexual identity and a subsequent two months of torturous sitting it out while the Macfucker sodomized his true love.
John nodded, smiling hopefully at the nurse. “That sounds like a good idea, actually. There’s that new rom-com I’ve been thinking about seeing. Thank you, that really helps.”
“The milk!” Sherlock said loudly. John and Lestrade snapped to look at him. He blinked in surprise, as if the deduction took him unawares. “Uh, the milk. The poison is in the milk. Arrest the housekeeper.”
“So I can trust you to keep my relationship and the details thereof in confidence.” Sherlock didn’t phrase it as a question, but stated it with some trepidation.
Sherlock whipped his head up to glare at mister Hargrove, who gulped like a cartoon. John smiled tightly and braced himself.
“You will eventually. You’re already getting tired of body parts in the sink and yelling at clients and playing the violin while you’re sleeping.”
John pointed at the photograph, silent so that they wouldn’t interfere with the police and parents next door. Sherlock took it off the wall and studied it for a moment.
“They’ll test the milk, find it’s not poisoned, and by that point the coroner will come back with the results that say natural death.”
John opened his mouth, only to be silenced by Mike’s aloft hand. “Don’t argue, you snapped at me quite enough in a five minute conversation for me to have irrefutable proof. You needed a man who could one, put you in your place by out-bitching you, and two, give you an exciting return to action. Who did a know that could do that? Why, the big posh bastard in the floppy coat who I happened to know had a distinct taste for military men.”
“Fucking stupid dances,” John muttered to himself, unconciously smoothing a hand down his suit jacket just to feel the rich fabric under his calloused fingers. “What are these rich bastards doing all day that they have time to learn all of that shit?”
It only took a week, seven days of which Sherlock complained nonstop about the pain in his head, the boredom of waiting for a case, or every single meal or drink that John brought to him, for Sherlock to recover.
John was about to walk up to his bedroom when Sherlock stopped him with a gentle hand on his elbow. John had already taken one step up, making them at almost the same height. They were close again, and John was right, he could feel Sherlock’s breath on his face. It smelled like tea.
Sherlock retrieved the food and brought forks. John had already scooted up in bed, dragged at his face with his pajama sleeves. He smelled of their warm bed and cold sweat.
Another aborted moan, not one that sounded like Sherlock. Not that John knew what Sherlock’s sex moans sounded like-- pain moans, yes, but how different could they be?
“Alright,” John said raspily. He stood up, taking Sherlock’s hand and bringing him up, too. “Come to bed with me.”
John felt a bolt of discomfort through his stomach at Sherlock squeezing his arm. He was starting to feel guilty, like he wasn’t supposed to see Sherlock when he was so clearly not in control of his facilities. “Okay, Sherlock, stop it now, you have no idea what you’re saying.”
John heard Anderson tell him that he was cheating on his wife, but he still got a dull kind of satisfaction from Sherlock repeating it. It was like Sherlock was figuring out the things that John was just being told.
John leaned over the mountain of trash around the desk, mostly food wrappers and empty soda bottles, but also-- John noted with disgust-- crumpled tissues. He pulled a glove out of his pocket that he’d nicked from the scene, and clicked the computer mouse in front of the frankly monstrously large desktop. The screen lit up immediately, displaying all of the windows that had been open recently.
It said a lot about how John’s life normally went that he was alarmed to come home and hear the sounds of laughter and conversation from upstairs.
He’d told all of them what he considered the truth, preached to them, charmed and manipulated them into following his plan and killing themselves to avoid being taken by these pretend monsters. And all of them had listened, had drank the poison-- except for Alison. Alison was his first follower, a friend from his past, the woman who was by his side every step of the way.
Sherlock’s shoulders fell when he saw that the comforters were still in the same shape, bent like a broken bridge over John laying on his side.
John looked up to see Sherlock’s response to that, and was shocked to see a barely tamped down smirk on his face. They made eye contact.
He was starting to feel the effects of not eating around four, after he’d run back and forth along the Thames checking the drying development on his skin samples. He’d been dashing to each one, trying to get precise measurements for the rate at which they cracked in the sun, and after an hour had to lean against the tide wall from dizziness.
Or at least, John didn’t believe a word of it until he was putting away the step stools that rich people used to get in their carriage since stepping on a servant’s back was just an inch too far and watched the servant girl chasing after the retreating carriage. He watched her collapse dramatically on the bench of the fountain and sob loudly.
John shrugged, realizing how silly he sounded. Just because he hadn’t seen Sherlock going on dates doesn’t mean he didn’t.
John just gives a tight smile and hopes that she doesn’t pee while they’re sharing a plastic bus bench.
“You have to take at least one of them. C’mon, this woman says she’s being stalked, we have to help her.”
Sherlock smiled broader, like that was exactly what he’d been hoping John would ask. “The stance, feet wide, used to standing for long hours-- your hands are visibly calloused, the spots indicative of using a wooden dowel, could be a broom but your arms are muscled enough that--”
“You can’t deduce things, only people, John. But yes, I deduce what people want based on the actions in the market and place my investment with them.”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock said, voice cracking. He carefully leaned against the pillows so he could bring John’s head into his chest.
“Jesus,” John said. There were spray-painted messages on the wall, letters about the length of an arm, that spewed various threatening messages.
John puttered around in mild anxiety for two days, making tea and setting it by Sherlock, making toast and setting it by Sherlock (which was definitely acknowledged, since Sherlock ate the crusts off both pieces and left only the buttery middle bits, the absolute child), and making himself presentable and sitting by Sherlock.
John was so close to bursting into laughter, heat rising in his neck. “Sherlock, we live together. You come home with me every day.”
Sherlock froze, eyes going into a deductive squint as he roved down John’s chest to rest on the dog tags. He pulled his gaze back up to John’s eyes. “You were in there for forty-five minutes. I was worried you had drowned.”
Sherlock looked at knees at the edge of the bathroom counter. A man came in, peed, and walked out the door without coming anywhere near the sinks. Sherlock wrinkled his nose at the closing door before turning back to John. “I broke up with Alex.”
“That’s where you write your name.” “The first problem you solve.” Teddy and the teacher responded at the same time.
John looked at Sherlock in surprise. “Uh, it’s probably just going to be me and Mike and a few mates getting pissed. In a pub.”
“I’m not being manipulated by Alex.” Sherlock was upright now, staring at John, who was keeping his eyes ahead.
“Yes, we must investigate the earring case before the close of business, remember? Farewell, Alexander.”
“But you’re not interested in the girls, are you, doctor?” Sherlock said. John’s head snapped up, and Sherlock, after another look with the gears-turning face, amended, “Or not only in the girls, I think.”
“Well I was the only other person there, John, surely your deductive skills can achieve that answer.”
John and the debaters all looked down at his naked body in the shower. He ran a soapy hand over a belly that was softening as he approached middle age. He looked at his ugly hobbit feet. He brought a hand up to touch the ragged, ramshackle scar tissue in his shoulder. Finally, he poured some shampoo in his hand and scrubbed it through his wiry, greying hair.
It looked like part of the ballroom was dedicated to dancing, and part of the ballroom had an elevated section, with a few steps up to it. The elevated section held four chairs, and even from across the room and the press of bodies, John could tell what they were. A large throne for the king, accompanied by a smaller companion for the queen, and two chairs flanking them for each prince.
“Of course not, I still had a trust fund, my parents are rich as kings,” Sherlock replied neutrally. “I just make some money of my own, as well. And Mycroft helps, though I deny that help where I can.”
John dropped his satchel by the door, shrugged off his jacket directly onto the floor, Boots bag disappearing underneath it, and walked toward the couch.
“Oh, I don’t know about that. You look quite fit to me.” Lestrade and John both glanced over at Sherlock, who was now on his back, head under the springs of the chair.
John pressed wet kisses along the underside of his shaft and balls before wiping his mouth and moving up to kneel on the couch with one knee, caging Sherlock in with his body.
He was about to, hopefully, fool the most observant man in England and possibly the world. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was looking over maps on his phone.
John giggled. He turned back around to Sherlock and took his hand. Sherlock artfully arranged their arms so that neither of them were leading or following. Just dancing, together. Sherlock hummed along with the waltz coming muffled through the ballroom walls.
For the first time in years, he had a smile on his face when he got out of bed. Maybe the woman in the robe had been right. Maybe he did deserve a night like that, just once, to make up for all the other days of his life.
Sherlock blew out a sharp breath. “Well isn’t that what people do when they’re dating? Go on dates?”
He went to work and got spit, snot, vomit, and piss on his clothes from a variety of ill and ill-mannered patients. He misfiled a report and had to be called before his supervisor to clarify that no, he had not treated someone in the future, that he’d simply made a typo when putting in the date. He had to put off a patient for two hours for a conference call with the NHS operator, which was confusing and unhelpful on every level, and only left him with an irate mother of a screaming toddler. A woman refused to get her flu shot because she said it hurt her more to get a needle than it would hurt to get the flu.
And that’s how, a few moments and a few miracles later, John was wearing a deep blue suit that nicely accentuated his arms toned from years of manual labor and brought out his eyes and riding a horse (he didn’t see any need for a carriage when it was just himself) toward the castle.
John snorted, leaning over the other corner of the table with his fists on the wood. “I thought you’d deleted the solar system.”
He opened the door to 221B, and found the dishes still sitting on the living room table, and his tea mug with two bags still full and undrank from when he’d abandoned it when he realized there was no honey. Fuck, he’d forgotten to buy honey.
John paused in soaping up his loofah. Well, that all sounded rather like things he did with Sherlock already. The only thing missing was physical contact, really.
After a solid ten seconds of his brain being entirely offline, John managed to take a sip of tea, and his little crank man starting going at double speed with the influx of information. Alex wore a condom, that meant Sherlock was likely on the receiving end. Sherlock on his back, long legs curved around his waist, Sherlock on top, lacing his finger’s with Johns, head thrown back in ecstasy as he rode John--
Sherlock groaned, but John recognized it as less a groan from pain and more from having to listen to pleasantries. “So what’s the problem with princess?”
John blinked and raised his eyebrows down at the table. Shouldn’t even be thinking about Sherlock in bed, anyway. But really, who could be blamed when the word “condom” just casually dropped out of Sherlock’s incredibly posh, plush lips?
They walked down the street a few blocks, John huffing to keep up with Sherlock stomping at the speed of stroppiness. “So what was that about?”
Sherlock reclined back on the bed, clearly dizzy, now addressed his harassment to the ceiling. “Not the only thing I learned.”
John smiled at Sherlock’s defense. “Oh I’m sorry. Been going on a few dates with this professor Cameron, then, haven’t you?”
That’s stupid, he thought. Why should I be upset? Sherlock’s having fun. The discomfort didn’t appease.
John took his hand, smiling already. Something about being in his mere proximity made him feel giddy. He could see why all the women of the kingdom lined up to make his aquaintance. He shook his head, processing what he’d heard. “How did you know I’m a stable hand?”
“Nothing hurts, idiot, you’re a metaphor for human thought. Now let's get on with the question at hand.”
John paused from where he’d been cutting the crusts off of his sandwich. He had realized that Sherlock really only ate the crusts of toasts, so when he made a sandwich for himself, he cut off his least favorite part and gave them to Sherlock.
John snorted, causing Sherlock and Wilkney to look over at him. He shook his head to dismiss the thought.
They both stared at John for a moment. The man that was sitting in John’s chair was in his late forties, but fit and well groomed. His brown hair was cut a little longer than the standard side-part, greying tastefully at the sides, and he wore it well. He had soft brown eyes, and a sharp jawline.
They walked in, following Lestrade to the area where all the bodies were scattered. They were arranged as if they’d fallen gracefully, but there was vomit and urine around them that said nothing about their deaths had been peaceful. There were maybe fifteen people, all told.
“It was when I’d just joined up, he was my ROTC trainer at the college. I guess he’s moved on to a bigger university now.”
“That’s kind of you, but I’m not what I used to be. Should’ve seen me back when I was on active duty!”
“Mmm, okay. We have a woman whose earrings have gone missing every evening and reappeared on her sink the next morning every night for--”
John shook his head. “Now wait just a second. You’re going to change your whole personality around just for-- this man?”
“So you are gay, then?” John asked, realizing a moment later that now was not a good time to satisfy his curiosity.
He could smell the smoke over the smell of the hundreds bodies sweating in silk. It was remarkably similar to the stables when the quartermaster burned the rotting hay-- sweat, smoke, and earth. John took a deep breath, and made the conscious decision to let himself enjoy the next few hours, future be damned.
John shook his head as Sherlock jumped off the sink, taking another step forward to stick his landing. “No, let’s go home. I’m tired of hearing Bill talk about that one charity game he did, anyway.”
Sherlock walked away. John walked up to his bedroom, shut the door, and let out a breath. His tummy relaxed back into the natural paunch.
All the same, when I servant, only a few years younger than John, came to take the reins of his horse, John reached in his waistcoat pocket. A generous few gold coins magically filled his hand, and he happily handed it to the horse boy. He smiled with genuine happiness, and the anger burning in John’s throat dissipated.
John was stunned speechless. He stared at Sherlock with his mouth open. Again, trying to smirk through wads of cotton, Sherlock removed his hand and pressed his wrists together between them. “Well then, lock me up. I don’t think I’d mind it this time if you put me in the cuffs.”
“It wasn’t murder, he had an aneurysm. Or heart attack in his sleep. Or a-- I don't know, some other normal thing.”
John glanced up from the computer at Sherlock stomping about in his dressing gown and pajama bottoms.
Strings, John Watson decides on a cool autumn day as he’s limping along the path in Reagents Park, trying to pretend his whole life hasn’t crumbled under his feet, are fickle, vicious things. They’re only purpose is for fate to have one giant, cosmic laugh at the petty humans wandering aimlessly around the earth. John Watson is sure of this, down to his bones. For, his life has been nothing but one giant shite show after another thanks to the damned red string attached to his chest…
Many of you may remember me before John, brash, cold, a man with a knack for keeping everyone at arm’s length. Since John was introduced into my life, however, things have changed significantly. I’ve now come to call you friends, rather than a group who may simply tolerate me.”
for!” Sherlock said fiercely, when he looked at John, though, the fight drained out of him. John was crying, his face drawn and tight. Sherlock shook his head, running his hand through his own hair. “It tells me you love me.” Sherlock amended. There was silence for a long moment.
“No!” he cried in desperation, tugging Sherlock down insistently. Sherlock hesitated for a moment. They had never done this, Sherlock always took the time to stretch John, to ensure he was wet enough, to make sure that John never felt a moment of discomfort. But John didn’t want that today. He wanted Sherlock in him, nothing, not even artificial lubrication between them. Sherlock hesitated but whispered a quiet “
“Y-you remember all of it, don’t you? Siberia, I mean.” John whispered back, protected by the darkness of the night and cocooned from dead men's hands by his lover and the comfort of their bed.
” with John. John had snarled in annoyance and accidentally cut himself. When he swirled around to give the imaginary Sherlock a piece of his mind and a nice long rant about
Greg and Donovan arrived a few minutes later to John and the little girl playing a game of Operation on the living room floor (Rose was surprisingly good), and Sherlock pacing with his long legs, stopping occasionally to eye the map of London tapped up on the wall over the couch.
Sherlock smirked at him knowingly and stepped forward, presenting John with a small handful of flowers. A small bundle of pure white flowers with what looked to be a sprig of lavender in the center. Sherlock stepped forward and pinned it onto his lapel with gentle hands.
Sherlock helped Greg find the evidence to close his current case and pointed him the right direction to close 3 cold ones, all in the span of an hour. Greg was beyond
“Because this isn’t… children are loud and messy and take over your lives. There’s schooling and childcare, and sick days and nightmares and gum in their hair and football games and ballet classes and college and break ups and huge screaming rows and-… and a million other things. It’s not always letting a child pass out on the couch after a cup of tea and a short bedtime story. There’s… things to think about.”
.” Sherlock sniped, sneering at the man. He didn’t look at John, his resolve would snap if it did. John didn’t say anything, just turned and went back into Sherlock's room. A moment later he came out, frantic and angry.
With frantic hands, John Watson turned page after page in his story book, until he landed on a story about a witch doctor who saved a village from destruction. Confused, he watched as the string at his chest slowly split, until one red tendril reached out to the little army men, and one reached out to the story book in his lap. After a moment, John understood.
They returned late, though it was relatively early for them. Sherlock immediately kissed John upon the lips and departed for a quick shower. “
“I can’t fix those things tonight, my love. But perhaps in the morning. Perhaps… perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I was hasty. Truth is… I don’t know. It felt right sitting there, like… like a complete family. Not that you and I aren’t complete alone, just… do you understand?” John nodded.
It was… fitting, in a way. They each had a role, a give and take, neither had power over the other, where one found himself lacking, the other found himself in abundance. It was just a dance, it was just dancing positions, it didn’t really mean anything, not to anyone else. But to John it did. To John it felt meaningful, the way they swayed together, the way they danced in close comfort.
Graduation came quickly. He felt, he must admit, an overwhelming pride at himself. He couldn’t wait to start working, trauma surgery suited him like nothing else. He wondered, almost giddily as he strolled the London streets, if perhaps this job was his tied. Who needed a person when he could have this, all day, everyday until his eyesight faded into nothing and his hands went stiff from age? John
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man murmured, lifting a hand, pressing warm fingers into John's chest, where his string connected. Distantly, John heard Mike gasp quietly.
“Is this…” he started, listening for another moment. “Did you compose this for us?” he finally finished. Sherlock looked pleasantly surprised for a moment before a slow pleased grin grew on his face.
Sherlock paced the floor in eagerness as John helped dress the girl and comb out her long hair. She smiled at him sweetly when he finished, dark blue eyes looking into his soul. He thought, again, about parenthood. He hadn’t contemplated it seriously in many years. But he was right, last night when he talked so long his throat went dry, ranting at Sherlock. He could barely care for himself some days, how could he ever care for something as precious and delicate as a child?
The bleeding woman sneered at John as she forced the young girl to her feet. The girl was shoved none too gently in his direction and with his right hand, he tugged her behind him. Sherlock again said something in French and all the cult members sullenly stood against the wall opposite John and Sherlock. The woman who had been holding the ancient dagger threw it at Sherlock’s feet with disgust before joining her comrades.
. With you, I am heard. I am a man who is loved and much more than tolerated. Without you, I am cold, cut off from the world.” John swallowed thickly, blinking quickly. Sherlock smiled at him with unyielding affection and dragged John's fingers over the sprig of bluebells. “Bluebells,
, you mad man, let’s go. I’ll cover you.” Sherlock looked to him with a fondness and warmth that was so out of place John couldn’t help but replicate it.
“So that’s it?” John asked, flabbergasted, “We’ve only just met and we’re going to look at a flat?” the man meaningfully looked at John's chest and lifted a challenging eyebrow which made John flush.
, the smell of their life together. Their love, their own personal heaven. John gave a half-laugh, half gasp in delight as they writhed by the fire.
“Thought you might like a sweetie.” He said. Sherlock raised an eyebrow in surprise, but his gaze softened as he dropped the towels carelessly, crawling up the enormous bed, half in John’s lap.
“We do.” John said, wrapping an arm around his husband’s waist and watching as Rosie opened up the toy chest under the window and removed the set of zoo animals before flying a bird through the air and making a quiet “
“Look, I don’t know him much, and I don’t know you, but I know the kids got a great mind. I imagine it’s bursting at the seams, yea? Not enough space in his head to keep it contained, it’s hard to keep people like that on the straight and narrow. But tell ‘im… tell him as long as he manages it, he’s got a place here. Sod the rules, I’ll find a way around it.” Mycroft looked dumb struck.
“Oh god, fuck, Sherl, Sherl, come on, babe,” John breathlessly tugged the man away by his hair, causing Sherlock to whine. “I just cleaned so we could do this,” John said finally, blinking and breathing hard. They both sat for a moment, getting ahold of themselves.
“You realize her attackers were probably all men?” Sherlock pointed out in a last-ditch effort. John squared his shoulders.
“But,” John continued, “if I’m yours, that means you’re mine. From the curls on your head to the tips in your toes, you’re mine Sherlock Watson-Holmes. That ring on your finger means we belong to each other. Until we die, and probably after, if there’s anything next. Come hell or high water, we’re stuck together. We’re inseparable, you know that, right love? To disentangle one from the other would be to kill us both.”
and most importantly he knew how to care for Sherlock on the bad ones. This, John supposed as he slipped into his coat, is just how two people perfectly suited for each other worked. They knew each other inside and out; they knew what the other person was thinking or wanting or needing before the other person even had to voice such desires.
“Get up, Watson.” He hissed to himself, overcome with utter rage and frustration. He’d been living with Sherlock for almost three bloody months now, this wasn’t
As the food concluded Sherlock stood, to John’s confusion. He gave John a crooked smile, nervous but joyful, before turning to address their small crowd.
John ignored him the best he could. But when it was time for bed the Shade lay down on top of the comforter, facing John as he hovered just a hair above the bed, not really touching solid ground. John just stared at him for a moment.
.” Sherlock sighed, dragging John back to the bedroom. Suddenly something clicked in Johns' head and his face turned into one of disbelief and annoyance as his feet dug into the carpet.
“Uh, no, haven’t gotten to it,” Lestrade said distractedly, writing down the deductions Sherlock spewed at rapid pace.
Word traveled far, even without being able to read the newspaper (John had taught himself how to read from some bibles he’d found along his life’s road from the orphanage to the stables), and news of the royal family traveled faster. The most eligible was the younger brother, the heir was mentioned more rarely, and only in disappointment. Those who had seen the younger prince, or had seen his portrait in the royal gallery, said he was unusually handsome--emphasis on the unusual. He was, reportedly, anywhere from 5’10” to 6’4”, had brown or perhaps black hair, which was definitely curly or at least wavy, blue eyes that could be gray or green or perhaps amber depending on the time of day. The only thing anyone could seem to agree on was that he did not look like anyone else. He’d overheard a courtesan saying that even if she’d seen him out of his royal garb (insert giggles from the other courtesans) that she would know he was the prince simply because he did not look like a commoner.
Two months later the kid was back. Still high as a fucking kite, still wearing the same clothes as last time. This time he was snarking off to three police constables. One boy, probably about the same age as the strange junkie in the cell, was crying. His companions were fluttering about, trying to comfort the lad. Curious, Greg made his way over.
, John Watson.” Sherlock said somberly. John leaned into his husband, forehead to forehead as the guests began to clap before couples drifted onto the floor as the waitstaff started up a happy tune.
” the fake Sherlock asked after blinking, allowing the little dot of brown to bleed into his iris. John bit his wobbling lip and nodded. After a few moments the shade rose from the bed and took up a place at the window.
He looked back at Sherlock. In that moment they knew. Sherlock held out his hand, and John took it, casting his eyes over the scene one more time.
of these days on campus, this stark reminder of the future hurtling towards him faster than a speeding train.
It was late, or rather early. Dawn not yet dancing across the skies. John had fallen asleep in Sherlock’s bed yet again. It was the third time this week, and they’d only been like this for five days. Perhaps John just feared letting the genius go? For, now that he had him, John couldn’t imagine being without him.
Sherlock looked hard at John. Opened his mouth, closed it again. “Not important. I think the song is over now and I can go sit out there again until you’re ready to leave.”
The stepped out of the cab, Sherlock helpfully paying the driver for once. John would be worried that he was altering his behavior after Alex took shots at his levels of kindness, if it weren’t for how much money he was saving.
Was that a groan? Oh god. Oh, god. John gritted his teeth. He did not want to hear Sherlock getting a leg over.
The people were being stored in an abandoned warehouse near the docks. The team stormed in, Sherlock and John allowed to enter after the building had been cleared.
Finally, the boy sighed, sitting up fully and running a hand through his hair. He almost looked exhausted.
And so it went. After an hour and a half, Sherlock had cataloged every cut, scrape, and pockmark on Johns’ body. There were a total of five scars John couldn’t account for (
John felt a pleasant shiver run down his spine as Sherlock began to sip his tea with one hand, and gently tug at Johns' hair with the other. It wasn’t but another few minutes before John had drifted once more, this time his mouth opened, breathing softly. A look of utter bliss upon his face.
Memories were brought up for John after they broke the news to the girl. She found herself powerless to do anything in the wake of this information. The abuse had happened decades prior, and the man had far more money and connections than the simple schoolteacher could even dream of. The man would walk away unscathed, his reputation intact, the girl would have to live the rest of her life knowing the man she had remembered fondly as a brother figure had indeed been her abuser.
By the time breakfast was done, Sherlock has arisen from the world of the dead with a never-ending groan. A zombie shuffling into the kitchen, summoned by food. He stopped and stared at the little girl who was standing on a chair at John’s side, carefully adding tea leaves to the tea pot and messily (though not as messily as John assumed she should be) putting sugar cubes in the sugar bowl for herself and Sherlock. Then John saw Sherlock’s perfect mouth twitch into a smile as he joined the fray.
Rosie didn’t speak until three months after her initial rescue. She was sat in John’s lap while Sherlock recounted their adventure in Baskerville, censored for little ears, when she looked up at him.
you despite all your thorns. So just- Just stop thinking this fucking life is going to scare me away. Stop thinking I won’t take whatever the world throws at us gladly. And for fucks sake, just fucking… let me be part of the conversation next time.”
That night found them at a jazz club not far from the hotel. This was one of the only things Sherlock had insisted on so John was more than thrilled to be here with his love. They danced along the floor in a slow swing. Sherlock smiled freely. John felt himself melt, if only for a moment.
As if reading his mind both Holmes brothers eyes flashed up to him. He froze for a moment, feeling a bit like a mouse waiting for a cat to pounce. After a long moment of analyzing him head to toe, the brothers moved simultaneously. God, that was creepy, as much as the brothers argued and bickered, they both stayed in perfect sync. They often moved so similarly, so seamlessly, that it gave John the shivers. Mycroft shifted his gaze back to the two swatches in his hand (Gunmetal
John found them on top of his old uniform and pulled them on over his head. He wrapped a towel around his waist. “Yep, yeah, one moment.”
John looked at Sherlock in surprise, who rolled his eyes as he explained, “To be the next consulting detective?”
“Well it does damage the receptors permanently. We had to use a bit more laughing gas than we normally would, so he may be a bit loopy when he comes to. We’d rather he have a familiar face in the room, and since you’re here, we’ll make an exception on the family rule.”
“Bad day,” John confirmed. And he laid there, wrapped in the comfort of Sherlock, and the softness of a home that wanted him to succeed, until he was strong enough to continue.
Something about the picture threw John off. There was a smudge on the glass, and John unthinkingly went to buff it out with his shirt cuff. It didn’t budge, though.
That was a rare exception-- for the most part, John could do very little to help others with their secrets. At this point, he’d stopped trying. And yet still, everyone he met told him the thing they never told anyone else.
Sherlock, of course, solved the case post haste. John knew it barely achieved a four rating on the Holmes-Watson Case Interest Scale, but Sherlock took it because John wanted to see an old friend. He was actually very human when he wanted to be. And he had more motivation, since John was putting a bit more human inside him.
