Sherlock patted his hand apologetically and rose, tilting his head as if listening for something."Well it looks as if we'll have to have at least one more face to face meeting. I'll just text Mycroft, he'll be very annoyed that he wasn't the first to know." John listened hard and heard the slam of car doors just on the street below, and the familiar sound of a gruff voice. "Is he seriously going to do a drugs bust?" John asked incredulously as Sherlock strode out of 221a and took the stairs two at a time to 221b while texting leisurely on his phone. "Yes and Mycroft sends his well wishes, best be on your guard I think dear... you know her as Anthea will soon pay you a delightful visit."As soon as John passed through the door Sherlock locked it, buying them a few minutes. "Do we want to scar them permanently or will we go for nonchalance? Personally I would go for scarring, much more fun for us." They giggled as Lestrade and his team reached the door and failed to open it.
"...And there you have it. Here's the specimen jar, just go on through there and put it in the chute when you're ready." He ushered Sherlock inside and closed the door behind him. Sherlock took in the small room with a critical eye. Small, coat hook on back of door that was recently installed, one scrupulously cleaned leather armchair, a teak table covered in thirteen different magazines he was sure would do nothing for him- leaving out the fact that they were sticky, tissues and a half empty bottle of unscented hand lotion next to those, and then the jar. The damned thing was mocking him already and he'd not even made an effort yet. Removing his coat and perching on the chair, Sherlock trawled through his mind palace, trying to find something that would help him, but he couldn't access any of his times with John. For some reason, that wing was closed.
More than once Sherlock had stumbled, no thanks to the Belstaff coat he absolutely refused to leave behind and the slickness of the ground due to the light rain that had graced London’s skies barely an hour before. He caught his footing in time to see his target skid into a darkened alleyway, toppling a rubbish bin on the way in an attempt to stall the detective. Sherlock simply leapt over the offending plastic tub and continued the chase, fatigue starting to catch up with him, yet this was what he lived for; the thrill of running headlong into danger and the unknown and all for the sake of proving himself useful and clever and above all, quieting the ceaseless cries of his inner demons.
Angelo arrived in moments and smiled at them, winking at John, "What can I get you guys?" John ordered some soup or other while Sherlock just nodded at him. Angelo grinned knowingly and sidled out, leaving them virtually alone. Sherlock just stared at John for a minute, his mind racing. The unbroken gaze made John melt, he began to forget that they were in public at all and stifled a small moan, which he promptly blushed at. He hadn't realised he could make a noise like that. Sherlock's eyebrows had risen minutely in response but he hadn't said anything. He didn't need to. He intensified his gaze and reached across the table, caressing John's hand. John shivered at his touch. He was not one to be bested quite so easily. Beneath the table he began to rub his foot against Sherlock's, slowly moving higher and higher until he was rubbing his thigh. Sherlock smirked. They didn't even need to talk, they knew one another well enough that the regular first date interrogation was unnecessary. No, the talking they would be doing would probably be much more serious than that and for now both were content to maintain this playful silence.
The screen faded into white and then John was on the small screen, and the slide show began. Photos of their first date, and John smiling and laughing and their first kiss and him staring admiringly up at Sherlock as he deduced at a scene, the slides catalogued most all their time together, and
Becoming an army doctor AND fully-trained combatant was just the next logical step to make. The adrenaline and near constant determination to keep his fellow soldiers and himself alive was what kept him moving forward. One bone-shattering sniper bullet to the shoulder later, and he was back in London on a meagre pension. Yes, working the graveyard shift provided the adrenaline but it was nowhere near the stinging burn of the sun on his bare neck and the deafening volley of machine gun bullets all around him.
“Go home, keep warm, get some rest. Come back in the morning if you want, he'll probably still be under but I'll be here the whole time. Here's my number in case you need to come in after visiting hours or anything, I can only guess how strange your schedule is. I'm assuming you have contact details for Mycroft? Give him a ring, let him know the situation if you haven't already and then call a cab because sorry to say it mate, but you look wrecked. You need some serious sleep - Doctor's orders.”
He wanted to be the person that turned Sherlock around, that made him look twice and think that maybe being human wasn't such a bad thing to be. Wanted to

“He sounds wonderful Sherlock, I do wish you'd thought to invite him down, it's not everyday I get to meet people who Myc describes as being very fond of you. Tell me all about him!” She finished, folding her arms expectantly as Sherlock floundered.
Sherlock hadn't deliberately left John's gift for last at all, it had just been at the bottom of his pile and so by the time he had gotten around to opening it everyone had finished their own gift unwrapping and was focussed on his. The paper, a dark green, had tormented him from the day it had appeared in 221b. He pulled it apart to reveal a book, supple ebony leather and nothing else met him. "Open it." John murmured hoarsely from behind him. Suddenly tense, Sherlock peeled back the cover to a red marbled front page, the title "For Sherlock Holmes" recently printed in perfect black calligraphy. He turned the page and John's handwriting rose to meet him, a full account of John's every thought, clearly written on the day they first met lay in his hands. He flipped a few pages on and a quick yet startlingly accurate sketch of his face stared up at him. Another few pages and words like brilliant, wonderful, unbelievable and even beautiful caught his eye, and this was barely a few months into their partnership if the date at the top was to be believed. Every sixth page was a drawing, him at the table, bent over the microscope, whirling about a crime scene, pulling on his coat, leaning breathless and laughing against the wall in the hallway, a series of close up shots of his face, eyes closed with hands beneath his chin, Electrified with excitement during a case, a small smile quirking his lips and his personal favourite, his face open and cheeks rosy, mouth soft and wanting for John's. A fantasy, if the date was to be believed, because this, this was drawn almost a year and a half ago now. "John I..." Sherlock's voice cracked, and if it were even possible his face revealed a part of his soul, previously unseen by the majority of the room. How could anyone doubt the love John had for him seeing this? "I... Thank you. It's... that is... good" he finished rather lamely, but how could anyone possibly express what they felt looking into the heart of another and seeing pure adoration in every line of it? John's mind, his every thought, written just for him.

Sherlock quakes against him in time with each stroke, crying out when he slows to a stop, and if John loved him anymore he would burst. “Shhhh, I’ve got you.”  John kisses his intentions into the soft downy skin of his inner thighs, nuzzling into the musky warmth of his groin and feeling his own neglected length harden impossibly further at the thought of what he is about to do. This, he knew, was usually reserved for the whorehouse, but he wanted Sherlock to experience everything he could offer, and this was one of the most pleasurable phenomena he had ever known.
Sherlock may be numb to the insults he was bound to receive on a daily basis, but he would only be kidding himself if he claimed those words did not hurt him one bit. His head was starting to throb again. The next time the door to his room opened, it was accompanied by the telltale
John looked down at Sherlock for a split second, seeing joy and absolute terror, but mostly joy, mirrored on his face, and ran.
John made an appointment at the only jewelers he knew for the next day, hoping that Molly would have something for Sherlock to occupy himself with. He was confident that his idea was a good one, and hummed happily to himself as he ascended the stairs to 221b. He was unsurprised to find Sherlock in the same position he had been when he'd left and smiled at the look of concentration on his face. Carrying the shopping into the kitchen he stood back and admired the table that sure enough had been delivered while he was out. When everything was unpacked he flopped into his chair and smiled at Sherlock who raised a brow. "We should christen our new table" Sherlock smirked "That could be taken a variety of ways John, and only one of them involves food. Well, two of them could if you're feeling up to that..." He grinned cheekily and John was up out of his seat and grabbing Sherlock's hand, pulling him into him."I like the way you think Sherlock. But no food, I was sticky for days after the last time."
The drive home was subdued, it had been a long day and the conversation in the garden had given Sherlock a lot to think about. He stroked John's hair absent mindedly when his head lolled onto his shoulder as they drove and Mrs Hudson simply smiled affectionately at her boys. If the two had slipped into a light doze en route she was not going to wake them, not without getting a photo first. Sherlock was sleeping a lot more frequently now that John was sleeping next to him and she sent up a little silent prayer of thanks for their having found one another, the connection they had sparked since day one was something to be truly cherished. She hoped they realised how lucky they had gotten in finding their perfect other half.
When he broke the treeline a vast expanse of white sand with water lapping quietly greeted him and he stripped off socks and shoes, leaving himself in shorts and a top to stand at the point where the waves (blissfully warm) would break with a whisper against the skin of his feet. It was wondrous, and as the sun lit diamonds across the water John closed his eyes and took everything in, this moment being one he would recall for years afterwards when life became too stressful. He sat crosslegged on the sand next to his shoes and watched the egg yolk sun sinking to meet the horizon and painting the sky in the exact shades of pink and orange that reminded him of those old fruit salad sweets his dad used to sneak him.
John stopped him. "No, no wait, just, give me a second to wrap my head around this. You think that you deserve to be miserable and all that because you made me grieve you for the past two years? Or was it all the times before that when you supposedly made my life a misery? Sherlock Holmes you're my best friend and yes you're bloody infuriating and sometimes I just want to strangle you but that's just you being yourself and I wouldn't change it for the world! I could never really have been happy with Mary once I knew you were alive, the fact she tried to kill you doesn't even bear thinking about. As for this whole punishing yourself business I forgave you weeks ago, it's time you forgave yourself. In fact I'm sorry, for making you feel as if you weren't a totally necessary part of my happiness, because you are. Nothing you can do could possibly change that." Sherlock moved his head out from
Sherlock fell to his knees, faster than he had that day by the pool, but he didn't even register the feeling of his knees thumping the ground. John was gone. His phone buzzed softly, more and more insistent. He tore it out of his pocket and held it up to his ear, ready rolled spit venom at whoever it was. Mycroft's voice came through, and even Sherlock could hear that all was not quite well. "Sherlock, I take it John's disappearance has come to your attention as it has to mine. It would be best if you came to the club." Sherlock paused. "How did it come to your attention?" "Someone has hacked into the cctv system and is sending video footage live as we speak." Sherlock was running, feet tearing the pavement apart in his race to get to the club. Mycroft's voice was fluff in his ear and people were of no importance as he shoved them out of his way, mapping London in his head.
John rubbed his eyes and yawned in front of the window as he dressed, staring at the impressive ice structures that had apparently been erected while they were sleeping. Sherlock's long arms snaked around him from behind and he grinned up at him, swaying on the spot. "I didn't deduce what you got me" he murmured into soft blonde hair. He really hadn't. After the Molly fiasco when they had first become flatmates...well he had decided perhaps gifts weren't an area he should look into. Not that it stopped him being curious, anytime John got him anything the urge to know what it was overwhelmed him. A few times he'd broken down and deduced it but he always felt guilty because John could tell when he wasn't surprised and he didn't want to hurt his feelings so. No gift deducing. "I know, and I'm very proud." John chirped before unfurling himself from the embrace. "Get dressed you muppet or we'll be last in for dinner." Sherlock groaned. "I ate breakfast as a gift to you but I am not becoming a bottomless cavern for food like my brother. I'm not hungry." "Neither am I, let's have dinner." John said softly, remembering Irene again and her slew of texts that went unanswered with a sort of fondness that only hindsight allows. "You're lucky I'm so fond of you." Sherlock grumbled as he tucked his shirt, a dark burgundy, into his trousers and stepped towards the door with an affectionate eye roll. John finished tying his shoes and pecked Sherlock's cheek as he passed, picking up the bag containing their gifts as he did so.
Tea made and half drunk, Sherlock lead John back through the house at a leisurely pace, and nearly crashed into woman as they entered the front hall. "Sherly!" The short woman with bright green eyes exclaimed and threw herself at Sherlock's torso and wrapped him in a hug. "Aurora you and I both know he hates that name. Hello again Sherlock." Sherlock had frozen and his arms flailed as he attempted to decide how to react to the woman who was still clutching him. John desperately tried to hold back his laughter at the sight, he looked like an awkward gangly giraffe. The man who's voice had called to them stepped inside with a little girl cradled in one arm, a suitcase in the other and the beautiful woman John could only assume was his wife at his side. "Ford." Sherlock nodded in acknowledgment, and Sherrinford smiled. "Come on Rora, let him go." With a high pitched laugh she released him and flounced back to the door. "Victor, girls come on! Last one here has to sleep next to Cousin Henri!" Sherlock rolled his eyes and smirked as three pairs of feet pounded the drive, even through the snow just to avoid Henri. In fairness the boy was quite a pain, just like Mycroft a few years back but at least he'd realised just how annoying he was after Sherlock had nagged him for a few years. Henri was fifteen now and just totally unwilling to change regardless ofwhat anyone said. Ok so he liked him a little bit, but only because he admired anyone who would ignore those parents.
"Greg? Sorry to bother you like this." She said, voice slightly strained "But you wouldn't happen to know where Sherlock and John have gotten to, would you?" Greg frowned. The duo hadn't been into the Yard yet today even though they had an active case.
In truth he probably shouldn't tell Greg anything at all, he wasn't related to Sherlock in any way, but there was something about the worry in his face that convinced John that they might as well have been. Lestrade had jumped into the Thames to save his life, and gave him work that allowed Sherlock to show just how brilliant he could be. No matter what, this was going to affect him. That was enough for John.
Sherlock’s face was streaked with tear tracks, and John could feel the warm wetness of his own begin to fall. “I love you.” Sherlock sniffled and John had to kiss him. Had to show him just how much he loved him back, how desperately he was loved.
“You're burning up. Are you alright?” John asked, genuine concern etched on his face. “You've not been sleeping well.”
"I had planned on sleeping but it's not going very well. John... if you want to back out I would understand. In fact you marrying me would be so far beyond my understanding, I already cannot fathom why you agreed to this relationship, and the Mary situation... I am a man, John. I will never not be that, I will never not be myself in all my rude, insulting, arrogant, carelessness. You could have anyone. Are you sure this, I, am what you want?" John clutched him tighter to his body, feeling the race of his pulse through his chest. "Oh Sherlock. You are exactly what I want. I had thought maybe you mightn't want me but... this whole separation thing doesn't seem to be going well for either of us." Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief and stroked his hand up and down John's back. "No it doesn't. Usually I would love to be alone with my thoughts but tonight they aren't quite as pleasant as I would have hoped. I think I prefer it when we are alone together."
’ John thought to himself in the afternoon as he stitched a neat row across the cut on Mr Donnelly's abdomen ‘
John stood unmoving, lost in thought once more before shaking it off and following his colleague out the door.
The taxi glided to a halt and Sherlock leapt out, tossing cash behind him. "Eager as ever" John mused to no one in particular. Looking at the lines of people queued outside, John was pretty pleased with his attempt at dressing the part. Most of the men were wearing some form of suit like outfit so at least he wouldn't stand out entirely. Sherlock shepherded him to the front, and merely nodded at the bouncer who simply lifted the red barrier and ushered them inside. Sherlock surveyed the club. It was not empty, but not too full either. He made a note to use that as the compliment that it was when talking to the owner later. Right now he wanted a drink. While he didn't enjoy the music itself Sherlock could appreciate it's values, only because it essentially blasted all background thought from his mind which was a... nice change. John's hand was on his arm, motioning towards the bar. Sherlock simply nodded and they threaded through the throngs of people, reconvening at the bar where John simply raised two fingers and called something unintelligble to the bar tender, and in a flash there were two drinks in front of them. Sherlock sipped the pink concoction experimentally and his eyes widened. It tasted pleasant, far more pleasant than lager or bourbon.
And right now, looking down at the paper thin fragility of a man going out of his mind without a single person in his corner, John couldn't help but want to make him feel better. “Ok.” He said simply, watching as Sherlock's eyes widened in shock.
Sherlock flailed, trying to shake Ricoletti free. He was now totally submerged with a dying man dragging him down, a literal deadweight. His arms refused to free themselves from his coat sleeves as the pain in his abdomen flared to life, threatening to send him into shock severely lowering his chances of surviving. Making them about 0% actually. So, lower than he would like.
think I'll head to the seafront, watch the sun go down, stargaze. Feel free to join me if you feel up to it." Sherlock didn't respond and John simply walked outside, breathing in the balmy citrus air and following the dust trail to the shore.
John stepped into his space and looked up at Sherlock's face, blue eyes bright as he inhaled the scent of him, and Sherlock returned the favour, dragging his eyes up and down John's body from his ridiculous red shorts that matched the cuffs of his tshirt to the quiet intensity of his gaze when their eyes met, there was no need for words between them. The sound of John's shirt hitting the floor and seconds later Sherlock's joining it seemed out of place in the midst of the silence, but Sherlock couldn't deny that the result, a bare chest pressed against his while John held him close was worth the small distractions the sound of their clothes hitting the wood made. John kissed him like he couldn't imagine loving someone more perfect, slow and reverent in the knowledge that he had all the time in the world.
“Sherlock, I have been waiting such a long time to be able even to hold you like this, but if you wish it I will return to the manner in which I regarded you before last night, and... nothing need change” A small noise of protest escapes his throat and John’s hand finds it’s way into his curls, soothing gently. “However, if you would have me, I would much rather spend the rest of my days at your side, in your heart, and when the occasion allows for it, in your bed. Do not doubt that I wish to be with you because that is my singular dream. If I could tell the world, I would. You terrify me, Sherlock Holmes, such is the depth of my affection for you.”
"Well you boys should get dressed then, If I know Orabelle we'll be there for lunch. I'll just get my coat" Mrs Hudson traipsed back down stairs and Sherlock and John heeded her advice, moving back to the bedroom to get dressed. Sherlock was very pleased with Mrs Hudson, her gaze had not lingered on John's arm at all. In fairness the branded one was facing away from her, but still she had not commented on the black words seared into his skin. In an objective way, they were kind of beautiful, with each letter being equally spaced and almost looking as though they had been artfully shaded. To those who didn't know it could be seen as a tattoo, to those who did, it was yet another war wound Sherlock thought to himself as he watched John bustle out of the shower. He strode past him to shower himself, but first held John up for a moment to press a kiss to his brand. John rubbed his hair dry with a towel and cleared the kitchen quickly while Sherlock washed. Sherlock had just finished when he decided it was time to get dressed and the two danced around each other in a familiar routine, arms and legs just barely brushing as they reached for shirts, shoes, anything. John couldn't help but smile at the silver tags clinking together against the pale expanse of Sherlock's chest. Even as they disappeared beneath a crisp white shirt they were still resting against his heart. He pulled on his black and white striped jumper rather absent mindedly, not even realising that they had matched their outfits. By the time they had dressed and reconvened with Mrs Hudson a sleek black car pulled up outside.
“What happened between us the last time I was here John?” Sherlock asked without preamble, staring intently up at John, who shuffled awkwardly for a moment before sighing.
Soon enough the residual warmth of the summer disappeared completely, giving way to the biting cold and barren trees of winter. Time for the residents of 221b Baker street passed as it always did, with cases and chases and each other's company to help stave off boredom. With the change of the seasons came darker nights, forcing the tactics they employed when in pursuit of a criminal to change with it. John could not help but think back to last winter, when Irene Adler had made herself known to them. He smiled slightly to himself at the memory, fingers ghosting lightly across the rim of the crystal ashtray that sat on the mantle next to Sherlock's skull. She too had predicted this outcome, her sharp tongue dancing about the subject frequently, from the moment they had met in fact. "Somebody loves you" she had said and she had been right, although he'd actually just hit the place where he'd be least likely to leave permanent damage. But love him he did and he had figured it out after a long night of contemplation when she had disappeared. Rather inconvenient that, especially when the next big case came along, the one with Henry Knight in Baskerville.
"What about you John, I hear that you were in the army" "Yes, Afghanistan. Beautiful country really, lovely people until they start shooting at you" She smirked at that, smirking must run in the family, John thought to himself. "Mycroft tells me you were quite the ladies man" Testing him. "I was, very stupid of me I think now, considering the fact that I could have had Sherlock all along otherwise but, what can you do?" She nodded very slightly and the conversation continued onto lighter topics for a while. "Sherlock, Mycroft, go and fetch dessert. Now, both of you, go on." Sherlock stared at John, the flicker of worry returning to his otherwise seamless facade. His eyes stayed on John's until Mycroft shut the door behind them.
The first was of six men dressed in their army gear, grinning madly with arms raised as if to wave to them. It was clear they were in the desert, John was a good artist, there were noticeable grains of sand in the creases of their clothes. He passed that around and looked at the second, trying to hold back his laughter. The drawing was of a sopping wet Sherlock, standing the middle of a fountain with an exasperated smile clear on his face as he blew a jet of water out in a high arc. His curls were dripping water down his face and torso, and it was clear that he was soaked as John had drawn in the outline of what was beneath the rather flimsy shirt. Feeling Sherlock's eyes on him he turned to find the man looking over his shoulder with a smirk on his face. "Continue." he drawled and Greg handed the second drawing around, waiting till everyone got over their giggles before looking at the next letter. Sherlock sighed when he scanned it. "They become more sporadic from now on. John gets moved to Helmand, four of the men in that drawing die, two of them on his table. I take on more and more cases. He gets another leave and comes to Sussex with me to work on a private case... And again the next time to meet my parents, and I meet his sister. Then they all meet each other. When he goes back we write only infrequently for a year, but he always responds. In September he still hasn't replied to my letter from July and I know something is up when I get the next letter." Lestrade looks down at the letter in his hands, the RAMC insignia printed across the top of it, the formal language used.
John!") and the soft whir of steam brought a smile to John's face. "Come on, it's late and I don't know about you but I'm pretty tired." John picked up their mugs and carried them to the bedroom, Sherlock trailing after him grumbling about the fact that he'd slept more in the past three months than he had in years.
“I don't know what you mean?” John queried, hoping to garner a reaction, a blow up, a tirade of deductions about his idiocy, anything at all that would set him at ease.
"You can't be serious." Bill's voice echoed from Coach Lestrade's office through the changing room and John winced. The trouble with Bill was that he couldn't seem to help himself when there was mischief to be had, and as with every other time, it ended in the destruction of someone else's property. As captain of their football team John wished he could see a way to make his team member stop being such an idiot, as a friend he was happy to laugh along and let him be. This time though, he'd actually gone too far if the barking Lestrade was doing said anything. No one was quite sure what they'd done, Murray, Tony and Sam, but rumours of trespass and sometimes arson were flying about with the vigour only teenagers could manage. John for one just hoped they weren't being suspended, the season hadn't begun yet and he needed every player on the pitch to train or they'd never make it to the cup finals.
John was woken by the clattering of pans in the kitchen and the smell of eggs cooking. It always surprised him when Sherlock cooked. He had it in his head that Sherlock wouldn't be able to do something so menial, it didn't seem to matter that he'd lived alone for the majority of his adult life. It just seemed like the type of skill he'd have no use for. Wiping the sleep from his eyes, John pulled on a jumper over his pyjamas and strolled into the kitchen, marveling at Sherlock as he bent over to grab the milk.
"My hurry up, I said I was sorry but you know I didn't mean to get you drunk and you could have stopped taking the damned shots if you wanted to! I had no idea how much John could drink, he was still going when you hit the deck, and I know you don't care at the moment but sooner or later everyone's been part of an almost orgy in the middle of a gay club! I'd try and reassure you all morning, really I would but right now we have to go, and I don't know about you but I would really like to wash some of this... whatever this is off of me before we have to explain to your mother exactly why we're covered in more glitter than a Barbie doll's skimpy dress the day before your brother's wedding. Look, I come bearing gifts, water and paracetamol, so please get off the stairs and into the shower." Mycroft groaned as he heaved his body upright, and Greg smiled encouragingly from the top of the staircase, about twelve steps further up than Mycroft had managed last night.
"Now Sherlock, be nice. I'll be here if you want me." Mrs Hudson smiled at him as he rose and stalked off, reengaging the gang of tourists in conversation with ease.
Greg walked in at that moment and took in the intimate sight of his agents. While he was against meddling, he couldn't abide by cheating because he had been on the receiving end of a cheater and it was not something he would wish on anyone. He remembered that as he sat awkwardly next to Donovan who pulled away from Anderson sharpish, turning a bright shade of pink and casually depositing something in her pocket. "How soon can you have the paperwork from the case of the blue - I mean the Kent murders ?" Lestrade looked between them, waiting for an adequate response. "I'm just finishing up my report actually, should be finished by this evening." Donovan responded, avoiding the judgmental gaze of her boss. "Good, on my desk as soon as you're done. Anderson?" Jim reached into his bag and drew a manila folder from within. "Have to wait for the official autopsy report still but apart from that everything is in there." Cheek of him, Sally thought. The only reason her report wasn't finished while his was came down to an empty office last night. He worked on his report, she worked on him. Life could be so unfair. "Thanks. Lunch is almost over, we should probably go." He gave them both a look and waited until they scurried off to leave himself. Later, while he sat idly in his car, he wondered what it was that Sally had shoved in her pocket so hastily.
Sitting in the cab, Sherlock amused himself by twirling his phone in his hands while they had stopped at a traffic light and stared out the window, deducing the people crossing the road. The journey to Scotland Yard was one he had made hundreds of times from all across the city.
In the end, it was Molly who leaned in and, with a tentative brush of lips against her cheek, asked Holly if she got much free time, and if she'd like to get coffee some time, the answer to which was a definite yes, and a quick peck of her own, because regardless of whether she was superstitious or not (she wasn't, at least she hadn't been until this morning when Mycroft and Greg had insisted that this was valid and if they were taking the piss she'd murder them. Maybe not. After all a kiss is a kiss...) she just wanted to be sure that all the luck in the world would be on their side to help them make it to next year together.
They were quick to apologise after that and John clapped an arm around their shoulders. "It's alright, Dancing is supposed to be great for your football anyway. It'll be like training away from training ay boys?" Laughter bubbled among them and Greg shook his head. This dancing lark was going to be interesting for all of them.
Sherlock acquiesced and looked around, mapping the estate in his head. "Forest track, leads to the lake, 5km ride, should take about an hour, the others are waiting for us up ahead" and sure enough, they were. They cantered into the forest at a leisurely pace, and soon jovial conversation broke out between them. Even Mycroft and Sherlock sniped at each other less. In fact, the weekend as a whole had been thousands of times more pleasant than either of the Holmes' were anticipating, Sherlock was pretty sure it had to do with John's charisma, he had a way with people in general, a likeablitiy that was near impossible to emulate. It made Sherlock wonder if he had have met John sooner, whether he could have maintained a relationship with his family beyond every fifth Christmas and the occasional surprise visit. He almost felt as if the concept of familial closeness was much simpler to achieve than the fighting and silence. More testing needed was the solution his brain supplied. As long as John was part of the equation he couldn't care less.
John kissed him with such fervour, kissed him breathless as he maneuvered their way across the flat towards the staircase leading to his own bedroom. It wouldn't do, after all, for Mrs. Hudson to hear their exuberance, and if kissing alone reduced Sherlock to this liquid state, groaning and sighing against his lips as they met in such ecstatic harmony, John could only envisage what kind of electrified response any other attentions would receive.
that she would handle work for a couple of weeks, and giving her condolences. That had been an interesting affair, try though she might the woman had grown rather fond of the madman they watched everyday, and she truly was sorry that he had died in disgrace. She sent him updates everyday, although they really didn't register with him at all, bar one, which had simply read "Turn on the news." He had, she never ordered him around except in exceptional circumstances, and by God this was an exceptional circumstance. He watched as Lestrade held a press conference with John Watson (tired, grief stricken, holding himself together just for this) at his side, recanting all they had said about Sherlock being a fraud. It seemed that John had worked day and night to prove that Sherlock was exactly what he said he was, a genius, a consulting detective who had saved countless lives and had been slated, insulted and hunted to death in return for his service. A chuckle actually escaped him when John cut Lestrade off as he was thanking everyone for listening. "Don't thank them, they could've listened in the first place but they didn't because once again, they see but they don't observe, so they can fuck right off. I hope you all feel really good about your role in the death of Sherlock Holmes. Now piss off so I can go home." The silence that had fallen among the press the moment John had stood up was nothing short of unheard of, and better yet it was all live streamed, because no one had  expected an outburst from the placid Doctor Watson, but they no longer had Doctor Watson, they had Captain Watson and he was furious.
And yet. There was that pesky ray of hope every time Sherlock prolonged his gaze, or crowded against John when there was space enough for them both to have lots of it. Always John's heart would be in his mouth and then Sherlock would turn away, or the crowding was just his complete lack of respect for personal space. Still, John was secure in the knowledge that after last night Sherlock was not in any way, shape or form feeling the same. Secure was a bit strong. A bit devastated but willing to soldier on regardless because that's what you do when the people you love are oblivious arseholes who like to crush your hopes of reciprocation in their perfectly shaped hands. Walking wasn't helping that much with that. It was just making him feel bitter actually, watching elderly couples toddle hand in hand to the shop fueled a dozen completely innocent fantasies of future domesticity that would most likely never come to pass.
Holly appeared next to him, looking busier than ever and typing furiously on her blackberry. "I thought you didn't have to work?" Greg asked with a slight frown. At the rate she was going this girl would work herself to an early grave. She snorted and looked up from her phone for just a second before turning back to it. "It's not work per se, Sherlock occasionally used to send me any relevant information about the family in the past answer it seems that he's doing it again so I have to catalogue it all and sort it into relevance to the situation at hand at any given time so that if any of the family could be useful or similarly if they would be a hindrance to future plans we will just have to click a button to find out." Greg recoiled "Ouch. Sounds like work to me." Holly grinned and pocketed the device with a flourish. "Not too much if you can set up a program to do it all for you."
"It just became exponentially more interesting to me." Sherlock savoured the fiery look John threw his way at that, blue eyes smouldering at him like he'd like nothing more than to devour the detective right there and then.
"Come on, it's not like you have a better idea, is it?" Greg scoffed from his seat on the floor of 221b. Sherlock scowled. He had forgotten this visit would be taking place at all. It was John's fault in the first place for being so... Social. A week earlier Sherlock had just finished solving a small case and when Lestrade had asked John to the pub, he had assumed, wrongly, that John would refuse on account of both their tiredness. John had however accepted happily and simply kissed Sherlock goodbye at the door of the station and pottered off with Lestrade. Neither of them even noticed the black car that was lurking in the side alley as they walked jovially together.
"John, that was indescribable, you were extraordinary, I... have no words for what I am feeling but know that it is more joyful than I have ever been in my life." John smiled, sated and so clearly in love Sherlock's heart aches with the knowledge of it. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock's chest and pushed his curls back out of his eyes and Sherlock was suddenly very aware that they may not get the time together that they deserved, for all the knew every minute could be their last before someone accused them and this fantasy, this utterly impossible thing that had grown in the silence between them, would be shattered, and he was afraid. To lose this would be worse than death.
The graveyard shift was generally a nightmare, but during the lulls in crises the need for rest of any kind took precedence over pretty much everything else. John had spent many a night sitting in dingy back offices asleep in chairs; his skill for sleeping in any position including, on one memorable occasion, standing up, was well known, which was probably why people didn't question his overtaking their office chairs. Those are the nights he can get away, collect his thoughts, refocus for a bit and just let the trials of the day be processed - good and bad alike.
He lets one hand wander to his own length, and wraps the other around the base of Sherlock’s cock, raising his head to hover over it, breathing hotly onto the beads of lubrication drizzling down.
The bleak midwinter weather had done little to disparage the criminal classes, which meant plenty of choice regarding cases for Sherlock Holmes, who was all but skipping as he regaled the bewildered forces of Scotland Yard with his latest deductions that had led straight to their perpetrator. Watson watched from his perch against the wall of the alley, still catching his breath after a rather ambitious tackle that had only become necessary after Holmes had decided to give a lecture to Mr. Thompson, despite their having chased and cornered him, alone, without John's pistol. The clouds of puffed breath as he attempted to regain his strength looked ghostly in the deepening dark, and Holmes like a spectral king holding court as he orated.
“Mike!” he called out, jogging to where his colleague was looking over a nurse’s shoulder, reading up on a patient’s admission history. Doctor Stamford turned to greet him but was nudged to a quiet corner where John squared his shoulders, expression turning grim.
Twelve minutes and twenty four seconds. That was all the time it took for the drug to take effect, and once it did the affect it had on John was so blatantly obvious. He flinched when John had blurrily asked if Sherlock had drugged him, his eyes well on their way to being rather unfocused as he stumbled across the room to his chair, a destination he didn't quite reach. Not-Sherlock was jubilant, but coldly so, and the hunger splashed across his features was something that terrified Sherlock, that look had turned him off of people and relationships for fear of what he might do, no matter how much he might want them. Not-Sherlock slunk towards John, who (God don't) looked up at him as if he thought he would help him to get off the ground. Trusting. Has trust issues. Trusts (Potential alteration: Trusted.) Sherlock even when vulnerable. Save to hard drive. Too many seconds passed for that look to remain, and still Not-Sherlock loomed over John's pyjama clad form like a hunter over his prize.
Exactly. Plus I'll be there for moral support, it'll be fine and we'll see you both on new years eve as well anyway so there's that back up plan -J
The last of the lights in the yard were switched off and all the employees gone home. Standing alone in her bathroom, staring at her reflection, Sally opened the black ring box again. She asked herself if she truly believed that she would ever experience that moment when you realise the person you love is about to ask you to marry them. The honest answer, right now at least, was no. Her tryst with Jim wouldn't end in a proposal, it was one of the few topics he was vocal about. He was adamant that his proposal was the worst mistake of his life, one he would never make again. There were two reasons for that: his feelings towards marriage in general and his cowardice. He was not going to divorce his wife for Sally and they both knew it, even if he said that Sally was the one he preferred of the two. Sally couldn't help but feel empty at the thought that her relationship was a complete secret, and would be until the whole thing crashed and burned around her. The ring glinted at her, mocking her.
Greg really should have been prepared a bit better for the status that most of the people in this room would have, given that he slept with the British government whenever their schedules allowed, but everywhere were CEO's of international corporations and High ranking politicians and more than likely the ones he didn't recognise performed jobs like Mycroft's. For a long while he just stood in the corner and blinked because Mycroft had leapt out of his arms as soon as they had heard the first footsteps in the foyer and he hadn't paid Greg any attention since.
"Ready to go?" Sherlock glared at Lestrade acidly "I've been ready for twenty minutes now, yet somehow Lestrade's stupidity has amplified since yesterday as he can't seem to comprehend a single word I'm saying. We're going now Lestrade, call us once you decide to find whatever wits you lost." Sherlock wheeled around and John shrugged apologetically, before he could open his mouth Sherlock was calling for him. "Sherlock" he raised his eyebrows disapprovingly at him, waiting for the explanation. "He asked me if you had hit him with a blunt instrument John. Twice. He could not wrap his tiny brain around the fact that you inflict much more damage when my safety is at stake. He's an idiot normally but that was just too much." John could see his point of view and accepted that it was actually more reasonable than usual. "Well that's ok I guess" he smiled and pecked Sherlock lightly on the lips before taking his hand. Sherlock smirked at him "Feel like a run Dr Watson?" John laughed openly "Always Mr Holmes" and Sherlock sprinted off, John speeding along beside him, running through alleys answer sidestreets and one underground station, only stopping, breathless and satisfied when the door to 221b closed. They fell back against the wall together, laughing loudly.
He swung his head left and right but there was no indication of Sherlock, the one person he had been wanting to see and John’s heart sank.
have it, even though he knew Mycroft was not Sebastian. Mycroft pressed his hand into Greg's and they lay side by side. They never were the cuddling type.
“There you are! Oh Sherlock, Mycroft, I've missed my boys,” Mummy Holmes gave them both a hug and a kiss while their father looked on. “Come in, come in before we all catch our death on the porch!” She enthused, chivvying both men inside before shutting the door behind them.  “Your father and I were just saying-”
The party had died down a few hours ago, with only Sherlock and John, still entwined on the balcony, awake to see the sun as it rose. John's kisses were softer now, and Sherlock knew why. He had to go, pack his things and fly across the world to a warzone from which he may nother return. His stomach felt as if it had fallen out of his body. It was ridiculous he knew, they had only just met after all, but he felt about John as he had never felt about anyone else. He didn't want to lose him. John leaned his head on Sherlock's shoulder and wrapped his arms around his torso. "If I had met you a year ago... I don't think I would be leaving right now" he murmured into his shirt. "I wish you weren't leaving." Sherlock said honestly, because he did. He did wish that John didn't have to go, that he could stay and they could see what this was, what it could be. John reached across and pulled out his phone, shoving it into Sherlock's hands. "Put your number in, and your address. If I can't see you at least I can talk to you right?" He sounded hopeful, he was entirely serious. He wanted to hear from Sherlock. "Of course, I would like that, if we could keep in contact while you're gone. When do you get leave?" John laughed "Haven't even left yet and you're looking for leave! After nine months probably and then again in a year after that, then another six months and my tour is over" That was over two years. Sherlock nodded.
It was with this thought rushing around his head on a loop, like a toy car on a racetrack, that Sherlock found sleep, restless and dream filled though it was, not all of them were unpleasant, the memory of John's hand drifting across his forehead an anchor in the dark.
When he looked at Mycroft there was nothing but pain and determination in his eyes, he was going to do this. Anything in the world for John. He would miss John, leaving him was like leaving a part of himself behind, like leaving his brain behind, Hell he already missed him and he still had a night with him ahead before tomorrow's big show, the finale of Sherlock Holmes. He rose to leave and Mycroft didn't stop him, but before he left he turned around, shoulders sagging, eyes rimmed red. "Mycroft. Take care of him." He has to be here when I get back. The subtext was louder than the actual spoken words. Somehow Mycroft had not thought that John would contemplate suicide, but now that he was it seemed increasingly likely. "He will be here Sherlock." Mycroft flopped back into his chair as Sherlock left and wondered why, though he had imagined his brother dead many times (mainly by his own hands), the sudden reality of this was making him feel like he was having a heart attack.
"Martha Hudson! It has been far too long!" she exclaimed and wrapped Mrs Hudson in a tight embrace "Who's fault is that now Orabelle?" Mrs Hudson chided as she returned the embrace of her friend. Seeing John's confusion Sherlock whispered to him "Mrs Hudson's husband was a powerful man, my parents met them both at a variety of functions at which it was blatantly obvious that Mrs Hudson was not like anyone else in the circle, just as Mummy had been. They became fast friends, but then there was the move to America and her husband and later my involvement in her husband's death." John nodded his understanding. "It's good to see you again John, I had hoped that this would happen of course but Sherlock has a habit of messing things up when he gets happy." Sherlock shuffled embarrassedly as John was embraced. "I wouldn't have it any other way" he grinned and allowed her to drag him towards the house with Sherlock in tow and Mrs Hudson chuckling at the front of the group. In no time at all the four of them were seated in the living room, with it's expansive window over looking the tranquil forest and allowing the room to fill with light. Sherlock was splayed across the entirety of a black leather couch with John's lap as a pillow beneath his head and his hands running though his curls, his head moving to seek them if the movement stopped. Tea was passed out and Mummy and Mrs Hudson settled into their armchairs. "So. From when they left me last then?" the question was adressed to Mrs Hudson, and she nodded eagerly because there was no part of this story she wasn't hearing.
John had almost given up on the idea as a lost cause when he heard Sherlock move. It had been hours since he'd offered and there were only so many cups of tea a person could drink. The longer it had taken, the more anxious John became. What if it was something absolutely mad? He'd given his word and there was no way he'd back out now, but Sherlock could be eccentric at the best of times, so in this mood who knew what sort of crazy stuff he could come up with. In all honesty though, John was fairly sure he would do anything to get Sherlock out of the mood he was in.  Which was good  to have clear in his head as Sherlock slipped into the room and stood, awkwardly tugging at the belt of his dressing gown, about ten feet away from John.
That changed pretty quickly when he had seen the nursery Sherlock and John had created out of John's old bedroom in 221. There was love in every inch of it, the care taken to include soft edges on even the dark wood rocking chair that was nestled into the corner of the room next to a cot that lay beneath a mobile of the solar system. The room had been repainted a dove grey, with a gallery wall of empty picture frames, and one filled with an ultrasound scan adorning it. Already, there were soft toy bees and molecules, a blanket knitted in Mrs Hudson's signature style, and even a tiny deerstalker hat. Even the rugs on the floor were made from what felt like clouds, but what sealed the deal for Greg had to be the well thumbed books that lay strewn around the sitting room of 221B; Parenting books of every description, analysed to within an inch of breaking their spines. This baby was already more loved than most of the people on Earth, and there would be nothing that Sherlock wouldn't d to make sure that he and John both knew exactly what they were signing up for.
A/N Is that cliffy? I don't know! Just thought I'd mention that they stayed the night at the estate so this would be the next day. I did say it would be a wild ride, so get ready... -S
“So, did you see the guy who had to have that spoon removed from his hand?” With that Mary launched into conversation and John tried to concentrate, aware that the edge of his consciousness was fully preoccupied with questions about whether Sherlock would be lonely this Christmas, and the fact that if he was, he didn't have to be. John could have been there alongside him, or at least texting him. Instead both of them were probably going to do things they didn't really want to.

John gestured for the man to take the seat on the other side of the desk before he took his own. Shifting a little, he leveled his gaze with the stranger, his hands folded on the desk in front of him.
"I for one am not planning on spending this week red as a Manchester united fan on match day, I'll meet you inside." Mycroft had a small laugh himself at the shock on their faces as he strolled inside and away from the sun's harsh rays. Sir Alex had been a very useful contact in the past, something that had not changed even after his ill advised retirement, although they didn't need to know that. He'd barely made it past the threshold when he began hearing sounds of movement as the boot was opened and bags removed, Sherlock's feigned voice of boredom drifting inside in bursts. It was good to be back.
"Try me." Quickly John went through the events of that evening up to the flight from The Hollow. "... I found him in the common room with a glass of whiskey in his hand and the fear of God in him and I tried to comfort him as well as I could, but I didn't see the thing, whatever it was. He snapped and said... Well he said that he didn't have friends. It was more of a hiss actually now that I think on it. I know it's ridiculous and he's Sherlock and I should know better but..." Greg nodded in understanding. "I know mate. I was hoping he'd finally get there, able to admit he loves you or likes you at least. He does John, I just know it. He doesn't really mean that, he was just scared. He needs you. Maybe that's part of what's scaring him." John gave a self deprecating smile and shrugged.
“We can, but it takes all the fun out of it. Clearly this was a failed attempt at breaking and entering - just look at the state of the window latch in the kitchen. Mr. Thompson must have come home earlier than expected and in a fit of panic, the brother --”
Sherlock’s mind cleared, and he opened his eyes. He tilted his head to the left to take in John’s hesitant form, his hand still outstretched from where he had touched Sherlock's forehead.
The track was smooth, centuries of feet and hooves alike had worn it down. John was very thankful, he could only imagine the pain his legs would be in later if the jostling got anymore intense. So focused was he on staying on the horse that he didn't see at first just how incredible Sherlock looked. His curls and shirt were being tossed by the wind, glinting in the sunlight, and his form was perfect, as if the horse was an extension of himself. They were one, the slightest movement and the steed reacted, until the two were galloping through the forest with ease. John couldn't stop himself from staring, maybe it was just the amount of chick flicks he'd been subjected to in the past, but right now Sherlock could have been the knight on a white horse, come to save the day, and looking damn fine while doing it.
Mycroft held out a hand as he walked, and Lucia dropped a file into it, tapping away on her phone as they moved into the control room. "They were last seen being bundled into a white transit van just outside the city, and I've got the delta team running through the footage as we speak to figure out their location now sir. Do you want me to call a car?"
“How we hoped the snow wasn't going to hold you up too much.” Their father finished her sentence with a smile as he stepped forward to pat their shoulders.
It was Greg that spoke first. “He's just a kid,” he murmured. “..a stupid kid. He makes the worst decisions in the history of the planet, but they come from a good place. He wants to help people, he just doesn't know how to show it properly, and now… His brain is what he has, it's what makes Sherlock well.. Sherlock. If he can't use it anymore… he'll be inconsolable. I don't want to even think about what he might do. All for a stupid case. The bloody
The way John reacted to certain things (like Sherlock's hands on his neck and face) and the taste of his mouth (a fresh mint) and the way it felt to have him so close, finally. They stood for a long time like that, John pinned by Sherlock's arms and Sherlock glued to John by his coat. John was the one to break away.
“I've noticed that you've devoted yourself fully to my brother's care and recovery, well beyond what is expected of a regular physician. What is it that prompted you to do so? Do you wish to be compensated for your time, because I would gladly pass along a monetary reward-”
"This is so kinky oh my God." Mike whispered loudly and Greg couldn't help but agree, who got a girl playing flute music for them before they had sex? Intrigued, they poked their heads out from being the trunk and were astounded to see an entirely different scene playing out before their eyes.
John marveled at his own inability to fall asleep as he lay tucked into bed in the dark, staring up at the ceiling for lack of anything better to do. All his books were in the boxes downstairs and his laptop was in one of the suitcases which he was not in the mood to be searching through, plus he really was so tired that turning on the light didn't even seem remotely possible so he just lay there in the dark and listened. 'Maybe' he thought to himself 'it's like the late night at home before a holiday, all that excitement and nowhere to put it. Maybe I just really need to concentrate on something other than the fact that I'm here.' Unsurprisingly that realisation didn't help, if anything it made it worse. John couldn't help but wonder what Sherlock was doing on the floor below.
“Perhaps…” Holmes, having completed his speech, was briskly walking towards the road, and Watson knew from experience that if he did not reach him on time, the hansom would be gone and he stranded. “Gentlemen.” Watson tipped his hat and hurried to catch up.
Edgar shuffled out and handed Sherlock a receipt for the table, he had gotten Sherlock's account number all those years ago, and never deleted it. "Can I tell you something sonny?" Sherlock nodded, secretly pleased that Edgar thought of him as part of the family. "If you asked him, he'd say yes, and mean it. Sure you've only been a couple for half a year, but this is for the long haul, don't you ever doubt that. If you asked, he would say yes. I guarantee it, same as I guaranteed there would be a him to ask." Sherlock grinned at him, it was easy to forget that there was someone who could read him in the room. "You think so? We only admitted that we loved each other last week, is it not too soon?" Edgar put a hand on his shoulder and turned so they faced the photo of his wedding day. "When I proposed, I had known Jean for three weeks. That was it. We both knew, like you and John did, that we loved and were loved by each other without having to say it, knew after two days. There's no rush, I'm just telling you that you don't need to worry about it because when the time comes he'll say yes." Sherlock gave him an awkward sort of hug before pulling back and starting to make his way to the door. "Thank you Edgar, for everything." Edgar laughed, and patted his hand "You're always welcome sonny. Remember this when you're sending out the invitations. Now off you go, John's waiting." Edgar waved off the young couple and felt a warmth in his stomach that he had not felt in a long time as he saw their hands intertwine. "I wish you were here to see it Jeanie, someone who loves Sherlock just as much as he deserves." He smiled wryly at their wedding photo, standing proudly among his children's. The look of pure happiness between each couple was something he had prayed would be shown to each of his children and especially the one he had taken under his wing six years previously.
Truly it was for the best, they were constantly teetering on the fine line between life and death, and it was better to take the next exit off that particular road to ruin before they reached a dead end - quite literally. Their apiary had been Sherlock's idea, a countryside haven of lavender, lilac, heather, and honey. John had discovered unprecedented green fingers when they'd arrived to the cottage and took great pleasure in tending the flowers and trees while Sherlock worked with the bees. A day never truly felt the same if he hadn't spent time in the flowerbeds or among the trees, glimpses of Sherlock flashing past him dressed all in white and net, the two of them coexisting with nature and each other, even after all this time.
John was unsure if he could withstand even this small pleasure, not with the sounds, greedy and wanton, that spilled from Sherlock's lips making him wonder what Sherlock would sound like when he touched him, when he brought him to his release. Combining that with the way Sherlock began to writhe in his lap, seeking friction and pressing his hardness into John's stomach, John couldn't find it in himself to make them slow this pleasure. He was Sherlock's first ever, Sherlock was his first man, and they had waited in love and agony for far too long as it was. With this in mind John reached down and stroked, gently, and the groan it solicited, his name like a prayer from lips that he had made red, made him single minded: he would wring pleasure from Sherlock with everything he had.
Alone now John gravitated to the edge of the room, sitting down next to a young couple and their son. "He's adorable" John gushed at the woman "I'm John, oh look at him! How old is he?" She smiled and her husband proudly grabbed her shoulder. "Just turned three a few weeks ago. I'm Anastasia and this is my husband Edward and our son is Timothy" John tickled the small boy who burst into tinkling laughter, blonde curls bouncing happily on his head. John could see Anastasia eying the dancefloor longingly.
Mycroft froze the frame and zoomed in for the thirty seventh time. Once again Sherlock was muttering, analysing every tiny detail. "Satisfied yet brother? He does feel for you, care for you more deeply than I think even he knows he is capable of. It's perfectly alright you know Sherlock. To care about John. He's a good man, and I believe he is worthy of you. There are sometimes, very rare instances, where caring is not a disadvantage. John will make you happy." Sherlock was still as a statue behind him, at a complete loss. John might feel that way, and the connection was there but it was about whether he chose to act on anything, after all he hadn't up to now. Sentiment. So utterly confusing. "What do I do Mycroft? He's... I don't want to scare him away! I can't lose him... Not now or fifty years from now." Sherlock wrapped his robe around himself and stared wide eyed at his brother as he used to when he was a child. For once, Mycroft did not have the answer. There was no way to avoid hypocrisy by saying to just tell John because he hadn't said anything to Gregory and they'd been acquainted for years. "I'm not sure, It's not really my area of expertise..." Mycroft blushed at that and leaned back in the chair head lolling to the side. He cupped his face in his hands and sighed. "This is not as simple as normal people make it seem." Sherlock snorted in agreement and rose to make coffee. He'd just set the mugs on the table when footsteps began to clatter up the stairs. A key turned in the lock and his heart jumped. It was John.
"... And so I now, unfortunately, can't look at the man without thinking about it and if I think it he sees it and if he saw ... It would just make things more awkward and I don't want to put him in that position you know? Doesn't help that I've loved the bastard for a good year now without knowing it. Waking up was very unpleasant for a few days to say the least."
Trust Sherlock to pick a hotel that supplied kettles and mugs to each guest to go with the abundance of tea and coffee available in their room. Their room. Sherlock had hesitated when the clerk asked what they wanted, settling on a twin bed suite. As they walked (cuffs removed "YOU HAD A KEY?!") to the lift there was a question on Johns lips, he could see the unrest in Sherlock's posture but the infuriating man had made a shhh gesture with his hand before John had even opened his mouth. It was in silence that they entered their room.
"Yes, I was an army surgeon and I did get shot in the left shoulder meaning I had to come home, and Harry and I don't get along, Harry and Clara separated three months ago, and Harry is a drinker." Sherlock's smug grin was something even the cheshire cat would have been envious of. "And Harry is short for Harriet." Sherlock cursed "There's always something! Sister of course!" and the man chuckled lowly again. "Are you going to lay on the ground all day or would you be up to coming back to my place so I can patch you up a bit? Oh, and I'm John by the way. John Watson." Sherlock rolled the name about in his mouth. John Watson. Huh. "Sherlock Holmes-" He cut himself off from saying Holmeson, because he was going to have enough trouble remembering the backstory he'd invented for Mrs Hudson that he'd labelled unimportant after the event (foolish, Sherlock a voice in his head that sounded irritatingly similar to Mycroft admonished) without adding a last name that had only been in use back when Earth had been over run with barbarians they called vikings.
John chuckled good naturedly. "I might give her a day to recover before giving her a piece of my mind. Not telling your own brother, not to mention your
Which is why, as John was standing there tending to a paediatric patient with an unfortunate case of measles, aware of someone watching him from the entrance to the ward, he made to clench and unclench his left hand, like he always did when about to face an unknown enemy.
“Fine. I’ll….I’ll go. But only on the condition that you facilitate my release out of here, and quite quickly. I have somewhere to be by midnight tonight,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock was shaking, eyes rimmed red with the tears that refused to fall, yet were still created. John's breaths were shallow and fast, and even Mycroft could see the effort it was taking for him to lie still when his whole being was screaming that he should curl up into a ball to avoid being attacked again and to try let the wounds clot. "Any ideas?" Mycroft asked in a brief respite from the torture. "Three. I want to be certain, and I want to go now but... I might be wrong. What if I am wrong and I go and while I'm gone..." he didn't need rolled finish that sentence. Mycroft too feared that this may well be the last they saw of John Watson. He could only imagine how short a time his brother would remain if that were to occur. Most likely only long enough to kill Moran, and then himself. "I do not doubt you Sherlock, this is your John. You will not fail him." Sherlock turned to look back at the screen and prepared to search again.
That brief conversation only returned to Sherlock after John opened the door to reveal Lestrade and Mycroft to his dismay.
Molly had asked not to be seated up with the others mainly because she wasn't exactly good with being stared at, but also because it would have looked a bit odd if Lucia was up there too, she was just supposed to be a PA. The table they were at was quite a mixed bag. The emergency response team members at one side, one of Sherlock's beautiful cousins and their boyfriend, Henry knight from the Hound of Baskerville case (Yes she read John's blog in her free time ok?) and a woman who introduced herself as Mary Morstan, the jeweler in charge of their rings.
" Sherlock whimpered, and John could feel the word resonate across his lips as he unbuckled braces to pull Sherlock's shirt-tails loose "please..."
Dan sighed and wiped his forehead next to him, a questioning look in his eyes. John knew that look. “Go on.” he huffed good naturedly “take a minute, grab a coffee. I'll let the family know what's going on.”
John sat back and watched in awe as Sherlock propped himself up and downed most of the soup in one gulp, and the rest of it in a second. Then Sherlock lay back down, fluffed the pillows and patted the space beside him, a genuine smile on his face. John bit back a laugh and climbed back into the bed. "You didn't have to bribe me you know, you could have just asked me to stay." Sherlock frowned. "Would you have stayed if I'd asked?" "Of course." "Oh. And... If I asked you again would you do it again? Even if I wasn't sick?" John smirked "Yes" Sherlock rolled over to face John "You won't mind if people talk?" "No, not if what they're saying is true" Sherlock stayed silent for a while and John thought he had fallen asleep.
Greg bit back a yawn and both men stood up, stretching weary limbs and hoping against hope that John was right. “Maybe I'll pop down to the vending machine, see what I can rustle up.”
I know there is something rather significant that I have not written, but you know, don't you? How could you possibly not know how much I love you? Love is a chemical defect found in the losing side, and I would happily be part of the losing side forever if it meant that you loved me too. I love you so much that my heart clenched just thinking of you, it's rather disconcerting actually and highly illogical but I think I like it, a reminder that you are the only heart I'm likely to have. I am here John, in your position exactly on the other side of the world and taking comfort in the idea that perhaps the air that I'm breathing has passed through your lungs before being carried to me. I will never stop telling you how much you have come to mean to me when I come home. Wait for me, my dearest John. I will come home for you.
The first words out of his mouth were so soft that his parents had to strain forward to hear them. “John.. John's too good for me.”
Sherlock was tired, exhausted in fact. It wasn't surprising, he was always tired these days, he was playing a different venue every night, travelling the world, and trying desperately not to fall for the band's resident medic. It was tiring stuff for anyone, especially a teenager. Every night he had thousands of girls and guys screaming their adoration at him, singing along to his own low voice and crying as he crooned softly to them while strumming the guitar. That was the dream for most musicians, and it was fantastic until he had to actually talk to his fans. He couldn't stand people, they were so incredibly boring. Most of the time he stayed in his room, composed and people watched through the window of the tourbus or whatever hotel they stayed in. As a general rule he avoided spending any time outside of rehearsals and sound checks with the other members of the band. It was easier that way, stepping on people's toes was something that came naturally to him but quite frankly he didn't have the patience to find new members and therefore he couldn't piss the current ones off.
She flushed even deeper and stood up, grabbing her bag and fuming she turned to leave. "John I hope you know what you're doing because this tosser is the single biggest arsehole I've ever spoken to in my life. He's not good enough for you and I hope you'll come to your senses and hightail it before it's too late. It was nice to see you again Johnny." and with that she swept out, leaving her utterly mortified brother in her wake. He sighed and rubbed a weary hand across his face. "Well that went better than expected." Sherlock's eyebrows were in his hairline at that "that was better than expected? Were you expecting a homicide?" John smirked and then shrugged "I expected you to blurt out your deductions right off the bat and her to storm off before sitting down, most likely parting with a slap to your face. So yes, better. Thank you, anyway, for trying. She's more difficult than you mostly and it means a lot that you made the effort for me even though I amn't particularly fond of her either. She's the only family I have left though... Only seemed right having her meet you before you officially become the only true family I have eh?" he smiled happily up at Sherlock who grinned back and locked their lips together. "She did have one thing of merit to offer" he murmured in breaths between kisses. "Mmmm? And what would that be?" John enquired lightly. "Leather trousers are a fantastic idea" John groaned and Sherlock simply smirked.
Apparently, he was a knobhead. At least that was the teary eyed warning he'd been given before walking into the ward where Mr Holmes lay, incredibly alert for someone whose heart had stopped the night before, and by the looks of him, not very happy to be there. Joy.
A boy (16 years old, single mother, former addict, three young siblings, lives in the outskirts of London, forced to participate in religious activities by counsellor), entering the church, his shoulders quaking slightly with fear. Ah. He had been right then. He wished a little bit that he had been wrong. Now they had to wait for the real man they were looking for. And Sherlock had a great idea about how to get him to show himself to them. "My phone John" he said, palm outstretched. John smiled lightly and reached into his coat pockets for the phone. Sherlock sent a quick text to Lestrade who replied almost instantly. 10 minutes before the police would arrive. Sherlock got to his feet and pulled John up with him. In the corner of his eye he spotted a severe looking man in religious garb, only about 47, an outlier in the bell curve of the age of people in religious orders.
Sherlock could hear John rubbing his face in frustration. “Why are you being such an arse? I’m a doctor, alright, I have a tight schedule so when I’m informed that one of my patients wishes to see me, I actually took a break to see said patient, only to then be kicked out. I only have so much patience, Sherlock, and if my actually paying attention to you is only going to prove to be a waste of time, then you can kindly piss off, take a minute and figure out what exactly it is you wish to accomplish from your time here. I will now go to treat patients who actually wish to be taken care of,” was everything he heard before John stormed out of the room.
He had a retort ready when he spotted them - the numbers just barely visible under the doctor’s rolled sleeve at his forearm. He could only see four out of the six, but they were unmistakably there:
as we have been. I mean, I wasn't even sure if you had ever... with anyone! As for the public thing... everybody already assumes we're a couple, I see no point in denying it now that we are one and it'd be nice to go places with you that didn't contain corpses or blood spatters." Sherlock looked a little bemused at that. "Yes, everybody assumes that I was always prudish or some other such rubbish. I'm not as innocent as you think" With that and a smirk Sherlock left, satisfied that when the time arose they would be on the same page.
The scene Sherlock wanted to perform was a mix of the finale and the seduction of the prince by both swans. The climax of the dance. John nodded pensively along with his explanation but each word made him more nervous than the last. He could not do this.
“May I have everyone’s attention, please?” John projected, “Please arrive here at 6:30 am for core, as always. Weights session tomorrow will end fifteen minutes short for dehydration tests. Adler will yell at you if your piss doesn’t make the cut. Your piss better make the cut. Are we clear?”
“They’re our ticket, John.” Mike assured him and then  went on to detail every bit of their rowing history, from Jim’s first time in the coxswain’s seat to Seb’s personal 2k record. They would laugh at weird intervals and John came to the conclusion that the inside jokes were definitely not lacking in their friendship.
“Y- you utter arsehole.” John sputtered as Sherlock coughed uncontrollably on the sidewalk. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth to speak, only to be silenced with another coughing fit. “You planned this. So my symphony would keep playing? Major event. With someone who, sadly, is a big part of my life. And you knew, didn’t you? That my symphonies tend to end and begin with acts of stupidity.”
“Yes.” Holmes affirmed, his muscles straining in the tight long sleeve. John’s brain function lagged as he noticed a very real, very visible pair of nipples peak through the fabric.
Holmes. He had sauntered into the boathouse, a bored look on his face, not paying attention to queue of boys before him. Holmes was dressed fashionably, toting around a brand name athletic bag and expensive racewear. He surveyed his surroundings and sighed deeply. Holmes proceeded to the back of the line and ignored any conversation directed at him.
Focused and determined, they could move boats through the water and come out with low splits and high rates. When given the right push, they could clear puddles at forty strokes per minute. They could pull sub two without breaking a sweat. All of them felt they deserved a spot in the Blue Boat, even if they knew well enough that half of them would be gone by November.
You’ll see the coxswains refer to their “line” and their “point”. The line is an imaginary course that coxswains project onto the river. It governs where they turn and where they steer straight. The point is simpler, it’s where the boat is projected to go. Most coxswains use landmarks to fix their point. Say, if a boat is pointed towards shore and the coxswain doesn’t fix it, the boat will beach, or end up on land.
Off-keys were outcasts in society, infinitely lost and indefinitely empty. Without their music playing in the halls, they walk around dazed, a faint memory of what they had once been. The loss of the music means the loss of everything. They ended up on the streets, peddling for food and money, never to return to society again.
Mycroft calls. John doesn’t want to know how he got ahold of their address. What he does want to know is how Sherlock is doing. He bites his tongue before he can say another word. Mycroft congratulates them and graces their flat with his approval. John rolls his eyes. Mycroft raises an eyebrow but says nothing. Mary goes to make tea.
Time passes and his daughter grows. Everything becomes blurred. John’s hopes of reconciliation dwindle with every passing day.
No matter how many times she corrects him, her tea is always black with two sugars. There are no bulletholes in the wall or dead body parts in the refrigerator. Every surface is devoid of experiments. Appliances are used properly and safely. It is the opposite of Baker Street. It’s the farthest from John’s old life as possible. It's astonishingly mind numbing.
“Don’t write that down.” Holmes ordered and groaned when he saw the sheet, “Why are you writing that down?”
“When you told me that it was highly unlikely that the producers would kill off such a number of characters in two seasons and that I should go ahead and finish Downton Abbey.” John huffed.
“You’re the first coxswain to achieve presidential status here at Cambridge, I’d have to be living under a rock to not hear about you.” Holmes said petulantly. John grinned, delighted that his presidency was being discussed somewhere other than the boathouse locker room.
Crew is different from other sports because it’s really equipment driven. Boats can easily malfunction and parts can break and get damaged. Oars can get old, headset wiring can fry, and load of other things.
The walk to the lecture wasn’t long. But the professor seemed dead set on going over the allotted time. How long could someone talk about muscle density? Really fucking long, John found. He tried his best to listen to the professor drone on and on about the makeup of the brachioradialis and wrote as much as he could hear (which was not a lot).
They took up one hundred percent on the space in the living room and haunted him with their constant presence. Every morning, Holmes would emerge in all his sweat soaked glory and John would have a heart attack. It was embarrassing, really.
In the same instance he grabbed Sherlock’s waist, his fifth symphony began to play again, after three years of being in rest. It signified lots of things and some conductors could write pages upon pages of analysis about the meaning of that note or why this note was coupled. None of this meant anything to Sherlock. All that mattered was that John’s song continued.
At the end of the ride, he gave John his number. John was elated, until he figured out that as flatmates, they would need to agree on a move in date. He took the piece of paper with a tight smile and ignored the rude hand gestures being made by Bill and Kav in the background.
John gulped. Anything meant a lot of things. Oh god, that face. Maybe if he just- better not. He stood up abruptly, letting Holmes’ legs fall to the floor. As expected, Holmes was not flustered or even vaguely put off. John looked at Holmes, who still looked like he just stepped off the front page of GQ. Not that he read GQ. Or had a subscription.
His coat, his scarf, too conspicuous and they reminded him of John, cases. Must have been sentiment but he did not want to taint those memories with this. Instead he slunk carefully into John's room and pulled on one of his rattiest old jumpers, one he never wore in Sherlock's presence and likely hadn't worn for years. His scent was not laced into the fabric. Perfect for this purpose, to conceal the small sack of cocaine he would acquire. London was dark and foreboding, holding it's breath, moving in slow motion through a vacuum. He hugged his arms closer to himself, moving blithely through the shadows. The cast iron door embedded into the crippled brickwork hid the seedy truth of his past. The highs and ecstasies, crashing lows, unpleasant deeds and abuse all lay waiting behind the door. Three sharp raps in quick succession and a purple eye appeared at the glass eye piece as the bolt was slid open. The leathery face wrinkled up into a leacherous smile. Before the man could say anything obvious Sherlock cut across him. He simply held out his hand. The small bag dropped in his palm, the feeling so intrinsically familiar, a perfect gram. Sherlock thrust some cash into the eager hands and turned, fleeing on his heels back to Baker street.
Sherlock slowed his pace significantly as they ascended the stairs to ensure John leaned against him adequately, it was unlikely that he would be in a position to support his own weight for much longer. Statistically speaking if John were to fall Sherlock would have a 45% chance of catching him without causing injuries to either of them. It would be better not to let that happen he decided as they finally reached the last few steps. "John if you're about to lose consciousness I should be made aware" John hummed "Right well I eh blacking out" John garbled out as he toppled over, blue and purple lights exploding in the sea of black behind his eyes. Sherlock reacted as fast as he ever had and managed to grab John before he hit the floor. "Carrying it is then" he muttered. After all John was not awake to feel undignified. Sherlock picked him up and carried him bridal style to his own room, it had become theirs anyway. John opened an eye and looked around. The world looked very different than it had a few minutes ago. "Are you... Carrying me?" Sherlock grinned "Not for much longer. I'm putting you to bed." John sighed and nestled into Sherlock and his coat. "Might as well enjoy it so." As Sherlock placed him gently between the sheets John locked his hands into the lapels of Sherlock's coat. "Stay, you need sleep, I need sleep, want company" John added from his place in the pillows. Sherlock rolled his eyes and yet began taking off his shoes and outer layers.
Lestrade sighed deeply when he saw John blowing gently on his knuckles, Sherlock's arms around his waist. "Do I need to call an ambulance for him?" He gestured to the priest who was being cuffed by the same officer that Sherlock had seen earlier. He snorted a bit, Lestrade had no clue, this would make for good fun with Mycroft later. "No. He'll be in pain but the injuries are superficial." John said. "Mostly" he whispered just loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
If he could sit up at an 87 degree angle, he might be able to get a look at the good doctor's face, see if it's Mycroft he's calling. Having big brother sweep him under some ‘private facility’ rug would be less than ideal, especially when there was something so interesting to do here. It wasn't often that a mystery, with himself at the apex, fell so willingly into his lap and he'd be damned if Mycroft sequestered him before he had the answers he desired.
Sherlock was silent, disbelieving that he was having this conversation at all. He put down his spoon, and, clearing his throat, continued the first and last discussion about his nonexistent personal life.
Still, when Irene closed the door behind herself and left him alone with a total stranger he knew next to nothing about, well he wished he'd had more than a minute to collect himself. "So. When are you planning on telling your friends that you're enlisting?" The first words out of his mouth and John was stunned.
Too soon (or not soon enough depending on your point of view) it was time for speeches to be made. Greg stood up with his glass in his hand and smiled out at the crowd. "Those of you who know Sherlock will know that the fact we're seated here this evening is nothing short of a miracle. That miracle's name is John, and he is quite short." Laughter broke out and John elbowed him in the leg. Still Greg continued on. "There's a lot I could say about this pair, from the first time I met them to the things they've admitted while sloshed. However, I'm not going to do that. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so if you'd all face the wall to your left..." and suddenly Greg was hopping down from the dais and a projector was being wheeled in. "Oh dear God" Sherlock cringed as he realised this was actually happening.
"Pity. What about Mortimer?" Actually now that he thought of it, John was a bit pissed off."You know I didn't. Are you trying to be funny?" Sherlock shrugged "Thought I might try it out." John huffed a mirthless laugh. "I'd stick to ice." And with that he really did speed up his pace until there were at least twenty metres between them because Sherlock seemed to have frozen where he stood.
"Shhh love. It's alright. I've got you, you hear me? I've got you." John whispers, kissing every part of him he could reach with their bodies as close as they are, running his hands down his back, his sides, his thighs and stopping at his hips, holding him.
Every peak and valley receives his attention in turn, the concave wonder of his suprasternal notch, the little mole on the left side of his neck, each bump of his ribs, until Sherlock is writhing and sobbing John’s name like it is the only utterance he has ever known, and that is when he touches him, sliding his hand into the wetness that has seeped from the crown. Sherlock keens, hips bucking into his hand, and John soothes him with a hand on his thigh while the other travels the length of him, hot and hard as a pistol.
It was his second to last chance to get there and next year he'd make the choice between football and schoolwork and schoolwork would win, he'd have to study properly for his A levels, he needed the marks to get medicine before he could even think about enlisting. The guys didn't know about that decision quite yet and he was hoping to keep that secret for as long as he could. It was the only chance he had of becoming a doctor, no way his parents could afford it and he was not taking out a student loan. Football was great but being a doctor and maybe even being a soldier were the two things he really wanted to do. Still if he was down three of his best players before they'd even played a match he might as well throw the towel in now.
The present from the Yard actually left him a bit choked up when he saw it, the twinned magnifying glasses engraved with Consulting detective and Blogger accompanied by a very full letter, with little snippets from each officer they'd worked with giving congratulations and one even thanking them for helping him win the pool they'd had going. It was clear the gift had been Donovan's idea, the handwriting on the box alone made that much obvious. He would have to thank her, maybe a nice solved case with her name on it, she wasn't entirely incompetent after all. The sound of pages being turned made him look up to find John staring in awe at a book bound in leathery material and likely hand designed to hold the various artistic works of the extended Ledger clan.
"Mary, I'll make it my business to get them to you before this baby is born if I have to fly them to the hospital in a police copter myself."
Soon only four were left. Molly, Lily, Anthea and Sally herself, all in various states of sobriety ranging from vaguely to very much not. The group had moved to the bedroom, Lily and Molly draped across the bed while Sally was on Anthea's lap in the armchair, deeming it "A damn sight warmer than either of you sticks." Anthea had smirked at that. "We should do something!" Lily cried, vaulting her body into a sitting position, still crackling with energy. Sally raised an eyebrow "like what? I don't know about you but I'm not getting up for anything except maybe food, Annie here doesn't really have the option if I'm not and Molly should stay off her feet because come the wedding she'll not want to walk ever again." Lily stuck out her tongue "So as long as no one has to move we're all good? Brilliant! How about we play 'Who's The?' God remember in school when Jack said you were the prettiest Mols ,and then when they asked him for his explanation he said it was because you never made scrunched up kissy faces?!" Lily clutched her sides laughing and even Molly had to admit that it was quite funny.
"Mr Holmes? When I heard the call was urgent I had expected a bit more... urgency. Then again, with Billy as your messenger you never quite know what you're walking into!" Molly smiled patiently up at him and Sherlock resolved to induce a meeting between herself and the good inspector.
"No living family, recently returned from military service due to injury..." Sherlock was bent down, scrutinizing the body. "Poison was initial cause of death, administered through the tea that spilled on the ground by the door, marking on his wrists suggests postmortem binding, his shoulders are dislocated, also postmortem... Lestrade take of his jacket. You have gloves, take it off right now." Sherlock could see the glint of grains in his mouth. He had at least four ideas. Lestrade sighed and peeled away the jacket, stuffing it into an evidence bag. He recoiled when he saw the torso and John swore and turned away.
"Merry Christmas Mycroft" Lestrade beamed up at his lover who was still panting from the very enthusiastic wake up he'd received. "And many happy returns my dearest Gregory." Mycroft eventually managed to get his breath back. His phone beeped quietly front the bedside locker and he frowned as he picked it up, but that quickly melted into a smile when he read the text he'd received. "Meretricious, brother mine -SH" Quickly he typed a response. He didn't need to think too hard to picture the small smile on his brother's face, he'd caused it more often these days than he could remember doing since he'd boarded at Eton. "And a happy new year Brother dearest -MH" Perhaps they might make it through this holiday after all.
"The stitching indicates the use of a machine, If he is examined you'll find the body is lined with a residue of sand." Sherlock swept about the room and stopped at the back wall. "Scaffolding. Why would... Oh. That's new." Lestrade looked up from his notes. "What's new?" Sherlock's eyes gleamed. "This killer is playing Puppet Master." By now John had distanced himself in his head from the person on the ground and was able to appreciate the deductions once more. "That's brilliant" he said and Sherlock visibly puffed up with pride. "The other victims?" Lestrade flipped through his notes. "Various ages, none look too similar, different schooling, residences are scattered across London, only connection is they were all in the military" John whipped around. "Let me see them" Lestrade handed over the folder and watched as John's eyes crumpled up in recognition. "All of these men were in my company. All of them. There's only two more people left alive from it now. Harold Thomson and me."
It felt like even from that first day Sherlock had finally interacted with him (there had been a few years where, somehow though they were both at the camp they'd just missed each other), both of them cast in the musical as zoot suit guys, he had known him. Known him deep in his soul like they were meant to be, electric and terrifying though that first kiss as the curtain was pulled had been, it was like he hadn't been alive until their lips had met. After the show they'd met around the back of the theatre and in the dark of that first night they came against each other, Sherlock had had bruises from the wooden slats of the back wall on his lower back that only disappeared the next week. The electric feeling of John's kisses never did.
For a long while Sherlock simply lay there, staring up at him with confusion written across his face. It was kind of endearing, and a little bit sad too. John couldn't help but wonder how that little kindness, the type he would show most decent people, was so shocking to Sherlock. Sherlock cleared his throat and seemed to snap back into himself.
Lightning flashed, illuminating them both, giving Sherlock an ethereal quality that stole John's breath. He forced himself to be still, to wait for Sherlock to be the one who decided if they were going to be something more, either way he was head over heels and in this moment he was sure that Sherlock could see it. Sherlock opened his mouth to say something and shut it with an audible clack, clearly conflicted. Another flash and his hand was moving, gently tracing the lapel of John's dressing gown. Lightning flashed again and Sherlock was standing inches from him, a questioning look in his eyes, and John smiled at him softly, allowing one hand to run through riotous curls as it had months ago, hoping Sherlock would not lose his nerve, that he knew how he was loved by John even then.The answering smile on Sherlock's face was reverent and awed, and just when John thought his heart couldn't ache any more, Sherlock kissed him and lightning crashed around them.
Sherlock smiled sadly and shrugged. "Do you play?" he asked, knowing the answer, he'd seen it in the shredded tips of his fingers but wanting to expel the heavy silence crashing on them. John held out a hand and Sherlock passed the guitar over, taking in their intimate position with a blush. "What should I play?" John asked, hoping for a specific song but knowing Sherlock he wouldn't get that. "Play a song that makes you think of someone you know" Sherlock decided after contemplating the request for a second. John nodded and swallowed his fear because he was going to play a song that reminded him of Sherlock, or rather what he wished he could say without feeling like an idiot and being rejected because that was what would happen in the end. "I can't guarantee this will be any good but here goes" John took a deep breath and Sherlock stared unabashed at him as he began to sing.
John had the mother types for the next hour and Sherlock took a minute after whooshing them both out the door to lean back against it and breathe. Both women were already well on their way to tipsy and couldn't seem to stop reminiscing about every misfortune that had ever befallen him, from his clumsy and ungainly preteen falls and failures to his young adult experimental disasters especially those involving singed brows, they were all over them, sometimes he thought they had forgotten he was there but then one would pinch his cheek (Mrs Hudson) or comment on who they could see arriving through the window and look to him for agreement on whatever judgements were doled out (Mummy) either way there had been no escape. A quiet, perfunctory knock sounded against the door at his back and Sherlock groaned.
That night John did, actually, go home. The bedsit was freezing cold, empty of anything resembling food, and downright depressing in every conceivable way - not to mention the steady thrum of rain beating down against the window, the overcast sky already adding an element of misery to the evening. He rolled into bed, staring blankly up at the ceiling.
"Are you awake?" Sherlock whispered through his chattering teeth from his place wrapped around John like a schoolbag.
Sherlock had been right of course, the son had done it and his dad had not expected an actual inquest. An assumption Sherlock could not blame him for making given the track record of Scotland yard. He opened the office door and found himself on a low balcony of sorts, overlooking the entirety of the club. His eyes were drawn instantaneously to the center of the floor where a crowd had formed around one man who was dancing so effortlessly, body moving in perfect time, swaying and writhing, lithe and yet so very masculine. Sherlock's mouth had become incredibly dry, more so when he realised the identity of the man he was ogling shamelessly. It was John, muscles threatening to break free of his shirt as he ground his hips against the air. A blonde woman stalked her way over and pressed her body up against his, attempting to emulate the movements. They were dirty, very dirty, but not to the point of being vulgar. It was intoxicating to watch. Soon a swarm of women were fondling John's arms and grinding up against him and he simply went with it all.
For one thing, it was so very far from intimate even though there had technically been a bed involved in the proceedings, and it was a bit awkward knowing that John had had to bodily put him to bed, like some sort of helpless child rather than a potential romantic partner (not that John ever appeared to be willing to make good on that potential, however). Then there was the fact that while Sherlock himself had little to no real memory of the event, John clearly did because when he mentioned it John had chuckled to himself at the memory. It was all The Woman's fault of course, naturally she couldn't help but be an utter nuisance for him. Though the chances of John lifting him from the front door to the bedroom without her little chemical interference had been slim (not impossible, and wasn't that a thought) Sherlock didn't appreciate the 'assistance'. He was perfectly capable of getting what he wanted. Eventually.
Having Sherlock pretty much announce that they were in a relationship infront of his colleagues was more surprising than anything else. Thankfully, most of his coworkers were too dim to figure that out. They assumed the younger Holmes had been referring to a meeting between them, not one would have guessed that he was in a relationship with the man.
Sherlock had his head turned towards him, eyes wide open and boring into John's. That gaze then jumped to their entwined hands and back again, prompting John to hesitantly relinquish his hold, his face burning with mortification at being caught. The fact that Sherlock's tubing had all been removed already suggested that this wasn't the first time he'd been caught today either. He owed whomever had left him sleep instead of mortifying him further big time.
The waiting room was packed with people of all shapes and sizes, all in the same situation, all connected by the circumstances of their tense silences. John peered around the room, looking for the salt and pepper haired man he vaguely recalled seeing chase behind the bed as they had wheeled Sherlock into theatre. He was nowhere to be seen.
Which was why Lucia hadn't slept a wink that night. The two of them had stumbled into their assigned room at some god forsaken hour of the morning and slid into bed next to each other. Molly had passed out soon after, but not before lamenting the fact that the first time they slept together wouldn't be at home, wouldn't have all of the trust and hope that the act clearly carried for her. It had sobered Lucia right up, though she hadn't been that drunk beforehand, and forced herself to stay awake at all costs because she was damned if they were going to lose something that meant a lot to Molly for no reason other than her lack of self restraint.
They've done this before a few times of course, but never quite like this. There was always a part of Sherlock, John knew, that he kept back, held onto and tried to hide from him while they did this, closing his eyes, turning away, but not today. Maybe because he can't, positoned as he is in John's lap, but John thinks it's something deeper, something primal and honest at the core of him that needed to be here to be freed.
Snarling, Sebastian wheeled around and curled his hand into a fist. John could only wait as he saw the appendage hurtling towards his face. It struck just above his cheekbone, and he was thankful that this wouldn't lead to a shattered cheek. Facial reconstructive surgery would cost a fortune. His head was throbbing and by the time Sebastian tired of hitting his face John could barely see, let alone speak. He'd been incredibly careful to keep his tongue out from between his teeth, but it wasn't worth risking accidentally biting it off just to make a remark. It was around then that John realised he really couldn't hear Sebastian all that well, his voice just faded into the background. Come to think of it the groggy feeling had gotten worse, the whole world was muffled and John was tired. His eyes drooped and he fought to keep them open, he had to stay awake. Sherlock needed him awake.
"Calm down Sherlock honestly you'd think you had feelings" Mycroft drawled in that infuriating manner of his, the one that made Sherlock want to simultaneously kick him in the balls and punch him in the face. Calm down. How on earth was he supposed to calm down?! He was going to die! "Funny enough Mycroft I didn't know that there was a cake around that would make you so irritable. How is that diet going?" Sherlock asked sarcastically, spinning his phone absent mindedly through his fingers. Mycroft gritted his teeth. "As unfortunate as this is for the both of us Sherlock it seems as if we will be needing each other for the foreseeable future, and I do not intend to waste my time bickering with you." Sherlock had to admit that Mycroft had a point. This was going to be the hardest thing he'd ever done, not just physically but emotionally. Loathe to admit the fact that he did have emotions, Sherlock was not so dull as to think he'd be able to walk away from this unscathed. In fact he knew he wouldn't.
He sighed inwardly. It was irritating in the extreme that he could not trust himself to focus if a small amount of John time was on offer. He'd consume John if he could, just so he would never have to be without his presence, so he could always feel their hearts beating against each other, and see that crooked smile that made his own mouth curve upward involuntarily. In the backseat of the taxi Sherlock could feel the tiredness oozing out of John and again he was left feeling guilty. John only stayed up for him, making sure he wasn't alone, guarding doors or entrances when Sherlock was absent in his own mind. He contemplated for a moment and then pressed a soft kiss on John's lips. "Thank you" John's hand curled around his waist and pulled him closer "No need, honestly" he replied, instantly sitting straighter as they trundled down the crammed streets.
In a somewhat surprising development, however, he hadn’t died of boredom just yet in spite of the hellish reality of his daily routine in the hospital.
On the fifth day, just as John was turning the corner into the corridor leading to Sherlock's room, he had spotted Mycroft Holmes closing the door, umbrella in hand. The taller man walked over, his confident stride a little weighed, the worry lines on his face a little more prominent.
The whole thing seemed like a dream, it was strange to think about his job at the best of times but this topped the list for Greg. He was walking into a psychiatric hospital that looked even from a distance like something out of a horror movie with his partner's brother who happened to work with him and insult him constantly, and they considered themselves friends, to try and save his partner from a maniac obsessed with murdering him and destroying Sherlock. If he didn't know better he'd seriously consider that they were in an episode of that show Mycroft liked... Supernatural, just short a demon and an angel. And a cool car. When they reached the entrance Sherlock reached into Greg's pocket for his torch. Greg was about to protest, loudly, when Sherlock shook his head and put a finger to his lips. Silence from here on out. They only had twenty seven minutes left.
He was already half smiling at John's good natured irritation. "Yes alright I think I'll be okay, hand it over." Grinning, Sherlock picked up a spoonful and blew on it gently before coaxing the spoon into John's mouth. "Don't want you to burn yourself again now do we?" John blinked in confusion and surprise but did not make any more to take the spoon away from Sherlock who had ended up straddled across his knees. He wondered what exactly was going on to merit this kind of attention, not that he was complaining, because he most definitely wasn't, but it felt like something was off, wrong in some way. When the bowl was nearly empty and his stomach was fit to burst, John held up a hand and pushed the spoon away. "Sherlock? What's going on? I enjoy being... Taken care of I suppose, but this isn't like you so what's up?" Sherlock stared. Eyebrows furrowed slightly: concern, Fifteen degree tilt of head to right side: confusion. "Sherlock? Still there?" John waved a hand in front of his face. "What? Oh, yes. Just want you to be well rested, there will be cases that need solving and I intend both of us to be there solving them, therefore you need to be fed and rested so your recovery is fast tracked, obviously. Shall I put this in the kitchen?" Sherlock gestured to the bowls and tray. "Might as well, but leave the tea. Oh and Sherlock?"
Once the snow speckled couple had 'finally deigned to grace us with your presence' Orabelle lead them all upstairs, chattering on as they went. "Let's see… tomorrow lunch will be served at two thirty, I invited dear Martha to join us but she's visiting her sister for the holidays so it will just be the six of us. I am assuming that you all brought presents?" she asked with a sly glance at the suitcases laying at the doors to their respective rooms. "We can do presents afterwards, and then in the evening les Holmes français ont arrivé which is perfect because I for one have been waiting an awfully long time to hear -" Greg attempted - in vain - to stifle a yawn and like the ordinary, doting mother she was Orabelle chivvied them all to bed. Within the pine scented confines of their room John splayed himself starfish style across the majority of the bed, Sherlock wouldn't be sleeping anyway. Sherlock lay with his violin clutched in his hands plucking the strings in a melancholy tone. "John?" he whispered, checking if his fiance was awake. "Yeah?" John called back to him, concern evident in his voice. Sherlock sounded unsure, and that just didn't happen. "I've been… researching." Sherlock paused dramatically and John waited for the second half of that sentence to arrive before he let his imagination run away with him. "Surrogates. I've been researching surrogates for us and I have realised that was probably not the best thing to do because most couples do this together and what not, and we're not yet married but… It's Christmas." and John, his wonderful, clever John, understood almost immediately. It was Christmas, and while they were surrounded by family and friends, there was a sense that the place was empty. He didn't want to spend another Christmas alone. "That's 'kay Sh'rlock, s'long as we make the final decision together I don't mind you doing your thing. We'll… start the whole process in motion when we get home?" Sherlock was upon him before he had the chance to register movement in the dark room.
If a rowing coach asks you what the most important seat in the boat is, don’t answer. It’s a trick question. You might say stroke, because they lead the boat or six seat, because they’re the tallest. No. That is a rookie mistake. But if you decide to answer because you’re a rebel, the coxswain will always be the most important person in the boat. No matter what, it is always, and forever will be, the coxswain.
John took a shaky breath and turned to look at him, “Sherlock. This could go one of three ways. One, you allow me to come with you. Easy, simple, the smart thing to do. Two, you put up a fight and end up leaving the flat without me. I wait a couple minutes and trail you for two blocks until you yell at me for being obvious and for bringing my gun. And three, I call Mycroft.”
Mike tells him about Sherlock. Apparently, he’s done well for himself but continues to be a recluse. Lots of high profile cases, nothing anywhere near what he and John did. He’s currently living between Baker Street and a cottage in Sussex. He keeps bees. Mike starts to talk about his constant experimentation with drugs but catches himself and stops out of respect for John.
She’s lost someone too. They bond over death. They’re first class mourners, the both of them. It’s a working relationship. John looks the other way when Mary mourns and she does the same for John. She doesn’t ask questions. John loves her for it.
Sherlock turned around to face John. Yes, assure him that you are listening. Sherlock smiled timidly. A smile flickered over John’s face when their eyes met but he quickly directed them back to the ground.
“Your rooms will be right around this hallway.” Mike said, “I called in a few favors, so they should be habitable.” Moriarty smiled and picked up his bags as he entered the room. Moran gave John a curt nod but said nothing. John shrugged, can’t win them all.
Second seat is like the stroke seat, but in the bow. They set swing pace after bow seat. Bow seat is the last seat. Both second and bow are smaller than the others, as they are located in a thinner part of the boat, they must have a good sense of balance.
“We’re still bonded, Sherlock. Having to hear your song at your funeral hurt and...God. I-” John’s breath caught. “The bond should have dissolved, platonic bonds are weaker than most. But it didn’t but I forced myself to believe that it was just me. When you came back, I thought it was because you weren’t actually dead. Because that would be the logical thing right? The smart thing? Oh christ. But still- Sherlock?”
all the rowing stuff in the beginning - basically irrelevant, if you're curious, go ahead and ask but it's not going to prevent you from understanding where the story is going.
“Sorry.” John said, “Stayed up late trying to figure out why my organic chemistry homework wouldn’t balance. Speaking of, I must look a right mess.” He looked down at his clothes.
Mary gets the treatment that they can’t afford. Whenever John visits, she assures him that she’s getting better. Sometimes he’ll bring the baby and Mary will hold her. They are happy for a short while. But John sees through all of it.
Sherlock has a knack for making everyone around him go mad. His return is no different. There is shouting and throwing and misuse of illegal firearms. John has missed this but decides not to say so.
The characters will be rowing the Boat Race. It is an annual boat race between the Oxford University Boat Club and the Cambridge University Boat Club. It is rowed between two eights on the Thames River in London. Oxford rows on the Thames but Cambridge rows at the Ely Boathouse, on the River Great Ouse. All in all, there are four boats selected to row the race. The reserve crews, Isis and Goldie, and the final or Blue crews.
“But then I wondered- I thought, maybe it’s not platonic.” his voice trailed off and John laughed. Embarrassed? Nervous? Onset of hypothermia? “Maybe-- maybe Sherlock Holmes is in love with me.”
John’s first symphony was titled “Pain” which made sense because his adolescence was rife with it. Or at least thats what the conductors used to say. After Harry came out as a lesbian, their father became uncontrollable and John’s mother seriously considered severing their bond. For their wellbeing, they left the village and had their music transferred to Royal Music Hall in London.
“Definitely not.” Holmes shook his head. What the hell was that supposed to mean? John resisted the urge to bang his head against the locker.
Rowers cannot see where they are going since they face backwards. The only person in the boat who is facing forwards is the cox. We’re meant to steer the boat correctly and not hit buoys or row over logs. And keep in mind that there also happens to be a six-foot stroke blocking our view.
John endured the bus ride by expertly putting his workout bag on his lap. Holmes was coerced into sitting next to him by Bill, who had shot John an obvious wink. Holmes raised an eyebrow but didn’t attempt to engage John in any conversation for the rest of the ride.
Bill and Kav walked in and took the last two seats on portside. John went over to them to explain the workout written on the whiteboard.
A very young Sherlock Holmes promised himself that he would never go through that sort of pain. John Watson openly challenged that promise. Sherlock was utterly fucked from the very beginning, because this John Watson wasn’t even the bonding type. Or so he liked to say.
Bonding. It was a very serious word. In ancient times. it was considered fate when your harmony matched with some poor soul’s melody. It was largely by accident, if anyone was going to be honest. No one was really someone’s destined, some people were born well suited to several songs and some people weren’t. Most bonds were platonic anyway. People no longer romanticized bonding, unless they wrote screenplays for some BBC period show.
John had been waiting on the stoop of Holmes’ Montague Street flat for what seemed like hours. Holmes later informed him that it was only thirty minutes. He had groaned when he saw the moving van parked outside his building but shut up when he realized that Holmes wasn’t going to call the movers off
John swore when his phone pinged. Idiots. You’d think that two of the best rowers this side of the continent would be able to handle a bunch of university students. He rolled his eyes and left Donovan to finish with the boat rigging and told her he’d check the lateral pitch later.
John swallowed and nodded. Holmes had been relatively friendly during practice, joking with his partner and laughing at the terrible jokes John cracked. He had smiled at John when he caught him looking at him while he loosened his oarlock. John had blushed and looked away.
Dimmock is the coxswain coach, which is pretty self explanatory. Adler, though, is the Athlete Development Coach. There are eight coaches in all and I will be introducing them as the fic progresses.
“So what’s the deal with you grabbing Holmes’ dick and then tripping on his shampoo?” Bill asked, his head trying to fight its way through the opening at the top of his shirt. If it had happened at any other time, John would be laughing his head off.
