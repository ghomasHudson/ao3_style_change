Dean who walks towards Castiel, shirtless, still in his jeans and bare feet with a look on his face that is anything other than annoyed unless Dean smiles under hooded eyes when he is annoyed which he doesn’t as Castiel has seen that face more times than he cared to count.
The guy was like Dean, as long as his daughter was loved, fed, had a roof over her head and laughed more than cried he’d take that as doing a good job but yeah, easy on the eyes too.
“You draw me, I think that makes it my business.” Dean takes the pad and sits down beside Cas. He always sits too close, almost half on top of Cas, not that he minds. Even covered in sweat and rainwater Dean wants to be close to him.
“I just want to spend time with you Castiel. You’d swear I was holding his books hostage sometimes.” He ruffles Castiel’s hair with his sugary hand. Castiel is too used to it do much about it. He’ll get the sugar out later. Dean’s smile falls a fraction.
Cas stepped out of his way, putting his hand out gesturing Dean to take a seat. Dean moved past him, taking stock of whether to sit on the chair or bed. He opted for the bed, moving to lean against the top of Cas’ bed once his shoes and jacket were off. When Cas felt he had stopped moving he went to straddle Dean’s lap to continue what he had initially planned on doing which was to get Dean’s cock in his hand.
“I gave him a bunch of quarters.” Cas replied, staring at how tight Dean had his wrist, almost white knuckling it, losing some circulation in it. He knew Dean was strong, but this level was unexpected. “You’re strong.”
Cas dropped his head, pretty much shaking at this stage. Dean kinda hated seeing him like this, completely powerless and overcome with what Dean could clearly see was anxiety. The hyper-vigilance exhausting him and keeping him awake at the same time.
Dean moved over to the bed, carefully maneuvered himself down onto his stomach trying to keep the thoughts that the last time he lay down like this on Cas’ bed he had giving him a blow job. The pain was a good distraction for that. He winced again once fully down.
“You take it black?” Cas took a mug from his cupboard, poured in some coffee from the machine and handed it to Dean. Dean took a sip. It was high quality coffee, none of that instant cheap stuff that Dean had stored away in his cupboard. This stuff was like cocaine, pure and Columbian. He hummed as his mouth filled with the smoothness of it. Dean took another sip and closed his eyes to let himself savour every aroma.
“Relax your jaw,” Cas instructed. He moved his hand behind his head to take a hold of Dean’s face, moving his thumb to the point in his jaw by his ear that needed to be unhinged. “Here, relax this part.” He pressed in and Dean slacked it a bit almost immediately. His ability to take commands had Cas merging again with that side of him. “Good, you’re doing so good.” He praised, thumb feeling for his cock inside of Dean’s mouth. The slight stubble under his thumb tickled a bit but it seemed Dean liked it, humming more.
He feels Dean chuckle, it vibrates his chest. Arms come around and pull Cas closer, till their chest to chest and there’s no space between them just like Cas wants it, needs it. He breathes in Dean’s scent, leather and stale smoke and pine because that’s his shower gel and Dean showered in Cas’ this morning. It smells like home. His new home.
The Russian used his elbows to lean up to focus on Dean. He was yet to move from the lap. Cas’ brows furrowed in confusion. What he had to be confused about, Dean didn’t know.
The AB guys dropped Dean’s arms on command. Alastair put his hands up like he’d just been caught by the guards and not another inmate. His whole stature went from threatening to afraid in seconds. When Alastair moved, he saw Cas standing in the middle of the shower room, hands crossed over his chest. Those eyes staring at Alastair with such grit and anger Dean’s surprised the Nazi didn’t shit himself. They left without saying a single word.
One of them in particular was looking at Dean like he hadn’t eaten in about a month. It made his skin crawl. Alastair, he remembered his name being, charged for human trafficking though word around was that he was a known rapist in his town, not that he was convicted of that. That was all that Dean needed, a rapist looking at Dean like his next target. He wanted to hide his face in his hands, crawl under the table. He did the opposite, ate his food like he hadn’t a care in the world. Don’t let them see you sweat.
The silence was getting to him, not hearing Cas voice, his praises and commands was eating away at Dean the more he ground himself down. He wanted to know he was going a good job, wanted to hear how wrecked Cas was from him, wanted to be Cas’ good boy. He couldn’t take it anymore, to hell with the game.
He couldn’t respond. Too wrecked from what Cas was doing to him, always turning to putty in those attentive hands, knowing exactly how to tear Dean down even after their time apart. He was holding onto the pillow like his life depended on it, tethering him to their cell.
“I mean I think about all of them,” Dean let slip. He felt the heat rise on the back of his neck admitting that. Cas smirked. Half of Cas’ tattoos weren’t on visible, hidden under his clothes. “I mean, eh, the skull.” Dean finished up the bandage, tied it in a knot on his palm and tucked it under. He turned Cas’ hand back over, ran his thumb over the canines.
He chuckled at his phone, imagining Dean furiously typing that in the middle of the grocery store he stood in. The pepperoni pizza incident brought him endless humour, refusing to let it go merely due to the fact that it riled his friend up so much.
It warmed up Dean’s hands, the smell was strong, and he remembered how his whole sexual desire was triggered, by this damn coffee.
to take in. Sam explained it well, didn’t miss any bits out and went back to reiterate things if they were of import. In the three or so months he had been away the whole of Purgatory had been turned on its head and had yet to find its feet again by the sounds of it.
“Oh, it’s gonna take lot more than that handsome.” Gabriel winks at him and takes the drinks. Dean watches him fade into the dim light of the Roadhouse. He searches for that crow’s nest. Half convinces himself that Cas’ eyes might flare in the dark like a cat. A customer barks an order at him, and he falls back into work hoping that Cas will come to the bar to take the next order.
“You don’t have a sign on your damn back Sam that says ripe for fucking.” He snapped. His voice accidentally raising.
“I would like to talk to you about something, about someone, my neighbor.” He stutters out ineloquently. Even talking about Dean makes him flustered. Jessica snaps her head up to him and crosses and uncrosses her legs. She wasn’t expecting this.
It was harder this time to do that. The other times he managed fine, perhaps as this was the first time, he had come he was finding it more difficult to return. He wondered if Dean had this difficulty after he came. The difficulty not to grab his friend and bring him in close, bring him over the edge that he brought Cas.
Suddenly with the camera on Cas decided to taunt his friend, blame the alcohol, blame the arousal, blame the fact he knew Dean was competitive and Cas wanted to use it to his advantage. “You going to show me what you got straight boy.”
“You should go clean up.” Cas told him. He grabbed a top over the back of his chair and slipped it on. His friend seemed normal, as normal as Cas could be. That was a good sign at least. Dean would feel normal too, after he washed off his cum and got over his afterglow.
The Russian pressed his mouth to Sam’s temple to soothe him then turned his attention to Castiel who sat across from them reading.
“You’re beautiful,” Cas whispered in his ear, slowing down to press against Dean’s sweet spot to bring him over the edge. “I can’t wait to fuck you Dean, can’t wait to see my cock inside of you, filling you up and then I’m going to plug you, keep you ready for me, always open, always ready for my cock.”
“Sam!” Dean shouted out to his brother. Sam knew the tone, knew it meant drop whatever he was doing and come out to him. He followed his brother, barging their way through the inmates to get to the kitchen before all hell broke loose.
Those words echo for Castiel, words he has told himself over the years since leaving Heaven’s Little Angel’s. “I share that sentiment.” Castiel agrees. He gives Dean’s hand a light squeeze to show he hears him and lets it go.
How in the hell was Dean supposed to give Cas details about his blow job verbally and not get hard again? He picked up before it went to voicemail.
As before Cas slipped his fingers into Dean’s waist bands to take his clothes off, Dean helped this time shoving them down to his thighs. “Someone’s eager.” His friend smirked.
He dropped the glass into the sink and took his suds covered hand to Cas’ face, pulling him in for a bruising kiss. A kiss he hoped showed how freaking much he wanted this man, wanted this life and everything in between. Cas froze for a split second then kissed back, chapped lips pressing with as much enthusiasm into Dean’s. He felt his whole body heat up, how one man, one kiss could do that to Dean he wanted to spend his whole life figuring out.
The internal struggle in Dean’s mind ruined any leftover sexual endorphins from last night. He moved to the edge of Cas’ bed, noticing a glass of water and his glasses perched on the side. Those weren’t there the night before. More of Cas looking after him, keeping him hydrated another thing he needed to make sure he did after last night’s sexcapades. He gulped down the water, lukewarm from probably sitting there for some time. Cas must have had an early exam or paper to hand in.
So yeah, Castiel’s life had turned out ok. He didn’t have much to complain about all things considered. Though that was about to change when his current neighbor of two years decided to move out and a ‘for rent’ sign was stuck outside of his apartment building.
Cas is back quickly with a green tin box in his hands. He’s just in that loose white top again and a pair of boxers, his hair in array. He really did wake Cas up from his sleep. Cas takes the other stool out and opens the box, rummaging through it to take out what he needs
After dinner John announced that he had to go to the Campbell’s to pick up the fishing equipment because he had lent it to Dean’s Grandad a few weeks back. Sam and Mary said they’d go along for the spin. Dean declined, claiming exhaustion and the need for an early night. Cas stayed back with Dean.
Cas shifted on the bed. He couldn’t see what was happening, but he could feel it. The bed dipped on either side of him, then Cas’ dropped his weight to the back of Dean’s thighs. He had a Russian sitting on his thighs, even with their friendship, mutual orgasms and prag agreement there was a slight anxiety in him from being this vulnerable. His body had tensed. Cas clocked it.
Memories of before last night are also roaming around in his mind, nights spent shivering under the thin blankets of the orphanage as the rain dripped in through the faulty window beside Castiel’s bed. A flashback of Balthazar mentioning Heaven’s Little Angels comes into his mind, Dean is in it. He must have heard. He wonders if Dean will bring it up. Wonder if he should be the one to bring it up. He is unsure if he wants to dredge up those memories, left them in a box buried in his mind for a reason.
“For you?” he places the glasses of prepared drinks onto the bar. Cas nods. Dean hadn’t been wrong about his beer choice. He hopes his spirit choice also holds true. He reaches for a bottle of bourbon and triple sec and fashions Cas an apple sour. Dean pours it into an old-fashioned glass from the cocktail shaker and adds it to the line of drinks for Cas.
A hand pressed onto his chest, stumbling him back to sit on the edge of the bed and away from those lips he wasn’t finished with. Dean took the top in his hand again, yanking Cas down to get them back instead of going with the top, Cas ducked his head through the hole and used the opportunity to take it off, leaving him bare for Dean to see standing in front of him. It was a smooth move he had to admit.
Cas.” He groaned when Cas pressed his palm to his groin. “If you wanna hear me cum, you might wanna get this show on the road.”
He had to close his eyes, careful not to get whisked away again. Dean made it difficult. “You always are.”
Cas perked up at that, the regret being placed by intrigue. His blue eyes squinted like he wasn’t buying what Dean was selling. He took his feet off the table, planted them on the ground in front of Cas and leaned over to really sell it. From this close Dean could see the depths of the blue in Cas’ eyes, like an abyss. He could easily fall into and never come out. If only they hadn’t known each other in here and Dean could show Cas who he really was.
That was when Dean thought it would be a good idea to drink a bottle of whiskey on the walk to Gabriel’s. They shared it and by the time they got there Cas’ body was loosening up.
They switched out their breakfasts, Sam took Dean’s banana, Dean took Sam’s extra slice of toast. His brother didn’t like to load up on bread, not good for his health or whatever.
He let go of the duvet, hand reaching to touch Dean then he remembered where he was, who he was, the parameters of what was happening and dropped it, hand gripping the top of his thigh instead. The noise caught Dean’s attention.
Cas moved his mouth back up to Dean’s mouth, planting kisses as he went because Cas apparently liked to be cute in the heat of the moment. “Hmm, I had my doubts, but this…” Cas pushed in further making Dean whine when he found that sweet spot. “…this is better than anything I could have imagined. So needy, so eager…” he stroked it again and again watching Dean fall apart at the seams on the desk.
“Cas,” he broaches carefully, rounding the tree and getting down on the ground to kneel in front of Cas, “Look man, I’m sorry I shouldn’t have…”
“Who would believe me anyway?” he started to draw circles on Cas’ shoulders with his thumb, trying to calm him down further now that he apparently had permission to do this. “Hey guys, guess who just spent the night cuddling with Castiel cause he’s afraid of the weather.”
Gabriel walked out from the kitchen. Cloth swung over his shoulder, lollipop in his mouth grinning like he was anywhere but in Purgatory.
It didn’t take long for Cas to come up behind him. Russian inked arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him into his chest. This was it. Cas claiming Dean, a display to show Gordon he wasn’t allowed touch Dean if he knew what was good for him.
“Yeah right Cas, you’re funny,” His hand went for Cas’ waistband. “Look I’ll give you a hand job if it means my debt is cleared and Sam doesn’t end up as a blood drop on Balthazar’s neck or whatever you had planned on doing.”
He could lie to his brother, his brother who was a lawyer and would probably smell the lie a mile away or he could tell the truth to his brother, his brother who was a lawyer and would probably have a listen to a five minute argument on how much of a bad idea it was to sleep with your kid’s best friend’s Dad. His options weren’t great.
“Dean.” There was a hand on his shoulder, a body in his view sitting on the ground in front of him. One he’d dream out countless times. He could make out the stars on a chest, the top of the cross in the center. He couldn’t bring himself to look any higher. His dreams wouldn’t let him see Cas’ face, wouldn’t let him see those eyes he missed on him.
Cas shook his head. He leaned back not saying anymore on the matter, hands cascaded down Dean’s back and over his thighs, spreading his legs apart for Cas to sit between them and then his hands were gone and it unsettled Dean. He turned his head to look at Cas. The man was pouring lube into his hand, wrapping a large amount around his fingers. The sight dried up Dean’s mouth.
“To me, yeah,” Sam handed him a book that was near the section he was in. “I’ve known you my whole life Dean. The only other time I’ve seen you look at someone like you look at Cas was Lisa.”
Cas hitched his breath on the impact. Hot slicked tongue ran along his shaft causing him to take a fist of the comforter beside him to hold onto something that wasn’t Dean. He held that hitched breath till Dean started his descend back down bringing his tongue to the base of his cock. It was slow, tentative. He could sense Dean taking his time, making sure he did it right, listening to the order perfectly.
Dean brought him close to the edge. He felt his orgasm being carved out. Hand crafted by his friend. Cas started to pull Dean’s mouth away. “I’m close.” He mumbled, not trusting himself to not say his friend’s name. “You need to—”
Cas didn’t respond, just filled each tumbler with a double and slid it over to Dean. He downed it in one. It was smooth, slightly burned his throat making him hiss but it was needed. Cas was already pouring himself another. Dean slid his glass over to be refilled and he downed the following one Cas gave him too. That one burned less. A relieving sigh came out of him, the weight in his stomach coated with some decent whiskey would probably help things.
He took a few deep breaths, slapped his face, he could do this. He had to do this. Dean walked into his cell, clocking Cas lying on his bed, book in his hands relaxing. He peered over his book at Dean, watching Dean attentively with those cold blues as Dean maneuvered himself onto Cas’ bed, into Cas’ lap, legs on either side of his waist.
“You got me a pie?” Cas asks ignoring formalities of greeting. Dean steadies his hand on the door trying not to give away the nerves he was experiencing. He didn’t get nervous, Dean is smooth dammit, people get nervous around him, not the other way around. Cool and collected is Dean’s natural body stance and Cas is ruining all of his years of mastering it.
“Have fun.” Cas said and watched Sam run over to a pinball machine before he got up from the booth making a beeline for the bathroom, hoping he’d be able to have some fun of his own.
He couldn’t cope with that. His mind flooded with images of what he wanted to do, wanted to shove Cas on the bed, let Cas put his mouth on him, his hands, anything. He wanted anything and everything the Russian would give him, so damn gone on his touch. He wanted to be loud, so loud that the whole block would hear how hard he’d come for Cas. He wanted to be brave, not give a fuck they’d they hear him crumbling and falling apart in his cell over and over again till the sun came up if Cas would let him.
That comment woke up his dick. Add it to the growing list of phrases Cas said that make Dean hot and bothered. He coughed to give himself more time on how to even respond to something like that in a non-sexual way. It was Cas’ fault he had sex brain at all, making him go out on dates and get blowjobs and then make him come home and re-tell him the story. Oh god, he was a lost cause when it came to this man. By that thought alone it looked like if Cas said jump Dean would respond with how high.
Sam had graciously decided to join he and Charlie towards the end of rec-time after spending the majority of it with Gabriel. They didn’t share a cell, so they had less time to do, well, what they needed to do. Dean refused to acknowledge his brother was fucking a Russian. He didn’t need those mental images on top of the actual view of the sex glazed look on Sam’s face as he sat down beside them.
Growing up in the orphanage he had learned a few other tricks, he cranes higher to reach for the phone, distracting Dean enough to pinch Dean just below his armpit with his other hand. It isn’t hard, just enough to shock Dean and it works.
“Go on then.” Cas moved his eyes between Dean’s and his cock. Dean turned around in order to take Cas in his mouth. Cas bit back moans as Dean sucked him down, it didn’t take long before Cas was spilling into his mouth, hips rising off the bed and fingers digging into Dean’s scalp.
So, this one, Bumble, was less about DTF though that didn’t stop Dean from getting the odd dick pic every once in a while. He had only been on it a few days and when boredom struck at work or in bed he’d start scrolling, swiping right and left almost like a game. He kept forgetting people were on the other side of it. People who were also swiping left and right. Dean had gotten a few matches, drummed up some conversations, nothing made him eager enough to go on a date, at least not yet. His newest match was with a woman, so he'd wait for her to start the conversation. Bumble rules apparently.
Dean cocked his head to the side, almost imitating Cas’ no doubt. He should keep walking, he knew he should keep walking and yet his legs refused to move, stuck on the pavement. Whoever Dean was with noticed him staring and whipped his head around. It caught Cas’ eye. He was met with a younger face, there were some similarities to Dean. He had to be a family member. His smile was bright, innocent and he waved at Cas with enthusiasm.
.” She drew out the last word, like her mind was thinking of how needy got, more so than what the videos showed. He needed to put an end to this conversation before she managed to pull more information out of him.
When the count was called Cas got off of Dean’s lap, walked outside the cell like nothing out of the ordinary happened.
Cas touches Dean’ kneecap with his hand, gently pushing it, a small request. Dean shifts one of his legs wider for Cas to slot in between them, hoping that’s what he wanted from him. It’s all quiet requests and silent stares he’s learning to decipher. If Cas could just give him the key to break it. Then there it is, what he’s been looking for. Dean feel like he’s on show again, a show just for Cas. He licks his lips.
Charlie had strategically managed to get herself extra time in the playground in the park after pre-school. Dean tried to keep it down to half an hour. She bargained an extra fifteen minutes for helping Dean sort out the recycling. She knew her Dad well. The chill was getting worse. It wasn’t like Dean was jumping around the jungle gym manic like his daughter. He had his butt parked on the cold bench trying to breathe heat into his hands. He'd bring a hat next time. The winter was fast approaching. No doubt it would snow this year.
At breakfast word had spread to the rest of his friends that his new celly was Castiel. They wanted to know everything. Dean had some questions of his own too. He had been too scared to even attempt to start a conversation with Castiel on his own after barking orders at him. He was surprised he still had all his finger nails and teeth.
Charlie tried to get the brothers to talk, even Bobby tried to drum up some conversation. It didn’t work, they weren’t in a talking mood. Sam answered out of being polite, Dean didn’t have that problem. He had that vacant thousand mile stare out into nothing as he inhaled his fourth cigarette. He filled his lungs as much as he could, till it hurt, till it burned to feel something.
“I’m waiting for Benny to get back before I grab the next one.” He explained, hoping his idle behaviour wasn’t the cause for Cas to check up on him. The guy was terrifying. Cas just took out his packet of smokes, lit a cigarette and handed it to Dean. He put the smoke between his lips without complaint, a welcomed warmth in his lungs and exhaled into the wind.
“What? This isn’t what you wanted?” Dean whispered in his ear. “An out and out boyfriend? Look, here I am, out in broad daylight about to get you off. Thought you wanted this Cas."
Cas gets into the habit of straddling Dean when he’s in a fowl mood. He doesn’t care where they are, who’s around or what’s happening. All he wants is to be wrapped around Dean and he finds himself doing it on the bleachers one lunch time.
“He wasn’t in a talking mood, was reading this notebook.” Dean answered, not a complete lie. A slight blurring of the truth, hopefully Sam wouldn’t pick up on it too much.
“Yes, I like it there.” Cas’ body untensed. Silence fell around them. It was peaceful even if the sound of Purgatory was anything but outside of their four walls. If Dean concentrated hard enough, he could cancel out the noise and home in on nothing but Cas.
Cas lifted the side of his mouth in a quiet smile, eyes slightly darkening as the message made its way into his mind. He put his noodles down. Dean followed, even leaving his beer on the table now that Cas appeared to be on the same page as him. He watched as Cas removed the editing software and just loaded up the video on its own without any distractions on the sides or on the picture, just Dean and Cas front and center stage.
He watched Dean get up on the bed, moving on his knees slowly careful not to knock the laptop around too much. His approach had Cas’ body spiking with heat. His neglected cock asking for touch already. The likely hood of this lasting their usual five minutes was optimistic at best. Dean moved between Cas’ parted legs, sitting back on his calves not saying a word. He was nervous. Perhaps Cas over-estimated Dean’s willingness to try new things. He sat up on his elbows, making his way to a sitting position. “We don’t have to—”
The guards called them back in for rec-time in the block. Dean hopped off the bench he was sitting on, walking back alone to his cell to hide out till dinner. It wasn’t a great idea to be alone. His brain wasn’t operating on great ideas. He heard Charlie and Sam call out to him to wait up, but he wanted to be by himself. It didn’t last for long.
It was 8.45am. As usual, they were cutting it close. She loved it when the playground was empty, felt like her own kingdom for her to rule. If Dean wasn’t terrified of the pre-school teachers, he’d let her stay on it all day. The gravel shifted under the weight of his boots to get to her by the time she slid down. Her arms were up in the air and a loud squeal came out of her. Dean bent down and scooped her up into his arms to take her away.
Only one person could have given him those. His stomach twisted. Cas marked him, held his head so tightly he bruised Dean’s neck. Had he been holding on that tight? Dean couldn’t remember, probably too hazed with having a dick in his mouth to register it. No one had ever bruised him before during sex, at least not an actual person, objects sure but a person, never. Then again, he’d never been with someone strong enough who could do that, never been in a situation where bruising would even be on the table. This whole rough sex was new to him.
It looked like heated words were exchanged between the two and that was enough to get Cas moving. Whatever he had interrupted he didn’t mean to, though seeing Dean outside of school was rare, considering he had been away all week. There was relief Dean at least still existed on this plain. He was past the diner, about the turn left when Dean called out to him.
“Thought so,” He stepped over Dean to put back some of the returned books to the area Dean was hiding out in. “You do realise being his prag means you can drop the whole straight act around him.”
That resulted in more fighting. Dean adopted the silent treatment more than once to show Cas how done he had been with his bullshit Bratva and the rules attached to it. That earned him the chipped tooth. He gave Cas one too. They called it even and fucked in the storeroom of the kitchen.
Cas scooped Charlie out from Dean’s arms with ease, rested Charlie across his arms as if she were flying. “Let’s fly brave knight!” he flew her back into the sitting room.
That it felt like in that orphanage Gabriel and he were prisoners of war, captured by the opposition and the only thing keeping their hopes up was that one day they’d be freed. The days turned into months turned into years and slowly they broke Gabriel and him down, bit by bit, feather by feather their wings broke under the almighty boot that was Heaven’s Little Angels. That under the guise of religion and faith the nuns and priests in that hell could do just about whatever they wanted, and no one came to save them.
When Dean got back for 3pm pick up Cas was in his usual spot, two bag packs at his feet watching their daughters play hopscotch. Claire’s being the galaxy one, girl had a thing for stars and space and Charlie the sparkly fire engine red one to make her hair. Dean joined him, hands shoved in his pockets and collar up turned to stop the chill getting into him too much.
His friends dropped the humour, hearing the seriousness in Cas’ voice. Smiles replaced with concerned looks. Gabriel gripped his shoulder. “Seriously, you two ok?”
Firm hands gripped tight on his ass, enough to make Cas’ presence known and then some. Dean bit into the pillow, careful not to make noise. Cas leaned over him. His body pressed Dean into the mattress, nose brushing the side of Dean’s face. “Give me your mouth.”
Not rising to Dean’s comment Cas gestured his hand for Dean to follow him upstairs. He brought Dean into his bedroom. He wasn’t expecting guests, not that he particularly cared what Dean thought of his room. It was non-descript. A double bed shoved to the corner, his desk filled with his current drawing and his walls filled with his own sketches or art he found interesting. Dean appeared to be taking it in.
“Well aren’t you just catnip.” Gabriel flirted shamelessly. Dean chuckled at it, scratching the back of his neck on impulse. He clearly needed to wear this shirt more often, twice in one day Dean was on a roll. Cas gave his brother a threatening look. His brother put his hands up in the air, like a gun was being pointed at him. To be fair, if looks could kill. Cas’ would be the ones to do it.
Dean takes the cue, follows suit and takes his phone out of his pocket to load up a game, Candy Crush or Words with Friends, something, anything. The neighbor then moves to a free machine. Dean clocks they got ages left still on their own washing.
He emerged from the water, lifted his head, blinked back his eyes that he didn’t realise had flooded with water. He sniffed sharply, put the heels of his palms into his eyes to stop the water from falling.
“I’m calling it a night.” His brother stretched in front of him. The lurch grew more inches over the years, filled out more, hair behind his ears instead of over his face. He can still see his little brother in there sometimes. The years hadn’t been kind to them. Purgatory weathered them more than they liked to admit at times.
“You have to kneel.” Charlie told them. Claire went easily and Cas followed, putting one knee on the ground awaiting to be anointed by Dean’s daughter. He had to try and hold back the chuckles.
Cas stuck his hand out for Dean to shake it. It felt like he was as reluctant about this as Dean was. That was somewhat comforting. They were friends and at times Dean felt they were more than that, but this was going to change their entire relationship.
“What can I say? I’m a catch.” He joked. It was a message from Benny. They had been talking old cars, Dean told him about his Baby. Benny had responded saying he’d bet Dean looked good behind the wheel. Dean didn’t know how to respond to it. Cas had been leaning over, being nosey and reading it.
He could now. Drunken Cas was always up for new things with Dean, wanting to show him the finer things in life, like frottage. Cas moved closer, getting the angle right for Dean, thankful they were the same height to pull his off. “Give me your hand.” It was presented to him immediately, palm up. He smiled at how receptive Dean was to his orders, made him think of all the other things he could get Dean to do, how far did that submission go? Thoughts for later. Pulling what spit he had in his mouth, he dropped it into Dean’s hand. “Ok, that should be enough.”
His daughter looked at them, trying to decide what titles to give them. She had a great imagination, which usually meant it took her too long to decide, too many options to work with. Dean got down beside her to help her out, whispering some suggestions in her ear that he thought would be suiting to their friends. She seemed to like them and stood to attention, embodying a queen who was about to anoint. Dean stood tall too, playing along with his daughter who was clearly enjoying herself. He could feel Cas smirking up at him.
Dean’s eyes brighten up more than Cas has seen ever before. He makes a point after that to show Dean any new drawings he does of him just in case he wants to keep them too.
‘Sorry, just,” Dean shrugged. His eyes looked behind Sam to find Cas but someone new was at the table that caught his attention. “Wait, who’s the new guy?” he nodded his head towards the table. Sam turned to follow Dean’s stare. He noticed his brother lift his mouth in the tiniest of smiles.
Sammy was set, all of their Dad’s inheritance (Dean gave his half to his little brother) and his scholarship meant that Dean didn’t have to worry about him anymore. He didn’t have to worry about his baby brother, and he didn’t have to worry about his Father, so he didn’t really know who he was. Identity crisis at the ripe age of 25. Now he was coming up to 30, he needed to re-evaluate his life or whatever that kid Garth had told him over a couple of beers on the other side of the country.
Sure, sober Dean did have a minor freak out about the plan initially, that was till the heating got shut off and he was sick of having cold showers. The summer heat meant their apartment wasn’t cold, but Dean loved a hot shower and if all it took was his friend jacking him off to get some cash to pay the bill then it would be totally worth it. Besides Cas was the one to bring it back up after the house party, anyway, bolting into Dean’s room saying he’d had enough of the lack of hot water and unless Dean learned how to not burn pots that they’d need to do what Meg suggested.
“I thought they might be nice mixed in.” Dean shrugged. He leaned against the counter watching Cas arrange the ingredients in an order that probably made sense but was lost on Dean. “You need me to call out the recipe?” he fished his phone out.
Images of Dean under him, his pink lips parted and panting out Cas’ name while he tore him apart like he had done to many others. It flooded his brain. It was all he could think of. What Dean would look like if Cas got his hands on him? Does he bite his lips when he comes? Would his whole-body shudder if Cas took him in his mouth?
He even found himself telling Cas about how he ended up in Purgatory, something he rarely spoke out. How his Dad was obsessed with finding the person who killed their Mom, how once he found the bastard, tortured him and killed him the police showed up because their Dad had been reckless. Dean being the loyal son that was took the gun off of his Dad when the cops raided the place, not that it mattered. They were all charged. Their Dad admitted everything, even admitted to crimes the boys had done in order to get Sam and Dean a lighter sentence than he did. Any sentence would have been lighter than a death sentence.
When he had arrived to pick up Charlie after her first day she was running around after a blonde-haired girl. Dean assumed she left her bag pack in the classroom till he spotted it at the foot of the man from that morning. He pushed back those encroaching fantasies to go up and meet the guy. They introduced themselves, made small talk that Dean was more than happy to go along with as Charlie ran around full of smiles and glee. It seemed Cas was too, though not much of a talker unless prompted. Dean was more than happy to prompt.
Cas always got his run in after school. He had to, the only way to burn off the energy of sitting in classrooms hour after hour listening to teachers drone on about SATs and college applications. It felt like it simmered just under the surface, bubbling away till the bell rang for 4pm and he could finally expel it. He used to run on the track at school till the coach spotted him and tried to coax him onto the track team. Not a chance. Cas didn’t need to be a part of anything, being a part of an academic institution was enough for him.
“Dean, this is my older brother Gabriel.” Cas reluctantly introduced them. Dean reached out his hand and shook it with the guy. Cas never mentioned a brother before in their playground chats. Dean talked about Sam non-stop. It was odd though the reluctance in the introduction made Dean think there was a reason why he never mentioned this guy before.
“What in God’s name is a peach emoji?” he mumbled to himself. He sent a WhatsApp message to Sam to see if he knew. His brother took too long to respond. He noticed the messages he had sent to Cas were under his brother. Charlie left her sword there after the party, so he messaged Cas to get him to bring it to pre-school.
He reached up to touch Dean’s shoulder, fighting the urge to touch his face. Faces are intimate. Dean’s warmed his palm. He put some weight under his touch, silently suggesting Dean to move back down his body. Dean went, moving back on his hands for his face to be level to Cas’ cock lying on his stomach.
The two of them quickly looked down, realising they had put on each other’s tops by accident. Dean’ in Cas’ plain navy t-shirt and Cas in Dean’s worn out rock band top. Cas was about to remove it when Dean stopped him.
And fuck did he. A hip raising, breath catching, white spots in his vision orgasm ripped from him like he was exorcised right in the middle of his bedroom. His top was ruined, his hand was covered, and he couldn’t give one damn about it because he could hear Cas cumming, every vibration from his chest crawled into Dean’s ear, finding a new home in his wank bank.
He knew his brother was beside him, his head hanging low, hair covering his face and tears starting to fall down on his cheeks. If he reached out, he could touch his brother’s shoulder, but he couldn’t, his limbs were heavy, weighing him down like they were made of lead.
Cas shrugged as a response. It wasn’t like he went about screaming it, then again Cas didn’t go about doing much at school, apart from walking and only answering when being directly spoken to which was rare. Teachers and school peers tended to leave him alone. He preferred it. This was the longest conversation he had had with someone who wasn’t a family member or a hook up in years.
It might have been Cas’ first date, but this is not Cas’ first kiss unless he’s read it enough times in books to understand what it is. Cas kisses him like he has the biggest quench and Dean is the first sight of water in miles. His hands move up Cas’ chest, flitting over his shirt collar up to take his face to tilt it slightly for a better angle.
Dean crossed the space, taking Cas’ shoulder and pulling him back so they could face each other, jaw tight and eyes fixed. “You fucking know what, telling my family about this guy you’re seeing? You think that was funny or something?”
His hopes of being calm and collected about this went out the window when Cas joined him outside of their cell for count. Part of him had hoped the Russian forgot Dean had asked, give Dean more time to psych himself out of it. All the reasons he had to not do this were blown out of the water with the simple fact of if he didn’t Gordon was going to gut him and Dean kinda liked being alive.
Cas would very much like Dean’s mouth on his cock too. Not that he would admit that aloud. His newfound attraction for his friend still in its infant stages and Cas did not want to rule out this attraction might boil down to the alluring side of touching something that he shouldn’t i.e. a straight guy. It pained him to think he was
Alastair produced a shiv from behind his back. A sharpened end of a toothbrush with a razor blade attached to it. Dean froze at the sight of it.
He grabbed what he assumed was a blanket of Claire’s given its cosmic design and draped it over the both of them. Cas stirred, turning over on his side to get closer to Dean. His head nuzzled under Dean’s chin, arm around his middle. It made his heart swell with affection.
He had never known Cas to be competitive but fucking hell Cas was on a mission to win this game. It was hard not to make a sound. The way Cas kept palming over Dean’s erection was slowly tearing him apart. He clearly had made the rookie mistake of taking Cas’ cock out completely, thought if he worked Cas quickly it would get him to falter but it didn’t work like that and Cas teasing Dean had him biting his fist not to scream out. All he wanted was Cas to touch him, really touch him and he couldn’t. He couldn’t make a sound.
The video popped up bigger. The screen from Cas’ laptop shedding light onto Dean’s grey tight boxers that he’d been wearing that day, dick tucked in nicely and slightly pronounced. He was sporting a semi. Dean watched as his hips raised up a bit and it made him gulp audibly, then Cas’ hand came into view, moving over Dean’s thigh with confidence.
They didn’t say anything about it. He didn’t want to talk about it either. Torn between hating that he needed Cas so that Gordon wouldn’t kill him and loving how his neck still tingled from Cas’ onslaught.
Dean was honest to God petrified of what was going to happen. He couldn’t let it show, had to be strong, always had to be strong even when faced with being assaulted like this. He’d prefer if they just bet the crap out of him, why did he have to look like this, why did he have to run his mouth for so many months, riling them up for them to want to take Dean down a few pegs, show him his place, on his knees in the shower and there was nothing he could do about it. Fucking nothing.
“Easy there, sweetheart.” Dean had Claire by her elbow, making sure she was steady on her feet before he let go. She smiled mischievously, wiping the snow off the front of her coat and throwing into Dean’s face.
“Thank you! See handsome over here gets it,” Gabriel points to Dean. Dean rolls his eyes. He isn’t falling for Gabriel’s shameless flirting advances. It makes Castiel appreciate Dean’s person even more.
He looked down between them, noticed Cas was hard in his trousers too. He moved his hand around, been thinking about touching Cas’ cock since his little display earlier. Cas stopped him, other hand on Dean’s wrist. He lifted his head to Cas, the slight worry on his face made Dean think that Cas thought he was doing it out of obligation, something Cas didn’t want. He only wanted Dean to do it if Dean wanted to, which he did. He definitely did want to get his hand on his cock, rip an orgasm out of him as hard as Cas did to him.
Sam and Charlie were waiting for Dean, leaning against their cell with grins on their faces at what just unfolded in front of them. He recomposed himself, shaken himself back to reality and motioned for them to join him to go to dinner.
he heard Cas’ voice behind him, urging him on to take more of Cas in his mouth. Cas’ body convulsed, hands tugging Dean’s hair. Dean slapped his hand on Cas’ thigh from the pain, not being able to voice it but fuck that hurt and his stomach twisted with desire he had never known. He had to press his own erection to stop it getting too carried away. He didn’t want to cum yet. If he came it was over and that was the last thing Dean wanted.
“You fall over?” he bent down to brush the dirt off of her. She nodded. “You hurt yourself?” he started to run his hands over his face to look for scratches or cuts out of instinct.
“You getting out or what?” the lady from 3A asks. It pulls them out of it. Dean coughs and stiffens himself up. Castiel similarly tries to shake off the realisatons he’s currently having of what the subtext of what he just did might mean to Dean. An innocent gesture that somehow turned into anything other than innocent. Before he has a chance to apologies Dean is stepping into his flat and closes the door behind him.
He went to open the door, unsure when they’d get to do this again, hoping sooner rather than later. Their lives were hectic balancing work and a kid. A secret relationship, or…whatever it was they were on top of that was hard to juggle. He knew it would be easier to just let the girls know, except it was way too soon and too massive of a thing to drop on a couple of four-year-old.
Cas lets out a little whine after hearing those words, his body sags into Dean’s and he hugs him back. The bitterness disappears.
“The history project?” Dean lifted up the history book in his hand, battered and torn. “Why, were you thinking of something else?” he asked with a slight smirk.
Dean didn’t stop shouting till his voice broke, till his throat burned and his chest heaved. He punched the wall till both his hands were covered in blood, the adrenaline coursed through him keeping the drowning away. He knew it would come, inevitably it could come, and he would drown in it.
All he can do is hold on, hips swaying with Dean’s every movement. He knows Dean is trying to see what he likes, trying it all out and it’s all fantastic. His head is rolling around on Dean’s chest, hands in fists as Dean does his worst on him. He feels his orgasm building like a low rolling thunder.
Cas got down on his knees, hands moving up Dean’s legs as before sending shivers down his spine. He widened his legs, let his friend slot in between them. Hand moving away, to let Cas take over with that sure movement palming over his erection. Dean sighed, relaxing further into the cushions, knowing what was going to come, knowing Cas was going to take care of him.
“You remember what I told you?” Cas asked softly. A hand moved into Dean's hair, thumb brushing over the shell of his ear to take his head. He moaned at the contact, missing Cas’ touch on him these past weeks. Nails dug in, drawing him back to Cas. “Do you remember?”
It didn’t take long before Gabriel showed up, leaning in the door frame, lollipop lodged into the side of his mouth. “You scared green eyes away.”
Castiel manages to get to 56 before he hears the sounds of a rumbling car engine getting increasingly louder outside of his window. The engine cuts off, a door opens, and slams shut. Clearly this person has no concept that it’s too early to be making this much noise. It’s quiet for a moment then Castiel can hear the driver on the phone.
“Bad memories.” Cas took Dean's wrist to move Dean’s hand back to the tattoo, away from the knife wound.
When the count was done, Dean got onto his bed. The railing shut and they were locked in for the night. The bunk moved, Cas getting into his bed. He lay on his side, saw Cas had draped his top over the back of the chair. The urge to get a sneak off his tattoos were there. Dean thought about Cas lying there, hands behind his head, ink on show. He wondered what other tattoos he could trace over and over with his fingers. If Cas would let him.
“Break it up, no touching.” A guard said. Dean let go and didn’t complain, no back talk, no attitude which was unlike him. That got a curious brow from his brother.
Cas shook his head. He pulled one side of his shirt to the side, revealing the Superman t-shirt he had on underneath. “Of course, Clark Kent.” Dean understood what he was doing.
“Uncle Sammy!” she shouted. She took the last two in a jump and ran into her uncle’s arms that were waiting to pick her up. Sam knew she wanted up on his shoulders, made her seem like a giant so he swung her up there like she weighed nothing. Her hands went around neck to hold on. “Look at me Daddy, I’m taller than you.”
Dean watches Cas’s face drop. It’s one of his students. Jess is one of his students and he’s standing there in his pajamas. Dean’s face splits from smiling so hard. This is priceless.
Claire’s other parent was a Dad. Interesting. Suddenly Dean’s fantasies didn’t seem to unrealistic. Nope, he needed to avert back to general sex talk about other people. He couldn’t engage in these thoughts until safe inside the confines of the bedroom. Thoughts that Cas
Cas and Gabriel initially refused. They fought relentlessly about it for months. The two sets of brothers coming to blows more than once. Dean ran his tongue over a chip in his tooth. Another reminder of Cas on him. Only once their grand plan worked did they stop making it. It took nearly two years, failed attempt after failed attempt to get one of their own out of a cage in Hell. The rioting in Purgatory being used to distract everyone enough for Lucifer to escape.
He got close to the end, right up to the point where Cas was slamming into the guy so hard that the bathroom stall wall had begun to move so he wrapped a hand around the guy’s chest to hold him back off it and that had Dean cumming harder than when he got a blowjob the other day and it was just by Cas’ voice alone. Just that image of Cas being strong enough to hold Dean up, still fuck him and jack him off while Dean melted in his chest, probably whispering sweet nothings in his ear the entire time.
Dean’s legs started to give way, crumbling underneath him he couldn’t stay up right. His hand tried to reach for the bunk to steady himself, his perception was off, and he missed it, falling to the ground on his knees hard.
“I was leaving his place this morning and we kinda had this…moment I guess where I admitted I had feelings for him, and he kinda agreed.”
Cas made an incoherent content noise, his head nuzzled further into Dean’s side. Dean couldn’t help laughing at it, little murderous Cas getting snuggly. The Russian felt the laugh and made a quiet point, “You tell anyone about this I’ll…”
Dean pulls his hand back not caring if it isn’t even finished yet. Bad mood Dean, plus whiskey means being a vocal asshole especially to sarcastic dick heads like the one he’s currently dealing with.
Dean did find out later. How long he had known Cas wasn't aware of. He just knew when they walked their way into the main campus and came to their usual crossroads Cas was about to turn right to the media building and Dean to turn left to the humanities one but before he had a chance to bid his friend a good first day Dean caught Cas by the front of his shirt and hauled him in for an unexpected kiss.
I'm debating changing the rating to Mature but what constitutes as Mature and not Explicit? All my other fics have been pretty explicit but this one is less on the raunchy scale. What would you count as Mature and Explicit?
Dean huffed but reached for a pad of paper and a pen from Cas’ desk. Cas pulled up a few sources from Stonewall, calling out important people and dates for Dean to create some kind of a timeline. They spoke a bit about how they think it should be presented, not sugar coating over police brutality and how often forgotten the person who started it had been a black drag queen.
Mary kissed Cas’ cheek in a hello, remembering his awkwardness around physical contact. She told the boys to drop their bags upstairs and get settled in before they called them down for dinner saying something about their long journey and how she had a million questions about their trip so they would need their energy. Dean didn’t say no. He did just drive for nearly seven hours straight. Even half an hour would do him some good.
“I’ve known you my whole life Castiel, you really think I don’t know you were off in some fantasy land?” his friend pulls up a stool. Gabriel’s got his Sweet as Heaven apron on, it’s deep blue, covered in flour and has a little gold halo above the last E in heaven.
“Nothing to tell,” Dean grabbed his wallet and keys. “It’s not a date, more a…” he bounced his brows at his brother. His brother grimaced at the thought and decided not to ask any more questions about it.  Success, not completely lying and not completely telling the truth. He followed his brother down the stairs to check in on Charlie before he headed off.
“I’m close Dean.” He said mixed with another sinful moan because Dean found that sweet spot and Cas started to see stars behind his eyes.
Readjusting himself Cas went back to his drawings, hand less shaky and a nice buzz tingling his skin, his palm still warm from Dean's cock being in it. Bad boy Dean Winchester turning into soft boy in front of Cas' eyes, another day dream to add to his ever growing repertoire. He wondered how long it would take before Dean started to seek him out. He'd give it a week.
He didn’t get to finish his sentence. Cas grabbed Dean’s thigh and used his weight to toss Dean out of the bed. He hit the concrete ground in a loud thud. “Jesus Christ Cas!” he groaned. Dean was only out of the infirmary for the guts of half an hour, still battered and bruised from the last assault the Russian had given him. He wanted to know what the hell was going on. He never got the chance. Cas was up and out of his cell in the blink of an eye.
“Promise,” Cas’ hands slip through the fabric of Dean’s jacket and land back by his side. Dean dives to the other side of the car, almost debates sliding over the bonnet to get their faster. He hops in and closes the door behind him. “See? Right here.” He shoots a smile across. Cas doesn’t return it, instead falls into the space between them, half of his head resting on Dean’s lap.
Gordon rubbed the blood that had dripped down to his mouth. Another Folk Nation came in to help him up onto his feet. Dean noticed that something shining had been passed into his hand. A shiv.
Dean spoke a bit about his life outside of Purgatory, how he and Sammy earned a living hunting down people they deemed were “bad”. They’d follow missing people cases, murders, things like that in various states and did what needed to be done. Sometimes people would hire them for their services, if Dean and Sam felt the person was worth taking out, they would. He had a clear conscious on every kill he made, well, nearly every kill. Dean’s job wasn’t all that black and white, even he made mistakes he couldn’t take back. No one outside those he trusted knew that about him, not even Charlie knew the full story.
The tiny box eventually opens. He spies a postcard and two boring white letters most likely bills that need paying. Dean does not miss paying bills. Perk to being on the road.
“Shame,” Crowley stood up. “If it were, I might have offered my services.” And with that he walked back to his post on the peripheral of the block, back to watching and being a general creep that he was. Dean took another chew of his bar.
Castiel leans down once more, kissing Dean just as frantic as before, just as dominating, he feels helpless and in control and it doesn’t make any sense, but it makes sense to his body. His hands are on either side of Dean’s head, attempting to hold him up right as Dean runs his tongue along his lips wanting to get in. Castiel let his mouth fall open, gliding his tongue along with Dean’s, moaning from the sensation it gives him.
Dean whined at the unexpected pet name, hand needing to take an even tighter grip of his own aching erection. He wasn’t entirely too sure he wouldn’t come from this, whatever the hell this was. A name like that from anyone else and he’d be punching them in the face, somehow Cas saying it made him feel special. A kind of special he only wanted Cas to see.
“If it isn’t the Winchesters, back from the nurse’s office,” Masters said voice in a constant state of sultry. He reached out to touch Sam’s sling. “Need help getting undressed stud?”
“Castiel!” he shouts. Dean snaps his head up hearing the rare name and raises his brows when he spots Castiel standing behind the till in a Sweet as Heaven apron. Gabriel makes a gesture for him to come over to him.
He watched Dean grip the bedsheets beside him. “Shut your mouth Novak.” He huffed weakly, there was no fight in that response.
The next time he saw Dean he was standing in front of a girl who was getting ready for someone to do a body shot off of her. She lay on Gabriel’s table, shirt hiked up and a line of guys to the side of her, one of them being Dean.
The Russian’s had his hand on the hem of Dean’s top silently asking to take it off. If he took his top off it would be game over, all control he was holding in would be lost. He couldn’t do it, remembering the consequences, remembering the rumours that would then be true. Rumours he refused to give into. He wouldn’t let Cas fuck him as his prag.
This close Dean could just about make out the scars on his stomach, noticed what looked like a bullet wound breaking up the ink in his tattoo.
Dean starts to lean into it, chasing Castiel’s thumb. He’s enjoying it. Castiel is too, such a small touch, their first touch and its sending Castiel’s mind into overdrive.
“You want to ruin my bed lev?” Cas asked dark and heavy. He would, he was close if he let himself indulge more than he already was, letting his hips sway into the bed, getting a good friction going but he also wanted to make Cas feel good, wanted to feel Cas cum in his mouth and fall apart just like Cas makes him fall apart.
Dean pulled him off. “C’mere, wanna try something.” He lifted Cas up to stand. His hands made quick work of the rest of Cas’ trousers, shoving his boxers down to free his cock from entrapment. Dean spat in his hand, wrapping an arm around Cas to bring him closer, lining their cocks up. Cas couldn’t help but chuckle at what Dean was attempting to do.
On Saturday Castiel is repaying Gabriel by working at the bakery as promised. He’s on the till where he’s comfortable, the constant chat Gabriel and Kevin do with the customers is something Castiel hopes to avoid as long as humanly possible.
He really wished they were in their cell so Dean could tend to these wounds, at least clean the blood currently drying onto his face. His hands moved into Cas’ scalp, to check for bumps. Cas leaned into it, like a cat enjoying the contact then winced when Dean found a lump. He stood back from Dean’s hands. Dean followed after him, suddenly more concerned than he was before. “You didn’t black out, did you? Last thing you need is a concussion.”
“Sounds good, I’ll get us some Chinese?” He hopped up off the bed, clapping his hands together with some newfound excitement in him.
Castiel lifted his mug to Dean in a hello. Dean mirrored the gesture back. He was staring at Dean like he had been before Dean pissed him off, that air of interest, curiosity. It was in the way he tilted his head, like he was studying him. Castiel didn’t look at Dean like the AB did, he looked at him like he was trying to see underneath him. That presence his had was alluring, Dean couldn’t deny that. One of his minions called him away.
She rolled her eyes at her friend. “I swear, you and Dean catching feelings for each other is ruining your dirty sides. Come back to me Clarence, tell me all the raunchy things you and that green-eyed boy have been getting up.”
Once he was settled on his stomach too, pillow under his arms he pressed play on the video. They lay there in comfortable silence, watching the images of the riot fill the screen, there was a narrator speaking over it and as much as Cas said he paid attention to it, he really couldn’t.
“An actual kiss would be nice for starters.” Leaning down he slipped his mouth between Cas’ lips, unhurried, tongues passing and exploring. The faint taste of cigarette smoke between them from yard time. His hips dipped, grinding on Cas as sluggish and leisurely as his kisses. A delicate string of sighs and gasp from the Russian were creeping their way inside of Dean’s mind, making themselves at home in the space that Dean had given to all things Cas. They found themselves alongside everything else Dean loved about him.
“What do you want Crowley?” Sam asked knowing all too well that Crowley didn’t interact with others unless absolutely necessary. He kept to himself, kept to his sex workers and observed Purgatory from a safe distance. People came up to him, he never sought out people.
Dean’s head dropped to Cas’ crotch. His erection pressed against his slim fitted jeans. He was actually debating it. It sent a thrill through Cas. Again, the slip lasted a moment, maybe two and then he forcefully shook his head, like the thought disgusted him. What a shame.
“Good, I love sugar AND gluten.” He said with his mouth covered in powdered sugar. She made a horrified look at him and walked off back to the other collection of yummy Mummies standing in a circle with white wine spritzers in their hands. Gluten, not ok, alcohol at half 1 though, totally acceptable.
Castiel was stunned, too many thoughts and emotions running through his mind to really comprehend what he was saying. On top of that Dean had to go and call himself handsome, smoking,
Cas is giving Dean the silent treatment. Dean is missing clothes from his laundry. He goes to the laundry room alone. Gordon and one of his goons follows him and *things* happen. His brother and Gabriel save him. He has a panic attack later and Cas and Benny help him through it.
Cas followed his brother and Dean followed in tow, walking into the kitchen/dining room that had more adults in it. Some from the pre-school, some Dean didn’t recognise before. For a short notice birthday party, there was a decent turn out. Seven or so kids were running around high on sugar and life. Dean spotted the table that had the sugar on it and like a magnet he was pulled, hand reaching a sugary donut and inhaling it in two bites. It was glorious. Dean noticed the birthday cake too, it was shimmering in gold glitter, explained why Cas had it on him yesterday.
“Dean! Get your ass back behind the bar. Mom and Ash and swamped back there.” Jo calls out to him from another table. He heads back before she decides to throw something at him. When Jo comes back with empty glasses, he tells her to drop the bottle of tequila at the table he was at along with four shot glasses. He might not be able to get the dirt on Cas tonight, but hopefully he can cash in on this in the future. Dean hears Gabriel’s shouts of appreciation over the music and grins. The money out of his wages for the bottle might just be worth it.
The anxiety about the date was side-stepped when those two were together. His baby brother and his baby girl totally besotted with one another. He basically raised Sam and it was a nice turn of events that now Sam was helping him raise Charlie. When he first got her Sam had been there through the night feeds and diaper changes. It took Amelia showing up to actually get him out of the house and into his own life, not that he really left, just moved out. They still saw each other every week, maybe more depending on Sam’s schedule.
“Cas, I’m…” Dean broke off when he came, a stillness washed over him like previously, his muscles and bones paralyzing from his orgasm. He filled Cas’ mouth and that was enough for Cas to lose his own cool, cumming into his hand with hot short bursts.
The laugh woke the girls up. Dean didn’t mind and neither did Cas. They had time to figure it all out and no doubt Cas’ baggage would come into the mix at some point. There wasn’t any rush to this, to them. They were both in it for the long haul and that was good enough for Dean. It was like Cas said, he didn’t see a future without him.
Cas pulled out, breathing sharp and loud. He got down onto his knees, leveling himself with Dean who had his mouth still opened, spit and cum on his face. He only had one question,
Hair a mess, eyes bright, lips a little swollen, cheeks pinked. He hadn’t seen such a doped-up sex face in all his life. The man responsible for it lying upside down on the bed, one arm hanging off and snores starting to come out of him. He never knew someone to go from a sex god to an adorable idiot in the space of ten minutes and yet there he was, pulling it off.
“Wasn’t what I was going for,” he licked his lips, enjoying what he was seeing. Cas was lean, the light from the en-suite casting shadows on his chest and stomach. “But this is, yeah…” Words escaped him as his hand reached out to touch the hair under his naval, dark and trailing down under his jeans. He noticed the bulge in his eye line, clearly, he wasn’t the only one in here getting hard from some frantic making out.
Cas let his nails dig into Dean’s chest, raking it down to give Dean a different sensation, a distraction from the need the cum, for now. Goosebumps rose on the skin under his fingers. He wanted Dean’s attention as he spoke to him. He needed to hear this clearly. “You’re mine Dean, aren’t you? My good boy.”
He had a point. Yard time they tended to keep to themselves, unless you needed something. It was like the diplomatic area for sorting out tensions or keeping people informed. Either way, Rufus had been sent to talk to them.
"Apparently so." Cas replied, taking the opportunity to put his hands on Dean's face. Dean turned as always, kissing his palm.
A hand pulled at the strands of Cas’ hair, unsure of tugging him closer or pushing him away like Dean couldn’t make his mind up. Cas made hit for him, releasing him from his mouth in a pop. His eyes looked up to catch Dean looking down at him. Green consumed with darkness, emerald to pine just like Cas liked it.
“It was just some chick at a bar alright? I fucked her in a bathroom stall,” he lied, turning up his collar to hide the marks again and the red rising up his neck. “I didn’t tell you two because she meant nothing to me. I don’t even remember her name.”
Dean hadn’t noticed that Cas had turned off the video, till he heard the laptop shut and darkness fall between them. He shook himself back to reality, rising up onto his elbows to see the shadow of his friend still kneeling over him. It wasn’t necessarily awkward, but equally not their normal atmosphere.
I have no more stories on the horizon either! Feel free to have a look at my other ones and indulge in more Destiel magic.
Dean tried and failed to roll his hips to meet Cas’ hand now with the weight of Cas holding him down. He shook his head frantically, body starting to shake. “No, now Cas, please I need it now, please Cas, please.”
God, Cas’ hand looked seriously good over his boxers, the low light made it even hotter, like they were doing something in secret, that no one was supposed to see.
He was fine by the time pick-up came around for Charlie. Cas was in the playground with Dean’s daughter’s hair in his hands. It made him stop in his tracks, trying to get his phone before either of them noticed and ruined it. Cas was putting her hair in a French plait, or at least trying to, something Dean never even attempted to master. He could do a mean ponytail and a bun if Charlie spun around while he held her hair. He was glad she didn’t like it up because he always felt like he was hurting her when he did it. Cas looked like he was being so gentle with her that a lump of affection got caught in Dean’s throat.
Dean’s already sitting there, eyes fixed on Cas as he walks up the steps to meet him. He plants his feet on either side and sinks to Dean’s lap, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck and hiding himself from the world.
He stood outside, leaned against the rails and the Russian followed leaning against the rails with him. Dean shifted an inch further away to avoid brushing his shoulders with the guy.
“I’ll be right back Cas, promise.” Dean assures him. He believes him and let’s go. He can be alone for a few moments on his own in his drunken state.
As the days passed Dean kept to himself, kept his head down. Charlie and Sam bought him a chocolate bar for being two months out of the Empty. They earned more than he did so a chocolate bar wasn’t much to them, but it was everything to Dean. He earned next to nothing in his work detail. The sacrifice he made so he could at least be outdoors more than the rest of them.
“We had this arrangement before I got thrown into the Empty. It wasn’t anything really, just celly’s jacking each other off or whatever,” he admitted. It was easier to talk about feelings when they were driving and Dean could look out the ahead of him, putting the books away was the substitute for it. “It feels different now, feels more intimate or somethin’.”
“And he didn’t leave a mess on my leather seats either if you know what I mean, so I have no complaints really.” There was a crash on the other side of the line. “Cas?”
No, he couldn’t have these thoughts, shouldn’t have them. He tried to create distance then realised Dean had tightened his grip on Cas, not letting him move away.
“Enough Meg.” He scowled her. Even if she did know, it didn’t feel right to talk to her about it. Dean wasn’t some hook up that meant nothing to him. He couldn’t talk about him the way he could easily talk about the others who he had fucked over the years. Dean was his best friend, had been there for him through everything and divulging intimate details about him like Cas used to about others seemed disrespectful. He wasn’t an object, a means to an end. He was a person, someone Cas cared deeply about.
He lifted his fidgeting hands to Cas’ face, eyes narrowing in on Cas’ lips that were no longer chapped, the slightest glisten off of them after he licked his lips clean from Dean’s load. The thought of it made his hair stand to attention.
Same as before Cas moved his hands off of Dean’s body, giving the viewers a few seconds to see the cum on his body, cock twitching, spent and oversensitive. He was too blissed out to realise as his hand moved down his stomach to touch the cum there, it was a lot, he was always messy like that.
Ellen lets him off before official closing when he explains the situation, leaving out some intimate details he says that his neighbor is too out of his head to make it back on his own and his friends had ditched him. Leaving out the fact that Dean had offered and a part of him wants to make sure Cas gets home safe and doesn’t choke on his own vomit before he gets a chance to choke on Dean’s dick. There are selfish motivations lurking in there he aint gonna deny it. Cas in tight t-shirts needs to be outlawed effective immediately.
Now that Dean thought about it, the better the afterglow, the more likely Cas would tell him privy information. Maybe even information about what he kind of contraband he trying to get into the Purgatory and Hell.
Sam didn’t respond straight away. Balthazar pressed his thumb into the gauze above Sam’s face making him cry out in pain. Dean swung his feet around to reach for him, pulled on the metal cuff that was holding him back. The other Russian pushed Dean back onto the bed tutting at him for even trying something as stupid.
The customer, Sam scratches the back of his neck and blushes a little under his collar. Castiel would rather not be in the middle of this flirting game that Gabriel insists on doing with just about anyone who was attractive and of legal age. Sam looks barely 21.
“C’mere,” He waved her over to him and she shuffled her feet around the sofa. Dean picked her up with ease and she curled up in his lap, head on his chest. He patted down her mane to stop it from tickling his face. She smelled like coconuts, smelled like home. “You wanna tell me about it?”
"Yes," Dean exhaled. "Fuck yes..." He fell back into the sofa, eyes looking up at the ceiling because it was easier than staring at Cas, because staring at Cas meant something, something he wasn’t quite sure of and there was even a second right before Cas ripped his orgasm out of him that he was going to call out his friend’s name but he caught himself just in time, letting out an earth shattering groan instead.
Cas lifted his shirt up a bit to get at his lower back and pulled his waistband of his trousers down too, not down enough for his ass to be on show (unfortunately). When the Russian pressed the heel of his palms into Dean’s back he groaned into the pillow from the pain.
“Yeah I wanted to say sorry you know for Wednesday when I…” Dean trails off. He’s not good with words, meaningful words anyway.
“Shush, shush,” Cas let go of his cock to soothe his shakes, his hands giving Dean’s sweat shining chest soft touches. It seemed to help, Dean slowly getting his breathe back. “Once more my beautiful boy, just one more time.”
“Then I want you to suck mine.” His whisper almost inaudible, eyes moving to look up at Cas. Heat rose up his neck and onto his cheeks under the watchful gaze. Time ticked on and he wasn’t entirely sure how long they stayed there like that, eyes locked and Cas’ firm grip on Dean’s wrist. He found himself slipping under. The room closing in to just them.
Cas raised his head to see Dean standing a few feet away from him, cigarette in hand, jacket collar turned up to keep the cold out. That it was particularly cold, the wind still had a chill though. He looked relax, not like what he appeared earlier.
Dean gets up from the bed and pads over to the kitchen. He stretches again, scratches the back of his head. Castiel joins him, his movements less sure, his stomach slightly churning from his hangover. He sits down at the table, holds his head up with his hands. Dean chuckles in his direction.
He likes his own place but knows he’d go insane if he had to stay in there for longer than a day by himself. Never gotten used to being on his own, had Sammy to look after, had his Dad to look after, he’s been around people all his life, even on the road he’d keep people around him through making friends or hooking up with someone with a nice ass and a pretty smile.
“Cas! What the hell…” Dean groans. Castiel uses his body to apologies, rolling their hips together in hope Dean forgives him. He much prefers this angle, seeing Dean break little by little, his teeth pulling at his mouth, pink hue flushing his under his eyes. Its mesmerising.
he thought, more like cat, a pet, Cas’ pet that he got to stroke whenever he felt like it and Dean gave it to him and now Dean was going to give all of him once he got out of this infirmary bed.
They went into the kitchen, Dean leaned against the counter as Cas brought down the whiskey from up above the fridge Gabriel had been looking for at Claire’s birthday party.
Couldn’t answer. No one could know, even if he wanted to admit to Cas. The Russian grabbed the back of Dean’s neck, pulled him further down to him so their foreheads were touching. He whispered, “I’d fuck you so good, you’d never go back to a woman again. I’d ruin you, lev.”
Cas reached across to grip Dean’s shoulder, giving it a tight squeeze. The immediate sag in Dean’s body let Cas know he was exhausted from the long drive. They would nap once inside, possibly get some take out for dinner if they woke up on time to eat. Cas doubted it.
This got super angsty like holy cow. I don't know what the hell happened, clearly I was in an angsty mood and produced this. I mean just be warned we go from fluff, to anger, to angst in a four thousand words.
“I need to get going but I’ll check over that email and spruce something up for the whatever…” He waved his hand dismissively, making a bee line for the exit.
“Oh, can it Jess and eat your damn burrito,” Dean says. He feels a warm hand squeezing his thigh under the table. That also assures him. “It’s not like Cas is some dried-up old bastard like Sam’s professors.”
Castiel weighs up what to say. He can feel Dean tense beside him, like he’s regretting suggesting lunch, suggesting Castiel come and sit with his friends who were technically Cas’ students. He doesn’t want Dean to feel bad, he never wants Dean to feel like he’s messed up ever again if Castiel can help it.
“Of course.” Cas took the empty mug from Dean’s hands, placed it into his sink. Dean gripped his hand on his friends’ shoulder as a thanks.
“Good.” Dean squeezed his hand in Cas’ then let go to wipe his eyes, pressing the heel of his palms into them. His heart still going a hundred miles an hour from his freak out. He hadn’t panicked like that in years. “Sorry for the freak out.”
Dean nodded because fuck did he. He reached for Cas’ cock, mouth salivating but Cas caught his wrist, inhibiting him. Dean groaned, frustrated that Cas was denying him what he wanted. His dick loved it though, twitching and leaking with the dominance display.
He wasn’t lying, he was good and hopefully by the end of it he’ll be more than good. If Cas was up for it. He usually was. They tended to leave it a few days, a few weeks before delving back into the whole sharing orgasms thing. Also, Dean realised on the way home that what he was after wouldn’t be recorded. They couldn’t exactly jack each other off while watching their porno and film it at the same time given that Cas’ laptop did the filming.
“Where?” Dean replies running his hands over Castiel again. He touches his back, pauses and waits for an answer. Castiel shakes his head, letting it drop to Dean’s chest, remembering to breathe, just breathe. He licks his dry lips and Dean’s chest by accident, the salted taste of his sweat on his tongue. Dean smells like beer, cigarette smoke, sweat, gas, a concoction of his jobs rolled into one scent.
After painfully losing a game of beer pong to Jo and Ash, they were stumbling around, falling over each other as they tried to make their way to a couch. Dean fell first, crashing onto the pleather couch and onto his back, then Cas followed, tripping over a rug and landing on top of his best friend in an almighty thud. The groan between them was heard over the pounding music.
The noticeable pause coming from Cas makes Dean think he shouldn’t have asked. He had been slow, biding his time for Cas to feel ready to kiss him and it never came. Stealing his phone in part was to put his number in, in part to make Cas get close to Dean, closer than hand holding. The hand holding, it’s nice, sweet but Dean wants more. Wants those blue eyes darkening and that attention to come back, like Cas is trying to sear through Dean’s clothes and see what’s underneath. It had been all sunshine and rainbows on their date. He can only do sunshine and rainbows for so long.
Her sadness is turning into panic, the anxiety rises up within her and she’s trying to catch her breath. She needs a distraction, some lightness to subside the anxiety. Castiel decides to bend a boundary.
“You need to clean it,” He said. Cas huffed but got up to their shared sink and ran it under the tap. Dean took out the first aid kit from his drawer, opened it to set it up. Cas came back to sit down, noticed the green kit on the desk. “Lemme see.” Dean put his hand out.
Charlie took out a deck of cards and shuffled it. “I’ve gotten pretty good at this since you’ve been away.” Charlie said to him, acting as normal as ever. Dean supposed this was their new normal, they’d been sitting with the Russians for a couple of months. It was Dean who was finding this entire thing strange. If he blocked out the Russian chat and how the side of his body lined up with Cas’, he could pretend he was on the other side of the yard where he usually was.
It made sense to Dean now. The way Cas looked at him, that confusion plastering his face when Dean mentioned his brother and Balthazar. Cas had no clue, assumed Dean did it because he wanted to not because he was made to do it. A part of him did want it though.
“Big Winchester,” The Russian said, standing ready to fight still, one leg in front of the other, bouncing of the balls of his feet. “Here to protect little brother.”
Christ, he didn’t even know if he should be flirting with Cas. He knew pretty much next to nothing about the guy. What he did know is he felt like a dickhead the rest of the week. Between his two jobs starting too early and ending too late and Cas’s normal person work schedule he never got to see him to apologies. He needed to do something to sort the guilt out before he ate him alive, so pie.
John even nodded in approval at the sentiment. Christ, they all wanted to meet this guy. Meet Dean, their son, their brother who was sitting right next to them all. Their conversation seemed to move on from that, focusing on their fishing trip they were going to take tomorrow.
There were moments when they lost themselves in each other, Dean wanted to kiss the Russian, run his tongue along his dried-up lips and taste him. Sometimes he swore Cas looked like he was about to, blue eyes locked on Dean’s lips like he was debating doing it, till he dropped his head to Dean’s shoulders where it was safe and away from danger. Dean wanted that danger though. The urge to pull Cas back up to meet his face and press their lips together was getting difficult to not give into.
Even having more than half a small room to call his own had been strange. Sammy had been released a couple of years earlier. He found a place to live in Lebanon Kansas, worked at the local motel doing maintenance and took night classes at the local college. Dean joined him once he was allowed leave the halfway house. He got a job at a bar called the Roadhouse. Eventually they salvaged enough for a two-bedroom place. It was decent enough. It was theirs and that was what had mattered. A penthouse suite in comparison to Purgatory.
Castiel understands he needs to get up but is finding trouble in getting up off of his chair. The likely hood of him being able to stand on his own are slim.
Charlie and Claire came into the kitchen. He clicked the screen off, glad for the distraction. They were drowning in Cas’ t-shirts. The hem of the shirts almost on the ground and the sleeves were like wings. The paint had found its way to their faces, spots of purple, dark blue and silver. It was adorable and he needed a picture. Cas had bet him to it, down at their level with his phone. They smiled bright knowing that a phone meant smiles because kids were conditioned that way now.
“Crowley.” Dean nodded. Crowley managed to get himself one of the best work details there. Everyone wanted to work commissary. The English inmate refused to tell anyone why he was in there made everyone think it was something bad. Dean assumed it was for something stupid and he was too embarrassed to say it. The guy was sleezy and had eyes everywhere, he wasn’t a part of any gang, but he did own most of the sex workers in Purgatory. Kept one with him in the commissary to run around collecting the things, this week it was Masters, a favourite among Dean’s particular block. Crowley had the guy out to flaunt him no doubt, get the guys in his block thirsty for whatever Master had to offer.
