“Captain,” Coulson started but was interrupted by Fury.
"Hey," he called out as he walked closer.
“I can try for a bit?” He offered. Tony stopped the rocking but didn’t answer right away. Steve froze because either Tony was going to appreciate the help or bite his head off. Tony’s glare a second later answered his question. “I’m just trying to help, Tony. I know you can do it.”
“I’ll probably keep snapping at you. At least until this kid’s out of diapers. You sure that sounds so great to you?” Steve knew Tony was joking, he laughed when he said it, but he also knew Tony’s insecurities could rare their ugly head at any moment so he didn’t laugh. He held Tony’s eye contact.
“He has the results?” Bruce asked.
“They got separated. Natasha made it back to the meet up and Steve hasn’t.” He pushed past Bucky and crouched down next to Indy’s seat.
“That’s amazing, Peanut. You’re a lucky boy.” Tony dutifully went over to his son and inspected the toy and Indy beamed. His gaze flicked to Bucky momentarily. “Don’t have to stop on my account.”  Tony went to sit on the sofa next to Steve who put his arm out automatically so Tony could snuggle into his side. Bucky hesitated at first but Indy was impatiently tapping the book so Bucky began reading again.
“Steve’s or yours,” Tony said. Bucky glanced at him quickly as if he didn’t realize that and then shrugged. “We’ll do a DNA test when we get back. Unless you wanna be extra helpful and tell us?” Tony added.  The Hydra agent scoffed but the gun butting into the back of her head made her stop.
“Not because of today though, Steve,” Tony hurried to add. “I don’t think he wanted to hurt me. I don’t think he’s gonna have this issue growing up. He knows right from wrong, he’s just a toddler.” Tony paused. “But, he was with Hydra for almost 3 years. So, for that? Yeah, he should probably have someone that can work that out with him. We’re certainly not qualified, though I think he’s doing really well with us.”
"So did I," Bucky said.
Tony nervously brought Luca out once he had finished and shyly greeted Pepper. Pepper smiled knowingly.
“Well, I need to rest I’ve been told,” Tony replied mock seriously. Steve picked up Poppy and stood.
“Can you say hi to Uncle Bruce, Buddy?” Steve asked as he picked Indy up off of Bucky’s lap. Indy curled into Steve shyly and waved. “Can you use your words?” Steve added. “Bruce is a friend.”
“You want me to hold your llama? Don’t you wanna sleep with it?” Bucky was confused.
“The best,” he answered immediately. “Let’s go meet your son. Properly.” He stood and offered his hand to Steve who took it to pull himself up before going back to the conference room.
“Thank you,” Indy said as he reached out and grabbed on to one of Tony’s fingers before he pulled his hand away. He tucked his bear in to the crook of his arm and grabbed one of Steve’s fingers as well in his other hand. “Night,” he told them, yawning as his eyes started to drift shut.
“Yes, sir.”
“Ok so now you can put a candy cane in and use it to stir.” Steve demonstrated in his own and then unwrapped the rest of Indy’s licked candy and gave it to him. Indy licked it then put it in his cup and stirred around the marshmallows. “Now you can try a sip.”
“Tony da,” Indy replied simply with his limited vocabulary. He grabbed Tony’s finger in his small hand and held on to it.
“Do you remember when you met Bucky for the first time?”
Tony placed Indy standing on the floor next to Bucky’s door. “Wait here for one minute while I sneak in and grab Bucky’s bag, okay?”
“Yeah,” he shrugged. “I’ve been remembering more and more lately. Random stuff.”
“You’re okay, sweet boy. Papa’s here,” he whispered as Luca looked up at him.
Steve smiled. “Mmhmm. Feel different?”
"You still have my stuff?"
“Yup,” Clint agreed. “You owe me.” He laughed as he re-entered the elevator.
“Anytime. We’ll be fine, good luck,” he waved Steve off.
“Just once the second day I had him. I just figured it was what I was feeding him. God knows what Hydra had him eating but he hasn’t known what anything I offered him even is.” Steve hummed in acknowledgement, taking in that information.
"What?"
“What is wrong with you?” Steve snapped, as Tony continued walking, trying to ignore the man following closely behind him. “Do you have a death wish, Tony?” Steve sped up and sidestepped Tony so he could get in front of him, turning suddenly so they were face to face and Tony was brought up short, almost crashing right into him. After getting over the initial shock, Tony moved to step around his boyfriend but Steve brought his hand up onto Tony’s bicep, gripping it so he couldn’t leave. “You don’t get to walk away,” Steve said angrily.
“I don’t think I can stand much longer, Tony.” Tony nodded.
“What?” Tony and Steve exclaimed in unison.
“Absolutely. Are you sure Tony’s going to be okay with that though?”
“Thank you,” Steve replied sincerely. “Indy. Be good, okay? We’re going to see Daddy and we’ll be back in a little bit.” Indy waved him off so Steve and Bucky headed to the elevator.
“No, I’m fine I think,” Bucky answered. “I’ll let you know.”
Steve had a procedure for when Tony became too over-stressed with work, be it Stark Industries or Avengers business, and it was something that Tony had strongly resisted at first but had since grown to crave every so often. And Steve was more than happy to assist.
“I always want to take care of you. You’re usually more resistant,” Steve replied with a smirk.
“Please. I’ve been online since Steve just asked where she should sleep and I already have a bassinet and some essentials on the way here. You can get anything delivered at any time if you pay enough.” He waggled his phone at them with a smile. “Should be here within the hour.” Tony stood and clapped him in the shoulder. “You live here. I want this to be a home for you and your daughter. Plus, she kinda loves me already so,” Tony shrugged, smiling wide.
“Hate you,” Tony yelled in response. He sat up as Steve crouched down to his level. “Go away.” He swiped at Steve with a flailing hand and Steve caught it gently before it slapped him in the stomach.
“We’ll always give you cuddles, sweet boy,” Steve murmured, face buried in his sons hair. “I’m proud of you learning new words, too.”
“Of course,” Bucky replied, holding his hands out for the little boy.
Steve forced himself to walk back to Tony and not just scrap this whole idea and whisk his son into his arms. When he sat down Tony pulled him close. “This is good. This is normal, right? He’s fine.”  Steve nodded, turning his face into Tony’s neck. Indy began crying about a minute in, peeking over his shoulder repeatedly to see if his parents were still there. Tony kissed the top of Steve’s head when he felt the blonde grip him harder. “One more minute, darling,” he whispered. Steve sat up feeling slightly shaky and not knowing if that was due to his current medical state or punishing his baby. Tony saw the anguished look cross Steve’s face. “We’re not hurting him, Steve. As much as it may sound like it,” Tony added when Indy let out a louder cry.
Steve ruffled the boys hair. “Thanks, Pete.”
“Not even to, um,” Steve’s breath caught in his throat and he swallowed down the sob threatening to break free. “Not even to use a bathroom. So, I had to just-,” he stopped, unable to continue.
They all thanked him as he left and Steve sighed and looked at his watch. He pat his hand on Indy’s hip. “You hungry? It’s dinner time.” Indy shrugged and buried his face between Tony and the mattress.
“Nat dropped her off with me because she was getting fussy. I was headed to the kitchen but I saw you having a talk with him so I figured I’d give you some space to finish.” Tony held the baby’s hand against his chest.
“You’re so good with Indy. You’re a natural. And I know it’s different when it’s your own kid but the instincts are there, Buck,” Steve said sincerely.
“I guess we can do that,” Tony agreed. Steve stood and sat Luca on the bed and placed pillows on either side so he wouldn’t fall over.
“Is this okay?”
“Bucky is right, buddy. Santa would know what to bring a baby but you can always help her out with a list too. We can do hers after yours okay? And I’ll help you write her name on it,” Steve placated. Indy nodded, satisfied and shot Bucky a look that screamed ‘I told you so’ even without saying a word.
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”
“For me?” He asked excitedly.
“Steve,” Natasha called gently as she approached. Peter stayed against his chest but Steve looked up at her. “Clint and I are going to go meet with Coulson. No Fury. He’ll work with us, trust me.” Steve nodded.
4 hours later...
“Happy?” Indy asked him back.
“You ready to fly home?” Steve asked Tony.
“I want to, but, do you think he’ll be scared? Seeing me like this?” Steve looked gutted at the possibility of Tony agreeing with him and putting a stop to it.
“He’s still asleep. Possibly unconscious from the meds, but he’s okay. Or, he’s going to be. They used some drug they formulated to work against the serum. So, he was weakened and disoriented. That’s how they were able to hold him. And it messed with his brain too, like whatever they told him he seemed to believe.” Bucky shrugged. “The doctor can explain it better. But, they told him while they had him hostage they stormed the tower and killed you and Indy. He believed it, like he was so sure no matter how many times I told him it wasn’t true.” Tony was crying. And he didn’t want to be but then he couldn’t stop. Bucky didn’t mention it. “When you were talking to him about your day that was the first spark of something I’d seen in him, like he finally gave himself permission to hope.” Tony nodded and he opened his mouth to say something but it caught on a sob and he covered his face with one hand, but he couldn’t calm down. “He’s going to be okay,” Bucky tried to comfort. “He’ll see you and Indy and he’ll be fine, that’s all he needs.” Bucky stepped forward like he wanted to do something to help but wasn’t sure what, and that was enough for Tony to drop his hand and fling himself at Bucky, throwing his arms around him and holding tight. Bucky was stunned for a moment but then snapped out of it enough to hug him back.
“Well, on that note,” Pepper said, standing up. “It might not seem like it, but this seems to be the perfect time for my gift.” She grabbed the box and brought it over and placed it on Tony’s leg that didn’t have Indy sitting on it. She knelt down in front of the chair. “Want some help opening it?” Indy nodded, putting his thumb in his mouth which they noticed seemed to be a nervous habit lately. Pepper ripped a tear in the colorful paper and gestured to Indy. “Here, take this piece and pull.”  He did and managed to pull off a good amount. Pepper and Tony helped clear the rest of the paper. The box was plain white and Pepper took the lid off to reveal a bright blue tissue paper. Indy pulled on the top piece and revealed that underneath was a pair of tiny toddler slippers nestled on top of a fleece blanket.
“It is,” Bucky exclaimed. “I did this and Tony’s never going to see anything but that when he looks at me now. And I don’t blame him.”
“But you could make a wish for something you want,” Steve said.
“Well, that’s nice to hear. Thank you, Bubba. You know I love you. But you need to say you’re sorry for what you did and how you acted. And I think Clint needs an apology too.”  He rubbed his hand soothingly up and down Tony’s arm as he held him in place on the counter.
“No!” He shouted. Bucky saw Happy get out of the car and walk up to him.
“Look, we all wanna get Tony and your kid back safely but the procedure for handling threats doesn’t change just because its you, Rogers. You’re not special.”
“Hey buddy,” he said to Indy sounding carefree and normal. Indy looked over but was still pressed into Tony’s chest. “You’re gonna hang out with Bucky for a little while so I can talk to Tony, okay?” He put his hands out to pick him up but Tony didn’t let him go. “Tony, hey.” Steve put his hand on top of Tony’s head scratching lightly through his hair. “Let me take him.” He gasped for air slightly but released his hold. Steve picked up his son just as Bucky had made it to the entrance of the workshop. “Did JARVIS explain?” Steve asked.
Indy nodded. “Tucks.”
“Night, Buppy.” Indy waved to Bucky as Bucky nodded to Tony and Steve and left the room. Steve picked the boy up off the bed.
“Love you too, kiddo.” Bucky stood, bringing Poppy up to his chest and the 3 men left the room.
Steve was still for a few minutes but then started tossing and turning. Tony thought maybe he was having a nightmare but when he looked Steve’s eyes were open. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“You want to see her?” Bucky asked. Tony nodded but his eyes were closing.
“Yes I can.” Steve stepped closer to the boy. “I know you can handle it, but I’ll be worried enough about Tony and Luca. I don’t need an extra person there to be be worried about. The more people we bring the more there’s a chance that they take someone else hostage, even if we get Tony and Luca, because they’re going to be worried about the getaway.” Steve put a hand on Peter’s shoulder. “Please. Stay here with JARVIS and keep an eye on the livestream. Keep a comms in your ear and let us know if anything happens, okay?”
This ones not a happy one......Sorry!
“Thanks, J.” Tony pulled away from Steve. “Let’s go see if we can deal with this, huh?”
Tony sighed. “You’re not a prisoner. You can talk to Steve. You can leave his rooms.” Tony looked to Steve who looked pleased that he spoke up. “We’re not friends,” Tony added harshly. “But, you can answer Steve’s questions if you want to.”
“Did you not hear me, or,” Tony trailed off.
“Buppy, no bath,” Indy told him. Bucky lifted the still naked little boy to his chest.
“Dum-E started it,” he grumbled. Dum-E beeped loudly from across the room. “Yes, you did,” Tony replied to it. “I told Indy he could play with Dum-E for a little bit while I was finishing up some work and it was fine at first, they were just chasing each other around. But then Dum-E kept offering him things that weren’t toys to play with that I kept having to take away.” Indy whined with his face still smooshed into the sofa.
Steve brought 2 steaming mugs of cocoa for Tony and Bucky then went back and got his own and a smaller cup for Indy with cold milk splashed in it to cool it down. He resumed his seat and pulled all the mugs in front of him. Indy leaned closer to Steve’s shoulder to watch.
"Thanks," Steve answered.
Tony was shaking his head and pulling his hand out of Steves grip. “You don’t want me to be a part of his life like that?” Tony’s breath hitched on the question. “I mean, I know I’m not exactly great parent material. I never thought I’d have kids but I love him, Steve. It’s only been a few days and I love him. If you don’t want me to see him, um,” Tony choked on his words, gasping as his anxiety rose.
“Of course, Captain.”
“Yeah, well, you would, spiderbaby,” Tony answered. Steve laughed as he walked back in the room with the bottle.
“No dad?” Tony said quietly. He didn’t mention his mom.
“You’re just a kid,” Steve sighed.
“Here.” Steve relaxed his hold so Tony could take him. Tony did and rearranged the little boy in his arms, holding him like a baby on his back even though he was a toddler. He was still small enough that he fit there comfortably with a little maneuvering.
“Has anyone been in here? While I was unconscious?” Tony shook his head.
“I’d love to,” he answered sincerely. Tony nodded.
Tony glanced up to see Steve looking at him in what looked like awe. Tony smiled shyly back and could see the glint of tears in Steves eye. When he reached the end he tried to put Indy in the chair next to Natasha but he clung on tighter. Not wanting a fight at that moment he changed course and headed to Bucky. “Think you can handle being best man and ring bearer holder?” Tony asked.
"Does it come off?" Tony asked.
“Yes, Cap’n Amer’ca.” Bucky smirked.
“Fine. I’ll text you the coordinates.” Fury disconnected the call and Tony turned back to Bucky and his son.  Bucky approached him when he realized he was no longer on the call.
"Well, maybe you were right. It would be nice to move on, say what we need to say whatever the outcome...it's just hard to start..." he trailed off.
Rhodey and Pepper were standing talking to each other a little away from Steve so Bucky sat next to his friend and passed the orange juice bottle to him. “Drink this. You need it.” Steve fumbled with the cap but managed to take large gulp. “Did you guys make a decision?”
Tony stiffened and his hand grasped Steve’s bicep. “No,” he spoke quickly. “Like this, wanna stay. Please”
“Me?” He pointed at himself.
“Hi,” he whispered.
“What’re you gonna name him?” Steve asked.
“Tony,” Steve whimpered.
Steve knocked on the door to what was now Bucky’s quarters, formerly Steve’s. Bucky answered a few seconds later, hair and clothes disheveled and looking like he hadn’t slept since before their mission to find the infant.
“Okay, baby. I’ll stay with you,” Tony conceded. Indy threw his arms around Tony’s neck and continued crying but some of the tension drained. He was mumbling something continuously but all Tony could hear against his neck was the occasional ‘da.’ “I need you to sit here for a minute while I talk to Bucky though.” He put Indy back in his seat and Indy protested but Tony didn’t give on this one. “I’m not leaving, but because of that I need to discuss something with Bucky. You’ll be able to see us but I need you to stay right here.” He put the llama in his arms from the table and grabbed Bucky’s forearm and pulled him into the kitchen.
After about twenty minutes Tony started to stir and finally rolled onto his back and looked up to Steve.
‘No, hey. You were asking something. What’s up?”
She straightened up and clapped her hands once. “Okay, here we go.” She gestured to the man to come over. He stood a couple feet away from them and began recording.
“‘Course you can,” Tony replied easily. “We’ll all help.”
There will be a part 3 for this particular storyline as well continuing on to the following morning. Should be posted soon!
“That’s great, Buck. You’re not alone, you know that.” Steve said happily.
“It was a nice ceremony,” Nat said.
“Got the forms to sign right here. Do you still wanna leave? It’s pretty late. You and Indy can sleep the rest of the night here if you want. Bucky and I will stay.”
"You have a son?" Steve asked, moving closer to a set of pictures that showed the boy as he grew up through the years. He tilted his head in curiosity when he saw a picture of the same boy sitting on the chest of a man, both of them wearing ball caps and t-shirts that had the symbol of his shield on them.
Tony turned his face into the closest part of Steve to him. “When can I go home?” He whispered. Steve winced, knowing that question was coming.
Indy’s eyes narrowed. “Poppy awake,” he said accusingly with a finger pointed at the baby sitting in Bucky’s lap.
“How’s he been eating?” Tony asked.
Bucky smiled sadly, catching Steve’s equally sad expression out of the corner of his eye.
Tony yawned. “I love you. Sorry I scared you today.”
“What?” Peter exclaimed.
“I’m not sure even Captain America can help with what that kids probably been through,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s shirt. Tony pushed back so he could look at Steve and cupped his face in his hands.
Tony stepped into Steve’s place and wrapped his arms around his waist, pulling him close. “Was he okay?”
“Indy, I know this might be hard to do, but I’d like to talk a little about the people you were with before your Papa.”
"She tried to hide it from me, but I talked to Jackson about it, too," Wade said as if it made all the sense in the world.
"Okay, before I ask work related questions," Mary started, turning towards Coulson, "I have to ask. How excited are you?" She got a surprised smile when she was sure that that Coulson just let out a little squeak. "Why do all my boys like Captain America?" She shook her head fondly.
Tony could have killed him there, if he could move, as Stane leaned over him, like he still had any right to be this close to Tony. "Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?" Tony wanted to lash out, to throw his body at Stane, to get him as far away from his son as possible. He had made a promise to Peter, to protect him from everything. "Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. now what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?"
"That's right," Tony smiled. he reached a door at the end of the hallway, a little panel slid out from the wall, lighting up. Tony put his hand on the panel, the panel scanning his hand, and there the sound of a lock unlatching. The door clicked and started to slide open.
"Through no fault of my own!"
"-and you're going to lay down and get some sleep." Tony finished and grabbed Steve's tablet. "I'm going to lay next to you, and use this, and stare adoringly, and creepily, while you sleep."
“Did you like my playing that much?” Tony asked as they left the room and headed down the hall.
"Good, you deserved it." Steve smirked while nudging Tony's foot.
Tony knocked on the door to the lab and walked in, drawing Bruce away from had happened. "You are a sight for sore eyes," he told the scientist. Bruce was able to see the black was peeking over the collar of his shirt. Tony threw on a jacket, covering most of the palladium poisoning.
A book dropped in front of him on the desk, and he glanced up to see Strucker, and his stupid monocle. "Wanda, let him read it. I think that he has earned a reprieve." Tony gasped when he felt the control slip from his body. The chains were gone, but the cuffs were still on, threatening to give him a shock if he tried to step out of line.
"I'm going over the ocean, and I'm going to a different country." Tony leaned up a little, taking his attention off of the engine. "Remember when I showed you that globe? The round one with all the blue on it?"
Tony was on his back on the bed, pillow under his head. His chest still moved at an even pace, almost looking as if he were merely just asleep. Dark circles under his eyes stood out even more, and his expressions reeked of restlessness. “Whoever has his mind is currently trying to get to him, again. At least that’s how it was explained to me. A third party has intervened, and we think that it’s trying to help him, but it’s like he’s been pulled from his body.”
"-unlimited power. And for what?" Loki's voice again. Was he still talking? "A warm light for all mankind to share?" Was he making a crack at Tony's efforts? It's what Howard was planning to do with the tesseract. "And then to be reminded what real power is."
Steve sighed. “So, we just had Indy’s first ever birthday party.” He plopped down on the sofa next to Bucky. Tony smirked.
“You are okay. I promise. You’re safe. I’m right here and Daddy’s right down the hall. We’ll do this quick.” He picked up a purple duck and placed it in Indy’s hand then got some baby body wash on a washcloth and started to clean Indy’s face and neck. “Can you show me how he swims in the water?” Steve asked when Indy didn’t move to play with the toy. Indy sniffled and gasped in a breath but he put the duck onto the surface of the water and moved it back and forth. Steve smiled. “Wow, he’s a good swimmer. He must really like the water,” Steve added. Indy whimpered.
“Coming?” Steve asked as he walked toward the door.
“I see you told him,” Bucky said to Tony.
“Yeah. So, was there a baby with you before Bucky took you away?”
“No,” he answered softly. He leaned forward a little to pick up the baby so Steve let go. “Wanna go see Papa?” Tony kissed Luca’s cheek and then offered him to Steve who took him immediately. “Pepper will be here in an hour, Steve, and I just,” Tony shook his head. “It’s overwhelming.”
He added before the doors closed. Steve sighed and turned back to Tony.
“Sweetheart, it’s okay. I’m fine, I promise,” Steve said, smiling softly to really sell it.
“No, Buppy come? Buppy?”
“He said he will and to take your time,” JARVIS replied.
"I will, later," Steve said seriously. "But, we're accepting now. Right Buck?"
“And you already have us,” Tony added with dawning comprehension. “So you didn’t need a wish?”
Steve and Tony re-entered the living area and Steve plopped down on the sofa next to them. “Pa pa pa pa,” Indy said happily as if he was singing it. Bucky smiled.
“Why don’t you go around to the other side and get in the back with him?” Tony said. Steve did that and climbed in the other side, holding Indy’s hand once he was settled. “See, Papa’s going to sit here the whole time and hold your hand. We’ll be at the store in no time and then we’ll take you out.” Tony leaned in closer to Indy. “Can you be our brave boy for a little while, huh?” Indy nodded, but it didn’t stop the tears from streaming down his face. Tony wiped them away with his thumbs. “I’m going to sit right in front of you, okay?” Tony nodded at Steve and then closed the back door, getting himself situated in the front passenger seat.
Steve shrugged. “But we know. I think he’s got pretty good timing, don’t you bug? That’s just what we wanted to hear today. All right, get your boxers off Tony and get in. I’ll hand him to you.” Tony sat gingerly in the warm bubbly water and held out his hands. Steve pulled the blanket off of Luca and handed him over. Tony sat the boy on this thigh and Luca splashed at the bubbles. Steve pushed his bright yellow rubber duck over to him and Luca laughed like it was the funniest thing he’d ever seen.
“Home?” He looked up at Steve. “I’m sorry. It’s my fault.”
“No bath,” Indy repeated, ignoring Bucky.
“You are a very good boy.” Bucky kissed his cheek. “Why don’t you cuddle Steve for awhile, he looks like he needs it.” Steve held his arms out right away like he was waiting for that so Tony let himself be taken back. He arranged him so he was cradled in his arms like a baby and rocked him a little and within minutes Tony was sound asleep.
“Buppy do,” Indy said, suddenly turning around with one of the puzzles and putting it on Bucky’s lap. Bucky looked to Steve who shrugged.
Steve made himself turn away to face Fury and Coulson. “So, you have this guy? Graves?” Coulson nodded. “Good, get him ready to go,” Steve ordered, staring them down in warning not to disagree.
“I gotta finish this, Cap,” he gestured vaguely to the table behind him.
Even though he had agreed on the jet, Tony nearly had a full blown panic attack once they landed at the thought of going to the hospital. He pleaded with them to go straight home and after Steve and Bruce had a discussion off of the side, Bruce feeling confident enough that he could easily treat both Tony and Luca in his lab, Steve agreed to skip the hospital for the time being.
“Yeah. Yeah I do.”
"Tony," Steves voice began solemnly. "I hope you're well. I," Steve paused and sounded unsure of himself. "We," he corrected, "need your help. I know I have no right to ask you for anything and I wouldn't blame you for saying no," he rushed. "But, you might be the only person..I mean, I don't want to guilt you into it...it's just Bucky needs help and, god, I just don't know who else to ask, Tony. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Call me, if you can. Please." Tony snapped the phone shut roughly and slammed it on the table.
Tony moved instantly, racing to the couch, putting Peter down on the couch, rubbing his back. "Jarvis, where are Pepper's pens??"
“The burger turned into grey sludge!” Bucky argued, looking back at her. “It almost put me off burgers!”
"But, that would have stayed dormant inside a normal person," Tony leaned in. He knew Bruce had thought of this as well. "What would have happened if you added that to someone that already had an active Serum in their bloodstream." Like Steve, or a clone of his.
Even the kiss had been amazing, and Tony had kissed a lot of people in his time. The two kisses with Steve had been so much better than any kiss he had had with George, and that had been Tony's latest, and rare, attempt at something serious.
He heard the dull whoosh seconds before Steve shouted to watch out, and he moving out of the way at the reflection in the glass. Another metal ball, this one as tall as the suit he was in. Tony watched it slam into the building, then start to drop down again. He changed position and flew down next to the ball, watching its descent but stopped short when his HUD flickers and red warnings started to pop up. There was a ripple in air again, and the ball simply vanished. Tony’s eyes widened and he straightened up to rise up in the air.
"Of course, Sir," the AI agreed.
Tony stared blankly as Steve let go of him and started walking down the hall. "I'm pretty sure I was the target of an assassin today!" Tony shouted after him. "Shouldn't that change things?"
Peter pushed his arms forward and backward, Jamie’s arms moving with him, and she let out another high pitched sound, that was one of her giggles. Peter grinned at her and moved his arms a little faster, making Jamie lean into him. Tony was leaning back on one arm as he watched the kids, his other hand gently carding through Peter’s hair as he played with his sister. Warm, but tired, brown eyes glanced up to the door to look at Steve. He gave him a soft smile.
"Be sure to record this, Jarvis," Mary said, trying not to laugh.
Tony sighed and ran his hand through his hair. Letting out a longer sigh, he turned to face Steve. “Alright. We have to face the music. There’s no changing this, no getting around it. We made our bed, now we have to sleep in it, and hope that no one throws the dirt on us just yet.”
"Come over?" Pete asked him hopefully.
"I am a personal fan of Crowley, he has decent taste in liquor, and understands the price of fine taste in decor. Even if it is too garish." Steve snorted, smiling.
"High School Sweethearts?" Tony wrinkled his nose up. "And is he gonna ask Peter to the Sadie Hawking's dance while drinking a shake next to the jukebox?"
Tony Stark leaned back in his chair, looking up at the ceiling through his sunglasses, waiting for the printer to spit out the results that three, maybe four, people were eager to see. He wasn't even supposed to be in the office today, he had called a personal day for himself, nursing a hangover from the night before that he had been hoping to not encounter by still drinking in the privacy of his own home.
“She knows the taste different than the ones we get on Pancake Saturday,” Peter said.
"Oh. Oh!" She had put together that he was Captain America. "Where's Tony? I need to try and stay on top of, a situation."
Tony pulled up the test results that had just finished, and some older ones. He had pulled a new blood sample from Jamie, to track progress on her growth rate after she cut two new teeth in seemingly record time. He had also pulled up the results of Steve’s sample interacting with the serum that he had synthesized at Strucker’s base.
Steve shook his head. "Not really."
"You're more than that," Steve said to him. "You led the damn charge to go down and get Coulson."
“Everything is all set, Captain,” the AI responded in the hallway. “There is a car waiting to take you and Sir to the jet. The house has been prepared to your specifications.”
"I wasn't going to wear them at first," Steve admitted, looking down at his matching blue converse. "I tried on the dress shoes, then tried these on, and I have to admit that these are far more comfortable."
“I told Julie to expect you to talk to her later about changing schools,” Steve threw in as he kissed the end of Tony’s nose. “She was on the phone earlier with the school. Bucky told me there was a lot of angry talking.”
“They’re gonna try,” Steve said. “We told everyone so they could try and get the day off of work.” Tony took that as a sign that Steve had no idea on if the spy twins were gonna show up or not. A part of Tony thought that it was unfair to keep them in limbo like that, but he also wasn’t entirely in a stable state of mind at the moment. “But all of your friends from school are going to be there. It’ll be fun seeing them again, I bet. Uncle Rhodey said he was going to try and make it, too.”
"Because, I'd like to come over, and talk about this without someone from the company there." Mary looked at the paper, then back up at him, but he was looking forward at the elevator doors as they moved down to the first floor. "So, uh, what is his name?"
“I don’t know. Don’t let Tony see until you get back to the Tower,” Pepper suggested. “I’m on my way there now, I’ve got the PR team coming to the offices to prepare for this.”
“Then roll on your back and pick up the baby,” Tony said with a soft chuckle. “We don’t have to physically get up, someone just needs to wake her, and preferably the boys, up from a nap. Go on, Papa, do your parental duty.” Steve grinned against Tony’s skin when he said Papa, something warming in his chest when Tony reminded him that he actually was a parent now, and a parent with Tony no less.
“Of course I tried!” Howard exclaimed. “I tried for years, but they never responded to anything that I did. There was no other conclusion than to say that they were corrupted. I figured they had been damaged in his last mission.”
"Those would take some time," she countered, eyes narrowing a little at him. He was up to something.
Upstairs Tony could smell the amazing scent of cooking food, and not pancakes. Peter wasn't up yet if Steve hadn't been conned into cooking pancakes. He detoured back to his room, opting to change his clothes and take a quick shower, before braving the kitchen and Steve Rogers.
"And you said that we would all be doomed," Steve recited, remembering their talk at Mary and Coulson's wedding. "She would be just like me, and that's not even worrying about when she's old enough to date."
Basically!
Strange almost looked apologetic. “I’ll do what I can.” Steve’s shoulders deflated a little. “Head down the hall, I’ll lead you back to your Tower at least. I’ll take you vehicles in as well.” Steve nodded a little and turned. He briefly leaned down, using one hand to grab his shield, and let it slide onto his back before gripping onto Tony again.
Peter, his son, his little boy. Tony sat up suddenly, moving to his feet. Where was- he heard the ringtone of his phone and snatched it up off the floor. The picture loaded almost instantly, and he let out a breath. Peter was asleep in his bed, face peaceful, on his side, hair a mess of loose curls.
"He wanted me to turn back to grab it," Tony said with a smirk. "He thinks he's going on camera." Pepper and Tony both shared a laugh and Steve frowned a little. Tony watched Pepper walk over to Steve putting out her hand to shake.
"Pretty sure that you shouldn't mention that," Steve said with a soft chuckle, his arm going out to lay over Tony's waist, hand resting on his back.
"It's a little more difficult than that. And I'll have to leave you to dwell on that thought, because I have to go." He grabbed his duffle and the bag from the side table.
"Yeah, sure, why not," Tony said quickly as Steve put the cupcakes down next to him, on the cooking rack.
He held onto Steve's other hand, then leaned up a little to kiss him gently. "I trust you." Steve wrapped his arm around Tony, trapping his hand on the arc reactor between them, and kissed Tony again, deeply, pouring how much that statement actually meant into the kiss. Tony couldn't help but melt into it, knowing that Steve got it. He knew what Tony was giving with the action, knew how hard it was, and he just, got it.
"We'll get the suit, Tony, don't worry," Steve tried soothing him. He looked over and saw the quinjet coming down, hovering just above the street. He picked up Tony again and ran for the jet, his shield already on his back. Natasha put her hand out, pulling the two of them on board and Clint was already off and headed back for the Tower. Tony's head lolled to the side, eyes closing as he passed out, the arc reactor dim, but still running.
“It’s about the only show that we can watch and stay up to date on,” Tony said with a nod. “We’re still trying to catch up on Supernatural, but we’re close to that.” Danielle hummed, nodding. “Yeah, it’s taking us a while, but that happens when you have two kids. And when you’re an Avenger, of course.”
"It was lots of fun," Peter grinned at his grandparents as they told the story. Tony smiled to himself as he ate, listening to the boys. Today had been one of the most normal days, which made it a very not normal day for Tony Stark. He had worn his hat and sunglasses, and he was pretty sure that he hadn't had his picture taken at the park, so there was another plus. Tony thought that he would give up all the fame, the traveling, the big fancy mansions and towers, if he could spend every day with his son like today. He'd want to keep some of the money though, so he could support Peter, indulge all his curiosities in learning new subjects and hobbies.
"So, he really intended to make Tony into another Super Soldier?" Steve asked quietly. He had volunteered for it, had volunteered for the experiment. Steve had known exactly what he was getting into when he signed up, Dr Erskine had made Steve completely aware of everything that could happen and gave him every chance to back down. Tony would have been a child, and would have done it just to get his parents to notice him. If he had been given a choice.
Pulling out his phone, he snapped a picture of the street. The glass globes over the lights reflecting off the glass windows of the little shops still open, couples walking down the sidewalk. Steve lowered his phone, catching sight of a couple with a little boy between them. The boy couldn't be older than Peter, holding the hands of his parents, letting them swing him in the air every other step. He missed Peter. And Tony.
“You two were made for each other,” Pepper said, shaking her head. “This is why I stay in California, so all I have to worry about is the company. I’m putting all of the PR team on you- no, I’m hiring a new team, just for you two.”
“But I have my favorites!” Tony’s voice was muffled as he stepped into the shower.
“Oh my girl, my precious girl,” Steve cried softly. Vee let out soft mewls in response. “I’m here, I’m here,” he repeated. “I’m back, I’m not going anywhere.”
"We have an idea, but we're not sure yet," Steve admitted. "We're looking into it now, but I highly doubt that it's going to be information that we want released."
“With one big difference,” Tony said looking at him. “What changed when she went Black Widow on Black Widow?”
"Well, I'm not my company." His brain stopped for just a second. He knew who Was the company at this moment. He gripped the pictures, leaving the drink, and headed outside, the two women following behind him.
"I never knew about this place," Mary said, leaning against the back of the couch, crossing her arms over her chest.
"Either that or we coulda just kept living together," Steve said tentatively, not sure how much Bucky was remembering. The light blue eyes that met his said that Bucky didn't remember much, and it was a surprise to even remember that.
"What?" Tony blinked rapidly. "That's a pretty outrageous claim. And what are you doing Baltimore?"
“What spell?” Rhodey asked, and Tony wanted to groan. This was going on far longer than he actually had the patience for.
"We tested it for extreme weather conditions, J," Tony answered automatically.
playing in the background, so then the next time it happens we have to replay the episodes we missed," Tony continued, stealing another olive from Steve's plate this time. Steve trade plates with Tony, putting another spoonful of green, then black olives on the plate, before filling up the empty one. Steve had planned for that to happen. "In reality it should not take us over two months to make to Season Five."
“Nothing wrong with liking those cooking competitions, just as long as you don’t try putting me on one.”
"That's pretty much her normal setting." Tony shrugged a little, adjusting the small backpack. "Well, when it comes to me. She puts board meetings to shame, that's for sure. But she's good with Peter, and she never talks bad about me in front of him, so that's about all I can ask for."
They were interrupted by a knock on the door, and Mary wandered over, opening the door. Her parents stood there, Peter in front of them. he grinned at his mom and ran inside, then stopped when he saw Tony. "Daddy!" Tony couldn't help the big grin that appeared every time he heard Peter call him that. He crouched down as Peter ran over to give him a hug, the little boy wrapping his arms around his neck. Tony knew there would come a day when Peter would think he's too old to call him Daddy anymore.
Steve's eyes shot back up to Tony's when he started talking. He wasn't wrong. Mary had taken him out the first couple days after he woke up to get some clothes. He had been a little embarrassed that a woman, that wasn't his mother, had taken him out to buy his 'unmentionables', but he had been assured that it was just his '40's mentality talking. It helped a little that Mary had brought Peter with them, the little boy pointing to a store in the mall that "Daddy goes to all the time." Steve smirked a little, he had his answer thanks to a mini Stark.
"Hello, Peter," Coulson smiled at him. "I see you were finally able to get a new hoodie."
So again, thank you, everyone! Seriously!
"I'm not getting sleep anytime soon," Tony told him, but kept going on so Steve couldn't question him. "And getting stuff that you'll need for Jamie is going to be more important. So, while I'm at my meeting, which has nothing to do with the business, you should take Jamie to Bruce. When I get back we'll go out and buy probably too much stuff, and I won't even bother to listen to you try and tell me to not spend the money. And when we get back, we'll have to prepare for Peter coming home." Tony had effortlessly moved from Steve's arms to grab his coffee again, mouth still moving a mile a minute. "And we'll have to contact the hospital in DC, because we can't leave Meg down there for long, and we have to find out when she can be discharged. Let's just convert the floor above my workshop into an artist studio for both of you. I'll need your input and direction, but I think it would be good. You can take Peter there for lessons-"
"You're faith in me is every so appreciated, Sir." Tony leaned up, his other hand sliding along Steve's jaw, and kissed him slowly.
But, Steve supposed that in this different time period, the same could be said for what Tony was doing for Peter. Enemies of Anthony Stark might go after his workers, and someone like Tony if his work was really that important, and that could lead to a possibility of going after Peter. He knew it was far-fetched, but a parent would do whatever they had too to keep their children safe. Steve knew that first hand from his Mother.
“Coffee is a magical elixir that should never be limited.”
"Gives me time to make him a cake for when you get back, then," Mary countered.
"What do you mean?" Steve took a step forward, brows crinkling together a little. Tony could have worded that better.
Hullo!! Yes it's been a while hasn't it my lovelies?? SO yes, there is going to be another part to this series, and coming soon. I promise! I have indeed seen both Civil War and Infinity War, and all the movies in between, and will be working those in in their own way. As usual, there are no worries about spoilers with the more recent movies. I like to give about between 6-10 months after a movie comes out before I started using spoiler-y items in my stories, giving everyone a chance to either see it or learn about it.
"Yeah, well, technically he hit me." Tony took in a breath, letting Jarvis take control of the directions for a few seconds. "Now, are you going to come by and see what I'm working on? Peter misses you, too." Guilt trip, that's what good parents did, right?
Steve was back, there were fireworks in a couple of hours, Peter had confessed to liking living with Tony. It had been a really good day. He even showed his private collection to Steve, Steve Rogers! The last person on the planet that he would have wanted to show that room too, but it had been worth it, seeing his reaction.
“Don’t joke about that.” Tony pointed a finger in Steve’s face, making his eyes go crossed a little. “I think they could be more dangerous than Dr Doom if they put their mind to it.” Steve creased his brows. “Okay, should have picked a better villain. But, my point is, when we come back, your bestie is going to be a babysitting pro, or a broken man.” Now Steve was raising his eyebrows. “These are our kids we’re talking about.”
“I have a bad feeling overall,” Steve commented and tossed his phone to Bucky, starting the car.
"I could fit him in one hand!" Tony chuckled, leaning against Steve's shoulder. "He was like a hamster!"
"I'm also really good for it," Steve smirked, pressing a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth. He froze then, pulling in a sharp breath after a distinct 'plop' sound. Tony was biting his lip, trying not to laugh as he watched the small dollop of fruit puree slide down Steve's neck. Jamie was smiling, her fingers in her mouth.
Steve's mouth opened a little. "You made a pen that can make any color it sees?" He looked up at Tony to see him nodding with a smile. "This is, this is amazing, Tony. It's seriously genius." Tony preened a little bit, and Steve smiled. "Thank you, this is really great."
"Well, the arc reactor is running off of palladium, and it's implanted in my chest, and it's keeping me alive." Tony rushed everything out at once. "And I need your help trying to find a suitable replacement element."
"We don't live in a dangerous place," she tried to argue.
"Dr Banner," Steve said, sticking his hand out to the man.
"You know the rules," Peter told him, nodding like it was the simplest thing. "Only on Saturdays, or birthdays, or really special days!"
"Steve Rogers is a little shit," Tony said as he leaned in to kiss him again. "And I have taken on the burden of keeping you from corrupting the rest of the world. I really should be given an award, I'm thinking the Silver Star, or the Purple Heart."
"Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive," Rhodey said. So they did see his handy work then.
“Your heart started to beat faster when you got excited,” Bucky said, voice giving away that he had actually been taking a nap. “You were trying too hard to scare me.”
It took Tony a few seconds for his brain to cycle through what William might possibly be talking about before his eyes widened. "Wha?" Intelligently said. "I mean, of course," he nodded quickly. "You're sure about this?"
"Well, it just seems a bit easier for a couple of reasons." Steve settled back to lean on his elbows, eyes always on Jamie. "We're still not exactly sure how she ages, physically and mentally, with the Serum, and Tony and I talked about it, and we really shouldn't have her birthday come before Peter's." Bruce raised an eyebrow. "He's not Jamie's biggest fan right now, and while I'm confident that that will change eventually, I'm really not going to be taking any chances. If there's something that I can handle in this big mess of life at the moment, it's making sure that Peter doesn't think we're going to start ignoring him, or stop loving him."
"Surgery can be a long process," Tony tried to explain. He didn't know what was happening, and he was just waiting for an update or phone call himself. "Surgeons sometimes need time to make sure that everything is working just it used, too. They won't let Granma leave until they're positive that she's going to be good as new." Tony tapped down on the panic that was trying to crawl up into his chest. He had no idea what was wrong, didn't even know if the chances were good in her surgery. Steve hadn't look all that optimistic when he had woken up.
Tony watched her go then went back over to Steve, who was holding onto the baby in one arm, sitting up more so she could curiously look around. "You took to holding her pretty fast."
“You said you’re going to make more room in your place, since Mr Steve and Jamie are moving in, right?” Tony nodded as Peter started to talk. He seemed shy about something. “And, you two love each other, right?”
Having Peter in his life had changed Tony, there was no doubt about that. Even before Afghanistan happened, before Iron Man, Tony had started changing, for the better. Maybe, if Tony really got dug deep down, he could admit that it wouldn't be so terrible to actually have a family, with maybe another kid. Not that that would be happening anytime soon. He couldn't even promise to keep Peter safe, much less another kid. And technically, he was a single parent. Yeah, Mary was there to do most of the work, and sometimes Tony felt horrible that he couldn't do more, but Mary was dating Coulson, and Tony was single.
“Like you had the upper hand in that duel with Stark?” Bucky was smirking at Steve, an open challenge.
"Oh, yeah, well," Steve shrugged a little, biting his lip as if she could see the smile on his face. "I had to ask her advice! And she seemed like a great source of knowledge, first hand and all, and she knows who you are."
"Can he do any magic with just his voice?" Steve asked, this time looking at Thor. Thor had gone over to Loki and carefully removed the gag, handing the bottle of water to Loki. The skin was red where the gag had been.
“Tony?” Steve called, trying to draw his attention back up. Tony could hear Jamie crying in the back. “Tony are you alright?” Steve asked more urgently.
"Meg know you call her Dame?" Steve asked with a raised eyebrow.
(See the end of the chapter for
But, Steve could see that Stark wasn't the only one being affected by the events of Monaco. Peter was a little more morose as well, and Steve figured that with all the trouble going on, it must be negatively affecting his Dad's work as well. Steve hadn't seen Tony come to the building since the mess started, and if Steve tried to spend a little more time with Peter to help him try and forget about it, then it was worth it if it worked.
“Then she can be closer all over your aging body. Seriously, I don’t think I can move now, my body has locked down. You’re going to have to get a stretcher and slide me on like a mummified corpse.” Steve rolled his eyes and Tony leaned his head back.
“You don’t know what I’m thinking,” he said back to her.
“Don’t!” Tony shouted as he moved backwards away from everyone. “Fuck!” He turned and practically ran from the room and down the hall. Steve looked over at the others, and it was Rhodey’s eyes that he caught. There was a slight nod, and Steve was turning to follow the genius. Rhodey would take care of the now unwelcome guests in the Penthouse.
"You've been asleep for so long, and we were all sad, and Daddy said that if we took care of you that you would wake up faster, and so we took real good care of you, but you wouldn't wake up, and, and, and," Peter trailed off as he dissolved into soft sobs, holding onto Mary as tight as he dared.
"This is the friend that encourages your bad music habit?" Tony asked, not moving from Steve's arms, so they were forced to practically waddle to the back door.
"Go Rachel!" Tony cheered, ignoring Steve's admonishing look.
"I think he's almost done. Not great yet, though," Wade said before walking into the bathroom. Peter scrambled from Tony's lap to follow his best friend, and crush, into the bathroom. Tony rolled his eyes a little before shutting them for a few seconds. As he shut them, he saw a little blonde girl, a toddler, with curly hair, running around. Bright blue eyes as she giggled, running as Steve chased her, both grinning. Tony sucked in a breath and his eyes shot open.
Tony took a deep breath before turning on his foot, sliding down onto the bed. Mary kept a hold on his wrist, but her hand slid down to rest over his. “Bruce and I figured out a new element. Amazingly it was Howard that did the ground work, hiding an element in the design of the Stark Expo. I saw it the opening night of the Expo. It took a day or so to get made, but we got it worked out, and I couldn’t be feeling better.” He pulled the collar of his shirt down to show her that the black lines had disappeared.
"Doesn't sound like you'll be doing that when you get home," Yinsen said with a little smirk. Tony nodded. He sure as hell would change that
"I was right, though." Tony tilted his head up a little, going from one set of baby blue eyes to another. "We're already doomed. Did you see the way she pat my nose? Like she was trying to comfort me? The death of me, Steven Rogers, the two of you is what you will be." Steve smiled fondly down at him and Tony felt his heart melt at the sight. That was a smile just for Tony. Well, he might have to share it with the new addition, but Tony had gotten it first.
Steve saw Phil already in the kitchen, serving out food, while Peter and Wade were sitting at the table. “Papa!” Peter called out happily when he saw him, turning and raising his arms for a hug as Steve walked over. “Is Daddy feeling better?”
Tony couldn’t help but smirk a little when he heard the familiar whimpering pouts of young Jamie. As they entered the room, the little girl was hanging onto Steve, not wanting to let go and be separated. He set Peter down on his feet again, and the boy ran over to stand next to Mary. Phil had Jamie’s diaper bag, and Peter’s backpack over his shoulder.
"Still not having video sex," he told Tony.
"And inflate your ego even more?"
"Can't say I'm not glad to see them go," Hill murmured, handing Thor a bottle of water. IN her other hand she held a silver briefcase, one that no doubt held the tesseract. Thor nodded to them, and opened the door behind him, Tony closely following behind him. He could stand to be in a room with Loki again over Fury, and wasn't that just peachy.
Mary looked over at Steve when he had gotten up and walked over to her and the tablet. He had heard the man start to lose himself, something that Steve had heard many times before from soldiers in the war. Tony was having a flashback, suffering from PTSD. Steve could relate with his nightmares of losing Bucky, at the very least.
"Hey, Petey," Tony said to the sleeping boy. "Time to sleep in a bed." Peter made a sound of protest, Tony rubbing his back. "Yeah, I know, but it's late and you're sleepy."
The man, at the Expo. That wasn't someone replacing him, that was actually Captain America. Captain America was alive, and SHIELD had found him. He would be very angry later about why no one had told him that he had been found, and awake; he was a Stark! His Dad helped Make Captain America. But there was one other image that caught his eyes.
There was banging at the door now, and yelling. It was happening a little faster than Tony thought, but it seemed they were being discovered already. The blast and the boom from the bomb threw him off, and he could see the shocked look on Yinsen's face as well.
"The same model as Captain Rogers," his AI confirmed.
There was a map on a grid, most of it crossed out, coordinates written on top. One spot had been circled and colored blue. Steve glanced at the other papers, looking official and typed, and one looking like a letter. "This was the work he did trying to find you," Tony said quietly. "He had been putting together the presentation to get another ship out there to search, saying that he had new tech that could search deeper in the ocean, through the ice. I assume that's probably what SHIELD used to find you..... After nearly fifty years though, the Board would need some convincing to fund the expedition again. He kept searching for you up until the day he died."
"How many years later, though?" Bruce asked, taking off his glasses. Tony thinks about it, and he's right. There at least a seven year gap between him and Bruce meeting. "They could have easily stolen this in the years after Howard died." Tony turned to look back at the formula that Bruce had made while working on the Super Soldier Serum for Howard Stark.
"There's a reason that she lives so far away," Steve said as he tucked his legs under himself now. "I really don't know if I could keep up with her energy all the time."
Tony sat up, reluctantly pulling away from his boyfriend.  “Barnes, you got plans for the rest of the afternoon?”
“That’s great, Tony. Thank you for handling all that. I can’t even imagine how you managed it all honestly.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t think its on the sheets, just my pants,” Steve told him sadly.
Tony smirked but stood up and headed to Indy’s room. The door was open slightly so he poked his head in. “Hey Darling, you didn’t get very far.”
“How’s he doing?” Bucky asked.
“Anything for you,” Steve said sincerely.
“That’s okay,” Tony told him. He placed the hat on top of the llama instead and it fell down almost covering its whole body since it was so small. Indy giggled. Bucky walked by heading toward the other end of the table and Indy grabbed at him even though he couldn’t reach.
Peter sniffled. “I’m not leaving til we get them back. I mean, it’s your home, I’ll leave of course if you want me to, but I’m not going to school or anything. I’m gonna keep an eye on them. And you,” he added. Steve tightened his hold.
Steve shook his head like he couldn't quite believe it.
“Yeah, you can. Do you want to?” Steve asked hopefully. Bucky didn’t answer.
“He’s cleaning up in the kitchen. I’m going to give you a quick bath because you’re very messy,” he said softly. He turned into the bathroom and put the llama on the counter and sat Indy next to it, holding him steady with his hands on the boys sides. “I know you hate this, but we’re going to do a quick bath to get you clean so you can look nice for your party. Can you be a good boy for me?” Indy started to tear up.
“JARVIS told me Indy called you dad? Was that what’s upsetting you?”
“It’s not your privacy I’m invading. He’s three. If he did or said something I need to know about, I’m going to get that information however I have to. He want’s to act out like this and not answer me, I get that. But you,” he waved his hand at him. “I asked nicely. I want to help.”
“How are you doing, darling?” He asked, walking up to Steve. He helped pull the front of his shirt down once Steve got it over his head. Steve shook his head.
“Great. Thanks, J. I’ll grab the stuff and put the bassinet together for you if you want?”
Tony sighed. “Okay, yeah, maybe. But it wasn’t. We can’t dwell on that we just have to deal with what did happen. I’m fine.” He kissed Steve and felt him melt into it until JARVIS interrupted them.
“I hold the baby?” He asked, reaching out now that they were close and pulling her hand closer.
Steve looked over at Tony and noticed him discreetly wiping the tears off his cheeks. “Come here,” Steve said pulling Tony into his embrace.
Bucky wasn’t sure how long they’d been in this room. His watch, phone, all his gear had been stripped off of him. He was sure, after a through inspection, that the only way out would be through that door. He hoped one of their captors came soon so he could get a gauge as to what he was dealing with. He was pretty sure Tony had fallen asleep but he was pressed so close that Bucky couldn’t see his face. He had been quiet for awhile, his breathing slow and even. So Bucky kept pacing.
“He’s heavily guarded, man,” Clint sighed.
Steve stood Indy up on the counter and pulled the pajamas off the rest of the way. He checked in the waistband of Indy’s diaper and it was only damp not dirty so he pulled the tabs and took the diaper off of him while Indy still stood there, balling it up and throwing it in the trash. He gave him a quick wipe with a baby wipe to get the worst off. “Ok, sweetheart, in we go.” Steve picked him up and Indy’s cries picked up in volume.
“I’m not going far. I have to clean up your mess.”  Tony looked sad but didn’t seem to have an argument for that.
“You wanna tell me this story instead?” Steve asked him. He didn’t get a verbal response but felt another shove at his leg.
“You’re all right,” Bucky said quickly.
“Why don’t I get set up so we can get to those puzzles?” She looked to Tony who showed her into the room and she took a place at the end of the table and began to unpack her duffle bag. “So, I think it would be best if just one of you stayed with him during the session.” Tony nodded.
“No, just want you,” he reached out for Tony’s hand and Tony smirked.
“Steve, I’m gonna go get some work done,” Tony said quietly to Steve.
“There,” he said stepping back again.
“Hey, so, what are your thought’s on Indy having a doll?”
Steve leaned over and Clint pulled Tony to him. “What size are you huh? How old are you?” Tony held up 4 fingers. “Four? Are you sure?” Clint asked exaggeratedly. Tony nodded excitedly. The elevator stopped on Steves floor and they stepped out. Clint held Tony up in the air as far as his arms could go. “You don’t weigh much,” he told the boy. “You’re just a little peanut!” Tony giggled and flapped his arms like he was flying. “I don’t think you’re in 4 year old clothes,” he added, more for Steve. He brought Tony back down. “Ok, go back to Steve.”
"I told you!" Tony exclaimed, throwing his arms up. "Jarvis!"
"Just a couple more people in his life," Steve added.
Tony carded his hands through Peter's hair a few times before he leaned over to drop a kiss on the top of his head, and get up from the bed. Mary looked at him, but he just gave her a soft smile. "I'm gonna go tell Agent, and I'm gonna give your parents some time here." He turned to head out, catching both eyes from the Fitzpatrick's. Rachel nodded to him before walking over to the bed and to her daughter, and William put a hand on Tony's arm, for just a second. Tony didn't say anything but left the room a moment later, closing the door most of the way before his feet propelled him down the hall.
"I'll walk out with her," Tony said suddenly, standing up from his chair, pocketing the paper. Pepper looked at him, raising an eyebrow. "I was going home after this anyway." He grabbed his jacket, sunglasses still on, and slipped it on as a silent Mary blinked, picking up the diaper bag and car seat. He gave a little wave to Pepper, holding the door open for Mary, (he wasn't that much of an ass to not get the door for the new mother), and left walking next to her, hands in his pockets.
Steve closed his eyes tightly, gave one last squeeze to Tony's hand before letting go, giving a little lean to get up. He had to shake it off. He was in the plane again, he was going down, and could see the water and the ice rushing up to meet him. He knew it had to be done, to save the world, but this time he hadn't lost consciousness. He gasped, freezing water filling his lungs, burning his eyes, the cold soaking straight to his bones. Steve let out a strangled whimper through clenched teeth, and his eyes shot open when two warm hands were pressed to his cheeks. Tony was in front of him, his amber eyes clear with worry, and patience.
Mary waved her hand, shaking her head a little. "Don't worry about it. The only thing I'll say is that I'm not going to tell my son that you're Captain America. For two reasons."
“You know it’s way past your bedtime little squirt.” He told her, his fingers coming up to tap along her back. She made a little squeak, then whined and tried to push his hand away. “Oh no, Stevie trusted me with you, and you need to sleep.”
"Yeah! Means she was born in Italy." Peter nodded, continuing again. Steve kept eating as Peter explained. "Daddy really can't cook anything else that good, at least not without help from Mommy, Uncle James, or Jarvis." The little boy took another bite of ice cream, the bowl almost empty. "Sometimes Jarvis has Dummy come up," the little boy giggled, like he had just told a joke.
"Cleaner than the other we found," Clint told him. "Not even a dust bunny left over. Thinkin’ they started to move out of these places first."
"Mary," Tony said sternly, and she turned her head to look at him. "He's going to be Fine. And probably in ten minutes he's going to run down here, see you, and expecting pancakes." She blinked then nodded at him. "You work on the pancakes, and I will go get him."
"555-1719," Peter recited carefully, and clearly.
"Yeah, I'm here," Tony replied quietly. "Um, I was going to say that I've got a jet waiting for you." Steve could hear the exhaustion and sadness in Tony's voice. He was in need of rest as much as Peter had been, maybe more so. Tony had gone straight from the trouble at the Stark Expo to the trouble with Loki, and Bruce had mentioned something about his arc reactor to Peter back at the medical site. "I'll fly you both as close as I can, the air is a no-fly-zone around New York at the moment. There'll be a driver waiting to take you the rest of the way here. I'll have a room set up right next to,..." Tony drifted a little before saying Mary's name. "I'll have everything set up. Peter’s sleeping right now, and he's fine, I made sure of that. I have Jarvis monitoring him, as well-"
“That’s good,” he said with a slight hum.
“No, it’s called giving the two guys from a different century an actual shot,” Tony shot back. “Sam likes to do a lot of feinting, usually to the tight because of your metal arm,” he said to Bucky. “Steve, when you get the ball, barrel down the center, do not let Rhodey push you to the sides. Use your agility if you have too, it’s not cheating if you jump over him.”
"Alright, we should see if we can't figure out this carrying method, huh? What did Mary call it? A moby wrap?" He looked down at Jamie. "We should probably go to her for help....."
Tony hummed a little. "Want a drink? I need a drink."
"Are they coming in through the garage?" Tony asked, as practically hopped down the stairs. At the bottom though he took a deep breath, feeling a bit of tightness in his chest. He shook his head a little, before heading down the hall."
"If you talking about the lack of alcohol, no, I have no forgotten what day it is," Tony informed her. He was going to be talking to Peter soon, and he was always very careful not to drink, the one rule of Mary's that he never broke.
"You had your hand all over this," Pepper said to him. "Don't ignore your part in making this special day." Tony nodded a little, still not looking over at her. "I thought that after the wedding I would either find you still here, or running back to the Tower."
"Sir," he managed to get out, trying to catch his breath. "It's the Avengers, they're here!" A low boom could be heard overhead, punctuating his statement.
Steve followed him out and to the kitchen, walking quietly past the still sleeping Sam. "Must be familiar for you?" Steve asked Tony as he instantly moved to the coffee maker. The older man glanced back at him, eyebrow raised. "Taking care of a baby?"
"I'm on a time constraint, actually," Tony admitted. "Mr Hayes has decided to try extortion, and now it'll become blackmail, and he's going to reveal Peter." There was a gasp from Pepper. "Pull out the prepared papers, call the conference."
“He could be a Naveen, but, I don’t think works that well.” Tony raised an eyebrow at him. “Daddy would totally fall for that singing voice as Prince Eric though,” and Peter was giggling as Tony raised both eyebrows now. Steve was probably going to pay for this in private. Worth it. “Oh.” Steve smiled then, then leaned down to whisper in Peter’s ear, and he started to giggle and nod.
"I don't have PTSD," Tony bit out. "Just nightmares sometimes, it's fine." Tony pushed himself up from the couch.
"Experimenting with Jarvis to get some kind of gauge of old she might be?" Steve nodded. "Did you figure out what name you're putting on the birth certificate?"
“I was thinking some alone time for a few days,” Steve said, leaning down to and kissing along the shell of Tony’s ear. “Maybe head to Malibu.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “We didn’t to spend a lot of time there before, and it was nice.” Steve wrapped an arm across Tony’s chest, pressing their cheeks together. “I’m thinking that maybe that vacation idea of yours isn’t too horrible. It’s good even.”
Bruce's eyes hardened, then softened after a second. "Tony is a very bright individual." Steve nodded his agreement. "And he was still young when Howard approached me. I'm still not really sure how he had heard of my research, but that's of little importance anymore. I didn't know of what he had intended until much later."
Strange lifted an eyebrow at him, stopping just at the bottom of the steps, a gap still between the two men. Tony had pushed his hands into his jacket pockets. “And last I remembered, you were well on your way to drinking yourself into an early grave. I’m sure there were some drugs involved, as well. I thought for sure that I would see you end up on a table in front of me.” Tony nose twitched a little.
"But not this time?" He asked.
"It should be for the price you paid for it." Tony smiled when Pepper walked into the kitchen. "All the tables have been set, the flowers in place, and the DJ has set up her stuff." Tony nodded and took the tablet from Pepper's hands.
"Hey," Tony said loudly, cutting off her frantic rambling. "What's happening? What's wrong?"
She chuckled and nodded. "Thank you, Tony. I'll be sure to stick around, since I know Wade won't want to leave."
Tony grunted as he hit the ground, the HUD glitching a little.
"We need more room up there," Tony said simply.
“All my teachers kept saying that I had a natural talent, so I kept moving up in classes,” she said, looking between all of them. “My Aunt always paid for the classes…. Oh. I think I see where you’re going with this.” Tony nodded a couple times. “But, she always told me that they were for self-defense. I didn’t participate in any tournaments, didn’t win any awards or anything.”
“Tell me,” Steve said as he moved his head down, kissing across Tony’s collar bone. “Tell me everything you feel and see. Please?” One of his hands slid down Tony’s chest, down to his waist, tracing muscles, and bones down to his hip.
"You were there for three months?" Steve asked carefully. This could go very well, or very badly.
"You said that you wanted something more casual, and small," Tony said. "I've got little suit jackets on the boys, and we all compromised by wearing Chucks." Tony rocked on his feet, and when Mary looked down she saw that both Tony and Steve were also wearing Converse sneakers. Tony grinned back at her, hands in his pockets.
"I think she's going to be an athlete of some kind," Tony said as Steve leaned over his hip to get closer to the baby girl. "Peter was a quick learner, but he wasn't this active of a crawler. Hey, J? You recording this?"
"Are you pretending to be angry because you don't want to think about what the implications of the presents mean?" Steve asked, and was rewarded with silence. He pulled out a pair of pants, then went to the socks drawer. "Your only family lives hundreds of miles away, and we both know that while they are lovely people, you're not on their list of people to visit for the holidays. It's a half-sibling, and they've got her family, and her husband's family to visit, all in different states."
"Practicing in one of my Iron Man suits, probably." Tony brushed off the Mark IV armor a little before closing the glass doors again. "Had to make a deal with the military before they broke down the doors. But, only Rhodey can use the suit, so I feel moderately okay about that."
Tony rolled his eyes, then set Jamie back down on the floor by the twins. They all seemed to squeal at each other, in a hidden baby language, and started to play together. “Who was on the phone?” Tony asked, leaning against the back of a chair so he could keep an eye the kids.”
"I can wake your woman up." Tony froze. He vaguely noticed Steve turned his head to look at him. "I know she sleeps, and I can tell you when she would wake."
“You’d think he was excited about something!” Steve laughed with him, the two men following him. “What did Pepper want? Media backlash we didn’t expect?”
“I think it’s a little early to ask that,” Steve told him as they got onto the elevator, Tony hitting the button for the top floor. “Although the lobby is nice.”
"I can try to prescribe him sleeping aids," Bruce said, knowing that it wasn't what Mary wanted to hear. "I can't make him seek help, none of us can."
Steve smiled at him. “Looked like you were having some fun with her, too.” Peter’s cheeks pinked a little. “Well, someone has to show her to proper way to have fun, right? And you’ve already been teaching her so much, no one else better to do it.” He wouldn’t tell Peter than he had overheard what he said about Jamie to Rapunzel.
“Alright! I give in.” Tony cheered and leaned in to kiss him. Steve was going to lean in more, but Tony pulled back, and undid the straps to put Jamie back on the bed. “Get dressed first, and maybe there can be some shared personal space between royalty.”
“He’s currently in a meeting,” he told her. He wasn’t sure if Tony had told Pepper exactly where he was going yet. “He should be almost done. What’s wrong?”
"Where do you live?" He asked as they walked to the elevator, the doors opening as soon as he pressed the button. He glanced down at the carrier, holding the small baby, eyes closed as it slept. He hadn't even asked for the baby's name.
"Brucie-bear!" Tony grinned, running over to the man, hugging him, making the man uncomfortable with all the stuff he was still holding. "You've let your hair grow out, I like it."
After a couple of moments, Mary softly cleared her throat. "I'm going to go get Peter now, and I'll let you explore more." She set down the keychain on one of the bedside tables. "The blue key is to your apartment, and the red one is to my apartment. There is a phone out int he living room, it's going to look mighty different from what you're used too, but there's a list of phone numbers next to the phone, along with some instructions. If you have any questions before I get back, please feel free to call."
“You’re optimistic.” Bucky grunted, unwrapping the mint to pop it in his mouth. His eyebrows went up at the taste, and Meg smirked.
“I have been,” Pepper smiled at Mary, the two women suddenly having a bonding point.
“Do Hydras count as dragons?” Tony actually giggled when Steve lightly punched his arm, the doors opening to their floor.
"You'll have eaten it all?" Steve asked and Coulson nodded. "For a small second I thought you were going to say that Mary was pregnant."
"Yeah, well, I work around here, and I just got out of a zoning meeting," Tony continued, shrugging a little.
"-I know that he would love the space as well. I was also thinking that we're going to have to convert some rooms up in the Penthouse. I'll make the Penthouse two stories, complete with a spiral staircase, because we'll need more bedrooms, and at least another bathroom."
“Are you an Avenger too?” Wade asked, and both boys were looking over at Sam now. He had told them earlier that he was pilot with a special suit, different than Iron Man’s though.
"That's why I've got clip-ons!" Tony said with a grin, tickling Peter. "Come on, kiddo, if you finish getting dressed we can go see Mama before everyone else gets here."
"He's a highly trained assassin!"
Steve hummed a little. “That last one is a little hard to answer. The loss of a life, shouldn’t really be an option, but sometimes it’s unavoidable. And, what it sounds like you’re kind of describing is self-defense.” He was starting to get an idea of what Wade was starting to get at. “There are times where, there really is no other option. If the only way for you to live is for your attacker to, well, not, then it’s a form of self-defense.”
“Remember, hang on tight, Wade,” Steve said quietly by his ear. “No matter what, don’t let go, I’m gonna get us out of here.” There was another nod, and Steve set his legs moving. The shouting behind him he had had expected, and he wasn’t surprised when the first of the bullets went whizzing past him. Steve jumped at the wall, arm going up and grabbing the edge and pulled himself up. He bit back a gasp when a bullet dug into calf as he was pulling them over, and was just able to switch the leg to land on and not stumble.
“Grab me something to wear then, and I’ll make it speedy.” Steve walked backwards for a bit, looking at Bucky, then turned and headed for the showers. Bucky was positive that letting Steve get clean would be much appreciated.
"Good move." Bad move, Tony wanted to shout. No move is bad move! He registered Captain America's movement to his side.
"Now, this is more Tony Stark," Rhodey said nodding. "What are your conditions?"
“See, if you get dressed, then you could see Papa.” She held the little girl out to Steve and he stepped forward to take her in his arms.
"Wade can tell what people are thinking sometimes," Peter told him. He was sounding calmed down a lot from the nightmare now.
"Duh!" Wade rolled his eyes a little. "The ride has to be really amazing if it almost makes you barf!" Steve's eyes flickered to Peter who was nodding in agreement.
“It would seem that my actions over a year ago still resonate,” Loki murmured, stepping away from Steve now. “I was unaware that the connection I inadvertently created at out meeting would continue this long.” Steve thought that he actually sounded a little regretful at his words. “Strange went to help him, and now he works to keep his mind on this plane.” Steve’s eyes widened.
Jamie made a little whine, not content in Mary’s arms, looking back at Steve and Tony. “It’s okay Jamie.” Peter spoke up and Tony moved closer to Steve to grab the sleeve of his jacket, discreetly. Peter had really turned around on Jamie in the past few months, and it still shocked Tony a little bit every time. “I’ll be there too!” Jamie had turned her head to look down at Peter.
Mary moved almost as quickly as Pepper did from the offices to the cars. She was on the phone with someone, maybe Tony, she wasn't sure, she wasn't listening, but all Mary could think about was the information that they had gotten from Pepper. Tony had almost been killed, and he was still in danger. Stane had built some sort of suit, from what Tony had built in the desert, and they had to get to him.
“Papa?” Peter asked, and Steve looked over to see his big eyes. “Something’s wrong.” Steve nodded a little, and he unlocked the doors, climbing in the driver’s.
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” the AI replied helpfully. “Taking into account the plans you have discussed with me, I have made a couple templates that I think would suit your thoughts.” The display by the wall of the shower tub combo lit up and Steve moved towards it. He looked over the different settings that Jarvis was proposing and nodded.
"But not what happened with Steve?" Tony raised an eyebrow at Natasha. "I'm just saying, you don't have to treat this the same. Steve knows about Peter, and Peter knows about him, so there's nothing to hide, or to try and protect."
“Yes, Buckster?” Tony grinned. He felt Steve coming up behind him, an arm almost snaking around his waist from behind, but Tony was pivoting and turning so Steve met only air. Now Bucky was raising his eyebrows at Steve. “Cap here is grounded until he gets all his chores done.”
“Meg and Bucky were experimenting,” Tony finished with a sigh. “Great, trigger words. Wait, did you say someone was trying to hack into Jarvis?”
“I’m detecting an anomaly, Sir,” Jarvis said once most of the warnings had disappeared. The space where the object had disappeared was highlighted in the HUD as numbers and equations started to appear next to it. “I am unable to identify what it means, but it would mostly resemble readings from the method that Mr Odinson uses to travel.”
No sooner had Steve opened the note did the doorbell ring, this one letting him know that he needed to answer it. He pushed himself up and walked over to the door, and saw a delivery man standing there. He gave his signature and then two more men started to bring stuff in. Brave let out a pleased caw as a perch stand created just for him was set up. Arc let his attention wander over as a giant chew toys was given to him; designed to withstand his claws and teeth, and the heat of his breath.
"Right now?" Coulson was a little confused, and he didn't handle that very well yet.
Tony bit his bottom lip a little, looking over her shoulder to Howard, then back to his Aunt Peggy. She was always nice to him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to go into the case, but I was just so curious. You and Dad always talk about Captain America, and I wanted to know more about him. I saw the brown belt, then I saw the empty balls, and then the other three. I’ve never been able to hold a pokeball before, and these ones actually belonged to Him, Aunt Peggy!” He wiggled a little, getting excited as he got lost in his story. “I pulled up the belt, and I saw that two of them were dark, and I wanted to cry for them. They were his friends, and he wasn’t around. They must have been so sad. And Vee’s ball, it wasn’t dark, but it was dim. I just,” Tony let out a little breath, looking down again before Peggy lifted his head back up. “Well, I wanted to help. I didn’t know who was in the ball, but I thought that maybe I could cheer them up a little, try and stop them from disappearing forever.”
"And it's Awesome!" Tony finished up with a grin. "I kind of want to install in my room. Jarvis," Tony took out his phone as they walked for exit outside, happily accepting that it wasn't nearly as windy as it had been the day before. "Make a note, install the Galaxy System in the Penthouse bedrooms."
He scrambled up, turning and throwing himself forward. Unfortunately, one of the mans' weapons caught his leg, throwing him forward into an overturned car. He grunted, then shouted when his head connected with the underside of the car, and he flopped back onto the ground. Tony must have been imagining it, but he sword he heard two shouts when he landed on the ground. Two different names, but both for him. There was no way that Mary or Peter would have down here, not with this happening.
"I asked Jarvis at the door to let us surprise you." Mary smirked a little. "Peter kept asking when we would be coming over here, and if you had someone coming over for Christmas, like Grandma and Grandpa."
“No.” Bucky rolled enough so that he could sit up on the couch now. Wade hopped up to his feet and stood in front of Bucky before he could get up. “You’re kids, I’m not teaching you anything. Steve’ll kill me if I start to teach his kids to fight.”
Tony was getting used to Steve's habits of housekeeping. He of course knew some things from Jarvis, the human one, from when he was younger, but he had grown up with maids, and cooks, and other servants, but Steve hadn't. He was very particular about leftover food as well, but that was from growing up with little money, and war rations. Tony helped him put the rest of the food in containers and into the fridge, dishes in the dishwasher, before he was able to pull Steve over to the couch.
"Daddy! Daddy!" Tony grunted, opening his eyes. Peter grinned at him, pushing his shoulder. "Wake up! We gotta get Mama! It's Kissmas!" Tony grabbed Peter and started to tickle his sides, making the boy squeal with laughter.
Julie was already there, with Mary and Agent, on the communal floor usually only saw action when there were Avengers meetings. This time there were two tables pushed together to make a square, and the table was already set with dinnerware. Tony was directing some Tower staff on where to take the larger pieces they had bought, and was no doubt taking the bags himself. He had sent Steve off with the diaper bag, an outfit for Jamie, and Jamie herself.
"I missed you too!" Peter wrapped his arms around Tony's neck. "I had so much fun, and I can't wait to tell you about it!"
Steve noticed that when Natasha and Clint came down to eat, that Clint purposely distanced himself from Peter, sitting the furthest away. One would think that he was letting familiar faces surround the boy, but Natasha and Steve knew that it was because he felt guilty, thinking that he was part of the reason that Mary was in a coma. Natasha had assured Steve that she would handle that.
"I bet you he doesn't do that to his mom," Tony continued the conversation, then started to brush his teeth.
“Aww, you were trying to protect my boys day out,” Tony said, putting a hand to his chest. He grinned as Bruce just rolled his eyes. “I’m not here to analyze details yet, I just wanna take a look. Steve is probably down trying to get Bucky to hold Jamie again. Or trying to get Peter to actually look at her.” Bruce gave him an appropriate sympathetic look. “My boyfriend is an idealist.”
The assassin reached for Tony with his flesh and blood hand, but both were surprised when a smaller hand grabbed his wrist and twisted up, then yanked down. The assassin went with the motion, flipping, but landed on his feet and spun, Meg still holding onto his wrist, wide eyed. "That wasn't supposed to happen." The man looked at her, everyone tense for a couple of seconds, before he spun her away from Tony, Steve catching her as he had jumped back to his feet.
"I still don't like her," the little boy mumbled and Tony chuckled lightly.
"The, the suit," Tony said, pointing weakly back towards the device.
"Try giving him an order?" Steve shrugged a little. "Have you read through any of the Winter Soldier files that were released?
"When you clock out, stay home." He tapped the desk and head back for the front doors again. "Paid vacation, mandatory! Don't want to see you here until Monday next week!" Tony didn't hear the mans reply, probably to try and refute it, and stepped outside, quickly catching sight of the three women he was looking for.
She took a breath and placed a hand on her injured side, before leaning against the wall. “I was born in Germany, just outside of Nuremburg. Jacob was my father,” she told them. “I didn’t know him, he and my mother died before I was even three, and I was shipped off the US to live with my Aunt.” She looked at them, and they could see that she was as troubled with the information as they were. “I was always told that they had been killed in a burglary gone wrong, and since I had been sleeping so quietly that the burglar didn’t even know I was there. And I never had a reason to look them up.”
"So you need a chaperon for you to be a chaperon?" Rhodey asked with a smirk.
Mary opened her mouth to comment, but her phone started to ring. "Keep me updated on party details," she said as she pulled out her phone, looking at the caller ID. "I have to go into the office apparently. Try not to break anything."
"Until such time as the world ends," Fury stated, looking between the two women, "we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone." He directed the last part at Hill.
“Put your damned weapons down, he’s not going to do anything.”
"Daddy says that family has to take care of family," Peter said firmly. "That must be why he brought you here so fast. He wants you to help Mama, too."
“I’ve learned very quickly,” Steve told him. “I also know that Tony had work to do with Stark Industries while we were gone, and he’s still on this kick to make you babysit. Mary and Coulson are enjoying it because it means they can catch up on work as well.” Steve tapped in a code, and let Jarvis run a scan before the doors opened and Bucky followed Steve towards his ‘area’. “I also know that Peter is his father’s son, and Wade is intense, and you are fresh meat for them.”
See you all on Tuesday!
"Let's be sure to send her a fruit basket, because actually humans like Peter,a nd myself, need to eat food." Rhodey rolled his eyes a little at Tony's snort. "Did Mary give you a list of things that Peter's allergic too, or foods that he doesn't like right now?" After a few moments of silence, Rhodey looked back to see Tony's slightly panicked expression. "You don't remember do you?"
"Keep us updated," Steve told him, grabbing the strap as the back of the jet opened. Tony gave a sloppy salute before jumping out, the jets in his boots taking over. Steve turned back to Natasha, their comms turning on when Tony left the jet. "Do we have any other information on this group that they belong too?"
Tony looked up at it, blinking a little. “You know what, you need someone big next to you, holding onto you.” Steve’s head whipped around to look at him, already knowing where this was going. “You should take Mr Steve! He’s never been on that ride!”
“I’m here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.”
"Save it. Listen up, you're gonna unlock the door, and let them open the door." She squeaked quietly in indignation. "Stick close to the door, and when I tell you, slam the door forward and then get the hell out of there, okay?"
“Yeah, and I will be leaving, in about forty minutes.” He dropped onto a chair and rolled over to the station across from Bruce. “I wanted to check on those test that we set up a couple days ago.
"Seriously, don't worry about it," Steve told her, but looked at Coulson as he spoke, too. "Fireworks are coming soon, and we celebrated most of the day. That's more than I'm used, too. Seriously, this needs to be celebrated. I'll go help with desserts, in fact."
"You saved her," Steve told him, pulling back a bit to look in his eyes. "You could have run, left her there." Tony gave him an offended frown. "Doesn't change the fact that you saved her. You didn't do what they were forcing you to do."
“You said you didn’t want to dress up as Hercules,” Tony pointed out with a smile. “There is an optional sword and shield, but I figured you’d have a baby with you, or you could just wear the red, white, and blue classic on your back.”
“I’ve got Jarvis watching, and searching,” Tony said against his skin. “I think we can continue to work on standard operating procedure for the time being.” Steve made a noise and Tony kissed his neck. “I think you need another vacation.”
"Oh no, that would just be tacky." Tony snorted as Bruce went over to the computers to work with Jarvis.
"Sir, I have tracked down a secure contact," Jarvis said to Tony as the man worked on the new Mark VII armor. He wanted another suit where he wouldn't have to have a robotic station put the armor on, it would take too long in the heat of battle. The repairs to the Mark V suitcase armor had taken longer than he thought, but the Mark IV armor was completely out of date for his own comfort. The Mark VI armor was still operational, Tony liked having more than one backup.
"Steve is next to your room," Tony told him. "Jarvis took readings of the arc reactor, and everything seems to be normal. No more readings of palladium."
"I'm afraid I can't do that ma'am," he said in his nicest voice, which could very possibly make most other villains want to apologize. "I don't think Tony would appreciate bloodshed on the floors."
The next thing he knew was pain. He could hear this screaming, tortured sounds of someone, but he couldn't focus. There were people around him, and everything just hurt! The screaming, that was him. His body shook, it convulsed in pain. It felt like someone was cutting him open. Then, finally, finally, his vision faded to black, the pain drifting away as he lost consciousness again.
"That's not usually what happened in my time," Steve muttered.
"Did you really want to speak up at that part?" Julie asked, looking at Tony.
Wade sat up on the bed then, and scooched a little closer to Tony. He had a serious look and Tony blinked for a second. "I do really appreciate it, Mr Tony. I know you're helping my Mom a lot, too." This kid was too grown up in all the wrong ways. "I don't know how I'll ever be able to make it up to you, but I'm gonna try. I really like Peter, and I'll never let anything happen to him, not while I'm around. Just like you don't let anything happen to me, or my Mom."
"I didn't get a decent night sleep for the first three months," Steve said. Tony frowned a little and looked over at him, turning his body a little. "After I first woke up. I don't think I slept at all for three days, and then when my body was just too tired, that's when I slept without dreams, or memories." Tony watched the blonde slip his hands in his pockets, looking very much less Captain America, and more Steve Rogers. "I know, right now, it's not your ideal action, but if you need me too, I can watch Peter for you."
Steve slowly, smugly, turned his head to look at Bucky. “No, this isn’t my boyfriend, you know that, Izzie.” Bucky would have turned a murderous glare on him, if he weren’t being stared at so intensely. He wanted to be able to come back to get the boys without the police tailing him. “This is my best friend, B-“
“She’s scary,” Wade told him, and Bucky snorted.
"No, it looks like some kind of energy disruptor," Tony comment as they looked at grainy pictures.
There was a picture of him and his wife, the same one that had been in his SHIELD file, sitting in a silver frame. On the other side was a picture of the founding members of SHIELD, and Steve smiled faintly. There was the young Howard Stark that Steve knew, standing next to Peggy Carter. Next to that picture was one of himself. It was after the Howling Commandos had gotten back from a mission, and Steve had been laughing at something that Bucky had said, just out of frame. Steve looked around the desk, looking back to the picture of Howard and Maria, looking for a family picture with Tony in it. But there wasn't one.
"It's not even a good hiding place," Mary murmured.
"Perfect time to take a raincheck on the show," Tony said as he hopped up from the couch. "I'm gonna go whisper dirty words to Captain America now."
Tony fell back, arms covering his face, chest heaving as he tried to get a breath. All he could see was blue, covering him, trying to get inside of him. His shoulder burned, spreading like fire to his head. No, he wouldn't let this happen again!
"Don't think we didn't notice you not answering the question," Mary retaliated. "He was on the phone with Clint this morning, so I know that you figured something out if he's coming back to the Tower. He's bringing his dog by the way, so try not to let Peter see it. He'll want one."
"Yeah, I bet." Steve could picture the red head nodding her head. "That's going to be harder to do, soon. I'm trying my best though."
"Mama! You're back!" Peter cheered. "Did you have fun?"
"Sir!" Jarvis called out, muting the lines, startling Tony for a second. "Mrs Parker is on your line."
"Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?" Tony narrowed his eyes at Fury.
Tony turned, stalking over to the boundaries he made. It wouldn't hurt him if he crossed over, only Loki, but they had all agreed to stay out of arms reach of the madman. "No, you said you could wake her. Which is it?"
Tony hummed a little as he nodded. “That’s right. We don’t know when we’re going to get back, it might be really late. They’ll make sure that you get fed and watered-“
"Sadly, I was still recovering when all that happened," Phil admitted.
"How does he always think of everything?" Tony walked over, grabbing a couple containers from Steve and taking them into the kitchen. "Seriously, just about everything." Steve followed him into the kitchen, grabbing some plates from the cupboards and Tony opened the tops from the containers. "Mmmm, curry," Tony said, taking a smell.
“You’re cruel to me, you know that?” Steve pushed their shoulders together as Tony finished at the piano.
Mary looked over at him and seemed to see what he was thinking. "I know that look, mister. I see it all the time on my mothers face. Tony is a fine father as he is." Now Steve had a name to put with the name, but not a face. Yet. "We all used to live in California, and he came over to New York when I got transferred to make things easier. He loves Peter, and I'm just fine with his level of involvement."
"That's my boy," Tony said, kissing his cheek. He set Peter down, then ruffled Wade's hair, chuckled when the boy tried to wiggle away from the hand. "And did you eat all your breakfast, Wade?"
"Are you here to see Mama, too?" Peter asked, and Tony's shoulders tensed a little. Peter had fallen asleep before they had gotten back, and he wasn't sure how the little boy would take it seeing Mary.
“You made it happen,” Tony breathed as he lifted his leg to hook around Steve’s knee. “Just that one time so far.” He swallowed and closed his eyes as his fingers moved against Steve’s skin. “But, I think we’re gearing up for a repeat.” Tony spread his hands out, feeling the warmth of his skin, feeling his skin start to bead with sweat.
"I know, Mama," Peter rolled his eyes a little, but leaned up to kiss his Mama goodbye. "Go save the world!" Mary chuckled every time he said, and hugged him before slipping her jacket on.
"Wade is going to lose it," Steve said with a chuckle.
I have plans, I swear. This chapter feels awkward to me, but don't worry, everything will work out! Slight trigger warning for a flashback/anxiety.
Tony pulled out his phone. “J, I want recordings of that drop, and we are definitely buying that picture from the gift shop.”
Tony jumped over the back of the couch, sitting on the opposite end to face Meg. "I have theories about that show, and I need to talk about them with someone other than Steve."
"Nope," Steve shook his head, putting out a hand towards him. "Not allowed."
Tony just shrugged again at the statement, finishing his last cup of coffee. "I propose that we move this lazy affair into a more comfortable location. Specifically one where I can recline comfortably if I'm going to have this lump sitting on my chest." There was a fond smile on Tony's face as he brought up the suggestion. Steve got up to carefully take Peter from Tony so the older man could get up, and everyone moved as a group to the living room.
"Oh, you are going to be a troublemaker!" Tony smiled, turning back towards his plate of pancakes. "Alright, my little monster, help me demolish this plate of pancakes."
“It’s technically smart glass,” Tony mumbled under his breath, opening the door to get out, then reaching in to take Jamie from Pepper, then offering a hand to help her out as well. “It can black out, and no one will be able to see inside.” Peter clambered out next, then Steve pulled himself out, still looking up to take it all in. “I think it’s technically bigger than the Manor back in New York.”
“Hey, Petey-pie,” he called out, looking at the little boy standing in the doorway. “Did you have a bad dream?” Peter nodded and Tony shifted a little and put out an arm. Peter ran over to the bed, letting Tony wrap an arm around his waist to help him up. He crawled over Tony to settle in between him and Steve, snuggling down into the blankets, stuffed animals securely tucked into his arms.
“Of course,” she nodded. “I’ll tell you everything, but I’m just not sure where she is at all. Not too long Emil died, but before I knew I was pregnant, she went to Europe. Wanted to travel like she did in college, I don’t know.” Tony glanced at Steve. “She’d send the occasional post card, a phone call when she was able, too.”
"We gotta let them cool down first," Steve said, smiling at Peter. "Or else the frosting will just slide right off, it'll start to melt." Peter nodded, watching the cupcakes, smiling.
"But we caused a lot of the damage," Steve argued weakly.
“My name is Steve, it’s a pleasure to meet you Sylveon.”
“If it happens,” Tony said with a nod. “I never liked glasses, and I’ll still have contacts for public events, and going out as Iron Man if I can help it, but if it’ll help stop drama, then I’m all for it.”
Tony walked into Bruce’s lap, seeing the man himself casually looking at some information, a cup of tea next to his hand. “Hey, Brucie-bear,” Tony called out.
"I'm sorry about the mess," Mary called out as she walked into a room off of the living room. He edged forward to peek in, noticing that it was set up as a study. There were a couple of bookcases, some metal file cabinets, and a large desk with a leather chair on wheels. There was what looked like a TV screen on the desk as well with a smaller typing keyboard in front of it.
"Kids are fascinated with the miracle of life." She waved a hand around her stomach. "I told them if they got their homework done first, they could feel the babies kick, and play any kind of music they wanted for them."
"Tony-"
Mary made a motion to the other oversized chair in the living room. “Can I get you something to drink? Water, some tea?” Tony blinked a little, (Tea??), but shook his head and she sat down on the loveseat, by Peter.
Steve had been on alert for the past hour, pacing in front of the windows. Nothing else had come to attack the Tower, but there was still no sign of Tony. Bruce had a tablet and was running through the scans that Jarvis had taken from inside the suit, and before he lost contact. When Tony had started falling, Steve had taken off down the stairs, running, and some jumping, down all eighty-three flights. There had been startled walkers, and gawkers, who had been recording what had been happening in the air when they saw Iron Man outside. Pieces of the suit were still on the ground, but as soon as Steve got near them Jarvis was able to recall them all to the Tower. Well, all but two. Tony was nowhere to be seen.
"What's it going to do?" Mary asked, taking the notebook from Peter, handing him another one as he switched homework subjects.
-"an impressive cage." Loki's too smug sounding voice. "Not built, I think, for me."
Bruce walked in the room and Peter was pointing to Clint's chair. "Uncle Clint sits there, and Uncle Bruce sits there." Bruce blinked and took his seat, not actually sure what was going on. He looked to Tony who only shrugged.
"As well as they can, yeah," Tony said, looking back at the man. "What about you?"
"Long sleeve, I'm in New York in winter, it's cold." He glanced at a black button down, but didn't pick it up.
"Well, he's not exactly my boyfriend," Steve muttered under his breath a little, feeling his cheeks blush a bit.
"You always do that," Steve countered. "I kind of expect you to do that, it's part of who you are. You also just asked me to move in with you, with Jamie."
"Hi, Peter," Steve said, stepping aside for him to walk in. "How are you today?" Steve looked over and waved to Mary, who was standing in her own doorway, watching her son go over. She smiled and waved back, mouthing 'Thank you' to him as Peter walked in. She looked dressed for work, and looking a little frazzled. It was supposed to be her day off from any office work, but she must have been called in.
"Where is she?" Tony whispered, not looking away from the files. What had been so important down there?
Turns out, the Hulk had done what Steve and Tony, and the others, had wanted to do. They found him crawling out of a little crater in the floor, before turning around to face them. Tony caught Loki's eye for a second. Thor grabbed Loki, Romanoff and Barton following, an arrow pointed at him at all times, as they went to secure him while waiting for a SHIELD team to come from the New York building. Tony was already working on the manual releases of the suit, choosing not to say anything when Steve stepped up to help pull the bigger pieces off. Tony was moving as he tried to pull the boots off, heading for the elevator.
"Bruce-"
"Since we've realized that your music horizons are shot to shit?" Steve pursed his lips a little, but he still wasn't handing over the food yet, and Tony's stomach was starting to make its wants known.
"I asked Clint and Natasha the same thing," Steve murmured. "Never did get an answer, but I think this man is working alone. This AIM, or whoever they are, they aren't interested in following us, or trying to kill us. At least not exclusively. I think we're experiencing the bad luck of fighting two different enemies at the same time."
"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome." Tony was starting to really get under Steve's skin now.
"Matching haircuts?" Peter asked hopefully.
“What’s that?” Mary leaned up a little to try and look at the papers in the file he was holding. Steve felt like he should leave the room, lest Phil rope him into paperwork himself.
"I am apt to agree, Captain."
"Huh?" Steve glanced at his phone. "Oh! No, not yet, but he's not happy. I think that might actually be an understatement." Tony snorted and Steve smirked a little. "No, Natasha sent me a message."
Unbeta'd as usual, Marvel owns more than me, and Disney owns them and the movie Tangled.
It didn't take Peter long to warm up to Bruce, both of their shy natures recognizing each other, and then being combined with Tony's outgoing nature. They were working on dinner together in no time, the six-year-old asking Bruce all the questions in the world. Tony grinned, watching them, letting Bruce make something that he picked up from his world travels, the world travels that had encompassed Peter's attention.
"I have a truck," Tony said. Steve had a point about the transporting part, he hadn't thought that part through. "If we can get a stretcher, I'm sure we can make it work." Steve nodded and put a hand on Tony's back as they headed up for the stairs. They were going to get the man back. Tony would put a second bed in Mary's room if he had, too, if it meant that they would heal better, being together. But Coulson was a tying factor to all of the Avengers, to everyone that was in Tony's house.
"He was a good man," Steve said softly, leaning against the railing.
"No one except for the one who created it," Steve muttered as he paused the song. Tony had sent him a text when he updated the Map app with a suggested course across the country, so he knew that Tony could access his phone from New York. "Really, Tony?"
"He held her in front of him like she might actually be actively killing him."
"I have armor."
"I don't know, that face, and your whining, tells me differently." He propped the tablet up on the dresser as he pulled his shirt off. He did it just to see the little leer on Steve's face. "I have to say that I'm pretty proud of how quickly you've grasped onto the finer points of video chat."
“Tony-“
"Well, I didn't actually know what time it was," Tony admitted. "But, I had to make sure that I was still right before I started to dive back into a project, because you know how my brain works sometimes-"
"How long's he been asleep?" William asked as Tony stood up, and they headed towards the door out.
Tony grit his jaw tightly, his knuckles turning white as his grip tightened. Mary had been in that car when the base had literally fallen to pieces. She had a bullet wound to her right calf, with a tibular and fibular break as well, a broken nose form the airbag, four cracked ribs, a dislocated shoulder, and coxal bone fracture on her left hip. Tony's brain worked with what he was given, formulas appearing to explain all the breaks. She had been much too fast, probably trying to get out, and the rocks brought her to a dead stop, propelling her with too much force to her body.
“I’d be interested to know how you managed to take down Jarvis,” Steve said as he put the phone on speaker after the security guard left the room. He attempted to pull up the tracking program that Tony had shown him. This would only work if Tony had managed to get Jarvis fully operational. “But, what I really want to know is where Wade is.”
"The chimichangas are safe." Steve turned when heard Tony step into the kitchen. "The actual dinner part, that's safe and not burned.
"You could call him." Tony looked up and over at Bruce, expression not amused by the suggestion. "It's a valid suggestion."
“She likes it!” Peter insisted, grinning like his Dad. Steve knew he was doomed. Again. Jamie was indeed patting the ears on her head, looking delighted about it.
"I think that's a really great idea, Tony. Goodnight."
Tony tapped Steve’s knee as he silently got up. “Todd will be nearby if you need anything,” he told the two of them. “And Jarvis of course. We’ll be just upstairs.” Julie nodded a little, he head resting on top of Wade’s head. He motioned to Steve with a gentl nod of his head, motioning that they leave the apartment.
"Nope, my Peter." Tony shook his head. They all walked into the dining room and suddenly Peter was plucked from both of their grips.
"I haven't seen this model yet," she said. "I didn't think that Stark had released a new one yet. Oh! I love this song!" Steve smiled, this young woman reminding him of Mary.
Trigger warning: Flashbacks, nightmares, panic attack, talk of drowning, and some PTSD. I don't think it's too horrible, I try not to be too graphic with some stuff, cause I might accidentally trigger myself, but I'm putting it out there. I will summarize things up for people if some stuff gets too heavy, just let me know. The warning is still there.
"When we spoke, you said you had people." Bruce held up the picture a little. "You mean, your son, you wanted help, so you can be around for your son."
"There's a medical team en route-"
"What the hell is he doing?" Tony exclaimed. They had broken up, they had spoken to each other in over a year, he had wanted to be with Tony for money, fame, and sex, and Tony was not looking for that for the first time in his life. Well, the sex part at least.
“Just a song, don’t worry about it,” he waved it off a bit. “How are you feeling? Wanna get up and maybe make some early breakfast? Wanna stay in bed for a bit? Nice long warm shower?” Steve narrowed his eyes a bit and tilted his head. “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Thinking about things that we probably wouldn’t like,” Steve continued, watching Tony’s fingers. “He asked about what’s going to happen after Julie dies.” Tony almost faltered in his playing, the song losing the tempo for a second.
The thing about sunglasses in the 21st century, Steve had come to find out while on an information gathering mission with Mary, is that there are either too many of the same pair, or custom ones for various celebrities, those of importance. This statement could be true for just about anything, but this particular mission, (to get Steve's feet wet with SHIELD), it was easier for them to track the targets purchases, and that included what Steve thought was too many sunglasses. He had seen hundreds of them that day, and now Steve recognized the logo on the side of the sunglasses that Stark was wearing in the picture.
Hello beautiful people! So this chapter, I tried something a little different narrative wise in one part, the family dinner, and I think it works. It's cute.
“What Princess doesn’t dream of having two Princes beside her?” The woman said sweetly, clapping her hands together. Jamie smiled, clapping her hands together in the same fashion, making the Princess and Steve practically melt.
Unbeta'd as usual, Marvel owns more than me, and talented artists own the songs in this chapter.
Wade and Peter both scooted down to the floor as well, knowing they would be able to eat better if they didn’t have to hold onto their plates. Steve had set aside one plate with one smaller pancake on it, and set it off to the side. He put the pancakes on a plate, and tony knew it was his as he watched him putting syrup on it. The exact amount that Tony liked. Steve leaned in to give him a quick kiss, then took Jamie from his arms. She wiggled happily when she saw the pancake that was just for her, and grabbed for it.
Steve stepped out of the bathroom, adjusting his blue tie, the boys smoothing out his jacket and pants. Tony blinked and swallowed. Steve's hair was swept back and when he looked up, Tony swore that his blue eyes were a little brighter, and his smile was a little wider.
Steve still hadn't met the mysterious Tony, but he thought he caught glimpses of him leaving Mary's apartment at night, after dropping Peter off. The man was usually wearing a hat and some sunglasses, always casually dressed. It was easy to tell the difference between him and Mary's boyfriend, Phil. They worked together, and Steve was only a little concerned about inter-office romances. Phil told him that he was the one who had made Mary Steve's Handler, (after asking him to sign his prized collection of Captain America trading cards). He said that it didn't put them in contact all the time, and so it would be harder for work to get between their personal relationship. Steve wouldn't say anything, because he could clearly see that it was working, and the two were able to keep work and life separate.
Tony picked up the backpack and headed back out and saw Rogers waiting for him outside. "Traitor, AI," he muttered under his breath. "What can I do for you, Cap? J said you wanted to talk to me?"
"Unless something happened in the past hour-" Steve started, and when Jarvis interrupted him Tony threw Steve an honest glare this time.
If you've seen the movie, and need to have nerd conversations about what happened, I'm all up for that as well! I love discussing that stuff! I have many thoughts and feels, and it gets nerdy.
“So, five pairs?” Steve finally spoke up, finishing the sandwich. Tony narrowed his eyes at him.
“-missed the coffee table!” Wade proclaimed happily. “I rolled under it!”
"Phil," Peter whined. "What's going on?" Steve skirted around them, heading quickly for his bedroom, and heard Peter's gasp. "Daddy!" Steve wouldn't let Peter lose Tony, no matter what Steve thought about the man.
"Yeah! They got me a book to draw in!" He unzipped his bag and pulled out a sketchbook. "It's all blank paper, and they say it's just like adult artists use!"
“And my job isn’t the least bit dangerous?” Mary asked with a raised eyebrow. “Loki didn’t find out about Peter because of you Tony, he knew about him before he even made it topside, the day he came to Earth. Our jobs each have their own set of dangers, our own enemies, and we try to protect him from that. Was this something that we planned for in our future? To have a child that would be in danger?”
"Is Mr Steve gonna move here, too?" Peter asked. Steve opened his other eye, and Tony glanced over at him. They locked eyes for just a second.
Tony wiggled his body slightly and closed his eyes, but he started to hum at first before singing softly. “So, here we are. That’s pretty far, when you think of where we’ve been.” Steve rubbed Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “No going back, I’m fading out all that has faded me within. You’re by my side,” Tony opened his eyes to give him a smile, “now everything’s fine. I can’t believe-“
"I needed to stretch my legs." She handed another mug to Mary and took a sip from her own. Tony wrinkled his nose at her when he noted that it was tea and not coffee.
Tony laid in the bed the night that his parents had died in a car accident. Vee trilled softly, moving up to try and snuggle with him. He stared straight at the wall, not pushing her back, but also not bringing her up to his chest like he used too. After that night she spent more time in her pokeball, or left at the apartment while Tony went to work. Soon, they moved to Malibu, after the new house was built. Vee at least had company in the robots Dum-E and U, and eventually Butterfingers, but she knew that Stane was to blame for Tony becoming distant.
"I'm afraid that I can't comply with that, Sir." Tony turned a glare towards the ceiling, the direction where he knew the cameras were. "I am to protect Young Master Peter, and the death of a parent would violate that."
"No we don't," he said, tensing his jaw. It wasn't Bruce's fault his father was such a dick, no need to take it out on him. "You and Steve know, and that's all that needs to know. The history changes nothing." He could feel Bruce staring at him, before he finally nodded and walked over to Tony. "Use my blood samples as test subjects," he said more calmly. "We already know that Howard had figured out that my DNA would be stable enough. Next best thing next to the Captain himself."
"On whether or not that Captain America continues," Mary said, confirming his thoughts. "Oh!" She started walking back into the bedroom, remembering something important. Steve followed and watched her walk over to a wooden armoire, opening the two doors. He saw the shield sitting there, on display, the same as the day he went down with the plane. Mary had moved and Steve walked forward, dropping the bags that he had forgotten he was still holding, and reached out, running his fingers along the edge.
Julie was rubbing her face with one hand. "I knew he didn't take the divorce well. He was overseas when he got the papers. But he sent them back, signed. I knew he'd be upset, but he never tried to contact me."
"Well, seems like Grandma and Grandpa had a Christmas party in the morning, so they were going to be gone all day tomorrow," Mary said, taking off her jacket.
"Just parts of the reception," Tony answered. "It's no secret that Starks know how to throw a party."
"Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?" Steve was not expecting the almost violent reaction from Tony at his words. Tony whipped around, his voice quivering with anger.
"I believe we've been over those," he said with a bop to Peter's nose. "You can't stay here alone. They don't need Iron Man for this one, so we get to chill in the-"
"Yup!" He smiled. "He said I had to ask you first." Steve couldn't get a clear image of this man in his mind. He wasn't around that often, but he never went over Mary's head as a parent.
“Rogers must have been the cutest baby ever,” he heard Sam murmur to someone from behind him. “If he was anything like her.”
"Cheater!" Tony pointed at Meg, whose eyes widened. "You've been feeding them Andes mints!"
Tony barely had time to turn, the repulsors already working to correct his position, but not enough to stop himself from getting slammed into. He was crushed briefly against the glass before his HUD went dark, parts of the suit falling off, and he was falling down. Tony gasped, feeling like electricity was shooting through his body, lighting up all his nerves, red hazing his vision slightly. He was sure he saw a shadow above him, something extending, but then there was a ripple in the air and something else shuddered through his body.
"I know that the boys haven't seen it yet," she assured him. "Coffee?"
"Okay, but he still hurt me a little, and I think it's time to make that stop hurting." Steve and Peter helped Tony to his feet, Peter sticking to the uninjured side. The lights flickered back on, this time Jarvis booting back up.
"We're just dancing," Tony countered.
As Peter finished his breakfast, he turned and let out a little gasp. Tony set the boy down on the ground as he shouted his excitement. "Granpa! Granma!" Peter ran over and William caught him, picking him up, making an exaggerated 'oomph.'
“Like I said, drive you nuts. In a good way.” He turned with her in his arms, before setting her down on her feet, holding onto her hands. She hadn’t learned to walk on her own yet, but if someone were holding onto her hands to keep her steady, she could get a decent pace going on the floor. Steve helped guide her towards the bedrooms, hunched over so he didn’t stretch her arms up. As they got closer they saw a pillow go flying past an open door, and Steve nodded.
"Did you have him tested yet? He'll be five in October, and I think he should at least be in Kindergarten, if not First grade." Tony worked with Peter all the time on stuff like his numbers, and the alphabet. He was already learning how to write, and knew how to read. They were working on three syllable words at the moment. Peter had Tony's natural learning ability.
"I know that this isn't the greatest situation," words starting to tumble out of his mouth. "I had hoped to be back by now, and I'm not, and it just, it sucks. I know I left and you were still mad at me, and I'm really sorry. This doesn't make up for that, or for whatever I've been putting you through by being gone, and I don't blame you for avoiding private calls with me most of the time. Tony, I miss you so much, and the best part of my day, are the days that I get to see you and Peter on my computer screen." Steve reached out, cupping Tony's cheeks with both hands. "I have been thinking for weeks on how to try and make this up to you, and every idea I've had has fallen flat, but I knew that I didn't want to miss today. I didn't want you to be alone one more year on Valentine's Day."
“Yeah, don’t expect that to happen every year.” Tony snorted softly and hopped into the drivers seat. “I don’t want you to get spoiled by having private birthday parties with just me.”
"You're in rare form today," Steve said as he set a plate down in front of Tony. "I'd almost say that this possibly isn't your first cup of coffee."
“What is it with you white boys?” Tony cackled and Steve’s eyes widened a little. “I think I can excuse this though. The Army man is admitting that the Air Force is better, that’s okay, that’s why he brought in another brother.” Steve blinked. Tony was running out of air while he laughed. “Hey, Captain, it’s okay, I understand, and I humbly accept this honor on behalf of the Air-“
"Ouch, right in the gut, Rhodey." Tony feigned stumbling out of the pantry, taking a direct hit from the older mans words. "I'm pretty sure I can get this right."
"Sorry, I forgot, I'm here to request the pleasure of visiting with Mrs Wilson." Tony had not forgotten, he had expressly told them to turn away anyone who didn't say that phrase, or something very close to it. The receptionist smiled and nodded, pulling out two visitor passes.
“That’s why I started working on a space ready suit,” he said with a nod. “I have an underwater suit, better than just the basic capabilities the other suits had. All of the suits that I’ve made, and have been working on, will be able to move independently as well, not just fall around the user. The next suit I’m looking into will have each part moving on it’s own, able to come at my command. I’m still working on the name, but I feel like it has to be obnoxious. Something like autonomous and propulsion, maybe something else in there.”
"Sometimes my mom had bad nights, when she can't sleep," Wade continued. "And I can't sleep, and then I'll sit with her. She can't work sometimes, but I know that she's gone to find Jackson because he helps her with the cancer."
A sharp slap to his cheek brought Tony's head back up, and he saw Steve in front of him. His face was twisted in a frown, but he was, concerned? "Stark? Can you hear me?" Tony blinked, then nodded once. "You gotta get the suit off." Tony looked down, seeing the heavily damaged suit. It was almost completely offline. "Loki will be going to wherever the tesseract is, and only you can bring back Banner's results."
The car pulled into the garage, and Peter was bolting out the door almost before the engine was shut off. “Peter!” The younger boy nearly slammed into Wade and the two were instantly talking and hugging.
“It was Sarah,” Peter said to Tony. “Wade’s old babysitter, but he never liked her.” Tony looked at Steve, whose expression said that it was not good. “She came and signed him out after lunch, and he didn’t come back.”
"Come on in, Tony." Mary opened the door, leaving it open for him. He could smell some food in the oven. Closing the door he dropped the glasses and hat on the table, and saw Peter jump up from his seat at the table.
“Thanks, Jarvis.” Steve was able to take a breath, and started to pat down his shirt and pants from wrinkles. He hadn’t actually thought about it, but he probably looked a bit of a mess. As he was running his hands through his hair the doors opened to the floor that Mary was on. Steve stepped out, then stopped. He didn’t actually know where Mary would be. Steve hadn’t actually helped Tony on this floor, had mostly just helped with the rebuild of the broken windows and doors on the penthouse floor, where Peter would be sleeping.
“When did you start taking self-defense classes?” Tony asked next. He had an idea, and wanted to see if it checked out.
Tony started to wash all the dishes, something he could easily do without needing to take off his sunglasses. Maybe he would make a custom pair of sunglasses that he could wear that acted like the Iron Man HUD. He would be able to watch Steve without actually looking at him, he wouldn't have to try and do stuff looking through darker lenses just because Steve had decided to intrude.
“Buh-ee!” She proclaimed and Steve looked at Bucky.
"Alright sap, listen," Tony chuckled, poking Steve's chest. "We're going to back into your bedroom-"
"Thank fuck," Tony breathed. He turned to his side and started to pull himself back underneath the energy disruptor. Steve was there, beside him, helping him move.
"Love you too, Daddy," the little boy murmured sleepily, snuggling in further to Tony's chest, warm and content. Tony would give away everything he had, if it meant that he would be able to stay with Peter, to keep his little boy.
"This is real nice, kiddo," Tony said as he looked at it. Peter put it down on the coffee table. "What's this boys name?"
"Exactly," Mary said, looking at him. "Tony can't go out and pick up Peter last minute, and Tony is wonderful with electronics, and science in general. "We've decided that a lot of it is stuff that we don't want Peter experimenting with until he's at least eight or nine. I'd prefer thirteen, but Peter is extraordinarily smart." Mary grabbed a water bottle, throwing one to Steve, and grabbing one for herself. "Tony's company keeps him busy, a lot of the time. So, when Peter suddenly starts talking about the new neighbor,..." She trailed off, letting Steve finish the thought.
"Agent," Tony said after Peter ran over to his surprise. "I wasn't aware that you owned anything that was a black suit and a white shirt." Coulson was dressed in khaki's and a dark blue sweater, wearing glasses that Tony had never seen before.
"Don't worry about it, Tony," the older man chuckled. "Just enjoy the rest of today." Tony nodded and smiled at them. He couldn't wait for Peter to find out.
Siblings: Etta Rosenfeld (nee Mueller)
“You’re dramatic,” Wade mumbled.
“I’m sure that Jarvis will pull up some videos,” Steve said, cuddling Jamie to his chest.
Steve didn’t drop his shield until he entered the sitting room where Tony and Strange were. Strange was on his feet, hands out on either side of Tony’s head. Tony, who was unconscious, and floating in the air above the floor. Steve moved towards him, but was stopped by Loki’s hand on his arm. “I wouldn’t disturb the Doctor.”
"I'm fine," Tony bit out. He needed to get readings from Jarvis on Mary, then needed to see if he could bug Fury again about Coulson, all the while keeping an eye on Peter. No doubt they would have to start coordinating about cleanup of the city as well. The Tower needed to be worked on again thanks to-
“I did what you asked, Mr Stark,” she said sweetly. “I had the mansion freshened up, and the refrigerator stocked for a couple of days.”
"Yeah! Let's do that!" Peter was hopping a little, and Tony grunted silently as the air was pushed form his lungs. "He really likes chim-chimi-chimicha-"
“I’d rather not think about our son actually scorning people.”
"They have a very distinct smell. And I love them." Tony looked smug as he crossed his arms over his chest. "Is that seriously all it takes?"
Peter came back out, holding onto a little paper box. It looked like origami. Peter carefully opened it and inside was a piece of paper with Peter's name printed on it in impeccable handwriting. Tony blinked. A bit elaborate for someone in second grade, but he could see why Peter wanted to do something for this kid.
Bruce's name was already on his lips before Steve spoke. "Dr Banner... put down the scepter." It was the scepter, it had to have been. Bruce looked at it, shocked that it had made it to his hand.
Pepper was suddenly pressing a finger to her ear. "Tony! Tony, are you okay?" She was talking to Tony, he was still alive then. Mary was rubbing Peter's back as they talked. "Obidiah, he's gone insane! He built a suit, and-"
"You're the best, J," Tony said from his spot. "I think I'm gonna stay in my bed for a bit. Just as soon as I get up."
"Probably good thinking, but that's going to make being an effective Dad a little hard."
“It’s not in the books,” Tony answered. He pat the spot on the couch next to him, and Peter seemed to hesitate for a second, before he slid up on the couch next to Tony. “You have a question about Mr Steve?”
"Come on, you're gonna go see your family, see my family. Get up." Tony was ready to do a fireman's carry if he had too.
"Peter, why don't you go put your bag in your room?" Mary told him. "Daddy's gonna stay for dinner, but you still have to get washed up."
"Yes!" Peter exclaimed, kicking his legs a little.
"So, when Tony was making the arrangements for your parents to come last week..." Steve asked without asking.
"Captain Rogers, while I would usually agree with you, right now I must insist that Sir retreat to his workshop." Steve frowned. "I have been unable to properly record his vitals, and run tests on his new arc reactor, and must make sure that his is not suffering from any adverse side effects from the new element."
"I want a red one!" Wade exclaimed. "Then Pete and me, we're gonna be Jedi, only he'll be on the Light side, and I'll be on the Dark side."
"Peter's going to be ecstatic, you know that!" Steve called as he got up from the bed.
The next day Tony had been unable to help with decorating for Peter’s birthday. As soon as the little boy had seen that Tony was awake, he had plastered himself to his Daddy’s side. He and Wade made sure that Tony felt better, and that he wouldn’t get sick again. It took Tony having to trap them on the couch in the morning with a blanket and a movie, while Steve cooked them birthday pancakes. Mary, Coulson, Bruce, and Bucky were on decorating duty, and Steve would join them. Rachel and William were making the cake and the rest of the food, along with the kitchen staff downstairs.
“The impact is minimal,” Jarvis assured him, bringing up readings. The glass was barely taking a scratch. “The new coating seems to be working according to specifications, Sir.”
Peter tried to hide a yawn, but Tony felt it, his hand rubbing the young boys back. The doctor finished wrapping his wrist, giving him some order that he was probably going to ignore, and put his arm in a sling. That would probably be taken off in a matter of hours.
"Tony, your jealousy is showing." Mary was enjoying this.
I hurt you guys last chapter, I did, it was rough, but I'll make up for it in this chapter! Promise! You guys wanted some domesticity, well you got it! (See, you guys really can influence the story. I literally had shaped this chapter off of your requests.)
"It was one of Mary's rules," Tony told him. "I mean, back then, it was an annoying rule, but now I'm glad that I at least listened to it. Made me less like,...."
