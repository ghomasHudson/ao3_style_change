He watched John raising his head defiantly, his eyes hard and proud. Again, Sherlock felt a flutter in his chest but he was fast to crush the feeling in this improper situation. John got up from his chair with slow, sure motions. One of the thugs was taking a hold of his right arm, his fingers pressing so hard into the muscle that Sherlock was able to see the pain crossing John’s face before it was set in an impassive expression. The men lead him out of the Inn, pushing their way through the guests with a cloud of confidence and determination surrounding them. John didn’t fight them. He didn’t call for help or try to run away. He just walked out without a look back. Without a look at Sherlock.
As always he didn’t have any money with him but it wouldn’t be that hard to cry a few coins for their dinner. The moment he imagined the disappointment of having met the wrong John, he felt his eyes sting and a strong weight pressing down on his chest. Soon, tears were running down his cheeks. As always he held his hands below his face to catch the silver coins and… felt the wetness on his skin, the drops falling on his palms but there was no clinging, no weight, no metallic warmth marking the positions of coins in his hands. Disbelieving, Sherlock stared into his empty hands. Seconds ticked by in which Sherlock tried to comprehend what was happening. When he ultimately failed he decided to go back to John to ask him if he’d like to get to know him over a dinner he’d have to pay.
John felt rather than saw Sherlock noticing the moment he was fully seated insight him. Tension was leaving him momentarily and a shudder ran down his thighs. Bending forward for a kiss, John pushed Sherlock’s legs up against his chest at the same time. Softly, he captured the full lips between his own before pressing a peck on a flushed cheek bone.
Apparently, Mycroft had sent them a car for the occasion so John was pretty confident that the older Holmes had also been the one arranging the funeral.
“Don’t worry. Occasionally, I don’t wank when I am in bed.” John said when he noticed the slight blush that was rising on Sherlock’s cheekbones.
He kissed the soft skin at Sherlock’s collarbone before he took a step backwards to regard his naked body. John still couldn’t believe that Sherlock wanted to spend his life with him in this special, intimate way. According to the book, they would develop a connection that would grow stronger with every day they spend together. John could already feel their bond tugging at him whenever there was even a small distance between them. It should have felt awkward but to John it was all he had ever wished for, even before he knew that his body was meant for it.
Sherlock let is cock slip out, leaning back against the tentacle with a groan. John fought the urge to take himself in hand, taking deep breaths with closed eyes. His hand lay unmoving on his hip as he tried to calm his libido down to a point where he could touch and be touched without coming on the spot. The sight that greeted him upon opening his eyes didn’t help at all. Sherlock knelt between his legs languorously rocking between the tentacle inside him and the fist he’d formed around his leaking arousal. His head was thrown back and, with his eyes closed and his mouth forming a sigh, John had the impression that he had completely forgotten about him. The doctor kept staring at the strangely erotic sight Sherlock offered in his self-indulgence. Sweat began to form on the man’s chest and forehead. His curls were sticking to the skin of his temples and neck, and there was a deep blush spreading from his cheekbones all down to his flat stomach.
With a start, the agitated woman got up from the chair and turned towards him. “You are monsters, just like me! Is it true what he said? Did you do that to me?”
“I think we were bonded from the moment we met.” John answered equally quiet. “I knew I wouldn’t leave you even when you turned me down at Angelo’s.”
“Hello, John.” The deep voice was oddly fitting in between the sounds of the storm. John turned around to see Sherlock, standing right behind him in the rain. A small smirk was tugging at the corners of the consulting detectives lips. John’s own smile widened in answer. Unbelievably, he was even happier now than mere seconds before.
John immediately knew that it was a Shakespeare quote. Well, the language made it obvious. He jumped up from the couch to search through his books for the source when another thought struck him.
Suddenly, Sherlock met his upwards thrust with his full weight, forcing the knot into the slick opening. The Omega groaned in relief, his climax hitting him powerfully. He came hard between their bellies and over John’s chest.
Crawling back on the bed and keeping his eyes intensely focused on Sherlock’s, John feels self consciousness expand below his skin. In this moment, he is a virgin all over again. Suddenly, it’s hard to breath and his throat is constricting painfully.
Sherlock fidgeted uncertainly in the doorway of the bookshop. Maybe he went too far, but he knew what to expect of John. He
They remain slumped over each other until their breaths even out and Sherlock eventually rolls off of John. Lying side by side, they remain silent for a while longer, enjoying the afterglow and getting used to their new reality. In the end, it is John who talks first.
When he saw the chains that were dangling from the wall, he felt regret creep through his limbs. He should have tried!
“John, you should clearly know by now that I don’t burden myself with emotions or attachments. I obviously failed to do so regarding my newly developed feelings towards my straight colleague and flat mate. The last few weeks have made it clear that it already affects our cohabitation and I don’t wish it to do the same with our working relationship. If you would excuse me now, I am almost done packing and wish to finish as soon as possible.” Stoically, he turned around and peeked into the box as if to make sure that none of it's content had magically vanished during his short occupation with something else.
In a hurry, John turned. His prominent erection suddenly on display as it pushed hard against the soft fabric of his pants.
John yells at her with all his might. Again. He should have known. Friendship can never be enough. And again he has to tell her all the reasons he has to run after Sherlock every time Sherlock asks him to. He talks about cases and victims. The things he is able to change for the better but she still doesn’t understand. She knows now. They all realize at some point. He needs it. The excitement, the adventure. The danger. And Sherlock. The best life he’s ever known. It all comes down to Sherlock, and though he tells her otherwise, he knows there will never be anything more important to him.
Sherlock felt the tentacles press down on his shoulders as John began to thrust. He hadn’t considered John’s width, not in comparison to the pointed tip he’d enveloped shortly before. He felt the ridge of John’s cock rubbing against his inner walls with every movement of his hips. In his own considerate way, John kissed Sherlock’s knuckles while he build a cautious rhythm. He sighed when he felt the tightness loosen bit by bit around him, a clear sign for him that his partner started to relax into his ministrations. He relished the slow drag on his sensitive skin and the small waves Sherlock’s hips began to make in answer to his own motions.
Four tentacles wound themselves around their hips, pressing them harder against each other while still allowing their hips to move.
Taking his hand, John led him out into the living room and to the couch, pushing him down into a lying position.
He sneaked out into the hallway and crept down to the staff quarters. In two minutes the guard would be back from his (definitely forbidden) break. At least he was reliable in his bad habits.
“I’m going to meet the tattoo artist tomorrow morning.” Sherlock announced, entering the parlor in a flourish of motion and causing John to sit up tensely.“ She has agreed to see me 2 days earlier.” The unspoken promise of a less strained situation only 15 hours into the future made the muscles in John’s back relax and his hands unclench.
.  Whenever she had felt unhappy or frustrated or really, really, really happy so that she couldn’t hold back the tears, her wealth had grown. Knowing that there were places in the world where she would probably need money unlike at her father’s home, she began to store every single coin away.
“I…I am ready. Bedroom, now!” He takes Sherlock’s hand, dragging him to the bedroom that is closest. Which means Sherlock’s, of course. John falls back on the bed, pulling Sherlock down on top of him.
“I think I forgot to tell you that I didn't hire a therapist. There was no one qualified enough.” Sherlock said offhandedly.
“Yes, Sherlock, please. Now!” John suddenly feels Sherlock getting even tighter around him. Freezing mid-motion, Sherlock throws his head back groaning out a loud “Aaaaah.” that ends in a sigh, before he collapses on John, who takes hold of his hips in a bruising grip and thrusts erratically into him. It doesn’t take long, but when John comes it is so intense that he throws his arms around Sherlock and presses against him as if he was drowning.
Wordlessly, John got up and crossed the room. Pulling out four backpacks from a locker in the corner, he
After two days spent hiding and fighting his body’s annoying demand for food, Sherlock saw the lantern marking the biggest and most crowded Inn at the center of the “Torry”. Cautiously, he watched the people who entered and left the illuminated tavern for almost an hour before he decided that it was unlikely to meet one of Moriarty’s men. Nonetheless, he took a long dark coat from one of the hooks and turned it’s collar up, hiding half of his face in it.
“I love you, too.” The detective said without turning around before he heard John making his way downstairs.
Sherlock lay on the couch, thinking about new ways to get John to have sex with him. He didn’t doubt John’s attraction to him. That much was obvious from the physical evidence he was displaying every time they engaged in sexual contact. Thirty minutes ago, John had silently left the room, after spending an awfully long time in the shower, to
All air left John’s lungs in a huff. There, on Sherlock’s neck, literally black on white, where three letters forming the wonderfully simple word
Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to break his gaze if his life had depended on it. So it happened that he didn’t notice Moriarty’s men until they were standing directly in his line of sight. Instinctively, he took a step backwards before he noticed that both men had turned their backs on him and were directly heading towards John.
The tip of his index finger was moving in circles around the tight entrance. A gentle massage meant to introduce the sensation of touch.
While he tenderly sucked on a full lower lip, he maneuvered his tall lover back on top but before he allowed himself the physical indulgence his hard cock craved, John made himself stop all movement and take in the sight above him. The light sheen of sweat on Sherlock's chest and flat torso. The thin line of hair guiding his eyes to an equally engorged shaft that seemed uncomfortably confined in black satin pants.
He spent the whole day avoiding his flat until there was nothing left to be done outside of 221B but doing some shopping. Realizing that it was overdue gave John a feeling of rightness that he hadn’t had in a long time. Strolling through the aisles, he allowed himself some luxury and chose to buy all the ingredients for his favorite gratin. John smiled to himself.
But he wanted to see. To commit every miniscule expression on Sherlock's face to memory. John felt the fingers on his back clench and unclench. He knew the signs.
Waiting for a confirming nod, John began to pull out slowly. A deep groan prompted him to push back in again before his finger was even halfway out.
A groan was all the answer he got. Without a second thought, John pushed himself up the bed and leant against the wall, one hand still cradling the Detective’s skull through thick curls.
Immediately, Sherlock surged forward and sucked it between his lips. As his tongue touched the small slit at the tip, John’s left hand pushed into his hair. From the corner of his eyes, Sherlock saw the right one clutch at the blanket. Wanting John’s pleasure probably more than the man himself did, Sherlock relaxed his jaw and slid down around the length in his mouth. Without any suction, he just let it rest there while he explored the silky texture with his tongue.
Fortunately, Sherlock didn't need to be told. As they were walking up the stairs, he was carefully reading John's posture and facial expression, his gaze flickering over the tense body.
He has probably taken it too far. He doesn’t know. Uncertainty forces its way into his mind but he pushes it aside.
“I could easily take them out while Sherlock is blinding them but I think we all know what the real problem is.” John stated evenly. A wave of affection reached him through Sherlock’s hand on his as the other men nodded.
His dismay every time Mary put him down with words, the anger he felt boiling under the surface. The threat posed by a psychologist and the way he rejected Sherlock. They all had a source in real life but were so enhanced that they became completely ridiculed and over the top.
It was strangely arousing to offer himself like that but it didn't feel odd. Hadn't he always offered himself up for Sherlock to take?
“No problem, me too.” Sherlock said, waving a hand in a dismissive gesture between them. He braced himself for an argument about politeness and manors when he heard the man laugh good-naturedly.
“Sherlock, can I ask you something about Omega-Heat?” John eventually tried after some seconds of silence.
John walked down the stairs, muttering to himself while clenching and unclenching his hands in frustration. “What?”
Waking up the next day, John makes his decision. He will learn it. Learn to value her and explore his feelings in depth. He will learn to love her. She deserves to be taken seriously and, hell, he deserves to be loved as well.
Partly due to his parent’s dysfunctional marriage and early death in a gruesome fire, but mostly because of the separation from his sister at the age of ten, when both of them had been adopted by different families, John’s childhood had ended early. He never talked about the long time in which he hadn’t seen Harry. He knew that even this minor family drama wasn’t something special, though. (Even though the only things he could remember about his parents were alcohol induced arguments that still made him cringe with fear.)  His only happy childhood memory was the small stream behind their cottage, where he had tried to catch tiddlers with his hands, while his sister sat laughing in the grass watching him.
In astonishment, he noticed that both books had been written by the same person and he supposed the third one was by that author as well. Gwenore Holmes.
Shots rang out in the spacious stairwell before the tall man managed to pull the trigger on his gun. Taken by surprise, John turned around to see Mycroft slowly lowering the army browning as he watched a creature vanish downwards into the well hole.
“Hello. I received your message. Why don’t you just ring and come upstairs.” He said coolly and hung up right after.
When he entered the examination room, John felt extremely nervous. Doctor Rosen gave him a reassuring look that John knew too well from all the times he himself had used it on his patients.
“You will not leave. You will eat breakfast here with me and afterwards you will answer every question I have. Is that understood?” He firmly demanded.
Upon his father’s begging gesture, Sherlock stepped closer to the throne, stopping right beside their guest and looking up expectantly into his father’s eyes. A disapproving glare swept over his rumpled clothes.
The knife hung loosely from her right hand. If it wasn’t for the way the woman was vibrating with energy, ready to pounce at John any second, an unheeding observer would have thought that she’d immediately forgotten about it until she raised it to be level with the doctor’s throat.
“Right.” John said with raised eyebrows as they reached the nondescript meadow and lush grass was filling most of his view.
“When I dangled there halfway in the hole something scratched me and, one way or the other, if it was Phillips or us, what happened in Shikoku triggered the epidemic. If it helps, we are not contagious.” He said to reassure John and temper his guilt. His flat mate’s expression was one of pure worry.
“No idea, really.” Sherlock seemed to be just as disappointed but said nothing as he started to move the settee and table.
“Jesus…” He murmured in amazement. Carefully, he let his body fall on its side to bring them in a more comfortable position for the time of their knotting.
“Erm…I…I have to go now, Sherlock.” Hesitating, he let his fingers slide over the ‘S’, feeling his eyes burn.
As London lay silently, what had been washed deep into the earth by a sudden rain shower three weeks ago, was now fundamental to growth. Neither orange nor green plants were pushing upwards between cobblestones and broken cement. Blossoms falling onto sickly glowing leaves, their fruits grew in just a few hours into crooked versions of vegetable life.
Sherlock replayed his conversation with Beth over and over again. There was a flaw in her assumption of what would happen. She had told him, that he should get over that one kiss and he would be wiser about John’s feelings towards him. If John would have been opposed, Sherlock would have said that he had been caught up in the moment. Good that John had offered a possible moment the exact same day. Better still, he wasn’t opposed in the least.
John took a few seconds to think about a logical answer. “An epidemic, most likely. Probably flu or something absolutely new.”
“That’s three. Who is the fourth?” He asked a little less interested in the topic now that he noticed the warm expression on the other man’s face.
3 hours later, Sherlock was silently standing behind his door, listening carefully for any sign of movement, his violin clamped under his arm. Time to leave.
“Before you ask…  I don’t know if they are mine or yours. Both possibilities are just as likely. I think.” Sherlock corrected himself. Silence stretched between them while John considered the meaning behind the statement.
“The Bond” had been a warm, loving description of a shared lifetime. It had read like a love story and made John think about the wonderful possibilities his newly revealed biology could offer him. It almost sounded too good to be true. John still had his doubts about the whole concept, especially after he had read “The Omega” with a constant blush on his face. The contradictions between the two books were irritating and made John wonder about the personal opinions of the authors. “The Omega” was a disdainful recitation of biological urges and symptoms. As impressive as the descriptions were when it came to the chapters
John inhaled Sherlock’s scent. It was already changing and he supposed his own was too. Soon, they would smell nearly the same. John almost regretted that there were no other Alpha’s out there who would recognize their bond and know that Sherlock was his.
.” John sounded startlingly like Sherlock all those years ago before he returned to his usual persona by grinning cheerfully. “But I wasn’t angry at you. Merely disappointed.”
They sat with her for another hour. Even though John felt bad for her, he also noticed that the three of them hadn't had a long chat in ages and it soon became comfortable and even funny at times. The underlying sadness she had displayed was still there but John was sure that even with London looking like that, they all were relieved that there still was an outside world existing. Three months in a bunker had made each of them tense and depressed in different ways. And the cup of tea didn't hurt either. They were British after all.
When he finally left the surgery, John made his way to the tube station under the hot, burning sun. He stopped for an ice cone and watched the people that were walking by. He felt as if he knew something they didn’t. As if he was happier than everyone else. Surely, he knew that there still were a few obstacles to overcome. Telling Sherlock, for example. But he refused to worry about that. It had been a long time since he had felt that strong for anyone and he was just happy that he was still able to feel that way. He had doubted it, actually.
When Mrs. Phillips turned around again, Sherlock looked at her with a blank expression, not indicating in the least that something had happened while she was occupied.
“What do you see, Sherlock?” The detective studied every minute detail on the expressive face opposite him, his own features softening with every passing second. Yes, he preferred his doctors clean shaven.
A minute later, they reached the door where Mycroft was already waiting for them with a serious expression on his face. Sherlock purposefully placed a hand on John's behind at the last two steps just to enjoy the small twitch in his brothers face.
“Oh, it’s not your fault.” Martha assured as she fondly leaned against him. They hadn’t talked about it but everyone in the bunker had drawn his own conclusions about the correlation between the presence of strangers in their ‘front yard’ and the new addition to the group.
Sherlock was running at full speed with a huge grin plastered all over his face. The stars were hanging heavy in the sky above the narrow alley. His target was still a few paces ahead but Sherlock got gradually closer. Just two meters were separating them now and Sherlock could already hear the jewelry clinging in the thief’s pockets. With all his might he threw himself on the evader, pinning him to the cobblestone. The man tried to push him off, bucking and wriggling beneath him but Sherlock had no problem constricting his every move. After a few minutes the man gave up and began to scream constantly. It was starting to grate on Sherlock’s nerves when he noticed that there was a growing crowd of people at the other end of the alley.
John was pretty sure that the older Holmes took detailed notes of the damage and already considered the cleanup effort it would take to return to the status quo. He envied his optimism.
In his left hand, Sherlock held the solution to all his problems, tempting in a way he hadn’t experienced in years. The table in front of him was already prepared. Somehow he had managed to avoid seeing his own face in the small mirror. He forced his eyes shut and turned his head away from the evidence of painful loss. With two fingers, Sherlock tore the small plastic bag open before he scattered most of the clean white powder all over his reflection in the mirror. It was OK. That would help him to stay alive. To survive the guilt and the loneliness he had to bear. Beside the mirror his phone moaned obscenely.
“Please Sherlock, I need your help! It is something… medical.” He put all his worry in the last word, counting on the strong friendship that had built between them during their short time together.
John wasn’t sure how much to trust Sean in a situation his life might depend on but he knew Sherlock would already have had one or two thoughts on his ability to keep panic at bay.
John Watson apparently chose this special night to be a pain in the arse. Annoying, frustrating, irritating John. Sherlock sat up, leaning against his headboard before he considered an answer.
Their newest companion spared him a sympathetic glance. “They don’t want it. They know they can’t get in. They just don’t want anybody else to have it either if they don’t.” Sean said, sounding guilty.
The living room was empty and dark, only enlightened by the thunderstorm that was raging outside. He called for John but there was no answer and when he came out of his room again after putting on some clothes, the flat was still deserted. Sherlock noticed that the sounds of the storm seemed to be coming right out of the hallway. When he stepped out on the staircase he saw that the front door was wide open.
As soon as Sherlock understood, he loosened his fingers enough to slip from John’s grasp. Chasing satisfaction in a way he had never before and at the same time rubbing against John’s leaking cock, he urgently pushed into his tight grip.
“You were very fast in figuring out that it was me who sent it. Too fast for my taste, anyway. So you should know why.” She answered, barely holding back her anger.
Again, John felt exhilarated rather than anxious as he signalled for Sean to open the door. Sherlock groped his butt in a completely indecent way, not even trying to hide his excitement as he began to focus on creating a detailed illusion.
The good thing was that his anger stood in no contrast to the part he had to play. It was his right to be angry with Mary and forgiving was expected to be difficult for him. It was trying enough for him to play his part at times, though. But he had agreed to do so until the Holmes brothers had found a solution for this whole dreadful business. And found out how big the bigger picture really was.
At the whole concept of gay sex, there was one factor that John just couldn’t get used to. Preparation.  The idea that Sherlock would have to shove his fingers up his arse didn’t seem very appealing and certainly not sexy. John had researched everything that was to know about the right ways to get clean and ready for the actual sex. So, he had taken a shower and cleaned the area in question thoroughly. Afterwards, he had excused himself to have a lie-down but had instead started to stretch himself. At first he had found it unpleasant and a bit painful and when he managed to get two fingers in he was about to call the whole thing off. But he really wanted it. Wanted to give this to Sherlock. Then, suddenly, he had found his prostate.
He had remained sitting on the couch for an hour before he covered the Omega with a blanket and went up to sleep.
No way to answer that genuinely. Or at all, actually. Sherlock couldn’t quite put a finger on the reason for his extreme caution. One moment he wanted to start a string of deductions, the next he found himself unable to speak, worried about the possibility that the murderer would feel insulted and therefore punish them all. Instead he had kept quiet, what in the end had made the murderer much angrier than any insult could ever have done. Sherlock just stood there, frozen to the spot while the accomplices took position behind John and Lestrade. When he heard the safeties on their guns being unlocked the words just started spluttering out of him. Fortunately, he managed to talk as long as Lestrade’s fortification needed to storm the apartment. Meeting their perpetrator while breaking in was his plan all along, not that he would tell John, but getting himself and the others killed not that much. And what was worse was the fact that he suspected somebody else entirely. That had never happened before. He actually had believed that the husband was innocent, how he fell for that was beyond his understanding. In retrospect, all the obvious signs were there he just hadn’t managed to string them together in the right order. Well, mafia bosses
With big strides Sherlock left the room and, taking his phone out of one pocket pressed speed dial before he left through the front door. John watched him distractedly. As if by force, his gaze was pulled back to the piece of tentacle that was lying in front of him and defacing his reality. He knew people mutated into all sorts of things but he had somehow considered tentacles to be part of his dream, a proof even for this fantasy to be less than realistic. But now as his false perception stared back at him he wondered how much of his dream had actually been reality.
Sherlock didn’t seem to have moved during John’s absence but as soon as John was starting to put away most of the groceries he began to watch him with interest.
'I didn’t think things could get worse.' John thought, resting his hand on Sherlock’s on the railing.
“What's that for then?” He asked, hovering in the doorway. Sherlock, seemingly fed up with waiting for him, almost jumped up from his chair.
“I don’t know who you are talking of.” John answered, raising his chin and tensing the muscles in his stomach in preparation for the hard kick of one of Moriarty’s men. He didn’t have to wait long for it to come.
Minutes ticked by as they adjusted to their new reality. It was, quite frankly, frightening. A decision had been made that evening. Finally acknowledging the elephant in the room had forced them to cross a line, and they were both at a loss as to how to proceed.
John put on the night vision and nudged Sherlock to make him do the same. Everything around him slowly turned brighter and more pronounced. He could see the sand piles and rocks around them with surprising clarity. The last time he had worn this kind of equipment had been long ago and even then John remembered being amazed by the effect it had had.
The look he saw on his flat mates face was so openly wanting that Sherlock felt a tingling sensation in his guts. A slowly building burn that he felt heavy between his legs. His own concentration always centered on what John was focused on now moved to his cock, reminding him of the regions of his body that hadn’t received any attention before. John looked at the two tentacles that had been caressing Sherlock’s back and they instantly began to move around his torso, one beginning to slide over his chest and the other exploring the soft skin of his upper thighs and testicles. Sherlock shuddered at the sensation. He knew he was close now with the constant push and pull inside him and the gentle touch between his legs which was gradually becoming unbearable.
Pressing his head into the doctor’s shoulder, Sherlock felt arousal unfurl in his guts. His thighs tensed were they pressed into John’s hips as he sealed his eyes shut and listened to their quickening combined moans.
. John was apparently either less affected or better at controlling himself for he didn’t falter once in his rhythm while Sherlock found it increasingly difficult to not just follow the urge to desperately rut against sweaty flushed skin.
He jumped off of the couch, hurrying to the bathroom while he typed on his phone. If he wanted to go out he would have to shower first. He smelled a bit. OK, not just a bit.
John was only 20 minutes into his therapy with Louise and already glad that Sherlock had left him to his devices. That woman was torturing him. Bending his legs further then they should be bend, stretching his joints and pricking him with needles to force his body (and probably mind) into submission.
“Oi, don’t take it out on me!” The DI held up a hand defensively. “Let’s just have a coffee while you tell me what’s going on.” Sherlock smirked at him and nodded before he took the lead heading for the elevators.
It was no use. The knocking seemed to get louder and louder. It’s rhythm repeating itself over and over again.
4 meters from the house, Sherlock unceremoniously dropped the corpse and straightened up. He could only suppose that Moriarty was armed in some way. Probably a dagger or even a sword. There was no way to know for sure and Sherlock did not have a clue where he could probably find a weapon for himself.
Often, he ended up sweating and breathing hard with dots dancing in his vision. Just as he would notice the signs of panic, he could already feel Sherlock's hand on his chest and hear his deep voice murmuring the physical symptoms he had displayed. Sometime speaking, sometimes just thinking. It was Sherlock's way of reassuring him and, as far as John was concerned, it was the right way.
The first thing John was able to make out in the foreign sunlight was the small plane that lay a few meters away from the entrance. At first, he thought it had been squashed between the masses of stones when the earth around them had opened up to set free whatever had the power to just push up from the earth's core. But at second glance he realized that there was no possible explanation for the regular dents in the plane's mantle. None he was willing to imagine anyway, but his brain was only too happy to supply the picture of an enormous claw that yanked the flying object from the sky and crushed it like a paper dart.
As soon as John stepped through the door of their quarter, he felt Sherlock grab his arm and turn him around before he was forcefully pulled against the taller man.
“That was what Phillips had written all over his manuscripts before he vanished. The lines that implied Cthulhu’s return, right?” John acknowledged, prompting Sherlock to go on.
Enjoying the confining heat of his Omega, John slid in with remarkable control. Eyes closed, he pulled Sherlock slowly onto his cock until he was fully engorged. The new position allowed him to go deeper than ever before. John’s knot was already brushing against the rigid ring of muscles that surrounded his cock.
“None of your business.” Sherlock said, getting up and taking his coat off of the chairs backrest. When the DI didn’t press on, something occurred to Sherlock and he eyed him suspiciously.
“Are you weary of your pitiful life? Shut up or I’ll shoot you!” His voice was full of rage, the gun excessively shaking in his hands.
His smile vanished when he found what he was looking for. Tears welled up in his eyes and his hands were shaking.
“OK, I have an idea. Are you sure you want to see it?” John asked her, implying that it could get experimental. And the fact that she thought about that for a minute or two reminded John of the many reason he was so fond of his former landlady.
“Tell me, John…” Opening his eyes, Sherlock concentrated on the doctor’s expressive face. “Why did you decide to move in with me?”
Sherlock’s stomach was churning and the urge to vomit rose in his body. He was disgusted by his lack of self control but there was nothing he could do against his body’s natural reaction.
“Right now, there are 4 people called John in here. This one.” He was pointing at the barkeeper, a  big, dark haired man with greasy skin and angry marks on his knuckles caused by too many fights with aggressive guests at shut-down. “The one over there.” A boy that was most likely too young to know the difference between spring and fall but drank from a huge glass of Ale. Sherlock shook his head in denial hoping that this wasn’t the one he was searching for.
“Give me six minutes!” He demanded before vanishing into the bathroom. John let his body fall to the side in frustration, muttering
John wanted to explode, he wanted to scream and smash something. He took a very, very deep breath during which he suddenly realized that Sherlock was being the responsible one for once. He smelled a trap but let his breath out in a rush in resignation.
The 24 minutes between ordering and delivery were probably the best in John's life since he’d been 16. Similar to his first kiss, the quiet explorations of skin and the murmured encouragements in his ear, filled his entire being with a mixture of giddiness and calmth.
John stares at his phone. It was Mike's idea to make that thing with the pictures, just to see if John would find these features attractive if they weren’t in that intimidating package of Sherlock-ness. If he had been honest with himself, which he quite seldom was when it came to Sherlock,  he sure as hell
Before he could reply, the weight of Sherlock’s words sank in and John couldn’t stop himself from gaping at the consulting detective.
Apparently, his former landlady had the least problem with this mornings painful interruption. Seemingly undisturbed herself, she fussed over Sean as he followed the noise to it’s source.
“There is no sound, taste or voice that doesn’t remind me of you. Everything lost its value the day I lost you. Sentiment, I know. God, I am just so angry. And it makes it worse that I can't hate you. I wish I could. Oh, how I wish I could hate you. Maybe I could move on then. Maybe I could start a new life somewhere else. But I'm just sitting there. Every day. I'm staring at your violin for hours, imagining you’d come and play for me. Imagination grew very important to me in the last month, I daresay. I can’t even count how often I've pictured you returning. I can almost hear you chuckle at that. Amusing! I remember your laugh but not my own. I don't think that's a problem, I won’t need it again. Just another thing I have lost.” He was clearing his throat to find the bravery to proceed.
With his sympathetic face and wakeful eyes, the former librarian couldn’t have been very dear to them.
Sherlock was straddling his hair and cuddled closer, so close that John could hear his heartbeat when he found his bravery again.
He went to sleep, half expecting to find the note gone in the morning and for the first time in a very long while he was looking forward to waking up.
“Don’t tell me…No. Oh God! Urgh!” Sherlock’s face contorted with repulsion.  In a hurry he fled the room to get away from this crime against every law of nature. Behind him he heard Lestrade laugh in the empty room.
Without Sherlock's help, the doctor wouldn't have had the confidence to perform a surgery after his long time of abstinence but his partner calmly listed the steps and needed supplies even though they both knew that it wasn't necessary at all.
John notices it. The looks. The giggles Amy tries to suppress. She's in love. Well, shit! She kisses him with less tongue this time, chaste and almost reverent. John is enjoying it as always but still….There is something missing. He can’t quite put his finger on it, yet, but he already knows. She isn’t the one. They start getting a bit more sensual. He leads her up to his room, kissing her like he means it. He doesn’t.
John pressed a grateful kiss into the thick curls of Sherlock's head, hugging the lanky man tight against his chest.
“You know that it would have been acceptable for me to do it the other way around, John?” His voice was muffled by the shirt he was currently pulling over his head and the effort it took to keep upright, while he tried to get rid of his socks, using only his feet.
“Did something happen while I was in coma? I mean something other than you visiting me in hospital and driving the staff up the walls?” John inquired suspecting.
He positions himself above John’s leaking prick, holding it so the head is pushing against his loosened entrance.
Alpha?” Although he tried very hard, John wasn’t able to appear scandalized. His heart was doing strange things, like jumping up and down, in his chest. It was distracting.
“Milk, two sugars.” Lestrade said when he handed Sherlock his coffee. They had decided to use the break room instead of the DI’s office mostly because it was the only room with a coffee machine. The room wasn’t very welcoming with it’s grey walls and hard chairs but neither Sherlock nor the DI cared much about such petty things.
He felt Sherlock relax under his hands. Eagerly participating in the kiss that was so very overdue. A warm feeling was spreading through his chest when John felt the first touch of nimble fingers against his neck. The simple movement of lips, brushing and winding against one another, innocent and unhurried, made his heart clench.
. The constant ringing of the phone and voice messages of their client, the apparent widow, was only an annoying background noise. He couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was that made him uneasy but watching Sherlock somehow managed to calm his worry. Deliberately, he sat down and put his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. The skin felt cold and moist under his fingers. Cautiously, he slid his hand into sticky curls. He hadn’t planned to do that when he entered the room but seeing Sherlock in this weak state caused a strong wave of affection to bloom inside his chest. He felt oddly protective. Unlike other times when he very well knew that Sherlock could stand up for himself but protected him anyway. The Detective pushed his head into the touch, turning on his back and trying to sooth some kind of itch by moving restlessly on the sheets.
The note was still where he left it in the evening, offending him with its presence. John forced himself to eat a small breakfast before he left the flat to take a walk in the park. The fresh air didn’t help clear his head and after a while he found himself sitting on a bench, staring at the pond.
He pushed himself almost fully of Sherlock’s cock before he sank down again. This time they gasped simultaneously. Sherlock looked in awe at John’s body as it moved above him. All this time, his hands had been lying limply at his sides but now he grabbed John’s hips to support him. John steadily established a comfortable rhythm, moving up and down on Sherlock’s hard arousal.
It had been a long time since John had had anal sex. Never with a man, though. And never with somebody important to him. Although that wasn’t true. It was just that in comparison to Sherlock everybody else lost relevance.
He knelt down beside him, spreading the oil in his hands while giving John's body a visual once-over.
Every surface in the room was inhabited by various skulls. Not only human skulls, there were some cats, dogs and even a few mice skulls. On the couchside table, which was covered by not less than 12 of them was a small piece of paper neatly folded to stand like some sort of reserved sign in a restaurant. John took the two steps to the table cautiously and slow, fearing he might pass out from the absurdity. A quick look around assured him that he was alone in the room before he leaned down to grab the paper. He rounded the table and sat down on the couch, fiddling with the small note. A note. What else would it be?
Sherlock was lying on the couch, apparently deep in thought, after watching him for almost an hour while he had clumsily collected bullet points for his plot.
"I suggest we don't risk too much then." Sherlock muttered while turning to the clicking door. In his leather jacket and rough jeans he managed to be somewhat of a distraction to John who was relieved to know that Sherlock would be somewhere behind him and therefore out of sight while he had to be concentrated.
This was much safer terrain for him. Being a doctor and all. But still… This was Sherlock offering himself to John in a pretty romantic way.
He senses Sherlock hovering in the doorway, apparently uncertain how to react to an overly emotional John. Really not his area. But still….
“Not important. You were brave enough to say it. That’s the point. Your heart rate was elevated. The room seemed brighter all of a sudden because your pupils dilated so much with that simple touch. He meant it. At least in that moment. And if you hadn’t been so drunk you would still know how often he licked his lips that evening.”
John pushed Sherlock on his back, pressing their straining erections together while he sucked at that gloriously long neck to mark it as his own. They moaned simultaneously as Sherlock started to move his hips in rhythmic motions crossing his legs around John’s waist.
But it already was John doing that to him. How did he still not see it? He was like a sleepwalker, just repeating the same steps every night and moving a tiny bit further.
As sudden as the nuisance had started, it stopped. Relieved, the bunkers inhabitants recovered, wiping the wetness from their faces and breathing deliberately slow.
“Yes. Good.” Sherlock sighed, pressing his heels hard into the mattress. With an appreciative tilt of his mouth, John decided that he could work with that.
“Are there now some leftovers or are there not?” Sherlock asked, turning around to face John who was gaping at him and fighting the urge to open his jeans to relief some tension.
“Did you actually listen to me?” The Consulting Detective asked annoyed. “And if anyone did, it was Howard Phillips.” He added defensively.
“No, Mrs. Hudson. I know you only want to help but there is nothing to talk about. Nothing. I am fine. Nothing wrong, whatsoever. Ok?” He stared into her eyes, his expression somewhere between pleading and forceful.
Unsure what to do, John remained standing right where he was and looked questioningly at Sherlock. If he’d expected to get his explanation that easy he was obviously wrong for the Detective just sat down in his chair, calmly staring back at him.
“I knew that you were lying. I knew it. But apparently that doesn't stop me from…” John hesitated. “You convinced me that acting happy and normal was the same thing as being happy and normal. That it doesn't matter who I am but what I do.” He felt the moisture gather in his eyes as he clenched his fists painfully.
“Do you actually know what it is?” The doctor asked raising his brows and looking steadily at his flat mate.
The room was filled with steam but John still managed to avoid the bottles and tubes that had fallen from their medicine cabinet and now cluttered up the floor. He almost stepped on a razor when he saw Sherlock sitting in the bath tub looking embarrassed and frustrated at the same time. Swallowing the laughter that was threatening to overcome him he held out a hand for the detective to take.
In the evening he visited him again, telling him painful lies about his family. He claimed that the king didn’t love Sherlock, that he just wanted to get rid of him. He made up stories about affairs both his parents were having behind each other’s backs. And when he noticed that the lies didn’t work he started to insult Sherlock, calling him ugly, dumb and pathetic. With every word he said, Prince Sebastian grew more and more agitated but Sherlock only laughed at him. It wasn’t an amused laugh, though. It was provoking and arrogant and Sherlock enjoyed every minute of it. Eventually, Prince Sebastian gave up and left and although Sherlock knew that he had won this time, he felt exhausted and a little bit homesick. He lay on the bed, hugging himself tightly while he fought back his emotions until he fell asleep, at last.
John let his eyes wander through the room in a way that would appear to most people as if he wasn’t sure how he’d ended up in a scenario like that. He noticed an old puppet lying in one corner of the room, the leaves piled up against the far wall and every inch of rotten wallpaper hanging from the ceiling. And he didn’t miss the shadow behind the front door. John didn’t trust people easily. Most tried to get on his good side hoping to have a strong link to the Watson family in times of need. Even though he’d had handed the responsibility for the
“Don't worry, it's not going to happen again.” John vaguely promised as he fled the room to get dressed.
“I think it’s the bond. I can barely stop myself from searching the flat for rivals. If you didn’t notice, I looked under the bed before I left the room.” Sherlock grinned. Naturally, he had noticed. Taking John’s hand, he pulled him against his chest and closed his arms around the Alpha.
Bright sunlight fell through the window as John woke up to soft violin sounds coming from the parlour. Disoriented at first, he realised that he was still lying in Sherlock's bed with a soft blanket covering his overheated body. Looking around, he saw his dressing gown neatly folded on the chair across from him.
That certainly explained the bulky back but what John hadn't seen from their earlier distance were the man's claws. One was now dangling loosely from side to side in an obviously painful angle.
“Yorick speaks of you, you know? You always argued about his name but that is none of your concern anymore, is it? How else would you name a skull? And he is quite smart. He is right about so many things. I understand why you talked to him so often. He is the reason that I am talking to you now. There was one thing he said… and I…I had to agree with him.” He knew that it would be hard and he didn’t want to hurt Sherlock but he had to say it. He had to say it out loud.
“I really don’t know what to think right now.” John muttered, shaking his head as he resumed to pace.
Warmth spread through Sherlock’s chest and he started feeling light headed. In a surge of emotion, he pushed John against the door frame and kissed him urgently, pressing as close as possible against the doctor. His doctor.
Sherlock marveled at John’s tightness and how wet his preparations had left him. The slow movement was almost unbearable to stand. It was teasing him just enough to make his cock ache, although it was definitely not enough to make him come. He felt John changing the angle of his thrusts a few times before he understood what he was trying to accomplish and grabbed his hips just a bit tighter. John stilled and looked down at him, questioningly.
went to the pub early/ 4 pints, 3 whiskey/ turned down by at least two women/ tried to sleep on the stairs/ sexual identity crisis in full progress
Sherlock made a thoughtful face and John wondered if he'd ever stop this old habit of obvious thinking. He was fairly sure that Sherlock had already deduced what was to know about their new companion. But maybe, he was just feeling comfortable back in his terrain after the long time of abstinence.
In Afghanistan, he gradually developed a feeling of self-worth and control and when it ended, it seemed as if some kind of deity had kicked John back into the preposterous, average existence he so loathed.
“Hmmmm, John.... How tired are you?” His voice was deep and teasing. John knew it was completely on purpose, especially considering that Sherlock didn't need to talk aloud but it only served to make him grin and shiver at the same time.
“Fantastic!” John smiled at his new note, walking over to the desk. He sat down, digging around in his pockets for his wallet. When he found it he pulled out the 20 quid he had meant to use as a message. “Brilliant!” He grinned shaking his head. In the corner of the banknote he had written:
One month later, Prince Sebastian was found dead in his bed, a single coin lying on his chest. Rumors said that he had died from a broken heart after losing his beloved Prince Sherlock.
“Oh God, Sherlock!” John looked down at his new lover. Sherlock looked debauched and was probably the most erotic sight in his life. Unselfconsciously basking in his pleasure, virgin was the last word that seemed to apply to him. John positioned himself between Sherlock’s legs, coating his fingers with a generous amount of lube. He began rubbing his thumb against Sherlock’s entrance in soft small circles to loosen the rigid muscle. Sherlock moaned even louder, growling impatiently after a few minutes. Carefully, John inserted his index finger in tiny thrusting motions. Sherlock started writhing beneath him and pushing against his finger which John took as a hint to add another digit.
into the open, as John privately called them. The technician and the pilot still spent their time hidden away, avoiding especially the Holmes brothers. John suspected that they’d decided to blame Mycroft for not being with their families when everything fell apart.
When it was time to get ready for their nocturnal excursion, Sherlock made sure that John was watching him as he pulled on his leather jacket. In turn the soldier made a show of checking his gun in-depth before they left their quarters. Both of them basked in the anticipation of excitement and possible danger. John had long accepted that he didn't handle boredom much better than Sherlock did. He was just less dramatic about it.
Minutes went by. The birds around him were busy collecting dry leaves and small twigs. A single ant was passing right in front of John's feet, shielded by the grass as it moved in a gentle breeze.
Squinting against the broad daylight, Sherlock took the lead as soon as he sensed that there were no minds outside to be manipulated. Wherever the scavengers had gone, they were out of his range. Far enough for him and the others to be safe, assuming that the assailants didn’t have any sniper rifles in their possession.
With an indulgent grin, Sherlock crossed his arms beneath his head and gave John a challenging look.
“I know you would see right through it, but that doesn’t matter. And, actually, nothing matters anymore. You left me, Sherlock! You fucking left me!” He took a steadying breath to calm down, it was a cemetery after all.
“O…k…” He muttered, unerringly choosing the jam and a toast. He shoved the bacon a bit further away in order to not smell it while eating his toast. Sherlock devoured all of the biscuits with his tea. John hadn’t yet dared to take a sip of his cuppa. The tea looked a bit too milky and there was no steam rising from it. After he’d eaten his first toast his stomach kept growling at him angrily. Silently, both of them ate almost everything Sherlock had put out for breakfast. With interest John watched Sherlock’s attempt to eat the bacon. After two cautious sniffs and a hesitant lick the Consulting Detectives throat had constricted and his eyes had watered as he fought the nausea.
Sherlock was still calling him, his voice already hoarse by all the screaming. Hastily, John crossed to the bedroom, chucking his few clothes on the way.
Laughing and sweating profoundly, they were leaning against the wall and each other while they tried to relish the satisfaction of a good chase.
All of a sudden, John felt a familiar stirring in his groin. He forced a false yawn from his mouth and began walking up the stairs.
John thought, instantly dismissing the offer. It was three days after Yorick had magically vanished from 221b and John was already freaking out. Somehow, he hadn’t noticed how many conversations consisted only of him talking to that skull. Scratching his neck, a newly developed habit that caused sore and itchy marks, John considered never talking to any human again.
He read Hamlet 14 times in five days. It didn’t help. He didn’t find the answer. With every passing minute, he grew more and more agitated. He had a strong feeling of being manipulated, not a thought that amused him. He had to take things in hand and be the one in control. It wasn’t that hard to find a fitting quote to express his worries and he didn’t even try to use another handwriting. What for? He folded the paper and set it in the same place he’d found the other note.
John turned around, his arms full of convenience food and an apple in his mouth. Throwing an angry look at Sherlock, he carefully made his way to the couch where he sat down and began to eat the apple after placing all the food in close proximity around himself.  If he hadn’t been so preoccupied with eating he probably would have laughed at the offended look Sherlock gave him because of his choice of place. After a rather ridiculous attempt at turning inside his chair to face John, Sherlock got up and sat down beside his flat mate.
With almost all of his weight supported, Sherlock let his knees slide apart opening himself wider and dragging his testicles over John's hard arousal. The almost tickling sensation on his tetchy flesh made the hair on John's body stand on end and the need for more unbearable.
Slowly, Sherlock put down the box he was currently filling with his lab equipment. He let his fingers rest on it for a few seconds, his head hanging down in a way that felt very wrong to John. Eventually, he turned to face his friend, his expression blank and detached.
“Downstairs.” Was the only thing John understood when the Consulting Detective closed the door and left.
Sherlock was the one ending the kiss by raising his head. For a short moment John kept his eyes closed, still caught up in the shift of reality around him. Sherlock watched him with interest as he opened his eyes and his pupils had to adjust to the daylight pervading the room. There was a moment of silence where they looked at each other and didn’t dare move.
And there, in the quiet togetherness of their shared flat, Sherlock could admit that he wasn’t sure about his own theories.
In contrast to the world in general, the time between being shot and waking up from his coma didn't exist for John. It all felt as if he had suddenly opened his eyes in a different dimension where everything looked the same but wasn't.
Prince Sebastian was a bulky, wild looking man that always appeared to be on the way to chop down a tree, wearing dirty brown trousers and ugly checkered shirts. A stroppy dark beard covered the biggest part of his hideous face but his eyes gave away enough of his violent personality.
If asked, Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to explain what it was that appealed to him about wearing John’s name on his skin. Probably because, for a long time now, Sherlock saw John as belonging to him. As being his. So, of course, it just felt right that he was now marked as John’s. If it were anybody else’s initials, Sherlock would have hated the idea of being marked and would probably consider cutting the offending skin off instead of covering it with a different design. But this was John’s mark. John’s claim on him.
Sherlock had been ridiculously bad tempered for 5 long days now. Agitated, he paced up and down the living room, muttering to himself while constantly scratching his lower back. When John attempted to start a conversation, Sherlock immediately began throwing insults at him, stepping so close they were almost touching. Only a millimeter separating them in those situations. A mere millimeter that somehow accomplished to grate on John’s nerves, made his skin tingle and his fingers itch.
John had known for a long while that his relationship to Sherlock was different to every other friendship or working relationship he'd had before. He admired Sherlock's intellect and couldn’t fool himself into believing that he never thought of Sherlock as beautiful or even gorgeous. Still…. It was a huge step between fantasy and the first physical gay experience of his life. But he had to admit that the kiss was way too sensual to pretend it didn’t mean anything to him. And, thinking about it, he knew he wanted the kiss to mean something. He had indulged in his sexual identity crisis yesterday. Enough of that. Time to soldier on and do what felt right. But how far was he willing to go? And more important, how far was he able to go?
“I’d say, you are having a mental breakdown probably caused by the strong physical change you had to endure shortly after losing your husband. Judging by  the pearls around your neck, your reddened eyes and the golden earrings that are clearly above your income, I suppose the death of your mother was the crucial factor in your decision that somebody, in the end me, had to be responsible for that. But I can assure you that it was, in fact, John. At least in your case.”
“Good that you seek help so soon. Most men don’t.” Rosen took a deep breath before he spoke on. “Well, Dr. Watson, as you might have suspected, I need to see the bulge and, as you said, I might not be able to recognize it while your penis is flaccid. My plan is to look at it in both states.”
They had crossed two thirds of the distance when the earth started to quiver beneath their feet. At first, John thought he might have lost his footing on the rough stones and kept on running. He barely managed to let himself fall backwards when he saw the earth below the two men give way. Sherlock kicked him painfully in the kidneys having been to close to stop before he ran into him.
John already felt the first signs of orgasm build in his belly and his mind go blank. Sherlock’s labored breathing indicated the detective to be in a similar state and made him decide that it was ok to let go. He crossed his legs behind the detective’s thighs and rutted hard against him, chasing completion while mumbling incoherently.
“How long do you feel like that? Two weeks? Three? Don’t fall for your lizard brain John!” Sherlock said angrily.
Struggling for control over his overwhelmed body Sherlock rolled to the side, effectively pulling John with him.
Sherlock had expected to find the wife’s lover in their secret apartment where he would, no doubt, be packing to leave London as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they ran directly into the still angry and murderous husband, who was seeking revenge even after his wife was already “punished” .
“I think its about time you started calling me Martha. I haven't been your landlady for a while now, John.” She smiled at him unobtrusively.
When Sherlock was done he leant back in his chair seemingly trying to focus on the here and now by blinking rapidly.
“Sherlock! Let me have a look at your thigh.” John yelled from the bathroom fetching his overly used first aid kit.
wasn’t his area. He walked around London for more than three hours before he was able to come up with a plan. As unusual as it was, he needed advice. There was only one problem: Who should he ask? He considered talking to Lestrade but was fairly certain that John would be embarrassed if he ever found out about it. There was Molly, but in contrast to general belief he knew that, asking her for (if his assumption was right) a probably romantic advice, would only be cruel and a hindrance to their shared work. Sherlock also thought about asking Mrs. Hudson but he knew her so well that he’d had the whole conversation in his mind palace, instead, and it only lead to an extremely excited Mrs. Hudson which would, no doubt, drop hints for John every time she saw him. Mycroft was out for obvious reasons. That’s how Sherlock found himself at Blackfriars, in a place he never thought he’d see from the inside.
“I wouldn’t be opposed.” Sherlock stated with a rough voice as his eyes fell close. John felt him push back, the detective’s hip bones brushing his belly every now and then as he felt his cock harden at the smooth rhythm they were building.
He felt the deep rumble around his cock before he heard it and his eyes flew open. He raised his head letting his arm fall limply beside his head. Sherlock’s voice, being an octave deeper than usual, emanated from the gorgeous mouth and sent vibrations through John’s whole body as the Consulting Detective pushed back against the tentacle entering him. The tiny thrusting motions of it’s pinnacle were mesmerizing to John as they caused waves of movement in Sherlock’s hips and back.
John just considered stealing a kiss when a hand shot up between their faces and he shrank back. Before he had even made a conscious decision he helped Sherlock, who was holding tight onto four digits, by grabbing the wrist. They used their body weight and all of their strength to crawl backwards but it took them over minute to pull the man over the edge. Something was still holding onto his leg and kept pulling hard.
“John.” The doctor’s hand stopped in his tracks. “If you don’t mind. I’d rather have a different part of you now.”
Even though he had successfully appeared cheeky and confident when he went into his room, in truth he was anything but. He had a strange feeling in his chest. A tingling sensation he usually felt when he was in immediate danger. And wasn’t he? How long had he watched John for hints of attraction? Tried to make him flustered, intrigued or even aroused with the most ridiculous cameos. A few minutes ago, John had unknowingly joined in into this dangerous game.
“So, how is my brother then?” Sherlock asked bluntly, interrupting them harshly as he stepped into the parlour.
John paced up and down the living room. He would have to ask the right questions to get the answers he needed. And he needed a lot of those.
“Alright, boys. I have a lot of things to do so I'll leave you to it.” She let her hand rest on his shoulder for a second before she took the tray and left.
Which, in fact, was only one. Self-lubrication. Sherlock’s body was preparing his entrance to get penetrated. That was the logical part of his brain, giving him facts but the lizard part only showed him Sherlock writhing beneath him, crying out his name and begging him to be knotted.
Keeping himself in check during the drive back turned out to be very, very difficult. Especially with Sherlock entwining their fingers immediately after sitting in the back of the car, hidden from the driver's sight behind a black glass barrier.
The only reaction that drew from the grinning man in front of him was a shrug. John had to hold up his hand in a
“Fucking hell.” John said again. He subconsciously began to drag one finger over his prick while he just stood in the doorway watching Sherlock whose skin was moist with sweat.
Only when he’d had to make a conscious decision in taking John’s hand he’d suddenly come back to himself.
It was a lazy afternoon that Sherlock spent in the garden catching bugs and classifying them, using an old book he had found in his father’s library. He relished his solitude. He had always been eager to be left alone but his wish was rarely granted.
The doctor’s brows sat a little higher on his face now and John let his gaze wander through the room while he attempted to sound as professional as possible in spite of his embarrassment.
For three days, Sherlock was utterly left alone except for the chambermaid that brought him his food. He had used these days wisely, finding out when the guards changed and interrogating his chambermaid about possible ways to flee if he had to. Luckily, she seemed to be quite taken with him and wasn’t as stupid as most people Sherlock had had to talk to in his life. He avoided addressing her though to not disgruntle her by using the wrong name (again). He forgot it all the time. Something like Milly or Maggy.
“I made tea and if you go buy them, we could eat scones and have breakfast while I answer your questions. If you still want me to, that is.” Sherlock replied with faked confidence.
“Approximately three times per hour when we are alone. Once every two hours when we are not or in some way busy. Every 4 minutes when we are alone in a cab.”
John, though, had until two weeks ago been straight as an arrow. Sherlock had tried to coax him into closer physical contact than snuggling and, as John once put it quite rudely, “dry-humping”, but John had always stopped abruptly before one of them had any chance to climax. It was frustrating. They only once managed to take their shirts off, never their trousers. His strong need for John was entirely foreign to him. Sherlock’s patience grew even thinner than it had been before but he didn’t quite know how to get John to talk about it.
Being a solid 2 on the Kinsey scale had mentally prepared John for such an act but he was still feeling nervous about the practical side of it all. He had long learned that not every fantasy is worth indulging in. Kneading Sherlock’s thighs with his hands while licking and nibbling his cock to hardness was… not horrible. In fact,  John found it just as gratifying as pleasing a woman but with the reward of deep rumbling encouragement.
The six of them cautiously made their way towards a door in the back, stepping over broken bottles and glas in the bar area while trying to stay close to the light from the transom.
Already taking a step forward, John raised his hand in a signal to move. He trusted Greg to have his back if what they found would turn out to be dangerous. What ever it was, it was small and fast. The niche under the stairs couldn't hold anything bigger than a dog but even a hungry dog could become a problem in the destroyed world it was now inhabiting.
With a nod and a touch of his hand, John signalled for Sherlock to close the door. Greg helped turning the rotary control to ‘Close’ before he listened to the description of their surroundings.
“Don’t you want to see my back as well?” Sherlock asked confidently. She threw her head around and regarded him for a few seconds.
With Lauren, it’s much the same. They have dates and spend a disgusting amount of time together, but John always comes when Sherlock asks him to, and even comes when Sherlock doesn’t find a reason to call him back home. Probably this means progress. Maybe it doesn’t. Sherlock still counts on it though. He observes him closely every minute they spend together, watches for signs in John’s behavior that imply that he finally
Two weeks had passed since Sherlock’s heat. They had a new case and Sherlock wasn’t even remotely as pliant as before. Agitatedly, he paced up and down the kitchen floor. Constantly talking to himself, he randomly picked up crime scene photos and stared at them for a few seconds only to throw them on the table again.
“We should make a list of things we take with us tomorrow. And I want to go outside in a few hours. We need the night vision gear, two guns and silencer.” Sherlock beamed at him in glee.
“Oh, John. I knew you were one in a million but…Not literally.” Sherlock’s breath blew over John’s erection with every word and elicited a whimper from his throat.
“So why doesn’t John have ten… physical symptoms?” The DI had a point. Sherlock had thought about that for the last days and had only come up with a vague theory.
John burned his tongue. The hot tea had found his lips by automatism as the good doctor watched Sherlock’s face intently and strained his ears trying not to miss a single syllable of his inner monologue.
“On the floor.” John growled, dangerously. A shudder ran over Sherlock’s back only to pool heavily in his groin.
Agonizingly slow, the tension crept out of John’s body and he sank back onto the bed. He didn’t even manage a fast clean-up before he fell asleep.
that for some reason was mostly obtained through female acquaintances, even his play-acts served to broaden John’s horizon on the matter.
“What…!” he began to yell when his gun was pulled from his grip and he saw Sherlock kneel down in front of him, leaning heavily against the wall and aiming high.
John bit his lower lip to keep himself from pushing in too fast. He felt himself being engulfed in tightness, every clench of Sherlock’s inner walls making it harder for him to breath. As soon as he had thought it the tentacles around Sherlock’s body fastened and he entered his lover completely. Fighting his instinct to thrust in and out, he kept his gaze fixed at Sherlock, who wore a look of astonishment as he stared right back into the doctor’s eyes.
In the dark silence of the night he could easily admit that he’d been afraid and compromised. Afraid that John would get hurt and compromised by his sentiment towards the loyal colleague. Sherlock didn’t believe in psychology, especially not behaviorism. However, he diagnosed that he had generalized John’s name and appearance as trustworthy and genuine. A perfectly healthy, psychological mechanism. None the less, it was an inexcusable mistake on his part and a huge disadvantage when it came to his work. Luckily, this automatism could easily be removed if he watched out for it. Lesson learned.
For a few seconds, nobody said anything while they collectively tried to understand what they’d just spotted.
wanted a massage but the fact that he suddenly felt exhilarated at the prospect of Sherlock doing it…
that was barely visible above the consulting detective’s waistband. With a short nod he prompted him to go on.
John sucked in a deep breath, grinning impossibly wide. Trying to appear unaffected he said determinedly “On your knees!” and bend down to kiss Sherlock’s back. The Omega pushed himself up, kneeling in front of John who took hold of his hips and licked a long stripe down his spine.
“Oh… It’s not that easy John. I am happy that I will be your first, though. I wasn’t sure that I made the right deduction.” John can’t see what Sherlock is doing but he can imagine it in distinctive clarity. His cock twitches with interest when Sherlock slowly starts to move against his hand.
John felt stretched in a way that was neither comfortable nor painful. Experimentally, he sank further down and watched Sherlock’s eyes widen, his mouth opening as his jaw went slack.
“Such a shame. I’ve been collecting earrings half my life and now they are of no use anym…” Sherlock tuned her out as he leveled his attention back at the box. It was heavy. 18 to 20 pounds, he estimated. The box was made of cardboard and hadn’t been bound in any way.
Having brought everything necessary with them, Sherlock and John prepared a simple lunch. Dried egg, pulverised cream and chicken straight from the tin were good enough for most of them. Apart from one extremely disgusted member of the Holmes family that let everyone know that food frozen for 20 years was still better than food dried for one day.
John started to fumble with the lube that he had placed on the bedside table, earlier. His own throbbing cock made his movements more clumsy while Sherlock still rubbed himself against his thigh, moaning his name as a demand to hurry.
Imitating what he’d often observed on strangers, he did what would hopefully feel good and followed his body’s demands. Even before he could make the decision to follow through with this he pressed his lips to John’s as his hands found their way to the doctor’s shoulders where they started restlessly roaming the offered body beneath them.
Carefully, he tried to push the chairs away with his right foot. The resulting screech appeared deafening but the thing in the corner seemed unfazed. John wasn't even sure it was still alive.
Sherlock is sprawled out on the sofa, clutching his phone in one hand while the fingers of the other tap impatiently on the table.
“Did I do that to you? You said I did it to Mrs. Phillips.” He inquired, letting his other hand rest on Sherlock’s hip. He tried to pry beneath the closed cuts but didn’t want to just press his finger inside of them.
John couldn’t stop the tears running down his face as he sat on the couch, holding tight to the small white sheet of paper. He wasn’t hurt but these words held no comfort either. While they ratcheted up his hope, they also made him feel betrayed and lost. He knew he couldn’t be certain that the quote was from….the person he expected it to be from, but his instinct told him it was. After all, his instinct had saved his life more than once. He rubbed his face with his hands, struggling to calm down and think of a way to proceed.
Passing the staff area, Sherlock made his way to the kitchen and from there into the farmyard. It was enclosed by high fences that were thickly overgrown with roses but relying on Mindy, he soon found a hole on the far side of the vegetable garden. Gracefully, he crawled through it to the other side.
every second of his existence, believed that Sherlock wasn’t a fake. If the note wanted to make him believe that he lied, John would be certain that it didn’t come from a friend.
Still, John needed time to catch up with the world. Two months ago, John would have jumped at the chance to take Sherlock to bed but, as it was, he preferred a quiet evening in. Exchanging kisses and soft touches instead of following his need to merge with the lithe body of the one and only consulting detective on the planet.
John moved restlessly in his chair searching for the right thing to say but it appeared there was none. He didn't want to sound dramatical or even resigned but that was exactly how he felt.
“I said I love you and you're still here. We had amazing sex and you're still here.” John grinned at him while he slowly pulled out of Sherlock and rolled on his side. He threw the condom on the floor before he turned to look at Sherlock trying to convey as much with his face as with his words that he meant what he was about to say. He slung one arm around Sherlock’s narrow waist before he cuddled up against his chest. He didn’t dare to look up now. Then the words would have to be enough.
Sherlock turned around from the window as he sensed him but didn't stop playing until he saw the tension on John's face.
“Nice try.” The doctor leant back in his armchair. “We both know that you can’t stay here forever, right?” He waited for Sherlock to acknowledge the truth with a slight indication of his head.
Leaning down, he pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s neck before he moved to the side to lick at the bond mark. Sherlock’s body shuddered at the touch and a low moan left his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes shot open. It felt as if his tentacles were being pulled away from his back one by one. John’s look of concentration told him all he had to know. He immediately wanted to close his eyes again. He couldn’t stand the intensity of their closeness. Not only that he had never felt anything like this before but he also had never had any sexual contact in the context of a shared emotion. Surely, sex had been an object of his studies for a short time in his youth but he quickly condemned it when he noticed that it just wasn’t possible for him to achieve an orgasm. It shocked him now how acute his own arousal felt in John’s presence. With John touching him where he hadn’t touched himself in years.
John awoke with the feeling of nimble fingers caressing his scalp. Tiredly, he blinked his eyes open. Sherlock was lying right beside him on his back, petting John’s head with his left hand. A fond smile grazed Sherlock’s face as he watched his Alpha waking up. John’s heart clenched in his chest. At any other time, John would have tried to talk to Sherlock but as soon as he was fully alert to his surroundings, his body instantly reacted to the strong scent of arousal in the room. He let his gaze drift over Sherlock’s naked form, noticing that the Omega was fisting his refreshed erection with the other hand.
“Where were you?” Sherlock asked agitatedly when John carried the groceries into the kitchen. Raising the bags a bit higher and his eyebrows as well.
“Mine!” John growled when it finally slipped in and bit hard into the curve of Sherlock’s neck. The skin was breaking under his teeth and the taste of blood was filling his mouth. The world turned white around the Alpha and an immense wave of emotion washed over him. For a few seconds he was sure he felt a second heartbeat inside his body but then it was gone and he was back on the bed in Sherlock’s room, buried deep inside the Omega. His Omega.
attracted. But he was actually looking forward to the pictures. Now that he has them, has seen them and looked at every single one -definitely more than once- his mouth is dry, he feels arousal surge through his guts, his heart pounding violently against his ribcage. And that text. That last bloody text from Sherlock. For half an hour, he entertained the possibility that he was only physically attracted to his genius flat mate but not at all emotionally. But then he got that text. While most people would probably have jumped up from the bed, ran down the stairs and licked every part of Sherlocks body (and yes, John briefly imagined doing just that.), he just began to giggle about Sherlock's impatience and felt a warm wave of affection rise in his chest.
“I didn't know how. And I wasn't sure you hadn't changed your mind.” Sherlock admitted into the air between them. With their foreheads leaning against each other and their knees touching, John still didn't feel close enough.
Greg and Mrs. Hudson had agreed to take turns checking on the state of the bunkers newest inhabitant after John had told them what to look for and to call him immediately when he woke up. During the last ten minutes of the surgery when John was putting the final stitches Sherlock had given Mycroft a complete account of their trip to the surface and even though none of them said so, it was clear that they were all worried about the possible threads waiting outside.
John’s knot was pressing against the walls of Sherlock’s entrance, bearing down on his prostate insistently. When he felt the Alpha’s teeth breach his skin, Sherlock had barely touched his cock but his climax hit him severely. He threw his head to the side, giving John space to claim him.
He forced his eyes to open. Light was coming from the kitchen and illuminating the floor around him. His hands pushed into the soft surface of the carpet beneath him as he took a quick inventory of his physical condition.
While John didn’t have the pressure of having to keep Sherlock occupied he still called the Yard a few days later.  The Consulting Detective’s ongoing obsession with Howard Phillips and his whereabouts worried John more than one of his moods would have done. 221B was constantly filled with Sherlock’s restless typing. Every now and then John tried to bring some kind of order into the various stacks of papers that were scattered over every surface of their flat but he had long lost any idea of what Sherlock meant to do with them or what information they actually held for him. When, after three days, Sherlock had obviously not come to any conclusion but didn’t snap either, john decided to get them another case. But it was a lost cause. Right after the Mullin’s case Lestrade had called in sick and, with Sherlock having the sunny personality he did, every other DI in London refused to work with them.
