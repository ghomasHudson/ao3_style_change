But his heart sank once again when he heard Cas sigh and lean farther away from him, propping himself on one of his elbows as the upper half of his body fell backward.
. His posture straightened as he attempted to give his undivided attention to the the conversation that had started beside him. Based on the way real Cas was sneaking glances in his direction, he seemed to know what was going on with him and took the liberty of addressing Sam, "You said you slept well?"
crimson. His eyes unapologetically shifted to his lips, and how near they were. How soft they appeared.
But it was too late. Sam was already scrunching his nose at the giant hole in the crotch as well as the now dry and crusted substance surrounding it. He threw them back in the bag in disgust, "Dude, Gross! Seriously? In
Okay, First off I'm sooooo sorry for leaving y'all on that cliffhanger for so long. I wrote a chapter, hated it, rewrote it, hated that too, and then the third time was the charm. So here she is!
When Dean saw the room he simply nodded and when Sam saw it moments later he narrowed his eyes in confusion, “Dean, what the hell?”
Cas simply said, “No.” He didn’t even look mad, probably because he knew he’d won. Unless Dean was going to teach himself Enochian in the space of an afternoon, he wasn’t leaving.
A part of Dean felt terrible by how sadly and sincerely he said those words. But another part of him wanted to convince himself he deserved it.
It was quiet for most of the ride, Sam typed away on his keyboard and flipped through his books as Dean focused on driving.
But it didn’t stop Dean from shoving away the good and only focusing on the bad. He didn’t respond to Cas’ greeting, instead he walked past him, bumping his shoulder as he did, and headed inside the motel lobby to check in.
Sam shifted his eyes skeptically between the angel and his very not convincing brother. He then pointed at him, eyebrows lifted and head tilted, “So, you want me to leave and get my own room because you and Cas are gonna spend
Dean snapped his head up and matched his intense gaze. He felt caught off guard by his question and he didn’t have a snarky reply at the ready. So he simply looked away and started fiddling with the plastic label on the vodka before taking another swing. He was starting to become used to the burn in his chest that came with it.
. They never dared to have that conversation that blurred the line between whatever the hell their relationship was and what it could be.
, he thought as he sat up in the bed, still panting. As he looked around, he realized the room was dark, the light that he’d left on by his bed for Cas had been shut off. Not only that, he realized Cas was no longer in the room.
He mainly addressed Sam, not ready to see Cas’ reaction again because he knew it would break him for good, “Look, you’re the one who dragged me here in the first place and told me to suck it up and work this case. So, you’re going to let me out of this car, I’m going to interview whoever is left in that house, and I’m going to
Not to mention, Cas and Dean could barely look at each other—or talk about what had happened, and now he wanted to go into his mind and watch his dream front and center.
When Dean peaked open an eye, Cas was sitting next to him, beyond flustered. His gaze stayed trained on Dean regardless. His hands remained stationary in his lap, nowhere near Dean's crotch.
Dean let out almost a breath of relief. Not because he wouldn’t want to take up his offer, but because he was too tired to.
Sam deeply exhaled and remained quiet for another second more, sharing a look with Cas. When he resumed watching his brother’s slumped shoulders, which slightly leaned to right like something was bothering him on the left, he adopted a more gentle approach toward him, “Look, I know this isn’t something you want to talk about—and we don’t have to, but the only way we’re going to beat this thing is if you give us all the details.”
Dean felt his heart pounding in his ears, his questionable response left him suddenly nervous. He couldn’t help but stutter over his next words, “W-What? Just lay it on me.”
Sam shrugged, “I’ll keep looking but that’s my best guess for now. Maybe to be sure it’s not a Cupid thing, we should call Cas.”
written across it. He bit his lip as he smiled and made eye contact with him, “Very funny.” He tossed it back into the basket with the rest of them.
The sheets and corresponding blankets were bright red. The carpet below was a tasteless pink shade. The curtains and adjoining walls were black. One of the bedside tables featured a stereo, as well as an advertisement for pay-per-view erotica. A huge refrigerator, which was also pink, was more than likely fully stocked.
Sam wore a welcoming smile while Dean trailed a few inches behind him with his signature frown. He begrudgingly dragged his boots against the pavement like a child.
Cas let out a frustrated sound and continued to move forward until he was almost pressed up against Dean, he placed one hand on his shoulder and tried to speak to him in a stern tone, "Dean." Dean realized they had been in a reverse situation barely even fifthteen hours ago. Only this time, Cas was way closer than Dean had ever gotten to him. And it was at that moment he realized that this wasn’t his brightest idea.
Dean took a bite of bacon and tried to not look so startled. He watched as Sam was turning the laptop around so both of them could read something on a database he’d found, “You guys ever heard of something called a Lideric?”
I can't believe 1k people have read this! Thats probably not a lot by AO3 standards but it's a lot to my self-conscious brain lmao. Thank y'all so much. I swear it won't take me this long to update next time, which I'm hoping might be tomorrow if I consume caffeine.
Then they moved a few more feet to a different shelf displaying tree toppers. Almost all of them were shaped like stars, which is what Dean had intended on getting, but then he noticed Cas staring at the only one that broke the pattern. He was staring at the one shaped like an angel. It was a blonde woman dressed in a white gown holding a harp. She also had a halo and large white wings. He must have stared at it for at least a minute before Dean cleared his throat.
They pulled away when Dean noticed Sam and Eileen getting up from their seats and walking toward them.
This time, when Cas responded, it sounded different. His voice was gentle and soft, almost like a gasp, “Dean.”
“I think it might be what we’re dealing with. I’m thinking whatever this creature is, it feeds on sex or hormones or something like that.”
Dean began thinking through all the leads and clues he'd been given thus far. Almost all of them pointed to siren. However, sirens couldn't dream walk--or at least not the ones he'd encountered. Plus, there was another glaring piece of evidence that stood out.
"Seriously though, I'm not crazy, all of you guys heard that laugh, right?" Dean asked. The others nodded. "You think it could be a ghost, Sammy?"
"So we had powers?" Gabriel asked, looking at Sam. Sam snorted. "You could do anything you wanted with a mere thought. By human standards Cas could too but you. You were an archangel. Cas once called you the most powerful weapons heaven had to offer." "Weapon? I don't like any sort of confrontation." That got another smile out of Sam. "We know. That's why you left home to begin with." "So, what made me want to fight Lucifer?" "The fact that Dean and I caught on to the fact that you weren't a trickster. A trickster is killed by a piece of wood with the blood of a victim. We tried to kill you multiple times and it didn't take. It was Cas that pointed out that if you weren't dying, you probably weren't a trickster. That gave Dean the idea that maybe you were an angel too. I trapped you and when you tried to laugh it off Dean challenged you to walk out of the holy fire. If you had been anything but an angel you would have been able to but alas you weren't able to and you revealed yourself. I asked you which one you were and you said 'Gabriel. They call me Gabriel.' Dean called you a coward for not facing your family and that seemed to do the trick because you did. You saved us and Kali, the Hindu goddess." Sam stopped there seeing that Gabriel looked like he was about to pass out.
Dean turned, docile and properly cowed. He looked at Cas from beneath his lashes and just like that Castiel's anger fled. Instead he winked at Dean and said, "You look good submissive, Dean." Dean narrowed his eyes and opened his mouth to retort something and then thought better of it. He was Dean fucking Winchester, ladies man extraordinaire and capable of making his best friend, Castiel, blushed as he had done many times before. He needed to get it together and show Cas who was boss.
Sam felt his blood start boiling in irritation. "Cut it the fuck out, Gabriel. Just because you did us a solid doesn't mean shit when you apparently ran away afterwards. Do you even know that we lost Cas? Do you know, you know what? No, I'm not doing this with you. You obviously didn't and don't care. Just go away before Dean comes back."
"But if Gabriel is to keep his memories, won't that mean I'll keep mine too?" Again Sam shook his head. "It's easy for me to say he will because of his status. He was an archangel. There's literally nothing he couldn't do." He replied, pulling said archangel into his lap- Gabriel went without hesitation. "But you had more limitations. I don't know what will happen with you. Hey! You know what we should do? You should make a video of yourself now and talk to your angel self, in case you forget anything, you'll have the video to remind you."
Two minutes later, he had Dean breathing into a bag, hyperventilating as Gabriel called "Dean" and told him to get his ass over to the bar. After Dean had woken up a quick conversation had ensued where Dean's breath had hitched when Gabriel had nodded that yes, "Dean" did indeed have black hair and blue eyes. Everything happened quickly after that. Dean started hyperventilating when Gabriel had called his "roommate" and Sam and Dean had heard Cas's voice over the phone.
"When we were very small, our mom was killed by a demon. We grew up with our dad moving us around, hunting down all kinds of monsters, while he searched for the one who had killed her."
Dean who had quietly been drinking his beer and acquiring others spoke up then, "I take it y'all are close now?" Both Cas and Gabe nodded. "We got close because of our circumstance but even after we got to know one another as well as we could we discovered we worked quite well together. Dean has loosened up a lot since I first met him and my instinct was to prank all the rude people and he got me to calm down some." Dean and Sam exchanged glances before Dean drawled, "Well, who knew the Trickster could be trained?" Gabe's eyes widened. "Wait, Trickster? As in I did tricks on people?" Dean nodded and placed his beer down. "Yeah you could say that. You were an asshole." "Dean". Sam spoke sharply. He turned to Gabriel. "Look, you could be a bit rough but in your defense you were Gabriel, the Messenger of God and the Archangel of Justice, meaning that you meted out justice. That, combined, with Loki the Trickster, well, it could have been a lot worse." He stopped there, throwing a final glare at his brother.
Dean shook his head. "No, that's not it. It's more like we shouldn't. We don't know if more of them will come. We should be close by in case anything happens."
He knows immediately that it's the wrong thing to say as Gabriel immediately turns green and runs to the sink where they can hear him retching.
They're able to get the angel blades they possess out of Baby successfully and they're back inside the house in two shakes. Dean and Sam then show Cas and Gabe how to put up some basic warding and even though Gabe seems a little reticent about the whole thing, Sam is able to cajole him into participating. Gabriel seems a little surprised with how quickly he takes to it and Sam decides not to burst his bubble by telling him it's probably due to muscle memory. There will be much time for bursting of bubbles later.
Something clenched inside of Dean. This might not be end-verse Cas but he might as well damn be. Dean had appreciated Cas, his friend Cas for everything he had done for Dean and Sam. He left his home, his family, behind for them and then he died, killed by Lucifer himself and Dean had almost broken. He'd fallen apart and it took him a long time (and a ton of alcohol ) before he felt somewhat normal. He heart was ecstatic at seeing him again but who was he really seeing? Who was this person standing in front of him, outside of the trench coat he'd worn everywhere, the loose clothing he'd never changed, the bedhead he walked around with, nary a care in the world? Where was his Angel of The Lord?
After a beat, wherein Dean put bacon on the plates and pulled the toast from the toaster, Cas spoke up again. "So, after you dad what happened?"
Their moment was interrupted by Cas and Dean coming back, Dean complaining because he still hadn't been fed and Cas making some lewd joke about having a sausage he could eat. Sam laughed again. "That literally used to be you." He told Gabriel who mock shuddered. Sam squeezed him, enjoying the way his small body fit sp perfectly on Sam's lap, curled up into his chest. It caused a tightening in Sam's chest. Gabriel was his. He was going to fight whomever he had to for him. It didn't escape his notice that the only one he'd have to fight for Gabriel was God himself but Sam didn't care. For Gabriel he was willing to go the distance. Gabriel had never had anyone fight for him and Sam was going to change that. Gabriel deserved it.
"Chances are when you're back to being yourself you're not going to want anything to do with us. You already died once for us. You're going to be pissed that we're in your life again. Do you think that if you make a promise now, you'd be able to keep it?"
"Well," Cas finally said, "It doesn't make much of a difference if we go or not, huh? If you guys are here and you think our Father, Christ, I still can't get used to that, God is literally my dad, has a hand in it, it's probably pretty damn close to us or we're going to stumble across it one way or another, don't you think? I mean, what do you guys do for money?"
Gabriel's eyebrows went up and he looked at Sam. Sam just smiled at him. He liked this Gabriel. He was so innocent and cute. Sam couldn't wait to corrupt him.
"Why did I have more power? I'm kinda small." Sam smirked. "Yes, you are but boy do you pack a punch. You could probably destroy half if not all the world in a heartbeat. Cas once told us that his true form was the size of the Chrysler building. You told us you were ten times that." Both brothers were quiet now, eyes wide as they took it all in. Finally Gabe breathed out and asked, "and we had wings?" Sam nodded. "You had six, Cas had two. Probably because you're an archangel."
Sam leaned farther against his hands on the table, his back falling toward the wall. He raised his eyebrows and his lips parted as he seemed to contemplate Cas’ idea. He then looked between the two of them for what felt like the hundredth time, “Huh. That’s actually not the worst idea.”
The drive was only 20 minutes. Considering succibi needed to be in close proximity to it's prey in order to affect them, it made sense why the distance was short. The car wound up parked on gravel and Cas was scooping an exhausted Dean out of the passenger side when he saw the impala parked a few feet away, Sam leaned against the trunk with his arms crossed over his chest.
Dean successfully hid his grumpiness under an artificial smile as he shook the woman’s hand. She wasn’t as skilled at such action and her sadness still seeped through her greeting to him, “Hi, I’m Julia.” Her voice was low and fragile, which was more than likely normal for someone who had just lost their spouse in the most unusual of ways.
There was also Thanksgiving. Dean and Cas were working on cooking dinner—because after they’d finally won their free will after all this time they figured they deserved to do holidays right this year, Sam and Eileen were out grabbing more whiskey. Something about them cooking together felt so domestic that it made Dean’s heart flutter.
When Dean stubbornly looked outside his sideview mirror, he saw a big house distantly behind them, surrounded by cop cars and caution tape. He realized then that he found an out.
Sam went on to explain, “The combination of a dangerous occupation and a bumpy marriage would more than likely leave a person feeling emotionally vulnerable, more than the average person, at least. Many of the vics also had histories of drug or alcohol addictions.” As he told them this, Dean noticed Cas looking over at him, yet he still kept his mouth shut. He rolled his eyes and continued paying attention to Sam, “All of them also weren’t close with their families, they were either dead or abusive. Once again, I think that plays into my theory about emotional vulnerability. It’s almost like whatever is targeting this town is going off some sort of trauma checklist for picking it’s victims.” Dean was starting to strangely take offense to everything Sam was saying, because he was one of the victims now, unbeknownst to him. But, Dean had to admit everything described him perfectly.
Dean naturally moved away disappointed for what seemed like the tenth time that day. From the corner of his vision he could see Cas hopelessly trying to divert his gaze anywhere except the man on the bed beside him.
Sam and Dean were beside us and as I pulled away, they both took turns hugging Jack and saying how proud they were in their gruff Winchester way. Amara had flown Chuck away, she said that she was dropping him in a remote town where he would have to work very hard but where he could observe the beauty of earth. I did not know if he would be redeemable, after turning on his creation, but I knew what humanity had done to me, and so I decided to simply let him go. He was no longer my father, and I did not need him to suffer, I just needed him gone.
Eileen tried her best to hide her huge smile, “Sam and I are going to pick up a pizza, wanted to know if you would like some? Then maybe watch Lord of the Rings?”
Cas’s eyes fluttered and he turned over, practically burrowing into Dean’s chest, throwing his arm loosely over him.
Sam pulled his phone out of his pocket and opened the app, replying, “Where do people learn anything these days? Youtube.”
Suddenly it was too much to not be actually touching - skin to skin - and Cas pulled his hand away from Dean. The hunter let out a little whimper, and Cas kissed him gently, before hooking his fingers on either side of his waist just under the layer of sweatpants and boxers. Dean caught his unasked question and nodded, watching as Cas pulled off what was left of his clothing. Then, Cas stood and started to unbuckle his belt, his eyes racking over Dean like a man dying of thirst looking at a rushing river. Dean’s heart was pounding violently and he fought to keep his breath under control. He had never seen Cas undressed, only just a glimpse — but it was dark and there were a lot of bees — and as much as he hated admitting it, he had always wanted to. He wondered what he would look like, if his hip bones were just as prominent where they ducked under his waistband and if his skin was just as soft, just as olive-toned where the sun did not touch it - like some sort of heavenly sun-tan. When he finally stepped out of his clothing, Dean was forced to admit something to himself: he wanted him, not just because he was Cas, but because he was beautiful. He thought before maybe this feeling only applied to Cas, but he knew better, he was not indifferent to the fact that Cas was a male vessel, he loved it. The fact that it was Cas climbing on top of him, just meant that instead of simple pleasure Dean felt nirvana. They both moaned loudly as their bodies came together, their hips moving in unison so that their cocks rubbed with each thrust. Dean knew he could not last long, and he felt a little embarrassed by the depraved way his body responded to Cas’s, but there was no hope for it. They kissed fiercely and Dean reached to take Cas in his hand. Cas mimicked his motions building pressure in time with Dean. They were kissing but they were sloppily, feverish kisses, mixed with loud moans and gasps of pleasure. Finally, Cas was spilling and the sight of it sent Dean over the edge. The angel’s eyes blazed a heavenly blue before he collapsed onto Dean, unable or unwilling to move.
“Oh,” I was surprised but not shocked, it made sense, “if my grace is gone then the empty cannot take me.”
Dean knew he was fucking this up, he was hurting Cas, and he was a coward. Cas wanted him to be happy, Chuck was gone, Jack was God, and he yet he was still fighting old battles. Cas was right, he was unhappy because he was not trying to live.
Dean’s pupils went a little wider at this, but he took a deep breath. His phone buzzed on the nightstand, and he handed Cas the same sweats and shirt he had slept in before.
Dean took the beer and downed half of it in one go, feeling that now he was nervous for two reasons: a date with Cas, and eating whatever this was before him.
“I will watch over him, Castiel,” she said, reading my thoughts, “he is more powerful than my brother or I ever were, but he is still your child. I have a feeling he will teach me much more than I will teach him.”
“Yes,” she smirked at Dean’s name and my vessel went cold, “but I also know now what you were planning. If Dean was desperate enough to plan my demise, and then too desperate to go through with it, you all must be in need of another option.”
“Truth is Cas,” Dean took another exaggerated breath, “I’ve wanted to kiss you for a very long time.”
He gently began to rub little circles against Cas skin before a small smile touched his lips. Everything in the room blurred in Cas’s vision, except for the beautiful hunter and his emerald green eyes.
“What’s with you?” Claire said, opening the microwave and grimacing before pressing the thirty second button.
The empty had made a raw deal. They thought I could find happiness in this world. My child was threatened by Chuck himself, and the man I loved was always one self-sacrificing move away from death’s grip. Death had it out for him. Death had it out for all of us.
Eventually, the movie was over and Dean stood up. To Cas, the absence of his touch felt like a loss and his heart ached from it.
Finally, when he had undone the last button Dean slipped his hands over Cas’s firm shoulders and pushed the shirt down his arms. Cas shuddered and his eyes fell shut as the hunter grazed over his bare skin. Dean saw the hollow of Cas’s hip bones and his mouth began to water. He ran his fingers over them slowly, and Cas watched his vessel shivering under Dean’s teasing touch.
Sam bent down and kissed her, his eyes closing, and Dean grabbed Cas by the coat sleeve and dragged him back toward his room.
Cas really did not want to ruin this moment, he had promised not to push Dean, but his words had stung bitterly, “There is nothing I like better than being close to you, Dean… but I wish you would not say that. Your sexual orientation is of no import to me, except for as it pertains to your own self-loathing.”
Jack twisted in his seat to face him, “Dean, if you were in love with someone romantically would they be your best friend?”
Dean wanted to tell her, he suddenly ached to get the words out of his head. He was not sure if it was because she was young, or because she was gay, or because she was just there at the right time, but he opened his mouth, only to shut it again.
The next morning, not wanting to be privy to all their looks, especially after some of the noises he had heard coming from their room the night before, Sam opted for the back seat. Dean did not say a word, but his cheeks turned pink when Cas slid beside him. Halfway through the drive, Dean grabbed for Cas’s hand, and checking that Sam was not looking, he gently brushed a kiss over his knuckles before placing their joined fingers in between them on the seat. It felt so much more than good, it felt right to hold Cas’s hand.
Dean hoped his lie was convincing, but he grabbed a piece of bread and slathered it with butter. Buttered bread, he thought, would probably chase away whatever he was about to taste.
“Physically, nothing,” he answered, “But things I felt as an angel, things that were easier to ignore feel very real to me just now. My attraction to you has always seemed inconsequential considering our friendship and the things we have faced, but now I find it is very hard to ignore.”
The angel’s brow furrowed, his vessel had been through so much, it had aged more than an angel normally would have, and there were fine lines at the corners of his eyes and on his forehead. He searched Dean, trying to find an answer that would sooth the hunter, but he had lived since the beginning of time and only just found what he wanted. Once he found it, he knew he could not have it.
“So,” she began, her eyes still locked on Dean but her look turning dark, “I understand that your intention was to destroy me and my brother. Yet, you did not. I don’t pretend to misunderstand your plan, I know I was collateral damage but you were wrong, for so many reasons.”
“Dean,” Cas spoke first, breaking the tension, “I wish you would speak freely. There is no Chuck, no script, and we are alone. I know you are uncomfortable around me now, and I’ve kept my distance, but Dean, I do not understand why knowing I love you is so offensive. I know you are my friend, that’s enough. I would never ask more of you. I want you to be happy Dean. Why are you so unhappy?”
Inside the bunker bedrooms there was no natural light, so morning did not wake Dean. The day was melting into afternoon and Cas had listened to the steady sound of his breathing as he waded through the events of the previous night. He should have felt triumphant to have earned the love of this righteous man, because it was the closest to God he would ever be, but the weight of that love felt more cumbersome now that he knew what was at stake. Suffering for himself alone was no trial at all, he had become accustomed to it. Watching Dean suffer felt like tiny nicks from his angel blade all over his celestial skin.
Cas decided to go to bed, he stood up saying goodnight to Dean as he padded off toward his room. Something new settled inside him that night, something akin to disappointment but with sharper edges. He thought about their conversation as he lay in bed, waiting for sleep to overwhelm him, but his mind kept flicking back to his revelation. He supposed to humans this sort of thing would be more significant, but he was an angel — or at least an ex-angel — so it made no sense to him why people would fixate on sexuality so much. Cas felt that love and consent should be the deciding factors in these types of decisions, not genitalia. He wished he could explain it to Dean, but the conversation had made him so uncomfortable. Cas did not want that.
Finally, he asked it, the question I knew I had to answer, “What do you mean you won’t be free? What did you do, Cas?”
Cas looked up at the ceiling, and sighed, “It is difficult, because I wanted to be close to you. I wanted to earn back your trust, so I was glad, but I could not really be happy about it Dean. I wanted more, and so while I was content, no… I did not like it.”
They both climbed in, and before Dean really knew what was happening he was being spooned. He leaned into it, and Cas pressed a quick kiss against his neck. Dean fell asleep in record time.
“Oh,” Claire bit her lip, “I guess I don’t really think about it. I never had the whole suburban-repression bullshit, so I guess I didn’t care about it, and Kaia is the same.”
Cas did think about it as he made himself some toast with apricot jam, and he thought about it as he showered and put on clean clothes, and he thought about it as he went to sit outside in the fresh air. Finally, he decided two things. Firstly, he had asked Dean because he had hoped he was attracted to men also. Secondly, Dean never actually answered the question. Both of these things made Cas’s skin feel hot and his stomach do little flips. He was practically buzzing with static in his ears, which is why he did not hear the Impala pull into the bunker, or Dean walk up beside him.
“Oh yeah,” he scoffed, standing and removing his jacket, “Then why didn’t you ride out here with us?”
It was that question again, Dean could not understand why Cas kept asking it, but every time it cracked him open a little more.
He followed Dean down the hall, their hands clasped together and their breathing heavy in the silence. Dean knew he would love this angel forever as they slipped inside his room, their bodies practically thrumming with anticipation. As soon as the door closed Cas pinned him against it, kissing him with abandon. Dean had a sudden flash of forever, and he knew two things for sure: Cas would be there, and he would be doing the cooking.
The only real way to describe what happened next is that Dean went off-line. He stood in front of Cas his mouth agape, his arms heavy at his sides, unblinking and unable to move. He stood like this for what seemed like hours to Cas before he had to say something to break the tension.
“That’s all?” Cas said, slightly annoyed that Dean had seemed so flustered by a good dream, “What about?”
Next, he chose some Italian oregano from the produce section, remembering it in dried form from the video. After grabbing the penne he remembered he needed something to go in the sauce and picked up a can of mushrooms and a can of green olives. He thought the olives might have been black in the video but green matched the oregano so he thought that was the best choice. Right as he was heading toward the meat counter, he spotted a can of ground beef and chucked it in the cart. Sam had not mentioned the option of canned meat, but Cas thought it was much more efficient. He grabbed a loaf of fresh Italian bread and an apple pie from the bakery before heading to the checkout. Happy with his selections, he drove back to the bunker, determined as a soldier.
Dean took a few more steps, “And there is that. You say that like it’s easy. You said it and then you got sucked up into nothing. I couldn’t… I didn’t even…”
Cas did not need to be asked, twice, he pulled the hunter toward him by the collar and kissed him slowly but firmly. Dean pressed into him, his thigh between Cas’s legs, and deepened the kiss until Cas was panting against his lips. Dean started to unbutton Cas’s dress shirt when Cas caught him by the wrist.
“Well then we’ve got nothing, I guess.” Sam sighed. Dean was secretly hoping they would figure it out soon because he really didn’t feel like inconveniencing him with news about his dream. He was mentally praying they’d find whatever it was in plenty of time.
“Dean, please.” His brother pleaded, the desperation in his voice was evident, “For me. Just give him a half hour. A half hour, that’s all I’m asking. If after that time is up, you’re still dead set on never seeing him again, then I won’t push anymore. I’ll accept that whatever you two had is done and I won’t bring him up ever again, okay?”
During one of their spurts of childish banter, Eileen looked equally amused as she was slightly agitated at her future husband and brother-in-law. But she quickly masked her emotions with a bright, genuine smile in Cas’s direction, “You and Dean had fun today?”
“But moving on from motive, the victims all strangely had felt both incredibly horny but also lethargic a few days leading up to their deaths. Most of them were forcing their spouses to have sex multiple times a day but were sometimes too tired to even finish the job. One woman, fell asleep during it.”
At first she didn’t respond. She gave him a slight glare and her hands balled into fists on the couch. Dean knew this behavior toward loss a little too well.
Sam smirked, knowing what Cas had been getting at, "You're asking me if I had any weird sex dreams? No, I didn't. At least, not that I remember."
Dean had completely forgotten the case that had brought them to the shitty motel room in the first place. All of the victims had died from wet dreams, or at least, that’s what the headline they had read claimed. Cas had to be right, there was no way it was a coincidence that Dean just happened to have the best dream sex of his life the very moment he rolled into a town full of people experiencing the same thing. This, however, didn’t prevent Dean from drinking a second bottle of vodka.
Cas gave one long stroke up his cock, which Dean hummed in pleasure as he ground against his hand, while resuming what he'd done earlier, starting to move their hands once again. The pace was dauntingly slow but at least it was something. At least it was
The way his usual light, his spark, seemed to go out in his eyes as he said those words, ate away at him practically every second of everyday.
Cas’ pupils were dilated so large his eyes were practically black and his smile was larger than he’d ever seen it before. His cheeks were just as wet as Dean’s, “Is that a yes?”
Dean scoffed and protested his claim, "And why not? I'm a delight." His scratchy voice barely left in the sarcasm.
Real Cas was still staring bewildered at Sam before it set in that what he'd said was a joke. He gave his best attempt at a smile before looking down at his hands.
“Alright, Dean, just try to relax. Hold still.” Cas directed, his hand slowly inching toward Dean’s forehead.
"I-I can't...I...can't sleep...must be awake." Dean mumbled to himself. He grasped the sheets below him for balance.
Dean tried to stop Sam’s nighttime routine in it’s early stages, “Wait, Wait, Wait, you shouldn’t have to be forced to share a bed with me....all my snoring and tossing and turning and stuff...”
“I can’t, Dean.” Cas spoke barely above a whisper, something Dean had only heard his voice do a handful of times over the years. But unlike all the other instances, this one sounded incredibly human. Incredibly needy and plagued by sorrow. It wasn’t the usual threat or plea he’d done so
“I’ve noticed.” Cas replied with the slight hint of sass that he delivered practically every sentence with. It encouraged another smile to break out across Dean’s face.
"He's not going to hurt your brother, Cas. Sam's not like that. He thinks things through and then makes a decision he'll stick by based on that. If he says he's with short stack over there, then he is. Against my better judgment, of course."
Sam and Gabe looked at each other for a minute only to be interrupted by Cas. "Are y'all going to continue eye fucking? Because that shit is gross." Dean spewed out his beer as he simultaneously choked on it. Cas patted his back. "You choke on the smallest things Dean. You'd never be able to handle something bigger. Bummer." At that Dean turned bright red and it was Sam and Gabriel's turn to laugh. A tear leaked out of Sam's eyes and he sent a silent thank you to a God that rarely listened. He was grateful. Beyond grateful.
"You guys are more than welcome to come back to our place. Especially since y'all seem to know us and well, we don't even know us." Cas's voice broke in, deep and rumbly as ever. Dean looked at him and felt himself go red when he saw Cas wink at him and follow it up with, "What do you say, good-lookin?"
Sam glanced down at Gabriel who'd somehow found his way onto his lap once more. Sam wrapped him in a hug. "I've got to take it where I can get it. I really don't know what he's going to do when we find his grace."
Dean frowned, contemplative before agreeing. "You're probably right. But ghosts can't move around like that, they are usually tied to something. I'm sure there's a few things that can cloak themselves but the ones we primarily know of are angels." Dean and Sam both stiffened as they came upon that realization.
"I'll be there." Cas interjected, making Sam jump. He'd forgotten Cas was there, having expected him to follow Dean.
Sam was glad that his grace wasn't back yet but if looks could kill, Dean would be dead. As it stood, he never knew when to shut his mouth. "Who gives a shit about Gabriel anyway? That guy is a dick."
"Well, Sam's not like that now. He's one of the nicest people I know." Cas interjected, throwing his own glare in Dean's direction. "Anyways, Sam, damn this is going to get hard, please continue to explain why we are going to be needed again." Sam nodded. "Well, as I was saying, Raphael, the third archangel, has decided that he wants to restart the apocalypse so he's been trying to find the door to purgatory to see if Michael is there but Michael isn't there. I dragged him down with Lucifer during the Apocalypse. We don't know how Raphael doesn't know that but basically heaven is in the middle of a civil war right now. We don't want the humans getting in the middle of it again. That's what we were working on when our vacation time came up."
He watched them grab their bags and exit the front door, the red of Dean’s ear tips still visible from the back and smirked as Cas continued ribbing his brother all the way to the car, before closing the door after he watched them drive off. Sending a quick prayer to a God that mostly liked to pretend He wasn’t to keep them safe, he then did his best not to worry about his brother and the angel.
Cas strode closer to Dean and socked him right on the mouth. "He's my brother, you asshole. If anyone here is a dick, it's you. Now get out and take your bodies with you or I'm calling the FUCKING COPS!" Cas was now shouting at the top of his lungs and Sam watched a trickle of blood leave Dean's bottom lip. Normally he'd step in for his brother but a. he deserved it for talking shit and b. he currently had his arms full of clingy archangel and didn't feel like putting him down.
Sam glanced down where he could feel Gabriel's breath on his chest and felt something hitch inside him. Gabriel looked so peaceful and at rest. Sam hated to wake him up. He hated that he was going to have to bring Gabriel back to the life. Right then something changed inside Sam. He vowed to spend the rest of his days making life as easy as possible for Gabriel.
Cloaked, so that no one could see Him or feel Him, the mostly absent Father nodded to himself. He'd done good. He'd give his sons a week of vacation, of being human with their human counterparts and then He'd give them their graces back. New and improved. It was time for sweet little Cassie to get a promotion anyway. He was down two archangels, soon to be three because His son Raph was a colossal idiot but He'd found the perfect beings to replace them. Hopefully, they'd accept the mantle when He offered it to them. Dispatching the three demons He could sense headed their way He left them to get some much needed peace.
"We're still in the room, guys." Sam reminded them, sharing an eye roll with Gabriel who was pointedly not looking at his brother's dick.
Gabriel sighed. "That's a lot. I don't know if I want my grace back. It sounds like a world that I don't want to get involved in."
"...and Sam? I don't think I want my powers back. None of what you've told me sounds like fun times. Your world doesn't sound like something I want to be a part of."
Cas spoke up again. "So it's all true then? God is real? And the devil is my brother? Or is it just his brother? How does that work?" Dean took over again, starting off by giving a slight shrug. "We don't know too much. You were the closest angel to us but you weren't very open about yourself. You mostly spent your time reading my goddamn thoughts and being in my personal bubble." Cas smirked. "Have you seen yourself? I was probably in love with you." Dean choked on his beer but then he straightened and gave Cas a long glance before nodding. "Yeah, probably. I never did anything because you were a goddamn angel. I already knew I was going to hell when I died again. I wasn't going to drag you down with me." That made Sam let out a sharp gasp. His brother had never told him that. Before he could address it however, Cas spoke again, "wait, I could read thoughts?" "Could I read them too?" Gabe asked. Sam nodded. "All angels can read thoughts. Ya'll could go back in time although it took a lot out of you, Cas. You have a ton more power, Gabe so it probably wouldn't have been more than a mere thought to you. You could also change your shape, I don't know if you could do that Cas. Gabe you could snap food or anything you wanted it with a mere snap of your fingers. Cas could too, I think, but he called that abuse of his grace."
"You are, shorty. Normally I'd tell you that you not being an archangel is the best thing that could happen to humanity because I used to not like you but you did die for us and for that I'm willing to let bygones be bygones but you have to know that now that we've been here demons and angels alike will find you. We constantly have them trailing us, still trying to kill us when they get a chance and as it is you don't stand a chance. Why don't we try something different instead? Why don't you guys hang with us this week, watch us train, we'll go to a YMCA or something and spar while y'all watch, go to a shooting range and learn how to shoot and we can teach y'all the basics on how to protect yourselves and each other against demons and angels and witches and-"
Cas and Gabriel stared at them, mouths agape. "Like, together?" Cas finally asked. Dean gave his own shudder and nodded. "Yeah, it's called Wincest." "Speaking of which, there's Destiel and Sastiel too." Sam input.
Sam brushed the hair out of Gabriel's face gently before lifting his chin up so their eyes could meet. Then Sam just spoke from the heart. "Gabriel, you're so important to this world. Not just heaven, but the world. There's a whole slew of believers out there, people who count on their God and the angels to keep them safe. You didn't want to fight before and you don't want to fight now, I can understand that. But I think that even when you were the archangel Gabriel what you hated was your family fighting. There's nothing that can be done for that and I'm sorry your family got destroyed but you will have one now. You'll have Cas, Dean and me. We won't leave you to fight alone. We'll fight everything that comes our way together. I won't leave you, Gabriel. I promise. If you'll have me, I'll be with you til the end of time."
Gabriel looked into his eyes before turning to Dean. "Would I really do that?" Dean hesitated, glancing at Cas, before answering. "I don't want to be rude or mean or anything but in our experience, yes. You would. If I'm completely honest, you're a lot like me. We don't like feelings. We don't talk about feelings and someone wanting to cuddle us the way Sam is being able to do...well, I'd run the complete opposite way. As fast as I could and as an archangel, your fast, is a hella of a lot faster than mine is. You can go to any place, time, dimension, or universe that you want to. I want you to stay, too. If not for Sam, for Cas. But I don't think you will. I really don't think you will. And Gabe, that's my baby brother. And I'll be left to pick up the pieces. It'll be Jess all over again."
Then again, the thought was futile considering it was Gabe, not Chuck, who'd chosen his vessel and he'd definitely not done it with Sam in mind so...
Gabriel shook his head as he tilted his head up to look at Sam, eyes wide. "We met them together. We were at the bar and they came up to us. Not to be crude but I think I have a size kink. I tend to go for the tall ones. Dean-I mean Cas- tends to like them with freckles or green eyes. I guess now we understand why. Poor Milo and Rigo. I wonder what their families think happen to them."
“Great. I’ll be drinking douchebag beer.” Dean grumbled but he fooled no one. The smile on his face spoke volumes. Cas just gave him a smile before looking at him up and down and saying, “you sure look good in anything, Dean. Maybe sometime I can see your birthday suit?”
Neither Dean nor Sam said a single word on the way to Cas and Gabe's apartment, both of them were too stunned to speak. Cas was calling himself Dean, Gabriel was calling himself Sam, they were with people that looked like Dean and Sam and they didn't look like the Cas and Gabe that Dean and Sam had known. What the fuck was going on? Sam's eyes roved over to see his brother with his jaw clenched and white knuckling the steering wheel. Sam wanted to say something but he knew Dean didn't want to hear it. As it was, he was hanging by a thread and he was going to need that to remain calm as they talked to Cas and Gabe. Dean didn't do well with change and although Sam had seen the look of appreciation cross Dean's face when he got a gander of the new and improved Cas, Sam also knew that it had disrupted Dean's psyche to be hit on by said new and improved Cas, so yeah, he knew better than to try to give Dean a bone right then. He'd get his head and hand bitten off.
"You want another?" Gabe asked him and Dean, getting up. "Sure, thank you, short-stack." Dean replied easily. Gabriel turned to him with narrowed eyes. "Height jokes?" Dean put up a placating hand. "I used to call you that and it never bothered you because as you would say, hellllo, archangel. And I'm just a mud monkey." "A what?!" asked Castiel. "When we first met angels they used to call us apes or mud monkeys." Dean responded. Gabriel huffed. "Well, that's just rude." He said, placing the beers in the middle of the table. Dean shrugged, "True. Cas here killed him. I killed the other asshole."
"So then what happened, Sammy? What'd they leave behind?" asked Gabriel settling back into his chair.
"Hell no, Sammy here kicks in his sleep. Not to mention he starfishes AND he turns cuddly to boot. I do NOT want to wake up with my hands full of Sammy. I might catch his cooties. He and Gabriel have that cuddly shit in common, it seems. They should bunk together." Dean smirked pointedly at Sam who threw him one of his many bitch faces.
The boys were quiet for a few minutes as they ate before Gabriel spoke up. "You know, that kinda makes sense."
Gabriel caught their look but misinterpreted it. He didn't know they were shocked at his laid back vernacular. He thought it was the "bro" that had thrown them off and he quickly explained, "We're not really brothers but since neither of us remember anything past the four years we eventually moved in together and have been roommates every since."
It started out with one soft kiss placed at Gabriel's temple. Then Sam went behind the ear. Then the neck. When he gave it a little bite, Gabriel moved his head back, exposing more of his neck and Sam went to work, nipping, sucking and kissing.
"Thanks for the food, guys." Sam told Cas and Dean who waved away his thanks. "No problem, Sammy. You kinda had your hands full after all." Dean smirked.
"Just like that?" Cas's eyes narrowed at him. Sam nodded, putting butter on his toast. "Just like that."
"He..." Cas sighs. "It's different right now because now I know we're brothers, but before..it was still like that. I took care of him when he couldn't handle being alive. He was depressed, severely depressed for over a year. After I found him standing with all the pills in the palm of his hand, he just-I just-," Cas voice breaks and he squeezes his eyes shut, face lifted upward, his hands digging into his hips. "He promised me to never again so much as open the bottles until the day he knew he could do it without having to fight the urge to take them all. It's been a year and a half since then. And it's been a year since he weaned himself off the meds. He'd been doing better. We'd been doing better. I guess today was just too much."
Whatever Sam expected Cas to say it wasn't that but he'd be lying if he said he didn't hope Cas meant everything he'd said. He liked this Cas better than the other one. This one had backbone and a spine where the other one had been loyal to Dean to a fault. He was mildly surprised by how pleased he was that Gabriel had someone staunchly in his corner.
"Not to mention he was an alcoholic. Rarely left us enough money for food and left us in motels for days on end when we were too fucking small."
Sam would apologize but Gabriel doesn't give him a chance, instead he goes to the fridge and pulls out two pill bottles, handing them to Cas who shakes one out of each bottle and hands them to him. He dry swallows, lets Cas hold him for a couple minutes before exiting the kitchen. A moment later, Sam hears the tell-tale sound of a door opening and closing.
big s/o to iceman12 for not only giving this story the time of day but for caring enough about it to remind me it existed, lol. I promised a chapter update this weekend and as usual I'm pushing it what with it being 9:38pm CT (on Sunday) already but hopefully they enjoy the chapter anyway.
It momentarily makes him sad that he can't offer Gabriel a different life. He wishes he could. He wishes he and Dean had met Cas and Gabriel in some other universe where there weren't mentions of anything unnatural and Sam and he could have led long happy lives, maybe adopting some rugrats, maybe they would just be cool uncles to Dean and Cas's kids. Either one would have been just fine with him. Still...
Sam shook his head, sadly. "You'll want to be, maybe, but you've always been Dean's angel. Everyone knew that. You use to call me an abomination. By the time you died, you were tolerant of me but in no way, shape or form, loyal to me like you were Dean. Sometimes all he had to do was look at the ceiling and you'd arrive. Meanwhile when I prayed to you you'd ignore me. You said it was because you and Dean had a 'profound bond'."
"Our dad had disappeared and I was worried." Dean took over the story, handing out the plates. Including syrup, powdered sugar and whipped cream to Gabriel who looked at him in surprise. "What? You had a massive sweet tooth even back then."
Afterwards, they were going to Heim, a barbecue place that Cas had suggested. “It’s an actual restaurant?” Dean asked, his face scrunched up. They were hunters, accustomed to dive bars and petrol station “food”.
Sam took the time that it took Cas to get there to study the small man in front of him. He always felt bad that the archangel had to die. But apparently had been brought back not too long after. And now, after four years, was being reunited with them. Why? Sam didn't believe in coincidences, he knew that if the archangel and the seraph had been placed in their paths again it was because something big was afoot and, hell, God probably had a hand in this. Which meant two things: one, that their grace had to be out there, otherwise what good would they do? and two: they apparently belonged to Sam and Dean, otherwise why would their instincts have had them choice their names out of all names out there? "Sam" he almost understood, it was a common name, but "Dean"? No, if anything, this meant that God had a sense of humor and had decided that Cas belonged with Dean and Gabriel with him. But why? Why Gabriel? He had tortured Sam over and over again and even by the time he died for them by standing up to Lucifer, Sam still hadn't been sure he'd forgiven him.
Sam and everyone else stops what they're doing to stare at Gabriel. "Maybe our proximity is making your memories come back faster? For unknown reasons?" Sam asks.
Sam shook his head as he realized Milo was responding. "..course you are. Who doesn't know of the famous Winchester brother's that let our king out of hell but then threw him back in?"
“A Holocaust Museum? That doesn’t sound like fun.” Dean pouted. “Mm. It is actually; besides I feel like you could use the reminder that humans can be monsters too. Annnnd-” He interjected quickly, “You’ll love The Love Shack. It’s all an outdoor burger joint and we can sit on the second floor. And their beer is local and fucking good.”
"You know, we don't know. What I can tell you is that you can probably maintain them just by directing your grace to leave them alone."
"Look." He started. He stopped and then started again. This was going to be hard. He was trying to find a way to give it to them gently but there was no way to do it. Better to just rip off the band-aid. "Here's the thing. Gabriel, back when you were in heaven, from what you've told us, you were happy. Once, you mentioned that you'd taught Cas here how to fly. But then your brothers, y'alls brothers, Michael, the eldest, and Lucifer, the second born started fighting and you couldn't take it so you left heaven and entered a witness protection program. I'm not entirely sure what that entailed, that's simply what you told us. You became Loki, a pagan god." Here Sam stopped to take a sip of his beer. Gabriel was staring at him, mouth agape before straightening and asking, "is that even allowed?" Sam shrugged in response. "We have no idea. We didn't know you that well. The extent of our knowledge of you is based on approximately four, or maybe five, times we met you. Loki, as you know, well, I don't know if you know, but he was the trickster. You played awful tricks on me and Dean. You turned me into a car, you gave me herpes, you kneed me in the balls, you killed Dean in front of me over a hundred times BUT", Sam quickly went on saying, seeing the tears filling Gabriel's eyes again, "When the Apocalypse came, you also died for us. You got stabbed by Lucifer, your brother."
"That doesn't mean I want to watch, bitch. Besides, that's Gabriel. As soon as he remembers his ass is going to bounce away from us so fast it'll make our heads spin. Are you sure about this Sam?" His brother asked, dropping all pretense and asking him seriously,  spatula held in one hand.
"Wait. Did you say his name was Dean?" Sam nodded and Gabriel looked at Dean with wide eyes. "When I-when I got here, I didn't get here alone." He said in a rush, almost tripping over his words in an effort to get them out. "I mean I did but then I found someone that someone else told me about and he doesn't have any memory either. He calls himself Dean." Sam watched the blood drain from Dean's face and he had to stand and catch Dean as he fainted.
He sauntered up to them and tossed a "what's up, bro?" at Gabriel that had both brother's glancing at each other in shock. What the hell?
Dean was back by then and the four of them walked out of the bar and got into both cars, the Impala and an old Mercedes two door that Cas had rolled up in. "Hold on," Cas muttered before walking over to his car and saying "Get out." to whomever was inside.
"What happened to Milo and Rigo?" Gabriel asked softly. "Why were their eyes black? Were they...?" He trailed off, eyes glassy, like he couldn't believe he'd actually seen it.
"They'll probably eat each other then. Seems like a match made in heaven. Speaking of heaven, I'm sorry I feel asleep during your story telling. It's been a long day."
Dean threw his hands up and muttered something under his breath about Gabriel already being a bad influence.
By the time he was done, Cas was a lovely shade of red as he just stood there. "Hey Cas?" Dean asked lazily, pointedly staring at Cas's mouth watching as it turned into a pretty "o" shape. Dean didn't wait for Cas to respond, rather he lifted his gaze to meet Cas's eyes and said, "You look good submissive Cas. And for the record, I don't have a gag reflex."
Gabriel looked at him. Sam averted his eyes, a blush covering him from neck to hairline. He didn't want to sound needy but...
"We have a bunch of fake id's too since we have to pose as FBI, police, CSI, sheriff's and a slew of other things." Sam inserted again, trying his hardest not to laugh.
"In the beginning, as we told you we were predestined to become Michael and Lucifer incarnate. Our lives were led to one goal, becoming vessels for them. So Sam here was supposed to die, I was supposed to go to a demon to make a deal and I was supposed to go to hell. I did all of that. The demon offered me one year in return for Sam's life and I took the deal. When the time was almost up for me, Gabriel here stuck Sam in a time loop, reliving each day as Tuesday and every day I died. It was supposed to be so that Sam could learn how to live without me once I was gone but Sam didn't learn so Gabriel returned me. Once I was hauled off to hell, a demon became Sam's friend, pretending that she was trying to help and she got him addicted to demon blood. See, when our mom was killed it was because she was trying to save Sam from a demon who was putting demon blood down his throat. The demon blood gave Sammy powers, not right away, but they materialized around the time I went to hell. With the demon blood he became stronger. That's what Gabe was trying to prevent, he just had a lousy way of telling us. He should have just told us instead of going about it the way he did. Anyway, the angels did their best at separating us and it sorta worked. I was working with Cas and Sam was still working with that demon bitch, Ruby. It'll all came down to head when Ruby had Sam kill the bitch who owned my hell contract, Lilith. The thing we didn't find out until Cas rebelled and told me the truth was that Ruby was working on Lucifer's side. She was working for Lilith and Lilith was the final seal that needed to break in order for Lucifer to be released."
Dean laughed. "This and that." Cas narrowed his eyes at him. "Well, we're not strippers or anything but basically we hustle pool and play cards."
"We have a few angel blades, the only thing that can kill one, one of them is yours by the way, but they are out in the car. We're going to go get them and you're coming with us because we don't want anything to take you while we're not here."
With every sober moment that passed Dean was regretting it, the second the alcohol was gone the anxiety set in ten-fold. He had wanted to kiss Cas as an experiment, but that was not fair. Cas was no experiment, he was one of the most important beings in the universe. His heart sank with guilt.
He looked at me questioningly, and I nodded, hoping that if he continued I would be able to thread together his meaning.
“So, Dean told me about your deal… with the empty,” I could not read Sam like I could Dean, but his distress was apparent.
Dean was caught in Castiel’s gaze. Eyes that he knew so well once again searching him and Dean felt exposed, as if he stood naked in front of him. He was stuck, though, unable to unglue his green eyes from the angel’s blue ones. His heart started to thunder in his chest, and his fingers were tingling with anxiety.
“I don’t know Dean, but it cannot be this. Jack is a child,” He’s our child, is what I longed to say, but I could not bear it if Dean rejected that sentiment. He had forgiven Jack, and he had warmed to him, but things were not as they should be. It broke me to see how hard Jack tried to be close to Dean. Lately, it seemed possible...
Dean shifted forward in his seat, and I felt my heart ache to pull him back, to protect him from Amara. Or, perhaps to protect myself from the possibility that he could be drawn to her once more. “What do you mean?”
Dean wanted to interject, but his mouth was still so dry, he took a sip of whiskey but it was too late, Jack was already speaking.
“You looking for me, sunshine?” Dean’s voice had come from behind me, and I swiveled to see him smirking, beer in hand.
Cas had not meant it to come out so harsh, but he had watched Dean from the shadows for months and his life had become a steady routine of fighting too hard, drinking too much, and sleeping too little. When Jack had come back to the bunker a few days after stopping Chuck, Cas had been by his side. The empty had traded Cas for a promise at eternal sleep which Jack had granted. For the first time since he had dragged Dean out of hell he felt his full power again, and although he was saddened at the burden placed on Jack’s shoulders he very quickly realized that Jack’s humanity made him the best possible steward of the power he possessed. Jack wanted to watch over his family, but to interfere as little as possible. There was a simplicity in Jack’s plan, and Cas was confident in his son. So, when he appeared in the bunker with Jack it had nearly broken him to see Dean, halfway through a bottle, passed out over the kitchen table. He had carried him to his room and watched over him through a fitful night sleep.
In the back of his mind there was a conversation that had been ongoing since Cas was taken. It was a conversation about why Dean was so unhappy. It was a conversation about why he did not trust himself. It was a conversation about an argument he had been having with himself ever since he was fifteen years old.
“Breakfast of champions,” he said to Cas, who was standing by the entrance to the bunker kitchen, surreptitiously running his eyes over everything but Dean, “Day off, we are hanging out in the Dean cave.”
Cas rolled his eyes, “Dean, somehow, I am going to try and un-teach you all the things you have learned that are so wrong. Everyone needs comfort, everyone. It was the first thing I noticed as my time with humanity made me more and more human myself. I needed contact, comfort, and even just a simple touch otherwise I felt like I was crumbling under the weight and responsibility of all the things we’ve been fighting. Anytime you wrapped your arms around me, however briefly, the burden seemed more bearable. Also, Dean, little boys and little girls need to be loved in equal measure, affection is not gendered.”
“Yeah,” Dean held up his badge, “Detective Townsend and this is my partner Detective Daltry. We were looking wondering if you knew this man,” Dean showed her a photo of the victims missing cousin, “heard he had been seen around here, and he had been missing for quite a while.”
Dean sat his coffee down rather harshly on the table, some of the contents splashing over his hand and onto the wood, “You don’t let things go do you?”
“Yes,” he smirked, “They did not seem to recognize our presence once they were kissing. I can relate.”
Dean was silent. His silence was more frightening to me than his blustering anger. Anger ebbed and flowed, it had legs, silence was a heavy limbless thing that I could not move. He took another step forward so close now that I could count the freckles across his nose and cheekbones.
Dean set his glass down and racked his hand across his face a few times and then ran his fingers through his hair. He had no idea where to begin.
Dean swallowed hard, he did not know whether to grimace or ignore the comment all together. His only consideration was which course would lead Sam off of this path of conversation.
Dean pulled away from the kiss, his breath hitching and pushed Cas’s coat and jacket to the ground. He grabbed at the loose knot on his tie and pulled it over Cas’s head until he was standing in his dress shirt and slacks. Dean splayed his hands across Cas’s chest taking in the feel of his muscle and the warmth of his skin just under the surface. Then, he looked at Cas and began unbuttoning his shirt purposely and painfully slowly.
Dean had often wondered why he had been forced to live his worst nightmares over and over again. He had lost everyone and everything he loved so many times he could no longer remember what it felt like to be without loss.
“When Jack was dying, I made that deal with the empty to save him, and I felt like I had won because I always wondered what it could be? How could I be happy?.”
Claire grabbed another handful of popcorn, “How about because you’re a bisexual dude in his forties asking a twenty-something lesbian to give you newbie gay advice. Just figure it out man. No one cares, honestly, and the people who do are not worth your fucking breath.”
Cas tilted his head in confusion, “I am saying that the Empty took me because I found true happiness in telling Dean how I felt. I love him Sam.”
Dean just shook his head a little, too overwhelmed to speak, he felt the knot of fear in his abdomen release a little bit. He had been put on the rack, he had watched the world burn, been a play thing for God and the Devil, and through it all he never really felt like he was worth a damn. Cas was the only one who told him, as many times and in as many ways as he could that he was important, that he was worth loving, and that he was worth saving. Losing him had felt like dying more than any real death ever had, it was worse. So, he had pushed himself the only way he knew how and the only way that his father had ever taught, he hunted monsters and took risks and kept his insides together with sarcasm and hard liquor.
Cas froze, he had seen Dean in the morning before, many times in fact, but never in the bunker, never in Dean’s own room, and never after holding him the way he had the night before. Dean smirked at him, yawning a bit into his fist.
Dean’s face went red, “Oh god, no, no I mean, the gay… the being gay part. The being out in the open part?”
Cas felt as hurt as if Dean had slashed him with his angel blade, “How can you say that? I saved you because I love you Dean.”
After quickly drying off with the world’s most scratchy bath towel and pulling on his sweatpants and t-shirt, Dean opened the door to the bedroom. Cas was still sitting in the little chair, reading something on his phone. Dean laughed a little at the idea of the angel having a cell phone, but he knew better: angels, demons, and monsters all had phones. Demons took particular pleasure from trolling people on twitter and tumblr, and Dean was sure that a few deals had been made over Facebook.
“There is a human word Cas, it’s a word I would never fucking say but my Dad said it, and he called me it a few times when I didn’t get in line. He called me that when I cried, and then sometimes he’d just hit me.”
For years I sat at his bedside. At first when he was in my charge it was in musty motel rooms and he did not know I was there to watch over him. Later, because I rebelled it was those same motels but he knew I was there, and he hated when I hovered. Over the years, he came to tolerate my presence as he slept, he only barred the door from me after his mother died. He blamed me, and I understood that, yet I tried the door and found it had been latched. I pressed my forehead against the frame. I was grieving as well.
This should have worked, Cas normally did not push. More often than not, Dean abused that, knowing he could take out his frustrations on his friend and they would just push past it. This time, however, Cas was holding his arm with heavenly strength, unwilling to look away.
“Hey, ma— Cas,” he tilted his head back and sighed, then let his eyes fall to meet mine once more, “Can we talk?”
“You two are honestly too cute, what an attractive couple!” Donna added her dimples on full display.
Dean looked up, and pulled Cas against him in a desperate hug, his breath becoming even. He leaned his head against Cas’s neck, just as he had done the morning he had come back with Jack, the morning he had almost told him everything in his relief from the anguish that buried him. Their bodies were close, thrumming with realization, and neither of them had the strength to retreat. So, they stayed like that for a long time, just holding on for dear life.
“Thanks,” Sam said, “It's weird, I have just been so tired, I sleep and it's like my mind is just blank and I don’t even feel that rested… but last night I got a solid six hours and I feel good. I think I’ll maybe go for a light jog.”
His eyes seemed to mainly focus on the bed. The only bed. It was a queen, which seemed like a substitute for two twins.
Before he could interrogate him about it, Sam was fleeing the room. Dean felt like his sudden rapid departure out the door confirmed Dean’s previous thought.
Please leave me kudos and comments if you liked what you read. And if you didn't......I guess you can yell at me, no hard feelings.
, he’d tell himself from time to time when he felt the ring he’d bought months ago burning a hole in his back pocket. He always had it on him, contemplating when the right moment was. If there was ever going to be a right moment.
Dean finally felt his boner disappear, he removed his hands from his crotch and folded his arms over his chest, “Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn’t have put me under in the first place.”
“Great….lets start looking into that.” Sam was grabbing his duffle bag off the floor and searching for his laptop.
But Dean was already stomping away toward the older woman, which left Cas to interview the child and Sam to scope around some more.
His eyes rolled to the back of his head as he climaxed. His palm hugged his neck tighter and his other hand moved swiftly against the bulge in his pants, working him through his release. His boxers, which were still slightly wet from earlier, became soaked with cum again. This time, Dean could feel the dampness all the way through the thick material of his jeans.
“You’re allowed to reject me. I shouldn’t be giving you shit.” Dean mumbled sadly. Yet, this was more progress they’d made in—well, ever.
Dean sat back up and covered his face with his hands, mentally cursing himself out for not being able to tell the obvious difference between real Cas and not. He stuttered over his apology, “S-Sorry. Shit, I didn’t mean to—“
They’d both be at the back pushing at the trunk while the brothers pulled at the top. Anyime Sam started a new argument with
. Meanwhile, Eileen and Sam were more than entertained by the scene in front of them. The both of them covered their smirks with their palms. The older Winchester groaned in annoyance, “Fine, but just take the ornament, Cas.”
Both Cas and Sam looked at him confused. Sam suddenly pushed his laptop aside to join the pile of uneaten food. His eyes narrowed at his brother, "He didn't say anything...."
“You’re looking for forgiveness, Cas. But I-I just can’t. What you did.......I’m having trouble just shaking that off like it’s nothing. Because it’s not. I don’t let myself get close to a lot of people. Because they always either get hurt, or they hurt me. B-But you were one of my few exceptions.......I trusted you. I trusted you to tell me if there was something wrong with Jack and you just......” Then words got too much for Dean so he opened a fourth tiny vodka.
Before Cas could get more questions in about his dream, Sam was unlocking the door of the motel room and stepping inside, the spell clearly not being bothersome to him. He immediately tossed his keys on the table while looking around at the sight in front of him. He saw Dean sitting a million miles away from Cas, as well as, the pile of empty bottles by his feet, and assumed the worst, “Dean, would it have killed you to at least try?”
After Sam and Cas shared a look of concern—and a hint of irritation, at each other, they headed toward the house.
In an instant, Dean could care less about how fragile the ceramic was. He was suddenly holding the ring and letting everything else fall to the floor. The amount of shock that hit him was immeasurable; no monster or human alike had ever left him in such a state of stunned silence. All of the planning and endless worrying, felt like it was for nothing. But at the same time, felt like it was for everything. That it was all the perfect buildup to this very moment. That maybe all of the times he wanted to propose but stopped, was because somewhere in his subconscious, he knew he was meant to get proposed
“Well.......” He pursed his lips and seemed like he didn’t know how to explain his thoughts to him. He tried anyway, “It’s evident that whatever is plaguing this town, is now affecting you, as well.”
Sam was lecturing him about who knows what beside him when Dean turned to frantically grab at the handle, preparing his escape. Unfortunately, the sound of Sam clicking the doors locked rattled through the car before he could push it open. He still refused to go down without a fight, unlocking the doors with the button on his side and going for the handle yet again. However, Sam beat him to the lock button for the second time.
He then cut to the chase, “All of the victims were not happily married. Wether it was cheating, money issues, bad sex, or just fighting in general, all of them had their issues. The spouses were all pretty open about it too, which tells me this was something that had been happening for awhile. I think maybe all of them were gearing up for divorce. Also, all the vics had dangerous jobs. Two were cops, one woman served in the army, another was a firefighter, a pilot, a bodyguard, and one of the husbands basically implied her wife was apart of the mafia.”
Dean and Cas finally got together the very second he’d come back from the Empty. When he reunited with them while they were on a hunt gone awry. The very second he saved Dean’s life. Again. Dean was kissing and hugging him before his grace even finished healing his wound.
In these short five minutes, Dean knew it wasn’t friendship. Whatever the hell their relationship was, was anything but friendly. And suddenly he craved clarity. More than he had in twelve years. He craved Cas. The
Bit of a spoiler, but this man will get justice, because violence toward the queer community is nothing to blow past.
A few moments passed before Sam finally continued, “By the way, I know that’s what took Cas to the empty. I know what he told you, and man, please stop blaming yourself. That was Cas’s choice.”
“Oh man, no… just, no. We are not talking about Dean’s sex life. I get enough of that crap from him.”
He looked at Sam out of the corner of his eye before fixing his gaze back in the road, “Are you serious Sam. You… you would be cool… I mean… you think I…”
“Okay. Yeah… good talk,” he said quickly rising and clearing away our plates. I stood as well as was about to suggest we watch a movie when I was suddenly in his arms. His lips were moving against mine and I felt so human for a moment that I could not respond. My brain and body were screaming for me to move but I was too busy screaming back I AM KISSING DEAN WINCHESTER, to make my muscles react.
Dean could feel the blood rising in this neck and his cheeks were hot with embarrassment, “It wasn’t like that… nothing... basically nothing happened.”
“I’m unhappy because I don’t know what to do about you and me. I lost you Cas, right after you said… right after. I’m unhappy because I’m broken. I’m unhappy because I’m fucking terrified. I thought free will would feel so good, but I feel more trapped than ever. Just… tell me what you want from me, man.”
“Uh, first off,” Sam shook his head, “calling me Samantha stopped working about a decade ago, get a new schtick. Secondly, I have been an unwilling third wheel of your relationship with Cas for a long time. Thirdly, Eileen told me she caught you two making out.”
I wanted to use my strength, the last true remnant of my fading angelic power to smash my fists against the dungeon walls, beat the bricks into dust. Instead, I looked into his eyes, knowing it was time to come clean, “I will not be free Dean, and if we go through with this, Jack will never be free.”
At that Dean shot out of bed, pressing the colt in the waistband of his jeans before heading quickly down the hallway. I followed close behind, stupidly hoping that Dean’s “bond” with Amara was no longer at work, and yet knowing that it was why she was here at all.
“Hello, Dear,” Amara’s mouth perked up on one side and she gestured for Dean to join Jack and Sam who were already seated at the table. I chose to remain standing; even a fallen angel of the garrison does not sit easily in her presence.
When he got to the cave, Dean was sitting on the large sofa in front of the tv, he eyed Cas and his lips twitched for a moment, before breaking into an irrepressible smile. He loved the way Cas looked in his clothes, and a little shiver passed through him at the sight.
Dean looked down defeated, Cas had clearly hit a nerve, “Cas, there are things I hide. I have to… for Sammy… for all of us, but I promise, last night has nothing to do with anything secret. God, it wasn’t even bad.”
“Sorry,” she corrected, “I just mean, I see how you guys are with each other. You’ve got this like a short-hand with one another, and the way you look at each other sometimes really makes me want to puke.”
Dean let out a little laugh, shifting uncomfortably, “Nah, man, I was kidding. I think he’s just in his room, he’s been sleeping a lot, and researching… the trials, they… well they really took it out of him.”
“Well,” Sam laughed again, grabbing a beer and looking at his brother with a smug expression, “did you hear that Dean? He used clues and evidence to figure it out.”
“It will be nice to see everyone together, and we have enough rooms here,” he said when Dean gave him a little side-eye.
“Fuck it, I’m going to try again,” Dean said against Cas’s lips before covering them in a soft kiss.
Dean felt stunned, for the second time that night he had managed to make Cas angry when he was only trying to tell him the truth. He put his hands up defensively and then pointed at the seat where Cas had been sitting. Cas rolled his eyes again, even more dramatically than before, and sat back down.
Dean hopped off the bed, a bright flush covering his cheeks, he tapped on Eileen’s shoulder and got her attention before speaking, “No problem, what can we do for you?”
That morning when Dean opened his eyes, Cas was there, waiting to greet the hunter. Dean had shot up in the bed, pulling his gun from under the pillow and pointing it right at the angel’s temple. Cas should have expected this, Dean would never trust anything good.
I caught up to him and watched as he assembled a Turkey club for both of us with a side of chips and a tall glass of water. We ate in relative silence but I kept looking up to find his eyes already trained on me.
Cas tasted all the food, but declared that he only liked the jam and biscuit because it had the least objectionable texture. Dean laughed and rubbed his back as they sat down beside one another. When the looked up he noticed Jody smiling at him her eyes glinting knowingly, and he was not sure if it was the adrenaline from his morning declaration, the fond way that Cas had watched him cook breakfast, or the fact that they were all sitting and enjoying a meal without the apocalypse or death or lucifer or Chuck himself trying to break down the door, but he felt like this was step two.
Sam was watching Cas, and angel of the lord, unravel before him. If it was not so sweet, it would have been hysterical. As it was, he really did want to help, so he thought for a moment.
It was Cas who broke it first, “Pie?” He asked Dean, confusion in his voice and his pupils wide with lust.
“Cas,” he said, looking down, “I’m not disgusted, man. It’s just, there are things… It is not easy for me, Cas. I don’t know what to trust. All these things… and you saw that woman. I don’t know…”
Their eyes locked in that familiar way, like a game of chicken to see who could avert their gaze first.
“Dean,” he said leaning toward the hunter slightly, “there is nothing to do. Live your life, find peace, make a family. You tried once, with Lisa, try again. Just try Dean.”
Claire pushed herself forward off the counter where she had been leaning and rolled her eyes again, “Okay, well, good talk Dean.”
“So, looks pretty cut and dry. I guess there used to be a few wolves there that got cleared out a while back by few other hunters, but one must have slipped through because hearts started being ripped out last week. Two vics so far, and a lead on where to look.”
There was something so earnest in Cas’s words that Dean could not scoff at then, or sarcastically quip, he could not even pretend to be modest or off-put, he could only take breath after shallow breath as his pulse quickened. He was not in control, he felt a lovely warmth spreading over his chest, and he could not stop from stepping toward Cas so that their chests were actually touching. Dean loved the way Cas looked in this moment, his eyes closed and lips parted the moment they came into contact, like a needy confession written all over his face. He took a shaky breath, leaning forward.
Dean laughed in spite of himself, “Yeah, I do, but I guess some stuff is hard wired in. Good or bad.”
Sam smirked despite himself, “Yeah, I know you do Cas. Dean just never told me that is why it took you.”
After a few more minutes Cas took their empty containers and threw them in the trash before bringing them both a fresh beer.
After they checked in Dean went out and picked up burritos and they ate them on their beds while watching some show called Dr. Sexy M.D. that Dean seemed to like.
At hearing his full name, the angel pressed harder into Dean, his lips wild and feral against him. Dean could not help the groan that escaped. He slid his hands under Cas’s layers of trench coat and jacket until his hands pressed firmly against his waist. Dean wanted so much more but he was drowning in the feel of Cas; the weight of his arms, the firmness of his chest, and the angelic strength that corded through his muscles.
“No,” Dean said, stopping me, his hands out in a defensive way, “please stay there. I want to tell you some shit, and I just need you to stay sitting right there.”
For a moment, Cas was still, eyes wide and mouth slightly agape. Slowly though, he began to feel uneasy. He may not understand human emotions but he had been inebriated before and he knew that it dulled your decision making faculties. Dean was watching him, and Cas felt like he had to escape.
Everyone was frozen, Dean with embarrassment, Sam with amusement, Jack with confusion and Cas with fondness.
The answering smile on Cas’s face made Dean weak. It softened the edges of the moment and pressed him forward. That smile was the reason Dean leaned across the table, closing the distance between them. It was the reason he felt brave enough to press his lips lightly against Castiel’s. It was just a moment of contact, and it was much more chaste than Dean had imagined, but a feeling of want spiraled through him like smoke as he pulled away. They both felt their lips burn from the kiss, and Dean’s heart beat out an unsteady rhythm beneath his t-shirt. Cas looked bewildered, and it was so gorgeous that Dean almost leaned back toward him, but instead he flattened himself in his seat and took another sip of beer, suddenly jittery.
Dean scowled as a reply. He was a little annoyed, but he was also glad that Cas would be with them. He was an asset on any hunt, of course, but that was not the reason. Dean started to undo his belt, but when he glanced up at Cas innocently observing him, and he felt instantly embarrassed. He had changed in front of Cas before, and he knew Cas had seen him in all his glory anyway as he had been the one to put him back back together after he had been on the rack. There was no denying though, it was different now: fraught with meaning.
Cas knew that Dean had nightmares, when he was an angel he had tried to soothe him, and now that they shared the bunker he would sometimes hear Dean’s sleepy cries as he passed his room at night. It hurt him to know that he could not help the hunter.
“Not a bad start,” Dean shot Sammy a confident look, they had taken on a lot more with a lot less to go on.
“We can afford it Dean, plus…” Sam grabbed his bag from Dean’s grip, “Cas will be here soon, and I figured you two would have more… talking to do.”
Dean was sitting on the opposite side of the room from Cas. Claire and Kaia had arrived about a half hour before, muddy and blood-stained from a vamp hunt just outside Oklahoma City.
“See,” Jack said turning to Sam, “I told you. Clues and evidence, those dad’s are in love. I’m a good hunter.”
“Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,” they both turned to see Tessa, the brunette, standing by the bar entrance, taking a long drag from her cigarette. She was watching Cas and Dean with a satisfied expression, “You could have just said you were gay, ya know. Would have saved me the disappointment.”
When they were safely inside Dean placed a quick, chaste kiss on the angel’s lips and started to change into his hotdog sleep pants, and a hoodie. The entire time Cas was standing watching Dean, the same bewildered look on his face. Dean was stifling a laugh when he turned and put on his most innocent expression.
Dean raked his hands across his face again, he hated this, he did not want to talk about it  — the ulcerative thing inside him — but here was Cas who had saved him again and again, and he was asking.
Sam thought he should probably walk away, he knew Dean would not want him to see this, but he found himself stuck in place. Sam did not need to know why Dean was crying, or why he was falling apart, he was just weirdly grateful for it. No one buried things deeper than Dean. Dean who had taught him to lie about how you felt, bury everything with a drink, and Dean who had stuck around to bear his father’s abuse until the bitter end. Sam had opened up to Eileen, and he had spent time in her arms, letting himself feel everything he had been taught not to feel, but he knew that compared to his brother, he was the poster boy for mental health. Cas finally looked up, and Sam simply nodded before turning and closing the door behind him.
When Dean did not speak I looked up and saw that he was working it out in his head, once again piecing together even what I did not say. That is when his eyes flicked the bandage on my neck.
Cas looked up and he was so warm and disheveled that Dean felt like it was practically pornographic. He leaned down and kissed him, letting his eyes flutter shut. Cas sighed in deep satisfaction as they pulled apart and Dean felt that rush of blood again.
Later that afternoon, Dean was just returning to the bunker. He had run out to get a few parts for Baby, insisting that she needed a tune-up. He really just needed to get away. He did not regret asking Cas to go out with him that night, but the idea of it still burned with anticipation and fear in his gut. Cas was an angel, and Dean was a still partially closeted man in his forties. He had asked on a whim, but he also wanted to make Cas happy.
Cas frowned, if it were up to him, he and Dean would be called every endearment under the sun, “No, we can continue to be friends. Although, I would prefer if you did not call me your brother again.”
After everything that happened with Billie, Dean knew he should be grateful, he owed Cas his life, but every time he looked at the angel he remembered that black ooze and the feeling of the cold bricks against his back as he watched it take his best friend. The best friend that had just told him he was not an instrument of destruction, the one who was in love with him. Instead of feeling grateful, though, he resented the sight of the angel, he resented being left with this weight on his shoulders, and mostly he resented that he knew how Cas felt. Everything between them felt so fraught with meaning now. Every time Cas stared a little too long it felt like he was baring his love for the whole world to see, and Dean supposed he was. The angel felt no shame, it made him happy to love Dean. This was the most baffling thing of all.
“No Dean, I don’t,” he said, his expression suddenly serious, “and Cas is my friend, so I want to make sure this isn’t you messing with him, or experimenting, or some shit. This should be real or…”
I wished the words back into my mouth as soon as they were said but it was no use. Dean stepped toward me, his head tilting I could see he was putting the pieces together.
Here, Sam stopped and grinned at his brother before facing the angels. "Damn right, Sammy." Said Dean, his smile almost as manic as Sam's own.
"Hey, don't compare me to that guy." Cas narrowed his eyes at Dean who quickly rectified himself. "Sorry, sorry. I keep forgetting he's not the arch-douche I knew. Speaking of which, do you guys have to work or something? Because I was hoping we could take you and teach you some basic defense moves since we don't know how long it'll be til we find your grace."
Unprecedented tears sprung into Sam's eyes. So many people had left him, whether it was by choice or not. He was tired of losing people and he told Gabriel so. "I'm tired of losing people. I just want them to stay. I want to be happy. I want you. I want to love you and be loved by you. But I'm more terrified of this than of anything from the past or the future. You're going to leave and then I'll be alone again."
"And then? How did we meet?" Cas asked, turning back to Dean. "Sammy here was killed. I made a deal with a demon to get him back. The deal was Sam came back and after a year, I'd go to hell. I was there for four months, but in hell each month counts for a decade, so I was there for forty years. You saved me. Your first words to me were "I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition." Cas grimaced. "I said it like that? I sound dull." A snort laughed escaped Dean. "You were. I told you more than once to get the stick out of your ass and relax. I used to say you dressed like a holy tax accountant because you were perpetually in blue slacks, a white dress shirt, a tie and a goddamn trench coat. You wore that coat regardless of the weather, because as an angel, you're not affected by the weather, so when we took you with us on FBI interviews you would get some weird ass looks. But it worked for you, you know? And now, now you're different. I don't know who you are. I don't know why you seem to remember me. Hell, I definitely didn't know you were gay. No wonder you freaked when I tried to help you lose your virginity by taking you to a brothel. You called it a Den of Iniquity." Dean laughed again, remembering the look on Cas's face.
Cloaked, Chuck watched and "heard" Sam, smiling to himself. The little human had gall. He'd make an excellent archangel. The perfect type needed to show the other angels about free will and standing up for yourself. He glanced at Dean, exchanging innuendo with his son, Cas. These two boys had defeated the Apocalypse simply because they said it wouldn't be so and stood by it. Yeah, they would make excellent angels. Chuck couldn't wait to add them to his family. Hopefully, they'd say yes.
"I don't know. You didn't tell us much about yourself. Shorty over there didn't either but he was prone to showing off his powers a lot more so that's where we kinda picked up what he could do."
His thought made him momentarily freeze but then he shook it off. It wasn't worth worrying over. This Gabriel was clearly interested in men that looked like him but the chances of that meaning anything to Gabriel once he got powered up again were slim to none. He'd probably snap out of the orbit the second he was able to so all Sam had to do was wait it out. If Chuck truly wasn't playing with their heads or hearts, him getting attached would probably be a bad idea. Unrequited feelings were the worst. Plus, you know, he was straight and all so there was that.
"Have we killed a lot of people?" asked Castiel, hilted tilted in a way reminiscent of who he used to be. Dean shook his head. "People, no. Angels and demons, yes."
"What introduced you to this world, anyway?" Cas asked Dean, who sighed. "Let's eat first and then we'll talk. I'm hungry. Got any pie?"
Cas nodded. "Dean and I burned them in a field not far from here. It's deserted there. We built a pyre and lit it up. It was so cool." Sam huffed a laugh. "Try doing it a few thousand times. It becomes much less cool."
Watching silently, He nodded in agreement with Sam. It was a weird type of immortality and maybe He should leave the boys at peace. They'd already done plenty for the world, after all. But there was something about them. Something even He couldn't figure out. These boys were the best that earth, heaven, and hell had to offer. The best of humanity and something more. The boys loved each other to a degree even His own sons hadn't. Was it really their life that had raised them that way? Or was it something more? Had He actually played a hand there at all? He shook His head at Himself. It couldn't be. He'd been gone for a while. No, they'd done this all on their own. It truly was astounding.
"So why were we brought back? And thank y'all for saving the world from the Apocalypse." Gabe shot Sam a genuine smile. Sam couldn't help but smile back but then it sorta melted and he let out a regretful sigh. "Look, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but if we found y'all that means it's for a reason. Not only that but it means that your graces must be somewhere here on earth. Finding them and giving them back to y'all would bring all the powers back and probably the memories as your grace would automatically heal anything it sensed was wrong. As for who brought you back, I'm guessing it was your dad."
"Not to mention I told him that if he had his powers he'd have been able to get rid of the bodies with his mind."
"Even Rigo?" Sam can't help but ask. Cas snorts. "Gabriel is...a bit unique. He has this thing where he doesn't mind sharing his body but never shares his mind, heart or soul. With everyone he's with it's a performance, his shields are all the way up and most of the time people get blown off by him before he even has to share his last name. But with you, he did immediately. I could tell in the way he let himself be handled by you, he was giving up the reins for a bit. And he's never done that. Ever."
Cas eyed him carefully, head tilted, reminiscent of the angel he used to be as Sam continued, "and you're so different from the way you were, getting your grace back? I don't even know what that's going to do to you, Cas. I don't know if you'll turn back into the...the pod person that you used to be or if you'll stay like that. You're actually more like Gabriel now than Gabriel is."
It had taken Sam a while to go to sleep at first, hyperaware of the proximity of Gabriel's body, but eventually, listening to the rhythmic sounds of his breaths as he inhaled and exhaled settled Sam and before he knew it he was asleep. Approximately four hours later he'd shifted and slightly woken, surprised and yet not at all, at finding Gabriel wrapped up securely in his arms. He sleepily dropped a kiss on his head and fell back to sleep. Five hours later he woke up to a series of clicks and opened one eye to find Dean smirking at him at the foot of the bed all while snapping pictures. Sam glared and pried himself out of Gabriel's embraced. He whined slightly but latched on to the pillow Sam had been using and remained asleep.
"You're more than welcome to bunk with me, Dean. I have no problem waking up with a handful of Dean, if you know what I mean." Cas's rumbly voice responded. Sam let out a snort. This Cas was so far removed from who the former Cas had been that it was downright comical. He seemed more like what Gabriel used to be, actually. Seemed God had a sense of humor.
Cas rolled his eyes. “They have alcohol, you heathen. You’ll live. Besides it’s not so much a restaurant as it is a... gathering place of sorts. The tables are all communal and people sit wherever. It was Dean’s turn to eye him suspiciously but he let it go. Sam noticed his brother throwing his nicest shirt into the duffle bag he was packing for the showers they were planning on taking after the gym. He would tease him about it but he was too happy that Dean was seemingly pulling his fucking head out of his ass and treating the whole thing like the date day it very clearly was.
"You asked earlier how we came into the life." Dean started, turning to flip the bacon around as Cas started plating the food, placing sliced up avocado beside the eggs and then pulling salsa out of the fridge. It made Sam's mouth water. It was rare when he got to eat salsa. He loved it although Dean didn't. Any amount of spice was too much for him.
Cas spoke up again, "Milo? Rigo? Would you guys be ok to catch an Uber back to your own homes? These fine ass gentlemen supposedly know us and are going to talk to us."
Gabriel hiccuped but nodded. "Not as much as Mr. Ripped over here but enough so that I can eat all the sweets I want. When I first got here I had something of a pudge. I didn't like it so I took up running and now I even run some marathons. Did I always do that? No, right? Otherwise I wouldn't have had a pudge." He looked at Sam in askance. Sam started to shake his head but then stopped. "In actuality, I'm not sure. I didn't know you that well. We just kinda, crossed paths if you will, a few times."
Sam hid his smile at Gabriel's words. Truthfully the ex-angel hadn't looked so much like an angel as he did now, all innocent and docile. It was adorable and he hoped that when Gabriel got his powers back, he'd remember this so that Sam could tease him about it. If he stuck around that is.
"I know Dean. But should you have had to? Think about it, if you had a six year old son, would you leave him alone in a hotel room? Knowing what kind of monsters both human and otherwise are out there?"
There was more that he wanted to say to Gabriel but right now a nap sounded good and there on the couch, with Gabriel in his arms, well he couldn't think of a better way to sleep.
Gabriel stood there and watched him apprehensively before he opened his mouth again. He almost walked away, he didn't like confrontation, but something about this man made him think that he would know answers that he needed. He had to stay.
Sam held in his groan and subsequent laughter before eventually losing the battle at how incredibly red his brother turned.
"He even turned into an alcoholic for a short amount of time. When he wasn't asleep he could be found at a club somewhere, drunk off his ass and sleeping his way through the crowd. I like clubs as much as the next person but Gabriel was there from Wednesday through Sunday. Then he eventually got pills and did the sleeping thing and he wasn't awake long enough to get drunk much less anything else. Then it all slowly stopped but he was diagnosed as severely depressed with severe social anxiety. It's still something of a battle for me to get him to leave the house in the day time. He's nocturnal as hell. When he saw you, Sam, he hadn't left the house in 11 days. At all. I was afraid he was regressing and was mentally preparing myself for the possibility when everything else happened. But hanging out with you, it's the most relaxed I've ever seen him with anyone who isn't me."
He was going to love him and give him all the cuddles and snuggles that Gabriel so clearly lacked. He was going to pray to a mostly absent God that Gabriel didn't leave him when he got his powers back. Sure, he'd never been with a guy but the thought of being with Gabriel didn't fill him with trepidation, instead it filled him with elation. It turned Sam on and although he didn't want to take advantage of Gabriel at such a fragile state he'd be lying if he said sex with human Gabriel didn't intrigue him. How would it compare to angel sex, he wondered. Hopefully he'd get the chance to find out.
Sam laughed. "Besides everything we already mentioned? Um, yeah, you could fly. Literally be anywhere in the world you wanted within seconds. You could snap and materialize anything you wanted out of thin air. You turned me into a car, you know. You could heal, bring people back from the dead, kill them with a thought, handy when it came to demons, lots of things."
As Dean walked up to the bar, presumably to tab out, Sam ran his eyes over Gabriel's body. Seeing Cas and how he was clearly a badass now, completely different from the stoic angel they once knew made him want to pay attention to Gabriel and see how else he was different. He spotted some minor differences as he held his hand out to Gabriel and helped him rise up off the floor. Gabriel was wearing skinny jeans that accentuated his shapely small legs. They stopped right at his ankles, frayed at the bottom, and had a ripped knee. They looked like girl pants but Gabriel easily pulled them off. He wore them with white Chucks and a simple white tee with one pocket across a shapely body that looked excellent against the light blue wash of his jeans. Jeggings, thought Sam. He remembered seeing the word somewhere and could feel that's what they were. Sam's eyes traveled up as he took in Gabriel's small but muscular body and he blurted out, "Do you work out?" before he could stop himself.
Sam looked at Dean then away. He's the one who brought it up, he thought. He should be the one to explain.
The smile slid off Sam's face. He had just been joking with Dean but had forgotten that his brother carried a lot of guilt, as evidenced by their time in the company of Osiris. "I was just trying to give you a hard time, Dean. I didn't mean anything by it."
"When we first met you were posing as a janitor. You flirted with me to try to distract me and when we eventually figured out you were the trickster, that is to say, the one behind all of the mess, we had to kill you. But here's the thing, the thing you didn't tell us until much later. The people who were...affected by your trickery were people that deserved it. You see, as an archangel, you can see people's souls. You can tell whether they are good or bad and as the archangel of justice, it's your literal God given gift to see that those that deserve it see a certain level of justice for their sins. Why you never punished me, I'll never know but maybe you can tell me once you've taken back your mantle. But back to my story, one of the people you killed was this man who was experimenting on animals and doing terrible things to them supposedly for the betterment of science, but really he was just a sadistic bastard who liked inflicting pain on the innocent beings. You fed him to a crocodile in a sewer. Totally cliched but fitted. And you kept one of the little puppies who had gotten his leg cut off. You named him Broozer. He'd doing fine because you set it up so that his water bowl and food bowl replenish themselves and he knows how to clean after himself because as an archangel you speak Esperanto and thus can speak to animals. But he's alone in a pocket universe that only you can get into and truth be told he's probably missing his daddy right about now."
Sam turned to Cas. "Have y'all heard laughter like that here before?" Cas shook his head. "Nothing weird has ever happened here. It's probably y'all since you said bad news follows you around."
"That sounds about right." Dean said. "You would have now, you'd already been down on earth for a long time, you picked up being human then, but Cas had no point of reference. Angels don't need to shower, eat, sleep or a whole slew of things."
Sam laughed. "Yeah, no kidding. You know, Dean told me when he first met you he tried to stab you with a demon blade, the strongest weapon we had at the time. According to him you didn't even flinch. Just dropped it and smirked. If we could 'die' like that, painless and, you know, not actually die, that'd be great but no, your dad likes to make us feel the pain of dying of getting shot, for example, and all for naught, basically, because he just pulls us back."
