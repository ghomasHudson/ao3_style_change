So too is Sherlock, tranquil and quiet as he stands by the sink to fill the kettle for some much needed tea. It's one of the only times the detective is known to brew it as he usually leaves the thankless task to poor John.
Surveying the room for an opportunity to somehow escape, John nods lazily, fingers gently tapping on the expensive tablecloth.
'Fuckkkk, Sherlock.' John hisses at the feeling of his release, coating both his cock and Sherlock's crack and his hole, sliding down his bollocks. Sherlock grunts and wiggles his hips. John kisses his neck, releases his hair and promptly drops to his knees, prompting the detective to make a questioning noise and tilt his head back to see what the doctor's doing.
Those normally icy shards are now molten like molassess, only a very thin ring of grey surrounding and being swallen up by his pupils.
He'd shortly been whiskered away on a case which turned up to be pretty mild by Sherlock's standards, despite the fact that he'd forced John to traipse all around London on an empty stomach for the best part of the day, the prat.
- Mhmmm, Jawn ?
The door slams behind and John swaggers through the corridor, front entrance and out the Diogenes Club, an entirely too pleased smirk on his face.
The trip upstairs is quiet, and it's still quiet once they've entered Sherlock's childhood room. They stop and stare at one another, and John can see Sherlock's rapid pulse in his pale, long neck, right underneath that perfect beauty mark. John's own pulse is erratic. Their eyes are locked on each others', flickering with hundreds of unecessary words, reading each other silently.
John's turned around, making for the door before he turns his head slightly to throw some more words over his shoulder. Alright, he's entitled to some bloody showing off.
'If you don't open that door in the next 5 seconds, I'm going to fuck your right here in full view of everyone.'
"That was unnecessary."
..or he could push Sherlock against the door to their flat and proceed to fuck him senseless right then and there.
Lestrade and the gang visit 221B right when John is in the middle of something...
John know this has just started, so he nudges Sherlock's foot again more firmly, clearing his throat. Sherlock twitches his foot away and refuses to lift his eyes, making John start to scowl.
Ten reps, twenty, followed by some back clap push ups later, John finally stands up and grabs a towel from the arm of the sofa.
Lestrade guesses by the perplexed expression on Sherlock's face that this is quite unexpected. Clearly, John's playing this music and to be honest Lestrade wouldn't have thought John to be the type to listen to Rammestein. Lestrade himself only recognizes the band because of his angry teenage daughter, and the less said about that the better..
Left fist.
They've only arrived yesterday evening, and what a commotion that had been, thank God it is over. John loves Mummy and Daddy Holmes, that's for sure, but he'd been a tad embarrased at the fanfare and just a bit uncomfortable from tiny questions in their eyes, which he could see.
Greg and Donovan push the man out of the room, Donovan throwing him one last look which John doesn't understand, and Mark and Anderson still don't say anything as John bats at his clothes uselessly and makes his way over to Sherlock.
When their cloth clad erections finally meet, their lips break apart with a wet sounding smack, and they both groan. Sherlock's head tilts back, slamming against the door, while John presses his forehead to the space between the taller man's shoulder and neck. Their hips meet again and again, cocks dragging firmly against each other through the flimsy matterial of their clothes.
'Open your trousers, drop them and spread your legs.'
loses his temper, despite Sherlock's continous attempts at driving him spare, the sod. It's crucial now, more than ever, that he remains unknown to the masses, especially the British government.
' - no wonder the criminal population seems to be flourishing if the police have nothing better to do than kidnapping me.'
It seems to John that people around the table were actually paying attention, as he hears a small gasp from Hannah and feels everyone's eyes on him for a couple of seconds before conversation picks up again, more quietly this time. He's sure they're paying attention now.
...omg guys  this is the filthiest thing I've ever written. Please forgive me haha. Also, remember English is not my first language and I have no beta.
"How dare you - who do yo think you are?" Victor's black eyes are filled with hatred as they run from him to Sherlock and back.
Sherlock humms and lets himself get dragged away to his..
The doctor does a great job of hiding his body underneath all those jumpers, but his body is ripped. Strong back muscles swell and shift sinuously like a tiger's muscles underneath his fur. One arm's squeezed in a tight fist at his back, while his right pushes him up and down. The music is too loud to hear anything but he looks like he's grunting and breathing deeply in time with his effort.
tone has turned questioning so his eyes focus in and he hands the phone, who's display had turned black by now, back to her.
Both turn their eyes to Lestrade, who is pinching the bridge of his nose and shaking his head. Donovan next to him looks speechless,  arms hanging by her side and eyes going from Sherlock, to John and to the still limp form spread out on the floor in the middle of the room.
back down.
Maybe someone choked on their bread appetizer, or the chef's slashed his finger or seriously injured one of his waiters. Looking back at his companion, it looks like she is still taking about her cat.
'And you DARE to show your face, today of all days. And you dare to lay your filthy hand on Sherlock. You fucking cockroach, Mycroft Holmes, you listen to me and listen well. If you ever, and I mean EVER, raise your hand at your brother again, if you even
Sherlock's gasp is lost in the hubbub and covered by Lisa's giggles, which have gotten progresively louder as the evening wore on.
'YOU PIECE OF SHIT.'
But John knows what he is doing. He was a young and reckless alcoholic when he himself was plucked off the streets and offered a chance. He cannot in good conscience leave this young man do overdose by himself in some mucky alley. His mind repels that thought, plus Mrs.  Hudson would be very ashamed.
“What are you doing?” said I, walking towards him.
The smell of the sheets was very
The weather was pleasant, not too cold and not too hot. The winds blew from time to time and left me shivering, to which Sherlock responded by drawing me closer.
“As always, John. You see but do not observe-”
I stared at him for sometime and finally regaining the power of speech, I said, "
Stanley chuckled and Sherlock threw him an agitated glance which brought him back to the purpose of his visit.
I smiled at him but quickly placed the cup aside.
“So whose idea are we-”
He woke up with a start and I chuckled but his words shut me up, “What? Is he here?”
Sherlock was sitting on his recliner whereas Stanley was on the floor. On asking why, Sherlock said that he was going to sit in my recliner and when refused, Stanley took to the floor. This made me genuinely smile.
“Don’t tell me you didn’t know this. The most cheesy action and the romantic doesn’t know about it?” said I and chuckled though he still stood there with the same expression as before.
I quickly texted him, ‘What the fuck is I love you?’ to which he replied, ‘The fuck that I feel for you.’
“Also, if you’re not standing at the door in five minutes I’ll dump you in Amsterdam and go back.” He said it without the slightest humor in his voice.
It was about six when Sherlock came in and sat beside me.
"You mean an alias?"
“Oh. Also-”
The next morning, Sherlock came out of his room dressed in blue pants, an untucked black shirt with folded sleeves and messy, wet hair. The serious look had returned on his face and he looked both cool
Away from set pieces, props help to secure the ball when a player has been tackled, so it helps if they can combine their power with a degree of mobility. You’ll also often see them used as battering rams in attack, receiving short passes after a ruck or maul and hitting the opposition defence at pace in an attempt to occupy the defenders and make space for their own backs.
Sherlock gasps, full body trembling with arousal, but he soon manages to unlock the door. As soon as they're inside, by silent mutual agreement they start climbing the stairs at a rapid pace.
John's luckily been able to grab the seat in front of him, and he's quietly chewing on his roast turkey, listening to conversations around the dining table but also keeping an eye on Sherlock.
Luckily, it seems like it's all coming to a finish soon, and before John knows it's all flown by, Gerrick and Lisa finally moving on to other subjects and Facebook stalking apparently, and John's never thought to see a Holmes on Facebook other than for a case. John and Sherlock have somehow slipped in their own little bubble, mock bickering about cleaning the flat and the state of the kithen as Sherlock's forgotten an experiment on the table back home, when Gerrick flaps his tongue again and makes everyone stop in their traps.
'John, was is really necessary to push me down? Now I have to dry clean it! We're stopping at Johnson's on the way.' Sherlock scowls, pointing at his bloodied and dusty cloak form where he fell on the body when John pushed him.
He stops to murmur to Sherlock when the man makes to take himself in hands.
John hums and purses his lips, fingers twitching around his mouth, supporting his face, tapping his cheek in that way he does without realizing when irritated, the more he listens to the bastard go on.
'You're lucky you have us as witnesses that he was assaulting Sherlock. But fucking hell John...he's three times bigger than you. Hell, he's probably four times bigger than you!! You
- you can notice the stubble burn on her neck she's tried and
Nowadays, John rarely ever
The older Holmes has been bothering them with his presence quite often lately. John had thought it better to stay out of it, but that had been two weeks ago. But judging by Sherlock's tense shoulders as he approaches from behind and the snippets of conversation he's just heard, he thinks it might be time to step in.
A phantom of a laugh from his left makes John glance at Siger, who'se apparently head the whole thing and must know a thing or two about rugby. Mummy and Hannah are in the kitchen and Roger's gone outside for a cheeky fag. Lisa's face is scrunched up, looking constipated but other than laughing at Gerrick's blatherings, she's not contributing much to the table.
'So, Gerrick, you used to play sports?' John suddenly asks, overiding the prick's attempt at digging into Sherlock.
They both ask. 'What?!'
" - but the vet said I seriously need to book an appointment! Poor Munchkins! John?,"  John realizes Lucy's,
The flat feels like it's exhaling in relief in the aftermath of their latest case. Solved of course.
Gasping form efort he kneels on the killer's back, knee on his hands to restrain him and looks up. Greg and Donovan have their guns pointed at the murderer, but gawping at John. Mark is somewhere behind them watching John in awe but John ignores all of this and looks around for Sherlock. The latter is leaning on the far wall near the entrance, watching the doctor with a strange expression on his face.
Sherlock opens his mouth almost absent midedly and his words drip off his tongue like melted honey.
Lestrade decides to cut their visit short immediatly. Those two need to be alone and sort things out, and this seems like the best time for it.
They haven't done anything and John blames himself because he's been too cowardly to come out of the closet as bisexual. He's certain there have been times when Sherlock's flirted with him..maybe even tried to make him realise that the detective had changed his mind about beind 'married to his work'. John had clammed up each time. Fool.
John manages to land another kick with his leg just in time before he's out of reach.
He's not calmed down. His fingers twitch and rub together at his sides in that way they always do when he's spitting mad. Sherlock's face is indescribable. He's rarely seen it do whatever it's doing now. Sure, the younger man's always showed pleasure whenever John's defended him or put Mycroft in his place. But Sherlock looks shocked, grateful, guilty..the latter emotion's probably at John's earlier words about how he's been thinking of Reichenbach..
'Can't sweetheart, you're not loose enough..no time.' Talking is hard when his eyes are feasting on the side of his flushed cock, sandwiched between the perfect white globes of Sherlock's ass. The damned man is pushing back against him, up and down, back and forth, making John's cockhead drag wetly across his pucker and, on one occasion, almost breach it.
Sherlock only nods too busy getting up from the bed and cautiously walking over to where John is still kneeling by the side of the bed.
'John..' he gasps.
A sharp crack cuts through all the noise in the street, followed by Sherlock's surprised gasp. Mycroft's left his hair longer lately and it abandons it's normal state to fly into his face with the force of his momentum.
It's that very filthy sound that pushes him over the edge, that and Sherlock's sounds and warmth and his scent. His hands tighten in the detective's air, his hips still between the other man's cheeks and they boath moan when his cock starts pulsing wetly.
From the looks and sounds of it, John understand why Sherlock and Mycroft hate the 'Christmas dinners'. It seems like the Holmes cousins aren't very nice at all. Not very nice no, they remind John of the wanker, Sebastian Wilkes.
appropriate -, "
John gulps, feeling stuck like a fly in a spider's web, heart rabbiting in his chest. He's helpless to even breathe, lost to the world and nothing else exists but those cat eyes and the way they're eyeing him up, promising to devour him whole.
Glad they didn't ask any questions, though Violet did caress his cheek and shake her head in an alarming way at one point, but Siger, thank God, saw John's alarmed face behind her and coughed once, prompting Mummy to let go. Sherlock, damn him, had already bounded up inside, insufferable prick that he is, and left John to deal with the luggage as usual.
Sherlock finally breaths and leans forward, head dropping against the door, curls all mussed. John slowly gets up, caressing his back as he makes to support the slumping form of the detective.
John feels his cheeks flush, probably because of the wine, or because of Sherlock who's shifted his other leg to squeeze John's left in between
'Shhh sweetheart, soon, shhh. ' They're now breathing in each other's mouth, lips and tongues dragging wetly against each other with their movements. It's hot and heady in the flat and their bodies are now  drenched with perspiration, making the slap of John's hips against Sherlock's ass sound very obscene.
HIs hips push back against John's face in tiny movements. John's tongue keeps swirlling around that pink hole that's still covered with his come. He laps it all up, groaning at the obscenity of it all. It feels animalistic, it's making him break in goosebumps at the thought that he's marked Sherlock like an animal and he's now cleaning him up.
John forces himself to keep his eyes on Lestrade who's prattling away about the rugby match he'd seen at the pub yesterday. Unfortunately John had missed it, having only come back from a medical conference in Edinburgh today at noon.
"You don't know what you're doing. You don't want me in your life, Doctor."
'God Jawn..just fuck me..please, oh, oh..
'Uhh, how long have you guys been there?'
John's stiff proouncement cuts the brothers' argument short, and they both turn their icy eyes to regard him.
Longish hair disheveled and sticking to his sweaty forehead, chest panting for breath John pushes Greg and Donovan away and turns towards the bed on which Sherlock still lays.
Dear lord, she's now scrolling on her phone to show him pictures of Moon Moon, no doubt.
Backbiter - nothing to do with rugby, it means: One who spreads rumors of another, usually going behind their back or stabbing them in the back.
Suddenly there's a loud bang, startling John out of his musings and he reacts before his mind could comprehend what's happening.
' - Hardly, you're being unreasonably dim today, John'. Sherlock scoffs, interrupting John, but the latter raises his voice to cover the detective's words.
The doctor had asesses all of this in less than a second, and as he charges across the room like a bull, he briefley meets Sherlock's greateful eyes. He might have noticed them widen if he'd been in the right mind to pay attention to anything else than the all consuming urge to destroy.
'Heard you talking about your kitchen, this little freak here used to dissect dead birds when we were at uni. Shared a dorm, the numbers of times he'd bring roadkill and such in, really, no wonder no one liked him - '
'Anderson, email me the results!'
Shaking hands.
He's been battling his sexuality from the first moment he laid eyes on this brilliant man, but the last couple of weeks especially have been tenuous. Days and nights consistent of swatting down thoghts of plump lips, electric eyes, milky white thighs under a revealing blue slik gown. Nights of turning over in bed, of swiping on Tinder in the hope of finding an acceptable date to continue a life that he knows is a facade.
Best case ever. He must remember to thank Lestrade for hiring...and sacking that useless man, whatever his name was.
They only have eyes for each other, and only one thing on their mind. Catching the first cab home, to 221B, where John's going to undress Sherlock and proceed to make them both forget everything else but each other for some time.
** Sherlock belongs entirely to John, A C-Doyle and Moftiss, I'm making no money on the back of these stories. Obviously.
John gives him a warm smile before turning back to his meal, foot tingling where it's touching Sherlock's.
Truth is, not a lot of people know John as well as they'd like, his closest friends and family included. Whereas Harry was loud and brash, more bark than bite so to say, John was quiet when wronged, until just before he crushed their bones.
What he'd just witnessed plus all the pain and nuisances of the day cause John to literally see red. His fist tightens around Myroft's hand until he can feel the bones grind together and then finally crack under the pressure and the man cries out, bending over in pain.
' I can do whatever I please, Mycroft. You're not the boss of me. If you care about it so much why don't you take it for yourself. I have no care for being caged in that fancy prison, doing nothing and being bored for the rest of my life. Ha, I've no desire to become a shrew like mu-'
He's gasping by the end of it. Shoulders bulging, chest puffing up with each breath which fails to fill his lungs and body with anything else but anger.
Their heads come together at once, and their lips join together perfectly. One of them moans and soon the only sounds in the room are that of their rapid breaths and their slick mouths and tongues coming together desperately.
' - all of this is your fault. All of today, hmm.' His fist never loosens it's grip.
Ever since Shelock's come back, Anderson's been behaving almost like a fan boy, and Sherlock doesn't want to admit it to John but the latter knows the detective is almost enjoying it. Sure, he still complains of Anderson's stupidity most of the times but not as much as before.
When the door to flat B slammed shut, so did Sherlock's body against it. He bent his knes slightly, automatically making it just slightly easier for John, who pressed both hands against the door on either side of Sherlock's face and his lips against his at the same time.
John snorts angrily. 'Oh really, tell me more Oh Oracle of the East. Are you able to predict the future, now -'
His arms release Moriarty's neck and he backs up a step, palms raised. His pulsing mind keeps on to the last dredges of consciousness before the rage drowns everythig and with a quiet shnick he cuts the wires, rendering the bomb useless. As he does so, a quiet vibration follows the dying sounds of Moriarty's laughter. It starts small in his chest before ending in that sort of wet growl that wolves let out right before killing their pray.
No one other than him should kiss Sherlock, whispers a dark voice in his mind. He shakes his head, aware that Sherlock is  scrutinizing him very closely. Those clear icy eyes narrow as they watch the doctor's fists clench on the edge of the mattress.
'All right, gentlemen. I think it's best you two go home now. Uhm, I'll be coming around tomorrow or..or the day after, to take your statements but right now it's best you two go and wind down.'
Lestrade pulls him back, one hand clamped on his wrist to stop him punching, the other fistied in his jumper and pulling back. He struggles against both Lestrade and Donovan now, grunting and growling like an animal.
His boy turns around quickly and smushes his face in his neck, arms tight around John's waist. John brings him as close as physically possible, all the while silently swearing he'll do a better job of protecting his partner, his
The elder Holmes brother's chin juts up, and his words and arrogant grimace make John's stomach tighten in fury. He steps forward all the way until he's shoulder to shoulder with the detective, on his left, and he's barely acknowledged by Mycroft but he feels it when Sherlock leanes into him just the tiniest bit.
this gift. Who cares if people talk, let them, they do little else after all.
Loud music is playing from upstairs, so loud it seems like the walls are pulsing from the power of the bass.
room, and then managed to knock him out with the first punch.'  Lestrade paces as he rants, hands waving around form John to the still form.
They're at the front door when a thump and an unmistakable, cut-off grunt echoes upstairs.
When the car stops in fron of 221B,  they fly out of the car at the same time. Sherlock is there first, key stumbling in the lock when John presses his body against the detective's.
"You'll have to tell me how you knew I'm a Doctor. Come on now, I have surgery next morning."
If the detective were to turn around, the doctor is sure his changeable eyes would sport his usual post case verdigris, a job well done. Lazy and sultry and coy, the hardest of Sherlock's looks for John, the one that tests his resolve in a maddening way and makes him usually vacate the room or rush upstairs for fear he'd break and kiss the mad bastard dead.
'Blimey, mate! What the bloody hell was that?'
Gerrick, and John's so far not been able to say it about any of the Holmses, but Gerrick truly is ugly. All slick like Sebastian, hair gelled back, expensive posh suit, obnoxious perfume and yellow cracking teeth. Not very appealing at all. He's even more ugly inside.
And then, there's Mycroft.
ALSO, A MASSIVE THANK YOU to all of you who have taken the time to comment and kudos my stories. I appreciate it so much, it means a lot to me. I'm sorry I'm unable to reply to each and every one of you because of my busy work schedule - but please know I appreciate you guys and it's your feedback that encourages me to write some more.
from now on. He dares anyone else to threaten Sherlock ever again. He's going to feast on their bones.
He shakes his head shortly, and continues to wait patiently.
'What the hell...'
John wishes he could see his face, open in  a silent orgasm. He bets it's the same face he makes when he's solved a case, that lush mouth open wide in a delicious O.
John is no longer a doctor right now..he is a soldier. He's  Captain Watson, defending soemthing most precious to him. One leg kicking Jack in the chest and thus pushing him back to the floor, the soldier drops to his knees, straddling the cop.
Mrs. Hudson had been very enamored with the final finish and she's also the happy owner of Speedy's.
Sherlock's irritate groan covers up the cabbie's voice coming from the front seat but John only pays the latter a fraction of a second of attention as he is too preoccupied with fuming at Sherlock.
'I..I'm fine John. That was...'
John grasps him by the hips, lifting on his toes to murmur to the taller man's ear An ear that has turned adorably pink.
Lestrade pushes Sherlock gently to advance in the room, and they all stop and gape once properly inside.
(See the end of the chapter for
But as they reach the main road, no cab in sight, Sherlock turns towards John, who looks questioningly up at him, and promptly bends down to clumsily smush their lips together. And John doesn't hesitate, his hands fist in Sherlock's hair, dragging him closer and tilting his head, and they kiss and kiss..and kiss; wet and warm and slick, with  moans and
John's had a long day, he's tired and finds  this situation too ridiculous to entertain any longer. His back straightens out, his posture adopting his Captain persona and when he speaks his voice is smooth and low, polite and commanding.
They both moaned in each other's mouth, lips still for a second as if just realizing they're finally kissing. Then they began to slide wetly and drag, to nibble and suckle. John broke away for a moment for a breath before licking Sherlock's upper lip..that damn lip has been driving him insane with the urge to kiss it since he'd first laid eyes on it.
'Christ, Watson calm down!' Donovan huffs as she struggles to pull him away.
It's heady and hot, it's the hottest sex John's had to date and they're not even naked. He wants to devour Sherlock, wants to mark him permanently and to cover any imprint left by anyone else on his skin, ever.
'John.. fuck me.' John groans desperately at hearing that, but he knows they're not prepared right now and he doesn't want to hurt Sherlock.
Sherlock's shouting for him, something sounds and feels wrong. John breaks in a run out of the victim's bedroom,  and stopps in the hallway of the big mansion. Lestarade and Donovan nearly collide with him, as they'd followed him as soon as he'd burst out.
Lestrade and Anderson shout and John can hear young Mark's worried cries for help but Sherlock is suspiciously silent and John's worried the murderer shot him. He needs to turn and check on the detective, but the killer is built like a beast and willful.
(See the end of the chapter for
John had always been, in people's eyes, the more tempered child when compared to Harry.
'- Jesus, Jesus Christ John!!!! Donovan, don't just stand there, help me pull him away!'
Mycroft. Should've known.
'Oh?', he asks seemingly politely, 'what do you mean to suggest?'
But it's 3am now, and they're bone tired, all of them. There's too much ruckus, what with members of the yard running around shouting to each other, police lights flashing, the chatter of some stragglers attracted by the incident, the screams of the serial killer as he's being handcuffed and read his rights.
Clearing his throat, John leans back in his chair, casual as you like, left hand still clasped in Sherlock's, whose dark, dilated eyes seem to bring John's blood to boil underneath his skin. The silence follows on for a couple of seconds, and the soldier's coming down from his high, smiling a bit apologetically at the other people at the table. It seems though, he shouldn't have bothered, as pretty much almsot everyone bar a pasty, sickly Gerrick and a quiet Lisa, have tiny smiles at the corner of their mouths, sipping their drinks almost peacefully.
He clears his throat politely to interrupt what looks to be start of another monologue, meaning to excuse himself for the evening but a commotion to his left stalls him. They both turn their heads to watch.
John smirks and leans back in his chair, having bent a bit towards Gerrick as if conspiratorially. For his part, Sherlock's still watching John however a bit puzzled this time, but his eyes gleam and flicker like watching a match, back and forth between John and his asshole of a cousin. John will explain this one later to Sherlock, but  basically there's no such thing as a 'backbiter' in rugby. Sounds like it could be though, and it shows Gerrick's talking out of his arse.
Yeah, apparently there's another person on the planet apart from John and Irene, who  Sherlock's managed to utterly charm.
His modest Audi S8 winks and he makes over, speaking over his shoulder, "Get in the car."
Mmmeaow.
Lifting his head from where it's resting on the window, he turns to check on Sherlock, and is not so much startled by the fact that Sherlock is already staring at him, but by the look in his eyes.
John hisses, and grabs Sherlock's hips in a brusing hold in order to control the pace and avoid penetrating the man by accident and hurting him. He proceeds to pull the detective back and forth with his arms, rutting his cock fast and faster between his arse cheeks until he's almost close to release. Sherlock is making small breathy moans, hands fisted against the door, forehead dropping against one arm and head trashing back and forth against it as if he can't take the pleasure anymore.
mould cultures! Unbelievable!'
And John's not even touched his cock yet. Because he wants to mark Sherlock. He wants to mark him as his, wants to mark him first and then show him that John is the only one who will ever be able to pleasure Sherlock. He wants to get himself off first to get rid of this dangerous energy, because Sherlock deserves his  whole and undevided attention. And John swears to give him his best.
ALSO, I know some of you are waiting for some smut! I promise I will deliver, it's just that at the moment real life is hectic and I need time to site down and properly write a good sex scene - I'm obsessive about those, they need to be right so they take me a long time to write.
', and John can't stop his smile as Gerrick nods pompously, giving a self-important little smile,' I myself used to be a forwards 1&3 prop. Liked using my body as a battering ram to attack the opposition. Quite fun.'
P.S - I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes, English is not my first language and despite five years of speaking it every day, I find there's massive room for improvement.
he inclines his chin towards Mycroft's desk,
'Oi, move over' mutters Anderson, and Donovan who cocked her head over Sherlock's shoulder shushes him dazedly.
The silence in the car is heavy like honey as they're eyeing each other up. Soon enough they'll be arriving at home, and John is thinking of the possibilities. He has two choices, either he could run up to his room as soon as he's out of the car...
day. AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.'
He risks a glance at the sleek surface of his watch and has to stifle a sigh, another day wasted, another useless date - and tomorrow, he's back at St. Barts early morning for a major operation.
please.'
Sherlock and Lestrade are near the body, Greg listening attentively and nodding from time to time while Sherlock explains how the killer managed to murder the poor young man laying at their feet. John's chosen to look away from the body - out of respect not squeamishness - and is instead staying a couple of feet back, arms behind his back and carefully looking out for Sherlock.
His mouth drags wetly against Sherlock's balls, licking up the trickle of come that had leaked down and Sherlock moans are turning more high piched by the moment, until finally one hand drops back and fists in John's hair, dragging his face back against his hole.
Sherlock spits the address to the Diogenes Club and John purses his lips, raising his eyes heavenwards.
John coughs and scratches at the back of his neck, arm muscles bulging as he does so. His abs tremble in time with this breath, and shorts seems to have slipped enough for his V cut to be seen.
Right fist.
' -because if so, tell me, am I going to kill you by the end of the night? I'd say almost definitely!'
'Sherlock?' John bellows, turning around. Thinking quickly, the man could have only been nearby as otherwise doubtful John could have heard him, so the doctor bursts into the room across the hall, Lestrade and Donovan just behind him.
John's face turns darker and darker the more he listens from behind Sherlock, who's slumped in a posh armchair, a picture of indifference. Only the tapping of his fingers give away his fury at Mycroft's supercilious words.
John can't ever remember wanting to do this with or for any of his previous partners. Only Sherlock, only ever his sweet man. This man that has managed to make himself the single most important being in John's life. He'd give his life for him. He'd kill and destroy for him. He wants to fuck him and love him, and consume him.
Face squeezed in a pained grimace, Victor cries out, turning towards John. Everyone's eyes are by now on them, the whole restaurant is silent.
He swallows a lump in his throat as he puzzles over all of this, but his eyes are still stuck on the lithe form rumaging around in the cabinets overhead. White, elegant fingers pluck at the chocolate digestives.
Sherlock's eyebrow rises, eyes narrowing slightly. John feels a shiver crawling down his spine, knowing that Sherlock's deducing his thoughts right now. His brilliant man.
The music is even louder in here, bouncing off the walls and Lestrade can also feel it ricochet in his sternum. The sofa, armchairs and coffee table have been pushed and aligned by the wall, so there's some open space in the middle of the room. And John's on the floor, doing push-ups. Naked, one armed pushu-ps.
And then he starts waling on him. Right fist, left fist. Right fist, left fist.
His eyes then widen and immediatly squeeze in pleasure when John parts his cheeks and he feels his warm tongue slide through the wetness against his whole, up to his crack.
Grunting with every action, feeling blood trickling down his knuckles on his right hand, raised high and prepared to land another heavy blow, John slowly starts to register what's happening, just in time to be pulled off the silent man beneath.
They share a deep gaze for a long moment, that is broken only by a cough from behind.
Hello everyone! :) First of all, just wanted to say thank you for all who read my story and take the time to leave a kudo or a comment - much appreciated! I have a hectic schedule, I work late almost everyday and sometimes during the weekend too, so not only do I have little time to write, I also have little time to write back in reply to your comments. So, just know that I really appreciate it and at some point I will reply. :)
With that we walked out of the door to our
Sherlock, who was a bit surprised by my question, said "He brings me cases which are peculiar. Why?"
“I just had my third breakup in this month and if you don’t come-”
“You were acting quite, well, not
As he said the last words his whole body convulsed. I quickly took his hands in mine and forced him to look at me, which he ignored, “Sherlock, look into my eyes.” said I firmly, “Do you see any doubt in them?”
He laughed and was about to get up when I pushed him back.
“Because I fucking like you.”
My hands were soon in his hair and slowly slid to his neck. His body relaxed and his face was in my direction now. He looked so innocent, it was hard not to kiss him. He moved his hands and I withdrew mine. He slowly opened his eyes and said, "What are you doing?"
“Well, let me stay up with you. I always wondered what you did when most people slept.”
“Shut up.” And I pushed him to face me and jumped on him.
It said:
Sherlock was sleeping peacefully when I got up. It was always a delight to watch him sleep. With a quick kiss on his forehead, I got up and went to the toilet, got dressed and then made tea for the both of us.
“What?! Why?”
I quickly got up and went with him.
“What exactly were you thinking?”
The old woman went away saying something about how love is so pure and rare but I was still hung up on his ‘not yet’.
“Same thing.” Said he and put his lips to mine.
I jumped on the bed and pulled a blanket over me, Sherlock was talking to someone at the door. As soon as he saw me in the bed he shouted, “NO!” then came running to me and propped himself beside me.
I was enjoying my bath when I heard a knock on the door followed by my name.
? And no, nothing is wrong, I was just trying to wake you up.”
He finally stopped shaking and tried to smile. I got him to stand and walked with him to his room while he kept repeating to himself, ‘I told you so.’
“Are you going to say something?”
“Sherlock.” I shouted.
“Then you will end up not sleeping ever. Also we’re going on a holiday,” he said this with his usual deadpan voice but only I, or maybe you guys, would know how great both of those sentences were for me.
“If you ever want to hear mine just put your hand on your chest.” Said I and with that he removed his hands and pulled me into his arms and started…crying? I pulled back instantly and saw a teary-eyed and red Sherlock. A tear fell on my hand, I wanted to say something to comfort him but I just froze there.
I couldn’t believe him. He had thrown open the whole door and had made as much noise as possible and was now shushing me!?
“What the-”
” said I truly annoyed but also surprised.
"Can I come?"
But I couldn’t go any further as Sherlock was on me, his hands pinning mine above my head and kissing me with absolute urgency. I was taken aback but soon joined in.
"What?" asked he and looked straight into my eyes. This was the first time I realized that I had feelings for him. I hastily looked away, thanking the weather that at least he had his black jacket on. We were soon at the crime scene. I knew nothing of the case except that it was baffling.
I quickly covered the distance between us and was now almost inches from him. He must’ve thought that I was going to kiss him because when I pulled him up and started dancing with him, he kinda was in a daze.
“In here,” came his voice from the kitchen. I quickly went to see what he was doing now.
“Why are you acting so, so-”
Ignoring the sarcasm in my voice, he said “At your own risk.”
“Thank you. We’re going out for lunch.” said he.
I didn’t get any calls or texts from Sherlock after that. Being an affable fellow I was thoroughly bored and felt dejected. So I went to Mycroft and then to Percy Phelps as well but still felt the same. Maybe it was because I missed him.
He moved away from me and stood beside me with a glass of water in his hand.
“Well, you will today,” said Lestrade and dragged us out of the apartment.
“Listen to me, Sherlock.” Now I had got all his attention just because I had made my voice seem a bit serious.
It was already two days since that incident and he hadn’t showed up or tried to contact me. I was eating my lunch alone when I couldn’t take it anymore and called him.
“We gotta go to the pub,” said he, ignoring all the angry looks Sherlock sent him.
“Sherlock, what is it?” I didn’t know that I could have a firm voice too. He sat upright and with a small smile said, “Is it alright to get scared for your friend when he’s just a little sick?” He said this with a hint of fear but mostly innocence in his voice.
“At least you’re punishing some of them while I’m treating any and every person that walks in my clinic.
The whole night was very boring. Sherlock used the night to think in the very position I found him in the morning. Sometimes I thought he fell asleep but obviously he hadn’t.
It was a sweet little place, the restaurant. Not many people were there and surely no one was there on a bike. I pointed that out for Sherlock which he dismissed with a
“We did that yesterday, day before yesterday- We do that almost everyday.”
“Didn’t you like the movie?” asked Sherlock as he switched off the T.V.
That was it, I couldn’t make him talk any further.
“I’ll have what you’re having.” Said he in a desolate voice and wrapped his arms around my waist.
“What did you tell, Sherlock?”
He let go, so that he could breathe while I put my hand in between our faces and said, “Have I turned you on by my knowledge, sir?”
smile when I told him about the same. I asked him to help and he readily agreed, which was quite strange.
hot. This was even better than the sports tee.
“Wait, are you saying that you care about me?”
“Since when I got competition.” he looked at me and kissed me on my forehead. Since when could lunatics make you all warm from the inside?
“Lestrade got dumped
whilst chopping wood.
“What the hell?” said I, as I saw Sherlock sticking out his head from the window. “Impressive. You’re up early.”
“You’re so not going to wear that,” said I.
I was just sinking into his thoughts when the door burst open and fell on the floor.
The whole day, of 25th , he was absent from the house. The doorbell rang exactly at seven in the evening. I was very annoyed at him but when I saw him…..
years. You hardly ever use it. Brother dear, you’re missing the obvious, for once.”
you brought her. It’ll give us a chance to see how the girls get on.” John was still trying not to stare. She’d had a jumper on in the picture that had hidden the bright tattoos sleeving both her arms.
: (23 April, late evening)
it. The kid’s standin’ right here sayin’ her Mum did it, but she’s got an alibi, and three people backing her story up.” Greg ground his teeth in frustration. Cases involving children were always rough, but this was hard to handle, even for him. “And tell John to get Mary down here. I could use her help.” Greg hung up the mobile, resisting the urge to kick the nearest object.
Fenris struggled to get a better grip on the dragon’s throat as the water around them boiled, scalding patches of fur from him. Ignoring the pain, he bit into the scaly skin. He knew he’d be unable to penetrate the beast’s hide, but he could still crush its throat with the strength of his jaws. The water wasn’t nearly as deep as he’d hoped, and he struggled to stay on top of it, using his greater weight to keep its head under the shallow water. His forelegs wrapped around its body, pinning its wings while he desperately kicked at its hind legs, trying to keep it from disemboweling him with its rear claws. He clamped his jaws tighter as he felt the pain of its claws raking across his belly. For long minutes, they fought in the murky water, each seeking to destroy the other.
“You were able to let Lucifer in your head. Would it help if I fucked you while we’re working?” Loki snorted.
“Seriously?”
“Yes, well, don’t give him any ideas.” He grinned ruefully. “He finds enough of those on the internet.”
“Ah. No, it’s not taboo. It’s quite legal here, though some do still discriminate against those of us who are gay.”
“No, nothing like that. And before you ask, everything is secure at Sherrinford.”
“Oh, is that today? I’d forgotten. Unfortunately, John and I have other plans…”
“So, you wanna talk to me about bein’ barmy?” Greg chuckled softly. He should feel a little guilty, shocking her like this, but he didn’t. He knew she’d been concerned, but her calling Anderson to ask about Mycroft had irritated him.
just a moment. Mycroft had been vulnerable and he might feel differently now. Greg decided the best course of action was to just bring it up. They had a crisis to face, and they didn’t need sexual tension getting in the way. Getting it out in the open and out of the way would be best. Mycroft would probably turn him down, shredding him emotionally in the process. He’d watched Sherlock do it so many times to Molly that it seemed a natural response to expect from his brother, and Greg tried to prepare himself for what he assumed would be inevitable. He wasn’t the type of man to press his attentions when they weren’t wanted, so once he knew Mycroft wasn’t interested, he’d be able to put it out of his mind. Then he’d suggest they never bring it up again, give him the files, and they’d be able to get on with work.
older than he looks. He’s the God of Wolves. And yes, the three of them are a… family, of sorts. It’s complicated.”
“I’m a doctor. Why do you ask?”
“Christ”, he muttered. “You dropped by Baker street.”
“Because I love him is why. It’s not a mid-life crisis and I’m not gonna change my mind. He’s a good man, Dad. A really good man.”
. He’s my…” He paused, choosing the proper fairy term to imply the importance of their relationship. “…mate.”
“You’re not supposed to be here.” A dark-haired young woman sat casually beside him at the bar. He could sense the power in her, and he knew instinctively that she was Death personified. He’d never seen anyone more beautiful in his life, and his heart leapt in a type of excitement that he’d seldom felt in his life. It was as close to love as he could ever come. “I’d take you, if I could.”
: (19 April, early afternoon, thirty minutes later)
“What secret lover?” Mary laughed gently. “Do you mean Irene Adler?”
“Just don’t make any assumptions, John. He may or may not be evil. We can’t base our assumptions on what’s written about him, and I suspect he wouldn’t be welcome in the Court of Oberon if he were evil.”
“What kind?” Greg raised an eyebrow, wondering if he looked as anywhere near as rumpled and thoroughly fucked as John. Neither John nor Sherlock were wine drinkers, so they obviously had some company that evening. He had a good idea who it was.
fairy, actually.” John watched it settle on Sherlock’s shoulder, flashing its wings.
“Well, like I said, he’s really formal. He seems kinda… I dunno, intimidating at first, but he’s been really good to me. He really loves Uncle Greg a lot.”
“Why can’t you tell me what’s happening? Why are you trying to send us away? Is it some kind of…” Peter glanced at his grandson and lowered his voice to a whisper. “…gay orgy of some sort that this Mycroft is having?”
“Yeah?” He grinned with amusement and looked over at Mycroft. His lover was moaning with pleasure and watching in fascination as Greg fucked Fenris with his fingers. “You want that big beautiful cock in you, Fenris?”
“Then they already know you’re bisexual?”
“Yes, well… Perhaps we’re
“That may also be partly my fault. Perhaps if we tried it without my drinking from you, it might go better. It does tend to have a rather powerful effect, and I may have underestimated it. Also, it has been a while for you, since you last had sex, hasn’t it?”
“Beauty is a…” Like his brother before him, Sherlock had that moment where, for the first time, he saw his beloved through the eyes of love. He looked at John, eyes wide with awe, running his hand alongside his face. “…
“Technically yes, but he’s strong enough to upset the balance of power in most realms, and that can cause all sorts of unforeseen problems. His father’s in Jotunheim, or what’s left of it, anyway; you could perhaps send him there, but you really
“Yeah, well I thought Fenris was gonna cause a scene in the pet store when he told the clerk the rabbits looked delicious.” Greg laughed. “And the treat aisle, when he kept sampling things.”
Still muttering, Lestrade turns around and walks over  to Jack who is still passed out on the floor. The poor D.I is obviously on the brink of breakdown, exhaustion and worry clearly etched in the lines of his face. John feels remorse for only a second for his part in it, before it dissipates entirely. He couldn't and wouldn't have reacted any differently.
Lestrade clears his throat awkwardly, somehwere behind John.
John is so enthralled he misses the arm flying out to hit Sherlock in the face. He falls back with a cry, hand cupping his jaw and were it not for the pillar he happened to lean against he'd be toppled over on the ground. He leans down a bit, ruffling the potted plants surrounding the granite pillar.
at him wrong again.. I'm going to fuck up your life, you cunting piece of shit. I'm going to grind all those arrogant bones in your face to a pulp and take a picture afterwards.'
scoffs and seems to ignore the gasps of their audience.
To be successful, both props must be extremely strong in the neck, shoulders, upper body and legs, and they should relish head-to-head competition.
There's something about this Sherlock character that intrigues him tremendously. John's not one to ignore his instincts and also, the doctor and soldier in him can't bear to see violence inflicted upon the helpless, impaired or young. This young man is a drug addict that much is certain, and yet to John's eyes, there are hidden depths to him and also a vulnerability he tries very hard to hide. It shouts at John and his protective instincts flare up and propel him out of his chair to grasp Victor's wrist just in time and twist just enough as to stop him but cause no damage.
John's had enough. He smiles a thin, polite but sharp smile as he takes a sip of his wine, clearing his throat a little. He feels Sherlock's alarmed eyes on his face. Gerrick  raises a questioning eyebrow at John, Lisa watching on.
Along with the hooker, the loose-head and tight-head props make up what is known as the front row, which refers to their position in the scrum. (taken from http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/positions.html)
The consultive pain in the arse grunts as he finally pushes the door open and Lestrade was just about to open his mouth when it hits them and they all stop in their tracks.
Lestrade turns around just in time to widen his eyes purposefully at Donovan who looks like she might protest, but she catches on and turns towards the stairs, Anderson following hurriedly and without protest.
Sherlock giggles darkly from where he's sat with his head in John's lap on the sofa. John smiles, fingers carding through Sherlock's hair as they both remember the day Sherlock and Mycroft met Jane Watson, the Alpha of the Watson pack.
- This iss a surprisse. I susspected your ssexuality crisis to last
The DI hopes this will finally push the two idiots in the right direction.
They both groan at the feeling and the smell of sex in the air which is now thick enough to taste.
Their gazing is interrupted by Greg who shoves his gun back in it's holder and handcuffs the struggling murderer.
But his eyes are wet and luminous, and there's an unbearable warmth in them that makes John's heart hurt with love for this man. Without informing his brain, his hand makes its way to Sherlock's face, gently cupping his injured cheek. The detective's face leans into it, gaze never losing his.
The song changes to a song Lestrade doesn't recognize and doesn't care about because John suddenly changes to triple claps push ups.
It's a standoff, John's blood is pumping in his veins, arms in a chokehold around Moriarty's neck, behind him.
'Jawn, please jAWN' Thrice. John growls and grabs Sherlock's hair again, pulling his head around in order to lick at his mouth, hips never stopping their thrusting.
The taller man leans back against him, head turning around, eyes still closed in pleasure. John tilts his head up and gently kisses each lip separately, before kissing his nose.
Sherlock's legs disappear suddenly, leaving John's cold in their absence, and he clears his throat as he rises from his seat, gesturing to the stairs with his chin. John nods and they make their excuses.
God but he drives John mad, he's like a damned cat from the way he moves to the way he talks and purrs, for God's sake.
Lestrade relents and soon enough John and Sherlock find themselves in the back of a black sedan sent by Mycroft, squeezed very closely together.
Luckily Mrs. Hudson is home from visiting her sister in France, which means she might be persuaded to watch Sherlock tomorrow while he's at work. John shakes his head, smiling to himself as he waits for the lights to go green. Mrs. Hudson won't need any persuasion, she'll take one look at Sherlock and she'll start clucking around him like the mother hen she is.
Second, I've changed usernames. Used to be 'LadyOfTheWindDweller', I'm now 'rejectbaboon'. :) Don't ask why, but tell me, which one sounds more stupid? haha.
He's alluding of course, to Gerrick's dissimilarity to the rest of the Holmes. Not the sharpest crayon in the box, bit not like the rest of the Holmes flock.
'Now enough is enough. Listen here, Mycroft Holmes you
Sherlock takes a couple of hesitant steps, grimy face scrunched adorably. John can't help a fond smile. He's in trouble.
The house welcomes them in, and John turns to watch Sherlock take it in.
Mummy Holmes's eyes have turned a bit teary, and she smiles broadly at John, making him blush and smile back proudly.
John slowly turns his head, giving the prick a shapr death glare from across the table. 'Excuse me?'
The doctor inhales the crisp night air and for a moment ignores the young man, who's eyes he can feel on the side of his face.
And then hurricane Sherlock Holmes happened, and really, one would assume he'd be used to this by now. Well, sur-bloody-prise, he isn't. John would like to see anyone's reaction to finding their flatmate's emptied a new jar of strawberry jam in order to grow mould cultures inside.
Water under the bridge now anyway. His and Sherlock's friendship has been slowly but surely healing under both of their tender care. It feels like decades have passed and so much has happened, but at their core, they haven't change. No, actually they have. But for the better.
'- come Lisa, don't make Sherly uncomfortable. You know he doesn't like joining the 'flock' like everyone else. We mustn't ask him about relationships, poor duck'. Gerrick's voice is also really annoying, and hang on, did he just call Sherlock an ugly duckling. Across the table, Sherlock's face is impassive and sculpted in ice, resolutely not staring at anyone and anything except the last dregs of chocolate mousse he's very intently spooning off his bowl.
Take that Irene. Begged twice.
And then it happens anway, because Moriarty laughs like the cowardly dog he is, and the red dot on
Sigh.
'God you're hot. You're the hottest piece of ass in this town and you're.all.mine.' Having said that, John presses the weeping head of his cock between Sherlock's cheeks and proceeds to rut back and forth, dragging precome all over.
' - stop acting like a child, it is time to grow up and face your responsibilities. You cannot continue living this farce of a life.'
But, of course, weeks later once all the Moriarty business is over and done with, Mycroft personally delivers an unlabelled disk to them, a tight expression lingering still on his face.
Sherlock had meanwhile helped John to his feet and is now sitting very close to the doctor, left hand fisted in the back of John's jumper in a very possesive hold, much to John's surprise and pleasure.
'I leave you alone for one minute..' John half smiles, but it isn't really there. His eyes are glued to the purplish bruised on the detective's alabaster neck, and those swollen lips..
.' There's a desperation swirling in Sherlock's eyes and growing in his voice, and John's blood sings in his veins and they're almost touching from head to toe and he doesn't know when that happened.
The killer makes to punch him but John deflects with his left arm, rapidly moving in to strike a cutting jab to the man's throat with his left hand when the other's off balance. The man's breath cuts off and he bends down to cough, grasping at his throat. John grips his shoulders to bring him towards him and delivers two powerful knees to his abdomen and an elbow to the man's spine, bringing him down.
The two brothers blink at him in their Holmesian way they do when entirely astonished.
"I told you it's over, Sherlock." Says curtly the man in the suit. "I'm not funding your drug addiction anymore!." He clears his throat and straightens his shimmering coat.
John had received a picture from Lestrade Friday night when he'd just arrived in Edinburgh. In the picture, Sherlock looked like a deer caught in headlights, a rosey tint to his cheeks while a massive bear of a man was  over the detective, looking besotted. They.were.also.shaking.hands.
Jumper clad arms stretch and clasp on the edge of the counter, caging a very startled detective in between. His hungry body hovers just a hair's breath away from those silky forms, just enough to tease them both, glutton for punishment that he is. His head moves like a lion scenting another, from a pink ear to a delightfully sharp jaw, to that inviting sweet mole on a pale long neck. Sherlock's breath is heavy and sweet, he smells like posh shower gel, tea and chocolate digestives. And a strong masculine musk that makes John's cock twitch and release precum.
His energy flips around in under a second, going from aggresiveness to intense arousal. He can feel his pulse beat in his cock, now fully hard and straining against the zipper on his jeans.
"Your bloody face says otherwise. As does your withdrawal by the way."
John's eyes glint at the perfect opportunity and he smirks, 'I'm sure you can
John's had an exhausting day. From children spewing on his shoes, Mary the pervy nurse with her incessant flirting and Sarah's disapproving stare for having been late again, he couldn't have been more glad to step into 221B.
Well, moving on.
'Uh..boss, shoudln't we call an ambulance or somethin'? Donovan interjected.
It transpires that the following year after that disastruos affair with Mary, Sherlock and his family, John and Sherlock are once again invited to spend Christmas with the rest of the Holmes family. The doctor had been unsure and uneasy at first, but caved in the face of Violet's eyes, which were as cunning and sharp but also capable of inflicting their will upon their 'oponnents' as Sherlock's.
Lisa lets loose a couple of giggles, grating on John's nerves, and Gerrick unfortunately, especially for himself he'll soon come to know, keeps on flapping his mouth.
John's forgotten about his date completely. He thinks he feels a tug but he disregards it, completely tuned in on the developments to his left. He notices he's shifted his body forward, as if to intervene, although why he'd do that he has no idea. There's some instinct trying to tell him something, but he's too preoccupied to figure it out right now.
'That was good..that was, John.
They'd never been in the same room together since, not even when Harold Watson had died.
Linda, Lisa? leans across the table and shoves her phone in his face. John flinches and covers up by gently plucking the phone only to stare numbly in the eyes of a demon tabby. He takes the opportunity to wonder whether he'd picked up his laundry already or if he needs to stop by on his way home. He muses, probably too late for that now.
Coming to a silent decision, they all start climbing the stairs to see what's going on.
Sherlock smirks, lips parting, eyes widening slightly the way he does when he deduces something. Or when he's smug.
BAMF John. Possessive John. Protective John. Filthy John. Really filthy, NSFW porn.
, Victor, is already on her third this evening, seventh this week," the blonde-haired woman gasps, "and needs no help in embarrassing herself. Why, just this morning she took the tube back from her latest late night
John had meanwhile also dropped his, and he now places Sherlock's hands so that they're exended and flat against the door, and the clever detective gets the idea and leans over, pushing his delectable arse out towards John who groans at the sight.
And with that he steps back, spine ramrod straight as he does a military step around and makes the few feet to Sherlock's side, leaving Mycroft to fall to the floor with another pained cry.
His brave boy, John really - no, now's not the time for that. Not conductive to keeping his cool.
The young man finally makes it around the car and steps in. John slides his window up to preserve some heat for the shivering figure next to him.
John smirks and continuing to move his hips he also brings his left hand up to fist in those devilishly soft curls. Sherlcok gives a guttural moan and laughs shakily when his head is pulled back, long neck stretched and there for John to finally kiss and ruin with his mouth. Travelling up to lick at his jaw, ignoring the brat's attempt to turn his head and capture his lips, John strecthes up on his tiptoes to mouth at and breath over that pink, delectable ear and to whisper..
'Don't look at me like that, you tiny piece of shit.' John's aware this is really, really inapproptiate at the Christmas dinner table, but he's not entirely sure the way Sherlock's squeezing his hand is to stop him or encourage him and he's to incenssed to stop. He's donned his captain persona and that little prick needs a dressing down and proper training.
