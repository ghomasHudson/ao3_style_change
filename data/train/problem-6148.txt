But what Steve discovered, as he and Tony began the long, arduous path of grieving the loss of their son, was that there really was no 'proper' way to mourn. There was only their way.
After taking a shower that was so burning hot he could barely stand it, Steve shuffled his way into the kitchen, quickly whipping up a half a dozen scrambled eggs and a large stack of homemade pancakes. His notes from the night before were still scattered across the kitchen table as he sat down, pouring syrup over his steaming hot pancakes as he shuffled through the various pages that, according to Bucky, closely resembled football play diagrams.
"Hey, Pep," Tony said fondly. "Just wanted to let you know that Steve and I will be taking Pete and the team to Italy during the week of Pete's spring break, so if the Board members feel like seeing my face they'll have to do it some other time. Oh, and I'll be sure to have the next round of tablet specs done before we leave, if that helps."
“Well, I sure don’t mind him hanging out with me in the afternoons,” Steve said.  His steps slowed as they walked past a line of some of the most snazzy-looking vehicles he had ever seen, including a mouth-watering 2012 FLHR Harley Davidson Road King that was in such impeccable condition that Steve wondered if it had ever been driven.
Of course, that had been Peter's very argument for trying to remain in the lab, pleading with Tony that he could somehow help and finally forcing Tony to pull out the "because I said so" card that he always kept hidden deep inside his back pocket, in the hopes that he wouldn't have to use it.
Tony jumped as Fury slammed his palm onto the desk before leaning forward, almost like he was trying to crawl through the screen.  “Goddamnit, Tony!  With the unbalance in that area it’d be a suicide mission!  Think of your son!”
Uncle Bucky's voice trailed off then, and he looked down at his metal hand, flexing his fingers. "Before the serum he thought that his asthma would kill him by the time he was thirty, which probably wasn't too far off. It's one reason why he was so damn insistent about enlistin'; he figured if he was gonna die young that he may as well die doing somethin' that he thought was worthy." He paused again, shooting Peter an odd look. "And then afterwards… well… Back then, the time when we came from, it—it wasn't allowed, without a wife, or—he would've been—"
"Because I'd like to know if it could be used again, on someone else," Steve answered. "More specifically, on a kid."
Steve’s blindness to Brock had translated to abject denial that his shoulder was as messed-up as it was, and that denial ended up costing him everything.
I wouldn't be able to survive, not without them, so…" He paused, scrubbing at his eyes with his palm. "I was so used to being alone, to handling everything on my own, but now… now I know I couldn't live without them. I just couldn't. And after Miami, and everything that's been happening lately, it's just… it's like someone's trying to tell me that I don't deserve them or something, and I just—"
"1900 hours," Uncle James answered. "So I'm gonna head back up to the base now and see how Tony's doing. I'll let you know as soon as I know something."
"You know that won't work, Dad," Peter said softly. "Besides, no one else knows how to do this stuff, so if you don't do it then who will?"
The second trip was much better, finding Steve watching as he, Tony, and Peter frolicked on the beach during their spring break trip to Italy, about a month before he was arrested by HYDRA. Despite what had happened afterwards, that trip ranked up there amongst Steve's very favourite times with his husband and son, as even though the rest of the team had accompanied them, Steve and Tony were able to spend so much quality time together that it had felt like they were on a second honeymoon.
"No, I am absolutely positive that I did not know that," she said. "And where in the world did you hear it?"
"I hate that it's come to this," he said quietly. "All the suspicions, not knowing who you can trust. I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since during the war, and I don't like it, Tony. I really don't."
Sam gave a shrug, downing his second glass of whisky so fast the waitress barely had a chance to set it down.
repeat. At first, Tony had tried to insist that he fly them up to the Compound on his suit, but while Steve could tolerate being carried by Tony for short distances, he'd never learned to enjoy it for longer than a couple of minutes and quickly vetoed that idea. After a quick conference with Clint and Natasha, who assured Steve and Tony multiple times that the attack had ceased following the two initial impacts and that both Peter and Gwen had been found alive, they decided to collect George Stacy from his home and fly up in the Quinjet, arriving at their upstate facility in record time.
"So, Uncle Sam's offered to cook dinner for us tonight," Papa said as he drove out onto the street. "He and Bucky are coming up around six if that's okay with you."
"Yeah, okay," Sam said after a pause of several beats, shaking his head in Steve's direction. "Well, sorry there, Cap, but seeing as how that was our last ball, unless you feel like hurtling the fence to go get 'em we're gonna have to call it a day."
Swallowing hard, Tony turned back to Gamora, now sobbing on her knees over Quill's ashes. Clutching Peter impossibly tighter, he took one step towards her, halted in his tracks when Peter sucked in a sharp breath.
Finally, it was time for the vows, with Steve clearing his throat as he looked deep into Tony's eyes. Through his peripheral vision he could see Peter, his smile so wide that it threatened to split his sweet face.
Tony shook his head, shuddering as he pressed his face into his pillow. "Loving me is a losing game, honey," he murmured. "Better to quit while you're ahead."
"I'm pretty sure you're right," said Sam. "Now, if we're all done talking here, I'm ready to get going."
Watching Peter step through a magical portal from another planet, along with all of the others who had been snapped with him, just like it had never even happened.
After not even three months, he had grown so used to having Steve there in the bed with him, grown so used to having his warm, solid body pressed up against him and his arm draped across his waist, that the thought of having to sleep alone was… well, it was just not okay.
Dad rolled his eyes, glowering at Dr Strange's back as the wizard turned a corner, out of sight. Then he turned to Peter and raised his right hand, tapping him first on his left shoulder, then on his right, almost like he was knighting him.
Tipping his head back, Doctor List let out a laugh, one so stereotypically evil that Steve could’ve sworn he had stepped straight out of one of Peter’s movies.
"The news said this area hadn't had snow for New Year's in almost ten years," Steve said as he settled into his chair next to Tony. "So I say we got lucky."
Having his father disappear right in front of his eyes, leaving him stranded on a dying planet with a bunch of goofy strangers?
Tony paused to switch out his slide, his eyes dragging along the pilots sitting in the front row until they came upon the blond-haired, blue-eyed man sitting directly left of centre. With his broad shoulders, strong, muscular arms, and expertly sculpted cheekbones, the guy was the perfect poster-boy for Langaran Air Corps recruitment.
All Tony knew for sure was that he had never felt so helpless in his entire life.  Not even the awful half a year after Regina’s deception was discovered, and he was regularly getting peeled out of muddy ditches in Jersey after trashing nightclubs, compared to this.
“Shit!  That’s hot!” he hissed as he shook the scalding droplets from his fingers, sucking his middle finger into his mouth.
Outside it was bright and sunny, the vast city filled with all of the sounds and smells of early spring, such a sharp contrast to the violent thunderstorm raging inside Steve's mind and heart. He offered Tony his arm as they stepped onto the sidewalk at the foot of the Tower, absentmindedly heading up the street in the direction of Peter's school.
"Yes, something like that, but he has plenty of experience as a regular cat burglar too," said Papa. "And JARVIS also told us that he has a young daughter, one he hasn't been allowed to see since his release from prison."
"Good. Now, why don't you head on back to bed, okay? I'm guessing there's someone there who might be waiting for you."
Plunking himself down onto his chair, Tony reached for the phone, his left hand slowly curling into a tight fist as he not-so-patiently listened to the five messages left by various members of the Air Corps leadership, all requesting—
So… maybe this could actually be a good thing.  While Steve knows he can’t really pour his guts out to a thirteen-year-old kid, at least the kid might be able to distract Steve enough to keep him from constantly dwelling on his problems.
"Soon as he gets the stone," Steve added. A bolt of pain shot across the knuckles on his right hand, forcing him to slowly flex his fingers. "We have to wait until he gets the stone."
"Captain Rogers' heart rate and blood pressure are both quite elevated, sir," answered JARVIS. "As are yours."
"Hey, Stevie!" Bucky called from across the room, sitting across from Sam and waving like a dummy. "'Bout time you showed up!"
"Uh huh!" Peter answered as both he and the chariot slammed down to the ground, with Peter launching another web barely a second later. "You don't have to worry about me!"
"Okay, but we should wait until Tony wakes up," Steve said quickly. "I don't want him to miss anything."
Peter gulped, refusing to meet Papa's eyes in the rearview mirror and staring instead at the passenger seat in front of him. "Well… we were kinda hoping that we could go see a movie a week from Saturday. There's a theatre that's only a block away from her dad's precinct, and I was gonna ask if Uncle Bucky could come with us, you know, kinda as a guard/ chaperone so you guys would hopefully be a little less twitchy about it, so… do you think that'd be okay?"
"Hey, Sharon," Steve said as he arrived on the paediatric floor, smiling fondly at the pretty, blonde-haired nurse sitting at the nurses' station. "How're you doing today?"
"We've got Bruce and our personal physician standing by, so once we're able to get him out I'm sure she'll be able to get him fixed up in no time."
Gwen let out a giggle as they stepped through the doors and onto the parking lot. Peter immediately drew up the sleeve of his jacket, discretely activating the heater in his Spider-Man suit. So far the winter had been a particularly brutal one, and since the school apparently didn't take Peter's rather unique body temperature regulation—or rather, his complete lack thereof—when they set the heaters for their buildings, he had on more than a few occasions had to text Dad or Papa and ask them to bring him an extra hoodie so he didn't freeze to death during the school day. After the third or fourth time, Peter had finally brought up the idea of wearing his Spider-Man suit under his clothes so he could take advantage of the built-in heater. Dad and Papa had of course hemmed and hawed about it but finally decided it was a good idea, just as long as he was very careful to not allow it to be seen.
Tony moaned as one of Steve's fingers slowly pushed inside him, followed quickly by a second. Despite the rubdown that Steve had given him he was still so tense with desire that he thought he might explode, grappling at Steve's neck to pull him down for another deep kiss. "You think I'm about to let you go off to space now that you've gone and said something like that? That is positively the hottest goddamn thing you've ever said to me!"
—certainly wouldn't have chosen to completely disobey his dads by refusing to return home during an alien invasion.
"Half that time," Phillips cut in. "Yeah I get it." The colonel leaned back in his chair, letting out a heavy sigh. "I'm sorry, Tony, but unless something weird happens that's the best we're gonna be able to do. General O'Brien was adamant that we only convert three of the aircraft over to the vibranium cores, so…"
"Ahh, yes, that's right," Steve said, barely catching his frown before it could form. It was a bit unnerving that a supposedly reclusive monarch seemed to know so much information about them, not to mention that singling out Peter within the first few minutes of their meeting was not going to go over well with Tony, who was no doubt already listening in. "My son is sixteen years old."
There was a short pause while the UI pondered the question. "I believe the interface is working, sir. It is simply a problem of your eyes being unable to process the imagery the interface is sending you."
“I’m pretty sure Director Fury doesn't share your sentiments, sweetheart,” Steve said as he fastened his cowl into place.  “And I will have backup.  The entire STRIKE team’s gonna be standing by, waiting for my signal.”
"Oh, great. That's great," Scott said. "'Cause I just remembered that I probably should give Cassie a call and let her know that I got here, and—"
"Yeah, actually, I did," Rogers said. "I… um… well… you just said yourself that you're usually working late, so… I was thinking that maybe if you wanted to that we—you and I could maybe get something to eat together sometime? The officers' mess closes every night before the blackout starts but they always have self-serve food available for the evening and night shift patrol crews so… if you wanted… um… Does that sound like something you'd be interested in, maybe?"
"I'm thinking this might be even more than several boatloads," he whispered as he pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead. "But I promise I'll be right here with you the whole time. No matter what you need."
Steve's jaw twitched, his gaze dropping to his lap. "We were just discussing the mission, along with all of its ramifications," he said quietly. He brought his hand to the back of Tony's neck, digging his fingertips so deliciously into Tony's sore, tight muscles that Tony had to stifle a groan of pleasure. "I wanted to make sure that no one had any objections to what we're planning to do."
“Yeah, yeah, she’s all fed and watered,” said Peter.  “I left a note for Andrea too, so she doesn’t forget to keep the door cracked open.”
"Uh huh," Peter said softly. He knew Papa was right, that they could only concentrate on what was right in front of them. But he also knew that knowing Papa, he was already trying to plan for every possible contingency. Which meant that if Thanos had somehow managed to open a wormhole between parallel universes, the Avengers would have to somehow close it back up again or Thanos' army could literally go on forever.
He had just climbed into the backseat of Sam's car when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out, dread washing over him like a wave as he read Tony's text, accompanied by a link to a breaking news headline.
Because, like it or not, there was no way Peter could just sit by and watch his family suffer through yet another massive fight threat hanging over their heads. Not when he'd almost lost his Papa during the last one.
voice that he'd had perfected for almost as long as he could talk. Even his puppy dog eyes were blazing in full force, testing Tony's already thin patience.
"Yeah, not now Pete," Dad said hoarsely, rummaging around in the mass of papers next to him. "I need to… um… I need to find—"
If he had just gotten rid of Obie when he'd first thought about it, not too long after he had brought Peter home from the hospital, then maybe none of this would've happened. But he had been too afraid, too worried about possibly jeopardizing the company—and Peter's inheritance—that he didn't want to rock the boat. Despite all of his faults, Obie was a decent enough CFO, and Tony hadn't wanted to make any major changes to the company's infrastructure while he was still learning how to parent a very high-needs baby.
"Rhodey," said Colonel Rhodes. "Or James, if you would prefer that, but please, Steve, don't call me Colonel Rhodes when we're off duty. I don't wanna feel like you're gonna salute me every time you talk to me."
"Well, maybe once you buy the ring it'll just come to you," Steve said. He peeked at his timepiece, his belly swooping when he saw it was already 2045. "Um… I've gotta get going so… you still think I look okay?"
Which meant that he had to sneak into Dad's lab, grab his extra bottles of web fluid, then sneak downstairs to the lab and get it up and running again all before he was supposed to wake up for school.
"Well, that's only because we both love you," said Steve. He cupped Tony's jaw, angling it down so he could kiss him. "I'm gonna make you some breakfast now, okay?"
"I have!" Steve blurted out, shivering as a cold sweat broke out across his body. "I-I mean, I saw—I saw—
It was that reason that Steve and Tony had refused Peter's numerous requests to officially join the Avengers. While they were both impressed by Peter's abilities as Spider-Man, the name he'd coined for himself after his genetic mutation was discovered, participating in closed training sessions with the team was a far cry from going on an actual mission. Steve and Tony had informed Peter that once he turned eighteen they would reevaluate his position on the team, and while Peter hadn't been very pleased with that decision, as far as Steve and Tony were concerned, it was final.
"No!" Peter gasped, ducking his head against his knees in a futile attempt to block out the memories suddenly flooding his mind. A graveyard with Dad and Papa's gravestones crumbling into dust. Auntie Nat's broken, lifeless body. Uncle Clint losing control.
"Twenty? How in the hell are there still that many?" Tony cried. "We've already taken out at least a dozen of 'em, and—"
"What the hell…?" Dad muttered under his breath as Antennae Lady started jumping up and down in the lower gravity, a wide, childish smile on her face. "I sure hope Thor hurries his ass up, we could definitely use the help."
"That's 'cause he's the strongest of us," Steve said, wincing as Peter's grip on his hand tightened even further. "No one else could've resisted this. No one."
"Yeah, pretty much," Tony said with a shrug. "At least until I turned thirteen and got tested. I still mostly taught myself after that though."
Maybe he would be a bit more courageous once they were out from under his dads'—and JARVIS's—eyes, and he could just flat-out ask Gwen how she felt about him.
"Then why the hell is his date for the dance here without him?" Tony snapped. "What the hell do they want?"
But now that synergistic system was missing its Captain, and Tony knew without a doubt that there was no way it would ever be the same again unless they found him.
"JARVIS, also add Mr Scott Lang to the SI payroll as a consultant in cyber security. Monthly salary of… what, ten thousand should be enough to live on in San Fran, shouldn't it?"
“Oh, God.  I can’t even imagine,” Dad choked out, his eyes filling with tears.  “No wonder he wants to forget.”
“It’s okay, honey,” Tony murmured as he kissed the frown line between Steve’s eyebrows, a line he had so lovingly decreed as his ‘worry wrinkle’.  “I’m right here.  I’ve got you.  You can tell me anything.”
"Peter, another time, okay?" Papa said, giving Peter's hair a ruffle. "In fact, why don't you come and help me get dinner started while Dad works on Uncle Thor's new eye, okay?"
The pain he had endured from losing Peter, the pain that he and Steve had struggled for an entire year to contain, was something that Tony wouldn't wish on anyone.
"He's choking on his endotracheal tube, Mr Stark!" Sharon said firmly as Steve drew Tony back a few steps. "If you'll just give me a couple seconds to remove it, he should be fine."
Wanda's lower lip shook as glanced around, making sure she couldn't be overheard. "Yes," she whispered, almost conspiratorially. "Ever since they killed my father."
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💕
A flush crept up Ned's tanned cheeks as he let out a slight cough. "Oh, she—she's good. We—you know, we're—we're hanging out… some, and—"
"Should be," answered Dad, his fingers carding through Peter's hair. "Pete said he threw up pretty quick afterwards, so I'm hoping that some of it is gone already. The rest is just supportive care until he can metabolise it all."
"All right, little guy, take this carefully," Steve said as he handed Peter a stick of cinnamon. Still overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices in the grocery store spice aisle, Steve preferred to stick with what he knew as much as possible. Which meant buying actual cinnamon sticks and grating the amount that he needed instead of relying on the powdered stuff that seemed to be preferred now.
Peter grinned, curling his arm around her waist. "That's okay," he said softly. "I'm not Force-sensitive either."
"Look, bud, I didn't mean to snap at you, okay?" Tony said gently. "I think we'll all feel a lot better once this is over."
“Maybe I should’ve taken Tony up on his offer,” he muttered as he slowed to a stop behind a particularly bushy tree.  He narrowed his eyes as he leaned closer, cocking his head as he heard what appeared to be a high-pitched, barely-discernible buzzing sound, well out of the hearing range of a non-enhanced person.  Steve looked up at the top of the tree, not seeing anything that would indicate an explosive or other type of incendiary device, but unless the tree had been genetically altered to give off a noise, it definitely seemed to be booby-trapped.
“Researching?  Researching what?” Dad asked, his eyes going wide as he skimmed the document displayed on Peter’s monitor.  “Explodable bullets?  Pete, where the hell’d you find this?”
"Stevie? You okay over there?" Bucky said as he knocked on the metal wall separating their shower stalls, pulling Steve from his thoughts. "You haven't drowned, have you?"
"Yeah, can't imagine why?" Rhodey grumbled as he pushed himself up to his feet. "I'm gonna get you some food too, all right? Just so the coffee doesn't eat through your stomach?"
“Yeah, that all depends on who you ask, buddy,” Tony says.  Then he winks at Steve, sending warmth blooming across Steve’s chest that’s so sudden and so shocking that Steve nearly chokes on his own spit.
The tiny ripping noise of a popped stitch momentarily caught Peter's attention, and he looked down to see that he'd nearly poked his thumb right through the fabric on the back of his jacket. He quickly slid it on, taking extra care to draw the zipper up slowly as he struggled to come up with an appropriate response that didn't sound idiotic.
"Yeah, but by helping us she'd be risking arrest," Tony pointed out. "You think she'd be willing to do that?"
"I am unsure, Master Peter. Perhaps it would be best to ask Sergeant Barnes that question yourself?"
"No, don't be making any promises that you can't keep," Tony warned, stifling a yawn. "But I still hope that you're right."
Which suited Steve just fine. Peter had been eleven already when Steve first met him, and he was in no hurry for the boy to grow up any faster than he already was. He wanted to enjoy as much time with Peter as he could before he really grew up and left home.
Tony knew that when he pulled Stark Industries out of the weapons business it had created a pretty big void in the market, one that any number of companies would likely jump at the chance to fill. He just never thought the military would be stupid enough to…
"Uhh, no." Tony honestly didn't have a specific time that he woke up since he was usually just passed out in his office anyway. "Simulator sessions don't start for another two hours, so…"
Grandma's lower lip began to shake, something that Papa's also did when he was upset. "I couldn't—I couldn't take the chance," she whispered. She jerked her head in the direction of the poster. "All his life, Steven just wanted to serve his country, like his papa. He never even got to meet his papa, and yet Joseph was still Steven's hero. Every night when he was little he would tell me that he couldn't wait to get better so he could fly the aircraft like the ones in the poster. The same aircraft that Joseph flew. And there was no way I was going to tarnish any thoughts that he had of his papa. No possible way."
Steve sniffed, whispering a quick, "Thank you" as Bucky threw his metal arm around Peter's shoulders and guided him over to the table, where a nurse was waiting to treat him.
“Oh, you are most welcome,” says Mags.  She digs her fingertips into Tony’s shoulder, giving him a friendly shake.  “Your food will be out in a jiffy.  Make sure to eat it while it’s hot!”
"Nothing wrong with girls," Tony mumbled into Steve's uniform, which definitely needed a good wash. "Especially one whose idea of a good first date involves introducing the boy to her parents."
"Really?" Ned said, his face lighting up so much that Peter felt a stab of guilt. Ned had been his best friend since elementary school, but ever since he and Gwen got together, he had been spending most of his limited free time with her. It had been fine when Ned was dating their classmate Betty, but apparently they decided to take a so-called "break" once the school year started and never ended up getting back together. At least, if the fact that Peter never saw Betty too far away from Brad Davis had anything to do with it."
“Is that okay?” Steve breathed as he kissed his way up Tony’s jaw, pausing before he got to his mouth.  “I—I know it’s late, but I was thinking… if you're not too tired, that I’d—I’d like to—”
"Regardless of who can actually access this place," said Steve. "You do believe that Thor is correct? That this Soul Stone might be tied in somehow to your Ancestral Plane?"
"I concur," Steve answered, squinting as he searched for anything they might have missed. "Looks like we got 'em all."
A soft smile stretched across Papa's lips, and he reached for Peter's hand, giving it a light squeeze. "Sometimes I forget just how perceptive you are, little guy," he said. "Don't ever lose that, okay? Empathy is so important, and so many people seem to have forgotten that."
"Captain Rogers will be exiting the atmosphere in exactly five seconds, sir," JARVIS said. "Four… three… two… one… enter. Reacquisition of radio signal will occur in approximately forty-five seconds."
Removing his earpiece, Steve poked his head out of his simulator cockpit, smiling as he caught Tony's eye. So far, and despite Bucky's frequent teasing and innuendos, he and Tony had managed to keep things mostly professional during their simulator sessions. It had not been easy, though, especially since simply hearing Tony's soothing voice through his earpiece was often enough to get Steve aroused.
"All right, let's cut the chatter out there, guys," Steve said, even as he couldn't help but smile at the playful banter. It was just one of the innumerable things that he loved about Tony.
Peter made a frustrated noise. What was it about grownups and their goofy ideas when it came to the people they loved?
Tucking a pillow under Tony's hips, Steve reached next for a condom, with Tony stopping his hand before he could tear it open.
Steve frowned, shaking his head as they rounded a curve in the trail. "Eh, I don't know, Sam. I'd feel bad crashing on yours and Bucky's dates all the time, and—"
"That's probably most of it, little guy," said Steve. He'd seen enough of how the government worked—especially in the aftermath of the Battle of New York—to know that he didn't approve of most of it.
By the time the two engineers had returned to the Compound, the pager's battery was dead, leaving no easy way to trace the signal it had been transmitting. After several hours of tinkering, Bruce and James were able to identify the frequency of the transmission but not the strength, which meant that if Fury had originally meant it to transmit out into space, they had no way of knowing how far or in which direction.
my mom said that instead of us going out to Hawaii next summer to visit my grandparents, you know, like we always do, we're gonna pay for them to fly here," Ned said, groaning in frustration. "Apparently my grandma really wants to see New York City for some reason."
"Oh, I definitely can," Peter said proudly. "In fact, Pietro and I were working on a new training algorithm that was gonna use some of these—"
And there was no 'if' in there either. After all of the absolute misery he and Steve had endured in the last several months, there was no way in
"Yeah, that was just… just a one-time thing. They were gone for a pretty long time on that one, so—"
Peter smiled, his first real smile of the day. "I didn't think it would. I can't wait for you to see it, I think you'll really like it."
Steve’s entire body felt like it was as pink as a lobster as he finally whispered, “I—I’d like for you to have me tonight.  If—if that’s okay.”
“Don't let that asshole get to you, okay, Steve?” Bucky says as he tugs his swim cap down over his chin-length hair.  “Just get out there and show him how it’s done.”
He had obviously overcorrected in his course calculations, something both he and Bruce had anticipated might happen given that this was just the initial run-through. But as the realisation of what he was looking at washed over him, Tony couldn't help but believe that something other than science was at work here.
“Are you looking forward to tonight, Steve?” Peter asked as they worked on opposite sides of the Fiction aisle, organising the books and dusting the shelves.  “I never got to meet the Mr Jarvis who inspired our UI, but my dad says that his lasagna recipe is the best he’s ever eaten.”
"Right," said Tony. "We definitely don't wanna dance with this guy, we just want the gauntlet. 'Cause I figure if we can get the glove off, then all our wizard friend has to do is portal either it or him off into space or something, and we've won."
Steve’s lips twitched as he attempted to focus his eyes directly on the man, hoping he could convey even a fraction of the contempt he was feeling.
"You'd better believe it," Natasha said, winking as Wanda set a third pie down onto the rack. "I had to kick your kid out of here a few minutes ago, though. He kept begging to sample everything, all while eating an entire party-sized bag of Doritos."
"Yeah, it kinda is!" Peter insisted. "Dad, Steve told me that he loves you! He told me he's in love with you, and—and—and you can't just throw all that away just 'cause you're mad at him! That would be so incredibly stupid, Dad, and you're not stupid!"
"Well, not all of us can be as goody-two-shoes as First Lieutenant Joseph Rogers, right Joe?" said Tomis. "Has O'Brien personally offered to shine your flight boots yet?"
"Oh, that's good," Peter breathed, his cheeks flaming hot. He set down his cup and took Gwen's hand, leading her over to the dance floor. As soon as they stopped Gwen wound her arms around his neck, resting her cheek on his lapel as his arms curled around her slender waist and pulled her close. He closed his eyes as they began to sway back and forth, breathing in the incredible scent of her gorgeous hair and biting his lip to keep the tears in.
Drawing in a deep, shuddering breath, Steve glanced back at the door he'd just slammed, and the shield he had just happened to knock loose from a nearby shelf. Natasha had put it there shortly after they got back from Wakanda, after Steve had launched it from his and Tony's bedroom one night in a raging fit of anguish. Even now, his stomach roiled at the sight of it, at the shield he had wielded as Captain America since 1942.
"Well… I got to know him pretty well. He's pretty sick, poor kid, but he's just… anyway. I don't know if you've noticed but they work Tony pretty hard here, so he wasn't able to get out early enough to be able to visit Peter before curfew, and Peter was pretty sad about it, so—" He paused, taking another bite of the sandwich. Sometimes he had a tendency to include too many details.
"Damn," Tony murmured once he finally released him. "It's too bad that we have plans, 'cause you are looking especially hot at the moment."
And all too soon he'd be sixteen, and driving, and then off to college not too long after that, and then—
If the potential he saw in Peter is real, and not just Steve’s imagination, then he owes it to Peter to not do anything that might jeopardise it.  And that includes potentially attempting to date Peter’s father when he still doesn’t have his own head on straight.
It was absolutely beautiful, and Tony loved it so much that even though they still had a few more days before they were due to head back to New York, he was already looking forward to their next trip so they could stay there again.
"I know, I know." There was another pause as Peter heard Ned's mother call out his name, presumably for dinner. "Mom says that dinner's ready, so I guess I'll talk to you later?"
"Ah huh. And did he build any safeguards in there to prevent someone else from grabbing on to you? Such as the Meridian government?"
“Pretty sure they still do, Tony,” answers Steve.  He locks eyes with Tony in the dim light, nodding once.  “I trust you.”
"Oh, I'm such an idiot!" the teacher said, slamming his forehead with his palm so hard that Peter was surprised he was able to stay upright. "Oh, please forgive me, Captain! I can't believe I said something so incredibly
"Jesus Christ, Cap," he said as he grabbed onto Steve's forearms, stilling him. "You know, between you and Tones, it's no wonder I'm starting to get wrinkles."
Steve immediately laughed, an honest-to-goodness, true belly laugh, realising about a split-second later that he could not honestly remember the last time he had done so.
Tony let out a chuckle as Steve gently rolled him onto his back, pressing a light kiss to his forehead before easing off the bed. He watched through half-lidded eyes as Steve sauntered into the bathroom, returning a few minutes later with freshly washed and towel-dried hair and a warm washcloth that he used to clean Tony's body, pressing another kiss to his lips once he was done.
The monitor blinked as lines of text appeared, with Tony's grip on Steve's hand getting tighter as they read a transcript of Peter and his friends discussing the colour of Steve's eyes and the shape of Tony's facial hair and then playing a few rounds of Clue. Steve's jaw involuntarily clenched as he read several sentences of what appeared to be a not-so-friendly exchange between Peter and his classmate Flash regarding the battle in Miami, followed directly by Peter saying that he needed some air.
Tony gasped as Steve flipped them so he was on top again, grinding his hips down against Tony's. "You're so good, baby, so good to me."
It was on the tip of Tony's tongue to protest, to tell Steve that they really needed to start working on this right now, making plans and then making contingency plans for when those plans fell through, not wasting time dancing to big band in their living room. But then Steve started nuzzling Tony's temple, his hand tightening around his as they swayed to the old-fashioned music, and Tony realised that actually, this was exactly what he needed at the moment.
"Yeah, and like you said, you're fifteen, which by definition means you're not yet an adult. Too young to be an Avenger, bud." Tony kissed him again, then patted his back, chuckling when he heard Peter's stomach growl. "Guess that's the cue to see what Papa's making for dinner, yeah?"
"JARVIS, stop!" he exclaimed, flinching as the camera came to a halt. He blinked, slid his glasses back on, and proceeded to freak out when the image completely disappeared.
Tony breathed in, clenching his jaw. "JARVIS, on my mark, find the weakest spot that you can on this roof and blast it to hell, yeah? Two shots if you can do it, all three if you have to."
"You wrote those just in the last few hours?" Papa asked, stifling a yawn. He really did look horrible, all tired and beat up, but Peter wasn't about to tell him that.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💗
"Just don't want anything bad to happen to Uncle Bucky, Dad," Peter said. "He's already been through enough crap for three lifetimes, don't you think?"
"Thank you," she said as she stifled a yawn. "Can you also please tell him that I—well, you know what, nevermind. I—I'll tell him when I talk to him."
"Holy shit," Tony whispered, shivering as desire shot down his spine like a spear. "You do realise that I'm trying to drive here?"
"Yeah," Steve said, his own smile equally forced. "You've got three minutes, okay? After that, no matter what, we're pulling you out."
"Ah," Tony said with a smirk, popping another piece of garlic bread into his mouth. "So, does that mean you're trying to imply that I'm special to you or something?"
At least Dad had made him a couple of new undershirts with the same kind of built-in heating system that his suit had so he had been able to stay a bit warmer during the day, but he still liked having the extra hoodie available anyway since it was still really freaking cold outside, and Gwen had pointed out his chattering teeth more than once.
"Agreed. And you pretty much just summed up most of our government in a single word. If not all of it."
"Okay, okay, look," Peter said quickly, his voice trembling. "I'm gonna assume that you guys aren't with Thanos, right?"
Steve's eyes flicked over to the red, white, and blue shield propped up against the wall right next to their bedroom door. Tony had offered many times to build him a stand or something to hook it on when Steve wasn't using it, but Steve always refused. He'd told Tony that during the war he had always stored the shield right by the door—when he was actually able to sleep in a building, that is—and, like everything else about Steve, old habits apparently died hard.
"Then we shouldn't!" Natasha exclaimed, her green eyes wide and eager. "Steve, we don't have to accept it! Carol is here! Nebula and Gamora are here, and they can all help us! Nebula said she might even know where Thanos is, so I say that we figure out a plan, and then go and get him! Make him somehow reverse all of this!"
mention my husband or my son around me," Steve spat out, his injured ribs protesting his vehemence. "They are both a million times better men that you'll ever hope to be, so you just keep their names out of your filthy mouth,
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said gently, jarring Tony from his fitful semi-doze. "But Miss Stacy is on the line requesting an update on Master Peter's condition, and she sounds rather concerned."
Especially since some of the corporations seemed to be nothing but shells for other corporations, based on Tony's research. Unfortunately, nothing that they had been able to uncover so far had been able to crack those shells, leaving both Tony and Steve extremely frustrated.
"Mmm." Tony watched as Phillips shot a furtive glance at the door before stepping closer. "Look, I know what happened, and I just wanna say that—"
"Your Highness," Steve said as he offered T'Challa his hand. T'Challa smirked slightly as he took it, watching as Bruce offered him a deep bow about a metre back.
"Oh, shit!" Peter murmured under his breath, shivering as his Spider Sense activated, sending a series of icy bolts down his back.
Sharp tears pricked Steve's eyes, and he swallowed hard, his hands fisting into the pillow clutched to his chest. Of course Peter would try to hide his own misery since he knew Steve was having frequent nightmares as well. Tony had warned Steve way back when he first moved in with them that Peter was often selfless to a fault, and Steve had personally witnessed it for himself many times.
"Well, yeah, but I didn't know if your dad thought it would be safe for you to leave the Tower," Gwen said. "Although if you want, I'm sure my dad wouldn't mind coming to pick you up."
think about what might have happened if Carol hadn't suddenly appeared when she did. Bruce had also told Steve that Tony had been breathing air that was way too thin for at least twenty-four hours before Carol managed to locate the ship, and so was shocked that Tony was still somewhat conscious when they landed.
With a quick shake of his head, Tony moved to his closet, searching for something to wear that wasn't either wrinkled or dirty as he tried to reign himself in. Steve had seemed like the perfect gentlemen the previous night when he'd asked Tony out but he was still an Air Corps pilot, which meant that Tony needed to keep his guard up until he knew without a doubt that he could trust him.
Like many fine New York City dining establishments, their restaurant was located on the very top floor of an exclusive hotel. Tony thought it was a bit odd when he happened to notice a man dressed in a poorly-fitting suit standing inside the restaurant's waiting area as they left, but didn't think anything else of it until the elevator doors opened into the parking garage level and three other men stepped out of a nondescript black sedan, one of whom Tony recognised as FBI Agent Bartlett, his father's old acquaintance.
At first, Tony had been too stunned to speak, staring down at the metal tags that rested against his sternum directly below the arc reactor.  He’d learned enough about military history during his years as a weapons’ manufacturer to know that a soldier presenting his dog tags to his gal—or fella, in Tony’s case—was only one or two steps shy of a marriage proposal, something that Tony had never—not even once—believed he’d ever experience.
for soundproofing!—it never was while they were sleeping, so Peter could hear Papa's shouts and screams of terror when the nightmares hit almost every single time.
tour logo.  Biting back a curse, Tony tossed the juice bottle towards the sink and ripped off the t-shirt, checking it three separate times before pulling it back on.  Then he sucked in a deep breath, preparing himself for the lecture that was sure to follow in three… two… one…
"This is my best attempt, sir," said JARVIS. "However, without any reference to go by, I cannot promise that—"
Steve says aloud, squinting as he rereads the calendar, certain he’s seeing things.  Sure enough, that’s exactly what the appointment reminder states: a Mr Tony Stark wants to meet with Steve to ask if he’d be willing to coach his thirteen-year-old son in swimming.
"That's what I want," murmured Steve. "For the rest of our lives, I want this." He brushed his lips across Tony's neck and shoulder, skimming his hand down Tony's arm to intertwine their fingers before curling both their arms around Tony's front.
"What do ya think, J?" Tony said as he tossed the hologram into the space next to him. He ran his finger down his goatee, giving the belt design a quick tweak. "You think Steve's gonna like it?"
“Oh, really?  That's so cool!” Peter practically squeaked.  “Does that mean you drew the pictures on the windows too?  ‘Cause they’re really awesome!”
"Captain Rogers. Thank you for coming," he said, his lips quirking into a sort of odd half-smile as he looked Steve up and down.
"Please!" Peter begged, followed by a hard cough. "Please, just leave me alone and let me do this! Please!"
A knot rose in Steve's throat, one that he hastily attempted to swallow down. He understood completely where Stacy was coming from. It was a father's job to protect his children from harm, to keep them as safe as possible. And as a police officer, Steve suspected that it had to be especially difficult for Stacy to not be able to protect his daughter from the Avenger-level events that tended to occur far more frequently than Steve wished.
"It's a wormhole to another universe!" yelped Peter, yanking so hard on Papa's elbow that he nearly pulled him down. "Papa, you've got to listen to me! Before I came through the portal, Dr Strange told us that he'd seen what could happen when powerful beings drew even more power from other dimensions or universes! So I think—!"
With a sigh, Peter opened his algebra textbook and started copying down notes, barely looking at his paper since he already understood the principles being presented by the teacher. As much as he hated to admit it, he really, really missed his dads. Uncle James and Uncle Bucky were doing their best to keep Peter distracted but it still wasn't the same, and it didn't help at all that this series of raids seemed to have so much more riding on them than the ones in the past.
"I guess as long as Sam's okay with it," he finally said. "And as long as you can listen to him, 'cause he's gonna be in charge until we get Steve back."
"Yeah! And I'm so happy for you!" Peter said. "But please tell me you're not still wearing that ugly cadets' uniform, 'cause I'm pretty sure there's—"
"I'm sure she would," Peter answered. "I'll ask Dad, see what he says. I know he doesn't see you as a security threat, and it's not like you'd try anything with Auntie Nat sitting right there anyway."
Tony was quiet for several seconds, until Steve glanced towards him. "I know you love me, honey," he said quietly. He reached for Steve's hand, cradling it between his own. "But I also know what it's like to try and forget about some really shitty things in some not-so-healthy ways, and… I don't think the two necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. It's just… more convenient like this, and I've enabled you long enough. It's got to stop."
The roar that erupted from the literally hundreds of warriors lined up behind him was deafening, the sound waves literally propelling Steve forward as his team hurtled across the Wakandan plain so smoothly it was as though it had been choreographed. The flyers: Tony, Sam, James, Quill, Valkyrie, and Peter, were in perfect Army Air Corps formation, all of them flanked by the Wakandan aircrafts, which instantly began firing their laser bolts at the flying, lizard-like whale creatures.
"Oh my God," Peter gasped, his heart leaping into his throat as he grabbed his second laptop and opened his recently decrypted HYDRA files. He pulled up the long one that he'd dismissed as the gibberish fairy tale, his fingers tapping impatiently against the keyboard as he scanned it over.
Tony sucked in a deep breath. He had been hoping for just a quick introduction, thinking he would have plenty of time to actually get to know Sarah Rogers once Project Phoenix was over and Peter had recovered from his operation. But Tony supposed that since she had agreed to take over Peter's rather intensive medical care before even meeting either of them, he could grant her the courtesy of one dinner.
"Which could potentially take an infinite amount of time," finished Tony. "Not exactly what I would call plausible."
"Your father had another nightmare, little guy," Steve said gently as he came up behind Tony, curling his strong arms around them both. He drew them back onto the bed, holding them as tightly as he dared while Tony breathed in the comforting scent of Peter's hair, the green apple shampoo he'd always adored.
"I want to see your initial reports on my desk before tomorrow's briefing!" Phillips yelled over the loudspeaker. "Dismissed!"
"Hey, buddy," Tony said as he rapped on Peter's slightly opened door. "You need help with anything?"
"Dad's right, Peter," Steve whispered into Peter's ear. "Just squeeze my hand, okay? Squeeze as hard as you need to, and I promise it's gonna be all right."
"Well, no, not completely," Tony said. "We have our defence drones, and I've been working on extending their range, but at the moment we can only cover the East Coast and that's about it. We also have these goofy shrinking particles that Pete, Bruce, and I reverse-engineered, but we haven't figured out an actual use for them yet. That and the nanite suits are pretty much all that we've got at the moment. Oh, and Thor's desire to get the Space Stone out of New Asgard."
Tony's shoulders sagged in a heavy sigh. "Fine," he said reluctantly. "But only if you promise to wear those red silk pants that I love."
Tony scoffed, tipping his forehead against Steve's collarbone. "You know you don't have to worry about me so much, Steve. I'm not made out of glass, remember?"
Obie, in what he probably thought was his infinite generosity, had informed Tony that he was giving him until next Friday to ponder how he was going to respond to the Board’s motion.  Which meant that Tony now had six whole days to decide to either give in to Obie’s demands and break up with Steve, or face the very real possibility that he would be voted out of his own company.
Peter's shiny new dress shoes clacked against the polished wood floor as he arrived at the closed door of the guest room, pressing his ear up against it. Just as he'd suspected, he could hear Papa's steady footsteps pacing back and forth, his thumbs probably hooked on the belt loops of his perfectly-pressed uniform pants. Peter had noticed that whenever Papa was on his feet, he either had his fingers bracketing his belt buckle, his hands on his hips like he was about to chastise someone—usually accompanied by what Dad liked to call his worry wrinkle—or he was leaning against the wall or door frame with either his arms crossed in front of him or his hands stuffed into his front pockets, a pose that Dad lovingly referred to as "the papa pose".
And then, on Tony's seventeenth birthday, the legal age of adulthood in Langara, Mr Jarvis had presented Tony with a gift, the timepiece that he still wore, and from then on referred to him as
Steve screamed inside his mind as Tony’s lips parted just enough for their tongues to touch, his blood sizzling like he’d just gotten caught by a tripwire.  He had never wanted anyone as badly as he wanted Tony Stark in that moment, but he also knew that they needed to wait.
“So… tell me again how you found this guy?” Dad says as he turns onto the street that leads to Empire State University.  The street is lined with colourful row houses that have to be at least a hundred years old, something that Peter finds almost as cool as the fact that in only a few short minutes, he's going to get to meet a real-life Olympic gold medalist.
"Okay, so… you wanna tell me what's really on your mind, or are you gonna make me try and guess?" he asked, quirking an eyebrow. Steve immediately huffed, shifting on his feet. It still unnerved him at times just how well Tony could read him.
Papa gulped, fiddling with his spoon. "Yes," he finally said. "From what they can tell, whatever it was that attacked Wakanda came from somewhere in space."
"Yeah, maybe. Back then all it would've taken was a single shot to pretty much get me plastered, but anyway… I ended up asking him why I had been chosen, since all of the other guys in the program were a lot bigger and stronger than I was."
"There's really nothing about it to understand, Steve," said Sam, practically spitting the words. "The only message here is that instead of taking care of one of their own who almost died for his country, our government is turning its back on him just 'cause he can't fly anymore." He let out a morbid chuckle, his hand resting protectively on Bucky's uninjured shoulder. "They even had the gall to tell Bucky that he's gonna be billed for any treatment that he receives from that point on, even though the docs haven't even cleared him to be discharged yet. There was no mention of a prosthesis, physical therapy, nothing. They're just completely hanging him out to dry."
Unfortunately that thought didn't help Tony feel any better, especially once they arrived at the hospital and the doctors sprang into action. The next three hours were amongst the longest of Tony's life, pacing back and forth in the hallway as the doctors tried to get Peter's oxygen saturation to climb high enough to support his vital functions without having to resort to using a ventilator, which with Peter's already deteriorated state would've pretty much been a death sentence.
It didn't help that Dad and Papa had just kind of glossed over a lot of what had happened during the year—
"Yeah, that's one of the first things I checked on, Cap," replied Clint. "It's been visually accounted for in its vault, and according to JARVIS the vault hasn't been opened since the last time Bruce opened it, which was six days ago."
Peter shifted on his squashy couch along the side of the jet, rubbing at his scratchy eyes as he tried to keep from yawning. He'd called Ned so he could help distract him from his father's latest freak-out, and it had worked for a little while. But the last ten minutes or so had turned into nothing but a whine-fest, and Peter was rapidly getting over it.
"Yeah, he did." Tony took off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. Steve had only been gone for a few hours, and Tony was already missing him so badly that he ached.
"Or even a roof," Steve said with wide eyes. "Thor would probably try and light the stove with his hammer, and then—"
"So do I, little guy," Papa said as they arrived inside the Tower garage. He gave Peter's knee another squeeze, his worry wrinkle firmly etched between his eyebrows. "C'mon. If you can get all of your homework done before dinner, I thought we might watch a movie with Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky afterwards. Maybe it'll help take our mind off of things."
"And I also meant what I said to you," Steve said. He tentatively curled his arm around Tony's waist, drawing him closer. "I love you, Tony. I love you and I want to be with you, and I'm so sorry that I almost messed things up, and—"
, aiming directly for him at a speed way too fast to out-manoeuvre. For a moment Steve was frozen, his blood like ice in his veins as he licked his lips, trying to force his stunned mind to think of a solution to what seemed like an impossible problem.
"The arc reactors," Steve blurted out, shaking his head when he felt his cheeks heating up. "Isn't that correct, Mr Stark?"
"That's not exactly what I'm worried about, Tony," said Steve. "If that drug gets into the wrong hands again, then—"
"Well, I'm not going to apologise for it," Steve said as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, hugging him close. "You needed it."
“P-Pete?” Tony manages as Steve struggles to move him closer to Thor.  “Wh—what’s he—he can’t—it’s not—”
After playing a few rounds of Yahtzee with Bruce, Clint, and Pietro in the living room after dinner, he and Tony called it a night and retreated to their suite. Steve had no qualms that he'd be able to sleep that night. He never slept well on the night before a mission, but he had some hope that he and Tony would at least be able to rest a bit. After washing up and brushing his teeth, he climbed into the bed and turned out the overhead lights, idly flipping through his bedside sketchbook while he waited for Tony to finish up in the bathroom.
Tony paced back and forth, his metal feet clanking along the concrete floor of the bunker as he impatiently waited for Bruce and Natasha to complete their initial assessment of the computer files. JARVIS had already begun decrypting the rest of the list of names they had managed to find, the list that contained not only Steve, Bruce, and Bucky's names, but Peter's as well.
As soon as the words left Peter's mouth a massive wave of guilt washed over him, one so strong that it nearly knocked him sideways. Here he was, sneaking around behind his dads' backs, getting involved in the very thing they didn't want him involved in. They had been keeping all of this stuff from him the whole time because they were trying to protect him, and now Peter was basically spitting right in the face of their fear.
"Somehow I doubt it," he managed to croak past his parched throat. He blinked his swollen eyes, his jaw tightening even more as he recognised the man as Justin Hammer.
"Yes, I do," he said just before brushing his lips tentatively across Tony's. Warmth burst across his chest as soon as their lips touched, spreading out to his arms and down his abdomen as he pulled Tony flush against him and kissed him again, his knees nearly buckling when Tony's palms glided up his back to hold him close.
Swiping his sweat-dampened hair from his eyes, Steve planted his feet and threw another punch, one so strong that it broke the skin on his middle finger's knuckle, leaving a bright smear of blood across the bag's ivory canvas. Biting down on his bottom lip, Steve wound up again, driving his left fist so hard into the bag that it flew off its hook and slammed into the wall, sending sand scattering across the floor. He immediately cried out, both from the pain and from the fact that he now had yet another big mess to clean up.
"Pete? Buddy, tell me what's wrong," Tony said as shot to his feet, with Peter practically collapsing into his arms. He tucked his boy's head under his chin, his entire skinny body shaking so badly that he couldn't even seem to form words.
"My dad doesn't get paid to run the Department of Damage Control," Peter said firmly. "The government and Stark Industries pays the rest of the employees, but my dad doesn't accept a cent for it. And the Avengers have never taken any outside support from anyone. Anything they have, they've either built or bought for themselves. They're a completely private organisation."
"And they are, Tony," Fury stated. "But pardon me if I'm trying to be just a bit more cautious with the king of a formerly very reclusive country."
"Oh, yeah," Gwen whispered as fresh tears welled in her eyes. "We're… we're trying to hang in there. It's hard, but… being here, and trying to stay busy, it—it helps a lot. I think if we were at our own house, it'd—it'd be a lot worse."
“Oh, I get that from Dad,” Peter said without missing a beat.  He then shot Steve a grin that was downright maniacal as he moved his remaining knight, forking Steve’s queen between the knight and his other bishop.
They pulled into the Tower garage only a few minutes later, with Steve carefully guiding Peter's stretcher up to the penthouse and into his heated room while Dr Cho readied her EEG machine to examine his neurological functioning. Steve clung to Tony's hand as Dr Cho conducted the test, his chest aching with every shallow breath.
Tony's hands immediately froze in place. "Steve," he said, and Steve's heart skittered at the catch in his voice. "Honey, you were gone for a
“So… all Strucker and his goons would need is a power source like the arc reactor to activate it?” Steve asks.  “And then they could transport themselves wherever they want?”
Unfortunately, it had been nothing but a colossal waste of time. Not only had O'Brien proceeded to laugh in Tony's face when he demanded to know of Hank Pym's whereabouts, but he had also informed Tony in no uncertain terms that Pym was so adept at hiding that there'd be "no chance in hell" that anyone would ever be able to find him.
Besides. Steve had still brought his shield along, like he always did whenever they travelled, just like the rest of the team had brought all of their equipment. Even Peter was wearing one of his Spider-Man suits under his clothes, mainly for the built-in heater, but still. Tony was just lucky that he had the luxury of carrying his suit in a sweet, classy-looking case.
Tony watched as Peter exited the lab, returning a minute later with his backpack and a bottle of blue Powerade, his curls flopping down over his forehead as he settled in to do his trigonometry homework. Tony's throat tightened as he watched him for a moment out of the corner of his eye before returning to his own workstation. It never failed to amaze Tony how a kid could go through all the shit that Peter had gone through and still be able to retain some semblance of normality.
"Hmm," said Tony. "Well, I can't say I'm specifically looking for that, but if it keeps Hulk from punching other people, or cars, or buildings that are filled with other people, then I'd say it's a trade-off that's decent enough."
Tony has asked him on more than a few occasions, sometimes amused and sometimes not.  Whenever Steve tosses an almost-completed drawing aside because he messed up one tiny part of the smudging.  Whenever he makes the team go over a training formation three separate times to make sure they have the timing down perfectly.
Tony’s hand was shaking so hard as he reached into the inside pocket of his jacket that he could barely grab hold of it.
Although, now that Peter thought about it, if it had, it might've helped ease Dad's twitchiness a bit. Not knowing where the phenomenon came from was one of the main things that kept Dad pacing trails in the hallways in the middle of the night. And Papa too, by proxy.
And even now, as JARVIS piloted the Iron Man armour through the frigid night air and Steve bit down on his lower lip to keep it from shaking, he found himself silently begging every single saint, angel, and deity that he'd ever heard his Catholic mother praying to that his son would be alive once they found him, and that they would be able to find the people or things responsible for trying to hurt him.
"All righty," Tony said as he pulled himself up to his feet, swearing when his prickly foot protested being forced into use. "J?"
"Yeah, I'm sure it is," said Tony. "Let me know when the part gets there and I'll walk you through installing it, yeah?"
"Sam," Steve finally forced past the knot in his throat. He felt so sickened that he probably would've vomited had he had anything in his stomach. Bucky had wanted to be a pilot his entire life, ever since Steve had known him, and the thought of him losing one of his limbs, of never being able to fly ever again, it was—it was—
The tears he'd been trying to hold back finally spilled down Peter's cheeks as he looked over to where Dr Strange was sitting. The wizard's head was tipped back, with his eyes closed and his left foot tapping on the ground as though he were listening to music or something, seemingly oblivious to the fact that three people had just up and vanished right in front of him.
"Okay, so… how long was all of this gonna go on?" he demanded, his fingers curling around his left forearm. "I worked my ass off on every single one of those designs, under constant orders—actually, more like threats—to always stay ahead of the enemy's tech, and for what? Only for them to be turned over to the enemy as soon as our guys tested 'em out?"
"And have you ever met that Spider-Man dude?" the guy continued. "He was up there too, right? Is he any good?"
Tony shook his head, throwing up his hand.  “You know we are, ‘cause you asked me the very same question right before I shut the door in your face,” he said quietly.  “Now, I’m already late picking up my son, so I’ll talk to you more tomorrow.”
"Well, how 'bout you tell me after we go and visit Pete tonight, hmm?" said Tony. "He made me promise not to go and see him unless we went there together, so—"
"Uh huh!" Peter said as he continued his climb up the side of the spinning ship, desperately searching for another door to get inside. His head was already starting to swim, his lungs contracting as they struggled to breathe in the rapidly thinning air. Hypoxia was only seconds away, and if he fell…
Leaning closer to Gwen, Peter reached for his phone in his back pocket. "How 'bout I take a picture of us, hmm?"
"Okay, so does this whole Project Rebirth thing have anything to do with the fact that you managed to tear the sheets last night?" Tony asked as he popped the last of his bread roll into his mouth. He grinned as Steve's cheeks proceeded to flush that deep pink colour he adored. "I mean, I know I can give a pretty decent blowjob, but—"
"But how the hell does a cocky-as-hell surgeon survive an accident that should've killed him and somehow come out of it a wizard?" Tony wondered as he approached what appeared to be a platform suspended about two stories up from the bowels of the ship. The last thing he'd heard about Dr Strange was that the injured doctor had sold all of his possessions and fled to East Asia, probably in search of the cure that had eluded him in Western medicine.
"You're damn right you may," Tony said firmly. "Actually, why don't we just say that if any of these goddamn things so much as looks at Pete funny, you take 'em out. Yeah?"
"Okay," Steve said slowly. "But what is it? 'Cause right now it kinda looks like one of those round robot vacuum cleaners that Peter used to have."
Now wasn't really the time to ask such a question, though. Not when the force shield was preparing to open, allowing Thanos' war dogs free reign to enter Wakanda.
Tony huffed, ducking his head down under Steve's chin as he slid his leg over Steve's hip. "You're lucky you're cute."
"No thank you, JARVIS, I'm okay," answered Steve. He scrubbed at his eyes with his palms, sucking in a deep, shaky breath. "I'm just… where's Tony?"
"Well, then you better tire me out tonight, mo grá," Steve said, so low and husky that a bolt of pure heat shot down Tony's spine. "Don't you think?"
“Would it help if I texted you to remind you to text me to remind me?” Tony asked with a wink.  He chuckled in relief when Peter gave him one of his signature goofy smiles.
he said again as Steve's lips latched onto his pulse point. He wound his arm around Steve's neck and turned his head to meet Steve's kiss, one so tender and passionate that Tony's knees almost gave way. It was as if Steve was parched, dying of thirst, and Tony was the water that would save him.
A soft smile spread across Steve's lips as he stared at the drawing, trailing his fingertip across Peter's round cheek smashed up against Tony's side. Peter's cheeks weren't quite as round anymore, and his jawline had sharpened up a bit more over the summer as well, only adding to how much he resembled Tony.
"I know that, young Peter," Grandma said gently. "And you shouldn't. Because if your father is even half the man that Steven tells me he is, then I am very proud to know him. And you as well. You're both quite remarkable."
"Steve?" Tony repeated, pausing a few steps in to toss his hand towel in the general direction of the laundry hamper. "I thought Fury already told you that we didn't need to worry about it?"
"All right, sweetheart," Steve said. Slowly, he withdrew his fingers, slicking up his cock before settling onto his side and rolling Tony towards him.
"Yes, I believe we were," he practically growled as he dipped his head to find Tony's lips, slipping a hand underneath Tony's shirt to tug it off. Tony let out a gasp as Steve slid his palms up Tony's bare chest, his legs instinctively hiking up to hook over Steve's hips as his hands slid down Steve's back to grip his glorious ass.
"JARVIS, go ahead and do another run-through of the guidance systems, yeah?" Tony asked. He had just uploaded yet another set of Peter's upgrades to JARVIS's programming, and while he hadn't found that Peter had made a single mistake yet, with the mission only a few days away Tony couldn't be too careful.
Tony chuckled as Peter scrambled to fetch his fishing supplies, winding his arms around Steve's waist as Steve's arm wrapped around his shoulders.
"Maybe," Steve murmured. As much as he hated being late to anything, it wouldn't be the first time that he and Tony had arrived late to a function, and for this very same reason. There was just something so irresistible about Tony's beautiful olive skin when it was covered in water droplets.
look over his shoulder. His armoured fingers were curled around Peter's arm, gripping him like he was afraid he was going to disappear if he let go. "First we've gotta figure out what the hell this asshole's up to."
With a huff, Peter took off jogging towards the opposite end of the bunker, hoping to run into Wanda or Mr Stacy or someone else who might know where Papa was being kept. He was beyond ready to get out of there and go home.
"'Bout time," Sam said as he came up on Steve's left side, with Natasha and Bruce crowding in between Tony and Clint. "Let's get this done."
"Mmm, can't say I'm too surprised," Phillips said. "I doubt he wants to remember too much of it. Especially since the serum worked even better than we'd originally hoped."
"Oh. Uh huh," Peter said through another yawn. "Can we still stop and get some food on the way home?"
And unfortunately, aside from making sure Tony got enough to eat, switching him to decaf in the evenings over his protests, and encouraging him to sleep more, Steve didn't really know what else he could do to help him.
"Very well. But may I remind you that adding any additional protocols could possibly delay target acquisition and firing."
It was almost funny how quickly he and Steve shot to their feet, nearly tripping over each other in their mad scramble to pack up their picnic items and race over to the barracks. As soon as they reached the building, Steve grabbed Tony around the waist, peppering his face and neck with kisses as he fumbled for his ID badge to unlock the door.
"This isn't—it's not really very nice," Steve murmured as he unlocked the door to his room, leading Tony inside. Since the barracks were considered a nonessential section of the base the whole building was dark, the moonlight shining through the window the only thing illuminating the rather small but extremely tidy room. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf stood against the cement-block wall opposite the double bed, with a small bedside table, a footlocker, and a narrow door that led to what Tony assumed was the sink and toilet over in the opposite corner.
Mr Stacy frowned as he took a sip of his water. "Yes, but why did you learn about him? What has he done that makes his life worthy of being taught to a fifth grader? It's not like you're learning about military strategies or how to vaporise aliens yet, are you?"
night, the night of their ill-fated second anniversary dinner, just sitting there waiting in its little containment pack under his shirt where the arc reactor used to be, there would've been no way in hell that those goddamn HYDRA goons could've taken Steve away from him like they did.
Whether or not they would turn out to be effective plays, Steve had no idea. Hence the majority of his frustration.
Ms Sharon gave him a wide smile. "Oh, I love that! I was always hoping that Steve would find someone, he's just too good not to. And your father is a wonderful man, Peter. I don't think I've ever seen a more attentive parent."
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Mr Stacy, it's nice to see you again," Steve said as he unconsciously reached for Tony's arm, fighting the urge to step in front of him. George Stacy was a police officer, not a government official, and ever since the theatre incident Steve had had no real reason to view him as a threat, but that damn senate hearing had gotten him so twitchy, as Peter would say, that he was even more paranoid than usual.
With a snarl, Stane stepped back, nodding at the Winter Soldier carrying the sceptre. "Give him a zap."
"Yeah, which is just fine with me." Peter glanced at the clock, his shoulders sagging when he saw it was already almost three in the morning. But there'd be no way he would have enough time to build a suit and get ready for the dance tomorrow after school, so if he was going to do this, it had to be done now.
"Ah, yeah, he was a pretty brave fellow," said Papa. "Always putting his men first and never afraid to stand up to Washington when he thought they were wrong. I wasn't too involved with the Naval side of things during the war, but even our relatively small Army unit got the occasional word of what he was up to."
"Good." Steve curled his arm around Tony's waist, pulling him closer. "This will work, sweetheart. I'll make sure that it does."
"Uh huh," Peter said with a nod, causing Tony's heart to lurch. His sweet boy was trying hard to put on a brave face, but Tony could read him well enough to know that he was just as terrified as Tony.
"Sorry 'bout that, gentlemen," he said, his eyes flicking briefly over to Steve. "Colonel Phillips asked me to oversee the X-302s as they took off this morning."
"They're landing in a perimeter, Cap," added Sam. "If they're surrounding us, it's a good bet that they know we're here."
"No!" Peter squeaked, once again chomping down hard on his bottom lip. He had witnessed his dads arguing plenty of times, as they both could be stubborn as hell when they wanted to be. But the thought of them actually coming to blows, of physically
"I'm so glad that you had fun, little guy," Papa said as he tucked him into bed a few minutes later, kissing his forehead. "Maybe next time we'll all go."
In his hand, Steve held his tiny sketchbook, flipped open to the drawing of Tony and Peter cuddled up on the couch in the Malibu house. He bit down on his bottom lip as he carefully traced the outline of Peter's round cheek, tears welling in his eyes as he recalled the moment that the sketch had captured. So soon after their return from Afghanistan and trying to deny his growing feelings, Steve had been almost overwhelmed with affection for the two of them in that moment, with Peter's head resting on Tony's chest and Tony's arms tightly around him, as though he had feared that even in sleep, his precious boy would somehow be snatched away from him.
“Yeah,” repeats Steve, because he read about that too.  And then proceeded to spend over an hour reading every single Yelp review for Tony’s shop, where customer after customer raved about his handiwork on their six-figure vehicles like Tony was the second coming of Michelangelo or something.
do such a thing, and neither would Dr Banner," he said through clenched teeth. "And I know for a fact that neither of them would be in favour of… identification or anything of the sort, if that's what you're suggesting. And none of the rest of the team would be in favour of it either."
"All right, enough about your private lives already," barked Phillips. "If no one has any further questions about the actual aircraft that you're about to fly, then you're dismissed. Wheels up in twenty."
But Steve only shook his head, like the damn stubborn soldier that he was. "I shouldn't have to rely on my son to help me, Tony. I'm the parent, and he's the child. It doesn't work that way."
"Um, I will in a moment!" Mantis replied in her high-pitched, squeaky voice. She raised her hand, pointing to where Strange was still floating over the rocks, his neck and wrists encircled by tendrils of green light emanating from the stone around his neck.
"Yeah, that makes sense." During his ten years of flying, Steve had come to realise that there were two distinct types of fighter pilots: the ones who flew mainly on instinct, and the ones who were constantly thinking a thousand steps ahead. Bucky fell into the former category, with his instinctive flying style evident even in the way that he played chess, while Sam was definitely the latter, often spending hours studying aerial footage of old dogfights while he was auditioning for the test-pilot program.
Uncle Bucky sniffed, extending his metal left arm and rotating it at the elbow. "Yeah, it's been stickin' at the elbow joint ever since the bunker battle," he said. "I'm guessin' there's debris or somethin' stuck down there somewhere, so I asked if your dad could take a look at it for me."
Peter nodded, trying to smile as he trailed his thumb along her cheekbone. "Yeah, I hope so. I know you're gonna do awesome over there."
"Yeah, well, Stevie's just exceptional that way," said Bucky. "Guess I'll see you on the flip side."
"With pleasure, sir," answered JARVIS. And before Peter realised what was happening, a parachute suddenly deployed from his back, yanking him clear from the ship.
"Yes, he has," said Steve. Barely a second later he had slid off the bed and had almost reached the bathroom door when it suddenly flew open.
Ms Warren tilted her head as a chorus of soft giggles erupted from several of Peter's classmates. "Well… you could've fooled me. We only have about ten minutes left, so why don't you see if you can at least pretend like you're paying attention, hmm?"
“And as Iron Man, who just happens to be one of the Avengers—you know, that team of superheroes that Captain America’s in charge of?  The team who saved New York City when goddamn
"No, no, it's okay," Natasha said quickly. She pushed herself up from her chair, forcing a smile. "I'm gonna go see what Clint and Pietro are up to now, okay? I'll… come by and check on you later."
But before she could conclude her countdown, the hangar area was rocked by a bone-shattering, near deafening
"And only on weekends, buddy," said Tony. He planted a quick kiss on Peter's forehead, jerking his head towards Peter's corner of the lab. "Now, go get your books so you can get started on your homework, yeah?"
Again, Tony shrugged. "I s'pose it could be. I can see if Fury still has any of the stuff for me to analyse."
are you talking about?” he snapped, pointing a shaking finger in Tony’s direction.  “Do you realise the implications of even suggesting something like that, you little prick?  How
As it turned out, they were arguing about the fact that Papa had asked Uncle Thor to basically smuggle Peter and Dad to Asgard if something were to happen with the government where he no longer felt that it was safe, and Dad was trying to convince him that there would be "no way in hell" that he would leave Papa to "fend for himself against a pack of rabid wolves", and that Papa just needed to get over his "goddamn 1940's sentiment" and agree that Dad would stay by his side.
"But, Captain, why?" Pietro protested. "Wanda and I, we are Avengers too! And we are ready to fight!"
Besides, didn't Peter always say that the bad guy always had to get his monologue in first? May as well let Hammer have his time in his so-called spotlight before things got messy.
"Then the summer will be over before you know it, and she'll be back," Tony said as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Don't you always say that the summers go too fast?"
Steve squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in the glorious scent of Tony's hair as he struggled to come up with a plausible excuse, and found nothing.
"Okay, but I'm not sure if we should push that too hard anymore, especially after the committee meeting and now this bill. I think our main focus should be finishing the decryption of those files, and searching for a hard connection between HYDRA and Justin Hammer."
They had taken his clothes sometime between being shoved into the backseat of Agent Bartlett's car and his arrival at… wherever he was, leaving him dressed only in a paper-thin t-shirt and pants. The car had barely cleared the parking garage when the agent sitting next to him jabbed him in the neck with a needle the size of a straw, pulling a cloth bag over his head as he lost consciousness. Steve grimaced as he gingerly touched the puncture site, hot and tender under his fingertips. Whatever it was they had shot into him had burned something fierce going in, which led Steve to think it was the same drug that Killian and Stane had given him down at the Miami bunker.
Steve grunted as he pushed himself up to a sitting position, his swollen right hand pressed against the broken ribs on his left side and his teeth tightly clenched against the pain shooting through his body like a million bolts of lightning.
a nurse called, stepping back from the small, rectangular-shaped plastic container with a small syringe in her gloved hand. "
What Steve did remember, though, was that the HYDRA agents posing as FBI who had arrested him on the charge of falsifying his Army enlistment forms had done so right after he and Tony had enjoyed a late anniversary dinner together, and it had been that incident that had propelled Tony into developing his nanite armour. Never again, Tony had told him later on, would he ever get caught so completely defenceless.
Bucky narrowed his eyes. "Oh, and you do? What the hell, Steve, have you been checking up on this guy or something?"
"That's my brave boy," Steve whispered. "You're the bravest person I've ever seen, little guy, I know you can do this."
"Yes, well, if anyone thinks that he can insult my little Starkson here and get away with it, then he has another think coming, as I believe you Midgardians would say," Thor said, clapping Peter on the shoulder so hard that he would've driven him through the floor if he'd been just a normal kid. "Especially since I know that the StarkPhones are in fact far superior to any competitor currently on the market. Or at least that's what Banner tells me… I still don't quite understand the need for a phone, but, well, here we are." Thor let out a smile as he squeezed Peter's shoulder. "Now, Starkson, I do believe you did challenge me to another game of chess while the Captain here was transporting us back to our grand Tower?"
But Tony knew that the foot still bothered Steve on occasion, even without him saying so—which he never, ever did. Tony suspected that part of it might be psychological, as even if he never liked to show it, the month that Steve spent as a prisoner of HYDRA still deeply haunted him. Especially the part about how he was drugged so badly that it forced him to believe he was fighting against Tony, and that Tony hated him.
How long had it been since he'd had a truly hot shower, instead of one of the lukewarm-to-freezing-cold variety after working yet another eighteen-hour day?
Tony was used to a lot of trial and error in his experiments. In fact, aside from parenting, he often enjoyed the errors almost more than the trials, as they provided him with the same kind of rush that he got when he drank too much coffee, or drove too fast around a sharp corner.
Sam laughed, elbowing Bucky playfully in the side. "C'mon, grumpy, let's get out of here before the traffic gets too bad."
-safety-controlled—invisible bunker down in Georgia to rescue Steve, so Tony was certain that he'd be able to handle himself well enough now.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Oh, really?  It does?  Then why did the head of the Relief Foundation out in Sokovia just tell me that she’s starting to see the active targeting of civilian homes, huh?  ‘Cause that doesn't sound like less chaos to me.  In fact—”
"Tony, I couldn't love that little boy any more than if he was my own child," Steve blurted out. "And I swear to you, I will never, ever do anything that might hurt him. Not ever."
"I'm sorry, honey," Tony whispered, kicking himself for bringing one of Steve's long-buried demons back up to the surface. "I didn't mean to—"
"Yeah. That's exactly what it is," Steve whispered back. He brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing it over his ring. "But does that make it any less likely to work? I mean, if anyone could even attempt to figure this stuff out, it's you and Bruce."
After placing nearly a dozen coffee cups littering the counter into the dishwasher, Steve grabbed two bottles of water and padded out into the living room towards the lab, where he found Tony standing with his head and shoulders inside what appeared to be the chest and back plates of yet another new armoured suit.
"Steve, I know that already," Tony said impatiently. "But… damn, honey. This time the goddamn monster almost triggered
Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. He'd so far been able to almost avoid imagining how badly hurt Steve was going to be once they found him, but now—
"Yeah, I don't need to know any more than that," Steve said. Sam was a bit older than Bucky, about five years, and while Bucky had had more dating experience Sam had definitely had more experience with actual relationships, so Steve wasn't too surprised to hear that Sam was Bucky's first.
Steve nodded in thanks as a guard wheeled a padded chair over next to the table. Slowly, so as not to jostle Tony, he sank down into it, stifling a groan as his sore joints and muscles moulded into the adaptive cushioning, his eyes slipping closed almost against his will.
"I'm hardly ever too busy for chess," Peter said. "You can come up for lunch, and then we can play afterward?"
"Okay, that's good," Tony said as he tweaked the knee joint of his newest suit design, one that he had dubbed Igor. "About how many tons can he hold now?"
And then Natasha, who probably kept the most busy of any of them. Not only was she trying to support Clint and Pietro through their grief while in mourning herself, but she was also assisting George Stacy with his law enforcement duties and maintaining a frequent correspondence with General Okoye down in Wakanda. The two women were discussing the possibility of setting up a new international cooperative agency that would work to seek out any new potential super-villains and snuff them out before they had a chance to gain enough traction to become menacing.
"Goddamn Obadiah," Tony spat out against Steve's chest. "I should've seen it coming, so why didn't I? There were so many signs! So many signs that I fucking
"Nah. If Phillips had a problem with it I'm sure he'd say something. He's never been known to keep things like that to himself before."
"Yeah, um… that should work," Tony said with a nod, hoping that Rogers couldn't hear how loud his heart was thudding.
Peter groaned as he rubbed at his aching neck, his eyes burning from spending the last three hours trying to decode the wonky Russian HYDRA files. It was already after four in the morning, and he knew he should probably try and get at least a bit of sleep before he was supposed to get up for school, but his progress so far had been so annoyingly slow that he didn't want to give up until he actually found something of value.
Somehow, though, DNA testing proved the claim to be true, and once again Tony's entire life was turned on its head.
"Mmm," Tony grumbled as he slumped into the chair. His heart was racing, and his left hand was so tightly clenched that his fingernails were digging into his skin.
Apparently not even a universe-threatening battle could keep Gwen from going to study at Oxford for the summer.
"Was that supposed to be a joke?" asked Strange, his footsteps clanking against the floor as he followed.
"Yes. And your boy as well," said Phillips. "Seems like you Starks have a knack for this kinda thing."
“Inform them at once—inform who, Tony?” demanded Obie.  “Don't tell me you're dragging even more people in our private business?  This was supposed to be between you and me!  Not you, me, and a few strangers off the street who just happened to look decent in a uniform!”
"Hey, guys!" Liz said as she slid into view from a nearby hallway, a red Solo cup in one hand. "I'm so glad you came!"
"We're ready," he said as Tony and Sharon climbed into the front. He curled his arm around Peter's shoulders, a knot rising in his throat at how bony they were.
"Ah, yes, shows!" Thor exclaimed as he tossed his axe towards Steve, who slammed it with his shield right into another alien, slicing it completely in half. "In fact, I seem to recall Young Starkson mentioning something about attending a show in your city, on a street called Broadway? Something about a man who wears a mask and enjoys singing?"
"Yeah, she's gonna be at Oxford all next summer," Peter blurted out. "She's got an interview for a physics internship there coming up next month."
And Bruce, in typical Bruce fashion, was sitting curled up on the floor, wrapped in a blanket as he listened to the opera he'd always favoured to help calm him after hulking out.
"I'll go with you," said Bucky as he rapidly downed his third glass of whisky. "See ya later, Stevie."
"There are some tools aboard," said Gamora, jerking her head towards Dr Strange, who had assumed the goofy
It'd been that cut, and the blood pouring from it that had been so hard for Bucky to process once he found Peter, as it had reminded him far too much of the people he'd been forced to assassinate over the years as HYDRA's secret weapon. Bucky had told Steve that he had almost lost it at the sight of all that blood, and that if it hadn't been for Sam successfully talking him down once he'd rescued Gwen, Bucky wasn't sure what he would have done.
Steve was quiet for a moment, his jaw twitching slightly as he thought. "You know Bucky would do it," he finally said. "Especially if he thought it would help Peter as well."
"JARVIS, do me a favour and start scheduling regular diagnostics on the drones, all right? Let's say every three hours? I just want to make sure that nothing goes wrong."
“Mmm.  Okay,” Peter said, obviously unconvinced.  He tipped his bowl up to down the rest of the milk, running his sleeve across his mouth when he was done.  “I’m ready to go now.”
Time seemed to pause for a moment or two as the soundwaves from Tony's panicked cry slowly dissipated, with Steve's thudding heart the only sound until JARVIS spoke up, quiet and tentative.
get to decide which divisions to close and which to keep open,” Tony stated.  “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got work to do.”
"What?" Steve said, looking up just in time to see what appeared to be a row of giant, razor-sharp clock gears burrow their way under the ground outside the force shield, only to reappear on the inside a few seconds later.
"Okay?" Steve asked once he was fully sheathed, his eyes squeezing closed when Tony nodded, his arms shaking where they bracketed Tony's head. "Oh gods, Tony, you feel
Intellectually, Steve supposed he could understand why Colonel Phillips chose to keep his emergency plan for Peter a secret from Tony, knowing how Tony would react to the necessity of Howard's involvement. With the colonel being aware of the lack of a qualified paediatric heart surgeon since even before Peter's admission, Steve knew it couldn't have been easy for him to keep that information from Tony, to silently watch as Tony clung desperately to the hope that once they got Project Phoenix up and running, Peter would be fine. Colonel Phillips having a front-row seat to the deconstruction of Howard Stark and the subsequent breakdown of Tony's relationship with Howard couldn't have been very easy either, especially since he knew exactly how Howard was set up to take the fall in the first place.
"I'm trying to say that something is coming—!" Peter cried, just as a circular metal ball rolled onto the ship, generating a blast that blasted him directly into one of the metal support beams of the ship. Giving his head a quick shake, Peter pushed himself up on his hands, his eyes landing on what appeared to be a woman with a set of antennae poking out of the top of her forehead.
"That's true," Tony said with a laugh. He honestly couldn't remember ever seeing his own parents be affectionate with each other so he knew his frame of reference wasn't great, but he also had a strong feeling that not too many of Peter's classmates had parents that seemed to like each other as much as his did.
"His lungs are almost completely clear now, Captain, just as I hoped they would be," she said. "We just needed to give his body a bit of time to heal itself."
And unfortunately, based on the SHIELD files Steve had studied since his recovery from the ice, plenty of organisations had tried.  His own teammate, Dr Banner, had been a member of one such organisation, and had also paid a hefty price for his participation.
"Here you are, Scott," Steve said as he offered him the plate. Scott immediately grabbed one of the sandwich halves, biting off a huge chunk and groaning in appreciation.
“Uh huh.”  Peter fiddled with his pencil, tapping the eraser against the keyboard.  He’d been just about ready to start snooping around in Dad’s files when Ned called, and he was already getting way past antsy.
“No, that’s not what I—”  Steve breaks off, letting out a heavy sigh.  He supposes they have plenty of time if Tony’s theory is correct.
“Mmm.”  Steve instinctively attempts to cross his arms, biting back a curse when the pain in his shoulder stops him about two-thirds of the way there.  “You’re thinking their falling out had something to do with Peter?”
"No, I don't think he would," said Steve. "Or at least, not yet. One, it's not safe to ask something like that right now because we can never be sure of who's listening, and two, it's not appropriate of me to put Colonel Phillips in a position where he'd likely have to disobey direct orders given to him by his own superior officers. He's done so much for us, Tony, I'm not going to do anything that might compromise his position."
The next couple of towers were taken in much the same manner, and after the fourth hit, Steve grabbed onto his shield, nodding at Natasha and Clint.
, he thought as he entered the gym, which he was relieved to see was empty. Blotting at his sweating forehead with a towel, Steve set up the first of his three punching bags, sucking in a deep breath before planting his feet and throwing a hard right hook directly into the centre of the first bag. A sharp pain immediately shot across his knuckles and up the lower half of his arm to his elbow, a harsh reminder that he had neglected to wrap up his hands before he began.
Exiting Peter's room, Steve headed next for the kitchen, following the strong scent of freshly-brewed coffee and frowning as he saw that the coffee pot was already half empty. He had learned of Tony's love of coffee—Steve flat-out refused to call it an addiction—way back when Peter was in the hospital in Afghanistan after their harrowing escape from the Ten Rings. But in the weeks since what the news people had taken to calling the Battle of New York, Tony's coffee consumption seemed to have grown exponentially.
Peter smiled again as he set down his plate, leaning back in his chair just as Uncle Thor erupted into another round of raucous cheering. The Rangers had scored a goal.
And while the optimistic part of Steve tried to focus more on the "if", the more pragmatic part of him knew that it was more likely to be "when", and that he needed to plan as such.
position he had been in while he was messing around with the Time Stone. "But I really don't think that—"
"Steve, honey, you're talking like this is already a done deal," Dad said gently. "And I know that committee meeting and what we saw down in D.C. isn't helping anything, but we've gotta remember that not everyone is buying into this stuff. If they were, they wouldn't've needed to hide it under a literal mountain of political rhetoric, so maybe we should just cool our heels until we know something more definite."
"Really?" Peter squeaked, rolling his eyes at his own absurd level of ridiculousness. "I mean, really? That's great! I'll, um… I'll ask Uncle Bucky tonight then and let you know?"
But Steve only shook his head, pressing a soft kiss to Tony's collarbone. "Sleep now, mo grá," he whispered. "I've got you."
"Well, that's a comfort," muttered Dad. "Why don't you try telling us something that we don't know?"
Tony's jaw twitched as he reached for Peter's hand under the blankets, cradling it like a delicate piece of glass.
And while Steve had never been a big fan of irony, as he crossed off the final items on his list and got ready for bed, he couldn't help but admit that he had just been slapped right in the face with it.  Hard.
"Oh, Christ," Tony muttered, his shoulders dropping. He probably would've figured that out as well if he hadn't been so distracted by the fucking
"Yeah," said Sam. "I can see why." He looked straight at Steve, shaking his head. "It was all in there, Steve. Operation Darkstalker is real."
"Thor showed up at the Tower about an hour ago with a weird haircut," Uncle Sam cut in, sounding grim. "He's also missing an eye, so your dad's already started on a new one while Cap debriefs him."
There was a short pause while Peter tried to figure out if Uncle Sam was joking or not, as his sense of humour tended towards the dry, sarcastic side. But several heartbeats later when he hadn't quirked his eyebrow or done anything else to indicate that he was kidding, Peter let out a gasp.
"But won't that take like, forever?" asked Scott. "I mean, you said it yourself that there's literally an infinite number of universes."
"But I still don't think Tony would want you to be worrying about it," Uncle Bucky said gently. "You're looking pretty wiped out, kiddo. I think you should only be worrying about yourself."
"Well…" Tony slowly walked around the hologram, muttering to himself as he took it in. The particle was definitely complex, but didn't appear to be any more so than the calculations for building his miniature arc reactor inside the Afghanistan cave had been.
Natasha laughed, tucking her hair behind her ear. "Well, you know it's not actually meant to be literal, but… hey. I didn't invent the language, I just grew up speaking it."
"No, he can't, can he?" said Tony. "That kid couldn't tell a convincing lie if his life depended on it."
“So… what, bud, hmm?” Tony says.  He holds out his hand, his eyes twinkling as Peter grabs onto it and hoists himself up.  “We’ll get some food into you and you’ll be just fine.”
“Hmph.  You talk like I’m the only one,” said Bucky.  “Pretty sure it’s been fucked up for a lot of us.  Including you.”
But now the summer was coming to a close, and while there hadn't been any whispers of any newly developing threats as of yet, Steve knew it was only a matter of time before someone or something else came along and the Avengers would be called to action.
"Yeah. If nothing else, I think it would give Ma some peace of mind to know the truth. She deserves it."
on board with getting naked with you right now. But honey… even mind-blowing sex won't get rid of the problem. It'll just… kinda mask it for awhile."
"I actually already have plans tomorrow afternoon," he finally said. "But I'd be up for it the day after."
“So, ah, Pete, you ready to get going?” he said, nearly tripping over the words.  “Get something to eat besides dusty orange chips?”
A sharp bolt of pleasure shot down the length of Tony's body, from the top of his head down to the very tips of his toes. They had just gotten cleaned up after making love not even ten minutes ago, and yet here was Steve, looking at Tony as though he had personally hung the moon, and ready to go all over again.
"He's fine, Steve. Or as fine as he can be," James said firmly as he pushed Steve into a sitting position, glaring harshly at him. "But you're sure as hell not. I mean, geez! What the hell are you doing?"
"Maybe it has something to do with Toomes or that Smythe guy?" Steve said. "One of them could've talked?"
Instead of responding, Steve rolled his hips, pressing Tony down at the same time and delighting in the gasp he pulled from his throat. Tony wasn't wrong that it was an unusual request. In fact, they had only done it that way a handful of times in the almost three years that they had been together. Steve usually preferred to be in control, and Tony knew it. He loved having Tony writhing and panting beneath him, and Tony was always more than willing to allow Steve that control because he himself didn't need it.
"Yeah, yeah, can't forget the troubleshooting." Phillips handed the papers back to Tony, tilting his head. "Will that give you enough time to go and see your kid too?"
"You—you're Dr Strange!" Steve blurted out, pointing at the tall, dark-haired man who for some reason was wearing a long maroon cape that, aside from the collar, looked a lot like Thor's.
And ever since the accident that had permanently grounded Rhodey from flying, his influence within the Air Corps higher-ups had significantly dropped.
"Jesus Christ, Steve, what the hell are you doing?" Tony demanded as he knelt down next to him, bleary-eyed and disheveled. He slid his arms underneath Steve's shoulders, trying to hoist him back up. "You trying to give me a heart attack or something?"
Peeling his eyes open again, Steve leaned forward to brush the messy curls from Peter's forehead, careful to avoid disturbing the white gauze bandage wrapped around his head. In addition to the concussion, broken ribs, and collapsed lung he had suffered, Peter had also cut open the back of his head when he slammed it against the roof, right above where he had suffered a similar injury during the Afghanistan bombing. Dr Cho had informed Steve that the cut wasn't that deep and would likely heal within hours, but given the severity of Peter's concussion she had stitched it up anyway, trying to limit how much she'd have to mess around with his head while he was trying to heal.
After an answering squeeze, Steve continued.  “February 15th, 2019.  I and what’s left of my team finally arrive at the field hospital.  After they stabilise him as best as they can with their limited medical supplies, Sergeant Barnes is prepped for transport back to the U.S.  The rest of us are ordered to go with him pending investigation of the explosions following the sniper shots.”  Steve paused again, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.  “An investigation that ended up going nowhere, Mr Stane, as even the very concept of an exploding bullet was deemed ‘too outrageous’ to be legitimate.”
Another day of this, no food and freezing cold, and he’s not going to be much use for anything.  Repaired leg or not.
Steve shook his head, his lips trailing across Tony's temple and cheek. "You've got me, sweetheart." He pressed a hard kiss to Tony's lips before pulling back again. "Can I—can I have you tonight? I want—I want to feel you around me before I have to leave, and—"
"Стив?" Bucky said, his shoulders trembling ever-so-slightly as he stared through his rifle's scope, ready to fire. "Стив, how long—?"
"Honey, I still don't think this is necessary," Tony said as he fiddled with Steve's time/space compass. "It's really not a big deal if I go in again, and—"
"No, no. I wasn't checking up on you, if that's indeed what you were asking," he said. "There are a few things that automatically get flagged whenever anyone conducts a query for them in the database, and Howard Stark's name just happens to be one of those."
Finally in a semi-upright position, Steve ran his tongue across his dry and cracked lips and tipped his head back against the cement-block wall, trying to keep his thoughts from wandering to Tony and Peter and managing to think of nothing else. Worry for his husband and son gnawed at him, consuming him from the inside, magnifying the pain coursing through his body to almost unthinkable levels.
"Yeah, okay," Tony muttered. He huffed out a deep breath, trying to relax his tight shoulders. "Go ahead and try again."
“Simulation is successful, sir,” JARVIS said a few heartbeats later.  “I am detecting no anomalies in either the structure or the composition of the final product.”
“There is nothing paranoid about me caring for your safety, child!” Dad snapped.  “As much as it may surprise you, there are plenty of people out there who would just love to get their grimy hands on you, and I can’t take the chance that someone’ll—”
"No, Daddy, please!" Peter cried as Tony hurried towards the door, his pathetic voice squeezing Tony's heart like a vise. "Please don't take me away, I don't wanna go!"
"Oh, yeah, sure he is. I don't believe that for a second," Blaster Guy snapped. "And how the hell does this other guy know my name, hmm? What're you, a psychic or something?"
"Not quite, but with a few minor modifications I can increase the range on the southeasternmost unit. Stand by."
“Yeah, that’s my kid,” he says as he drops Peter’s towel down onto his chest in a heap.  “Always the dramatic one, eh, buddy?”
"Yeah, that's right," answered Tony. "Unless the employee holds a personal patent on something, anything they've worked on or developed is considered to be Stark Industries property."
"Ah, go ahead and start on the render for the devices, yeah? Let's just make three for now, we can make the rest once we're able to test 'em out. Oh, and why don't you get another batch of the Pym Particles going too, yeah? I have a feeling we're gonna need 'em."
—no medal at all, would be devastating.  Both of Steve’s current sources of income, his endorsement deals with TYR and SwimOutlet.com, are dependent on him winning medals.  So if he doesn’t win medals, he doesn’t earn money.
Sam gave a nod, leaning forward. "You know, I just gotta say, that kid is absolutely brilliant. He hadn't even had a hold of Bucky's datapad for three minutes and he'd already broken through the Air Corps firewall."
but he didn't want to just dismiss them out of hand either. His family had already had far too much experience with shared and prophetic dreams. After Obadiah injected Peter with the HYDRA drug CTX-616 in Afghanistan, he started slipping into Bucky's dreams once they captured him following the Project Insight debacle, witnessing firsthand the murder of Tony's parents by the Winter Soldier.
"I was gonna blow you," Tony managed to get out as Steve's nimble fingers slipped between his legs, already slick with lube that he'd somehow managed to grab in between kisses. He choked on another moan as Steve carefully pushed two of those fingers inside him, peppering kisses all along his inner thighs and the base of his cock as he gently worked him open.
"Sounds good, J." Tony held out his phone, indicating for Lang to sign his electronic W-2, stepping back once he was done. "Someone from our cyber security department will contact you tomorrow with your first assignment, understood?"
"Стив, there," Bucky said as he tapped Steve on the arm. He pointed his rifle tip at the top of what looked like some kind of tank about ten metres away. "Let me get up there and see what I can see."
“Okay, how ‘bout we try this,” Peter said.  “That one day that Steve’s friends came into the store, one of ‘em had a metal arm.  And then later that week, Steve had a nightmare when he was here, right?”
Steve’s eyes had been there, in the dim light of the Quinjet.  Since Peter was born, Tony hadn’t dated much, and it had been so long—years, really—since he’d had any real inkling of actual sexual desire that he had almost forgotten what it felt like.
"So, you said you had something you needed to ask me?" he prompted after a few seconds of awkward silence. Rogers' face immediately flushed pink, his blue eyes flicking nervously around the cramped office.
"Really?" Tony asked. "You know how to cook?" Because of course Mr Perfection himself would also know his way around a kitchen.
Peter rolled his eyes.  Leave it to Dad to be rushing him now when he’d been waiting around for him all afternoon.
Bucky yelled as the Mets batter swung and missed a pitch that he'd had absolutely no business swinging at. "Now that was just goddamn ridiculous, is what that was!"
“C’mon, honey, pick up,” Tony murmured as he tried calling Steve again, dropping his arm to his side in a huff when he didn't answer.  Peter’s repeated concern that they shouldn't have left Steve alone all weekend suddenly flew to the forefront of Tony’s mind, and he let out a loud gasp as he tried calling him for the third time.
"Oh, sure," Sharon said, winking. "Guess that means they're not keeping you flyboys busy enough though, hmm?"
again once he got back from Italy, and Peter was certain that Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky would take him at least once.
“It’s a damn good thing at least some of the schools are still teaching civics,” Steve’s customer suddenly said as he came up next to Tony.  “I swear, so many of these young people nowadays don’t even know the difference between the House of Representatives and the Senate!”
"Mr Stark has agreed to commence repairs on Sergeant Barnes' prosthetic arm," JARVIS replied. "Apparently it suffered some damage during the battle in Miami."
"There," Tony said cheekily once they finally broke apart, flushed and panting. "See what you get when you listen to me?"
"Well, I promise I'm gonna always be here to take care of him when he's sick, all right?" Steve whispered into Peter's soft curls. "And you too, little guy. I'll take care of you both."
Steve shook his head, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown. "Well, that's a relief. But it also doesn't make much sense. Does it?"
Peter nodded as he picked up his own orange, taking care not to crush it as he attempted to peel it. He had grown another two centimetres since the trip to Italy, and had already managed to rip yet another backpack zipper and another two pairs of shoelaces. Both Papa and Uncle Bucky had been arm-wrestling with him in the evenings to help him learn to control his strength better, but he was getting to the point where he could beat them so easily now that he wasn't sure it was actually doing him any good anymore.
And it got even worse for Tony after Peter was born. Based on what Steve had gleaned from Colonel Phillips, as soon as Peter was diagnosed with his heart defect the government doubled-down, ordering more and more work from Tony with the promise of eventually granting permission for the very expensive operation required to heal Peter's heart. Steve had even gone so far as to ask Sharon Carter at the hospital if she knew of any more information that might be helpful, and while she had informed Steve that she technically wasn't allowed to tell him anything, he'd been able to gather enough information asking some basic yes or no questions to corroborate his theory.
"Apparently someone's aide got a little number-crunching happy and decided to calculate how many square metres are left in the facility versus how many square metres we've supposedly transported there, and for some reason they aren't adding up."
"Tony?" came Steve's voice over the comm. It was so weak that it was barely audible, but still one of the sweetest things that Tony had ever heard in his life. "Tony, what's going on? Everything just kinda lit up a few seconds ago, and—"
Finally free of the grass, Peter lurched forward, shooting a web just as Gwen's hands slipped free from the railing. He cried out as the web caught her around the waist, just a split-second too late to prevent her head from snapping against the rock-hard floor.
"We think it might've been a man by the name of Hank Pym," Steve said. "He was another civilian scientist working for the Air Corps, and was also personally present when Howard Stark was arrested. And as soon as Howard was found not guilty, he up and disappeared. No one's seen or heard from him since."
"That's it!" Peter said, his horror briefly tempered by his excitement at finally figuring it out. He tapped his tablet screen, highlighting the line he'd just read.
"Excellent, Ned, that's correct!" Gwen exclaimed with a wide smile. "Now, Peter, can you tell me the atomic mass of tungsten?"
"Yeah, well, since when are history books completely accurate?" Gwen said, her green eyes twinkling. "It must be nice to get all the answers to your questions right from the source instead of a book."
Groaning, Peter tipped his head back against the seat, lolling it to look at Tony.  “Dad, it’s so obvious it’s like the two of you are walking around with cartoon bubbles above your heads!  You and Steve like each other!”
Except, he didn't.  After five rings, the call just disconnected, as Steve apparently hadn't bothered to set up his voicemail.
But still, the arm seemed to enjoy aching, and the annoying constant tingly sensation was absolutely not helping Tony's patience.
"What? No! That can't be possible!" Peter exclaimed. Even the thought that the Avengers could actually lose was horrifying.
"You'll always be here," Steve breathed against Tony's neck as his thrusts slowly gained speed. "Tell me you'll always be here."
Tony opened one sleepy eye. "Takes one to know one, honey," he murmured as he twisted around in Steve's arms. His lips formed a full-on grin as he trailed his fingers across Steve's right nipple, pulling a choked gasp from Steve's throat. "Hmm. Seems like you've got a situation here,
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! ♥️
like not being able to anticipate what was going to happen in a battle. "But I don't think this is over yet."
"So," Tony said once Peter had finished polishing off three servings of Sam's homemade gumbo and drank about a litre of Powerade. "You feel like telling us why you felt the need to go after Toomes' lackeys all by yourself?"
Thanks to all of that, it was all Tony could do to remember his own name as he introduced himself, and hope against hope that his rough mechanic’s hand didn't gross Steve out when he shook it.  From what he could tell, Steve seemed a little nervous at first, but didn’t seem too weirded out by either Tony or Peter.  If anything, it seemed like Steve had kind of a sad air to him at first, like he was being weighed down by something, an air that seemed to dissipate some over the course of Peter’s tryout to the point where when Steve told them he would see them tomorrow, he seemed to be genuinely looking forward to it.
Dr Strange had said. And while Peter supposed he could just chalk it up to the wizard's overall weirdness—and really, was there a wizard out there who
"That was the mission you guys went on before the whole Project Insight mess, wasn't it?" Tony asked, pinching the bridge of his nose. He had been nursing a headache for the last several hours, and was well overdue for more coffee.
"Well, they're only the two smartest people on the entire planet," Steve said, with whatever he'd been planning to say next dying on his lips as Tony suddenly appeared on the opposite side of the aisle, standing next to James.
"Better not tell it like that to my dad," Peter warned. Dad had told both Peter and Papa that after his flight through the portal and the massive army he saw amassed there, he had no desire to ever go into space again.
“A single gunshot,” Peter murmured, tapping the eraser of his pencil on his keyboard.  “Witnesses insist that it began as a single gunshot… JARVIS, this has to be it!  This has to be what caused the explosion that hurt Steve’s friend!”
"Once we know how to win, then we go back in before the point in our time where we branched off from the winning timeline, and fix things," explained Tony. "Think of it like a tree, where a bunch of different timelines are all branching out from a single trunk. At a certain point they all started out in the same spot, so—"
Steve huffed out a frustrated sigh as he wound his arm around Tony's shoulders. "There's no new information, and judging by where in Africa the event occurred, there probably won't be any anytime soon. Director Fury told me that this country, Wakanda, doesn't talk to the outside world all that much."
"We definitely will," said Steve as he squeezed Tony's hand. "And on that note, Tony and I need to be going. Peter's been pretty tired lately, and we don't want to keep him waiting." He pulled out his wallet, intending to pay the bill when James stopped his hand.
Despite Peter's fatigue and overall jitteriness, the school day passed rather quickly, and he was relieved when he and Ned took their seats in the gym for Decathlon practise. The theme for the year was In Sickness and In Health: An Exploration of Illness and Wellness, and Peter was very much looking forward to the challenge of it since the previous year's theme had been purely science-oriented, and therefore really easy.
As soon as the two men were out of sight Steve opened his book and quickly became engrossed, barely noticing the mess hall emptying around him until one of the members of the cleanup crew tapped him on the shoulder.
As if on cue, Peter's stomach growled, causing them both to laugh. "I guess I'll take that as a yes?" asked Papa.
“I wish I could’ve met him,” said Steve.  He quickly closed down his register, entering his sales for the day onto his spreadsheet.  Then he tucked away the cash into its safe and switched off the lights, crossing the steps off on his list.
“Damn, that’s rough,” Tony whispers.  “But if he was hurt, why the hell did he swim in the first place?”  Tony has never claimed to be an expert in sports, but he would think that no one in their right mind would push an athlete to compete through an injury.  Especially when swimmers aren’t getting paid like football or basketball stars.
"I have received no reply as of yet from Agent Bartlett, sir," JARVIS said. "Would you like me to put in another call to his office?"
"What?" Peter said, grimacing in surprise. "But that doesn't make any sense? JARVIS wouldn't just disappear unless one of us told him to, so—"
Which it didn't, thank goodness.  The last thing Tony needed at the moment was the entire penthouse smelling like burnt popcorn.
Unfortunately, figuring it out would likely require putting all three of them through a massive barrage of tests, which was something that Tony knew he could never bring himself to do. Steve still spoke bitterly about his time of being treated as a human lab rat following his serum procedure, and there was no way that Tony would ever make him go through something like that again. And Bucky had already been experimented on enough for three lifetimes, and Peter… well… that was just a hard no.
"Yeah, hon. I guess you're right," he whispered, chuckling when Steve's stomach suddenly growled. "Guess it's time for breakfast now, hmm?"
"I just brought you your tea," Steve whispered as he brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "I'm sorry I woke you."
As a matter of fact, Steve distinctly remembered even seeing Carol cry a couple of times, when she'd thought no one else was around. Most of the time Carol was as tough as they came, one of the strongest people that Steve had ever seen, but she had confessed to him once Colonel Rhodes had "recovered" that not being able to be there for him when he'd needed her had been one of the hardest things she'd ever endured in her life.
Being embedded within the Air Corps for as long as he'd been, Tony had heard plenty of stories about the voracious sexual appetites of the pilots, with some even bragging about how they had worked sex into their pre- or post-flight routines.
Thor gave a nod. "Yes, that is true. Your encounter here has only solidified my theory that the gem inside Loki's sceptre is in fact one of the six infinity stones. More specifically, the Mind Stone." He paused, tapping his palm on the table. "It is also my belief that it was this stone that was driving Loki's madness when he attacked this planet. I know that Loki has caused all of us great pain, but I also know that he was not himself during that time, and I believe this is why."
"Yes, if you want to call it that," answered Steve, this time letting out a full-blown laugh. He bought Tony's hand to his lips again, kissing it over his wedding ring. "I don't think you can blame me for looking forward to bringing my husband and son home. And if that home just happens to turn into that incredible estate we stayed in on the Italian coast, well… then so be it."
Because as much as Mags might like to think otherwise, Tony is just not ‘good’.  He’s the son of a man who’s literally made billions selling weapons, and was barely a hair’s breadth away from following in Howard’s footsteps when he got the phone call that would take his entire life and turn it right on its ear.
, he thought as he peeled his eyes back open, a slow smile stretching across his lips as he attempted to take it all in.  Thanks to Dad’s work, Peter had done quite a bit of travelling, and had visited plenty of so-called bookstores that sold more toys and other accessories than actual books.
"Yes, it does make sense," said Steve with a heavy sigh. "Which likely means it's Hammer who now has the schematics for the Iron Legion."
"No, thanks," Tony said as he set down his empty glass, ignoring it when it tipped over onto the blanket. Then he cupped Steve's face in his hand, angling it down so he could reach his lips.
"Oh, come on!" he cried. Throwing out his arm, Peter blindly shot out his web, barely managing to catch the very edge of the spaceship. Grunting, he pulled himself back up to the ship, managing to find what appeared to be a panel that led into an inner level. Dad was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the wizard or alien.
The monster roared again, drowning out any reply that Steve might have made. "Skin to skin contact," he muttered as he quickly laid Peter across his lap, shrugging out of his leather jacket and t-shirt before tearing Peter's Spider-Man suit right down the front, exposing his skinny chest. He then gathered Peter close, chest to chest, wrapping his jacket around Peter's back like a blanket and tucking his head under his chin.
"I hope so," Steve murmured. "I just hope that we're not gonna get to that point and then have someone try and tell us that he's beyond hope or something."
As soon as they stepped out of Peter's room Steve took Tony's hand, leading him down the hall to their bedroom. Tony had designed the spacious room like a loft, with a large sitting area furnished with the same kind of comfy, squashy furniture they had in their Tower penthouse and Compound apartment. There was also a section over by the corner windows set up like a small art studio for Steve, with the bed and bedside tables situated about two-thirds of a level above, up a small flight of stairs and overlooking the rest of the room.
"I don't know Colonel Rhodes that well, but he seems like a really good guy," said Steve. "And a fine officer."
“I’m shutting down the company’s weapons’ division, effective the very second the last of our outstanding orders are fulfilled,” Tony said, ignoring Pepper’s shocked gasp.  “And I’ll need this statement ready for release at that precise time.  Can you do that for me?”
"Whoa there, child!" Dad exclaimed with wide eyes. "That's a pretty grown up word coming out of such a young mouth!"
"Thanks," Peter murmured as he slid the dark glasses into place. "So… um… they ran out of coffee? How'd that happen?"
“Look, bud, how ‘bout this,” Dad said before Peter could say anything else.  “How ‘bout you give me one more hour, and then I promise I’ll have JARVIS turn off all calls from the office for the entire weekend.  Hmm?  That sound okay?”
Davis's large nose gave a twitch. "Yes, well, it did seem as though things finally went your way at that point, isn't that right, Captain?"
"Oh yeah, sure," Steve said as he pushed open the locker room door, surprised when Bucky didn't laugh. "Wait, you're being serious?"
"Um… well… no, I guess—well, yeah. Actually, you did, but it's—it's okay though, I'm… ahh… I'm just a bit tired, and—"
Tony huffed, groaning at the pleasure already building deep inside his gut. He slid his hands down his husband's shoulders and upper chest to his gorgeous pectorals, grinning at Steve's hard shudder as he scraped his thumbnails across his nipples.
Steve huffed, hesitating. While Wanda and Pietro had been official Avengers for a while now, they were still so young—only about three years older than Peter—that he'd been hesitant to put them on the front lines.
They were silent as they headed to the elevator, the slight jingle of Steve’s medals the perfect metronome to their matching footsteps.  He knew they were prepared for what was coming.  Thanks to Peter’s tireless research and the documents that Colonel Rhodes had provided, Steve knew their case was as airtight as it could possibly get.
"Yeah babe, that's exactly what I'm thinking," Tony answered. "This must be the guy who caused the lake to freeze over up at the Compound."
attempt to enter any Avengers facility without the express, face-to-face verbal permission of either Steve or myself. Is that clear?"
"Pete came up with the idea that instead of making the satellites into weapons, we could instead have them function as continuous energy conduits. There's a device, one that the government's kept a deep, dark secret for years, that if utilised correctly could be a source of unlimited clean energy, and Pete got the idea that if we took that device and channelled its energy through the satellites and into the planet's power plants, that—"
He trailed off, but Steve caught his meaning anyway. Since the very beginning of their relationship, Tony had practically cowered into a corner like a wounded animal every time they had a simple disagreement, shredding Steve's heart to pieces in the process. And then a few minutes later, once he'd realised that Steve had backed down, he would lash out at Steve, just as a wounded animal would.
"Probably," Bucky answered. "And they kinda look like the ones in Star Wars too, don't ya think? We'll have to tell Петр all about 'em once he comes back."
Well, Steve always had always had a bit of a flair for the dramatic. And caring for Steve afterwards did manage to snap Tony out of his crushing, grief-induced fog.
"And how exactly would you know it, huh?" Dad shouted. "Just because your friend Gwen is a sweetheart doesn't mean that her old man can't be an asshole!"
Instinctively, Tony leaned his head back against Steve's collarbone, feeling the tense muscles across his shoulders relax at his touch.
"Is breá limo an oiread sin," Steve whispered. "I love you so much, sweetheart, tell me what you want. Inis dom conas is féidir liom tú a shásamh."
But instead of flipping to the drawing of the Harley Davidson he still had yet to finish, Steve turned to a clean page and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes so he could conjure up an image of Tony Stark in his mind's eye.  Steve’s lips curled into a soft smile as he slotted all of the details into place, focusing in on certain aspects of Tony’s features that had stood out the most.
Immediately Tony stepped back, raising his hands. "Yeah, yeah, sure thing. Just let me know when you need a break."
"Then it would have to be someone from the inside," said Steve. "Someone working for Damage Control."
"Actually, I've got a couple ideas about that," Tony cut in, and proceeded to explain his theory about the drone targeting range. Bruce listened intently, scribbling notes as he usually did and giving the occasional nod.
"Uh huh," Peter said, attempting a smile. "He told me something about a belated birthday party at the lake."
Ducking his head under Dad's chin, Peter breathed slowly in, trying to let the sound of Dad's heartbeat, barely audible through his armour, work its usual calming magic on him.
Tony was in such a haze of want that he didn't even think about what Steve might find under his shirt until he'd already slipped it over his head. As soon as Steve tossed it onto the floor the worry wrinkle appeared between his eyebrows, his calloused fingertips gently tracing the faint scar bisecting the centre of Tony's chest.
"It's not ideal, but I'm kinda used to that by now," admitted Tony. "Each pilot carrying twice as many satellites means they'll have to deploy them all, which means they'll each be up there twice as long, but—"
"I know, Steve, okay?" Tony snapped, instantly regretting his harsh words when Steve's face fell. "Jesus, honey, I didn't mean—"
For about three seconds the entire Control Room was so quiet that Tony could hear the thud of his own heart, until Cameron Mitchell suddenly let out a shriek so ear-splitting that Tony was shocked the windows didn't shatter.
"I don't care so much about that anymore," said Tony. "I only want my boy to live. Pete's completely innocent in all of this."
"Well, anyway, it's all in the past now," Steve said. He pulled Tony into a tight hug, trailing his fingertips up and down his spine. "Look, it's been a pretty long day, so why don't we go to bed? Try and get some good sleep?"
Steve's heart fluttered. Peter's tight, arms-around-the-neck hugs had quickly become one of Steve's favourite things, and something he very much needed at the moment.
Steve breathes in, willing himself not to tear up.  There was a time when he believed that, a time when he thought he was loved.  And it turned out to be nothing more than a façade.
"He's ready, Mr Stark," Sharon said as she attached the radiation hose and backed away, counting the seconds on her timepiece. "We've got thirty seconds before he'll need another breath."
"Steve, you don't have to replace your alarm clock just because of me," Tony said. "It's not that big of a deal."
“It could very well be, Master Peter,” said JARVIS.  “However, I am still unsure as to how this is helpful.”
“Ah, don’t mention it,” answers Tony, nearly drowned out by one of Hulk’s roars as he and Thor start thundering down the road, taking out enemy agents and weapons as they go.
"Yep, that's right. Well… that was my initial plan for the mission. The satellites would be the new line of national defence, which once operational would reduce the need for constant air patrols, and theoretically reduce Air Corps and civilian casualties as a result of constant air strikes."
"It does, sir," answered JARVIS. "Shall I commence with the rendering once my diagnostics are complete?"
"Yeah… okay… okay…" Tony pressed his palm to his chest, sucking in a deep breath. His heart was racing so fast that he felt dizzy, and he still wasn't quite convinced that he wasn't dreaming.
"Oh my God!" Gwen shrieked as she shoved the candies into her pocket, then changed her mind and ran back towards the kitchen, returning with a piece of lemon candy from the smell of it.
"Eh, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it," Tony said as he scratched at the back of his head. "And I'm sure Steve won't mind it either."
Thor gave a nod. "I do indeed. It is my belief that this secret place, Wakanda, might be the home to one of the six infinity stones."
All of which meant that they were rapidly running out of time. If Tony didn't figure out how to restore Steve's power soon, then—
"Oh," Peter said. "Well, I guess that makes sense since you guys are Norse gods and all. But what's going on? What happened?"
Tony said as Steve broke away, kissing a path down his jaw to his throat and latching onto his pulse point. "You're distracting me, babe."
And it was probably not a good idea to try and mess with those factors in the heat of the moment. Or try and rewrite warp theory to better suit his purposes.
Steve thought desperately. He tried to pinch himself, to prove that he was just trapped in one of his nightmares, but he was too frozen with dread to even move.
Peter cut in, shuddering when his voice cracked like a piece of glass on the final syllable.  He cleared his throat, deliberately trying to lower it.  “Ned’s mom even offered to give me a ride home, and I told her I didn’t need one ‘cause you were on your way!”
"Well, we'll be heading out to the field again tomorrow afternoon if you wanna come," said Bucky. "Pretty sure Carol said that she'd be available too. We could have two on two."
Actually, he still had pretty crazy hair. No matter which direction he tried to get his curls to go they always seemed to have their own rather unpredictable plan, and he had pretty much given up trying to tame them. What little energy he did have was far better spent on things besides arm-wrestling his hair into place.
"No, he knew better than to mention that name in front of my ma," said Steve. "All he told me was that I was damn lucky I was my papa's son 'cause there'd be no chance in hell I'd be there otherwise, and that it was going to hurt. I never found out where it came from or who developed it."
He supposes he’s had it coming.  Sharon was still pretty upset with him yesterday for his lousy progress on his range of motion, so… nothing like a looming crisis to finally get Steve to step up his game.
"But he does exist!" Peter snapped. "And the sooner you start admitting that to yourself the better you'll be! And he thinks this can work! He even helped me with a bit of the code, so—"
An awkward pause followed, punctuated by Dad and Papa turning to look at each other at the exact same time, both of them wearing the same wary expression. "Wow," Dad finally said. "I guess I didn't realise that you two were such good friends already."
“Okay, but that’s not necessarily you, right?” Natasha says.  “I mean, everyone in the department knows how smart you are, and—”
into the Arctic water to keep it from unleashing its Tesseract-powered bombs onto New York City, and that's exactly what he had been doing in the dream as well. Only in his dream it had been in the here and now, not 1944, which meant that—
"Beating ourselves up over what ifs never helps anything, right?" Steve cut in. "Isn't that what Sam's always telling us?"
Tony gritted his teeth, attempting to ignore the mention of Howard. "There's also gonna be a pretty massive political mess once Meridia finds out that we even have the thing, Pete. As far as we know, they don't even know that the tesseract exists, and—"
"You are quite correct, Captain," replied JARVIS. "At the risk of sounding presumptuous, I believe I know better than to interrupt during your… private times unless it was absolutely necessary."
"So," he continued once everyone was quiet. He reached into his pocket, activating the scrambler that Tony had given him. "Sam, why don't we start with what you and Bucky were able to find with Peter this afternoon."
"Yeah, I remember." Dad cleared his throat, reaching tentatively for the coffee cup and taking a small sip. "Well, I guess that is pretty handy. Did Miss Stacy happen to have any other information about that place?"
Tony was almost asleep by the time Steve pulled out of him, pecking his lips one final time before rising from the bed and heading for his tiny bathroom. He returned a couple minutes later with a warm cloth, gently cleaning the sweat and come from Tony's body. Then he slipped into the bed next to him and gathered him into his arms, tucking Tony's head under his chin. Tony had never been much for cuddling after sex. He'd never even spent the entire night with someone, preferring to sneak out in the wee hours of the night and risk being caught out after curfew than face the awkwardness of waking up next to someone that he'd just as soon never have to see again.
"He's proposing to develop a new type of holographic system," said Pepper. "And while there's nothing inherently wrong with the basic premise of it, there's just some aspects of the proposal that I'd really appreciate your input on, if you don't mind."
Tony wondered as he settled Peter down on the living room couch.  After piling some throw pillows next to him to prop up his left hand, Tony slid off his son’s shoes and set them on the other side of the coffee table, hopefully out of tripping distance.
Was Steve really worth all of that?  Was he worth the inevitable embarrassment and tabloid fallout that would accompany Tony’s removal from the company that his own father built?  Was Steve worth ruining Peter’s inheritance, and forcing them out of their home?
Peter nodded against Papa's chest, swallowing against the knot in his throat. "I know. I think sometimes I just need to hear it."
"I expect to land in Namibia in approximately eight hours, Captain, provided that current weather conditions remain as anticipated," answered JARVIS.
But here, Steve could only guess what the team would potentially be up against. There was little doubt in his mind that when the Chitauri did return, they would do so in far greater numbers, and with the power of potentially multiple infinity gems spurring them on, Steve had no way of knowing just how powerful they might be.
"I knew it," she said softly. "I just knew something was up. You've been acting off all night tonight, so I just—"
"Steve?" Natasha said, softly, but still enough to cause Steve to startle. "Steve, this could do it! This could bring everybody back!"
Another three minutes ticked by until JARVIS spoke up, "Pardon me, sir. Mr Beck wishes to apologise for his tardiness, and would like to inform you that he is running late and will arrive in the conference room within the next ten minutes."
"Tony, please!" Steve pleaded as he reached again for Tony's waist. "Please, why can't we just go back to bed? I think if we just—"
"Eh, don't congratulate me yet," Bucky said. "Ring shopping is one thing, but actually popping the question, that's just kinda yikes. I still haven't quite worked that part out yet."
Papa's face immediately drained of colour. "Oh, wow," he whispered, more to himself than to Peter. "Only ten more minutes till I'm married."
“Okay, so… it’s obvious that the document’s been altered, so… now we’ve just gotta figure out who the hell did it, and what it actually says underneath all that redaction.”
"Getting them to agree to let us use the tesseract," said Peter. "Yeah, I know. And that's what Grandpa said too."
"Watch it be something really obscure," Peter whispered to Gwen. "Liz likes to think of the weirdest things sometimes."
"You do?" Tony said, realising that he sounded way too excited. "I mean, you really think that… Mantis could put Thanos to sleep like she did with your father/planet?"
Steve let out a heavy sigh as he lifted his head, propping himself up on his elbow. "No, sweetheart, I just—I can't help but think… what are we missing? There has to be something that we've overlooked, something hidden in those files that we haven't found yet that connects more of the dots."
"Phoenix One and Two, most of that fire is aiming directly at ya, so you two get your asses out of the atmosphere ASAP!" screamed Colonel Phillips. "You hear me? ASAP!"
“It’s unlikely that he’s been moved from the general area,” Fury said.  “My undercover agent hasn’t seen anything that would indicate a prisoner transfer, and—”
Tony's lower lip shook as he glanced down at Steve's chest. "Yeah, honey," he whispered. "I'd—I'd like that."
Steve nearly choked as he saw Image Peter nod, his brown eyes briefly flashing orange as he let go of the railing.
“Oh, God!” Steve said out loud, both out of excitement and despair as he raked his fingers through his hair.  “He said he’d see me tomorrow!”
It was all Peter could do to force a smile as he took the phone from the pretty nurse. He should've known it wasn't going to happen since the sun was almost completely set already, but…
"Thanks," said Tony. He sat down next to Peter on the bed, brushing the hair off his forehead. "You're gonna be okay, buddy, yeah? Papa's Ma's gonna take really good care of you."
Sniffing, Tony glanced up at the clock. It was already 2030, only thirty minutes before Steve was due to pick him up, which meant he had just enough time to call Peter before he went to sleep for the night.
Not only was the Air Corps holding Tony hostage with their ridiculous demands on his time and intellect, they were also apparently sending their pilots in to stalk and harass his boy.
That leader had been Hitler, and while JARVIS hadn't yet found anything linking President Cole to HYDRA itself or any known individuals involved in the Nazi organisation, Steve had a sinking feeling that it was there, just lying in wait somewhere beneath the many layers of rhetoric.
that I'll ever give up on my son." He sucked in another deep breath, forcibly removing his hands from Howard's robe as he took a step back, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. It would not do well for him to self-combust right before his date.
Tony's heart soared. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been able to cuddle with Peter while he slept.
Quill was silent for a moment, his expression implying he was thinking, although there was no way Tony could be sure. While he waited for a response, he looked around. He had been keeping Peter right by his elbow ever since Quill released him, not wanting him out of his sight, and Strange had wandered off on his own as soon as the group got outside, and was now sitting in the
"Peter? What's wrong?" Gwen asked, her eyes going wide as the floor shaking grew even louder and more violent. A second later Uncle Bucky was at Peter's side, the fingers of his good hand curling around Peter's forearm just as another hard shiver wracked his body, and his ears picked up the horrible sound of cracking wood and plaster.
"Yeah, well, that's probably a good thing," Pepper said with wide eyes. She tapped the files in front of her with her pen. "Anyway, Tony, I have a favour to ask of you. I just got a bunch of performance reviews to sign off on, and as I've been going through them I've been noticing a few… discrepancies, I guess is a good word. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind—?"
“Okay.”  Tapping the commands into the computer, Peter held his finger over the final button until Papa nodded.  “Activating interface.”
Reluctantly Peter released her, watching as she exited the bathroom. Then he grabbed his backpack and opened the busted window latch, crawling out of the building. He took care to stay low and out of the streetlights until he was two blocks over, where he was able to hail a taxi and head for the airport.
“Mr Stark told me his son completed all of the swimming classes at the Y by the time he was seven,” says Lorraine.  “He also said that the kid’s doctor recommended that he try swimming, so it sounds like he has some kind of medical issue.”
"I'm real, mo grá. I'm real, and I'm here, and you're in my bed and in my arms, and I love you so damn much that I can't even tell you! Ni féidir liom maireachtáil gan tú, Tony. Ciallaíonn tú gach rud domsa, agus anois, ba mhaith liom go tiocfaidh tú chugam!" Steve trailed his fingertips gently over the scars marking the centre of his chest and down to his pelvis, curling his fingers around Tony's aching erection and stroking him in time with his thrusts. "You're so beautiful, sweetheart, I want to see you come for me!"
"Oh, I doubt that, sir," Steve replied, his eyes still fixed on Anthony. "Somehow I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy it even more than I expected."
inside his laboratory while he was attempting to gauge the energy output from the strangely glowing cube, and it was that incident that then led to his arrest following the massive explosion that wiped out not only the main Langaran power plant and every structure and person both in and around it, but was also powerful enough to nearly level the nearby mountain.
"Okay, and I completely understand that," Scott insisted. "But I'm telling you that I've been inside the Quantum Realm twice now. And Hank's been in there, and so has Hank's wife. And she was stuck in there for thirty years before Hank found her again, so there has to be some way that we can figure out how to make this work."
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints, and also to adoctoraday for the gorgeous moodboard! 💗
"Good," Steve said, smiling softly. "Now, after I get you a cool washcloth for your forehead and fluff up your pillows, I'm gonna go into the kitchen and make you some of my ma's chicken noodle soup and her cinnamon/honey tea. And while I'm gone, I want you to stay in this bed, all right? No getting up unless you've gotta use the bathroom or something. Okay?" He held his breath as Tony's lips twitched, his eyes scanning Steve's face as though he was looking for something specific.
Surprisingly, despite his swirling mind, Steve was able to doze off for a couple hours, only waking after the Quinjet began its descent into Namibia. Blinking his eyes open, Steve raised his head, pressing against a sore spot on his neck as Sam's voice came over the intercom.
Tony's heart gave a flutter as he looked into Steve's gorgeous blue eyes, those eyes that were a clear window deep into his soul. He was still sometimes taken aback by how much love he saw in those eyes, even during the smallest of passing glances. He knew that he shouldn't be. Steve had demonstrated his love for both Tony and Peter too many times to count. But Tony still couldn't help it.
Howard Stark's trial for conspiracy and treason had stretched on for almost three years, permeating so thoroughly throughout the battered Langaran society that even though he was eventually found not guilty, he, along with Maria and Tony, were already so ostracised by the general public that it might've honestly been easier on everyone if he had been convicted. Mr Jarvis had warned Tony that the trial of public opinion would be harsher and crueler than any criminal trial could ever be, and he had been absolutely correct. So correct that until Tony turned seventeen, he never went anywhere out in society without Mr Jarvis at his side.
"Got it, Cap," said Bruce as he grabbed a medical kit and jumped out of the truck, hurrying over to where Sam was laying the man out on the grass with Steve on his heels. The man's skin was very pale, almost translucent, and from what Steve could see he appeared to be having some sort of fit or seizure, with his entire body twitching like he was being electrocuted.
"They will both pay for what they have done with their lives, just as you will," she sneered. "Thanos will have that stone."
Despite his attempt at bravery, Tony couldn't help but flinch as he heard the doorbell echo inside the house, followed only a few seconds later by the sound of slowly approaching footsteps.
"Oh my God, Tony, you scared me!" Steve exclaimed as he brushed the sweat-matted hair from Tony's forehead, his skin so dry and hot that it was like touching the one of the tarred Brooklyn streets in the middle of summer.
"Yeah, my eyes are pretty good," Peter said with a chuckle. "One of the few parts of my body that actually work correctly."
"Oh God," Peter gasped, his belly giving a violent swoop as he realised on second thought that no, they were not the same kind of sentry suits that had been circling the prison's perimeter. Instead, the suits now standing at attention in front of Peter's window had all been outfitted with Chitauri tech stolen from the Department of Damage Control, which Peter feared meant that they were pretty much indestructible.
"Yeah, that was our impression of him as well," said Steve. "He tried to teach a class for us a couple years ago, and it just—well, let's just say that I probably could've taught it better."
"No!" Tony said firmly. He honestly didn't think he could bear hearing Steve say it again. "Don't you dare say it, you understand me? Everything's going to be just fine, so," and he clenched down on Steve's fingers, wiggling his hips," why don't you just get on with it, yeah? 'Cause my patience is starting to run very, very thin."
Tony smiled, his lips twitching ever so slightly, like he still couldn't quite believe it when Steve told him he loved him.
Unfortunately, while Adrian Toomes had been arrested on charges of doctoring official Damage Control books, they couldn't yet charge him with theft of government property because they had yet to actually recover anything that he'd been suspected of stealing. And, while the conversation Peter overheard indicated that Toomes had been speaking to someone who apparently didn't like Tony very much, they couldn't as of yet figure out who it was as all of Toomes' phone records were erased by an outside third party before he was even arrested, and erased so well that not even JARVIS had been able to recover them.
"Okay, well, enough about that now," Tony said. "We've got more important things to worry about first."
"Never thought I'd enjoy being carried around so much," Tony said as Steve crawled up to hover over him, carefully removing his glasses. "But damn if it isn't sexy as hell when you do it."
"So I suppose the only remaining question, is Hammer working for HYDRA or is HYDRA working for him?" asked Steve.
Steve needed to think, and to plan. He needed to figure out a way to keep attacks like this from ever happening again, and he couldn't do that if his focus was even more splintered than it already was.
"I will take him out," Thor finished. He clapped a strong hand on Steve's shoulder. "Very good, Captain."
Uncle Bucky huffed, moving one of his bishops with a lot more force than was probably necessary. "I don't—I don't know, Peter," he said quietly. "I just—I don't know. We'll just have to wait and see."
But so far it had all just seemed like a massive waste of time, since besides HYDRA's manifesto, all he'd been able to uncover had been nothing but a bunch of supply lists and personnel shift assignments.
"Steve, honey, do you read?" Tony asked as he ran down the steps and out onto the runway, shielding his eyes from the bright sun as he scanned the sky for Steve's aircraft. "Steve, are you there?"
“Yeah, just a minute!”  He dried off his hands, dropping the towel onto his counter in a heap as he ran his fingers through his hair.
"He's in surgery at the moment, bud," Dad said. "He's… well… one of his arms got pretty messed up, and they're not sure if they're gonna be able to save it or not, so… we'll know more once he's out, but—"
"Tony!" Steve cried as he thrust one final time and came, his entire broad body shaking as he spilled inside Tony, finally collapsing down half on top of him.
“I understood that reference,” Tony says with just the slightest hint of humour.  “And, yeah, I actually have a couple of ideas on that one.  But if it’s all the same to you, I’d like a few more minutes to ponder ‘em.  They’re a little half-baked at the moment.”
Little Steve whispered as his fingertips made contact with the crisp white paper, so much nicer than the rejected newsprint and old package wrapping he'd been using. A knot rose in Steve's throat as he watched his little boy self pick up one of the sketchbooks like it was made of glass, turning it carefully over in his hands before clutching it possessively to his chest. Next, he picked up a box of five pencils, one red, one black, and the remaining three in varying shades of grey.
"Think about it, Tony," he finally said, low and tight. "Who would take considerable joy from copying Stark weapon’s designs?"
is to go back to bed!" Tony snapped, his temper finally getting the better of him. "And I mean actually go to sleep, not go poking your nose where it doesn't belong.
"Put him through, J!" Tony snapped. He whipped around, trying to force his face into a scowl, which failed miserably as soon as Steve's haggard face appeared on the screen.
“Your handwriting is beautiful, Tony,” he says, with as much sincerity as he can muster.  “But it’s not as beautiful as you.”
"I'll second that," said Clint. "Pretty sure our main concern is gonna be keeping Thanos away from the Soul Stone, not any of our teammates."
He squeezed his eyes closed, breathing in deeply through his nose before turning to Hammer, squaring his shoulders.
