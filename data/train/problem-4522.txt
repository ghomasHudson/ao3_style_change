Dean sighs very loudly and sits up rapidly. He doesn’t want to lie next to this thing, whether it has any connotations or not. “What do you want?” he asks, voice too fucking tired to even sound properly angry.
And she bought him the scissors. Told him she wanted to make sure her gnome was always well-armed.
“Pest control,” he answers, clipped. “Still waiting for the answer to my question.”
“Speaking of the future,” he says, attempting to wipe tiredness off of his face (no effect), “remind me not to drink so much before I go to bed. Or scratch that. Remind me to drink more.”
“Do you?”
You can find it
Castiel nods. “It’s okay to bid your farewells.”
Castiel’s face blooms with impatience to that. “You really don’t want to fuck with me on this one, Dean,” he says matter-of-factly as he makes a beckoning gesture and Dean’s body just swoops into his grip like a battery-powered sack of potatoes. His hand on Dean’s neck is sticky and at least three shades too firm for a painless secure hold. “What did you do and who helped you?”
“With these eyes? No.”
He glances at them once more and savors the offended look on Dean’s face so well paired with annoyed rude gestures and hissing because they apparently really liked being able to use legs. Well, this is where that ends.
“Dean, I felt responsible for you. I tried---”
“You’re fucking greedy, you know that? You’ll get all the fun stuff and a goddamn pony when we get back. Wait.”
“Oh, honey, and I’m way too old for turning tricks. More of a picky pro bono kinda guy and just for the record, I’d make it worth your while,” he smirks as he takes the seat. “If you ever want a raincheck on that, that is.”
He’d expect “God” to have more books. More things. The very few shelves are scarce in belongings. Musty incunabula in languages he’s never fucking seen before. Books that aren’t much younger. Might as well be Voynich saga extensions, all of them. The only thing he can vaguely decipher is the meaning of some empty spots having less dust than the others. Other than that? No pig to poke here.
Castiel isn't a dude.
Yeah, about that. Even though he just attempted to try and give Cas a blow job, he absolutely forgot to calculate in the inevitable joys of the wedding night. Taking care of the issue while using a body he knows and understands is no biggie. Been there, done that. Not without shame and a fair amount of disgust, but he managed. Not once, but thrice (he ignores the fact that it turned out to be useless in the end). But this is probably gonna be different.
“Don't pigeon me. Don't baby me. Don't even Dean me,” he snarls, pissed.
“Human love is flawed and it’s bound to hurt. People make mistakes. I understand that just fine,” Castiel agrees, which is something. “But your loved ones, Dean?” He pauses. What a drama queen. Dean almost rolls his eyes. “Maybe they made mistakes as well. But it’s more important that they made
Dean can’t see if Castiel is in any way offended or even affected. But, since walking past him he has the nerve to put a hand on his arm and kiss his cheek in lieu of a more entitled greeting (seriously? He just fucking washed himself now he’s filthy again), he’s probably not.
“Go to hell.”
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks because clearly, this is the opposite of what he wanted.
Shining still and burning through as he closes them, like sun-brought damage.
Cas leaves. Sam doesn’t bring it up until he gets two worrying texts and a phone call from Claire. When he mentions it to Dean, he’s ruthlessly cold about it. Meanwhile, he’s gotten detached and a bit aggressive, his previous also worrying warmth simply gone.
“Foolish brat. You’re just a mutation with too many teeth inside and too wide wings. They won’t take you as far as you’d like. And you won’t get to eat the whole world. These fangs will turn back on you.”
“I knew you would feel good in this one,” he comments, pleased with himself like a cat that ate the last standing canary.
There’s awe, bright as day. And something more. Something that makes disgust well under his skin. Where are the good old days when Cas was scared of hookers? Now he clearly sounds like he wants to sink into one (that’d be him, by the way) real bad. The lily white asshole dress he’s wearing isn’t revealing and has a rather nonsensical number of layers in his opinion and yet, he’s desperate to cover himself, unable to take the wanton scrutiny of Castiel’s gaze with any dignity, even though lace hides him from neck to wrists. There’s no dignity in this, anyway. The woman in the mirror is trembling and she can’t seem to stop.
Castiel’s current face is sponsored by something that vaguely looks like
“You're changing the subject, Dean.”
“He doesn’t want to put you through any pain.”
“No wonder the hooker threw you out. Your dirty talk is plain scary. This ain’t how you get a girl’s panties wet.”
“I want to go to hell,” he concludes, meaning every word. Not because of the pussy, since it’s not the end of the world, but because of the end of the world that is currently happening. In general.
“Well, this is absolutely no way to treat a lady,” he greets, bored.
Dean understands, reconsiders and has his whore mouth shut. That apparently is not enough for Cas, who demands:
Castiel’s hands wander over Dean’s body, mapping, caressing, consuming. His mouth works his way through Dean’s, barely giving him time to breathe. His fingers graze his neck, his belly, as the kissing becomes even more powerful and unrelenting. From the relatively safe areas of skin, Cas’s palm goes straight in between his legs and Dean goes rigid, like a terrified animal. It sinks into him and begins to draw small circles. Dean’s breath hitches, but not exactly in excitement. The fingers stop, but do not withdraw.
Last time Dean consulted the Bible, neither was Castiel, so maybe he shouldn’t be all that strict on what’s what.
He ignores the need to piss and doesn't move a fucking particle of himself off the bed, knowing it would give his bladder stupid ideas. He's not sure what he's trying to accomplish with torturing himself like that but he knows what he's trying to avoid: making any use of the sudden generosity of his loving apocalypse sweetheart. Sudden generosities are the worst (you always gotta pay for them later). Especially when it's the eldritch horror husband to bestow them upon him.
“It’s the jerk, he did this, until then I was fine,” Dean announces as he pops out the door with no warning like a very pissed off mole.
“They weren’t yellow. And no one died.”
“Thanks,” he says lamely. He’s grateful for his boobs leaving the encounter barely touched.
“Why go for the second best? You never go for the second best.”
And then he puts it back, beholds his own pissed off face in the mirror, while he’s at it. And then he has another excellent idea.
And yeah, never had a thing for other people’s boundaries, that guy. Now he has that thing even less, fuck given so scarcely it’s would be the new smallest particle known to man if any scientist had the proper tools to measure and the balls to simply approach it.
“How long was I gone?”
“Why are you doing this?” Dean asks, genuinely confused.
“What?”
Victory, huh? There’s literally a Cohen song molested by every possible singer ever and it fucking explains this is not how shit works. And maybe Cas should listen to it sometime instead of just the sound of his own words of highly debatable wisdom. Somehow, it’s not the only flaw in this explanation. Dean takes a look around one more time, just to make sure.
“Go,” he says, voice shaking and he presses his palm further into Castiel’s chest. “Love the world, then. See me in it. I’ll be there, somewhere.”
“Yeah? Watch me.”
“Why?” he prompts somewhat bitchily.
“Hey”. Replicates the gesture, a smile with no teeth. He doesn’t say anything more than that – he’d have to lie whatever he’d say and Sam knows his lies like he knows his face, the nightly patterns of his breath when he sleeps, like he knows the bible. There’s no use and no dignity in lying to Sam now. Last time he tried, he saw his back shaking slightly and he knew he was a lost cause and for a second it was such a burden if he hadn’t leaned on Cas he thought he’d fall (or crumble or just wither away).
“I’m pretty sure Jeremy would stay.”
“Technically, augury is a form of clairvoyance. And no, none of this.”
“Maybe don’t ask him and just kill him,” Dean points out.
Especially if it’s true.
Remembering a certain barn, Castiel supplies, “I think it’s me you’re referring to.”
Dean tries the drawers, one by one, and then the cupboards. He doesn’t find a single thing he could use. It’s one thing to wonder
With boner most likely killed, Castiel shakes his head at him in disappointment. Unfortunately, in exchange his gaze hardens. “Oh, and Dean,” which is already great because the bitchful
Dean doesn’t avoid Sam exactly. There’s no point to it – most is known in the unsaid anyway, he thinks. But he’d lie if he said he’s keen on meeting him around the bunker. He’s not. It hurts the last damn unrotten things in him. A lot. Like now. All this space in the kitchen, all this empty fucking space separating them in the kitchen, and they still collide. Back in the day (many years ago), or in the leftovers of “the day”, in its empty broken shards (fewer years ago, ever since Sam walked out that door and chose Ruby) that got stitched together in ill ways, it would be brotherly brushing by. Now for Dean it’s a collision and it hurts like a motherfucker. He bets Sam probably isn’t that hungry. Or at least that he doesn’t need that particular orange from the shelf right behind Dean. The touch of Sam’s arm on his flannel burns and he stops himself from spitting self-loathing apologies of
Then Dean begins to move. The blade sings with fire. Castiel’s hips find the melody, the rhythm, the core at which they want to claw. And Dean, he howls, burying fingernails into Cas’s stomach, searching restlessly for the hidden treasure. His breath is hot, Castiel feels it echo over his face, as Dean foretells and promises, like the otherworldly drugged prophet he is, “You’re dead and I killed you.” He rolls his hips and takes him like a wave of an ocean as he repeats, “With this I’ve killed you.” To prove his point, he retreats and slams back down, yanking an ungodly groan out of Castiel’s throat. “Cause I should’ve kicked you out, begging for you to spit it the fuck out,” he explains, voice swollen with pain but burning with need. “But I sure as fuck won’t,” he snarls, fucking himself onto Castiel’s dick with shameless abandon. He’s never seen him looking so debauched, not even in his dreams and he so, so deeply regrets he hasn’t made him come undone like this before (so many wasted years, his mind supplies, disappointed).
“I don’t. More than one hundred fifty thousand people die on Earth each day without me having anything to do with it.”
“That’s not true,” Dean hisses. “Cas! Cas!”
“You said it yourself, you want to get through with this.” Cas sighs.
She nods.
“Calm down, Dean! Didn’t you hear that?” Bobby nearly whispers through gritted teeth. “Look at the sheer size of his ego. He’ll put you on a holy pedestal just to show you off around the playground,” he points out, which, true. “You need that kind of power. For step two,” he adds in blatant conspiration, even quieter.
Castiel turns to him, irritated.
Dean laughs at him bitterly.
“For hell’s sake, Dean. Did you not listen to your own vow? Which was wonderful, by the way. Penned by Castiel, I presume?”
“What’s stopping you?” he prods.
“You came all the way here for a fucking interview or what.”
“How’d you just do that? Do you have an English on and off switch? Were you an actress or something? That why you were so loaded?”
“You aren’t the one to make that call,” he decides to comment because no, it’s not possible to leave it all that alone. Cas could, at the fucking least, stop his stupid fuck ass from judging the dead. Some sense of boundaries is required, after all.
“Yeah? And how are you gonna do that?”
“That’s my name, yes. Congratulations! You got it right, first try! There any reasons you used it just now?”
“I did not hit you with a stick, Cas.”
“No, of course not.” Castiel reaches for Dean’s perfectly manicured palm and kisses it piously, biting slightly at his knuckles because apparently his need to eat Dean in every imaginable way is just that strong. “Of course not,” he repeats as if it was supposed to reassure him somehow. Yeah, shit. Dean yanks his hand away and thoroughly ignores the fact that Castiel looks genuinely hurt with the chew toy and aperitif that Dean’s hand is, having been so abruptly taken from him.
Castiel takes care of it. Kisses it a few times as he works, his hands and mouth having all, but needing more, still.
“Yeah, man. Soup.” Dean shrugs. “Is this kitchen shit working or is all of this just a stage prop exactly like your mercy?”
, but like, the cardboard chewable edition with pictures, for toddlers with brain capacity of dogs. Or a crib mobile playing a really fucking neat lullaby, shit like that.
“That’s so fucking wonderful a story, good for him, but I still don’t see your point.”
“You want me to crossdress for the ceremony?”
“What are you doing, Dean?” Castiel asks, worried - whether more about Dean or the horse, at this point he doesn’t know. He knows nothing here.
He can’t sleep. The darkness of his room rattles around his bones. Feeds him recent memories: of Amara’s mouth and the things she offered, and of Cas’s limbs – their movement all wrong, body language uncanny. Artificial, like Esperanto. Beneath his eyelids, there’s an imprint of sordid lips, of full and half revealed breasts. He nearly retches, he wants none of it, and yet his body is pulled towards it in a way he can’t control. He feels dirty all the time, Amara a piece of broken glass stuck inside his shoe. Every step hurts, especially when he tries to walk away from her. He knows he’ll dream of her once he falls asleep. Maybe this is why he doesn’t want to. But it’s definitely not why he can’t.
If only anything else was this easy. If only anything else was simply debatable.
“Yes, the betrothed is how you call him,” Death hums. “But the outcome and the intent are quite the same, aren’t they?”
Almost? What else is he supposed to do? Dean squints, slightly confused (that is: more confused that he already is, yet another default setting of his. He has far too many of them, now that he thinks of it).
“I had a cleaning lady come twice a week. A wardrobe. I’m a fish out of water, here.”
Technically, it was leaving him to marinate in alcohol and plenty, plenty of Sam themed nightmares, including: Sam in hell - tortured, Sam dying - stabbed, Sam lying on Bobby’s bed just like he does currently (all the time now), but dead. In this aspect, they’re pretty monothematic, but combined with the fact that Sam is getting worse and he doesn’t wake up anymore, it works. When Castiel comes the second time four nights later, Dean already knows he’s going to say yes and regret it. Not like he’s got any other options. He’ll figure this out when Sam’s back to normal. Without him, he somehow can’t even think straight. He’s still pissed his weakness is again used against him by someone who claims to love him. The pain from Cas breaking Sam’s wall is still livid and bright and it hurts even more because it was Cas, not this, who did this.
“I will, so you better be ready and willing.”
“Do you really still believe that?”
“Thank be to holy Mary he let you out of the office, but what he must have done to your head,” she mutters in disbelief, clicking her tongue in the
He rises into flames like bonfire, and so does Cas if his gasp followed by a needy groan is any indicator.  His hands won’t leave that soft spot of flesh now, he promises to himself. Dean’s fingers curl, they want to scratch into the insides of Cas’s belly where a wreath of intestines and a veil of grace keep his lovely blade so safe in this perfect place. It’s marvelous, he thinks, the hideous contamination of two things he love and he wants it to stay like that forever. Scraping at Cas’s skin lightly, he moans, voice swollen with rabid need.
“What the fuck is this?!” Dean’s mouth counters as he points at the carnage before his mind can even follow.
It has to be said, this sounds like a promise, not like a plea.
But Dean is now functionally existing enough to remember and plain accept that this is the wonderful set of fleeting impressions he’s smacked with when he gets clocked out so fast, sudden and deep that he doesn’t even remember the gong hitting him in the first place. And that it’s completely normal and nothing to worry about.
But tonight they have time.
He grips at the fabric of his dress, loathes its softness and stares, seeing red, at his lap, at his legs which for some unnamable reason raise an alarm that whispers
“This is exactly what I meant by overdramatic.”
decide it’s better if Dean has it?
When was the last time he even got to say so many words? No wonder his throat is tired.
Sam’s braver than him.
“I’ve already told you.”
Nadya doesn't answer that. Well, now he can make an educated guess on whose blood he found back there. Weirdly it's relieving (at least it's his) and disappointing at the same time (God doesn't bother to try to tend to what's his after all. Was he again stupid enough to expect better?).
In his head there is a hole, completely blank and void of any hints that could help him figure out what happened. He doesn't know where to start to get answers. Because starting with Castiel, who by the way is also here, being an ugly bitch and stares at him with wide concerned eyes that scream ‘is everything alright?’ definitely too loud and too clear, is not, just not, going to provide any answers he could use.
“I’m giving you something better to focus on.”
“I always prepared it for Sam. It used to calm me down, gave me a feeling I'm doing something useful and helpful, you know. My mother used to make it for me, too. It's a nice memory, a nice tradition. I want to keep it in the family. I want to make soup for everyone here.” He leaves out the but not for you. “Can I make the soup?”
“Yeah, that. I lied, bitch. Here’s your surprise for today.”
“Here’s how this is going to go. The only thing that bumps—” he even gesticulates to accentuate his point “— at any night, is me. Smile and insult all you want. I’m going to neuter you and send you all back in no time. I genuinely do not care whether you can be killed or not. I opened Purgatory once, I will do it again.”
Castiel briefly looks down at his hands and apparently doesn’t find anything wrong with them.
“That’s it?” Sam asks suggestively. “That’s not exactly a sandwich.”
He returns to the fugly kitchen, which now bears absolutely no sign of what happened in it not that long ago. It’s beautifully clean, like freshly unwrapped from a gift box. Shows how little Castiel really knows about humans. No kitchen is homely if it doesn’t look like there’s people that actually ever use it.
“I want you to get to the point. I want to know how you escaped me. I want you to, by all means, go ahead and be direct if you want to threaten me. Or is there nothing you can do that with, which is why you’re being loud but vague?” Castiel leers.
“No,” Castiel offers with cold, impersonal courtesy. “It’s just your predicament, worth a few years in your abode. Ready for another handful?”
And he hates Castiel.
But he can’t have Crowley know that, of course. Mostly because he doesn’t want him to find out he’s already had far too much sex with the thing that stands next to him and holds him definitely too tight for normalcy. Doesn’t want him to realise how easily he got tricked, how stupid and naive he was. Doesn’t need him to know anything, for that matter. They’re not friends. They won’t be friends.
Dean wants his camel-jawed hand back. His rightful bride, his ribs, his blood. It’s all his, it’s all him. And he doesn’t understand how he could ever let that go. He misses it. Misses dearly. He spends the time which does not flow needing and thinking how to get it back with the same intensity he used to sit and think of ways to get rid of the Mark not that long ago. How foolish it was to be hopeful. How repugnant it feels now. From the inside of his room, echoes a bitter, venomous laugh. How even dared he.
“Does it matter? Do I have a choice?”
“No, Dean, it’s not only that. Were things ever so easy?” Bobby asks tiredly and Dean’s gotta say, from where he sits now, he doesn’t see that as anywhere near the definition of easy. “There’s things happening all around the goddamn world you don't get to see or hear even on underground news. Hunters and leftover monsters only have some scraps they got no idea how to make sense of and we only know that because Crowley is Crowley, and—”
Oh, like the one that no longer exists? How long will he keep beating that dead fucking horse?
“Blood,” Castiel reminds him in sheer disbelief. “It’s blood that you’re drinking.”
“You’re all mine and whole mine. Almost.”
He’s just partially saying this to her. He’s mostly trying to remind himself what his purpose is in this situation. And all the situations to inevitably follow.
“Ah, right! Your secret stash of souls! Your other secret stash of souls! Your other - other secret stash of souls! And then what?”
Nadya must have passed the memo all around just as she promised, because whatever glimpses of human life forms he catches out on their way up to the quiet room on the attic, it all scatters out quick, soundless, and efficient. Luckily, Castiel pays none of that any attention, too busy joyfully orbiting around whatever magnificent plan he is currently in the midst of executing. One disaster to worry about less, so there’s that.
“I leave you alone for less than twenty minutes and this is what you decide to get yourself into,” he comments, tone lacking any emotion whatsoever.
Dean indulges him, of course. Castiel quickly gets the veil in place and steals a kiss on the top of his head. “There you go, beautiful.”
“I was writing it down when you interrupted me in my office, as you may recall having done.”
“I’ll just go and tell Bobby, first.”
Silence falls on them both in heavy stones of retorts auto-censored and cut before being said. Castiel dozes off not long afterwards, mind bitter, body confused and woeful.
“He didn’t know yet. I haven’t told him what the agreement entails.”
“Fuck you,” Dean spits although this doesn’t begin to cover what he’d like to say.
Sounds like he needs a drink.
“Are we clear?” Castiel insists, because duh, there is no ‘team’ in ‘God’.
“I believe you, Dean.”
Castiel catches him flying and doesn’t even budge under Dean’s weight, which just never stops being weird.
Castiel embraces him from behind, his hold firm but careful. He buries his chin in the crook of Dean’s neck and exhales happily. The sun falls, and falls, and falls. Dean stands still, hopeless and done. The sunset gives him nothing.
“I’ll have to agree with trashcan here, Cas. He’s got a point.”
“Because you will stop.”
“Why are you here, Cas? Don’t you have a rabid little stray to look after?”
“What,” Dean tries for something smart but gives up entirely, much more confused than he wants to show.
Too late to fix, too late to do anything at all, because it’s not like something has gotten broken here, nah — it never had a solid chance to be fine in the first place. Whatever weak ones Dean had to make it right, he wasted. Took baobabs for rosebuds just because he wanted them so bad. Now he keeps losing and losing.
~~~~~~*~~~~~~
“No,” Castiel reciprocates the insult. “Now go back to sleep.”
“Is that a suggestion or an order?”
Castiel even isn't, especially not anymore, from a comprehensible species, to start with. He's almost as old as dirt, skyscraper large, and he's a goddamn patchwork of all the shit that makes Dean’s skin crawl with disgust no matter how mundane beheading, burning or stabbing it has become by now. Castiel is a whole world of that, but condensed. Currently he’s also out of his mind and spectacularly pissed, because that’s the color you get when you mix entitlement with painful betrayal.
Okay, here it goes. A nice, warm bowl of half-lies to feed the dogs with.
“You are very, very stubborn. Do I look alive to you?” he asks, waving his slit wrist in front of Castiel. “But thanks to that trait you finally have what you wanted,” Dean smiles, getting paler every second.
, it says, sad and pointed.
Who is he fucking kidding. Castiel’s wedding ring and his invisible strings would have stopped Dean even if he tried to pull a Miss Jones intro.
“Jesus,” he mutters, panic starting to build up.
“Well then,” Dean concludes and proceeds to smear butter roughly over the slice of bread. Sam watches his brother’s hands half mesmerized, half wary and he knows, just knows it takes Dean too long. He’s a hair away from making a hole in the bread, but Dean is probably too far away from here, from him, to be aware of this. Or to care. After what appears to be forever and a half, Dean absentmindedly takes another slice and repeats his task. He puts the two pieces on a plate, content with the result. He shifts to leave.
“You’re not my dog, Dean. You’re my consort.”
“No,” Death smiles patronizingly. “An accident was you finding him. Both this time and the first time, Castiel. Don’t feel so entitled.”
“It bothers me. Well?”
“You rethink it,” he snarls, yanking his hand away in panic.
Dean stays put for more or less eight seconds before he decides to fuck it. Well, not really in any meaningful way because his situation can’t be changed with any amount of fucking anything. He can’t run. He just doesn’t want to stand here like a doof anymore. Stand and wait. Like a dog, like a pet. Dean decides to make it back to the church because at least he knows the way there. And it’s probably less chilly inside.
He raises the knife. “Goodbye, breeding bitch. See you in hell.”
And Castiel knows better than to let that waste.
“It’s not called choosing when your leverage is the only imperative, Cas.”
“Would you like to watch the sunset today? We’re near the sea. You would love the sight,” Castiel asks unexpectedly.
“That is rich, Dean,” Castiel snarls, all that patronizing softness washed away, true colors showing. “Weren't you the one to decide their lives for them? Weren't you the one to demand me to erase the very memory of you from the hospital and the whole cul de sac? Weren’t you, most of all, deciding their fates when you showed up sad and lonely and whimpering on that little doorstep and begged to be taken in? Didn't you know what always happens to those that come close to you? Didn't you, sweetie? Even Sam let you know, reminded you, but prey tell, you did what?” Castiel smiles, sinister and powerful, every note of his voice worse than ice. “So maybe, just maybe, since you at that point at least understood you don't know how to yield right, that you don't know how to stop barking and biting hands that are much, much bigger than yours, you shouldn't have crossed that woman's fucking doorstep, Dean!” Castiel thunders, throwing his fists at the table, making both Dean and every single plate jump.
This is not the thing that is affecting Dean’s mood and the husband of the year can shove that narrative where the sun don’t shine, no lube. Preferably right now.
But all in all, weren’t it for Dean and his dead eyes, weren’t it for Dean and his ruthless orders, he wouldn’t have drank. He wouldn’t have fucked more than half the camp to make them feel human and loved again, while day by day, Dean carved them into tools.
“Not my only stray,” he deadpans. Particularly not funny, Dean thinks. “I’m here to help you.”
“Any.” Cryptic, sharp. But clearly not over. “Any impression you’re working under is taking you towards your sad little end and there is nothing you can do because it’s step one that got you dead. The souls? As much renewable as oil. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.”
“What.” Castiel sighs. “What now do you want to waste my time with.”
But a kiss on a temple doesn’t bring Dean back to him.
Dean breaks the kiss and stares at him startled like a wolf that just heard the moon howl back to it. His eyes are far from sad and what an unimaginable sight it is. They illuminate the whole dimmed room. The “vacancy” sign seems pale in comparison. Castiel shamelessly stares. And waits, unafraid because he’s always been brave. Because he always believes he’s doing the right thing.
Dean turns around to leave, all stiff and absent again, his entire being already functioning on a different plane. And Castiel thinks, good. Finally. He’ll get to stay alone in the cabin, just him and nothing else. He waits for Dean to say something, anything. Whatever it will be, it’s gonna sound shallow and meaningless. Because it is. Everything is abstract and fucked up. Unfair, mostly, because Chitaqua doesn’t know it’s going to be nothing more than cats pinned to Persian bucklers. Demons are no Egyptians – they’re going to shoot. Chitaqua seeks life, but it’s going to die. Thanks to both of them.
“Oh,” Satan says intrigued. “You touched his feelings. And all two of mine.”
Dean doesn’t know how that’s possible, but to him they sound pissed. He’s getting really good at this. Like reading his own father’s minute movements and smallest sounds of the things his merciless hands touched before they would start to speak in the ancient tongues of violence. Maybe better. Maybe this time around he learns faster.
“No,” Castiel says, eyes sharp, tone clipped.
Things can bloom wherever they want. And no god has a say in that.
Castiel rolls his eyes dramatically. Where did he even get that from?
“I’m fairly fucking sure she got to see her mother every once in awhile at the very least,” Dean hisses, throwing Castiel’s input to the trash where it fucking belongs.
For a moment, Dean’s gaze softens. “‘Cause it’s the only way to save you. You made all this choices because I had you make the first step. I’m responsible.”
He isn't really sure how he managed to do this, but he somehow stares at the goddamn can in equal parts with infuriation and resignation. Even though he has a lot of time to try to decide whether Castiel is being half deaf, that culturally illiterate, or just a full time dick, he doesn't think he wants to.
The dissonance managed to cloud his judgment at first and it was a terrible mistake. He should have stabbed him back then, at Bobby’s, when Castiel was still perfectly stabbable. There were enough of red flags raising alarm in his guts to justify that. But no. He selfishly hoped he would talk Cas out of this. Would he do that now if he could? Would he kill him? Does he hate him enough yet? The fact that he’s still asking himself instead of daydreaming about it with his hand in his pants, rather suggests that the answer is no. It also suggests that he’s fucked in the head. And that he deserves whatever is about to happen to him.
Tonight they don’t have time. Or they don’t want to. Dean’s body is a book Castiel is bored with. There’s been enough touch, enough kisses. Too many. He seeks something else than that. Soon, he’ll find death, a death better than this one on two legs before him.
“Once you’re old enough to carry a purse? Why not. It’s like this big siren that screams I have a purse, purses are for women, so now I’m a woman and you can fuck me.”
“Oh my God, I’m so sor-" Dean tries to blurt out, but Castiel pulls him in and kisses him.
“Go ahead and make me,” she hisses. “Break a bone or two. Knock yourself out. Break a bitch, knock up a bitch, whatever’s better.”
“Sometimes things just die,” he offers, shimmying out of his shirt. It, alongside the jacket, lands in the spacious trunk fit for a pro-eco family of five. The suspenders soon follow, leaving Dean in a black t-shirt that reveals a sinful amount of skin and Castiel fails to look away. Secondly though, it reveals a print of a panther and he reminds himself of that mysterious shape in the woods. This explains a whole lot.
“You glitched and got cut off. I’m not your fucking IT guy, asshole,” Dean groans.
“Maybe I should, cause I don’t think you understand what you’ve done,” he says, sadness and resignation finally taking place of the former bravado.
“We have a solid shot at a successful co-operation and a helping hand, but we can’t tell you much on details, even without the idjit Godstiel within hearing range.”
“No,” comes a confused syllable. They’re inside of him. Of course Dean heard. “I’m Dean Smith,” he deadpans. Looking from in between his fingers, Castiel sees a salesman’s smile. All thirty two teeth and two tons of charm. “And you?” Dean asks with the same wise curiosity he presented at first. Like it matters. Like it’s a test of some sort.
Dean releases himself from Castiel’s grip violently. Faces him, paying to attention to the fact he’s giving him a perfect opportunity to ogle his breasts. He doesn’t fucking care anymore.
“You must be so happy I never paid much attention in geography classes, huh? Paranoid fuck.”
“Choice my ass. We’ve talked about this, Cas.”
With that, he places a kiss on Dean’s cheek, awful but brief, almost weightless, and Dean closes his eyes. Maybe out of habit, maybe it’s just something his body does, maybe out of sadness. Only the sound of wings lets Dean know Castiel’s gone, probably back on his bloodshed tournee.
“I haven't seen you in a long time, Dean.” she whispers. “I thought you were dead this time,” she adds even quieter. “You look like you dug yourself out of your grave,” she points at the carnage on his head and his tired, sunken face not so subtly.
“Awesome,” Dean says with a sigh.
“Is that about the unmistakable love mark on your face, Dean?”
“Why is the junkless squad here?” he points at the angels staring at him. He flips his middle finger at them and watches them try not to come up here in this very instant and shred him into chunks of Wal-Mart low quality cat food. He’s not the only one grounded, apparently.
“I’ve been to hell and I’ve had my ass on a rack for a long, long time. I assure you, sweetie, there is nothing you can do to me to have me surprised.”
Castiel, very strongly, does not smile.
“What do you think I’m ovulating for: is it shits or is it giggles?” he asks curiously. “I personally can’t fucking tell.”
“Thanks for the explanatory subtitles, Castiel. However I would manage to tag my feelings without them, using only that pigeon brain of mine,” Dean deadpans.
They can waste some time. Enough has been wasted on nothing, so why bother now? They’re both guilty, in the end. He’s too sober for this, he thinks. Too sober for Dean. This is what lack of hope does to people, it dehumanizes them and makes them into nasty things. Part pissed, part bored, he touches him like he touches the Bible: with violent disrespect and disgust. It’s all a high tide of push and pull, of hands drowning, of rotten air escaping in between empty kisses. He doesn’t care. Not because he’s at his lowest, but because it’s Dean. His death makes him feel colder than how Dean’s gone cold. He stops kissing to look what’s left of him and he takes it all with pain: the seaweed of his eyes, the lifeless stone of his face. He’s Hades. He’s Sheol. He’s broken bones. He’s nothing.
“You shoulda seen daddy’s face,” he whispers. “Looked like a fucking clown that got shit in his margarita.”
“It’s naive to believe I would,” Castiel splutters.
“And why is that?!” Dean snaps.
“I love you.”
Nadya on her end plugs in the electric clipper, fishes out a small mirror out of her bed stand drawer and places it on the table. Then does one big, solid, noticeable nothing aside of just looking at her make do work space.
“No,” Castiel counters, word falling on the floor between them too softly for his liking. The thing grimaces at it as if it was made of rotting fish.
“You, I think,” Death lets out a humorless chuckle. “Have you finally told him you want him as his bride? Is that why the infamous Dean befriended the knife?”
“Like you’ve shown him when you kicked him out or when you punched him half to death?” Satan asks innocently. “Or when I was taking care of him in the cage and you were licking Sammy’s wounds?”
Technically, he could turn the TV on and see where the omnipotent and merciful currently is, but hey, he doesn’t care and that aside, he’d prefer to avoid the sorriest sight of publicists and reverends discussing the fascinating and hope-lighting miracle of the betrothed (that’s him) saying yes and giving himself (also him) unto the endless care and “agape” or “storge” or “philia”, since that varies depending on the day and the church and what not (that’s not true, either way) of the Lord (fuck you, Cas). This would inevitably lead to talking about the Garden again, about how wonderful it’s going to be and how thoughtful a gift to the world it is. And then some grand communion marriage talk. He wouldn’t even be pissed anymore, or disgusted. He’s too drained. Everything has been already discussed in the media, the question of what he’d be wearing on that special day included. He could, just for kicks, call them and say all of their guesses are wrong (they are, especially Dean’s favorite ones coming from the folks who still speculate that he might be a chick, since he’s currently ensuring they will stay in the wrong). But he doesn’t care. The indifference is a bliss, some kind of unfathomable freedom he’s allowing himself for the first time. There’s gonna be no marriage. True, Cas never even mentioned it to him, not openly, but apparently he did everywhere else, and it fits the modus operandi of calling him “a friend” here and “the bride” amongst the believers, fucking doesn’t it. All the talking on the TV channels he shouldn’t have but does, has made Cas’s intentions clear. He’s just stalling, that’s what he’s doing. Sooner or later there would come a white veil to his white, ivy-embroidered and scratchy clothes. Who knows, maybe he already swallowed some kind of a tiny-fonted contract with his ass or with his mouth.
“They failed to accept my reign.”
That makes him stop thinking about Jesus. He doesn’t want to know what that conversation must have looked like.
Knew it.
“Have you considered the thought some people might want to kidnap others and force them into being together against their will? In your image, I mean? If God can do that, excuse it and encourage it, anyone can do it. Do you want this to be your gospel? Your heritage?”
“Thank you.”
“Funny how you didn’t.”
The words come out strangled and pained, but Dean doesn’t care. And he doesn’t say shit to that, keeping his perfectly painted mouth a thin, impenetrable line that also happens to taste like artificial strawberries because fuck the lip gloss, that’s why.
The people in Hell, they don’t compare. He slices and dices them anyway. Can’t leave his hands idle when they need, when they mourn. He breaks bones with artistry, plays them like instruments. He always liked good music. He waits for something. Not all of his racks are taken. The empty spaces are so bright. They keep getting his attention akin to a magpie mesmerized by shiny trash. His bride will fill the voids when he gets her.
That would be because he does not exactly feel inclined to make the three tiny steps to the left through the last liminal space that separates him from the ritualistic sacrifice of the remaining not even standing but lying and whimpering reheated leftovers of his personhood and independence.
Wilderness, apparently. The reason for it taking this particular shape eludes him. But it’s bound to unravel later on. For now, he focuses. For now, he stands up finally, dust and dirt on his palms and knees tainting the white suit staying a reminder of the idiotic moment of weakness. The air is fresh and crisp. Nearby, he smells the sea. Above, the thick canopy of tree tops gleams with brightness of the sky, small spots of light piercing through the unrelenting green. Ahead of him, a slim path. So either Dean is merciful on purpose or simply by design. Feeling instinctively that the path is not a trap, he decides to follow it, tuning into the ache of his grace that cries for the one who’s gone missing. It knows Dean is somewhere out there. It knows there is more to him that the dull scream of something torn and frayed beyond recognition. It’s the light far away at the end of the trail that lures him. Like a predator is called by the scent of fresh blood. Whatever is out there, he craves it, hungry. Dean, he thinks, he murmurs, he growls. Like it says everything. It does.
“No. You had me kill a dude because he talked shit about me while you only muted fucking Crowley for doing the same damn thing. What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck that. What isn’t wrong with you?”
“I’ve already sent Oksana after the chickens, I hope you don't mind,“ he informs, without looking up, aiming for placating and soft as he gives the notebook back to Castiel. “She was under my strict orders and I didn't leave her much of a choice, so if you want to punish anyone, that would be me. I set the thing myself. I didn't want her to see us fighting at the table and you getting handsy and punching me into understanding your mysterious ways. Or, you know, also getting handsy and screwing me on the table. I just wasn't sure which would follow, but I wanted to spare her eyes, is all.”
“Yes. You’ve failed to meet the old condition. Perhaps you’ll meet the new one.” And Dean thinks, does he want to even know? He lets him talk. “You didn’t stand down, as you recall,” Castiel continues. “All I ask of you is to stand up and come with me.”
“Dean!” he hears. And the same plea slash demand all over again. More pounding. He didn’t hear a “honey, I’m home,” but it’s the son of a bitch alright. Dean guesses his spidey senses were tingling.
“Dean.” The word comes again, this time careful, soft and worried. It’s louder to him now and that’s because Castiel is approaching.
Dean isn’t sure whether to start with chicken or with soup. Maybe he’ll just start with the point.
He dreams of Hell. But if it’s future or past, he can’t discern. Reeks like home. So it’s okay.
“Because, the not-mine, most aesthetically unpleasing amoeba I’ve ever met and never laid an eye on, Dean, anything of value we could try to tell you, the demon-stealing whore could easily extract from you without you even knowing!” Crowley yells, and then, a micro-sized in its lifespan, albeit very pointed silence falls.
Castiel grimaces at him, he loses interest in his bloody steak plate and his gaze hardens, zeroed in on Dean. But it just adds to Dean’s fire instead of putting it out. He sees red now. Next time he opens his mouth, he just can’t shut up.
Ah, okay. And for the record, he wasn’t crying. His heart was just losing focus by trying to revive and relive something very dead.
“And until then? Between your genocides and temper tantrums, do we share custody? Say, we take the blessed box for little Andy or Jenny for a spin every other weekend, maybe move some furniture and bones around? You plug him out then duct tape him back while we chat over dinner? You think it doesn’t cost you things, puppy boy? Your biological clock is ticking and you’re kinda running out of spoons.”
To say the very least, Bobby wasn’t exactly thrilled, but Dean had his mind already made up. Castiel plants him and Sam in a house somewhere in Illinois. It looks boring, bland and too spacious. It lacks a white picket fence. Dean doesn’t need to see all the wards to feel them. Pretty powerful shit. He feels naked without his weapons and, to him, the wards don’t make much of a difference. He wants his stuff.
Dean carefully puts everything else back as he first found it and closes the cabinet. He evacuates his sorry thief gnome ass from the floor he’s not worth of being on and hides away in the master bedroom. Unease is twisting his guts because he knows he ain’t done yet and now is the time for the shittiest part of his idea. And it has a solid 97 percent chance of backfiring directly into his face, so there’s that.
“You understand, this is just, well, an example.”
„Can you really beat her?” is the most important question.
“I smote them,” Castiel explains plainly. The ‘they were out of broccoli so I got carrots’ kind of plainly, which is a very creepy way to talk about slaughtering your own kin, if you ask Dean.
Or maybe he just hates it when Dean brings up sex outside of fucking and weaponizes it. There could be anything in Castiel’s head right now, but Dean can’t say that he cares what it is.
Well. If the darling is as wrathful as it is sentimental (and obviously is, considering the current misadventures of Springfield), that’s how it’s gonna roll.
“Of fucks,” Dean answers, just as done. “I think I've lost it somewhere.” Jesus, was the idiot even listening? “Of coke, man. I just asked about it.”
He tastes, staring back at whatever the fuck his intuition thinks the true face of God is, a whole new flavor of dread all over his mouth, and a different sort of weary disappointment is coiling in his bones this time around, more vast and heavier, hell-bent on finally pinning him to the ground.
Castiel frowns, the implication more than clear to him. “Let the horse go, Dean.”
just like temporarily excited human rugrats do. Except of feeling like he’s the worst person on Earth aside of his husband, he doesn’t much know what to do about it. It acts like a duck, it talks like a duck but it’s no duck. It’s at least a velociraptor. He can’t kill a fucking baby. But it’s a monster and he knows the rules. Maybe there’s a spell? There has to be a spell. If you can unmake a vampire, you can unmake… well, whatever the fuck this is, right? Before it feeds on non-chickens.
“I don't know,” Dean replies and grimaces in an expression that represents the same sentiment as its spoken counterpart. “In which part is John Travolta the angry God that behaves like a near human embodiment of the phrase
“Have you nuked the rest of your family?”
“Which part?” Bobby says, either to humor him, or maybe just because he doesn't yet realize that it’s nonsense to in any way engage with a statement like that.
“Stop with the milk,” Castiel says, irritated.
“Only the sad people let me in, kitten. Only those who want to stop suffering. Those who want to be useful just once. Does that sound like our dear Castiel to you? Or does it sound like your brother in the past – in the one you never called him back?”
When Cas can no longer see him, Deans sags and uses the wall for support to make it to the bathroom, counting every step.
“That’s... festive,” Crowley finds his tongue to comment after a small, but an impossibly awkward silence on everyone’s end.
. “I always gave away everything to save your life, Dean. Even if you hated it, even if you failed to see good behind my reasoning. All for you. And you give me this,” he huffs. Leaves bitter
“Which country, Pizarro,” Dean says flat and dry; the orange juice didn't do anything — death is still in his throat, present and burning.
Dean sighs. Tries to regain composure and keep his voice down. “Why did he take your goddamn name away?”
“I’m guessing Cas is on his shark week,” he says.
So quiet here. Castiel did not need to spit many words at Dean to have that ugly patronizing voice keep ringing annoyingly in his brain, kind of like it did in that gas station all those years before. It’s just so nice to not be in imminent threat of listening to it again, at least for a little while, for however long he’s safely allowed to take to get himself pristine and holy for his husband God, so he could be with so much joy beheld and be fucked. He doubts there are any other reasons for that. Soon he’ll find out but not just yet. Now he’s tuning into the silence, savoring it.
“I’m not a teenager, Cas. I didn’t come here to make out. I came here to watch the big, fiery orb mysteriously plop into the water without a sound. And you are tainting my wonderful experience.”
“I don’t know,” Dean whines. “Can I?”
To his genuine surprise (this time), aside of Castiel letting his feral face unnaturally retract into simple but bone-crushing deep disappointment, nothing happens. At least nothing that strikes Dean down like thunder and kills him on impact, which, by the way, is also disappointing.
Before he can even begin to enumerate, Dean is already half elsewhere in his head, wondering if this is going to take long, if he will need snacks, and how the fuck can he obtain a can of coca-cola in here. Brand specific, because monster rugrat apparently has some serious beef with pepsi and won’t settle for less than perfection. And honestly? When bad food preferences are involved, Dean can respect that.
“Hold your horses, Patty Hearst. True, I gave him the means to open Purgatory, but I did not plant this particular idea into his head. Or the ones that preceded it. My hands are clean.”
“I’m peachy,” he groans dismissively, finally opens his eyes and properly takes the bedroom in. In their absence, certain significant changes were made to the place he already so deeply resents. They’re almost funny in their pettiness. The sudden lack of doors he kinda gets, but the windows? Because jumping out of the second floor would make so much sense right now. This is such a fucking mess, all of it. Almost like an Ed Wood movie. Except that he thinks of those rather fondly which can’t be said about the bedroom. “Anything else you removed from this room, aside of my will to live?”
He thinks he failed the are-you-human test.
“Your spring, Kore. Enjoy yourself,” Castiel explains, offering a smile Dean doesn’t trust even half as far as he could throw it. He gestures at the treats, just in case Dean didn’t notice them. “Enjoy yourself some more.”
Third door on the left cracks open, revealing first a strand of hair and half of Nadya's head, then, upon locating and recognizing her target, the rest. Her expression slides from terrified, through relieved, and stops at station angry and it looks like it feels very comfortable there.
“Son of a bitch!”
“Will that excuse me for seventy years of coming back to my well being on a shezlong two centuries and a continent away?”
“Will you ever forgive me?”
Castiel lifts Dean’s trembling hand. “Open your palm, Dean,” he instructs and Dean complies. “Good. Now close it.”
Okay, that’s so not what he’s worried about. Technically, he is, in general, but not now.
He sure as fuck wants to run.
“Shit,” Dean whispers because this happens to be both exactly what he feels like and the perfect summary for the situation.
“Fine.”
Oksana stares at him in sympathy, with pity. He doesn’t deserve any form of compassion, especially not from her - the person so severely wronged by his stubborn inability to put out. It’s all his fault: her being here, her doing his nails, her family and friends having been obliterated. Or unmade. He doesn’t even know. God, he doesn’t even fucking know how they all died. He forces himself to stop thinking about it. At least for now. He’ll have all the time in the world to do that later.
“Listen to me carefully, dove,” he says, solemn. Dean shifts uncomfortably. He doesn’t want to hear what’s coming next. “They did not love you. Not truly. Or at least, not enough,” Castiel tells him with disappointment evident in his voice.
And he remembers her ways. Repeated to Sam, John’s binge after binge, hunt after hunt, until his baby brother would grow big and wary and buy it no more.
He disappears with the ugly flutter of those wings of his before Dean can even try to think of a remark.
“Good. Thanks,” Dean says, and really means it. He feels washed over by a normal, human, familial warmth he was scared he forever lost. Holy fuck. It’s like he’s high on this shit now. High as a fucking horse. Fuck, that’s nice. But hey, business. “Trash can still there?”
He never likes that.
Nadya snorts bitterly. “Oh, no. He can. He can have everything. We can’t, though.”
So far, his existence in the wedding dress was limited to either sitting in it or standing like an abused lamp that spent thirty years in a rat-infested storage. Luckily, moving and actually walking in it doesn’t seem to be a problem at all, though it’s still a little disturbing. It could have been worse. He could have gotten his sorry ass put into some ancient, horse-sized atrocity with an actual metal frame destined to hold it together. He’s also glad for having flat and comfortable shoes instead of heels. He notices Castiel watching him intently.
Castiel goes on, deaf to Dean’s misery, blind to his suffering.
“When you told us you were going to say yes to him, I was livid. I couldn’t let that happen.”
Crowley’s eyes dart at Castiel whose firm, cold glare emanates something ruthless, vaguely threatening and unforgiving. At both of them.
, it decides.
can be heard from space even if his thoughts aren’t being actively invigilated right now. Castiel, on his part, neither leans in nor retracts. After Alastair, Dean well knows that this nonaction is an action. A statement which Dean can read just fine. “But I have found something wonderful in your heart as well. Hope-giving,” Cas adds, voice shaking minutely. Whatever he saw there has to be of value since it has him so elated he has to keep it clipped. Not good. At least not for Dean.
One final glare and whoosh, fucker’s gone.
“He did what?!” he shouts. He doesn’t even care how he sounds right now.
Dean’s pretty sure he did, though.
“He’s gone. You don’t have to listen to him.”
“Of course, of course, but direct your focus right there. You don’t want to miss your chance.”
It tells him, excited.
Castiel goes to the piano room and drinks Dean’s whiskey, holds the myrtle wreath necklace thinking how a few days ago, Dean was his. He was clay in his hands, warm sand into which he sank; he was bendable and willing; he was the heat of the sun, he was air; he was sweetness of milk and of honey; he was all fire and his body was cathedral arches; he was prayers, he was thanks and he shone; an instrument and a sacrament carefully put into palpable, malleable flesh that Castiel swallowed and swallowed and drowned. Dean was beautiful, ethereal. His. All his: every move was his, every breath was his, every shudder. No Cicero, no heavenly war, no pride held them apart. Now Dean’s on his bed, not exactly in the right context. So desperate to not be his anymore. To say that it hurts doesn’t even begin to describe it.
“He needs to know what you’re sorry for, Dean,” Cas suggests politely.
She shudders.
“I did what I had to do,” Cas answers solemnly.
“In moments like these I have to remind myself that I can’t blame you for seeing it this way. It’s not your fault that you’ve been conditioned to fight against emotional warmth and resent it with all you have. It’s not your fault you deny yourself any rights to it. It’s not your fault you can’t even tell what love is as you have never been loved. When I show my love to you, you have no idea what’s going on and that scares you, doesn’t it? It’s not your fault, Dean.”
“Like you said?”
“I wouldn't do that to you!”
“Fine,” Castiel answers, ruthlessly cold and counter pissed. “Be that wise and kind, my consort of great value, and tell me. Now.”
But what the fuck about is Castiel's design of wrapping Dean up into these goddamn fucking church sunday dresses one after another when there's, more often than not, just the two of them to fuck, fight, and stare impassively at each other? When every single person in this house is perfectly and morbidly aware that Dean's not the woman Castiel paints him to be (or any other woman)? When right now he's probably the most hidden from the public eye loser to ever crawl the Earth and fail to die?
“I’m sorry, Cas. I was afraid,” Dean whispers. Lucifer cups his cheek. His palm is cold.
“And then what? When you eat the whole heaven, entire hell, every single thing on planet Mudball-3? Then what?” they prod.
“No need to be stressed, Nad. We’re gonna do this together, okay? I’ll walk you through it, you learn a thing or two, and Castiel’s weird no sharp objects for Dean fetishes will remain unharmed.”
“And huge, toothful mouth covering the whole face, black ooze, running the economy, eating people with a side of melted cheese dressing,” Dean goes on, marveling at the endless possibilities. “It comes from the fact that I don’t fucking know what you’re made of anymore. So yeah, I might not like what pops out and that bothers the living shit out of me. What’s in it for you, anyway?”
“You wouldn’t get it if you simply cooperated instead of being purposely unbearable. Clearly, you wanted a reaction from me. You got one. Are you satisfied with the result of your experiment?”
One: apparently you can forget how to put pants on while standing without tripping if you’ve lived pantless long enough.
“Come with me,” Dean begs quietly. “Let’s just die.”
He saunters down, mindful not to gain too much attention. Isn’t all that hard since a) he’s the bitch whose very existence ended up putting into this house everyone that’s currently living in it and b) from an outsider’s point of view he’s the thing that seems to be periodically: screaming, then dropping dead, then respawning at some point later.
Dean leans in and kisses him, chaste and innocent. That’s definitely not how Cas kisses him back. The feel of stubble against his skin and the wendigo mouth ripping his lips asunder almost drowns down the roar of the crowd cheering. Castiel licks and nips, relentless and hungry, until Dean willingly lets him in. Unable to switch his body to autopilot, he becomes overwhelmed by the sensations. He tries to kiss back and make it a believable show, but, compared to Cas’s efforts, that comes out rather pale. He’s never been this hungry, this thirsty. Not even in hell. He can’t replicate the sheer force of it. But he’s been desperate, he’s been needy and he’s been left alone, so he goes with that horsepower.
Dean can hear the coffee-maker wake up and hiss, just like he would love to do as well.
Death glances at Dean again. “Doesn’t look like it at all,” he comments. “Unless this,” he points at the man, “is what you call him, too.”
“Take a chill pill, Aslan.” Dean sighs and he definitely does not rejoice.
Castiel pets his hair in silence. Dean lets it happen.
No, Sam doesn’t. And that would be the problem.
Castiel turns to look at the door, as if genuinely and deeply curious about why this stupid innocent thing troubles Dean so much. Then he looks back at Dean, probably wondering what’s wrong with him this time.
Dean shrugs.
“You’re not Ophelia, Dean,” he murmurs softly. That’s as much a threat as it is reassurance. Such recklessness will not go without reprimand.
But first, he needs to save Cas from perdition.
“Cas, let me try,” Dean begs, eyes watery.
“There’s not much of them,” he manages to say through gritted teeth.
“Have the souls wiped your goddamn memory stick? Don’t you remember I’m done with being special for whatever holy party currently at large? You forgot I’ve never been a fan of that position?” Shit, that came out wrong. Then again, nothing can be right in this asshat conversation that shouldn’t even be taking place. “You did your shit so leave us alone and let us rot,” Dean snarls.
“Not the oldest,” Cas answers, still not giving him its name, probably on purpose. “The oldest ones are in Syria.”
“You can watch that later,” Dean smiles slyly, tugging Castiel towards the motel bed. It seems so far. Too far. Every moment is a million years.
“What, now? Shouldn’t I get a microphone or something?”
“Congratulations, Gepetto. Are you fucking serious?”
, Dean thinks. No.
Castiel doesn’t waste time. Enough has been wasted already. He too is drunk on emotion, drunk on Dean. This is what hope does to people. Beautiful things. He touches him like he used to touch the Bible: with awe and gentle reverence. His hands keep swimming until they find the shore of Dean’s skin. He needs more of that, now. He takes. He kisses him again, mouth scorching with need. He desperately wants. Not because he’s human. But because it’s Dean. The sight of his joy makes him warmer than his grace. He stops kissing only to just look at him again, and he takes it all in, the fresh grass of his eyes the sand of his freckles. He’s Eden. He’s Arcadia. He’s the wings that he’s lost. He’s everything.
“What’s the fucking point?” Dean argues, hopelessly throwing his hands in the air.
“I’m not holding you as my hostage,” Castiel says evenly, but his face clearly shows that he’s far from pleased with Dean’s implication. “You made a choice, Dean.”
“This is the last I see of you,” he says, triumphant.
Something dead walks by Castiel’s side ever since. Something that doesn’t know how to rot, but desperately wants to.
After that, he leaves the bedroom, taking the door with.
As far as Dean's honest answers are concerned, this is a very loaded question he doesn't know how to answer without fifteen to fifty years of scientific research beforehand.
Castiel offers him a patronising smile as a consolation prize to that refund. “I don’t really need you to. Anything else itching you that I have to scratch?”
Dean can hear Bobby let out whole lot of heavy air from his chest and he thinks a few months-held stones of worry followed too, metaphorically or something.
He turns around rapidly, or so he thinks – at least he didn’t noticed making a decision to move. But he has his palm of Sam’s arm now, thumb brushing softly and they stand face to face, both irrationally scared of Dean, yes, Dean included, while Dean reminisces the good old days before he was dead to this world, days where he could still be side by side with his brother. Again, he thinks
“No.”
Dean raises his butt (although reluctantly) and slides off his underwear.
“That’s a lot, Dean.”
Dean’s not buying.
“Then at least try to relax and let me ministrate. This won’t be nice if you don’t let me prepare you,” Castiel complains.
“Sure thing, honey. In a jiffy. Just tell me whose blood is that, bitch!” Dean shouts so hard aliens probably heard.
manner, when not much later he comes back, new coffee in tow. “Do you want milk with that?”
“This is so sad,” Castiel says, forcing Dean backwards. “I really wanted you to enjoy some autonomy but no, you always have to howl and ruin everything for yourself. And then run crying towards the first soft shoulder you see,” he whines. “Tell me, Dean, what will you do when there’s no other shoulder left but mine?”
Huh. As far as Dean’s aware, his last name was not revealed to the world. No one is supposed to know what happened to him. No one except for Bobby who can probably guess what’s going on right now.
Castiel has heard enough. He grabs the leviathans by the collar of Dean’s dress and lifts them effortlessly, only to fly away with them without a word of warning. He throws them on the floor, this time stone and cold. They have mauled Dean’s face enough, anyway. Any pretenses about being delicate are futile. There’s a lot of healing and memory rearranging he will need to do soon one way or the other.
The nothingness is vast and it calls. It offers peace. There are times when he wants to take it. When he says something too loud (as in, when he shouts) and in Cas’s eyes fear blooms and lingers long enough for Dean to see it. Because this - he doesn’t know how to live with. And fuck, he doesn’t know how not to shout sometimes, it’s just a thing that his mouth does - it betrays him. He’s just a stray dog: stray dogs bark when they need.
He begins to feel the floor tiles in his bones, even though this body is brand new and unfamiliar to him, it’s not twenty six anymore. He’s still stuck in a model that’s thirty three and has been thrown against walls and shit way too many times. The fact that Cas, regardless of whichever part of this house he’s currently haunting, is unrelentingly keeping Dean’s “disposition” at “two”, is not helping at all.
Crowley squints. “Honestly, Castiel. What do you need spawn for?”
“Of course.You can always ask, Dean.”
“Can I ask some stupid questions?”
“And three days ago you were mine.”
Someone else in this house does the job for him now. Dean isn’t even allowed to do basic caretaking. His hands itch for it all the time like they know nothing but that. They don’t, at least not much. They only know how to kill and how to keep dead things living.
? Like, in a normal person-made sentence aimed at a human?”
Only just as she opens it, Dean realizes that, obscured by the damn thing, there’s another door, probably leading to whatever was left of the real kitchen and pantry. Taking one more smarter look around the pulled outta Lucille Ball’s ass nightmare, he also notices that the doors leading to the dining room are closed.
God damn it. Okay, he’ll definitely need a new saying. Marking that up for later.
And it also has to be said, that’s probably a lie. Thing is, Dean is honestly not sure yet, which is a huge problem, strategy-wise. He can’t trust his own feelings because he doesn’t know what they are. Falling in love was slow. Crawling out of it is even slower. It’s a process he’s more aware of happening. Loving was easy because it was subtle and quiet. One day, that looked exactly like all the fucking other days before, he stole a glance when Cas said something so trivial Dean doesn’t even remember it anymore and it just occurred to him: I love him. I’d give anything to make him happy. His consciousness did not participate in taking the road there. He simply arrived.
“I’ve been sent here to assist you,” Nadya says with amazing calm as if nothing moved her at all. “He said you’re feeling unwell and might need help.” Dean doesn’t respond with anything so it gives her time to think. “If you got nausea or cramps I can make you some herbs and give you a few tips later on,” she adds softer, but not much softer in general. “I’ve been there.”
“He said that to you?”
“Try more like two million,” Castiel bites back menacingly. “This bravado of yours? It's going to wear off rather sooner than later. You will come to your senses eventually and, believe me, the less you fight right now, the less you will later hate yourself for being so stupidly stubborn.”
“You get to wear pants?”
“Don’t do that,” Castiel whispers.
Healing people, yeah shit.
“These are fresh, I don’t really have to touch them.”
Wings.
“Fear is clouding your judgment—”
With no hesitation, he takes it and condemns himself.
Well, Cas, whatever you said, fuck you. You and your messed up Bible copyright infringement both.
“Why?”
“Me? Childish?” Dean complains in disbelief. “Full offense, but you're such a baby you still got only twenty baby teeth up your baby mouth.”
“But Claire’s been trying to contact him for days. Don’t you think it’s worth checking?”
Perhaps knowing what’s on Dean’s mind, Cas starts with, “I know you don’t trust me.” Dean nods. “I regret the action I have taken against your brother. I don’t want him to suffer.”
Castiel gives Dean a quick glance, probably to confirm or deny the accusation. His hand lands on the nape of his neck, as if to ground him even more.
Dean leaves the kitchen, not gracing Sam’s statement with a word. Walks like a mannequin.
They look back at him with a mixture of amusement and pity that would have been annoying weren’t it for the beautiful prize spreading itself before him in his thoughts, so calming and delightful, honey for the heart.
Not just touched, if Dean’s words are to be trusted. Even if they aren’t (as they often aren’t), his voice was, this time. His raw, desperate pain echoed through Castiel’s core and made the foundations of his glory tremble, a howling wind demanding to be heard. Ignoring that outburst, while tempting, would only make Dean more difficult and uncooperative in the long run; such a waste, considering how much progress there was already, in so little time. There is, as well, the more jarring issue of property trespassing - the very thought of something entering his Dean, his house, makes him boil with unforgivable insult.
“Let’s find out,” Cas smiles, the most charming thing his face ever contorted into, proof number nine billion of shit being so, so wrong and alieny in him these days.
“And?” he asks, equally dumbfounded and fear-monosyllable stuck like he was with Cas.
-Antoine de Saint Exupéry, The Little Prince
“Too much sugar,” he comments. “Nine times out of ten it’s inedible since you can’t even taste any flavors outside of the sweet. Pie was made for savoring. Cake’s been unearthed from hell to add more visual drama to a wedding, I guess.”
“For lunch,” Cas answers tiredly.
Death shows up by their bed with a bag of dried apple slices in hand and a truly loathing smile on his face. “Charming,” he throws dryly after taking the situation in, it being a restless, tired-faced Castiel occupying a chair next to a Snow White spread Dean Winchester. Not exactly surprising, but pathetic nonetheless. “Silly, little thing. You had the audacity to bring me here because you broke your chew toy?”
“We’re in one of the oldest cities in the world.”
“Come and do what, exactly.” One, he’s starting to feel mildly guilty here and that’s shit. Two, he already knows he’s coming. “Just fucking explain.”
“Your ass will be severely put to work and mended with chilli peppers afterwards if you don’t march out of here on your own and never mention this again. Now move.”
“Coercing, then.”
Her tone makes it clear that, god, she wants to.
The desk on the other hand, the one he doesn’t wanna come near to, is ripe with things to look at. Possibly.
That’s probably the worst thing that came out of Dean’s goddamn mouth tonight.
And look at that, it did. Ten points for Deanffindor or whatever.
This tells him nothing, so he opens.
“Is that my concoction?” Dean quirks his eyebrow in honest interest.
Instead of verbalizing that thought, he goes with:
Dean snorts. He already gave him everything.
“He’s a Winchester, Castiel. He’s not reformable. Especially this one. He doesn’t even have a self-preservation instinct and will continue to talk shit even devoid of a mouth.”
So for now Dean tries to claw at something, at anything, simply to keep himself contained, in one place, instead of breaking shit all over the place in fits of unspeakable rage.
“Idiot,” she huffs. “You have a Russian switch, kind of. More of a codec? Ask your husband.”
“Actually, Castiel, I can't call you that. This is a privilege that you've lost,” Dean answers with absolute conviction, but cut him in half, fuck his ass tenfold and rip him into pieces, he can't even logically explain why. He just knows, the way newborn children know they need to cry for their mothers, that he did lose it irreversibly somehow, no take backs allowed.
“Dean,” Castiel's soft voice reaches him from eons away, from underwater. “I can calm you down, if you need.”
“Your job?”
Antoine de Saint Exupéry)
It was the right thing.
Well, this is…… Dean is not, just not, unwrapping the meaning of this. Which he thinks he knows. Which is why he’s NOT addressing that at all, ever, let alone discussing it with Nadya. One thing is sure: it’s Jeremy hunting season.
The old, old light wilts out of Dean’s eyes. His body sags and collapses to the ground.
“Let’s go fix Sam,” he croaks, deeply disturbed.
Something or someone doesn’t want him to make it there. Mid-step, from in between the pews, he gets pulled by his dress and lands flat on the ground with a yelp. An unexpected weight follows and keeps him pinned. He fights and pushes until he manages to switch positions with the attacker, but it only lasts for a moment as a violent pull on his hair not only ruins his perfect updo, but also unexpectedly hurts like a motherfucker and distracts him enough to have him pinned again. At least he’s face up the second time around. Above him, there’s a swift, skilled and a quite fucking heavy man with sparks of wrath in his cold, grey eyes. He holds a knife to Dean’s throat. Somehow, Dean’s not at all surprised, although he fails to see the point of this plan, whatever it even is.
“Pockets,” she answers dryly, less than impressed with his attempt.
Of course he then takes that point back. Dean can’t keep those. Because if he’s right then Cas is wrong, which is, duh, wrong. And, for the same fucking record, he is wrong. He is fucking, fucking wrong.
And as his hand always stopped mid-motion last moment before it would be swallowed by Castiel’s orbit, before it’s too late, before it touches and the act can’t unhappen, it stops now, on the same muscle memory of shame. And it is then that Dean realizes he almost fell into that trap where the million-legged spider God would eat him.
“What,” he says, resigned.
Dean shifts his attention to Castiel. His expression is stern and pissed. So, so pissed. Like, alleyway pissed. That does not bode well for the future but Dean’s not gonna get down on his knees and suck for Crowley, of all people.
“Because I want you to know he’s no longer yours. He’s mine,” he chirps.
Why is surprise something he’s still capable of feeling? Like, right now? With this motherfucking deep, deep violation cherry on top? Fuck damn it.
“I wish you haven’t used that word.”
Thankfully.
“Well, newsflash,” they sneer, yanking Castiel out of his thoughts. “And congratulations. He doesn’t see you as the sweet, quirky humanlike sweetheart anymore. You’ve been promoted to Big Bad now. He looks at you, he doesn’t see a face. He just thinks and thinks what’s below and he’s scared,” they laugh with lightness meant for an anecdote, not a personal failure of this format. “Will you show him now? The screamer that you pretend you aren’t?”
Dean doesn’t even spare him a glance.
There comes a bitter smile. “Will that help you discipline your pet better?” Oddly, this doesn’t exactly sound like a snide remark directed at Dean but more like a challenge towards Cas. Like he’s trying to prove a point or something. “I can also add a lea—”
“Perhaps I should show you instead of telling you, then,” Castiel muses, murmuring against his mouth.
Now he thinks, still laughing, that his final words should actually be “fuck you, Cas.” Somehow, he can’t manage to force them out.
“Hey, Cas? You think you could make the call to get off that fucking bed, too? I kinda need to take a leak and you’re in my way.” Castiel just raises his eyebrows curiously as if there was anything to be shit damn curious about here. No, Cas. There’s not. Does he fucking think this is a challenge or what? Dean rolls his eyes with an obscene dosage of drama but doesn’t think it’s enough to give proper effect yet. “Oh for crying out loud,” he groans. “Move, I’m pregnant.”
There’s no way they’re gonna believe a promise of better times coming out of a swollen mouth and a ripped lip. Unless he starts his grand sacred vow with ‘I fell down some stairs,’ which ruins his plan quite a lot since he intended to go with ‘I’d like to thank the Academy.’ Whichever option he chooses in the end, the big stupid idiot with no understanding of the concept of a joke will strike him down, which is weirdly liberating. Then again, Cas, the perfect strategist and thorough caregiver, might actually spare him physically and go with something more effective, like setting people on fire. So much for his speech and liberation.
