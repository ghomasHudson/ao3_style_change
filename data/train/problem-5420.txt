” Castiel growls a warning, feigning an unimpressed air to show he’s being serious.
There’s a rush of saliva in his mouth at the images that conjures. He can feel the hard line of Dean where he wants just as badly. He wriggles slightly, savours the hot intake of breath against the side of his face.
Dean waited for him to answer. He must have been disappointed. “I can wait. I can wait forever. It doesn’t matter to me.” He babbled, unnerved by Cas’ silence.
He gently thumbs at the slit, experimentally spreading that drop over the head.
“What? Damn it Cas, no! No…” He sounds so unsure that Castiel is tempted to throw the rest of that drink in his face. Though he did see a girl on television do just that, so it would probably be an unwise action.
He shakes off the last vestiges of that last painful dream, and waits for morning to come.
“I did all that, because it was you. I love you.” Dean could no longer meet his eyes now, though he was practically shouting. “You think I only care about the physical stuff? Looks and the sex and all that junk?”
Castiel knew that to be true as well, though he found it hard to believe Dean could be so trusting, was willing to let Castiel do that to him. His heart swelled. Dean’s hand twisted, slipped his thumb over Cas’ slit so that a spike of pleasure shot through him. He moaned. A real, uncontrolled moan, the first in months.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Castiel chides primly, suppressing a smile. “You came into my bedroom remember and accosted me?”
“It’s odd for you?” Cas manages to gasp out, suppressing laughter. He’s the one with fingers inside of him. Dean winces a little at that so Castiel quickly adds: “But yes. It is good. It’s very, very good.” The words are heavy in his mouth. It almost sounds like he’s purring.
“I need to know,” Castiel insists.
It’s a welcome distraction from the ghost of Metaton’s knife anyway.
“You’re all human and squishy now, Cas. Gotta keep in shape.”  Says Dean, grinning broadly.
He feels Cas’ fingers prodding at his torn hands. It’s like a current is running through him and he snaps. “Are you kidding me?” He steps back, shoving the bag at Cas as moves far away from the angel, anger building like a storm.
“And since this is gonna be my first time, I want it done right.” Dean continued, words melting together, enticing all kinds of imagery. Cas’ body temperature rocketed. “I want you, healthy, ready, not rushing or doing it just to please me.” He could feel Dean’s hardness pressing against the curve of his ass, rocking a little into him, as though he couldn’t help himself. “It’s going to be so good. You know, just in case you needed a little motivation.”
“They'd be glad to have me!” He protested. “I’m just what they’ve been waiting for. I’m a delight!”
Cas looks contrite, head tilted in unmistakeable confusion. He didn’t even stagger. “I get it Cas, you don’t want me like this, I know. So stop making it so damn hard.”
He stormed off and hadn’t said a word since. Maybe he wants to forget. Maybe he can.
Food. Angel Castiel never really gave a damn about food. It tasted of molecules. It was fuel for humans, practical and nothing to do with him. Sometimes food was part of human social interactions, or just shovelled in so a person could keep going. And he thought the whole process of digestion, quite frankly, was disgusting.
Castiel watches in amusement as Dean proceeds to ‘dance’. This seems to involve bouncing around lightly on the balls of his feet like a toddler that needs to wee. Castiel keeps this piece of information to himself though, enjoying the sight before him.
He can feel Dean’s voice vibrate against his chest. “We just go with what feels good I guess.”
“What stuff?” He prompts, voice low and ragged.
He misses their voices most of all. Singing in melodious worship or wrathful vengeance. The silence is unbearable. It presses down on him like a weight, confining him to the Earth.
He bums money off of the Winchesters - can no longer just take what he needs. He has to deal with the constant onslaught of emotions, most of which he has no name for. Everything is bright and confusing- a bombardment of sensory information. Even if his senses are stunted, his perception limited now he‘s human. It’s still baffling. People are baffling. He can no longer see true faces, but has to work hard to glean meanings. It makes him confused, uneasy, whereas before he could push it all down and try not to care.
Castiel holds him as he falls apart; telling him it’s okay, that he wants this, that Dean can have this whenever he wants. Dean buries his face in his shoulder and bites down to silence his release, making Cas yelp.
“I will.” Cas murmurs as Sam limps away, presumably towards his bedroom. The slow, measured steps he takes have Castiel worrying all over again. He cannot imagine what it must do to Dean.
“I’m fine, Dean. You can’t hurt me.” He says patiently. Though not so sure about that, it’s a relief to hear all the same.
“Well, if you’d stop being a little bitch and listen actually listen to me you would know: I. Did. Not. Do. It!”
He must try.
Dean moans. “Stop pawing at me!” He laughs, cutting off into a groan when Castiel presses him down, writhing up against him. “Y-you sure you were an angel?”
This was how he’d made so many others suffer the same fate as him. How painful and utterly terrifying for his bewildered victims, Cas had thought in horror.
“I’m fine,” Castiel protests even though he sounds wretched to his own ears. “But I do happen to agree with Dean. You need time to recuperate. I’ll be fine.”
anyway.
Then, after making Castiel swear to watch over his little brother, he had left without another word of explanation.
“We ask the questions here, brother.” The woman’s voice is sharp, smugly triumphant and comes from behind him. He cannot see her but he can feel the blade she has pressed against his throat.
Those words send a shiver of lust and impatience down his spine as he remembers the last time he heard them a day ago. Cas’ body pressed against his, mouth open and wanting. He’s suddenly aware of the way his clothes constrict and cling to his body, drenched in sweat. He’s tired underneath it all, so tired, hands throbbing. He forgot to wrap tape around his fists and when he looks at them, realises his knuckles are split open. The bright gashes of red bring him back to himself. His nerves are thrumming from the strain of today’s vigorous training session, and the intensity of the situation.
This is what he misses. This is what he needs.
Metatron’s head tilts slightly in a way that had Dean thinking of angelic Cas’ old habits. It infuriates him. It’s as if Metatron is reading, borrowing from what he has stolen.
He briefly thinks that Anna was right all those years ago. It does get worse.
He slides his own down so that he may cup the backs of Cas’ hands gently. They leave a trail of fire in their wake. Castiel’s hands have stopped bleeding from the glass incident, but they smart terribly, feeling rough and sore.
When Dean next speaks, he sounds pretty smug. “Guess you really liked that then?”
Weeks go by. Weeks of not touching, of carefully sitting a respectable distance apart. Of tactfully not looking when getting changed in motel rooms. Of sensibly keeping Sam between them. Of trying not to stare too hard (at least on Dean’s part. Castiel had always been a starer and nothing will change that).
Sam is cured.
“Is he okay? He’s bleeding!”
Castiel doesn’t hear Dean request a room, doesn’t hear the curt exchange. The words wash over him. He stares at Dean’s elegant profile instead; feeling as though he has run a marathon, body tensed as though anticipating a fight. He sees the sardonic little smile light up Dean’s face as he grabs the keys, then grabs Cas by the arm and proceeds to drag him along to their room.
Dean begins to cant his hips downwards, pushing deep, so deep inside. Castiel is soon making strangled noises of his own. There’s something hot happening inside, something very good that Dean manages to find, to rub against only every now and then. It makes his whole body jolt, blending in with the lessening pain. The lines are blurring so well now. Dean is shaking with the effort of going so slow, but so deep. It feels right. Dean is the only human to get under his skin. The irony isn’t lost on him.
Dean replies by shimmying out of his underwear. He is intoxicated by the sight beneath, the length and thickness of him. The way his cock is straining, bead of pearly moisture at the tip. He reaches down, slowly, a question in his eyes that Dean doesn’t say no to.
He doesn’t say any of this. Doesn’t want to be strong and push Dean away. He needs him to feel alive. He runs his hands down Dean’s ribs, pressing in, pulling him closer.
“Still with me?”
The blade turned him into a murderer. The worst thing was: he liked it.
Castiel made soothing sounds and pressed a cool cloth over his head. That’s what they always did in the movies he’d seen.
He feels his face pull into a confused frown. “What iceberg?”
He rolled over to face Dean. “You are a health hazard, Dean Winchester.” He took one of those calloused hands, placed it on his own hardness.”You see what you’ve done?” It was the longest time he had been able to feel this way. His cock pulsed at Dean’s touch and he welcomed the sensation.
He’s trying to protect the man he loves by consorting with the creature that hurt him the most. The idea is laughable.
No answer except for the dip of his bed as Dean prowls closer. And then, dear God, he’s crawling up his body, straddling him, weight causing the sheets to pin him to the bed. Castiel has to fight the urge to throw him off. This is Dean. Not some dangerous enemy. Not a danger to him anyway.
He opens and closes his mouth, feeling an unsettling mix of slightly winded and ridiculously aroused. The ground is cold down his back, a contrast to the startling heat of Dean’s body. He tries to press closer, wriggling slightly. “That’s unfair.”
Cas blinks a few times before responding in a rush. He doesn’t want Dean to regret it. That’s the last thing he wants. “I have no complaints. I liked it in fact.”
He sweeps a thumb over his lower lip and sighs. Thinks back to his first kiss with Meg. He’d felt it back then. Or at least, he’d told himself he did. But just because his vessel had reacted didn’t mean he’d felt it all the way down, right to his very essence. He was going through the motions. An imitation of life.
“Ew. Gross.” Dean sits back on his haunches, looking scandalised. “You don’t bring up a guy’s brother. Not after what we just did. Or almost did.” He grins slyly.
Castiel had to wipe a bit of burger off his face that Dean had lost during his little rant. He could only sit there, stunned, as the realisation hit him. “Are you jealous Dean?”
“Hmm.”
“We are not having this conversation!”
Now he does.
Castiel closes his eyes again, hoping the nausea will fade. There’s another sensation he has never felt before. It frightens him. The fact that he can even register fear makes a cold sweat break out across his body. He may have even let out a moan. He feels less in control of this body now it
“The I suppose you’d better do it.” He growls, calling them cowards with one look. They had to tie up one human to get the best of him. They hate him, but still they fear him. His name lives on.
“He came back to me before.” Dean argues quietly to himself more than anything. “He always comes back to me.” He hates the uncertainty in his voice, the little flicker of pain, of doubt.
“Dean…” Cas begins and it's the little break, all sadness and longing in one syllable, that undos him. The way Cas’s hands curl and unfurl at his sides as though deciding whether or not to reach out. Dean is pulling him into his arms before he even decides to react.
He knows Cas would kill him if he returns to full angelic strength. This is all just a ploy…
-----------------
Will angel-Cas still be able to love his brother the way human Cas does? Anna always said angels don’t feel the way humans do. He knows Castiel has always loved Dean on some level. They’ve always had a deep bond, have needed each other more than they ever were willing to admit.
Unfortunately, Dean has also realised how shamelessly easy he is to distract. And can, and will, use this knowledge to his advantage. For instance:
“She was my wife.” Cas replies simply. “Though not lawfully of course, having no identity. It’s all a bit of a blur. Like it happened to someone else…”
Soon to be resolved...
“Throw that down and you’ll never see me again.” Metatron sneers, hands in pockets, trying to look apologetic as he steps out of the circle of holy oil.
that?!”
This is truly the calm before the storm.
He does clean the bite on his shoulder, even if the skin is unbroken. It looks angry - puffy, and there’s a little circle of bruises forming the shape of Dean’s mouth, some purpling. He shakes his head with faint amusement. It was hot at the time but now he looks like a damn chew toy.
. Dean could practically cry at the promise of such sweet relief. He doesn’t know what he did to deserve this. It feels so good even though it shouldn’t be. He’s dragged Cas down to his level, never meant to. Caught in lust and the mark and his messed up world. He
His eyes are closing again and he grips Sam’s hand tighter, anchoring him to the present.
He’s still grinding, muttering obscenities, so close now. He rambles, apologising for wanting this so much, for needing it exactly like this. Calling Cas beautiful as he finishes, groan coming from deep within. Every movement jolts his body. Dean drops his leg and presses down hard one last time.
Castiel had at first pretended not to notice. Had not broken the comfortable silence. Instead, he had snuck glances at the man in the doorway, trying not smile and failing once he‘d accidentally caught Dean‘s eye. It was a goofy moment, one that would be preserved in his memory like a snapshot in time. Even if he was sure not to scrutinise Dean’s expression too closely - which had been a look of fondness with swirling thoughts circling underneath. He wished he could read them again, and not for the first time.
That really wasn’t what he expected to hear at all. Maybe: ‘still hungry?’ or ‘Still considering sexual activities with myself?’ (though Dean wouldn’t word it quite like that). He most certainly doesn’t know why it would cause Dean such discomposure. He answers in a normal (not quiet) voice:
He didn’t believe a word of it. Dean’s huge, wolfish grin did little to quell his suspicions. But then Dean’s hand slid up his thigh and he decided that going along with the programme seemed like a less painful, more viable option for now.
He cannot recognise the man in front of him. Now he is human, he can no longer see the true forms of his siblings. It hurts to realise that. He tilts his head, focuses harder, ignores the stab of pain that triggers, no answers are forthcoming.
"Yeah, that's not happening and because of your claim of kinship with Cas here we're family and family sticks together no matter what," Dean said as he wipes his mouth with his hand. "Oh, you want any of this?" Dean asked holding up a second burger the first one obviously demolished.
“I'm sorry gummy bear, but I don't want you to get hurt and this is the only way to make sure,” Gabriel explained as he knelt down next to her. “Please promise me no more after this, ok?”
Castiel showed up through the door holding the couples’ bags after Gabriel’s outburst. “Guys I could hear you by the garage,” Castiel berated as he made his way down the stairs. “And she’s not Dean’s daughter she is mine,” Castiel admitted calmly knowing that the brothers would not react nicely.
Dean looks at Gabriel in distrust, crossing his arms over his chest. “You are part of the team now so if you know something then you have to say it. Or is this one of your big pranks?” He asked stubbornly, not letting this go.
“Hiya kiddo,” Sam replied with a smile forming on his face.
“Dean, who is she?” Sam asked worry in his voice as Seraphina looked around sleep still evident in her eyes. “Please don’t tell me you have another daughter,” Sam pleaded the guilt of Emily on his mind as he said this.
Castiel pulls out his angel blade in case Fenrir tried to attack him. He was used to the threats, after traveling with the Winchesters for almost 10 years, but he'd never seen these two before. “One is a halfling Gabriel, she is unstable in her abilities. That instability can be harmful to the world. We have to tell Dean and Sam.” The stoic angel told his elder brother, slightly disappointed.
Dean takes a nap and is a dick and Seraphina gets to the bunker eventually
Dean quickly used his blade to block the attack from above and kicked the angel back again, gritting his teeth when the other angel got a hit it. He fought harder to make sure he got to Castiel, an angel getting a good swing on his back with a blade. He ended up stumbling at the pain, blindly attacking the angels. Dean finally was happy to end the two angels attacking him. Yet he had bruised ribs and a deep cut on his back that desperately needed stitches before something happened like him passing out...again. “Cas!” He yelled and continued to try to save Castiel.
-----------
“Stop it, everyone!” Gabriel yells at the top of his lungs almost breaking the windows of the room. “Everyone back the fuck up and put your weapons down or I swear to father I will turn them into flowers. And don't fucking test me Dean Winchester,” Gabriel huffs.
Fenrir growls as he protectively pulled his little sister close to him, glaring at the angel on the couch. “Father, I don’t get why you aren’t telling us to run again.” He says as he tries to calm down Sugar. Sugar looks like she was about to pitch a fit with the events that were happening. She squirms down and runs to Gabriel, hugging his legs. The little girl was terrified because of Castiel’s angel blade and the potential fight that almost happened. Gabriel picked up Sugar setting her on his hip.
“You didn’t have to do that,” Castiel chastised in a cold voice his displeasure plainly evident.
“Too late,” said a familiar voice. Their father, the archangel Gabriel, stood in the doorway.
"Night night," Sugar called back almost asleep.
“Oh thank god,” Jovi breathed out, receiving a raised eyebrow from her new family. “Alvis and I won’t be the only gays,” Jovi said cheerfully.
“Too late bud, you said we couldn't miss the meeting,” Dean quipped. After a hmph from Cas Dean continued getting dressed.
“5 minutes before I got here,” Castiel replied calmly not thinking about the consequences of his actions.
“Dean this is not our home,” Castiel replied looking over at Dean concerned.
“Those are the children of the Dean-o and Sampala,” Gabe replied smirking, looking at Dean. Dean frowned before glaring at the old Trickster.
Suddenly the rumble of the impala was heard through the window.
“I will not let you hurt my children,” Gabriel snarled at Castiel as he stood in front of his children ready to fight his brother to keep them safe.
“I’m gonna go talk to Gabe about getting Rowena here,” Sam whispered before leaving. “Holy shit!” Sam yelled as a giant dog turned the corner. Dean looked out the door and watched as Sam pressed against the wall having a staring contest with a giant black dog that continued past him before facing Dean. Dean held his hands up while backing up and allowing the dog to enter the infirmary.
"The kids need us more,” Sam said matter of factly looking back at the twins.
“Thanks love,” Dean notes as he walks toward the bed stripping off the towel.
“Well you're just a spoiled brat!”
“We both know that if I had joined we would have missed our appointment with the coroner,” Cas teased. Dean smirked and kissed Cas on the cheek before returning to his bag grabbing the suit which was folded neatly for once.
“Listen all I'm only going to explain this once!” Gabriel exclaimed. “This is Loki's child, Fenrir, I have adopted him as my own, no killing. Now this evil chunk of sunshine is my love child Sugar. She was born about 6 years ago and we've been working on getting her to control her powers, but she sometimes goes haywire,” Gabriel introduced.
“No, no, no. That ain't going to work this time. The Winchesters are on your tail,” Gabriel said as he ran his fingers through his hair. The stress was starting to get to him.
“It’s not your fault,” he whispers, reluctant to begin this conversation. They’ve had it some many times before, in many variations.
“Dean,” Cas chokes out again. It sounds too much like that voice. The voice. The stunned way Cas said his name after not-Ezekiel brought him back from the dead. He shakes his head, grasps at Castiel harder. The thought made his mouth go dry, made him feel that panic, that anguish and memory of sheer terror. He doesn’t want to think about seeing a lifeless Cas ever again.
“Do you really want me to stop?” Dean’s question cuts through his spinning thoughts. His voice is low, stare direct and earnest as if he can read every dirty little thought that just went through Castiel’s mind.
Dean didn’t meet his eyes, but Sam knew what he was thinking. He’d seen the way Dean had fretted at the hospital whilst the doctor’s worked on Cas. The agony when he’d seen the extent of what the angels had done to him. How he’d furiously paced, mind closed off and face a blackened storm. Fists clenched like he wanted to tear the perpetrators apart.
Blood beats faster in his head as he leans forward, breathes in deeply. His heart pumps adrenaline through his once stolen body. He spreads his arms out wide. It almost feels like flying again. He can almost imagine his wings unfurling in holy splendour, air rippling through them. All gone. One small step and he’d fall into the abyss. Wouldn’t be able to soar. He can almost feel the false sense of exhilaration.
“Found it!” Dean calls out triumphantly. He saunters into view gripping a green medi-kit and a half drunk bottle of whiskey, boots clunking heavily. “Doctor Dean will get you all patched up.”
Human Castiel was a different matter all together. It was a shock, to be so dependant, to both need and want to eat. The pangs of hunger, the contort of a full stomach. Cas loved pizza. He loved experimenting with the toppings, trying new flavours, eating with his hands, chewing slowly and savouring the flavours. He liked ice-cream, though the cold had startled him terribly at first. The brothers had roared with laughter at his brain-freeze reaction. They had told him he wasn’t dying though he clearly was. But he liked the smooth, creamy blend of flavours. He was amazed at the broad scope of textures, taste and the many categories of food that humans had created for themselves. The sensory information was almost too much at first.
Getting Cas’ grace back could be dangerous for them both.
Asthma. An asthmatic ghost.
“Jesus. I really went to town on you didn’t I?” He sucks in a breath that makes Cas shiver when it skims down his chest. He sounds like an unusual combination of bitter and turned on. Castiel tilts his head, examines his expression as Dean tracks the movement, eyes fixed the bruise.
Castiel hums non-committedly and sits up once more, hands regretfully leaving the globes of that wonderful ass.  They continue to slide up and down his back, restlessly, meaning to soothe, not excite.
Castiel considered Dean’s words carefully. Was he stating, that he had been able to overlook his vessel’s gender, because he fell in love with the person inside? Therefore, physical appearances meant very little when it came to their relationship? It was odd logic yet strangely comforting. But the back of his mind insists that Dean is once more dodging the real issues here, revealing so much by saying so little. He knows that Dean must find the male form attractive on some level, and not just the body Cas now possesses. But that’s a thread to pull at another day.
“I don’t know.”
“That didn’t hurt very much.”
“What?” He feels nervous apprehension flood through him. Was he not good? How could it not have been good for Dean?
He had a real sweet tooth for cookies and chocolate, despite Dean’s various warnings he would ‘get pudgy.’ Fruits were a favourite, juicy and fresh, sweet and ripe. He liked to eat with Dean. To savour his pleasure. He’d imagined introducing food into new situations with Dean… Scenarios that had made him weak at the knees. Eating was a sensual experience, sometimes a little messy, often enjoyable.
“Of course I can, I’m brilliant.” He beams. “Maybe not his grace… But setting all of that aside, I gotta ask, why would you even want to?” The question startles Dean. “I mean think about it. What happens once he gets his grace back hmm? Figuratively of course.” He doesn’t like that look in his eyes at all now. It’s sadistic, patronising, and just the tiniest bit…sympathetic?
Castiel cannot contain the shiver of dread that elicits. But he says nothing. What is there to say? He is the reason they fell, Metatron left him high and dry. He doesn’t know how to reverse the spell. Doesn’t have the magic words to satisfy their questions, to make the pain stop. So he says nothing.
he finds himself thinking once more.
The image does have a certain appeal to it but Castiel understands. “Having the same problem,” He blurts out, causing Dean to laugh a little. That laugh is good, it’s his Dean, not the slightly intimidating dirty-talker of before.
“We passed a motel on the way here,” Castiel points out helpfully, sounding casual though he feels anything but.
He can hear Cas padding closer, closes his eyes and leans against the punch bag, locking his arms around it loosely. He can’t bear to look at Cas.
“No!” Dean insists indignantly. “Well… Yes. Maybe. Jeez you’re like a mind reader or something.”
“Yes you did…” Dean prompts gently.
“Well, I know
Dean shoves his hands in his pockets and paces. He can tell it won’t be long.
“You,” He answers simply, practically a growl.
Before he can get those words out, Dean has flipped their positions and pinned Castiel back to the bed. He presses down so they lie flush against each other. He can feel every inch of Dean. Dean can feel every inch of him.
“Humanity is a gift in itself, my father’s gift,” Metatron continues. “And through Castiel’s sacrifice I can now build a better heaven. Without the riffraff.” He tacks on hurriedly.
“For the thousandth time: I didn’t do anything! I wish I had. You think I like feeling like I’ve failed you?” His voice had cracked with over-dramatic emotion, but Sam and Cas didn’t buy it for a moment.
“Not anymore.” Castiel says stiffly.
“Forget it,” Cas muttered straight away, rolling off Dean to lie by his side, his usual defensive position. Dean held on to his arm before he could roll to turn away.
His mouth went completely dry at that. Or more likely in response to what was not being said, but rather implied. Dean squeezes his arm, eyes locked on his own. He’s so close that Castiel could count every freckle across his face if he wished.
Everything’s becoming wet and obscene. He’ll never forget the sounds of wet flesh on flesh, the sight before him. When he risks a peek he can see Cas has leaned back a bit. He can see those damp lips, wrapped around him, the soft curve of lashes against his cheek. He thinks the angel may be humming with concentration a little. It’s too much. He’s too slick as Cas moves up and down, taking him deeper, sucking, pulling, fucking
“Do it now Sammy!” The voice was behind him, edged with desperation.
“Argh! Gross Sam! First of all, we weren’t ‘going at it’. He adds venomous air-quotes, going red. “Just kissing - stop pulling faces! - and second of all, don’t go calling him our brother like I’m some kind of incest-happy pervert!”
Castiel feels his eyes widen at that but Dean doesn’t notice, keeps his eyes firmly on the task at hand. Cas feels like an infant, helpless and trusting in this human’s hands. He feels the warmth where Dean’s finger and thumb hold him steady. He relishes the gentle touch. They haven’t been close like this for so long. He can count the dusky freckles across Dean’s face if he wished. Name the shades of colour in Dean’s eyes.
Sorry for the wait. I had no intention of continuing this. But Cas and Dean wouldn't leave me alone.
As short, unkempt and weasel-grinned as the first time they’d met, when he’d been in hiding, the scribe steps out of the shadows, dramatically enough to make Dean roll his eyes. “How long you been there?”
“I am not hormonal!”
---------------------------------------
Something darkens in Dean’s gaze and it has Castiel’s stomach fluttering in anticipation. Dean withdraws his hand, sits up between Castiel’s thighs, grabs the tin of gun oil and adds a liberal amount to his hand, eyes never leaving Castiel’s as he does so. He rubs his fingers slowly, warming the oil before resettling between Castiel’s legs.
for God’s sake. He lies. He always lies.
“…Just make sure you both know where you stand.” Sam concludes gently. “I don’t want you guys getting hurt.”
It’s too much. Too much for both men as the bed frame rocks and creaks beneath them, flesh slapping together, panting filling the air as they exchange breaths. The double pressure inside and his hand sliding against his slick cock is too much, he cries out against Dean’s neck, let’s go to escape the feeling of too much. Castiel goes hurtling over the edge, mind blanking out. He’s seeing stars as waves of pleasure flood through him, hot and wild. It’s intense and goes on forever, coating their stomachs, shaking in ecstasy. As he comes, this time Castiel does the biting. He sinks his teeth into the long juncture of neck and shoulder, sucks hard to stifle the sounds of his release to stop himself screaming.
“What are you blabbering on about?” Dean practically growls. “You know, for someone who’s so short of time, you don’t half love to hear yourself talk…”
-------------
“Very funny Dean.” Sam raises his eyebrows. “You know I wouldn’t care about that, it’s just…”
“But you
“Is that what you think?” Castiel replies, eyes wide, looking so young.
“You like this?” the pad of his thumb shifts over the damp patch causing Dean’s breath to catch, he bites his lip to keep from swearing.
Cas wrinkles his nose but accepts the bottle anyway. He doesn’t think ‘Doctor Dean’ should mix alcohol with a head wound but says nothing. He also doesn’t like the taste of spirits. It does funny things to his head now he no longer has the constitution of an angel. He doesn’t want to lower his inhibitions. Especially around Dean.
“Yeah you heard me. And keep it down, all your wailing is freaking Cas out.”
Sam looked at his big brother with worry, with concern. He poured him a cup of coffee, listens as Dean changes subjects, rambles on about some classic rock band reforming.
“Now finish your pie, my little, not-so innocent fallen angel.” The smile he gives him is quite predatory and Castiel nearly chokes on his mouthful as he laughs nervously.
“Nothin’ good on. Not even a decent porno – what kind of motel
Dean looks so hopeful, his smile so bright, that Castiel cannot possibly protest. What he really thought they needed was more sex after sex but never mind. He is an ancient being.  He can and will control himself.
you did it...sort of. I just don’t know what to do with that.” He sighs, hand making his hair spiky. “You’re my best friend. And a dude. And
To Cas’ surprise, Dean doesn’t tear out of the Impala as if the former angel had something that was catching. He just sits there, in the sudden darkness, smouldering and still gripping the wheel. Castiel knows he’s going to say something. He can feel it brewing.  Dean has never been the most vocal person when it comes to discussing feelings so Cas just sits in silence, waiting. He doesn’t expect it to be anything good, but is patient anyway, head tilted towards Dean in a show of nonchalance though his heart is racing like the traitor it now is.
Castiel sighed as he faces forward again while figuring out if the girl’s story was true, Dean was a larger priority to Castiel. While carrying the hunter to the car Castiel realized Seraphina was still wearing the cuffs, well this will be interesting. After laying the hunter down across the back seats of the impala Castiel reached down to heal the wounds of which were taking a much larger toll than Castiel originally thought. Standing back up Castiel walked over to the driver's side door getting in before driving back to the motel.
The brothers looked at each other as the last of the kids left the room.
After Dean and Cas’ fun, they finally headed to the warehouse to check out the scene. Dean went in first to make sure it was safe for his angel before pulling him inside. “So now what?” He said as he looked around.
Sugar whines and squirms out of her brother’s arms, hugging Gabriel’s leg tightly. “But Daddy! I don’t want you to leave again!” She was crying now as she talks. She was missing having her father with her. “Pwease! I promise to be good!”
“I mean, I meant to tell you earlier, but-” Dean was cut off as Castiel stormed off.
“Shit!” Jovi exclaimed as she started pacing around, “Stupid dumbass! I’m the one who's supposed to get hurt!” Crossing her arms she pulled her thumb to her mouth chewing on the nail.
“Jovi,” Dean said quietly while nodding towards the door. She looked at Alvis, he nodded and Jovi smiled before getting up. Walking around Sam who got closer and took her spot.
The 10-hr. drive took a lot longer than expected and the fam didn’t return until late in the night. Sam and Gabriel stayed up waiting for their return worried about their respective brother. The impala drove into the garage and parked in the first spot next to the door. Dean got out and stretched, his back popping as he got used to being out of a car. Walking to the back-door Dean opened it. While peering into the back seat he realized that Seraphina had passed out sprawled across the seats one leg bent against the door the other laying at a weird angle off the side of the cushioning, one arm behind her head propping it up as the other covered her eyes from the occasional lighting of streetlights along the road. Dean smiled the girl reminded him of when Sam was a teen reaching down Dean shook the leg of her jeans the smile fading as she sat up.
"Wait where are my clothes?" Seraphina questioned worriedly about the items that held her entire world. Sleepily Sugar pointed over at the table where Seraphina's clothes were folded before messing with the white and orange braids that hung in front of her. Seraphina noticed this and got very confused about where the braids came from especially since that was not her hair color. Out of the top, her vision there was purple showing and Seraphina had to guess that it was a hat with braids attached.
Dean heard a noise and turned around to face wherever he heard it. “I don’t think we're alone anymore,” Dean whispered and tried to walk over to the angel in the trenchcoat.
Set after the main story, the girls are getting along like a hurricane.
“What are you talking about,” Castiel asked his eyes narrowing at his brother.
“You lead them right to us?!” Fenrir barked at Castiel standing up ready to lunge at the angel.
“Oh, Shit,” Gabriel said under his breath. Thinking about his youngest daughter’s affinity for sugar.
Fenrir knew what was about to happen. “Father, Sugar didn’t have anything sweet. She was tired from the long day and refused to take a nap, Scout’s honor.” He tells him.
Castiel looked back at Dean, who was still passed out sprawled across the back seat, sighing he walked around and opened the back door. Dean's hand flopped out and Castiel had trouble not laughing before dragging Dean across the seats and into the motel room. Dragging the man across the room Castiel threw him onto the bed. Looking around Castiel realized that they had no food and Dean would most likely be hungry after an event like that. Walking back out making sure that Dean wouldn't choke on his tongue and to lock the room Castiel drove to the closest dinner where the two went to lunch earlier in the day.
Cas decided to walk to where the bodies were found and looked to see what had happened. “Well, this seems accidental by nature judging by the markings…so I am thinking of a fledgling or someone who we haven’t met.” He said looking at Dean.
“No, I don't want to it looks better this way!” Sugar yelled.
Gabriel turns around as Sam brushes his hair back. A silent DAYYYMM going through his head. Why, oh why, did the glorious moose have to come up!
Castiel puts his blade away and looks at Gabriel with a confused look, sighing. “So...should I say that I told Dean and Sam I may have found the problem and gave a location?”
"What the fuck," Fenrir yelled hands covering his ears. The frequency hurting his sensitive ears. Seraphina looked down at the kid attached to her legs with wide eyes.
“Thanks, Dean,” Seraphina replied softly when Dean let her go at the bottom of the stairs. The entire time Sam and Gabriel had been silently watching the eldest Winchester brother bring in a young girl.
“You little shit,” Gabriel said under his breath and Sugar giggled in response. Sam and Dean got closer to the bed and Alvis looked up at the brothers. He had a shit-eating grin when he said, “Hi Dad. Hi Uncle Dean.” Jovi rolled her eyes as Sam and Dean smiled and chuckled at the kid.
“Who are coming? Father...you never tell us what or who we had to avoid.” Fenrir asked him, gently picking his little sister up.
“Nothing, nothing at all,” Gabriel said, but very unconvincingly.
“Are you just going to stand there or are you gonna help me out of these?” Seraphina asked the attitude dripping from each word. Narrowing his eyes Dean grabbed the chain between the cuffs pulling Seraphina into the motel room. Still attached to the chain the momentum of being pulled in caused Seraphina to whirl around looking at Dean this time in a new environment. Dean looked back out the door making sure no one had witnessed him pulling the girl in. Turning around Dean glared at the girl who was making his life difficult, he grabbed her shoulders and threw her on the bed.
As the family talked everyone gradually left the room Rowena and Gabriel talking as Sugar chilled with her head on Gabriel’s shoulder. They heard a loud burst of laughs as Diaval jumped on to the bed to join his master. The group noticed Castiel, Seraphina holding onto Castiel’s arm while Jack gave silent support behind Castiel on his other side, and Gabriel gave Castiel a small smile of encouragement. They walked up and Seraphina knocked on the door. Dean looked over and smiled at Castiel, glad to see him.
“Wait squirrel here was giving me crap about having kids when he’s got kids of his own?!” Gabriel exclaimed confusion shown in the words the trickster emphasized.
What happens between Gabriel and Fenrir before Sam interrupts.
“Well let's check New York out. We need to do a couple witness accounts anyway. Maybe find out what we're dealing with,” Dean said pushing authority into his tone letting everyone else know this was not to be negotiated.
“I am her mother from when my vessel was female in the early 1900s,” Castiel said regretfully looking down in shame.
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?” Dean growled out.
At this moment the only thing Gabriel could think was ‘Oh shit.’
“Sam,” Dean growled.
Castiel smiled to himself as he went to carry his love back to the car. “I know you didn't,” Castiel replied as he dragged the unconscious man back to the impala. “Come on Dean would kill me if I let you go,” Castiel remarked and as he looked back he saw only the fading figure of his possible daughter as she ran the opposite direction.
Dean’s hips bucked, involuntarily, at the intrusion, his mouth watering at the words. He loved the burn, the way Cas was opening him up before they went any further. One finger slowly turned to two, and two turned to three, Dean becoming a moaning and whimpy mess, he wanted more, more of Cas, more of everything. Cas had poured the rest of the bottle of lube onto his length, pumping himself until he was coated fully and safely. His hands gripped tight onto Dean’s hips, spreading his cheeks wide.
Beta’d by my good friend Soul.
Cas pulled the drink to his lips, savoring the warmth it gave him before speaking, his eyes glanced around for a split second and realized the whole bar was silent as they all listened in. “I was. I was discharged about 7 years ago, and then I had college and now I have to work a lot. I’m a Professor down at Kansas State.. I’m sorry about not keeping in touch, I was pretty busy.” He watched everyone listen to his explanation, and it looked like some of them didn’t believe him.
Over and over again.
“So? I had to get your attention somehow.” Castiel opened the cruiser’s door for him, helping him in. He rolled his eyes, but as the door closed he let a small smile show. Dean truly was something else.
He hadn’t even managed to change clothes since the incident, so he slowly stood and walked to the bathroom, his entire body shaking as he took each step. Why was he so rattled? Did he really think that coming out to was worse than the military? Yes, yes he did. He could control his emotions overseas, discard his sadness and fear as soon as they started, he could distance himself from those he had killed in war, in battle. The ones who haunted him were casualties, the innocents. He could distance himself from the innocents only a small bit, as he never directly killed an innocent, but he was just a a chess piece in the game of war, a soldier to be sacrificed or used to sacrifice others. His moves always meant that in the end, an innocent would die, even if it wasn’t by his own hand. But when it comes to coming out to a religious and majorly heterosexual town? That was like tying yourself to a stake and striking your own match to lure the flames, horror was definitely coming. He was sure now that he’d be despised, gossiped about by every corner of the town..he’d just have to remember that he was the one at fault here, he was the odd one, he was the one who shed a light on his oddness. He knew that people feared what they don’t understand.
” Cas kept repeating in his mind, his eyes avoiding Dean’s. Dean  just walked closer, his face so close to Cas’, Cas was afraid he’d melt.
“Cas, you got dumped at 18 right before graduation. You enlisted the week before graduation and shipped out when you actually did graduate. You ran out of the state a week after a man revealed that he used you. You never really got over the whole thing.” Charlie stated, sighing when Cas felt his shoulders fall and a frown form on his face. Maybe he should accept it, his father was right. He did always run, he was a coward.
The two laid there in that position for awhile, Dean full of cum as well as covered in it as he laid on Castiel’s chest while Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, humming and kissing praises into his skin. “You did so good,” he would hum, kissing his temples softly to remind him of how good he really was.
Dean’s hips pushed back at Castiel’s clothed cock, finally whining out, “I want you to fucking ruin me, Officer Novak. Use me, fuck please, destroy me.”
Gabriel, part of the dispatch team who worked from the station, was all for Dean's childish pranks. He was close with Cas, practically brothers, and he was an avid believer that Cas needed to “
It’s been four years since Castiel became a police officer, it’s been four years of the same old doughnuts and stale coffee. It’s also been four years that Castiel has been the target of a certain offender’s affection.
Dean was Castiel’s first arrest without assistance, and it was actually pretty funny. Castiel was the one who took Dean into the station for ruining Officer Zachariah’s boots, and it took all he had in him not to start crying from laughter because Zachariah was being a huge asshole and deserved it that night. Dean liked that Cas smiled, and Cas liked that Dean made his crappy night better.
Before Charlie could get another word out, Cas spoke again, “I have to get to work. I’ll see you later Charls.” Irritation and sadness evident in his voice. Charlie didn’t push anything, watching Cas walk through a door and into the large lecture hall where he taught his students. She felt bad. Charlie knew how hard it is to get over your first love, it took her a long time as well.. but Cas wasn’t in love with Dean.. right?
Cas loved the sound of his name coming from Dean’s lips, loved how he looked taking every inch of his dick. Cas was going crazy, crazy with lust. He needed To see Dean’s face.
Dean almost argued back that he wasn’t gay, but he didn’t, he didn’t feel that way anymore. “No, Cas. Goddamnit Cas I could care less about what those dumbasses think about me. I’m worried about you. You could get jumped now!” Dean was worried out of his mind, why else would he come over at 10pm on a Friday night?  Especially to an ex’s house?
“Holy snotgoblins! Are you okay?” Charlie asked, her voice laced with concern. She knew about the whole ordeal with Dean and Cas, she was the one who laughed and made jokes that Cas turned “Mr.Heterosexual”  into “Mr.KissMeCasPlease” with one look, to which Cas would reply with a blush and a slap to her shoulder in embarrassment.  She was the one who held Castiel as he cried in his room and made threats upon Dean’s masculinity with her replica of Hermione Granger’s wand, followed by his other friends putting Dean on a list that banned him from ComicCon, Kevin still swears that it was a horrible punishment.
.” Gabriel fell to the floor when Cas got the words out, almost choking on the lollipop he always had in his mouth. Let’s just say, April transferred out just as fast as she transferred in.
“You’re creasing.” Charlie mumbled, walking over to pat his back. Whenever Cas frowned, a crease formed between his eyebrows, something that as a teenager he used to hate about himself, but now he could care less. When in war, all you do is frown.
Dean went through a whole array of emotions as Ellen spoke, his mind not being able to process Castiel Novak tossing heavy and buff men around like they weighed nothing. He felt his whole body freeze when Ellen mentioned Cas admitting his sexuality. Cas coming out was strange, especially since Dean had knew Cas was gay but only in a secret way, not in the way that now everyone knew. Yes Dean did date Cas all senior year in high school, but it was all in secret and Dean just never saw himself as gay or bisexual. Did it feel nice when he kissed men? Yes. Did he try to kiss men? Not when he was sober. Cas was just an experiment, Dean always swore to himself. All the men Dean had been with have all been experiments, Dean always saw it this way. Now Dean was older and since he saw Cas at the club, he can’t help but feel that maybe he did like guys, or maybe just Cas. But it’s been so long, so many years, why was he still caught up over Castiel Novak?
“I was 18, Cas! What would you do if your father found your phone and saw photos of you kissing a guy? What would you do if your father threatened to kill you for kissing a guy?!” Dean broke, the truth coming out. Wet hot tears ran down his cheeks, leaving tracks in their wake, he was crumbling. “He held his gun to my head, Cas.. he cocked it and drove me to your house that day. He told me no son of his was going to be  a faggot....”
“Yep. Came in and started talking about where he’s been for the last 17 years, apparently that sweet boy was in the military. Roy called him out and it ended with Roy bleeding on the floor. Not that Roy didn’t deserve it, but Castiel doing it? I remember when he was still afraid of speaking to strangers.” Ellen had sighed, worried out of her mind. “I don’t know how Roy is going to retaliate, since Castiel admitted to liking men right before he tossed Roy to the ground like he weighed nothing. And you know how Roy is with those sweet  homosexual folk, he’s as bigoted as they come.”
“Ellen? What’s up?” Dean had asked, drying cups and putting them up. He’s never seen Ellen so upset or confused, so unsure and worried.
Cas laid in his house shaking. It’s been a few days since he assaulted someone and aggressively came out to a whole bar of heterosexuals who hated the gays, thankfully the weekend now, and all he’s been doing is shaking. He knew how small towns go, how gossip spreads like wildfire. He knew he was going to get a call from his parents, maybe even his siblings, just to call him a failure once more, probably kick him out of the family for being who he is.
The night was spent with Cas nursing Dean’s red and sore wrists, kissing all up and down his body in an unspoken agreement that this is what they needed, soft moments and tender care.
“You grew, boy.” Ellen teased, pouring him some  whiskey. “Where have you been? Gabriel told everyone you ran off to the military but no one believed him, you know him and his tall tales.”
“I should be right? It’s been years since I saw him last. Why do I still feel like it’s been a week since he dumped me?” Cas questioned, opening the door to his office. Charlie walked in, turning and placing a hand on her hip, staring down Cas almost as to say “
“Not gonna pat me down, Novak?” Dean teased as they started down the road.  Dean had a few.. tricks up his sleeves.
Cas looked up at Dean, his arms going to wrap around him. He smiled as Dean lowered, until they were chest to chest, close enough to hear each other breathing, and that was when Cas gave it his all.
The night ended up with Dean and Cas crying together, holding each other for dear life as they cried in the middle of the floor. A mystery between them finally solved.
The next mystery being, how are Cas and Dean going to go forward with this new bounty of information?
The cruiser came to a startling halt, resting on the side on an abandoned road. Dean looked almost confused, possibly even shocked as Cas got out his car and opened up the left car door, pulling Dean with a strength not even he knew he had.
“It’s entertaining, and I’m laughing. It’s totally funny.” and that was the last Cas heard from Gabriel for the rest of his drive.
“I tried to find you after we graduated, I tried to figure out where you were so I could tell you what happened but.. but you were gone. I never dated Lisa, hell I never dated anyone after you. Fuck I never even admitted to myself that I liked guys after you left, I kept thinking “oh it’s just an experiment.” when I got with another guy, because it’d last an hour and then they’d be gone. Cas I wanted to run away with you.” Dean looked up finally, his eyes piercing Cas’s brilliant blue ones. “Cas that night after graduation I was going to drive to your house and I was going to ask you to run away with me, so we’d be free. Finally free.”
Finally, every officer in the station swore to stop arresting Dean, it was obviously encouraging his behavior instead of punishing it. If Dean HAD to get arrested, Cas would have to be the person to do it, as he’s avoided it for almost four years. None of the other officers could handle Dean anymore.
“Call me Cas.” He grunted out, slowly pulling out before slamming back in, Dean letting out a cry of “Cas!” proceeded by a bunch of “fuck yes’s”
like she was the source of your oxygen? Because I do. I remember every single fucking thing you said to me, did to me.” Cas clenched his fists, resisting all urges to punch Dean square in the jaw, to make Dean feel even just a fraction of the pain he made Cas feel.
Realization set in Castiel’s features,  “The night I deployed, the night you called me repeatedly.. you were..?” Dean just nodded, and Cas felt the chains that held his body down break, the misery that twisted itself around every movement Cas made was finally gone.
“Why? Got something the clerk didn’t catch?” Castiel had asked, authority in his voice. That authority made Dean’s knees buckle, his hands gripping onto the leather seat he sat on. The handcuffs twisted slightly as he did so, a delicious burn attacking his wrists. Dean let out a small whine, the feeling was addicting. He looked up to see Cas wasn’t paying attention, silently hoping he didn’t hear his sounds just yet.
He unlocked and unchained the door, opening it to reveal a familiar faced blond with almost glowing green eyes, who walked in almost instantly. Cas closed the door when he learned how to function again, resting up against it to watch Dean pace around.
” Cas was embarrassed of course, but looking up to see those bright green eyes and a handsome man winking at him made up for it.
“Shut it, Gabe. It’s not funny.” Cas grumbled, driving down the road and kept a watch for the convenience store, just to make sure he wouldn’t pass it.
“I’ll get over him. I will.”  Cas finally spoke, his voice wavering as he did so. It was hard, to think of moving past the horror that was his one attempt at a love life.
“I can take them.”
Cas slammed into Dean’s prostate, a strangled moan coming from Dean as he tried his best to fuck down onto him.  The two were a mess of pants, of gasps, moans, whines. They were completely intoxicated with each other as they fucked like rabbits,  Cas leaning down to suck bruises all around his neck.
Fenrir picks Sugar up and holds her close, watching their dad protect him. “Father who is this and why does he want to harm Sugar?” He says, moving closer to the window, a potential escape route. He made sure he knew all the ways out of a house or apartment to protect his sister. Castiel’s eyes narrowed about to step forward.“Everyone stop!” Gabriel shouted. “Castiel put the damn knife away! Fenrir step away from the window, you're not running tonight,” Gabriel said as he gripped his hair. “Everyone take a seat,” Gabriel said in a small voice. “Now!” he said when nobody moved. Castiel slowly moved towards the far side of the couch as Fenrir sat down on the opposite side with Sugar in his lap.
“No. But usually…” Castiel trails off.
Dean’s heart stutters and bursts. It’s
only a few human months old.” Dean suddenly grins like it greatly pleases him to be more mature than an ancient being. Cas shakes his head, feeling his lips pull into a small smile, marvelling over how Dean can often make him feel better. He doesn’t deserve such kindness.
“I feel like crap,” He croaks, and realises why Dean won’t really touch him. The action of speaking meant he had to move his face and that was a bad and really painful idea. He reaches carefully to lightly inspect the damage, and Dean’s eyes flicker away briefly, filled with pain.
Castiel slid his arm over Dean, pulled him closer. He glided lower so he could palm the flesh of that wonderful ass, tease the curve of it, dig his nails in faintly. Dean seemed to really like that if the hitch in his breath were any indication, or the way his eyes fluttered shut. Dean’s free hand smoothed over Cas’ chest, swiped a rough thumb over the peak of a nipple which had Castiel almost whimpering, forcing Dean’s other hand to move faster, squeeze tighter, twist on the upturn until they’re both shaking apart. Dean was squeezing their lengths, easing the way with precome until things became deliciously easy.
When Castiel folds his arms faux-huffily, Dean sighs, grinning like a cat that’s got the cream, eyes glinting. “Fine.”
Castiel rubs the back of his neck now, trying to calm down for a moment. “Is he coming back?”
. You’ll be in total control.”
“I know you will.” Cas said.
“Go to my
” It slips out so easily, same as before, though weary and defeated this time. Loving Cas will always be his curse, something he knows he cannot change. Even when it hurts. Which it does most of the time if he’s honest. He knows he will never admit this out loud. Loving someone makes you vulnerable, exposed. Want is far simpler.
His name sounds like a filthy prayer and something in him snaps. He wantonly grinds against Dean then, aiming to make every thrust flawless. They writhe against each other, eye contact only breaking when they close in pleasure. They roll together, fitting perfectly. Castiel’s hand is in Dean’s sweaty hair, the other grips his arm fiercely, digging into muscle. His leg aches where Dean holds it tight at the perfect angle. They’re practically snarling now, pace quickening to a brutal speed, hurling towards the finish line. Nearly violent in its passionate, desperate race for completion. The only sounds are of them panting and the slap of slick flesh. It’s obscene.
“Ahh.” Dean bites his lip and Cas thumbs it from that grip with his free hand, kisses any mark away.
Being human, Castiel is starting to realise, means taking the slow path -
“Leave me.” Castiel tries to make it an order but it sounds like begging. He swallows a lump in his throat that he can’t explain the presence of. Everything in his body tightens when Dean is near, goes haywire. He can’t stand it and yet it makes him feel painfully alive. That’s the problem. Dean makes things even more complicated. He cannot carry Dean’s disappointment and feelings too.
“Whoa Cas. Do you really think that’s a good idea?” Sam had enquired, quite reasonably. A dusty volume of demon lore spread out across the old oak table in front of him. Still on a ‘cure a demon’ kick it seemed.
“But all this is speculation,” Sam added reasonably. He didn’t like that look Dean was wearing. The set jaw, the determined frown. He was getting ready to charge into something. Something rash. “You don’t know that Metatron even still has his grace.”
Warning: Rating will go up. Next chapter pending if anyone's interested. WIP.
His response makes a flicker of a devilish smile appear across Dean’s features. Castiel feels his stolen heart beat faster, now feeling connected to it. Effected by it.
“Oh Cas, oh I can’t…” He groans eyes closing, finally looking away from Castiel’s body.
. “I miss my wings. I miss their voices. I miss the clarity even amongst the chaos…” He struggles to find the right words to go with the emotions. How could Dean ever comprehend what it was like before?
But what can you possibly say? Castiel wonders. They have changed each other forever. Changed their friendship into something else and there’s no going back. That was very animalistic and Cas enjoyed it immensely… but is that something people tell each other?
“Mm’sorry,” He murmurs, stifling a yawn against the warm hollow of Dean’s neck.
“Like a child?” He nearly laughs and feels no bitterness. Did he not just compare himself to an infant earlier?
“Don’t matter. You can buy me a new one.” Dean is beaming down at him, though the smile is strained. His hand is pressing down on the worst of the knife wounds, to stop the bleeding. It hurts but he feels strangely at peace. Dean cards his fingers softly though Cas’ hair, the only part of him that’s safe to touch.
Deep down, there’s a part of him that thinks Castiel wouldn‘t be here with him if he still had his wings.
Cas begins to look confused. He opens his mouth, then closes it again, licking those full, shapely lips nervously. So close. Dean catches the movement and his fevered mind snaps.
Castiel was straddling Dean. That way, he could feel in control. And it was working. It was really working. Dean was spread out beneath him like an offering, all golden skin, lightly panting and slick with sweat. But then Castiel’s ribs had started aching, that deep familiar burn. Then his legs had turned to jelly once more - nerves flaring and trembling painfully. And all those nerves in his wrists had stated jumping around like hot coals yet again, twisting and throbbing. He just wasn’t as physically strong as he once was, even with the physical therapy in the gym (hospital cost too much and Sam had researched the subject). It was helping him get stronger, but not fast enough.
As if Dean wanted to keep him safe.
It’s desperate, instinctive. He buries his face in the warmth of Cas’s throat and stays there. He can feel Cas’s heart race and doesn’t know how it is so. It would seem that both of their hearts continue to beat after death.
Castiel knows they have nothing to be ashamed of and is happy if it means they can be more open around Sam. How can that be a bad thing? Some of the most appalling, shameful moments of his existence have stemmed from dishonesty where the Winchester’s are concerned. This new life is a clean slate, a chance to be truthful, to not let them down again. He wants to spend it with Dean if he will have him. And with Sam of course. There’s no separating the two, even if he wanted to. Sam is good. Sam is kind. He won’t be angry with them. He’ll see sense.
Dean drums his fingers against the table top almost nervously as they wait for their bacon cheeseburgers with extra fries. A few minutes of this tense silence has Castiel snapping at his friend in no time.
Dean is fiddling with Cas’ jeans then, hands shaking. He is far less graceful wriggling out of them than Dean was. Dean sighs as Cas lets go of his cock, hand sliding over the thick weight so they can break apart and shed more layers. He kicks his jeans away as if they have insulted him and ends up laughing with Dean, smothering their amusement with more deep kisses.
“Now I’m not one for pep talks mostly because they suck.” Dean cuts over him. “But you were tricked Cas. Tricked. You had something forcibly ripped from you by the ultimate douche with a stupid Transformer name. And you
“What?” Dean repeats sounding less dazed now. “Jesus, look I’m sorry if I-“
It’s Castiel. Of course it is. He felt It. Wearing a tan trench coat over a black suit, sloppily knotted tie and hair all askew. He cuts a less imposing figure this time. His posture less rigid and eyes sparkling with emotion. There is something slightly sheepish about his expression, yet his shoulders remain set and determined as he stands tall, striding towards Dean.
“You mean…?”
When Dean spoke, it travelled right down his spine, rough, low and completely unexpected in it’s sensuality. “How’s this for a deal? When you get better - when, not if ‘cause I know you will - you can have me any way you want me.”
The kiss deepens. He can taste nothing but Dean. Can feel his hand on his neck, an anchor in this dreamlike moment. He feels hot. Too hot, clothes constricting. He wants to do something reckless and settles for running a hand down Dean’s back until it can slip under the fabric of his shirt, grasping the smooth, hot skin of his waistline, causing the hunter to gasp.
This embrace is slow, leisurely. They never usually get to have this. It’s always a rush to the finish line. A mess of limbs, teeth, desperate grabbing hands and sweaty bodies pressed tightly together. Not this. Closed eyes, just enjoying the sensation of being close, being kissed so deeply. Sharing breath and trading touches.
“Can we go now?” He asks icily.
But Castiel
“And insulting me is a good way to get it?”
“Your children have caused a mess, it is up to Dean and Sam to decide Gabriel. They are potential threats to the human race.” Castiel replies and walks closer to the trio. He didn’t want to fight, especially if it was family, but he will if he has to.
Dean wasn't paying attention to the other fights happening around him as both angels attacked at once. He ducked as the first angel made a swooping cut for his head.
"Sugar, no honey we don't know her," Gabriel said quietly trying to pull Sugar back and away from the unknown nephilim. Sugar glared at her dad before pulling away and attached herself to the legs of Seraphina.
Of all kids, Sugar could argue with it had to be Fenrir. Gabriel rubbed his forehead unsure if angels could get headaches. Composing himself Gabriel stuck a smile on his face ready to face his children.
Dean looked down rubbing his eyes, “Son of a bitch” quietly, when he looked up again everyone was still looking at him. He glared at those in the room before stalking off to the infirmary.
“Don’t tell me?” Gabe asked laughing looking at Dean and over to where the twins and Sam went.
“Hello Jovi,” Castiel said this voice softening slightly. “This is my son, Jack, and daughter, Seraphina.” Castiel looked at each child as he said their name before smiling at the pair in front of him.
Smirking Gabriel teased his brother, “I didn’t know you had it in you Cassie! Who was the lucky lady?” the question of which he wasn’t expecting the answer they got.
“Hey, we made it, come on kid,” Dean grabbed her elbow and lead her out of the impala making sure that she didn’t hit her head against the impala top. “Cas can you grab the bags?” Dean asked as he directed Seraphina into the bunker. Castiel watched his family walk towards the door a smile on his face as he walked towards the trunk to grab the bags.
Looking over Dean noticed Cas fiddling with his tie, “Come here,” Dean said softly. Helping Cas tye his tie reminded Dean of when he helped Sam when he was younger. Dean smiled as he finished and straightened the tie one last time. Slipping on their coats the men went out to their car getting ready for the day.
“Take one good look! Castiel is my mom.”
Jack walked in half-asleep the noise not seeming to bother him. He reached the nephilim and held his hands out, growing gold Jack unlocked the handcuffs around his cousin's wrists. Jack undisturbed that he just allowed Seraphina to use her powers he reached down and pulled Sugar off of Seraphina's legs and stuck her in Seraphina's still outstretched arms.
"Language," Castiel chastised glancing at his daughter as he leaned against the wall.
Dean was about to set the remote down when he heard a knock on the door. Looking up, Dean became cautious, Cas would have just opened the door with his key, if it was the police they would have banged on the door before stating themselves. Grabbing his gun Dean got up slowly cocking his gun before opening the door a crack. Looking out he saw the girl, she held out her hands, the cuffs jingling around her wrists.
"Wait, which we are you talking about because I only came to get these fucking cuffs off," Seraphina argued jangling the cuffs on her for emphasis.
Dean grabs his gun from the truck and runs to the room, taking the stairs to get up there faster. He quickly breaks the door down and runs in. “Cas! What the hell is going on?” He says, pointing his gun at the group. “Also Gabriel really? After we trusted you, you do this? Did the man kidnap the kid? Hand her over to us.”
Dean aims the gun at Fenrir, glaring at the obvious non-human. “I don’t know who you are but you’re still just another bastard that I can kill. Try me bitch.” He says and cocks his gun, obviously ready to shoot.
Sam glanced over at the kids. “How have you been able to protect them?” Sam questioned scanning the room.
Cas nodded his head and got into the Impala. “Yes, the positions of the body and the eyes make me think it was an accident. I need to go to the warehouse and see the scene to make sure.” He told him and took Dean’s hand gently.
Dean glares at Gabriel, intending to not listen to the archangel until the tall man starts growling at him. As Dean lowers his weapon he looks at Cas. “Hey, you okay?” Dean asks in a soft voice making sure his best friend was good before they started kicking ass again.
Gabriel smiles, putting on his charm to try and get the others to forget about their theories no matter if they were almost true. “Come on! I promised Sammy over here that I would not be doing any huge pranks like that ever again! Archangel’s honor!”
Cas had pulled out of Dean, which was followed by pure resistance, twisting Dean around to face him. He grabbed hold of Dean’s thighs, pushing his legs up so Dean was resting against the car and that was it. Cas pushed back inside of Dean, gripping his thighs tight as he fucked into him. He watched Dean’s mouth form an O shape, watched his eyes roll into the back of his head as he was used. “Cas, holy fuck, god shit fuck, Cas!!”
This irritated Cas, making his blood boil once again in only a few days.
The next morning was hell. 35 years old and he still wasn’t used to the hardcore hangovers after a night out. Cas downed two bottles of water and two aspirin, dragging his lifeless body into the bathroom to get ready for work. After the marines, Cas had immediately went to college to become a Professor. He needed quiet in his life, after years of battle and war running through his mind, he needed some calm. What better than to become an English Professor for Kansas State University? He liked books and understood enough of it to qualify, so why not? So he studied hard and became one!
“Took me long enough to give in.” He managed to say, his fingers drawing soft patterns into Dean’s side.
Cas snapped. He sat the cup down, turning to the man. He threw the man toward a wall, the two punching  each other until his hand gripped tight around Roy’s throat, holding him against the wall and pushing him up by his neck. “I am Colonel Castiel Novak a Scout Sniper for the United States Marine Corps.  I’ve toured Iraq and Afghanistan twice each in four years. I’ve killed enemies, terrorists, and more men than there is in this town. Just because I like men doesn’t mean I’m less than a man than you are. So how about you shut the fuck up for once in your miserable life Roy.” Cas growled, throwing him to the ground after. He watched as people cowered from him, as people started to realize that Castiel had truly grown up from such a sweet and kind kid into an independent force of nature. Castiel paid for his drinks, apologizing for the mess to Ellen before rushing away.
“Dean was at Purgatory last night, with Lisa.” Cas muttered to his friend as they walked down the halls to their offices, thankful that their offices are next to each other an connected right into their separate classrooms.
“Damnit Cas, why did you tell them?” Dean had spoke, and that’s here Cas smelt it. Dean smelt like bourbon, like he just came from a bar.
“Cas? What the hell are you talking about?” Dean didn’t understand, Dean never replaced Cas, in fact he’s never dated anyone after Castiel. Sure he’s had a few hookups here and there, but no one he’d ever had a real conversation with, no one who could hold and kiss Dean like Cas did.
The ride to the school was uneventful,  if you don’t count the idiot who almost ran into Cas’ truck.. twice. When he pulled into the college parking lot, he immediately groaned. He could already smell the leftovers of last night’s frat party on most of the students, the crappy beer,  the shitty weed, the smell of a two day long hangover deep in the air. Cas ignored the smell as best as he could as he walked to his office, nodding his head to students who greeted him. He did stop and say hi to his colleague and closest friend Charlie Bradbury, who taught the Computer Science course. Charlie had been his best friend since High School, she understood Cas and was the only person to beg him not to leave for the military, who begged him to come home at every chance. Charlie was the one to pick him up when he did come  home, Charlie was a great friend, someone he could trust always.
Cas looked down, the hair on the back of his neck standing tall as Dean got closer, goosebumps formed all up and down his arms. Dean had this certain effect  over Cas, even before they met and became close. It was like all Cas had to do was look at Dean and he’d feel the sparks in the air, feel the magnetic pull he and Dean had. “Nothing I didn’t deserve.”
“F-fuck, Officer Novak.” Dean cried out, clenching around Castiel’s huge cock. “So big..”
“Officer Cassieeeee,” Gabriel’s voice came through the walkie talkie attached to Castiel’s shoulder while he relaxed in his car drinking actually good coffee. “Your not so secret admirer just got caught shoplifting at Jo’s Convenience Store.”
Dean’s eyes looked like a green gemstone, the tears in his eyes glossing them over until they looked like real life gemstones.
Dean moved closer and was about to start yelling, about to start screaming that Cas was stupid if he thought he could take on a group of homophobic rednecks with guns, but that’s when he saw it. That’s when Dean saw the scars on Cas’ hips, saw scars peaking from his back. Cas was scarred up almost head to toe. “Holy shit, Cas.” Dean whispered, walking closer. He ghosted his finger over one of the worst scars on Cas’s chest, it was long and looked the newest. “Cas, what did they do to you over there?”
“Castiel, what in the name of all things holy made you think that?” Dean asked, already so close to Cas once more.
