alluring that John could barely have stopped himself sliding down his lover's body and hooking his fingers into his loincloth.
. What is different about the way I rule than the way Mycroft would? The whole thing is bread and circuses."
were the Emperor and someone were speaking to him like that, even someone he loved, he would have thrown them to the gladiators in the Circus. He forced himself to smile and toss the fabric over his shoulder with an affectation of carelessness. "Fortunately for you, I enjoy the sound of your voice and I want you to watch me."
John smiled and slipped between the sheets, holding still as Sherlock captured his body in his own limbs and rubbed his curly hair against the arenarius' shoulder, insinuating his strong arms around the Emperor's chest and linking his fingers.
"The docks, John, the docks!" Sherlock shouted, ignoring the second question as obvious. "Small is making a break for it, there is no time to waste!"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "He has an interest in the human anatomy. He sought the knowledge he has on his own terms, not through his profession. He saved lives at Ctesiphon."
Slowly, Claudia Morstan sat down. John leaned forwards. "I am here because my friend has been helping me to discover who it was that ended Mary's life," he said, in a soft and even voice that Sherlock envied. If he could speak like that, of
By the next time Sherlock paused for longer than a glance in each direction at a corner – before making a small noise and taking off in one direction or the other – John's torch had burned so low that it was flickering and gutting, making their shadows leap like assassins against the walls. He held it up to light the Emperor's face as Sherlock Holmes stopped in the middle of a secluded back-street. Without knowing why they had stopped, John could not prevent his mind from pointing out how perfect a spot this was for a murder.
Flattered, even, that Lestrade believed he could do this. "The first time I saw you fight you caught my attention immediately," he tried again. "The thing that attracts me to the arena, you see, is the subtlety in the mechanics of fighting. There is always a moment, with each gladiator – well, you know this, obviously – where you can read in their body exactly what move they are planning, minute twitches that show exactly when they will execute it. Despite the fact that it was your first appearance as an arenarius, you could already read your opponents' bodies as well as anyone I had ever seen. To have that skill as
Lestrade smiled at him as he approached, lowering the sword to point harmlessly at the ground. John smiled back.
The taller man did not breathe until John was fully within him, and it was his frantic exhale that made John remember that he had not breathed either. Sherlock gripped him tighter than he had ever felt before, and he had to close his hands on either side of Sherlock's tied ones until his knuckles went white to regain a semblance of control.
John clenched his fists to curb the overpowering urge to strangle the man and instead dropped into his chosen language. "You have killed two people who did nothing wrong," he replied coolly.
"Perhaps," Lestrade acknowledged, smiling at him. "But I... this may be... should he request that you share his bed, or anything similar that you are not entirely comfortable with, I strongly urge you to turn him down unless you are absolutely sure, however good your intentions may be." The lanista smiled sadly at John's utterly bewildered look. "You might hurt him."
You have perfect lips, have I told you that before? Lush and sculpted into a perfect recurve like Cupid's golden bow. They feel exquisite against mine, shifting and parting to let me claim your beautiful mouth as my own. You squirm your body underneath me, trying to shift your hands from where I am pinning them against the wall. I feel as though I should let you move, but I cannot think of anything but the feel of your mouth, fiery and all-consuming.
Sherlock smiled at him. "We shall see when we get to Sholto's house whether he will be necessary," he replied. "If not, Quintus here will remove him for us."
John understood perfectly what he needed, and so he thrust his hips forward sharply, making Sherlock yelp and clatter the bar above the bed against the wall. As he rested there, fully seated inside the gloriously tight warmth, Sherlock let out his breath on an abandoned moan. "John –"
Sherlock thought for a moment about her question before answering, "Because it is what John wants. And I believe he deserves to get that."
Nodding, the two men and the dog padded quietly out of the alleyway. Sherlock looked down at John, who was looking up at him already, his face split into his delightfully endearing smile. "I thought we would never be alone," he said quietly, reaching a hand up. Sherlock leaned into the warm touch as John's calloused fingers caressed his face.
John screamed. Pain seared through his leg and he almost fell, the muscles twitching and spasming. Tonga's deep laugh rang in his ears as he staggered; he was showing the man his back, he couldn't stand up properly, couldn't turn around, couldn't do anything to protect himself. He didn't want to
win it, he was easily the best gladiator in the arena – he would apologise properly and everything would be all right. He bowed, the customary gesture, and then they took their positions to begin the fight.
, John," Sherlock interrupted, not sure he liked the way John was describing him. Mind-reading sounded terribly invasive.
And then Sherlock was gone. His hips thrust forward sharply, completely beyond his control, and even his toes tingled with sensation. He'd been inside people before - women mostly, but there had been the occasional young man and nothing had
Sherlock smiled so hard his cheeks burned with the effort. "I love you, too," he said. He wanted to find a way to convey the
John quickly rolled them over so that he sat astride Sherlock's soft belly. While the younger man was still blinking in surprise, he reached down and grasped his own arousal.
Sherlock jumped at the sound of John's voice, slipping his legs off the windowsill and arranging his toga more presentably over his legs. "Watson," he greeted, noticing a small smile as it came across the dimachaerus and realising he'd said much the same thing the night before. "Forgive me, I… my mind was elsewhere."
Sherlock shook off the fantasy before the situation in his loincloth became irrecoverable and levelled smug eyes at Mycroft again. This time, to his delight, the taller man's sneer faltered and his eyes darted nervously around the arena as though searching for someone specific. Sherlock narrowed his own; Mycroft had better not have been looking for
Sherlock kissed him sweetly and then rested their heads together. He suddenly felt immensely sleepy. "We must return to the court," he murmured. "It would not do to arrive later than Lestrade and Angelo when they had to stop at the Circus and we did not."
John chuckled. "Are you certain that you will be able to stand this?" he asked, lifting his head and resting it on the bump of Sherlock's thigh. "Once your hands are tied, if I wish to do this slowly you cannot encourage me to do otherwise."
Lestrade looked from one to the other; Angelo simply smirked and looked away. "Right," he said. "Well, the other gladiators are at lunch, so if you are finished, my Lord…"
When he was done, the older man stepped forwards and collected the fragments of his clothing from the ends of the bed. Sherlock frowned. "You are not staying?"
He considered it for the barest of seconds. "This room is my sanctuary. I would like it to be yours, too." He ran his fingers over John's scalp, feeling his hair part under them.
"Forgive an old soldier for lagging behind a little, my Lord," he lied as he got there, the Emperor pushing nonchalantly off the wall with his grey eyes dancing.
"All right," Lestrade barked as they assembled around him. John's eyes were still on Sherlock; the silver-haired lanista snapped his fingers in front of his face irritably. "John, over here."
Sherlock melted. He was barely aware of his knees buckling until the hand at his waist tightened and John quickly changed his stance to support both their weights; as the other man's mouth started to leave his he tried to chase it back before he quite registered the position he was in. John calmly propped him back on his feet. "Are you all right, my - Sherlock?"
as though he were about to have John punished for disobeying him. "I am sorry," John said anyway, when the tension of the silence grew too heavy to maintain.
The Emperor's eyes widened as John again began twisting the fabric of his loincloth between his hands. "You are going to bind my hands – with your loincloth?" he said, his voice quivering with something that John hoped was arousal and not disgust.
Angelo cleared his throat. "If someone is going to be killing someone, I believe I have the right to a rudimentary explanation of what's going on." He shrugged apologetically when Sherlock looked his way.
Sherlock blinked. The gladiator watched him, his face carefully blank, but he thought he could almost catch a trace of nerves, of a longing for approval, in those blue-green eyes. He smiled slowly. "Would you
. His lover smelled of sweat and musk and his hand was slick with Sherlock's own wetness to ease his quick, firm strokes until they were positively incandescent.
" There were so many reasons he could not that he could barely imagine doing as he was asked. What Sherlock was asking no man could endure without becoming
John barely had any time to settle before he was summoned out to the court arena, the noon bell ringing in his ears. He was surprised to find when he arrived that the arena was empty but for Lestrade, standing in the middle of the sand and twisting a sword around in one hand. The arena itself was smaller than he expected, too, the stone tiers of the stands only three rows high. He wondered how many people were expected to watch.
" Small screamed at his companion, hobbling back to the sails to direct them into the wind while the black fighter took up oars and began to haul them away.
"Dunno," Wiggins replied, shrugging again. "Most like still at Mrs Hudson's. She likes to check up on us when we visit, you know."
The two fighters watched in silence as the tall Emperor strode away across the sand. "What was that?" John asked finally, when the iron grate door had creaked shut behind him.
Sherlock actually rolled his eyes. "I hardly think Jonathan Small and whatever accomplices he has managed to gain himself will dare an attempt to penetrate
." Sherlock smiled resignedly. When they had first met, John had seemed so dependent on his love for Mary. It had been the driving force behind everything that he did: it was why he had joined the gladiators, why he respected Sherlock, why he had agreed to come into his bed and stay there indefinitely. Surely there must have been some revelation, something Sherlock had done to make him stray so far from that path as to fall in love with someone else.
And there was Sherlock, sitting on the platform reserved for the Emperor and his party. John looked up at him, his swords held carefully point-downwards in the traditional mark of respect, and Sherlock smiled hesitantly at him, as though afraid John would not meet his eyes.
The barbarian spat at his feet. "I have done nothing I have cause to be ashamed of," he said in sullen, broken Greek.
John made to remove himself from Sherlock's arms, but the Emperor clutched him tighter and turned his head away again. "I am
Holmes offered him a brief sympathetic smile before turning back to the stain. "And they did not clean anything away? No attempt was made to remove this stain?"
Sherlock smiled at him, looking up to see Lestrade frowning at the boy and beckoning John and his burly sparring partner over. "I would not be so sure," he replied smugly. "I find it helps to have something to
"You are doing fine," John said, grinning and pulling their mouths together again. Sherlock grinned back, his wandering finger finding its destination as he struggled to hold everything together and not fly apart into a million sparkling pieces more brilliant than the stars. "In fact, you are -
, naked and unabashed without even the expectation of sex, was perhaps more intimate than what they had just done. Though not quite as satisfying or pleasurable.
"My Lord," the lanista greeted when they were close enough. "John, I am afraid I have some alarming news." John reflexively clutched Sherlock's hand tighter, raising his eyebrows questioningly. "They have found Bartholomew Sholto."
He thought he may be making noise, but it wasn't important and it wasn't as though he would be able to stop anyway. The most he could do against the earth-shattering wave of pleasure that felt as though it was ripping apart his very insides was tug uselessly at John's shoulder to warn him right before his mind exploded into bliss.
And then he had cradled her, and kissed her, and wept and screamed until someone who cared less had separated them.
kind of detail. "And he worked out the thing that I wanted most and offered it to me in return, so that I could not refuse him."
Sherlock stretched indolently. "I am fine," he shouted back, turning his head towards the door so as not to shout in John's ear. "I apologise for disturbing you. Go back to your posts."
"I would try not to mention that to him, my Lord," Lestrade advised. Sherlock gave him another half-smile. "Personally I do not think either of you stand a chance."
And then they were gone, and Sherlock was alone with John amid the hustle and bustle of the docks. His first impulse was to throw himself on the shorter man and hold him as tightly as he could until John protested that he could not breathe, but he held back. The case was over now; he had no right to ask or expect John to react positively to his romantic attention.
that way, or pinned down, rather than simply because he could sense it was what his lover wanted. Sherlock's entire body shuddered with arousal.
As the man fell and the others stepped away, Sherlock saw that Watson had neatly disabled the man by severing the tendons above his kneecaps. Lestrade whistled appreciatively. Sherlock frowned; had he done that on purpose, or was that sheer bloody luck?
John pulled him into a tight hug. Sherlock clutched as his back, blinking tears away from his eyes. "I am all right," the gladiator murmured into his ear. "It is over now, everything is all right."
The big man gave what might have been a shrug, even though his hands were bound. "Sholto was a soldier. A murderer in war."
since he and John had spent time together, and Sherlock could almost feel the individual cells in his body straining towards the shorter man. He only wanted to stand for a while with John in his arms, that snub nose pressed against his collarbone; he'd dreamt of the way the gladiator had felt against his chest, safe and warm, somehow protective and protected at the same time.
to answer his questions if they were going to hurt her. "Please get up. I am here as a friend, not an Emperor."
John Watson was easy enough to spot; his lack of a shield made him stand out among the others. Anderson, too, he picked straight away, slinking at the back of the group with his large round shield held up around his face.
The slave stepped between his legs, trident raised like a hunter poised to spear a fish, savage triumph gleaming black in his eyes. John turned his head to look up at the stands – at
him the way he wanted him to, but there wasn't one, so he squeezed John until his arms ached and thought from the way John was squeezing him back that perhaps it was enough.
John did not laugh; he smiled for a moment, and then frowned as though having second thoughts about Mrs Morstan's reaction. "I believe that would be the case, were her daughter still living," he said slowly. "But if you are worried, we do not have to tell her that we are lovers."
John dropped respectfully back to one knee in front of the Emperor as he approached; Sherlock Holmes lifted a facetious eyebrow at Lestrade before rolling his eyes at the prostrate gladiator. "Oh, Jupiter," he said dryly. "Get up." John hastily recovered his footing, keeping his eyes averted. "John Watson, is it?"
John had almost expected another reprimand for his desire to face Tonga fairly, so the unexpected answer made him smile in surprise. "I suppose. There will be other things I can direct my attention to."
of John, and to have John take care of him. All the same, it was difficult to ignore the rush of blood to his extremities.
John took a deeper breath, and Sherlock thought he could feel him smiling. "Sherlock," he began gently.
The new lanista laughed, and Sherlock felt his heart would burst. "Come," John said brightly, kissing him again and clambering off him, picking up their two abandoned cups of wine and handing one to Sherlock, holding out his own in a salute. "To us. Until we are so old that we can barely see one another."
John offered him a bright smile. "That is the idea," he replied cheerfully. "I intend to keep the room, and leave the bulk of my equipment to make it easier to train, but the majority of my clothing is coming with me when I leave this afternoon."
Sherlock gave the gladiator a small, wan smile. He wondered whether Angelo had guessed the full extent of his relationship with John, or whether he simply gathered their friendship was something deeper than Sherlock's typical regard for his gladiators. John, too, smiled at his comrade. "Of course. Thank you, Angelo, for everything that you have done."
After a moment, he shifted in exaggerated discomfort and looked up at the taller Holmes. Mycroft was still watching him with an ugly sort of leer; Sherlock leaned back against the edge of the bench and steadily gave his brother a smug, satisfied smile.
The younger man looked at him in surprise. "I…" His pale eyes gazed at John almost suspiciously, as though trying to find a gap in his eager mask. John grinned. "Would it be too much tomorrow? No doubt Lestrade will make you work hard in the morning."
With a tiny smile, Sherlock bent and rummaged in the trunk at the foot of the ginormous bed. Lazily, John slid out of his toga as he watched the supple curve of his lover's back. Then Sherlock came up, still looking tremendously, adorably nervous, clutching tightly in his hands a length of rope.
It certainly did sound appealing. Sherlock shifted against the bars of the cage, resisting the urge to reach down and adjust himself in his loincloth. "Kiss me," he pleaded. "Just kiss me." It wasn't enough, but he could not ask for more – having Lestrade walk in on them would be the most mortifying thing Sherlock could imagine. And what if it wasn't just Lestrade?
"Yes, it is time to get down to the heart of the matter. Shall we?" He gestured back to the desk, and John followed, sitting dumbly in his chair. Mycroft looked at him, his fingers steepled at his mouth for a minute or two--just long enough to be weird--before he spoke.
Five months prior Sherlock had been on top of the world. He had just released his much-anticipated solo album and was riding high on top of a mountain of commercial and critical success. He had gone through so much by that point; the acrimonious split from his old manager, the barely concealed bitterness and jealousy of his ex-band mates, and the seemingly insurmountable expectations placed upon him to become the 'next Justin Timberlake' or next 'Harry Styles'. But he had come out of all that victorious and insanely successful and happy. Or so Mycroft had thought. But looking back at it now, the signs were all there that the slow unraveling of the careful world of Sherlock Holmes had begun shortly after his first album.
At the end of a long hallway, Anthea opened a door and led him into a room that looked like a study; wing back chairs framed a beautiful fireplace, while heavy draperies blocked out any light from the windows, and the carved, floor to ceiling shelves were packed with books calling out to be touched. He could lose himself in here for good day or so, curled up by the fire with a good book and an even better drink.
and does anyone think for one moment I would defile this brilliant brain by snorting, injecting, or otherwise ingesting something more poisonous? I saw the crystal meth rumor. Are you serious?!
They walked silently for about thirty minutes, till they reached a point where John needed a rest. The climb was pretty steep here, and he had to catch his breath and look at the view. The skies were clear today, smog level low, and the city of L.A. spread out before them. He looked over to Sherlock, where he had perched himself on a rock, wanting to say something about the view, and saw Sherlock puffing away on a cigarette.
"I think you might want to come with me Doctor Watson." She said coolly, not at all rattled by his threatening voice. The same voice that had made grown men quake on the battlefield as he barked out orders. She flicked her gaze out the window, and John followed its path to a black sedan idling at the curb, almost obscured by rain that was now pouring down.
The first the noticeable change was the smoking. It wasn't as if Sherlock hadn't been known to bum a ciggie here and there, even so much as stealing them from Mummy when he was a mere child, but he had turned into something of a chain-smoker overnight, even though it was hell on the voice. Suddenly he became moodier, sullen, and snappish, throwing strops the likes of which hadn't been seen since he was a child. Since before he'd found solace in music. Then there was the partying, the endless clubbing and late nights carousing with unseemly characters and hangers on. Bratty behavior, wild nights, and unprofessional public appearances soon had him splashed upon the front page of every trashy tabloid from LA to Tokyo, and late night comedians had sensed the chum in the water at this man child living the life of a debauched rock star. In a matter of months Sherlock had gone from the biggest popstar on the planet to the biggest joke on the planet.
He'd been uncomfortably aware of John's attention on him since their confrontation in the kitchen, and it took all his withering control not to just run away. Or go and kiss him senseless again. Christ, he was a mess. He took a pull of the now lukewarm beer and coughed, whoever brought this swill was officially never invited to another one of his parties again.
That thought aside, Sherlock couldn't help but be intrigued. He wouldn't let his brother know though, and all he did in response was huff even louder.
Mycroft waved a dismissive hand at him. "Oh, this. This is all family money. Me and Sherlock come from a privileged background, and I hardly need to abuse my role as a brotherly figure for monetary gain. This isn't a soap opera. I am the only one looking out for Sherlock's best interests, but he's currently delinquent in his obligations to a major record label, and there are tour contracts that need to be fulfilled, not to mention he's souring his relationships with several important organizations and individuals."
"He's not a brute Sherlock. I would think you know me better than that. He's an intelligent man--quite fascinating really. Ex-military, and a doctor as well. A surgeon."
If you would be so kind as to tell me the reason for your little disappearing act today? John didn't go into it but I was not born yesterday brother mine. I know when something else is going on.
"You know what I mean John. You're reasonably intelligent, I grant you, but you don't know what it's like to have a brain that moves at a speed others don't. That charges ahead of you whether you want it to or not. Full of ideas and emotions and things that are so loud, so insistent, it's overwhelming." Sherlock swallowed; he couldn't look at John, though he desperately wanted to. He didn't want to see a shred of pity in those blue eyes. Or worse, the expression he had seen on so many faces when he was a kid, before he'd found music. The barely disguised disgust of someone who was different. "My parents had me tested when I was younger. I was an unusual child, putting it lightly. In the end, all they found was a kid with genius level intellect and a lot of feelings and no way to express them. And then I found music. Music was my medicine John. It kept me sane, on an even keel, and after I found it I was just like everyone else."
"Tell me Doctor Watson, what do you think of Los Angeles?" The woman asked, her tone bored as she continued typing away. "Do you like sunshine? Beaches?"
"Yea you know, a man or woman you date to hide the fact you're not straight? It's been around since the beginning of time. Nasty business."
Everyone in the biz did cocaine recreationally. It wasn't a big deal. It was only a big deal if you didn't know how to handle it and let it get out of control.
Dinner was takeaway from a place called In and Out Burger, plopped unceremoniously on the table by Mrs. Hudson, and John moaned with pleasure around something called a "double double" while Sherlock gave him an odd look and blinked a great deal.
"Sherlock, we just got the walls fixed and look what you go and do! I don't know how Mycroft keeps the cops from showing up at your door but one day you're going to need them and they won't come!"
There was an affronted scoff from the other line, but the feeling of the conversation had shifted to something lighter. "Regardless of what the tabloids are reporting I was not arrested. I was simply detained in the so called 'drunk tank' alongside the more colorful characters of Los Angeles, until I sobered up. I made friends with a homeless drunkard named Barry and a belligerent drag queen named Coco Bang Bang."
"Right." John stepped away from the display and began drumming his fingers against his thigh, restless. What the hell did Mycroft even want with him? Pop music? This was not exactly James Bond. It was more James Taylor. Ok, not the best comparison, but he was a good thirty to forty years behind when it came to music. "Look, I'm not familiar with your brother, and even less with current music, and this is all nice and stuff but, what does any of this have to do with me and my so called talents?"
"Mrs. Hudson dear." She said, pulling the car out of the congested arrivals area and moving into traffic. All around them L.A beckoned to be taken in, but John couldn't stop staring at the strange woman across from him. "And you can call me Mrs. Hudson, if you don't mind. It may be old fashioned but I feel I've earned at least a little formality. I've waited all these years for the so called respect that comes with a life long lived, but all I've gotten for my trouble is a bum hip, so they can sod right off with that nonsense!" She tittered, eyes glued to the road. "Thank God California is a medical marijuana state."
On top of an overturned wooden crate sat a record player, and there were at least four crates surrounding that one, each overflowing with vinyl. Anything that couldn't fit into the crates was piled into stacks that leaned up against the wall or the leg of the piano. It was a beautiful sight. Even though vinyl records had made somewhat of a resurgence in the past few years, especially among music purists and so-called hipsters, it was still a rare sight to see, especially in the house of someone so young.
“According to their reliable testimony, Johann is being pressed to purchase and sell Threadcap smuggled liquor,” Holmes said. “Johann, so far, has refused.”
“We are expecting a client, Watson,” he says, eyes bright. “He’s returned to London three weeks ahead of schedule, and he wants to meet us tonight.”
“Sometimes, it does,” I teased, and Holmes hummed to concede the point. Grinning with no little affection, my insistence dissolved beneath the happiness which welled in me at seeing him in such spirits. As if sensing I had given up my needling, Holmes smirked in victory. Eyes scanning me, he abruptly moved to reach across the space of the cab, hands outstretched and leather palms up.
“It appears our schedule may be booked,” Holmes observed, lip a subtle curl over his teacup, and the two of us turned to face the apartment door as someone joined Mrs. Hudson up the stairs.
“Watson,” Holmes whispered, tilting into my touch. “My dear fellow, I am alright. Please. Do not be frightened.”
Overall, he wasn't usually the type that John went for, but damn if this wasn't doing it for him. Good to see his libido was still hanging in there. Nonetheless, he would have to nip this in the bud. To be ogling Sherlock like this was highly unprofessional.
He looked so smug. The bastard. "Argh, you are impossible!" Sherlock ran a hand through his hair, wanting to pull at his curls in frustration. "I don't need some babysitter! I don't want a thick skulled, low IQ meathead trailing after me, keeping tabs on my every move! I already have you for that!"
The television clicked on, flooding the dark room with light and sound. Mycroft sank back into the leather arm chair with a grimace on his weary face, steadying himself mentally as the theme song he knew all too well began to play. He took a pull of the amber liquid in his crystal tumbler, needing the warm oblivion of alcohol more than ever. Considering the situation at hand though, it was quite ironic to be drowning his sorrows in booze, seeing as how it was the cause of such sorrows. He had gotten word of the incident only a few hours ago, mercifully given a slight window of time to process and plan for the fall out, and he had used those few hours wisely. A few phone calls and emails had been sent, warning those in the 'need to know' camp that a storm was brewing and to prepare. At the rate things were going lately he was going to get an ulcer.
Mycroft groaned and turned off the television before he was tempted to throw his glass straight into the screen. His mobile chimed and he looked down to see it filled with a whole list of twitter alerts from the litany of entertainment accounts he was forced to follow. Usually he would leave the monitoring of such things to Sherlock's publicist, but as of late, he found it was sometimes the only way to have any idea what antics Sherlock was up to. His little brother was often incommunicado, and L.A.--unlike London--was sadly devoid of CCTV and its helpful snooping applications.
"Ah, yea. Thanks." She looked back in the direction Sherlock had run. "He'll probably be in there for a while. It's not the first time he's done this." She hopped up on an empty stool next to him.
"So needlessly dramatic, brother mine." Mycroft sighed. "While your attempts to 'stick it to the man' as you like to call it are... amusing... they are also not realistic. So far, they have been more than patient, but you do not want the full brunt of their legal team on you."
Mrs. Hudson took pity on him and continued. "I was up at five this morning to go with Mrs. Turner to the farmer's market, and his bedroom door was wide open and he wasn't in, and I haven't seen him since dear. But I'm sure he'll be around sooner or later, you know how he is."
"And are you one of those people who rely on him for your," John took in his opulent surroundings. "Livelihood?" Mycroft, for all his seemingly good intentions, wouldn't be the first family member to ride the coattails of a famous sibling.
While all of the group's members, Sebastian Moran, Sebastian Wilkes and Jim Moriarty, were talented in their own rights, each co-writing and playing instruments on most of the tracks, it was their youngest member, Sherlock Holmes, who would come to outshine them all. With his stunning voice and movie star good looks, Sherlock rose to be 'the face' of Deduction, spurring rumors of tension and infighting that ultimately added to the demise of the group.
The voice over started up again, and the show cut back to yet more mobile footage, obviously taken a few minutes earlier, as the brawler in question, barely visible in the crowd of late night revelers who were spilled out in front of what looked like a night club, waved his arms wildly at someone off camera.
"You're a wounded war veteran with a penchant for danger and a severe lack of excitement in your life is currently sucking your soul dry, would you say that's accurate?" He didn't leave time to respond before he plowed on. "You need more in your life. More, so that the firearm that you aren't supposed to have and no one knows about, doesn't find its way into your mouth some night. No, you need a challenge in life, and Sherlock is the biggest challenge of them all."
To his utter surprise, she sat down across from him, and shot him a dazzling smile. "I've been watching you for a while now. You looked rather cross and I was a bit nervous to approach you but, I saw you were about to leave and I knew I couldn't miss my chance." She bit her lip, an overtly flirtatious move, and John felt a heat swell across his cheeks. This was really happening, wasn't it? Maybe it was no coincidence that his libido had returned mere days before he got pulled by one of the prettiest women he'd ever met.
He tore his eyes away from the wall where he had briefly zoned out for a moment, and turned his attention back to the computer and began typing as quickly as his two finger hen-pecking would allow. He had a stack of open encounters to close, ones that had been sitting unsigned since the beginning of the month, and the chairman of the department had been on a rampage lately, threatening bodily harm if their documentation wasn't in, and any open charts weren't closed by the end of the month. Chipping away at his backlog had taken up most of his afternoon, and the thrill of documenting every incidence of tonsillitis, stomach pain, or cutaneous abscess he'd treated had started to lose it's magic.
He threw the covers back and got out of bed stiffly, working through his morning routine as slow as possible, before he was physically and mentally ready to face whatever he had coming. But the downstairs was quiet, only Mrs. Hudson was there, sipping tea and reading while curled up in the breakfast nook, and she gave him a knowing look as he walked into the room.
They walked down a hallway to one of several studios, and John watched from the sidelines as two men, late twenties, artsy types, and a woman who couldn't be more than twenty, with wild red hair piled on top of her head and a sleeve full of tattoos, greeted him. Another man, dressed in black, slightly paunchy and with a full beard, came in and Sherlock gravitated towards him, getting into a deep discussion as the man sat behind the mixing board and began fiddling with an endless array of knobs.
"I'd hardly call it a bearding situation Henry. It's not like I hired Taylor Swift or something." He snorted. "If Jeanine is running stories about me shagging the Queen of England, then who cares? I don't comment on my personal life anyways and it's not as I haven't been branded straight from the beginning. Compulsory heterosexuality, straight until proven gay. I don't see a difference."
"Sherlock always had a bright mind and an immense gift for music. But just like a lot of the greats, he's also plagued with a darkness inside. Unfortunately, he's not equipped to deal with the darkness, and this is what happens. I always suspected this weakness of his would end with his downfall. I've told everyone I know to watch out for that one. He's brilliant, for sure, but he's also weak, and one day he will surely join the '27 club'. Looks like I was a little bit early on that by a few years, eh (laughs)?"
"My brother has been having some troubles lately." Mycroft continued. "He's incredibly successful, but one often finds that with incredible success comes a mountain of...distractions. He's currently too distracted for his own good, and he's in need of someone to be there with him, 24-7, as a sort of moral compass if you will. To make sure he's spending his time.... productively."
"Well, Geddy Lee has a fascinating voice. I appreciate artists with unique talent and who are different." Sherlock's brow wrinkled. "You're not that much older than me, and you know them."
Sherlock was beyond frustrated. The weeks passed, the studio sessions came and went, and John continued to follow him around like a puppy, keeping him from partying, or otherwise getting sidetracked. This had resulted in a noticeable downtick in negative press, which would have been good had Sherlock actually cared about things like that. Mycroft seemed pleased though, and a happy Mycroft was a less annoying Mycroft, so perhaps John as his shadow wasn't completely without its merits.
"Oh, no way! McMillian is here?!" The walking, talking cowboy said in disbelief. "That bastard, I can't believe he came!" He shouted and brushed past John without a glance, which seemed to be the normal reaction to his presence. Apparently, John wasn't even worth a first glance among this group of impossibly beautiful, and impossibly young people. The man continued out to the backyard, followed by a pretty girl with mocha skin and wild curls, and Sherlock made a move to follow as well, attempting to completely ignore John's presence.
"Afghanistan." Sherlock said quietly. It wasn't a question. He looked up and resumed watching John; his jaw was set and his eyes had a sadness around them. He simply nodded.
"I, uh, feel like we should hug or something. Should we hug?" John looked awkward now, and it was adorable. He sat up and scratched at the back of his neck. Apparently, they were both drunk enough for not only heartfelt late-night chats but physical affection.
Sally gave him a scrutinizing look, like she was trying to read all his secrets. He'd been told all his life that everything was readable on his face, so he looked away, pretending to watch the crowd. He debated telling her what happened, that Sherlock had kissed him and it ended badly, but decided she didn't really need to know.
John giggled and waved his hand in the air as he disappeared down the hallway. "Too true. Too true. God, I am bloody starving!"
"I saw it. It's all over you." Sherlock perched himself on the back of the couch, letting his feet dangle. "I find it easy to read people, they give off so many clues. In this business, you must be able to read people or else you will get screwed. Walked all over. Music is just one of the methods I employ. It's incredibly personal and the perfect window into so many things--age, socioeconomic status, skeletons in the closet, deepest desires, so on and so forth. Music is... everything."
The man didn't seem to care much who John was and continued blustering on; he spoke at length about his duties at the label and all the hits he had been responsible for. John tuned him out after a few minutes, and when Sherlock made eye contact with him again, his brow furrowing, John subtly tilted his head in Anderson's direction and made a big show of rolling his eyes, which seemed to amuse Sherlock, and he cracked a beautiful smile.
That got her attention, and she had sent a short reply, saying "I will miss you Johnny" and "let me know you got there safe" but that was about it. It was more than he'd expected, honestly.
"Hello there, and you must be John." She exclaimed, her accent saying born and bred in London. Did the Holmes brothers associate exclusively with Brits? "Oh, well of course you're John. It's not like I go around letting strange men into my car willy nilly." She looked thoughtful for a second. "At least not anymore. But the seventies were a different time, you know? People were much freer about such things then. Well, you understand." She patted his shoulder in a motherly way, leaving him a bit at a loss for words.
John slowed to a stop at a red light, his fingers drumming anxiously against the wheel. "Thanks Mycroft."
u r washed up u thought u would be the break out star from deduction but Jim is coming with new music that will burn the heart out of your career bye
'Somebody Else' by the 1975 is one of my favorite songs and I had to sneak it in somewhere. And yes John it DOES sound like eighties music!
Six hours into the eleven hour flight was when he started to get a bit restless. The realization of where he was headed, and what he was off to do, hit him like a brick wall, and suddenly that meal wasn't sitting so well in his stomach. He'd been so busy the past month, tying up loose ends and such, that he'd unfortunately let one rather big loose end go. He took out his phone, grateful for inflight wifi, and brought up the search browser, typing in 'Sherlock Holmes'. He'd meant to do all of this a great deal earlier, but he just.... hadn't. Maybe he had been a bit afraid of what he would find, given how much of a problem this kid seemed to be. Maybe deep down he thought he'd change his mind?
Sherlock groaned. "When I told you that I was... Really drunk. I mean yeah it would be great to come out but..."
"Well, I am currently at the country home, but I have another week or so of business to finish in London before I return to L.A. We need to have a serious discussion about your future, as well as meet with the label and other various things when I get back. Can I trust you to be on your best behavior until I return? Will you have mercy on me and my Google alerts?"
on danger. So here you are." The man leaned back in his chair, smiling a self-satisfied type of smile that John wanted to punch.
His hand was right on the doorknob, seconds from freedom, when he heard John's sleepy voice drift from the other room.
that you can check out. They've been working together FOREVER and he followed Sherlock from Deduction to his solo career to dance for him, and just...have you seen how flirty they are on Twitter? Or used to be, since Sherlock deleted.
John blinked, looking around him. Clearly, he was missing something. "Well you could have fooled me."
There was so much swimming around in his head, so many things to think about, worry over, and the like, but as soon as his head hit the pillow he fell into a deep sleep, shoes still on his feet.
Was John.... sassing him? Interesting. "I tried to get rid of them, but my brother insists Mummy will be crushed if I do. As for the house, this is Mycroft's doing as well."
Whether you loved or hated them and their slick, yet undeniably catchy pop hooks, Deduction was undoubtedly one of Lestrade's more brilliant moves in his past twenty years of tenure at Capitol, and one of the more successful boybands in their five-year run. The four-member group had a meteoric rise to fame, notching no less than three number one albums, two number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, five top ten singles, and a dozen other successful entries on various Billboard charts, not to mention a Grammy win for Best New Artist, three American Music Awards, two VMA's, and a slew of smash international singles and awards.
"Oh, shit. I probably shouldn't have said anything then." Her bright fuscia lips pulled into a grimace. "You don't seem surprised though."
He sniggered as an aside, and the whole room full of sycophants chuckled in agreement while their leader, a white man hanging over the edge of a half wall, nodded his head in agreement. God, Mycroft hated all these nameless guttersnipes. He didn't bother to learn who they were--he wouldn't give them the satisfaction--but he had been dealing with their ilk for years. So sick, to take such obvious enjoyment from the downfall of others, and this show was the worst of the worst.
Up and down, his hand slick with body wash, he felt himself grow firmer under his ministrations. God, it had been so long, and he forgot how good it felt. He tried to picture something, anything to get his engine running even faster, but his mind remained blank. He didn't need the extra stimulation though, for only after a few embarrassingly short minutes, he felt his lower abdomen tighten and he was coming, his legs almost buckling from the sheer pleasure. For a brief moment his mind was bliss, his body singing, and he felt as if he could take on the world.
He finally felt at peace. He felt like he could churn out a symphony. He felt... hands pushing him away.
"So, is this about the thing your gorgeous and infuriatingly mute assistant mentioned? She said this had to do with 'career advancement'".
Yes, Sherlock was attracted to John Watson, and every day it got a little worse, just like his music block. Great. Wonderful.
The evening air was bitterly cold, whipping into his face, and he flipped his collar up, shrinking into the coat as much as he could, like some sort of turtle. The tube ride home, which normally was nothing but an overcrowded hassle that set his teeth on edge, was instead a warm respite from the freezing temperatures, and managing to score an actual seat didn't hurt either. By the time he'd gotten off at his stop, picked up a steaming bag of curry take-a-away from the only decent joint nearby, and made it back to his dreary bedsit, he could feel every single hour of his twelve-hour long day, throbbing in his lower back, feet and head.
Sally threw her head back and laughed so hard her curls bounced. "No. I don't go for that shit, and even if he asked me to I would say no. Got too much self-respect for that. Not that I think he would. Sherlock doesn't seem to care much what others think."
I can't say that there is more pressure to go beyond the success of '221'. While as a label we would love to reach an even wider audience for his music, I think at this point there is more pressure to go farther creatively. Sherlock is the type of artist that pushes himself to explore new avenues sonically, and the label is behind that 100%.
"Bloody buggering fuck Sherlock!! Jesus Christ what the fuckity fuck are you fucking doing? Have you lost your bloody mind?! Holy bloody fucking shit!"
Pot is legal in several states here in the U.S. so everyone please collect the sticks up your arses and set them on fire or build a birdhouse or something
"Well I think that went well, don't you? I think you've got a hit on your hands." John smiled, as he slid in the seat next to Sherlock. "Can't get that chorus out of my head."
"Well, when I make music I want to say something specific. I find that others can't tell the story that's inside me, no matter how much they try, and now I can't tell it either. It's hateful."
To anyone reading this in real time I have more chapters to post and will throw them up tomorrow. I want to post all I have so I can get to work on writing part two =)
The silence on the other end of the line was deafening and the static crackled in his ear as he strode down the darkened hallway of his house, searching for a spot where the connection wouldn't be as shoddy, which was one of the main drawbacks when he visited his country home.
John spent all day looking for Sherlock, scouring every bar, restaurant, club, hotel, high class clothing store, second hand clothing store, and even the organic vegan juice bar on Rodeo that Sherlock once called pretentious but had since visited regularly after becoming addicted to their vegan chocolate cake, but to no success. He made a few calls to various owners, bartenders, servers and the like of which he'd become chummy with since working for Sherlock, to see if any of them has seen him, but so far no one had. He was at an utter loss, and after an exhausting day driving over all of L.A, he sent a few texts to Sherlock, begging him to at least say he's ok, and headed back home.
"I guess that explains the weird stalker vibe going on lately, you used to be attached to his hip. What happened? I thought you two were chummy?"
John wasn't sure how to respond to that. If he didn't know any better, he would say Sherlock almost sounded jealous. But that was insane, wasn't it? They barely knew each other. Sherlock barely wanted to spend time in his presence. The moment had grown awkward, like so many moments between them, so John backpedaled.
. Pet Sounds...one of the greatest albums of all time. But L.A? Why do you ask? Isn't it a bit early to be talking mini break? I mean, we just met. I was thinking dinner first?" He gave her another one of his charming smiles, but she simply looked up at him without a hint of the warmth he'd seen in her before. In fact, she looked like a completely different woman. One who was decidedly not impressed with him. Quickly he changed tack. "I, uh, don't really think L.A is my kinda scene. As for the sunshine.... after serving in Afghanistan I'm not sure if I miss the endless sun, or I never want to see it again."
John had a hand pressed to Sherlock's chest, keeping him at a more respectable distance, and he looked shocked. Time seemed to be moving slower than normal, and it took until John wiped his mouth with the back of his hand to snap him out of his daze. His eyes widening in horror at the realization of what he had done, and how John had reacted, made him reel back as if he'd been slapped in the face. What a fool he was!
"Isn't silence being complicit though? What happened to what you told me last year? How you wanted to come out? And now you just don't care? You are totally cool with your publicist spreading hetero bullshit about you in the press?"
He drained the last of his tea, slamming the cup down into the saucer with a bit more force than necessary, and was fully prepared to gather his coat and leave, glancing out the window towards the gray storm clouds headed their way (of course it would be threatening to rain when he hadn't brought an umbrella with him. Of course.) when he heard a soft clearing of the throat behind him.
Sherlock had a smirk on his face which promptly melted the second he saw John leaning against the counter.
His tea had gone cold by the time he'd managed to send another text to Harry. He'd been waiting at the cafe for her for over an hour now, but he wasn't going to wait any longer now that it was clear she wasn't going to show up. Whether she was intentionally blowing him off, had simply just forgotten, or was drowning in the bottom of a bottle somewhere, too pissed to care, he didn't know, but he flipped open his phone and shot off an angry text.
The two of them stumbled back home; John was pretty drunk after being plied with free drinks by virtue of being in Sherlock's company, even though he had initially refused the idea of drinking "on the job", and Sherlock, well he was just straight pissed, though he was always pretty good at keeping it together. In all his years of celebrity, Sherlock was used to the look on people's faces when they realized what perks associating with him would get them, and never once that night, even though people had been fawning over John to get to Sherlock, did he get that look. In fact, if anything, he seemed put off by the attention. It was refreshing.
it's people like you that make me want to delete humanity. Kindly piss off or I will not hesitate to block you.
He woke up somewhere around two hours later, the towel still embarrassingly perched on his face, and he peeled the now cold pierce of fabric from him and blinked at the bright light coming in from the half lowered window shade. They were so high above the cloud cover that the view was nothing but endless blue. The flight attendants were making their rounds again, and they were soon served with dinner, and his choice had been a salmon fillet with rosemary fingerling potatoes and asparagus, washed down with a flute of champagne or two. He could only feel sorry for whatever gruel the passengers in coach were being made to choke down. This was heavenly.
Sherlock's heart beat like a drum in his chest, and his arms fluttered nervously at his sides as he stood. John inched closer, and after a moment of indecision as to whose arms should go where, followed by a bout of nervous, drunken giggles, John said "come e're" and hooked an arm around his neck, pulling him close. Sherlock buried his nose into the collar of John's shirt, taking in the smell of sweat and the lingering scent of his cologne, even though the angle was a bit odd due to their height difference, and he had to stoop over quite a bit.
"Living in the limelight!" John sang out, not coming anywhere in the neighborhood of the right notes, and shuffled over to the sliding glass door that opened out into the back patio, and slid it wide open. "The universal dream!" He continued as he stumbled over the lip of the door and went outside. Sherlock was pretty sure his neighbors wouldn't appreciate the dulcet tones of a drunk John singing Rush songs in the middle of the night, but it made for an amusing picture.
"Sherlock, you know that's patently false. I assure you I have nothing but your best interests at heart. However, you have been remiss as of late in actually telling me what those things you want actually are." Mycroft drummed his fingers along the hall window, wet with condensation. He looked out over his well manicured lawn, still in the moonlight. Such serenity was the only thing keeping him from snapping harshly and escalating an already precarious situation. "Surely you didn't think that after all this time, after everything, that calling me up in a snit and saying you wish to quit the business is something I could have anticipated? Music is your life.... it's always been. I simply do not understand."
Mycroft scrubbed a hand across his face and sighed in defeat. He had tried so hard for so long to keep his little brother safe, to keep him on the path away from this sort of thing, and it all had come to nothing. Downing the last of his bourbon to steady his nerves, he changed over to the next station and awaited the sound of the voice he'd come to hate most in the world.
"Jooooohn." Sherlock whined; he could feel the frustration building in him, and had to shove his hands into his pocket so he didn't pull at his hair and ruin the good thirty minutes he'd spent taming his curls into submission.
"No need for a psych referral Doctor Watson. I'm just being colorful here. Since I was a kid I've had a hard time with many..." He trailed off, unsure of what to say. He sighed dramatically. "You don't know what it's like to possess a great mind."
"And?" Sherlock was bored of this already. Within any group, especially those in the biz, gossip was a way of life. It was secondary school bullshit and it was exhausting.
"Oh, but it's the place for that.... thing!" John flapped his hand in the direction of Sherlock's coat, and it's dark, dramatic lines, and heavy wool. Ok, so maybe it was a bit much, but it did get chilly at night.
Sherlock liked having John around too; he was kind and genuine in a way that most people weren't, and he seemed unaffected by L.A and just as exasperated with the industry types he'd met. He made a mean cup of tea that reminded Sherlock of home, and while his jumpers were hideous, he had the cutest crinkles when he smiled, and the sweetest laugh, and when he came home, sweaty from a run, with his t-shirt sticking to him in all the right places, it was... good. It was very good.
Sherlock felt warm from the praise. "Well, on the outside at least. I was functional. I was happy. I'd found a purpose. Something that tethered me to the world. And then a few months ago it all stopped working." He sunk lower into the chair and scrubbed a hand through his curls. "I can't create. I can't become inspired. I listen to music and I feel nothing. It feels like something died in me and I don't know why and I don't know how to get it back, and I can't control anything anymore"
Ah, there it was. Mycroft was just as perceptive as Sherlock, if not more. John just hoped he could be believable. He did his best to keep his voice steady. "No. No, of course not."
Immediately he could feel his blood pressure rise; all this time John had been out, searching frantically for Sherlock, worried sick and feeling terrible about last night, he'd been here having a bloody party?!
But then he had been shot in the shoulder, his career as a trauma surgeon in RAMC effectively ended by a bullet, a tremor, and an honorable discharge, and no number of medals or commendations could soften the blow that every minute, every second, his whole being ached for the life he used to live. And so, every day he had the same routine--he got up, went to work, doctored to his patients in a competent way--and came back home to wonder where it all went wrong and whether it was even worth it to go on.
"No." Was all Sherlock said, all the reply he would dignify Mycroft with. The nerve of his brother and his schemes. This was not about protecting him, no matter how strongly he defended himself, it was about control, plain and simple. "Absolutely not."
John grinned slyly. Success. "I'm actually surprised they followed through with it to be honest. You can be very.... persuasive I imagine."
For seconds, or minutes, he wasn't sure, it was pure bliss. John's lips were soft and pliant, and Sherlock wasn't sure if he was kissing back or not, but he was too far gone to care. Like someone had flipped off a switch, all the noise in his mind was silenced. All that was left was the gentle thud of his heart and the clarity he'd been longing for.
This was not how it was supposed to be, he thought to himself, as he dumped his keys into the bowl on the rickety table next to his door, and toed off his shoes. He was not supposed to be slaving away, day after day, stuck in the monotony of treating minor ailments and being buried in paper work and professional bullshit. He loved being a doctor--it had been his dream since he was a child--but somehow his dreams never seemed to include this. He'd dreamt of excitement and adventure. He'd dreamt of feeling the blood pumping through his veins as he stopped a man from bleeding out, or brought a man back from the brink. In retrospect, maybe he had had a somewhat romanticized, juvenile view of the medical profession when he'd entered into it, but for a brief shining moment that's exactly how it was. The excitement, the danger, the thrilling highs, and the equally thrilling lows (and what that said about John himself, he didn't really wish to examine).
When the mirror started to fog he knew that the shower was ready, and he stepped under the spray, delighting in the way the water beat down onto his back, easing the aches in his body that he was too young to have, and loosening the tight scar tissue on his scarred shoulder. He dunked his head under the spout, scrubbing harshly into his hair with a handful of shampoo and moaned at how good it felt. His scalp has always been sensitive, and while he's normally been too depressed to feel much of any sexual desire lately, tonight it's as if his follicles have a direct line to his cock, and the stimulation sends sparks down his spine, making it twitch to say 'hello, you've ignored me for far too long'.
"Pop music." Mycroft spat, as if it was a curse word. Of course, he would, the man probably spent his days listening to Mozart and Brahms.
The last few months have been quite the downward spiral for the once squeaky-clean Brit. Days and nights of endless partying, drinking, and now what looks to be drug abuse, have ended up with several cancellations of appearances, several brawls, and rumors that there is trouble with the label concerning his follow up album.
To counter this, he'd gone out every night, and after the first few times of sneaking around, he'd stopped caring, becoming blatant about where he was going and what he was doing. John hadn't tried to stop him, or even put up a fight, instead he simply would sigh in resignation, and follow Sherlock to whatever club he attended for the night, and hung around in case anything should go awry. John always remained invisible, but Sherlock knew he was there, and it somehow made things worse to have him so close, yet so far.
The weeks dragged on and while there wasn't much movement on the Sherlock front--he was still incredibly closed off and barely said a handful of words in John's presence--he at least had stopped slinking off to God knows where, leaving John in the lurch. There were a series of heated phone calls between Sherlock and Mycroft that John overheard, and a day later Mycroft informed him that he would be spending the next few weeks, or longer, accompanying Sherlock to the studio where he had scheduled time with various producers lined up. Mycroft warned him that this could be a "danger" time, and to keep a trained eye and a tight rein on him.
There was a silence on the other end, loaded with tension, and for a moment John thought Mycroft was going to grill him, and if there was one person who could get him to crack, it was probably Mycroft. "Right. Well, as ever I trust your judgement. I will put out some feelers, see what I can find. My brother can be exceptionally predictable, but every once in a while, he does something we couldn't have anticipated. Slinks off to some place we've yet to have on our radar."
"And you would be?" John asked, and her eyes narrowed before flicking down to a Blackberry in her hand, and she began quietly typing away. Ok this was getting weird now.
"Oh, she was in a dreadful hurry. She said the man you were looking for with one leg was at the docks again, but, Sherlock, he was getting into a boat and she said it looked as though he were making to sail –"
John grinned up at him instead, trying to convey his apologies through his eyes alone. After he had won this fight – and he
Sherlock had never felt anything like it. He'd snuck out of court after dark before to view places where people had been killed or hurt and tell the lawkeepers what he thought, and he'd enjoyed it – the puzzle making his mind whirr and sing and his blood spin through his veins. This wasn't like that.
John grinned. "In front of powerful people?" The silver-haired lanista smirked back and jerked his head in the direction of the stands.
It did not take long for him to grow impatient with kissing, though; soon enough Sherlock twisted his body violently, almost throwing John off him with a bark of, "Enough!"
John sat up with a huff. "Do you honestly believe that?" he asked. "With all the opportunities you have given me to leave, to take what I want and give nothing in return, do you really still think that I would still be here if I did not want to be?" He reached out to touch Sherlock again, and ended up grasping his hand. "I
And then there was no hope. His body reacted to the words before he'd quite registered what they were and he was doubled over, shouting John's name, while his brain still caught up to the fact that John had called out
When they reached the door, Sherlock turned hesitantly, not quite willing to let go of his arenarius just yet. He smiled to see a similar expression on the gladiator's face and, slowly this time, leaned in for a lingering kiss. "Come inside," he commanded gently. John just smiled.
John shook his head stubbornly, his nose bumping Sherlock's clavicle. "Nor was I," he admitted. "After Mary died I never thought I would want to say
The trident gave his opponent a much longer reach than John himself could achieve, and so landing blows on the slave was enormously difficult; John was thankful he was not burdened with a heavy shield as he darted forwards, attempting slashing cuts at the slave's legs.
He cut off abruptly as Watson finally lunged, the sun glancing briefly off his twin blades as they swung around, before the opponent shrieked and dropped his weapon. Blood spurted out of his wrist; Lestrade made a noise of extreme interest. The blow had cut the tendon that controlled the thumb: the gladiator would never fight again.
The kiss was languid, commanding but slow; Sherlock could feel John's hands clenching into fists in the front of his toga. "Another time," he promised between kisses. "We will come back, another time."
He made to turn away, but John reached up and caught the curve of his jaw in his fingers, and Sherlock could barely move with the gladiator's hands on his skin more than turning back in the direction they were guiding him. When he was once more facing his shorter counterpart, John's hand reached up to knock the hood back from his face again. "I am more upset with you hiding now than I could ever be with you kissing me," he said quietly, his fingers toying with a stray lock of hair over Sherlock's forehead.
“I found myself, in those first few months, strangely unable to accept your absence. My choice to leave you behind in London was born of logic—to keep you from harm's way, and destroy what was left of Moriarty's organization. But after I left England, my once-singular focus was divided. On the hunt, my mind would...wander, inevitably, to your welfare. Just as often, I wished you were beside me, knee deep in the danger. It was...irrational. I knew you were safer at a distance. That I worked better alone. But despite these facts, despite all the years I had spent tracking down and eliminating criminal elements in the time before I met you, I found I could not banish you from my thoughts, not completely. The work compelled me, as it always does, to success in destabilizing Moriarty’s network. But an aspect of myself, one that remained stubbornly outside my dominion…longed for your company.”
"For weeks I have been dreading the moment you decided to tell me you were leaving. At first, I did all I could to maintain your interest. I took intriguing cases, and when that did not seem to work, I stopped taking cases entirely. But the distance remained. It took whatever sleep I had left. I could not think of a way to keep you to stay. And I could not convince myself, if leaving was what you truly wanted, that I could stand in your way. My decision to hasten the end was sealed when..." Holmes paused, and muted agony flickered across his face. "When I realized what it would be like, to lose you to the violence of my work. I could not
trodden down,” Hopkins clarified. “But I could not find anything in the nature of distinct impression. There could be no question that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path to the estate, and that he had done so to avoid leaving a clear track in the rain-soaked dirt. The fact remains, someone
“Unreasonable,” I huff, propping over him as he falls back onto the mattress. “Nothing unreasonable about wanting a meal in the mornings…”
“Mmm, I suppose,” I hummed, biting the inside of my cheek, and beside me, Holmes cleared his throat.
Holmes looked similarly unbalanced, his newfound confidence disappearing as quickly as it had appeared. “Ah,” he said quietly. “The most complicated aspect. That where I have the least amount of experience, and even less understanding.”
I recognized that spark in his eyes, and that rare, enraptured smile. For a single moment, I grieved for the warmth of Baker Street, because I knew we were unlikely to enter it tonight as we’d planned.
“I shan’t have to, if you make haste,” I said, not for the first time wondering when I had become a man who would feel exasperated rather than appalled in the midst of committing a crime. As my eyes scanned the hall outside of the luggage room, I conceded it was very likely the first week I had moved into Baker Street.
“Wine bottles,” Holmes hummed. His brow wrinkled, before his eyes flew open and flared like gaslamps. “Show me.”
"Holmes..." I said, when I could manage it. My heart was burning in my chest like a bonfire. "That is...precisely romantic."
“I am a man of my word.” At that, he took a pointed sip of tea, and with somewhat less fervor, took a single slice of toast and nibbled experimentally, holding my gaze the entire while with one eyebrow raised.
“We cannot go to the Yard. Peter will almost certainly be killed if word escapes that they are attempting to move smuggled goods through the Circle, and it would bring risk to the Johann, the Circle, and all its members—yourself included. No, we must locate Peter on our own.”
“Yes, sir. But not here at the station, sir. Down the way.” The station master gestured an arm south, pointed past the turnstile in the direction of London. “One of the railway warehouses, Mr. Holmes. It was burgled overnight, about four days ago.”
“I should have warned you better. I should have anticipated the pistol. I knew they were dangerous, I was a
“But already I am concerned, Mr. Larssen.” Ink-black eyes moved to me, narrowed into slits. “We instructed you to come alone. For all of your sakes, I pray your man is not a member of the Yard.”
“All were deboarded save one compartment?” Holmes said, eyebrow raised. “Sir, me and my companion are looking into the...
I thought, vengefully, tears sliding unbidden down my face. My eyes stung but I didn't bother to wipe them. No one was there to see, or to conceal them from.
However could he claim to know nothing of romance? He would render me a swooning mush upon the floor without even realizing it.
“You believe he met danger at the Circle. Or encountered it leaving there.” My stomach twisted in dread.
I did not allow the misery of those cold years without him to touch me. Not here, within his embrace. “I forgave you the moment you asked for it," I whispered. “I was angry. Not that you lied—only that you left me behind. But you returned to me. How can I not forgive you, when to share my life with you is all I have ever wanted?”
The girl in question was a young thing, perhaps twenty, and she practically quivered at Hopkins’s pronunciation of my friend’s name. Internally, I steeled myself at the sight of her admittedly lovely blushing cheeks; I had seen such reactions to my dear friend before and they rarely signaled favorable encounters for either of us.
“Watson!” I heard, and Holmes was on his feet. He marched over to me, eyes wide and fixed on the fearsome stain beneath my handkerchief-wrapped hand. “Good lord, what has become of you?”
I was roughly ordered downstairs, and I played up my leg as much as I dared, desperate to buy Holmes time to escape from that hidden room. I hobbled more than I walked, my cuffed hands clutching the bannister in a death’s grip, but Coram had little patience for my stalling.
(I am a cautious man. For all that I love the thrill of the chase over cobblestones, I am, ultimately, a man of careful action. I would make a poor doctor otherwise. So I do not exaggerate when I say my next action happened without thought or care for consequences. I acted, in a moment of emotion, on a total impulse.)
“I owe you no explanation,” she seethed. Her dark eyes blazed with fire and a conviction I had not seen in an age, not since the war, not since the eyes of the Afghans who moved to mutilate us where we lay dying in the field. “I owe you
“Curious,” I heard Holmes say, through the drumming of my pulse in my ears. I watched him, ice spreading through my veins, as he trailed across the carpet to take the object from Fred’s hands. Grey eyes inspected it with an interest that filled me with a terrible, paralyzing dread.
“Something must have been taken, then,” I said, and frowned. “Didn’t the Professor tell you nothing was missing, Inspector?”
“So you dashed ash all across his carpet, and left him alone to reveal himself. And caught two pairs of pacing footsteps in the process.”
“I know the place because I have been there,” said I. “Several times. I am a member, Holmes. And I have a ring just like that one, hidden in my wardrobe.”
, an African cat, distinct enough to cut through even the staunchest tobacco smoke—a distinct and exceptional
Holmes narrowed his eyes, leaning like a general over the man’s desk. “And who were these workers? Were they familiar to you? Had they done work for the station before?”
“We have plenty of time this evening to find Peter,” I insisted, praying my voice and expression were as level as I hoped they were. “In the very least, we should wait until the first performance of the night. There is every possibility that the man himself might walk in to carry on the third night of a particularly irresponsible bender.”
been monitoring my emotions around you, Holmes, it is because I did not want you to notice that I’m horribly, irreversibly in love with you.”
Papers shuffling, the resounding click of a closing briefcase, and Holmes was sidling by me and closing the door behind him, as seamless as a snake.
“I made it to the road. I saw the postman and appropriated his mare. We chased down the path to Chatham, and I found the horses unmoored upon the bridge.”
“The Professor,” Holmes said, and his voice was as deep and cool and unaffected as a frozen river. His eyes, however, daggered into the elderly housekeeper like a hunter who’d spotted his prey amongst the trees. “Was he ever married?”
Swallowing hard, I nodded once more, and Holmes sighed, heavily enough to drag down his proud shoulders.
The last flicker of life left the man’s visage and his face went entirely to stone. In an instant, there was the sudden thump and creak of hinges, and I gawked as one of the overfull bookcases alongside the bedroom wall swung open, and a woman rushed into the room.
” I retorted, glaring at his thin, pale face as he failed to meet my gaze. “For two weeks you refused to eat properly on the heels of that nefarious forger, and you
“It did not upset me,” I protest, and cinereal eyes flicker to mine, eyebrow up and skeptical. Carefully, I exhale.
In the morning, Holmes came as promised. Unbearably, he appeared completely normal after last night’s conversation, almost as if it had never occurred at all. It set off warning chimes in my mind, telling me all was not normal no matter how opaque the glass behind Holmes’s eyes appeared. His gentleness in helping me into the hansom so I did not jostle myself was subtle, but not subtle enough to me who knew him so well. Neither was his lingering gaze on my collarbone, which glared with livid red bruising that had grown even more pronounced overnight. No, all was not well with my friend, but I did not prod him on the way home. Nor did I speak much at all to him, other than asking or denying assistance as we made our way finally to our sitting room, and soon I had lost the chance. After a perfunctory inquiry about my needs, to which I told him I was fine to sit and catch up on our post for a time with a cuppa, Holmes had disappeared to his rooms and left me alone. It was further evidence for my concern that he did not linger. The conclusion of a case usually left Holmes in the most resplendent of moods: it was then that he reached for his violin and played his sweetest music, that he insisted we treat ourselves to dinner out or a live performance, that he could be most easily pressed to indulge in sweets and snifters and laughter.
Remarkable. I daresay I now see the appeal. It is regrettable I did not know the effect of such compliments on you sooner. We might have arrived to this conversation much earlier, and without as much fumbling on my part.”
"I held your body in my arms and thought you had died because of my cowardice. Because of my inability to let you go.” A bleak, watery smile moved across his face. "And so I chose to drive you out myself. And I hurt you, even though you mean more to me than any soul on this earth. You see, Watson," His cheeks were flushed, and at his sides, his pale hands trembled. "I reciprocate your feelings more than you know. And this is what it is, to be loved by me." His voice cracked even as his mouth twitched into a wider smile, as awful as it was beautiful. "It is far less than you deserve."
“If someone went to all the trouble of creating this fake train, then it was surely with the intention of stealing the real one! Or more specifically, what stealing what was on it.” I clacked my cane on the turnstile with victory. “It must be the prototype they were after, Holmes, there is no other explanation!”
“I wondered what sort of “important documents” Mr. Robinson might be keeping among his things, and he was right to desire them kept close. Their revelation is the only thing that would prove more ruinous to him than his prototype going missing.” He shot me a prideful glance. “A shame he did not invest in a sounder baggage lock.”
The answer did not resolve the real question that still gnawed at me: explanation for how the intruder could have ascertained where Smith was sleeping. Could she have spied him through the window? Holmes had noted the spent candle, could it have been bright enough to light the man's visage through the night rain? Or had the killer stalked his habits on the grounds beforehand at an earlier date, a premeditated habit? If that was so, why not bring a murder weapon? Why rely on finding such a knife in the residence, if murder was on the mind?
“Watson, there were simply not enough rooms in the upper east wing. A bedroom, the sitting room and that massive study below, and only two rooms and a linen closet above? I knew the moment we entered the professor’s room that it was not large enough to account for the difference in area from the ground floor. I inspected Ms. Tarlton’s bedroom and the linen closet to confirm the theory. There were nearly three meters in the hallway unaccounted for within the floor plan.”
“I knew you would stop me,” she returned, voice low and confident. She took his hand with the gentleness of a lover. “I knew it. I just gave us the chance you needed.”
"I never want to go into battle without you again. It was intolerable." Holmes swallowed hard. "My focus has never been so compromised." Echoing his movement from last night, I took the hand pressed to my chest and threaded my fingers with his, squeezing in reassurance.  "Please...sit down, Watson. I will fetch your medical bag.”
“I take it...” he began weakly. “...I was found near the Pit Gallery. Passerby or police?” He exhaled stutteringly, brow furrowed in pain.
“Indulge me,” I said, mildly exasperated, and with a considering look, Holmes eventually bowed his head.
Off went Hopkins and for a moment, Holmes looked at the wilted housekeeper. “Come, Watson,” he said. “She will not attempt to flee. Her guilt will hold her here.”
“I will send our Irregulars to observe each address tonight. Due to their dispute with the Cutthroats, it is likely these Threadcaps will be on their guard, but I trust in their skill. We cannot allow Peter Ables to come to risk by hoping he is not killed in a Yarder raid, so we must ascertain his location first and extricate him. While they are occupied with your deal and contending with the Yard, I will infiltrate said hiding place, liberate Mr. Ables, and escape before the Yard descends with clubs raised.”
“A fab—there was no perfume? No civetta scent?” I exclaimed. “My word, you certainly had me and Mrs. Marker going. You were so specific!”
“In that case, Mr. Floams,” the man said scornfully, lifting a dismissive hand, “please excuse me, but I am not in the mood for idle chit-chat.”
“One final thing, Watson, before we depart.” He pressed his face close to mine, so I could hear his whisper above the gale. “I must check something, and I’m afraid you are going to disapprove of the manner in which I mean to do it.”
I stiffened at the sound of a low groan from where I had slumped in my chair. His bruised face wrinkled and my heart rose to my throat, overjoyed as I watched his eyes flutter open.
“Ale or wine, gentlemen?” Johann was a tall and well-built fellow, blond and handsome in a somewhat hardened, masculine way; his voice, as indicated by his name, had a bit of an accent that I did not recognize—Scandinavian, likely, but where specifically I could not say. He moved behind the bar with practiced ease, sidling up to us with a small smile. "Something from the tap? Whisky?"
“Very interesting,” Holmes mused. “You have been most helpful, sir. One final question, if you’d permit me—was there anything exceptional about any of the passengers aboard the train?”
And I will die before I let you take me in irons. You will let me walk out of here, or I will die upon this floor by my own hand and will!”
“He suffered a gunshot to the left shoulder. Through and through, with no arteries struck in the process. He will be fine. Hopkins sent for a doctor to aid him as well, after you were attended to.”
My eyes moved to his face, and I found I could not recall to blink. Holmes’s eyes, which were striking alone with their singular, silver color, seemed somehow more arresting than before. I realized, with shock, that it was because they had been thinly lined with some sort of kohl. It would be invisible on the dark street, but in the low light of the Circle it would be finely noticeable, and it was terribly becoming. The brilliantine that normally slicked his hair back had been washed away to leave Holmes’s hair oddly loose and thick, almost as it was in the evenings and early mornings after a bath, but it had been smoothly combed in a classical coif. In a particularly foolish impulse, I imagined my fingers carding through those locks, determining their apparent softness for myself, and I tore my eyes away to inspect further. In effort to disguise his features, Holmes had masterfully applied hair from his sideburns down to his chin and around his mouth, forming a short, ebony beard and moustache.
“I wasn't upset," I say honestly, and swallow my pride. "But it may have...stirred some memories. I do have my methods for coping with such things." I gesture to my journal, which lay beside me.
"Quite easily, my dear fellow." My friend stooped first to offer me a generous, piping cup of tea, and then moved casually to the sitting room window. In a smooth motion Holmes opened it, dangled himself out into the crisp October air, and inserted two fingers in his mouth. A high, clear whistle pierced the morning, resounding off the cobblestone below in two swift trills, and Holmes turned back to me with a spark in his grey eyes.
“The Professor theorizes, madam, that young Smith was driven to take his own life,” Holmes said calmly. The woman blinked rapidly, startled, and her papery face lost what little color it could spare. One of her hands flew up to her neck, sealing over a modest cross necklace. “Did you observe evidence of such depression in his demeanor during his time here?”
Holmes looked at me, eyebrows tented upwards. “I do not know where to begin,” he said. “I have…I have never placed myself in a position to know. I do not even know the sensation of a kiss, beyond descriptions in literature.”
“Holmes,” I said, and he paused at the door. I swallowed away the stone in my throat, along with any other words I wanted to say. “Thank you.”
I felt a feather-light touch upon my hand, and immediately I recoiled, flinching back. The touch disappeared and reason percolated through the sudden fear that had seized my limbs. I opened my eyes, cheeks flooding with embarrassment at my reaction.
“I beat upon your back. Gave you my air. You would not breathe, even when I—” His voice cracked, and his shining eyes went unseeing, fixed on some distant nightmare. “You had no pulse. I believed—I thought you were—”
Wiggins shook his head. “We know how to duck trouble, Mr. ‘Olmes.” His green eyes sparkled. “It’ll just cost ya.”
“I am here to be used,” I said immediately, and the wicked glint in his eye faded, softening to something much more fond.
My eyes returned to the archives in the dark corner of the flat, drawn as if by magnetic pull. Cynicism welled in my stomach. I’d be lucky if I could manage a damn thing with his notes, let alone justice. I was not Holmes. I was not the detective. I did not possess his powers, his knowledge, his energy, his dedication. I’d be lucky to manage rent payments on 221B doubling my clinic hours! I would not even have the
“So you would like to determine if could prefer more intimate touch, from me. And you would like to touch me to your satisfaction in return.”
“My dearest fellow, what have I told you about jumping to conclusions? The discovery of this false train does not suggest very much at all—other than premeditation, and proof that the train did not, in fact, vanish into thin air.”
“Later on, as we were trying to sort out the mess with the tickets, I received a most peculiar telegram from my colleague at Chesterfield station, the following stop on the nine o’clock train’s schedule to London.”
“Though you half suspected it,” I teased. “Admit it, then. Before this, you couldn’t explain it either."
Holmes blinks, and with a minor hesitance that I can only find terribly endearing, he moves to edge of my bed and carefully sits down, facing me. The distance between us is tantalizingly little, but I do not reach forward to close it. Something has crawled beneath Holmes’s skin this morning, if the dark circles beneath his ashen eyes me speak no better.
“A component, Watson, but not the whole truth. What precisely was taken, I regret to say I don’t yet know. We may never learn it.” He pressed his lips together. “It is unlikely Coram will speak to me. As for his wife, she has not yet woken from her comatose state, and may never do so.”
, weren’t you listenin’?” the man snapped, his young face twisted with annoyance. “That’s why I’m still bloody here! I’m filing a complaint about my treatment!”
I peered over the entertainment section to watch Holmes take the missive, thank Mrs. Hudson, and examine the note with interest.
Jaw tight, I carefully stepped over Holmes’s body, placing myself between him and his attackers. My adversary sneered over his swollen nose.
The body of Bartholomew Sholto lay on the other side of the city from Mary's, but despite this the sight was so familiar than the barest glimpse of it sent him reeling back down the alleyway to empty the sparse contents of his stomach onto the sand.
John took a deep breath in and let it out noisily through his mouth. "Well," he said briskly. "That was exhilarating."
Angelo had come up to stand behind him, tall and broad and generally imposing. John smiled at him. "What have I got to be nervous about?" he asked, but his heart wasn't in it and he knew it showed.
at him. He nodded sharply. "Now. Do you want to be helpful? There will be two sestertii in it for each of you."
He had half a mind to bring up how little his Emperor seemed to trust him. He had promised to be Sherlock's
"You do not have to," Sherlock reminded him. John shot him a quick frown before tentatively poking out his tongue and licking the glossy head. Sherlock drew in a sharp breath at the sudden wet warmth. "
The man pulled back his sheets and pummelled his pillow briefly, readying the bed for him like a servant might. Sherlock frowned at him, but climbed into the space he had made nonetheless, patting the pillow beside him. "Lie with me," he ordered softly.
It was... the most extraordinary sensation Sherlock had ever felt. He raised himself up to look at John's face, breathing heavily as he absorbed the feeling - he was
The lanista looked at him for a moment; Sherlock kept his eyes resolutely on the gladiators, trying to keep his expression neutral. Once again, though, the silver-haired man was not stupid.
Sherlock seemed to calm down slightly, though he still insisted on probing it carefully with his fingers to ascertain how deep the gash was. "You are right," he said finally. He stayed on his knees, staring up at John with those incredible eyes, his chin resting tantalisingly in the softness of John's abdomen. John swallowed. "John, what I said that night, I did not mean it the way it sounded," the Emperor said slowly.
It’s good she hadn’t handed me the cup because I would have dropped it.  I regarded her, crimson cheeks and all.  “You knew?”
Holmes had glanced over his shoulder at me as one such fellow had dropped his extended hand to his side and taken a few steps in retreat.  I had not been able to read Holmes’ expression then or puzzle it out since.
John approached the window, lifted the sash a little.  The sill blocked the view below his hips, the clarinet obscured much of his chest that showed between the sides of his dressing gown.
Long, low notes snaked through the opening.  A shard of light from the hallway illuminated a wooden floor in need of varnishing, the corner of a frayed red carpet.  Everything above the floor was dark.
John rose to his knees, tilted Sherlock’s chin up and kissed his cheeks.  He tasted salt when he kissed Sherlock’s half-closed eyes.
I pulled my gun from my waistband.  The animal leapt into the air as I was sighting, landed on Baskerville and the two rolled across the grass, a mass of indistinguishable black fur.
“While you were sleeping.  I have a couple Irregulars keeping an eye on this house as well,” he said.
“Not at all.  If you feel up to it tomorrow night, we can plant them in the forest, or in the park, if you prefer – anywhere you like.  The twigs will root and leaf, and they’ll never tire of telling the tale because they’ll be able to say they were here.  That will give them precedence over the ones that only heard it on the wind.”
He shook his head.  “It will make you drunk.”  He smiled at me then and I smiled back, both of us bloodied.
“Look at the blood,” Sherlock replied, his narrowed eyes focussing away from the body and that oddly-composed face.
I almost asked whether he was a psychiatrist, but his engagement was too intense, as though he were reading my mind.
“I may have to add a new dance, John,” he said, his voice audible only because he stood so close to me.
“Good morning, John,” Mrs Hudson said as I joined her, shutting the laboratory door behind me.  I had noticed that I did not care for its light shining into the library, as though the two aesthetics should not intrude on one another.
In the event that Madeline Anabel Lenore Usher should not survive me, or if she shall die before or after qualifying as Guardian, or if she shall fail, neglect, refuse to serve, or be unable to serve or continue to serve, or shall resign as such Guardian, I name, nominate and appoint my friend, Edgar Iorwerth Corvus of Iorwerth Manor to be Successor Guardian…
“Oh, of course, excuse me.  Swann, Madeleine Swann.”  She took a step towards John, hand half extended then pulled it back to her side.  “Not used to this yet.”
where it fit into notches along the top of the gold ring that Sherlock had made for me and which I had chosen to put on that finger.
“No,” I agreed, feeling how he was supporting most of his weight on one of his arms now.  I stretched out beneath him.  There had been a time in a field; the scent of flowers was the same.  But that may have been in a dream, so often my dreams are of him.
My gaze drifted from the shadows beyond the open library door, to the flames dancing in the windows.  Beyond them, all was black.  “…eleven, twelve, thirteen.” I got up to close the curtains.
He was brushing his parted lips along the length of me, hardly touching, his breath cool, the tip of his tongue inquisitive.
“Yeah,” I answered slowly, thinking about the power of naming and the crowds that had flocked to the opening days of the exhibition, murmuring and jesting and taking photos in the courtyard and posting them with captions like "Renfield and Me".  I considered the vastness of the internet where the statue's nickname would have been echoed in reblog after reblog.
I set the envelope and blade down and let him slide the dressing gown off my arms; its hem brushed against my legs as he turned away.  I slipped the card out from the envelope.  It was engraved in pointed letters.  “Dos?”  I scanned the ornate script framed by a border of vines and fruit and flowers.  “On the 20th, here?  Where?”
“After that first evening, I would find the swan on the canal every day when I came home.  I didn’t usually see him from the bridge, but by the time I had come inside and opened up the balcony doors, he would be there.  This went on for more than a week and I made a point of bringing home the bread he liked and a bag of lettuce and I would feed him from the balcony.  Then one day, he wasn’t there.  I’d come home early, so I waited, checking every so often, but there was no swan.”
Sherlock was seated a few steps up the stairs, stroking Baskerville and looking past him at the branch taking up much of the entryway.  "Do you see what they've brought, Mrs Hudson?"
“Right, of course,” I replied.  “So Billy doesn’t stay here, I take it,” I said, admiring the cherry tomatoes and walnuts, yellow cheese and capers amid the green leaves.  “This looks delicious.”
"Where's..." I began to ask and stopped when I spotted Sherlock down in the boat, its benches lit by the lantern Greg was dangling over the side of the dock.
I slipped a bolt from my quiver into place, aimed to the side of where the harpoon pierced the creature and released the string.
He glanced at me, then returned his attention to whatever metallic thing was in the fire.  He struck again with his hammer.  The metal rang with a beautiful note.
She raised her plate.  “This goes with it and there’s a teapot to match over on the counter, a little one, just enough for two cups.”
“And he’s intercepted some communications that suggest they might be connected to a couple unsolved arson cases here in London,” Greg added.
I saw his lips move, but the words refused to make sense.  They were Sherlock’s lips and had no right to be on this other person, especially considering what I had so recently watched them doing.  I forced myself to smile politely, because it seemed the words might have required at least that.  If they had required a reply, I couldn’t have attempted it.  I heard Sherlock introduce me and my name sounded odd, as though it had extra syllables.
Sherlock drew in his lips before answering.  “No,” he finally said.  “Don’t ask Mrs Hudson about them unless you have lots of time to spare.  I understand her grandmother wrote letters.”
John tilted his head.  “Fair enough,” he said, eyes once again looking though his field glasses.  “It’s just not obvious.”
He grabbed a handful of knives and threw them rapid fire at the pristine piece of wood.  Near the top of the plank, they formed the outline of a head.  He gestured at me with the tip of the last blade.  “Care to try?”
My eyes followed hers and saw that the stars were fading from the frescoes as a rosy glow brightened the fresco.
“I want to walk down to the bridge over the Long Water.  Have a look at the waterfowl there before we meet Ms Swann at the Round Pond.”
There was a loud thump and an ominous crack.  The hilt of my sword struck my foot as it fell.  The boat shuddered, rising on a wave before splashing back into the water.  It soaked all but my chest where I had pulled the quiver and crossbow close to me.
John looked over his shoulder to check the crowd at the bar.  “I think I see our chance,” he said and grabbed their glasses.
He turned towards the study, his coat flaring about him.  “Let us sit while you deduce, Doctor Watson.  I have the advantage as I already know the basics about you and it’s probably too soon to go deeper.”  He glanced back at me when he reached the hearth and gestured towards the seat facing the one by which he was standing.  He shrugged off his coat and scarf and draped them over the closest desk chair.
Sherlock shrugged a shoulder.  Muscles John did not recognise rippled beneath Sherlock’s skin.  John traced one with a fingertip.
I gazed out over the people clustered in groups, their faces ruddy in the light of their fires.  I squinted into the wavering glow.  Here and there, I saw cheeks as pallid as Sherlock’s.  I frowned, my eyes darting between those I could see.  None were talking or singing or eating.  Indeed, they were all very still.
"With nary a pause, they had come.  Mostly women, but sometimes men.  They’d knelt before me and I’d gazed into their faces, hoping with each new one that it would be my moonbeam, but it never was.  Then, I’d looked up and the dancer was beside me, but he was not alone.”
I smoothed the nap of the upholstery on the arms of my chair.  I should have been grateful to take my ease after the two weeks of vigorous investigation from which Holmes and I had returned only the previous day.  The case that had taken us to the Cotswolds had involved more than a goodly share of traipsing up and down the countryside as well as some nocturnal and clandestine explorations of certain interiors belonging to the key suspects.  Our prompt discovery of the murder weapon had not narrowed the field as much as I had thought it would, the family having several extant branches, each as fruitful as the others, together with households replete with staff and landholdings well-populated with tenants, any of whom could have borne a grudge, real or imagined, against the deceased.  Unfortunately, their intricate tale, which had had me on tenterhooks the whole time Holmes was unravelling the tangled skein of clues and eliminating the numerous contenders one by one, was of that type that may never be shared with the public, even at a distant date and thoroughly disguised, and so there had been no point in working on its notes, already recorded in cursory fashion, and I had simply filed them away.
I was slumped in the corner of a cab, my eyes closed, my limbs incredibly glad to be at rest and the muscles of my face stretched into a grin that did not feel as though it would abate any time soon.
Sherlock moved across John's chest.  His tongue was not as delicate an instrument as a moth’s sting, but he applied it with intensity.  The waver in John’s respiration was a fine reward.
“There was none for my tea and Mrs Hudson had gone out.”  He sighed.  “You were off returning that predictable mystery novel you’d been reading and I didn’t want to wait.  You are prone to dawdling at the library.  So, the newsagent it had to be.”
“Maybe…”  I was in the room once more, enjoying that light scent and taking Madame Willow’s hand in my turn.
“Ah, you spotted Palug, her older son.  Not easy to do,” Sherlock said.  “This area is his remit.  Chapalu will have gone back to guard the grounds of the Manor house by now.”
“…the swans,” Ms Swann finished.  “Although they stay at a distance when a lot of people are swimming.  I used to think they were judging our style.”
Sherlock’s spots mimicked the shade.  His circuits around the light grew wider and wider.  He wanted to brush against John’s lips, drink from them.
The jangle and clink of metal on metal echoed from the Tate’s forecourt gardens.  I turned.  Inside a large, grey lorry, metal nets were being lowered over the
“No,” Mike admitted, setting down his pint.  “Is it awful?”  He spread his hands on the table.  “The location’s great, the rent sounded like it could work with your budget and Mrs Hudson told me about it a couple hours before I saw you in the park.  It seemed like serendipity.”
“But you rarely succeed,” Sherlock concluded, setting the book back on the glass coffee table nestled in the angle of a large ell-shaped sofa.
The door to his room is very closed.  So is the door from the bathroom.  I checked.  I could breathe through the keyhole, I suppose, but that’s not likely to wake him up.  And I wouldn’t want to wake him, he needs the sleep.  I prefer it when he sleeps on the sofa though, or thinks on it, stretched out or curled up, it seems the right place for him.  Not locked away in his room.  Well, I doubt the door is locked.  I haven’t checked that.
He paused and I caught up with him at the top of a flight of stairs.  He plunged downwards, I proceeded with care.  The torchlight had provided a glimpse of steps with furrows worn smooth in the centre, their surface glistening with moisture.  The temperature sank as we descended, the damp air surprisingly fresh.
I have trouble looking at them without thinking where else I had wanted the veins to go.  I think that’s why Sherlock hung them in the sitting room.  When he sees me sneaking glances at them, he has a tendency to shed garments and drop them like bread crumbs on his way to the bedroom.  He hung a couple of the life studies in there.  I rarely look at them; I usually have the original to hand.  I think Sherlock likes them.
Sherlock barely heard the words.  He felt the vibrations of sound, but then John’s tongue was against his stinger.  He drank from its surface before stinging it and then he found a place so tender on its underside that when he withdrew the stinger, he could not bring himself to move away, so he bored into it again, a little deeper, and yet a third time.
I snorted and took his outstretched hand, putting as little of my weight on him as I could manage.  My legs were steadier than I thought they would be as we stepped over the window ledge onto the terrace.
As I passed his box a black cat separated itself from the shadows and trotted after Kit on its three legs.
Something small brushed past my shin and a moment later a small face emerged over the table edge between Kit’s elbows.  He set down his mug and scratched between his cat’s ears.
I felt my way forward with my toes, hands out by my side.  A couple steps brought me to more stairs.  Up I climbed, past a westward window that lit the curve of the stone steps for a few paces, then it was just my hand on the rail carved into the wall of the tower that guided me.
“Not exactly.  Many people here have had dealings with him one way or another.  Unpleasant dealings,” Sherlock explained.
“Yes, I envied him his cap, but I was annoyed that I couldn’t see his face clearly.  Generally, I was annoyed that day.”
I peered at the transformation, my voice an undulating hum.  The semi-circles stretched out, arched up and took flight.  It was a short glide from Sherlock’s hand to mine, the landing in my upturned palm accompanied by a light clink as the metal met the stones.
He stopped.  “Well-spotted,” he said.  “Its footprint is dedicated to movement, all the way up and all the way down.”  His fingers fanned out towards the ceiling and the floor then he wedged the torch between two spears round the nearest column and stretched up for something mounted high on the wall.  He turned back to me with it in his hands.
I pulled the breath out of him with a long, slow glide.  “I do so hate to rush.”  I smiled in the dark when I was seated on his thighs.
When the last of the lather was swirling down the drain, I suggested dinner.  I’d had another idea as well, but I didn’t mention it until all that remained of the Chinese food I’d ordered was half an egg roll and some sweet sauce.  That he had acquiesced to having food when a mystery was afoot was either a courtesy to me or, more likely, a sign that he didn't have another avenue of approach yet.
“Ah, they must be clearing out what was left after the sale last week,” she said, nodding.  “I didn’t look at the books.  They were mostly in cartons under the tables and I didn’t want to bend down and pull them out.”
The perytons stamped and reared, but through the uproar, I thought I heard her voice saying, “Good for all of us.”
Holmes popped out of his chair and rifled through his stack of newspapers.  “The auction!” he exclaimed.  “There was reference to it last week in an article about a recent sale at Sotheby’s that was re-selling a certain necklace.  In the author’s opinion, except for that one item, what was on offer last week didn’t hold a candle to the auction three years ago when that necklace was first sold along with a whole collection of jewels that had never before been offered for sale to the public.  Representatives of museums were outbidding one another.  Agents of private collectors were doing their best to keep up.  The author is extravagant in his descriptions.  He doesn’t believe he’ll see anything like it again in his lifetime.”  Holmes held up a newspaper.  “Here it is.”  He thrust it at me.
“Pfft.”  Sherlock’s head turned towards me.  “I was watching your expression, John, and that, I could have done at home.”
In this case though, he had simply ascended a flight of stairs to a tower, which I suspected marked a corner of the Manor.
It’s unnerving when he does that - holds me in his sphinx-like gaze.  It’s easy to get lost in it.  I had to concentrate to keep my focus.  “Come up with a rational explanation yet?”
I assumed the promise of freshly-baked ginger biscuits was keeping him from voicing a sharper response.
My eyes darted about the room.  Beyond the window, the moon rode high above the rooftops and I thought that if a neon sign suddenly appeared on one of them, blinking alternately ‘run’ and ‘now’, it would not persuade me to abandon this chance.  Remaining steady in the face of that realisation would not be easy.
“Welcome to the side of the angels, Doctor Watson,” he said, delicately inclining his head towards me.  “If you’ll excuse me.”
I offered my right hand and an open cuff scored with the outlines of intricate knots slipped over my wrist.  Its pattern was the same as the designs on my harp.
She opened her jaws.  Her fangs gleamed in the moonlight.  She closed them on the edge of the branch and shook her head from side to side.
I lifted his left arm, kissed his wrist where a bruise would surely form and set his hand on his right shoulder; did the same with the right wrist, so that his arms crossed his chest.  His fingers tightened in the linen at his shoulders to keep his arms in place.  It was a ward.  Whether I was able to make it strong enough to be of any use, I didn’t know.
I stood to have a look at the titles and he waved me back down.  “Leave it for tomorrow.  Refresh yourself now.  You may need your strength.”
“He was rather flushed,” Sherlock conceded, “but when they found the first three items missing, you would have thought they would have noticed a trend.”
His lips were full.  I was mesmerised by their changing shape as he spoke, enunciating each word as though he were French kissing it.
“Perytons,” Lord Holmes said, looking out at the creatures.  “Difficult to handle, but incredibly fast.”
I peered more closely, spotted the thorny branches of bramble and rose, withered flowers still on the vine.
“Breakfast,” I replied, “with everything!”  Usually it took two, three days of being on-call or being shot to knock me out like that.
My humming was barely more than an articulated sigh.  I touched my forehead to Sherlock’s and watched the molten gold crystallise and divide into two bands.  My palm cooled.  My humming ceased.
I sat up and reached for the cup of tea that was already poured.  There was a narrow parcel wrapped in a chamois situated between the cup and the teapot.  I took a sip of the tea.  It was perfect.  “What’s this, then?” I asked, tapping the parcel.
“We’ll have to keep an eye on the temperature next winter,” he said.  His hands came to rest, one loosely cupping a buttock, the other tucked between my chest and his stomach.  His breathing slowed.
He slipped his arm through mine and started us walking again.  “When people die close to the solstice, their families or friends are able to bring their bodies entire to the fire.”
Sherlock opened the doors and switched on the lamps either side of the sofa.  There was litter all around, but the intersecting beams of the lamps created a spotlight on the drawings that drew the eye away from everything else in the room.  Blood seemed to pulse from the heart through the veins that climbed towards the face.
I decided to start on the drawing he had suggested.  I pushed the laptop aside, got out the picture of the heart and hand and placed a sheet from the second largest pad of paper next to it.  There was a marked difference in colour, thickness and texture between the printer paper and the bristol, but I was not to be deterred by such things.  At some point, I could fill in a background colour to disguise it.  I did not consider re-drawing the original.  It had become a sort of talisman to me.
The closer hearth was wide and high, the kind you could walk into.  It bristled with iron hooks from which pots might hang.  A mound of charcoal was all that was in it now.  I could feel the draft from its chimney.  It had trailed a ghost of ash along the glossy floor, which looked to be paved with flint.  The candle light glimmered in its dark circles.
“She did not act alone. Or indeed, act much at all. You’ll find, Inspector, should this woman regain the ability to speak, that it was loyalty that guided her, not the true motivation for this crime.”
Mycroft smiled that tight smile of his.  “You’re welcome, John.”  He got into the car.  “I always know whom I should contact if I need an extra hand,” he added as the door closed.
Sherlock’s fingers trailed over John’s cheek.  “I cannot see the future,” he said, “but I suppose you will have as much as is usual for a human.”
The jaws of Sherlock’s serpent opened.  Its lolling tongue was nearly white.  From between its teeth, a grey, sluggish form protruded.
His hand slid off my back.  He leaned to the side and pressed his palm over a part of the inner edge of our design – on one of his lines.  It grew more distinct near his hand, a pale silvery-blue.  The colour spread, grew more intense.
“Of course, yes,” I said, and nudged him to go down the steps from the pedestal of the fountain.  “Even when you haven’t shagged me senseless, I’d say yes.”
For an instant, I thought Holmes would take his arm, but, with the briefest look at me, he extended a hand towards the stairs and they descended.
Upon my return from the bath, the fragrance of tea greeted me.  On my desk sat a tray, with a small pot, a little pitcher, a waiting cup and a plate of cinnamon toast lightly dusted with sugar.
“Yes, yes, of course,” Mr Braithewaite said, not appearing the least offended.  He turned to Corvus.  “Shall I proceed?”
“Ah,” Sherlock replied and I heard the smile in his voice.  “Mother has sent the Lights.  I thought she might.  A gift for your first Fire.”
Bill had thanked me for that next time we got together and we had laughed, certain that we all must have been far drunker than we had realised.  Yet we took to crossing the road up by the pub and walking to the Tube down the other side, just as my old schoolmates and I had done years before.   None of us had ever talked about that part.
Moon blade in hand, I stroked his hair and watched the blood slowly fill the slight concavity of my excision.  No new grey lines formed.
“You have brought great honour to your name,” Lady Holmes added, drawing near. “An auspicious debut to your career.”
He recalled the first time he had seen them.  He had still been grey and fluffy, but no longer small enough to ride on his mother’s back.  He had been surprised that his parents had not hissed at the creatures, who were large, nor had they chased them away as they did with any other creatures who set foot on their island.  His mother had explained that they were called ‘boys’ and that these boys were cousins and that was why they were welcome.  The swan had been surprised that these ‘boys’ were birds because they only had feathers on their heads, so they couldn’t fly at all.  They could swim though.  He had seen them do it near the river bank.  They were not very fast and they splashed all the time, not only when they were busking.  His mother warned him that there were others who looked very similar to the boys, but were not cousins.  These boys could not come to the river banks or their island, but if he went exploring, he would see such creatures and he should avoid them.
“Unless there was some other magic at work that none of us noticed,” she said and refilled my tea cup.
He paused and I thought a fuller explanation might be forthcoming, but I was wrong.  My muscles betrayed my frustration.
“Off you go, then,” Mrs Hudson said merrily.  “We’ll have a wonderful breakfast for you when you get back.”
“Your scar, precisely rendered,” he added, setting the card on the table.  He looked down at me.  “You’ve clearly been studying them.  Any theories?”
“Interesting,” Sherlock said.  “The adrenaline would have helped you.  It has the opposite effect on some individuals.  We need to explore this, but for now we need it to stop.  Do you want to try your hand at it or shall I?”
“Their mother had inherited ‘significant’ jewellery from her grandmother when they were children.  Their older sister had been given her share as a wedding present and they had been told that the rest would be theirs on their wedding days, but those days had never come and the whole matter was forgotten until their mother was on her deathbed and trying to tell them where the keys to the safe deposit boxes in their names were located, but didn’t have the strength to get all the details out before she fell unconscious and then died.”
“Only a bit,” he emphasised, reaching over his head and scooping up both bands.  “Enough so we don’t chafe wearing these, no more.”
“It was his art – to remain unseen.”  Sherlock took the dagger that matched mine from his belt and held it out to her.  “This was all that remained of him.  Keep it safe.”
“Madame Willow asked for silence while she sought out Agnes’s advice.  I didn’t know where to rest my gaze.  The Morrows looked so expectant, it was painful.  Madame Willow sat with her eyes closed, her brow mildly furrowed.  The other women at the table all had glistening eyes.  Once again, I felt compelled to leave and take Mary and her friend with me, willing or no, but I held fire.  It wasn’t my decision to make.  At least not until something more unambiguously outrageous occurred.
I set to plucking.  I could not go much faster than I had before, but the melody flowed more pleasantly.  I heard a definite click at the end of the tune.
I took a shuddering breath and let go of one branch.  I’d unlace my bloody boots and climb in my stockinged feet if I had to.
Sherlock held the map by its top corners and eased it away from the wall.  “Mike must have been pleased that his gamble paid off.”
“Garters?  Seriously?”  I was going to say more when the image of Sherlock’s long legs in similar attire rose before my mind’s eye.
Despite the closer bond we had forged since Sherlock…yes, yes, that is the name I whisper in the dark and cannot say in the light without thinking on it…since Sherlock had returned to me, I had never complained of my hurt at his having left me to grieve for years…and he…had never told me how my marriage had made him believe I would not care overmuch whether he was dead or not.
In languid circles I moved them to a tune I was humming, then lifted myself up.  I heard Sherlock’s head bump against the wall and leaned forward until I found his lips in the dark, and slowly, slowly sank down again.
John went to sit on the sofa.  He put his feet up on the coffee table and took another sip of tea.  “I’m rather disappointed.”  He rested the cup on the arm of the sofa.  “Drink while the tea’s still hot.”
I turned at the lilies, no longer circling, but describing an arc, whose apex was closer and closer to the edge of the terrace and the stairs leading down to the water.
“On the contrary,” I said.  “I recognised it immediately and think I can imagine it under a cold, grey sky.”
He’d taken me in; speech was a lost cause.  I sighed instead as his fingers traced the skin beneath the loosened waist of my jeans and his tongue pressed me against the inside of his teeth.
I caught the phone, checked the seat of my chair for pins and finding none, sat.  “No you didn’t.  You were married to your work.”
I looked at Sherlock.  His attention had shifted again to the band in his hand.  He had it suspended from his thumb.
“But not now,” Mrs Hudson said.  “I have some news to share over our dessert.”  She lifted the cover and revealed three golden apples that appeared to be floating in a sauce of liquid gold.”
Sherlock held his hand up to his mouth.   With the tip of his tongue, he licked a drop of sauce from his thumb.
“Perhaps,” Corvus agreed.  “He was not pleased to learn that it would be some time before Roderick’s and Madeline’s wills could be probated, and he could receive the items of jewellery that they had left to him.”
“Do you refer to the several men who have been tracking our movements since we first entered?” Holmes turned to me with a wry smile. “My dear fellow, I may be new to it, but I have not forgotten the manner of bar we have found ourselves in.”
The flat was so quiet. Every time my conscious mind began to slip off the precipice of awareness, the silence shook me awake. At the edge of nothing, my ears would strain for sound—for the low screech of an adjusted chord, for the suck and low puff of a pipe—and my heart would pound in my chest as though gripped by a fist. My palms would go sweat-damp and my throat would constrict around memories of swallowed cries and shouts across the falls. Behind closed eyes all I would see is cliff mud and the white mists, the white bloodless stretch of bone and flesh below black water.
Holmes stepped out of the cab and I craned my head to look up at the Bridlington station. A twin to its sister station in Evesham, it looked slightly busier if only for the more bustling town streets across from it. Above the station, cotton ball clouds were beginning to crawl against the sky, and the bite of the November wind had eased somewhat thanks to the welcome rays of the climbing sun.
“We’ve no proof of it. These insurance policies, Watson...” Holmes crossed his thin legs, elbow propped on his other arm as he grasped his chin in thought. “They’re key to this, but there are yet more pieces to unearth. It seems with every stop along the line, we discover breadcrumbs...”
I sighed heavily. There would be no talking him out of avoiding a possible crime scene, and however much anxiety it stirred within me, I knew well that Holmes’s disguises and impersonations often outshone the stage. “Very well,” I said. “But I must go as myself. It is possible you will be recognized merely for our association.”
," I echoed, eyes opening to see the great Sherlock Holmes flinch. Acid had crept into my voice, scalding away the cold. "Is that your excuse? That your manipulations aren't meant to confuse and mislead me, that so long as your curiosity is sated and you mean no harm, I'll be left untouched? Unbothered?" My voice had risen now, wounded pride and heartache tempering its strength like the heat of a forge. "For God's sake, Holmes, you cannot—you cannot be so cruel as that."
That was one of the better ideas Holmes had ever had. I needed fresh air, and the night cool to marshal my self-control.
“Tell me, Mrs. Marker, did you notice anything strange about Mr. Smith’s behavior these last few days?” my friend asked.
“D-Depression? Ohh, oh no, Mr. Holmes, I—” The woman twisted her hands with increased anxiety, voice trembling. She took the chipped teacup before her with shaking hands, voice dropping to a near whisper. “Oh, how awful, but—but perhaps the professor is right. He—he did know the lad best, after all, and I know nothing of such sorrows in men…my own late husband—”
His hand found the grip of his Webley and he swung round his arm, only to scream as I pulled my own trigger, firing a bullet directly into the muscle of his bicep.
I looked through bleary eyes at his desk, at the station of his work. It had provided him more assistance in his crusade against London’s criminal element than I had. Maybe it was uncharitable, to compare myself to an inanimate object; I knew that Holmes had appreciated my help. But I was aware that my position at his side had been earned through loyalty, not utility. I had been lucky to witness what I had, friend to brilliance that never had and would never again shine upon this earth.
"In fact, sir,” said Holmes. “I believe I have.” His granite gaze caught mine and flickered meaningfully to the floor, and looking upon the carpet, it was only my years of practicing a poker face as a doctor, soldier, and flatmate to the world's only consulting detective that kept my mouth from falling open.
For the most fleeting of moments, Holmes looked stricken. His hands constricted once at his sides, desperate for action with a ferocity I felt in my very bones. Just as quickly, the horror on his face was locked away, transformed into the passionless mask that served him best in the direst of circumstances.
"I..." Holmes's voice suddenly cracked. In that instant, he looked young. Young, pained, and horribly vulnerable. "Why?"
In retrospect, it was alarming how I had not previously recognized our concert sessions and trips to the country as potentially romantic escapades, when now, they could hardly be described as anything else.
“I’ll have plenty of time for that in false hospice,” said Holmes dismissively. “Now, Watson, I have a question for you. Tell me, do you by chance know anything of the Ming dynasty?”
"Of all the incompetent, useless..." For a moment, Holmes looked incensed, but just as it quickly as it came, the irritation disappeared, fragmenting into something infinitely more delicate. Hesitantly, as if unsure he had permission, he reached for me, the faintest tremble to his hand as it moved to press against my heart.
“Returning to London, to our partnership here, briefly satisfied that unruly quarter in me. But time passed, and that part of myself which had so irrationally desired your presence did not abate. Rather, it intensified. For weeks, I could not comprehend it. Why did something within me remain fixed on you, try to reach for you, when both of us stood in the same room? Why did the need for your company not subside once we were reunited? It
“Breathe,” I choked. His beloved face was blurred in my vision, his Adonis features smeared and colorless. “You will not leave me, Watson.” My voice eroded, sand beneath waves that took my hope with them.
“That’s—that’s not for personal use, sir,” the station master said weakly, and Holmes made a contemptuous noise under his breath.
Holmes’s eyebrows shot upwards, and his eyes grew wide. I summoned my courage, unwilling to stop now that I had struck the match, and clenched my hands on the arms of my study chair.
Johann visibly boiled with rage, but after a moment, the red left his face, and his proud shoulders slumped in defeat. "Fine," he said, voice dead. "Whatever I must do. Just...please. Do not hurt him."
"You've kept the boy waiting long enough," said Holmes, not unkindly. "If you do not mind, I have a partner that needs tending to."
Regardless of my past and self-reckoning, the period of my life before Holmes was markedly unattached, romantically speaking, to any partners I had communed with. That is to say, I have never
“As always,” I murmured. His closeness, his burning gaze, brought my heart to pound, battering against my ribcage.
“I have already narrowed the safehouses down to two possible locations,” he continued, smirking, and I started in surprise. “His colleagues at the shipyard told me Ables was last spotted leaving his shift Thursday afternoon. His fellow impersonators last saw him depart after his set late that evening. It is likelier that his abductors lay in wait near the Circle for the end of his performance, rather than tracing his movements back to his home in Old Nichol. Furthermore, it is also doubtful that they dared transport him very far from the site where they took him. With those parameters, there are only two safehouses in Ratcliffe they could be keeping Mr. Ables. My Irregulars will survey both, and tomorrow morning, I will instruct Lestrade to raid the building where Mr. Ables is not.”
“Yes,” I said thickly. “Yes, I recognize it. I have seen it before, and I know what it means. Where it is from.” Holmes said nothing, clearly waiting for me to continue, tension taking hold of his lithe body and furrowing his brow.
“He did,” Hopkins replied. “But perhaps he doesn’t have knowledge of the man’s personal belongings. Presuming that Mr. Smith was indeed the target, it’s likely if this was a robbery, something of worth was taken that has little to do with the Professor himself.”
It was this precisely that I told myself as I made off in search of an empty hansom, but against reason, my stomach twisted in strange, slow-furling knots. I had little time to spare, I told myself, and I would have even less if I decided to walk home with Holmes.
“Of course, Holmes,” I said obligingly, drunk with the furious, clumsy kisses he peppered upon my mouth, as if I could control the direction of all future bullets destined for my cranium at his request. He kissed like a young man did, uncertain and feverish, and it dizzied me, sending me lax and pliant beneath him.
Holmes looked downwards, avoidant. For a figure I had seen tower over lesser men, he looked to me then strangely wary and thin. "For all our years of friendship, there are things which we simply do not discuss. Our families. Our childhoods. Banalities, which hold little interest to me and little use to you in discussion. There are elements of myself that, for much of my life, I have been content to ignore. But recent events...they have caused me to wonder."
“I agreed to a deal,” Johann said. “I will sell your liquor at whatever price you set. Now please, just let Peter go.”
His eyes shine like the waves of the Channel on a cold wintry morning. “And I you,” he says quietly. His answering smile is small and completely breathtaking. My heart lifts in my chest, lighter than air.
His childish grimace faded lightly, subverted with the distant veneer of fondness. “You are a taskmaster. But let it be said I am a man of my word.”
Schadenfreude tilted Holmes’s mouth into a smirk. “A very effective little scheme, I will say. It is no wonder he’s desperate to leave. Four different companies are going to be coming to call on him for his invention, and no doubt they will be very displeased to learn he does not possess it.”
"Your observations were correct. I was—I have been...intimating. Performing cues so as to indicate—that is, I have been, intentionally—"
“Ms. Tarlton was too young and too earnest to have known the truth. And she cared too much for the young Smith. Besides, while in her room, I checked her boudoir.” He ignored my noise of disapproval. “Mrs. Marker, as she said, had been attached to the manor since before Nicholas Coram purchased it. She would have known, at least, that another room existed, or at least that renovation had occurred to obscure the presence of one. Thus, I surmised she had a role to play, and that we might find evidence in her apartment. If the murderess was on the premises, she would have been soaked to the bone making her false trail to the gate and back again. She would have been pressed to dispose of her wet gown somewhere out of sight. Mrs. Marker had her own cottage, and space in which to hide the frock.”
rather striking, I thought, with smoothed copper hair and a brassy moustache, and striking green eyes the color of ivy.
I could not live with this. I could not live without him, could not live with my having failed him so utterly. I pressed my mouth over his, tears slipping down my face, and gave Watson my air, wishing to Heaven that I could give the life within my traitorous body to the only man my heart beat for.
“All of them?” I said, surprised. Holmes scowled. It appeared my instincts about Holmes’s mood were correct, palimpsest or no.
The taxi to Bridlington was swift, with Holmes and I sharing companionable silence as I looked over my notes for the case and he sat in thought. Over and over again, I envisioned the train from the night before, flickering from my sight as if it had been made an impermeable spectre. I’d never seen such a thing happen before, and as usual, I was absolutely burning with curiosity over what Holmes thought about it. And in his typical way, Holmes was stubbornly close-lipped around his own ideas of what we had seen, even at my prodding.
That voice, sonorous and flat, sent a jolt through my heart. My eyes were tugged unbidden from the floor to my friend, who was looking at me with such tremendous disapproval that my sternum seemed to crack apart in my chest.
I chuckled. “Perhaps it is for the best,” I said gently. His eyes flickered questioningly to me, and I shook my head. “For tonight, Holmes. We have a case to focus on, and a young boy is depending on us having a clear head for tomorrow. As much as it may pain me—” My voice lifted in amusement as I lay a hand upon his chest. “—this can wait.”
” I gasped. “Truly? Then whyever did we leave without speaking to him, Holmes? Do you believe him to be responsible for what's happened to Peter?”
“You enter the unreliable realm of speculation, Inspector,” Holmes lectured. “But I require more data to make certain of the facts. I should like to speak to the illustrious Professor, if he is in such a state to greet us. But first—” Holmes moved to the bedroom door and stuck out his head. “Ms. Tarlton, if you please!”
“It cannot be ruled out, but it is just as likely he is an unwitting dupe than he is a conspirator. Regardless, the only evidence I have points to a level of strategic accomplishment, Watson, that I doubt that man capable of.”
“Ah. William,” I managed, as my eyes threatened to fall out of my skull. His touch was like fire, burning me through my suit jacket. “This is Mr. Quincey Mulberry—”
I had seen them perform before, and I leaned back with my wine glass to listen, gladly, as the crowd died down and June began to sing.
The next moment had the urge whistling out of me like wind through an open window, leaving me empty and cold. Revenge would not serve me. It would only leave me angrier and colder than I was before. And Holmes...Holmes could never approve of his research being used in such a way. Not for vengeance, no, not such a petty, futile, mortal motive.
He looked at me with that light in his eyes, dancing as it did moments before apogee, and he opened the door.
“Until I was booted off the bloody train!” Mr. Robinson cried, again incensed at the drop of a hat. “All because of this imbecile station master!” He pointed to the ticket office, where behind the counter, I could see a young man in a uniform wince visibly like a scolded child.
“Precisely,” he said, with a small smile of his own in return. “Without a warehouse to investigate, there is no other evidence left to find. Let us see what our station master has for us in his report about the missing train.”
The young lady blinked rapidly. “I, well.” She paused, her delicate features folding in thought. “I can’t say that I noticed anything…odd, sir. We spoke of the usual things, in casual, innocent conversation, that is. This awful weather and the garden, and of—” Pink bloomed in her fair cheeks, and she looked to me with a bashfulness befitting her age. “—of your most recent story, Doctor Watson. Mr. Smith had gotten the latest print in the
“You’re smarter than your written counterpart, then,” she said, smiling, and it was by and large the cruelest smile I had ever seen grace the face of a woman. “You are right. We cannot let you go.”
“What do you suspect you’ll find?” I hissed the words through my teeth, leaning with forced, casual ease on my cane.
“Let’s be off,” I said hurriedly, eager to be on our way before we could truly be waylaid. “We’ll be late for our train at this rate!”
“The letters,” Holmes said. Misery seeped into the pale regret on his face. “I knew you dreaded them. I had thought that you…I had come to the poor conclusion you resented the public attention your stories have brought to us. You did not care for any client that came to us that was attracted here through them, and in recent weeks you have…” Holmes trailed off uncertainly, and his ivory cheeks seemed to flush as his gaze dropped to the floor.
“Your case has some features of great interest, Inspector.” Holmes smiled. “I shall be happy to look into it. We’ll meet you at the train station within an hour, after Watson has his important breakfast.” I scoffed at the jab but ruined the effect by smiling immediately after.
