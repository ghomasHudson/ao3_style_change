So the beast steals meat, but only the kind that is no longer wanted. Judging by the quantity, the creature has a rather voracious appetite. He pushes some of the meat aside and finds a few flasks chilling in the ice, along with a crate of apples. Pilfered from a delivery truck, going by the stamp on the damp wood. Omnivorous then,
The idea sucked a lot of air from John’s lungs. Even when he and Mary had tried to be ‘experimental’, neither of them had really been adventurous enough for that. The idea made his heart beat a little faster. His nerves tried to come up with an excuse, but he refused to be cowardly anymore.
John was obligingly turned onto his front. He couldn’t tell if the shivering he felt in his limbs was from the unknown concoction, the chill in the air, or his own impotent combination of rage and terror.
But he supposed that if Sherlock’s life was going to be made simpler with this sort of mild infamy, then John could stand some hypocrisy.
Mycroft huffed a small surprised laugh. “My team is good at surveillance, but my brother is able to hide many things from a great deal of people. It’s how he was able to act ‘undercover’ without my knowledge. Those assigned to him merely thought he was sick with the flu towards the end. They aren’t close to him; therefore they don’t know what signs to watch out for.”
And with that, the prince lost all sense of control. He brought his other hand down to tightly grip the boy’s waist as he grinded deeper into the serf. As John keened, Sherlock bit and licked over his exposed neck. He could already smell the Omega’s scent mingling with his own, marking and claiming him. Any fool with a nose would be able to tell that the boy had been taken, as if the dark spots dotting his neck wouldn’t already give it away.
But Sherlock still doesn’t come. He clings to the last thread of restraint until he sees John’s eyes widen in paralyzing fear before they squeeze shut as the last of his control slips away and his body’s impulses take over.
John had run through the forest as fast as he could. But by the time he’d arrived, the dragon was gone. The shops and the houses were burning. People were frantically looking for loved ones, yelling for help, or trying to put out the fires. John stepped in and directed everyone as best as he could. John thanked the gods that the drought had been broken earlier that day with heavy rain. Otherwise, they would have lost the whole town.
"But, unfortunately," Jim sighs,"your army pet is too stubborn for his own good." He sped the video again, this time to John pacing in his cell.
The house wasn’t much warmer than outside, but at least John wasn’t being coated in a film of water. He stomped on the floor, trying to get the circulation back in his toes.
“Fuck!” John shouts, his hips thrusting in the air, seeking out the glorious friction of five seconds ago. He folds forward, out of breath and aching.
John dropped the hand like it burned, and stepped away immediately. Disgust boiled in his stomach, while horror turned his mind blank. A hundred different versions of “I’m so sorry” crowded his mouth in an attempt to flee all at once.
As John was half crouched out of his seat, Sherlock tackled him to the floor. The impact was so sudden that John reacts instinctively by driving an elbow into Sherlock’s sternum.  He felt Sherlock’s expelled breath spread across the back of his neck, and John froze in terrible fear. This was all of the hesitation Sherlock needed.
Jim stops his task to look at John in surprise. When he sees that John isn't blustering, that he's really teasing him like he's a lover, Jim giggles. Sherlock's lips pull up into a smirk.
John moves his mouth off of Jim's cock, tonguing it and holding the base steady with one hand. With the other, he supports himself on Jim's bare leg. Both of Jim's hands hold John's head steady, and it's a testament to his loss of control that the little thrusts he makes into John's mouth and the air are completely involuntary.
He tossed it over into a trash bin while John spluttered. “Anyway,” Sherlock continued, “as an addict with major withdrawal I wouldn’t have waited more than, oh, ten minutes before I tried to inhale that entire bag. More than likely it’s laced with something even more addictive or it’s just plain poisonous. Either way, he clearly expected me to die from whatever was in that bag. So, here I am, about to be carted away to the hospital to either perish or be firmly out of the way by being expelled for drug use.”
flora. Now let go of me!”
Sherlock’s smile turned small and soft. It seemed he was hard pressed to come up with a response to such obvious sentiment.
Sherlock grips the back of John’s head instead of taking the glass away, making sure that most of it finds its way down his throat. John gasps for breath when Sherlock lets go. John could swear that the heaving of his chest makes the water inside of him slosh around.
Sherlock looked to the side. Snow’s face turned ugly. “I wouldn’t be shy now. Especially if you like having your bones unbroken.”
"We were on Big Ben. We were on Big Ben and we just
And yet. And yet, as vague as 'monster' is, it's the best explanation Sherlock has so far. He's not sure if he should punch something or whoop in excitement.
All John finds is tenderness, and he feels his heart stutter.
Warnings for this Chapter: Drugged Molestation
He went to get his mobile. According to the clock, it wasn’t even noon yet. His swirling panics had felt like hours upon hours.
“No offense,” he waves his hand, rolls his eyes, and continues, “so, how long did you live with humans?”
His husband winced sympathetically, “Forgive me, I did not mean to imply that you conjured them on purpose, or that they are meant as an idle distraction. I only meant to suggest that they are nothing more than the manifestations of your stresses and worries John. You have been through much turmoil these past few days, more than most souls see in a life time. It is obvious that this is nothing more than ghastly mirages.”
John didn’t take it, “No, you’re just young.”
"I told you I didn't want to break him. Why are you doing this?"
Sherlock sighed in exasperation, “I
Panic and sense crash John down from his aroused stupor, and he pulls back. He grips the desk edge to steady himself, and jolts when pulling away from Sherlock just pushes him firmly into Jim. Suddenly, the realization of where they are and who he's with comes roaring back.
Sherlock hasn't forgotten his original plan. He still wants John to love him. That particular avenue hadn't gone the way he had wanted, but Sherlock has been patient. And he will continue to be patient. John’s acceptance is something he is more than willing to wait for, and they have all the time in the world.
Something restless and unspent told John that he needed to do something quickly, or he might punch Mycroft in the face without being justifiably provoked. “We’re done here,” John said as he grabbed his coat. If Sherlock wasn’t before, he was definitely looking for John now. He needed to go find him before these two crossed paths.
But Sherlock just pushes him onto the bed without a word. John falls forward onto his stomach and bounces slightly as the air is knocked out of him. He lies there for a few seconds, to be sure that he’s not going to be manhandled back into this position if he moves. Sherlock just stands behind him silently, so John shimmies himself farther onto the bed and turns onto his back.
The taste on John's tongue is certainly not unpleasant, but it is foreign. He tongues the crown, licking at the precome curiously. The salty beads disperse on his pallet, and John seeks out more. When that tongue curls around the crown of his dick, Jim digs his hand a little more possessively into John's head.
Every excuse, from forgery, to believing he was somehow exempt from these cruel machinations, was transparently frail. Somehow, he had the courage, or perhaps a macabre curiosity, to carry on.
Their murder was done on a massive scale, with someone you previously trusted. Clearly, your most vulnerable state is between when you’re stone and when you’re flesh. Given on how long it took you to notice me standing behind you, even with superior senses, your sense of instinct and reaction is dulled considerably in this time frame. So a someone, or more likely several some ones as it would take a large group to take you all down at once and wasting time proving themselves would eat up valuable collaborating, literally and metaphorically stabbed you in the back. You trusted these people with the information you gave them about your kin, and they exploited it for a doubtlessly pointless reason.
Unimportant papers are strewn about everywhere. Half drunken mugs and an assortment of pecked at plates are cluttered close to one another and are quite possibly permanently stuck to the tabletops. Half of his books are in their proper place on his shelf, the rest are on the sofa or the floor. His experiments have completely taken over the kitchen, and it's a wonder Mrs. Hudson is able to enter there anymore without having a conniption fit.
The words are lost on John, who proceeds to twist on the sheets. He hears Sherlock advance towards the bed, but doesn't stop building up against the drugged pain. Then a bony hand is pressing down on his shoulders, preventing him from moving. John grunts, trying to twist away from the impediment. He has no leverage, and gets nowhere. A length of rope is suddenly under his armpit and around his shoulder, and John suddenly understands what Sherlock is doing.
John took the phone away from his ear for several seconds. When he was certain he wouldn’t chuck it against the wall, he brought it back up. “You approve of your brother trying to court a married man who’s over half his age, am I hearing that correctly?”
The dinner passed with ease. Sherlock retold the story of their operation with much greater attention to detail. He didn’t embellish like John would have, but the circumstances were exciting enough without it.
That worried John a great deal more than Sherlock’s stung pride.
“Fanciful?” John repeated with disbelief, “You think I see these horrific things out of what, boredom? An overactive imagination?”
John can smell the heady musk, and it makes him dizzier than ever. He doesn't even need Sherlock's command to, "Suck." He nuzzles his face, easily finding the hard flesh with his tongue. Sherlock still has his hand on the back of his head, but it's not a punishing twist anymore. It's just a steady weight that reminds him that any attempt at moving away would be unwise.
He locks the door behind him, just to be certain. He strides to the windows, then changes direction halfway to his room. Those look out into the busy and well lit street, and there's not enough space for the creature, no, gargoyle to squeeze through.
"Hallucinating, looks like," Sherlock responds, not really giving Jim much more than that. He's not the one who wanted a social visit. Jim can either talk himself to death or leave.
He presses against the wall, testing its firmness. It's metal, and it jangles a bit when he pushes, but there's no give. Something else besides the door makes it rattle whenever he presses on it. He moves his hands up, and they stop at a tiny ceiling just barely above his head. Pressing them to either side is pointless, he has less space on his sides than he does right in front of him.
"Not the good, clean way you want either. He'll keep trying to break you first. Think of new ways to make you 'behave'. Maybe more time in the box, without a catheter. Maybe skinning you piece by piece. Maybe slowly eviscerating every person you've ever said hello to your whole life. And eventually, days or months down the line, he'll succeed. He'll shatter your soul until you're nothing but a drooling mess that can barely remember your own name. Then he'll keep 'playing', until he gets bored. Then he'll set up something really special. Something that will properly punish you for making him bored of you in the first place. And once you finally, blissfully, after hours or days, die, don't be shocked when he brings you back from the dead to start all over again."
Climax struck John like a runaway horse. He catapulted into pleasure with all of the grace of a blow to the stomach. With his release done, all that was left was for him to fall into darkness.
But John wasn’t one to waste an opportunity. He waited to see where this lead. His options were severely limited anyway. His future either held whatever the strange lord was going to suggest, or selling himself to some member of high blood.
John wracked his brain for anything that could help him. He tried thinking of meeting a Holmes he could have pissed off earlier in life. But no, he would remember a name like that. To say nothing of how much he would've remembered a man like Sherlock for as long as he lived. Probably shouldn't dwell on Sherlock right now. John's furious blood pressure levels may kill him. Maybe this tied in to Afghanistan somehow? Was this a terrorist cell inside of London that kidnapped and tortured veterans for information? That was definitely a sobering thought.
Sherlock doesn't respond. As he massages the cream, John still feels himself harden. He hisses through his teeth, wishing it was all over. Then, just like that, it is. Sherlock's fingers are no longer brushing over him, they're pulling up his trousers. John's stunned, then shakes himself. He should be
It was blood hot, much warmer than Sherlock’s fingers. The tip was blunt and round enough that John briefly wondered if this was going to be feasible. But Sherlock had prepped him thoroughly. It slid in with very little resistance. It was only the startled clench of John’s body that kept it from smoothly gliding in.
John’s eyes clench shut. Sherlock tenderly wipes away a stray tear with his thumb.
No, God no, that wouldn’t work at all. That belonged in the opening lines of a porn video.
be started while I’m gone. Now then, what is so--”
This time Sherlock places all of his weight on the hand cupping John’s bullet wound to raise himself. The other stays on the bed to be sure he doesn’t slip. This way Sherlock gets to see John’s eyes, unblinking in agony, along with the rigid set of his back.
This time when John stopped it was to revel in the cool air caressing his sweat soaked skin. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed such a simple pleasure until tears pricked the back of his eyes. He was reinvigorated with resolve. John moved to pull himself up to another ledge.
“And as someone so observant,” John nearly spat the word, “you should know when repeated correlation begins to determine causation.”
“Are you free tonight?” Sherlock blurted out.
They expanded and flopped onto the ground with each trickling draw from his overtaxed body. His tongue and eyes felt shrunken and wrinkled. John was sure now he had far more in common with the physical resemblance of an ancient Egyptian corpse than just its wrappings.
The dragon said nothing. He continued to watch the rock cool around the chain.
Sherlock's teeth are shown in his snarl and he says, "Oh,
John’s mind was stuck in a loop. One part of the cycle was the heady sense of becoming a close confidant, then where they stood in that relationship, until finally he began to wonder if maybe they had become
“Are you out of your
Understanding lights through Sherlock's eyes, "Your stone state. It's what slows down your aging process."
There has only been one time that John tried to deny Sherlock sex. It was the first and last time he tried.
“You would have tried to put your head through the wall after two minutes,” John countered, “at least this way you have something to complain about.”
“You still didn’t answer my question,” Sherlock points out, “What were you thinking about earlier?”
John should have made Sherlock give him a name the first day they met. He’s not sure if he would have done the adult thing and gotten the brat expelled, or if he would have had a nice little ‘chat’ with him instead. John could see a few malicious smirks from his mates, and some confused expressions for those who had no idea who this stranger was.
“I’ve often fantasized about warmer climates,” John confessed to Sherlock as he was shown the different plants, “to go someplace not even the bleak skies of England could reach. Harry and I often made up grand stories of what it would be like.” He went silent. While the tortured banshee that was the ghost of his sister still clung to his thoughts, it didn’t diminish the love and companionship he’d felt for her.
Sherlock snorted, “I certainly wouldn’t have moved here, if it had been up to me.”
"If it's too much, I can turn down the light," Sherlock's voice seems to fill the empty room. Slight panic grips his heart, and John shakes his head. Already, he knows the full glare will be too much for his eyes, but he can't handle the absolute darkness again. Not yet. Maybe not ever.
After he closed the door, he felt a great relief lift from his shoulders. Even though he knew he was not done with his task. John hadn’t so much as made it halfway to his room when he was proven right.
It cracks John’s resolve enough that he brokenly murmurs a “Don’t” before sealing his lips against the rest of his pleas.
“I’ll send for a tutor,” Sherlock promised, “only the most qualified and capable I assure you. I will do so as soon as I leave this bed and have pen and paper at hand.”
He threw the paper into the bin. When he turned around, he noticed Molly had left the room. Belatedly, John remembered that Molly had never seen him upset or angry before. It probably wasn’t a pretty sight when your coworker started an unprompted heated tirade.
Jim reached over to his laptop and clicked a few keys. He turned the screen towards Sherlock. The footage was immediately recognizable. It was John in his cell. The screen was split into four parts, all of them showing John after the second "session" they'd had together. Sherlock would be mad if it were anyone else looking in on his time with John, but with Jim, it had only been a matter of time.
John stifled a laugh. It completely died in his throat when Sherlock readjusted everything and held up a beckoning hand from his seated position.
Lestrade was brought into it. Lestrade did not get roped into anonymous mugging cases. Lestrade was only involved when-
John tried to conceal his disappointment, but clearly failed at the curious look Sherlock gave him. “Why do you ask? Were you hoping to uncover some secret unbeknownst to your own mind?” He gently teased.
John did have a point, at that last part. With all of the great things Sherlock was capable of, this was beyond his abilities. Six paralysis spells without so much as a spoken word, followed by an incredibly dark use of telekinetic magic, was almost unthinkable. Nearly unbelievable. Yet here he was. Victorious.
Bruises that could have been caused by anything did not warrant alarm.
“I told you, I could not interfere. There is a reason why I remained cryptic. But since this is my last chance,” she squeezed him tighter, “at least I have the opportunity to say, I love you John. Goodbye.”
“Morally pure,” John parroted back in disbelief. It was like they were talking about John having a slightly off-color kink, instead of openly discussing having an affair with a student. He shook his head and refused to see whatever expression Sherlock had. “And do you? Want…this?” He motioned a hand between the both of them.
Mycroft asked him who he was and why he had sought an audience, though Sherlock was under the strong suspicion that his brother knew every damned soul from here to the neighboring kingdom. He certainly kept track of every Omega in the land, to watch out for any potential candidates that would breed fine heirs.
“He’d be happy to tutor you. He owes Moriarty and I for quite a few favors, and teaching to an eager pupil is certainly one of the more pleasant ways to waive those debts. He’ll be here by the end of spring. He’s rather on in years and prefers more favorable weather to travel.”
The stifled air in John’s lungs left with a silent whoosh. He opened the safe, unsure of what he would find. Yet having no expectations still couldn’t prepare him for the slight confusion, and even disappointment, of discovering papers.
He let the words hang in the air. He could almost see them float, suspended by tenuous strings of humility. There was his apology out of the way. Now he had to bare his soul to a teenager that quite possibly hated the very ground he walked on.
It wasn’t something that warranted concern.
"Hmmm?"
So they slammed through the double doors, John counted twenty steps, and then tossed his firearm into the darkness. He thought he heard it clang against something metal, but that could have been the doors banging open again for their pursuers.
“Privileges?” John turned around just as the boy was taking away the compress from his face. Dried blood still clung to his nose and the top of his lip, and John felt a flicker of…
getting something out of this,” Mycroft insisted, “You were getting my reluctant avoidance to whatever God forsaken thing it is you do in your wing of the castle. If you wanted that revoked, brother, you could have merely mentioned it.”
The man waves his hand, "Don't even start mate. I've had my demons, this is just my repenting is all. You thanking me is gonna taint that. So don't even try, yeah? Just eat your pasta."
John gets up to pace, ignoring the persistent pains in his stomach. Has anyone even noticed that he's disappeared? He never talked to his neighbors. Harry is his best bet, but she won't know he's gone until she tries to get him to pick her up from a pub again. He's alone here. John shakes his head. So what? He's been alone before. In Afghanistan he had his troops, sure, but he was a Captain. And leaders don't have someone holding their hand when things go to shit. That's why they're leaders. If no one's coming for him, he'll damn well carve a path out himself.
Sherlock pulls back to stare John in the face. His eyes are completely inexpressive, just watching John come to his conclusion about Sherlock's motives. John keeps going, "You want me to be coherent. It's not
Instead, Sherlock gently turns the wrist, licking at the marks. He swipes at the red lines, and suckles at the blue spots. When he's done with one arm, he moves on to the next. John offers this one without prompting, which sends a spark of surprise down Sherlock's spine.
This time, John barely jerked awake. As he began filtering in the sounds and sensations of a cold winter morning, he wondered if the lack of a violent awakening meant he was becoming used to these visions. He prayed deeply to God that this was not so.
John felt the ends of his fingers turn cold. “I don’t understand what you mean.”
Sherlock quickly looked at John, who was wearing a sickeningly familiar expression of delighted surprise.
John's head is hanging low between the bars. He's realized that the stimulation will do nothing to help him reach climax while he's still got the damn cock ring on. John can feel his reason slipping away. He's so close, so damned close and hard he just wants to come. The endless stroking of his prostate is driving him round the bend. John's choking on his cries, and he can't even feel Sherlock leaving another love bite. He's being carried away on a wave of pleasure so large it's almost pain. John's resolve is cracking. He's so close to begging for release, his mouth is open, ready to crack the words past the groans and whimpers.
She hummed noncommittally. John was willing to press the issue, as he felt oddly defensive for the boy, but Molly quickly changed the subject to something more innocuous.
“I cannot believe your audacity,” John chided as he slid back into bed. Sherlock’s arm came up to tug him close.
"Sherlock," John whimpers, if he had been his normal self, he would've been mortified at the sound, "please, make it stop. Please, I can't-I can't stand this. Please stop."
When the creature is satisfied, it surveys the London night, opens its jaw, (Sherlock can only see the chin) and...yawns.
The young man reluctantly scoots back to make room. Now that the cloud of euphoria is gone, John feels a little sore and uncomfortable. He jerks when Jim wipes the wet cloth across his forehead, behind his ear, over his neck. When he realizes what Jim's cleaning up, he grins.
Surrounded by familiar sounds, Sherlock shifted through the cold and shadowed corners of his mind palace until he finally found what he was looking for.
“Please don’t,” John mockingly begged in response to Sherlock’s derision, “if this is you being polite, I think I would die if you were rude.” His teeth clacked shut. He wondered how far away from the truth he was with that statement.
Sherlock opened his mouth before John said, “He was teaching me self-defense. After the attack he’s been aiding me in honing the techniques I already know. He’s been very
Sherlock groaned and tried to melt into his seat to escape. “If I had known you were this unfastidious I would have suggested we stare at the wall instead.”
The door banged open and a woman cursed, “Sweet Christ! Loretta, go get the hot water, hurry!”
“Since I just asked you, yes, I think I do,” the teenager bit out. John’s unseen wounds were peeled open a little further at the hurt in Sherlock’s voice.
idiotic enough to try to earn the favor of someone you consider your mentor. Therefore, it’s a gift from someone within this little self-made ‘empire’. A higher up, based on the age of the ring alone, as well as the fact that whoever that ring belongs to isn’t here often enough to prevent you from having it out in the open where anyone can see it.”
It couldn't hurt right? To ask. Just this once. It couldn't hurt. God knows he feels like he could explode if he doesn't get what he needs soon.
“No, no you don’t get to act surprised by—you don’t get to look at me like—what the
Oh, fuck, he had forgotten about Mycroft.
Sherlock slumps forward, careful not to put too much pressure on his weakened doctor. It had been too much, having him compliant, naked and wet. Leaning into his touch, when before he had been so defiant. Sherlock has less self control around this man than he can ever remember. How thrilling.
Kirstie Treblig, as she was known to her coworkers and family, had been a hard-working and no-nonsense nurse for upwards of twenty years. She specialized in the oncology ward. Her testimony stated that she had been ‘releasing’ her patients from pain for the past five years. A simple shock to the heart when they were already undergoing cardiac arrest was all it took. Never enough to leave traces, but more than enough to do the job.
"Yeah, thanks," John's voice suggests anything besides,"but I think I'll just stand here plotting your violent and painful death." John's infuriated when Sherlock rolls his eyes.
He bucked when Sherlock pressed his own hot length against John’s, and the dull roar in his head quieted to a soft clamor. He focused on how good Sherlock was making him feel, and saved the repulsion at himself for another day.
“It’s alright, I understand. Let me know if you require my help in anyway.” He turned to Jim, “I think I will take your advice, even if it was insensitive, under consideration. My feelings cannot undo what has already occurred, nor does it diminish the gravitas of their deaths. I thank you for your guidance,” he smiled ruefully, “even if it was callously presented.”
Jim nuzzled the side of his face. He rolled his hips in small circles while he soothed, “Hush now, no need for that. This is all just a bad dream my pet. Isn’t that right, Sherlock?” The man enunciated his consonants with long and deliberate drags in and out of John’s hole.
"My apologies Watson, I didn't realize you were suffering from some discomfort." John looks over at his teacher, and the silver eyes are tight with concern.
“If you say that one more time I might very well slap you,” John promised. He raised himself up on his hands and knees. “Go on then, but after this we are buying an entire pack of--”
John wasn’t above feeling a little smug about the timing. It was only amplified from Sherlock’s sour expression. The man collected himself to try and intervene, “Perhaps I could join-”
Sherlock gave Jim an expression of such misplaced ferocity that John stepped back at the sight of it. Clearly his husband was upset about something far beyond a lone excursion. Just as he was about to inquire about it, and perhaps recant his plans to soothe Sherlock’s nerves, the look disappeared.
John felt a sliver of fear lodge in his heart at the sight. He pushed open the door, and ran out into the cold.
The flasks are filled with water, and have a faint tint of metal. Water straight from the pipes then. Easy enough to acquire, if it could locate and swoop in undetected to any water main.
John exhaled in a burst when the tug sent him into Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock’s hands came up to grip John’s arms, and they stared at each other for a long moment. Then they were back to kissing, and the tenderness from before was replaced with urgency. Both of them nipped the other in playful reciprocity, until their mouths were flushed and plumped.
“Please, please stop talking. I’m still processing us having spectacular sex the one time, I do not need fetishes piled on top.”
Sherlock almost wants to tell John everything, reveal his whole scheme, just so John can admire how masterfully Sherlock’s conducted everything.
The scared eyes flicker down to him and she stutters, "It, it was. It had," she swallows, and it's all Sherlock can do not to shake some sense into the woman, "it was a-. A monster." She whispers, like she's telling some terrible secret. She moans, her body suddenly shaking terribly, and the paramedics order him to leave. That she's entirely done with questioning.
Sherlock places the cock ring on a nearby cushion, and takes John's neglected cock in his hand. With slow strokes he tightens at the base and eases at the tip, a move that brings John to a continual knife's edge. He squeezes his fingers at the head, pulling a little at the foreskin.
But Sherlock did not particularly care about that.
John’s about to ask whether or not this is going anywhere, even if it will probably only land him another slap, before Sherlock crawls atop the bed. Reaching to the bed side table, Sherlock squirts some lubricant onto his fingers from the large container.
He’d been confronted about his suspicions, and then wound up sick in bed for mysterious reasons once again? This reeked of foul play. Or was the story Sherlock wove so perfectly tailored because it was perfectly truthful?
Sherlock got out of the car without looking back at John, who had been stunned into silence since the words ‘I don’t have any parents’. He scrambled out of the car.
Sherlock steps around a corner when the guard comes rushing by, ushering and yelling directions. Sherlock moves past him, unnoticed, and gives the two finger salute to a blinking camera on the far wall.
Sherlock groaned, “Do you ever stop being a doctor?”
When Sherlock joined him for lunch, he immediately started complaining about the attention. “If they start bowing in the halls, I’m homeschooling myself,” Sherlock vowed as he picked at his half of John’s sandwich.
And out of all the pedestrian blunders he could've possibly pulled, he manages to go for the most obvious. His foot slips.
“Fucking
The website was practically sterile in its simplicity. It contained the title of "Sherlock Holmes; Unique Business Associate", a phone and fax number, as well as a subtly barbed message underneath that if the message wasn't important you could kindly bugger off. Hardly incriminating, and if the police had ever heard of a Holmes being involved in criminal activity, they would be directed to a message machine in a harmless building in Central London.
For a while, they talked about nothing while John pretended to do paperwork. Even if the topics were about their favorite music (Sherlock called his taste bland and predictable, while John rebutted that at least people could sing to lyrics) or other subjects that they hated (for Sherlock, it was everything that wasn’t chemistry, for John it was literature) it felt nice to have these easy conversations.
“Yes, and already I’ve been practically bombarded with the new ways to cause torturous boredom. Not a large enough community for an underbelly, not small enough that everyone knows how to keep a secret from one another. You should hear how the teachers yap on when they don’t notice anyone in their immediate line of sight.”
Sherlock and Mycroft’s deductions came crashing over him. They had both insisted that his attraction to Sherlock had been so obvious that he didn’t need to bother with pretending. Which John hadn’t been. He hadn’t been hiding some illicit attraction, he
He moved himself down without further prompting, licking and nipping his way down to John’s pelvis. The soldier’s cock was only half hard, but it stiffened further when Sherlock blew a soft breath of air across the hot flesh. Inwardly Sherlock lamented that he hadn’t thought for a handheld camera instead of one stuck to a stand. To have video evidence of John swelling to arousal would have been a lovely sight. But he knew John wouldn’t be able to distract himself from something so obvious. Perhaps John would allow it next time.
Sherlock hummed from the bed, “I was very clear about my requests. A shame though. We didn’t get a chance to use the vaseline.”
"Easy mate," John's voice rings out, not a trace of a tremor. And Sherlock notes with satisfaction that he's putting the weight back on his "bad leg". Harry doesn't even seem to notice the imminent danger, she's just swaying in her brother's grip. "we don't want any trouble."
John looked up from his cup. For the span of less than a moment, he could’ve sworn that he saw some emotion on Jim’s face that could not be named. He only knew it to be twisted and ugly. Then it was gone, and John told his hammering heart it was a shadow of the morning light.
“Neighbors?” John repeated. He watched as Sherlock headed into his kitchen. John belatedly followed when he heard cupboards being opened and slammed shut.
"Yes, yes this bone structure is far too delicate for something like actual flight. The wing membrane is also too thin for heavy transport, I imagine this functions much like a kite." Sherlock runs a finger over the faintly golden skin, and John jumps away.
Sherlock leans in, a gentle smile on his face as he makes soothing sounds, “Shhh, it’s okay John. I’ll make it better for you.”
If he was being honest with himself, John supposed it was the first time the teenager had sat on his exam table, and deduced everything wrong with his mediocre life.
The room was tilting, John thought. Surely the world was slowly turning on its head.
John has time to weigh what the worst part about this whole experience is. Is it the cloistering stink of his own sweat and breath? Feeling nothing, no fresh breeze or the softness of cotton, just tacky metal on sticky skin? No.
John hadn’t argued against it. How could he be humiliated by something that no one would ever see or know? Dozens of garments he’d tried on, and John certainly had a new found respect for the women who had to wear the things every day. The fabric was heavy and cumbersome, took an incredibly long time to adorn, and served no purpose other than turning a human being into a bauble to be admired.
There was no turning back now. His nerve had propelled him out the door, it could hold steady while he was sensible.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “He asked you to spy on me, didn’t he?”
Sherlock laughed and stuck to his water for the rest of the night.
Jim had finally warmed up to him aside from the occasional pleasantry. He was going to show his husband that there was absolutely nothing suspect with Jim’s intentions. At this point, he was going to make a friend out of James Moriarty if it was the last thing he did on God’s green earth.
The creature takes one more deep breath, curls in on itself, and
That was the result of Sherlock moving the toy with larger and firmer pushes. John feels fully fucked now, and he can't get enough of it. He keens again when Sherlock stops thrusting, just leaves it grinding on his gland.
“Young Watson is clearly good with his hands, better read than most peasants, and his constitution is clearly nothing to scoff at.”
And it definitely wasn’t. John wasn’t going to cheat on his wife just because he had found someone else.
He clutched the paper hard enough that it made a loud crackle. There was still no disturbance from the bed, and John had the fleeting thought to be grateful that Jim slept far sounder than his husband.
John wrapped her up in his arms and soundly kissed her. Mary blinked, and pulled back after a few seconds.
“I’d like to,” Sherlock answered, “if you’ll still have me. I’m sorry about earlier.”
"If you don't compromise with me, I'll do what you've been trying to prevent this whole time. I'll break down."
Sherlock gives him the perfect opportunity for wording when he says, "Why, John? Willing to make another bargain for her safety? I was hoping to deprive you of sight, hearing and have you mute for a day. But after tonight I think it's not out of the question to extend it to a week." Sherlock moves his hands to pass his thumbs under John's eyes, and he's not entirely sure if the gesture was subconscious or not.
Molly blushed like she was embarrassed on their behalf. “Yes well, that’s kind of the point. Nobody even knew the kids were
The words must have been too soft for the inherent warning to register. Sherlock continued, “You barely acknowledge that she’s in the same room with you, there were indications in your kitchen that you’ve started to separate ‘his and hers’ plates like you’re flat mates instead of spouses, and I don’t even need to see your bed to know that you haven’t had sex in at least six months and that’s a generous estimate considering--”
"He must practice up to his capacity, then beyond his limits if he ever wants to become a renowned player." Sherlock moves his attention to a still packaged scalpel. He peels back the wrapping, letting the glare dance off of the fresh steel. Thoughts of slicing John, with dozens of little tiny cuts that would barely scar, make him inhale sharply.
“Yes, well,” John tried again, “hopefully this didn’t ruin your first impression entirely.”
But instead of lubing up his hand again, Sherlock leans down and takes John’s soft prick into his mouth. It’s enough of a shock that John kicks out one of his legs in reflex; with the sound of the chain overpowering Sherlock’s wet licking sounds.
Lestrade?" Sherlock sneered and Lestrade sighed deeply again and gazed helplessly at the ceiling.
As Sherlock’s prick left his lips, Moriarty released one hand from its death grip on John’s thighs to wrap around his stiff cock. Despite the heaviness to his frame, and his repeated loss of awareness, one part of him had clearly remained alert this entire time. John wasn’t sure if he could attribute it to a devilish concoction or his own weak flesh, but it hardly mattered. With a few strokes and Jim shuddering to climax in his body, he quickly crested until everything was bathed in a blinding white of pleasure.
Sherlock blinked at him. His wings rustled against each other. “It’s interesting that you’ve noted on the novelty,” he said, “most of my kind can only alter their size, not their appearance.”
expel him when he’s given a microphone.”
“You’re the one seeing ghosts John.”
John spots a few more cars along the way, but he avoids all of them. His paranoia is ratcheted up to eleven now. And he has no idea if the man was telling the truth that there's a police station near here. He finds a tube station, but it's closed for reconstruction. John nearly rips the sign to bits.
“If one doesn’t know where to begin, one can hardly be expected to learn anything,” Jim had explained in his offer for tutelage, “fortunately for you, I happen to know quite a thing or two about human anatomy.”
He stood over John, his candid expression expecting an equally honest answer. Sherlock suddenly appeared to become occupied over the differences in detail from seeing John so closely. A pale hand tipped with claws came up to trace the bones in John’s cheek.
John will be honest, this isn't the first time he's had a prick down his throat. Having a gay sister led to curiosity in his university years, and the adrenaline and pressure of not knowing which day was your last blurred a lot of lines in the army. It is, however, the first time he's been utterly disgusted by it.
He fisted his hands to avoid wrapping them around the man’s throat. “I anticipate, that following the same steps that I made in discovering your foul deeds, will emphasize why I was driven to my actions against you. Since you seem determined to discredit them as wild and violent ravings.”
Sherlock sighed in exasperation, “Fine, I’ll get it out at least, but you should come with me so you can conclusively prove to yourself that I’m not hiding a corpse in your car.”
An intervention of some kind happens, because Sherlock thrusts harshly a few more times, then shudders violently. A warm sensation fills John, and just like that, the arousal crashes down into a bottomless well of disgust. Sherlock has a few post coital thrusts, and pulls out of John. He doesn't move from his prone position of John's back. Sherlock is perfectly happy to just breathe in John for now. It's when John starts shifting uncomfortably that Sherlock moves away. With a lingering caress on John's back, Sherlock dresses again just as quickly.
Sherlock dribbles more lube onto John’s urethra, and the nasty sensation is tempered by a quick stroke to his dick.
Sherlock practically growled in impatience and waved one of the waiters over. The man rushed over, almost tripping in his haste. "Y-yes, sir? What can I get for you?"
Sherlock's eyebrows climb. He had known he was old, older than he looked most certainly, but this completely defied expectation. By appearances alone, the gargoyle hardly looks older than fifty.
Sherlock ponders this, “Essentially,” he allows, “but again, social predilections place slow dancing in the top five percentile of a good anni-“
His silver eyes had taken on a sheen akin to a deep-sea fish or a light reflected in a cat’s eyes. It wasn’t immediately noticeable, but to him, his eyes might as well have been replaced with spotlights.
If this were a normal fight, he would be doing all of those things. Especially the begging. But it wasn’t normal. All John could do, as he stared out into the pouring rain and ignored his wife’s watering eyes, was say, “I am so sorry Mary. Just…be safe.”
Sherlock, in order to hear that noise again, gently gnawed over the spot. And he bit even harder when John’s arse began to rub against Sherlock’s erection. John’s hands, still pinned under Sherlock’s, began scratching at the bed in order to regain some sense of stability. Breathy gasps and moans were muffled when John buried his face into the coarse mattress.
“Shut up!”
Even his homeless network had been imploring him to seek out the infamous "Winged Vigilante". Floating through the underbelly of London was talk of a dark crusader that aided the helpless and struck terror into the hearts of the common thug. Sherlock dismissed it as the wishful thinking of the desperate, and the hallucinations of drunkards and schizophrenics. He had time for neither.
Each one Sherlock traced with his lips until it was as if he alone had raised the flesh.
The stale stench of tobacco ash hangs in the air. His laptop is located on the only clean surface. Newspaper clippings are tacked onto a board he hung above the mantle. This has been stabbed through with a knife that was attempting to disembowel the snide telegrams from Mycroft about his inability to keep a flatmate as well as a few red lettered bill notices.
Definitely not his cell then, his floor had been entirely even. Including the bathroom section. Why hadn't his captor just asked him to take a step up? He doesn't question it though. He doesn't want to be punished further for talking.
“Then offer it again,” Jim retorted, not tearing his gaze away once. “He’ll be much more receptive this time.”
“Ah,” Sherlock said with a false tone of realization, “or is it that I’m deviating from the usual placement?”
Soon they entered the building, and the sound of their steps echoed against the concrete. It wasn’t long before John saw his means of cover. Catwalks lined most of the upper level. It was heavily shadowed, it had plenty of boxes for additional stealth, he would be able to see and hear everyone on the ground floor, and very rarely did people think to look up when considering their surroundings.
“And have I John?” Sherlock asked as he took a sip from his glass.
“By the moon, I mean that was brilliant.”
John has to swallow several times before he manages to choke out, "How is this better? How is giving up now any better?"
“Sherlock, that’s enough.”
John crept steadily forward. The whispers had grown louder. He distantly realized that it wasn’t just one voice speaking to him, but several on top of each other, and they were all unfamiliar. In that instant, he almost wished for Harry’s wails over the indistinct strangers’ mutterings.
"I am sorry about this John, what it's led to," John's momentarily confused about what exactly he means before he keeps going "you shouldn't ever bring yourself harm for what we do John. There's nothing to be ashamed of."
Sherlock had learned that the best way to win those arguments was not to have them.
“No! I’m telling you they gave me a strange tincture. Made from this plant, I’m certain of it!” He yanked the accused flower from its bed. The roots curled out thick and pale, like grasping fingers that were picked clean.
"Hold out your hands." Sherlock commands, and John can feel his face pull back into a disbelieving grin.
That question continued to circle in his head as the water boiled. He filled his mug, waited for it to steep, and then added a glug or two of whiskey from a dusty bottle. He drank, and barely felt his tongue burn.
"You were the one who bloody well staged the whole thing! You could have busted me out at any time! But you left me to rot! I trusted you, you slimy git!"
He stays in the bathroom once the last bell rings, and heads over to Holmes' office when everything is relatively empty. He passes a few stragglers along the way, but they're too busy rushing to the bus or their friends to even give him a glance.
Sherlock’s face was taut with an uncertain frown. John kicked at him under the table, “Hey, Sherlock, I mean it. If he’d actually hurt me, I would let you know. Come on, this place smells amazing and I’m starving. Just don’t worry about it.”
"Oh?" John's grinning and he's waving at the driver, signaling they'll just be a moment. "What do people normally say?"
“I’m….not entirely sure what I’m looking at here.” John answers truthfully.
Sherlock’s fingers twisted in response, and John keened. “You don’t have to worry about that John, we’ve come up with another solution.” Sherlock nodded to the toy at his side.
The man twists beneath him, trying to get closer. Sherlock places a hand on the burning chest, stilling him. The race of John's heartbeat pumps loudly in Sherlock's ears, and he swallows more down. The bottle is close to half empty when he pulls it from his lips with a soft exhale.
John felt himself become encased and shrunken, as if the touch of the nothingness were the wrappings of his own corpse. He was being eclipsed, lost amongst all of the black. He was immobilized in the crushing pressure of the void. He felt it circle around his neck, and then
Sherlock finds it surreally beautiful and, as he shifts in his trousers, more than a little arousing. He can ignore the burn of his own desires for now, as the gargling sounds John is making are far more enthralling than an orgasm.
“So, you’re the one Gary’s harping on about. You’d think he was obsessed with you, the way he never shuts up.” The leader leaned forward and placed his elbows on the table. He ran his eyes over Sherlock’s shaking and skinny body. “Personally, I don’t see what has got his knickers so wadded. But, whatever, maybe you’re a right prick when you’re not out of your mind for some smack.”
Sherlock barely refrained from sneering his brother’s title, “The last thing His Majesty needs is another mouth to feed that’s good for nothing but—“he stopped himself from saying ‘becoming cannon fodder’ and quickly replaced it with, “riding into battle.”
It was a small offset compared to the rest of the greenhouse, yet still quite large. The door of it was padlocked shut, but John could make out shadows of plants past the opaque glass. John asked, “What’s this area?”
"Police, what's your emergency?"
"You two must have a lot in common then," Sherlock couldn't help but quip.
For a little while, John didn’t need the cane to walk. He wasn’t about to start signing up for marathons, but the small walks to and from his car without assistance felt like victories. Mary noticed the change and was thrilled by it.
Smiling, Sherlock repeated the action. Again, and again. When he was certain John was too far gone to do anything but listen, Sherlock opened his mouth to say, “I hope you’ll want to watch it with me, when we’re done.”
"Hm, I don't know Jim. Maybe he's just not,
“It’s an acquired thing,” John said as he drank from his own glass, “you get used to it. Plus, once you’re older, and trying to keep your head on straight around genius brats who like to try and take down criminal organizations by themselves, you won’t much care about how it tastes.”
But Sherlock just holds him in place as he slowly takes John apart. He doesn’t say anything, doesn’t indicate that John just committed a transgression by trying to push them away from something Sherlock clearly had planned for him. He just holds John in place as he continues to rub John’s insides.
Dread pools at the base of his spine when John dryly replies, "Ambidextrous."
“So, your brother is a wanker.”
John couldn’t help but scoff at that, “What could you possibly mean? Sherlock doesn’t need me here to survive.”
Who's to say Sherlock would still have that kind of access? Maybe he's relying on John's fear of being 'boxed up' again to even bother to check.
John stared into Sherlock’s eyes. He saw a fevered obsession and a desire to possess that would never be satisfied. John wondered if it had always been there, or if he had stoked it with his own desperate need for companionship. Had his actions, which had seemed so innocuous, sparked an instinct that the dragon couldn’t resist? Perhaps there was a very good reason that John had never heard of dragons falling in love.
John's snickering abruptly stops to become a loud groan. Jim protests the harsh treatment, "Oh, come off of it Sherlock, he was just having a bit of fun."
So while the thought of John covered in his essence, unable to completely wash it all away, is extremely appealing, Sherlock had begrudgingly given John the soap. He needs to start instilling a sense of gratefulness in John, according to his research. Also the reason for the unmolested breakfast. When Sherlock had opened the door, he'd been met with heavy silence. John was obviously in the bathroom, but the absolute lack of noise was odd. The only assurance he had that John was even alive was the sound of his breathing and the outline of his hunched form behind the curtain.
"Sherlock, wait, wait!" He pushes the man away, and Sherlock's too stunned to counteract. Since they've moved into Baker Street, John's never denied him sex. John hopes that means this will work in his favor. Quickly, John keeps talking, "What happens to Mary?" He really has no other way of phrasing that, otherwise he would've used it.
All too late he remembered the voices from the other day. The scratching, the pounding from the other side, the ghastly voices. Yet none of that happened now. John held the doorknob in his grip, but there was no sudden yank from the other side. There wasn’t a chorus of screeching triumph, or bloodcurdling laughter. Just the sound of his own breathing and the creaking hinges of the door as he swung it open.
John wondered which of them it had been. Had he been sodomized by his sister’s murderer, or did he merely seek out a friendship with him?
After a tortuously long time, Sherlock decides that John’s pliant body is finally ready. John shifts on the floor when those long fingers are pulled from his body, but Sherlock keeps a firm grip on his hip.
The landlady is also perfectly sweet. John tries to avoid as many conversations with her as possible for that very reason. Most of the time, he's just making excuses for his eccentric 'boyfriend'. "I think it's great that you boys have so much energy, but maybe not so loud and close to four in the morning, hmm?" John had sputtered, managed to get out a few nods and apologies before dashing up the stairs. He'd been beet red for two hours after that. He hadn't known how to explain to Mrs. Hudson that, when it comes to their agreement on sex, John isn't allowed to deny. Ever.
The sound of their heavy breathing brought John slowly back to his senses. The sweat and release of their bodies made the touching skin a sticky and uncomfortable affair. John couldn’t stop the lazy smile that spread across his face.
Panic overrides his dignity, and John protests aloud, "Sherlock, stop. Don't!" He is, of course, ignored. Sherlock winds the cord tighter, preventing movement but allowing blood flow. He secures it to the posts of their headboard, and then moves to other shoulder. Soon, John is lying face down on the bed, with his only available actions being to breathe and shift his head.
Sherlock's becoming a bit bored, he's sad to say. Oh, not bored by John, never bored by John. But the reactions are ones he's already seen, and he's eager to make John crumble. It's been mentioned that Sherlock is patient, but it really is only to a certain point until the greedy child within him takes over.
John tapped his fingers against the side of his thigh. No, that probably wasn’t a good idea. Given Sherlock’s insistence and near desperation, he would probably suggest that they immediately try to give ‘this’ a shot. Or maybe not. Maybe, if Sherlock was even half as serious as he seemed, he was adult enough to understand that forming a relationship wasn’t an option.
“I gathered that,” Mycroft dryly said, “but thankfully no wars
John was facing its back, and he could see a crown of spikes along the back of its head to protect the vulnerable nape.  Its back had no protection apart from its own thick hide. Its wings were settled flat at its side to avoid any irritating scratching against tree bark. They were long enough that the bottom ends trailed through the mud of the riverbank the beast was guzzling from.
The door clicked shut behind her.
The words don't really register in John's mind until he hears Jim get up from his seat. There's a creaking, and a warm body is suddenly pressed against his back. Jim is kneeling behind him on the large desk, and another pair of hands appear around his chest. Slowly, Jim begins unbuttoning the uniform white shirt from the top. His chin digs into John's shoulder, watching the progress while Sherlock continues snogging the student.
"Bit wider, please." He hesitates, but John does what he's told. If what he thinks is going to happen is going to happen, then maybe John will bite this time.
As they step closer to the box, John finally registers what's about to happen. He tenses in Sherlock's grip, and starts to pull away. He can't go back. Not in there. Not alone with the shadows again. John doesn't even try to stop the whimper that comes from his throat. A firm grip wraps around his waist to pull him closer. John struggles more. He can't go back in. He won't. Goddammit he won't.
His urge to punch the man had at least disappeared, which was a welcome relief. And it was enough for John to want to continue their conversation, hopefully the both of them calmer from their self-imposed separation. He was going to sway Sherlock to his side or by God he would apply without his approval.
He looks around, trying to find the source. There, above his head. The ventilation shaft is releasing a steady hissing sound.
But this one just did.
John's rage hasn't dissipated at all. It's grown. His white hot fury has now been forged into cold steel, ready to be used. It's at this moment, when eating salty crisps and taking sips of water in a bleached white uniform, that John realizes what it really means to hate someone. This is why he hasn't heard the Voice, why his hand has not shaken since he's woken up. His enemy was once a nameless and faceless group of people shooting rounds at him and his brothers-in-arms. Now, his enemy has a very distinctive name, the angles of his face are forever burned into his brain, and he has a bloody trenchcoat like any proper super-villain.
“Uh, what- “John stammers, his sleeve rubbing away any trace of Sherlock’s saliva. That’s it then. He has his answer.
If John was lucky, he would only have his teeth kicked out.
When Sherlock’s fingers pulled away, John keened from the loss. Until he felt the familiar heat and length of his husband’s prick against his waiting body. John’s hands scrambled to Sherlock’s shoulders. He eagerly braced himself, murmuring agreements and pleas with every slow inch that made its way inside of him. Sherlock’s cock rested fully inside, and John waited for the thrusts that would push his pleasure into sublime territory. He didn’t move.
The line cut out. John stared at his phone as the screen shined back at him. For a long number of seconds, John considered smashing the thing to pieces. He settled for kicking at the sofa.
Curious, Sherlock asked, "Is that what you did for Sebastian?"
The door shut, and John was left to stew in his own indecision. Sherlock had explicitly asked him not to act without getting his information. But John couldn’t ignore that he’d just gone into a room unprotected and alone, with two people on the outside ready to rush in and intervene, quite possibly violently, if necessary.
Sherlock smirks down at John, “It doesn’t take someone of my intellect to know what people consider romantic. And anniversaries are dates where one partner goes above and beyond for the other. Hardly a difficult leap.”
, the quote floats unbidden from his mind palace. While John is a masterpiece waiting to be brought to life with the right pressure, Sherlock would never equate him with an angel. A symbolic representation of purity, of unattainable perfection, and unblemished righteousness, John certainly is not.
John’s neck arches back as he groans in relief, his cock spurting his come in thick white lines over his belly and leaking onto Sherlock’s hand. While his body trembles in a cresting orgasm, John can’t feel the euphoria that comes from release. Instead panic quickly overtakes his mind when he senses the ebb of a much stronger impulse grab his body.
This whole time, the vibrator has still been turned on, though it's only with the sudden rush of endorphins that John is made aware of this fact. The pain is somehow lessened while being heightened. He caught between the agony in his shoulder and the ecstasy everywhere else. John feels like he's starting to catch on to the way the game is played tonight.
“You don’t normally ask for permission,” John sniped. “No, no no,” his hand shot out to block Sherlock’s entrance, “that wasn’t an invitation.”
Not true. It's not true.
He’d been on the brink before John had tried to foolishly relieve himself, so it doesn’t take much before Sherlock is back at the edge. It doesn’t help matters that John is undulating onto his cock and away from his hand.
It takes him three point five seconds to recognize the sound of a gun being clipped.
Of course Sherlock had been joking, just like he had been when they’d first met. Sherlock was just prone to inappropriate jokes, although John wouldn’t be surprised if Sherlock just didn’t understand the contextual consequences.
This time, he dug far deeper than before.
Sherlock's quite at a loss of what to do. He'd wanted to interrogate him, find out everything he could before the sun rose again or he fled back into obscurity. But here, in his flat, it all seems so very real; and he's having a rather hard time processing the information that a mythical creature is standing in his living room.
This was an easy enough thing to cover up. He doubted John would ever notice. And if he did, he could sham experimenting with different transmutations. Easy enough to believe that Sherlock would gamble his own eyes to try and see in the dark. Perhaps John would find it alluring.
“Shut up,” John warned.
Sherlock finally lets go when he reaches the end, and John lets out a soft, "God," of relief. He still feels weirdly penetrated, a constant ache at the end and base of his penis. If he hadn't just emptied his bladder, he would think he'd have to go again. A slight shift moves the thing inside of him, and John tenses in fear. He's a doctor, and Sherlock has performed admirably for what is (presumably) his first time. But images of tearing and a cracked tube still bounce around in his skull.
"Not to worry Mrs. Hudson. I was just about to give him a call with some developments. But I need the rest of the night to myself, if you don't mind."
It was an argument John had no hope of winning. Their assurances that they understood John’s initial point of view only solidified the confidence of their own perspectives.  Both men said that they knew John’s grievances, and saw no fault in them. So they would do their utmost to prove him wrong.
As he ran, John suddenly became aware of another large problem. He had no way of getting down. Oh, there was sure to be a ladder up ahead, but that left him wide open as an easy target. Even if the kid had shitty aim, something moving slowly down a predicted path would be much easier to shoot than someone running for their life.
Help. Help me, please. Somebody, anybody.
He went over to the cabbie, and told him the address as Sherlock slid into the backseat. During the ride, Sherlock's gloved fingers rubbed together underneath his chin. His arm was propped up on the door, ready to sprint out at moment's notice.
A fingernail pressed into John’s nipple, and he jerked between them.
“I already am a man,” Sherlock said. He slowly turned around, and John was unable to identify the teenager’s expression. It was too hopeful and soft to have a name.
“Someone’s aggressive tonight,” Moriarty commented, “still feeling a bit angry at our potential absconder, Sherlock?”
"Look, don't, uh. Don't do that again." John folds his wings protectively around himself, keeping them close to his body.
They're tiny figures, vaguely humanoid, with odd lumps on their backs. Sherlock picks up one, a crudely carved hunk of marble. There are two lumps on the back, and the feet seem to have claws. There are two arms, extended and poised as if ready for attack. It's making tiny replicas of itself?
John refused to weep, but it felt worse to have the hot tears threaten to fall as he looked into Sherlock’s beseeching gaze. “I understand this is difficult for you to accept,” Sherlock said, “but you belong here with me John. I can’t risk you injuring yourself when I’m not around. If something were to happen to you I-” he seemed unable to continue. His hands came down on John’s shoulders to steady himself. He went on, “I don’t know if I would be able to survive that. So, for now, until I can trust you alone again, this is how things will be.”
"Hm, yes," Sherlock is really concentrated if he doesn't even mock John for his repetition, "We're almost out of milk, and you need a few ingredients if you want to try that recipe you bookmarked the other day." The one John bookmarked on his laptop, not a cookbook. He's not offended, as that is the pinnacle of useless arguments.
Molly kept talking to keep him from going on a rampage, “It’s all fixed now! Apparently, the paper put in the part about how Sherlock had been undercover, and everyone put two and two together. He’s going to ask Sherlock to be a guest speaker for an anti-drug campaign, now that everyone thinks we desperately need it.”
Despite being naked, John felt completely warm. He moved like a creature that had never been introduced to independent motion.
,” John repeated incredulously. He clung to anger to avoid the sadness crystallizing his heart, and the anxious suspicion churning in his gut over Sherlock’s motivations in being deliberately belittling. “You think it’s idle fancy that causes me to lose the recollection of getting into bed. You think that boredom has been giving me restless sleep and dizzy spells? I truly wish it was just my own imagination Sherlock. But to receive so many ailments on top of each other is the cause of
John sighs, disheartened by his skim options. He's startled when Sherlock walks through the door, another movie in hand. This time John doesn't wait for Sherlock to pop in the DVD before sitting down.
John would be completely under their control. There would be no one to listen to him, no one to take him seriously. He’d be the raver who saw ghosts, in the care of his saintly husband and comrade. He would be entirely alone.
“It’s stupid of me, I know. It’s utterly fucking mad. You’re so—and I’m just--. Not to mention the school, and the age difference, and the rest of it. But I love you. There’s no helping it, I’m over the goddamn moon for you. All I can think about is seeing you again. Whenever you talk it feels like you’re giving me a privilege. The fact that you wanted to be my friend was astonishing, more than that, it was downright unbelievable. And I know, I
“It’s a cop!” One of them yelled. John briefly considered trying to use that to his advantage, but it was dashed by Snow’s voice yelling, “Get the both of them! Fucking go go go!”
There’s a moment where Sherlock is stunned. He needs to remember to expect the unexpected around John. Then he’s pressing John back against the door and all that rings through his mind is
Usually, Sherlock would only be slightly intrigued that someone could bend so much to someone's will. Now, he wanted trade secrets. Jim gave a lingering look of appreciation to his pet, then turned his attention to Sherlock. Suddenly, it was just the two of them having a conversation, even with others in the room. To outsiders, it would be like watching two demons retreat back to their plane of existence. Leaving behind the creatures that had no hope of understanding them or reaching their level. Nothing existed now but their continuous mind games and banter.
The sound prompted Sherlock to remove his hand from John’s wrists, only to wrap it around the boy’s erection.  John gasped, and remained slumped forward. The sensations coursed through him, turning his body pliant and making movement impossible.
Sherlock places a final kiss on the scar, and moves away. He leans back for a second, his mind swimming with information and possibilities. He's had John at his mercy for days. He's taken advantage of this. But this is the first time that Sherlock can feel everything wicked about him pouring over the surface. So far he's been cautious, he's held back. He doesn't need to tonight. And it's a good thing that John can't see the grin that comes from that thought.
One of their servers wheels out a tray, and another one discreetly sweeps up John’s shattered glass. Underneath the domed silver lid are two small steaming and stuffed birds. The sound of the food and utensils hitting the plate feels like the loudest noise imaginable. Another glass is placed on John’s side. It’s silently filled with more of the amber liquid, and both of the men leave without comment.
The sight made something oddly masquerading as affection move through Sherlock’s chest. But he paid it no heed.
Then he heard Sherlock choke on words, and the grip on his hand became strong enough that John seriously wondered if he would have to worry about broken fingers. He felt Sherlock’s cock jump inside of him, which made John twitch. Wet heat filled him in unreached places. John shivered at the illicit invasion.
"It's just a phone call, Sherlock," John murmurs, "You can monitor it, for God's sake. She just wants to know if I'm okay."
"That...was amazing."
Then the crop sings through the air, striking John directly across his nipple. John rocks from the force of his own jolt. He chokes around the bit as it slides further into his mouth. He can barely sputter around the plastic. Every twitch of muscle pulls his body tighter and tighter against itself.
But John catches the look of mirth in Sherlock's eyes and frowns anyway. "If you weren't barking mad enough to carve a hole in your own ceiling, this wouldn't be happening," he hisses.
Wonderful as it is to kiss John, Sherlock moves down, following the trails of his hands. He nibbles and sucks on John's neck and clavicle, and another glorious sound is brought from the doctor. John's hands, which had previously been idly by his sides, come up to grip Sherlock's shoulders.
But for John, it was essentially too late. Now the situation that had supposedly plagued Sherlock for months was switched around. John had no indication if Sherlock’s feelings would be returned anymore. Or if he would still want to remain friends afterwards. All he had was hope. And that wasn’t enough to put him through this. Not if it meant that he would destroy whatever little was left of their companionship.
The man calmly says, "It's not mate. It's just the only way you got if you still want to be human."
“I can assure you that you’re allowed to say no. We’ll simply go home now if you wish, but I have gathered that this sort of evening often includes dancing. And, admittedly,” Sherlock’s expression becomes beatific; “I would simply savor the pleasure of dancing with you.”
"Right, okay, yeah," John stops talking before he begins babbling affirmations. Really? That's it? John almost wants to ask if Sherlock's playing a joke, but he doesn't want to push it. He's not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. These days he's just incredibly suspicious about it. John places his dishes in the sink, and goes to take a shower. He showers quickly, one ear out to hear the door open. It's almost anticlimactic when nothing happens.
John sighed, but didn’t press it. In a way, Sherlock had a point. Besides, the idea of trying to get Sherlock to behave like a ‘normal’ teenager seemed…stifling somehow.
Sherlock blinks in surprise, clearly not expecting those to be John’s first words. He responds with, “…I hadn’t planned very far ahead.”
John breathed out for three solid seconds. He unclenched his jaw, reached down, and shredded the picture in two.
He tilted his head in different directions, curious to see how the harsh light of the bathroom bounced off of them. Eventually, he shrugged and dried himself off.
Of course, that would only happen if they could get away from the general public. The next day, John was nearly hounded by the press standing outside of the school, and his coworkers and the students were no better.
"Oh," Sherlock interrupts, "you mean this?" He pulls out a small recorder from one of his numerous pockets, and hits a button.
Sherlock rushed ahead with another point, “You know that I do need someone for the more tedious work. Along with offering me insight that isn’t horrendously asinine. Give me the privacy I asked for, and I can guarantee that you would never find a more suitable companion.
Sherlock is panting by the end, for the last part had almost been entirely shouted. During his tirade, he hadn’t realized how much this gargoyle perplexed him until just now. There had been the thrill of discovery, the disbelief at his actual existence, but now there was frustrated anger. He had just laid out most of this creature’s history, and it was infuriating to Sherlock. By all rights, the gargoyle should be an embittered and heartbroken mess. Not a well meaning vigilante that lived up to higher codes of morality than any human Sherlock had ever met.
John spits out the blood from his bit tongue, and moves as fast as he can.
But the smile quickly vanished when Sherlock realized something. John had been staring at the ceiling, had he been staring at the ceiling the whole time?
The man doesn't let up from his attention on John's nipples. He reaches his hands down to John's wrapped thighs, and grips. Sherlock thrusts, matching John's aborted movements. John keens in his throat, and his hands move from Sherlock's shoulders to his dark curls. He tangles his fingers in the dark hair, and shouts when Sherlock bites down.
“I’m the one who made the tip about the disturbance. My name is Sherlock Holmes; I gave it to the dispatcher.”
Sherlock dragged his lips up John’s neck and nipped his lobe in amusement. John reached around to scratch his nails down that pale back. He shivered when Sherlock growled in his ear.
When John was inside, he made certain Mary wasn’t home before he took a match to the photograph pieces. He watched as they turned to flaky ash in the kitchen sink.
Sherlock has an idea that his John might become nervous about being submersed into water after this. His ramblings had involved something about the ocean.
He looked away, like he was ashamed at having been caught. Mary threw up her hands, and walked off.
With his tongue and teeth he leaves little nips. Sherlock memorizes each wrinkle and twist with his tongue until he has to make a separate file in his brain labeled "John's Scar And Textures Therein". John's desperate groans and the muffled buzzing become background noise to the new mapping of an area Sherlock hasn't yet explored. Then, once Sherlock has soaked the wound in his spit, he bites down. Hard.
Eventually, they did. By that time the sun had peeked over the horizon, and John felt like his eyes had dried inside of his head.
Sherlock has nothing to say to that, but he doesn't attempt to hide his smile this time. The gargoyle reaches the last step, and has a brief moment to look relaxed, before his foot predictably goes through a weak spot in the wood.
When John tries to pull away, even with the pain it causes his shoulder, Sherlock catches him by the back of the head. Gripping the golden strands, Sherlock shallowly thrusts forward. It's a bit of an empty sensation, since John can't even suck him properly like this. But John's stuttering tongue and clicking noises from the back of his throat combine into one glorious component of pleasure.
“Please, just, let me know you’re alright.” He pleaded to the wood grain.
Sherlock spins around, grinning widely. Despite his annoyed tone, the gargoyle is shuffling his feet slightly, as if he was embarrassed that it took him so long.
"It a pointless effort to struggle John. You might as well go along and enjoy what's about to happen." John's about to slur a few words of angry protests, but he cuts off when he sees what's in the room.
The rain is accusatory. It sounds like hundreds of malicious children chucking pebbles at their window. Some of it makes it down the chimney, which causes the burning logs to hiss and spit in outrage.
John pulled each one out of the file. They were dated every two years, all from different parts of the globe. Some were women, a few were men, and there was always a nuptial agreement of a full seizing of monetary liquidations to Sherlock or Jim.
With those words, John felt the trap snap closed around him. ‘I’m sorry Harry,’ he thought to himself, ‘I’m so sorry.’
Sherlock pulls the sound out one painstaking centimeter at a time. John’s almost sobbing from oversensitivity, and the sound curls deliciously through Sherlock’s veins. When it’s finally out of him, John groans in relief like he’s been pulled back from death.
Marble, mostly, though there are variations in the striation patterns. Slate, here and there and phyllite in the minority. There in an assortment of sizes, but next to them is a smaller and polished pile. There's a third mound, and Sherlock kneels down in excitement when he notices that they're actually shaped like something.
John had smiled wanly, knowing it was more of a compliment than an admonishment. Still, he had not been satisfied with Sherlock’s dismissal. How could he feel right about this when three men were dead, and he had been in the center of it?
When she left, the empty office seemed oddly loud.
John tries again to get some answers, "Look, um, what are you doing here?"
“Don’t look at it John,” Sherlock murmured, close enough that their foreheads touched, “just look at me.”
“Not happening,” John declared. The two guards, or more accurately, bean poles with bad acne, caught up to them. Not surprising, since they were both running towards them rather than away.
“Look, John,” Sherlock urged, “open your eyes and stare into it. I want to be able to watch you come undone, over and over again for me. I want to watch what how your face twists, what angles your body writhes and how many times you thrust against empty air when you-“
“-my husband is tragically out of his wits and I’m here to take him home,” Sherlock’s words brought John back to the present.
"Ah, it's good to see you're awake John." Sherlock said, offering a small smile. Inwardly, Sherlock was cursing himself. He had hoped for a few more minutes of unconsciousness so he could be the first thing that John saw in his new home. Sherlock would have to settle for the recordings again. If it wouldn't be incredibly inconvenient, Sherlock would be near John constantly, so he could never miss important moments like these again.
“What did he say to you? Did he threaten you? Whatever it is, he’s bluffing, or lying. You don’t have to leave if he’s paid you or anything, it’s not worth it in the long run. Whatever he told you is a lie. No matter what he said.”
He slides the paper over, and starts with the first question. Time breezes by, with John's voice being the only sound in the room. John had studied very hard for this exam, and it shows in the way he enthusiastically answers each question. He slips a few times, overcome by anxiety every time he looks up and sees icy blue and deep black eyes staring at him. He takes a deep, calm breath, thinks over the question, then starts over from where he stutters.
“Fuck,” John gasped. And either the words or the effort of kneeling was too much to handle anymore, because John collapsed forward, supporting himself on his hands at the last second. The sight of John on all fours was the last thing Sherlock could take.
"John," he answers with a tight smile. She must see the apprehension, and is properly confused by it.
Next, he tosses useless books into the unlit fireplace. He throws the journal on the growth rates on sunflowers a little harder than necessary. This results in the book flopping back out, and Sherlock picks it up and savagely rips it to shreds. The fluttering paper does nothing to calm his racing mind, and he growls.
The abrasive face of the cliff wall dug into John's soft palms and the soles of his feet. His muscles were sore with the effort of scaling the sheer face, but he couldn't turn back now. Not when he'd come so far.
Sherlock’s hand slides over John’s, rubbing the back of it soothingly until his fingers uncurl to stop making indentations in his palm. Sherlock laces their finger together, and John feels the weight of everything pressing against his mind leave in a poisonous exhale.
Sherlock smirked, and he looked deeply pleased. He rocked back and forth a little bit before he said, “Well then, I’ll see you at school tomorrow. Until next time, Doctor Watson.”
He realized the boy was responding, and shoved away his storming thoughts.
John sighed and reached in for another file. He opened it up and almost immediately closed it, as they bore the standard seal of official state documents. This implied legality and would therefore be worthless to him. Then the words ‘marriage certificate’ caught up to him, and he froze.
The violin music screeched to a stop. He didn’t look away from the spot on his wall that he’d been staring at for the past, he checked his watch, two hours.
He felt Jim’s stubble scrape along his cheek. When John gasped in overwrought pleasure, Jim’s grip at his wrists tightened. Jim growled, suddenly moving off of John to discard his own clothes.
John waits for Sherlock's response, braces for rejection, and receives a wry, "You really should have gone into politics. Mycroft would
“No, please stay. I would actually like your advice on something.”
Everywhere he went he was asked endless questions, bombarded with congratulations, and told how proud they were that he had managed to ‘set Sherlock straight’. Those last comments had him gritting his teeth, but he bore it well.
John doesn’t get the chance to be hysterical about that like he wants to. Sherlock is already pulling him closer and leaning down so John doesn’t have to strain his neck. The hand on John’s waist slides up to cup the back of his skull, while the other lets go of John’s hand to press against his back.
"You will get to come John. You've done so well, that was very good of you," Sherlock slides in easily, and his tirade is cut short from a moan. "But remember why you're here John, I own you. I own your pleasure. And you took that from me, so now you're being punished." With each sentence end and beginning he slides into John languorously. Each stroke is a torture to his abused body, but it's also the most amazing sensation John's ever experienced. He can't shift in this position, can't gain any friction. He's forced to stay exactly where he is, take the pleasure when it comes to him. And a tiny part of John is starting to like that idea.
A man in a booth with his rugby mates was clearly trying to suppress his sexual attraction towards his best friend. Perhaps an entertaining thing to exploit at another time, but trivial. Dull, dull, dull, boring, easy, possible-no he's almost criminally stupid, god no, no, Christ what had happened to the populace while he was away?
Sherlock huffs against his nape, biting at every patch of skin he can see. The slap of his hips has lost any constructed tempo, dissolving into a primal urge to fuck.
John shifted restlessly underneath Sherlock. His hips tried to grind upward to find some sort of stimulation, but Sherlock’s hands were suddenly there, pinning him down onto the bed. The denial of friction made John whine helplessly. He tugged on Sherlock’s hair, trying to encourage him to move. The pulls were gentle, far from a harsh tug that would cause any hint of pain.
Sherlock pressed his wrist against John’s open mouth. Instead of the taste of copper, the blood was rich and spiced like mulled wine. A sulfuric hint had John spluttering. The blood traced a path in his throat and dripped down his chin. John’s face wrinkled in displeasure, his atrocious situation forgotten as he demanded, “Why did you do that?”
John picks up on his point, "You once had me get your phone out of your own pocket because you were 'busy' with your microscope, while I was walking around the house without being able to use my hands. I had to get it out with my teeth."
Rock doesn't breathe.
Until Jim speaks up, "No fair Sherlock. You've blocked my view."
“Ah, I am glad to see that you two are enjoying yourselves!” A voice above John’s head rumbled like it was meant to be shouted over the busy clamor of markets, but had been constrained to indoor volume.
“Always glad to assist our resident golden boy. What’s been troubling you?”
For a few moments, John was so stunned he was entirely without words. “What could you possibly mean by that?”
He checks out, and leaves the store feeling some weight lifted off of his shoulders. When he gets home, there's a note from Mrs. Hudson saying she's taking a short vacation with her sister. Good, the woman deserves some time off. God knows John should be the only one that has to put up with him. As he comes up the stairs, he hears Sherlock still in the kitchen. The glass is clinking with more enthusiasm than usual. Either he's frustrated with the results, or he's getting close to his outcome.
“None of that John, you’ll stain the carpet,” Sherlock chided him. It was the last thing he heard.
In confusion, John blinked the sweat from his eyes to look the other man in the face, “What?”
John catches a sharper smile cross Sherlock’s mouth before he’s being tormented with fleeting touches across his stomach and ribs all over again. John quickly discovers that helplessly laughing while feeling disgusted is a very strange sensation. And it’s emphasized when Sherlock begins to stroke him with one hand while continuing to tickle him with the other.
He got close enough to Sherlock that he tried to loom over him. It was only mildly accomplished because Sherlock was trying to be so pathetically small. John’s eye twitched, but his hands remained steady.
When he stepped out of the bathroom, Mary was waiting for him in the hall. She had a defensive posture, but she tried to make it more open. John, in return, didn’t immediately flee to the room that was now his and his alone.
His toes dig into plush carpet, and it's such a sensory rush that John nearly buckles. It suddenly comes to him that the hallway smells like cinnamon, and he's not sure if this means he'll love the smell or hate it for the rest of his life. If he has a very long future in the first place. Not if he doesn't
“Where are we going?”
“What?!” John was wide awake now, twisting on the bed until he was staring wide eyed at Sherlock. “What happened?!”
It was possible that the main entrance was on the opposite side of the building, but John didn’t like that idea even if there was one. The obvious entrance was more likely to be guarded, even if ‘guarded’ meant a group of gangly teenagers.
Sherlock’s eyes sharpened across John’s hesitation. He propped his elbows on the table, and laced his hands together. “I would never kill you John,” he says with utter finality.
At first, he was entirely unassuming. His clothes weren’t ragged, but they were rough, and worn down from long use. The tanned skin, corded muscle, and the evidence of calluses on his hands all pointed towards a farm hand.
filed wasn’t an issue. It wasn’t.
“How are you feeling?” Sherlock asked as he went to his husband’s side, “Your episode caused quite the stir within the household today. You couldn’t be roused for anything. Jim even tried to ride into town to fetch the physician. Thankfully the butler persuaded him to have the carriage prepared instead. Moriarty is awful on horseback.”
John didn’t need the light of a candle to know of the smug expression his husband was trying to hide in his pillow. He rolled his eyes, and playfully smacked Sherlock’s bared back.
Sherlock breathes deeply a few times on the doorstep of the dingy apartments. The cab is idling, a siren of a warm engine in the damp London night. Sherlock should wait until morning, or even tomorrow night to be safe, but he knows that John will follow him even now. Today's, no yesterday's, display of loyalty proved that. John has formed just as strong a bond as Sherlock has, and he plans on exploiting that without regret. While Sherlock does want this to go smoothly, he is a little disappointed at how easy this will prove to be.
John rolls his shoulders back when Sherlock’s done, and thinks that a warm shower will cure any lingering stiffness. Sherlock is always thorough when it comes to taking care of his things.
They fell asleep together like that, curled up and more content than either had dared to hope for.
John said, “We always do. Yet I wouldn’t alter it for anything.”
The darkness and the click of the door disorients John. After clearing his throat, John rasps out, "Sherlock?" but there is no response. He's alone in here. Alone with the heat and his insatiable need to feel
John’s not quite sure if the sounds he’s making are from pleasure or from laughter, but they both make him breathy and cause him to fruitlessly shift and squirm. Sherlock tilts his head thoughtfully, looking at John slowly coming undone under his hands.
John breathed against the rocks. Dust flew back into his face, stinging his eyes. His arms trembled from his clinging grip. The balls of his feet were hot with blisters. Grit stuck to his sweaty forehead when he leaned it against the wall. He glanced up at the opening, and his heart sank when he saw that he still had a great distance to go. He groaned in frustration.
“Seems like this place is just as restless as everywhere else,” John pointed out. “You did have school kids pushing drugs to other students.”
He gave John a brief, “I shall see you tonight,” and closed the door behind him.
The room rang with the silence that followed his outburst. John took a deep breath and willed the panicked clamoring in his head to stillness.
John had it in him to smile tightly in humor, but that was it. It brought him no pleasure to know that Sherlock was in bad spirits because of something he felt so strongly about.
John's palms are sweating, and he can feel his heartbeat in his ears. He's really acting like this is a first date. With dawning horror, John realizes that his anger, which has kept him going, is slowly dimming in intensity. John nearly sobs with the epiphany.
He folded his hands together, “Just so we’re on even footing, you can call me Mr. Snow.” John choked back his snort, “Now then, Sherlock, what brings you to my humble place of business?”
"By sleeping for years over the decades," the gargoyle answers like it's the most obvious thing in the world.
“What?” Sherlock shrugged, “I told you I had to get ready.”
" Sherlock stepped closer to the desk. Seb followed, but didn't stop him. Sherlock didn't move toward Jim, just slammed his hands on the surface.
“Visions,” Sherlock repeated blandly. The distanced tone embarrassed John almost more than outright derision. At least then his troubles would be worth the consideration for scorn.
Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. Somehow, John knew he was committing this exact moment to memory. There was going to be a part of that monumental brain that would be dedicated to preserving this exact second in all of its perfection.
Again, the soft whisper slid through his ears, as gentle and startling as a cold caress. He whirled around to face the noise, but nothing was there.
This close, Sherlock ached to kiss John, but he refrained. That would be for another time when John was awake. For when he could kiss John without fear of being bitten for it. Sherlock stuffed himself back in his trousers, and unbuckled John. He pulled up John's pants, and left grinning. John was forever proving to be a fascinating addition to his life. Sherlock couldn't wait for tomorrow.
“I don’t enjoy it when you leave,” Sherlock confessed. He was in his human form, and the both of them were enjoying the sunlight on their naked skin. John looked up at him. He didn’t pretend to be ignorant to Sherlock’s meaning or to lighten the mood with a flippant jest.
He would just need to have it examined. Then he’d know for sure.
John turned around to look at the home he had tried to make with his wife. It looked like a hollow shell. The furniture, art, the countless things that they had collected over the years, all of it looked as sterile and impersonal as a museum.
John wiggled out a loose brick from the greenhouse, and flung it at the door. The glass cracked like broken illusions, but didn’t shatter.  He picked it up and hurled it with all of his might. The crack spread to form a spider’s web. This time, when he threw it while thinking of sweet murmurs under bedsheets and promises of never leaving, it fell like a tower constructed out of sand.
It couldn’t come from there. Sherlock had said that those plants were exclusively poisonous. Why would Jim be breeding a tea that came from poison? Unless they were trying to—
John gritted his teeth. “Seriously, Sherlock, how is this going to help anything?”
John shook it off. He was just tired and strung out on adrenaline. Once he got some sleep, he’d be fine.
The Voice stops, but it's replaced by something else. It's dark here. So dark and so very damp. It's cloistering, choking. He can't breathe. He feels death circle around his chest and squeeze like a long forgotten creature of the sea.
“Moriarty is referring to the fact that I knew about the string of violent robbers that had been happening in the town. I apologize, John. I didn’t inform you because I didn’t want to frighten you needlessly. Apparently, I need not have worried about your safety.”
As John awoke, he was certain that he had never felt a worse discomfort. He ached from head to toe. Perhaps he had been split down the middle and then sewn back together, for that was the only sensible explanation for his stinging.
John drops his head. Great, he's disappointed both of his favored teachers. Fantastic.
John leans against the door while Sherlock exchanges a few parting instructions with the driver. As they cross the threshold with Sherlock closing and locking the door behind them, John felt a little bit of weight ease itself from his shoulders.
“It didn’t record.”
The thought spends him spiraling back down into panic. No. He can't hurt Harry. He can't hurt his sister. John starts banging the surface again, "Sherlock! Don't hurt her! You hear me? Don't you lay a finger on her!"
After a day of hunting down the mugging leader and ensuring the rude cabbie's death, Sherlock had decided to hold off on bringing John home for a little while.
“I saw it!” John pointed to the papers strewn about the floor, “I saw the mortuary report, it all but stated that my sister had been murdered. There was a note attached to keep the hellish thing as a source of blackmail! I saw it!”
In the span of two stuttered heart beats, Sherlock glanced down at John’s lips and then back up at his eyes.
"Hello, I've just been," Okay, Jesus, how does he explain this without sounding insane? "kidnapped. I need to talk to a policeman. I know my attacker."
“He would need to have an established and trustworthy relationship to a former delinquent of one of those schools. Someone who was young enough to appeal to your subordinates, but old enough that he could be trusted with the responsibility of a drug smuggling operation. Someone like you, Mister Charles Pierce.”
"Look at him,
What makes it even more unbearable is the fact that the hallucinations aren't always frolicking with sea creatures. Sometimes he is actually drowning. Or being crushed to death by some forgotten deep sea monster. Other times he's back in Afghanistan, unable to help anyone in this box. But he can hear the war waging outside, good people under fire, his friends being blown to bits. And no matter how loud he screams, or how much he begs, no one will kill him.
The funeral clothes were well into tatters now. Strips of flesh clung to her exposed bones. The veil covered her face, only to courteously spare John the decayed visage of his only sister.
Once more, he bumped into Lestrade and motioned with his head towards the wall with the odd markings. "There's something on the back wall you might want to see."
It wasn’t entirely true, but call it sedative or poison, he’d been drugged against his will.
Sherlock watches for a considerable amount of time, before finally moving into action. The soft, wet sounds of kissing permeate the room as Sherlock reaches the drawer that contains the lubricant. He's quiet in its retrieval and sliding the drawer back into place. He doesn't want to startle John, who's jumpy enough as it is.
, and John’s breath constricted in his chest out of eagerness instead of fear.
Gently, he reaches out with his bare hands, and grasps John's shoulders. Although the man has only been imprisoned for a short time, the stress has taken its tole. His bones are slightly more pronounced, and there's a weariness to John that was never there before. Sherlock loves it.
“Hm? Oh, right. Yes, yes, he seemed to feel much better about the whole thing afterwards. Although I would definitely elaborate in the morning about your feelings on the matter. Capitulate a bit, even. Give him a private tutor so he can learn medicine.”
John trapped one of those long fingers in his lips, and sucked as hard as he could. A rush of hot air blew along the back of his neck. “More,” John growled, because he could communicate this way too, “harder.”
"I'm really not. Tax season brings out the absolute worst in people. You should see what happens after Christmas." He looks John in the eye before they break down giggling. Oh, he can't wait for tonight. When John gets his breath back under control he asks "Are you always going to be this mysterious?"
"Something the matter, Johnny?" Most of the students think the cutesy nicknames from their Maths teacher is a little disturbing. Most of the time, John agrees. But he knows the man is just trying to be friendly.
Sherlock nodded understandingly, “You’ve been through a harrowing amount of doubt, one that would test the conviction of any man. It’s no surprise to me that some things remain malignantly obscure to you. Though I am confident in the return of your full mental state.”
The boy set the box down with slightly more force than necessary. He said, “Apologies for the intrusion, I’ll be on my way.” He strode towards the front door, but John was quick to catch up to him, the limp in his leg forgotten.
“I needed to pick something up,” John told the truth again, “I don’t know how long I’ll be there.”
After looking over their DVD collection, Sherlock selected a classic James Bond movie.
John isn’t surprised at their placement, but he smiles wryly at it all the same. He looks up into Sherlock’s eyes, and is somewhat startled by how close they are. They’ve been closer, in more ways than any sane person would deem comfortable. But there’s a new intimacy in their body heat and the brushing fabric of their tuxes that shifts the floor under John’s feet.
“Don’t feel too dismayed, I was only speeding along an inevitability. A woman with that many internal demons would have succumbed to her weaknesses eventually. After all, I did find her exiting a pub before I dragged her away into a filthy alley.”
The shock of it has John leaning back against his chair in surprise. Too close. Oh God, this is way too close. From this distance, John can make out the stray dark curls flying away from his teacher's head. He viciously tamps down the impulse to reach out his hand and smooth them down.
“It is only temporary my love,” Sherlock assured him with the gentlest and most patient of tones. “And your plants will be well tended to by the groundskeeper in the meantime. But until we can be assured that your condition has been improved, it is best to keep you from hurting yourself again.”
John pretends he doesn't notice, looking back out the window. He's greedily looking at the outside world, but inside of his head he's warring with his instincts. Isn't he just being paranoid? It's certainly understandable. John suspects his trust issues from now on are going to send his therapist into a tizzy.
John breathed through his nose, counted to three, and let it out. His vocal chords still felt tangled around each other. They prevented him from saying ‘I had a nice night,’ or ‘I’m sorry it ended like this’. Both felt unacceptable, but saying nothing seemed far worse.
“Yes,” John reluctantly agreed, “I suppose I’m not as well as I thought I was.”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock crawled back to let John sit up. John contemplated just lying there on the damp grass, but Sherlock deserved to be met with dignity.
John sighed, and pinched his nose, “Just, will you just please tell me what is going on Sherlock?”
It’s slightly more uncomfortable like this, with his shoulders arched and his hands pinned underneath him, but at least this way John can see what Sherlock is doing. Unless a blindfold is about to enter the picture, in which case John hopes he can turn back over without reprimand for being ‘fidgety’.
“Oh, pish-posh Sherlock, it’s a compliment. You know that. You appear to be awfully testy today.”
John was quite taken aback by this compliment. He was about to remark on it but Jim waved away any gratitude.
He didn't need to look down to know the fatal distance between the treasure strewn cave floor and himself. A brief image of his body, lying broken among unyielding heaps of gold, flashed through his mind.
John smiled softly at him. This amazing boy could dismantle a drug ring with just a few minutes of examination, but he had no one to look after him. Or anyone who appreciated what his mind could unlock. John gently squeezed Sherlock’ arm in companionship, “I’ll see you at school Sherlock. And for God’s sake, after you’re done sleeping, either get something to eat or come over and I’ll make something for you.”
John shifts, panic starting to set in.
It certainly wasn’t ideal, but it was the best they could do, and they had each other.
Well, John had always wanted to try it out for himself anyway. He was puzzled when Sherlock walked around to the side rather than going for the entrance to the restaurant.
"Yes," Sherlock says slowly, like John is being dull on purpose, "we are. It's what we agreed on."
Sherlock brow furrows in frustration. For God's sake. Not
“But, erm, thanks for the effort,” John said genuinely.
Yet all he could think about, was how much he would want to bring Sherlock with him. He would want to take Sherlock to those same places, show him all of his favorite stops, and then sit back and laugh as Sherlock railed on about the banality of tourist shops.
“I know it sounds fantastical to the extreme, and I don’t expect you to believe me, but this is what has been troubling me.” He looked at Sherlock’s face, expecting mockery or amusement, but his husband was looking at him with a sincere gentleness. There was also a careful stillness to Sherlock’s features that reminded John of a spooked animal, but he prayed above all else that his husband did not fear him for the mirages he couldn’t halt.
“Maybe I should’ve asked for a ride,” John mused. He glanced over at Sherlock, who was looking at him with clear amusement. They both started laughing again.
"It's a pity you're not a skilled writer. Your fanciful imagination would produce lucrative novels." He says the last word like it's insulted him.
"Sherlock Holmes, as you know, mysterious tax accountant and attracted to adventurous men." Sherlock's grin turns into a smirk, and by the look in John's eyes, the flirtation is well received. Sherlock notices that he's being waved in by one of the policeman. "I'm afraid I have to leave after this, though I do dread the paperwork, but it's been a pleasure John. I am very grateful that you saved my life." A flash of disappointment crosses John's eyes, but he quickly stamps it down.
Sherlock looked unsure as to how to respond to that. He shifted on his feet and said, “I would’ve come up with something. I’m not so inept as to let myself starve.”
“I am not,” John whispered back, feeling childlike. “I’m waiting for reinforcements. I cannot hope to argue against the pair of them on my own. An objective party is what I need to set things to rights again.”
“Unless this is a very vivid fantasy that we’re experiencing simultaneously, I believe I had some part in this new development to our relationship.”
In his head, he measures the weight of the woman's words. Obviously in shock, had just been through a traumatic experience. Anything that she says is going to be held inadmissible in court at
John nods his head halfheartedly. Suddenly, the thought of having Sherlock inside of him has become imperative. The image of Sherlock thrusting gently with his long, hard prick sends the blood rushing back to his groin to make him half hard.
“Oh, but that is a lovely fantasy,” Jim purred. “Wouldn’t that be nice Johnny? Keeping you all pliant and relaxed while we had our way with you for the rest of your life?”
Jim smiled at him uncertainly. John wanted to thrash him for not betraying anything with an ill timed smirk or a condescending snicker. To not give up this whole charade, if that was what it was, right then and there, just so John could have some peace in his own thoughts.
John’s head was turned towards Sherlock again, and he gazed into luminescent eyes. Sherlock’s fingers slipped inside of John’s mouth. He teased the edges of John’s soft palate until he was gagging from the length. Icy eyes glowed with heat at the sound. He continued to aggravate John’s throat with his fingers.
kitchen for
Mary nodded and reached for her mobile, but then Sherlock interrupted, “We’re not leaving?”
John had no response and Sherlock didn't blame him. What is the response to someone who has easily claimed your freedom and has no intention on giving it back? Watching John's eyes widen, his nostrils flare and his brow pull back was wonderful to document. But it was nothing compared to the small gasp that made John's lips part. Sherlock was quite abruptly aware of how close he was. How easily he could reach out and touch. And well, now was as good a time as any to ease John into the sexual part of their relationship.
being back in the forefront. You don’t want to leave because then you’ll remember just what kind of life you actually lead. What kind of life
John remains silent in the middle of their bedroom. He dryly wonders if that’s all he is to Sherlock sometimes, a literal captive audience.
This gave his back a tiny arch, making his stomach and groin all the more visible. Smirking against John’s hair, Sherlock rubbed his wet fingers against John’s hole.
John didn’t need to know a lot of things.
This was nothing a clipper and some filing couldn’t fix.
A vague sense of alarm underlined his every thought, but the exhaustion, near freezing, and the escape for his life all proved to be too much. He fell into sleep.
, moving is a terrible thing. Sucking in air through his teeth, John focuses on his dick, wanting to get this over with so he can pass out already.
his life now. Getting everything out in the open just left a sour taste in both of their mouths, since there was fuck all they could do about it.
John thinks, sometimes, that he must have killed someone
to look like our leftovers.”
“You haven’t confused me,” Sherlock interrupted, “in sharing vulnerability with each other we’ve established an intimate relationship. Why does this bother you?”
“It works best if I give you directions, I don’t want to spoil the surprise.” Sherlock shoved his hands into his jacket pockets and rocked back on his heels. He nodded his head towards the backdoor, “Come on then, let’s go.”
The setting sun offers plenty of shadow, so his dark curls and coat render him almost invisible. He'll just have to hope that the creature is as unobservant as the rest of humanity. Sherlock wonders when he started banking on pure luck to get him out of dangerous situations.
He would have loved to sequester it away someplace far safer than having the occupant of the room asleep less than ten yards from him. But he had no idea what he was looking for. With his current luck he would rather not take the chance having the man awaken, realize what had been stolen, and then have John arrested before he could examine all of the documents. No, it was best to stay here, shove them inside, and escape if the man began to stir.
“God, Sherlock,” John groaned. “Hurry up,” it was as much a demand as it was a plead. If Sherlock didn’t progress soon, John was going to come. Either from the stimulation of his prick against the soft sheets, or the maddening rubbing against his prostate. The method didn’t really matter to him.
Sherlock relaxes his hand so the crop rests against his leg. The relief in John is evident from the curve of his shoulders and the sudden laxness of his mouth.
For a second, John felt a protective rage surge inside of him. Sherlock had told him his parents were dead, so for a reporter to try and pose as a relative to get a scrap of information was beyond disgusting. But then he remembered that Sherlock had a brother. One that had kicked him out of the house to live in some nowhere town for his ‘best interests’.
This one sounded smaller, meant for upper class families who took it with them on "camping trips". So, electricity was going to be involved tonight. John felt his skin break into a cold sweat. Sherlock's voice broke past his anxiety, to replace it with defiant anger. "Thank you, gentlemen. That will be all."
student. You’re only a member of the faculty. And you work in a section that rarely deals with large groups of pupils.”
? Are you kidding me?” John went back to his phone and immediately dialed for an ambulance. He described the situation in clipped and clear words, and hung up the phone after the assurance that help would be arriving in ten minutes.
“Of course Johnny. Though do consider the apology unnecessary, when you are able. Call on me at any time if you wish to speak. I’ll clarify or enact anything you ask if it will set things right.”
John stamped that thought down when Sherlock turned to look at him. There, in Sherlock’s bright eyes, was the need for approval. After everything they’d been through, after all that Sherlock had accomplished, he sought out John’s praise.
John gasps awake, and fights the nightmare as he claws his way out of his stone form. He groans in old pain and anger, his cries barely echoing down onto the London streets. Atop of Big Ben, John is mercifully, painfully by himself. As the image of the dead fledgling is pushed back into his subconscious, John raises a clawed hand to his face. He covers his eyes, his mouth, and breathes into the chill night air.
Then, he's completely undone when Jim bites down at the same time Sherlock
“What the hell Sherlock,” John was quiet about his outrage, as the boy had also spoken in a low tone. Even though he didn’t know why they needed to suddenly be quiet. “I could have hurt you!”
Despite his efforts, John is actually enjoying himself. True, it's what he had set out to do in the first place, but he wanted to do it
Sherlock's led him back into the main area of his bedroom. The minions have already left, job finished and well done. Sherlock considers giving them a small raise as a thank you. Only if they're quiet about what they were asked to do.
"John, beautiful, John, glorious, John, oh, John, God!" Sherlock grips his thighs tightly, and thrusts in earnest now. Every hit inside of him has John choking on the air in his lungs. Sherlock's reveling in the heat, the stretched walls. With a brutal yank, Sherlock rips off the blindfold. John's flooded with light, and it's watching those hazed blue eyes focus on him that has Sherlock coming in spurts.
He's this close to burning the whole place to the ground just for something to DO.
“Alright, I’ll be right there. You can go on home Molly, this can be pushed off until tomorrow.”
John gasps out in surprise when Sherlock takes his limp cock in a slicked hand, and begins to tease the skin around the glans. John’s cock begins to plump between Sherlock’s fingers. The pink skin tightens bit by bit until John is half hard and squirming. John’s restraints hold steady, as they always do, but John’s not sure how loud he’s supposed to be tonight, so shifting will have to do.
Either way, this is a fairly textbook demonstration of initiating Stockholm Syndrome. Not that John has been suffering daily torture, but he doesn’t need to. The myriad of scars along his body say that he doesn’t need to endure something constantly for it to have a lasting impression.
Later, as Sherlock licked away at the sweat of John’s nape, he whispered more about John’s importance and value. John stared at the soft silks and numerous valuables around him. This was all he would be. A coveted thing in a sequestered place.
Sherlock presses closer to John, his hard length fitting snugly between John's cleft. John tenses all over again, but it's from arousal this time. John's head spins, trapped between the two men. For a long moment, all they do is remain there, breathing in each others shared air. Sherlock places tiny pecks up John's shoulder, until those plump lips breathe against his ear, "Bend over."
The boy couldn’t say the prince’s name at this point. He couldn’t even moan or beg. He just gasped and curled himself closer to Sherlock as his final orgasm wracked his overwrought body. Sherlock had time to see the Omega lose himself to ecstasy, before his own orgasm rolled through him.
The dragon’s lips curled up in a smirk. He lapped gently at the small bud until it began to stiffen. He kissed his way across John’s chest and repeated his ministrations on the other nipple.
Jim didn’t answer for a long time. “Well, the answer is all over your clothes Johnny. Along with other things. It warms my heart to see you two so…active after the honeymoon period.”
There’s a new intimacy in this for Sherlock as well. He’s felt John many times, in countless extensions of the definition, but this easy camaraderie is fresh to him. John trusts him to lead this dance, if nothing else, and Sherlock cradles that trust like a baby bird in his palms.
John’s smile was unsure, but the need to depart from the house had now become a matter of necessity combined with a desire for a change of scenery. He left after thanking Jim for the interference and advice.
He's putting away the beans when he hears "What happened?", directly behind him. John jolts around. It still gets to him how utterly silent the bastard can be. Sherlock stands incredibly close in his dressing gown, t-shirt and boxers. His gaze roams over John's figure, deducing the days' events. He sees how he'd dawdled in the park with his lunch, how insufferable the cashier was being, how long John had to stand out in the rain before finally getting a cab. What he doesn't see is what happened in front of Tesco's, before John had practically dove into the car.
"There isn't much I can offer you that you already can't achieve or steal on your own, except of course, for the true communications to the Egyptian resistance." Sherlock leaned forward in his chair, touching his fingertips together. This was proving to be a compelling conversation.
If it had been a serious attempt, then…then John should…
When the frame of the door began to peel away from Harry’s unnatural strength, John finally found his voice. “Harriet! Stop it!” He only used her given name when he was cross with her.
“Oh,” Mary looked surprised. John hoped he was just imagining the hint of relief in her features. “That’s…unexpected. The press isn’t bothering him I hope?”
The rivalry only seemed to grow from then on. Every time John turned around, one of them was there to occupy his time with games, conversation, or tea. Shortly after the invitation however, he was either pulled away by his husband or his husband was pulled away by Jim to attend some ‘urgent matter’. There was even one instance where he’d overheard the both of them arguing loudly in their study as he’d passed by, and he’d heard his name mentioned once or twice. He tried to put a stop to it by speaking with Sherlock.
John was amicable, but no one ever liked to address the elephant in the room that was his service or his leg. Mary had once been the person he could turn to about those clinging dark shadows. But she hadn’t been that for him in a long time.
, asking nicely enough." One of Sherlock's hands moves from around John's hip to tease up to his chest. Once there, he pinches a nipple, and that's enough to erase any trace of John's dignity.
John had finally been making a family of his own, crafting a new legacy for the Watson name that went beyond pointless titles, and now his only sibling was rotting in the ground. Apparently John’s life was a fun little game for God to bungle when He was bored.
“No.” Sherlock cut him off. “I have every reason to suspect that at least one of the dealers is a child of one of the officers. If the authorities dawdled on this because of bureaucracy, and the parent warned them, which they likely would, then the same situation would occur.”
“John,” Mary stopped him before he could take a step.
It hits Sherlock that he hasn't heard John's laugh since that alleyway incident from so long ago. The compulsion to kiss John overcomes him, and he's got his face in his hands before he knows what he's doing.
Thoughts of electrodes, metal tables, scalpels, straps, tranquilizers and too much
Then Sherlock nipped at John’s lips, and he stopped speculating. Sherlock occasionally licked at the raindrops that clung to John’s face, like he needed them to quench something.
Again there was the contract of transference, but no divorce notification. John felt his stomach violently roil.
The cop looked dubiously between the two of them, but radioed it in for confirmation. When that was done he asked John, “And you are?”
. John plops his head back onto the bed. He's resigned to wait this out, to ride the waxing waves of pain and pleasure until the drugs dissolve in his system. Then it starts to get worse.
rumors Sherlock, not cause more indecent ones to arise,” Mycroft retorted.
"Tell me John. Tell me why I shouldn't strip you down into something inhuman." And that. That is what it takes for John to finally get it. For all of the pieces to fall into place. Epiphany slams through him like a train, and he lets out a huff of air. Sherlock grins into John's neck, mistaking the breath of air for desperate arousal.
Sherlock gets to the very corner of John's mouth before the man pulls back.
As John stares into the pale column of skin, he wonders just what he'll have to give up next time. He'd been meaning to save the burn scars for getting a job at surgery. But this is worth it. This is fine. He can find something else. He thinks of the tiny chip in his shoulder, and the unceasing burn on his hip. Sherlock mentioned something about controlling his diet one time. And Sherlock liked the riding crop experiment well enough. Maybe he wouldn't mind a repeat. That's doable. That's fine.
John noticed, but he didn’t move away. Sherlock took away a dozen meanings from that. John was a boy who often had to fend for himself and his sister, against vagabonds and his own blood alike.
All John can do is lie there. He prays one more time, the same plea he uttered on desert sand eons ago.
His heart echoed in his skull. He didn’t dare to move, yet the thought of staying filled him with dread. With deep breaths steadying his limbs, he tried to inch towards the forest’s edge.
And best of all, when John caught the man staring at him with his ice blue eyes, he saw nothing but love there.
John forcefully uncurled his hands. He refused to give in to those thoughts, otherwise it would never stop.
? Fucking hell, Sherlock, this is just—this is just a slaughter! And when the hell did you even get the power to do something like this?”
In his nightclothes and bare feet, making the walk to the greenhouse was difficult. He kept to the shoveled path he’d made for himself. Any wayward bare footprints in the snow would arouse curiosity if not suspicion. His breath fogged in front of him, but it was not so cold that his teeth chattered. Perhaps he simply hadn’t been exposed long enough, for his feet already felt like hunks of stone.
This is certainly not the...normal response that humans have when meeting him. The man actually leans closer, and light from below illuminate his sharp features. Instead of terrified and repulsed, this human looks...well, awestruck is one word. Flabbergasted is another.
"Listen," John rushes, "I really don't think you'd believe me if I told you where I just came from. I just need to get to a police station right now." John's voice is urgent, but he tries not to push it. He hasn't seen any other cars pass by them. It's either plead to the stranger or try and walk. And who knows if someone's already after him by now?
It hits him suddenly that this is the first time they've been intimate while facing each other. Without restraints.
John is startled from his thoughts. Sherlock has barely said a word all day, his attention entirely on his phone. John hadn't asked what had kept him so riveted. With Sherlock, ignorance really is a blessing. The last time he'd seen him so zoned out, John had read something about a failed terrorist cell take down in the papers the next week. The issue of talking about Sherlock's work has never been brought up between them, but it is certainly implied that John would much rather be left in the dark. Sherlock's words fully sink in, and John is understandably indignant.
John refrained from leaning away when it felt like he was being scanned by laser beams. John quickly explained, “Your clothes are ripped along the seam of your shoulder. You had to tear away from someone holding you back.”
John’s throat continues to produce new whines and clicks, and Sherlock stores them all away in his mind palace like precious jewels. Soon there’s a stutter to John’s breathing that is intimately familiar to him.
“Don’t fret about it,” John hastily said, “Ms. Hooper, thank God you’re here. You’re exactly the person I need. I’m in dreadful danger and I require your expertise.”
Sherlock smiled, pride beaming in his eyes. He leaned down and kissed John, gently exploring his mouth. After a brief period, John began to press back. They laid there, Sherlock hovering over him, just softly pressing themselves against one another.
With dawning horror John began to realize that perhaps it was because he never had a chance to even hide it from himself.
They suggested, with sickening implication, what other freaky shit he might be into.
of all places? He didn’t remember—
“You didn’t have to; it was practically written all over your body language. Plus, you’ve already demonstrated several instances of a compassionate and generous disposition.”
John couldn’t trust any of the servants to aid him. He had to get to the village to seek shelter, and to possibly find a policeman. He needed a horse.
send him spinning downward. The blindfold over his eyes just serves to enhance that feeling of vertigo. It reminds him of that unnerving sense of always being watched even when he couldn’t see Sherlock’s eyes peeling him down to the bone. He remembers the darkness being the only thing he could see for what had felt like
When he pulled back, the mark was even darker and larger than the previous one. And unless John wore a high collared shirt, it would be easily noticeable. There went the possibility for keeping Mycroft’s court members guessing. Oh well, that was his brother’s problem. Sherlock rubbed his thumb over the bruise, pressing down with alternating pressure. The shape made it appear as though he had stained John’s skin with ink from his smearing thumb.
“Why not?”
He screams when he comes. The onslaught of his orgasm has no cathartic release. It stays in his prick, where it builds upon itself. The muscles clench around the metal, intensifying the sensation until all of his nerves are located in the soft tissue and the unyielding stick.
