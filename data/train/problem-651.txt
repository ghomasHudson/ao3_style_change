“Sorry?” A wrinkle appeared between his eyebrows, he was caught off-guard by the question. Had been the first time, too, if Sherlock recalled rightly. And he never forgot. Never forgot a single thing about the man who was John H. Watson, Captain of the 5th Royal Northumberland Fusiliers. Soldier, doctor, friend,
It took him an hour, but Sherlock found the perfect ring. It was made of gold, engraved with the words “Love Loyalty Friendship” in ancient runic and came with two silver side rings that could be worn separately or in conjunction with the primary band.  It was pretty yet practical and relatively sturdy-looking. It would be more than suitable. His next move was to post an advertisement in the papers for the coat John had given him a week ago. He wrote out the following “Found: green parka @ Dean Street. Fur-lined hood and collar. Please Inquire @ 221B Baker Street after 10 am to claim.”
They didn’t stay much longer once their business had concluded. Leaving the house ahead of the boys, Judith called for a patrol to take their place and sit on the house until they were relieved by another team. By then, John and Sherlock were out of sight. She had words with the patrol that responded, keeping her attention split between the house across the street and the constables before her.
“Oh, wait a minute!” Sherlock snickered, “Hold it! I remember you! You’re Mike Stamford’s little friend, aren’t you? Not much to look at, are you?”
“Mycroft.” They said in unison, with a great deal less of the usual spite. Sometimes, Mycroft Holmes could be downright useful. This mess was definitely one of those times.
“If you don’t mind, it would do us better sleep tonight if we made sure you arrived at your final destination safely.” Moriarty came up on her left, “You’re far too valuable to the City of London to risk anything happening to you that might land you a stay in the hospital against your will. There are some rather…unsavory characters about at this hour.”’
“Good night, Anthea.” He stepped back and watched the car drive off again. His car would be garaged in half an hour. Desperate for some sleep, Greg went back inside and locked his doors. Ten years he’d known the Holmes brothers, ten years he’d known Anthea. What a thing. He heard water running upstairs and smiled. Judith would sleep hard tonight, hopefully without nightmares. He knew, personally, how badly PTSD could fuck up sleep-patterns. Taking his own shower, Greg dried off and got ready for bed. He was supposed to have a day off tomorrow, but crime never took a vacation, so it would be a wait-and-see game if any calls came in. It was half-one in the morning, he anticipated getting at least three hours of sleep, maybe four if he was lucky.
“Well, since neither teaching or clinical practice really hold any appeal to me.” He shrugged. Before anything else could be said of the matter, they were interrupted by the arrival of someone John was familiar with and he stiffened.
anymore, was he? Hadn’t been for almost a week now, and it was awful. He hated being like this, but there was nothing for it. He could look for work, yes, but what on
, love. Sleep in peace tonight.” She murmured, kissing the soft skin behind his ear. He moaned in his sleep, rolled over, and pulled her into a stifling hug that relaxed a bit as she rubbed the back of his neck and sang to him. She sang Sios dhan an Abhainn until they both fell asleep, at roughly the same time.
Judith and John showed up at The Met a quarter past the hour with no warning. Judith had the statements from yesterday’s case, and as he skimmed over Sherlock’s, he looked at the charming senior medical officer, one eyebrow raised. She just smiled at him.
“Oh.” That didn’t seem to surprise Lestrade much, and John wondered if the DI was actually used to this kind of thing as they went outside to wait and get some fresh air.
“So, you ... uh, you put this kid in irons and stash him in the back of somebody’s car while you try to find a point of contact because he won’t stop carrying on about how you’re going after the wrong person and instead of the apparent suspect, it’s
“For ... going after him against orders, risking yourself like that to get him out.” The other man messed with something on his left hand, avoiding eye-contact. “If you hadn’t ... I mean, that was ages ago by now, I know, but if you hadn’t ... ”
“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome guests, please put your hands together for Alshshafq Alrraqisun, featuring our very own Zazi! She comes home to Maroush after years in the deserts of Afghanistan. Please give her a warm welcome, ladies and gentlemen!” The way he said it made it sound like this particular dancer was a regular, but that didn’t seem too terribly likely. The girls arranged themselves and on the right musical cue began a beautiful and mezmerising dance-number. The idea behind legitimate belly-dancing was not to be a strip-tease but an unfolding.
Checking the time, Greg realized he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, surviving on bad coffee and vending-machine snacks since then. Such was the life of a homicide detective. He groaned and ruffled his hair, irritated. On the other side of his desk, another glance was exchanged. He wondered if Judith and John ever actually spoke out loud to each other, or if they had adapted a silent method of communication.
“Uh, no. I…don’t think we do, Ms…?” The rather handsome silver-haired DI in charge of the scene blinked at her as he skimmed over a notepad.
“Scratches. Not one, many over time. It’s been in the same pocket as keys and coins.” He turned it over and looked at it as he talked. “The man sitting next to me wouldn’t treat his one luxury item like this, so it’s had a previous owner. Next bit’s easy. You know it already.”
“Oh, Christ. Unlikely!” John rolled his eyes. “Like Hell he misses me, I’ve only been gone for a week! If you know
“Just past two, she’s on her lunch break.” Stephen smiled and they watched Christine come into view in the atrium. She wore a heavy coat and snow-boots over her scrubs, bundled up against the weather as best she could be. Judith sat on the railing, feet dangling over the landing.
two of us. I would suggest you try not to make the same mistake again.” He thought about that for a minute and made a face Lachey didn’t see. “Well, you won’t get a chance to make the same mistake again, unfortunately. It’s prison for you.”
Once he had the ad in the papers, all he could do was wait. And it was a gut-wrenching wait of nearly two weeks past his initial submission to the papers before anything happened. Timing was everything and the first time he took a caller that day, it was Moriarty.
“Mhm. I’ve been about as busy as you have, I imagine.” John shook the water out of his eyes and reached for the handle, turning the water off. A blast of cold water hit them both before the water went off, and Sherlock glared at John, who just smiled at him and fetched up warm towels.
“Oh, fancy that! A name!” She laughed at him, “What is wrong with your name that you weren’t going to tell me?”
“Several. But, um, you’d better take a look. This one landed on the back-burner, we can’t make anything of it.” He handed them the file and let Sherlock open it. Inside was something entirely unexpected.
“I have a white-list, there is one name on it right now. I will put your names there and you will all be safe. And if something goes wrong and you get hurt in some way, the responsible parties will be punished for their mistake.”
The quiet was only broken by the sound of Greg’s phone going off and John did not miss the air of resignation with which Greg answered the incoming call. Crime never took a day off, and even though he wasn’t on for the next case, they were calling him in. After hanging up with whoever had called him, Greg pocketed his phone and looked at Mycroft.
“Sounds good to me!” She signed off on the report she was reading and locked her car before following the boys down Baker Street to the Chinese at the end of the street that stayed open until two am. They got as far as Melcombe Street before they had any trouble, and Judith saw them first.
She looked into the back seat of her car as they arrived at the hospital. Getting through the gate separating the hospital from the street was simple and Greg warned them to be alert. So far as he was aware, they were the only Met presence at the hospital and he would try to keep it that way. “We’ll be in touch, yeah?”
“Thanks, by the way, Mycroft, for stepping in on my little side-project tonight.” She looked up and smiled at him, “I haven’t figured out where I’m going to take them quite yet. I’ll worry about that tomorrow. Right now, you two need to make peace.” She didn’t see Bond open his mouth, but she knew he’d done it and looked over at him.
“Not for a long bloody time, but Mrs Hudson never took my key, y’know? Wouldn’t let me give it back, absolutely refused to rent the bloody place.”
“Donovan could use a hard lesson in civility, she’s always been like that around Sherlock, and I’ve had enough.”
“Oh. Thank you.” He just stared at Sherlock, he wasn’t sure anyone had ever said something like that to him before. Sherlock’s eyes were practically glowing as he leaned up to kiss him, tasting just a bit of latex.
“You were out on a case this morning while I was in the Swearing Room again. Small group, not nearly as many people for family and friends.” She smiled and rolled them, “Sally made it, though, and my brother came with Sherlock.”
“Nope. You’ll know when we do.” She promised. John nodded and went inside 221B, eager to lay eyes on Sherlock for himself.
“Processing incoming bodies, assisting on autopsies, making proper arrangements post-procedure and such, helping keep her workload from getting too mad.”
“Cù-Sìth.” He sniffled and hunched his shoulders. He was very curious to know what the unassuming veteran’s Other Form looked like, he imagined it was quite a thing to behold.  He knew when Mycroft discovered the little box in the pocket, and what it was for, his brother chuckled.
“Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me,” Roben said derisively, rolling his eyes as John turned towards him. “Often are, these vigilante types.” He had been looking around the living room but caught John staring at him.
“Sorry, Mrs Hudson!” They shouted in unison, dissolving in a fit of childish, frantic giggling and clumsy fumbling. Somehow, they made their way through the flat that had been home to them and was still home to John, avoiding any and all obstacles on the floor in the process. Getting to the back bedroom, they left a trail of clothes in their wake. Once inside, the door was locked and the remaining clothes were discarded in a tangled heap. John grabbed Sherlock and dragged him into the bathroom, where he ran the shower.
“Well, they’re not going to know what they’re looking at, or if they do, they’ll still get it wrong. They always do. Especially if that hack Anderson is around.”
where!” Greg tapped glasses with him, drained his, and got to his feet. John showed him on a map roughly where he’d seen the lights out on the moor. While Greg went in search of flashing lights, John went to charm Louise Mortimer. With any luck,
“I gave you my number. I thought you might call.” Sherlock turned towards the new arrival, who walked out into the open. He looked familiar, but Sherlock couldn’t place him, this sharply-dressed man with immaculate hair and a murderous look on his face. With his hands in his pockets, he casually began to stroll alongside the deep end of the pool, heading towards Sherlock’s little threesome.
“Would you give me...one moment, please; one moment of privacy?” He looked down at Jim, who watched with sickening anticipation. “Please?”
There weren’t many people this morning, it was too cold and too foggy, and they took the stairs down to Paul’s Walk, which was blocked off at the foot of the stairs by tape and a few sleepy-eyed constables. John pulled Sherlock along behind him and approached the tape. They were, of course, stopped. He held onto Sherlock, who looked over the tape, vibrating with excitement, and gave his name to the constables.
Two days later, John found himself sitting in The Criterion Bar at 4 pm, one of a small group of regulars minding their own business and contemplating their futures, whatever those happened to be. He hadn’t been approached by anyone except the bartender, so when a glass was set at his place, he was a little surprised.
“Typical.” An eye-roll said a lot about what Lestrade thought about that. “Well, I guess I’ll catch him later.”
There were stacks of papers and files he recognized as case-files from The Met all over every flat surface in the place, bookshelves were crammed with books on nearly every scientific subject known to man, primarily forensics, psychology, anatomy, chemistry, pharmacology, and phytology. There were also books on history and sociology. And a stack of medical texts. Not much in the way of pleasure reading, it seemed, but Sherlock didn’t seem the sort to read for the hell of it. He was more likely to read the newspapers or one of his textbooks than a novel. But John saw signs of recent additions and went for a closer look at one shelf. Oh, no wonder. The medical texts were mostly
“No problem.” John shook hands with Greg, who decided a hug was in order, and watched until the silver car was out of sight before locking the front door and going upstairs to the flat. Sherlock was studying pictures of the missing dogs and he could tell it disturbed him deeply that someone was stealing puppies in Central London and the surrounding boroughs.
As she contemplated the doors, she was distracted by a buzzing in her pocket. It was her phone. Again. She answered without looking, startled by the sound in this quiet place.
“Oh my god! Jude! That’s amazing!” He pulled her in for a kiss, “Oh, you brilliant, sneaky thing you! That’s what’s had you girls tittering all week! I completely blanked it!”
“Mm, no. It drives my brother a bit mad, really. I can tear a person apart on a single look and learn everything there is to know about them, but social niceties escape me. I’m a terrible person to be friends with.”
“I really doubt that, sir. There’s plenty of competent people up in that division.” She chose her words carefully. Not that Judith didn’t
“Alright, you two, that’s enough. I’ll pull you boys in later, I guess, or get your reports from Mycroft.”
Leaving Angelo’s, Judith headed across Vauxhall Bridge to MI6 to meet up with Q and review some CCTV traffic-cam footage. It took fifteen minutes, and she walked into Q’s little kingdom five minutes after arriving at MI6.
“Sure thing, boss!” Mary smiled and winked at John, who was trying to figure out what it was about her that made his neck itch. As soon as the door had closed, he got up and locked it.
“A couple of months, by our guess.” Greg shrugged, “I thought this might be right up your alley. Feel free to reach out to any of the affected breeders and families. We have no idea who would do something like this.”
“You’ve given me my freedom, John, what more could you possibly offer me?” He turned back to the mirror and finished buttoning up his shirt.
doing here?!” Sherlock made a face as the back door of the black government car popped open and disgorged Mycroft Holmes onto the sidewalk.
“I’d be a bloody liar if I said I didn’t.” John sighed and slid the license back into its slot, stroking the image through the view-window, “There’s a hole in my life that just can’t be filled properly, and God knows I’ve tried to move on. I just … I
“Well, we’ve already covered your service in the Army and in MI6, established your status as a retired Double-Oh. Which is to be commended, very few people can say they’ve outlived their own life-expectancy like that.” Sherlock looked sidelong at him. “Then there’s your brother.”
“I have to double-check. Your comfort is very important to me, tell me to stop if you need me to, alright?”
A soft tap on the glass got their attention and John looked up enough to see someone standing outside the car. Two someones, actually, two very
“I’ll drive you back up there if you want me to, Doc.” Hutchison had his radio up, “We’re all ready to go.”
like Sherlock John’s friend Stephen really looked. He acted like him, looked like him, and sounded like his expatriate American cousin or long-lost brother. There
“He’s not one of us, so standard precautions are unnecessary.” John proved it to them by executing a revealing spell. There was absolutely no sign of any magic besides their own in the room. “And I didn’t sense any in the house beyond the members of your team who are.”
“Wouldn’t know that the way Sherlock goes on about us, would you?” Lestrade ruffled his hair, slightly annoyed.
“Yeah, sure. Coming.” He got out of the car, taking Mycroft’s offered hand, and looked around to see where they were. One of Mycroft’s regular haunts, way out of his price range and definitely out of his dress-code. He blinked at the façade, the glowing windows that promised hot food, good company, and, when he was in the mood for it, better wine.
“I don’t know who she is, but that woman is not a friend of ours. Not someone to trust.” He took a clean sheet of paper and wrote on it, sliding the paper across to Greg.
So, I'm pretty sure I messed up a few things with police-procedure in NSY, but it's  fanfiction, it's my story, and I couldn't for the LIFE of me find anything that told me if Special Constables (like Judith) have to go through the same two-year period that new recruits have to undergo. If someone out there knows, can you tell me? And I really don't know how long you would have to sit in one rank before moving up, but I figure that you could be promoted on merit and skill. *shrug*
“My mother just tried to kill my brother, maybe succeeded. I’m furious and sad, but I don’t want to cry.”
“Whoever’s been kidnapping the puppies is the same person who contracted the killing of Sue Ling at London Zoo!” He turned, clutching a handful of photographs in one hand, “Sherlock, I swear, it’s the same person!”
“Oh, I know, I know.” Mycroft just smiled, “But I’d like to wish you a happy birthday in advance on the outside chance I don’t have the opportunity to do so on Thursday. So, happy birthday.”
Parking the car just down the street from Baker Street, he took one bag, one box, and the garment-bag. Sherlock had the other box and the second bag. Getting into the house, they were quiet going upstairs. He would worry about moving his things tomorrow. Sherlock took him by the hand and led him back to the bedroom, making sure to lock the door. It was too late and he was too tired for anything but sleep at this rate, he was too wired to think straight and consent was so bloody important for them.
“I know. I’m keeping my eye on you until noon, then you can do whatever in hell’s name you want to. Turn in your badge if that’ll make your life easier, but no one should have to put up with that kind of discrimination.”
John looked out the window again as the taxi began to slow and manoeuvre out of traffic. “There was very little love lost between us when he died. I wasn’t even in the country.”
been very pleased when Timothy Bennett returned to base looking like he’d seen the losing end of a fight to the death short of actually
“Don’t try to interfere, or I shall arrest you too.” Greg snapped, poking her brother in the chest for good measure, “And
Taking John’s coat and the case after replacing the pelt, adding the ring-box before he locked it up again, Sherlock went out to the sitting-room where he found John sitting on the couch, a case very similar to his sitting on the coffee table with Sherlock’s coat folded on top of it.
“Nah. You’ll see when we get there!” He just smirked at her from across the way. Shaking her head and wondering why the element of surprise was so important to him, she looked out the window as they flew over open water. It was clear, and so many shades of blue. She hadn’t been in the islands long, but her hair was already starting to curl with the humidity and she felt that griminess of the saltwater in the air. It was a sort of stickiness, but she didn’t mind it at all.
“I wasn’t promising you protection, I was asking for honest answers. You’ve kept up your end of the bargain.” She sighed, “I
. Over the ringing of the phone, Sherlock heard a soft click. A door closing, somewhere else in the flat. He and Mr Hope were not alone in 221B and probably hadn’t been for quite a while. Not if that had been Judith’s squad-car parked on the kerb outside.
“Here, you need this more than I do.” He gave the man his coat. “It’s too cold tonight for someone like you to go without one.”
To prove his stated point that he controlled Sherlock, and could do whatever he wanted, Moriarty kissed Sherlock. It was not a consensual kiss, and Sherlock fought against it, but Moriarty only held on tighter and forced his way into Sherlock’s mouth. It made him feel dirty and dishonest.
“It was ugly. Three days before John shipped out he was hauling Sherlock out of a drug-den in the West End before the cops busted the place wide open. Last he knew, it was off to rehab for Sherlock.” She dropped into the passenger seat of a marked car, “We didn’t hear from or see the Holmes brothers until the two of them dropped in on Camp Bastion in 2005 while I was posted there. Then it was on-again off-again for a few more years until just a few days ago when Sherlock dropped retirement orders on my desk in Afghanistan and I got shipped home.”
. And especially not beyond use!” Sherlock shook his head, curls trembling, eyes full of fire that did things to John. Naughty things. “I have plenty of use for you!”
What felt like hours later, she was yanked back to consciousness by raised voices. Her hearing was fuzzy and her head was swimming, and something was making her nauseous. Moving hurt, her limbs felt heavy. If she’d been more aware, she would have pulled into the Astral Plane to get a look. Lifting her head, she tried to get an idea of where she was. The room was tiny, cramped, and dark. The air smelled heavily of chlorine and pool chemicals. Ah. She was in a pool deck, then. Desperate for some mobility, she shifted into the Astral Plane and heaved a sigh of relief as she was able to move around freely. Her physical form slumped against a cinder-block wall. She was tied up in a supply-closet full of equipment and containers of industrial-strength treatment-chemicals. They had used her own handcuffs on her, tied her hands behind her back, gagged her with duct-tape, and she wore a green parka with a fur-trimmed hood, which was weird. That wasn’t her coat? What had they
“I think you’d better stand back, sir. Let me handle this.” He murmured, putting one hand on Roben’s shoulder as the cloak rustled and twitched, trying to get it’s wearer’s attention. To let them
I used a combination of the original dialogue from A Study in Scarlet and the dialogue in A Study in Pink from Ariane Devere's transcribed screenplays of the BBC series. None of this would be possible without Doyle or Ariane. At the very least, it would be a great deal more difficult without Ariane's efforts!
“No problem. Come on, Sherlock.” John took Sherlock’s hand and went back up the slick stairs. There were no slips or spills this time and they waited ten minutes while Greg turned things over to forensics and to his secondaries, sharing a cigarette while they watched from the top of the wall.
“Well, I think that’ll do it, Molls. Sorry about the extra work.” Lestrade lifted the biro to double-check what he’d written already and nodded.
“Sherlock Holmes? No, sir.” Seeing Strange from behind had brought Roben to a dead halt, and Greg snickered. “
“Well, there’s an added bit of security to this girl.” Q was eager to show off the upgrades and John was eager to
“Okay! Love you, Daddy!” Rosie just smiled at him and kissed him wetly on the cheek. John felt some part of his jaded, scarred heart squeeze a bit. How could she be so good and so pure? It wasn’t
He enjoyed seeing how Sherlock reacted to him, how he reacted to the way John did things in the bedroom. The soft moans and cries, the way he arched off the bed so much John could slide an arm around him and hold him up. The angry red tracks that were being scratched into John’s back and shoulders, marks he would wear with honour. The sloppy, off-centre kisses, the quiet reassurances and pleas for “more, more, please”, the dampness on Sherlock’s cheeks as they lay together after, recovering.
“My god, sir!” She ended up sitting on the floor of the train-car between his legs, knowing she probably looked ridiculous and not caring, “Last I heard of
“Stop that man!” Someone yelled, “Call the police!” John was already on the move. A bit of excitement for the evening? That was okay with him. He wasn’t quite drunk, but he wasn’t exactly stone-cold sober, either, yet he had no problem running down the man, who kept looking over his shoulder.
“Ahh.” The man looked up at him, raking John over with a familiar, uncomfortable gaze, “John! Pleasure’s mine! You know what I like, Johnny Boy!”
“Thank you, Billings.” Sherlock gave the constable a nod as he followed John. It was a very quiet drive from Chester Terrace to Baker Street, and when they arrived to find Mycroft’s car parked out front, he was not surprised. Going inside, they were confronted by Mrs Hudson, who folded her arms as she stood at the bottom of the stairs, looking from John to Sherlock, shaking her head.
“Sherlock is a complete moron! Can I take a shot at Moriarty?” Her brother snarled as they returned to her car and made a ten-minute trip
“Nothing terribly exciting, maybe a bit too boring for your taste. Just assist on masters’ level coursework and mentor the thesis students who can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.”
“Of course, Mr Holmes.” Mrs Hudson just followed Mycroft downstairs and saw him out. Once Mycroft was gone, Mrs Hudson came back upstairs. She had tea, which Sherlock was grateful for.
His personal effects had been taken as part of the booking-in process, these were duly returned upon sign-out. He checked everything against the log-sheet and marked it when everything was returned. He had his watch, phone, wallet, coat, and his side-arm. The Browning L1A9 he had carried in the Army had been returned with the rest of his kit upon discharge and retirement from that service, but the Glock 17 L131A1 he had used for almost six years with MI6 was still in his possession. It was properly licensed and registered, so there was no reason he wouldn’t get it back. He did not load the clip, tucking it into his coat pocket, but the pistol went back into its conceal-carry holster which was then returned to its standard place tucked into the back waistband of his trousers.
“Say that like it’s a bad thing, they like you. I get asked about you all the time.” She smiled and bumped shoulders with him, “So, Myc said this wasn’t really a business trip, so you’re obviously not here for an inspection.” When they reached the med facility, she let him go ahead of her, guiding him to her office, “And you’re not here with MI6. So, what’s the deal?”
As the claxon sounded for Sanctorum, Stephen Strange was not expecting the doors to open on Judith Watson, of all people. She had come straight from London, by the looks of it, she wore a rumpled, stained Met uniform. It took him moments to deduce that the blood on her uniform and hands was fresh and not her own. Her eyes were dark and haunted, as if she had seen something unspeakable.
“Annoyed, actually. Angry was three years ago. Five, maybe. Heartbroken was five. Angry was three or four. Now I’m just bloody exhausted and annoyed.”
“Jesus, child!” Gerald Almond shook his head and set her down, looking her over with sharp eyes, “You ain’t with The Met, are ya?”
“Stop, right this instant, stop it. Stop it.” Sherlock said roughly, fingers tightening on his wrists. “I know what you’re thinking, and you will stop that nonsense.”
“I can, but I’m not going to, unless you ask me to.” She listened to his heartbeat, “You’re taking this well.”
“Come on, he lives down this street a bit. Guarantee he’s awake right now.” Greg grinned and grabbed her by the back of her hi-vis running-vest.
“Hard not to.” She smiled, “Not exactly something I expected to hear at home, you know? It’s fine, of course, but I don’t meet many people outside of the military who speak it so fluently.” She turned and looked at him, “You’ve got a service-record with the Army, explains your posture and the way you treat your subordinates, especially when they get out of line. You’re nice about it but you don’t suffer fools quietly. I’d give you…hmm, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, London Regiment, by the looks of it. Five, no six years of service, accounting for six of the sixteen years you’ve been married, and probably a bit of your wife’s antagonistic attitude.”
“Most of them are, don’t look at me like that.” He waved a dismissive hand at John, who just rolled his eyes. “You’re smart enough for me, Watson, don’t look so insulted.”
“Hah.” Lestrade snorted around a mouthful of beer. “If you think for one fucking minute that experience brought Sherlock to his senses, have I got a reality check for you!”
who these gentlemen are.” The change in dynamic was glorious and sudden and perfect. Everyone under the rank of Major immediately stood at attention, the guards took two steps back, and she had her credentials out as Barrymore turned on her like a snake on its prey.
“I know.” The cabbie turned his head to glance over his shoulder at the flashing lights reflecting on the window pane. A siren whooped outside, just once.
“Barred. Had a word with Mrs H, no visitors until we say.” Sherlock tracked him with his eyes as he went to check the door, which had been duly locked.
It was busy but quiet, and Judith slowly unwound from the crazy day she’d had. The dancing provided the badly-needed outlet Judith had needed and getting lost in the rhythm was simple despite her state of agitation. Each incident of today had been personal on some level, and she was desperate for relief. At nine-thirty, during one of the fifteen-minute performances they put on every hour, the doors opened and Judith recognized the man shaking rain off of his coat and umbrella. It looked like he was alone, but if
“They must have figured it was safe to come back.” Sally was kicking off her boots. Judith groaned and picked up their discarded hi-vis jackets, hanging them where John and Sherlock’s coats hung on normal days. She stacked their armour-vests and boots at the end of the couch and headed for the stairs as she pulled off her jumper. The front door opened and closed quietly, she heard murmuring voices and listened to their footsteps on the stairs.
“Not every day I get a call from my niece telling me some nice Brit needs my help.” Magnus beamed at Greg, who was shaking with nerves, “I won’t ask what I can do for
“Up here, boys!” She kept her voice down as she sat down on the stairs until John and Sherlock had appeared and gotten into the flat, following them in. “Kicked the on-site patrols out not long ago. You’re safe here until notice.”
“Well, if she’s going into CID with Lestrade and Donovan, a year. Maybe. She went to school for forensics and criminal justice, and she cleared her required two-hundred hours of operational service and got Independent Patrol Status last month.” Sherlock mused, grinning as he looked at something on his phone, “That’s why they put her up at Detective Constable. She’ll take the necessary courses immediately, but there are no concerns for where she’ll go from here.”
?” She asked sweetly as she packed up the new swim-suits she had gone shopping for with Sally, Adrianne, and Melissa just last week. It hadn’t been for
“The loyalty of the Watsons is not to be underestimated. Do so at your own peril, and prepare to be met with hackles and teeth if you dare.” Mycroft smiled a bit crookedly, “I was aware of the kidnapping, but I suspected if it had come to grave danger, I would have heard from either John or Judith regarding your final fate, little brother.” Sherlock just hissed at Mycroft as he looked at the three of them, unbothered by his brother’s little tantrum.
“I didn’t have this planned when I got here, and that’s just the rub of it.” He rubbed his forehead, “I’m a complete fool.”
aware that he was too weak to fend the man off. Just then the land-line phone began to ring. The cabbie didn’t seem to notice as he looked at Sherlock.
“Oh, wait! I know who you are!” Greg suddenly recognized the man at his side, “Jesus, Doctor Strange! I
“Sir, if you’re willing, I’d be happy to accompany you back to the party. I have a couple of the lads on standby.”
“Let’s see here. Divorced father of two, rather late in life it looks like, drives cabs for a living, trying to make ends meet. Name is…Jefferson Hope. What is this guy’s deal? No record at all, not even a shoplifting charge as a teenager! What flipped his switch suddenly?” She had taken over Mycroft’s chair when he got up to refresh the tea and he had practically pulled her into it, “He’s responsible for the deaths of at
the work of a collector, but no idea who was behind it. But there were parallels between the dognapping case and another case that had flagged the attention of the Baker Street Boys when it happened. An incident at the London Zoo had resulted in the death of the venue’s three-year-old female Siberian Tiger, who had been killed and skinned about nine months ago. It was John who made the connection. He was staring at pictures and maps when it hit him. Sherlock was in the kitchen doing…something, but came running when John gave a yell.
“He should be able to close up the scene if he has to. Weak stomach for this particular volume of blood.” She looked around, “Not that I blame him. It’s always a bit sickening to see so much blood confined to small spaces like this.”
“Now, now, Mr Lachey. None of that nonsense.” He said cheerfully. “Don’t want to add resisting arrest to your records now do we?” All that got him was a whine. It hadn’t taken long for Lachey to realize just how much trouble he’d gotten himself into picking on Sherlock Holmes. Not that Sherlock was by any means unable to defend himself, but he certainly hadn’t objected to John stepping in on his behalf. Two cars appeared and blocked in the stalls where they had taken Lachey to ground. One of them was Greg’s silver car, John recognized it from earlier.
that. And for the love of Christ, his name is Greg! Greg Lestrade! And if I’m not much mistaken, he’s your fucking brother-in-law! Show a little respect, Sherlock Holmes!”
“You’ve rather shown your hand there, Doctor Watson.” Something had just happened, Sherlock had caught a glimpse of red light in the corner of his vision, and Judith’s expression had softened into horror. He shook his head slightly. This wasn’t out of their hands
After that one inspection, Judith renewed contact with the Holmes brothers. She didn’t see much of them through the next three years, except on rare visits home during Holiday leave or the occasional inspection. But she kept up communication by letters, phone calls and emails.
warned him about having experiments about. John had no idea what was what and left it all alone. The microscope looked like it had been “borrowed” from Saint Bart’s if the label on the base was any indicator. The chemistry sets were likewise borrowed, they had the same labels. It amused him that Sherlock had a habit of just taking whatever he wanted or needed, but it didn’t surprise him.
asexual. He was quite gay, and quite demiromantic. If he didn’t have some deeper emotional connection to his partner, he wasn’t going to sleep with them. And John was, if he wasn’t mistaken, bisexual and happy to sample the goods from the whole of the spectrum, not just one or two like the rest of them did. He just had a longer trail of ex-girlfriends than he did ex-boyfriends.
“Yes, ma’am.” Sherlock and John showed their badges. John’s was few years old, he’d been running cases with The Met as a contracted consultant, badge and all, a little longer than Sherlock, who had nicked Greg’s badge ages ago and carried it with him until he could get his own. All that mattered was the shield, names were insignificant at this stage. At least for the moment.
“Allow me.” Sherlock just smiled, kissed him one last time, and made his way south again. John was a little ashamed that he wasn’t quite in top shape, middle age and parenthood had joined forces and conspired against him to keep him a bit softer in the middle than he generally liked.
“John!” Sherlock finally gave up trying to be proper and rushed to John’s side, throwing his arms around his mate as John slipped to his knees and folded. “John, breathe, please. I’m here, John, I’m with you.” One hand reached for him, closed tight around his, the other…John had reached for his mother and found purchase on the material of her hi-vis Anorak. She had come from the same scene they had just left, the stench of dead bodies was still on her clothes. Alexandra shifted, but did not pull away from them. Instead of abandoning them, she knelt and put her arms around her son, and Sherlock as well. He remained still, unwilling to correct her.
““You’re not going to do it.” So the killers can be called off, then – there’s a recall code or a word or a number.” Now he was the one circling his prey. “I don’t have to die...if I’ve got you.” His voice took on a sing-song quality as he circled his nemesis.
“Yeah. She will. There’s something about Dalmatians, puppies especially, that has her attention and her desire.” He watched Sherlock pace, let him spout off his deductions, and knew that if DeVil, or whoever she had hired to kidnap the Dalmatian puppies of London, struck again, they would take the case and see it solved. Whatever that meant. John was very fond of dogs, all breeds, and had owned a Dalmatian as a boy.
They ran a slow, almost lazy circuit of Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, the only sound between them the rhythmic pounding of their shoes against the gravel and pavement, the steady in-and-out of their breathing. It didn’t surprise him that Judith was in such excellent shape, and she was careful to pace herself to her partner’s capabilities. When they reached Park Lane and Picadilly, they took a short break for water.
a Holmes,” John said, folding his arms across his chest. Lestrade looked at him again and brown eyes narrowed a bit. Was that interest?
peculiar to someone like James Roben. For one thing, John and Judith were not wearing the same clothes they’d worn throughout this latest fiasco, but rather very simple, almost medieval clothes with a very obvious Asian influence in red and gray. He hadn’t seen Judith wear that outfit outside of the house before, and paused for a moment. Even when she executed magic, she
“That’s just what?” Sherlock turned to look at him, almost surprised that someone had stopped him, that someone had the
Sherlock held John while he relived memories that provoked as much joy as they did pain. This shouldn’t be happening in public, he knew that. This was a very private matter. And everyone watching it happen knew that. Lestrade came up alongside and put a hand on John’s back, lower than Sherlock’s, and let his Lycan mate know he wasn’t alone.
“Were you ... ” He trailed off, “I mean, I know you ... um. You knew Bond and Trevelyan, and you said Q was your, uh, Quartermaster.”
“I can take care of that.” She smiled and leaned down for another kiss. She touched two fingers to Greg’s temple and felt his body relax and slow down.
“Just now. He’s the one who was behind those suicides last year. I shouldn't trust him at all! I shouldn't trust
She hung up with Mycroft and pulled up her email server. There was one email from Mycroft, which she opened and downloaded right away. Once the email had downloaded, she touched base with Greg, who told them to find a place to bunk down and get some rest. If he needed them, they would know. Judith decided to head for Baker Street, Sally had no opposition to that idea.
John Hughes had been surprised when he found out that his sister was up for a promotion when she had only been with The Met for four months as a Special Constable. She was
“Let me see — what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just leave me be and I’ll be right in a while.”
scary woman when she felt like it. His only consolation was knowing that her temper was not turned on him. After somehow gaining access to a locked-down facility, Judith had shut down Barrymore with a few words and a withering glare that would have brought Mycroft Holmes to his knees. Then she had instructed Robert Frankland to see John and Sherlock safely on their way. Frankland had given them his card after some awkward banter, John knew they hadn’t seen the last of him.
He sounded appropriately subdued, and she dropped by Angelo’s to get some take-away. She had only placed an order for Q, but as he had in the past, Angelo had included enough for Judith as well.
annoying for Judith and the boys. They were all exhausted, Sherlock was a bit hung-over from the drugs, and Judith was probably going to be in a bit of trouble by tomorrow for questioning a suspect when that was above her station, no matter if he wanted to talk to her. That’s not how things worked.
“Here, drink this.” A bottle of water was pressed into his hands as he got settled, and John made sure his seatbelt was buckled. It had been one of Greg’s rules, if you were riding with him you always wore your seatbelt. Sherlock had hated that, and usually refused to wear his. John took a gulp of the water and tried to steady himself.
When Sherlock arrived nearly three hours later, he did not come alone. Not that Mycroft had expected him to. With his brother were John Hughes-Watson, who would probably in the near future shed his “adopted” name, Gregory Lestrade, and Gregory’s assigned sergeant, Sally Donovan. Donovan, by Mycroft’s research, had grown up in the same Council Estate housing as Judith until life took them apart when Judith got into the Army Foundation College three months after her sixteenth birthday and gone on to fifteen years of continuous service with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers as a medic. Judith was also a gifted marksman and had done her share of rifle-work as a sniper. Her brother had the same skillsets, despite a shorter service-history, and he hoped that they could find good outlets for their work-related skills. Donovan had finished secondary school and shunned university for a head start in a career in law enforcement, which she was remarkably
“John?” She stood still and looked at her brother, “Wake up, you’re home in London.” Judith looked at Sherlock, who nodded. Talking helped. She took a deep breath. “Can you hear me, John? Can you hear my voice?”
“London, actually.” She grinned at the pretty doctor, “My brother lives on Baker Street, I live behind the Kensington Police Station.”
“Oh, you’re not sleeping on the couch, love! Hop in, I’ll take you home!” Lestrade dropped out of sight and she chuckled, pulling open the passenger door and sliding into the car. As they got underway again, Judith fished her phone out of her pocket and fired off a text to Mycroft Holmes.
“You should go visit, see what’s changed and what’s stayed the same since you were a student there yourself,” Mycroft said calmly, studying John over the rim of his wine-glass. “Just go talk to them, I’m sure Doctor Stamford would love to hear from you, even just for a catch-up over coffee.”
“Absolutely positive.” Judith looked around the bathroom, “I grew up with Timothy Almond, we were kids together. I used to live in this estate-housing. He was unstable when we were kids, I always thought he’d get shot or knifed on a drug-deal gone wrong.” She turned around and left the bathroom and three puzzled detectives.
“Well, would you look at that!” John whistled. They displaced the mother briefly while the boys put on blue PPE suits and gear, and she took them back to the scene. She had taped off the door used for entry and the trailer as well as marking off part of the road alongside to keep traffic out after calling a few units for backup.
“Mm, just thinking.” He met Mycroft’s gaze over the rim of his teacup. They both sat backs to the wall but facing each other, covering different angles of the dining room from the same table.
“Frances Almond, age six, youngest of six children, lived with her grandparents part-time.” She cleared her throat and looked over her shoulder at her brother, “John, it’s Frisk!”
“Won’t take a hint, will he?” John was aware of the tension between Sally and Philip Anderson, the circumstances, “You can do better than that, Sally.”
“Thank you, Stefan.” Mycroft just nodded and handed his coat and brolly off to the cute young hostess who materialized from somewhere else as they reached the hostess-station. John followed suit, giving the girl a friendly smile as she took his coat for him.
“What do they say about John Watson, then?” He stepped closer, desperate for any word of his missing friend. Sherlock wouldn’t be surprised if someone told him John was dead and buried these three years, “If they’re talking about Sherlock Holmes, what are they saying about John Watson? Surely they’re talking about him?”
“You too, Mrs Hudson. Be back later.” He waved and headed out the door. But no sooner had he set foot on the pavement than he was grabbed from behind and dragged backwards. He knew that hand and looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, who had run down after him.
“Small town, somebody tried to steal your brother’s wallet, and now my wife is wanted for attempted murder? Give ‘em something to do, Sherlock.” He chuckled and looked over at Hutchison. “Sure, give me a bit.”
It took a week to find someone who knew John’s name, and three days beyond that to put eyes on him. When Sherlock Holmes realised that he had overlooked the unassuming panhandler who sat in the alleyway leading to Tolmer’s Square just up the street from the Baker Street flat, minding his own business and watching the world pass him by without so much as a second glance, it was a “lightning strike” epiphany. Sherlock always dropped a coin or two in the small plastic cup, but never really paid him much mind. He only really paid attention when he heard a quiet voice as he passed by the alleyway on his way back from a long walk trying to clear his head.
“Oh, Donovan, if Doctor Watson needs anything, make sure she gets it, will you?” Sherlock ducked under the line and headed into the room. Judith caught sight of a housekeeping cart just up from her, and chewed on her lip. Like hell was she about to ask Donovan for help, but she could slip through before anyone caught her.
“Boys!” Mrs Hudson yelled from downstairs, “Making them wait any longer won’t make them go away, you know!”
“Mm.” The restaurant’s owner and manager nodded enthusiastically, “But having Judith Watson is not a bad business-move, I do not think. She is smart and gifted, yes?”
She fired off the last text in that thread and checked to make sure she hadn’t missed any from Sherlock, who was buried elbows deep in a project over at Saint Bart’s. She hadn’t missed anything new, which was probably good.
Sherlock rattled off everything they had on the victim and she folded her hands under her chin as she processed what they knew already. She was quiet and still for so long Sherlock actually dared to poke her in the back of the thigh with his foot while he stood behind her.
“This.” Sherlock took an envelope from his pocket and set it on her desk. She had sat down at her desk and he stood on the other side of it. She picked up the envelope and turned it over. She recognised the seal, but not the handwriting.
The chaos of the previous forty-eight hours comes to a head. Richard Brook is located and taken into protective custody, Kitty Riley is arrested on a short list of charges. Sherlock Holmes comes face-to-face with Jim Moriarty. There is only one way this can end. He only regrets that he wasn't able to say goodbye properly to his loved ones.
“Stephen Strange. It’s a pleasure to meet you finally, Inspector Lestrade.” He had a mild accent, American for sure. “The Watsons speak well of you, and often.”
“Ta.” He finished up quickly in the bathroom and shut off the light. As soon as Sherlock had turned down the bed and taken his side, John switched off the bedside lamp and rolled so they faced each other in the dark. They had slept many nights like this, bodies and minds aligned and calm, and when he felt a touch on his hand, Sherlock reached back. John was exhausted and was out in minutes. The familiar, soft snores were comforting and Sherlock let himself fall asleep. He hadn’t slept well for months, years even, but tonight he would sleep well knowing that it was safe for the moment.
“I was sitting on this house last night when you got home to find you had some unwelcome company. I was the one who responded to your neighbour’s call to Emergency Services. I’m very sorry my brother tried to take it out on your head.”
“Y’know. There’s whispers around that Sherlock ‘Olmes is back from the dead. Rose like Lazarus from his grave, right.” The soft voice, thick with a Highland accent, startled him. Sherlock stopped dead and looked over.
“Two weeks in the water, I’d look for any missing person reports filed under a victim with shoulder-length red hair and grey eyes.”
, Sherlock Holmes.” She fell asleep at an odd but comfortable angle, lulled by the soft snoring of her bed-mates.
Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside his office and hoped to god it wasn’t Sherlock. He heard Sally Donovan’s voice, trying desperately to tell someone off. Not Sherlock. He hadn’t closed his door all the way, and it crashed open as whoever had come for him stormed into the office. He watched, wincing, as the door almost hit John, who calmly reached out and caught the door before it slammed into him.
“That was my fault for not telling you. It just...sort of happened.” She nibbled on a biscuit, “Oh, Mrs. Hudson, this is Rick Marcus. He’s with me today.”
specifically, but as soon as she’d told Sally that she was apparently getting two weeks off to go…somewhere nice, the Sergeant’s eyes had brightened and she had made Judith
“Watson!” He groaned and rolled, covering his head with both arms. “Hey, Watson! Get up, your bail’s been posted! You’re getting out of here!” That got his attention and he struggled to sit up.
“I may come to regret trusting the likes of you and the other two with something like this, but I figure you’ll be smart with it.” Q just beamed at him and they returned to the work-table, where Q presented him with a box, inside which was his “retirement gift”. “Happy Retirement, 008. Don’t be a stranger.”
“Oh. Did I really make such a fleeting impression? Jim bit his lip as if disappointed. “But then, I suppose, that was rather the point.” He turned just as the sniper’s laser flickered over Judith’s upper chest. Sherlock briefly turned his head towards Judith.
“Oh my god!” Palmer whimpered. They got busy stitching Stephen up while he explained to Palmer just exactly what it was they did at Kamar-Taj, but how Judith didn’t actually
“Don’t leave the house without it!” She pulled the sling-ring from her duty-belt and slid it onto her right hand.
After he had booked Beverly Watson into jail, Greg went back to his desk to cut down on some of the paperwork that had been festering there. It was gone three before he bothered to check the time. He informed the family right away, speaking again with John, who seemed to be the family’s designated representative for this mess.
“Ask me next time?” She sighed, “I’m grateful, I really am, but I wasn’t going to make the move until this summer.”
“Mr Lachey, I really could care less about your criminal past,” Sherlock said with a casual shrug. “Unless you really
“That’s a hell of a lot to make up for, son.” John’s voice was soft, remarkably steady, as he took a sip of his drink. Sherlock felt his grip tighten and wondered when the shouting would start, when the abuse would come, when he would get what he so richly deserved for abandoning John and everyone else because he had been selfish and stupid and didn’t see any way out except alone.
“It will have to suffice,” Mycroft said as he gave Kitty a bit of a fuss. “Will you look for housing elsewhere? I realize I never asked after your housing situation.”
“Not his scene, never is.” Sherlock wasn’t even looking at the fence, he was completely focused on the cat.
“I need an assistant for the work I do in London, outside of my work for MI6, of course. But if that’s your sort of thing, I could probably work a security-clearance for you, too.” His smile turned into a cheeky grin and she raised an eyebrow at him. “If…top-secret, deep-cover fieldwork, I’d-have-to-kill-you-if-I-told-you work is your kind of thing, that is?”
a few minutes. She could very likely handle it by herself, but the fact that she was reaching out to him for help proved that she knew her own limits and respected them. He would help her turn back the clock on a very personal tragedy and put things back to rights.
despise him are pretty cruel. Between you two, Freak is almost a term of endearment. It’s Philip Anderson he doesn’t like at all.”
“My brother promised to handle that for me.” Sherlock moved so he was sitting behind John and put his arms around the expatriate prince, not afraid of expressing intimacy in front of Alexandra. He felt John relax and rested his chin on John’s shoulder.
“Oh, please. Yes.” Sherlock was polite when he smiled. John trailed the woman, apparently the couple’s housekeeper, to the kitchen and watched her. This had hit the family very hard, and he wondered how they could help. Curled up on the floor in a little alcove under the work-top were two adult Dalmatians, who regarded John with suspicion. He smiled and got down on their level, holding out one hand in invitation.
“Glad to.” John took the gloves Greg handed him, offering one pair to Sherlock, “Take it the Evil Twins aren’t thrilled about this?”
Once Stephen was patched up, they headed back to the Sanctum, where they found the dead Zealot who had pursued Stephen into the Astral Plane and tried to kill him.
“Oh, I don’t think so.” Sherlock slowly hauled himself to his feet, then looked down at the cabbie and smiled. “Not your kind of murder.”
“Oh, but I already have, my love!” John winked as he ducked into the car. Mycroft was trying and failing to hide his amusement as they got underway.
“This is Judith Watson.” Greg toed the door open as she pushed it open, not missing the way her eyes flashed.
“I have another set of vices, but those are the principal ones I can think of at the moment.” John just shrugged.
“Please ... do.” John sighed at the first touch of soft, slightly chapped lips. He loved kissing, adored it, it was a very enjoyable way to express and share affection with someone else, but he had to admit that Sherlock was new ground for him. Not his first male partner, not by a long shot, and it was clear Sherlock was a bit inexperienced but John found it endearing. And his enthusiasm more than made up for his naiveté.
be afraid of her, he wouldn’t treat her as a threat. She kept his house safe from the physical and the metaphysical, he wasn’t going to alienate her without damn good reason.
“Oh.” Well, shit, there it was. John felt a flush creep up his neck and swallowed hard on a throat that suddenly seemed too dry. “But you’re not ... um.”
Going back to the young constable, she pushed him back against the wall and forced him to sit down on the carpet.
“The same technology that I used to lock your side-arm to your palm-print, accepts only your fingerprints. Reads and responds in seconds.”
“So am I.” He shrugged and looked up as he caught sight of their server coming back with their starters. Once he was gone again, John looked across at Mycroft.
Donovan, Hughes, and Sherlock got as the dancers came out again after another short break and they recognized Judith. Mycroft chuckled at the absolutely gobsmacked expression on his brother’s face as Judith and Riyah danced at their table, leading the girls in a thoroughly entrancing dance. He took note of the many colourful scarves tied to Judith’s belt and knew they were favours. Lestrade was completely enthralled, and his focus explained the dusting of glitter on his coat and the scarf around his neck that Mycroft hadn’t noticed before. It was a very feminine, diaphanous thing of silk in gorgeous shades of blue and purple with silver accents that he was certain the strict, rule-abiding DI wouldn't wear without damn good reason. Ah, he had favour from Judith already.
Judith would have said something but made do with a dismissive, slightly obscene gesture because Stephen had decided that there were better things to be doing than talking. She had tried to push him towards Palmer, but that seemed to have backfired on her as she found herself following him through another sling-portal back to New York. His apartment had a spectacular view of the city, not that she was really paying attention to it. Sleeping with Stephen was a lot like sleeping with Sherlock, a bit of guilty fun that you couldn't really feel that sorry about after the fact because life was too short and really, they didn’t get much beyond cuddling.
“Steady on, Inspector.” She kept her voice steady, her hands were not shaking as she took aim at the monster that perched some few feet above them, prepared to pounce. Greg fired blindly as the monster came down closer to them, but Judith did not flinch as he fired right over her shoulder. She squinted, shook her head to clear it, and took straight aim. A few steps to her right, John opened fire at the same time. They took down the monster, venturing up to investigate once they were sure it was safe to do so. The creature turned out to be nothing more than a giant dog. Which explained a few things they had noticed.
“Thanks for coming up, Jude.” John got up to hug her, then went back to his blog. Sherlock, on the other hand, saw her down to the door and waved as she got back in the Rover and took the keys from Rick.
Part 2 of 2. Angst ahoy! Sherlock meets a most remarkable woman when John's estranged mother comes calling on Baker Street after the case, and John shows his true colors when Moriarty storms Baker Street on the pretense of protecting Sherlock from arrest. It gets violent very quickly.
“We probably should. She’s showing symptoms of an overdose, she shouldn’t be conscious right now with the volume of drugs in her system right now.”
He sighed and pocketed his phone, absently patting the box as he broke into an easy trot. Greg went down to the Sailing School, where Judith’s class had gathered for the ceremony. Some of them had shown themselves in street-clothes acceptable for dinner, while others, like Judith, had come in off the water with minutes to spare and had barely taken the time to put their gear away. It was short and fairly informal, but seeing the pride on each of the students’ faces for accomplishing something like this made him happy. Well, he was already happy, but it didn’t hurt.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock schooled a passably straight face and looked up into those intriguing eyes, now familiar to him.
mark on it.” Judith set the picture on the table. “Do you really want to go out of this world having five deaths on your conscience?”
None of them moved for a few seconds, their guns still aimed at that door, then Greg moved out from behind Sherlock.
“You’re more than just an Army doctor with a bad attitude, but that was obvious. In good standing with MI6’s director, which means you know M, but how escapes me. She doesn’t…”
“Hi, you gorgeous boy. What’s your name, then? Hmm?” He got hold of the collar and read his tag, “Oh, Pongo! Good, strong name for you, huh? You’re a good dog, aren’t you? That’s it, that’s for you.” He chuckled as the dog took the bit of jerky, “No teeth now, you hear me? A soft mouth on you.”
“Doing what Moriarty wants – I’m becoming a fugitive. Run.” He turned and started to run. Back at the cars, they heard the Chief Superintendent yelling orders.
“Baker Street. Back through there.” Her brother waved at a portal behind him, which closed as she got a glimpse of the Baker Street bedroom.
“No opening strange doors. You don’t know where they’ll take you. Turn around, leave, and go home.” She talked to herself, trying to talk herself
“Not if one of us was out of reach.” John mused, “I was with Intelligence ten years ago, they wouldn’t have been able to get word to me, and I wouldn’t have had any way of knowing after the fact, no one ever brought it up.”
“Thank you.” Gareth Mallory took the offered file and set it on his desk. “Good luck in the outside.”
After getting some decent work done, Roben called them to his office and laid down terms for them. Judith and Greg were being offered administrative leave for their part in the fiasco, to which they said good riddance and packed out for three months away from the chaos. Not only were they getting paid by The Met, which was going to annoy a
She was sitting on the bonnet of her squad-car with the Maine Coon queen on her shoulders, wondering if she should give the cat a name, when Homicide arrived. A cab pulled up first, and she knew right then that either Greg had called in reinforcements or the boys had been eavesdropping.
“They generally start to care when you go out of your way to rescue one of their top-level field agents, Gregory,” Mycroft said quietly.
“See you later, Locket!” Moriarty said cheerfully as he left Sherlock on his knees, hating himself, gone as quickly as he’d arrived. It wasn’t long before he heard footsteps again.
John had gone to the funeral, like he had the first time, and visited the cemetery every month just as he had for two years. The difference now was that he took Rosie with him instead of going by himself. She would leave little crayon-scribble drawings by the black headstone engraved with the name, dates, and epitaph of one of the kindest, smartest people John had ever known. And she would talk to Sherlock like he was actually there with them, like he was alive. She would tell him about whatever was going through her mind, what she was learning at school and such. It always made John smile just a little bit, in spite of the staggering grief that made his chest hurt.
“Sorry, John!” Another server whispered as they passed, her tray was full of glasses. “Saw you got Moriarty.”
It had already been a long, exhausting day when John Watson got a new table. There was something slightly pathetic about a veteran with twenty years of service in the Army reduced to near homelessness and no job prospects in the field he had the most experience in. Desperate for work and income to bolster his pension, John had taken up a position as a waiter at Quo Vadis in London. A swanky, upscale place on Dean Street with a private member’s club and a clientele that ranged from wealthy  tourists with cash to burn to equally wealthy, if less courteous, locals who had more money than sense and a nasty habit of looking down on you if they thought for a minute you were different from them.  He saw ambassadors and heads of state, government lackeys, doctors, venture capitalists, and rich business types all rubbing elbows with travellers from all corners of the world, often all in one night. Usually, his patrons were polite but demanding, but there were some nights when he just couldn’t please anyone.
He was aware of a flicker of motion by the door and turned that way. Unnoticed by either himself or by the cabbie, who couldn't see them due to the cover provided by the dark kitchen and the sliding-doors, he saw Judith Watson. She was in plain sight, crouched in the opening, but still concealed by the shadows and Sherlock’s position relative to Hope. He saw the Browning in one hand, the glint in her eye. She had orders. Only one of them would die tonight, and it wasn’t going to be him. Judith signalled him to keep quiet, but he wasn’t about to give her position away.
“I have to be, sir, or I wouldn't have made it this far in my life.” She cleared her throat, “Where are we going?”
“I need his help. Haven’t figured if I need remote access yet or not, but I need to look at the cameras in this area, I know they caught the driver.” She coughed, “We can put him through facial-recognition and have a name on him by tomorrow.”
“Here, drink.” The Ancient One handed her a brown ceramic cup, full of tea. “It will help.” Suspicious, but willing to play along if it got her some answers about what her brother had done here, Judith drank the tea. Not sure if the tea had been drugged or if it was just exhaustion, she was aware of a very heavy feeling in her body.
“And then I’m going to remind you, us, of the best part of being us.” John smiled up at him, that bright, smug smile that had been just for Sherlock.
As he entered the gents, he heard soft sobbing, which stifled as soon as he walked in. He paced along the stalls to the one locked and tapped on the door.
“Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you too.” He rubbed the back of his head, grimacing. With a parting wave, Lestrade's assistant was gone again.
“Well, to be fair, love, I was up here, almost eleven feet above your head, and I had my back to you the first time.”
“I know who you are, Mr ’olmes.” There was a smugness to the other man’s voice as he started to wander around the living room. “The moment you said your name, I knew. Sherlock ’olmes.” He picked up a magnifying glass from the bureau and lifted it to look through it at Sherlock before continuing around the room looking at various things.
“How do you know him anyway? You seem way too comfortable around him to be, uh, casual acquaintances.” Donovan led the way to the motor-pool, “Not that it’s any of my business.”
Sally hung up first and Greg pocketed his phone as he shrugged into his coat, looking up at John, who held the door for him.
“Okay, you win.” Lestrade downed the rest of his drink, his expression grim. “Jesus, I had no idea that was you.”
“Of course I am. Well, it’s more that I’m looking forward to spending time alone, away from our phones, with you.”
“Hmm.” He looked around and checked his watch. “I don’t see why not. We might have to fight the morning crowds, but nothing I can’t handle.” Judith belted the water and glanced at her own time-piece, a smart-watch of some kind.
“I know.” He folded his arms, studying the lazy young man in the bathtub. “Are you just going to stay in there until you turn all wrinkly and the water’s gone completely cold?”
“Not if Mycroft has anything to say about it, she sure won’t.” John sighed, “I may not be that girl’s biological father, but I’m all she’s got right now. I won’t turn my back on her, I can’t.”
he? He had to be somewhere nearby, he wouldn’t sit this out from the side-lines. Someone like Jim Moriarty would want to be front and centre of the final spectacle. At least, she assumed it would be the last spectacle. She hoped. Time to go hunting.
He had known John Watson for years, far more than he cared to count, and knew what happened when the man had no direction, nothing to occupy his time or his mind. He had seen similar behaviour from the veteran in 2009 when he had been discharged from the Army after quite a long career and had rather foolishly hoped that John wouldn’t repeat himself after his dismissal from MI6. No, dismissal was entirely the wrong word to use here. He had not been dismissed, he had been retired. One of a handful of senior agents who had outlived his own expectancy and therefore had the chance to retire in peace. But there were always a few in the batch who could never quite settle down quietly, and John Watson was certainly one of them.
“Quite a girl you’ve got there, Inspector.” The cheerful businessman sharing their table and half the bill said in an admiring tone.
“Very well, Mr. Hope. See you in the interview rooms.” Judith reached over and switched off the recorder.
seen them before, it had just been so very long since. On the left upper arm, from shoulder to just above the elbow, was a black line-art tattoo of a caduceus, the Rod of Asclepius and the two snakes; on the right, a quarter-sleeve tattoo in full, vibrant colour of the coat of arms of the Royal Army Medical Corps that stretched from shoulder to elbow; and peeking above the collar of his shirt, an anatomically correct heart. The arteries and aortic arch were clearly visible in strokes of black ink against pale skin that held just a hint of tan, and Sherlock recalled where the knotted lines of the scar on John’s chest broke up the lines of the tattoo. A reminder of just how frighteningly close they had come to losing each other without knowing. And how many times since 2011 had the same damn thing happened? Sherlock sighed and took a fortifying sip of his drink, leaning against the door to watch. He didn’t even notice John was gone until a hand landed on his arm and tightened, until a puff of warm breath hit the side of his neck as he was used as leverage to get John up on tip-toe.
“Almost guarantee it. It’s up to Molly Hooper to make that call, but just on circumstances, I’d say yes.” Judith folded her arms, “Sherlock?”
“I took my vest off in the ambulance and my nurse saw the blood on my uniform.” He shook his head, thinking of Bill Murray and how shocked the man had been as John explained himself while Bill stripped him to the waist and got busy stemming the bleeding and packing the wound, trying to keep him from bleeding out before they got to base. It had been a close one, and they’d taken him straight to surgery to stop the bleeding and remove any shrapnel in his shoulder. That had been the beginning of the end and the following year had been absolutely fucking miserable. Then Mycroft Holmes had found him, and the rest was happy history.
“Magic doesn’t exist?” The woman smiled, “Welcome to London Sanctum, Judith Watson. We’ve been waiting for you.”
“Of course.” John laid the case on his lap, setting his parka aside very carefully. “You can have it, Sherlock. I…I want you to have it.”
unique individual. She was walking in Westminster, when suddenly, Judith found herself standing still. She didn’t remember stopping, and yet…she had. Trying to move failed her, and she looked around. No one else was bothered by what
“Mm. I can only imagine with what.” She rolled her eyes, “Did you ever get around to changing your clothes?”
