He had been looking forward to spending a relaxing holiday with his friend and not even that had been able to happen.  They hadn't had time to put up a tree or do any decorating.  John was no Martha Stewart but Sherlock loved fairy lights and he had always put some up in the past, to Sherlock's delight.  This year, though, the thought hadn't even crossed either of their minds.  He hoped the lack of holiday cheer wouldn't throw Sherlock into a funk.  It had surprised him how much the usually unsentimental man had loved Christmas.
"Would be lovely, thanks."
"I suppose that's a fair assessment.  I like being lost in a crowd.  Observing."
Sherlock's arse was not a hairy one to begin with, as arses go.  Hell, John's own arse had more hair on it, and he didn't particularly have a hairy arse either.  Still, John winced a bit at the thought of someone coating it with wax before ripping it off.  Perhaps Sherlock was less sensitive than John had thought.
"And, he seemed... nice, you know? We seemed to automatically connect."
Sherlock comes back in and helps John up.  It will take a bit of maneouvering to get him into the bathroom, let alone the tub.  John knows his foot will need a brace, but right now it's too swollen, so he has to be very careful not to bend it or put any weight on it.  Initially, he's nervous about Sherlock handling him in that state; his taller companion's movements are typically dexterous and fleet, but when he becomes agitated and his control slips he can be a bit rough without meaning to be.  To John's relief he helps him to the bathroom gently, gingerly, his touch soft but strong and firm, handling John as though he were a precious trinket that could break at any slight mishandling.  John's a bit moved; he hadn't realized that Sherlock, for all his fire and brimstone, could be so tender.
and sucked one tender testicle into his mouth, then the other.  Sherlock's breath picked up and his cock gave a hungry little bounce as he pulled his knees up silently.  John looked up the bed to make eye contact with him, but the brunet had his face and eyes scrunched up tight, even as he rolled back to expose his rear.
What could he say now? What could he possibly say to fix things? There was nothing. If he said
Sherlock's lips curled into a positively bewitching smile.  "Happy Christmas, John."
He picked up his mug and took a sip, the eyeball forgotten.
, but in the back of his mind, Sherlock was also aware that this evening he was standing on a precipice. The wedding was going to change everything, regardless of whether he acknowledged it outwardly or not, regardless of whether John claimed it would or not, and suddenly the finality of it all hit him. John hadn't lived with him since he returned from the dead, but Sherlock knew that he could expect his companion to visit less and less, his visits becoming rarer and more perfunctory as his new wife and home tugged him in another direction. John, dropping in on a rainy Tuesday, running up the stairs on a Saturday afternoon, bringing him take-away on a Friday night... soon it would all be nothing more than a ghost of a memory, a haunting presence to follow Sherlock barefoot throughout the lonely, empty flat.
"You'd do anything for him, correct?"
There above Sherlock's erection was an approximately one by two inch rectangle of dark coppery hair, neatly clipped, staring back at him as though daring him to comment.  The rest of Sherlock's groin was smooth and white.  Even the wrinkled plum of his scrotum, usually sporting several very fine baby hairs, was shorn clean.
"To myself," he explains.
," Sherlock moaned.
"Probably," John agreed, sipping his drink.  "That is, if you listen to your doctor."
"Thank you, Doctor," Sherlock breathed as he slid underneath the duvet.
Perhaps, thought Sherlock, that was the problem. Perhaps he was taking things too slowly. Perhaps if he were just a bit faster... perhaps if he solved this case really fast, John would change his mind and stay in all the chairs.
~~~~~
Sherlock quietly got up from the bench.
He keeps this thought to himself but it's ultimately what allows him to sleep.
He laid in the crack house, a pile of dirty rags with dark, curly, greasy hair, on top of a putrid mattress, brain addled and lost in a fugue of glorious sensation. He slid his hands around on top of the blankets, fingers grasping, hands twitching, letting neurons fire and signals fight their way up to his drug-infused brain. If he squeezed his eyes tight enough, he could get them to reflexively water; it was a sad pantomime of tears, but at least it made him feel like he was trying.
Sherlock and John sat on a park bench. It was mild, but Sherlock still wore his magnificent coat.
Pulling John's arm around his shoulder for the fourth or fifth time that day, Sherlock helps his companion up to perch on the curved edge of the tub; John steadies himself with his free hand and unaffected foot.  Slowly, carefully, they lower him in bum first.  The water is quite hot and John hisses a little, his skin prickling with the sensation, but he slowly eases into it with a soft exhale as the water moves to cover his skin, rushing up to fill every nook and cranny on his battered body.  John feels a little sheepish at his own breaths and small vocalizations, which in another context could be considered quite erotic in nature, but Sherlock doesn't comment.  John's swollen ankle stays out of the tub, but his other appendages find their way in, and he sighs and leans back into the speckled porcelain.  He's relaxing, finally, really relaxing for the first time since the ordeal ended.  They had cleaned him up a bit at the hospital but he hadn't had a bath, and of course no one ever really relaxes at a hospital anyway, especially not doctors.
"I always listen to you."
The evening prior, they had gone out to dinner and John had the waiter box up a huge pink sugary cupcake to take home.  To his great shame, he wolfed the entire thing down less than an hour before bed.
Sherlock endeavoured but was unable to keep from fidgeting.
~~~~~
Sherlock pressed his lips into a fine line and began to breathe heavily into the phone in spite of himself.
In short, he can smell John, his clean skin, his shampoo, simply because there are literally pieces of him in his nose.
That was a week ago, and there was no reply as of yet.
Sherlock, whose watery expression is currently reminding John of a large fish tank he had as a child; Harry used to peer at him from behind it, the lines of her face cloudy and undulating, much like Sherlock’s are now.
Sherlock was hot with shame and regret at Mycroft's voice. "Why did I bother to call someone like you," he seethed into his mobile, fingers poised to end call. But before he could, his brother spoke again.
"Right. Look, Mary was wondering..." John paused and looked up, a bit sheepish. His expression was soft and it made Sherlock positively ache with some sort of nondescript want. "Well,
He reached over and turned down the dial on his morphine drip.
John smiles softly, laying his head back on the tub again.  "No, they cant."
"Easy," John winces, and Sherlock eases up but doesn't pull his head entirely away.  They sit there that way for a minute or two, John ruffling Sherlock's ridiculous hair and Sherlock drawing comfort from being close to John's body.
Sherlock is a scientist, and so he knows all about the mechanisms of olfaction.  The fact that he can smell John in this moment means that odourous molecules have transported into his nasal cavity to the olfactory epithelium, where they binded to receptor proteins in the cilia, initiating an electric signal that travels to the brain and is interpreted as a scent.
On one hand, John had loved Sherlock's body hair the way it was.  It was soft and sexy and just long enough to tuft a bit without getting ridiculous.  Body hair was
Sherlock spent the next hour and a half aimlessly scrolling through results, his eyes taking it in but his brain seemingly coated in Teflon. He pored over advice columns, religious self-help websites, and poorly-spelled sob stories on yahoo answer forums before he happened upon a Q & A of quotes about love, unrequited and otherwise.
"John," he said far more desperately than he meant to, "we've one night."
"Yes. Yes, I'm going out with Janine, I thought that was fairly obvious."
(John knew, of course, that removing body hair didn't necessarily make someone a slag, but Pretty Young Sherlock had always been his favorite fantasy.)
"Fine. But stay. Out of it."
It took a short while for John to get the hang of it, but once he did, Sherlock let him take the lead. The flat was spinning around him as he danced in John's arms, the world falling away into nothing but trivialities as reality was sublimated into just the two of them, their warm bodies, John's breath and eyelashes and his lips oh-so-close. Sherlock dared to look him in the eye and felt his skin prickle when John looked back. Time became elastic, dragging on and snapping back concurrently, and for the first time Sherlock found himself wondering if perhaps the rest of the world actually knew something he didn't.
"If only."
"It's Sherlock," Mrs Hudson had said to John once.  "Who knows what goes on in that funny old head of his."
He had hoped it wouldn't get this bad, but he knew the possibility was there and very real.
"John."
The tub is filled now, so he shuts off the faucet.  John is surprised to note that Sherlock has added bubble bath to the water.  A small mountain of foamy bubbles floats serenely on top of the water, crackling softly in the hazy heat of the bathroom.  How silly and frivolous it seems, given the day they'd had.  Come to think of it, John hadn't even known they had bubble bath in the flat.  It's a bit endearing and unexpected.
For once Sherlock obeyed and said nothing for the duration of his agonizing trip up the stairs.  He sat on the arm of the sofa for a moment, once he was inside the flat, to catch his breath.
"John.  Put up the tree.  Please?"  Sherlock looked at him squarely from the sofa, his expression forlorn.
"Oh Sherlock!" Mary exclaimed, grabbing his arm chummily. "Neither of us were the first, y'know."
Sherlock watched intently as John spoke to his old acquaintance; he was leaning in, nodding enthusiastically, treating the man with the utmost reverence and respect. Since John had only mentioned the commander in passing but had glossed over details, Sherlock had obviously grossly underestimated how much this other man meant to him.
He was such a better man now.
John stomped out to build the goddamned fire.  Secretly, though, he was glad to have company.
Hands trembling slightly, face red with shame, puffing on a cigarette, he reached for his laptop and googled
"John, there's... something I should say. I've always meant to say it and I never have..."
"Is the temperature alright?"  It's an unnecessary question.  Anyone watching would be able to deduce the temperature was perfect, based on John's reactions-- let alone the great Sherlock Holmes.
John's smile made Sherlock's heart clench in his chest. After a little pause, he said "Yeah."
"Romanticising is dangerous, John."  Sherlock's gaze was pointed, but not angry.
Now Sherlock chuckled.  "'S fine.  Besides, I love your pubic hair too.  Thick and golden."  He ventured a hand behind himself to run his fingers through damp wiry curls.  John wasn't a particularly hairy man either, but unlike Sherlock, his pubic hair was quite wiry and covered a wider range.  John very carefully trimmed himself with scissors, but seeing as he was considerably hairier, he knew waxing would be quite painful.
John fell asleep and Sherlock didn't wake him until nearly midnight, instead choosing to sit across from him and silently watch the shadows of flames lick and curl around his companion's lovely face.
"Why would I ever want to do that?"
"Waltz?" John asked, surprised.
filled the room once more.
“I’m not a villain, I’m a businessman! Acquiring assets!”
Sherlock caught his breath and then said, with a little less pep, "That one you just set down, move it three boughs to the right and then turn the tree on."
"It was the only time of year things were consistently cheerful," Sherlock said softly.  "Fairy lights, decorations, the sort.  Could make anybody feel good."  His voice was deep and breathy, adding weight to the stillness of the room.  When John didn't say anything, he continued.  "We always had a grand tree in the hall.  Huge glorious thing.  When you're a small boy it only seems grander.  My parents never decorated it, they let the help do it.  I used to order them about, if you can imagine."
The change of energy in the room was palpable, and Sherlock wrenched himself around on the mattress.
"Well, yes but... I mean... you're in a relationship."
"John." Sherlock hopped up and walked over to him. "Just putting the finishing touches on your waltz." He stood in front of John now, grey eyes as unguarded as they'd ever been. One good thing to be said about this selfless lark: it forced Sherlock to let his guard down. Almost surrender. He looked John in the eyes and felt the familiar warmth curling about his chest.
There was something bawdy and salacious about the waxing, as though Sherlock was a lewd young slag prowling around looking for older men to fuck him, always smooth and prepared.
Oh yes. Sherlock knew this one well. The two of them, they did seem to automatically connect. And John was, in fact, quite nice, even if Sherlock wasn't.
"What about that sweet arsehole?" John asked lecherously.  "You've done that too?"
And he's afraid that if he opens his mouth, he'll either wail out in despair or do the one thing a man such as himself doesn't do, and weep.  So he keeps his jaw set, his lips pushed tightly together in a fine line, and tries with all of his might to oscillate focus outward, on the task at hand, while actively avoiding meeting John's gaze.
Sherlock sucked in a breath and turned over onto his side in his bed. He turned on the lamp and caught a glimpse of his own face in the mirror. He was flushed and feral-looking. His crotch was hot and hard.
"Oh!  Yes that one."  That seemed to satisfy Sherlock for a quick moment, until he remembered there was no tree.  "John, I need a tree.  It's Christmas Eve, we need trees."
They sat that way for a small eternity, foreheads touching, hands caressing, palms rubbing against each others' necks and jawlines.  John leaned in until their noses were touching and finally, finally broke the tension with a firm, slow kiss on Sherlock's mouth.  Sherlock, he of no physical experience, was content to let John do as he pleased, now high on more than simple painkillers.  As John pulled away, he reached up to the back of his neck to hold him near his lips.
"John," Sherlock's voice is gravelly, but tender.  He sucks in a breath.  "John, I'd... I'd like to bathe you."
"I... what do I do?" His voice was thick and pleading, dripping with unspoken requests.
"Yes.  And pour me one of those, I'm dry as a bone."
~~~~~
Sherlock knew that John and Mary lived next door to a woman whose son had a drug problem.
Sherlock inhaled sharply and swallowed. "S..so, in fact... you mean..."
"I did," Sherlock breathed, but it was unnecessary as John's hand had slid below to feel around for itself.  Sherlock spread his legs for better access.
Sherlock's chest jumped in amusement, a short exhale of breath.  "I like being admired by people who matter."
He was lucky that she simply wanted to use him as a way to score a book deal. He was luckier that she didn't realize he knew that. And they were both lucky she didn't actually expect him to have sex with her. On top of that, Janine was surprisingly perceptive about Sherlock's feelings for John.
"Yeah. I'd like that a lot, Sherlock."
"Yes," he said matter-of-factly. "Sydney Opera House. Pound cake with marzipan and royal icing. Bergamot with citrus notes."
So, selflessly, Sherlock put out his hand.
~~~~~
"That'd be... Yes. Please. That'd be lovely, Sherlock."
John waits for him to speak.  "John, you must..." he starts, his tone charmingly needy.  "When you are fit again, you must let me have... an evening with you."  That sounds ridiculous, Sherlock thinks darkly.  John couldn't possibly know how badly he needs this-- to mark John, to slowly strip him and push him down and climb on him and
"This hair," he murmured softly, carding buttery-soft strands through his fingers.
"Your cock," John said labouriously, hand ghosting over Sherlock's smooth nether regions.  He leaned forward, kissing the soft skin between Sherlock's shoulders (another con to being relatively short: not being able to reach your lover's neck from behind).  John couldn't lie, the shorn skin sheathing his cock made the glide that much more delicious, smoothness yielding as his cock pushed in and out.  He cupped Sherlock's clean bollocks before rubbing Sherlock's cock just the way he liked.
He trudged into bed at two AM but tossed and turned until five, when he gave up and went out to the sofa, staring ahead unseeingly in the quiet darkness.
"Hmm."  John didn't really have a reply, and Sherlock didn't press for one.  They fell into a companionable silence and John began to wonder if his companion had fallen asleep until he spoke again.
"Manscaping?  Do you want me to?"
"Shall I take you in my mouth?  Would you like to come down my throat before I fuck you?" John asked deviously.  He absolutely adored talking this way in the bedroom.  It made Sherlock even pinker.
John knew.  At this point he had imagined Sherlock in pretty much every lewd fantastical scenario possible, some he would be willing to admit to and some he wouldn't.  Sherlock was blessed with
All he had to do until then was simply pass the time.
, John."  He says it very lowly, looking very grimly serious.  John hesitates for a moment.  What is he after, he wonders.  Not sex, if Sherlock wouldn't be getting into the tub.  That at least is good.  John couldn't handle sex right now.  But why did Sherlock want to bathe John?  Perhaps to see for himself that he was okay?
He wasn't gay.  He didn't lust after Sherlock's abs or anything like that.  He liked women and was attracted to women and always would be.  But Sherlock transcended gender somehow; John was in love with the most compelling, spellbinding person he'd ever known, and it was just happenstance that he was male.  It had been a long time coming but he felt okay about it.  Sherlock desperately didn't want him to leave and he desperately didn't want to leave him.
John just smiles, as he is wont to do, and leans his head into Sherlock's hand, reaching up to brush some frizzy curls out of his lover's eyes, not caring that his hand is wet.
During the day, Sherlock could usually occupy himself well enough to feel alright. He really wanted a smoke more than ever these days, but he somehow managed to come up with ways to get his mind off of it. He knew that smoking would make John angry, and not the Good Angry.
Sherlock squirmed and shifted his hips a bit, closing his eyes and letting his mouth hang open.  The room became quiet, punctuated only by deliciously wet, obscene sounds of John's sucking.  John rubbed Sherlock's bollocks gently, the sparse furriness he was used to stripped away.  It was a new feeling, not unpleasant.  John, wondering if the taste was any different, pulled off of Sherlock's cock with a soft
."  He was on all fours, his head bent over, his face obscured by curly dark hair that was overdue for a cut.
John found himself rubbing Sherlock's scalp.
"So why don't you see him anymore?"
"Can you sleep in your dressing gown?" John asked once he had sat Sherlock down on the side of the bed.  "Might be easier to check your bandages that way."
After Sherlock had agreed to be his Best Man and John had gone, Sherlock sat in his chair for four hours, three minutes, and thirty-six point four seconds before giving in (hateful!) and calling Mycroft. His brother picked up on the fourth ring, waiting just long enough for Sherlock to begin to have second thoughts about the decision to call.
"Oh John," Sherlock bit off desperately.  "Oh
Sherlock is a lucky man.  "Sherlock, I promise that when I'm back to my full strength, we'll have an evening entirely to ourselves, and you can wrestle with me or mark me or do anything--" He catches Sherlock's expression perking up and corrects himself quickly.  "Well, almost anything, you please."
He was really pounding into Sherlock now.  Skin slapped against skin, the bed shook with the force.  John was high on endorphins.
..."  He bites off his sentence, already feeling exposed enough.  He's breathing rapidly through his nose, his lips ground together in a tight line.  "This wasn't supposed to happen.  Never.  Not to you."
John numbly wonders if this is the event that will sever Sherlock Holmes' last fragile strand of sanity, although on some level he's relieved to see Sherlock snap, cutting the tension that's been building over the past few hours.
, putting the cup down and running shaking hands through unruly raven hair before scrubbing them across his own face.  His dark laughter breaks up into chunks until it sounds more like sobbing.
Her hair, unkempt. Her right shoe worn down more than her left, walking with an uneven gait. Quite plain-looking. Owns two catigans. Cardigans. Cats. Nervous, recently began drinking decaf coffee.
"Yes I have." In actuality, Sherlock had forgotten that Janine was in his room until Mycroft tried to pry in to look for drugs. He'd gotten so occupied with his thoughts that he had simply left her there while he went out to look for another fix.
Put an end to that, he thought.  Obviously it was causing hallucinations.
John was thankful that Sherlock couldn't see his eyebrows shimmy up towards his hairline.  Sherlock talking about his childhood.  Now they were getting somewhere.
He sat in his chair, thinking about it for a little over three hours, eyes boring into the empty armchair in front of him, before he could bring himself to do it.
"Damn."  Sherlock leaned his head back on the sofa to stretch out his long neck, his eyes focused on the ceiling.  "Hopefully I'll be back in shape by New Year’s."
the most unsociable...?" the jealous beast inside of him blabbed before he could stop it. "Ah. That's why he's bouncing around him like a puppy." Truly, Sherlock found the whole thing disgraceful. Didn't John have any idea how he looked, trailing behind taller men with his big blue eyes? He had half a mind to march right up there and tell him as much.
"Here's to many more happy Christmases together."
"Yes," John said encouragingly.
He couldn't possibly know it at the time, but he would look back on this evening as a turning point.  The next words out of his mouth were lubricated but sincere and mercifully said before he had a chance to feel self-conscious about them.
Don't worry, I'll write about the reunion and the military aspect eventually. I just wanted to focus on their dynamics first.
“I love you too,” John said breathlessly and Sherlock could clearly see the vulnerability in his still teary eyes. So insecure, so fragile after all… “God, I love you, Sherlock.” He smiled at the other man. Then, after a while: “You’re right, it is what it is.”
“Keep it down, both of you!” John commanded with all the authority of
Lestrade joined them a few minutes later. “Are you guys alright? I heard the gunshot.”
“I’m not hungry and you can’t force me into eating breakfast.” Sherlock wrapped his dressing gown tighter around his lean frame and pouted.
Sherlock didn’t reply to that because he felt that even a simple 'yes, sir' was enough to violate the rules John had just set for him.
. “It always makes me feel uneasy when you deliberately neglect your basic needs for a case. I’m so proud of you, Sherlock, and you’ve clearly earned a reward for that.”
Sherlock decided to tackle
“You’re tired,” Sherlock stated the obvious.
John gave him a confused look. “You think I…
, your fucking mouth!” John groaned breathlessly when a talented tongue flicked over the slit again and again.
“Sherlock, please,” John was begging now, sounding slightly concerned.
“I’ll think about it if I get to solve this case before the weekend.” For the second time this evening, Sherlock seemed to refocus on his experiment while his mind was not at all occupied with the samples of the victim’s blood and the different toxins. If anything, he did in fact think about the invitation now. Knowing that John would appreciate it if he came along did not at all benefit his decision making process. It was a two-sided coin that Sherlock kept turning over and over in his mind.
“If you insist,” Sherlock said curtly. He was still sceptical, but as a general rule he trusted John – more than he had ever trusted anyone.
“He’s not in trouble, is he?” the landlady asked, sat down at the kitchen table and gestured for John to do the same.
“You’re lying! We had a bloody deal!” Thomas brought even more distance between him and the police officers.
John only smiled as he clicked on the 'post' button. “You know it wouldn’t hurt you to read my blog from time to time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock almost choked on his tea. This wasn’t exactly on his list of favourite things to talk about first thing in the morning (or ever) and the question did catch him off-guard.
Sherlock had never felt more turned on… and frustrated. Oh, yes, definitely frustrated. His heart was pounding wildly against his ribcage when he felt his orgasm build for the second time. “Please, sir,
Sherlock’s cheeks turned bright pink at the praise. It wasn’t the first time John commented on his blow job skills, but getting that kind of praise from someone he considered his Dom made his skin tingle. Sherlock swirled his tongue around John’s girth and bobbed his mouth up and down in fluent, gliding movements, occasionally sucking hard at the glans, just the way John liked it. After a while, his lips became sloppy and some of the mix of his saliva and John’s precome started trickling down his chin and his hand and the expanse of John’s cock between both.
Sherlock chose his answer carefully. He did not want John to feel guilty about exploring their kinky side because of
“Then it’s time to get to the fun part.”
Sherlock thought about it, avoiding the ones he had already used because it also reminded him of
it!” John hissed.
Sherlock held perfectly still and let John fuck his mouth until he gathered enough self-control again and stopped the shallow thrusts. John caressed Sherlock’s head briefly, then lay down on his back again and threw his forearm shieldingly over his eyes. The very image of Sherlock’s red, lush lips wrapped around his cock would be enough to tip him over the edge any second now. “Shit, I’m sorry, Sherlock. Please don’t stop. I’m so close, sweetheart,” he moaned and Sherlock felt his own arousal pool low in his abdomen.
Sherlock was on the verge of tears and his entire body shivered with the force of the strict denial. He was panting so hard that John feared he might black out from it. “Breathe, Sherlock, shhh. Deep, calm breaths of air. Just like that, theeere you go.” It still took a while until Sherlock began to calm down again. This time, John waited for Sherlock’s erection to flag a bit before he decided that Sherlock was ready for the next round of edging.
,” Greg gestured straight ahead. They split up and John looked frantically for a tall man with dark, curly hair. He almost panicked when five minutes went by without even the slightest trace of Sherlock. Another two minutes passed before he spotted Sherlock’s silhouette in front of the huge window facade to his right. John redoubled his pace and arrived just in time to see that Sherlock was trapped against one of the glass panels at gunpoint. John quickly assessed the situation: this time, there was only the curved metal of the trigger between Sherlock and a bullet.
John took a deep breath before he answered the phone. Calls from Clara were rarely good news. “Hey, Clara,” he greeted her and she didn’t leave him any time to say more than these two words.
When they stepped into the by now familiar corridor Lestrade slowly turned away from the couple and took a few steps towards the interrogation rooms, giving them some space to agree on whether or not John would stay.
“His name is Greg, Sherlock.
Lestrade sighed exasperatedly. “As I’ve already explained to you–”
“I’m afraid we’ll have to stock up on toast and jam.” They broke into a giggling fit.
Sherlock contemplated the possibilities of that aspect given their developing dynamics. “I haven’t changed my mind about that, but under the right circumstances I might let you take care of me. I’m still married to my work, but feel free to
Again, John only looked at him. “I’m lucky you’re mine.” He locked eyes with the other man. “You are so beautiful, Sherlock.”
“You’re so good for me, Sherlock. Such a good boy.” John kissed him affectionately. “Don’t move. I’ll be back in a sec.” John went to the bathroom and returned with a wet flannel and a glass of water. He wiped them both clean, removed Sherlock’s 'blindfold' and guided them back to the sofa. He wasn’t exactly tired again, but a little rest would be important for Sherlock.
“I’m not sure how to explain this, but I hope you’ll understand it anyway. It… it turns me on to know that it turns you on? Yep, that’s probably as precise as it gets,” John giggled nervously.
Sherlock was relieved when John asked him no more questions about emotional context. He knelt down on the soft leather cushions, his knees a shoulder-width apart, then leant forward to brace both forearms on the backrest. He rested his head on top of his arms for comfort and arched his hips ever so slightly to draw John’s attention even more to the pale skin of his arse. The mere thought of having the whole area covered with red, stinging welts was enough to make Sherlock’s half-hard cock twitch in anticipation.
“Half of my old squad will be there too. Do you have any idea what it looks like if their former Captain does not show up to the reunion without even responding to the invitation?”
he had used them. He’d need a good one… “Tungsten.”
Sherlock reached out for John’s hand and intertwined their fingers lightly. John’s thoughts only confirmed the things he’d recently learned about Dom drop. “I’m not comfortable talking about it, but I have to, so please just… listen. I didn’t drop without you noticing it or anything. To be honest, John, yesterday was the first time in a long time that I didn’t drop after a scene. You caught me before I even knew I needed it.” He smiled at John and felt relieved when he saw the first traces of re-established confidence flicker over John’s face. “Actually, it’s
John heaved a sigh and forced himself to look at her. “We were working on a case together. One of the suspects escaped and had to be brought back from Seville. At the airport, he managed to get hold of one of the police officers’ gun and… well, Sherlock ran after him. Unarmed as usual, of course.”
my good boy, Sherlock, even when you’ve earned a punishment. In fact, especially then. I wouldn’t have to punish you if I didn’t care about you.”
“Yes, of course. Just make sure to pop in tomorrow. I still need Sherlock’s help and I’ll also need your statements on this, but there are enough charges to file in the meantime.” Lestrade tilted his head towards the handcuffed man.
John was still lean but athletic from his army days with just the tiniest hint of pudge around his middle. Sherlock was glad he’d helped him find a healthy balance again after all those weeks of self-neglect –
They couldn’t possibly arrive in time. “John!” he called and headed for the sitting room. “John, get ready, hurry up. We’re leaving in five minutes!”
Sherlock woke with a start. He had no idea how long he’d slept for or why he had fallen asleep in the first place. The first thing he noticed was that John had already got up. Sherlock let his hands roam over the sheets; the fabric was cool (John must have woken up at least an hour ago) and ruffled (more than usual). Sherlock stretched luxuriously and kicked the duvet off. He heaved a sigh when he looked at his smartphone… four hours. He’d wasted
“Morning, sweetheart,” he mumbled drowsily and wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist, pulled the other man’s slender frame closer against his own body.
are on edge ever since it happened the first time. You feel like it’s your fault, but you can’t take it back so you try to protect me whenever you can.”
Lestrade rolled his eyes at him. “For God’s sake, Sherlock, are you even interested in the bloody case?” he asked mildly annoyed.
John wrapped both arms around Sherlock’s shaking frame and Sherlock simply broke. He clung tightly to John’s warm, soft jumper and buried his face in the crook of John’s neck as he uttered a series of heavy sobs. “I’m sorry, John. I’m a fucking idiot, I’m so sorry,” he snivelled.
For the second time this morning, John smirked at his lover with glinting eyes. “Here’s the deal, soldier: You don’t get to touch yourself. You can beg all you want, but
He was thankful that John offered him the latter option, but his throbbing erection was hard to ignore. “Now. Please, now, sir,” he answered, already in the right headspace.
John set his teacup aside and shifted closer towards the other man. Obviously, Sherlock didn’t like to talk freely about his kink, but John had a feeling that there was more to it. He placed one hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck and massaged small circles onto the skin. Sherlock closed his eyes and immediately relaxed under the reassuring touch.
you wouldn’t let me do this for you.”
Sherlock secretly wondered what it would feel like if he manhandled
“Will you come with me? Next Saturday, I mean?” John looked at his boyfriend and smiled nervously. He knew how much Sherlock hated those kinds of events, but for some reason it was important to him. The others would bring their partner along as well.
John leant back and grinned. Sherlock’s knuckles had turned white with the effort to obey John’s command and his body was quivering all over. The head of his jutting erection was already wet with precome… John knelt down on the floor between Sherlock’s legs.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, soaking up the heat of Sherlock’s naked skin on his while he kissed him affectionately. It started soft and slow with John unhurriedly brushing their lips together, licking and sucking and nibbling at Sherlock’s lush bottom lip till Sherlock impatiently plunged the tip of his tongue past the seam of John’s lips. He flicked his tongue against John’s, slowly, hesitantly, waiting for the other man to take control again… but John let him dominate the kiss. Sherlock swirled his tongue around his boyfriend’s, gently sucked on the warm, slick muscle and hummed contentedly when John gave a soft moan.
“Skip the difficult memories and keep on having fun with you? Sure.” John grasped Sherlock’s cock again, firmer this time, and started with a fast pace right away. “The second time, I’d almost seen it coming, but of course that didn’t make it any less disappointing for me. Do you remember how you broke the second promise, pet?” John’s rhythm slowed and Sherlock growled in frustration. He knew that he was supposed to answer John’s question, but he was so out of his mind with arousal that he could barely even think.
Sherlock flinched, feeling disappointed when the leather didn’t make contact with his skin. “Please, John,” he drawled and tried to nibble at John’s cock again, but John held him back.
his feelings in long overdue tears and gentle touches. Neither of them had ever dared to say it out loud, let alone show it, but they had always loved each other. Sherlock half-hoped, half-feared that the kind of love John felt for him was the same kind of love he felt for John: real, intimate, unconditional.
'He wants to hear me begging again,' Sherlock thought, the realisation suddenly clear as day. Of course, he could easily oblige. Or perhaps… Sherlock closed his eyes and reached down to give his neglected cock some much-needed attention.
“When you were ranting about being bored, you also said that I am easy to please. I don’t care where you got this ridiculous idea from, but I want you to prove it. If you want any more impact play, you’ll have to earn it, pet. Show me how easily you can please me with the pants still on.”
Sherlock tentatively intertwined his fingers with John’s. He was relieved when John let him. “You don’t have to watch the interrogation at all, John,” he insisted and looked straight into the other man’s eyes, making it very clear that it was more than a simple suggestion. He knew exactly what was going on in John’s mind and he wouldn’t let him suffer through facing Thomas again if he couldn’t help with the case anyway. “I don’t mind if you go home already. I won’t be long,” Sherlock said and pressed his lips gently against John’s temple.
John took one of the bigger sofa cushions and put it on the floor next to the coffee table. “Get up,” he commanded and helped Sherlock by steadying his upper body with both hands. Sherlock’s skin felt warm and damp under John’s fingertips, but it was nothing compared to the hot, sweaty mess Sherlock would be when he was done with him. “Kneel down on that cushion and get as comfortable as possible. You’ll stay there for quite a while.”
John looked at him incredulously. “But I hurt you, Sherlock, and not in the consensual way!”
Greg bit his lip and seemed to think about it for a moment. “Deal,” the DI said curtly and stood up from his desk. “But I
“We should really make his name into an adjective, don’t you think? It would be easier to describe at least nine out of ten things that way,” she quipped.
who dropped. Dom drop is far less common than sub drop, but obviously it’s not a good place for you, so please let me help you get out of it.”
“Hey, gorgeous,” John whispered sleepily and tilted his head up to give Sherlock a proper good morning kiss.
Sherlock flinched when John’s familiar voice disturbed his thoughts. “Yes, I’m just really engrossed in this experiment,” he answered as matter-of-factly as possible but a tad too quickly. He turned his head to look at John who was standing slightly behind him and granted his boyfriend a short smile.
John snapped out of his thoughts and looked around. It wasn’t much of a surprise his feet had automatically carried him near his favourite pub. He was, however, surprised to see Lestrade standing outside, smoking and chatting with a group of other Yarders. John smiled and walked up to him.
“Come, coming, c– AAH!” John cried out and Sherlock felt the hot spurts of John’s release spill straight down his throat.
“Hm, that’s a decent breakfast and still plenty of time. I want to get you out of Dom drop before you go and it’s absolutely crucial to make you feel as comfortable as possible.”
.  He had definitely underestimated John. “God, Captain, I’m so desperate for it. Please let me come…
Though his face was turned away from the door, Sherlock closed his eyes instinctively as John entered the room. He heard the rustling sound of fabric hitting the floor and seconds later John lay down next to him. “Sherlock?” he whispered into the dark silence between them. Sherlock opened his eyes. At least John’s speech wasn’t overly slurred. “Please look at me, sweetheart. I know you’re not asleep yet.”
Sherlock felt relieved. “I’m glad we agree on that one.”
“Look, I’m not mad at you because you read the invitation, love. It’s just that I almost missed it and apparently you weren’t too inclined to tell me about it.”
John put his jacket on the coat rack and slowly turned to look at Sherlock. “
“Yes.” John put the phone aside and shifted back into a lying position.
“Sorry, it’s really hard to keep count these days. Is it the fourth time already? Maybe I should text Mycroft and tell him that he’s too much of a distraction…”
John grinned at the implication. “Speaking of which, when was the last time you ate something?”
Time to change tactics then… “Don’t have to. But you might get a little reward if you do.” John leant closer towards Sherlock and covered the side of his neck with hot, wet kisses.
- PTSD (John)
“Don’t fucking move!” Thomas screamed and pointed the gun directly at Sherlock now.
He considered the chances of Sherlock not noticing that his PTSD got the better of him once again and almost laughed at the absurdity. His boyfriend probably knew already that something was off. The way he had deduced him after their last session… No, John decided to come clean with Sherlock, to talk about every bloody detail if need be. Getting the words out once and for all wouldn’t be easy, but still easier than having his own thoughts thrown back at him in one of Sherlock’s brilliant deductions.
convinced. He decided to test Sherlock’s obedience one last time. He switched off the telly and focused solely on the trembling, sweating man at his feet. “You’re doing so well, sweetheart. Didn’t even beg for mercy when I edged you with the highest settings.”
John was pleased with himself when they ate in companionable silence. By the time Sherlock swallowed down the last mouthful of toast, there was a bit of strawberry jam in the left corner of his mouth. Adorable, how a tiny detail could compromise the rest of his immaculate appearance…
Sherlock always got sulky when a case turned out to be less interesting
(See the end of the chapter for
“John?” Sherlock asked eventually.
“Instead, you’re bringing yourself over the edge, stroking your cock hard and fast until you come all over my face. You tell me that I’m not allowed to wash it off until everyone in the squad knows that I’m your little slut.”

problem head-on. “This morning, when you were naked and obviously
The first contact of John’s warm, slick palm with his aching hard cock was marvellous. “Nnngh, sir, just like that. Ah, aaaah, AAAH YES!” Sherlock moaned throatily when John closed his fist around his pulsing cock and delivered a couple of slow, firm strokes with just the right amount of pressure. Sherlock was back on the edge in no time when John began to work his cock faster. “
John was panting for breath and he moaned obscenely when Sherlock delivered another hard suck. He sat up on his elbows and put his left hand on the back of Sherlock’s head, neither pushing him down, nor pulling on his hair again. He simply watched, mesmerised, when half of his length disappeared between red, swollen lips. “Oh God, sweetheart, you–
… but it wasn’t the only thing Sherlock needed. He remembered the first part of their negotiations, the things John had said about trust and submission. In John’s opinion, submission could never be forced but sometimes that was exactly what Sherlock needed to give up control, to feel owned and valued as a sub. It was also one of the reasons he’d become angry when John had implied that he had pushed his limits. Yes, he didn’t like heavy pain, but otherwise he could take much, much more. John on the other hand…
John knew that he had him right where he wanted him to be. “How about I remove the plug now and give you a nice little handjob instead?”
John’s eyes were glistening with tears, but he didn’t allow himself to cry.
Sherlock sighed when he stepped into the warm spray of the shower. It was an unfamiliar feeling to have someone else’s hands wash his body clean and massage his favourite, sandalwood-scented shampoo into his hair, but Sherlock liked it. He closed his eyes when John rinsed the foamy gel off again.
“At the risk of being redundant – your tone of voice already implies my answer – yes, I’ve
John stretched and slowly got out of bed, careful not to wake his boyfriend. During-case-naps were few and far between and much more important than Sherlock would ever admit. He snatched his mobile from the bedside table and checked for any new messages from Lestrade – fortunately, there were none.
John had become overly concerned about his well-being and – Sherlock suddenly opened his eyes, there was something, a tiny little
“You okay over there?” John asked amused.
He quickly rearranged his position and lay down flat on his stomach between John’s legs, his upper body propped up on his elbows. He curled his left hand around the outer side of John’s right upper thigh and wrapped his right hand around the base of John’s cock, gently tilting it towards his mouth. Sherlock repeated his technique, taking all of John’s cock down his throat and swallowing around it, then applying light suction and pulling off until the head almost slid from his lips. Sherlock swirled his tongue around the glans before he swallowed half of John’s length down again. He moved his hand up and down the lower half of John’s cock, stimulating it with firm, slightly twisting strokes, while his mouth worked on the upper half.
John thanked her yet again when a plate of ginger nuts and a steaming cup of English breakfast tea were set down in front of him. He added a dash of milk and watched as the cooler liquid swirled around in the cup, whirling up bits of tea grounds.
bedroom. “Just try to get at least four hours of sleep tonight, okay?” He pressed his lips affectionately against the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, but before he could continue his way to their bedroom, Sherlock stood up, grabbed John’s wrist to keep him from leaving and gave him a much more passionate kiss. The sudden intensity caught John off guard, made him stumble backwards until his back was pressed flat against the fridge and left them both gasping for breath. When Sherlock broke the kiss, John pushed the other man away, gingerly, hesitantly. Not that he wasn’t interested in more (if the throbbing sensation in his pants was anything to go by), but he knew that Sherlock wasn’t up for more, not during a case.
John smiled, blue eyes crinkling a bit at the corners. It didn't matter how many times Sherlock got to see his face make that expression, it would always cause his pulse to quicken. "Yeah," the doctor said softly, shrugging. "I don't know what. Just... something nice. I thought it'd be nice." His voice was warm, intimate.
"I meant ex," Sherlock snapped.
"You know I have absolutely none of that," Sherlock said, his voice tired but his eyes twinkling.
At some point between the time when John and Sherlock had discussed the part invitation and the morning John intended to return it, the envelope had been moved from the sofa. John spent a few minutes longer than he should have looking for it, and didn’t get a chance to shave before leaving for work. Eventually he’d found it on the table in the sitting room underneath his laptop. Once he’d located it, he picked up a pen and hurriedly filled out the reply slip.
“It’s got to be relevant, hasn’t it?”
“If this is Moriarty, then somehow he’ll know that you’ve figured it out, and he’ll probably wait for you to make a move before he does anything else.”
John settled back down in his chair, and Sherlock returned to his seat at the table. They didn’t speak for several minutes, until John asked about the information Sherlock had gathered, aside from the photo.
The lunch hour was over far too quickly for John’s liking, and it seemed that his afternoon was going to be just as busy as his morning had been. He glanced at the stack of patient files still sitting on his desk and winced as he felt the beginnings of a headache gnawing at his skull.
John ignored the second observation.
Sherlock hauled himself out of his chair and made his way into the bathroom. He closed the bathroom door behind him, but didn’t bother to lock it. Then he turned on the water, shucked off his clothes, and stepped under the spray. Sherlock tried to quiet his mind and focus only on the sound of the water. However, it was much more easily said than done. He found it extremely difficult to believe that Moriarty was the one behind the murders, but that was where the evidence had led him. It made sense to him now.
“Oh. The medical examiner--” he began.
“Police. I need to ask you a few things.”
Then, he stuffed it into his jacket pocket and hurried out the door.
“So sorry,” he said. “Let me get another chair.”
“Cause of death?”
“No, but-”
Sherlock put on his coat and pocketed John’s notepad before heading outside to hail a taxi.
“Ah, thanks. Yeah, I was in a meeting for a lot of the day, unfortunately,” she said, sliding the envelope into her pocket. “I’ll see you then, if not before.”
John smiled slightly at her.
“None of this is your fault,” Sherlock said, when they stepped back from each other.
“What? Who?”
“Looks like his ex-wife, Lila is next of kin,” said Lestrade, avoiding the second question. “I’ll go make the notification.”
Five minutes later, John was back downstairs, dressed and stuffing his mobile into his trouser pocket. They headed outside, and Sherlock knotted his scarf around his neck before hailing a cab. Once they were seated in the backseat of the car and Sherlock had given the driver the address, John looked over at his flatmate-slash-boyfriend-thing and wondered what was going on, although he knew better than to ask.
“Sorry?” the cabbie asked.
When the elevator doors opened on the fourth floor, John stepped out and noticed that the door the Kate’s office was closed. He approached the door and knocked, but there was no answer. It was strangely quiet in the corridor, but John paid no attention. He glanced at his watch, and decided to go to lunch, and try again afterwards.
“He could have been working--” John began. “But then his truck would have been here, wouldn’t it?”
“No, that’s alright. I’ll just go to see her. Thanks.”
John was nearly on his way out of the clinic for the day when he finally caught up with Kate. He’d nearly forgotten about the reply slip and was putting on his jacket to head home when the envelope fluttered out of his pocket and landed on the floor in front of him. He didn’t feel very much like trekking back upstairs, but the reply slip needed to get back to Kate. The little voice in the back of his mind chimed in with the reality that he couldn’t honestly be sure of the next time he would be in. He shook his head. He knew it wasn’t his fault, but that fact didn’t stop him from feeling guilty. He sighed and bent over to pick up the envelope.
Marjorie was on the phone when John approached her, so he slid the envelope into his trouser pocket and waited. He looked around the waiting room and noticed people focused on their mobiles, or reading magazines; one woman was even knitting. Suddenly, he began to feel uneasy. Any one of the people in front of him could potentially be the killer’s next victim.
Anyway, that's the end of this story, and I hope you've enjoyed it. c:
The moment John entered the clinic, he understood why Kate had been so insistent that he come into work. The waiting room was nearly full. He walked over to the reception desk.
, John thought to himself. The odds of surviving a point-blank gunshot wound to the head, while not quite astronomical, were by no means in favour of the recipient.
Sherlock thought. “I was told Mr. Isaac had no family,” he said, passing the photo to Zoё.
“Lestrade, I’ve--” Sherlock stopped mid-sentence. “What? How? All right. Send me the address.”
“She should be in her office right about now,” said Marjorie. “Would you like me to phone her?”
, he realised, after spending a few seconds ransacking different areas of his mind palace.
By the time Sherlock got out of the shower ten minutes later, he did feel noticeably calmer. He had just put his clothes back on when he noticed something red out of the corner of his eye. He turned to face the mirror, and found that the words “GOT YOU”  had been scrawled on the mirror, along with a rudimentary drawing of a clock. Sherlock rushed out of the bathroom to ask John about the writing, only to find the sitting room vacant.

“You’re right,” he said. “And it’s a shame she couldn’t give us anything more to help us.”
Once he’d finished looking through one set of bookshelves, Sherlock moved the pile of books from his chair to the end table. He opened the first one and simultaneously pulled the stack of sticky notes towards him.
“Ms. Kingston,” he said amiably.
John tilted his head slightly to nuzzle Sherlock’s hand, which had slid down the side of his head to his cheek.
“I’m glad. And it’s still working well for you, then?”
More tags will be added as necessary as the story progresses. Certain tags will only apply to certain chapters, and I'll be sure to make note of those at the beginning of those chapters, just in case.
“You… posed as her husband?” he asked, frowning slightly as an inexplicable jolt of annoyance passed through him.
“I can’t say I’m surprised,” Sherlock replied, glancing at John. “The body, however, has told us quite a bit.”
Without another word, Sherlock made his way down to the end of the alley to the street and hailed a taxi. The address Anthony had given him wouldn’t be too long of a car ride, thankfully. As much as he needed the information the man could possibly provide, he was also eager to get back to analyzing the information from the last victim’s file before the new one came in.
The flat was soon filled with the sounds of pages turning and Sherlock’s scribbling, combined with the sound of John’s typing.
“Are you okay?” John asked, walking around the other side of the table to the fridge.
_______________________________
“I don’t know.”
She nodded.
know. He was still at a bit of a loss. It seemed highly unlikely that the apple possessed any real importance. But at the same time, he couldn’t seem to dismiss it completely from his mind. There were several factors connected to the lawyer’s death that hadn’t come up in the previous cases. The apple was one of them, and the other was the strange delivery man whom the secretary had mentioned. John had shared his and Vivian’s conversation with Sherlock. Immediately, the delivery man had piqued Sherlock’s interest. It would make sense for the lawyer’s office to keep a log of deliveries, so Sherlock thought it might contain some useful information.
“Not today. And he was due to come in--” he glanced at his watch. “--a few hours ago as a matter of fact.”
“It’s the names, John.”
Forensic   Latent          In            From       Never         Never
“What?” John got up from where he had been seated at the table to stand next to Sherlock.
John wondered vaguely what Sherlock was working on before making his way into the living room. He looked over at the telly to find that it was tuned to an American soap opera. John watched for a moment as the main character, whose name John couldn’t be bothered to remember- Doctor Handsome, or something to that effect- was standing in an elevator with a woman. As soon as the elevator doors closed, he quickly pressed her up against a wall as they began to kiss passionately. John rolled his eyes and changed the channel.
“We have to phone Lestrade.”
“Did you phone him when he didn’t come in on time?”
“What’s wrong, John?” he asked quietly.
The man eyed Sherlock for a few seconds, and Sherlock could tell that he had been the one staring out through the curtains.
As Sherlock raised his hand to hail a taxi, a thought occurred to him. He turned around and walked back up into the flat, and all the way up to John’s bedroom. He crossed the room to John’s bedside table and began rummaging through the drawers. After a few second he located John’s handgun. He slid the magazine out of the gun, and replaced it after making sure it was loaded. If he could get out of this without using it, he would, but he would much rather have it and not need it, than need it and not have it. He debated for a moment how best to carry the gun before simply deciding to tuck it down the back of his trousers. He rushed back downstairs and outside.
“No. And would you care to share what’s in your jacket pocket?”
“You’re welcome. Have a good day,” he replied.
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed once.
“No. He occasionally had a little trouble coming in to work on time,” said Anthony, reluctantly. “I hate to speak ill of the dead.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispered when they broke apart, his voice barely louder than the sound of the raindrops against the windowpanes.
“I did, too. But according to the assistant I spoke to today, none of them knew much about his personal life.”
“That was Anthony. We need to find out whether Paul was working today, or on his way to work, or whatever, and Anthony’s got some time to meet with us,” Sherlock replied.
“Yes, John,” Sherlock whispered. “‘What if’ indeed.”
“What was that about?” John asked.
Sherlock grabbed the gun from John’s coat pocket and fired before he could stop himself.
"You like being admired by a crowd," John corrected.
John was expecting an answer, but Sherlock was absolutely unable to respond.
, Sherlock--"
"Does it matter?"
"It's hydrocodone.  And, to be fair, the holidays make plenty of people wax sentimental," John pointed out.  "Makes me think of my time as a boy as well.  Waiting for Santa, opening presents, family... happier times.  Things were simple then."  Before Harry came out, before Mum and Dad began arguing, before the alcohol, before depression and fear and war... but before Sherlock.
. What did their kisses feel like? Sherlock had seen them, but hadn't felt them. Although he was a daring man, he hadn't been able to work up the nerve to dupe John into kissing him for a case (it would've felt cheap, anyway). Once, when John was still living at Baker Street, several years ago now, John had come in from a pub crawl and had passed out drunk on the sofa. Sherlock hadn't gone with him (he wasn't much of a drinker and besides, there were
him, to examine him closely as though he were smeared across a glass slide, to lay on top of him and fuse to him the way a skin graft fuses on an injured limb, to slide in and around him the way the elemental bathwater had filled in and around his body.   To have John...
John waits for the complete thought, but Sherlock refuses to continue.  He seems to have run out of steam.  He leans against the side of the tub, resting his head in his hands, running pale fingers through unruly dark hair.  John wants to wrap him up tight in his arms; Sherlock is nothing if not an intense person, and seeing him in a mood can be truly disturbing.
He tried really hard to think. Really hard. Everything was so hard now. Thinking used to be so easy and now John was getting married to someone Sherlock somehow didn't hate and it bothered him so much that he agreed to take John out for a stag night and now he was, by his calculations, slightly tipsy on a bed with John.
<i>Surrender</i>. He smiled reflexively; he couldn't help it.
"I'd love that," John said.  John absolutely adored giving head.  "I love sucking on you, making you squirm."  He began to undo Sherlock's flies.  "Although I do also like fucking you when you're hard, watching your bollocks bounce around as I--"
Sherlock explodes again, frothing.  "
He could teach John here in the flat.
"I just... who are you asking for?"
Sherlock's face was screwed up with fright.  John gripped his shoulders tightly.
; he knew he could love John much better than this, but it certainly wasn't the first time he hadn't approved of his own actions.
"I don't... I don't date all that much."
"The East Wind takes us all in the end."
"John, I..." Sherlock could taste John's breath, he was soaking him up like blotting paper, he could smell his love, he could taste it in his soul and it was so damned, hatefully terrifying and new.
Sherlock moaned softly and reached down to pull a bit at his own cock.  John felt Sherlock's arsehole contract around his tongue as he neared orgasm.  John put two lips to the flesh and sucked, causing the hole to contract more.
"Yeah, you go and get yourself waxed like the little tart you are," he groaned evilly.  "Gone and gotten it all taken off just to make it easier for me to fuck you."  He knew bloody well he might regret saying all of this out loud, but at the moment his blood was echoing in his ears and his legs were wobbling as he pushed his aching erection inside of his lover and he
They sit there in silence, gazing at each other as the last of the bubbles in the bath crackle and disappear.  This man, John thinks.  This man before him is something else.  Scoffing at emotion and sentiment when he builds such frightening emotional sandcastles around himself.  Only John could watch them fall and not be spooked.  Only John could reassure him and quiet his unspoken fears.
It occurred to him that he was drooling but it didn't really matter, after all. Just transport.
"Oh relax, we've plenty of time," came Sherlock's cheeky reply. "After all, the orchestra can't play without their undercover conductor." And with a flourish, he whisked himself into the sitting room, dressed in a tux complete with brandished conductor's baton.
He snuffed out his cigarette before removing his violin from its case and began to play a song he hadn't played in a very long while. His brows didn't unfurrow.
"Sherlock," John put his hands on his hips and spoke very slowly.  "You agreed at the hospital that you would behave if you came home."
Sometimes John can't believe that Sherlock claims to be unsullied by human emotion.
Sherlock had been waltzing for nearly an hour when Mrs Hudson walked in with tea. He had been imagining with so much force that he had actually not heard her coming up the stairs. She caught him mid two-step in the imaginary arms of a blond army doctor.
John watches with mild alarm as Sherlock becomes more and more agitated.  He has to quell him somehow.  He's in no condition to deal with the situation if Sherlock goes out and does something stupid.  And in any event, if he is going to shower, it probably would be helpful to have a second person in to help him with his ankle, he supposes.
John chuckled a bit.  "What, the waxing?  Somewhat," he admitted.  "Although I like your pubic hair just fine.  It was fun as a special treat, but if you grow it out again I won't complain.  I bet it will itch as it grows out.  I'm not sure on that, though.  As I said before, I've never done it myself."
"Oh what?!" Sherlock said peevishly, a lovely blush rising on his noble cheekbones.  "Haven't you ever... you know..." He waived his hand, it must be admitted, a bit gaily.
"No, what?"
John watched the dark figure schlumping his way up the staircase with a wary eye, following close behind with outstretched hands should his partner stumble or lose his balance.  The consulting detective should
Sherlock's eyes searched the air in front of him before he clicked through the menus on his iPod to another waltz.
"I... I never thought about it before," John lied.  "I guess.  I mean."  His eyes kept shifting, making Sherlock uncomfortable.  He leaned over the arm of his chair.  "Have you?  Are you... Are you planning on..."
"Quiet.  Talk when we get inside."
“Of course, ‘we’, I wouldn’t let you handle a case on your own.” He stated mirroring Sherlock’s amused smile.
“Well that would be something wouldn’t it?” John frowned back, crossing his arms tightly over his chest.
John’s jaw clicked again and he threw his hands up in surrender, “Fine, but I want nothing to do with her. This is all yours. And yours alone.” He hissed and stalked his way upstairs.
“No one important. She was just leaving.” John growled out turning to grab the door and began shutting it.
John shook his head, “No, it wouldn’t be right to pass it off to them without anything other than a missing drunk.” He sighed and squeezed Sherlock’s hand, “But we treat this like any other case, not as a family member looking for help. Just as some stranger and her brother.”
Sherlock stayed quiet as long as John spoke. He leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees as he listened intently. Things finally fell into place, he understood the trauma his friend had gone through as a child, and it spoke worlds as to why John held himself in such a stoic manner all the time. He understood why John never spoke of his family and why he rarely spoke of Harriet. Sherlock could tell John saw her alcoholism as his own fault. The devastation in his eyes as he spoke about her drinking, as if he could have stopped it, as if he took the beatings sooner, she wouldn’t have fallen into the vice their father struggled with.
This was going to be a struggle.
“Don’t.” John tensed, his whole body going ridged.
John hated when people would tell him that he was anything like that man. He prided himself in ensuring that he was nothing like his father. He wanted nothing to do with him. He never wanted to be associated to him in any way. Even changed his last name as soon as he was old enough, just to get away from the family and the father he didn’t want anything do with.
John had been concentrating so hard on trying to reach the second mug, he hadn’t heard the other man enter the kitchen. He wasn’t aware of his presence until there was a soft hand on his lower back. Sherlock had gracefully fitted himself in next to John’s side, with his left hand on his lower back and his right hand reaching up to grab the mug John had been struggling to get. John sighed and settled his feet onto the floor. He was grateful to have a roommate that could reach the back of the cupboards he couldn’t, but sometimes Sherlock didn’t understand the idea of personal space. Like this very moment, there was no space between their sides and Sherlock’s hand had slid carefully around John’s waist.
John nodded softly and sat back, his face hardening in thought. “It’s why Harry drinks so much. For a long time, she took the brunt of it. I was too young, too small, too weak.” John bit off his words like they burned his tongue. “I was barely four when mum left, Harry was eight. I suppose she was tired of dealing with him, my father.” John’s gaze had settled on a space over Sherlock’s shoulder, he’d never opened up about his family to anyone, not even his therapist and he knew that if he even looked the other man in the eye he would break. “By the time I was ten I took all of the beatings… I refused to let Harry take anymore. She was already so damaged I couldn’t stand watching it.” He drew in a long breath, “When Harry turned eighteen, she left, and I went with her. I was already a prospect for the military and I only had a couple years left in school. I did everything I could to finish early and worked as much as I could before I got sent away for training. Harriet had already been drinking heavily before then, and I honestly couldn’t blame her when she continued. And I couldn’t rightly leave her on her own without something to get her by.”
Sherlock hesitated where he was standing for a few seconds before he turned and walked to the living room. He sat in his chair and frowned staring at his bedroom door for a few seconds before turning his attention to his possible new client.
Sherlock nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, “We?” He said slightly amused.
“Oh John, please wait!” His aunt hollered. “Please, I need your help.”
“Yes, I. I will be in touch.” Sherlock sighed walking over to Mavis to hand her the photo back.
“Yes, I know. I just got them yesterday.” John chuckled as he finished making their tea.
At that John pushed his way past Sherlock and made his way to the bedroom in the back. He didn’t care if it wasn’t his room he just needed to get away. Away from Sherlock’s worried gaze, and away from the memories that rose up in him from the mere sight of his aunt. He slammed the door shut and slid down to the floor. He sat and listened to Sherlock’s footsteps draw near, just to stop a couple feet from the door. He held his breath waiting for them to get closer and for the other man to shove his way into the room but that didn’t happen.
Sherlock’s gaze snapped up to the other man and he frowned, he hadn’t even heard the door to his room open let alone John’s footsteps as he grew closer, “Is that so?” He pursed his lips just slightly.
“I have, but they haven’t been of any help in finding him.” She stated standing and handing him a small photograph she pulled from her purse, “That’s him, John’s father. Johnathan Hamish Campbell, Senior.”
“And why would you be worried about something like that?”
“I understand hugging is the proper way of comforting a loved one. It releases a hormone called oxytocin that helps relax a person and helps lower stress, and the blood pressure as well as creating a posi-“
“Can’t I just come in and talk?”
John’s next move was quick, the sting of his hand connecting to Sherlock’s wrist was all Sherlock needed to take a step back. “God damn it Sherlock, I said don’t!”
“It’s my mother’s maiden name.” John stated as he stood from his seat. “Not that it matters, I still have no idea where she ran off to.” He crossed his arms over his chest insecurely before turning towards the kitchen, “Tea?” He asked.
“Oh, every day.” The woman said with a sigh, “He lives with me. He hasn’t been home in a few days and I’m getting worried.”
“Is that significant?”
Sherlock feared he’d made a mistake, miscalculated the signals he’d been getting from John between the bouts of iciness since his return. John rose from the chair, his hands curled into fists. Sherlock was sure his fears were confirmed as he waited for John to strike him. However, John simply grabbed the front of Sherlock’s shirt, and slowly leaned closer to him until their lips touched. Sherlock’s lips were soft against John’s, just the way he’d imagined.
“It can’t be,” Sherlock murmured. He leaned back in his chair and stared at the line of sticky notes on the table. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears.
When the car pulled up outside Agatha’s building, he immediately noticed something was missing. The impatiens were gone. Sherlock approached the building and examined the now-empty window boxes, carefully stepping around the small heaps of dirt that littered the pavement beneath them. The soil inside each box itself was riddled with jagged divots where it seemed the plants had been torn out by the roots.
