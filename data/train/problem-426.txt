Sherlock raised an eyebrow.  He recognized the name as belonging to the unconscious witness who'd been found in a stall the night Straker had been killed.  "Oh?  Why are you surprised to see him?"
Sherlock purposely sunk his eight-ball without calling his shot, essentially forfeiting the game.  "Oh God yes!"
"Your pupils are pretty dilated, Billy," John observed aloud, his head tilting to one side, when Sherlock didn't say anything.  "How's your head?" John asked, reaching up and tilting Sherlock's chin down.  He leaned a little closer so he could peer into Sherlock's eyes, his own eyes narrowing in concerned concentration as he studied Sherlock's face.  It was the same diagnostic look Sherlock had observed watching John care for his animal patients; it combined concern and compassion with a clinical analysis and sharp intelligence that was incredibly arousing.
Sherlock heard the scrape and thump of a wooden drawer opening and closing, followed by the rattle of metal hangers on a metal curtain rod.  John reappeared, a fresh pair of jeans and shirt clutched tightly under one arm.  He gave Sherlock a hesitant smile and vanished into the bath.  A moment later, Sherlock heard the sound of water falling.
Mercifully, the room's only decorations were two small woven tapestries, both depicting highly-stylized human figures picked out in red, black and gray against a tan background
Devil's Blaze spent several minutes rearing and snorting before approaching the fence.  His neck snaked out, putting his head on the same level as his withers and his ears were pinned flat.  Even somebody with absolutely no knowledge of horses could correctly interpret the threat.  The man with the rake paused, before slowly pulling the tool backwards where the horse couldn't step on it.  He stood up and turned his head to address his co-worker.  The moment of inattention almost cost him.
Sterndale shrugged.  "Candii Ross was one of my clients for over ten years.  I took care of his dam, Pele, during her pregnancy and I was there when he was foaled."
"We bought Scotty from a breeder…though we also take donated animals, provided they meet certain criteria."
all the time from drying sweat, mosquito bites, and the bites of the horrible, native Trombiculidae mites known colloquially as 'chiggers'.  The sopping button-down was tossed over a low-hanging branch to dry, leaving him in his white vest which had likewise gone transparent.  At least the evaporation of moisture from the surface of his skin was having a marginally-cooling effect, Sherlock noted as he wiped away the drops of sweat beading his forehead with the back of one of his wrists before they could trickle down into his eyes and make them sting.
before the age of nine.  Narrowing his eyes in thought, Sherlock opened a browser to look at a the relative geographic distances between the two cities and quickly fired off a reciprocal text.
Sherlock watched Baz's departing back.  He knew his lips had twisted into a character-breaking snarl, but he couldn't help it.  Baz Moran's entire demeanor offended him.  He recognized that his own ire was nothing compared to the seething man beside him, though.  The set lines and narrowed eyes of John's face reminded Sherlock of nothing so much as the omnionus, poised stillness just before a horse charged.  "What was that all about?" Sherlock asked abruptly, hoping to avert the pending explosion.
"Ah.  Okay.  "John pursed his lips, clearly considering Sherlock's response.  "So...is...this about another client?  Or is it somehow related to Devil's Blaze?"
Sherlock folded his denim jacket over his left arm and did a final mental check of the items he'd packed.  Satisfied that he had everything he needed for the evening, Sherlock shut his cabin door and locked it before setting off in search of John.
The question seemingly more self-recriminating and rhetorical than directed at Sherlock, so Sherlock ignored it in favor of far more pressing matters.  "It's not important—"
“Gentlemen,” Depeau interrupted, visibly reading the tension between the two men.  “Save your dick-measuring contest for later.  I’ve got a half dozen sick steers I’ve got to worry about right now.”
John's eyes crinkled with pleasure.  "Thanks, and yeah, I did.  My grandparents on my mom's side used to own a ranch up north.  We spent quite a few summers there when I was growing up.  Grandpa was a rancher and I'd help him and the rest of the crew round up cattle for vaccinations, deworming, branding and all.  Sometimes it could take a few days so we'd end up doing a bit of rough camping out there under the stars."  John smiled, no doubt with fondness at the memories invoked.  "There's something special, almost freeing about being alone out there on the back of a horse," he continued with a rueful shrug.  "It gives you time to think, to really decide what's important to you.  What about you?" John asked, picking up his sandwich in preparation for another bite.  "You mentioned earlier you started riding when you were very young?"
Sherlock blinked, attention caught in spite of himself.  While high-strung horses weren't uncommon among his clientele, a bite or kick, followed by an attempt to flee was the normal pattern for aggressive behavior.  Unless cornered, a frightened horse's survival instincts when threatened were weighted in favor of flight before fight.  A mare might attack a perceived predator in defense of a helpless foal, and stallions would fight each other for dominance in a herd, but actual cases of horses suddenly attacking and killing humans, much less dismembering them were practically nonexistent.
"Yeah.  You could say that," Alice replied, her lip curling contemptuously.  "Bucking bronco and bull riders aren't the only ones targeted.  They like to go after barrel racers too—they claim the bits we use are too harsh and they claim that the only reason our horses are running is because they're scared.  Which is bullshit, if you'll pardon my French.  Simple fact is good racers like my June Bug just love to run.  We have more problems
"You could say that," Sherlock agreed, his mind busy trying to calculate the probability of first or second-degree burns on bare bums from sitting in the sun-drenched, metal bleachers...
"Possible, but pretty damn unlikely," John announced with a wry shrug as he turned his attention back to the riders below.  "Like I said, a lot of us recognize each other in passing.  Strangers tend to stand out.  Like you, with your gorgeous cheekbones and runway model looks."
"That's a shame…," John husked, bending his head so he could nuzzle Sherlock's neck.  "It's kind of a rite of passage around here."
"Actually," John interrupted, "let us do that.  We've been working with him a bit longer.  Billy here observed that he seems frightened, rather than angry.  The fewer people handling him, the better he might respond."
John's hands were callused as well, but if he were anywhere near the level of sexual master that was implied by the remarks Molly Hooper, Candii Ross and others had made, there was no way he'd risk causing a partner discomfort with chafing.
"Really," Sherlock drawled skeptically, tilting his chin up to give John better access to his left ear.
Sterndale shook his head.  "Ah.  I see.  To answer your question, yes Buck-N-Grind was one of mine.  He made it among the top one hundred bulls and made quite a few professional bull-riders reassess their career choices in his heyday."
The receptionist took it, briefly checking the name against what John Watson had transcribed, not even batting an eye at the UK license.  Clearly adherence to patient privacy was deeply ingrained.  "Is the name on the form the you prefer to use?"
John licked his lips, sniffed and scrunched his nose, his expressive features mirroring his internal thought processes.  "That's nice of her, though I don't know if it's warranted considering I didn't do much.  Doctor Sawyer was the one who treated most of the Devil's injuries.  I mostly ran tests and looked for underlying causes…for all the good that did."
"She's an alcoholic," Donovan said bluntly.  "Been arrested multiple times for drunk driving and possession of drugs.  Can't hold down a job.  Her younger brother is the one that keeps bailing her out of trouble.  There's a whole file on her.  Court costs can't be cheap…neither can rehab."
"Huh." Candii looked grudgingly impressed.  "So what's that mean for my horse?" she asked, batting away a buzzing fly trying to investigate her face.
Interestingly enough, John's body language contradicted his attire.  Instead of flirting or seduction, Sherlock could read tension, perhaps even guilt in the lines of John's shoulders and back.  The way John kept licking his lips indicated nervousness, not arousal.  The question was what was John feeling guilty about?  Was he wrong in his deduction that John hadn't adulterated his beer after all?  It was extremely aggravating that he couldn't recall anything but the vaguest of memories about what had happened at the bar on Sunday night.
Another burst of drunken laughter erupted and Sherlock just barely managed to hide his wince.  He hadn't planned on joining the Triple C's staff at their post-rodeo mixer.  He'd offered to stay behind with the Tredannick brothers and Molly, who had all sensibly declined the invitation in favor of staying and watching the horses while the rest of staff went drinking and dancing.  Unbeknownst to him, however, Molly had taken the liberty of informing Alice and Edith that 'Billy' had never been to a rodeo before.  Sherlock had to give her credit; if it had been a form of revenge, it was both deliberate and subtle.  Alice and Edith had immediately ganged up on him, insisting that "a couple of beers and a night of fun is just what a hardworking, timid little jackrabbit like yourself needs!" and "all work and no play makes Billy a dull ride!"  Before he'd managed to stammer out an excuse, he'd been manhandled—well, womanhandled—into the bed of the pickup truck to sit beside Cole Jonson and several other forgettable ranch hands for the trip to the bar.  Admittedly, he could have easily broken free from Edith's and Alice's surprisingly strong grip, but doing so would have broken his character.  It also would have raised some uncomfortable questions about why a shy horse trainer from Montana knew baritsu, judo or boxing.
Sherlock stared down at his phone, fresh dread slithering down his spine, before slowly typing out what he
The stranger walked closer and extended his hand towards John.  "Don't tell me you're actually thinking about trying to ride with the big boys again?" he added, his lips twisting in a condescending smirk.
Even though none of Candii Ross’s Kiger broncos were appearing at this rodeo, it was feasible that somebody had been watching the horses and recognized ‘Billy’ or John as being employees at the Triple C.  Continuing along that line of thought, it was conceivable that said individual had remained concealed in an attempt to overhear something useful and fled upon realizing they’d been spotted.  Espionage was useless if you got yourself caught.
"A condom, Billy," John repeated patiently, the smile in his voice making it clear he found Sherlock's confusion endearing, rather than off-putting.  "We're not going any further without one...and I don't want to have to stop once I get started."
"Of course," Sherlock replied, waving a dismissive hand.  "Your facial features and fair colouring—specifically your blue eyes and the shape of your nose—express the phenotype that is genetically common for that region of Europe.  I noticed that one of the bandanas you carried in your truck was the Watson tartan pattern and that doesn't include the rather obvious clue in your surname."
Sherlock sneered and went to pick up his discarded safety vest, helmet and training stick, intending to put them away in the tack barn.  To his surprise, John followed him, his hands tucked into his pockets.  Their boots crunching softly against the dried grass and dirt as they walked, setting into an easy synchronism.  It was surprisingly pleasant.  Sherlock cast about for some sort of conversational topic as they walked, something to get the vet talking again.  Fortunately, John beat him to it.
“Did all of the cattle have red eyes?” Sherlock asked, trying not to wince at the sound of John’s two-fingered pecking at the keyboard.  Had nobody taught the man to touch type as a child?
"The sign clearly states that all personal telephone conversations are to take place outside of the lab," Anderson snapped, pointing at the computer-paper sign taped to one wall.
Sherlock suppressed a wince.  Donovan's dismissive summarization was eerily reminiscent of his own, before he'd taken the time to do his research.  It wasn't wrong, but neither did it encompass the entire picture.
"Much," John agreed with a good-natured laugh, flopping down to lie beside Sherlock.  The small size of the twin mattress meant that they had to press together, chest to chest to both fit, but from Sherlock's standpoint, that was hardly a problem.
"The night Johan Straker was killed," Sherlock admitted reluctantly.  "Doctor Watson apparently examined Captain Lestrade's horse, but he couldn't find anything wrong at the time."  He hadn't forgotten Molly Hooper's mention of John being at the fairgrounds either.  More potentially incriminating than John's examination of Scotty was the fact that
"So...ah...I was wondering, do you...have to be back at the ranch at a set time?  Like to help with evening chores or anything?" John asked abruptly, pulling Sherlock out of his mental wanderings.
John looked troubled.  "So is...that what you meant when you mentioned having met Sterndale's type before?"
"Come on," John grunted, sitting up and stretching.  "It's late.  We should probably be heading back."
John's smile grew.  He leaned forward and rested his chin on his left hand.  "You know, I'd love to hear you play sometime."
"No," Sherlock informed him curtly, then deciding a bit more honesty was called for.  "I prefer not to take opioids, especially morphine…I have a bad reaction to them," Sherlock explained, cloaking his history of prescription drug abuse in suitably vague terms.  Best not to mention the cocaine.
"Dull!" Sherlock huffed, not bothering to open his eyes.  "All horses are valuable to their owners at the circles you operate in.  Most don't sell for less than several hundred thousand pounds and some sell for considerably more."  He shifted slightly, his toes flexing and curling under the cover of the blanket.  "As for the claim of 'sudden, unprovoked aggression,'" Sherlock continued, his tone snide, "you and I are both aware that most cases of 'sudden, unprovoked aggression' are caused by one of two things: either somebody is guilty of animal abuse, or somebody is guilty of being unconscionably stupid by rewarding an animal for behavioral transgressions.  Tragic as it may be that a horse may be euthanized because some idiot died after being kicked or thrown by an eighty-five stone animal, it hardly justifies your presence in my flat.  If it's so important to your client, I suggest you contact The Woman and kindly piss off."
The rider grinned. “A bit, yeah,” he chuckled. “I’m guessing you don’t work with cattle much if you can’t see with your feet?”
Sherlock pursed his lips, trying to slot the terms John had used against his mental library of local colloquialisms and native botanical flora.  'Seeing daylight' was a rodeo slang term referring to a rider coming far enough off the horse that daylight was visible between the rider's posterior and horse's back, but the term 'Indian figs' was unknown.
He'd initially been suspicious of how the man's name appeared repeatedly in Doctor Sawyer's records.  A quick review of the employment histories and CV's that Mycroft's terrifyingly efficient assistant had assembled solved that mystery, at least.  Though John Watson's primary occupation was traveling and working as a rodeo vet around the country, he was also listed as a locum practitioner at Doctor Sawyer's clinic in the "off-season" winter months, and had been so for several years.  It undoubtedly helped explain why Candii Ross has entrusted her horse to Doctor Sawyer's care after firing Doctor Sterndale.
if Grandpa Hardwicke mixed up our orders; she swore up and down that the blue tasted better.  It didn't much matter to me; all I could taste was sweetness."
“UP NEXT, FOR OUR SIXTH CONTESTANT, WE’VE GOT ONE OF THE FEW LADIES BALLSY ENOUGH TO BE A BULLDOGGER—KAYLA FOX FROM PICKETT, OREGON!  THIS HEAVYWEIGHT JUDO CHAMPION DECIDED TO SWITCH TO THROWING CATTLE AFTER DECIDING SHE’D THROWN ENOUGH PEOPLE.  I TELL Y’ALL, I’M GETTING TIRED JUST WATCHING THESE ATHLETES DO THEIR THING…CAN I CONVINCE ANY OF Y’ALL TO BRING ME A RED BULL?  NOT THE ONE FROM ‘THE LAST UNICORN, MIND,’ JUST THE DRINK…YEAH…I CAN TELL WHO WAS BORN IN THE EIGHTIES…YOUNGSTERS,” the announcer continued with a laugh as various whistles and sporadic bursts of applause greeted his reference.  “THERE’S THE NOD…AAAAAAAADDDDD BOOM!!!!  OH BOY, I THINK ‘THE FOX’ JUST CLAIMED THE SECOND PLACE SPOT…FOUR POINT TWO!!!!!  BETTER WATCH IT, KESHAWN, SHE’S COMING FOR YOU!”
Sherlock made a note of the different titles.  While he hadn't read Ross' 'Medicinal Plants of the World,' it looked promising, as did 'Toxic Plants: Meat & Livestock in Australia'.  The last shelf was full of volumes about fungi: the varieties, the history, identification manuals and growing guides.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow; it looked rather incongruous next to the rest of the shelves filled with reference information about veterinary medicine.  He glanced down, checking for dust.  Unfortunately, because of the glass doors, the shelves were all spotless.  There was no way to tell which volumes were looked at frequently and which were purely ornamental, like the outdated encyclopedias Candii Ross used to decorate her home.
"He'd talk from time to time about saving up to buy a ranch in Africa.  Not sure where he was going to get the couple million it'd probably cost though.  I told him once he should just invest in the lottery, it'd be about as successful."
"Hell yeah I have.  Yellow Face is one of the better bulls Sterndale's produced over the last few years.  I've drawn him once before; maybe I'll get lucky again tonight and you can see me in action—in all the ways that matter," Baz purred.  "Speaking of, I need to start getting ready," he announced with a put-upon sigh as he glanced down at his watch.  "But here's my number so you give me a call when you finally get bored with Shorty."  Baz pressed a small matchbook into Sherlock's unresisting hand.  With one last wink and a final leer, he sauntered off.
..., was easy enough to translate, but the rest of the text was frustratingly obscured by the multiple photographs of Sterndale lying on top of the diploma.  Sterndale was wearing full doctoral regalia and posing with other, similarly-clad individuals.  One of Sherlock's eyebrows rose until it was almost brushing his hairline:
"Nope," Sherlock answered, popping the 'p'.  "Just don't be dull," he added, still concentrating on his mobile, thumbing open a new screen and performing a different search.
I prefer being barefoot when relaxing at home.  Why should I bother wearing socks to keep my feet warm when it is so much more enjoyable and efficient to make use of your excess body heat?” Sherlock pointed out reasonably, opening his other eye to meet John’s bemused gaze.  He wiggled his toes for emphasis and would have managed to slide his feet under John’s jumper to rest against John’s delightfully warm belly, had John not forestalled him by clamping both arms protectively against his stomach.
.  If she was angry at him, she'd be less likely to start blubbing again, if only to salvage her pride.
"Honorably discharged, actually." John replied absently.  He paused to let a cattle trailer pass by in front of him.  "I served two tours, one in Afghanistan, and one in Liberia, before deciding I wanted to do something different.  Dogs are good and all, but I prefer working with large animals."  John blinked, brow furrowed, his brain catching up with his mouth.  He turned his head enough that he could glance at Sherlock from the corner of his eye, his expression somewhere between puzzled and wary.  "How did you know I was in the military?"
Sherlock curled a lip.  As reluctant as he was to call on Jim and own him another favour, desperate times called for desperate measures.  “You might be surprised,” he said aloud.  “I’m feeling…lucky.”
"My grandfather's," John said from behind him, "and his before that."  Sherlock startled, almost dropping the violin.  He hadn't even heard John leave the bathroom, so caught up had he been in studying the instrument.  John's hands darted out instinctively to catch the violin.  The touch of his skin was almost scorching-hot where his hands brushed against Sherlock's to cradle the instrument.
Not that it was having any visible effect.  The horse was too busy panicking, despite the rider's efforts.
"I recognized you from one of your photographs."  At Sherlock's look of skepticism, Donovan pursed her lips.  "I'm a detective," she explained neutrally, "and before that, I earned a dual undergraduate degree in Library Science and Criminology.  If there's one thing I know how to do, it's research."
"Goddamit!" John snapped in frustration, pulling back to glare at the digital clock on the microwave.  He grimaced at the numbers displayed.  "Sorry, Billy," John said apologetically as he stepped back with visible reluctance and went to fetch his phone from the bathroom where he'd apparently left it.  "Just—if somebody's calling me twice in a row at this hour, it has to be an emergency.  Probably something to do with Harry."  The call ended before John could answer, only to immediately start ringing again.  "Watson here," John answered, his tone clipped.
The challenge of standing on three legs made it more difficult—but not impossible—for horses to kick.  Moving quickly, Sherlock threaded the rope between Scotty's rear legs and looped the wide nylon cuff of scotch hobble around Scotty's left rear pastern.  The large surface area would prevent abrasions, while also ensuring that it couldn't easily slip free.  After checking to see that none of the ropes were twisted, Sherlock tightened the hobble until it was snug and the tip of Scotty's left rear hoof was just touching the ground.  He brought the remaining end of the rope back up to Scotty's head and tied it off with a quick-release clove hitch.  If Scotty started kicking, Sherlock could easily tighten the line and force Scotty's leg up two inches—not enough to hurt him but certainly enough to make the horse redirect his focus on keeping his balance, rather than fighting the people that were trying to help him.  If Scotty started to fall, anybody could jerk on the knot and it would release immediately, allowing the horse use of all four feet and minimizing the risk of falling and accidentally breaking a leg.
Sherlock tilted his head as first one, and then a second, and finally a third horse threw their heads up and flehmed, their muzzles pointed upwind.  Sherlock moved closer and sniffed.  He couldn't detect any unusual odors—just the standard reek of heated oil, manure, lorry exhaust, sweat and dust that accompanied fairground events.  Horses had keener senses of smell than humans did (though not nearly as keen as a dog's), so it was possible that they were smelling something from farther off.
Sherlock opened his mouth, intending to continue arguing, but quickly closed it when he saw the way John’s lips had thinned even further.  John had also begun clenching and flexing his left hand, which was never a good sign.  The last time Sherlock had seen that particular expression, John had been catching his breath after being kicked by one of Ms. Ross’s especially spirited colts that was refusing to cooperate with the vet’s attempt to take a blood sample.
His suspicion was confirmed on the fifth page. 'Smokin Son returns for another season, thanks to innovative new technique pioneered by Leon Sterndale to remove bone chips'.  Sherlock discarded the first magazine and selected another.  Inside was an article discussing Sterndale's interest in bull bloodlines and his success in breeding bulls that turned out to be especially aggressive buckers.
"No," Sherlock repeated, folding his arms.  He was done cooperating with this frowning, brusque John who called him names and ignored his protests.  Where was the compassionate veterinarian that had gently wrapped his sprained wrist?
"Oh, so now I'm finally allowed to look?" Sherlock heard John grumble from the front of the tent.  "Don't know what you need me for; it's not like you've been asking my opinion this whole time…"
"I said that Weeks and Harrington took care of the waterin', but you should go ahead and put a few more sections of fescue out in the nets to keep the herd preoccupied until showtime.  Alice and I are going to run and grab some gear from the trucks, but we should be back in fifteen, maybe thirty at the latest.  Keep an eye out for the bronc organizers—they should be comin' round any time now with the number assignments."
Set south of the main house, the horse ranch consisted of a series of sturdily-built pole barns, corrals and stables.  The centerpiece of the horse ranch was a large, wooden exhibition ring.  Hardy, native trees, desert landscaping and benches offered shade and comfortable seating to anybody interested in watching a horse or rider inside the exhibition ring.  The acreage around the exhibit ring was divided into multiple turn-out paddocks.  Well-maintained pastures lay past the paddocks, eventually giving way to wild fields.
“Laugh all you want,” John told him darkly.  “I’d rather perform another emergency tracheostomy on a horse and incise its Streptococcus-infected guttural pouch than deal with one of those furry little bastards...But that's enough doom and gloom," John added, clumsily changing the topic as he turned off onto an exit ramp.  "We're about ten minutes out, so you should probably start preparing yourself."
"John?" Sherlock said softly, gently shaking John's shoulder.  "Sit up for a sec?  I brought back some water in case you're thirsty."
had seen to that), but sharing food was an age-old custom designed to promote trust.  "What do you recommend?"
Sherlock blinked, caught a bit off guard by the casual intimacy of the gesture.  Not that he minded; John's hand felt...oddly right in his.  John hadn't intertwined their fingers, probably an ingrained habit from ranch life, since linked fingers could easily get broken.  That was something he'd learned early on from one of his former senseis.  John's palm was warm and dry and Sherlock could feel the flex of the muscles in John's hand and the rasp of John's calluses against his own.  It was easy to remember how John's hands had felt running over his bare skin and he lost himself in his mind palace, content to let John lead them wherever they were going while he tuned out the garish sights and sounds in favor of imagining John underneath him, or riding astride him, bare chest glistening with sweat, muscles flexing as he rocked his hips back and forth, back and forth, impaled on Sherlock's length and squeezing him tight, or perhaps just rubbing their cocks together in delicious friction…
Sherlock rolled his eyes in disgust.  Investigations would move so much quicker if the authorities took his word as gospel, rather than demanding tedious explanations.  He quickly composed a reply to Donovan and hit 'send'.
"Oh," Sherlock wiped at his cheek with the back of his right hand, deliberately missing the smear.  "Did I get it?"
Sherlock looked around.  There was nobody nearby, except for Bonnie and she was hardly likely to—what was colloquialism he'd heard Molly use the other day?  Oh yes, "spill the beans."  Sherlock smirked privately to himself.  He was looking forward to using the phrase at Mycroft's next soiree.  Watching Mycroft's not-grimace at his younger brother's deliberately uncultured mannerisms would almost be worth the tedium of having to wear a tuxedo and feign inebriation while he eavesdropped for potentially useful gossip.
"Do you feed your horse sweet feed often?" Sherlock asked, turning to look over his shoulder at where Mrs. Porter was patiently waiting.
"Hello?" Sherlock asked hesitantly as he answered, automatically shifting his voice upward into Billy's soft northern lilt.
John set his fork down and scrubbed at his face with both hands.  "I just...Jesus this is awkward.  Okay," John said blowing out a breath before looking up and meeting Sherlock's eyes.  "For starters, how much do you remember from the other night?"
While Keshawn was his clasped hands above his head in victory, the pickup men were busy collecting Keshawn’s horse and the steer.  Sherlock studied the mare’s conformation as she cantered by, almost as if she were performing her own victory lap.  Though champion racehorses could come in many different heights, ranging from 15 hands to 17.2 hands, they also carried slight riders.  It was fascinating to see such a small horse with such a quick start, despite carrying a tall rider weighing over fifteen stone.
John didn't go into further detail, but he didn't need to.  Sherlock had already seen the incident John had described, though he’d been less concerned with the bull rider and more interested in watching the horse and John’s actions at the time.  It had been as a result of a particularly sharp exchange he'd had with Donovan over the suspects.  Donovan had argued that the PRESS video showed that John Watson was fully capable of ruthlessly executing a horse.  He'd argued that it was entirely plausible that Kitty Riley was manipulating the footage to support her cause and had gone searching afterward, looking for the original, unedited version in an effort to prove his point.  It had taken some extensive digging on the sorts of websites and forums that were favored by the macabre, but he'd eventual found what he sought.
"To be honest, I was shocked to see him on a saddle, since the last time I'd heard he'd ended up with an ass full of stickers somewhere overseas," Baz continued, giving John a hearty slap on the back that made Sherlock internally wince in sympathy.  "You remember that, Johnny?"
"What do you mean it isn't Alzheimer's?" John demanded, his face creasing in confusion.  "It must be.  It's the only explanation that makes sense. Sterndale woke up early, arrived, saw Devil's Blaze, misdiagnosed him, decided he didn't want to risk getting hurt and tried to cover his ass after he realized his mistake.  It's the only explanation that makes sense."
enveloped him in tight heat.  John merely hummed in response—there was no mistaking the satisfaction in the tone—and the vibrations in addition to the play of John's tongue over his glans were enough to make stars detonate across Sherlock's field of vision.  He could feel the excess lubricant from the condom running down his balls, combining with his sweat, making everything slick and cool...until they were wrapped in John's warm hand.
"Thanks," John said, accepting his keys back and the muzzle and hobbles Sherlock had fetched.  He gave Sherlock a quick smile of gratitude, but his eyes didn't leave his patient as he threaded a rope through the metal D-rings attached to each end of of the scotch hobble.  After several more long, tense moments, Scotty's head finally began to droop.
"Aaaanddd here we are," John announced with a flourish, stopping before a cafe with a bright purple awning.  He opened the door and ushered Sherlock through, his left hand just brushing Sherlock's lower back.  The brief touch of his hand sent a flash of warmth through Sherlock's entire body, making him shiver in reaction.
lost track of his surroundings severely enough to start arguing with his brother's mental projection aloud.  What
Kimble stall barn #1 was empty save for another female ranch hand.  The other woman stopped mucking stalls long enough to send Molly a quick, cheerful wave, her round, Mexican features set in an ebullient grin, thick braids swinging in tandem with her movements as she sang softly to herself in Spanish.  Molly waved back but didn't stop to chat.  Instead, she let herself out the double doors and quickly crossed to the entrance of Kimble stall barn #2.  Inside it was warm and quiet.  Some of the overhead lights were lit, hinting that somebody had come through the building recently.  At the sound of her footsteps a few of the more curious horses stuck their noses over the gates of their stalls.  They whickered greetings at her presence, seeking attention and treats.
"Sorry, what?  No, no, that's not what I meant, just...no," John stammered, a beautiful tide of colour creeping over his throat and cheeks as he shook his head emphatically.  He squeezed his eyes shut and then opened them again, visibly swallowing.  "I just meant...you looked like you wanted me to toss you the deodorant.  That's all."
"To answer the second question first, moose are fucking dangerous if you surprise one—especially a momma with a calf," John explained.  "An Alaskan army buddy of mine once described moose as being only slightly less dangerous than a bunch of bored Rednecks and/or Aussies on an isolated military base.  After having been deployed a few times with both, I have to agree with him.  Hell, the Aussies were the ones that decided a few years ago that bull riding wasn't hard enough, so they had a bucking bison competition."
It also helped explain why John had devoted himself to bronco and bull riding, Sherlock thought as he sipped at his mug of sludge, his eyes wrinkling at the corners in concentration.  The relatively modest entry fees of fifteen or thirty pounds sterling could result in several hundred dollars in American currency.  The larger events had higher entry fees, but the prizes were also larger.  A rider who made it to the final rounds could easily earn several hundred thousand dollars in winnings.  According to some of the other sites he’d reviewed, even a rider who was ranked at 35th place in the world standing reported almost $50,000 in income.  Which helped explain the sport’s appeal to individuals no-doubt suffering from acute testosterone poisoning.  Recalling Donovan’s mention of John’s credit history, he'd taken the time to cross-check some of the larger, irregular deposits listed on John's downloaded bank statements against searches for John's name in conjunction with various bronco and bull-riding competitions.  There had been several transactions where the amounts of the suspiciously-large deposits matched payments on some of the loans, effectively countering Donovan's argument that John was accepting cash bribes.
John took off his hat and waved it above his head.  "Yo!  Hunter!  You got a mo?" he called out, doffing his hat and using both hands as a makeshift megaphone to be heard over the noise of fans, livestock, and engines.
—spicy vegetable relishes—and sauces when I was stationed overseas," John explained with a cocky grin.  "And occasionally we'd get into pepper-eating contests with the locals when things were slow."
"Why were they interested in Straker's gambling habits?" Sherlock asked, already half-suspecting what the response would be.
Light came from the room's two windows and a Spanish-style wrought iron chandelier.  An antique, Tiffany-style stained glass floor lamp and a matching desk lamp were also present.  The walls were panelled in a dark golden pine and surmounted with a ceiling painted a light turquoise, rather than the expected cream or boring white.  Paintings of improbably-coloured horses and deer decorated the walls.
you use as your ante?" Sherlock asked, accepting the invitation to inquire about the emphasis John had purposely placed on one word.
They hadn't taken more than two steps through the doorway when Anderson flung up a hand.  "Stop!" he ordered.  "You aren't allowed to cross the red line without first putting on protective clothing," Anderson informed them bluntly, indicating the red duct-taped border that marked out a three-foot-by-four-foot rectangle on the white linoleum.  "This is a forensic laboratory and I don't want my samples or possible evidence contaminated.  Are we clear on that?"
"Damnit Holmes—" Donovan growled, pinching the bridge of her nose between her left thumb and forefinger, indicating a brewing headache.  She took a deep breath, held it, and then let it out between her lips in a controlled stream of air that hissed softly.  "We need her information.  You were the one that pointed out the similarities between the two attacks.  If they
John's expression was amused.  "For two reasons," he explained, ticking them off his fingers.  "The first is that it's damn entertaining to watch.  The second is because like most rodeo events, it has its roots in real ranch work."
"Oh?"  Sterndale raised an eyebrow.  "What brings you to Texas, then?  We're a bit far from Kentucky."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.  He'd believe it.  He'd encountered more than a few Australians during the course of his career.  From what he'd observed, they were the living embodiment of 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger' with the addendum of 'and if I am going to die, then it's going to die too!'  How else was there to explain the continued existence of a population that lived on a continent inhabited by snake-eating centipedes, cheerfully swam in bodies of water that were home to some of the world's most dangerous venomous and/or poisonous creatures, and voluntarily ate Marmite?  "And to answer my first question?" he asked aloud instead since firsthand knowledge of Australia wasn't exactly the sort of experience 'Billy' would possess.
The silent parking lot resembled something out of a zombie movie, one of the horrible scary ones that her ex-boyfriend had enjoyed, Molly decided as she hurried across the open space, the rapid tap of her cowboy boots sounding abnormally loud in the pre-dawn hush.  As she walked, Molly nervously scanned the area for potential threats with the ease of long-born habit, paying close attention to the patches of darkness.  The flickering orange and green glow of the parking lot's few fluorescent lamps painted everything with an eerie half-light.  It was a surreal blend of colours that cast odd shadows where none were, confusing the eyes and disorienting the senses.
"I'm very sorry to learn about Cream Soda's death," Donovan continued, her voice striking an effective balance between 'professional' and 'compassionate.'  "I know it's a terrible thing to lose a friend, and I know this is probably going to be upsetting to discuss, but we need your help."
Frowning, Sherlock used his phone to navigate to the site.  He skimmed over the brief, sensationalized summaries before focusing on the new addition to the web page, a 'submit' button that urged readers to 'Help Stand Up For Abused Horses With PRESS!  Send Us Your Photos And Stories!!!  Informants Will Remain Completely Anonymous!!!!'  "The officer that made the initial call described the witness that approached her was Caucasian, with red hair," Sherlock mentioned.  "It's an admittedly vague description, but it's possible that Kitty Riley was present last night."
"Here you go," she announced, setting the baskets and ramekins out.  "The fries just came out of the fryer—be careful, they're hot.  The salsa in the black ramekin is the lethal one.  I'll be back in a sec with the sriracha ketchup and the buffalo sauce.  Is there anything else I can get you gents?  Perhaps a different beer?" she asked, tilting her head to indicate John's barely touched glass.
"You mentioned your vet tech certifications.  Did you ever assist Doctor Sterndale when he was here?"
Finally, there were Mycroft’s suspicions to consider.  He agreed with his brother’s assessment that the universe was rarely so lazy as to offer coincidences, but for the life of him, Sherlock couldn’t fathom how a twenty year old racehorse’s death on a completely different continent tied in with a saddle bronc, a police horse, and a young barrel racer’s aging mount.  While Sherlock had no doubt about the latter two horses’ value to their owners, it was still a far cry from the hundreds of thousands of pounds a proven racehorse could command at auction.
“John,” Sherlock managed with a croak when the man was within earshot, “I didn’t think you’d still be here.”
Curious, John set his mug aside and walked over to peer over Sherlock’s right shoulder. The detective obligingly tilted the images so that John could get a closer look.
His head bobbed, keeping time with the last song he and John’d danced to, hours ago. His mind’s eye filled with the images of how John had looked while dancing, strong arms flexing as he’d twirled Sherlock around, his hips twisting in time to the beat. Sherlock hummed at the memory, fingers tightening on John’s thighs as the other man tried to buck in response to the vibration.
"God, your fucking mouth," John mumbled, nipping at Sherlock's jaw line, his hot breath gusting over Sherlock's skin.  "I love your mouth.  I want to put my fingers in your mouth.  I want to put
"Don't spend their time playing keyboards, guitars, or rubber chickens, I'll wager," John shot back, looking pleased by Sherlock's ensuing expression of utter crogglement.  "It's a literal band made up of horses and it's pretty damn funny to listen to.  So...what will it be?  Ribbons?  Rubber chickens?  Judgmental lesbian goats?"
"Want some?" John asked, catching Sherlock's eye.  He held up the dark blue aerosol can up so Sherlock could see it and waggled it slightly.
"Can you write my answers down for me?" Sherlock held up his injured hand by way of explanation.  A lie, of course.  He was perfectly capable of writing with his left hand—Mycroft had seen to that—but feigning helplessness and asking John to do it fed into the vet's hero complex and helped foster a sense of intimacy and trust.
"Spoiled rotten, more like," a voice from behind Sherlock said.  "And laaaazy!" the voice's owner continued.  "Don't know why we haven't fired her yet, considering she doesn't do much more than bark an' eat."  The tone was affectionate, despite the less-than-flattering words.
Before the horse could take more than a few running steps, a short, blond cowboy shoved his way through the fleeing crowd at an angle to the horse's shoulder and grabbed the halter rope.  He dug his heels into the ground and jerked the rope downwards, the muscles in his arms and legs standing out sharply against the taut fabric of his jeans and shirt and the leather chaps he wore on his legs.  The sudden resistance was just enough to interrupt the horse's forward motion and spin him slightly sidewise.  Taking advantage of the pause, the cowboy grabbed a handful of mane and smoothly boosted himself on the horse's back with an ease that Sherlock found impressive, considering the horse's height relative to the man's stature.
The oldest two were both from the internationally renowned Pyland del Rey Equestrian College in Andalusia, Spain.  One awarded the holder with a degree in Equine Studies, the other for a degree for Equine Science.  The third degree was a Masters in Business from Harvard University in Massachusetts.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow, silently impressed.  He knew from his own research that admittance to Pyland del Rey was fiercely competitive.  The prestige of successfully graduating from Harvard University was comparable to graduating from the University of Cambridge or Oxford in terms of intelligence and effort required.
"You want something, Billy?" John asked, looking up and meeting Sherlock's from his position by the foot of the bed.  His voice was innocent, as though he hadn't just spent the last ten minutes describing in lurid and explicit detail the things he wanted to do to Sherlock's feet...and hands...and ears...and nipples… When Sherlock failed to respond, John did something sinful with his thumbs to the ball of Sherlock's left foot that sent a bolt of warmth through his foot and up his leg.
"Seven ball, right head pocket," Sherlock called out.  It was a terrible shot, but a quick glance up through his lashes revealed that John had noticed the intentional innuendo.  Deliberately, Sherlock stretched out over the pool table angling his denim-clad arse back to where he knew John was watching with ill-disguised interest.  Narrowing his eyes, Sherlock calculated the radius and mass of the pool balls, the distance, angles and Newtonian Laws he would be using.  Pulling the cue back, Sherlock made several trial shots, miming an unmistakably sexual thrust with the motion of the pool cue.  Behind him, he heard John take a nervous swallow of his beer.
"Nah, just that it's probably not what you're used to.  You'll see what I mean when we get there," John promised with a sassy wink.
John looked up from where he was running one hand over the sheepskin lining the saddle’s gullet to check for burrs.  "Ah.  Yes.  Yes, I have."
"This may be a long shot," John added in an undertone, "but I was wondering, do you think this might possibly be related to what's affecting Devil's Blaze?"
"No," the woman said abruptly from behind him.  Her voice was surprisingly deep.  "I said tomorrow.  If it isn't here, then I'll make sure that your superior is informed.  I can guarantee that after he gets off the phone with me,
Sherlock blinked as a forefinger suddenly tapped him on the brim of his hat.  He blinked again, realizing belatedly that he'd been staring at John, rather than copying the other man's steps.  Judging by John's tone and slightly concerned expression, he'd probably been trying to get Sherlock's attention for a while.  "Sorry.  I...got...distracted...watching you," Sherlock stammered, pushing the brim of his hat back so he could better see.  "What was that last step?"
"Oh, sorry," Molly replied, her tone flustered.  "Um…there are about a dozen of us, not counting the seasonal part-time staff.  Ms. Ross is the boss, obviously, and handles the business end and the most of the hands-on training of the horses.  Our ranch foreman is a woman named Natalie Tsedaa'—Nat for short—Juana Castillo is the ranch housekeeper who also doubles as the cook.  She’s really nice but doesn't speak a lot of English.  You know about Joe already...and I already mentioned Owen and George."  Molly bit her lip in thought, fingers tapping on the steering wheel as she counted off who she'd listed.  "Kate Holdridge, Mark Spencer and Cole Jones are all part-time hands that mostly muck out stalls.  There's a few other guys that are in charge of the cattle, but I don't know them as well."
"Hah hah, very funny, John," Sherlock retorted, wrinkling his nose in feigned insult.  "But to answer your question, no.  I've already got everything I need."
Donovan blinked twice before narrowing her eyes angrily as she evidently grasped was Sherlock was insinuating.  The look she gave Sherlock was filled with contempt.  "Did you seriously just try and slut-shame me by implying that I spent the night sleeping with my boss?  Is that how you think I got my job?"
as he tried to put his jumbled thoughts into words.  "I...never expected to attract the attention of somebody as perfect as you.  I'm not even sure it's real and not faked," he mumbled.
well taken care of horse suddenly attacked the person grooming it.  Miss Tregennis was lucky—the other person was killed.  Mr. Holmes believes that the two cases may be related.
There was a series of thumps followed by a burst of irritated swearing from below.  "Yo, Billy!  A little help here?" John called up, his request distracting Sherlock from his efforts to take a picture of a counter-protester's sign that declared 'Mikey hates everything' to send to his brother.
Sherlock only barely managed not to stagger at the blow.  Suppressing a grimace, Sherlock rolled his shoulders to mitigate the stinging before stepping into the room.
"Dick," John said with a laugh, apparently oblivious to the interested looks the two women were giving him.  He leaned forward, the unbuttoned collar of his shirt revealing a tempting slice of golden-bronze skin.  "Or, since you're talking about bees, should that be 'prick'?"
"Yeah.  Good idea.  Thanks," John said, handing over the requested items before striding off, followed by several onlookers.
Irritating, but not exactly surprising.  With horses—especially abused and frightened horses—rehabilitation became almost a dance.  Two steps forward, one step back.
In appearance, Edith Baxter and Alice Turner could have been sisters.  Both had heart-shaped faces and long brown hair frosted with blond streaks.  Their builds were similar too—leggy and athletic, with well developed leg muscles and broad shoulders.  They'd introduced themselves with the same blunt flirtiness as the blonde he'd encountered at the airport and promptly sat down at the table without an invitation, one on either side of him.  He'd learned that they divided their time between riding, grooming, cleaning tack and helping muck out stalls.  Both wore belt buckles identifying them as experienced barrel racers.  They'd also been quite interested in wheedling out personal details, including his relationship status. Was he married? (No).  Did he have any siblings? (Unfortunately yes).  Did he compete in rodeos? (No).  Did he like dancing?  (Yes). Was he single? (Yes).  Was he looking?  ("No," Sherlock had replied, being careful to let his gaze linger on where Molly was filling her plate, and allowing a shy, hopeful smile to curve his lips).  Instead of being put off, as he'd hoped, the two women had exchanged speculative expressions, clearly communicating silently.  Fortunately, at that point, Nat Tsedaa', the ranch foreman, had rapped on the table, to indicate the start of the morning meeting, sparing him from further innatites.
"—checked for that too, and no, there wasn't," John snapped.  "Besides, all of these owners are careful."
John drove past the entrance and parked his Humvee underneath one of the large trees framing the back edges of the car park and both men climbed out, their bootheels thudding solidly against the well-maintained asphalt.  John took a covert sniff of his armpits then ducked back into the cab to grab a can of body spray.  After giving the can a quick shake, John untucked his shirt and pulled it up to apply a liberal coat of spray to his torso.
Donovan blinked.  And blinked again, visibly translating Sherlock's explanation into common vernacular.  "Are you...seriously telling me that somebody's making these horses huff drugs?" she asked skeptically.  "And these drugs are making them act like a junkie that's OD'd PCP or Meth?"
"EquestriaGurlz," Sherlock repeated the name with distaste as he continued typing in search keywords, his thumbs flying over the keypad.  He could hear the deliberate misspelling and the trite inclusion of the letters 'Z' and 'U' in Brenda's pronunciation.  Mr. Talbot would probably roll over in his grave at the utter bastardization of the English language, if it were possible for corpses to reanimate.  "Based on the name and no-doubt bromidic spelling, it is some sort of online community devoted to equines.  Tell me," Sherlock demanded waspishly, his patience worn thin with the plodding speed of the interview, "do you and your peers discuss anything of importance or do you focus exclusively on puerile forms of entertainment, such as memes and personality quizzes revolving around the animated misadventures of pastel-coloured anthropomorphic equines with appalling names—"
Sherlock bent his right knee so he could rest his right elbow on it and began worrying at a thumbnail as he pondered the situation from a different angle.  Broncos weren’t his forte—race horses, competitive jumpers and the occasional interesting client were.  He’d worked with countless nervous animals with dangerous bucking issues, but never a horse that had been specifically bred for what was otherwise an undesirable (and extremely dangerous) behavior.
Sherlock swallowed.  He had no doubt which hand position John would choose.  No wonder the riders preparing to compete had been so meticulous about taping up their joints.  His phone beeped, signaling a new text message.
Swallowing hard, Sherlock slid out of the bed and hurried over to the laptop case he'd observed hanging from the clothes' rack earlier.  It took endless moments for the old laptop to boot up.  Every beep and chirp made Sherlock tense in anticipation.  Finally, the login screen appeared.  To Sherlock's surprise, it was password-protected.  Typing quickly, he began entering different passwords based on personal information John had dropped: FusilierVets, 3CWatson, RideEmCowboy.  None worked.  Sherlock grimaced.  It appeared he was going to have to resort to the blunt force technique.  Fortunately, there was a handy, unsecured guest account for him to use.
Sherlock blinked and shrugged to cover the sudden heat in his cheeks.  "It's elementary.  Lock the barn," he ordered, turning to address Mrs. Porter.  "Explain to Teddy that giving a horse too many sweets isn't healthy for him.  Make sure that Colonel eats only his regular rations and see how he behaves in a week."
"Your transport and license plate frame, mostly," Sherlock explained. "Though the single dog tag on your key-ring and the BDU jacket stuffed underneath the seat in the back also gave you away."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the curtain, there was a significant pause, followed by a skeptical, "You walk around naked in front of your housekeeper?"
"Not yet," John replied, the trace of another smothered yawn evident in his voice.  "Sorry.  I was catnapping.  Doctor Früh sent in a bunch of samples to a twenty-four hour emergency lab.  We hope know more in the afternoon, once she gets the panels back."
Beside him, John shifted again, making the cheap bed bounce and the cloth covering him rustle.  Sherlock's lips curved into an unconscious smile.  He rolled over to fit his body around John’s sleeping form.  The mattress might industrial standard, made up with sheets possessing a truly inferior thread count and a polyester counterpane, but the presence of John’s nude body snoring softly beside him put his own, Egyptian-cotton, silk duvet-draped Cotswold mattress back home in 221b to shame.
Lestrade grimaced.  "Yeah.  That was a match that happened the night before Straker got killed.  Sam Bayard was the clear favorite—he's up for Nationals, and he lost.  Got thrown and almost trampled by Penang.  Bayard's still alive thanks to the rodeo clowns, but it was a close thing.  If what's his name, Fizzy Simpson hadn't been so fast on his feet, Bayard probably would probably be dead.  I've never seen a bull act quite that vicious, and I've been around rodeos for a long time.  Anyhow, quite a few people lost money on that match; we had to clean up a few fights.  Straker meanwhile made a pretty mint, several grand, I think…John Watson mentioned he was bragging about it."
"Thanks, Fizzy."  John shoved the first toolbox into the man's arms and grabbed another two for himself.  "What in the hell happened?"
A flicker of movement in the dim area under the regular bleachers drew Sherlock's attention.  He narrowed his eyes.  "I see you," Sherlock barked.  "What do you want?"
“You’re welcome.” John took another few steps forward until he could rest his crossed arms against the top rail of the fence, beer bottle dangling loosely in his grip. “Long day?”
At least the shirt was distinctive enough that if Sherlock saw it again, he would recognize it; surely there weren't two individuals tacky enough to own such a garment.  Whatever idiot had decided to combine cherry red, aubergine, indigo, lemon and chartreuse-colored fabrics into the same garment deserved to be taken outside, beaten, introduced to the concept of the colour wheel and then beaten again.  He hadn't seen such an appaling color combination since the last time he bought Mycroft a matching tie and pocket square set for his birthday from a novelty store that specialized in clown apparel.
By contrast, the claims on Kativist and EquineEqualkitty's blogs were so sensationalized as to make Coleridge's ramblings about gardens and caves appear as accurate as a travel documentary on the BBC.  One particularly idiotic article titled with the clickbait headline 'Black Beauty Burgers Served to Students!' claimed that the American president had wild horses rounded up to be sold and slaughtered for commercial consumption.  The author claimed that "innocent horses could be saved if people quit eating them" and urged readers to contact their political representatives about ending the Bureau of Land Management roundups "so the poor horses run free and wild as nature intended".
"She's the wife of a peer, Sherlock," Mycroft snapped at Sherlock's less-than-polite response. "Show a little respect!"
John started laughing and shaking his head.  "I can imagine that!  You were probably a holy terror as a child, weren't you?" John asked, refocusing his attention on Sherlock, a grin stretching across his face.
"Why?" Sherlock asked, nonplussed, thinking of the training facilities and arenas back home.  "Surely there are shower facilities here?"
"Perhaps," Mycroft agreed, "but a fast-acting, intramuscular injection of xylazine and Dormosedan is relatively benign as far as adverse reactions go and infinitely preferable to a bullet, which was the first inclination of the police when they realized they were dealing with a killer stallion."
Sherlock blinked.  Of all the reasons he'd formulated for Donovan's password security, that interesting bit of history hadn't been one of them.  He was an Consulting Equine Expert, not a detective, but it was still a foolish oversight.  Donovan's Cockney accent, the picture of her parents taken in front of Big Ben and her mother's military service should both have been clues.  He pursed his lips as he watched Donovan's fingers tap out a series of keystrokes which he vaguely recognized as something mathematically related.
"Here you are," Molly chirped, pushing the door to the cabin open and gesturing for Sherlock to precede her.  The blast of surprisingly cool air was a welcome change to the baking heat outside.  Reaching out Molly toggled on an overhead light.  "I hope it's big enough for you."
"That doesn't change the fact that Doctor Watson is still considered a person of interest," Donovan interrupted, folding her arms.  "He has the skills, the knowledge and he's been involved in two cases now of horses going crazy—"
Sherlock purposely directed a significant look to the table full of inebriated idiots that were still chugging beer and shots like they were water.  "We're in the South.  Surely the visual of two men dancing together is sufficient provocation for a drunken, homophobic idiot to start a fight."
"Um...well...okay," Molly said slowly as if she weren't quite sure Sherlock's statement was genuine.
At Sherlock’s puzzled expression, John shrugged. “It’s required by state law here, and there’s an exhibition coming up next month. Best to get them in thirty days prior, or thereabouts, but ranchers being ranchers tend to put things off if something more urgent comes up.”
" Sherlock interrupted, well aware of the unfaked confusion rife in his tone.  "What on earth is a bulldogger?"
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut for a long moment against the beams of light stabbing through the blinds.  With a grunt, he opened them again and sat up, scrubbing his free hand through his tangled curls.  "Yes…sorry…," he muttered, slipping back into his Montana accent as his brain finished coming back online.  He took a moment to stretch, relaxing the tight muscles caused by sleeping on a substandard bed.  "Ugh…traveling is exhausting and I was feeling a bit poorly yesterday evening.  A plate would be splendid, Molly," Sherlock continued, more graciously.  "Thank you."
It was on the tip of Sherlock's tongue to retort that he'd simply spend the day in a sheet, (if not outright nude), the way he would back home, but uttering such a statement wouldn't be commensurate to his current persona.
“God, Sherlock,” John gasped, his head tossing restlessly on the pillow.  He lifted his head enough so that he could gaze at Sherlock with blue eyes gone dark with desire.  He swallowed, smooth pink tongue coming out to moisten his bottom lip.  “You are amazing!”
“Maybe?” Depeau said slowly, “but in both eyes?  Simultaneously?  In a small portion of the herd?  Trauma seems statistically unlikely.”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip as he stared down at them.  A quick glance to the side revealed John still preoccupied with the fit of his saddle.  Involuntary arousal began to pool its warmth into his groin as he watched John’s legs move under the leather of his chaps.  The saddle’s pommel blocked his view of John’s groin, but the memory of the way the chaps circled John’s pelvis and drew less-than-subtle attention to John’s impressive penis had been permanently framed on multiple walls of his Mind Palace.  British Lieutenant General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell’s famous words came to mind as he palmed one of each.  Being prepared didn’t necessarily mean anything was
He leaned forward to nuzzle John again.  The notes rosin and leather were still present, but subdued by the increased potency of arousal and the precome dampening John’s pants.  It was fantastic.  It was tempting to mouth John’s cock through the fabric, but Sherlock restrained himself and merely rubbed his face against the side of John’s erection, wallowing in the rich, spicy scent, much like a feline would use the scent glands under their chin to claim ownership of something they considered theirs.  It was only after several more glorious inhalations of John-infused oxygen that Sherlock became aware of the gentle, yet insistent, tugs on his curls and John’s panting words.
Sherlock felt his lips part involuntarily, his mouth flooding with saliva.  The throbbing in his cock was echoing the thudding of his pulse.  His palms itched with the urge to grab John and pull him closer, to see if John was as affected as he was.  "You're also still looking a little flushed," John commented.  His voice sent little puffs of warm air across Sherlock's cheeks, making the taller man shiver.  "You feeling alright?"
“WELL HE’S GOING TO END TONIGHT WITH A MIGHTY SORE HAND AAAANNNND AN EIGHTY POINT RIDE!  THAT’S GOTTA BE SOME COMPENSATION, AT LEAST!  NOW LET’S SEE IF OUR LAST RIDER CAN BEAT THAT!!!!! NEXT UP, IN CHUTE NUMBER THREE, WE’VE GOT NAN SAINT CLAIR ON TWISTED LIP…”
“Irrelevant,” Sherlock replied, hissing in irritation as he brought his hook pick into play.  The slick metal was being annoyingly recalcitrant.
"Oh, did you compete?"  Molly asked, with a nod at the buckle on his belt, curious in spite of herself.
He made a point of whistling shrilly as he approached.  Horses had excellent vision, so it was likely that the stallion had already spotted him, but the aural greeting helped signal his lack of predatory intent and his desire to be social.
He walked Devil's Blaze out, watered him, and then walked over to where Candii Ross was leaning against a nearby tree, watching him.
He sent the text off with an evil smirk before turning his attention to his inbox.  A quick perusal through his email showed no new messages worthy of his time.  Why did companies insist on sending him adverts for penile enhancement drugs?  Sherlock frowned, making a mental note to have Jim from IT send them a reciprocal message...perhaps RACHE, the virus that wiped the recipient's address book, or maybe the one inviting the sender to play a great game… Dismissing the thought for later, Sherlock opened up a new page in his browser and began searching for independent diagnostic laboratories.
Sherlock blinked and forced his concentration back to the matter at hand.  "Of the two, Sterndale's behavior is more suspect," he concluded, seeing Donovan's lingering skepticism.
"It's a date then," John said with a wink as they approached the ticket booth, clearly following Sherlock's thought process.  "Howdy," John said, greeting the curvy young woman behind the glass with an easy smile.  "Two adults please?" John added, holding up two fingers by way of emphasis.
"Holmes," Donovan snapped warningly.  Sherlock rolled his eyes, but subsided with bad-tempered grace.  Donovan gave him a final glare before turning her attention back to Brenda.  "What is EquestriaGurlz about?  Is it a 4-H type club?"
"I did, yeah" John admitted with a laugh, abruptly causing Sherlock's thoughts to derail even further.  "My mom made me a costume out of a pair of old sweatpants and one of Harry's old dance leotards when I was eight," John continued, oblivious to the hope and subsequent disappointment his words caused.  "I wore it with a pair of red galoshes and a pair of red mittens.  It ended up being a great Halloween costume, because South Dakota gets pretty cold by the end of October."  John scooted closer on the blanket, until his left knee was just lightly brushing against Sherlock's right thigh.  "Did you ever dress up in your spy costume?"
this is colic, but it doesn't hurt to eliminate as many causes as possible.  And that's the fastest thing I know that will make a horse cranky.  Shhhhh, boy," John said soothingly as he pressed the stethoscope chestpiece against Scotty's skin.  The horse flinched, but couldn't easily kick because doing so put pressure on his neck from the rope his foot was attached to.
John paused, brow furrowed until he translated Sherlock's statement to mean the display of dreamcatchers and silver and turquoise jewelry he'd spotted on his way to the men's room.  "Sorry," John said to the annoyed looking gas station attendant.  He set the coffees and pastries down on the counter.  "I'll be back in a tic."
"Yes, please," Sherlock replied, studying Anderson in turn, his mind taking in a myriad of details, from the fastidiously clean-shaven face to the careful avoidance of extended eye contact.  Donovan's assessment had been accurate.  Social interactions for individuals with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders could be challenging—he'd seen enough of Mycroft's struggles growing up to recognize some of the signs.  Forensic pathology as a career choice made perfect sense for a detail-oriented person who wanted to be able to focus on a task with minimal interruptions by other people.
Sherlock shifted, craning his neck to look over his shoulder, lips twitching in satisfaction at his brother's expression.  Mycroft was glaring at him from beneath hooded eyes, his stiff posture silently communicating exactly how petty he found the younger Holmes' actions to be.  As Sherlock watched, Mycroft's facial features smoothed themselves back into their habitual bland mask.
"Not according to my landlady—I mean housekeeper," Sherlock quipped absentmindedly as he turned to study his arse in the glass again.  The black leather would almost certainly be hot considering the blazing sun outside, but there was no denying how...nicely it accentuated his form.  There was a reason why leather garments were such a popular choice among so many different groups, after all.
"Yeah, I can see that," John replied, studying Sherlock's face critically.  "It looks like you're starting to burn a bit on your nose and cheeks, despite your hat.  Have you applied sunblock recently?"
John simply inclined his head once with the barest possible courtesy before following Sherlock out the door.
"Wimp," John retorted, with a wink to show he was teasing.  "All you've got is the water and my med kit.  I'm the one carrying the heavy rucksack!"
Sherlock blinked, looked down, and then blinked again.  Sure enough, a noticeable bulge was distending the placket of John's jeans.  It wasn't quite as obvious as the bulge in the trousers of the idiotic rock pseudo-documentary that he'd forced himself to watch after John had teased him about his lack of pop cultural knowledge, but it was all the better because unlike the man who'd shoved an aluminum-wrapped courgette down his trousers in an effort to increase his perceived masculinity, John's was real.  It also helped explain the more-than-a-little irate dog-owner and the speed with which John had hurried them both away.
John licked his lips, sliding across the bench until he was pressed up against Sherlock’s side.  His left hand settled firmly on Sherlock's right thigh while his right hand began to card through Sherlock’s curls.  "Tell me…have you ever gotten off in a pickup truck?"
"I don't want to prejudice the rest your interview by revealing names," Donovan said firmly, "but the fact that you recognized her may prove to be significant."
“Woof!” Eggsy breathed, looking up at the gold letters decorating the storefront’s awning.  “Posh place, innet?  What are we buying here?  Lockpicking toothpicks?  Exploding cufflinks?”
“-dale’s bulls are the worst.  I’m telling you; those damn fuckers get meaner every year!” The speaker, a middle-aged man sporting an impressive handlebar mustache, took a deep gulp to drain the dregs of his mug and reached for the coffee pot.  “What tha?  It’s empty!”
"I'm quite aware of the idiocy of speaking to you as if you are capable of comprehending English," Sherlock said calmly, angling his body at a forty-five degree angle so that it wouldn't look like he was planning on pouncing.  He was careful to keep his body language relaxed and his hands held out slightly to the sides so the stallion could see they were currently empty: no whips, ropes or clubs.  "Nonetheless," Sherlock continued, his voice soothing, "I feel compelled to point out that—despite what you are no doubt anticipating based on your prior experiences—I'm not here to hurt you.  You're all right..."
Sherlock removed his irritating hat and dropped it to the ground.  There was no reason to wear it outside.  With sigh of relief, Sherlock leaned against the wall.  He could feel the trapped heat of the day radiating from the rough bricks at his back, their warmth seeping through the thin cotton of his shirt.  John's warm hands were wrapped around his arms and doing a marvelous job of holding him upright.  The thump of drums and the over-amplified twang of the music's steel-string guitars was still audible through the brick, keeping time with the thudding of his pulse, but the noise was far-enough removed that it no longer felt like it was pounding through his skull like a farrier's hammer against an anvil.  Sherlock blew out a breath and then inhaled deeply, taking in the myriad of odours detectable in the warm, still air.  He could detect hot tar and dust and traces of cigarette smoke from fags the staff no doubt smoked on their breaks.  There was also the faint reek of garbage coming from the skips at the end.  Overlaying it all though was the scent of the man standing in front of him: clean sweat, cologne, leather and something spicy and unmistakably masculine.  The combination made Sherlock's mouth water.
"So what do you think is causing it?" Sherlock asked, his mind flashing back to John’s compilation of research.
"Obviously, John," Sherlock retorted with an eye roll.  "Even a moron would have noticed the way you unconsciously clenched both fists when you spoke her name."
"No.  It's clear that Devil's Blaze has been dosed with some sort of compound," Sherlock snapped.  "His records showed abnormally high adrenaline, cortisol and testosterone levels—all hormones associated with stress and aggression, which could explain the behavior, but not the reason for it.  According to the veterinary records, Doctor Watson had to use a larger-than-recommended cocktail of xylazine and Dormosedan to sedate Devil's Blaze at the fairgrounds and continued to utilize sedatives while Devil's Blaze was at the clinic to keep the horse contained.  If Sterndale's not behind it, the next most logical suspect is Kitty Riley, or some other fanatical animal rights activist."
.  Long before the colloquial term 'horse whispering' had become ingrained in popular culture, classical dressage practitioners such as Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de La Guérinière had advocated gentle training techniques over brute force.  Sherlock paused to take another sip of his water.  "From there, branching out and becoming an equine rehabilitation therapist seemed like a natural secondary occupation." An incomplete truth: his interest in equine behavior stemmed primarily from his interest in the criminal aspects of back-room chemistry, horse doping, crime and bringing criminals to justice.
Certainly the digital invoices he'd examined for veterinary expenses detailed that fact.  Vaccinations, surgery to remove a bone spur from a mare's hock, deliveries, acupuncture, ultrasounds...the enormous bill from Doctor Sawyer's clinic detailing Devil's Blaze's diagnostic tests… Annually, it added up to thousands of dollars in expenses, which made Doctor Sterndale's idiotic misdiagnosis all the odder.
"Thank you…" Sherlock said slowly, looking sideways at Molly.  He hadn't expected her to be so observant, nor had he expected the offer, but it could prove to be quite useful if Donovan wasn't able to secure him the access he required to a full forensic lab.  "I'll keep that in mind."
Sterndale's enormous desk was the obvious focal point of the room, but Sherlock found his eye being drawn down to the floor and the large inlaid medallion depicting a bucking bull, sans rider, it contained.  The medallion wasn't painted; some skilled artist had created the shadows, highlights and contours of the animal's body using different types of wood cut and cunningly fitted together.  Sherlock pursed his lips, mentally calculating the price tag.  Two thousand quid, of not more.  If possible, Sterndale's tastes were even more expensive than Ross's.
Sherlock smirked, his expression safely hidden behind the magazine.  He recognized the incipient homophobia playing over Sterndale's features.  Disappointing to encounter, but hardly a surprise in this part of the country, given the current political clime.  His initial plan had actually been to pitch his voice slightly higher and pretend to be a fluttery, vapid idiot while he introduced himself to Sterndale as John's friend, Billy, rather than Candii Ross's trainer, with the specific goal unsettling Sterndale.  Mycroft had taught him long ago that annoyed or uncomfortable individuals were far more likely to let key pieces of information slip.  But Mycroft had also taught him that ingratiation could also be an effective technique and in this case, mimicking Sterndale's contempt for John Watson and appealing to Sterndale's sexism was more likely to give Sherlock the opening he needed.
He poured himself a cup of coffee while he waited for his bread to toast and added two dashes of sugar from the spouted metal and glass container sitting beside the pot.  Americans, apparently, weren't civilized to serve their coffee in a proper sugar bowl.  Wrinkling his nose, Sherlock took a careful sip of the hot liquid to avoid accidentally burning his tongue.  The brew was darker than what he normally drank.  It was almost thick enough to dissolve a spoon, but the caffeine and sugar were sufficient to dispel the headache and lingering cobwebs caused by flying from London to Texas in a twenty-four hour span.  Blinking, Sherlock took another sip, noting with surprise that it had none of the bitterness he had learned to expect from cheap coffee.  Apparently Candii Ross believed in supplying quality meals to her staff, as well as her animals.
"Sexy as hell," John continued cheerfully, undeterred by Sherlock’s eye roll.  "But, since this is a bit too public for any sort of sucking to take place, how 'bout some coffee instead?  Black, two sugars, right?" John asked, extending the travel mug.
"Don't be stupid," Sherlock snapped.  "James Bond isn't a real person, even though his creator, Ian Fleming, did work for British Naval Intelligence.  I was more interested in being a spy like Josephine Baker, who smuggled intelligence information to the French Resistance by writing messages in invisible ink on her sheet music, or Harry Houdini, who would pick locks and sneak into secure areas in pursuit of information."  Sherlock shifted his shoulders slightly on the soft blanket that John had laid out for them to recline on.  "I read all of the history books and biographies we had in our library and begged my mother for more.  I was obsessed."
"Nice to meet you Billy."  John replied, giving Sherlock's hand a final squeeze before letting go.  With a grunt, John straightened up from his crouch and extended his left hand again.  "Think you can stand all right?"
The blond gave his stolen tea mug a wistful look before looking up to meet Sherlock’s angry eyes.  “To answer your question, they’re being held hostage until you get your scientific arse down to the shops and buy me properly sized--and coloured mind you!--replacements for the fifteen ruined pairs you left in the bathtub yesterday.”
Sherlock leaned forward over Donovan's shoulder to see what woman Mr. Tregennis was describing.  Candii Ross's face stared back at him, the R3 clearly visible at the bottom of the picture.  Image R2 was Kitty Riley, as he had suspected.  Molly Hooper and several other Triple C employees were also pictured, as well as a handful of other women he didn't recognize.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes at Donovan and received an unapologetic chin raise in return.
"At the moment, I'm focusing on New Scotland Yard's basic metabolic panel—specifically a CBC of the red and white blood cells, his glucose, calcium, electrolyte and lipoprotein levels.  I've ordered a test for evidence of West Nile Virus since that is another disease that can make horses act in an uncharacteristically aggressive manner.  I am not so much worried about colic as I am about whatever is in his bloodstream, so I have not ordered an ultrasound because his gut sounds normal.  Doctor Watson also suggested that I test for hypothyroidism or a surplus of testosterone or a tumor on the pituitary gland.  It isn't something I normally check for this early in my diagnostic process, but I may order those tests in the future if Doctor Watson's assessment that this is not a case of rabies is correct."
Molly shook her head.  "Never.  Ms. Ross would never have hired him if he were.  She's real careful about screening her staff...she won't let just anybody touch one of her horses, rodeo competitions being the exception."
Donovan took the bags, holding them up to the light.  She opened the first one and pulled out the tube with the scraping of feed and turned it over slowly.  "What's this?" Donovan asked, directing her attention to Sherlock.
, privately betting that the officer wouldn't know the genus names, but would recognize the layman's terms.
"His gut sounds normal," John reported, looping his stethoscope back around his neck.  "So it isn't colic.  Let's check your head."  John reached up and took a hold of Scotty's halter with one hand, using the other hand to peel Scotty's top lip back and examining his gums.  Frowning, John pressed his thumb against the top gum for two seconds before releasing it and watching the tissue change colour.  "Cap refill's normal—that's good—whoa boy," John added as Scotty tried to pull his head back.  "Calm down.  It's okay.  I'm just trying to help you.  We've got a bilateral, intermittent serous and sanguineous nasal discharge," John reported, examining Scotty's nostrils.  "Most likely an EIPH—"
"Here we are," Molly said abruptly, bringing the truck to a halt and startling Sherlock from his mental wanderings.  "Welcome to the Triple C."
"Tell me about the case," Sherlock ordered, continuing to flip through the photographs.  "Don't leave anything out."
Growling, Sherlock removed one boot and reached inside, long fingers smoothing down the inside and cataloging the slight depressions his toes had formed and residual dampness in the leather.  A nearby security guard gave him a suspicious look but Sherlock ignored him as irrelevant.  He peeled off his sock and carefully examining the reddened skin on his toes and heel before reluctantly redonning his footwear.  His skin wasn't yet bleeding or oozing, but the threat was definitely there.  He'd have to make sure he stopped at a chemist to purchase plasters before much longer.
or domestic cattle genus.  Even if an egg is successfully fertilized, any resultant embryos inevitably fail around the eight-cell stage.  A far more surefire technique is to combine the genes of registered championship bucking bulls, which is what I do."
"Be...because the closer we got to the barn, the more Cream Soda started to struggle," Brenda confessed.  "She kept balking and tossing her head.  She wasn't listening to me.  I don't know why.  She's never acted that way before!"
Turning away from the diplomas and photographs, Sherlock surveyed the rest of the room.  A set of mounted animal horns—the Texas Longhorns Anthea had mentioned?—hung above each door.  They easily measured over six feet from tip tip; the highly polished bone gleamed softly in the light cast by the wrought-iron chandelier hanging overhead.
Sherlock pressed his lips together as he fumbled with the buckle, the leaden feeling of disappointment in his chest warring with his stung pride.  He slid his feet off the exam table and stood up, using the edge of the table for support and swallowing hard around the sudden lump in his throat.  Of all the scenarios he’d imagined around John watching as he unbuckled his new chaps and eased them down his legs, none of them had involved being in public with other men looking on while simultaneously being insulted and spoken to like a disobedient child.  His strangely-clumsy fingers refused to grasp the hidden zipper sliders at first and he had to concentrate to pinch the metal tag tightly enough to unzip the teeth.  He was halfway down one leg when the zipper got caught on the fringe.
Molly shrugged, her expression sympathetic as she watched him.  "According to Alice and Edith, you joined everybody for a few rounds of shots and darts then vanished until it was almost closing time.  Cody said you were sick over the side of the pickup truck a couple of times on the way back—which is why Owen said it'd be best to let you sleep it off in a stall, just in case you were sick again.  Owen, George, and a few others have been taking turns checking on you all night during watch.  We wanted to make sure you didn't choke to death on your own vomit or anything...though that would be kind of hard, seeing as we made sure to put you in the recovery position," Molly concluded with an awkward smile.
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock stalked back to the sofa flopped prone again, the much-abused springs creaking in protest at the sudden increase in weight.  "Bad day at the office?" Sherlock sneered, for confirmation more than anything.  "You reek of Baccarat's Les Larmes Sacrees de Thebe—the jasmine and geranium clash with your preferred cologne by the way— and your tie knot is less than pristine.  You only do that when you are truly irritated.  Tell me…was it Grace Hambree or Abu Ben Ishak who contacted you?"
John’s shrug was nonchalant.  "There are doctors pushing to make helmets mandatory across the board, but it hasn't happened yet.  Some of the junior organizations require kids to wear safety gear now, but it’s still optional for adults past a certain age, thank God.  Pass me the tape, would you?  I need to wrap my wrist and arm."
Mycroft gave him a sardonic look.  "Would you have honestly agreed to investigate if I'd asked you up front to travel to Texas without the files?"
Especially if he wanted to keep John's attention focused on him and not on the two predatory hens the next table over.
"What's wrong?"  Sherlock asked in a hesitant tone, blinking his eyes rapidly in a manner he knew made him look absurdly young and innocent.  "Did I do something—"
Sherlock pulled off with a pop before John could accidentally choke him.  "Hold still," Sherlock ordered, wrapping one hand around John's shaft to better secure the condom.  He placed his other hand against John's hip, effectively grounding him as he renewed his oral assault.  Sherlock uttered a throaty growl as he savored the way John filled his mouth.
"Suit yourself," Simpson huffed, taking another swig before recapping the bottle and returning it to its hiding place.  Crossing his arms, Simpson ran an experienced eye over the Triple C's horses.  "Speakin' of, Ross still got that one unrideable, killer stallion of hers?"
Molly had scrunched her nose in thought.  "Not really...no, wait, Doctor Watson said something about Scotty's eyes being a bit inflamed, but I think he might have attributed it to dust or something.  I'm really not sure; you'd have to ask him."  She had given Sherlock an apologetic shrug before picking up her neglected scone to take a bite, leaving a scattering of crumbs on the plate.
With a loud electronic screech, the outdoor PA system crackled to life and a man with a heavy drawl proceeded to cheerfully inform the crowds that the judging for the Braunvieh Cattle Show, Youth Division, would be starting in the Weeks' Arena in thirty minutes.  Over the screeching of the microphone, Sherlock could hear the whinneys of annoyed horses and the lowing of unhappy cattle crammed together in pens.  It was an irritating cacophony of sound made worse by the rumbling of oversized diesel engines.
Sherlock stared down at the screen with a faint expression of horror...before an evil thought crossed his mind, which had him pulling out his own phone and opening a browser.
There were a few more steps before Sherlock felt himself being lowered onto a wonderfully stationary padded surface.  He kept his eyes closed and concentrated on taking slow breaths to help his nausea abate.  The unexpected touch of John’s palm against his throat made him start.  John’s hand skin felt wonderfully warm against his cold skin.
Sherlock could hear the warmth and seductive promise in the other man's voice and it was enough to make him flush.  "Seven it is then," he managed to garble.
"Jesus Christ.  Fuck." John swore again.  "Billy?  Sorry.  I've got to go."  John slammed the door shut and took off running, the rodeo clown easily keeping up, despite the weight of the tool box he was carrying.
Even a complete moron could understand why the women were so enraptured.  John had an easy smile and a habit of casually flirting indiscriminately, whether it was with the harried bartender passing them drinks, or an appreciative wink at the host holding open the bar's door.  John had unbuttoned his chambray shirt earlier and rolled up his shirt sleeves.  A concession to the heat, or a visible signal that he was off duty and inclined to relax?  Regardless, the fine hairs on his forearms gleamed gold in the bar's yellow light, as did the faint patches of stubble adorning John's chin and cheeks, places that he'd missed in his rush to shave.  The white cotton vest that John wore underneath his dark blue shirt did nothing to disguise the well-muscled physique that lurked underneath.  Sherlock took another sip from his freshly refilled glass of water.  As he did, he overheard the woman speculate on which one of them should try and fake needing 'help' remembering the rules of eight-ball.
Sherlock picked up the dark brown bottle, unscrewed the cap and took an analytical sniff, before nodding his head once in approval.  It wasn't quite the scent of John—John smelled of leather and sun, spice and sweat, but the faintly-sweet, slightly woodsy smell was close enough to help bolster the fantasy.  He poured a few drops into the palm of his left hand and dabbed his middle finger and thumb in the small puddle, before rubbing them together to test the oil's viscosity.  The pads of his digits slid smoothly against each other with a pleasing lack of friction.  One test left.  Sherlock wiped his left hand dryish against the bare skin of his left thigh and the held the bottle up to the light to double-check the ingredient list printed on the label for known allergens.  What was safe to apply in small doses didn't necessarily hold true when the same substance was applied to large areas of skin, as the regretful episode involving a particular brand of horse liniment had demonstrated on a painfully memorable occasion.
"John!" Sherlock yelped as he flinched back.  The sudden dampness permeating his jeans was uncomfortable, but he was more alarmed by the redness of the other man's face and the violence of John's coughing.  He shot to his feet, staggering slightly as he moved around to stand beside John.  One hand hovered uselessly over John's back as he frantically tried to recall the aid procedures for a choking individual.  Pat them on the back?  Perform the Heimlich manoeuvre?  Offer them a drink of water (which would be redundant practice, since consumption of a beverage was what had caused the problem in the first place)?  What was he supposed to do?  "John?  What should I do?  John?!"  The commotion drew the attention of several nearby patrons.  Sherlock could feel the weight of their curious gazes, but none of them offered aid.  It was a textbook example of the 'bystander effect' or 'bystander apathy.
Mrs. Hudson pursed her lips and spared a brief thought for her neighbors as she pushed her sleeves up, preparing to do battle.  She'd have to remember to pick up some more caster sugar and make biscuits for the tenants on either side to apologize for the noise.
Victor had seen kissing as a quick, formal  prelude to the far-more-important act of intercourse or fellatio.  John, however, kissed like he was happy to spend all night doing so.
He needed a shower and perhaps a nap to reboot his brain.  It was a given that he'd be utterly filthy again before sunset tomorrow, but at least he could enjoy a few hours smelling like himself, rather than a ranch hand.  Giving Bonnie's ears a final scratch, Sherlock stood up and opened the cabin's front door so the collie could resume her nighttime patrol.  The collie gave him a look that could almost be described as 'reproachful' as she obediently climbed off the couch, but she went outside without fuss.  Sherlock shut the door and locked it, before walking over to the linen closet to fetch a spare towel.  He would never get his ridiculously thick, curly hair dry otherwise.
The one-stall men's loo was small, but gratifyingly clean.  With a grateful sigh, Sherlock locked the room behind him enjoying the way the ambient noise dropped appreciably.  He relieved himself and washed his hands before stripping off his soaked pants and depositing them in bin, where they landed with a sodden 'splat'.  The door rattled.  "Piss off!" Sherlock shouted, ignoring the angry retort as he turned his attention to his jeans.  It was bad enough to have been doused in beer without looking like he suffered from urinary incontinence as well, Sherlock mused as he stared down at his groin.  At least dark denim was more forgiving than bespoke wool trousers in the face of an unexpected alcohol bath, Sherlock decided after studying the drape of the fabric and the slight variations of colour.  He grabbed a handful of paper towels and stuffed them down his fly to absorb the worst of the wet, while he sluiced warm water over his face and neck to rinse away the sticky beer residue still clinging to his skin.
Donovan, meanwhile, wasted no time in setting up the computer and tape recorder for the interview, quickly plugging in the necessary cables and hitting the 'record' button.  "Test.  Test.  No man is above the law and no man is below it."  Donovan recited.  She stopped the machine and rewound the tape before pressing 'play'.  Her recorded voice came through clearly.
"Umm…yes, yes I am," the brunette driver replied, blinking and smiling in visible relief.  She unbuckled her seatbelt and exited her vehicle with a few fumbling movements.  As she rounded the truck's hood, the young woman paused to wipe the palms of both hands on her jeans, before extending her right hand to shake Sherlock's.  "I'm Molly Hooper…from the Triple C?" the woman identified herself with another smile.  "I have a badge, if you want to see my credentials?"
John climbed in a moment later, dropping his own bottle of water into the cup holder beside him.  He spent a few seconds fiddling with his safety belt before turning the ignition and carefully backing out of his parking spot.  He had to stop several times when employees and in one instance, a jackrabbit crossed behind him.  Eventually, however, John put the Humvee back in gear and they began the long trek to the highway.
"Thank you," Sherlock said, dousing his fries liberally.  He blew on the piece of fried potato to cool it off and popped it into his mouth.
"So...what's he doing?" Sherlock heard Mrs. Porter ask in an undertone.  The older woman's voice was rife with skepticism.  Sherlock ignored it.  She was hardly the first idiot to question his methods.
"—but what can you expect from an emotional, irrational  woman, eh?"  Sherlock concluded, his tone conveying long suffering exasperation with just a hint of contempt.
"Mom got me started, but I stuck with it because it's fun," Brenda explained, warming up to the topic and beginning to lecture Donovan on the history of the event and her mother's prowess.  Brenda's face grew more animated the longer she spoke, visibly relaxing in response to Donovan's gentle encouragement and open-ended questions.
"Christ Billy, no, no!" John said, shaking his head emphatically, his gaze apologetic.  He shifted his palm from Sherlock's chest to his shoulder, strong fingers holding Sherlock in place, or perhaps anchoring him, lest he flee.  "I want you to kiss me.  Of course I do.  I just want to make—"
Sherlock felt his mind go blank under the sensual onslaught of John Watson in full 'Three Circuits' mode.  All thoughts of the case, of John's motives, and his own suspicions vanished like so much mist on the moor.  If it hadn't been for John's strong hands holding him up, he almost certainly would have crumpled to the floor.
"Do you...think he's being blackmailed?" John continued, apparently heedless of Sherlock's sudden, intense, scrutiny.  "Maybe he's got some sort of money trouble, or I dunno...maybe he just doesn't want to bother with horses anymore?"
"Mmmm," Donovan replied noncommittally as she picked up one of the coffees and took a large sip while jiggling the mouse with her other hand to deactivate the automatic screen-saver.  The annoying images of a computer-generated starfield vanished, to be replaced with the incorrect password notification still appearing on the screen.  She blinked, quickly taking in evidence.  "What the?" Donovan exclaimed, before rounding to glare at Sherlock.  "Were you looking at my computer?"  Donovan demanded accusingly.
"—sort of drug would be my first guess, but I have no idea what it could be.  Temp's elevated, blood pressure's high.  He's sedated pretty heavily, but they're wearing off faster than they should.  For his sake, I want to get Scotty to a clinic for monitoring and palliative care.  The ambulance may be overkill, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.  Billy?"
"Interesting.  What did Mr. Straker gamble on?" Sherlock asked.  "Racehorses?  Cards?  Slot machines?"
"Why not?" John asked, his brow furrowing.  "Most spiders—camel spiders notwithstanding—are pretty neat.  They're certainly useful to have around.  Especially in barns."
"Wait, you're not seriously suggesting John's somehow involved, are you?" Lestrade asked incredulously.
John flashed a look that clearly communicated his opinion of Sherlock's intelligence, but didn't say anything beyond, "it's your arm."  Tucking his hands into his pockets, John turned to look past Sherlock's shoulder to the exhausted horse watching them warily.  "And how is the Devil?  As evil as ever?"
Sherlock blinked, realizing with some private chagrin that he'd apparently drunk a third of it.  Such actions didn't bode well for his intent to remain sober.  "Maybe in a bit," Sherlock demurred.  He studied the plate in front of him for a moment, noticing with no small amount of relief that the toppings were mostly clumped together on top.  The fries underneath were fairly plain.  Using his knife and fork, Sherlock began peeling the top layer of cheese back.
"There," John announced, settling back with a satisfied sigh.  "That's better," he continued, reaching up and threading the fingers of one hand through Sherlock's curls and urging Sherlock's head downward.  "Now where were we?" John purred rhetorically as he brushed his lips gently against Sherlock's in a portent of what was to come.
He did.  "I've brought 'Mr. Scott' in like you requested.  The man I caught poking around the stall where that trainer got himself killed?  The one you told me to keep an eye out for?"
"It was only a small fire," Sherlock huffed, irked by the reminder.  "Easily put out.  Nothing important was damaged."
"Ah.  I see.  One of the articles I skimmed mentioned your success in the field.  Lucrative, I take it?"  Sherlock asked, waving a hand at the room's expensive furnishings.
Sherlock slid carefully out of the bed.  He glanced over his shoulder to make sure John's eyes were still closed before slipping the single tablet of Rohypnol out of his left front jeans pocket.  Humming softly under his breath, Sherlock padded to the kitchen, stopping to pick up their abandoned wine glasses on the way.
The person in front of them finished paying and John stepped forward, already smiling at the woman behind the counter.  "Hey Martina!  Looking gorgeous, as always," John greeted her cheerfully, ignoring the fact that the employee's name tag read 'Hot Stuff: Super Barista!'"
"Nothing just...you're clearly brilliant.  Your voice changes when you're thinking.  It's like you lose your accent.  I like it," John added hurriedly.  "It just makes me sad that somebody ever made you feel like you had to dumb yourself down to have a real conversation...are you alright, Billy?  You've gone pale."
Even if Candii Ross had colluded with her regular vet to commit fraud, there were more subtle ways to kill a horse…such as a fatal electrical shock that would be attributed to colic, not something that could be discredited by any veterinarian with half a functioning brain cell.  The death of one of her employees also meant that the police especially would be investigating the case very carefully.  Likely with an eye towards murder or manslaughter charges.
Sherlock resisted the urge to smile at the mental image of Mycroft's face hearing the venerable sport of British racing reduced to "snobby Brits in funny hats".
Sherlock sniffed again.  Spicy food in and of itself wasn’t an issue, as long as he was anticipating it.  Perhaps he should take home a few extra bags as a present for Hudders to share with Mrs. Turner.  Both women enjoyed spicy cuisine, contrary to the British culinary stereotype of “boiled until bland and topped with salt.”  He had it on good authority that Hudder’s Jamaican-style jerk chicken was hot enough to make Mr. Chatterjee blink and he knew from personal experience how much of a kick his landlady’s home-made ginger nuts packed.  Sherlock dabbed at his watering eyes and blinked several times to clear his vision so he could turn his gaze back over the sea of bodies.  His transport’s demands or no, The Work still called.
"Unfortunately yes," John replied.  "Normally I wouldn't do this, but until we know what we're dealing with, I don't want to take any chances of him getting loose or attacking somebody."
John clicked through to another spreadsheet.  “Look here.  I’ve grouped the major wrecks by breeders.  Some-not all, but definitely a higher percentage-of bull riders get hurt if they’re on top of one of Sterndale’s animals.  But this is where it starts getting weird.”  John scrolled down to another set of entries.  “These are all recent cases of cattle going nuts.  You can see the steers going nuts on the day we met...here’s a dairy cow that attacked a kid during a farm show...and then there’s today.”  John stuck the tip of his tongue out of his mouth as he laboriously began typing in ‘STEER DECORATING: AGGRESSIVE ANIMALS.  RED EYES.  STERNDALE WANTS ENTIRE HERD EUTHANIZED.  IBR SUSPECTED, NOT CONFIRMED.’
>"Well yeah..." John said, his brow furrowing as he gave Sherlock a scrutinizing look.  "Unless you don't want to, that is?  Which is fine, by the way."
Sherlock didn't even attempt to hide his snort of derision.  "John, I told you my mother's first love was horses.  Can you really imagine such a woman spending a great deal of time in the kitchen?"
"Right.  Good," John said, nodding his firmly.  "Clint, Buck, Donny, Ron, you four cross-rope him and hold him steady.  Billy?  Greg?  The rest of you get ready to hang on.  The moment he's in place, I'll jump in and dose him."  John slid the capped syringe into his front pocket, along with a pair of latex gloves, before scrambling up the railings of the stall next door to Scotty's.  He balanced neatly on the narrow edge of the gate, with one hand holding on to a post, as confident as if he were standing flat on the ground.
"That's it," Donovan snapped under her breath, reaching out for the keyboard.  "I'm sorry.  If you would excuse us for just a minute," Donovan apologized through gritted teeth to the two furious adults and the shell-shocked teenager sniffling on the other end of the screen.  She stabbed the 'mute' button on the computer and immediately rounded on Sherlock.  "Holmes," Donovan began, her voice deadly sweet, "I am allowing you to sit in on this interview as a courtesy.  So unless you want to find yourself arrested for abuse and or harassment charges, I suggest you either apologize to our witness, shut up, or both."
"Er, no thank you," Sherlock declined, his nose wrinkling at the harsh odour of the spirits.  How the man could bear the stomach-churning combination of tobacco juice and rotgut whiskey was a question for the ages.
"Christ, Billy!  It's going on two," John grumbled, interrupting Sherlock's snit.  "How much longer do you think you're going to be?"
Sherlock smiled in satisfaction as he spotted what he was looking for.  Trampled down grass, an almost bare patch just outside the paddock, and a small, sticky handprint pressed against the bottom rail of the fence.  A few, tiny, glinting crystals glimmered in the dry dirt.  He dampened the tip of his right forefinger and picked a few of them up before touching them to his tongue.  As he expected, there was a trace of sweetness mixed with the mineral taste of the dirt.  With a smirk, Sherlock snapped his magnifier shut and spun to his feet.  "John mentioned you had grandchildren, Mrs. Porter?"
"Look, Holmes," Donovan snapped,  "I'm running on about three hours of sleep.  Give me fifteen minutes to drink my coffee in peace before I have to do myself for voluntary manslaughter.  Alright?"
The stallion was even more impressive in person than he'd been in the photographs and Sherlock found himself grudgingly impressed.  Just watching Devil's Blaze snort and rear, Sherlock could see certain physical traits that would make him a prime candidate for Eventing, if the stallion had been properly saddle-broken and trained.
"What?  In that case, how the hell do you know about weird fetishes anyway?" John predictably interrupted, his attention no-doubt caught by 'virginal Billy Scott's' hitherto unsuspected carnal knowledge.
"Nope.  Tuesday I'm scheduled to perform a bunch of calf castrations and vaccinations for a rancher out in Happy.  I have no idea how long it might take."
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder to see what John was doing.  John had settled into parade rest with his hands clasped behind his back.  His gaze fixed on the hallway that Sterndale's daughter had vanished down.  Sherlock could easily read the anticipation thrumming through John's body from the set of his shoulders and the angle of his chin.  It was clear that John considered waiting while standing to be the more polite option.  Sherlock, however, had no such compunctions.  He dropped into one of the leather chairs and crossed his legs, before picking up one the numerous magazines lying on the table beside him and flipping it open, fairly certain of what he would find.
Sherlock stared down at the screen of his phone, trying to decide how to respond.  Arthur and Harry might be playing a disgustingly-sentimental game over the outcomes of each ride, but he was still shaken by the rider’s near miss.  A horse’s kick could exert anywhere from zero to two thousand pounds of pressure per square inch—easily enough to fracture a human skull.  As much as he wanted to type “WEAR A HELMET, YOU IDIOT!” he didn’t want to risk throwing John out of whatever competition mindset he’d put himself in.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he stared at the menu's array of offerings in more detail, slightly overwhelmed by the selection and appalled by the names. 'Alice in Wonder Bread,' 'Reuben Hood,' 'Grilled Expectations,' 'Don Chipotle, and worse.  The 'Memphis' at least looked interesting: peanut butter and sliced bananas drizzled with local honey and served on golden raisin and cinnamon toast.  There was also a French-style sandwich filled with roast beef, onion and cheese with the horrifying moniker 'Johnny Dipp'.  "I'll have a 'Memphis'."
After parking the truck, Sherlock turned and picked up the denim jacket that was lying beside him on the passenger's seat.  It was a specialty piece, carefully tailored with multiple custom interior pockets secreted inside the lining.  It had been modified to hold a host of tools and drugs without distorting the lines where it draped over his lean frame.  The jacket had cost him a small fortune for such short notice, but he didn't care.  He could easily write it off on his taxes as a business expense, or add the cost to Candii Ross's eventual bill if she continued to annoy him.
As Sherlock strode past, Bonnie roused herself from the stack of straw bales she'd been lying on as she watched the humans work with the air of a benevolent furry supervisor.  She yawned and stretched, tongue lolling and tail wagging before falling in at Sherlock's heels with a happy bark.
With a flick of his head Sherlock dismissed the distracting shard of memory in favor of focusing on the Work.  There was something about the crowd that was tweaking at the edge of his consciousness, but he couldn't quite place his finger on it.  The longer he stared, the more the thought shimmered out of reach, like one of the minnows or frogs he used to try and catch in the garden pond back home.
Donovan looked down at the notes she'd been taking, her lips moving as she silently read.  "So," Donovan began, looking up to meet Brenda's eyes, "to summarize: there was nothing immediately unusual in Cream Soda's behavior prior to the attack, an unknown individual helped you put Cream Soda back in her stall, and you don't recall her eating anything unusual.  You've tentatively identified the alleged reporter that was wandering around the fairgrounds, there may be video of the attack available online, and you received quite a bit of hate mail after the video was uploaded.  Is there anything else you'd like to add?"
Mr. Tregennis looked puzzled, clearly thrown by Sherlock's British accent, but what he asked was "are you a horse therapist?"
, the analytical part of his mind observed dispassionately.  Head trauma, even minor head trauma tended to have that effect.
The lobby was empty except for a young girl with cardamom-hued skin and long, wavy hair.  She was sitting behind one of the room's two reception desks, playing some sort of computer game.  Sherlock could hear the whistles and chirps coming from where the computer's speakers weren't quite muted.  Sherlock quirked an eyebrow, taking in the girl's features.  Eleven, maybe twelve; clearly too young to be a legitimate employee.  No makeup and her hair was pulled back in a simple, low ponytail.  She was also extremely modestly dressed in a long-sleeved, pink plaid blouse.  Sterndale's daughter, perhaps?  Anthea's file had mentioned he had one.
"So...what do you remember from that night?" John asked, looking between Sherlock and Ned as if he wasn't quite convinced that the two men weren't about to come to blows.
He’d anticipated that watching John ride in person would be no different…and he had not been disappointed.  It had been simultaneously the most exciting and stomach-clenching six seconds that Sherlock could ever remember experiencing.  Even the thrill of sneaking a ride on his mother's prize stallion didn't compare to seeing John compete.  John had been…magnificent.  There was no other word for it.  In a distant part of Sherlock's mind, he was aware that his observations sounded suspiciously like hyperbole, but it was unimportant.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in silent admiration of the electron microscope and other top-of-the-line lab equipment they passed as Anderson led them to an empty glassed-in workstation near the back of the lab.  The station had been as ruthlessly disinfected as the rest of the lab if the scent of solvents was any indicator.  A thick, spiral-bound book of safety procedures sat precisely in the center of the worktop.  Boxes full of different sizes of gloves, sterile pipettes, Petri dishes and other basic supplies were neatly arranged on the shelf above.
Sterndale raised a silent eyebrow, his scorn apparent, even behind the shield of ceramic.  John pursed his lips, his eyes narrowing in reaction.  "Okay, yes, I know.  Stupid question, considering you specialize in rank bulls.  I mean, more specifically, have you had complaints of animals that have been acting more aggressive or hyperactive than usual?  Or maybe any cases that look like Jimson weed or wooly locoweed poisoning?"
Instead of being offended, though, John sent him a cheeky wink and a very smug grin.  "I’ve never had a problem with mountain climbing...I’m dating you, aren’t I?  Besides, vertical differences don’t matter so much when both parties are horizontal...as you very well know..."
"Billy, I'd like you to meet Mary-Ann, Renée, and Carley," John said, indicating each person as he made the introductions.  "Ladies, this is my friend, Billy.  He's new to the area...and green...so be nice to him, all right Renée?" John added with a pointed look at the woman in question.
"Two waters to start," John ordered for them both, "and then I'll take a pint of the Railyard Amber Ale.  Billy?"
The death notice was the first document he opened.  According to her obituary, Bititi Willem had been an only child and had been predeceased by her mother.  She’d earned a bachelor's degree agricultural science from Auburn University and gone on to earn a doctorate in neurotoxicology.
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes, we are aware of that trick," Donovan retorted, "and to answer your question, not that we could see.  Our team found several hundred dollars cash in one of the bedside drawers…not something a burglar would likely overlook, assuming there even was one."
John shot him another look, his expression shifting from wary to intrigued, rather than annoyed.  "Go on then," John challenged, "walk me through it?"
"Thank you," Donovan said, quickly writing the name down and circling it.  "Now, what did EquineadvoKat do?"
for listening to me babble about plot/missing-word-catching/grammer proofing/snark/"there there" noises when I'm banging my head against the keyboard/being a general voice of reason/making me laugh with their feedback/etc.  Thanks also to
John growled in encouragement, his cheeks hollowing inward as he sucked even harder.  The obscene sound was enough to tip Sherlock over the edge.  White-hot pleasure coursed through Sherlock’s frame, making him keen.  Dimly he was aware of John grunting, but the motions of John’s mouth didn’t stop.  Instead, John gentled Sherlock through the aftershocks, the plastic barrier between them preventing it from becoming too much.
"You've mentioned Doctor Watson several times.  I'm aware that he accompanied New Scotland Yard to your clinic.  Do you happen to know if Doctor Watson was ever alone with New Scotland Yard?"
Sterndale pursed his lips and brought his mug of tea up to take a sip, visibly stalling for time.  His eyes flicked sideways at John Watson before returning to meet Sherlock's.  "I am hesitant to speak ill of the dead, Mr. Scott," he finally replied.  "What have you heard?"
Turning away from the walls of fame, Sherlock began to examine the furniture for more information.  The groupings of leather chairs were impressive, but the lack of wear on the seats and arms indicated that they were used primarily for decoration, rather than seating.  Sterndale's clients didn't spend a great deal of time waiting in the lobby, despite what the coffee machine might imply.  Low tables were scattered around the room, all conveniently placed in close proximity to the chairs.  Their glass tops held an assortment of different magazines that had been strategically fanned out to show the covers.  The majority of them were devoted to bull riding: PSN, ProRodeo Sports News, Spin to Win Rodeo, Pro Bull Rider and several other similar titles.  The dates printed on the covers varied.  Some were brand new.  Others were several years old, but still in good condition, preserved as they were in protective plastic covers.
Drumming the fingers of his right hand on his bent knee, Sherlock reached into his back pocket with his left to pull out his mobile.  A quick swipe of his thumb across the screen revealed that only twenty minutes had passed since he'd last checked it.  The latest non-Mycroftian message, received roughly forty minutes ago, had been from one of Ms. Ross's employees.  Molly Hooper  had apologetically texted him that she'd be a bit late due to an unforeseen traffic jam.
With a snort of pain, the stallion jerked his head away and wheeled around.  Two long-legged bounds took the stallion safely out of Sherlock's range to the edge of the corral where, at Sherlock's barked command and hand signal, he immediately broke into a run again.
...only to grunt in anguish and slam his eyes closed in self defense as the light from the halogen fixtures overhead pierced his retinas.  The light resembled streaks of lightning, or shards of broken mirrors, burrowing into his brain like high-velocity projectiles and strewing pain in their wake.  An agonized whine forced its way through Sherlock's clenched teeth.  He had the horrible feeling that he was about to be horribly, violently ill.
"Okay.  It took some digging, but I found the pair I was thinking of," the shopkeeper announced cheerfully as he approached, effectively distracting Sherlock from his thoughts.  "Here," he offered, holding his prize out.  "Try these on.  I think these'll be exactly what you're looking for."
"I know Texas is a Bible Belt state, but women are just as entitled as men to enjoy a night of Netflix and chilling, no matter what the politicians and pastors may think," Molly added, apparently seeing—and misinterpreting—Sherlock's frown.  "If you're offended by the idea of women having lots of casual sex and enjoying it—"
Sherlock shook his head, dismissing the train of thought to refocus on the matter at hand.  Alice's explanation for the horse's behavior wasn't wrong, (horses could and did get stir crazy) but it felt insufficient.  More importantly, he'd learned to trust his subconscious impressions.  "That may be," Sherlock began, unclipping the lead from Girandola's halter and smacking the gelding lightly on the flank to urge him along, "but something seems off—"
"What do you mean?" Sherlock asked with a frown as he tilted his head to one side, his forehead furrowing in confusion.
Sherlock looked up from the computer screen, his brow creasing in thought as he recalled that Sterndale had implied that his late wife had been interested in the field of mycology, but a quick review of the attached academic records showed something quite different; only Sterndale’s records contained classes on edible and toxic fungi. Sherlock frowned in confusion.  Why had Sterndale lied?
Doctor Sterndale’s history was slightly more interesting.  He'd emigrated from Zimbabwe in 1987, married and obtained eventual citizenship in the United States.  He'd graduated from the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine and had traveled extensively as a rodeo veterinarian before setting up his own practice.  It was an exclusive practice devoted to stock contractors and high-caliber performance animals, both horses and bulls.  His bio listed him as widowed with a daughter.  The rest of the reports Anthea had supplied contained cursory information about Ms. Ross's other employees: names, photographs, dates of birth, et cetera.
Donovan opened her mouth to answer, but Sherlock spoke first.  "I'm currently rehabilitating a horse that is exhibiting behaviors similar to what was described in the news articles regarding your daughter's attack."
"Well, first I looked for signs of a sore back," John began as he merged onto the motorway and began driving them to their destination.
"Mmmmm...yes."  Mycroft absently flicked an invisible piece of lint off his trousers.  "Doctor Watson pointed out that instances of rabies in horses in the United States were quite rare.  He mentioned that he'd spent years stationed in places where the rabies virus was endemic and that the sudden onset of the horse's symptoms didn't match his own clinical experience. Finally, Doctor Watson also drew attention to the fact that the horse was not responding normally to the sedatives, indicating that something else, perhaps an opiate or another drug was was responsible for the stallion's uncharacteristic behavior."
"My presence or the presence of my staff would have meant he wasn't alone," Doctor Früh pointed out dryly, "but yes, Doctor Watson probably spent some time alone with New Scotland Yard."
Admittedly, the way Fizzy Simpson had attempted to spy on him from under the bleachers was a  bit more careless than he was used to, but nobody could be clever all the time.  Simpson had offered the rather clumsy explanation that he’d merely been enjoying his break, but the fact that he’d almost immediately attempted to bribe Sherlock for tips about Candii Ross’s bucking strings had given lie to his claim.  Simpson’s allusions to being a friend of the late Joe Straker also struck him as odd.  Alice Turner’s statement that Simpson’s apparent altruism was also for personal gain, combined with Edith Baxter’s subsequent disclosure that Simpson was a known gambler had only increased the vague suspicions Sherlock  harboured about the man.  He’d seen for himself that Simpson was clearly obsessed with money—why else would he charge a family for a photo op?  But greed didn’t necessarily make him complicit in Straker’s death.
Sherlock ordered his mind.  John wasn't like Victor.  John's earnestness and sincerity radiated from every pore.  Donovan's suspicions about John perhaps being behind Devil's Blaze's change in behavior were just that, suspicions.  Thus far, he'd seen nothing in either the medical records or conduct to indicate otherwise.  Drugging John and hacking his banking records to prove his innocence would be a mere formality.
"Can it, Mr. Holmes," the stock contractor snapped, coming to her feet and slamming both palms flat on the desk with a sudden thwap.  "I ain't payin' you to disrespect me."  Candii gave Sherlock a dark look, obviously waiting to see if he'd say anything in response.  When he didn't, she resumed her seat as if nothing untoward had occurred.  "As I was sayin', I'm suspicious because I know my horses and I know my trainers.  That damn vet's accusations aside—not to mention the propaganda those damn PETA and SHARK fanatics like to sprout—Joe wouldn't dare hit one of my horses unless he was defending himself, and Blaze—no matter how feisty he was feelin'—would never attack a human if he was in his right mind."
"You need me," Sherlock retorted, ignoring Lestrade's surprise and focusing on the Appaloosa in front of him.
Four fresh pairs of gloves and several empty baggies went into the front pockets of his jacket.  A half-dozen condoms and a few packages of slick went into the matching pocket on the other side.  Two clean handkerchiefs were tucked into one of the side pockets.  They would be useful both for preventing tell-tale fingerprints and for cleaning up any bodily fluids later if the evening went as planned.  His Kingpin HyperX Predator 1TB USB drive (a present from Jim), along with two, smaller backup USB drives went into one of the sealable inner pockets of his denim jacket, while his VuPoint magic wand portable scanner went into another.  John didn't seem like the type to keep stacks of papers about, but it was better to plan ahead and not need something than to curse himself for his lack of foresight afterwards, Sherlock reasoned as he double-checked the charge on the device.  A lighter and his false-bottomed, metal cigarette case containing vials of flunitrazepam, GHB, ketamine, diazepam, and alprazolam went into an empty side pocket.  After another quick moment of deliberation, Sherlock tucked his phone, keys, and wallet into his jacket as well.  Carrying them in the pockets of his jeans would only distort the lines of his trousers and add unsightly lumps to his arse.
"Yeah.  I can do that.  There's a gas station near the turnoff for Palo Duro Canyon.  Exit 217, I believe.  Meet me there around six?  Or, if you like I could pick you up at the Triple C and take you to the ranch from there.  What works best for you?"
The room still felt unbearably muggy and hot, despite the rattling of the window unit and the best efforts of the cabin's ceiling fan.  Sherlock rolled over, trying in vain to seek a cool spot on his pillow case before giving up with a huff and flopping back on his eyes to glare at the ceiling.
“What about trauma?” Sterndale asked, accepting the pair of latex gloves the vet offered him.  “Mr. Scott?  Is it?”
"Saturday evening, then?" Sherlock asked, leaning back and deliberately resting the rim of his coffee mug below his lower lip to draw attention to his mouth.
Without bothering to ask for permission, Sherlock opened the room's door, revealing a rudimentary lab, complete with a refrigerator, a microscope, boxes of medical supplies and several stainless steel counters.  A small row of specimen jars sat off to the side.  Curious, Sherlock walked over to investigate them more closely.
Sterndale snorted.  "Mr. Scott, I would take a mountain lion over a Cape buffalo any day.  Pound for pound, they are probably the most dangerous game animal in the world.  In Africa, they are considered one of the 'Big Five'."
“Go on, dear.  Take him a pastry and a hot cuppa,” Mrs. Hudson ordered, stuffing the aforementioned items into Sherlock’s hands and practically shoving Sherlock out the door.
The elderly woman's voice trailed off as she caught sight of her madman of a tenant standing in front of the doorway to the kitchen.  He was giving her his shamming 'I'm innocent' smile, the one that never fooled anybody, despite what he continued to believe.  More worrying was the way his body blocked her view into the room beyond.
.  Suddenly desperate to touch John's bare skin, Sherlock moved his hands around to John's front and began feeling for John's shirt placket.  A moment later, he snorted in frustration.  He couldn't reach it from his current position.
"Well, 'Two Tarts' probably makes the best lemonade around, and they're sorta on the way," John commented as he surveyed the program again.  "It looks like the main performances—which include two bull riding sections each night—will be taking place in the Amarillo National Center.  I'm pretty sure the bulls will be stabled in the covered cattle pens just north of it," John said as he began to lead Sherlock in the appropriate direction.
"He is," Molly replied with a nod.  "Which is why he's stabled alone.  If you're thinking there might have been a rival stallion, or a mare in estrus nearby, there wasn't.  The barn was actually pretty empty.  The only reason Blaze was even stabled there was because there was some sort of mixup somewhere and I guess that's where they put the overflow."
"Yes," Sherlock admitted.  He wasn't, not really, but perhaps agreeing would pacify his host.  Sherlock watched John put the violin case away in its drawer with a pang of regret.  Perhaps later he could convince John to let him play.  He followed John into the kitchen nook and began unpacking the to-go boxes while John busied himself with clearing off the small table.  The papers vanished into a locked drawer while the pens ended up in a jar on top of the entertainment center.
John rubbed one hand against the back of his neck and grimaced, his expressive eyebrows amplifying the look.  "Just...well...Most people wouldn't bother coming back, not after having been accidentally spat on or having a cold drink dumped in their lap.  I've had dates end abruptly for less."
to them, maybe even invite them to share their table.  Sherlock was distracted from his less-than-pleasant train of thought by the sound of the leather impacting polyester resin, the clack of billiard balls ricocheting off of each other as John broke, followed by John's exuberant whoop as he sunk several spheres
Sherlock smirked as he slid to his feet, aware that he was being watched by possible rivals for John's attention.  "I'll keep that in mind...I'm intrigued by the cocktail list...the 'Lock Pick' looked interesting, as did the 'Honey Bee'."
Sherlock waved a languid hand in dismissal.  No doubt John would insist on Stamford’s instructions being followed to the letter.  "Tedious."
John coughed and cleared his throat, flushing uncomfortably.  "Right, um, no.  Look, I know this is...rather awkward, but I need your expertise regarding some odd cattle symptoms.  Do you have a minute?"
"Shut it.  Both of you," John ordered.  "I know you're both worried, but we'll know more once I get Scotty to the clinic and run some tests.  In the meantime," John began, taking his keys from his pocket, grabbing Sherlock's hand and slapping his keys into Sherlock's palm with enough force to sting, "you do me a favor and get a scotch hobble, a set of standard hobbles and a grazing muzzle from my truck, okay?  It's the large army footlocker on the left.  Thanks.  Greg," John continued, turning to face the other man, "fill a bucket with some cool water so I can clean off the worst of Scotty's injuries.  I need to know what I'm dealing with."
Against his will, Sherlock found himself looking.  The boy was almost jumping up and down in excitement as he tugged on his father’s hand, (clearly trying to lead his father somewhere), while the little girl banged enthusiastically on the horn of a dark green 1948 MG-TC Roadster under the indulgent eye of the owner.  “Humph,” Sherlock sniffed.  “More likely they are excited because they have consumed large amounts of sugar.”
"Yeah," John replied, his worried frown replacing itself with a promising leer.  "But you'll have to give me a bit first—I'm not seventeen anymore!"
"Melba Toastya, a South African racehorse of some renown.  It was a possible case of equine murder, though it was never solved as such," Mycroft explained, handing his brother the second to last folder he'd removed from his attaché case.  "I'm not surprised you don't recall the incident, you were only five at the time.  To summarize, Melba Toastya was slated to win the Durban July Handicap in 1986, but three days before the race was set to begin he went berserk, attacking and killing a groom in the process.  Unfortunately, the animal also sustained a broken leg while attacking his stall and had to be euthanized.  His owner was investigated, but eventually cleared of any wrongdoing."
“So what can I get you, hon?” The waitress asked, interrupting Sherlock’s dithering.  He glanced up, taking in a sturdy-looking woman with inch-long, hot pink nails the put Sherlock’s mind to claws,  She cheerfully scrutinized him over the rims of her lime-green cat-eye glasses.  “I’m a gonna guess you’re gonna want a coffee to start?  You have that look about you.”
‘Other stuff’ likely referred to Harry Watson, Sherlock knew.  Best to change the subject…which wasn’t that difficult, since John was buckling his chaps back on in front of him.  Sherlock cleared his throat, trying not to stare too obviously at how the leather was showcasing John’s groin and arse.
"What did you want to know what my plans for the day are," Sherlock clarified, barely managing to resist the urge to call Molly an idiot to her face.  Instead, he settled for tilting his head and giving her an inquisitive look.
a lie, more of a case of implied misdirection, since 'candy floss' was the more common name used in England.  "My Nan—" (and hopefully Mrs. Hudson would never learn of him referring to her as his grandmother; she would have no compunction about swatting him with a wooden spoon if she did for such a gross exaggeration of her age) "—she calls it 'Fairy Floss'."
"She's an idiot, Mycroft," Sherlock snapped back, "with an obviously fake falsetto tone and no respect for pedigrees.  For God's sake," Sherlock continued, his voice rising, "not six months ago she spent over four million pounds on an Akhal Teke with poor conformation as a first communion gift for her goddaughter 'because the little Susie liked the colour' and then the brat had the gall to name the horse 'Goldilicious' after a children's book character!"
"I did, but that's not the problem…I just stood up too fast," Sherlock replied, forcing himself to wrest his chin from John's gentle grip.  He swallowed, suppressing his habitual curtness with effort and modulating his tone into something warmer.  "I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine," Sherlock added with a smile.
Rodeos were about excitement and bragging rights.  Originally, the animals used for competitions had been whatever a rodeo organizer could scrounge up: steers, bulls, wild mustangs, badly broken horses and the like.  As rodeos became monetized, however, the job of collecting animals for competition became the province of professional stock contractors, rather than rodeo organizers.  They were the ones that sought out difficult animals for competitions or deliberately introduced animals that were more dangerous than normal.
"Condoms," John reminded him firmly.  "And you should put your underwear back on first—it'll reduce the likelihood of accidentally transmitting anything."
In the distance he could see the battered white pickup truck he'd been instructed to watch for.  A bright white piece of cardboard, a sign most likely, judging by the size and the faint black streaks marring its surface, was tucked into the windshield, while a tabby-coloured, kitten-shaped Christmas ornament hung from the rearview mirror. The truck inched slowly down the line of parked cars, searching for an empty space.  Opportunity arose when an SUV suddenly pulled out and the driver of the pickup claimed the vacated spot with surprising agility for such a junky-looking vehicle.
"No hold onto that," Sherlock ordered, shoving it back into John's hands.  Ignoring John's huff of annoyance, Sherlock pulled out his wallet and hurriedly counting the bills.  "John, I need you to lend me fifty quid."
"Oh now.  That's nice.  That's very nice indeed," Sherlock breathed, sitting back on his heels to better appreciate the full glory of John Watson.
"Fancy meeting you here," John gasped, sliding to a stop next to Sherlock, heedless of the glares he was garnering from idiots who probably thought he was attempting to cut the queue.  He was breathing hard from his sprint across the fairgrounds.  Still panting, John dropped the oversized plastic toolbox he'd been carrying on the ground and bent forward, resting his hands on his knees as he caught his breath.
The pictures were a mixture of amateur and professional shots.  Some depicted the scene: the enormous florescent lights creating harsh shadows and throwing the colours of the barn and inhabitants in stark relief.  Blurred forms captured the frenetic energy of the uniformed police and denim-clad cowboys rushing around the space.  Several had their arms upraised, either gesturing or pointing.  Their faces were set in expressions of command or concern.  A cluster of blue-shirted paramedics stood off to one side, a collapsible gurney and bags of portable medical equipment ready at hand.  In the background, one cowboy had his phone out, clearly filming the proceedings.
There were two small windows, one on the east wall, that would offer a view a distant pond when daylight was present.  The one facing south looked back towards the house, offering the same view as one in the cabin's main room.  Both windows were hung with the same black blinds and curtained in a dark red fabric patterned with small flowers.
A distressed wooden credenza stood against the wall underneath.  The top was decorated with a bowl full of rose-scented potpourri, adding a faint floral note to the scent of leather and wood that permeated the room.  A few unlit candles set in antique silver holders sat on either side of the bowl, together with several photographs depicting horses rearing, running, or bucking.  One or two photographs featured an older man pictured with a younger version of the woman currently seated behind the desk.  There were no wedding pictures or photos of children.
The blond man in question didn’t so much as blink.  Sherlock’s yell was not the ‘I’m-bleeding-and-need-your-medical-expertise’ variety.  Nor was it the ‘I’m-currently-being-throttled-by-a-seven-foot-tall-Russian-Valkyrie variety.  It hadn’t even approached the ‘John-come-help-me-clean-this-up-before-Mrs.-Hudson-returns-and-holds-my-violin-hostage’ decibel level, which was a decidedly dangerous tone to ignore, (as John had learned from previous bitter experience).  Instead, it was somewhere between ‘Anderson opened his mouth’ and ‘Bored!’, which was normal when living with a deductive genius who had the attention span and patience of a toddler.
Undeterred by Sherlock's curt tone, the woman leaned back, flicking her honey-blond hair over her shoulders.  She gave him a winsome smile, all ridiculously white teeth framed by her choice of coral pink lipstick.  Still smiling, she brought her own feet forward, showing off a pair of dainty, highly-tooled, two-tone leather cowboy boots decorated with dark blue leather cutouts, silver embroidery, and more sequins.
Sherlock glared down at the red Solo cup he was holding from under the brim of his cowboy hat, trying not to grimace at the bitter taste its contents had left behind in his mouth.  He wasn't much for beer.  He vastly preferred uppers to downers, (Mycroft's opinions on the matter notwithstanding), but he'd given away his last cigarette in an effort to build rapport with a stablehand earlier.  Even if he hadn't, the madness that had prompted London's 2006 Health Act and the subsequent ban on indoor smoking had spread as far as the United States.  There were several prominently-placed signs threatening all sorts of creative punishments for any individual caught lighting up inside the premises.  When he
A tentative throat clearing from behind him had Sherlock snapping back into his role with a genial smile fixed firmly on his face.  He deliberately rounded his shoulders as he turned to face the waiting staff.  The change in posture made him appear shorter and far less intimidating.
The barns were all painted a clean white, edged with dark green trim; the rich, unfaded colour testified to regular repainting in defiance of the harsh, bleaching sun.  The corrals and fences were also painted a glossy white, making them highly visible to humans and equines alike.
There was a comfortable lull in the conversation.  John concentrated on the road in front of them while Sherlock divided his attention between the passing landscape and sneaking glances at the vet.  Eventually, John took an exit that resembled every other exit they'd passed, and a few minutes later, they were pulling up in front of Doctor Sterndale's clinic.
"Thoroughbreds and other riding horses," Sherlock replied immediately, sticking to the truth, if not the truth in its entirety.  “I've also done quite a bit of work with performance animals...dressage stallions, show jumpers and the like."
Sherlock swallowed hard and looked away, shame creeping through him in a sick tide at Donovan's response.  How many times had he heard people imply that the only reason he got his job was because of his relation to Mycroft or his family's wealth, rather than his own skills?  Even Victor had expressed similar sentiments.  Worse still was the imagined expression on Mrs. Hudson's face at hearing him echo something her late (and unlamented) husband might have said.  Her disappointed expression would be paired with a soft
"It's Friday, Billy," John explained with an affectionate chuckle.  "Did you forget we have a date tonight?  I'm hurt," he added with a teasing grin.
"And for you?" the bored-looking teenager was standing behind the glass asked, directing his inquiry towards John.
Wrinkling his nose in derision, Sherlock turned his attention to the small lounge at the far end of Sterndale's office.  The space had been created by adding in two short half-walls painted and trimmed out to match the rest of the room's design.  The result was a cozy alcove, outfitted with a large, wall-mounted flat-screen television, the aforementioned wet bar, more leather-upholstered chairs and a selection of trophies.  The coffee table was reminiscent of a Victorian curiosities cabinet.  The recessed wooden shadow box contained the room's only signs of Sterndale's African roots.
"Fuck you, you judgmental, misogynistic freak," Donovan snarled, her upper lip curling in derision.  "Maybe
Sherlock rolled his eyes before opening the first of the two insulated containers, revealing the rows of vials of preserved blood and urine he'd collected from the different horses at the Triple C.  He pursed his lips for a moment in indecision, before moving to the wall cabinet to select the appropriate chemicals for sample evaporation.  It was a process that would most likely take several hours to run.  Another batch of samples would be lyophilized, or freeze-dried, which would allow them to be stored at room temperatures without the risk of degradation.
Horse whisperer.  Sherlock grimaced at the American term.  It was an utterly inaccurate description; one that was infused with mysticism and secrecy.  There was nothing magical about his methods.  His successes came from a keen understanding of equine psychology and a training approach based on kindness and patience.  But the title was popular enough that it was easy for him to create a character to emulate it.
Sherlock turned so he was facing the struggling gelding head on, taking a grip on the lead rope with his left hand instead of his right.  At the same time, he flicked his right wrist, dropping the training wand in the sheath strapped to his forearm down and deploying it to its full four-foot length.  He glanced over his shoulder and nodded at Edith before jerking on the gelding's lead line to gain a little slack.  The moment Edith released the clip, the gelding snorted and began running backwards out of the trailer.  Sherlock followed, flicking the lead line to make the horse back up even faster as they shot out of the dim trailer and into the sunlight.
"You were impressive," Sherlock admitted honestly.  "It was practically a textbook example of disengagement.  I don't think I could have done it better myself.  Did you grow up around horses?"
Sherlock fought the urge to close his eyes and bang his forehead against the metal door.  It wasn’t like John to be this thick.  Adrenaline-induced shock, perhaps?  Instead, he twisted his wrist and was rewarded by the lock finally giving.  A moment later he’d yanked John inside the surprisingly-spacious closet and locked the door behind them, guaranteeing there would be no interruptions.
This is the prompt that got me started on this AU...I seriously did not expect it to turn into what will eventually be a multi-chapter casefic/romance.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he stared at him, trying to gage Stamford’s sincerity.  The doctor’s butter-wouldn’t-melt in his mouth explanation seemed a bit too convenient...but it also allowed him to save face and he was starting to feel rather unwell as the clamor of his transport’s complaints seemed to increase with the loss of distraction.  Sherlock finally nodded, accepting the explanation.
Sherlock turned his head to study at the bull in question.  The bovine was clearly muscled, but he had no background frame of reference for determining what was considered desirable in a bucking bull's confirmation.  "What makes Bushwhacker and Yellow Face so special?" Sherlock finally asked, raising one eyebrow as he looked back at Baz for an explanation.
He'd taken advantage of the enforced breaks to snoop through Donovan's office, looking for more information on the Devil's Blaze case, but it had been for naught.  Donovan apparently utilized some arcane organization method understood only by her.  Most of the files he'd skimmed through were for dull insurance fraud cases involving automobiles, a diamond necklace, and a box of expensive Cuban cigars that had been insured for arson and then smoked.  The ones that didn't pertain to insurance fraud involved identity theft and pharmaceutical scams.  Wherever the Devil's Blaze file was, it wasn't here.
