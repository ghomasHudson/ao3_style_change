Except this time, when it would be too obviously unnecessary. Sherlock made himself look up from the jar.
He closed his eyes as the bile rose up in his throat. There was still blood on the concrete, seeping into the sidewalk. The police hadn’t gotten here yet.
"By rights, you should have seen it coming," Sherlock replied calmly, mirroring Mrs. Hudson's sentiments. John hoped he got hit by one of the projectile

“There was no hurry,” James replied, trying to sound as polite as possible. John stayed silent and James held his breath, concerned he'd pushed the man too far too fast. This was a soldier with pride – he'd be perfectly capable of walking out of here and fending for himself. Finally, John sighed and wrestled his phone from his pocket.

John started toward the dogsled, doing his best to pretend nothing had changed. He could feel Sherlock watching him, but before he could get to the dogsled

London was nothing without him in it. John swallowed. Living without him had seemed so very useless.
John skipped over the examiner's chart. It didn't matter now. If Sherlock was alive, Molly would have been in on it. She had signed the chart.
“To add insult to injury, I was never able to blog about that one, for it was quickly deemed classified information,” John explained, laying back on the
It was barely two weeks later, after the warm night where the snow fell sticky, that Sherlock saw the bear tracks wandering around the caribou meat cache.

nodded cautiously, a reminder tingling in his brain that this was John's tone when things had gone spectacularly, horribly wrong.

John thought, though the area was great. He snorted to himself; as if a flat's walking score was likely to change his mind about living with a crime boss. Sherlock opened the flat's unlocked door ahead of Mrs. Hudson and strode comfortably inside, rather breaking the illusion that he'd only just 'had his eye' on the place. John followed him.
"Have," Sherlock signed and John copied it. And there, John's glance at his face, looking impressed and happy and approving despite it all. He'd solved
John remembered benignly, putting his keys in his pocket and doing his best not to think about anything else.

“I have skins,” John replied. He’d never spoken more than ten words to anyone, out here. That’d been rather the point. Andy nodded and gestured to a woman at the back. She slipped out to go inspect his haul, only to stop short as Sherlock ducked into the room, a burst of condensation entering with him. The elder woman pursed her lips for a long moment, watching as Sherlock closed the door too slowly and water droplets settled over their collection of coats. She exchanged a long glance with Andy and hurried outside.

John huffed out a laugh, drawing Sherlock’s curious look. John matched his gaze for a moment, unsure what to say, and Sherlock moved on to unpackaging a

The man chuckled and pulled a pair of glasses out of his shirt pocket to focus on the paper in his hands.
He couldn’t help but let the words have their intended effect. Dread pooled in his stomach and he struggled to think about anything but the coming nail
"You don't want to watch it? You might enjoy it. I enjoy it," Magnussen said, glancing at where the video had been projected.

“I was on the other side of London...” John bit out. Reasonable. But then, half the point of 'Sherlock Holmes' was for when reason couldn't explain a behavior. A certain dose of insanity was necessary.
