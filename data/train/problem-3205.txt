Something tells Dean this won’t go away in the morning. He leaves Sam alone at the table.
“Well, this Sam’s computer password is the same as mine, so I went through his stuff, and...wow.” Dean hears a sound on the other end, Sam shuffling papers around. Sam takes a breath. “Okay, so like, all the stuff from the bunker—most of it’s been digitized in encrypted files, but that’s not all that’s in here. There are
“You know, the television is right there. We could watch cartoons on that.”
“Awake,” Dean replies, groaning.
“A is the class for the most sensitive and powerful artifacts. They’re federally-controlled. Did you get the thing?” Dean digs into the inside of his jacket and pulls out an ID card. He puts it on the table. Sam does the same. “Okay so—”
“What?” Sam says, swallowing a bite. “I got hungry.”
He really hoped he would be home by now.
He didn’t know how long it was that he sat there. Minutes? Hours? He couldn’t bring himself to move. To move would be to acknowledge that Cas was gone, and he couldn’t. How? There was so much he wanted to say. And now he couldn’t, not even in his prayers. The words had been poised on his tongue.
Dean lifted the blankets off himself and swung his legs over the bed in one swift motion. “Then let’s go see,” he said through his teeth.
When Dean wakes the next morning, Cas is next to him. He lays on his back, hands resting on his chest. His eyes are closed, but Dean knows that if Cas is at full strength, he’s not asleep. He doesn’t move for a while, only peering at him through his eyelashes, not wanting Cas to know he’s awake. Cas hadn’t been there when he went to sleep.
Dean felt something inside of him break, and he started to cry, deep, guttural noises rattling throughout his body and out of his mouth. He tried to close his eyes, he
The lights are all off, so Dean doesn’t notice at first when Cas’ silhouette apparates into the living room. Then, he sees him, and jumps back against the door. “Jesus, Cas! Don’t do that.”
“Yes, I heard—Demon blade?”
Dean didn’t remember exactly how he’d gotten there, but there was a lake next to the graveyard, frozen over in the dead of winter. He must have wandered over, bored at the dull clang of the shovel against the ground. He put a foot forward, onto the ice. Then another, then another. He didn’t know why, but each step away from land exhilarated him, made him feel strong. He’d made four steps before he heard it.
“Dean,” Sam cuts in, sharply, “This isn’t just about you. He can
“Yeah...scared. Scared that...that this other guy that looks like me...Maybe we have a lot in common, you know?”
Dean stares for a second into Cas’ eyes, taking in his wild, serious gaze. He nods. He isn’t sure why, doesn’t know what’s come over him, but he
Cas sighs, resting a hand on Dean’s knee. “Just don’t be late like the last time. If you’d like to have the session here, I’ll leave you to it.” Cas gives Dean a pat before getting to leave.
The therapist (oh wait, it says her name at the top of the screen)—
you to know that this is not your fault.”
“Yeah, so what?”
He nods, grimacing. It’s all the confirmation he needs.
is singing. While he cooks. He tunes Sam out, listening to see if he can make out the lyrics. “...Dean?”
“Tell me the number again.” Dean feels almost naked without his gun tucked into his waistband. They couldn’t bring any weapons because of the dumb metal detectors—not that it matters. They’d have to surrender their weapons once they got to the headquarters anyway. Dean tenses. Sam better know what the hell he’s talking about.
Dean stares up at the ceiling. The fan blows cool air onto his sweat-stippled chest, which rises and falls deeply and urgently.
“It’s this, like, room where they keep records that are too sensitive to be digitized. You have to wear gloves and everything. It’s not climate-controlled like the archival room, but I’m definitely going to have to get a look in there lat—”
Dean clears his throat. “Like, do we have tabs on any?”
Sam runs the pot under the faucet and doesn’t look at Dean. “Did you sleep in your clothes?” Dean looks down. Right. He’s wearing the same shirt from yesterday, minus the pants.
“Okay, then what do we do?”
Dean stares for a moment, gaping up at Cas as he tilts his head in confusion. His pulse quickens, all of the sudden
“Great.” He sits up, the familiar feeling of adrenaline rising in his chest. “When’re we doing this thing?”
Cas stands, towering over him. “That’s what you say every other time, Dean. ‘Just for a day. One more lead. One more hunt.’” Cas’ voice falls. “You promised this time would be different.”
Jack frowned and tilted his head, and for a moment he looked just like Cas. Dean blinked, grounding himself back in the moment. He braced against the back of a chair in the map room. “It seemed very angry the last time I showed up,” he said, looking down in thought. “I’m not sure what would happen if I went back there.”
Though there’s no hint of innuendo in Cas’ voice, Dean still panics. He couldn’t...He couldn’t share a
It hasn’t even been twenty-four hours and he’s already ruining an engagement.
“My...house?” Dean tries, and the driver nods into the mirror. Sam gives him a cheeky smile and a thumbs-up, to which Dean replies, “Shut it, Man Bun.”
When Dean’s eyes opened once again, he was surprised, needless to say. Even more surprising—a certain blue-eyed angel stood over him, offering his hand. “Cas?” Dean tested. He took Cas’ hand and let himself be pulled upright.
Dean feels his phone buzz again against his leg, but he ignores it. The door opens with an audible
“I need to get to the Empty.”
Sam gives in and sets the bowl on the mantle, taking a sip from the bowl as he does. He wipes his mouth. “We gotta go to DC.”
Dean pulls the blankets off of himself and plants his feet firmly on the hardwood. He expects it to be freezing, but it’s pleasantly warm. The floors must be heated. Add that to the list of unnecessary comforts Other Dean enjoys. Despite the frivolity of it, Dean smiles.
But then, he looks up. And there’s Cas, in his trenchcoat on the bench, looking at the fucking tulips. He swallows. “Cas.”
Except...Dean doesn’t say one word of what he’s thinking, what he planned.
He feels like he wants to scream.
Dean isn’t sure how much longer Cas will have to wait.
“Are you angry?”
“Oh...Good thinking, Sammy.”

Charlie rubs a hand over Dean’s back, laughing a little. “Hey, yourself, big guy.”
It’s fine. It’s not his problem. It’s not his business either. If his doppelganger wants to marry an angel, so be it. He holds up his left hand. There’s no ring. Odd. Then, his hand goes to his neck, where he pulls a distressed leather chain out from under his pajama shirt.
too tight for his taste, and a big, black overcoat to hide all of it.
Nothing.
He ran. As fast as his legs could take him, he ran, collapsing at the figure’s side. “Cas,” he sobbed, “Cas, I found you.”
He’s been trying to go through the files on his laptop for an hour, but there’s no actual organization system. Things are just there. A search for keywords in documents does nothing, and he abandons the effort way too soon.
protecting Cas. He’s only ever been protecting himself.
As she leaves, Dean swirls the ice around in his glass before taking a swig. It burns his throat, and he relishes the feeling. He looks up and realizes that Sam’s been staring at him for the past couple of seconds, his face screwed up the way it gets when he can’t solve a problem. “What?”
The Empty gave Dean a wicked smile. “Time’s up.”
Dean looks down at his feet. “Are you going to say something?”
But then Cas pulls him into a hug, and Dean collapses into it. And it’s familiar yet foreign, natural yet forbidden. Cas strokes a hand over the nape of Dean’s neck. “I’ve got you,” Cas says.
Sure enough, a gold band dangles from it. He runs his fingers over the metal, noticing an engraving on the underside:
Cas reaches down and grabs Dean’s hand. All Dean can do is stare at the place where they connect, awe-stricken. “Are you alright?” Cas asks, his voice deepening. If Dean weren’t looking down, he bets he could see that piercing gaze he gets when he’s trying to guess how Dean’s feeling.
Dean let his eyes flutter shut. It wasn’t like he could see anymore, anyway.
. Dean averts his eyes instantly, disbelief overcoming him. His blood runs like ice through his veins.
At once, Lisa and Ben’s heads lifted to look at Dean through the glass. They looked distraught, angry. They mouthed along with the voice, contempt in their eyes.
“Well…” Dean begins, feigning concern, “Demonic possession is known to cause hallucinations.”
Dean stares at the text for what feels like forever. He puts the phone facedown on the table and finishes the rest of his drink in one go.
Sam gestures over to Castiel, who’s lounging by the fire in the living room. “You know...if you…”
Sam rolls his eyes like it should be obvious. “Finding spell.” After all of his...dry ingredients—which looked to be the bones of small animals—were in place, Sam says, “Red one.”
The chair beneath the Empty’s form disappeared, and it leaned back, letting its arms dangle behind it. Blackness poured out of each orifice of its face, oozing, shooting outwards like appendages.
“Sammy?”
“If I die, I’ll become Death.” Dean tried to read her expression, but it was somewhere between disbelief, terror, and hope. She took a breath, and her lips fell into a slight grin. “Death,” she said again, like she was testing out a new name, seeing how it felt. “Okay.”
“It doesn’t matter. Now that I’m awake, I can’t go back to sleep. You know that. And you can’t keep him here—he’s human.”
“First,” Dean said, “I gotta do something important.”
“My goodness,” the woman says when they’ve settled into the living room. She’s about mid-thirties with curly black hair that bounces when she turns her head. She’s crying, and like always, Dean’s uncomfortable. He fidgets in his chair. “When they said they would change my case priority, I didn’t think...think they would send the...Thank you so much.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The drive is long and largely silent. Dean wants to turn on some music. Hell, he almost
, the portal to the alternate universe where….well, he’s not sure he’s ready to fill in that blank yet. Cas walks in, leaving the door open for him and Sam.
“Fuck,” Dean breathes. He looks over at Sam, who’s begun mumbling the exorcism under their breath.
. Because, why not? But also because he is starting to get restless, even in this huge apartment. It’s at times like these that he envies Cas. Dean wishes he could just teleport away, too.
Cas takes a seat next to Dean on the bed. The shifting of weight on the mattress is enough to send a jolt of fear through Dean’s core. Cas feels white-hot next to him. “You’re right,” Cas says, “I just…” He turns his head and Dean’s eyes lock with Cas’. Has he ever looked into them like this before? They’re almost too bright; it must be his grace peeking through. “I don’t want to lose you.”
After dinner, Sam tries to leave. Dean grabs his arm. He’s not getting off that easy. “What was up with that? You totally hung me out to dry back there.”
I had initially planned for this to only be two parts, but I guess there was a lot more to say than anticipated. Stay tuned!

“I miss him too, Dean.”
Dean wakes up to the smell of bacon, and he rolls onto his side, startled by the way his pajamas—they’re
He gets dressed, fully disappointed with the choices in the closet. Eventually, he settles on a black button-down, some jeans that are a
try them on. The bed, he realizes, is enormous. He hadn’t really noticed in the dark, but now, with the sunlight streaming in from the glass balcony doors, he sees how empty it looks.
Another guy—with a very obvious gun in his holster—nods for them to follow him. Dean looks at Sam, who takes a breath. “Here we go,” Dean mumbles. They cross the lobby to a reinforced steel door and wait for Rodriguez, who’s wide, broad-shouldered and has at least an inch on Sam—to unlock it.
“No. Absolutely not. The Empty
Dean really wants to kill him. “Tomorrow we need to work on finding some archangel grace so we can open the rift.”
“Bill—” he tried again.
“Woahh, dude,” she says immediately, “What’s wrong?”
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he mutters. “I’m really...
“The, the piano, whatever.” Sam pulls out his phone and taps it; the music stops. Dean exhales, refocusing his eyes.
“Morning,” Sam says. Dean pours the last of the coffee into the mug and sets it down again. Sam makes a frustrated grunt and leans over to pick it up, walking it over to the sink. “You know if you leave it it’ll get crusty.”
Dean can’t really tell, but he thinks Sam’s...smiling? Dean’s phone buzzes in his pocket, and he pulls it out. He’s got a new message.
“I got it,” Cas says, emerging from the bedroom.
“Great,” she echoed.
“What do you mean?” Jack chimed. Dean almost startled at the sound. He’d crept up to the table so quietly that Dean scarcely noticed. “I thought I couldn’t get there the same way Castiel did.”
Slowly, she crept forward to meet him. “And why would I help you?”
“I’m going.” said Dean, with a crack of his neck.
, Cas. To just
“Yeah,” Sam says unenthusiastically, “Seems like it.”
“About a half hour.”
Dean squints at the screen, trying to read it. The music rattles around in his head, and he blinks, trying again. “Hey, can you turn that off?”
One million results?
Dean’s usually great in a crisis, but this one’s...different. Completely different. He almost wishes there was a monster trying to kill him; at least then he’d know what to do.  But no, now he has to complete an alternate reality heist. Dean pinches the bridge of his nose. “How do we get there?”
, he thinks desperately,
“She was—well, of course you know this—her eyes...went black.” The woman takes a moment to compose herself. “And she...she vanished. I don’t…” She looks up, her eyes locking with Dean’s. “She’s gone, isn’t she?”
. Dean’s eyes flit from Cas to Sam.“I’m not flustered.” He reaches to straighten his shirt and remembers he’s wearing a starched, white button-up. His hands fall away quickly.
“Jesus Christ, Sam. It’s not written down anywhere?”
Before Dean could think to respond, the blackness was descending on them both. He didn’t feel anything, a sort of calm, maybe. Soon, the Empty ran over his hands, up his neck, at the corners of his eyes.
“Anything. Pick one from the database. You just need a documented reason for why you checked out the demon blade. Sam says you guys haven’t used it yet. You’ll have an in to go back to the headquarters when you return it.”
, angel.” the Empty hissed.
“Right.” Sam turns his gaze back to the computer, but his fingers stay tensed above the keyboard.
“It’s no problem,” Sam says with that smile of his. He’s good at knowing what to say. “We’re happy to help. Can you tell me about the last time you saw Jade? Any details that didn’t make it into the report?”
Sam deadpans, and Dean guesses Sam’s already told him. “My secretary.”
This was...What was it?
He pulls the trigger, hitting the girl square in the shoulder.
It’s not like—he’s not some weirdo that
He sighs and turns to Castiel. “We need archangel grace for a spell. It’s...important.”
“Well,” Dean says, huffing a breath, “Where the hell is it?”
Cas stalls, head jerking to the side to see Dean in his periphery. A smile tugs at the corner of his mouth before returning to the stove, pressing the spatula against the eggs with a
“Sam can go.”
Without missing a beat, Dean leaned down and kissed Cas. It was deep and warm—Cas was so soft. With each rake of his teeth and flit of his tongue he said, again, and again,
Dean doesn’t have a response. What can he say? It’s true. It’s true, and he didn’t even do what he set out to do. He thought he would be home by now.
Dean knows Cas must be talking about something specific, something he doesn’t know about, but he pretends it’s for him. “I’ll be back soon.”
“Dean.” Sam says, his voice muffled. Dean turns away from Cas. He squints for a second, orienting himself, and realizes Sam is eating a bowl of cereal, bowl in one hand, spoon in the other—he’s shoveling his face with it.
he’s really hoping he doesn’t have to do that.
A faint smile spread across Sam’s face, that sort of triumphant look he got whenever he’d figured something out. “When you
“What song is that?” Dean asks, for no other reason than curiosity, some odd longing for Cas to turn and look at him.
Dean slips into his bedroom, and Charlie’s right behind him. So, the bathroom thing was a lie for her, too. He’s glad for it, though. She closes the door once they’re both inside, and whispers, “What’s up?”
“I think I know another way.”
, but his mouth couldn’t form the words.
“Are you—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean says, shuddering, “Warn me next time.”
“Dean!” Castiel shouted. He dove at Dean and slid towards him, enveloping him in an embrace. Like instinct, Dean wrapped his arms around Cas, tight, chin digging into his shoulder. “You have to hold on,” Cas said.
Betty held the blade up, eyeing it with wonder. Then, without another beat or a word of warning, she plunged it into her stomach. Her head fell onto the table with a

a voice reminded him. It was quiet and small. No, no. It didn’t matter. They’d get them all back. Everyone. And everyone included Cas. He returned his attention to the passage.
Dean deadpanned. “How is that going to help us?”
Eventually—Dean couldn’t estimate when—a frantic voice broke through the haze of Dean’s sorrow. “Dean? Dean!” It was Sam, looking for him. His footsteps stomped closer, closer until they stopped cold. Dean didn’t move his head to look at his brother. He just let it dangle, too heavy for his neck now.
Dean gulps, and for some reason Dr. Chen’s voice pops back into his head. “Cas, I...I just...I want—I
Sam makes that little
Happy New Year's Eve! What a year this has been. I'm glad I could finish it off by completing this fic. Thank you for your kind words on the previous chapters!
“Let the kid speak for himself,” Dean said, his words level and measured. He could be calm too.
He continues walking along the trail, marked out with embedded stones, and for a moment, he forgets why he’s there. Really, what is he
“Hey, focus. I went back to HunterCorp headquarters and they showed me the records room.” Dean hears shuffling in the background, the sounds of cabinets opening and closing. Is Sam seriously raiding his fake kitchen?
Sam’s face falls, and his hands fly to his head, checking to see if it’s true. Dean laughs. After a moment of brooding, Sam pulls a phone out of his pocket. “Let’s look ourselves up.”
He wanted to lay there until he starved, until he withered and died.
Sam finally does, and his face...it’s enough to stab Dean through the heart. “What do you want me to do, Dean? Huh? You keep saying....
Sam stops and glowers, staring ahead. “If something goes south, we could go to prison. I mean, that would fuck up everything for the...other me and you.”
Dean’s body goes cold. He steadies his hand, taking aim. “Try me, bitch.”
The sound of the door creaking open fills the room, and Sam and Dean’s bodies go rigid. They press their backs to the lockers. Dean’s hand goes to his waistband on impulse, and he winces when he grasps at air. “Goddammit,” he breathes, “Who the hell is that?”
He cleared his throat, attempting to diffuse the tension. “Right. You’re a reaper?”
“Well you’re not exploding anything this time,” Dean said. “You-you just have to find him and....and just...just wake him up. And—”
Sam obliges without question, and for a second, Dean’s caught off guard. But Sam’s right; obviously, they both need to make it look like they’ve done this all before. Dean paints on a friendly half-smile and pretends he’s bored, even though his heart is threatening to beat out of his chest. He rolls up his sleeve, baring his forearm like Sam.
No, that wasn’t true.
Dean blinks, taking a sip, pretending he didn’t burn his tongue. “What?”
“It sounds like a good plan,” Jack said with a pensive stare at the angel book, “I’ll go.”
Cas is confused at first, hesitant, but it isn’t long before he takes the lead. Without breaking their connection, he presses a hand to Dean’s chest, and Dean falls backwards onto the bed. Has Cas always been this strong?
Rodriguez reaches over and presses the five button, pausing for a moment to type on a keypad just below the floor numbers, cupping his hand around it for privacy. The code is ten numbers long. Once he’s finished, the elevator whirs and they start moving. “Arms out,” Rodriguez says, nodding at them from the corner.
“Of course you do,” Dean breathes.
“Huh,” she says, like this is confusing her, “Well, last time we spoke, it was the opposite. Is it something about being away from the action that’s making you pull away?”
“How are you?” the woman asks. Shit, what was her name? Doctor…? Nope, nothing. Well, hopefully he won’t have to address her directly. “I see you’re settling into your break nicely.”
Maybe this is the right way to do it. He’s got no idea how Other Sam and Dean swung it, but they’re saving lots of people. Or, at least, thirty-two percent of them. That’s a lot. He jiggles his knee under the table and wonders how much longer the meeting will go on.
cracks a smile. She looks down to scribble something. “So I take it that means a...healthy amount of sex?”
“No, nope I’m just...enjoying some time with Cas.”
at it?
“Hi,” he mumbles.
“I don’t know. Maybe he did, but I’m his boss, so…”
“Listen, uh...D’you—Charlie said she’s got a plan, and I…”
He looked at Cas--tearful, lovely, beautiful Cas. “I love you,” he said.
“Brian—Who the fuck’s Brian?”
“We don’t know that for sure.”
Dean rakes his hands over his face. “Don’t, Sam. Just don’t.”
He just wanted...What did he want? Why was he here?
Dean shook him. “Cas, wake up.”
Sam turned to Dean with concern. “Wait, Dean how will you get—”
. Sam points to a small, rectangular lockbox. Sure enough, it’s labeled
Dean closes the door to the apartment behind him with a click, trying not to make noise. He doesn’t know why he even tried, because the second he dares let out an exhale of relief, he hears, “Dean?” Cas’ worried tone cutting through the silence.

“Sometimes,” Dean says.
speech when a notification pops up on his screen.
“Dean?” A voice calls, and Dean perks up. He knows that voice. Sure enough, Cas rounds the corner and into the living room. His hair is tousled, and he’s barefoot, wearing a dark blue sweater and jeans. It startles Dean. His Cas—the one from his universe—only ever wears one outfit. Cas stops by the fireplace for a minute, sticking out his hands to warm himself, before coming to meet Dean in the entryway.
Dean shakes his head. “I don’t deserve your help. I don’t deserve...you.” The thought occurs to him that maybe, just a little, he’s talking to his Cas too.
Cas nods, his face blank. “How long will you be gone this time?” he asks, and
So, Dean should just ask. It’s Cas.
“Nine twenty nine!” Sam calls from across the room. Dean bounds over to meet him, a little annoyed that he couldn’t just say that before. He meets Sam at the beginning of an aisle marked
“We’re not doing anything until we get Cas back! Understand?” Sam always with his practicality, his caution. Getting Cas back
“What?” Dean stammers.
practical. “We need him. We can’t do it without him.”
Sam put a hand on Dean’s shoulder, near where Cas had touched him, and Dean recoiled, falling limply onto his side. “No!” he cried out, and it was like it was happening all over again, the blackness. He wished it would have taken him. Why couldn’t it take him too. “Don’t touch me,” he sobbed. “Don’t touch me, don’t touch me, don’t—” he repeated it, like a mantra, until it was the only thing he could think anymore.
“Dean?” Cas says, taking a few steps closer. “It wasn’t your fault either. What happened.”
” The demons hiss in pain, and the last adult vessel lunges for Dean.
“You are too, Dean.”
Dean scoffed. “I’m pretty sure, Sam. I was there.”
With his face buried in Castiel’s neck, Dean didn’t notice at first that he was back in the bunker.
“Castiel!” Jack exclaimed.
“Yes, Dean?”
When the door finally swings open, though, it’s not Sam who does it. The demons must have been expecting hunters. Dean and Sam are scarcely able to take one step before they’re thrown against the brick wall.
Cas runs a finger over Dean’s bare collarbone. “I miss you,” he says. He props himself on his elbow and looks at Dean, his face illuminated by the city’s bright nighttime lights. “I miss…” Cas cups Dean’s cheek.
“Hi, Dean,” the driver says when Dean eventually slides into the backseat.
not taking it seriously enough. Dean glares.
He closes his eyes and pretends this is where he belongs.
Dean looked at him, eyes wide. “Cas?”
“You didn’t tell me Sam was coming,” Cas says, frowning. And before Dean can utter even a syllable of explanation, Cas gathers Dean's face into his hands and presses a soft kiss to his lips. Dean’s
“S-s-sto, s-s-s!” he mocked her. “Can’t quite hear you. It’s too loud down here.”
Castiel didn’t respond immediately, and Dean wondered if Cas might be taking him in too, seeing if he was real. “It’s...complicated.”
a pair of wings.
Dean didn’t care anymore. He couldn’t see straight. He couldn’t feel anything except anger and determination.
Dean goes to the empty.
“You can’t stay,” Cas says. His face draws into a pained half-smile. “Dean,” he continues, almost to himself, “Do you think...he’ll forgive me?”
. “I’m sorry, Cas, I’ve...I’ve been such a fucking dick. You don’t deserve that.”
Sam softened. “I-I don’t know,” he sputtered. “We’d have to see.”
shelves and toward Death’s desk.
When they make it to the ground floor, it’s pretty clear that they’re in New York City, and Dean does his best to contain the visceral shudder that runs through him. All he can think about is how loud it is. Too loud, too many things trying to grab your attention—he doesn’t like it. He’d take Baby on an open, empty road over a city any day. He looks over at Sam, hoping to share a moment of mutual disgust, but he seems unfazed.
, it reads.
he thought,
Dean blinks at him, and he notices his hand begin to tremble. Castiel notices, putting his hand over Dean’s the way he had last night. “Yeah?”
Dean now stood in the hallway of a hospital, outside a room. He peered through the window and almost fell backwards, the world feeling dizzy. Inside, laying in bed, was Lisa. Ben stood beside her, leaned over with his head on her chest.
Dean looks up at Cas, heaving a sigh. Right, so if he and Cas—if they’re
His fingers pressed into Castiel’s back, hooking into the loops of his coat. He tried to fit everything he’d never said, everything he was too scared to think, into this one embrace. He pressed on, and this one kiss—this moment, felt like a lifetime to Dean.
“In the essay, it says it’s a problem with intimacy, so professionally people that aren’t his family or don’t know him well should call him they. Then there’s a whole thing about gender-neutral phrasing like, ‘sibling’ instead of ‘brother.’”
When Cas goes into the other room, Sam sits down next to him. He’s not wearing anything weird like yesterday, just a plain t-shirt and jeans. It’s almost something Sam would actually wear. “So…” Sam says, “Trouble in paradise?”
“Why would I be pissed at you?” Sam deadpans.
Dean shakes his head. “So...what? What does that mean?”
Dean’s footsteps reverberated throughout the library, filling his ear against the place’s eerie silence. He looked up, realizing that by some cruel joke, he’d ended up in the
Dean sits up, a shiver running through him. “I don’t understand.”
“Don’t use the blade unless you have to, Dean.” Sam says, his hand on the door, “We’re trying to save the vessels.”
Sam’s eyes dart over to him. “Did you say something?”
“You’re forgetting our agreement,” Castiel says, gruffly. The tone is notably different from the one he used that morning, and Dean decides he must be missing something.
Henriksen flashes a smile. “I know you will.” After that, their silent standoff lasts for several moments. Dean stares at Henriksen, refusing to be the first one to look away. “Well, let’s get you your demon blade then,” Henriksen says, breaking the tension, nodding left to the lower numbers. “If you’re in a hurry. Just—Don’t forget to do the write-up this time. ”
Taking another second to marvel, Dean unlocks the phone with a swipe. “Sam?”
After hearing nothing from Sam, Dean gets antsy. It’s well into the afternoon, and he and Cas haven’t spoken since that morning. He isn’t sure what Cas usually does to entertain himself—maybe he helps with hunts—but he seems content to sit across the living room next to the bookcase and read. It’s a fascinating sight to watch, Cas in his undoubtedly expensive loungewear, legs crossed over leather upholstery, his face drawing up in a smile every so often.
Without turning, Dean smiled. He looked into Cas’ bewildered eyes and felt anchored. “Cas comes with me,” he said, “Or I’ll keep waking up. I’ll keep coming back. I’ll never let you sleep again."
Dean straightens his jacket, and he realizes it’s some kind of tan overcoat with big, showy buttons. “I’m probably a busy guy, Sammy. I don’t have time to remember stuff.” He pauses. “Hey, did she say ‘break’? Where am I going?”
“Keep up the good work.” Dean ends the call before Henriksen has a chance to respond. He tosses his phone on the other side of the bed. “Fuckin’ feds,” he mumbles.
Cas frowns, reaching for Dean’s shoulder. “Dean, I...I just want to know how to help you. I need you to let me.”
Dean wishes he could just crawl into a hole. “Yes, but I’m…I don’t—can’t give it back.”
“Right.” Dean keeps forgetting about that. Sam’s made a lot more progress with this than Dean has. So many things have been rattling through his brain in the past two days that he has no idea where to focus his energy. He’s grateful to Sam for taking the lead this time.
Dean freezes, staring ahead. “Dean…” Sam says, “You okay?”
Dean shakes his head. He hasn’t communicated
It’s odd how immediately different he feels once inside. The whole place is green, covered in vines, plants, flowers. He starts down the path, taking in the foliage. There’s a wooden house off to the side, draped in vines. At least, it looks like a house—he doubts anyone actually lives in it—but he has an urge to see what's inside.
His hand hovers over the keyboard for a moment, before typing
Everyone...everyone. Dean didn’t speak. He couldn’t help but think he could have dealt with it. He would have if he had Cas. But as far as Dean was concerned, he already lost the whole world before he even knew. “Cas.” Dean whispered. It was so soft that he thought Sam wouldn’t hear it.
“I know,” she interjected, “Everyone. Knows.”
“Listen,” Dean says, “If you got a problem just say it.”
. You know, Sam’s been telling me all about you guys.”
“Tell me what’s wrong.”
“Tell me what? That everything’s fucked?” Dean bit, huffing an exhale. His ribs felt sore from crying.
“I guess it is.”
“Well, do we?” Cas stands, placing his book down on the seat. He tilts his head.
“Twenty six.” Dean announces. He stops in front of the door and looks to Sam.
Of course, there was no one at the desk. He turned, whipping his head around. “Hello? Anybody?” Maybe it was a dumb move, giving himself away, but he didn’t have any more patience. “Hello?” he repeated, stalking parallel to the bookcases, inspecting each aisle.
“I mean, obviously not this one.” Sam says with a nod to the living room.
He wants to ask so badly. But he shouldn’t, right? Maybe a good brother would already know. Shit.
“Uhh...that’s alright, I guess,” Dean says. What is going on?
Dean clears his throat. “I…”
“Where are you going?”
“I apologize.”
“Slow down, cowboy. It’s going to take some work. We’re going to have to make it look like it was never taken in the first place. In the meantime, though...you guys need to work a case.”
“Well, flying away was a little dramatic…” Dean starts, hoping Cas will accept it as levity. Though, he’s still not sure why this alternate Cas’ opinion means that much to him.
“I was walking past,” Cas supplies. “You’re never that passive aggressive with anyone you like.”
“Fine,” Dean glares.
, okay? I’m just scared.”
Cas reaches forward to cup Dean’s cheek in his hand. Dean shudders, but Cas is looking at him so intensely that he doesn’t think to move away. He just...looks. “I love you.” Castiel says.
That would have been kind. Kinder than, “Don’t do this.” It would have been a thank you. But Dean was selfish, and his first thought was to beg for him to stay.
to, but he couldn’t.
, and Dean almost startles. Sam seems unfazed, and he’s the first one to step through the doorway, straightening his jacket.
Dean lets out a little grunt in response as he glides through the hallway, eyes scanning the numbers above the doors. He knows he went the right way now, numbers ascending blurrily from 520, 522, 524…
After a moment, Sam returned, panting slightly. “Here.” He held up the key to Death’s library, and Dean locked eyes with the skull on its handle.
“You’re supposed to log onto your therapy session in seven minutes.” Cas says matter-of-factly, but there’s a lilt to his voice that reminds Dean of when he was little and had to convince Sammy to get in the bathtub. Shit, he’s actually going to have to go to therapy, isn’t he? It’s either that or tell the truth.
Of course they don’t. “It’s our own company.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. He guesses he’s never thought about it like that before. He thinks of something his Cas said to him once.
Thank you so, so much for reading!
“I need your help.”
Sam scoffs. “What doesn’t? Cas?”
Cas looks up and smiles, patting the space next to him on the bench. Without another thought, Dean sits, looking ahead at the tulips—yellow and red. “Still too cold for the bees,” Castiel says with a sigh, “But look at it—it’s all starting to bloom.”
“Well…not much. It looks like the public knows about supernatural creatures, but a lot of stuff must still be secret. I couldn’t find anything on angel grace, not even on the dark web. There’s some speculation about a vague...essence I guess, but nothing concrete.”
Dean clears his throat. “What?”
“Now, I know you two are very busy, but we do have some very good news to report. As you know, our educational outreach programs have led to a steady decline in demonic possession.” Her hand gestures downward with the trend of the line. “Well, after polling across demographics, we’ve found that HunterCorp’s efforts have led to a 32 percent overall decrease in possession.”
Thank you for everyone who has kept up with this story! I haven't forgotten about it, and it's very dear to me. I hope this chapter was everything you wanted. I think in the next one we'll see about Sam's PhD lol.
“Dean?”
Dean gets out of the car, gun cradled, and he laments at how much cooler this whole thing would look if he had been driving Baby. Right—he needs to focus.  The demon blade sits cool against his waist. He grabs at it.
The woman nods, shakily. “I’m sorry I don’t have anything more...helpful.”
“So, you feel guilty about what happened, about not working, and perhaps unworthy, so you pull away. Have you ever thought that without context...Castiel might think he’s done something wrong?”
“Great,” Dean gave her a wide, close-lipped smile. “You betray me, I kill you.”
“You…” Henriksen begins. He sighs. “Yes, that’s all.”
Betty regarded Dean blankly, with a slight turn of her head, like she’d almost forgotten what he was referring to. “Fine,” she sighed, “If you insist.” She lifted her hand.
“Found us a case?” Dean never thought he’d have to work a case within a case, but well, first for everything, right?
Sam groans in frustration. He puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I know you don’t have a PhD or anything, but you can’t be
“Okay,” Dean breathed, eyes on Cas, who stared back at him with an intensity he’d never felt before. Dean snaked an arm around Castiel’s waist, pulling him closer.
When Dean was twelve, his dad took him and Sam on a hunt in Vermont. It was a simple haunting—just a salt and burn. John had taken both of them to the graveyard that night, and they’d sat there while he worked—digging and digging and…
clueless.” Dean crosses his arms, brooding, and Sam changes tact. “It’s just...
Dean shifts a bit to face Sam. “What’s with the “they” stuff?”
A dream.
Dean turns and looks at him, and it’s strange. He looks so...content. It reminds Dean of when Cas first woke up from his coma, but still, it’s different. There’s more assurance, firmness to it. “I’m sorry,” Dean whispers.
. So, this is his “usual place,” huh? He pushes the gate all the way open.
Castiel tilts his head, and his look is so stony that Dean can’t read it. After what seems like an eternity of this, he speaks.“Something happened. You’re...What’s wrong?”
Castiel’s gaze panned downward, regarding him with a tilt of his head, a frown...no, a
“Do you ever feel as if you have lived many lives?” Cas is looking at the flowers again, but Dean’s eyes are on him, like he might miss something if he looks away.
Oh god, is he seeing a shrink? “It’s just for—”
“What? Oh…” Sam scratches the back of his neck. “Right, yeah...That’s just what people call me. Or, I guess...Other me?”
Dean just nods. The closeness is too much for him. Cas looks at Sam like he’s remembering that he’s there again. He leans into Dean’s ear. “We’ll talk later.” A shiver runs up Dean’s spine.
The therapist tilts her head. “You seem hesitant to agree.”
s when he saw her. He stopped cold, locking eyes with her. She sat with her knees drawn to her chest, and her eyes widened at the sight of him, her gaze darting from his blade to his face and back again. She made a frantic shuffle to get off the floor, using the bookshelves to steady her.
Dean stood up, slamming the chair against the table. He couldn’t hold it back anymore. Not even in front of Sam. He grabbed the angel book and chucked it against the wall. “Like hell you do! He
“Dean?” Sam tried again, from the doorway. It was hesitant, as if there was a threat he couldn’t yet discern. “Dean, what happened? Dean. Why didn’t you answer?” Sam’s voice sounded dull and garbled. Unreal. Nothing was real. He made no move when his brother approached him, crouching to examine him in his defeated state.
“What’s the number again?” Dean asks, gripping the suitcase. The box rattles around inside as he lurches forward, choosing a direction even though he’s not sure it’s right.”
He’d made it all the way to the
Well, Plan A’s out the window.
Before the deep, orange-red, and before the sour smell of shredded flesh—he heard her scream. She looked at him, fear in her eyes, only eighteen he somehow knew. He laughed. It disgusted him, but he laughed. Dean tore a slow, deliberate line from her shoulder to her hip.
Dean decides this makes sense, because all he can think right now is,
“Fine,” she said with a shrug. It felt a little too non-committal for Dean’s taste.
The words sound far too human to be coming from Cas’ mouth. Then Dean realizes...this is it. This is when he’s supposed to say it, before it goes on any longer. “Cas…”
Dean sees Sam mouth something like
“I think that ship has sailed.”
“Um…‘HunterCorp is a non-profit, federally contracted corporation that works in tandem with the CIA, FBI, NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, and other international security organizations to catalogue and neutralize supernatural threats.’ And it says we’re the Co-CEOs.”
Yeah.
“It was Chuck. The whole time, it was Chuck.” Sam said, massaging the space between his eyebrows. He looked like he hadn’t slept, and there was a coldness to his words, like he was on the edge of rage. Dean knew that measured tone all too well.
The Empty twitched, its head jerking to the side at un unsettling tempo. “Neither do you!” It screeched. “Three, two…”
be nice to have a rundown before every case. But he can’t get too comfortable here.
Dean’s mouth hangs open. He tries to think of what on earth he can say to that. But before he can utter a sound, the back door opens, and Sam pokes their head in.
Cas was Dean’s ending.
He’s in too deep at this point.
He stills.
“I like...I
He looked around. They stood on a road, somewhere in the middle of nowhere, at night. The sky seemed angry, flickering with clouds red and purple, stars nowhere to be seen. Dean looked to Castiel. He reached out and touched his face, cupping Cas’ cheek in his hand. “Am I dead, Cas?”
This is bad. He knows he messed up. Only, he’s not entirely sure how...or how to fix it.
He and Cas aren’t married, are they? He clicks the second option.
At that, Sam only deflates further. He shakes his head. “We don’t know who set it. And if we get the code wrong, they’ll know we tried to open it.”
“What’re you talking about?” Dean asked, but by the end of his sentence, Sam had already booked it down the hall and out of the library.
It didn’t matter to him at all what the book said.
He sits at Sam’s dining room table now, in a very whimsically decorated apartment. There’s a lot of weird, modern art on the walls that Dean can’t make sense of. The whole place is very white and clean, not anything like Other Dean’s place. Soft piano music plays throughout the house.
, if you and Other Dean have some...things in common...That’s alright with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean clears his throat, side-eyeing Cas, who’s looking at him intently. “Sammy, what’s up?”
That’s when he heard it. A sharp inhale, like a gasp. Or a sob. He quickened his pace, looking, looking, until…
. Does Cas want to watch cartoons with him? Is that the big thing he’s missing? Dean chuckles a little. “Yeah, okay. Cartoons on the TV. Any other requests?”
Dean reels, scrambling to his feet. There are three of them, all adults. But then, another figure emerges from the shadows. She looks about fourteen, but the carefree youthfulness he glimpsed in her yearbook picture is gone.
He looks up at the status bar. It is indeed 1:30. Is he really about to do this? Surely it’s not ethical, right? (Yeah if only that was his main concern.)
. “Discrepancies.” Dean repeats, flatly.
“What case?” Even though he has no idea what she’s talking about, the words still come out quick and urgent. At this point he’d take any distraction from his whole...domestic situation.
They’re at the part where Doc Holliday pulls out his gun. He twirls it and shoots Johnny Ringo before he even has a chance to react, putting the gun back into his holster in one swift, smooth motion.
“Standard protocol is exorcism…Doesn’t matter. Point is, they won’t ask questions. Brian says we go down to DC pretty often for it.”
He’s gotta go.
“Yeah well it was a shitty choice, Cas! A fucking dumb choice. It was cruel.”
The reaper grasped the bookshelf again, the confidence she’d seemingly gained slinking backwards into terror, uncertainty. Before he’d even finished, she said, “No. No. Why would you even…?”
Sam doesn’t stop. Hell, he doesn’t even look up. Dean reaches for his hand. “Dude.”
That’s...It would just be leading him on, wouldn’t it? The poor guy doesn’t know the difference between his Dean and this Dean. And, unfortunately, this Dean doesn’t...He loves Cas, just not like that.
“No, Cas. I...I can’t lose you again.” Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand.
“Look at me.” Dean says. Nothing. “Fucking...
“Dean!” Sam yelled, grabbing at Dean’s shoulder.
Sam and Jack let out yelps of surprise at the suddenness of it, but Dean didn’t so much as flinch. Instead, he lowered his head to look at hers, his focus heightened. For a few seconds, there was silence, worry, perhaps, that it hadn’t worked.
Dean isn’t sure what she means at first, but then it hits him. Geez, is it really that odd to walk around in your pajamas? “Hm, y-yeah I guess I am.” he says with a polite chuckle.
“We had a
maybe that you don’t deserve Castiel’s affection?”
“What?” Sam echoes from behind Cas.
“How are you? Is everything...okay?” He appreciates that Sam doesn’t mention it; neither does he.
, Dean thinks breathing through a shaky sigh,
For a moment, Dean does nothing. He just looks at it, in awe. Dean has almost no childhood pictures of him and Sam. Just memories. Not a lot of good ones, either. He wonders if there’s more of them in the phone and if he could print them out, take them with him back to his world. It doesn’t matter if they’re not
“Says they’ve got two grace samples...But we don’t know if they’re from archangels.”
Dean tunes her out after a few more sentences about “doubling down on efforts.” He looks around. Are they...they’re actually doing good here, aren’t they? Does everyone here know about the supernatural? He thinks about it for a minute. Does the average joe know about ghosts and iron, that demons hate salt?
Sam pauses, and Dean hears him typing, blowing a trilling breath through his lips in focus. “Uh...in a compound in DC.”
Dean shakes his head. He can’t take this anymore. “Cas, I have to—”
Dean walks into Other Dean’s apartment, opening it with the key he found in his pocket, Sam trailing behind him. It’s huge for an apartment, and Dean thinks he’s gotta be loaded. The kitchen is off to the right—some kind of rustic-modern throw-up complete with a gaudy cast iron oven. Something is cooking in a pot on the burner, and it smells fantastic.
Dean woke again in his bed, under the covers. The blankets felt heavier than usual. It seemed like Sam had piled extras on top of him. He rubbed his eyes and turned over, seeing Sam’s outline through the blurriness. He hadn’t dreamt. For once in his life, he hadn’t dreamt at all. The pang of loss hit him as he remembered.
Cas softens, letting out a breath. He shuffles over to Dean and leans over to press a kiss to the top of his head. “Just want you to be okay,” he mumbles into Dean’s hair.
“And?”
Charlie makes a noise that’s halfway between a chuckle and an
Sam stares ahead. “How often do we get to know what we’re going into beforehand?”
There was just one problem. They didn’t actually know how they would get Jack to the Empty. Or if they could at all. They sat at the wooden table, looking through books. Dean tried to make his eyes focus on some passage about angel death in
Dean remembered, and a jolt ran through him. He remembered. Cas…
Cas raises an eyebrow. “I’ve been waiting now, for hours. And you haven’t said a word. And now you’re asking me about archangels—” Though his voice rises in volume, it seems to shrink in confidence.
The attendant nods. “Right away.”
The bitterness falls away when he looks into Castiel’s eyes. He softens. “I’m just...overwhelmed, I think. A lot...going on.”
“Awake,” Dean agrees, drumming his fingers on the table. Did Cas make every meal for him? Who taught him how to cook? And how’d he get so
“What’s up?”
in the search bar. A drop-down menu appears beside his name and he frowns at it. It must be the most-searched phrases that go with his name.
After he’d said his piece, he got no more resistance. Gripping his angel blade, Dean took the key and pressed it into the brick wall of the bunker’s library. Even though it was his second time doing it, he still startled a bit when the door actually appeared. Now, all he had to do was just...open it. He glanced behind him, Jack and Sam standing helplessly across the room. Sam pressed his mouth into a line, biting something back.
emphatically. “Is that all?”
That's all. I hope it filled a hole for you; I know it did for me. This is my first Destiel fic, and I really enjoyed it. I may have to write for Dean and Cas more in the future.
Coping? With what? “Cas, I—”
Dean’s eyes narrow. “Be a what?”
“It’s Enochian,” Cas says. “It roughly translates to: The sun sits high and proud in the sky. We are not worthy.”
The screaming continued—animalistic, raw, pathetic. “Keep screaming,” he said, darkly. “Music to my ears.”
He has to admit it—she’s right. He
Dean whips his head around.
Henriksen forces a laugh. “Normally, yes. But we noticed some discrepancies between the report and the witness interviews…”
? What on Earth would Sam even be a doctor of? God, now he’s going to go and get a big head about a PhD he didn’t even earn.
Thankfully, Sam and Dean are able to ride the elevator back to the first floor without need for a lengthy string of numbers. Dean turns the blade over in his hand and runs his fingers over the engravings, the ridges of serrated metal. He thinks for a moment that he’d like to stab Henriksen with it. Maybe it’d get rid of that smug look on his face. “Who does that guy think he is, talking to us like that?”
Dean sits across the table from Sam, drumming his fingers on it, his eyes locked on the blurry landscape running past the window. The train rattles underneath him, and he pulls at the collar of his dress shirt. He feels hot. “Dude.” Sam says, “Relax.”
“I love you, too.”
“What?”
“Dean…” Dr. Chen says, drawing his name out. She puts her pen down and rubs at her chin. “Would you say...do you
Hi everyone! I hope you're enjoying reading so far! I've loved reading all your comments! I will continue to post chapters once a week--maybe sooner if I'm feeling wild ;)--so stay tuned.
“How far out are we?”
It takes Dean several seconds to realize that Cas, seemingly intentionally, referred to Sam as “them,” but he doesn’t have time to react before Sam’s voice comes over the phone.
For a rich guy, Dean figured Other Dean would have some gaudy apartment that took up an entire street block. And it’s certainly big—like, scream-and-there’d-be-an-echo big, there’s no denying that, but it’s also cozy. It’s not a bright, clean white like the inside of the HunterCorp building. It’s muted, calming—deep browns and greens—a buffer to the busy world outside the windows.
“Help with what?”
“Trust me,” Sam grits, “I’d have seen it.”
“Yeah, so?” Okay, Dean takes it back. The staring is a
Cas folds his arms over his chest. “They’re a grown adult. They can go to the headquarters alone.”
—slide on his skin. Usually, he just sleeps in his briefs and a t-shirt, but he couldn’t
“That so?” Dean’s not in the mood for this. If this dude had anything substantial, he wouldn’t be fishing for more details.
He looks around, not seeing much except lined brownstone houses, people power walking to wherever it is they need to be, the sounds of dogs barking from no discernible location.
It’s gonna be fine.
“Yeah...yeah. Never mind.” Sam pulls out his laptop and averts his eyes, trying to hide his head behind the screen.
about that stuff? Openly?
a second chance to protect them. And he failed.
Then, there’s the sound of the door opening, a crisp, “Hello,” from Cas.
Sam gapes, eyes wide. This Cas is...authoritative. It reminds Dean of how his Cas was when they first met. Sam shakes his head no.
A woman in a pantsuit stands in front of a projection screen that pictures a line graph, the words HunterCorp printed boldly at the top. What? “So, Mr. Winchester,” the woman says with a nod to Dean. Then, to Sam, “Dr. Winchester.” Dean and Sam share a look of confusion for a second, but Sam settles back into his chair, eyebrows raised.
Dean picks up the chant where Sam left off. “
He leaves without another word.
headquarters.”
Dean nods, moving his hand away. “Copy.”
“Fine, but we’ll come back to this later. I’ve been working with Sam on this whole passcode thing.”
“Yeah?” Sam says, shifting his eyes back and forth from Dean to the keypad.
. “You’re radiating major sad boy vibes through the phone. What happened?”
Sam looked up, sighing. “It means we can’t do a spell to get there.”
Dean had told Cas that he was going to spend some time with Sam, to which Cas replied, “Okay, Dean,” with a sort of extinguished sigh.
In a swift motion, barely a few seconds, Sam whips out their gun and shoots two demons, stopping them where they stand. Sam gasps as the hold is freed on their throat, but Jade’s demon slams them back against the wall. He turns almost purple, nose bleeding.
“Well, I’m at your apartment, and you’re not here.”
Cas looks at him, a little smile in his eyes. “Of course.”
Dean hears a faint voice from the kitchen. Someone’s singing. No,
The reaper’s eyebrows raised. “And what would that be?”
Dean grunts, looking between Sam and the demon. Sam looks as if he’s about to pass out. He’s got to make a decision. “You wouldn’t hurt this poor little girl, would you?” the demon says in a sing-songy voice.
With a nervous chuckle, Dean looks down to his plate. He picks up his fork and shovels a bite of eggs in his mouth. “No work. Got it,” he says, refusing to meet Cas’ eyes again.
For the next five days, Cas avoids Dean. It’s like it’s a test, and he’s failing; he isn’t sure he wants to pass. Cas doesn’t sleep next to him in the bed. He doesn’t initiate any touches. His speech still softens, the way Dean supposes it would when talking to a partner, which makes Dean think maybe Cas isn’t mad. Maybe he’s...waiting.
The car pulls up to an unassuming street block, and it looks quaint, save for the garbage bins toppled over on the curb. “Have a nice stroll, Mr. Winchester.”
(See the end of the chapter for
when there’s a knock at the door.
They’re well into
It’s mid-afternoon when they pull into town, and by then the road has become a secondary character to the thoughts racing through his mind. He’s never gone so long without music. He needs sound. Sam’s on his phone, looking over the case details for the millionth time.
It’s not fair.
“It’s like you haven’t been listening to Dr. Chen. You use work to
“What I mean is that I don’t know. We’re asleep. I hoped that if I held onto you, our dreams would merge. It seems I was right.”
Dean side-eyes Cas, who’s watching him, head propped up by his hand. Dean tenses. Is he going to try and kiss him? Touch him? “You’re quiet,” Cas says softly. “How was your day?”
Dean startles a second time when Cas appears inches from his face. Now, he can really see Cas, and he’s backlit by the moonlight streaming in from the windows. “Cas,” Dean breathes.
thought, before he can even register what’s happening, is that it’s nice, warm. But then, he realizes, and he turns his head away, breaking the already-chaste kiss.
stuff. He’s got that weird radio antenna in his head, doesn’t he?
She scoffed, standing upright. She dusted off the knees of her pants. “How would I know that?”
“I have a plan. Just...get back here soon.”
“Yes,
—all you want is to go back home. Get things back to how they were. What if I don’t want things back the way they were?”
“Well, after I heard a few people call me that, I looked myself up on Twitter—”
“They don’t need you,” Castiel says, stealing the words right from Dean’s mouth. He turns to Sam. “Do you need him to go with you?”
do anything stupid.”
“Whatever,” Dean says. His brain’s too wrung out to think of a better reply.
Wow. I hope this was worth the wait. I'm excited that the story is picking up momentum! Sorry for the wonky schedule :0, I just moved, so things have been hectic. Chapters should come out every 7-12 days. I thank you immensely for your patience and for your lovely, lovely comments and support.
But as they get farther from the epicenter of the city, the rattle of the car turns to a gentle rumble, and it lulls Dean into a relaxation he hasn’t felt in a long time. He realizes he’s been clenching his jaw, his hands curled up into fists. He lets them go, leaning his head against the window.
“You know where it is, right?”
“So...then we do it the way Cas did it. To talk to Ruby.”
*THIS GUIDE IS INTENDED AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE.
“Sorry.”
Dean thinks for a moment that it’s weird Sam hasn’t called, but then he guesses they only just spoke this morning. The thing is, he knows he needs to be doing what he does—
“What do you mean? Is it, like, a big thing?”
He watched himself...
“Listen, I’m just here for Cas.”
, until her skin was more red than brown, more oozing and stripped than taut and youthful.
“But then, you’re so similar. Dean and I...We got into a fight about him working too much. We...we weren’t talking. He lost someone, then blamed himself. And buried it.” Cas tilts his head. “You’ve buried a lot, haven’t you?”
Castiel looks up, bemused. He puts his book down. “A twenty?”
“I—“ Dean started. But Cas wasn’t there anymore. He looked down, and realized
Cas puts a hand on Dean’s chest and pushes him back against the door with a gentle force. Dean lets it happen; he’s cornered. Cas reaches up to cup Dean’s cheek, tilting his head so their eyes meet. There’s nowhere to hide. “I touch you, you pull away,” Cas whispers, a hint of a growl in his throat. “I call out to you, I’m ignored.”
“You’re still pretending to be his fiancee?”
“Dean…” came Sam’s voice again. It sounded hoarse and ragged, like he might be crying too. “Dean, where’s Cas?”
He stands, jumping when a hand rests on his shoulder. He whips around to see a young woman in a suit. An intern? Her hair is slicked back into a ponytail and she holds out a tablet for Dean to see. Dean looks from it to the intern, frowning. “Hi, Mr. Winchester. Here are the notes for this meeting,” she zooms in so Dean can see better. There’s a lot of big headings, asterisks, and different colors. He squints at it. “So, at the top, I’ve listed all of the topics we went over today. Then,” she scrolls with her finger, “Under each heading I’ve condensed the info into three bullets: new data, implications, and objective.” Dean blinks, unsure of exactly what all that means, though the intern’s eager smile doesn’t dim. “I already emailed it to you, but I wanted to ask if you wanted it printed or not before you go.”
Right. They’re famous. Dean keeps forgetting.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “Let’s get outta here.”
Great. He doesn’t need another reminder about

James Novak? Right, so people don’t know Cas is an angel. That makes sense.
is what he wants to say. How could he? “I don’t...I don’t know,” Dean manages.
“Alright, egghead, get to the point.”
. Cas is just...Cas is my friend.”
, he reminds himself,
“What?”
Castiel reaches for Dean’s hand and brings it up to his chest, cradling it. He pulls Dean close. It’s...intimate, and Dean thinks he should pull away. Just on principle, right? He’s here under false pretenses. But he does nothing. Cas’ hands are warm, and the rough pad of his thumb caresses the back of Dean’s hand. He brings Dean’s hand up to his mouth and kisses it, tenderly.
on his own? It doesn’t seem right to be taking up so much...space. Did he have someone to wipe his ass for him too?
Does Sam know about this?
“Hey,
Dean shook his head. “We could try. You said it yourself that he’s strong. He could handle it.”
Everything will work itself out, he tells himself.
Dean slinks into the kitchen, wobbling a bit, nose guiding him to the breakfast bar. He sits with a heavy
The ride is bumpy, accompanied by more than a few abrupt stops, the driver—Dean should really learn his name—cursing under his breath to the backdrop of horns blaring. Dean’s stomach churns at the thought of maneuvering Baby through this hellhole.
“No, it’s…” Dean reaches out on the bench into the space between them. “I’m sorry.” Really, all of this was because of him, one way or another. He feels like a liar. Well, he
“Cas.”
, so Sam’s pronouns are he/they and he identifies as non-binary. He wrote a whole essay about it. It was really thought provoking…”
Dean felt it again. That pang, like a knife in his chest, carving at his insides. “You don’t get it. We take out God? Fine. Everything back to normal. You get Eileen back. And Cas? Cas stays dead. Team Free Will...that dream...It ain’t nothing without him.”
that he’d ever admit it. “So, I’ve been doing a lot of research. About us, HunterCorp.”
Whatever differences there might be between this Cas and the one back home, they’re both profound. “What’s the plan for today?”
, well he probably knows everything Other Dean knows, right? Trust, effective communication, and all that. And on top of that, he’s an angel; he just
Cas looks down a moment. Then, he blinks away, the gentle whoosh of his wings echoing in Dean’s ears.
“Would think you got that thing memorized by now,” Dean says, trying to fill the silence.
He’ll never get to do this again.
all of us. It almost would have gotten me… It doesn’t like being awake. It gets volatile. Angry.”
“You—” Dean starts, but then he stalls, taking in Cas’ playfulness, and he doesn’t know how to end the sentence.
. “No, I just…” He takes a breath. “I’m just...I’m disappointing him. I can’t give him what he wants.” He feels heavier once he says it, and he knows it’s probably the most honest thing he’s said since he got here.
“The what?”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Sam says, turning his head to face the window.
—and sets his badge on the counter. Sam does the same. The man behind the desk takes the badges and scans them, his face expressionless. Dean taps his thumb on the counter impatiently.
She rubs a hand over his back. “Yeah,” she says, the lilt in her voice calm and sure, “Yeah I do.”
“Uhh…” Dean begins. He looks to Sam, who only shakes his head.
“Whatever,” Dean says, “Tomato, tomahto. Still a dick. This is
Sam looks up. “I think it means...we have a lot of connections.”
“How did you find out all this stuff so quick?”
Dean looks down. It’s weird not to be suited up to talk to the witness. What, is he just supposed to...be himself? He takes a minute longer to get out of the car, letting Sam get a start towards the door.
Henriksen.
Dean takes a steadying breath. “Yeah, okay. Got it.”
Dean shot a look at Sam, whose mouth was pressed into a disapproving line. “It’s settled, then. Cas, here we come.”
Charlie gasps next to him, elbowing Sam, who laughs. She pours herself another glass of wine.
Dean shrugged. “You’d be dead by now.” He paused. “I’m—”
Sam gets up and starts wringing his hands. He walks over to the window, facing away from Dean. “So, there’s something I didn’t tell you. I didn’t want to say in front of Cas.”
, hissed that voice again,
Dean couldn’t say that he didn’t know how Cas felt. He did. In that place in his soul where he buried things deep, Dean knew. It was easier to believe that Cas, an angel, couldn’t love someone like him. Then he wouldn’t have to entertain the idea that, maybe….
“Billie is...dead?” The reaper, who’d introduced herself as Betty, sat across from Dean at the bunker’s wood table. She stared ahead, gears turning.
, not with Cas right next to him,
Dean sighed. Even at the end of existence, Sammy still couldn’t find it in him to get to the goddamned point. “Yeah?”
doesn’t want to.
Sam points to the room number. “That’s where we need to go.”
The Empty stopped twitching, seemingly intrigued. “Castiel? No, that angel and I have a deal. And no one seems to keep up their end of the bargain these days. You can’t have him.”
It tingles.
“I, uh…” Dean averts his eyes. He digs his fingernails into his palms. “Going to Sam’s.”
“What, like experiments?”
Dean shook his head. “No, Sam. I can handle it. I can handle a reaper. You stay here with Jack.” What if something were to happen to the both of them? At least, Dean thought, if he died, he’d die knowing he did everything he could for Cas.
Cas heals every one of them, and Dean feels like shit.
She crossed her arms. “Why are you here?”
“You think so?” he asks. Dread settles in the pit of his stomach.
Sam’s already awake when Dean stumbles into the kitchen.  Maybe he couldn’t sleep either? He’s dressed, but Sam’s never gone hunting in an outfit like this. He’s wearing all black down to the boots with a tight, long sleeve shirt and weird zipper pockets down his pant legs. Dean squints against the light, taking him in before a beeline for the coffee pot. He leans over the counter, opening all the cabinets until he finds the one with the mugs in it. Sam leans against the stove, watching.
Dean’s still brooding from the fifty five minutes of talking about his feelings when he gets a call. He’s expecting, well,
“You ready to go?” they ask.
Sorry for the wait for this one. Happy Valentine's Day :) <3
“And?”
, he thought,
him, alright? I’m not like the other me. He’s not me.”
Sam and Dean share a look, and Sam signals with his eyes for Dean to take a peek. They hear footsteps now, and the sound nears. Dean sidles up to the edge of the 900 row and pokes his head out just enough to peer around the edge. Nothing.
Sam crossed in front of Jack. “And what, Dean? We still don’t have a plan for how to take out Chuck—”
“Should we pause it?” Cas asks, frowning.
Dean lets Sam return Jade home. He doesn’t want to deal with the emotions—he
“The what?” Cas tilts his head at Dean, frowning, and Dean wonders if his counterpart would’ve left Sam on speaker.
Dean shared a look with Sam before turning back to Betty. “So…?”
That’s vague enough, right?
Then came a voice, clear and deep and utterly unmistakable, “You’ll never get back to sleep if you do that.”
“Uhh...Just the one.”
“Alright, I gotta go.
Yes, Dean
“Seems that way,” Dean agrees, a bit
Dean jumps a little at the sound and straightens himself against the back of the couch. He props the laptop up properly on his lap. “H-h…” He clears his throat. “Hi.” Suddenly, Dean can feel his heartbeat in his throat. Does he really, actually want to do this?
Sam sighs. “Yeah. Sure, Dean.”
Dean shrugs away from his brother. “Jesus, Sammy.
“The demon blade. Why in the hell do we have to ask permission to use the demon blade?” God, Dean hates feds. Too much fucking protocol. In the time it takes them to file their precious forms, Dean could already have himself back home.
“At all?”
“It was Billie. She betrayed you.”
“Is Castiel affectionate with you?”
“Yeah, I know…See where it says—here under the sample number. ‘Dash A.’”
Dean groans. “You’re on Twitter? Gross.”
They better find that grace soon.
Dean squinted through the rush of pale light, proceeding with caution into the bookcases. He recalled the first time he’d come here, his death wish, lamenting about being unable to save everyone. He still felt that guilt. What was he for if he couldn’t save the people who needed him? Now, here he was again, and not much had changed. It was worse, worse than he could’ve ever imagined. Those people? Cas, his mom—hell, the whole goddamn world—he’d
“Right…” Dean wrings his hands together, eyes trained on the keypad. “Why don’t we try something we’d set it as?”
It’s a long while before Sam answers. He just crosses his arms and turns his head to the side. Dean has almost forgotten what he said in the first place when Sam pushes a quiet, defiant, “No,” through his teeth.
that?” Dean asks, looking up. Sam pulls out his computer and shrugs.
Dean’s stomach dropped at the name. “What are you talking about, Sammy?”
They break the hug, and Dean steps back to take her in. She’s wearing a pastel pink pantsuit, and it’s incredibly elegant. A HunterCorp lanyard—which predictably names her as Head of IT—dangles from her neck, She waves a bottle of wine. “I got the overpriced stuff.” She winks. “Don’t worry, you can reimburse me later.”
section. He veered over to the side, running his fingers over the tops of the books. They weren’t stacked as high as before, and he felt a desperate desire to know which one would be his. There weren’t as many, but there were still a lot. He tried to take a breath.
It raised a hand at him, and he felt his throat close. He gasped, taking in what little air he could.
“She made Jack into a bomb and sent him here. She didn’t care about you getting to sleep.”
Dean looks down, startled. He hands Sam the suspiciously-unlabeled red vial, then the brown, and—
“What do you mean, it’s complicated?”
But for Dean, it is. He still can’t fully wrap his head around it. He would get over it—he wants to, but it makes him...think too hard. He doesn’t like it.
“Uh…” Sam darts his head back and forth, starting down one of the aisles. Dean deadpans, watching.
. Dean’s laying there, sprawled out on his stomach, half of his face buried into the pillow—it’s that soft, feathery kind that your head sinks right into—and he’s not wearing anything except for his underwear. Dean’s not sure about Cas, but he can see his bare shoulders sticking out from under the comforter, so he assumes the same for him.
Instead, he leans forward and kisses Cas, and it’s the best confession Dean’s ever made.
. He glanced over at Sam, who’d cracked open another book, but Dean could tell when he was invested, and he wasn’t. He was distracted. Paying half-attention.
“You know…”
Dean and Cas come together, finally.
Dean gaped at Cas. He looked at peace, like he’d accepted his fate long ago. And he’d been so sure of it that he bet his life on it.
“If I what?”
In his last moments of consciousness, Dean thought only,
How much of what happened in his universe happened here? Did Cas raise his Dean from hell? Did he lose his grace and become human?
Jack and Sam sat on either side of him, and for a moment, neither spoke, waiting for Betty’s answer with bated breath. Finally, Sam said, “If you’re the only reaper left…” Sam began.
The two of them pull up in front of a small, white house with the shutters drawn. Sam double-checks the number. “This is it.”
“Do you want me to?” comes Cas’ soft reply. Dean doesn’t know.
Without hesitation, Dean digs in. Cas made pot roast, and he tries to get a bit of carrot, potato and meat all into the first bite. He moans in approval, and Cas grins. “You said you liked the way I made it last time, so I repeated the recipe exactly. It’s to your liking?”
Sam shrugs. “Some of it’s public knowledge, so I could just look it up. Also, turns out I have a secretary? So I just asked him the rest.”
“Yeah. Or like, tomorrow. The headquarters there has the, uh,” Sam looks from Cas to Dean. “The stuff.”
“Alright, well that’s a lot of sass for someone who was afraid for their life two seconds ago.”
’s familiar. Sure enough, when Dean turns his head, Henriksen is standing at the end of the row. Sam and Dean peel themselves from the keypads to face him.
Does Henriksen know Cas is an angel? Dean thinks back to those engagement articles he read. How screwed would Other Dean be if people found out? “He doesn’t know anything.”
Dean looked around again. A clap of thunder shook the ground beneath him. “What’s going on?”
“Five twenty six,” Sam says, trailing after him.
“Where you go, I will follow,” Cas says. He reaches around Dean’s torso to hug him from behind, his head resting in the crook of Dean’s neck.
She ruffles a hand through his hair. “Get it together, Champ.”
It’s the phone from inside his pocket. He pulls it out, and of course:
Other Dean’s ringtone cuts through the noise in Dean’s head. He puts the screen to his face.
. You’re all...flustered. It’s cute.”
“Sammy, I think you’re underestimating the douchery of the federal government.” Dean says, rubbing a hand over his face. “Alright, keep me posted.”
“I’m not—” He’s
one. But what is he supposed to do? Tell the truth?
noise he makes when he’s annoyed and turns his head at Dean. “How’s Cas?”
to flit him around the city.
When Dean finally reaches not-his apartment door again, he realizes it’s become almost familiar in the past few days.
Then, through the haze of his pain, he regained control. Just for a moment. He let out a strangled breath, an agonized howl before, “Cas! Castiel!”
At least Other Dean isn’t perfect? Maybe it’s not all his fault. Either way, he made it worse. “Cas…” he tries.
After an hour of sulking about his inability to recognize the nuances of Other Dean’s union, Dean
Sam and Dean stomp into the entryway to meet her, confused and excited. Dean immediately wraps her into a tight hug. He knows she’s a different Charlie, but already there’s something so familiar about her. “Hey, kiddo,” he says.
And an unmistakable, “‘Sup, bitches!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He hasn’t heard much from Sam either.
“Look,” Sam reasoned, “If we can find one reaper still alive, then we have Death. And if we have Death, then we have our way into the Empty
Cas blinks. He turns to Dean. “What stuff?” he asks, the amusement his voice had carried before traded for confusion. Sam opens his mouth, then closes it, backing up to lean against the stone of the fireplace. “Dean?”
Charlie.
“Dude.”
“First you gotta agree.”
Dean and Sam start walking.
When he’s done, the elevator dings. Dean pulls down his sleeve and straightens his suit jacket.
. Dean wouldn’t hear it anyway. He pushed forward on the door.
Maybe if Cas had slept here, he wouldn’t have noticed.
“The victims were, thankfully, unharmed...yet they remember being wounded prior to regaining consciousness.”
“How are your nightmares?”
Cas rests his forehead against Dean’s. “I think, maybe...maybe he—the other me—he must miss you too.”
Sam shakes his head, eyes meeting Dean’s again. “Scared?”
“Well...maybe not for us? I mean, it’s our company, right?”
Sucking in a breath, Dean moves his cursor over the notification and clicks. A link pops up for the session, and follows it, doing a little side-eye around the room to make sure Cas really isn’t lurking somewhere as the telehealth site loads.
Charlie eyes him, taking another final gulp from her glass. She hums in agreement. “You know what?” she says, “Me too. Nature calls.”
Curing a vamp that's fed? Now, that is definitely something Dean has to see. He considers asking Sam to elaborate, but he figures he should be most worried about getting home. He tries to make a mental note to ask him about it later, though. “Anything on archangel grace?”
to Castiel. And at this point, he’d like to keep it that way.
, Sammy.”
. “Awake?” he asks, with a soft lilt. Dean searches for disappointment, displeasure, but he can’t find any.
“Fine,” it said, lowering its arm, “Explain yourself. You have ten seconds.” Dean gasped and coughed, heaving the air back into his lungs. “Nine, eight…”
“You’re pissed at me.”
the other Sam.” Sam says, his words becoming more sure. “I’m like...them.” They look up, waiting for Dean’s reaction.
There’s a thunderstorm the next morning. Dean hasn’t slept. Not for lack of trying, either. He checks his phone. 6:32 am, nothing from Cas, and he isn’t sure whether to feel bad or grateful. He rolls out of bed, rubbing at his neck. The pillows were too stiff.
