“You’re drunk.”
“Course not – upstanding military gent, in my opinion.” John tickled Rosie, eliciting a stream of loud giggles. Sherlock
Phew! I hate that I missed a week, but better late than never. I really wanted this chapter to get dirty, but it takes a lot of story space to set up the next "episode". Maybe I'll get two chapters this week...
"The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street."
“I reckon you’re the most lovely non-criminal he’s drawn in quite some time.” John pressed a kiss to the side of her head before turning to Lestrade. “How’s the interview going?”

need this evidence!”
“Yes,” Sherlock concurred. “I remember a nearly-identical tattoo on a different woman who also had her throat cut about a year ago, but I chalked it up to the bizarre need that young people feel to be ‘unique’.” He pointed down at the tattoo under John’s thumb and continued, “But they have different numbers – the first girl’s ended in ‘zero-nine’. This one is ends in ‘two-one’.”
“Jesus…” John bared his teeth in frustration and rolled his eyes toward the heavens. He stepped back toward the stairs and said over his shoulder, “I thought you were difficult before you were jealous‒”
"No, I'm not."
Maybe they didn’t have to go
John swallowed his laughter and said, “Harry and me don’t get on. Never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they’re getting a divorce. Harry… is a drinker.”
“God! You are an incomparable dick!” John bellowed, his hands flailing with bare-restrained anger.
, but handed the little girl over into Sherlock’s willing arms. “I’ll be up before long to give you kisses, Rosie-girl.” With that, he turned to Mrs. Hudson and began softly shaking her shoulder.
John would come to several interesting conclusions during the course of this experiment, the first of which was this: Sherlock was
“But if you
“Very observant of you,” Sherlock admitted reluctantly, lowering his finger. “Continue.”
"Jesus, Sherlock," John slurred as he swiftly shucked his jumper. He pressed his trousers down around his thighs and took a handful of lotion for himself. Wrapping a hand around his erection, John's head lolled back at the sensation, the anticipation. He forced his gaze back to Sherlock and choked out a grunt when he saw that he had added a third finger.
“Hello, brother,” Sherlock slurred. He felt a placid smile roll over his face, but Mycroft did not return it.
Later that evening, when Sherlock was spread out on the sofa in his classic thinking pose - head barely propped up, fingers steepled under his chin, lips pursed - John decided to test Sherlock's liking of David Bowie again. On a low volume, he queued up
Lestrade shook his head and sighed, resigned to accept John’s presence, and asked Sherlock, “So? Have you got anything?”
“Well…” John gave Sherlock an uncomprehending look, “of course I did.” Sherlock took another step forward until his shins were brushing John’s knees.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock's voice drew him out of his reverie.
Sherlock moaned and strained against the confines of the drivers seat, stretching his long legs as far as he could and flexing his hips. There wasn’t enough room for Sherlock to spread his thighs like he so clearly wanted, no room for John to dance his fingers back against his perineum and press into his tight hole. John reached back as far as he could, rolling Sherlock’s balls in his palm as his other hand worked furiously on his shaft. Sherlock looked absolutely  gorgeous, chest heaving against his silk dress shirt, tongue flicking out to wet his dry lips, cheeks flushed with arousal. John’s hips twitched at the decadent sight before him.
“Never better, John! Never better!”
"I danced with another man, Captain." Anyone else would likely have looked contrite, but Sherlock looked smug. His eyes were dark and heavy-lidded and the corner of his full mouth twitched minutely with a suppressed grin. He enjoyed being controlled by John as much as John loved having this self-important bastard on his knees. And he knew what his voice did to John - it sent shivers over his whole body and made John want to fuck him into the carpet without any preamble.
“I’ll stop patronizing you when you stop acting like a child.” Securing the bandage, John replaced Sherlock’s sock and shoe. Holding the long foot against his thigh as he tied Sherlock’s shoe reminded him so strongly of Rosie that he smiled a little wistfully. She was just moving into laced shoes and he and Sherlock had argued at length about the validity of the “bunny ears” method.
“Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you’d go deeper.” Sherlock gave John a
“Sherlock Holmes ‒ who are you?” he demanded.
“Jesus, John, why not?” He flung his hands up and said with exasperation, “You’ve never exactly had a problem before.”
the danger and the adventure Sherlock offered him. But Sherlock knew, didn’t he? He’d always seen John as so good, so strong, so kind. And Sherlock
Blood drains from Sherlock's already pale face. Eyes wide, he lets out a harsh breath and rubs his hands over his face. "That," he rasps. "Is a very big question. I think it's worth at least, hm—" He tilts his head, looking thoughtfully at John. "—three more questions."
I wanted to cry, falling deeper into the swirling conundrum of my wants, needs, fears, desires, over and over,
The last time he'd seen Audrey, they'd slept together. Afterwards, he'd stood in the shower for thirty minutes sobbing like a child who has discovered for the first time what it means to be betrayed. Except
Mycroft and Will sit in facing chairs in front of a hearth twice the size of the one in the Baker Street flat. The fire burns pale orange hot and occasionally John can hear the snap of exploding sap over the sound of conversation. The walls on either side of the fireplace are bookshelves that reach all the way to the ceiling. One of those fancy ladders found only in a gentleman's library is pushed in the far right corner.

Thompson’s jaw clenched – he was on the right track.
“Inventory? They’re people, not iPhones, Sherlock.”
“And she left you her calling card?” Glancing down, Sherlock saw the woman’s name and address printed on the paper in John’s hand.
“Yeah,” Lestrade said, pulling a notebook from his pocket and reading out details. “Deceased is one Thomas Crewe, forty-seven. Arrived here last night with his co-worker, Frank Dodds, around midnight. Sometime around two AM, Dodds saw Crewe pass out, but thought it was from drink. Which was odd, because he’d only had one glass of whiskey to Dodds’ three. But, you know, high-stress job, exhaustion ‒ he just wrote it off.”
That gave John a moment’s pause. “Brother?” He’d never said anything about a brother.
“That’s none of your business.” Sherlock clipped his tone and the gunman flinched. “Your name?”
“Actually, it’s a bit late for me. I think I’ll skip this one ‒ head home and get ready for this evening. I’ll eat with Miss Sawyer.” With an annoying amount of casual companionability, John clapped Sherlock on the shoulder and said by way of goodbye, “I’ll see you back at the flat later.”
“No, Sherlock, you didn’t think. You
“Jesus…” Lestrade uttered. John ignored him.
They would be fine.
“We’ll have a grand time,” Molly said, lifting Rosie into her arms. “You two be safe.” John nodded and stepped back out onto the stoop. As she closed the door behind her, Molly said to Rosie, “How would you like to bake sugar cookie corpses?”
“He fell?” Lestrade turned to John with poorly-disguised amusement on his face.
I immediately want a t-shirt that says "Crime solving is my cardio."
“And they were together all the time?” asked Sherlock.

“Pfft.”
!" John was disgusted. Outright affronted. He rolled his eyes and pulled his phone from his pocket with some difficulty, it seeming to have become very attached to the lining. "How can you be so smart and so dumb all at once?"
“It was on that ‒ that card with your photograph on it in your billfold,” John replied. “January sixth, nineteen-hundred and seventy-seven.”
"That's the one."
“The sketch artist draws crim-nals!” Rosie continued excitedly. “Except me - he draws crim-nals and me.”
“Approximately thirty years of age, training as a midwife at a later-than-usual age due to some dissatisfaction with her previous employment. Likely as a governess, given the limited options for women these days. Family in possession of decent money, though she is reluctant to take much, preferring to support herself. One sister, married, with children. Not sure how many, but at least two. Perhaps she chose to enter midwifery after her sister lost a child. Unclear. I have only glimpsed her from several feet away.” Sherlock caught his breath and met John with a raised eyebrow and a level gaze.
“You lie, Mycroft.”
He had mixed them up for a while - Victor and Redbeard. But after months of trying to suss out what was real and in what order it had happened, he was beginning to put the pieces back together. With no help from Mycroft, of course. Mostly because Sherlock refused to ask him for help.
"Ugh -
John was drunk.
"But you don't play the guitar," Sherlock's tone was genuinely confused.
His voice checked off as Sherlock grabbed his hips and pulled him roughly down onto his throbbing cock. John wanted so badly to spread his legs, to lean forward on his hands and knees and rut back against Sherlock. But as the sting from the rough entry subsided and Sherlock began to thrust upward into him, John’s eyes rolled backward at the incredibly tight sensation. God, it was already amazing.
Please, please, PLEASE forgive the incredible lateness of this chapter. For those of you keeping up, not only with this story (thanks for that, by the way), but with the saga of my personal life, you may remember that I was trying for a job a couple of months ago. Well, I got it! I've just started as a school teacher and things have been beyond hectic. I'm teaching 6th grade English literature and while I absolutely adore it, it hasn't left me a lot of time for writing lately. But now that I've started to settle into a routine, I'm hoping that will change and I can get back on some sort of regular update pattern with Fallen Through Time. And maybe even a few of my other WIPs.
“Rather brazen of her,” Sherlock said distastefully.
“You’re not.” Despite his words, Sherlock’s tone was soft and John smiled.
"Yes! Yes, Captain, I need to be taught a lesson." Sherlock licked his lips and his hips twitched violently forward.
“And your leg? It doesn’t always hurt, does it?”
He placed one hand on Sherlock's shoulder and, desperate for John's touch, Sherlock withdrew his fingers and gripped John's hip painfully tight. Without any further preamble, John pressed his cock slowly into Sherlock's plump arse and felt an intense shiver at the rich groan Sherlock let out.
After quite possibly the longest moment that ever was, Sherlock lifted Rosie from her chair, placed her on the floor, and gave her rump a little pat. “Rosie, why don’t you see if Mrs. Hudson has any of those biscuits you like?” She shot John a confused look before nodding to Sherlock and toddling off toward the hallway. Sherlock watched her go carefully down the stairs and into Mrs. Hudson’s flat before turning slowly back to John. Again, John felt that betraying sense of anger bubble up in his chest – all of a sudden, Sherlock was a responsible parent? Without having changed any of the terrible infant nappies or waking up at all hours before she got on a regular feeding schedule? Without taking her to the clinic that time she had the croup or icing her dummy when her teeth were cutting in?
Confusion and desolation roil in John's gut. "I don't know what to say," he murmurs weakly and rubs both hands over his mouth.
Unfortunately, a lack of staff means no tea tray brought up to the suite. Then he steps fully into the main area of the suite and spots a note on the coffee table, held down with a pinecone from the Christmas centerpiece in the middle of the table.
"I love you," I said, framing his face with my hands. "I have never been in love and I will never love anyone else."
Sherlock."
So, instead, I did what John did a half dozen times a day. I filled the kettle and switched it on, then got out two mugs and two tea bags. With the discipline of long years of self-denial, I forced myself to keep my feet rooted in front of the worktop, and watched the kettle. Its ticking and clanking seemed teeth-grindingly loud in the ominous quiet.

from the man he had been. He was hunched in on himself, his hands gripping John's cardigan, trying to wrap it around himself. His bottom half was naked, which only added to the pitiful picture he made. Sherlock was lighting up all the parts of John that made him want to help and protect people.
Sherlock reached over to turn on the lamp. John was staring at him with tired, sad eyes. His whole face was creased in pain. Sherlock felt his throat trying to work, and he tried to hold back his own tears but couldn't. He'd been waiting all day—no, all
"There were no strong emotions during your childhood to create many positive memories," Sherlock summarized. "But their death created very strong emotions. You feel you have too many negative instead of positive memories."
John's face
"No, not really," Louisa stated.
"Sweet tooth, eh?" I chuckle.
"Don't," John says, looking up at me, his mouth a white line in his face, a muscle in his jaw clenching and unclenching. I stare at it to avoid his eyes which are glittering wetly. He breathes in and out, shaky, but I lift my chin defiantly, building up the wall that I'd allowed to crumble in the face of John's improbable friendship, and say coldly, "I was here first, so I think it only fair that you be the one to move out."
"The thing that Evelyn and I made," Eurus says, coming to finagle a spot close to John, trying unsuccessfully to hip check Sherlock out of the way. "Is a dictation program. We wrote it, Evelyn and I."

John's mouth drops open and this time he doesn't bother to close it. He stares at Mycroft who shrugs apologetically and then he turns to glare at Sherlock who's glaring at his phone in turn. "You never told me there were
! And even if he could, how could he secure Sherlock's promise not to do it again? What consequences would deter him?
John grimaces, remorse running through him in acknowledgement of that fact. "It wasn't them. I was already afraid—afraid you'd make fun of me for what I felt—that it would be awkward between us and eventually drive us apart." John's words, at first halting, now come in a great rush. "Because that worries the bloody fuck out of me, I have to say. I'm terrified of losing you and, because of that, like a great bloody idiot, I shut down. Any armchair psychologist could tell you I was trying to leave you before you left me. You're brilliant and gorgeous and fit and talented, and, and—you have this wonderful, incredible—just this warm and open family who love you and want to help you and are willing to humiliate you—and me—because they want you to be happy. So you don't really need someone like me, someone who's just—" John's words dry up. He stares down at his hands and realizes he's shaking.
Sherlock raises his eyes and looks straight into John's and John flinches when he hears what Sherlock says next. "He told me he

I gesture towards him. "Let me, uh, have a look at your—"
She throws up her hands. "This is ridiculous! The two of you are like moody teenagers, both of you off sulking in your corner and refusing to explain anything. I thought Sherlock brought you here because you'd finally worked this whole friends-or-more-than-friends shit out. Then Sherlock tells me that he never should have let you come here because now we've made everything worse!"
"Shut up and get over here," Sherlock demanded, his glower losing some of its intensity.
I had no answers.

"Very well. Before we begin, these are the rules—if at any point you want to slow down or take a break, you say yellow. If you want to stop completely, you say red. Understood?" When John nodded his head, I continued. "Then this is what I want you to do—put everything in that pile of stuff back into the box except for three things that you would like to try. Then bring them upstairs to me. I'll be waiting for you in your room."
"What do you mean?" Sherlock asked, brows furrowed.
. Like that matters. Labels are ridiculous. People want to organize everything into neat little lines and slap on a label. I suppose they must or else they wouldn't be able to cope. John is obviously bisexual, but suffers from what I call auto-homophobia. He has no problem with other people's sexuality, but his reaction to being assumed gay is almost violent, as though it's okay for other people but not for himself. He's never discussed his parents' reaction to discovering Harry was gay, but it's clear his parents didn't approve. How very much like John to be so predictable. So
"Are you staying?" Sherlock asked, the neediness in his voice unmistakable.

"You're worried he's going to leave, and you're equally worried that this—whatever you want with him—will work out! Don't you know what that means?"
"I thought it prudent," I begin, and John murmurs, "Yeah?" while fisting his hands in my shirt. I continue, "To make sure that I—" I'm cut short by John's lips against mine. How John manages to make closed mouth kisses so filthy is beyond me. Clearly, he has special powers. When he pulls away, I manage to finish speaking, "—showered."
Sherlock grumbles wordlessly, but calls back over his shoulder, "Tell Mum, and I quote,

Sherlock was losing John. Now that he felt better, John felt his obligation was coming to an end, and they would return to the way they'd been when John had left him in March—John pretending Sherlock didn't exist, and Sherlock left in an agony of longing. Would he long for John like this forever? Could he ever love anyone else now that he knew what it was like to love John Watson? There weren't any more John Watsons in the world, of that Sherlock was positive. There was only one, and Sherlock had lost him as a result of his betrayal and indecision.
I don't even know how to respond to something like that, but luckily I don't have to know because he just keeps talking. That's also good because it allows me to stare at his truly, absurdly long toes. They're like fucking
John's hands make quick work of cleaning me, his soapy fingers focused solely on my arse, leaving no doubt as to his intentions for this evening. We make perfunctory attempts to dry off, throwing wet towels on the floor in our haste. Inside the bedroom, I feel shy once more, ridiculous when my cock is standing up proud against my belly and John is regarding me the way I've seen lionesses regard sickly wildebeest.
John thought to himself and had to stifle a grin.)

By the time John had taken the leaflet, the pew he'd planned to sit in—the one furthest in the back—had filled up enough that he would have to step over people and sit in the middle. Not a good place to sit if one wanted to make a quick getaway. Nothing like tripping over people to draw attention to oneself. John's eyes scanned the church (
"She may as well have announced that she was going to punch me in the face. I was absolutely shocked and hurt. I felt very strongly that she was being unfair. My transgression didn't deserve her to kick me. It was so mean—or that's how I saw it, you know—she was, after all, an adult, which meant she could kick harder than I.

"My sisters. Women are never to be entirely trusted—not even Sherrinford, and she's the best of us."
The fact that Sherlock has been reduced to only the fundamentals of language by their smoking hot snogging session makes a giggle bubble up in John. It turns into a laugh and that causes Sherlock to frown at him, clearly offended, which just ratchets John's amusement up and up until his face is pressed against Sherlock's shoulder as he's wracked with sudden emotion—joy, love, forgiveness, passion.
"Well, everyone," Sherrinford admits with a shrug.
forever, a reflexive need to retain control over his own mind. When he was fifteen, his mother had taken him to see a psychiatrist, who'd diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. Although he'd gone back month after month, Sherlock only let Dr. Llewellyn help him when he'd ended up so depressed that he didn't have the wherewithal to protest. He'd take the medication, see the doctor for weekly therapy visits, and as soon as he was feeling better, stopped taking the meds and gone back to his sullen, oppositional relationship with his long-suffering psychiatrist.

John stares moodily out at the orchard now, his hands clasped behind his back. Suddenly, Mycroft appears next to him.
—it, was a longing I had never allowed myself. Who would ever love me when my work was dangerous, my personality chaotic and abrasive, my demands on one's time unreasonable, and my sexual satisfaction lay in tying someone up and hurting them?
Looking wary, John walked into his room, carrying his choices in his arms. His face was alarmingly red. I wondered if he blushed that furiously everywhere.

Will leans forward confidentially and lowers his voice even though they're alone in the house. "I'm not known for the bluntness my wife and children are prone to, but in this one case, I intend to be utterly frank—I believe my son is in love with you. Do you return those feelings?"
When I walked out of my room, John was hovering in the kitchen, and the look on his face when he saw me at least answered the question of whether or not he found me attractive. I immediately catalogued it into my mind palace for a future confidence booster or wank material. (Yes, I was arrogant enough to get off on other people finding me spellbinding and gorgeous.) (I say

As he lies in bed that night, trying to sleep, John can't help but ruminate on why Sherlock had been so freaked out about John accepting the invitation to come here. He would understand if Sherlock's family were horrible or embarrassing, but they're fun and welcoming. In fact, as soon as he was near his family, Sherlock's whole body lost the tension he'd been holding on the drive here.
Sherlock lifted his face to the ceiling and mumbled, "Yes."

Darrow smiles sadly, and nods in resignation. He understands my predicament. His wife, Adie, is from Southern Australia. They met when Darrow traveled there to buy new stock for his herd from Adie's father. In her case, she moved from one sheep farm to another. Asking a detective to move to the desolate highlands where crime consists of the occasional public nuisance would be asking him to give up his life's work.

Oh, yes, prostate sensitivity, apologizing for the sparking electric stroke of his cock over the sensitive nub of nerves inside until it becomes almost too much and I may fly apart in a shower of John ignited sparks, nothing left of me but white-hot devastation.
"I have work tomorrow," John said, brushing his teeth in desultory fashion.
Within a week, Sherlock had acquiesced in defeat.
"Behind you, in the wooden box." My voice comes out even, but my hands are shaking. I'm terrified—it's terrifying how painfully I want him. By this time tomorrow he'll be gone, and if I let this go past a bit of flirting, it will kill me when he leaves. It's best not to let it go anywhere, then.

He hadn't bothered to try to contact Sherlock once he'd got in the cab and headed home. If Sherlock was going to respond, he would've done so by then.

He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's shoulders and pulled him close. He heard Sherlock muttering into his neck, and tried to make it out. Eventually he picked out something like

"Don't be silly. Of course we still need the second bedroom at home," Sherlock says absently, looking around the bedroom as though he forgot something. John's heart sinks at Sherlock's dismissal and the knowledge that their sleeping arrangements at home will remain separate.
Papa—when I wrote this down I thawt it was like someone would call their dad if they were from like history like 1980 or something. But now that I am looking at it again I think I have found the TOTALLY PERFCT name to call John!! I want to tell him RITE NOW but you know I think it will be my wedding present to him. (I'm not getting Dad a wedding present because he's already my Dad and that's enuff of a gift).
I stroked the tips of my fingers along John's jaw then picked up the crop and held it in front of John. Mimicking the way I'd just then lovingly touched his face, I slid my hands along the length of the crop.

No, of course not, if you doubt what I'm saying," she mumbles to herself. Speaking to him again, she says, "He looks at you with such longing. And he talks about you
John stomped back over to his chair and then dragged something heavy around it. I recognized immediately the object he pushed to the middle of the sitting room. An old-fashioned steamer trunk, with leather bindings and two clasps that locked. I never locked them. I never needed to. John, unlike myself, was not a snoop.
"Yes, you have," Audrey said lightly, but Sherlock didn't doubt for a minute that she was serious. "She doesn't doubt your love, Sherlock, but she's terribly curious about the new flat. She'd find all that mess delightful. Chemicals and a microscope on the kitchen table—and body parts in the fridge!"
"Honesty is good."
write.
I raised an eyebrow "How did that feel?"
"Are you in love with me, too?"
"God, I don't know—twice is the most I've ever done," Andrew said, taking one hand off the wall to push back his sweaty hair from his forehead.
"Yes, of course," Sherlock said, nodding madly, eager to soothe John in any way. "The bed is—I changed the sheets. I showered, too, and, and—I've already washed the dirty ones and put them away in the linen cupboard."
Sherlock was too thin and utterly wrecked. He was sobbing in John's arms, begging for John to hold his hand. But his mother had just died! That had nothing to do with what had happened between the two of them.
"A dictation program?" John asks, puzzled.
They'd had no private conversation. They'd not been within twenty feet of each other all night. And yet—Sherlock felt
I am not brave.
Let me
John's face is almost nose to nose with mine, even though he's no longer stepping on his tiptoes, and I realize that's because my lips have followed his down, and as he steps back my whole body follows. Without breaking physical contact, he draws me all the way to the bath with little kisses and licks and nips, and with only a quick glance behind him, pushes aside the shower curtain and turns on the taps.
"Some—" John starts to say and then glares at Sherlock. "You said you'd explain why you and Victor broke up if I answered two extra questions, so I did. Technically, I've answered
"Wait, that's it? Just
together, a ten year marriage and we knew each other for two years before that." Sherlock collapsed on the bed, letting his head fall into his hands. "I want you to have your answers, whatever answers you need, John. I don't want to hold back, even if it'll make me look bad—well,
Heavy angst ahead. Enter oh ye brave of heart.
"To boarding school," Sherlock said, looking down at his pajama clad lap. He always felt uncomfortable when the subject of Sherlock's family wealth came up.
"I did," said Sherlock with a proud nod of his head.
"There they are!" says Violet when Sherlock and John have finally cooled their ardor and are attempting, and failing, to make a less obvious entrance in the dining room. John glances at Sherlock, gratified to see that Sherlock is blushing as vividly as he himself is.
We're all broken pieces floating by

He tries again to take me in hand, but my erection is waning. I care so much less about coming than I do about holding him and breathing in his smell and
I reached for him again, and this time he did not try to move away from me. I wrapped my arms around him and my hands couldn't help themselves—they roved over his back, one going up to cup his neck and the other going down to press against the dip of his spine right above the curve of his buttocks. I used both hands to bring us flush against each other.
MOMENTOUS OCCASION! I said that I wanted to be the one to give them their gifts from each other and so I picked them up and handed them to each other at the same time. They looked at each other all funny like they were

"Whatever you want, the answer is no," John said, and hung up before he could ask something stupid. Like,
I forced myself to go home before I could give into what I knew I could have instead of what I feared I could not.
I held up the cuffs. "I'm going to cuff your hands in front of you to keep the pressure off your shoulder, and then loop some of this rope through the link between the cuffs to tie you to the headboard."
. Which isn't fair, since you know everything about me, even the stuff—
, that area on both sides of the buttocks comprised of the gluteus maximus and medius, as well as the adductor magnus, located directly below the buttocks and slightly inwards towards the groin. I carefully avoided the obliques and the lumbar area, and—as much as was possible—kept my strikes on the sacral region light when I couldn't avoid it altogether.
She looks back at John with a wide-eyed deviousness that suggests her words are less a rebuke of her sister than part of a script she and Eurus have written together. John gawps at them and, with an aching fondness, thinks about how very much like Sherlock they are.

Sherlock stared at John open-mouthed for a moment and John thought he could feel the cold already building between them as he waited for a sharp-tongued dismissal.
In my bedroom, I changed into dark jeans, and a tight black button down with a lighter pinstripe pattern. In the bathroom, I played with my hair and freshened up my aftershave, all for John's benefit as nobody at the club would notice.
"John, please, listen to me," Mycroft said, putting up his hands as though he was trying to keep John in the room.
in scenes during which they were naked, often aroused, or even engaged in sexual intercourse, she didn't find witnessing such intimacy precluded her right to act as a mother figure for those of us she considered as belonging to her.

"Ah, yes, Dr. Sawyer said to give Sherlock her best and to tell him not to keep you up at all hours. Put your foot down, she said."
I put down the crop despite John's encouragement, but only so I could clutch a globe of his arse in each hand, kneading the heated skin. I spread his cheeks apart and exposed the puckered pink kiss of his arsehole to my gaze. My breathing stuttered.
. John, the laptop is from

, John thinks to himself, feeling oddly cherished, like he's just another one of her children. He's obediently downstairs at the appointed time.
John was asleep by the time Sherlock got into bed with him five minutes later. Carefully, Sherlock snuggled up behind John, wrapping him up in his arms, enjoying the treasured closeness. John grunted quietly in his sleep, but relaxed back against Sherlock, who pressed a kiss on the nape of his neck and whispered, "I love you."
The heated skin beneath my hands was quickly becoming stained a dusky rose.

"Let's just try and see, shall we?" I said smugly.
John watches in alarm as she rounds the front of the car to his side and pulls open the door.
—this morning and after I'd paced the flat and worked out some of that energy, I realized the extent of what I'd done to you last night. I was going to apologize when you came home. I was brooding, trying to think of ways I could make it up to you. Then Audrey showed up unannounced and, well—you know."
"Yes," John says quietly, and then attempts to smile, but just shrugs weakly. He sets the bags down on the floor, and begins moving the beakers and petri dishes carefully away, opening up a space. Without looking up, he says, "You could help me, you know." He sounds both angry, and regretful, and I don't think he's talking about cleaning off the table anymore.
"Already experimenting with people at age six," John quipped, and Sherlock stared up at the ceiling and sighed with exasperation. "Sorry," John said, not sounding very sorry at all. "Continue."
"Why am I hiding in the loo?" I fill in, feeling a small smile queueing up to my lips.
Our vow of silence is broken only by the noises of passion and sex and climax.
have silenced the great Sherlock Holmes?"
"For me?" he asks, stepping closer.
Sherlock spoke then, his voice quiet and earnest. "Promise me that you'll remember today. This—acknowledgement of what we have meant to each other. I don't want—even if only for Louisa, I would rather not fight over anything. I don't want her to feel like her life is falling apart while we're arguing about who gets to keep the Persian carpets or what we consider a just division of our financial investments."
He pulls me on top of him, or tries to, but I stop him, reaching under the bed for the bottle of lube I stash there. I hand it to him, but he shakes his head and hands it back to me. When he spreads his legs and pulls his knees up, I gulp and he smiles, that sultry smirk again. He bites his lower lip with just the edge of one tooth and I settle back on my haunches and squirt lube onto my fingers.
, but only in that
John frowned. "I know what BDSM is."
," Sherlock hissed, eyes drifting shut as John sucked his lower lip into his mouth, tonguing along the plump bit of flesh before releasing it with an audible wet pop.
"Thank you, Sherlock," John says after an uncomfortable moment.
One of the joys of raising Cheviots are the strength of the ewes' mothering instincts and the ease with which they lamb. Plus, the lambs are born alert and curious. It's a satisfying experience to work with a breed that's much more intelligent than your average wool producer.
"Nine sharp, yes, yes, go away," he says looming over his sisters.
"What is it?" Audrey asked, a concerned furrow between her eyebrows.
"Were you in love with Audrey when you married her?" he asked Sherlock.
"I had a case yesterday—wait, no, it was Wednesday. Anyway, we didn't get home until early this morning. I'm just exhausted."
At John's behest, he washed his hair, and then a second time, his face, and then John took over, not at all shy about washing Sherlock's genitals or between his buttocks. Sherlock was hardly shy, having been in this exact position at least half a dozen times during the time he and John were lovers, but this time it was embarrassing rather than arousing. John gave himself a perfunctory wash and then bustled them out of the bathroom and into the bedroom, where he gave Sherlock a clean t-shirt and drawstring bottoms to change into. With only a towel around his waist, John disappeared into the sitting room and came back dressed in pajamas as well.
Sherlock's case, which made no sense.
Sherlock found himself wanting to hear those little sounds of interest and pleasure directed at him. As each person completed their little speech and sat, Sherlock found his heart beating faster and his palms sweating, a feeling of anxiety washing over him. He wanted Dr. Watson's eyes on him, but as each student stood, spoke, and then sat again, Sherlock's anxiety grew—he felt the prickle of sweat underneath his arms, the heat of his flushed face, and every bit of saliva in his mouth dried up. He wanted to take his jacket off—the room was overheated against the soggy cold outside, but without a suit jacket he felt strangely
"Hey, you didn't tell him it's from us, too!" Eurus says, her face squinched up indignantly.
"Can we talk about it when I get there?"
"Have
and bless us with their long-travelled light.
All of the staff are off because it's Christmas Eve, so when Sherlock knocks on John's door to tell him breakfast is a fend-for-yourself affair, John's relieved not to have to go downstairs. Avoiding Sherlock, without being obvious about it, is difficult enough as it is without having to blend in with the happy Holmeses. When John finally pokes his head out of his room around nine, he finds an empty suite and no sounds coming from either the sitting room or Sherlock's room. Triumphant, he meanders into the sitting room in his pajamas to see about getting a cup of tea.
"Oh, really?" said John, allowing me to haul him up and out of the bed.
"Another?" Will asks, dipping his head at John's empty glass.
"Looks like we've come to the end of the road. Should we turn around?" John asks.
"Oh, it's you," she says, her voice rife with disappointment. Sherlock's laugh surprises John. It's full of an indulgent fondness John doesn't think he's ever heard in that deep rumble before. He would never have even thought Sherlock capable of feeling something like that.
"So, I, uh—I think maybe the best way to do this is for us to take turns asking questions. You should go first," John says, rubbing his sweaty hands on his trouser legs. "And I'm sorry for last night, for not giving you the chance to talk to me. All right—go ahead and ask your question."
"Okay," John says, frowning. "That's a bit sexist, but okay."
1. I used the names Sherrinford and Eurus for two of the sisters because those are names already familiar to us, being associated with canon. For the third sister, I remembered a guy I dated before I met my husband who had a daughter named Charysa. I thought it was bizarre enough of a name to belong to a Holmes.
"No, I just think you should talk about her. To me. I want to know."

Audrey walked in, handing out mugs of hot chocolate. "Here we go, then."
"How many?"
want you to come to breakfast, okay?" They both grin at him hopefully. They're in matching sets of pajamas which John finds odd. Don't twins grow out of that type of thing? It distracts him momentarily and he takes a few seconds to respond while he blinks away the night's sleep. "Ah, okay then. I will be down for breakfast at nine o'clock sharp."
Sherlock said, "You're phenomenal," with a degree of awe in his voice that would have embarrassed him if he hadn't already had verbal confirmation that John would shortly be snogging him and, hopefully, feeling him up as well.
"stop!"
The engine is running, the heater on full blast and the inside of the Wagon is too hot for me. I pull off my wet jacket and toss it into the footwell of the passenger seat. Then I pull back onto the road and turn back towards home.
—and his fingertips come up and trace my cheek and jaw, down to my chin, where he rests his thumb. His eyes are heavy-lidded, and the weight of his body comforts me. My hands have moved to rest on the top of his knees without my realizing it. His thumb presses against my chin, the pressure parting my lips, and then he leans in, and breathes, "I'm kissing you. That's what I'm doing."
. I will never doubt that he loves me any less than I love him (though it can't be quantifiable; feels limitless, frankly) because in John Watson's eyes, I also see
"What did you think of the class?" John asked in a murmur.
"Oh, John," I murmured, smoothing my hand over his arse again. "You'll be rutting into my hand before long, I can promise you that."
don't want to explain something—
Sherlock looks down at his clasped hands. "Because I knew they'd do exactly what they've done—try to push us together—and I was afraid it would drive you away for good." Sherlock looks up at him, the barest tremble to his body. "And it almost did, didn't it?"
John pulled away, and got out of bed. Sherlock wanted to ask where he was going, but felt he didn't have the right. John ducked into the bathroom, and blew his nose. He came back out with a roll of loo paper and tossed it on the bed. He stood against the wall with his arms crossed. The tender, heartbroken John from only a few minutes ago was replaced by the angry, heartbroken John.
Will nods his head and they both let their gazes wander into the middle distance in the way two taciturn men who are strangers will do. The silence stretches out so long that it becomes comfortable by default as the two follow Violet and Sherlock, who get further and further ahead. Then, just as John lowers his guard, Will pulls what John now thinks of as a Holmes specialty—the emotional ambush.

"Louisa, lower your voice," Audrey scolded.
," Audrey moaned in his ear, her voice hoarse and shaken. She lifted her hips and he gathered his arms underneath her, holding her up even higher, driving into her with furious thrusts. Her cunt, tight and sweetly slick, clenched at his cock and he groaned, the sound rolling out of him like thunder. In the next moment, he grunted in surprise to find he was on the verge of orgasm.
. He's so melodramatic."
"It was supposed to be a one-night stand!" Sherlock said, a feeble defense, he knew.
For a moment, Mycroft's shoulders slump with real defeat, but he gathers himself and turns to Sherlock. "How on earth do you propose that I should be able to twist an invitation to spend Christmas with our
"Oh, for God's sake, Oasis, can't you keep anything to yourself?" I groaned.

problems? What boy problems?"
John, looking around at them uncertainly, opens the box and slides out—yes—a brand new Apple Macbook, the most recent version. "Oh my God," he murmurs to Sherlock, then leans closer and hisses, "These things are like £2900!"
"What word would you prefer I use to refer to it?" John said with slicing sarcasm. "Clearly you've had your whole fucking

John clears his throat then takes a healthy swig of his whiskey. "I can't say if it will or won't."
John, at this point, was to heed his request.

“Yeah, but who is he?”

Actually, John ended up getting in the way of the experiment during
Sherlock righted the stool - when had it fallen over? - and started tidying up his workspace. "No you're not."
“Then it
“I’d say the killer is left-handed, going by the angle of the slashes on her throat and stomach.” He pulled back the sheet and Lestrade took an awkward step backward as John gently placed his fingers just inside the edge of the wound. “Serrated blade, I think. Rather long, too, but very deliberate cuts…” John trailed off when he noticed something – or rather, something missing. “They’ve removed her uterus.” His eyes met Sherlock’s in disgust. A cold wave of unease washed over John, but Sherlock was as composed as ever, his long fingers drumming the cane as he nodded along with John’s assessment.
“Client,” they whispered into each other’s mouths. A soft laugh floated between them, unsure of to whom it belonged.
- another decadent moan. "And then he kissed me - he shoved his tongue down my throat because I am a unmitigated slut.
“A what?”
“Ah, I see,” replied John. Then, as casually as possible, “So, d’you have a girlfriend?” Sherlock was still staring out the window, contemplating his failure over Harry’s gender, but he turned slowly toward John at his question. Those shining jade eyes narrowed, scrutinising John in a way that was surprisingly rather attractive, as though he were looking straight into him.
“Asphyxiated – her spine appears intact, so it took a while.” He cleared his throat, but soldiered on. “Tongue removed with a short, serrated blade just after death.” John glanced around behind her, taking in the whole picture. “Hands bound – she couldn’t fight back. I’d say, since her clothes all seem to be in place, that there is little chance of sexual assault.” Dark blue eyes finally met Sherlock’s and he nodded slightly, handing the investigation over. He cared so much – how could he do that? He had only met this woman once and yet he was incredibly moved and angered by her death.
“Girlfriend, no,” he answered slowly. “Not really my area.”
“But you weren’t in my company, were you?” Sherlock muttered under his breath. Not quietly enough, it seemed, as John stopped on his path toward the stairs and turned slowly back.
John has feelings and he's never sure how he feels about that.
- the cock, why don't you?"
"Sort of." He took up the glass but didn't drink just yet. "This man - James Martino - he's been missing for three days. His neighbor says they come here sometimes to… play."
“The sheer
“My God, if you say that one more time…”
"Oh, no, don't," Sherlock said at once, actually looking up from his work. "I quite like this song."
“Impossible, I’m not her father,” Sherlock spat out, annoyed at John’s flippancy. John licked his lips and poorly stifled a smile.
John’s eyes asked.
Two hours later – which was far too much later, in Sherlock’s opinion – Sherlock and John re-entered 221B with quiet steps. Sure enough, Mrs. Hudson was asleep on the couch, her head lolled to the side and her mouth agape, as Rosie sat nestled in the crook of her arm, still awake and watching
“No.” He didn’t elaborate. Just continued to smile coyly at John from across the cab.
“What else do you remember?”
“Oh.” Sherlock cast his eyes about for something to say or do. “And she reminded you of –”
, but neither did he reject it as he had the earlier music of the Beatles. John let it play out, nodding his head and singing under his breath. God, what a great song. He continued to drive in relative stillness through
Alcohol and Sam Cooke.
“I want to go with you, Daddy!”
John extended a hand to the man and said, “John Watson.”
"Not bad." John smirked as he saw Sherlock's eyebrow go up with interest. "The girls certainly liked it - nimble fingers." John danced those same fingers along the collar of Sherlock's coat and gleaned a small grin.
“Roman god with two faces,” came John’s nonplussed reply. Sherlock drew his head back in wonderment.
John and Sherlock go on their first official date.
“Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.” Sherlock handed the mobile back over and his face fell the moment their fingers touched. He looked very much like he’d just realised that he had been speaking at all and instantly regretted it.
“Done,” Lestrade said proudly. “Thankfully, Sherlock called us early enough that we were able to get him into custody before he left this evening. He had this woman’s photo in his pocket,” he handed over a small wallet-sized photo to Sherlock, who brought it close to his face and set about memorising every detail. “You were right - he was after her, too.”
Sherlock didn't like to have sex when only one of them was drunk. If they were both pissed, sure, no problem. They'd fumble around each other for hours before finally managing to get off and go to sleep and it was always a perfect, hazy, mess of a romp. But if only one of them was impaired (usually John, as Sherlock honestly didn't drink very often), Sherlock absolutely would

“Very good, John,” Sherlock nodded, his smile returning. John tried not to beam. He spun around to say to Lestrade, “We need to speak with the bartender.” Sherlock snatched up the second glass and sniffed at its meagre contents. “Was this Dodds’ glass?”
“They’re just words, John –”
“Anderson,” he acknowledged with undisguised disdain. Turning to the man leaning against Lestrade’s doorframe, Sherlock continued, “I was unaware that Scotland Yard had continued use for an upright
Sherlock sighed, but John ssh-ed him. A
"Sherlock," John said, trying to swallow his frustration, "you can't
“Did he say if there are any others? Any other hitmen or women in danger?” Sherlock demanded.
“How would you know?”
Perhaps John’s emotions didn’t have to be logical. That was something he had tried to impart to Sherlock before, but he’d always struggled to comprehend the notion. All that mattered was that he was upset and Sherlock didn’t want to make it any worse.
“And you thought it appropriate to take Rosie with you?” John could feel that he was being irrational, but he hadn’t slept well since he had shot that man – he never did for a few days after – and things between him and Sherlock were so…
“Sherlock, you called the police to handle a police matter,” John reasoned calmly. “You had Rosie with you - it was very responsible of you to call Greg and let the Yard handle it.”
“Alright, alright,” Sherlock muttered, finally breaking their kiss. “The game is still on and apparently the game is impatient.” He slithered out of the chair and made for the door. But as he passed, he dropped a hand onto John’s shoulder and squeezed very briefly.
“I think… I think something rather unbelievable has happened,” Sherlock said quietly. Something about John Watson made him want to talk about what was going on ‒ whatever
“A pity about the mud on your coat, though,” Watson commented. “We’ll tidy you up at the hospital.” From there, they were quiet, Watson staring placidly out the window as Sherlock tried to organise his thoughts. The journey to St. Bart’s hospital took nearly twice as long in a carriage versus a cab and Sherlock was growing more and more anxious by the minute.
He stepped forward and started looking closer, taking a proffered pair of nitrile gloves from D.I. Lestrade. “Dead… five hours, give or take. No signs of injury ‒ no blood or bruising. Poison?” John carefully lifted the glass from the man’s stiff fingers and gave it a bit of a sniff. He shook his head and offered it to Sherlock.
, John,” Sherlock whined, gesturing to the two offending people in their sitting room. Donovan reached for the slipper on the mantle and Sherlock snapped, “Don’t touch that!”
“Well of course she has, John,” Sherlock replied impatiently. “You’ve got the mouse jumper with the elephant leggings. Rodents and pachyderms do not mix – or don’t you watch cartoons?” At his matter-of-fact tone, John turned his gaze slowly on Sherlock in awe. The detective was nearly bouncing with energy, anxious to get a move on, oblivious to the absurdity of this revelation.
with me?”
“I know perfectly well where the book is, John,” Sherlock replied calmly. “I’m merely trying to pull you away from your mundane task so that I may speak to you privately about the case.”
Not like he usually danced, unknowingly around the room as he was lost in thought. This was very different.
"What is it?"
“Yes.”
John wasn’t quite sure why this surprised him – perhaps because the world’s only consulting detective had managed to “delete” all other basic human interactions
“We spoke to her a few days ago,” John expanded, his arms crossed and his eyes downcast. “She gave us some information that helped us find Jack’s address – she didn’t know it herself, but she knew where he spends his time.”
.” His words tied a fierce knot in Sherlock’s stomach and he let out a pained cry.
“What do they do?” John asked.
“I think I’ve travelled through time.”
“Oh, you do?” Sherlock replied in a mocking tone, eliciting a grin from the little girl across from him.
“Get off of me, you bastard,” the man grunted, but Sherlock leaned harder into his back.
“That’s because you’re almost wilfully-ignorant of style, John. Now, let’s go! The game is on!” Sherlock took the stairs three at a time as John pulled a new jumper over Rosie’s head, this one blue with pink polka-dots which did not elicit a tantrum. He picked her up and headed down the stairs himself to find Sherlock waiting at the door of the flat with John and Rosie’s coats in hand, waiting impatiently.
Sherlock wasn’t in the lounge area, so John found a seat that was free of bodies and committed to finishing his drink. Next to him on the sofa was a woman in nothing but a black latex bra, sprawled out with her hands in the hair of a man knelt between her knees. His body was crossed with several leather straps all converging at his cock, which was trapped in a metal cage. He was lapping at the woman’s vagina like a dog, his cock leaking and untouched.

can sleep,” he pleaded. “Or go for a walk ‒ clear your mind.”
“And you think they’re connected?” John inferred. Lestrade was silent, his hand cupped over his mouth as he tried not to vomit at the sight before him. Noticing this, John replaced the sheet and Lestrade visibly relaxed. “Not just similar tattoos – same artist, maybe? Choosing numbers important to them?”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said, running his hands through his hair. “I think she’s confused. I put her to bed and she said to me, ‘Good night,
"What is it?" John stilled his grinding hips and reaching fingers, but continued nuzzling Sherlock's neck in a way they both liked.
(See the end of the chapter for
At any rate, Sherlock had pulled John out onto the dance floor, ignoring John’s protestations that this was a largely politically-conservative group of people and they would draw a lot of unwanted attention. “Anyone paying attention to us obviously has nothing else on their mind and can be eliminated as a suspect. The dance floor is in the center of the room and turning will allow me the best possible viewpoint of the entire room. Now stop complaining, John, and waltz.”
“John, I…” Sherlock started, pressing his forehead against the other man’s.
Sherlock was writhing against a man in a pair of unforgivingly-tight leather trousers, their hips moving backward and forward in tandem. John had never seen Sherlock move like that. He had
"Stop talking." John grasped Sherlock's face in his hands and took his mouth in a searing kiss. Sherlock responded immediately, opening his legs so John could press against him where he sat on the stool and wrapping his arms around John’s waist. Swirling his tongue expertly against Sherlock’s, John ran his fingers through that mass of black curls and down to his shirt collar. Sherlocks own hands slid into the waistband of John’s jeans and started untucking his jumper.
The timer chose that moment to
Sherlock led the dance, of course, but John took control once they crossed the threshold of their shared flat. He pressed Sherlock urgently against the closed door in their little second-floor hallway, taking his mouth in a searing kiss that left Sherlock breathless and John feeling very smug. John’s hands reached under Sherlock’s suit jacket and threw it to the floor; he knew that Sherlock would complain about it later, but John felt a little bit of naughty excitement at the idea of pissing him off. For now, it landed without notice by the detective and John continued to undress him as they backed toward Sherlock’s bedroom – it was closest.
“Hmm?”
"Sherlock!" John admonished, but his heart gave a traitorous little flicker.
“Sherlock, what are you doing here?” Much to Sherlock’s surprise, Mycroft sat down on the dingy cushion beside Sherlock. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and pulled him upright with considerable effort, Sherlock being little more than dead weight.
by David Bowie, his torso responded in kind, and his slim body practically undulated as he moved from table to table with his magnifier. Interesting.
“They are so far from ‘just’ words and you know it,” he panted in anger. That was the crux of it, right there. Sherlock could betray him again, just like he had before. Just like Mary had. Anything could happen and all this perfect happiness could be snatched away and John would be left mourning all over again. And he wasn’t sure if he could survive it. “I’ll never forget the sound of you saying that to me before you… before I thought you….” He swallowed and took a deep breath. “I know it wasn’t real, but it
With a sigh into John’s open mouth, Sherlock murmured, “John… the samples…”
possible can -”
"About you and me?"
He fumbled for the bit of leather around his arm and took it loosely in his grasp. It took much more effort than it should have, but Sherlock managed to undo the buckle and a strangled gasp clawed its way out of his throat as heat spread through his veins. He flexed his fingers and felt a warm tingle start at the base of his neck and spread down his spine, thrilling and familiar. Another deep sigh and the collar slipped from his limp grasp.
“It’s none of your business, Lestrade,” Sherlock cut across their conversation. “John, come and have a look, will you?” The small crowd of people surrounding the bar parted and John took a step forward, but almost immediately stopped in his tracks.
"Pass me those blood samples, John." His eye still glued to the microscope in front of him, Sherlock extended his arm and waited. John debated insisting that Sherlock say "please", but decided it would be a lost lesson on him in his current state of focus. He was surprised, though, when he handed the slide-filled tray over and Sherlock said, "Thank you." How considerate.
"By pretending to play an instrument with which you have no experience?"
“Rosie, listen to your father,” Sherlock said, remarkably calm, standing over John where he knelt in front of the little girl. “You’re going to have a lovely time with Molly and we are going to work.” Sherlock bent down and placed a surprisingly tender kiss on Rosie’s forehead.
). He made breakfast, albeit the toast was a little uneven after being scorched on the Bunsen burner gauze. Generally speaking, Sherlock had been a bouncier, more considerate version of himself than John had ever seen. It was almost unnerving.
“Hardly.” John stood and retrieved the telescoping aluminium cane from his bag that he had used when he first met Sherlock. He’d kept it all these years and Sherlock had used it more than once – twice for its intended use, four times as a presentation pointer, and once to push and pull objects away from Anderson at Scotland Yard. Extending it to its full length, it was still a little short for Sherlock, but it would do. John held out the handle for Sherlock to grab, but he did not move until John knocked his hip bone hard enough to annoy. He pulled the detective to his feet and forced the cane into his hand. “Come on, let’s go and have a proper look at the crime scene.”
With that, he left the bathroom, turning the light off as he went, even though Sherlock was still in the bathroom. Sherlock stood in the dark for a minute and then, without turning on the light, brushed his teeth and flossed.
"Anthea!" John gasps.
had given him the advantage when it came to sussing out other boys who were gay and therefore equally invested in secrecy. Sherlock had great confidence in his good looks as well. He'd never undergone an awkward period in adolescence, much to his brother's resentment. He was tall, had always been lean; as he grew older, his face gradually lost its babyish sweetness while his lanky limbs grew long muscles and his body became wiry and strong. That gradual changing kept him from ever looking like a gawky teenager.
The man he's with now is the ultimate predator and the fact that a man like Sherlock—a man with all the attributes John listed only half an hour ago—a man so beautiful and so brilliant—knowing Sherlock wants
"What!" squawks Sherlock, jumping from his chair.

This time Sherlock can't hide his reaction. His eyes widen and his lips part. His chest expands with a huge breath and he struggles momentarily to speak. John smiles wickedly, feeling as though he's scored a major point in their game of Q & A.

Sherrinford came to me fully formed--her physical appearance, personality, and character arc within the story were all provided for by the Muse without me having to think about it. The second thing my lovely Muse provided without effort on my part was this bit of dialogue between Sherrinford and John in Chapter 3:
John's heart seems to stop and then restarts, racing. "What do you mean by that?"
Being a beta reader is a very time-consuming and oftentimes frustrating job, for which one earns ZERO DOLLARS, and unlike the writer, betas don't have their names front and center for everyone to point at and say, "This person is an AWESOME and TALENTED writer!" They work behind the scenes in the same way an editor does.

"Oh, Sherlock," John said, brushing his hair back from his face. He bent down to look into Sherlock's eyes. "Do you trust me?"
I only realize I'm staring when he lifts an eyebrow, the side of his mouth quirked up. God, he knows I've been staring and probably what I've been thinking. I flush hotly, ashamed, and turn away. I can't keep my eyes off of him for long, though, and I can see a tiny bit of pink just brushing along the sides of his cheeks and jaws.
"—the truth is I'm married."
He jerked his head up. "Yeah, I still don't get how the power can be mine when you're going to be the one whipping me with the crop," he said hotly.
"I—I'm sorry," Sherlock says, taking a step closer, but John steps back.
It takes a little over two hours to get from Baker Street to the tiny village of East Hoathly. Once they get off the M23, the rest of the drive is spent passing through one little village after another with miles and miles of farms and pastureland in between.

Sherlock wanted John to stay because he
"Fair enough. My second question—have you ever been the receptive partner in anal sex?"
I took a deep breath and tried to explain. "I turned you down because I was focused on the case, I'd only just met you, it didn't seem prudent to begin an affair with my new flatmate, and as you can see—" I gestured towards the pile of toys and rope in the sitting room. "—my tastes are unusual." I paused and made sure I was holding his eyes. "

, John thought.
John's just grateful the gift giving round robin has moved on, meaning he and Sherlock are no longer the center of attention. John takes the opportunity to elbow Sherlock playfully, but Sherlock leans over and says into John's ear, "The next time you elbow me, I'm going to grab your arm and haul you into my lap."
Sherlock didn't immediately answer. He’d rather not recount those months after his breakup with Soren, entertaining the hope of a reconciliation every time Soren called and asked to see him.

The glossy black door opens to reveal a crowd of people smiling expectantly at the car. Two girls who don't even look old enough to have started uni push through the crowd and one of them rushes down the steps to the car. John has a few seconds to register that she and the other girl are twins before she's yanking Sherlock's car door open.

is. Before he can discern for himself, the car is pulling into a circular driveway. He can feel as well as hear crushed gravel beneath the car's tires.
"Yes, actually, I am," Sherlock says, completely unrepentant of his impatience. "John and I have things to do."
"Okay, um," Audrey said after a moment, looking frustrated with his hostility but determined to put up with it. "I was wondering if you might stop by Sherlock's flat?" When John didn't say anything, but indicated with raised eyebrows that she should continue, she actually gave him a shaming look. She sighed deeply and continued on. "He's not doing very well, and I think a visit from you would cheer him up."
He let himself fall apart for one minute—sixty seconds—he counted them out in his head—and then he dropped his keys and his phone on the floor next to his briefcase. With only his wallet in hand, he fled out into the chilly London afternoon, that same voice in his head screeching at him to
All the cacophony that had been filling John's head since that awful day suddenly quieted. Since he'd discovered Sherlock's betrayal, there had been a nasty, hateful voice that had spoken up whenever he thought about Sherlock. He hadn't challenged it, had felt it was righteous and would protect him from Sherlock.

John didn't know how to make Sherlock understand what it had felt like, to be terrified beyond reason that the man you loved and were beginning to think loved you back had purposefully put himself in danger of being

My bow skips gratingly across the strings, sour notes making me cringe, as my mind conjures the image of John's hands spreading my arse cheeks to—
Sherlock lay on the sofa, brooding over this morning's argument with John. In addition to ruining a perfectly good after-case shag, the fight had left Sherlock with another problem—a much,

My point is that I could've satisfied y'all sooner if I'd found it sooner, but this chapter was already pretty smoking hot, but didn't include the rimming, so I ended up squashing the one I'd already written to the one I'd already written, um, already? Anyway...other than some filling in and a cursory run through the spell checker, this isn't edited and has not been Jenn'd or Katie'd either so you'll doubtless find split infinitives and run on sentences and other horrors besides. Hopefully, the rimming makes up for it.

"With
. He'd attempted to phrase this question in his mind numerous times, looking for the one that sounded the least pathetic, but now faced with the opportunity to speak, all his practice abruptly fled.
"Daddy!" Louisa cried joyfully when she saw Sherlock.
"Yes, although given time, I could probably—" There Sherlock lost his train of thought because John was fitting their mouths together again. Their lips moved against each other, all sloppy and wet. Sherlock pulled away and said, "I want—" but John stole his words, his tongue licking along the seam of Sherlock's mouth. Their bodies were pressed right up against each other, but their clothes seemed unusually bulky. Sherlock scrabbled underneath John’s jumper searching desperately for skin and encountering the shirt beneath instead. With a growl of frustration, he yanked John’s shirt out of his trousers and splayed his hand flat at the small of John’s back, triumphant.
Nonetheless, he caught up to three older women wearing oddly cheerful colors, and he could automatically tell they were wealthy. They greeted and began merging with a group of nervous and more soberly dressed women, some of them teenagers, and all of them with the twitchy and vigilant eyes of someone suffering PTSD. Just like with the older women, John could tell that

past her and Agnes, and didn't stop even when Mrs. Hudson squawked at his rough retreat, and called after him, missing his arm by inches. He hurried as fast as he could down the aisle towards the back of the church, and the front doors, and freedom.
"Hi," he whispered when Sherlock looked down at him. Sherlock automatically returned John's soft smile. John took his hand and turned, leading him to his own sofa. He pushed at Sherlock's shoulders and Sherlock landed with a

"Only one other time, a couple of weeks ago when I went to visit Louisa."
John's eyes widened with alarm.
John laughed—it was an ugly laugh—and turned to Sherlock. "I suppose that makes me the mistress? Is there a masculine form of mistress? Lover, I suppose. Although that makes it sound too,
Sherlock stared at the floor, wringing his hands. "I've been an absolute shit father the last month."
John hissed and drew away, stealing his triumph before he’d been allowed to savor it. "Your hands are bloody freezing," John chided.
My command center on the sofa was meant to make him think I was delving deeply into the case, but I wasn't. I'd already completed what I could for the case in the cab. I'd sent a text to the only two people from the club who I could trust to keep their silence—Geoff, my occasional lover and the sub I did most of my scenes with; and Oasis, the co-owner of The Red Hand, the woman who taught me how to be a Dom. I included a photo of the victim, and asked them to get back to me if they knew anything about her or who she spent time with at the club.
I tear my mind away from those thoughts.
Don't let the name throw you off. The Holmes siblings birth order is: Mycroft (age 40), Sherrinford (age 38), Sherlock (age 33), Eurus and Charysa (twins, age 18)

John picked up again with deeper, but slower thrusts, ones that didn't press directly on Andrew's prostate. He'd achieved a humming state of pleasure, and he felt like he could go all night. "How many times can you come like that?"
. He'd just fucked her in the bed he shared with John! He'd have to wash the sheets and take a shower to get the smell of sex out of the flat. He was angry—at her, at himself, at John.
I get to my feet. "You met someone," I say, trying for uninterested, but my voice wavers.
"John, it's Mycroft," the familiar voice said.
Sherlock set the glass of water down on the dresser while John hovered in the doorway, waiting for Sherlock to turn on the light. The click of a lamp switch was immediately followed by the buttery glow of dim light. Sherlock watched John blink as his eyes adjusted and when those eyes landed on him, Sherlock felt it under his skin; a half-nervous, half-anticipatory itch. Sherlock's name left John's lips on a sigh and Sherlock, no longer hesitant, reached out and grabbed John by both elbows and propelled their bodies together.
"This is Sherrinford," Sherlock then says, turning John towards the woman standing next to Mycroft. She's got beautiful auburn hair, cut short, that curls like Sherlock's. Her hourglass figure draws John's eyes and he relies on two decades of training to keep his eyes on her face and not stare at her breasts.
This chapter got too long, so I split it into two. I'm not finished writing the 2nd part and now that it has become chapter 7, it will be posted on August 16th. The number of chapters has gone from 8 to 9 accordingly.
"Ready?" I asked, but didn't wait for him to nod before I landed the first swat.
John obeys and finds a laptop box—a Macbook, to be precise. "Is it actually a Macbook?" John asks nervously.

"Just, maybe just a finger?"
, Mycroft had said.
"Oh, I do," I said, my voice low as arousal started to pulse through my body at the challenge. We held each other's eyes. "John," I husked. "Come stand in front of my chair." When our staring contest continued without anyone moving, I dropped my head back and groaned. "Oh, come on, John, I just want to kiss you."
"I'm just—the whole idea is nerve-wracking, all right? And why does he have to be so bloody secretive?"

Sherlock's only worth lay in his reproductive ability. After this stunning realization, he put his foot down and made it clear to his parents that he had no interest in marrying now, maybe not ever, and they couldn't make him do it, either, seeing as how arranged marriages were no longer the done thing.

"Is this about your divorce?" Louisa asked before Audrey had even sat down.
The John Donne poem referenced in "In the Mid-Midwinter" is basically about death, darkness, etc. St. Lucy's Day is the shortest day of the year, that is, "the midnight of the year." It's about mourning the death of the beloved; the lover left behind might as well be dead, too. He certainly

"Thank you," John said, a look of surprise—and
Geoff jerked his head back and stared at me with playful eyes. "
John shrugged, one corner of his mouth lifting. He looked up at me, and said, "Maybe," playfully drawing out the word.
"A Dom?"
"I have a dog, too, so we'll have to introduce her to Toby on neutral ground," John said, pulling Sherlock against him, running his fingers along Sherlock's shoulders, down his arms. He clasped their hands together. "I don't have steady work hours. I travel. I'm a closet malcontent. Well, I'm also a closet optimist, so—" John's smile dimmed, his face solemn and almost—angry? No, that wasn't—it was

Sweet potatoes are still something of a novelty in the British Isles and I've been crazy about them since I first tasted one a couple of years ago. Once he takes a bite, I ask him, "What do you think?"
Except Sherlock apparently finds great joy in keeping John in the dark and watching him scrabble to catch up. Sherlock likes to remain unknowable while flaying John and watching greedily as his secrets spill out. Sherlock, the man who John is painfully, hopelessly in love with, never wanted John to meet his family in the first place. That family has led John along on a happy little trip down wish fulfillment lane, encouraging him to hope that Sherlock felt the same as he, that John's happily ever after was within reach if he'd just give up

think of Mycroft during sex.)
That evening, Sherlock after he left the Powis Square house, he dragged his feet on the way to Baker Street. Sherlock was loathe to walk into the flat knowing John's absence would be felt too keenly, so he had the taxi driver drop him off at Regent's Park. He bought a pack of cigarettes from the newsagent's and smoked while he walked home. It was almost eight, and Sherlock had checked his mobile far too many times already. There were no messages from John, and Sherlock considered it unlikely there would be. For the time being, he would give both John

men, also with high libidos, This, of course, led to many opportunities to glut myself on sex.
"About nothing," John adds, giving her the stink eye.
By stages, Sherlock wrapped him up in his arms and laid them down, and eventually, John's head was stuffed into Sherlock's neck and Sherlock's face was pressed against John's head and he repeated
"I'm going to fuck you," Sherlock says, the softness of his voice a contrast to the harshly commanding vulgarity. His face seems to crumple on itself as though he might cry, and John raises a hand to his shoulder in comfort. "I want you

him, and that he both loved and hated that John was able to do those things.
. You're the most amazing mother I've ever had. Come along, John," Sherlock says as commandingly as ever, but instead of John having to rush after the swinging skirt of Sherlock's coat, it's Sherlock's hand at the small of John's back pressing him forward, towards the navy-blue carpeted stars. As they climb each step, John can feel the wool cloaked front of Sherlock's chest brushing against his back. An erotic thrill shivers through John's body at the thought of Sherlock crowded up against him like that. Sherlock's hand never leaves the small of John's back, not as they follow the plush navy carpet down a dark paneled hallway, nor as they enter a set of double doors that opens onto a small sitting room. In fact, Sherlock doesn't step away from John until there's a knock at the open door and Sherlock greets the young woman (presumably Jenny) who pushes in a cart laden with an impressive tea service. John's stomach growls.
“Pardon?”
“Deduce the film. There’s supposed to be an element of surprise, you know.”
“No, you’re not.”
, breathing deeply of John's scent. John couldn’t help the soft moan that escaped his lips. Sherlock mouthed wetly at John's erection for a moment before shucking his pants as well.
“Tempting,” John replied, bringing Sherlock out of his thoughts, “but let’s save that for sometime when you really bugger things up.”

“Finally!” Sherlock bounded from the stoop and started jogging blindly down the street as he typed out a mystery text.
He’d missed this.
“You do?”
“With someone important’s baby – someone who would be compromised if she were to give birth.” Another nod from Sherlock. “The pimp?”
"Yes," Sherlock hissed as the leather grazed the sensitive skin where John had slapped him. "Captain."
“Not tired.”
“Who’s Danielle?”
With a sudden stroke of genius, John reached over and threw the volume up on the radio. As
Mrs. Hudson!"
“Why would I want to talk about it?” John felt very tired, but they had to keep working. Rosie would be coming home tomorrow and they needed to do what they were going to do before bringing her back into the flat.
“You’re very kind. But I’ll keep the clinic on standby, just in case.” He smiled at that as she stepped out of his arms and opened a drawer to her right. It was filled with the oddments of a typical suburban kitchen ‒ soy sauce packets, measuring spoons, keys which belonged to unknown locks, unopened straws, and of course the tin opener. She dropped the utensil back in and dug around for something else as John tended to the cooker. “John? Are these yours?” There was a hint of laughter in her voice and John turned, intrigued.
"Sink," Sherlock nodded quickly toward the wash station by the door. Immediately, John spotted a bottle of hand lotion - a necessity when one washed their hands as often as doctors and scientists - and grabbed it up. Dropping the lotion onto the table next to Sherlock, John whipped his belt free from its loops and started on his fly.
"What?"
"That is what 'us' means." John gave him a
"Foxtrot," Sherlock replied. He was trying not to look down at John, but the smaller man could see that his mouth had softened with a repressed smile.
“I’ve kept stranger hours in your company,” John didn’t answer, still smiling gently.
(See the end of the chapter for
." he finished with a growl and John had to force himself not to moan himself.
“That’s not what this is about –”
Both of John’s hands were clasped in a fist around the handle of his revolver and he brought them down swiftly over the second man’s extended forearm. The man grunted in pain and John punched him in the side of the head with his left hand. Spinning against the wall, the man dropped his own gun from his unprepared hand and John dragged him to the ground by his collar.
"… Ravenclaw."

“God, yes,” Sherlock groaned and the deep timbre of his voice sent a shock straight to John’s prick.
The offices were busier than usual, so Sherlock went in alone and left John waiting on the pavement. He took out a short advertisement which read, “Bon voyage to N.S.C. en route to N.Y.C.” The notice would run with a little illustration of a boat to catch Brook’s attention, given that it would otherwise be minuscule in the packed lines of newsprint. Sherlock paid for his advert and made his way back out to the courtyard with a bit of a proud swagger.
“People like you have no imagination.”
She was in fine form - refusing to get dressed, refusing breakfast, refusing to brush her teeth, refusing to
"Jesus, Sherlock, you are a magnificent slut, aren't you?" Sherlock nodded slightly, his mouth being too full to reply, and grunted in assent. John swung the crop down in a swift X formation, catching both of Sherlock's cheeks in rapid succession, but yanked Sherlock's head backward from his cock before he could swallow again. He looked up at John with eyes so full of lust he looked almost sleepy. Or at least, he would, if not for the wet redness of his lips and the panting of his breath. "I am going to take you home and fuck you until you beg for mercy."
Taking the photo, John felt some of his anger melt away. “Thanks, Sherlock. This will be helpful.” The fact that Sherlock had thought to aid John rather than mock him showed signs of great personal growth. “Anything else?”
