“I’m here, dad”
His cries quietened after a while, but Tony can feel Steve hand still wrapping his waist, even when Steve started to dozed off. Carefully, he wiggled but Steve stirred and started to woken up.
“yeah, that. No. That's not how quantum physics works.”
“thank you, Tony. For all this. Um… if it’s okay with you, maybe we can grab coffee sometime”
“the wife got treated here.”
“Tony, Boy you never clean” Sarah hid her smile and pick one cupcake “this is really good”
“Doctor Odinson have emergency surgery and you’re the only orthopaedic attending on call”
“you don’t have to feel pressured in here alone, you can go and be happy. We want you to be happy to”
“what do you mean, Nat?”
“that is rude, Tony” Carol shakes her head
Tony touch the edges of the dog tags on his neck, tracing the name molded on the plate “just so you know, I am not giving this back, you can’t make me. So I am going to asked again, are you sure about this?”
“she’s strong, like her Nana” Tony winked at her
“can I sign her cast?” the kid, Little Rogers asked, a marker ready on his hand
“gosh you stupid fuck” Tony hugged him again, hand wrapped tighter on his shoulder
“he did, I just being polite and let it slide. I even let it slide when he smacked my ass. I’m generous like that”
“Who told you that?” Tony looked so Surprised when Steve called his name “I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight at all”
He held his wrist writhing in pain
“Tony” Steve called him “we need your advice on something, can we come in?”
Steve gulped before he speak “you… you look great”
“what could happen if you stayed?”
“no, it’s the front gate”
“do me a favor, open the portal to Avengers compound and send Morgan to James Rhodes before we open the door”
“so, that time stone dude”
“oh fuck”
Steve standing in front of their old shared bedroom. Boxes in corner gathering dust and furniture covered in sheets. He took the covers down and open the drawer, his heart sank when he saw his old dog tag inside the drawer. Pocketing the dog tag, he moves forward to the box in the corner, finding his old sketchbook. Flipping the pages to find his drawings of tony in his workshop, the team playing games, and DUM-E on Santa’s hat. Feels like ages ago, He turned when he hears sounds behind him, the same little girl with brown hair and blue eyes looking back at him.
“gosh I’m a mess.” Steve rubbing his face with his palm “I haven’t been able to concentrate at my work since yesterday. We were about to pitch new design when I got the call” Steve grabs another container and start eating next to him.
“I saw that. Even Nat”
“Mo… Morgan?”
“daddy!” the hologram of her daughter shrieked
Steve tried to hide his delight when he saw Tony’s face
Steve hand roaming his face checking for bruises and scratches and hug him again. Tony looked at him letting out the breath he didn’t realised being hold
“drama queen” Steve chuckled “I spoke to Bucky the other day. He told me he was trying to make amends with you”
At some point Tony managed to guide Steve to sit on the edge of the bed with hand still shielding him from everything. Right now, it just them. No grieve, no one is leaving, and no one dies. It just them both, the way they used to be.  Where everything used to be simpler and easier. The way they used to loved and be there for each other.
“Yeah buddy, I missed you too. How’s the squirrels on the park? Did you catch them?”
“want to sit next to your dad?” Steve moved her to the couch next to Tony, Morgan waved at Helen
The man went back to the bed to grab his jacket and stethoscope before open the door again and following the intern,
“she missed you” Steve also looking at her, sitting next to Tony’s bed “she wrapped everyone under her fingers”
“hey Steve did you see – OH MY GOD I AM SO SORRY”
“not dead?”
Steve just laughed at the comment and bend for a quick kiss before fishing out his keys from his jacket. “I should remind you. He’s not quite friendly with strangers. He might bite you” and he open the door to his apartment, greeted by brown furry dog wagging his tails and barking at the door. “Tony, meet Dodger. Dodge, this is Tony. Don’t bite him” he points his finger to the dog.
“hey kid, how are you feeling?” Steve moved to sit next to her bed, Tony standing next to her checking her vital
“oh, dear lord. Tony need to stop blaring that filthy rock music so loud”
“i’m working on it. I can’t just turn off insecurities in one night”
“Bruce, breathe… slow down, what’s happening?”
“It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.”
“See, even this third wheel agrees” Steve points at the dog on his lap
Leaving the boy flushed and looked away and her daughter close her eyes dramatically and sighed “eew kissing”
“better hope she wont jumped on a grenade in the future”
“it wasn’t like that”
Steve clenching his jaws “Well, that didn't work out, did it?”
“there’s human on landing zone, should I shoot them dead?”
hell”
“well, I got good kid”
“how are you my baby girl?” she ignoring the man and checking the chart “she’s allergic to penicillin and looking by the punctured wounds I think we need to prep her to surgery to fix the broken bone. I will book the OR”
Tony took last glance at his bedroom, since Siberia he can’t sleep in their shared bedroom.  he put all of Steve belonging inside the box in the corner, his clothes, toothbrush, half used cologne, sketchbooks. He opened his nightstand drawer, grabbing the flip phone and the letter. The dog tag sat next to the phone, picking out the tag, brushing his thumb. He hesitates at first, but he finally put the dog tag back to the drawer and exit the room.
“I did not lose him per se, he’s evolving, you know, like… almost a normal person. Emphasis on almost. I mean he did kind of-”
“you were hopped up on sedative. But you made it clear you didn’t want anything to do with me beside anything related to Morgan’s. I was so relieved you’re including me in her life, that as the world's leading authority on waiting too long, I can’t bring myself to care. I mean, even if we don’t get back together, I will still love—mmph!”
Stephen Strange lift his hand and open the orange circles, Tony grabs the protesting kid on his arms and alerting F.R.I.D.A.Y on his glasses
Tony trace the dog tag with this thumb.
“at first I was afraid he might leave me for you. I know your history together. No one can compare to you. Especially me, it’s a miracle we ended together in the first place. I’m still convinced someday he will leave me again for you”
“It was nothing”
“I’m sorry”
“LOKI!! LOKI!”
“tired. And the drawing on the cast is gone, can you draw it again?”
"You know how you always want to date someone better than your ex?" he whispered to Nat
Tony just sit alone at the office, ignoring the familiar dejected thump that’s been haunting him for the last few hours, ruefully watching Bucky’s interrogation from the screen. He slides his hand back to the pocket on his trouser felling the cold surface of the dog tag, holding it tightly with his fingers.
“I’m not” Tony says quietly “I swear. I just… it felt peaceful, it’s like a pause. I… I needed that, lately”
“Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.”
Bucky just shrugged at the comment, hands still on Morgan’s ear, both men ignoring her little whine
“I will book the room and start prepping” Sarah moved and tried to grab the chart before being stop by Tony
“you figure it out in a week? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.”
“ok, intern number two, walked me through”
“Wait, he lived in New York?”
side of the bed. Leaving him no space to sleep. And Tony is not helping either by how he sleeps spread eagle and hogging most of the space in bed.
“They look happy. I thought… I thought looking at her would feel like a punch in a gut.  Like a reminder of what could have been. But all I felt was sadness, but also relieve. Like a weight being lift up from my shoulder. It’s like I finally having –“
should be so lucky to have you. You get past of Pepper, Obie, you even past that stupid Ty. You can get past him. Maybe not now, maybe tomorrow, the point is you can, and you could. And like in the 80’s I will help you kick his ass when I see him. Well maybe I will need the suit since..” Rhodey point on his legs “but you know what I mean”
Tony sit on the bottom of his pool, crossing his legs and let the underwater ambient noise flows. it was oddly soothing, and peaceful.
“I would appreciate for you to not cursing in front of young ears”
“oh fuck, not again” Tony grunt and closing his eyes trying to focused and counting his breathing keeping his sudden panic attack at bay.
“Not much, took Dodger to the park. He barks at Great Dane twice his size, I had to apologize to the owner repeatedly because the Great Dane barks back and they were scaring the kids nearby. And he also tried to chase a squirrel. Not his best day”
“I’m still the head nurse, I can make attendings clean beds for one week”
“Fri, alert Rhodey about The Boss Baby Protocol, told him to take care of her while we handle the situation in the city. What am I looking at here, girl?”
“well look at that” Tony smiled at the sonogram picture and put his hand against his abdomen “we will be alright, Jelly Bean. I got you”
“what did you do?”
Steve moved closer to his bed to nudge Dodger away to their foot side. Dodger wakes up and let out a growl, showing his fang at Steve, not letting the man comes near Tony. “Shut it, Dodge. Don’t wake him up” Steve hissed and scowling at how protective his own dog to his boyfriend. Grumbling at the dog “you don’t even look at me like that anymore, you traitor”
“Tommy got cast on second grade, will she have one too?” the boy
“Tony, what is going on here” Steve looking at the mess in the kitchen, frosting and sprinkles scattered on the table, floor and some of the pans hanging on the wall “how did you got sprinkles on your hair” he pinched his fingers on Tony’s hair picking up the sprinkles
Steve just smiled and slide his hand on Tony’s waist, kissing the man deeper when suddenly he jolted up and feel some sharp teeth on his toe.
When everything seems not working and when they almost given up, orange portals starts appearing, one by one everyone is back.
“Dr. Stark I am so sorry, but there’s patient in the ER and I need some consult”
The dog barking at the screen, long tails wagging happily at Tony.
“Hush Peter, let them be” Sarah Rogers nudged Peter and still staring at the two dancing in the kitchen
“Mr. Stark, why do you have a swear jar?”
“Tony, it’s the middle of the night, what’s wrong?”
“ooh… okay”
“Tony, Tony, Tony!” Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.
“no one asked you to look, Tony”
“What can I say. Unlike Bucky, I’m loveable” Tony got up and pulled Steve closer and kiss his lips before dragging their bodies to the couch.
“yeah, you need to always have a can in case of emergency, hurry up chicken little. Things get little dicey here”
“I won’t, I promise”
They way Bruce shoving the bench in anger and Clint screaming, Steve just can’t hold it anymore, he excuses himself and rushed back to his room. He needed to be alone. He stands on his room, pacing in circles.
“shh… it’s ok. I’m just going for a moment real quick, I’ll be back. I promised”
“why she called you Steve?” Helen sits next to her, letting the toddler playing with the stethoscope on her neck “did she knows you the other-“ Helen stop at the hand signal Steve give her
The elevator ride is long, bumpy and Tony can’t stand the odd look the lady giving them both. Stepping a foot shielding Steve, he raised his head and glaring at the button in front of him. Dashed out of the elevator he faced Steve for the last time and wave him good luck.
“just Steve is fine” Steve took a seat next to him on the couch “how is she?”
“hey hey, Tony, look at me” Steve hold Tony face in both of his hand guiding him to his face “you did nothing wrong, ok. Nothing is wrong with you. It’s not your fault”
“right… I, um…” Steve gulped and scratching his head, biting his lips
one more chapter to go!
“fine, I’ll go. No more misbehaving” he begged his daughter
“what do you mean?”
“I’ll take her to bed. You should shower, you stink” She scrunched up her nose, Morgan giggled and mimicking her, scrunching up her own nose to Steve
He throw the dog tag to the table, it bounce next to the shield. Grabbing the shield handle he slams the dog tag “Well. So. Was. I” banging the shield to the table and by the fourth knock his hand slipped and he accidentally slammed his own left fist to the table
“I’m stuck in my hotel room for another three days, Steve. it’s not like I can teleport to Brooklyn in second” Tony laughed at the empty chair on his phone when a shadow of brown and white appears on his screen “oh hi, Dodge. Hear you’re a menace today.”
“I didn’t see you complaining before” Steve bite his inner cheek “sorry, that was…”
“I’m sorry Tony, hate to break up the set.” Steve put the pen down and leave the room
Tony loosen his tie while Thaddeus Ross keeps yelling on his phone. Pacing and Ignoring the look Natasha give him when he left the room. Shirts unbutton and messed up gelled hair half ignoring the fuming shouts from the phone.
“What are you talking about? Where are we going?”
“hush boy, don’t say that. Come on, now” inhaling a deep breath she grits her teeth and glaring at the blinding OR lamp. She let out a breathy prayer when Tony Stark and Carol Danvers walked out from the room.
Steve stopped when he hears a kid stop running and staring at them. A confused little girl with puffy blue eyes staring at him. Sharing the same confused look, unable to turn away his gaze from the little girl in front of him
“ah… ah… ah…” Tony waved his fingers “you know the rule, no –“
“You find him, and you put that on. And you go hide.”
Steve?”
“that I agree” Tony grins
“contractor, right?”
“really now? How long I was out?”
“Ah, please hold.”
“daddy” the little girl running towards him
“well, I supposed so, although I’m not sure if I was the Yoko, I mean if you think about it…”
“well, it’s only cupcake. But I love you too, Steve Rogers.” Tony stand on his tiptoe kissing the blonde
“I’m not saying we’re going to instantly become BFF. Braiding each other hairs and talked about boys every night, but I will try my best become civil. We might avoid each other for a year or two, but I think Morgan needs another uncle who spoiled her.”
“will auntie Nat come pick me up too?”
“That's cold.”
“dully noted Boss”
“I know. That’s why every morning from now, I will tell you that I’m in love with you. I’m choosing you. Leaving you was the biggest mistake I ever made and I will never leave you again. Maybe someday you will have enough of me and taking Morgan away with you, but I want you to know, I will still love you”
“really? Your grandma works here? What’s her name?” Tony asking the little girl again
is right” Peter mumbled under his breath
“Tony, we have a problem.”
“how did he managed to keep this from public?”
… That guy went to space! And this stupid Boss Baby Protocol technically means I’m in charge so yeah, I’m telling you now. You have a daughter and I could really use your help. I don’t know if Tony are coming back or he also turn into ashes. I don’t know what to do with kids, I once gave my 3 years old nephew money to stop crying, he didn’t stop crying and refused to give me back my money. Oh my god I need to call my mom.”
“she’s perfect, it’s all yours”
“bye kid” Steve just waved and looked around his room again
“Well, no offense to Dodger, but he’s not really my type. Wrong species and all.” Tony grins “not to mention that I’m already spoken for, thank you very much.”
“Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism of yours. There's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute… what did you called it again?”
is what you’re calling America's ass, you should see him in the stealth suit I made him”
“oh this is nice”
“I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.”
“no one like smart ass F.R.I”
“yeah, I’m fine I’m just… you have a kid?”
Tony got side tracked when he saw the 2012 Steve Rogers walking in his suit
“ouch” Tony winced and glared at his intern who might or might not be letting out a snort and covering it with small cough “she got open ulna fracture. I think she’s allowed to curse”
“we weren’t speaking in two years, I wouldn’t  hold my hopes up”
“I am” Scott managed to grab Natasha forgotten sandwich next to Morgan’s
he tried to focusing his eyes showing a shining blonde woman staring back at him
Steve Rogers didn’t recognize the tone at first two rings, he almost dropped the phone when he finally realized where the sound came from. Hand shaking, mind blank and didn’t know what to do, he flipped the phone and answering the call
“I guess it’s too late to suggest moving to the moon now, huh?”
“wow, you’re a champ” he hid his amused smile “are you the parent?” Tony looked at the woman next to her, furiously typing at her phone
“you miss me?” she let out a slight smile “Do I need to call Helen?”
“can we see her now, Doctor Stark?”
“it’s been rough five years, I know. We thought you were gone”
“maybe. I’m done waiting. Nat once told me to get a life, so I did. I want you. It’s always you. I love you, Tony Stark. I love our daughter. I’m not letting you go anymore” Steve grab his fingers. Kissing his fingertips, and let out his shit eating grins when the machine attached to Tony start beeping again “I like this machine”
“Is... is that Axe body spray?”
“he’s coming”
“you could be happier. I can help to explained it to Morgan. She’s a big girl, she can handle adult stuff” Tony need to admit, this is harder than he expected. “I’m tired. Hating you is exhausting. I don’t want to do that again.”
And he goes back to sleep again
“I’m not sure my face is the first thing he want to see when he woke up”
“he’s married, Danvers”
Steve heart sank, remembered what Happy told him
“there you are, I was looking for you. oh Cap, you’re here... hi” Happy panting and reached for Morgan
“so, who do we talked about this?”
.” Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve's hand. “Here, take this.”
Nat is alive!! i need her to be alive
“how is she?” the father all but jumped from the seat
Thanos is dead. We won.
“we know” his mom and his son said in unison.
But why did it feel like losing?
“Papa got me ballet shoes. I’m going to be ballerina like auntie Nat”
“well, we’ve been having a thing for a moment here might need a while”
“I’m sorry jellybean, but we need to go back to work, we will talk to you later for bedtime story yeah?
Poor Steve! Already having the biggest headache of his life…
Turning to the grave of the poor idiot who angered Steve, Tony nearly flinched when he read the name on the headstone… Oh my God… No, no; just no! Why the fuck are they standing near Stane's grave? Wasn't that bastard ash right now? Tony was sure he paid for Stane to be turned into ashes and be dumped into a pig's pen! "Oh, no, nope, nada, yadda, I'm outta here, sorry, but nope!" Tony stated, slipping out of Steve's arms as he tried to make a run for it, only to let out a squeak when Steve pulled him back by his jacket suit and throw him over his left shoulder like a sack of potatoes, the metal arm holding him tightly was the only reason Tony didn't thrash and was content with holding his breath in fear… Tony knew that this date was a bad idea! He knew he will die on this day!
Blond hair, blue eyes, and a stubborn persona that could go for miles, with a sense of justice that was out of the world; a dark part of Fury stated as he took the Omega in, causing the Alpha to stop in his place momently, and stare at the distance with a faraway look in his eyes. There was only one person who fit the Omega's description, one person who died a long time ago, taking with him a close brotherhood and a friendship. It can't be though; it just can't be, especially when that clan was wiped out a long time ago, leaving Fury to brave the sea in search for ghosts that had long since parted to Valhalla.
"Hey, let's take you to your room, you can sleep if you want, it will make the pain go away." Steve said gently, making sure to keep his voice down, the Alpha only blinked at that and turned to Steve like only now he realized that Steve was in the same room with him, something that the Omega didn't blame the Alpha for knowing that he had a tough time already, Steve was able to lead the man to his room and put him to bed, he was finally able to breathe, the whole journey Steve had to support the Alpha's weight, and the man was not small at all, and not to forget how the man kept staring at his face nonstop, which did make the Omega a little uncomfortable. After making sure the Alpha was situated on his bed, in a dark room, he left the Alpha to sleep, taking his phone out and sending a text to Tony, informing the man to go to the drug store and bring medicine for migraine, hoping that James will wake up without pain…
"Natasha broke my phone." Steve waved his hand after he entered the office making Peggy give a tired groan at that…
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluff, horror elements, we got to meet Pepper and Rhodey! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Thor shivered in his place in the gym, he still remembered Steve's face when it twitched into that scary terrifying face, and he hoped that he wouldn't see that face ever again in his life, it was true that the thunder loved Steve dearly, for the man strangely reminded him of his home in a way, but the thing, is ever since Loki dared to come to Midgard, Thor felt like his life was hanging by a thread, not a feeling the man liked or wanted to feel like ever again, but once again, Thor could do nothing but grimace at his luck and the dark fate Loki seemed to have sent him to.
The day Antonette died, was the day Thor son of Odin was born the heir of Asgard and the nine realms, that day all the stars were looking at Asgard, waiting with patience to hear the heir's wails, that day every star in the universe turned to Asgard with happiness, only Steven, his eyes never strayed from Midgard as he saw his beloved body hit the ground and for her neck to break, but what made a shiver shake him in his astral and real form was something different completely, because on the plan Titan one of Saturn moons, he hears a child's wail, as his mother was about to kill him but was stopped by her husband…
The woman sighed and shook her head looking at the boy with a small smile. "Just like your mother, I swear, come on now, your Mommy called, he is home." Tony looked at the pup that lights up like a Christmas tree when the woman told him about his mother. "I'm sorry if he causes you trouble, Mr. Stark." The woman said which made Tony turn to her.
"Steve!" Steve could only hear Tony's terrified scream of his name followed by the sound of the repulsors firing before Steve realized what Nebula did… she had activated a portal… as much as Steve wanted to know how she did that without the Space Stone or the Bifrost consent, Steve thinks he knew the answer, especially when he felt the Scarlet Witch's tainted magic coming from the portal… a bending spell that force the Bifrost to open without its guardian's consent…
"That… that… No! I wasn't even informed of these rules, so it meant they are null!" Tony nearly screamed, desperation and shock taking over him leaving his legs shaking in their place, how in the hell did this happen? How did Steve mess up so badly as to not inform him of this? How did Tony fucked up so badly that he ended up agreeing to marry an Addams? Tony should have known not to go to the cemetery; it was a bad, bad idea!
Natasha hummed to herself as she switched the lights, grumbling when the lights flickered on and off, she is so going to have a talk with Stark about how to maintain his house. The storm raged loudly in the background, but the redhead didn't give it that much thought, going to the fridge with a hum, pausing when she saw the shadow of a man on the wall when lightning painted the sky white followed by a clap of deafening thunder.
The noise of the cage door opening caused Steven to twist his head with a sinister frown to the man who dared to capture him, only for his eyes to widen for a fraction when he met Zola, in flesh and blood walking inside the room, with… with Bucky! Bucky who was muzzled with his mask, a rope attached to a choker that was clasp tightly on his neck, the end of the rope was in Zola's hand, Bucky who was nude from head to toe, quivering and shuddering, but staring at his feet obediently. That sight made Steven's blood pulse like magma in his body; anger darkened his eyes, specifically when he saw Zola sending him a polite smile.
"You do not understand Brother Stark, things were not always like that, he was actually… despised for centuries… by every other star out there…" Everyone can feel the shame rolling out of Thor, in waves, which made them concern. "As ancient laws have it when a new king from Asgard is born, all the stars in the universe must turn their sight to their birth, to approve of the new king, and to give him luck in his quest to kinghood…" Thor tried to explain, but his voice vanished, and in the back of his mind, he can hear his voice chanting
"Tony…" Tony answered back, pressing his lips tightly as he sat up slowly, taking Morgan in his arms preparing to make a run for it if the ghost in front of him thought about doing something funny. "And I know who you are…" Tony mumbled taking in how Steve seemed to smile happily at Tony's admission… if only he knew. "What are you doing in my house?" Tony asked finally realizing that this room was in fact Morgan's room; God what a type of stupid question did Tony ask the ghost in front of him? Of course, Steve will be haunting the place that he died in.
It has been a month since Thor left, and Tony can admit that everything was changing; for good or bad, no one knew the answer. But in all of this madness, Tony can say that all the Avengers were walking on eggshells, waiting for the right moment to either snap or take action. It was scary, it was terrifying, and Tony knew his family was taking it hard; they have the constant danger that came with their lives as The Avengers, on one hand, the Scarlet Witch on the other hand, and the threat of Thanos coming to earth in front of them. All the Avengers were between a rock and a hard place with no help in sight.
"What are you saying Pep? I am happy," Tony said making Pepper sigh at that and look at him with sadness.
"Ouch!" Bucky wince when Steve stepped on his foot the three hundred times in an hour (Steve was probably overdramatic but it felt like that to him) Steve huffed as he let go of Bucky's hands, grumbling all the way as he tried to regain his bearers, ignoring how Bucky rubbed his foot and whined to Peggy who smacked him on the back of his head and told her husband to stop acting like a child.
"Oh no honey; it's not that, no. Harley is just… Harley is just tired baby, he needs rest he will be better when he wakes up soon, it is probably the pollen, you know how sick everyone gets in the spring." Tony explained wiping Peter's tears getting a nod from the boy who was still not looking convinced at all. "He is fine, as soon as Harley wakes up, he will probably come and join us for cupcakes, he loves the blueberry muffins so save a few for him OK?" Peter paused a little before nodding his head, going straight to the cake box demanding that Steve put it on the counter so that Peter will sort them for when Harley wakes up.
"What do you mean, dear?" Serpentine asked, floating near Tony trying to look at his face, something that Tony didn't pay any mind as he took another bite of his ice cream, trying to ignore the heavy feeling in his chest. "What do you mean by those words dear? They describe my husband well, but the way you said them, stated something else." Serpentine hummed as she took Tony in before letting out a sigh and put her ice-cream tub down. "When I met Joseph, I was a fugitive who ran away from home because Mama, hated that I was fascinated with Normal People," Serpentine stated, looking at her nails that suddenly were like claws, making Tony gulp and eye them with fear. "He refused to love me if I wasn't normal like him; the forties were such a dreadful time to be an Addams; I did in the end, I tried to change who I was for him, and I suffered for three years because of that until I finally got fed up with him and killed him before he decided to target my baby next… trust me, darling, if you had told Steve to be normal for you, or accept his proposal of becoming normal… I wouldn't have let you live even if Steve begged me to let you go. Stevie spoke highly of you though, about how you kick him out when you saw what he decided to become for you." Serpentine stated, her eyes twinkling darkly, taking Tony in with equal approval and hunger for blood, something that made Tony shift in his place and swallow.
It was then that Tony finally dared to kiss him, pressing kiss after kiss on Rogers's lips, though Rogers did not return them, only tilting his head; silent and curious, and when Rogers finally started kissing back Tony couldn't help but let out a chuckle. There was something predatory in the way Rogers was kissing him, a tease and a lure and a sharp pinch of teeth. He plucks at Tony's shirt, winding his hands under the soaking cloth and savoring the touch of his bare skin, the shirt bunching up as he works his way up to Tony's shoulders. Tony should stop him… he shuddered as Rogers mouthed at his throat, he really should… Tony though, did nothing of that sort, only letting out a hum and relaxed his body into Rogers's gripe…
Peter opened his eyes and gave Tony a strange look that made Tony's breath hitches and a shiver to go down his spine. "S-so I can fin…d… Papa whe-n I leave." His baby said as he starts coughing hard making Tony's heart nearly stop at that.
"Yeah, yeah, smile all you want, you are sleeping on the couch tonight." Steve said playfully, which made the Alpha laugh at that before glancing at his watch, jumping from his chair when he noticed that it was getting late and that he needed to go to work before Howard arrived at his office.
What made Steve burn with fury was when he saw Morgan a month after the funeral coming into the HQ like she owned the place with a frown on her aged face, it made Steve so angry that the only reason she came to him was to give him an eviction order, telling Steve to order all the Avengers out of Stark's properties, Steve just held the paper for a long time reading it over and over again, he felt the shock coming from the Avengers and the recruits in waves, and anger from his friends in practical. He did nothing but rips the paper into pieces and throws it at Morgan's face, making the woman look at him with shock.
"Mr. Stark… I didn't expect I will see you here." Said a voice behind Tony which made the Omega look behind him to see Steve Rogers looking at him with a soft look causing the Omega to smile amusingly at that and shake his head a little at that.
Tony opened the door, getting inside, waiting for his friends to come in before closing the door, sheltering them from the cold. Tony smiled when he saw the awe on his friends' faces as they took the house in, he knows that the house was beautiful and homey on the inside, Peggy practically decorate the place, stating that she knows best, and she did, Peggy and her husband turned this place into heaven.
"Stane made a deal with the FBI about giving them information about Hydra in exchange for giving him a life sentence in a high-security prison, and unfortunately for us, it's not with our juristic to interfere with the FBI considering that they made a deal with him after we refused to give him one." Peggy hissed and Tony was frozen in his place, he was sure that he was not even breathing, because did he heard them right? Did they just mention Stane?
Bruce hummed for a few seconds, turning to Tony with a small smile on his face after he was done, causing Tony's heart to pound a little too loudly in his chest. "Congratulation, it's a girl!" Bruce ended up saying after taking too long to answer building in the anticipation, hearing those words Tony nearly jump from his place in happiness, hugging a squealing Pepper when she skipped toward him with a happy smile on her lips, Rhodey claps him on the shoulder, pointedly refusing to make any eye contact last Tony noticed his shiny eyes, not that Tony didn't notice, he just didn't point it out loud.
"I am truly sorry; I am doing what I am ordered." Nebula whispered before her hand snapped forward, taking a grip of Steve's left arm, as much as Steve tried to push her away, his body refused to cooperate, fighting against him after he used nearly all of his saved magic to seal Wanda's tainted one.
"I am done now." She said and it made Steven's fume that the woman had the gut to give him a smirk as she gazed at the child who turned his head to stare at her. "What is the youngster's name?" Her question was answered by a glare from the Omega, which only caused her to shrug and smile sharply at him, but Steven took victory in the way the woman's eyes were hardened with annoyance.
"Keep your head down and shut up…" Steve growled making Stane gasp at that and watch Steve with terror. Steve could hear the shocked voices behind him but Steve didn't… couldn't care, didn't care that he had to use his Alpha growl, didn't care he broke a law of not using that voice unless, in danger, he didn't because that voice was getting fainter and fainter... dying out...and Steve felt that if he was late… he would regret it… Steve let go of Stane and went under the stairs, he saw from the corner of his eyes how Fury went toward Stane looking at Steve with a furrowed brows, and lack of trust, something didn't bother him as he thought it would…
The sound of the door being knocked on made the Omega blink and look at his watch, humming when he saw that it was afternoon, which meant that the person who was at the door was Tony's brother, as no one other than the family has the key to the gates. Steve got up from the sofa and wiped his hands on his jeans nervously before he went to the door and open it with a smile, pausing when his eyes fell on the man waiting outside.
That day, Howard can say he had so much fun, he had so much fun being a part of a family that he never thought he will have a place in. it made Howard think, it made him wonder, what if he was more acceptant of the baby that Tony had, would the small boy be with them now, roughing up with Peter and planning many mischiefs together; it made Howard wonder if the last three years would have been spent here, spoiling his grandkids and being a part of a family that loved him, instead of spending it in Malibu, staying in that big and cold mansion alone, doing work and work and wallow in regret and pity.
The king nodded his head and turn to his advisors.
"This can be your room from now on." Tony said, shushing Peter gently when the boy whined and shivered in his embrace. "With the mansion being burned to dust, I think we all will move back to the tower; I will have some clothes and stuff delivered to you by night, and don’t worry about everyone, they will get over it." Tony assured, gaining a tired smile from Steve who nods off and gazes at the room like it held the entire secrets to the universe. "Steve…" Tony's voice cracked a little, causing the star to turn to him and tilt his head. "Thank you, for protecting Peter… it means a lot to me." Tony murmured, holding tightly to his baby, the fear of losing his son was too strong to let Tony rest.
"Do you know what this is Tony?" Peggy asked with happiness shining in her eyes, making the Omega tilt his head in Steve's embrace to look at his aunt and father better, wondering what his aunt was thinking. "This is the Omega's ticket for finally being free of fear! For standing up like equals without fearing that they will be taken advantage of! Tony, you granted them their freedom!" Peggy laughed, happiness radiating from her in waves, mirrored by everyone in the room, and that made Tony's eyes widen at the realization, his heart fluttered in his chest at the meaning of those words…
"Does that mean, he is my…?" The words trailed off as they left the boy, causing Howard to tilt his head as he took in the boy; the small one looks like the picture. He looks so much like the picture that Howard wanted to go to the boy and pull him in his arms, but Howard reigns himself in, he doesn't want the little one to be afraid of him because he couldn't hold himself in.
So what do you think?
Tony could only press his lips into a thin line as he gazed at Bucky doll as it let out angry squeaks as it tried to attack Tony. The man of iron could only look down at the doll as it latched itself into his leg, trying to stab him in the leg with its Shield that was made from fabric. With a tired sigh, Tony shook his leg harshly dislodging the doll from it, he then walked back inside of his workshop; signaling to his A.I. Tony gazed at the doll as it sat up and shook itself, standing up and running toward Tony, only to have the door close in the doll's face.
…" Natasha heard her name being whispered in a child's voice, which made her choke on her breath as she turned toward the door with wide eyes, only for them to widen when she saw someone standing near the kitchen's door. "
"I told you it's because of you…" Tony saw how Steve's eyes sparkled as he started, only for it to be deemed a little as he seemed lost for a second before giving a big smile. "It's because you are amazing, smart, kind, and I really like you." Steve finally said, and Tony raised his brow because that was the short vanilla speech of the day Steve confessed to him.
… thought Tony as he starts dragging Jarvis's body away. He left Jarvis in the closet upward and hoped against hope that no one was going to find him, Tony was lucky he was able to sneak into his father's office and get the mobile out. Heart hammering in his chest as he hears crashes and shouting coming from downstairs, he hopes that aunt Peggy was going to answer.
"Yup!" She popped the P which made Steven blink at her strange way of talking. "A cute little fella, who is probably waiting for me home while driving his aunt crazy, but what can I say, he is four years old." The chuckle that came from the metal creature was flat, and to say the least, granting on Steven's nervousness, because it sounded like sharp nails on a board, but the star thinks that he can feel the emotions behind those words making him smile a little. "So what's your story? Any family, kids?" She asked which made Steven shook his head at her words.
thing he is good for… please don't go back to him…" Bucky pleads, his words causing Steve to feel uncomfortable as he shifted in his place, wondering why now of all time Bucky was acting like this.
Howard could only gaze at his son; his son that looks the happiest that Howard saw, his son that Howard was sure the last time he smiled like that was when he was pregnant. Howard's eyes could only take Tony in; gazing at how happy and at ease he was, listening to him humming whatever song that was on the radio this morning with a skip in his steps. The smell of the delicious breakfast filled the kitchen, causing Howard to blink his eyes when he was thrown back into an old memory; an old memory just like this, with Howard sitting on the dining table with his newspaper and coffee, Maria standing over the stove just like Tony was, humming happily as she twirled around while preparing whatever Italian dish that she fancy that day, Jarvis as always, was shaking his head at the mess, but the smile refused to leave his face as he cleaned the dishes that Maria caused with her spontaneous cooking, and Tony, small, not older than five years being a ball of energy, does nothing but rush toward Maria and hold her tightly as he called her Mama with the biggest smile a five years old can have.
"It's simple, I can have my son, my heir, marry someone of your… background." Mr. Carbonell said which made Steve contain a hiss as he heard the older man spit the last word like it was some kind of poison.
"What? You have?" His mother squeaked at that and Tony had to hide his snort, he hides his smirk with the juice cup, his father was looking at him with narrow eyes but taking a sip out of his wine, and Angie was awing making Aunt Peggy throw a glare at her to be quite.
"Oh, what's wrong? It's just a cat." Tony said as he went and picked up the cat with a happy look on his face, that cause his Mom to nearly screaming her head off as she starts ordering him to put the cat down in hysteria fill voice.
Howard tried to shake the echo of that memory away, tried to shake the heartache away; Howard though, furrow his brows when he realized that the voice he heard calling out 'Mama' was not that of fantasy, he was sure of that, because it sounded too real, even to Howard's old ears. The answer came not a few seconds later when Howard gazed at the small boy of ten years old with a shock in his eyes.
"You know what, I'm leaving." Tony grumbled as he left Darcy heading to the infants' room, ignoring Darcy's laughter as she called him back in hope of gossiping about the Alpha that made Tony lose it like that, but Tony just rushed away, pausing before entering the infants' room before changing his way to the children's section, it was a known fact that Tony stay away from the infants' section like it was the plague, he knows that he couldn't handle seeing an infant after what happened to his, and Betty planned to make him go into the infants' section by the end of the month…
He doesn't need someone on his land, he doesn't need another person that will end up hurting him, he doesn't need someone screaming at him and saying the words
"What's wrong, Peter?" Steven asked turning to perch on Peter's other side ignoring Tony who was frowning at him with narrow eyes. "Is it because of me?" Steven questioned which made the young boy shake his head quickly, his eyes wide with disbelieve. "Then what's wrong?" Steven's soft tone caused the boy to sniff before starting to play with his hands nervously.
?" Steven narrowed his eyes at the last description, daring the king to say such a thing, which will gain him nothing but broken teeth. Injured or not, Steven refused to be lowered to such a thing, not after being forced to live like that for years because of the Hydra king.
Sighing at his silly act and hoping that no one saw, Tony leaned back, to close the door behind him and go back to the attic, planning to give Pepper a piece of his mind for giving him such a scare. The knock coming from the closet wall in front of Tony made the hair on his body stand on its ends; just before Tony backed away and called for Rhodey, Tony felt like he was pushed inside the closet hard, which made him scream, especially when his head hit the closet's wall.
"Beautiful…" Tony said under his breath which made the woman turn to look at him, making the small teen smile. "Nothing…" Tony said with a head shake, already making a mental list of the things that he needed to buy, his baby's room, his room, maybe turning one of the bedrooms into an office, or a lab? He wondered if the boathouse has a normal rowing boat or a speeding boat, thinking of all the possibility he has right now, planning to send a 'Thank You' basket to that man Philips who gave him directions to this town, a small town away from everyone, a town that probably everyone in it knows the other, and will know of any outsider coming in… a small town perfect for raising his baby... and most importantly it wasn't mentioned on any map…
"I'm sorry…" Steve whispered as he kissed the back of Tony's neck, causing the Omega to hum at that and look forward with empty eyes, which made the Alpha press his lips tightly together, kissing Tony's cheek this time, tasting the salty tears, which dried up on Tony's face, which made the Alpha give a shaky sigh.
"What a sight… I couldn't believe I will see the day that
Hope I was able to answer a few of your questions.
It took a few more minutes for his mother to calm down and when she did, Thor couldn't help but smile when he saw his mother give him a soft look. "You have grown up…" Queen Frigga whispered as she caressed Thor's cheek causing the man to let out a happy sigh for being at the end of his mother's affection. "Come, your father is waiting for us." Frigga let out a sigh as she pulled away, and Thor gave his mother a nod as he followed her, trying hard not to act like a lost lamb.
"I will kill him, that's it; I will finally do what I have dreamed of for years and kill him!" Natasha hissed, huffing and buffing until Steve sends her a teary look, begging her silently to stop because then he will start crying for real. Natasha, God bless her; realize how close Steve was to a meltdown, and calmed down, giving Steve a loving and supportive smile. "Now, let's ignore that good for nothing Alpha, which I told you not to marry. Let's talk about something more cheerful; like that hunk of a brother he has…" Natasha wiggled her eyebrows as she said those words, causing Steve to snort and give a weak laugh.
"…Like the piece of shit that you are, did he take the money or not? Answer me!" The team heard Tony's growl as they finally reached the room the screaming was coming from, the team wince as the saw the room, furniture was thrown around the place broken in pieces, the huge hole in the ceiling followed by smaller ones from Iron Man's repulsors, and there was in the middle of the mess, Howard Stark who was cowering behind his mate who was trying to calm Tony, but the Alpha was having none of that as he tried to sidestep his mother and attack the older Alpha.
We finally reached the end of the story!
The soft noise that slipped from Tony was embarrassing, his face turned red, but the gentle smile Steve sends his way was worth it, it made his heart beat with desire and hunger. Tony brought a hand up to touch Steve's cheek, to keep him steady as he leaned up to kiss the star. They stand in the middle of the dance floor, kissing over and over again until finally, they both have to breathe. Tony never felt like this before, and he ignored the murmurs and whisper around them as his eyes never left Steve who shined brightly than ever…
That was a year and a half ago when Steve was eighteen at that time. At first, the two of them just continued to talk with each other once a week, with Anthony asked about Steve's shoulder, the Alpha clearly was still feeling guilty about hurting the small Omega. Then it turned into every three days with the Alpha asking about the Omega, and what he was up too, they will spend the time talking about significant and insignificant things. Then it turned to every day, a little text here, and a call there until Anthony finally asked him out on a date after half a year Steve always teased the Alpha about that, the Alpha had been worried at first considering that he was older than Steve by ten years.
"What do you mean Steven? Hydra can't possibly be out there, I and the Howling Commandos made sure of that." Peggy said gently which made Steven turn toward her, and his eyes to soften when they fell on her figure.
…" Steve was so sure that the last word, Howard said in a whisper, but somehow Steve was able to hear it as clear as if Howard was shouting it in his ear, and Howard seemed to notice his mistake, especially when Steve's eyebrows twitched in anger. "Anyway, while you spent three days recovering, my foolish son spent that time crying and sniffling like a babe, refusing to leave your side… I expect you to have a talk with him about responsibilities later, I can't have my own son turning this useless every time something happens to you." Howard stated hotly, raising his nose in the air and turned to leave the room, causing Steve to roll his eyes at the overdramatic way Howard deal with the situation.
"It's hard to be fond of someone who brought Ragnarok with his foolish decisions and the hate he installs in everyone important to him." Steven said coolly which made the older man grip his staff tightly and for his wife's face to pale at the thought of Ragnarok being upon them because of her husband. "If you really wanted to know who I am, then so be it. I am Steven Rogers, Captain America, leader of the Avengers, vice-commander of Shield, and earth's ambassador to the New Asgard and as Thor said I am a traveler between time and space. Now we got this out of the way, I demand to see Loki, I refuse for an innocent man to suffer more than he already did because you think that being tortured and brainwashed is not an excuse for his crime." Steven said which made the room become tense especially when Odin stood up and looked down at Steven who was glaring at the older man.
"Loki!" Thor snarled as he took a threatening step toward his unfazed brother, which made Tony tense and stand in front of Steve protectively. "I swear on the Norns themselves that if this is another one of your mischievous tricks, I will throw you from the Bifrost bridge this time!" Thor growled his fists were clenched tightly and his eyes were alight with thunder, sparking and threatening as they took Loki in.
Steve finally convinced Tony to accept the pet shark after two years of going on and on about how pets are good for health. Now, the two of them are the proud owners of a shark tank with more than twenty sharks, and one of them was the same shark they found on their honeymoon (No matter what Steve's say, Tony knew it was the same shark, especially when it looked at Tony with the same puppy dog eyes as it asked for Tony to save it)
"First… first hope was going to die…" Steve said remembering the scene he saw… how Peter the kid that was full of energy and love and happiness, no older than thirteen from what he saw, rushed to save Tony, having so much endless hope that he will succeed in his quest like a knight in shining armor. "Then everyone will lose their will to live." Tony, beautiful and amazing Tony, holding into Peter tightly screaming and weeping and cursing the Gods begging for Peter's survival, but no answer came, and when he heard Bucky's voice talking to Steven, he was so broken… like he already knew that there was no hope, no way out… "It will end with death…" So twisted, that version he saw of himself that took Peter and Tony away… so twisted that its features were that of a monster, Steven even had a rough time separating his face from Thanos and death and hater.
If the queen's words were true… Anton know they were, so far the queen never dared to say something he didn't mean… not only will Anton have a reason not to tie the knot with the Stone clan, but it also meant that they were deceived by them, it was just like the mess of Stane and Brookland all over again, but this time it involved the deceive being hidden under the layers of heroism.
It ends with Steve walking on shaky legs toward Tony's room after the doctors told him that his husband was too old, that it was his time, that Steve could go and see him for one last time, Steve had to hold his sobs at that. As much as Steve didn't want, he called Pepper and Morgan in hope that the two of them will come, Tony still considers Morgan his own, even after all the pain she and her mother caused him, it made him hate them, even more, when they didn't answer.
"Commander Rogers, such an honor to meet you!" Zola declared, causing Steven to let out a grunt, his eyes refusing to leave Zola alone, following his movements like a panther watching its prey, an act only caused Zola's beam and for his smile to stretch even further. "I have to admit, I made the appropriate decision for choosing you instead of Captain Rogers; I'm pleased with myself if I may add." Zola stated and Steven nearly said screw it and smashed the chain to attack the imp in front of him, but with Bucky shaking and looking feverish he resolved not to move, seeking to assist the situation to the best of his capabilities to discover an alternative out for him and Bucky. "… After all, no one, not even a potent werewolf like the assist was able to shake off the sedative as you did, it was intriguing how you were able to wake up after two hours, most victims of the sedative regain their conciseness after three days. The next time, you woke up after an hour! I'm spectating that your body is becoming immune to it; such a fascination, I believe that's what happens when you don't have a designation to ground you is it, Commander Rogers?" Steven had missed the first part of the dialogue, not that he cared for, his body was tensing in revolt when he saw the ravenous look in Zola's eyes when he studied his body.
This amazing song by 'madsteaparty' at TikTok, one of my favorite songs of his, if you like, check out his other songs, you would find them amazing for any dark mood you have ;)
"No… it's a-about yo-ur baby." Howard said making Tony freeze at that, his grip going slack until his father's hand fell from him.
…" The lights flickered, and instead of the person standing near the door, it was halfway through the kitchen toward her, making the woman flinch and back away, her hand reaching for where she hid her gun, only to not find it, which made her whimper unconsciously. The thunder deafened her with how loud it was, and she swore she only closed her eyes for a Nanosecond, but when she opened them she saw red eyes and wide razor-sharp smile greeting her. "
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence, Tony being mean, and poor Steve! All reviews are appreciated.
After that he spent all the time he has watching Midgard, learning everything he can about the man, he learned that his name was Anton, and the place he lived in was Greece, it was strange place Anton's Greece, it was a brutal place, but at the same time it was beautiful, he learned that Anton was what they called an inventor and a philosopher, that people always whisper when he passed them calling him crazy, it was probably why he didn't have any wife or children… why he was always alone…
On the day of the appointment, Steve searched for Tony high and low, hoping to see his husband somewhere in the house so that the two of them will go to the doctor. Unsurprisingly, Tony wasn't there, leaving Steve to gaze around the place with a lost look, wondering how he will go to the appointment without Tony in sight.
So what do you think?
"Steven!" Returning back, Steven was greeted by worried Peggy who looked at his pathetic form with a worried and pale face, running in the rain would do that to anyone, especially when Steven returned wet and covered in mud from where he fell a few times while he was running.
So what do you think?
Peggy let out a hollow laugh as she leaned back on the sofa to gaze at the ceiling. "Therapy won't work Steven, it never does, and if it ever did then it will be a temporary fix, and Steve already refuses to go to it no matter how much I arranged a session for him, so this will be all for nothing." Peggy whispered as she let out a tired sigh and leaned on Steven, making the man put his arm around her and pull her in for a loose hug. "Losing someone's mate, even if it was temporary is a hell, taking another mate will never work out, if it did then the happiness will only last a decade, maybe two? Most Alphas became either abusive after that or possessive beyond imagination, always hurting their new mates and whatever pup they had, for Omegas they become depressed and suicidal not caring about their lives… I don't want that kind of life for Tony, God, his parents are rolling in their graves now for how I failed taking care of their son… they would have never let him stand in the same room as Rogers if they were here right now. God Steven why didn't you ask Tony for his permission to curt him in Asgard, then we wouldn't be in this situation at all…" Peggy said which made Steven bite his lower lip and breath harshly through his nose.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains… maybe cursing, fluffiest fluff, maybe a little sadness, Peter is cutest, and Steve being protective AF, and finally, things are looking up! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
They drove to Angie's diner, Tony smiling happily when he saw the awe on his friends' faces as they took the small town, more amazing and beautiful than even New York that Tony used to take a pride in before his father tainted that place. When they reached Angie's diner, it couldn't be any more amazing timing, considering that Tony was starving; it's a cheerful little place, with a beige brick frontage and large windows, the area around the door densely plastered with posters and adverts for local events and fundraisers. Inside the walls are painted pale blues and white, a blackboard along one side where the day's specials are scrawled. There are a few people tucked in the booths having a late lunch, eating, and chatting quietly.
Peter's voice filtered into his mind, reminding him of what his friend (Or was it brother now that Mr. Steve and Mr. Tony adopted Harley as their son too?) said the first time Harley met Mr. Tony. It was true that Mr. Tony was different than other Omegas, gentler, calming, and never gets angry, but Harley knows that it would change as soon if not before the Rogers family get tired of him than it would be as soon Mr. Steve and Mr. Tony are going to have a baby of their own.
Steve took the small present box from the table, gazing at it with a little sadness and equal part anger, wondering why Tony would lie to him after promising that he will come, and to rub the salt on the wound, the Alpha hadn't even called or sent a text to inform him that he will be late, a complete radio silence… Steve deflate like a balloon when after checking his phone for the hundred times that day, he didn't see any missing calls or texts, making the blond wonder if he should bag the dinner in the fridge, considering that he has no appetite for today has vanished.
"Stevie, Tony! You came back! That's great how did the date go?" Serpentine's voice made Pepper flinch and gaze around the place, wondering from where that voice came from, only to shriek when Serpentine passed through her and float toward Tony and Steve with a bloody grin on her face. Tony will never admit that he nearly fainted when he saw the blood drenching the front of the ghost standing in front of him; Tony still has his pride as a man to stand still and face the ghost, wincing when Pepper continued to shriek and scream bloody murder at the ghost that she was seeing.
"If you wanted to help, then I will appreciate you leaving me to my thoughts." Anton snapped, loud enough to make everyone still and gaze at the king who had a furious look on his face. "Now, if you would please be quiet, we are going to reach the hunting ground soon." Anton huffed, clicking at his horse to go a little faster, leaving Tyber behind as he tried to recover from the embarrassment not a few seconds ago.
When they finally left the basement and rushed outside, Steve saw all kinds of chaos out in the gardens of Stane's mansion. Reporters, police officers, paramedics, and people all milling out there. "Peggy!" Steve called out to the woman that was standing near one of the ambulances cars, tears streaming down her face, the sound of her name, made the woman turn around to look at Steve with a heartbreaking look, that made Steve swallow and he steeled himself. "Listen carefully Peggy, you go with the Omega, but please, hold yourself together, I will go with the pup," Steve said he felt Peggy chock on her breath.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluffy fluff! Peter being a precious bean, panic attack, maybe a little bit hurt/comfort? And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Oh, excuse me Ma'am I didn't realize, please, come in." Steve said as he led the woman to the living room, before going to prepare the beverages for his guest, wondering why the woman came here, or if Tony sent her because something happened, but the Omega shook that thought away, the woman probably wanted to see the person who was dating her… nephew?... Steve was never sure about Tony's relationship with the woman considering that the Alpha never talked about her that much and Steve only heard those snipped of information from Bucky, who to everyone's disbelief loved gossiping about everything and anything under the moon.
Though both Steve and Tony froze when they heard Peggy and Pepper's exclaims followed by Bucky's booming laughter; both of the adults looked at each other with a grimace. What made everything bearable to Tony though was the amused smile painting Steve's face as the star tried to dress without tripping trying to stop his giggling when he heard the other rushing to their room…
So what do you think?
"Who do you think you are, boy, to speak to me like that?!" Stane snarled as he threw himself at Tony, being stopped by the two Alphas that were holding him, and the Omega drew more courage from the arm that Steve put around his waist as his Alpha pulled him to his chest, making the shivers of fear that were wracking Tony stop because he now knew that Steve was there to protect him, that Steve wouldn't let anything bad happen to him.
" Steven whispered in Icelandic, which made Margaret and Philips look at him, but they didn't say anything as they huddled closer to him, some of Steven's friends, children, men, and woman who were the same as him, forced into this life, huddled and surrounded him, looking in fear at the people around them.
at being reminded of the sheer magnitude of what Steve kept from him, he can appreciate what’s being said, he knows;
“Where’s a dragon when you need one?” Clint growled, all six of them advancing in reverse, not daring to risk a blast as the villain ranted and raved.
The chance to talk is robbed from him, however, by the Avengers’ 14
The ducks lost their appeal.
He leaves the ring on til morning, when he wakes up hungover, and takes it off in disgust at himself.
“I have some phone calls to make. Tony,” she nodded at him with a smile, “Avengers,” she waved to them, and then stepped back into the elevator. Tony watched her go, and then headed into the kitchen. He intended to grab something from the fridge, but Bruce – who hadn’t been called out – pushed a plate over to him, with what they all jokingly called the Steven on it. The Steven was a foot-high monstrosity of a sandwich, designed to give Steve all the calories his heightened metabolism burnt off during callout. Tony considered a protest, but it was pointless now they knew, and happily tucked into the meal.
"Oh, I noticed alright, but he is not the one I am interested in, to be honest…" Rogers said which made Tony hum and blink at that, shrugging a little, it wasn't his fault that Barnes'll end up with a broken heart when he learns that his precious 'Stevie' was in love with another person… "You know… it takes a real man to be fearless enough to create his tomb while still alive…" Rogers said as he walked toward Tony which made the shorter man let out a confused noise at that and look up at the man who was caging him, making Tony tense. "If only you could see yourself today, wearing your own armor like a tomb, fighting for your life when any second now you will be crushed into nothing, having the strong will to go down in your armor, and not fearing the destructive power you have…" Rogers sighed dreamily at that, causing a shiver of fear run down Tony's spine as he swallows nervously… "
“What were you and Steve?” She asks, and Tony suddenly feels like all the breath has gone from his lungs. Pepper knows about the ring but has never asked, never mentioned it, never even told
Tony also remembers how that changed, that first stolen moment.
It’s the advances in science made by so many brilliant minds under one roof when Thor brings Darcy and Jane into the fold. It’s movie nights that even Dum-E loves, because he gets to use the vacuum when they cover the floor in popcorn.
His voice still shakes. The heart monitor is steady. Peter doesn’t wake.
Rhodey finds out after Afghanistan.
, finally, throws the phone. He doesn’t pause as he forces himself out of Steve’s old space to see if it shattered against the wall, the box dropped back into the drawer.
, and Tony is grinning like a fucking loon because of it.
Thor’s brother had decided to prove himself both undeniably not dead, and still the biggest fucking

, and that’s worth the universe to me. I- I’m not half as good at anything as when I’m doing it next to you. And that’s the truth. So this is my promise – that I will always strive to be next to you, and to be the man you deserve.”
So why the fuck, within 2 days of meeting, do the Avengers get labelled as hoard?
.” Tony smiled as best a dragon could, and Clint gave him a half salute, before sending another piece flying. Tony had to flap to catch that one – but he was easily getting the hang of it again, and with the fourth piece, he did a graceful spin mid-air to catch it. Thor applauded, and just like that the team were laughing again.
Bruce, the only person who was smart enough, pointed to the direction that Steve went to, causing Tony to growl madly and march forward, planning on killing Steve and end it for once and for all. Finding Steve was not that hard at all, not when the creepy dolls and shadows led him to Steve's room; let's not forget the mad cackling that was heard down the halls.
Not even ten minutes passed with Steven trying to chow his cuffs off before he felt harsh winds nearly knocking him down which made him look up with wide eyes when he saw a ship about to land, frowning when the design wasn't one he was familiar with, in any of the nine realms, which made fear size Steven's heart at the thought of falling into Thanos' hands, after all, the mad one has gone into hidden not five hundred years ago, and no one, not even the farthest stars in the universe can see him.
Natasha helped him inside of the house, as the two of them cleaned and tidy the place, as for Clint the man as it turned out shouldn't be left in the garden alone or he would go overboard… now Tony owned enough firework to last him throw autumn and Winter, and not to forget the bonfire the man did near the lake, something about roasting marshmallows and enjoying the simple life, and that ended up with Natasha and Clint bickering once again.
"Don't you think that it is a little too early to build a treehouse for a baby?" Maria asked cooing when her eyes fell on Morgan who scrunched her nose and returned back to sleep, unaware of what's going on around her.
"Yes, darling, I am back, sorry I was late but I had a lot of work to do." Steve said gentle to the boy leaning down to kiss his forehead, a woman appeared from behind the door smiling happily at Steve, but sending a questioning looks at Bucky. "Hello, May, I hope that he wasn't a little maniac when I was away." Steve said looking at the pup who giggled a little which only made the woman laugh softly at that.
Sam gave Tony a long look before a small smile took over his face as his eyes turned toward the photo on the desk. "Yes, I have a son and a daughter…" Sam said which made Tony swallow at that.
Tony felt something small sit by his side leaning on him, hugging him? It made Tony sob harder at that, he didn't know how much time passed, but by the time Tony stopped, his head was killing him, he looked to his left side to see the pup that spoke to him a while ago sitting beside him, playing with the grass with a concentrated look on his small face. "Thank you…" Tony whispered which made the small boy blink and look at Tony; the Omega had to hold himself last he cries once again, as big brown eyes were looking at Tony with so many emotions on the child's face.
"Stane…" Tony spat, trying to appear nonplussed as he gave the man a sharp smile, trying to act like he wasn't shaking in his place a few seconds ago, like he wasn't scared of seeing the man who destroyed his life with his family, the one who turned his pup's life to hell, making him fear the only Alpha who loved him and Tony unconditionally. He was the reason for the Omega's crisis for the past month… Suddenly, anger and hate replaced the fear the Omega was feeling just moments ago, making the Omega stand taller and glare at the Alpha with all he had, daring Stane to do something… That caused the man to lose the smirk, a frown taking over his face, which Tony took as a victory, and that small victory gained the Omega the confidence he needed. Tony raised his head, the picture of arrogance as he walked toward Steve like Stane didn't mean anything, like he was equal the dirt on the bottom of Tony's shoes, and what he did to him wasn't a concern to the Omega. "There you are!" Tony exclaimed happily as he held Steve tightly, making the frozen man blink at that and gaze at Tony with wide questioning eyes, wondering why the Omega was here.
"What I can say, Tony? The poor boy had it harder than even Peter when you first brought him in." Betty sighed causing Tony to frown as he realizes what she meant by that. "His father abandoned him and his mother when he was four, and his Omega mother pours all of her misplaced anger on him. Child Protective Serves took him away from her three years ago, by the time we finally rescue him he had been through ten foster homes, and half of them were as bad as his mother, as for the other half, they don't even know how to handle a child with his background." Betty grumbled, unhappy with the situation at hand, Tony was too, for his mind start going over and over many different ways to help the boy.
"So that's it, after all, that Tony did to you, you choose to ignore everything and return to him?" Bucky asked, his harsh tone made Steve pause in his place before letting out a tired sigh, wondering why now of all times that Bucky decided to bring this up.
“Why the long face? You turned him into a baby?”
“there’s no such thing as perfect parent. I get it now. Sever years and I’m still stumbling around. We would argue over small unimportant stuff, I need to tell her why I can’t buy anything she wants even though it was nothing to me to buy her stuff. No amount of money would made parenting any less hard.” Tony saw Steve signalling him from a far, giving him a thumbs up. “I think I get my father now, he did his best. Everything will be alright. Thank you– for everything– good bye.” He adds before Howard Stark get inside of his car.
“do you now? –“
“no” she laughed and waving her spoon splattering cheese on the counter
“she will, as soon as I closed the wound and fix the bone. We will get her to the OR as soon as possible, so you can wait on the waiting room”
“just move closer and close Morgan’s ears, I still can’t get up from bed”
“you use blow torch to bake cookies Tony!” Tony can hear Pepper voice on the background
“but I am happy. I got you, I got Morgan, I got Na –“ Steve stopped and tried to say her named without getting choked
“My dog loves you more than he loves me. I like to think that means we both picked the best human to love, considering animals are better judges of character than people. Marry me? or I guess
Everyone is back
“I want to protect the stone”
“I love you too” Tony smiled back and tangled his fingers with Steve’s
' once more, which did nothing but confirm the conclusion that Anton already reached but wanted to deny with every breath he had in his body…
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!" Tony couldn't help but chant under his breath, he was one second away from fainting; this was bad, so, so bad, nightmares bad, worse than his parents turning to zombies bad! Tony wondered if he can turn around and run away, but as luck will have it, Steve will probably catch him even before Tony shift a muscle.
Finally, after 84 years, an update!!!
"Out? Is that the only thing you are going to say? Out? I want to know where the fuck were you! Calling me over and over again, making me think that something bad happened, only to ignore my calls, and you are telling me you were out this whole time?" Tony's words were shouted at him, and Steve couldn't help but feel embarrassed and hurt; Tony could have at least wait until they were in their room to start shouting at him like this. Why did he decide to humiliate Steve in front of Bucky? Now, any respect he was able to gain from the younger Alpha was probably dashed away with the wind, Bucky is probably thinking that he was a bad mate and an Omega, only disrespectful Omegas get shouted at like this.
"Wait! Did Steven make a joke?" Clint asked with a mocked gasp, which got him a slap on the back of the head from Natasha and an eye roll from everyone else, though Steven snorted at that and a smile twitched on his lips, so Clint took that as a win and stuck his tongue at Natasha who narrowed her eyes on him.
"Why did you tell me this?" Tony gritted through his teeth, wondering why of all the damn time Natasha decided to tell him her story. Why didn't she just answer his question and be done with it? Why did she feel the need to complicate things even further than they already were?
' this and '
"That's sweet but tough…" Tony said tried not to be awkward which he was failing at twenty out of ten, God, this was embarrassing! Here he was walking with the ultimate Alpha to ever Alpha, and he was acting like an awkward teen who didn't know what to do! Tony was sure that the Alpha was probably thinking that he was a danger to his pup. "So how are you and your mate finding it in America? I am sure it's tough moving from country to another." Tony said as he kept a sharp eye on the pup, hoping that the pup will not run away, it was obvious that the man and his pup were from another country especially with the English accent the pup sport, but the Alpha beside him stiffened at the mention of mate which made Tony turn his eyes to the Alpha.
As much as Tony wished to say that living with an Addams wasn't weird (even if he was half an Addams half a Rogers) he knew that he was lying to himself (and lying badly)… not only was Rogers weird, but he was the dangerous weird, the kind of weird that will remind Tony of Stephen King's books, the kind of weird that remind Stark of that book 'IT' with the murderous clown.
"Lunch is ready." Tony said as he put the soba noodle with black sesame seeds with side dishes of cubed chicken, snap peas, clementine, chocolate raisins on the table, which made the pup 'Oh' and 'Ah' with sparkling eyes. "What are you waiting for bambino? Dig in, Cooper, Lila, and Nathaniel are coming over in an hour or two, so you can play with them as much as you like." Tony said which made the pup smile and start eating his lunch, talking about some school project with excitement every bite, which made Tony smile into his food.
"You should be aware of what happened to that place." The woman spat and Steven scowled at her, gazing at her straight in the eyes with a glare making the woman scuff at that. "Was your
"Really Tony, it took you three days to fix the suit." The woman with the Shield behind her back asked, which made the now named 'Tony' scuff and cross his metal arms over his chest, Steven staying silent the whole time, looking up at the stars, heartbreak already sitting in, he was wondering how he was going to return home, or how to wake up from this nightmare, this nightmare of him walking through Midgard and being seen… how long has he dreamed about having a physical body that will make his dream of being beside Anton a reality? And now after thousands of years, it was suddenly real? Steven really wanted to curse the fates and their sick games.
"So good, Tony…" Tony blinked his eyes in a daze, finally paying attention to what Steve was whispering against his neck, his words sounding choked up by sincerity. "Look at you, sweetheart, so breathtaking and beautiful." Steve then start placing kisses behind Tony's ear, along his jaw, under his eyes, everywhere he can reach until Tony's giggling again, high off the affection his husband was giving him without a restrain. "Mine. My husband." Steve growled nuzzling Tony everywhere he can reach, leaving Tony melting at his affection.
After that day, Steve can say that he wasn't feeling as well as he wanted to, a trip to Bruce's office with his husband informed him that it was normal at the beginning of pregnancy to become forgetful and sometimes have misleading memories, something about all those hormones shifting and changing. Steve, he was feeling guilty and a little sad for how he nearly accused his husband of breaking his promise to him, though, the Alpha only shook it off with a laugh, and start talking about doing a digital diary if Steve was going to be that forgetful, which did get a small smile from the Omega.
James's words, caused Steven to press his lips tightly, he turned to the small boy that was still holding onto him like the Omega was going to disappear any time if the boy didn't hold on. It broke Steven's heart; it really hurt him how much the pup seemed to suffer without his idiotic father realizing it.
." Tony whispered a rustle of something followed him before Steve was enveloped in a warmth that made him let out a content sigh. "
"Need something, sweetheart?" The rough edge to Steve's voice is gone, schooled back into place by his steadier husk. The one Tony usually calls his commander's voice; it always ended up making Tony feel hot and bothered when he listen to that voice. "You need my knot, Tony, is that it?" Steve croon causing Tony's breathing to hitch
Reaching the Stark tower Steve left the car and headed toward the reception ignoring that he was wearing black jeans and a blue shirt and old running shoes, not a fancy suits like the rest of the people around him who stopped to look at Steve like the Omega didn't belong there, but the Omega didn't care about their stares, he had one goal in mind and one goal only and that was to throw Howard Stark from the ninety-nine floor of this building. "I am here to meet Howard Stark." Steve spat which made the woman behind the desk look at him like he was crazy scrunching her nose like she smelled something foul, which made Steve grit his teeth at that and left the woman heading toward the elevator in the far corner ignoring the woman's shouts and the security that rushed to him, he just made sure to slip with the woman with strawberry hair and the man who was with her in an elevator.
The second is a Bucky/Steve horror story, psychological horror, with poor Steve being the prey of the winter soldier, no Bucky Barnes here guys! Just a mentally unstable demon that is bent on killing… poor Steve…
After brushing his teeth and being fully awake, the small boy took it as his chance to pester the Alpha on and on about what happened yesterday, even when the Alpha put him in his own seat, and the boy was happy that the Alpha was humoring him and telling him what he wanted to know which made the pup buzz in his place, but his Mommy cleared his throat and send them harsh look when he put the breakfast plates down which made the two of them become quiet as mice and try to eat their breakfast, sending each other funny looks while taking bites after bites of breakfast, and it was the first time that Peter felt the fuzzy feeling in his chest engulf him, like one of his Mommy's tight hugs when he holds him and kisses his forehead… it was nice… and it made Peter squirms and try to finish his breakfast, knowing that his Mommy will tug his ear if he didn't finish it this time, especially when he didn't eat dinner yesterday.
, not ven zey needs vu." The man looked around the place, taking oat cookies and putting them in Steve's cart, causing the Omega to puff his chest in irritation at the rude move. "Tell me, Schteffen, vere is Morkan?" The man's odd question stopped Steve from what he wanted to scream to the man, Steve froze in his place when the man's question finally made sense…
"Yes, Bucky is alive in my world, but that didn't mean he is alive here." Steven's harsh words made Steve take a step back and swallow while looking at the man with betrayal. "And for your information, no, Bucky isn't my husband he is like a brother to me, he married Sharon Carter and had children and grandchildren of his own." Steven said which made Steve nearly trip at what he was hearing, face going a little pale at Steven's words, at that he shook Peggy's hand away from him and rushed out of the room, leaving the scent of pain and heartbreak in its wake making everyone shift in discomfort, and Peggy frown when she saw Tony leave the room, probably searching for the Alpha, which made Peggy stop herself from tracking the Omega down and stop him.
Ever since that day in the hospital, when they pulled him away from his baby, his doctor changed, instead of the vultures that usually surrounded him trying to pull him away from his baby, there was one doctor now, Bruce Banner was his name, a kind Beta who always speak in a calm voice, and ask him his opinion before he does anything. After the second day when his baby hadn't wake up, Tony screamed his lungs off, screaming about what they have done to his baby. The nice doctor had approached him and tried to calm him down, he explained to him that his baby was in a medical-induced coma so he could recover, Tony had cried his eyes out that day, holding his baby tightly.
Steven said which made the king pause and look at Steven with a strange look in his eyes, Steven could hear the whispers surrounding them, as the Vikings looked at one another then at Steven who was looking straight into the king's eyes without fear, the Omega was talking in their language.
In Howard and Peggy's year of absents, Steve learned that Hydra was not gone as they all had thought, Steve learned that the thing he fought against, lost Bucky for, nearly died because… was still alive. Steve wanted to rage, he wanted to kick and punch and break things… but he couldn't. As much as Steve wanted to be involved with the investigation of Hydra, Peggy and Howard had forbidden that, least Steve ruins their cover. So, in the end, Peggy gave the mission to one of her spies that she trained and trust, his name was Fury, an energetic boy in his mid-twenty, Steve met the young man, as much as he didn't like someone else taking his mission, he told Fury to be careful. He also met another one of Peggy's spies, Coulson… a kid with huge hero worship for Captain America… the kid nearly screamed his head off when he saw Steve walking with Peggy to meet Fury, Coulson, and Maria, the youngest of Peggy's spies… Coulson didn't let go of Steve's legs until Steve signed his cards…
"Oh…" Steve murmured, looking at his hands, trying to avoid looking at Tony. Tony's heart dropped when he saw the glow around Steve deeming, which informed Tony that he had made a huge mistake and that he made Steve sad. It takes a real asshole to do that, and it seems that the asshole of the day was Tony.
An Omega with his back to the door wearing old tattered clothes, that Steve wonders how they didn't fall off of him from how thin he was, Steve swallow and enters the room rushing to the Omega… the Omega was as pale as the walls around him, with a long and tangled hair that reached past his shoulder. Steve froze as he saw the Omega's empty eyes staring on the walls, curling around himself holding a pup… a pup that couldn't have been older than three years old, a too-small pup with a too-big shirt and pale skin and a scent of sickness and death surrounding him… the Omega didn't pay him any mind, he just continued to hold the pup and sing softly, not caring if someone was there with him… not seeing that there was someone with him...
Steve heard and felt Thanos thrash in pain, letting out a pained gasps as he tried to throw Steve away from him, but Steve held tightly to Thanos refusing to let him go. When Steve felt Thanos trying to reach for the power of the Infinity Stones, Steve reached out to the Space Stone, pulling the power to strengthen his core but also making it more unstable, more explosive… the first warning pulse Steve felt, made the star close his eyes and tighten his arms around Thanos' mid-section, growling as he finally managed to expose his core enough for it to burn everything in its way.
"But he hurt Mama!" His baby screamed, big tears rolling from his eyes, making Tony sob at that… he hurt his baby… his baby who was trying to defend him, his baby who pushed Stane away from him, his baby who was too noble trying to act like Captain America and nearly getting killed.
As Steve nodded, he pushed Tony on his back on the bed, and finally, Steve climbed on top of him; they kissed and touched gently, touches and kisses that become more frantic as time passed. Steve's hand curls around Tony's erection under his sleeping pants and Tony growled in pleasure, when Tony flipped them over, Steve had to hold his grin back, as Tony placed soothing kisses all over Steve.
The trip back to earth was silent and thankfully not that bad as their first trip to Asgard, Clint didn't throw up on Thor's boots this time so everyone counted it as a win. It had been nearly two weeks since they went to stay in Asgard, in those two weeks they learn so much more about Asgard and about Steven, who was still considered a mystery to everyone, but what they heard from Steven about their dark future made everyone shiver and pause, hoping that since Steven was here now, he will right the wrong everyone claimed will take a place in the future.
Feeling guilty for being the reason Harley's only parent was killed, Tony adopted the boy and start raising him with the help of Steven; Steven who stayed with Tony and helped him raise his Peter and now Harley from the start. The night after everyone returned to the tower, was the night that Tony finally confesses to Steven, him not being able to hold it in anymore.
The thing about feeling dead on the inside is that you can create any persona you like just to fill the emptiness, and that was the exact thing that Anthony did. He was tired of getting the pity and knowing looks from Rhodey, the Beta would have told him a long time 'I told you so' but he didn't last he broke Anthony's heart more than it was. His mother always looked at him with worried look when she sees him these days; Anthony tried to smile pretending that his heart wasn't breaking on the inside, Anthony learned to crave the perfect mask, he learned that the way he was acting now was the reason Steve left him, Steve didn't want a dorky Alpha who always talked about robots, who adored movies and loved making fun of some of them, who loved hearing the piano because it reminds him of his mother, who avoid violence as much as he can, no, Steve wanted a real Alpha, one like his best friend who enlisted in the army years ago, the one who shoves his statue left and right, the one who was always right even when he was clearly wrong, one like his father…
The creature blinked his eyes and got closer to the boy, as close as he has the first time he went to see the person who dared to live in his house after years. The creature let out a loud chirp this time, puffs of breath leaving him, causing a cloud of white to leave his lips; the creature was planning on waking the boy up, which the creature knows will end up with screaming and pleading and crying. To the creature surprise though, the boy did not wake up, he just shivers and curled on himself rocking the boat with him, but not waking up.
was here, and it was not happy at all. "You made
The rest of the day turned out just like how Tony imagines it… with Harley trying to stay far away from him and tensing every time the two of them stood near each other… needless to say, Tony was a little sad that the small boy refuses to give him a chance.
Two weeks pass; two weeks of spending his time with his mate and enjoying it to their fullest, getting to know each other not just intimately, but trusting the other with their most hidden secrets. Two weeks of sightseeing around Italy and taking photos to keep the memories of their happiness together, promising the other silently that they will be there. Two more weeks of missing Peter, and promising that the first thing they will do back home was holding their pup until they were content.
." Steve started the grin on his face was like that of a satisfied Devil who knew that he gained a slave to torture for the rest of eternity. "After all, everyone knew that information; it's why people refuse to date an Addams when we ask them." Tony paled as he remembered his father's old horror stories as he orders him to say no to every question an Addams asked; Steve's grin widen even more when he saw the realization painted Tony's face and Tony doesn't know if he should cry or laugh at the cruel fate awaiting him. "Besides, didn't you say that you will marry me the second I take you out of the cemetery?" These words made Tony sway on his feet, how did Steve know about these words? Looking at Steve, Tony saw the knowing look painting the Addams' face and the sparkles that surrounded him. It was at this moment Tony knew…
"Who do you think you are, ordering my husband?!" Tony screamed before he tried to attack his brother, which made the taller Alpha tense, especially when Tony attacked again, making Steve froze in his place as he took a step back followed by another, his breath speeding up as panic creeps inside of him and he took a step back but tripped and fell on his ass, but that didn't stop Steve from crawling away from the men that were screaming and raging at each other.
Tony paused, his lips stretching wider and wider until they stilled on a dark smile that promise pain and death to everyone who dared to stand in his way. "Why? You are right, doll… race you there?" Tony asked coyly, kissing Steve's lips before rushing toward the purple grape, smiling at the dark laugh his husband let before following him…
What do you think?
"Did you find him, J, Edith?" Tony called out desperately, it had been six hours since Steven was captured from under their nose, everyone was on their last nerve, growling and scowling at the thought that Hydra was able to drop one on them. Peggy was the most disturbed by it, still furious about how they didn't foresee a strike from Hydra, accompanied by Rogers, who growled at the thought of Hydra's agents being in the same place as him without recognizing them, everyone wondered why Hydra had moved after Steven, and all of them had a specific reason for why they did it, either for his knowledge or for the serum in his body, everyone though knows that they need to find Steven and they need to find him fast before something happened
"Wait you have an AI? Since when did you care about techs least an AI?" Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve looking at the man to spot if there was something that transmits the sound of the AI, how was that AI able to hack into Shield database, the only AI in the world who could do that was JARVIS, and his AI and suits were the peaks of technology so far in this century.
Peggy was better than he thought, and the blond slowed himself down to see what her next move would be. Studying her fighting style was better than winning, and soon Peggy has woven her lithe body around his and put him in a headlock. She doesn't need to be strong to pin him down, only clever, and she's got his arm held in such a way that he can't break free unless he uses raw strength to hurt her, but he wasn't going to do that, he would just let Peggy bask in her win.
Steve’s favourite place to sit in the park was on the pile of rocks that ringed one edge of the pond. When it was sunny the flat-topped rocks were warm, and it was easy to sit down with one leg up and pull out his sketchbook. He sketched the trees and the passers-by at the picnic tables, the ducks and sometimes the fish if the day was bright and the water was clear. He’d been in a duck kind of mood today, not really wanting to deal with people, until a father and his son had arrived at one of the picnic tables.
"What do you mean Steve?" Peggy asked calmly as she walked around Howard to stand in front of Steve, as much as Peggy wanted to cower in fear from the raging pheromones Steve was letting lose, she wouldn't. She was an Alpha in her right and most important Steve's friend… she just didn't imagine she left him suffering like this…
"N-no, no, baby, no, you don't understand…" Tony's voice nearly vanished as he tried to explain more to his baby, cursing himself for causing so much distress to his son and the man who did nothing but care for them from the start. "Look at me, baby…" Tony breathed out which made the small boy shake his head before the Omega let out a tired breath and he pulled his baby away so that he was able to gaze at his eyes, and his heart broke when he saw that tears were clouding the boy's eyes once more. Tony opened his mouth and then shut it, not knowing what to say, trying to gather himself as much as he can. "Mama is sick, baby…" Tony finally ended up saying, his words making more tears cloud Peter's chocolate dark eyes. "S-sometimes… Mama gets lost in his head, and can't find the way out… and… and Papa did what he did so that he would protect me from hurting myself, even if… Even if it meant that he would get hurt instead…" The Omega explained to the boy, hoping that he would understand, that he would know that the Alpha was the one who got hurt today and not Tony.
"Where is he? Where did you take him?" Steven breathed harshly, his tongue feeling thick in his mouth; any rational thoughts had long since left him when he woke up missing his small babe. Steven tried to strike the person holding him back, tried to wiggle free from the harsh grip, but it was of no use, his body was too slow, too weak, working against him.
Before Anton tried to give her a dry remark hoping that she will stumble and embarrass herself a familiar twin of giggles broke through the people causing Anton's heart to skip a beat; from surprise at why his son and the queen's babe was here, to fear for their safety, Anton wondered what he will do. It turned out that Anton hadn't needed to do anything, because as soon as James and Petrus saw them and the crowd the two of them stood still, with Petrus hiding in fear behind James.
"Oh… well, you can't right now, he is like, in the middle of an important meeting, a really, important meeting, like super important!" The Beta rambled on nervously, and that made the Omega bite the inside of his cheek as he took a step back away from the woman, powerwalking toward Peggy's office, ignoring the squeak from the Beta as she tried to stop him. The Omega wouldn't be stopped, his heart pounded inside his chest as he all but ran to the office, knowing that he has only a few seconds from the woman finding him and dragging him away.
…" The slamming of doors followed by the voice of an angry woman made Peter let out a sob as he whimpered, holding tightly to Steve and shaking him, hoping that he will wake up, only that Steve's useless body didn't. "
"Oh yeah, great, excellent; we are just going to tell Steve who is a self-sacrificing idiot by the way; that Thanos is on the move and is planning on making him his bride. Steve will love learning that Thanos will kill him and rip his heart because Steve refuses to shackle with that crazy purple grape!" Tony hissed, his nerves getting frazzled the more he remembered how much beating Steve took for refusing Thanos. He still remembers Steve's heart being ripped out of the star's chest, shining faintly as Thanos swallowed it.
You don't know how many times I wrote and rewrote this chapter, writers-block is a bitch I will tell you that.
"Did Mr. Rogers tell you that?" She asked with a serious voice, which made Tony shook his head. "Tony, just because Mr. Rogers is your fated mate, it doesn't mean that you are forced to be with him in any way you don't want, especially if you don't feel comfortable around him, you and Mr. Rogers need to talk about what you expect from each other if the two of you wanted to just be friends, or a family if you want something more, then that's great, but only if you are comfortable with the man being with you… tell me, Tony, what do you want from Mr. Rogers? Do you want a friend who will always have your back? Or do you think of him as only a family like you do your parents and Mrs. Carter?" Dr. Ross asked which made Tony blink and look down at his hands.
