“JUST TELL ME!”
“Let me try this another way. Someone who used to be important to me showed me this analogy several years ago. See this bowl?”
“Sherlock?”
people who laughingly described themselves as journalists. It was all… most… vexing.
“Comfy?” Janine looked at her, smiling as she watched the water lapping over her mouth and nose as the gentle waves of the tank subsided again.
He’d just steeled himself to sacrifice the indulgence and say something when the typing ceased altogether and the metallic click signalled Sherlock had put the laptop aside. He expected that to signal an end to the odd intimacy too, but the fingers of Sherlock’s hand continued to weave their esoteric script without pause, and John found himself overcome with inexpressible gratitude as he finally succumb to the simple, consuming darkness of sleep.
“Unless you feed on me again,” John cut in.
At his touch, he felt John clench around him and couldn’t stifle a groan at the added tightness. John’s eyes opened and cleared momentarily as he smiled up, tensing his pelvic muscles and Sherlock’s vision whited out as he picked up the pace of his thrusts.
“These,” John lifted Sherlock’s hands in his, turning them slowly in his, “I mean, they were always amazing; playing the violin, at your microscope, on a case. But now,” he stroked his thumbs over Sherlock’s palms and the detective shivered, “Jesus, now they’re incredible. What you can do, Sherlock,” John’s voice dropped to a hushed murmur.
The shivering was back, John could feel it in the muscles of Sherlock’s shoulders and chest. Fine tremors that came and went in waves. If John didn’t know Sherlock so well, he might think the man was nervous, but he’d seen this before; being briefed by Lestrade, at the sight of a gun, when a fugitive made a run for it. It was the twitching of a racehorse braced to run, pent up energy awaiting permission to be released. The thought that Sherlock was holding himself back was intoxicating.
“You knew.” Not a question….a statement.
Sherlock eased a hand under John’s foot, lifting it to rest on his thigh, “I’m not sure, I think perhaps I might just enjoy watching you… eat… to begin with.”
“Not the done thing, really.” Sherlock replied forlornly.
As his eyelids slipped closed, the velvet voice wrapped itself around his soul, “There now, John…..rest…where you belong.”
“Sleep on the couch, John,” he said softly, “your back won’t thank you for it, but I can sit in my chair and read. You’ll be OK, I promise.”
If he’d known that his trembling first steps would be followed by these consequences, he’d not have been so quick to reveal his inexperience.
“Yeah, but not like that. You found out what she was doing, uncovered the plot, but… people would think…”
And so, gradually, normality returned. A new, better kind of normal, with carefully balanced duality that fulfilled his very soul. Truly blissful times with his darling, socially acceptable Mary. A life where she was free to pursue fulfilling, intense work with Mycroft, and came home to his strong supportive arms and solid bedrock of their marital home, and he spent quiet afternoons with roast dinners and was able to indulge his nighttime need to coddle, and cherish. At the same time, he had a life with his beloved, reckless detective; days of danger and risk, mixed with nights of passion and abandon. If he thought it wouldn’t be tempting fate, he’d feel guilty at his good fortune.
“I said—“
“Relocated!” John snapped.
There was silence and then the sound of a door closing, followed by the musical clatter of China rattling on a tray as John approached the bedroom door.
“Good, that’s good. Look, I’m going out for a while. I promised I’d meet Greg for lunch. We’ll talk later, yeah?”
what flat-mates are supposed to do.
“My hunter.”
To tired to argue, John slipped off the chair the sit I front of Sherlock, their knees inches apart.
It feels odd to put these words on paper, not knowing if it will reach you and not quite sure if it was best that it didn’t. But you deserve the truth; I owe you that, even now when it may not matter.
There were many things the two of them didn’t talk about: John’s unquestioning loyalty to Sherlock, Sherlock’s inexplicable need for praise from John, the way Sherlock’s violin playing soothed John’s nightmares, the way Sherlock’s eyes would soften when John placed a cup of tea next to the detective while he was working on a file, the way that John’s favourite biscuits seemed to appear on the side counter after a particularly bad day at the clinic, and the deep, rough way Sherlock murmured thank you when John draped a rug over him while he was brooding on the sofa.
Sherlock was still staring with wonder at the bowl as John left the flat, grinning, “Of course, yes.”
“You don’t understand? Some things aren’t meant to be understood, John. Some things simply are,” and with the slightest of tugs, the remainder of the fabric seemed to billow and flow upward, uncurling, rising and circling Sherlock to finally drape across his shoulders and settle down the length of his back.
“I need my birth control. Top drawer” As Sherlock rolled his eyes and pursed his lips petulantly he said, more firmly, “Now, Sherlock! C’mon… fight your instincts, genius. Get… the… pills.”
You say you are haunted by the meaning of the kiss upon my own hand, where it lay against your back. The reason is simple, and I’m surprised you didn’t deduce it (have I taught you so little). I was expressing my gratitude to the scar, John. That memory of trauma that troubles you so much was my saviour. Without that wound, you would not have been under my touch that night. It brought you to me. Remember that when you look at it in the mirror; that I was forever thankful for that tangle of puckered skin.
. “An ambulance can’t help you…you know that.” John stood and had a quiet moment of smugness as Sherlock’s eyes followed him in confusion.
“I see…”
Single child, lived alone… nothing odd there, had been killed while walking home from a work event one night. No witnesses…
I wonder if you’d remember how it all began. That cold winters night when I was finally defeated by my own demons. Would you remember that dark night when I finally surrendered and stood in my underwear, shivering with cold, and fear, and adrenaline at your bedside? Remember how you turned over under your blankets? I remember; I remember how in the dim light, you raked me over with your eyes, deducing my soul and then soundlessly lifted the edge of your sheet and wordlessly beckoned me in.
, he thought. In fact, there was a fire and spirit in the new Mrs Watson that Sherlock respected most highly; and wasn’t that part of the problem? While John had been surrounded with shallow, simple-minded examples of the fair sex, none had been able to compete for his attention. Mary… Well, Mary was a force to be reckoned with.
Pressing hot kisses down Sherlock’s neck, John nuzzled his nose deep in his Suprasternal notch and breathed deeply, mumbling “What do you want Sherlock?”
pin you to the bed, but you need facts right now, and the fact is… I can’t promise happily-ever-after. Relationships aren’t like that.”
Sherlock meanwhile, had his mouth buried against John’s forearm and with a touch of hysteria, John found the sound of him snuffling and gulping against the skin reminded him of a puppy he owned when he was five,
John tipped forward, bringing their naked chests together and John bracketed Sherlock’s head with his forearms and he leaned down, “Where else indeed.”
Sherlock's nostrils flared, picking up the scent of panic and twitched a corner of his mouth up, then retreated to his armchair again, sitting gently on the edge, “There’s no need for that, John. I’m not going to kill you, any more than you’ll kill me.”
“I want to come to you; ask for you without feeling like it isn’t me making the decision. Does that make sense?”
Twenty minutes later, a quiet tap came from the other side of the door.
Sherlock nodded, pulling his robe off his shoulders and then smoothly lifting his t-shirt up over his head as John briefly stood to finally rid himself of his jeans.
Silence fell on the room, broken only by the hushed sound of their breathing, both hitching slightly at the potential.
book. It’s your cases, after all. I just wrote them up,” John flicked through the mail he’d brought in from the mailbox.
John nodded slowly and drained what little remained in his glass, before placing the glass aside and turning back, “What do you think I’d have said?”
John hadn’t heard the key in the lock, or even the tread on the stairs and he jerked in shock at the sudden noise as Sherlock repeated, very slowly, “Put.It.Down.”
Upon his return, Sherlock took in John’s haggard face, twitching hands, and slightly desperate eyes with a glance and wordlessly gathered two cups of tea and settled himself at the end of the sofa before beckoning John to join him. Several buttons were lost from John’s shirt in his haste to join him and only the echoing sigh from the detective lessened John’s own embarrassment at the rough, low noise that escaped him as the warm fingers settled on his skin. Neither mentioned the fact that it was two in the afternoon, or the fact that John was already half-hard within his jeans even before he’d even arranged himself on the couch.
Sherlock sighed in frustration, “You belong here…” He waved around the room in a vaguely uncontrolled way, “with me.”
“I know, but at least he already knew we were there. He’s promised an answer by the morning. Now…”Sherlock had started the reflexive rubbing of his thigh again, “if you’d like to excuse me, I’d appreciate it if you could just get into bed and go to sleep because I’m apparently going to be spending the evening masturbating in the bathroom.”
“You should get that, it’s the third time in half an hour.”
“Shit,” John’s muttered expletive drew Sherlock’s gaze and he looked chastised.
“I’m beginning to think this plan has several flaws,” Sherlock said, voice bouncing back off the cold metal, “not least of which is that I appear to have underestimated the physiological consequences of this particular situation.”
Sorry, that sounded a bit melodramatic. Let me get back onto what I wanted to say.
Sherlock smiled, “You said…
“Sherlock?” The call finally came from ahead in the darkness. Hollow and distant, echoing, and Sherlock reached deep for another burst of speed, his breath burning in his lungs.
How are we to spend the currency of our lonely hours?
you to stay close and triggers adrenaline release if you stray too far.”
Sherlock had expected some repercussions from their exposure to the DNA altering compound and the heat that followed. But he hadn’t anticipated this.
John slumped further in the chair, legs splayed lazily apart as all waking propriety fled his relaxed limbs. Sherlock wished he could lean over and loosen his boswell’s tie a little, perhaps unbutton his waistcoat and collar to allow him some respite from the daytime constraints.
Not needing to be told twice, Sherlock begun his own entrance into the snug space, placing his hands and knees carefully on either side of John as he crawled over him, tugging his coat behind him, and pulling the door closed behind him, plunging them both into darkness..
Sherlock rose from his chair silently and placed a single finger on the top edge of John’s newspaper and pressed downward, creating a neat ‘V’ and exposing John’s unsurprised eyes. He dropped his voice and tried again, “John,” Sherlock held his gaze, exerting just the smallest amount of persuasive force, “I really think you’d be more comfortable staying home.”
quite enough. This experiment has been an utter failure. I think Mycroft was right all along, sentiment is
Tugging the taller man toward his bedroom, John gently asked, “Why not?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he keened, fidgeting as he bounced from foot to foot, “You wouldn’t.”
for you.
John stalled an inch above Sherlock’s lips, watching as the man’s eyes flicked between his lips and his eyes, craning his neck upward, reaching for contact that John withheld.
John licked his lips, swallowed and closed his mouth, and then, for good measure, his eyes, not wanting to see Sherlock’s rejection any sooner than absolutely necessary.
While he waited for the water to boil, Sherlock turned back and wordlessly regarded John gasping for breath as the laughter subsided, before pouring the water over the teabags and bringing both cups to the table, taking a seat on the opposite side.
“You’ve done this?” Sherlock’s brow furrowed, “My deductions about you aren’t always right, but I was reasonably sure…”
Molly sighed in frustration and pulled open the bottom drawer of her filing cabinet, grabbing a folder and slapping it down in front of him.
Sherlock had known since he was a young man that his desires ran contrary to societies dictates. As a result, he’d taken the unpopular step of remaining a bachelor rather than subject a woman he may otherwise respect and admire to a loveless marriage with no likelihood of children. Similarly, he was not foolish enough to seek out an emotionless rendezvous with men who could very well spell his downfall, incarceration, or worse.
“I’m starving, John,” Sherlock looked up, tired eyes meeting his, full of despair, “I’m
“I had not anticipated my reaction to doing this with you.”
, John.”
Sherlock felt his legs go from under him and he threw his hand out to catch himself before he fell, He heard his mobile rattle against the hospital floor where it had slipped from his fingers.
“It wouldn’t,” John gasped, “would it?”
“No. No I don’t suppose it is. He’s not like that, and we both know it. Doesn’t stop you
Sherlock’s eyes flashed with sudden, desperate hope.
As he watched, Sherlock straightened from his crouch at the side of the corpse, beckoning him over to point out some detail or other, and to consult his opinion. He grinned, carefree and joyous as he strode forward, already picturing the end of the case and the inevitable
Over and over, he drove into John, each time gaining a cry from his lover, each one a little louder, a little more lost than the time before. Seeing the mess John’s cock was making against his abdomen, glistening pre-come smearing wetly, he released his hold on one of John’s legs, freeing up a hand to reach and stroke in time with his thrusts.
“No, let me finish.
John felt the surface of his skin break, with tiny a pop of release. There was the slightest sharp point of pain and then a wave of shivering tingles spreading out from the spot. With a shout, John arched and came, untouched within his pyjamas the waves from his neck cascaded, overwhelming him and he shuddered as Sherlock held and rocked hard against him, moaning through his own orgasm against John’s hip.
John checked happily, fuzzy in the soft aftermath of orgasm, “OK then.”
people as described by yet more
Sherlock looked about to stand and walk away before he shook his head instead, “You don’t seem to understand, John. I’m not like other men, I’m not one of your
“You know, if you planned to stay, Watson, you should have brought a change of clothes at least,” Sherlock dunked a shard of toast into the buttery yellow hole of the egg.
“Thank God,” John replied, feeling as though a weight had lifted, “because I’m not sure I could give you up anymore.” John released his hand to lean back and rest a palm on Sherlock’s hip, reassuring and firm, “We’ll take things at your speed, Sherlock. Whatever pace you want, slow as you want.”
Sitting in the bay window of their Suffolk home, Sherlock looked up over the top edge of his reading glasses with a smile, “Hi, how’d it go?”
“Don’t care,” Sherlock nuzzled at John’s neck, “they’re my powers, and I’ll use them as I see fit.”
“I’ve always known.” John rolled his sleeve up, “I’m not an idiot.” John knelt at his friend’s side, “Now drink, and we can talk.”
Sherlock looked at him for several seconds, narrowed eyes and appraising before nodding toward the door, “Come on John, finished here.”
are, and I want all of it. I want to give you it all, and I’ll take anything you can throw at me and be glad of it”
“Our body heat?”
“Idiot.” Sherlock replied, turning back to his domination of John Watson’s body with enthusiasm.
“I think we need to talk to Molly.”
“John?” Sherlock’s confused reply echoed from the bedroom.
“I see,” Sherlock replied slowly, “or rather, I believe I do. However I am at a loss as to why you are approaching me when factors of your bearing and behaviour indicate to me that…” Sherlock cleared his throat awkwardly as a flush rose on his cheeks and he glanced away, “… that for reasons I won’t go into here, tell me that… relations between you and your husband continue unabated.”
it. I know you, John Watson, I know who
“Yeah, problem?”
“This would be easier without the shirt,” the comment came one night without preamble and without warning and John tensed under the roving fingertips as Sherlock’s words whispered into the room.
“What?” John leaned against the doorframe, exhaustion making him testy.
Ah, the air is oddly still without friend to share it
Distantly, he heard the sound of John’s bag falling to the floor of their entrance hallway. Lifting his head he saw John standing, mouth agape staring up at him. “Wait… Not ‘what I want’?” John took a shaky step forward, there was a flash of something very much like anger in John’s eyes, “Not… what…I…want?”
“I know,” John whispered, “and if it’s too much to bear, say the word and I’ll stop. I’ll let you go,” John held his gaze, calm and sure, “if that’s what you want.”
I cannot, shall not, must not
Sherlock could have screamed in frustration. Each small movement John made was measured, he inched forward as if he were stalking prey. Constantly checking Sherlock’s eyes for signs of doubt, with Doctorly concern etched in his face.
Sherlock ran his fingers through John’s damp hair before coming to rest at his cheek, “Not in the slightest. I may have been in the throes of passion, but I meant what I said, John. I want everything, but I have no desire to seek it from anyone but you. If that’s alright.”
“I’ve never,” John shook his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, “just let myself go like that, it was… intense,” he finished.
John tipped the paper back up, his reply coming hidden behind the oversized sheets, “Nope, not really.”
He tried again, voice little more than a whisper, “Sherlock….”
The familiar tone of John’s voice did nothing to calm his galloping pulse at the perceived intimacy of his first name on his friend’s lips. Sherlock blinked, trying desperately to reorient himself in the modern world he now found himself in.
“No… ‘M not finished,“ John mumbled, “you’re… “ he leaned out to tap on Sherlock’s chest and sighed deeply, “why aren’t you…?”
Hearing the stuttered noise, Sherlock carefully placed his mug safely back on the desk and turned toward where John sat in his chair, mouth open and no doubt naked lust on every feature.
“But…”
“So…” John probed softly.
Sherlock nodded shakily, bottom lip caught between his teeth to suppress a shout of unbridled joy that threatened to explode from his chest, staring into John’s blue eyes as they hurtled toward the cliff edge of orgasm together.
When he reached the end of the drawer, he found himself crouched over John, his back against the roof of the drawer, his breath warm on John’s face.
Lestrade looked up from the oddly too small figure on the table and the moment their eyes met, Sherlock knew the truth. Molly, our Molly, is gone. His hands fell away and he felt the sudden bite of despairing tears. He stepped toward the table, covering the space quickly until Lestrade reached out to still his progress.
As Sherlock knelt, keeping his hands visible and facing John, he retrieved the file and scattered pages. John remained standing uneasily, his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s every move.
“No… certainly not,” Sherlock paused before adding, “just wondering if you’d had any further… revelations, regarding last night.”
“No, of course not,” Sherlock looked back down at the pages in his hands.
John pressed in again, tipping up on the balls of his feet and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, effectively cutting off the last of a chuckle and Sherlock tensed beneath his mouth with a gasp.
Sherlock nodded dumbly as Lestrade led him to the door, out onto the street and put him into a cab. Hearing the voices like they were at the bottom of a bucket, he realised Lestrade was sending him home to Baker Street.
With a snort, Sherlock picked up his glass again, hiding his smile behind the rim.
Sherlock chuckled back darkly, “I can see we’re going to have to talk about vampire instincts. When hurt, we tend to bite.”
“Forget it, sorry. I know… the work. This would be… crossing a line.”
John was washing up when he turned Sherlock’s new bowl over to dry on the rack and saw the base.
At the feel of Sherlock’s skin on his own, John moaned again, Sherlock’s name contained somewhere in the sound as Sherlock’s hand began to move.
For a moment, John struggled between acquiescing to Sherlock’s attempt to distance himself, while his instincts shouted that if he let the man go now, Sherlock would never again allow his guard so low, and never allow John to peer so closely at his heart.
John stilled for a moment and considered. It was true that a flu-like ache pulled at his muscles. A deep bone-weariness no doubt a result of the blood-loss and all he wanted to do was snuggle back down and sleep. But……sleep in Sherlock’s bed….next to him….It was madness of a scale unheard of in hunter histories.
John doubted he’d been this hard in his entire life. He could feel his cock twitching and bobbing, uselessly crying out for attention that Sherlock seemed determined not to give. Instead, the vampire was systematically taking him apart piece by piece.
There was a sigh as she tried again, “It’s as if he’s sitting at a bus-stop. He’s present but not interacting. He looks…brittle, as if a single word would send him running. I don’t know how else to explain it. Do you know what’s wrong?”
Sherlock moved away somewhat reluctantly, before finally crossing the room and tugging the blinds closed. Turning back, he found himself confronted with the broad line of John’s back, clad now only in shirt sleeves as he reached to fold them over the back of his chair. The dense white cotton fabric pulled taught and curved to outline the strong shoulder muscles and arms.
Sherlock’s hands dropped away, “I’m sure you remember me saying that, at least,” his mouth tilted up in a careful smile.
Or partake perhaps in sport with glass and vile potion
Molly sat quietly in her seat, blinking at nothing.
“Mmmmm.”
“You realise nothing needs happen, John,” They stood side by side on the boating lake bridge within Regent’s Park. Sherlock’s voice was low to ensure they wouldn’t be overheard should anyone walk by, even this late at night.
Sherlock struggled to pass him and the hands holding him gripped harder.
, I can feel him, too big and yet finally aligned to the size of the impact to my life. Overwhelming, all encompassing, always around me, and now, beautifully, within me as well.
**--**
Finally having given himself permission to succumb, John’s fingers breached the boundary separating Sherlock’s pyjamas from his skin and ran his nails up Sherlock’s lean back, delighting at the way Sherlock arched against him in response.
Any concern he’d felt that either Sherlock, or Mary, or both, may develop some feelings of jealousy had disappeared like so much smoke in the wind. Both his partners had never been happier and any awkwardness that he’d worried may occur when they happened to be in the same place had come to naught. In fact, it seemed that the topic of their shared Doctor gave them a common grounds from which they had begun to build a truly stable friendship.
“As often…God, yes… as often as we want,” Sherlock reached blindly behind himself to fumble in the side table for a condom and lube.
Sherlock let the silence linger, content to leave the vague statement stand, however John seemed insistent to finish his muddled thought.
“But —”
“Didn’t think I’d want to repeat what we just did?” Sherlock shook his head, “I plan to do rather more with you now that I’m not obsessed with getting my hand around you.” And with that, Sherlock turned back to switch on the bathroom light, “Come on, John. Keep up.”
“Oh… Oh God help me,” he whined brokenly, hand moving jerkily against them both until Sherlock encircled his fingers with his own, creating an unbroken ring where their cocks slid against each other with wet, filthy noises as the rhythmic movements continued.
. He looked at where John was peacefully ensconced in his chair, reading his newspaper, naked knees and shins visible below the lower edge.
**-**
“Oh Christ, John,” Sherlock lifted his head to bring their mouths together, sucking one of John’s lips harshly between his own as if suckling on it. One of his hands was curled over John’s shoulder, clasping almost hard enough to bruise as he drove himself through John’s hand and against his cock.
“Let us retire to your room, my
“You… fed from someone else?” He hated the neediness in his voice,
Sherlock scrabbled to comply, pushing up onto his knees, face crashed against the pillows so he could awkwardly hold his own arse cheeks apart, displaying himself to John’s greedy eyes.
“Why?” John released one button, then two, kissing skin wherever it was exposed.
“Yes,” replied Sherlock quickly, “of course.”
With John’s free hand, he reached around Sherlock’s lean body, settling his palm against the sweaty small of his back, delighting in the feeling of the muscles bunching and flexing as Sherlock thrust against him.
Throughout, Sherlock paced restlessly around the emergency vehicles, the flickering red and blue lights washing the scene of colour. The moment John eased himself from the rear of the ambulance, blanket around his shoulders, Sherlock was at his side urging him toward a nearby log.
He nodded wordlessly.
“I’d like to give her my old room.”
“Haven’t you deduced it?”
“No, Holmes, nothing like that. Well, not quite. Patients, you see, sometimes…”
We shift on the bed, neither releasing their proprietorial grasp, but manoeuvring for optimal access and end facing each other on our sides, John’s straighter form to mine more flexed, bringing our faces and hips into effective alignment and meaning that I’m still within reach of John’s capable hands. Practice makes perfect, and this is a routine we’ve practiced enough that awkward conversations and blushing fumbles for lubrication are behind us.
Without warning, the reality of the situation came crashing over them as John looked down at Sherlock, prone on the rug, chest bare and rosy flush stretching up his neck to his face. The scar from the bullet that had almost taken him away still showed, a pale divot on his chest. John gasped a stuttered breath and swallowed hard.
John stumbled into Sherlock’s bedroom and flicked on the lights. As expected, Sherlock was sleeping, or what passed for vampire sleep. The urban legend of vampires sleeping during the day was yet another myth perpetuated by the vampires to help them ‘pass’ in human society. The truth was that most vampires didn’t sleep often, but when they did, they slept hard. Sherlock was no exception.
John’s voice dropped to rumble dangerously, “Oh, I’ll do more than try, I promise you.”
Sherlock looked at the arrayed packets and bottles in front of him. Oblivion in tiny capsules and tablets. With trembling fingers he picked up the pen and tapped it on the paper and began slowly, methodically to keep his commitment to his brother.
Sherlock meanwhile was easing himself from the bed, poking distastefully at the mess on his abdomen and chest, “I’m going to have a shower, I appear to be coated rather thoroughly in your ejaculate.”
He may have drifted off, or perhaps he just floated in the quiet space between waking and sleeping, but he became aware of the gentle press and slide of Sherlock’s fingers against his spine. Feather-light and transient, never stilling for long, brushing at John’s shirt in long strokes, barely hard enough to bridge the gap between fabric and skin.
He was now little more than an arms-length from John, “You want to feel… just once, that you’re the one in charge, to utterly dominate me and make me submit to your will, your body and your cock,” Sherlock released the grip on the sheet and it fluttered to the floor leaving him flushed and naked in front of John, “Does that sum it up?”
“Still. It doesn’t seem to matter that it feels like I’ve rubbed the top layer of skin off, I still have this… urge,” there was a hiss of pain and Sherlock rolled to his side, curling in on himself in an instinctual effort to protect himself.
Just the thought made the base of John’s cock tingle, the thought of pushing impossibly deep inside his Omega, stretching him beyond his limits until they were locked together, “Jesus, Sherlock, I want to, but are you sure?”
night.”
“No you don’t. You’re trying to convince yourself, but all the same your hind-brain is screaming to run, just like mine’s screaming to chase. But you’re resisting it, as am I.”
“Alright,” she sighed, “clearly you know. Should I get my will out of the desk, or could you and John manage that afterward?”
“I want to hear it,” Sherlock flushed, pink rising high on his cheekbones, “I think I’ve proved beyond doubt that where this is concerned, I can’t be relied upon to get things right.”
There’s nobody I can talk to about this, Sherlock. We didn’t talk about it while you were here, and even if you weren’t dead, we probably still wouldn’t. But the ghost of you keeps climbing into bed with me and Mary, and it has to stop. It’s got to… or I’ll go mad with the guilt I’m feeling.
“You’re laughing…” John queried softly, “That’s a new reaction. I’ve had gratitude, I’ve had surprise, I’ve even had regret. I don’t think I’ve ever had hysteria.”
Sherlock nodded in surrender, looking up to smile wickedly at John where he stood over him, “Do I at least get a bed-time snack.”
, saving Sherlock on the roof.”
“Goodnight, John.”
“Well of course you didn’t, you’ve been out all day,” Sherlock threw the words over his shoulder as he climbed into the cab.
John turned to where Sherlock was tucked against his shoulder, face inches away, eyes warm and bright. He could feel Sherlock pressed, hot and hard against his hip even though the denim. There was a subtle twitching and quivering wherever they touched as Sherlock ruthlessly controlled the nervous adrenaline coursing through him and something of John’s awe at his restraint must have shown in his eyes as Sherlock suddenly groaned and captured John’s lips with his own.
Sherlock nodded with a huff of frustration, his eyes steadying and clearing, “Yes, I’ve taken my birth control. Yes I give my consent as an adult Omega. Yes, I accept that whatever happens in this heat is with my full permission and
John whimpered, his eyesight beginning to darken at the edges as the thundering blood in his ears seemed to rob him of oxygen.
… “Did you have a nightmare, Watson?”
“Do it. Do it, John,” Sherlock’s voice was rough and John could feel the bed moving with little dipping movements as Sherlock’s hips shifted in sympathetic thrusts in empty air, too tender to stand any friction at all.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched before quirking up cruelly, “Help? No, I don’t think you can
?” she squeaked.
,” Sherlock growled, the rumble resonating through John’s chest before he was pushed away, “I need to go now, or I won’t be able to make myself leave,”
John clenched his hand slightly, bunching the fabric of Sherlock’s robe before gently releasing it again, “I’d… “ John stumbled on the words, “… if you… if you only… “ his eyes were soft, searching Sherlock’s face and suddenly, the detective knew what he was trying to say.
Finally, Sherlock cleared his throat, “Do you remember how I resolved the issue of Moriarty’s death?”
“John,” Sherlock’s voice seemed impossibly close, his warm breath against his ear, “tell me if you want me to stop, but for the record, I’d rather not. You’re fascinating like this; warm, pliant, almost glowing with trust and contentment.” Sherlock eased a long arm over to run the pad of his thumb across John’s nipple before moving on, “You’ve never had this with anybody, have you? Nobody but me.”
“Right,” John took a step back, his shoulders lifted as he considered their options, “let’s look around and see what we can find to keep us warm.”
“Perhaps that might be helpful, blow the cobwebs out, so to speak,” John held the door as Sherlock passed by him into the night, settling his top hat as he did so.
The man himself was comfortably ensconced in an easy chair he kept in the corner of the room, hands steepled under his chin, watching John with an openly appraising stare.
John stepped closer, near enough to reach out and touch if he dared, “You had… are you saying you had
And yet it is a trembling thing
“Good,” John grinned, nodding, “that’s… good then. I’ll, umm, make some arrangements then.”
“Damnation,” John shuffled forward on his knees, pressing himself forward trapping Sherlock between him and the headboard and crowding against him, all signs of the gentleness from the night before gone without a trace. Leaving one hand fisted in the taller man’s hair and circling the other behind his neck, guiding his movements and preventing Sherlock from moving away, John muttered “this is…”
Sherlock looked up, his brows rising as he realised that in his weariness he’d said the last out loud, “Ignore me, I mis-spoke.”
“It’s awful,” John muttered.
“Yes, you saw exactly what you think you saw. No, it’s not done with mirrors, or wires or a trick. Yes, it moved on its own. Yes, it’s mine. No, you can’t try it on. Next?”
After a guttural grunt, Sherlock rolled onto his back, and sleepy eyes opened to regard John at the other end of the couch.
“You look a bit pale, you ok?” Sherlock laid the back of his hand on John’s forehead.
“Wha I’m tryin’ to say… “ John swayed alarmingly on the couch and Sherlock readied himself to intervene if John chose to topple off completely, “Is tha… “ John’s brow furrowed deeply, “What was I tryin’ to say?” He ended by looking at Sherlock hopefully.
John could feel the heat rising in his cheeks, his lips had parted and he wet them with his tongue, “Really?”
“Well, yes,” Sherlock paused and then forged on, “but before that, I told you… I told you that you were my only friend. Surely you understood… surely?”
“I’m saying, my very dear My Holmes, that I am, on my own unable to fulfil all my husband’s capacity to love. However, by some fortuitous happenstance, there is a strong, honourable, trustworthy person that he holds dear to his heart and that I find eminently suitable to meet those needs for which I lack the capacity,” and now Mary blushed too, “the… physical attributes to satisfy.”
John could see Sherlock was on the edge of laughter too, the lines beside his eyes crinkling with good humour above his twitching lips.
His mind-palace was a useful but often troublesome thing. The repository for all manner of carefully hoarded mental flotsam, it was a wunderkammer of epic proportions. As it grew and expanded with every passing year, his ability to subconsciously connect unrelated pieces and deduce a plethora of unexpected information was both a blessing and a curse.
John stood, keeping his distance, “But I should,” he eyed the darker fabric between Sherlock’s thighs where his natural lubrication was already staining them, “Damn you, Sherlock, always pushing the line.”
“Let me finish, because you probably don’t… see, I mean.” John frowned, his lips pursing thoughtfully, “It’s a terrible time for our boys, over there. What happens to them, emotionally, physically. And remember, they’re grown men, with… habits… private habits. On occasion, disabilities, injuries would deprive them of their hands, or freedom of movement and,” John coughed, “well, on occasion, one would ask for… a hand, so to speak.”
John’s movements are becoming erratic and I relinquish my grip on one hip to begin stroking him in time with our thrusts. Although he is looking at me, I can’t honestly say if he is seeing me anymore. There is a faraway look in his eyes that speaks of being at once apart and yet at one with the universe. I know that place well.
All the while he’d thought he could feed the fire in his soul with the remaining embers of his friendship with Sherlock Holmes. Unacceptably rude, unacceptably abrupt, and unquestionably, and in society’s view,
Sherlock had the file sorted the way he wanted. To John’s increasingly bleary eyes, the last three versions had looked much the same as the previous five, however Sherlock assured him the new configuration indicated more of… something…
Sherlock blinked, the beginning of tears in his eyes, wrecked and desperate “It’s always been you, John Watson. If you want me, I’m talking all of it.”
“JOHN!” Sherlock shuddered around him, squeezing and milking him as he felt warmth spread outward, deep inside the detective’s body.
containing a variety of toys, massage oil, Berocca, and pain killers. He’d submitted his ‘heat leave’ form yesterday when Sherlock’s scent had begun to change and unless his nose was very much mistaken, they wouldn’t be getting much sleep tonight.
Sherlock blinked, his eyes fluttering as he processed what John was saying, brow furrowed until finally, his gaze cleared, and he asked in a voice deep and sultry, “You want me to touch you?”
It was good to see a sliver of humour creeping back into Sherlock’s tone and he encouraged it with a chuckle, “I dare say for someone with your encyclopaedic knowledge that may well be true. Will you indulge me in granting something I’ve wanted for some time?”
And the velveteen brush of the gentle sex.
“I’d be a very poor excuse for a doctor, an even poorer friend, and a damnable hypocrite if I were. Repulsed?… No; a little
John drained the last of his scotch in one gulp, “Sherlock… I’ve wanted to… share a meal with you for some time.”
Sherlock’s eyes snapped back to John’s, the silence suddenly deafening, “Perhaps,” he replied slowly.
You have that chance with Mary now, John. Take it. Banish the bad dreams, let me be truly dead when you receive this note and lay me to rest. Live for us, John.
“I can’t promise that, Sherlock,” John whispered, aware how his voice caught roughly, “I wish I could, because if you stop touching me right now, I may
“You’re doing fine, more than fine,” John murmured, “If this is you not knowing what to do, then God help me when you work it out.”
His eyes flicked back up, and John was surprised at the shock and hurt he saw in them, “You think I wouldn’t respect your request to leave you alone?”
The mouth pulled away. “Ow…What the hell, John?” Sherlock looked for all the world like a five year old who’d been into the strawberry jam donuts. Red and sticky from the top lip down, John was witness for the first time, to the sight of twin fangs nestled in Sherlock’s mouth.
“Please —” Molly struggled to remain afloat even while her strength was ebbing,” — don’t.”
“Christ, Sherlock!” John wrapped his own hand around Sherlock’s where they were joined and he pulled swiftly at himself, shouting Sherlock’s name as he covered their hands and the sheets with his own release.
Sherlock drew in a deep breath and straightened his shoulders, taking strength from John’s calm confidence and rose to his full height, glancing to the side where his bed awaited them and then back, decisively nodding and raising a hand to cup John’s cheek, “Yes, let’s to bed, John.”
“But you did,” John smiled back, “with a magic cloak, too.”
The truth was, all he wanted to do was fall at John’s feet and drag his mate to the floor with him. But if John had wanted him beyond physical necessity, he’d have said something in the intervening three months. Clearly their bond-bite was nothing more than a convenience to John, and if his doctor would prefer to spend his heat with… even the thought caught in his throat… someone else, then that was his right. Sherlock needed to respect John’s choice if he was to stand a chance of retaining their friendship. He’d take what he could, he thought bitterly. He’d take
“Like a dog?” John asked, teasingly as his hands raked back down in long trails.
Sherlock’s brows drew together, a tiny crease forming, “Where else would I be, John?”
The firelight sparkled and gleamed, reflected soft and golden through what little whisky remained in the tumbler. Sherlock tilted the glass to the side, watching the patterns change as the liquid tipped. He glanced up to stare fondly at where John – Watson, he corrected himself, had fallen asleep in the chair opposite.
He reaches behind for the tissues that have taken up residence at the side of the bed.
“You’re a hunter.” Again….it wasn’t a question.
He saw the ripple run through his mate’s shoulders at his name on Sherlock’s lips. Slowly he turned toward the man on the stairs. John’s eyes were red and bleak as they met Sherlock’s.
“A bit of a shock?” John felt a hysterical giggle trying to push its way up from deep within his chest, and he found he had neither the strength nor will to suppress it. It bubbled up, and once it started, he found he couldn’t seem to stop, leaning against the table as his eyes watered and blurred as Sherlock silently moved around the table to it the kettle on and took two mugs from the cupboard.
For my part, it is a feeling of coming home. The closest to belonging and being welcomed that I have ever experienced and I am suddenly alarmingly close to overcome by the sensation. I freeze for a moment and John, alert to my mercurial moods even now, sees my plight and manages to still his movements, laying lax and motionless, giving me time to regroup.
“Yeah, yeah I want that. Christ, yes,” John whispered against his mouth, “I might need a moment to, you know, recover.”
“Why not, it’s what you are. Your sole purpose in life is to identify, hunt, and kill my kind. What would you like me to call you John? Killer…..lier…” Sherlock lowered his hands and added carefully, “….threat.”
“I’m glad you’re home.” Sherlock poked at the smouldering logs, stirring them back to reticent life before replacing the poker in the rack and returning to his chair, taking his scotch-glass with him.
**--**
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open and he lurched upright in his bed, the sheets tangling around him as he shouted the single slurred word into the dark, “JOHN.”
But instead of the experienced, confident lover Sherlock had expected, hoped, to have push his limits and leave him wrecked, and ruined, and sated, he had instead the careful, methodical, society doctor. Full of compassionate care and diligent bedside manner.
John shifted again as he lost what little traction he had on the slippery floor of the well, and clutched harder at the back of Sherlock’s shirt, throwing his arm ver Sherlock’s shoulder to try and get slightly more height above the surface of the water.
“For… “ John waved a groggy hand around, “this… all of… of this. You… this… “ the eyes closed again.
John considered his reply, “I think perhaps I’ve been ordering off the wrong menu. I find I’ve been checking out something a bit… spicier?”
Sherlock’s entire demeanour changed in an instant, softening and relaxing under John’s hands, “Accepted. Next?”
“Dull. Honestly, I think they only invite me in the hope that you’ll come along and say something unforgivably rude.” John sat heavily in the  chair opposite Sherlock.
His fingers tighten in my hair and I gasp, opening my mouth further and he delves back in, clearly intent on taking up residence in that wet hollow. I can feel him smiling, even around his kisses. He is happy, I realise, deeply and irrepressibly happy to be here with me, sharing this and nothing more. Our hips may beg to differ, but the way he is totally involved in the plundering of my mouth tells me that this is something John Watson enjoys in and of itself.
“Sherlock…” His voice came out cracked and dry.
“Sherlock…” The name tumbled forth from his lips; a broken cry as John arched and spilled over their joined hands, followed by a stifled grunt as Sherlock followed him, staring into each other's eyes all the while, before seeking each other's mouths to prevent any further exclamation that Mrs Hudson may hear downstairs.
Sherlock lay buried under rumpled sheets, the stark whiteness only serving to provide additional contrast to the inky curls and piercing eyes. John wanted nothing more than to collapse back toward him and bare his throat to Sherlock’s pillowy lips. The logical part of his brain firmly advised that this was
Silence fell. John wasn’t sure where Sherlock’s head was at, after the morning, but it seemed like progress.
John’s eyes flicked down and then back up as he wet his lips quickly, “No, I really don’t think you do.”
He turned back before shaking his head at John’s skeptical look, “More? You want more, alright. Baskerville —”
**--**
So I shall silent, half of a whole
He vexes me, Billy
“One hundred and twenty,” Sherlock mumbled.
Feeling Sherlock’s eyes on him (as perhaps he always had), John dropped the top edge of his paper to regard him silently.
“Shhh, just relax and let me take care of you,” John murmured, kissing Sherlock gently on the lips before going back to his silent manipulation.
“Don’t bother.”
“What’s the problem,” John muttered around the pipe stem, lowering his paper, “too many thoughts spinning around in that big head of yours?”
“Mmmmm,” John dragged his knees up so he was straddling Sherlock lap, “I’ll think of some others as we go along, I’m sure.”
Sherlock’s gaze skittered away, “Well, yes. Obviously, if we have sex again, the clock resets.”
, that’s what Sherlock called you. He’s quite chatty, you know, when he’s tucked up safe and warm at Baker Street. Not quite the pillow talk I was hoping for, but still,” she looked Molly up and down, “quite useful.”
“I feel like some sort of foolish, blushing bride, “ Sherlock mumbled, clearly angry at his own trembling clumsiness.
John pulled back and whispered against Sherlock’s lips once more, “
A fine tremor had started up in Sherlock as he lay beside John, curled facing him, and John wondered, not for the first time, just how much experience Sherlock had with another man, or anyone at all, really. He’d made his feelings on
Instantly awake, John froze with terror and shuddered at the throaty groan from the man at his side.
Janine checked her watch, “Shall we try him again, it’s been almost fifteen minutes.”
They say that people regret that they don’t get to share final words with loved ones. Perhaps this is our chance. I’m trying to look at it that way. It’s helping, I think.
He shifts against me, tilting against the pillow under him, and I shuffle my knees closer together, adjusting the angle to allow me to cant my hips with greater force.
“I know,” John murmured back, picking at flaking paint on the handrail, “of course, it’s not that I don’t –“
“Fuck, look at you, begging for my cock. Alright, Sherlock, you want it?”
**-**
“I don’t –“ Sherlock held up a hand to try and dispute the truth, eyes wide.
, wasn’t it?”

as I helplessly fall against his chest… together until the end.
When Sherlock lowered his steepled fingertips, night had fallen outside the windows of 221B and Mrs Hudson had clearly been in to light the gas lamps. Opposite, John sat quietly, deeply engrossed in whichever book he was currently reading.
You see, John, I’ve made a mistake, and unless I’m very much in error, a fatal mistake. Following your letter, I’ve been making all efforts to try and get home. I’ve pressed my luck one too many times, taken one too many shortcuts and my carelessness has caught me out.
“Too late,” he murmured, “already regret… sh’d have… ages ago.” John was absently stroking the silk of Sherlock’s robe, smooth strokes against the fine weave, “Want’d you…” he trailed off, staring at his hand.
“I don’t know what I want,” Sherlock muttered before shaking his head with a wry grin, “No, that’s not quite true. My problem is that the vast majority of things I want are far beyond acceptable bounds.”
“What’s your type then, out of interest?” He ventured.
“John?”
I shall look into his eyes and say
“What are you —?”
“We are not a couple who seek out the normal in life, and as such, I find myself more interested in what makes myself and my husband happy far more than what is considered proper. Do you understand, Mr Holmes?”
“Sorry?” John pulled his head away for a moment, looking up wickedly at Sherlock’s face, “What were you saying?”
“I like dessert,” John reached to palm Sherlock through the thin fabric, “let’s have dessert!”he said frantically as Sherlock calmly gripped his wrist and moved his hand away.
“Hmm?”
Sherlock grinned, trying to lighten the mood, as John stalked back and forth beside his bed, “I did suggest you sleep here.”
Sherlock pulled back with a thoughtful expression, “Then why tell me to stop?”
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hummed and made notes on one of the pages before pausing and looking up at where John was shuffling toward the door, “wait, what?”
they make that mistake?” John slipped out the other side of the bed and stretched, padding toward the bathroom and continuing the conversation as he went.
‘Tis a troublesome thing of heart and head
“Oi, trying here. You know I’m not good at this,” John took Sherlock’s hands in his, “So, yes. Missed it all, wanted you for ages,” he paused thoughtfully before nodding, “Yeah, ages.”
“John, please…”
His glance, his touch
With a glance at the mantle clock, John raised a hand to cover Sherlock’s, “You look done-in. Will you try and get a few more hours sleep before dawn? We can talk more in the morning.”
The images came thick and suffocating.
“He was DYING!” John stared at her unflinching.
“Yours, John. I’m here. I love you, I should have said.” Sherlock looped his arms under John’s thighs and lifted them, noting with delight the wet stain already on the sheets below John’s arse. “So ready for me, look at you.” Sparing a final glance at John’s face, vulnerable and needy, he shifted forward and as he slid smoothly in, John dragged in a long breath, seemingly drawing him deeper as he pushed into the warmth and tightness.
She watched as the Sharks circled closer and then, with a vicious smile turned and walked away, pausing only to switch off the light as she closed the door.
mean; just grateful not to be alone in my room at the top of the stairs. I was just so thankful that I could hear another person breathing, chasing away the spectres of my fallen friends in a foreign desert.
Another wave of the hand, which threatened to overbalance him until he steadied himself on the back of the sofa and said tersely, “I’m goin’ to bed. Night, Sherlock.”
“Look at it!” She gestured toward it.
There are some things we don’t talk about beyond the walls of 221B.
**--**
, male. He’d comforted himself with the easy delusion that what he felt for the man was simple fondness perhaps enhanced by doctorly concern. His army years had presented many opportunities and he’d eluded them all, telling himself that any reaction he’d had was just the natural urge to scratch a long denied itch.
“Ran out an hour ago, and spit isn’t doing the job, trust me.”
In fact, to Sherlock’s frustration, John chose the third option, which was to return to their status before the fateful trip to the lab.
Reflexively, Sherlock took this new information; shock, refusal, offended obfuscation. As much as he’d like to respect John’s request to desist, he could easier cease breathing than stop accumulating facts. He dropped his eyes away in an attempt to respect his friend’s privacy and moved toward his room, “I apologise. I’ll leave you to your solitude, doctor.”
The man whose name had been shouted so enthusiastically simply hummed contentedly and gripped a little firmer at John’s hips, controlling the thrusting that threatened to interrupt his rhythm.
“That’s my Alpha.” John cemented the behaviour with praise that shouldn’t have made Sherlock flush with pride, yet did anyway, “So smart. Not just some mindless machine. Come here…” John gestured with open arms, purring with happiness as Sherlock fell against him, solid and heavy against him.
“M-Must be… insane then,” John’s head fell heavily back against Sherlock’s shirt, “Because I t-t-trust you.”
Their world changed, and yet remained oddly the same. Sherlock told him he was the Sorcerer Supreme (a ridiculously indulgent title that didn’t surprise John in the slightest) and began wearing an odd eye-shaped pendant under his (still too tight) shirts, one he called the eye of asparagus, or Aspergillus or something like that.
“Me?” John stared at the bee in wonder, “It’s perfect.”
“Good God, Watson,” Sherlock reflexively slipped back into the familiar name and it somehow seemed more erotic than the use of his first name would have been, “How I want you.”
“Your kill list. Plump, wouldn’t you say?” John replied darkly.
Without apology, John reached up a hand to the nape of Sherlock’s neck and wordlessly pulled him back down only to have Sherlock redirect the path of his lips to John’s chest, flicking out to lick a nipple as his mouth touched down.
with you?”
“Hmm?”
It was sudden, surprising and after a shocked gasp, entirely welcome. If it had been left to John, they’d have been shagging on the rug ages ago and he was quietly pleased to see he wasn’t the only one riding the knife-edge of desperation. John mumbled Sherlock’s name on a breath, warm and wet into his friend’s mouth. Part question, part request and Sherlock’s hand came up to curl at the back of John’s neck, tugging him closer.
John chuckled a little awkwardly, “Always.” He paused as a flash of hurt brushed Sherlock’s eyes in the dim firelight, “No, don’t take it that way. It’s just…” John searched for the right words, “You fill a room, Sherlock. Even when you’re not there.”
John waggled the condom he’d retrieved from the drawer with the lube, “No, no more quibbling.”
And so it continued, albeit now without the shirt, night upon night. If such a thing as a routine existed in Baker Street, the nightly giving and receiving of gentle touches became one. John didn’t understand it, didn’t question it further, and if he were absolutely honest with himself, became more reliant on it to end his day and soothe him to sleep as the weeks passed.
“No,” John conceded.
“You painted a bee on the base of your bowl.” John said in amazement.
“There you go, I’ve got you. We can have this at least,” John murmured against Sherlock’s hair. With its daily coat of Macassa washed away when he’d prepared for bed, the curls were short and soft and John indulged in the feeling for a moment, entirely at a loss as to how to proceed.
“Get out here. Get out here now!” John stood square in the middle of the lounge, fingers gripped tight around the file.
“Not sure that term applies to men, John,” Sherlock grinned, “but let’s not quibble on semantics.”
Lestrade walked over to where John was standing quietly to one side.
“Then I would have done this,” Sherlock’s voice dropped low as he stepped even closer, his Belstaff coat forming a curtain around them both as Sherlock pressed John against the wall against the long line of his body. John moaned and pressed up on the balls of his toes, encouraging the second, hungrier kiss.
“You’ve WHAT? Mycroft, seriously?”
In the end, he did scream. It was inevitable, he supposed. The pleasure rushed up and over him, swamping him like a tiny boat in a storm, and he heard himself crying out Sherlock’s name, voice hoarse and ragged and through it all, Sherlock held him, in his hands, in his mouth, and in his power. When John came back to himself, Sherlock had crawled back up his body and was sprawled on his chest, grinning at him like an enormous erotic cat and John kissed him, tasting himself on his tongue, and wasn’t that the sexiest fucking thing ever?
“Stop it,” Sherlock muttered not lifting his eyes from the newspaper, “she’ll hear.”
With a fluidity and speed belying his fluffy jumper image, John was out of the chair and driving Sherlock backward into his own before Sherlock even considered what response would be appropriate. He found himself pressed back, John’s right hand tight around his throat.
John only had time for the words, “Time for wha—” before Sherlock opened a beckoning hand toward the fabric and, impossibly, it unfurled to reach toward his hand allowing his fingers to close in the densely stitched edge.
agreement. YES, I accept you as my Alpha for this heat. Now, John Watson, being of sound mind and very firm body, will you hurry up and FUCK me!”
His strokes are strong and sure and mine are smooth and melodious, giving both what the other desires. I need John’s calm confidence and firm insistence, and he needs my delicacy and ability to instantly deduce what he needs on any given night. My mind stills; surrounded by sensation, sound and smell, and the world contracts to the deep blue eyes that fill my field of vision, as this man who has entirely consumed my world stares at me like I am the centre of his. We are, at this moment, each other’s everything.
had been enough to send him retching to the toilet bowl.
“Touché, you knew I knew,” Sherlock’s troubled frown cleared to a small smile, “but I didn’t know you knew.” In a flash, the smile was gone again, “There’s always something.”
book, then.” Sherlock pushed his glasses back up his nose and ran a hand through his now grey hair, “The book of two men’s frankly
“Since I came back from my time away, yes.”
, that I know what I’m doing and… more importantly, that I know what
John watched as Sherlock, always so careful to hide any weakness fell to pieces in front of him; the droplets beginning a slow roll down his cheeks, leaving crimson trails behind them as Sherlock simply stared at John, his face stripped bare of all pretense, open and vulnerable.
no idea. It’s like he’s on another planet. But then, he sort of always has been, right?”
**--**
The tip of Sherlock’s tongue darted out to brush at his lips. The sight should have horrified John, with the recent memory of his blood running from Sherlock’s mouth. Instead, the delicate touch of pink to his bottom lip was unnerving; almost erotic and he felt his breathing skip as his heart gave an erratic lurch in his chest as a wave of carnal longing swept through him.
Normality returned for some time, or what passed for normality in Sherlock and John’s life. Perhaps gazes lingered a little longer, phrases were more carefully judged to ensure there was no subtle subtext evident to onlookers, but on the whole, the situation seemed managed. The pair grabbed what little affection they could, having to content themselves with the briefest of touches and the knowledge that these precious morsels were savoured to slake their thirst.
John inched closer, settling more firmly against Sherlock, “I’m saying it’s time. I think it’s time… for us, I mean. If you want, I mean. I…” he tensed, “I’m making a mess of this, sorry.”
“Sherlock.” John’s voice came again, and Sherlock corrected slightly to the left, finally glimpsing the raised edge of the well.
They’d gotten as far as the kitchen before John had the presence of mind to reach out and snag the door jamb, stilling their headlong rush, “Wait, Sherlock, wait.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and his voice was bitter, “And what exactly is a modern vampire supposed to be, hunter?”
Sherlock chose that moment of revelation to yawn and John smiled at the unguarded expression on his face before his eyes opened again and his eyebrows creased thoughtfully, “Oh, interesting.”
“Sarcasm?”
. That was the problem, Sherlock thought. Molly had tried to call him three times. Had given him three opportunities to come to her rescue and he’d let her down. Internally, he was screaming. But looking at Lestrade, wracked by the grief of losing a skilled and dear colleague, he couldn't burden the Inspector with his guilt.
“They’re
you’re interested in. I’m…” He snorted again, “that’s…
“YOURS! YOURS, JOHN….ALWAYS YOURS!” Sherlock shouted in desperation.
imagine… almost believe that we…” He leaned his forehead against the cold glass, “but that’s done now, no sense in dwelling on fantasy notions.”
By inches, Sherlock’s hand edged across the bed between them, coming to rest on John’s hip, just above his cotton boxers and John wondered if Sherlock could feel the way the fabric, even at that distance was tented away from his groin.
Mary doesn’t hold me like that. Even after the nightmares (they’re back, by the way). She rubs my back and says
John groaned and started to get up, “OK, give me a second, I’ll pull some clothes…”
Sherlock whimpered, “Mine,” as his movements stuttered erratically and John swept a thumb up and over Sherlock’s tip feeling him swell and jerk in his grasp as warmth pooled over his hand. With a grunt, John thrust twice more and tensed, Sherlock’s name falling trembling from his lips as his muscles locked in ecstasy.
His eyes strayed yet again to the unmoving lump on the couch, better known as the greatest consulting mind in Britain. Sherlock was clearly feeling wretched. For the first couple of days, there was nothing more untoward than Sherlock’s usual declarations of
Finally, John raised their joined hands and slowly pressed Sherlock’s fingers to his mouth, his moustache brushing as thin lips touched down on each one in turn as Sherlock’s mouth fell open with a surprised, panted breath.
Sherlock’s new bee was detailed and anatomically accurate. It resembled pictures in biology texts, wings picked out in exquisite detail, legs so finely rendered that the hairs were visible.
“On a scale of one to ten…” John ran gentle fingers through Sherlock’s hair and noted how Sherlock arched into his touch, “how close are you to stripping me here on the stairs.”
John chuckled, “So am I, now. Thanks for that.”
as he stood in the sitting-room, hands fisted at his side, quivering with adrenaline and the need to remark his mate.
“Jesus fuck, ow…damn…shit,” John startles upright in my bed, blanket falling away as he flails and gasps in pain.
“Better…” Sherlock’s rumbled baritone seemed to fold itself around John in the same way as his arms.
Of course it couldn’t last, Sherlock thought, life couldn't be that kind. At some point, they were bound to slip, provide some evidence of a simmering something below the surface, and their daily fight to keep it controlled.
” and his heart warmed as he felt Sherlock’s lips lift and tighten as his lover smiled against his mouth.
“Gonna come, Sherlock. Oh God, you’re gonna make me come,” he managed, as his hips finally gave up resisting the urge to lift from the bed, pushing himself through the ring of Sherlock’s fingers.
“JOHN!” he shouted at the man in the front doorway.
“You did.” John smiled smugly around the glass.
Sherlock sucked in a ragged, gulping breath and John pulled the man to him, enclosing his lean frame in strong arms. Putting a hand to the back of Sherlock’s head, he pulled it down so it was cradled in the crook of his shoulder as Sherlock sighed and some of the tension in his shoulders eased at last.
The pieces clicked into place as he cracked his eyes open expecting, and confirming, that he was indeed in Sherlock’s room and wrapped in the sheets of Sherlock’s bed.
, will you?” John asked, peppering the skin visible at the neck of his shirt with firm, sucking pulls of his mouth.
Sherlock let the spoon fall noisily into his empty cereal bowl and looked up, “How many times do I have to repeat myself?”
“Because,” John snuggled closer and placed another gentler kiss on Sherlock’s bemused lips, “it’s about trust.”
The points of Sherlock’s fangs breached John’s skin and Sherlock gave a broken cry around John’s skin, and bit down. The two men shuddered against each other, their twin orgasms ripping through them as they clutched desperately, holding each other in place as they shuddered and twitched together.
John makes a stand. It's a stupid stand, but it's still a stand
