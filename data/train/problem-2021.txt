I silently willed her to release me, but instead she remarked aloud as to the eeriness of the house and Holmes turned towards us. He responded with some perfunctory remark, as I, my hand growing damp in hers, glued my eyes to his face. I do not remember what he said, but I remember that he was perfectly calm and that his eyes remained on her face as he spoke, never once flickering down to where our hands were joined. All I could think, as the pain of his indifference turned my stomach to lead, was that I should not be allowing Miss Morstan to believe that I was in love with her when, despite my best efforts, I could not seem to stop every fibre of my body from vibrating with mingled dread and a sort of sick excitement at the thought of what Holmes would make of our growing understanding.
“It was a pleasure, Mr Holmes,” she said, her hand on the doorknob. As she turned to leave, she let her eyes fall on me, sitting rigid and upright in my chair.
Somehow, our desire continued to burn as hot and as savage as that first night. Ever aware of himself, even when he was rock hard and watching me moan as he thrust his musician’s fingers slowly into my mouth or mapped every inch of my scar tissue with his tongue, Holmes remained almost unnervingly in control of himself, orchestrating my pleasure as he ruthlessly deferred his own. His emotions, too, he kept firmly in check. Even when he was inside me, or lying spent in my arms, his skin glistening with sweat and his pulse thrumming as frantically as the wings of a moth against the glass of a lantern, I was unable to guess what he might be thinking or feeling.
John has locked the door by the time Sherlock makes it up the stairs behind him. When he doesn’t answer the third barrage of knocks, the third sharp “John!,” said in the tone that usually makes him fall in line with Sherlock’s demands before he even realises he’s doing it, Sherlock takes three steps back to the edge of the small landing and dives forward. The door crashes open under the weight of his body and slams into the wall, rebounding hard into his big toe. He barely notices the injury. It is utterly eclipsed by the blinding pain in his right shoulder, which leaves him stunned and blinking for a moment. Stupid. Should have used the other shoulder. His bruises could definitely have done without the second impact.
“I work mostly from home,” he said – an answer that hardly left me any the wiser. “My clients may sometimes visit me at our lodgings and I trust that it will not inconvenience you to let me alone with them for some few hours now and then. I perceive that you are currently without a practice. Do you plan to return to work in the near future?”
“She is a blackmailer, Holmes.”
“Sherlock for fuck’s sake –” John begins but then Sherlock kisses him and he abandons whatever he was saying in favour of verifying Sherlock’s continuing aliveness with his tongue.
He drew his account to a close and there was a moment of ringing silence before the birdsong swelled to fill it. I found that I was shivering, though I had not realised I was cold.
I heard his voice, husky with sleep, at the same moment I felt a cool fingertip trace a firm, slow line down my spine. My body gave an involuntary shiver.
“My dear Holmes, you cannot mean to return to the house tonight?” I exclaimed, unaccountably upset at the notion. “They will not be expecting you.”
“What is so amusing?” I demanded, beginning to laugh as well.
Holmes and I had been living together for several months and I had accompanied him on half a dozen of his cases when an incident occurred that threatened to upset the comfortable friendship we had built. One evening, after supper, Holmes and I were sitting by the fire. I was feeling relaxed and lethargic after several glasses of wine and Holmes was fiddling with his violin, not playing but engaged in the process of changing a string. He had removed his waistcoat, collar and cuffs and rolled up his shirtsleeves, and as he fed the string through the peg and began to tighten it, I was enjoying the sight of his dextrous hands at work and admiring his delicately muscled forearms, covered with a down of fine, dark hair. I confess my thoughts had begun to wander, and I was busy trying to image what Holmes’ slender back and finely shaped chest might look like under his shirt, when I came back to myself to realise that he had abruptly ceased working on his violin and was staring at me, observing with his calculating gaze the way that my eyes were fixed on him. Startled, I coughed and looked away. From the corner of my eye, I saw him swiftly roll down his sleeves, as though disturbed by my gaze.
“I knew the snake wasn’t venomous. You thought the sister was killed by a snake bite and they missed it at autopsy? Honestly, John. Anderson’s an idiot but the chances that the forensic pathologist would miss something like that are minuscule. No, it was obviously the step-father who killed her. Paralysed her with some sort of drug from his practice, something that wouldn’t raise alarm on the toxicology report, and then suffocated her, most likely. Child’s play. You can’t train snakes to do your bidding. They’re famously intractable. Anyway, there’s no such thing as a swamp adder, John. It was clearly an eastern hognose – a puff adder, to use one of its many colloquial names. There are at least six points of difference between the eastern hognose and the Indian cobra, which it most closely resembles, despite the way they both flatten their necks when threatened.”
“So this is how it ends,” I said, unsure if I was talking to myself or to him. “You use me and then discard me when I cease to be of interest. I suppose I have only myself to blame. You've never respected me. You treated me like a servant, issuing orders and expecting me to do your bidding. But it is none of it your fault. After all, I allowed you to do so. I should have known that a man of your talents and temperament would prize my share of the rent above my intellect and my regard.”
“I believe that our minds work in similar ways,” I heard him say again in that admiring tone. Throwing off the covers, I rose and poured myself a sizeable drink. Never since the night that Holmes and I had first lain together had I been so acutely, miserably aware of my shortcomings – the ugliness of my scarred body, the weakness of my shattered psyche, my shameful habit of drinking to calm my unsteady nerves and, above all, my deplorably ordinary brain, as dull and prosaic as a hammer beside the sharpened knife of Holmes' keen intellect. Ingenuity and intelligence were, I knew, qualities that he prized above all else. Unlike Miss Adler, I possessed neither of them in great measure.
“That is very gratifying to hear,” he responded with maddening calm, evading my reach. Rising gracefully to his hands and knees, he placed one large hand in the centre of my chest and pushed me slowly backwards, until I was lying on my back on the rug. His eyes were dark as onyx in the half-light and he kept them fixed on me, examining every nuance of my expression, as he ran one hand slowly over my bulging trousers. He smirked when I gasped involuntarily, my hands fisting at my sides. He was himself again, as focused and icily controlled as he was when immersed in solving one of his most complex puzzles. And yet, at the same time, he was suddenly new to me, his face flushed with arousal, his shirt gaping open and his black hair falling forward over the high curve of his forehead.
The combination of the night’s developments and the few hours of sleep I had snatched had left me light-headed and I can only assume that Holmes felt something of my own giddiness because when Mr Wilson showed us the curt notice informing him of the end of his employment, looking at once pompous and resentful, as puffed up and sombre as an owl, I felt the laughter I had struggled to suppress at the beginning of the interview rising up in me with volcanic force. As I exploded with a shout of mirth, I saw that Holmes was laughing too, shaking uncontrollably as a tear rolled down his face. I had never seen him so entertained. When at last he recovered himself enough to calm his angry client, who was on the verge of walking out in high dudgeon, he concluded the interview with admirable soberness. I neglected my usual rigorous note taking as I dwelt on how searingly attractive Holmes was on the rare occasions he allowed himself to lose control, a thought that soon led in a dangerous direction, given the memories that still burned so vividly in my mind.
“Do keep up, my dear fellow,” he called over his shoulder, and I sped up until I was beside him, matching his long strides, our hands almost brushing as we walked shoulder to shoulder in the sunlight.
It pained me to admit that she was indeed a remarkably beautiful woman. Her long hair was almost as dark and silky as Holmes’ own, her figure trim and upright, her eyes large and dark and very striking in her comely face. There was something magnetic about her, and yet I felt a natural abhorrence of her that I could not explain. She reminded me of a viper, sinuous and graceful and filled with hidden poison.
It was the article in the newspaper at the end of the case, lionising Gregson and Lestrade for solving the crime and branding Holmes an amateur who, under their instruction, “may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill,” that pushed me to begin writing about Holmes’ work. When I suggested the idea of recording his cases, framing it as a way to bring in more clients and ensure that he attained the credit for his work, he told me simply to do as I wished, but I sensed that, despite his seeming lack of enthusiasm, the idea appealed to him. If it also provided me with an excuse to stay close beside him and gave me reason to study him without reserve, I did not allow myself to linger over it.
Sherlock looks away but John’s not really asking. He already knows.
I returned to my seat and to the curious eyes of my companion in turmoil, my head filled with unworthy thoughts. I recalled Holmes laughing with Harrison and realised that I did not wish them to pass any more time together. I remembered Holmes eyes on Phelps’ hand where it gripped my own and his expressionless voice as he remarked that we must have much to talk over. Then I thought of how Harrison and Phelps’ friendship had been poisoned and it dawned on me that perhaps Holmes and I were each as foolish as the other.
During my school days I had been intimately associated with a lad named Percy Phelps, who was quite brilliant, almost – although naturally not quite – as brilliant as Holmes. He was two forms above me and although we rarely crossed paths, I soon developed a confusing fascination with him that left me daydreaming about him at all hours. I had been nursing my attachment to him for some months when he at last noticed me, and we began a short-lived but passionate affair. Although our interlude of swift and urgent experimentation was a revelation to me in many ways, and seemed to engross him equally, we had remained more discreet than many of the boys at school due to Phelps’ family connections. His uncle was Lord Holdhurst, the great conservative politician, and while some youthful indiscretions among some other of our classmates might perhaps have been met with a blind eye, he could not afford the possibility of the least hint of scandal.
“I was expecting to meet with you ahead,” he said.
“Then I believe we shall have no problem in declaring the matter settled,” she said. She was still standing by the desk but now she walked towards Holmes, drawing from her garments a square envelope. "You will find the photograph inside,” she said. “I will wait while you examine it, if you wish.”
“What business of mine? I’m sorry. I forgot I’m just a convenient stooge to make you tea and pay half the rent and occasionally point a gun at someone for you. Never mind the fact that I love you. I should just let you embark on suicidal experiments that serve no possible purpose other than satisfying your fucking insatiable curiosity.”
He spreads his whole hand across John’s upper back, feeling the minute shift of muscles under his fingers and palm.
“After you goaded me into it!” I exclaimed. “And, if memory serves, it was you who invited me into your bedroom and you who undressed me.”
“You do not seem the type of man to make such a mistake,” he retorted. “I am inspector Wainwright. I had better take a formal statement and then we will conduct a thorough search of the premises and interview these two men.”
“Get back!” he shouted. “Do not come near me!”
“You will not reconsider?” he asked at last.
Holmes spent the train journey deep in thought, withdrawn and distant, as I stared out of the window at the beauty of the English countryside, vivid with the first growth of spring, and wondered what horrors awaited us in Stoke Moran.
“My dear fellow, you look most unwell,” he said. “Can I do anything? Shall I fetch a doctor?”
I handed it to Holmes.
I had wanted to hit him the night before. Now I did so, driven not by rage and hurt but by half-delighted outrage at his arrogance. This punch was playful and unmistakably, dangerously tender. I reminded myself that Holmes missed nothing - I well knew how much he abhorred sentiment. But as I sank my fist into the firm cushion of his chest, he was laughing in his strange silent way. He grasped my forearm in an iron grip, pulling me on top of him so that our bodies collided and I found myself sprawled in his arms, our faces so close I could feel his breath on my cheek.
“The writing is of interest,” he said.
I had not realised until that night how insidiously the hope had grown, as we spent our days and nights together, that Holmes might on some level feel as I did. But on that score, I could fool myself no longer. Inside, I excused myself almost immediately and retired to my room, where I lay awake, cursing my idiocy and my weakness. Once again, I considered the possibility that to marry Miss Morstan might save both Holmes and myself inevitable pain. But when, feverish with frustrated wanting, I finally took myself in hand, it was not to images of soft blond hair and brave blue eyes that I found my release, but to thoughts of a savage grey gaze, of rough, scarred hands twisting in my hair and of teeth biting down on the back of my neck as a taut, lean body took its pleasure above me.
“Why are you getting so upset?”
“I am a doctor, Holmes,” I reminded him sharply. “I am perfectly capable of prescribing fluids and bed rest for myself. I am grateful for your concern, but I confess I do not understand what you are doing in my bedroom.”
Sherlock’s head is still pounding but he forces himself to straighten up and lean forward, using his height to tower over John, even while seated.
After the life-or-death dash to the base in Peshawar, my physical ailments were soon mended. Aside from an unsightly scar on my shoulder where the bone shattered by the Jezail bullet had left me with an unhappily deformed clavicle and an ugly web of raised, red tissue across my chest, I had rallied physical perhaps sooner than anticipated. Yet even before the enteric fever that left me raving and insensible for months, as close to death’s door as any of the poor soldiers I had stitched back together in Candahar, I had fallen prey to a dreadful weakness of the mind. During the weeks in which my shattered flesh and bone were knitting back together, I began to suffer nightmares of a kind I had never before experienced, even during those times on the frontlines when the dying moans and screams of the men I was not able to save filled the air with horror. These dreams were so vivid as to feel like reality and to stick with me for hours after I awakened, haunting my every thought.
“I missed you terribly,” I said, cupping the side of his face.
“John?”
“What?”
It was to me, not Holmes, that Miss Morstan turned when, at the climax of her strange tale, she opened a small box to reveal a set of the finest pearls that I had ever seen. Our hands touched as I took the box to pass it to Holmes and for a moment I wondered if I could once again be the kind of man who would think of marrying a woman like Miss Morstan. When she explained that a mysterious letter had urged her to meet that very evening with a stranger, bringing with her no more than two friends, I felt a jolt of excitement at the thought of seeing her again. But then Holmes began poring over the letter, muttering about the “irrepressible twirls” of the Ss and the distinctive Greek Es and I was overcome with a sudden wave of tenderness for him. I turned away in confusion and by the time I had composed myself Miss Morstan was taking her leave. With a final glancing look at me from under her lashes, she quit the room and I was once again alone with Holmes.
“Do not be ridiculous. I merely wished to be of help to you – and you ensured that I was not in a position to do so. Why must you persist in shutting me out of your plans?”
“I have never heard you speak of him besides that one time,” I said, astonished to find that the man lived in London. I had assumed – perhaps due to my own circumstances – that Holmes's family were all dead. “Why do you never see him?”
He broke off and I saw to my amazement that his eyes were wet, just before he dashed a hand over them, obscuring my view of his face.
Holmes quirked one dark eyebrow, a gesture I had had cause to notice in the past. It lent him a rakish air that I had tried and failed not be affected by.
“Well diagnosed, doctor,” he said, his voice so low that I had to bring my ear close to his lips to catch his words. “It was morphine. I fear I may have miscalculated the dose. It has been a long time since I took it. I am usually content with a seven percent solution of cocaine.”
“What of the photograph?” I asked. “I believe we are here to negotiate its return.”
The words taste foreign. Sherlock abhors apologising. He never does anything he doesn’t mean to do and therefore he never does anything he wants to apologise for. But John is normal – in this particular way, at least – and he likes apologies. And John is also angry and that was an unintended side-effect of what Sherlock decided to do, so maybe an apology is appropriate. He waits.
Holmes turned away from me and methodically removed his coat and hat. Underneath, I could see that he had dressed hurriedly. His shirt was improperly buttoned, and he wore neither tie nor cravat, not even his waistcoat.
“That I – about what I said.”
Of course he had known. It had been an insane act of hubris ever to attempt to keep it from him. Had I not seen his methods in action, I would have suspected him to be in league with the Devil, so boundless and so frequently irritating was his knowledge of all that I seemed to do, think and feel.
This was the state of affairs when one night, after a long day at the end of a long week spent chasing down the man responsible for a grotesque and convoluted crime involving a peacock, a stolen antique Aztec sacrificial knife and a map of the London sewers, Holmes and I were caught in a torrential winter downpour and were soaked to the skin before we could hunt down a cab. Sitting in the hansom, shivering and laughing at Holmes, who had removed his hat to reveal hair plastered to his head and whose clothes were clinging to him in a rather interesting manner, I was as happy as the detective himself, who had contrived not only to catch the criminal but to present his ingenious solution to the case with a particularly theatrical flourish in front of half of Scotland Yard's finest, to the chagrin of Lestrade and two other inspectors who had been chasing entirely the wrong man for a week. Taking a rather uncharacteristic risk, I slid closer to my him in the cab, feeling the cold of wet tweed and then the warmth of his skin beneath as my leg pressed against his. Placing one of my hands discreetly between us so that it rested half on my thigh and half on his, I leaned back in my seat and sighed in contentment at the thought of a warm fire, one of Mrs Hudson's excellent suppers and a night spent celebrating another success in Holmes’ bed. I was still shivering, however, and the wound in my shoulder was aching. As the minutes passed, the exhaustion that I often experienced after one of our cases hit me suddenly and much harder than usual. Holmes glanced at me in concern as I shifted restlessly and rubbed at my shoulder through the wet fabric of my waistcoat and shirt.
I nodded at him as I moved towards the door, my mind on other matters.
“I have enjoyed ‘liaisons’ with men and women on three different continents,” I said. “I knew the risks I was taking. Had they resulted in infamy, arrest or any other unwelcome outcome, I would never have laid the blame at anyone else's door. There is no one on earth I trust to keep my secrets more than you – and should they be discovered you are the last man against whom I should ever lay the blame for allowing me to enact my own desires and pursue my own happiness. As generous as you seem to think me, I am quite a selfish fellow really. After all, I place you in just as much danger as you place me – more so, given than I do not share your talents for disguise, concealment and fabrication.”
Then the faces of my brigade were crowding around me once again and the air was full of the hacking cough of the bone saw and the smell of blood and rot and I was calling out the names of my friends in desperation as they died one by one.
“Egotist,” I murmured, inches from his lips.
I almost refused. I had opened my mouth to tell him to go to hell when his lips closed on my earlobe and he caressed it so gently and with such wicked intent that I instantly remembered his mouth on another part of my anatomy and I felt myself harden in seconds beneath my clothes. Holmes was kissing his slow, clever way back down my neck, already sliding my coat from my shoulders, as I stood and, without a word, did as he ordered, allowing him to slip my coat off before I leant forward, bracing my forearms on the surface of the crate, my revolver lying close beside me.
“My dear doctor, you cannot expect me to believe that you had not the faintest desire to discover what new skills ‘Tadpole’ has learned in the past two decades? After all, you are only human,” he teased.
“Thank you, but that is not in the least necessary,” I insisted. “I am merely tired after our recent exertions. I will retire now. A good night's rest will take care of things. I'll see you in the morning.”
The next day, I found him in the same position, still sunk into a vacant abstraction that seemed utterly out of character for the energetic and driven man I had come to know. So strongly did his torpor impress itself upon me that I felt an urge to take his pulse and examine his pupils in search of evidence of some factor, internal or external, that could have contributed to such a profound change. Instead, I tore myself away. Not wishing to step out into the drab rain and cold winds of London in January, I determined to withdraw to my quarters and pass my time in reading. My reluctance to witness Holmes in this unexplained state of extreme lethargy and my pangs at his disinterest in engaging with me – or the world at large – may seem extreme, but I had not quite realised until then how central a role he had come to play in my life. My surreptitious study of him had become a strange sort of hobby in a life empty of other diversions and I had even begun to compile a small list of his eccentricities and habits in an attempt to unravel the many mysteries that surrounded him. Some of that list I shared in the public account of our early acquaintance detailed in A Study in Scarlet, but I confess there were many aspects of the details I had noticed about him that I deemed unfit for public perusal.
“What a lovely thing a rose is!” he remarked dreamily, studying its brilliant petals. He lapsed into silence, staring pensively at the bloom.
When Holmes returned, not long after me, he was unusually flushed and as gleeful as I had ever seen him.
Even as protests rose to my lips and I glanced around reflexively, filled with a sudden fear that I'd be confronted with an unwelcome audience among the trees, I felt a flush of heat course though me. I made a valiant effort to disregard it.
“In that case, please convey to him that my sentiments towards his union have changed. I no longer see fit to stand in his way. I have decided to leave London behind and relocate to the continent. To do so, I will need funds.”
“It is too late, Wainwright,” Holmes said softly but implacably. “I have taken the precaution of preserving the contents of the pipe you gave Whitney. I believe that a few simple tests will demonstrate that it is packed with something a trifle deadlier than opium. I must thank you for acting so promptly. My problem, you see, was that I had no way of knowing when you would move against Whitney, only that your pattern showed that it was inevitable that you would. My disguise allowed me to monitor your activities, but I could not maintain it forever. Despite the fact that you thought me to be engaged on another case, I have seen how carefully you operate and knew that it might be a matter of several days until you made your move. When Watson unwittingly goaded you into arresting me, I realised it was the perfect blind. Once you knew that I was behind bars, I was confident that you would seize the opportunity to act, safe in the knowledge that I was not at liberty to interfere and assuming, as I had not done so at once, that I would not reveal my identity to the men of Bow Street.”
“No. Go to sleep John.”
At the strange look Stamford gave me over his wineglass, I immediately regretted my choice of words, though I had intended them to have no hidden meaning. I had always been careful to conduct my affairs discreetly at Bart’s, yet suddenly I feared that some unsavoury rumour about my lifestyle had reached his ears.
I yelped as the sharp corner of a chair dug into my hip bone, just as the match went out, plunging us back into utter, terrifying darkness.
“I am a consulting detective. I suppose I am the only one in the world – perhaps that goes some way to explaining my touchiness on the subject of my methods,” he said. “And yet the way I spoke to you was unthinkably cruel.”
It’s embarrassing and for a moment Sherlock is furious that John has made him admit it. Sherlock doesn’t trip. He’s trained in dance and fencing and mixed martial arts. He doesn’t stumble over carpets.
“He is not here,” I said, rather lamely. “And yet I could have sworn that I saw him.”
“I see that what attracts you to men is not so far from what attracts you to women after all,” Holmes said, somewhat acidly. “I confess, I had assumed that your appreciation for the female form might lead you to choose a rather more substantial specimen when your impulse drew you in direction of men.”
“What on earth do you mean, my dear fellow? Why should I not accompany you?”
After eliciting a promise that Whitney, as well as myself and Holmes, should present ourselves at the station in the morning to issue formal statements, the inspector led Wainwright, who was ranting and cursing, incoherent with anger, down the narrow staircase, bound for the cells where he had so recently taken Holmes. Only when the sound of their footsteps had faded did Holmes relax. As soon as he did so, he staggered and half fell against the open door. I was there in a moment, my arms around his thin frame, all skin and bone, as he slumped in exhaustion. For a moment, I forgot the presence of Whitney and the very grave dangers that faced us both if I ever I lost sight of the amiable, passionless façade we must adopt in public.
“No. You didn’t. You did not need to know what it felt like. You’d already seen its fucking effects. You’ve never stabbed yourself in the chest but you accept that as a cause of death. You’ve never hung yourself or shot yourself in the head or jumped off a building. Once you figured out it was a drug you just couldn’t resist knowing how the high felt, could you? Even if it killed you. It’s not my safety you don’t care about, it’s your own. It could have sent us both mad, for fuck’s sake. Did you even think about that?”
The desire to help my old friend warred with my instinct to protect Holmes. It was clear that Phelps suspected an attachment between us. To confirm it would be to reveal nothing new about myself but to uncover something deeply private about Holmes. I thought quickly, aware of Phelps’ scrutiny.
“Wait. The ‘speckled band,’ you said. Why speckled?”
“I’m still cross with you,” John says, climbing in beside Sherlock and then moving over to brace himself on top of the detective, looking down into his face. “I want to give you what you want. But I can’t do that if you never ask for it.”
He did not invite me to join him. So abruptly dismissed, I took myself upstairs, where I began to pace my room from end to end, until, realising that I was behaving like a caged animal, I forced myself to delve into a very dense treatise on pathology, which for a time drowned out my thoughts.
“It cannot be egotism to state a fact that is supported by ample data. I confess I was thrown off initially by your obvious admiration for several of the women who visited us in the early days of our acquaintance, but once I studied the evidence at my disposal it was clear to me that the scope of your interest was not limited to their doubtful charms. I did not miss the way you sized up Gregson, my dear boy, as well as several of our male clients. You are commendably subtle in your attentions, but you do have a tendency to let your eyes wander to some rather revealing places. And then there was the way you stared at me when I was playing the violin – it was gratifying, certainly, but hardly subtle, you must own.”
“Perhaps the fever has left him in a weakened state that necessitates some assistance,” I observed, attempting the clinical tones of a professional.
“Perhaps she would be blond and gentle and utterly lacking in imagination,” I said, shifting closer on the grass and pushing Holmes gently onto his back so that I could lay my head on the sun-warmed expanse of his chest. “Or perhaps she would be tall and slender and grey-eyed and unfathomably brilliant. Perhaps, no matter how much I fought it, I would end up falling in love with her. I’d open a successful medical practice and she’d read to me of an evening and no one would get attacked by hellhounds, or shot at, or killed.”
Sherlock doesn’t make promises. Not to Lestrade, not to Mycroft, not even to Mrs Hudson. But this one doesn’t seem so terrible. All he’s promising, after all, is not to make John angry on purpose anymore. And not to do anything that might mean that John can’t stay with him. It’s not like he wants John to be angry. Or gone.
Suddenly, after what can only have been hours but felt like weeks, I heard a clatter and the sudden strike and flare of a match. Holmes was on his feet, his face twisted with horror and disgust, striking wildly with his cane at the bell-pull beside the bed. I rushed forward, confused and terrified for his safety, but as I drew close he thrust me away from him so forcefully that I stumbled and almost fell.
His attention was soon diverted back to his test tube, however, and I marvelled at his eagerness as he drew me over to his table by one of my sleeves, touching me unselfconsciously and leading me with an unstudied certainty that caused me to follow him without question. He seemed to feel no pain as he pierced his finger with a long bodkin and drew off the blood needed for his experiment, but I found I was not watching the water to which he added the liquid but the way in which he sucked the lingering smear of blood off the long index finger of his left hand. To my surprise and shame, I felt a surge of liquid heat in my stomach, a swooping sensation that I had not experienced in as long as I could remember. I hastened to fix my gaze on his experiment and made some desultory remark, I scarcely remember what. All the time I feigned attention, I was busy assessing the dangers of choosing to share a living space with a man as dangerously attractive as Sherlock Holmes. Yet as I found my gaze drawn back to the excitement on his face and the way his large, scarred hands danced as he spoke, I realised I was more interested by his character than by anything that had crossed my path since the war. His eyes glittered with passion as he outlined the importance of his discovery and I confess I answered in a daze, interjecting a muttered one-word response where he seemed to require one. It was a relief when he turned his attention back to Stamford, freeing me from the intensity of his gaze, and I had a few moments to collect myself.
Holmes smiled one of his most arch and feline smiles.
“You could have waited. I was right behind you. One flight. I turned the corner just in time to see you go out the window. Do you have any idea what I…”
I felt a terrible urge to press the point but knew that I had already worsened my own situation. Holmes was not a man to turn away from a puzzle. He must now be wondering, if he had not been already, what was so important about the strange unspoken moment that had passed between us the previous evening.
“Why am I…? Because I love you and you threw yourself out of a second storey window and made me watch. Because your bloody calculations don’t make you invincible…”
Holmes sat beside me on the crate, his shoulder pressed to mine, and we resumed our silent vigil. I do not know how much time passed but I found that the worries and questions that had plagued my mind all day no longer intruded on my thoughts. I was content to sit in companionable silence, listening to Holmes breathing beside me. When at last we heard a scraping sound and saw a sudden gleam of light, he was on his feet in an instant, as swift and silent as cat hunting its prey. He waited, a lithe figure caught in the slowly increasing glow like a performer in the spotlight, as a slit opened in the stone paving of the floor and a white hand began to raise a slab, pushing it upwards until it overturned with a crash.
“Here.”
She’s already standing up to leave but he needs her to stay.
“My dear Watson,” he said. “Willing though I am to have you stare into my eyes, may I ask what you are doing? You look as though you are trying to solve a very difficult equation, or perhaps attempting to diagnose a rare disease.”
I thought I felt his lips brush the top of my head, so lightly I might have imagined it. Perhaps it was simply his breath stirring my hair.
To my relief, the question seemed to jar Holmes out of his meditation. Returning to himself, he began to take his leave with every assurance that he would test his theories in London and return to Woking as soon as he had completed his investigations.
“Inspector Bradstreet is tied up, but he says we are to give you fifteen minutes with the old beggar,” he said. “Tell Mr Holmes that we hope to see him down at the station soon.”
“I heard you calling for me,” he said, and I covered my face with my hands.
“He is from home,” I said, as calmly as I could manage. “I’m afraid I do not know when he is likely to return.”
Instead of rolling to one side, John levers himself forward to press a soft kiss into Sherlock’s hair, just over his forehead. He reaches over the side of the bed for the horrible hospital trousers, wipes them both clean and lies back down atop Sherlock’s body, resting his head into the dip of Sherlock’s shoulder, just above his heart.
“Yeah, I know, high-functioning sociopath,” he says. “Only you’re not. That’s not even a thing. I’ve done the research.”
It was at the scene of the murder in Lauriston Gardens, which I described in such dramatic detail for the public in A Study in Scarlet, that I first saw Holmes truly in his natural element. I observed the way he executed his performance outside the house, making his leisurely way up and down the pavement, gazing around him at the rather ordinary street as though it held secrets too arcane for the rest of us to comprehend. I saw how his slow yet thorough examination, lingering over the mess of footprints on the path, irritated Inspector Gregson, who stood waiting for him with his impatience showing nakedly on his face. I could not help but feel that Holmes was enjoying his rather theatrical examination and that a small part of his object was irritate the man who had summoned him so peremptorily. Inside the house, however, all posturing ceased. Seeming almost to crackle with barely contained energy, Holmes rushed about the room, ignoring the ghastly body that dominated my own attention with its bulging eyes and twisted face, and its strange, contorted posture, which gave the dead man an almost animal-like appearance. Holmes first examined the walls, fireplace and floors of the room, and I found my gaze drawn to his rangy form as he ran gentle fingers over the stained walls and folded himself down on hands and knees to examine with minute care a corner of the room that appeared, to my untrained eyes, to be empty. At last he approached the body. Even then, his focus was on the great sprays and whorls of blood that encircled it. He seemed almost to read them, staring at them with a singular focus, his grey eyes narrowed, like a scholar striving to translate some ancient language, or a code-breaker attempting to fit a cypher to an unfamiliar pattern.
And when Lestrade, finding a woman’s wedding ring at the scene of the crime as the body was finally removed, waved it triumphantly under Holmes’ nose, exclaiming, “This complicates matters!” I saw a brief flicker cross Holmes’ implacable face and felt certain that he was struggling to suppress a laugh. He met my eyes with a twinkle in his own that betrayed his amusement and, though I had not the insight to understand what made Lestrade’s comment so amusing to my friend, I found myself on the verge of laughter as well and had to look away quickly, less my humour betray his. With perfect mastery of his features, he turned to the excited inspector with earnest curiosity.
“Ho – Holmes!”
“We have faced danger together before now,” I pointed out, as mildly as I could, for his words his struck me quite as forcibly as a blow. “If you doubt my courage, let me assure you that I am not deterred by the possibility of violence, even if it be at the formidable hands of Dr Roylott.”
“He always was a delicate fellow,” I noted absently, thinking of his wan face and the signs of strain on his features and wondering if my own face had looked thus in the weeks after my fever.
Holmes arched an eyebrow.
We lay in silence, breathing in tandem, until eventually I fell asleep, my head still cushioned on his wiry chest. When I awoke, several hours later, he was gone.
“It’s not enough,” he gasped brokenly. “I need –” He stopped. “John, I need you.”
When Holmes explained that Harrison had fled, I knew at once that he had let it happen. I had seen his wiry strength. He would have been more than capable of subduing the smaller man once he had successfully disarmed him.
“That was rather impressive,” I owned, rubbing my aching centre against the narrow indent where his torso met his lean thigh. “Where on earth did you learn to –”
When I finally made it to the Bow Street station the following morning, after a night very nearly as sleepless as those I had spent when Holmes was missing, I demanded to speak to him on the pretext of questioning him about the whereabouts of my friend. I could not have gained admittance were it not for the happy chance that the two constables on duty had several times called on Holmes for help and recognised me immediately.
“Inspector Bradstreet, your assistance is needed,” he drawled.
“It would seem, on the contrary, that I failed to maintain the ‘charade’ for a single minute, since you have obviously been aware of what I was attempting since the moment I awakened. Which event, by the way, has occurred far too soon for my liking. Have you any idea of what time it was when you finally allowed me to sleep?”
He hummed to himself, a soft sound of surprise, as though my confirmation was unexpected.
“You!” he exclaimed. “I should have known that you’d be lurking around here again, doing your master’s bidding like a trained hound. You don’t frighten me, doctor. You can tell Holmes that he had better to face me himself than to send his lackey to spy on me.”
“And what would this wife of yours be like?” he asked.
“John, answer me, damn you” he hissed, as though he had not heard the chilling cry.
This time it was he who placed his cold hand atop mine. His gratitude was conveyed in a gentle squeeze of his fingers and I turned my palm upwards and squeezed his bony hand back, grateful in turn that he had not pried into what lay between myself and the consulting detective on whom his own happiness – and the security of Britain – now depended.
Sitting beside Holmes in the darkened concert hall, the raw emotional power of Sarasate thrumming through my body, I was more than usually aware of his long, lean legs inches from my own and the way his shoulder pressed against mine as he lost himself in the music. As I breathed in his unique smell of fog and smoke and London evenings, a certain portion of me began to harden and it occurred to me that, should Holmes not wish to indulge further in the physical side of our relationship, spending time with him was destined to become even more torturous than it had been when I believed him to be oblivious to my lust for him.
“I saw no other option,” I objected. “Once I knew that they were speaking with an undertaker it became clear that every moment was precious. I thought I might still be in time to save her.”
“Dr Watson, would you care to lend your assistance in this interview?” he enquired.
“You admire her,” I said, and my voice must have betrayed my agitation because he turned to me and examined my face carefully.
When I reached him, I caught at his elbow and he turned on his heel, a look of surprise washing over his face as he saw me standing behind him. The heat of his breath sent a plume of fog into the darkening air and I saw again how he’d looked bending down to her amid the swirling smoke.
“I can see you in such a role,” he said.
“When you consulted it in the laboratory, I noticed the scratches around the keyhole.”
“So you’re fine then,” he says.
Holmes sighed and I heard the bedclothes rustle as he moved. The room was dark but I intuited from the sound that he had been lying with his back to me and had turned over to face in my direction.
It was as tangled a matter as any Holmes had taken on and I found myself somewhat relieved that we had not travelled to Woking only to be faced with a problem that was unworthy of his skills. Poor Phelps was evidently drained by the time he finished recounting how an important naval treaty had mysteriously vanished from his possession and I could see that, although his attack of brain-fever had abated, he was far from well. His fiancée poured him a glass of some sort of medication and he took it gratefully, bestowing a small smile on her. I watched them for a few moments, unguardedly, as Holmes sat in silence with his eyes closed, deep in thought and apparently oblivious to his surroundings.
“Handel or Mendelssohn?”
“You know why I want to remain here,” I said in despair. “You know exactly why, just as you always know everything.”
“Watson?” I heard him mutter, his voice a deep rasp.
“Why not? Why isn’t seeing more evidence of your death wish a turn on?”
The look he gave me was searching, almost desperate.
“You still could have been hurt. Why couldn’t you just have told me what was going to happen? I could have helped. Made sure you weren’t bitten.”
Sherlock actually stops talking under the weight of John’s glare.
It was a moment before he replied and when he did his voice was cool and mocking.
“I do not speak to you of matters that you do not need to know about,” he said. “I did not tell you about Moriarty because he will never be allowed near you. Not while I am alive.”
“The fever has abated,” I said. “Thank you for your help but you need not feel obliged to stay. I am sorry that my illness disturbed your rest.”
“Did it strike you?” He asked, almost shaking me in his agitation. “Are you bitten?”
“But really, Holmes,” I insisted, when I had mastered my emotions. “I was planning to return to London tomorrow. What more is there to do in Montpellier?”
“She is an enigma,” he replied dreamily, as though to himself. “I was able to learn something of her from a crowd of ostlers, who believed me to be a groom. What they told me of her habits was intriguing enough that I doffed my disguise and was able to arrange to speak to her myself as she prepared to drive out, by contriving to ask her for directions. She is gently spoken and yet I sense that she has an iron will. She will make an uncommonly interesting opponent. From the little I have seen of her, she is a woman of remarkable poise and intelligence.”
This time, Holmes’ interview with Phelps went as expected, despite the fact that it was conducted in the presence of both the Harrisons. Rather than rhapsodising about religion or flowers – two subjects that I had never known to interest Holmes in the slightest, unless they had bearing on a murder – he asked a few probing questions that elicited more detail about the attempted break in, without revealing that Phelps had recognised the perpetrator. Miss Harrison stood up to join us when Holmes suggested a turn around the garden, but he bade her sternly to remain behind, charging her not to quit the room. To my surprise, however, when Joseph Harrison expressed an intent to join us, Holmes acquiesced immediately.
“Can you not?” said Holmes, leaning down to place a kiss on the exposed back of my neck.
The tenderness in his voice moved me more than I expected and I reached out to pat the thin hand that lay beside mine. I was gladder than I knew how to express to find that, after all, what lay between him and his fiancée was built on genuine regard.
“Of course, Dr Watson,” he said. “I’ll be back for you in fifteen minutes. I hope the old fellow is useful to you. Inspector Wainwright questioned him last night but based on his mood afterwards I don’t think he got much out of him. The man looked half dead by the time I did the rounds last night and he’s barely moved since then.”
“You possess many talents that he does not,” he said, laying one large hand across the small of my back so that I was pinned against him. I rested my weight on the right arm so that I could look down at his smiling face. “At least, I have not seen any mention of them thus far in The Strand. I am rather glad, to tell you the truth. I should not much relish half of London becoming on intimate terms with the Doctor John Watson I know.”
Holmes was clearly a man of scientific bent and I confess I was surprised when he mentioned that he played the violin. He laughed off my suggestion that a badly played violin was a din that should not be lived with before I had even finished expressing the thought, as though utterly certain of his own abilities, and I found myself even more intrigued by his extreme confidence, which seemed almost to border on egotism. It was with this same confidence that he declared the matter settled, without waiting for my acquiescence, and something about his certainty calmed my lingering doubts. As I shook his hand, too aware of the strength of his grip and the warmth of his calloused fingers, I was already looking forward to noon the following day, when we would meet again. It was the first time I had looked forward to anything in a very long time.
I still feel a flush of shame when I recall the incident that finally led me to discover the nature of his work. On the fourth morning of his strange state of lethargy, I found myself sitting across from him as he picked at his breakfast. Unsettled by his uncharacteristic silence, I picked up a magazine and attempted to lose myself in reading. The article on which my eye fell, which had been marked with pencil, delved into something called “The Science of Deduction and Analysis.” A more self-important piece of writing I thought I had seldom seen. The author claimed that by a simple process of examining and analysing his surroundings he was able to deduce the most intimate personal details and private thoughts of any individual, plumbing the depths of the human mind through astute interpretation of a raised eyebrow or a clenched fist, the twitch of a muscle or the flicker of the eye. So accurate and unexpected were the results of such a study, the author claimed, that the observer would appear as a magician to the object of his deductions. Stressing the importance of pure logic in all things, he suggested that readers might train themselves in this strange art by first learning to distinguish a man’s occupation at a glance by examining some mundane aspects of his personage and clothing. This was too much for me and I began to expostulate aloud.
I shook him by the shoulder, somewhat more violently than intended, and he gave a lazy, drugged smile.
“Even if we could save him, should we?” I heard him say.
“Fifteen minutes, Watson. I’m impressed,” my friend said, and there was a teasing note of intimacy in his voice that I had never heard before.
“He cannot have fled,” the mans said. “The door was locked from the inside and this old beggar hardly seems likely to have aided him in a quick escape. Besides, the only way out is the stairs and we did not pass him coming up.”
The client and John speak at the same moment, her tone outraged, John’s the one he uses when he thinks Sherlock’s being rude in a way he doesn’t find amusing.
“Because I love you, too,” he said. “I have loved you for months. I never thought I had succeeded in keeping it from you.”
John’s shoulders are shaking and for a moment Sherlock thinks he’s hyperventilating after all. Or perhaps sobbing. Then he realises that it’s laughter.
Holmes glanced curiously at me but said mildly, “Of course you are most welcome to remain, I shall be glad of your presence.”
Holmes looked up at me over the top of his newspaper. He was lounging in an attitude of total repose, his legs sprawled across the length of the sofa and crossed over at the ankle as he read. His face was blandly curious, as though he had no idea to what I was referring, but I had seen his considerable skill at acting and knew that I could not trust his expression to reflect whatever he was truly thinking.
For a moment he sounded very distant and grave and I wondered if he was trying to divert my attention by drawing me into an abstract discussion about human nature. Determined to elicit a full explanation of his extraordinary speech, I refused to be drawn.
And somehow, despite the myriad possible responses running through his mind, Sherlock does.
“And the injury?” I said finally, convinced at last of his methods and curious, despite myself, to hear what tell-tale signs had betrayed me. “How did you know that I had taken a gunshot wound to the shoulder and what did you mean when you said that I was the cause of my own continuing pain?”
“I thought about running my hand up your thigh during that concert we went to after the client in Brighton lent us his box for the night,” he murmured, increasing his pace too little. “I wondered what you would do if, in the middle of the second half, you felt me slide my palm up the inside of your thigh. Would you have objected? Shifted in your seat? Made a sound? Or would you have sat silently, obedient to my whims, growing hard beneath my touch as I stroked over your trouser front in the dark? What if I had teased you, in the middle of the crowd, until you couldn't hear the music anymore because the only thing you were aware of was my touch? Would you have held out or would you have succumbed right there, releasing in your trousers, your gasps covered by the sound of the orchestra?”
“Should you?” Holmes seemed to have woken up. For the first time in days, something of the familiar animation had come back into his face and there was a hint of colour in his cheeks. In the warm morning light, his hair looked very black and his skin very pale. He was regarding me with such a strange, calculating look that I began to feel unaccountably nervous.
It was inevitable, of course, that the glow must wear off and some form of reckoning arrive in its wake. After our morning interlude, I retired to my room, leaving Holmes in privacy while I conducted my toilet. When I descended, I found him at the breakfast table. His hair had been neatly combed, all traces of our night’s activity were hidden beneath his characteristically fastidious attire and his face was buried in the newspaper. The normality of the scene, one I had encountered dozens of times, often rising later than him as I did, aroused in me a sense of unreality. It seemed impossible that the events of the night could have transpired as I remembered them. It was only the lingering taste of him on my tongue that convinced me that I was not going mad.
Phelps had noticed the direction of my gaze, for his took my hand softly in his and squeezed it wordlessly. I knew then that he had ascertained what lay between Holmes and I and that my prevarication had been useless. But in the face of his silent reassurance, I also knew that we need fear nothing from him. Holmes and Harrison began to stroll back towards us and I turned hastily towards Phelps. We were engaged in conversation about his plans for the grounds that summer when Holmes drew up soundlessly beside us. I had not realised that Phelps was still clasping my hand until he let it go. Turning to Harrison, who had also joined our small group, he took his arm and began to make his slow way back towards the house while Holmes walked swiftly over to the window of the bedroom where Annie Harrison waited. Ignoring my presence beside him entirely, he exhorted her in the strongest possible terms not to leave the room all day. To my surprise, he charged her to lock the room before retiring, remarking casually that Phelps would be returning to London with us that same evening.
“And what, pray, would you have done to ensure the retreat of the foul creature?” he said. “You ran towards it with no weapon on your person. I did not realise that a campaign in Afghanistan qualified you to kill snakes with your bare hands. Congratulations, doctor, your skills are more varied than I realised.”
He turns on his heel, that abrupt military swivel, and walks out of the bathroom, leaving Sherlock staring at himself in the mirror as he tries to fix the mad bird's nest that has replaced his usual neat helmet of curls. John doesn’t walk into Sherlock’s bedroom, which he has taken to sharing more often than not over the last six weeks since Sherlock finally stopped pretending not to notice that John had stopped running his eyes up Sherlock’s neck and over his arse reflexively and started doing it when he thought Sherlock wasn’t looking. Instead, John heads towards the kitchen. Tea, then. John is nothing if not predictable in his habits, even if his emotions never quite seem to be what Sherlock is expecting. It isn’t until Sherlock hears John’s feet on the stairs, slow and somehow defeated, that he realises John is going up to his own bedroom.
At this she turned even paler and began to sob quietly, wringing her hands in anguish. Despite my own anxiety, I was struck by her suffering and overcome with an urge to do what I could for her.
“He is calling for morphine,” he said dismissively.
“Well Watson, if you do not have any pressing matters to attend to, would you care to accompany me to Briony Lodge?” he asked. “I believe it is time to see what our opponent is made of and whether we shall be able to aid our client. I could use your help in carrying out a small scheme that should yield some conclusive results.”
When we had regained our breath, he withdrew from me and I collapsed on my back onto the crate. To my surprise, Holmes lowered himself down atop me, resting his head in the curve of my shoulder. I was about to speak when I felt him shaking and realised that he was laughing.
That earned him a swift, sharp bite on the side of his neck and he let out a soft gasp. I smiled against his throat, breathing in the scent of his skin.
The case has achieved its aims – John reacted exactly as he was supposed to and Sherlock will have plenty of time to analyse his own reaction later – but Sherlock still likes this part. Showing off, John calls it, but if he doesn’t explain his deductions the police will never figure it out for themselves, even with the solution in front of them. Can't work backwards, let alone forwards. The state of the British police force is a tragedy, really. Except for Sherlock personally, of course, for whom it's a bit of a boon.
“John?”
I answered at once, as gravely as I ever had.
“I did, maybe,” he says. “Yes, a bit. For a little while. But not anymore. Not now I’m with you.”
“A mistake,” he said, with an incredulous laugh. “That is what you call it? I sent you to spy on a pair of murderous thieves who almost killed you. What possible reason could you have for wanting to remain here?”
I held his gaze.
“You tell me how you feel.”
“Don't leave me,” I entreated.
Holmes did not speak. I had not expected him to. But he pulled me roughly to him so that my head came to rest in the angle of his shoulder and tightened one arm around me where I lay against his side.
When John comes back, Sherlock is curled up on his side, facing the wall. He waits until John has switched the light off and climbed into bed to roll over and press his body up against John’s bare back, warm and slightly damp from the shower.
Despite the blow to my pride and the unwelcome evidence that my careful efforts to hide my weaknesses from Holmes had failed utterly, I must confess I was impressed beyond measure by the tiny observations that had led him to develop so complete and accurate a portrait of me. I had not known myself that I moved my arm more naturally when distracted, and although it was not entirely welcome news, signifying as it did the extent to which the state of my shattered mind was responsible for my slow recovery, I was gratified to think that perhaps my injury might not be as crippling as I had previously thought.
“There is one talent of my own that I did not get a chance to display last night,” I murmured, beginning to slide slowly down the bed. Holmes’ pupils were dark, dilated with desire, and I pushed away the memory of their vacant morphine glaze as I worked my way down his torso, running my lips over lean muscle, enjoying the way he arched beneath me, seeking a firmer touch. It was my turn to tease, and I took my time, refusing to accede to the silent urging of his body as I nuzzled into the angular indentations around his pelvis. By the time I took him into my mouth, he was swollen and leaking with need and I relished the involuntary gasp he gave as I swirled my tongue around his not inconsiderable girth. Holmes may have deduced more than I had ever guessed about me, but I possessed certain skills that he could never have divined, given the nature of our friendship.
“Don't. Just don’t,” says John. He sounds tired. “I know who you are. I know and I’m not asking you to change. Not really. You can steal my gun and put body parts in my bed and goad me into doing whatever you want, within reason, but you will not put yourself in unnecessary danger anymore. I mean it, Sherlock. I can’t spend my life thinking you’re going to be snatched away from me. I just. I don’t know if I can live with your death wish.”
The predatory challenge in those eyes could not be mistaken, they were daring Sherlock to join the Captain upstairs and be the next to feel his talented hands and the heat of his candles. Sherlock rose to his feet and placed his drink on the coffee table and did the only thing he could think of. With a flourish of his coat he turned and strode, just short of ran, out of the club… a husky, deep laughter following him which only caused him to blush and move faster.
The soldier leaned in to the woman and whispered something in her ear, apparently this persona was much more talkative, which caused her to shiver again before nodding and the man smiled evilly beneath his mask before the dungeon master returned with a cup, not unlike the one Sherlock had used on the man previously. True to his expectations, this cup too was filled with ice which the soldier put on his table before picking up a simple blindfold and taking away the woman’s sight. With gentle hands the soldier began to rub the woman’s back, his progress only slightly impeded by the rope which constituted her clothing for the evening. The Captain massaged her neck, back, buttocks, legs and feet with skill and concentration until she was a puddle beneath him. Only then did he pull out a cube of the ice and the scene truly began. The Captain traced the ropes with the ice, then her major veins and muscles, chilling her skin and making her squirm with the sensation. He hadn’t gaged her, so they were all privy to her gasps, mewls and breathy pleas.
Sherlock had once managed a quick glance at the man’s Club tag, sitting temptingly at the man’s hip, he’s seen the colour coding clearly. Though every hint and every line of this man told Sherlock he was strong and not to be taken lightly, despite his short stature, that he was a man used to control and power he was marked as a Code Black S. A no holds barred submissive.
The action should have appeared graceless and clunky but somehow it worked well with this new persona, arms stretched out over the back of the sofa with one coincidentally just behind Sherlock’s head the man relaxed and said nothing as his eyes openly evaluated the room. With one leg, the one closest to Sherlock, stretched out to the coffee table in front of him and the other bent at the knee with the heal of his thick boot on the plush leather beneath him, the soldier exuded masculine strength and drew the eye of many an eager and unattached patron. Though they couldn’t be blamed, the man was a sight to behold and his very presence sent heat through those around him. Sherlock did his best to appear unaffected, and though outwardly he succeeded he was concerned with the physical reactions he was unable to control. His temperature had risen, as well as his heart beat and the slightest hitch of his breathing when the other man can come so close to him. This was not something Sherlock was familiar with, though he’d seen it enough from others while at the club. He desired this man, physically. An idea he’d suspected while he’d dominated the other, but it was surprising to find his desire as strong, if not stronger, considering the man’s change in behaviour.
“For your sake and mine, I hope he practiced good dental hygiene but I doubt it.” The Hyena like Wesen were scavengers much like their animal kingdom counterparts and not known for cleanliness.
The Dominant was trying to restrain the Soldier from behind in an arm lock while his submissive straddled the soldier and was basically trying to distract him in any way he could. Teeth, claw like nails, flashes of skin, a well-placed grope, everything was fair play in this game. Sherlock watched with a slight twitch of his lips, and the female rubbing against his leg while purring, as the Soldier expertly twisted his hips and threw the submissive off him and used the momentum to break the Dominant’s hold on his arms, grab the man around the middle, lift him, drop him and pin him. All a testament to the Soldier’s flexibility and strength as the Dominant was almost twice his size and the Submissive not much smaller. The Submissive attempted to remove the Soldier from his Dom but merely ended up on top of his partner, both uselessly pinned under the Soldier until the Dungeon Mistress called the match over.
“Oh, don’t be so melodramatic…” Sherlock stood but when his eyes met the Doctors he paused, there was something he couldn’t read in them and Sherlock prided himself on reading people. “Would dinner suffice?”
Sherlock’s confusion lasted only a moment until he saw the Master nod and hand back the knife, which the Captain proceeded to use to slice the wax expertly from the submissive’s skin much to her apparent delight. Her gasps and moans only increased as he removed the wax and drew abstract patterns on her skin with the tip of the blade, never breaking the skin but the risk was always there which seemed to increase the woman’s excitement. Once the wax was removed the man took a small hand towel and wiped her back down as much as he could with the rope still in place before he began to untie her, taking time to massage each of her limbs as they were released to ensure correct blood flow. ‘Lucy’ stayed perfectly still during this, she seemed to have no strength in her and Sherlock realised he was seeing a true Sub-Drop as the woman was sat up and her blindfold removed. Immediately the solider pulled her back to his chest and wrapped his arms around her, regulating his breathing and forcing her to follow.
So now John was being accused of being a Grimm himself, of actually being Sherlock, as a rather ostentatiously large arrow was aimed at Sarah’s unprotected chest from his own position restrained in a chair. He’d seen the power of the arrow in the show and knew that if he were to make one wrong move Sarah would be dead, John was fast but was he fast enough to break free of his chains, get past those who stood between them and save Sarah in time? It was not a risk he was willing to take, not with an innocent life hanging in the balance.
Though their voiced were hushed John could clearly see both men becoming agitated, and the way Travis was clearing at the man had John moving before he could think better of it. John strode towards the counter, an overly chipper smile on his lips as he drew out his wallet.
The heavy feeling settled again in Sherlock’s own chest as he watched the woman, practically boneless, melt into the ‘Captain’s’ arms. At that moment he could have done anything to the complacent bunny, and she would have gladly allowed it.
“ah…”
“Doctor Watson,” Mr Holmes waited until John had closed the door before he spoke, he was leaning casually against the raised procedure bed waiting.
A polite tap of the door signalled that their time was at an end and Sherlock released a disappointed sigh, as did much of the audience, but the soldier simply stood there in stony silence trying to control his breathing which was notably heavier. The detective moved close to the soldier and leant in, the soft fabric of his shirt just ghosting the abused flesh of the other man’s back, as he began to undo the restraints.
The silence of the room was finally broken by the whistle of air, the sharp smack of leather on flesh and an involuntary intake of air.
“Keeping tabs on me Doctor?”
“You realise that you don’t need to recklessly injure yourself every day to come and visit me?” John scolded as he finished stitching the slash marks across Sherlock Holmes’s back, the shoulder wound from the day before was already weeks ahead of where it should be healing wise but that didn’t make it appropriate for the man to be out fighting again.
Still without saying a word Sherlock retrieved his riding crop from where he’d previously left it in anticipation of this moment. Allowing it to drift slowly up the man’s tanned and relatively unmarked back, tarnished by the scar of his wound but surprisingly not the beatings he’d received earlier through the week, and settle on his exposed neck before leaning in to whisper in the soldier’s exposed ear.
The details were scarce because officially the event never happened but what Mycroft had been able to discover was enough to make even Sherlock queasy.
So when Sherlock appeared in the shadows and began to distract the members of the Black Lotus Tong, John could finally feel his chest relax a touch. Unlike many other Wesen, John’s eyesight was perfect in the darkness and so he saw Sherlock appear out of nowhere with a flourish of his coat and begin to wreak havoc as only a Grimm, or perhaps as only a Holmes, could. Though John didn’t spare him a second thought as he watched General Shan lurch towards the arrow while Sherlock was fighting with one of her men, John Woged and felt the chains binding him warp and fall away from his wrists and ankles. He didn’t wait for them however, he was already moving with an enraged roar as he threw the soldiers who tried to rush him out of his way and threw himself towards Sarah as the arrow hurtled towards her. John only knew he’d succeeded when he felt the burning sensation in his right side, the beast within him howled but the soldier in John stamped it down and focused instead on the danger at hand. Freeing and protecting Sarah was his number one priority, Sherlock could take care of himself… though perhaps not if the way he was being strangled with a silk cord was anything to go by.
It was then that Sherlock realised just how he’d get The Woman’s attention.
“Tell me Mr. Holmes, when did you last eat. Tea and biscuits your Mrs Hudson provide do not count!”
Sherlock looked around the dimly lit room at the collection of people around him and marvelled at the influx of unprecedented data, for now he stayed in the background collecting his information, but the entire dynamic confused him. Scattered around this rather elite establishment were men and women of London, of whom Sherlock could tell you any number of banal things, and yet not one of them he would have previously connected to this place. Yet they looked more comfortable and relaxed than they had any right to be as they swanned about in lace, lycra, leather and little much else.
“You will not run from me again, understood?” The voice was one of command and authority, yet it was sultry and hoarse in a way that mad Sherlocks tongue heavy in his mouth as his mind supplied other things he would rather hear. “Is that Understood?”
John plastered on a professional smile and strode to the door. “All done Detective Holmes, until next time.”
It was said so casually that John almost missed the fact that this was the first time Sherlock, in their months of visits at the clinic, had ever asked for something and not simply demanded or manipulated to get his own way. Would wonders never cease?
John surged to his feet and lurched towards the tiny bathroom attached to his room and promptly threw up. Head swimming, stomach churning, breathing laboured and leg throbbing John stayed on the cool tiles, yellowed and cracked from years of use, until his stomach was empty and head slowly began to clear. Once the images cleared as much as they were going to and his shaking had settled enough that he could struggle to his feet John flushed the toilet and limped shakily to the sink. Running the water John rinsed out his mouth and washed his face, refusing to look in the mirror as he knew what he would see.
“We only have almond milk” He repeated as though John was particularly dense, rolling his elegant grey blue eyes in the process.
With her mouth against his ear and her arms around his neck the bunny spoke in a low husky voice to the soldier, though even as he grabbed her pert arse his eyes trailed to Sherlock and a smirk lifted those sinful lips.
Silently the consulting detective made his way to the waiting table in the corner and began to set out the implements he’d brought with him. There was not a sound in the room at first, but then in the silence other noises became loud. The steady tick of someone’s watch, the hushed breaths of those in the room, the gentle clinking of the chains which held the soldier in place, though they were not exactly needed as he still stood perfectly tall and at ease.
“Ack, fine. Tuesday.” John didn’t need to look at his calendar to confirm it was indeed Friday.
“Sorry? Have we met before?” John had never been to this particular café before, having only returned to London two weeks prior. John looked at the young barista properly and tried to place him. The young man was tall, he had more than half a foot on John which instantly put the doctor off, with messy black curls, elegantly chiselled features and those piercing blue eyes which were still looking at John like he were a simpleton.
“The think you’re perfectly placid, as threatening as that awful jumper you’re wearing” Sherlock claimed from his lounging position on his sofa, fingers steepled together on his chest, eyes closed in apparent thought. “They have no idea what you’re capable of…”
“Right, well then this will be our last visit Mr. Holmes.” John said with a grim finality, pulling off his blue surgical gloves with a snap, “I won’t treat patients with death wishes, I’m not that kind of Doctor.”
“Deflecting Detective?”
“Why else would I visit a physician?” Sherlock asked with a raised brow that the doctor couldn’t see but could hear in the tone alone.
Travis raised a brow incredulously at John, his sharp features striking.
It was not a pretty kiss, by most standards it wasn’t even a pleasant kiss, but it was a kiss, in fact it was one hell of a kiss. The soldier had met Sherlock part way, pulling the taller man down by his shirt, his lips crashing into Sherlock’s slightly parted ones. Before the detective had been able to register what was happening the man’s tongue was in his mouth and he was on the receiving end of a very thorough snogging.
“Sorry…?”
Sorry for the long wait but hopefully this makes up for it...
“Abartige Aasfresser…” Sherlock answered John’s unasked question, though the Doctor responded to the information with a low whistle.
As a man Doctor Watson was a highly qualified military doctor recently returned from service who, despite exceptional skill, qualification, experience and composure, had left high stakes medicine for a low paying position in a quiet doctor’s clinic. The doctor treated all patients openly and fairly, Wesen or Kehrseite it didn’t matter. This kept him very busy with Wesen and Kehrseite-Schlich-Kennen as experiences Wesen doctors, or ones that wouldn’t ask too many questions about suspicious injuries, were hard to come by. Sherlock respected John Watson the man.
Despite being a standing restraint Club rules dictated he could keep the Soldier longer in this room as long as his joints weren’t put under excessive pressure and there was limited risk of circulation problems.
The detective knew the moment the Soldier arrived, a ripple seemed to go through the club and many of the patrons began to look between the door and Sherlock, where he stood watching some of the electro-play in the Grand Foyer. The Soldier walked past Sherlock without pause and moved directly to the Dojo where a wrestling match had started up between a few of the regulars while they waited for more patrons to arrive. The Soldier, dressed again in his regulation kit only from the hips down, had chosen this time to wear only a half mask. The style was the same with a medieval feel, fabric that hooded his head and under his ears so that only his mouth and the barest hint of his nose was visible. It was a slight change but judging by the surprised look of the regulars it was something that had not happened before. Sherlock was certainly arrogant enough to take credit for the difference, well he would have been if his mind hadn’t been stuck on the stubborn jaw and perfectly sculpted lips that has been revealed to him.
