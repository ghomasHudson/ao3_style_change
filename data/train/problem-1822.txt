“Listen to Dr Watson,” Mycroft said. “You’ve said before that you trust him, now is the time to behave that way.”
“Definitely not, we look the same as we did before we came up here,” he said. “We’ll tell Mrs Hudson we went out for a cigarette -- I don’t imagine anyone else will notice we’ve been gone.”
"Show me some skills and I'll compliment them." John winked, then chuckled as his face flushed. He felt very silly.
Sherlock rubbed his head again. “I don’t remember . . .” he said quietly. “I can remember watching television . . . but I can’t remember anything after that.”
Sherlock’s hand drifted to John’s cock, holding it until he could feel it start to stiffen again. Then he started a slow stroke, moving his mouth to suck on John’s ear and neck.
Sherlock dumped it, dish and all, into the bin. He put the rest of the dishes in the sink. "I'll do these tomorrow," he said. He grabbed two plates and forks into the sitting room. "Let's eat in here, okay, rather than in the scene of my crime."
"Fine," Sherlock said. He moved over to the door, put his coat on and wiggled his shoulders. "This coat feels  . . . off now somehow." He crinkled his face but gave John a smile.
"Maybe I like teasing," he murmured, smiling against Sherlock's lips. He pushed the soft cotton out of the way and gripped Sherlock's cock properly, stroking slowly.
John took a sip since he had, of course, had excellent wine. He thought for a moment. "I have never caused an explosion."
“Fine,” she said grumpily, grabbing his mug from his hand. “Let me make a pot of tea and then we’ll start, all right?”
Sherlock’s mouth dropped to John’s neck, just as the bell rang and the doors opened. He stepped back to let John out, following him closely. John led them to his room, swiping the key and pushing the door. As soon as he closed it, he pulled Sherlock close again, kissing his mouth.
When they arrived at the clinic, John couldn't help being impressed with the place. They walked in and gave Sherlock's last name. Things moved pretty quickly after that. Harry filled out paperwork while they explained some of their processes, therapy and class schedules, and rules for staying. Then they were taken to her room while being given a quick tour.
"Sherlock, we're not in on anything. You're hurt and you need to rest and heal. I'm sorry you don't like it, but that's how it has to be."
"John? John! Now where are you going?" Mrs Hudson hurried after him, swatting his arm with the dish towel again.
“No . . . though I may in the future, so I’d like to keep that option on the table,” Sherlock said. “It’s something more personal . . . I don’t know if I should say.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Well, it wasn’t for an experiment actually. It was . . . for nothing. For fun, I guess. I was bored.”
John shrugged. He looked at her surprised face when she saw she could actually put the food on the table now. Then she sat down with him and waited. John sat down and pulled the food closer.
Sherlock set his phone down and got up to make himself some tea and sort his notes from his research. Things were going well with work and with his “other little scheme with the handyman” as Mrs Hudson had called it.
"Thank you," Sherlock said. When Harry emerged, he led the way downstairs and lifted his hand. When a cab pulled up, he opened the door to allow Harry and John to get in. He gave the driver the address and stared out the window. They rode along quietly, with Harry muttering a few things to John, but Sherlock didn't hear. When they arrived, he paid the driver and headed in. Sherlock mumbled the message to Angelo as he sat them down at their usual table.
Sherlock’s mum brought over two plates with a half sandwich on each. “What have you two got planned?” she asked.
"You're definitely not going to the hospital, Sherlock. Coat off -- you're not leaving," John said more firmly.
“Sorry about him,” Mrs Hudson said, handing the cheque to John. “He is rude and unpleasant, but I still quite like him.”
John tried to focus around him and listen to people talking. They were having a good time, but it wasn't the most enthusiastic crowd he'd ever seen. He got distracted more than he liked, looking around the bar for the handsome but annoying man he'd been talking to but didn't see him anywhere. Maybe he left.
“It’s not. Your skill got you that interview -- it wasn’t chance,” he said, his voice more serious than he’d expected it to sound.
“Well, I suppose that’s important,” Sherlock said. “I’ll try to keep that in mind . . . if you want to keep going.”
"Well, that's one way of looking at it," Sherlock said. "If I were interested in any of this, I'd remind you that I have information that I could share if I were disappointed about being misled." He looked over at her. "However, I am not that interested . . . as I said, I need to work."
There was a knock at the door. At first Sherlock thought he’d imagined it, but then he heard it again. He glanced up at John’s bedroom, but he hadn’t got up yet. Then he heard it again.
"You don't have to come with me when I work. And I won't be doing that for too much longer," he said.
The first time in a long time he thought about Sherlock again was when he realised he was falling for a boy. He’d had a few girlfriends and he still found them attractive, but he found this boy attractive too and he wanted to talk about that. He didn’t know how his team would react but when he got the nerve to mention it, no one seemed to care one way or the other. John started dating his first boyfriend.
"I got the papers, relax. I hope there's a case so you can finally calm down," he announced as he came in.
“He can’t remember the accident,” Mycroft said. “As you well know, he remembers everything unless he’s got a reason to forget it. I don’t know if he’s deleted what happened or if he honestly can’t recall, but either way, he needs to concentrate. You will see him when he returns home." He moved around John and got into the cab.
"I love Christmas," John said. "When I was five, Harry and I had been begging for a dog. On Christmas morning, there was a box with holes in it, like air holes. We were so excited we ignored every other gift for that box, but inside there were two stuffed animals. My dad was filming it all. Harry threw hers across the room and I cried." John smiled at the memory.
Sherlock rolled on a condom and slowly pushed in. He dropped down on to John. “Okay?” he mumbled against his mouth.
John scooted out from under the sink, wiping his hands on the rag beside him. "It's all set. Everything should be running smoothly now."
Sherlock watched for a few minutes. "Obviously, that woman is owed money -- her lease said no pets and apparently for that man, a lizard is a pet," he said. He watched as the judge insulted the woman and dismissed her case. "Why did she do that?" he asked John. "This is not justice."
“Nothing,” Sherlock said. “And can I just clarify -- the rest of the evening . . . perhaps you should remind me again of your plans so I’m sure.”
“Stop being stupid,” she said, stepping to the side and motioning toward the kitchen. “A man’s just fixed it, all right, so don’t bother contacting Brussels.”
“No, it wasn’t things like that,” Sherlock said, rolling on his side away from John. “I just sometimes dream about little things, little differences.”
“What do you mean –- go anywhere?” Sherlock asked, genuinely confused. Then he realised what John was talking about. “So sex is what you want then?”
"I'm not going to bore you with the whole 'you just have to find the right person' mantra, but I think if you find someone you really care about you make it work -- you don't give up on them. I think most people are easily frustrated and quick to give up."
John looked up at Sherlock and took the mug. "I . . . I guess I have a few minutes," he said slowly.
Sherlock poured two cups and carried them in. “To make these,” he said, sitting down on his sleeping bag and placing one cup near John. “Did you sleep all right?”
“Fine, I will,” Sherlock said. He stood up and moved over to where John was sitting. He held out his hand.
Sherlock lifted a hand to wipe his face, which was damp with sweat already. He looked up at the ceiling and then down at John, reaching down to touch his hair. John licked a stripe up Sherlock's cock, taking him into his mouth and bobbing up and down. He looked up at Sherlock as he moaned softly.
“Out?” Sherlock perked up. “We’ve got no sauce for the pasta . . . that feels necessary. Should I go?”
“Well, maybe we should just try to stay away from each other,” Sherlock said, fully aware that was impossible to last long. “What are you going to do for the rest of the day? Just bang things around and talk the entire time?”
"So fine -- what it is you are so desperate to do, Doctor Watson?" Sherlock asked. He reached over and grabbed his pajamas. "Be specific or I get dressed right now."
Sherlock leaned over and kissed John’s mouth. Then he pushed himself back up, rolled on the condom and lined up, before slowly and carefully pushing inside. “God,” he exhaled instinctively. Then he looked at John. “Okay?”
"Oh, did you have lunch?" John asked him, he had mentioned to him to make sure he had something to eat if they didn't get back in time.
Thank you all for the amazing and wonderful comments and kudos. Hope you have enjoyed this latest chapter more to come!!!
"Hey boy," he said as he knelt down and looked to the animal, his voice was calm and even, a friendly tone to it, "It's all right. I just want to go to your friend back there. They look a little hurt. Come on boy, it's all right," he said as he held his hand out a little, keeping it palm down and angled towards the pavement. The dog gave a small growl but moved towards John and sniffed his hand.
Harry had been feeling down since he had woken up that morning. He had been thinking about what would happen as soon as the killer was caught. Harry knew he would have to go somewhere else to live, no matter how much he felt welcomed and at Home with Sherlock and John. He was a wizard, and Sherlock and John were still in the dark about that little fact. Harry wanted to tell them. He had sent Hedwig to Hermione's for the summer just before Marge had arrived, so hadn't been able to get in touch with anyone.
"You didn't have too," John smiled and then frowned as he noticed that there were only two plates, "Didn't you make any for yourself?" he asked him as Harry stood by the table.
John nodded in understanding as he looked to Sherlock, who was looking at Lestrade shaking his head, "Sherlock?" he frowned.
John looked at him, pleading with his eyes. Sherlock just gave him a look and John caved, "Fine," he huffed as he left the room and changed into the suit, "I feel like a dressed up Monkey," he said as he walked out. Harry was dressed well too.
"Hi," John said softly, making the child startle a little and grab the dog around his neck and hold him tightly, "it's all right. My names John, I'm a doctor and I work with the police as well," he smiled to him.
Sherlock perked up for a moment as he looked around. He saw an alley not far from the scene and walked over to it. He could hear a noise coming from the alley as he ducked under the tape and headed to the opening. John quickly followed him as well as Greg.
Harry watched in horror as Aunt Marge began to inflate like a balloon. She bumped against the ceiling as a sudden pain when through his face. Harry stood there as he looked to his uncle. It wasn't the first time he had been hit, but it had been a couple of years since the last time. He moved away, backing into the kitchen as Uncle Vernon advanced on him and threw a punch, hitting Harry in the stomach and causing the almost thirteen year old to double over in pain and drop to the tiled floor.
"Yes, quite a detestable human being, and I have seen plenty in my time," Mycroft nodded, agreeing with his brother.
Sorry for not updating yesterday, I had a bad fall. I’m okay, just feeling really bruised and a sprained ankle.
John smiled to the two of them, "Looks like we will have to tell him a little about the cases and things that we have gone through," he said as he gave a pointed look to Sherlock.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed John roughly, biting his bottom lip. His thrusts matched his mouth’s urgency. “I’m almost there,” he panted, closing his eyes and letting his body fill with the tension.
“Right, forgot about that,” Sherlock said. He poured himself a cup of tea. “I’m going into my room now. I’ll see you tomorrow.” He disappeared into his room.
“It is something,” Sherlock said. “Would you make us a cup of tea, please? I’ll get us sorted to look as soon as he sends it through.”
“I’ve not missed the bossiness either,” she said. She grabbed some bowls and sat down next to John. “You still want to go to the cabin with someone so shouty and bossy?”
John arched his back slightly. "I'm not either," he said. He carded his fingers into Sherlock's hair and pulled lightly, eager to find out what he liked.
“I know you’re not a wimp,” Sherlock said. “But you sometimes let your emotions rule you. You should spend the film trying to use your logic to solve the crimes.”
“I am always interested in cases, John Watson, and you know that,” Sherlock said. “However, recently -- thanks to you -- I have become interested in other things as well.” He put a kiss on John’s cheek but also pinched his arm.
Sherlock’s phone rang. He picked it up but didn’t recognise the number. Perhaps it was the new client.
Sherlock closed his eyes. Before drifting off to sleep, he knew that he would never feel this safe  without John close to him.
"I came to Molly's wedding because she's my friend and invited me," John said. "But I like to think that I am nice. It’s not an act."
"Let's see," John said, taking the phone and dialing another random number. He grinned at Sherlock as it started to ring, trying to think of something quick. But no one answered, the phone went to voicemail. "Booo," John recorded before hanging up.
“I know he can,” Sherlock said. He moved toward the door. “All right -- I’m off to see Molly. John . . . don’t do anything stupid. And don’t be out late.”
"Oh,” John said, wondering if it was the grumpy neighbour. “Okay, I can stop by on the way to my next job." He thought about calling Mrs Hudson to verify what was going on, but he was close enough so he didn't bother. When he arrived, he knocked on the door and waited patiently.
“It was incredible,” Sherlock said, kissing John’s mouth roughly. “What can we do now to make you feel as good?”
“Exactly,” Sherlock said and rolled them both over so John was on top of him. “And from now on, we can get lucky every day if we’d like,” he added, wrapping his legs around John’s.
“Shut up,” Sherlock said. He opened his eyes and looked up at John. “That feels nice actually,” he added softly.
"What? Mrs Holmes! Hello," John said. He pushed Sherlock, but he was laughing. "Sherlock dressed up like a mouse. I'll send you a photo of the excellent make up I did." He raised his brows at Sherlock.
“Why should I tell you when you won’t tell me what’s wrong with you?” Sherlock said. When John sat back down, Sherlock looked over at him again. “You’re different and you know it,” he said.
"Of course," John said. "Just call if you need anything else . . .thanks for the tea." He left and began to hurry as he hit the stairs.
When Sherlock opened his eyes, the room was quiet. John was gone. He panicked for a moment, thinking John had gone off to work or maybe he was in danger again. He sat up and quickly went downstairs. Then he heard the toilet flush and relief came over him. He moved over to the kettle to turn it on.
In the morning John showered and packed up his essay, glancing through it once before he headed out. He was meeting with an advisor to make sure his last and final paper was on track. He was so close to graduating and starting his residency -- he didn't want anything to mess it up. After his meeting he grabbed some lunch and headed back to his flat to make the suggested changes and finish it up.
"Okay," John said. He sipped his tea and handed it back to Sherlock long enough to get his coat off. He took his mug back and moved to the sofa. "This is really nice."
“When they got back to Sherlock’s cave, John noticed that it too was cold and dark but Sherlock’s cave was bigger than John’s. Sherlock went inside and made them both a cup of tea. John told Sherlock about all the brave things he’d done that day, but Sherlock didn’t have any acts of bravery to share at all.”
“No, that was not mentioned,” Sherlock said. “I just decided I wanted to look pretty today. You can make your own decision about how you want to look.”
Sherlock looked over. “Is that why you made me go swimming all day, so you could ogle me?” he asked with a laugh. He left his hand move down to grab on to John’s.
John stripped everything off and climbed into bed. His body still felt warm, and he still tasted Sherlock. He drifted off replaying the end of the night.
“I know they think it’s the best thing,” Sherlock said. “Maybe it is.” He looked up at the sky. “It doesn’t feel like it though.” He turned to John. “Let’s watch a film tonight -- that’ll give us something else to talk about because you’ll probably like it and I’ll need to explain to you why it’s terrible.” He pulled a stupid face.
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock said. “He didn’t say we were fighting so I don’t think we are. It’s just . . . I think I’m angry at him.”
“The fall . . . why didn’t I leave?” he asked again, thinking, remembering. “I thought I saw you --”
It wasn’t long before the sound of the television began to drive Sherlock mad. He felt agitated. Then he felt angry. He’d needed to talk to John, he’d wanted to talk to John, but John wasn’t here to help. He picked up his phone twenty times, but for some reason, he set it back down twenty times as well. John knew about the case and still he’d gone out. He was making his priorities very clear, and that annoyed Sherlock.
His dad said, “Son, I know new things can be difficult. But life is full of new things and I don’t want you to miss out on them.”
Just the thought of doing this with John, seeing him in this moment, was enough to push Sherlock over the edge. He let himself go, letting his hand move in the rhythm of his own hips rocking on the sofa.
John looked over at him. "No one was like you, either. They didn't even like sleepovers," he said, smiling a bit.
“You think so?” he said with a laugh. “Well, you can get out of my flat right now if you just came up here to insult me.”
He took the coffee to the computer and checked him email before reading the newspaper. Skimming the page, he saw a photo of the bar he’d gone to last night. The article said there’d been a fight there at closing time and the police had been called. Sherlock was glad he’d left by then. He didn’t need Lestrade, or Mycroft, thinking he’d been involved in any trouble.
"Because it’s time," John said. "We had decided we’d do it now, so here I am." He shrugged and looked down at the small mound he'd made already.
The new case brought much more attention than John expected. People sent messages accusing him of hiding Sherlock, demanding to know where he was or if he was really still alive. John ignored those messages, along with the pang of hurt they brought with them. He knew the conspiracies out there -- those initial comments had included wild stories about how Sherlock actually survived and where he might be hiding. He knew how those people felt -- desperate, hopeful, wanting to believe it wasn't all for nothing. He’d never replied, never indulged them. It was too hard. But now John saw different messages. Praise for the new story, and then requests for more. People were writing to him for cases, asking him solve more cases for them. He couldn't believe this.
When the cab finally pulled up, John paid and went up to the flat. "Sherlock?" he called out, but there was no answer. He emptied his case, took a quick shower, and changed into something more comfortable for lounging around.
"No. I'm not trying to figure it out. I just want to be surprised," he said, glancing over at Sherlock. "I want to enjoy the ride."
When he finally opened the box, he froze, unable to take his eyes off of it. It was a briefcase--or rather a medical bag. It was soft leather, a deep brown colour, with his name stitched into the front flap. It was a gorgeous thing. He looked away only when he heard a noise from Mrs Hudson. She was crying softly, wiping her eyes with the rag she'd hit him with.
“You look . . . “ Sherlock started to say but then reached over and pulled John close. His hands moved up and down John’s back, feeling the muscles he always knew were there but had never touched before. John arched forward so their bodies touched as they kissed.
John smiled. "Yeah. Yeah, I knew it would be," he said. "Let's make a game out of it. Whoever spots the most weird things wins."
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock said, wrapping an arm around John’s body. “Nice . . . this whole evening’s been nice.”
"Don't be stupid," John said, his voice quiet and, to his surprise, a bit shy for real. He put the cigarette away and stood up to take the coat off now.
Sherlock paused to think -- he didn’t want to raise suspicions, but he obviously didn’t have any photos to send.
Sherlock followed her. When they got away from the other kids, she grabbed his hand again and leaned against him.
John looked different. Older, not a kid anymore. He looked stronger and very handsome. But his eyes, when Sherlock's met them, were the same.
“Sir, if you know where Timmy is, please tell him we’d like our stapler back. I will leave you to consider your options. You have our card. We’ll be here, eagerly waiting, in our business suits and ties,” Sherlock said before ending the call.
"It has been," Sherlock said, sitting down on the sofa where John was lying on the blankets. "But I forgive you. I tried at dinner . . . did I do all right?"
A teenager bumped him as he passed, swearing at him. Sherlock swore back and then started walking. He walked all the way back to the flat, unlocking the door and stepping inside. At the bottom of the stairs, he looked up toward the door. He dialed John's number and started to climb the steps.
Sherlock raised his arms in a stretch. “I need to make a phone call,” he said. “Want to order the food? I’ll take my usual.” He headed into his room and rang his brother.
“We’ll be nude,” Sherlock said. “We’ve never been by each other nude.” He looked over. “But I’ll do it.”
Sherlock heard John’s door, so he poured two cups of tea. He moved over to the window and lit a cigarette.
Sherlock said nothing, but eventually he did as he was told. Once that task was finished, he came back to the flat and flopped onto the sofa. He thought about what she’d said, about being on his own. She’d said it like it was a bad thing. It wasn’t, he preferred it. He’d be perfectly fine if he could just get some cases. He’d keep himself working and busy and satisfied. But he knew that cases involved other people and they were letting him down. See? he thought as he carried on this ridiculous argument in his head. It’s other people who were the problem, not him. If he could just get some cases he’d be fine. And if he ever had that other urge for people . . . well, he’d figure that out when it happened again.
Sherlock sat quietly for a minute. “If we hadn’t bumped into each other, what would you have done once you’d finished your drink?” he asked.
“Because,” Sherlock started before he knew exactly what was going to follow. “I have no idea actually.”
"I'm a friend of Molly's, we went to school together," he said. "Do you know her, or is it just . . ." He trailed off and motioned towards the man beside her. "Sorry, I didn't get your name," he said.
"It's too sexy," Sherlock said, pulling John's head towards his for another deep kiss. He nodded toward the drawer. "Can you reach in there?" he asked.
He groaned and got out of bed, grabbing his dressing gown before padding down. "Sherlock? What's happening? Why are you yelling?"
“And what do you do when this happens? Should I expect to . . . help in some way?” Sherlock asked, wondering if he could even if he wanted to.
They walked his parents out and then headed back in. Sherlock sat down on the sofa. “Our trip begins now, I suppose,” he said. “Are you hungry? What food did you bring?”
“John,” Sherlock said quietly. “That feels good.” He shifted his body on the sofa, leaning in against John, almost pushing him backward.
Sherlock looked at his brother. “I may be injured and useless to you now,” he said. “But I’m not an idiot. Is it safe?”
"I don't think he tolerates you," she said, turning to the front again. "I mean, I think he does more than tolerate you."
Sherlock crinkled his face. “You’ve been trying to do this forever and now you have . . . I expected you to be a totally changed man,” he said. “Is that what you were expecting?”
“If you insist, I will get more comfortable,” Sherlock said with a smile. He turned on the sofa, dropping his legs onto John’s lap. “What are we going to try?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, pulling him tight. He could feel that their skin was damp with sweat, their chests heaving together as they tried to catch their breath. After a few minutes, Sherlock whispered, “What trouble have you started, John Watson?”
John glanced at the time on his phone. 20:47. He sighed and stuffed it into his pocket again as the cab brought him closer to home. He had told Sherlock not to wait up when he left for his date, but he'd hardly been out a couple hours.
"Thanks," Sherlock said, taking a long drink. He used the cloth to wipe up his belly and then snuggled under the covers again. "Come get close to me," he told John.
“I don’t eat much,” Sherlock said quickly. He realised that perhaps he’d said something that should have stayed a thought. “I meant, if we keep seeing each other,” he added, stumbling a little. “If you want to obviously.”
John shifted his own legs to lie back against the sofa’s arm. "Next he recruited an intelligent wizard to help him with the more mysterious things on the mission."
“You’re --” Sherlock started but then his body jerked and his breath caught and then he was coming in John’s hand. He tried to keep their rhythm but his body’s movement was now out of his control. John moaned loudly, his head falling back. Sherlock's body squeezed around him and he came as well, lifting up into him.
Sherlock stepped up to the desk. He pulled his spare police ID from his pocket and flashed it. “We need the records from the Norbury Gallery. Last two weeks, please.”
Sherlock spent most of the night working. He wasn’t finding much useful in terms of who took the painting. He finally fell asleep, wondering if this was a waste of his time after all.
“All right,” Sherlock said. He watched him go. He got up to check his email. Still no new queries, which today felt all right. He just wanted to spend the day with John without any distractions from work.
“No,” Sherlock said. “His name is Gary. But his nickname is Sherlock, so that’s what we’ll call him. Now stop interrupting so I can continue.
He sat back down on the bench, and suddenly realised his whole body was in pain. Something had happened to him -- this was not the pain of sleeping on a bench. He closed his eyes, but all he could remember was his brother and the word danger. Had there been danger or had Mycroft got him out in time?
Sherlock lay down on his bed and closed his eyes. He tried to force himself to sleep, but John’s noise kept intruding. He huffed a few times, trying to get comfortable, all to no avail. He checked his laptop, sending Lestrade yet another email asking for something to do. Then he stood up, grabbed his cigarettes from the nightstand, and headed out. He marched into the kitchen, sat down at the table, and lit a cigarette. He took a long drag and blew the smoke in John’s direction.
He set out some dark clothes and found a shovel, stashing it between the bushes beside the house. They had dinner together that night, talking about the summer and his training coming up. He was still reassuring his mum about his joining the Army. When they finished eating, he did the dishes before he went up to his room. He watched a movie on his computer while he waited for them to go to bed.
Sherlock turned around, holding his newly poured cup of tea. "Did you get milk? I've had to use the last of it," he said, taking a sip. He looked over. "Why are you wearing my things?" he said sharply.
When Sherlock’s father had come down, his parents bickered over what time it’d be best to eat. Sherlock offered to bring in wood. Eventually, the house had calmed down. His parents had gone upstairs to “finish getting things ready,” which Sherlock knew was code for taking a nap. He was in his father’s comfy chair in front of the fire with a nice cup of tea beside him. He’d intended to read the book sitting on his lap, but had actually got a little lost in the soft crackle of the flames and the twinkling lights on the Christmas tree. So much so that the vibration of his phone left him startled for a moment as if he’d be abruptly woken from a dream.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and set the phone down next to him at the desk. He looked at John. “I don’t like this,” he said.
“I hate to break it to you, Sherlock Holmes,” she said. “But today is not about you. It’s about Molly. So behave.”
Sherlock stared at the screen. This was a ridiculous task, but maybe it would help them feel normal for a little while. When the details arrived, he opened the photo of the missing man. He tried to read his face – was this man in trouble or had he just run away from his life? Where was he now? Out in the world with the virus?
“Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said loudly. “I cannot function without water any longer. Stop taking advantage of my kind nature. I cannot work, I cannot wash and but quite frankly, I think I’m suffering from dehydration. I’m sure you are denying me one of my human rights or something.”
He even considered speaking to Mrs Hudson or Molly, but he was relatively sure he could guess what each would say. He also knew that both would be disappointed if he called John to say he’d changed his mind. Sherlock didn’t like admitting it, but both women’s opinions did matter to him. He knew that all he could do was to see how this played out.
John finished his drink. "No, that's not why. I'm just saying. I'm not allowed to compliment my friends?"
Sherlock opened the door to his bedroom, took a deep breath, and stepped inside. He looked into the dark space, remembering every inch of it. He decided not to turn on the light -- just in case he did and everything looked different. He moved over and opened a drawer, reaching in and feeling around for a pair of pajamas. Thank god, they were there. That must mean John had left things as they were in there. He stripped off his clothes, slipped into his pajamas, and then climbed into his bed. He recognised the comfort. He pulled the blanket up, turned onto his side and sunk into the feeling. At least this was one place that felt just as he’d remembered -- one thing that hadn’t changed at all.
Sherlock dried his hands and then leaned up to get some plates, handing them to John before grabbing the silverware. “Sorry she’s so horrible,” he said to John as they moved to the table.
“You’ll probably love it,” Sherlock said. “You’ll be in charge of the flat and won’t have to shout at me all the time. . .”
“Lestrade is still ignoring me – maybe I should give him a call,” Sherlock said, getting out his phone.
Sherlock moaned loudly and used his free hand to pull John down toward him. He kissed his mouth roughly, still moaning through the kiss. The bed shook with their bodies’ movement. It wasn’t long until Sherlock’s hand gripped the back of John’s neck as he felt all his muscles start to tighten. “I’m close,” he stuttered out.
"I'll have the same, but without the Coke," Sherlock said to the bartender. "And a glass of white wine."
Sherlock listened to John move over to get his coat. “Can I stay here while you’re gone?” he asked feebly, standing up.
“You might want to withhold that judgment for a week or two,” Sherlock said. “So what do we do now? Or am I not supposed to ask?”
“That’s all I ask, John,” Sherlock said, giving him a smile. He took his plate into the sitting room and turned on the television, flipping through the channels. Every channel seemed to be talking about the virus. He turned it off. “Has everything stopped being normal?” he asked.
John leaned closer trying to pretend the confusion was because of the noise. "I was just telling Sean to leave me alone because I'm taken," he repeated. "He didn't believe me."
"I'm not visiting . . ." John trailed off and fought a smile. "Yes. It's important to make time for what you like."
Sherlock got the food ready. He’d brought some jam he remember John liking, hoping it was still his favourite. He boiled the kettle again and then went outside the back to find a little table to use with the chairs.
“I liked it . . . that’s why I wanted to kiss you,” Sherlock said. “And touch you more . . . I liked it all. Did you?”
“And what would you say about having a little drink even though it’s early and we’ve had no dinner yet?”
Sherlock stopped to search his phone for the company and then grabbed John’s arm and led him out into the traffic, crossing over and through a maze of streets. Before they opened the door, he said to John, “Shall I handle this one?”
"The sex? No," John said. "You're handsome and interesting, smart...I want to get to know more about you."
Sherlock spent the rest of the afternoon sending out emails, trying to drum up some business. He refused to contact his brother, though. He was going to do this on his own. By the time it was getting dark, nothing had materialised. He got a glass of wine and opened the window to have a cigarette.
“I’m a detective, not a stand in at your police events,” Sherlock had said to Lestrade the day before.
Sherlock pushed a finger slowly inside John, beginning with a light pulse. As John's body adjusted, he began to pump before sliding another finger in. As good as it all felt, Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if John had done this before. A part of him -- the jealous part -- did not even want to consider it. However, John was quite confident -maybe none of this was new. He decided to just trust John's reactions.
The next morning John went to work and asked for a half day. At lunch he would go back to his flat, finish up his packing ,and then head over to Sherlock's. He was still a bit weary about this idea. Somehow it would be easier if Sherlock was a complete stranger, but he wasn’t. Not really. He didn't know what to think or feel about it all.
"Not before I get you in my mouth," John said, making his way lower. He kissed his way down, enjoying Sherlock's body in a way he never thought he would. When he reached Sherlock's cock, he licked a long stripe along the shaft and took him into his mouth.
“Well, you’re probably tired, so . . .” Sherlock shifted on his bed awkwardly. “We can talk about the case tomorrow.” He felt like his brain was too full of John to even remember anything about all that right now.
“Wrong,” Sherlock said. “You were here to witness my brilliance -- that’s the most important part.” He stuck his tongue out.
“Oh, right, I suppose you’re right,” Sherlock said. He pushed himself up and shifted the bag. “I hadn’t thought of that,” he added as he slid in. “Night.”
However, Mycroft’s distinction was more important than Sherlock had realised. From the airport, they went straight to Mycroft’s flat where Sherlock was confined again until Mycroft “got things in order.” At this point, Sherlock wasn’t interested in details. He wanted to go home. Yet he knew from his brother’s voice that the details were important, so he knew the rules had to be obeyed.
The waiter came over and set down their food. Sherlock nodded to him and John smiled and started eating his meal with a happy hum.
“I see,” Sherlock said again. He took a sip of tea and pretended to think again. “Yes, I think that’s a wise suggestion.” He gave John a small smile.
“I missed you,” Sherlock said sweetly, staring lovingly into his eyes. He held his gaze for a moment, and then said, “All right, soldier. On your feet.”
They left the shop together and walked to her flat, talking about how busy the day had been for both of them -- John made up things to fill his day. When they arrived at the building, she led the way inside. She walked in first and John followed, shutting the door behind him. "This is a nice place," he said. He want to turn and take it all in, but suddenly his head exploded -- pain burst from the back of his head and before he could see what happened, he fell and everything went dark.
Sherlock held tightly onto him. When their bodies stopped moving, he relaxed a little, turning his head to the side. “I like when you call my name,” he said softly.
John laughed. "Well, that’s an interesting approach." He looked over at Sherlock and smiled. "I need to shower," he announced, getting up to take his mug to the sink. "Is it down this hall?" he asked, pointing off the kitchen.
Sherlock hung up and moved over to his desk. He looked over at John. “He wants us to review CCTV,” he said.
John bucked up, his hardening cock pressing against Sherlock. "I know the feeling," he murmured, seeking his mouth again. He couldn't get enough.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Sorry, I lied a little -- I remember everything actually and I liked it all.”
“I just know these things,” she said. “I could tell -- you’re not the only one who can read people.” She took a sip of tea and then pulled a business card from her pocket and set it on the table. “Well? You said he was handsome -- what are you going to do about it?”
“Where have you been?” Sherlock asked on John walked in. John’s not being home had annoyed him and he couldn’t really hide it, even though he remembered the lectures John had given him in the past about his tone of voice.  Surely as soon as he explained his success, John would be too amazed to be angry about Sherlock’s voice.
"Of course, you're handsome," Sherlock said. "You spend enough time admiring yourself in the mirror to know that." He put his feet up on the table. "I will say this, I don't know what you're trying to prove with this ridiculous behaviour, but the coat actually increases your attractiveness tenfold. Which leads me to believe that when I'm wearing it, I must be impossibly gorgeous." A wide smile spread across his face, despite his attempt to hide it.
“Your face when you checked your work on your pipes,” Sherlock said. “Like you were curing them,” he added with a sly smile.
When the show was over John went to get one more drink before heading out for the night. He sent his report to his friend and thanked him for the night out. He hailed a cab and headed home again.
He pulled back a little. “Perhaps you’ve already had enough to drink,” he said, looking over at John for help.
Sherlock put some onto his plate. He looked over at his mum who began talking about something -- nonsense really, but he knew she was doing it to help him. It was so frustrating -- she always knew when he was struggling, yet she was the one who was making him leave everything he felt comfortable with. He ate a few things on his plate.
“I did at school,” Sherlock said. “I mostly slept the couple nights I’ve been back, but just in case.”
“Tigers,” Sherlock mumbled. He turned on his other side, pulling his knees up, pressing his feet against John’s side.
“You’re good -- what’s happening is that I want to make you feel so good,” Sherlock mumbled as he rested his head on John’s thigh, watching his hand stroke John and then looking up into his eyes. “You taste so good. . .”
“No, John,” Sherlock said. “Now is the time. I want to feel home . . . make me feel at home.” He dropped his empty mug on the floor. Then he bent down and untied his shoes, took off his socks, rolled them into two balls, and threw them at John. “Snap at me,” he said. “Like before.”
John felt his cheeks warm. He sipped his tea and looked over at Sherlock. "You're being quite sweet."
"Yes," Sherlock moaned softly, closing his eyes and taking in the warm pleasure of everything that was happening. Then he opened his eyes again and looked straight at John as his stroke sped up slightly and his hips moved with John's hand. "Good?" he asked.
He sat up and slid his hand behind his bed, retrieving a pack of cigarettes. His mum didn’t like the smoking; at Christmas she’d made him go outside, but he didn’t want to leave his room. He slid open his window and lit one, exhaling it into the cooler night air.
“What? Flirt with men and then pull someone else in to your little game?” Sherlock asked. “Do you two have some kind of scam going? Because I should tell you that I occasionally work with the police.”
John gasped softly as he watched Sherlock lost in pleasure. He moved his hand to cover Sherlock's on his own cock, helping to get himself there as well. He groaned Sherlock's name as he came between them as well.
"I did -- a proper sleep," Sherlock said. He stretched a little to prove it, but then realised the stretch felt quite good on his body. "I've only been watching you for a few minutes."
“The flat’s not distracting,” Sherlock said angrily. Then he decided to try a different strategy. “You can watch over me,” he said. “I’ll be good, and if I’m not, I’ve seen you, you can be horrible, you’ll keep me in line.”
"All right, that's what we'll do then," Sherlock said. He was now sitting back comfortably on the sofa. He glanced at the clock. "Should we get you something to eat?" he asked.
A few minutes into the drive, Sherlock’s mum started to narrate what they were passing -- she’d always done this, even John had witnessed it before. Sherlock watched out the window, recognising some of the things going by. Once they turned off the main road, though, he knew they must be close to the cabin since nothing was familiar.
“You are strangely easy to talk to,” Sherlock said. “Do you use your medical expertise to do so or just your charm to get to the truth?”
“Well, look around – I’ve got quite a few interesting artifacts, excellent books, good whiskey,” he said, holding up his glass. “You’re . . . okay as well.”
John smiled at both of them. He put down all three drinks, having brought another glass of wine for Mrs. Hudson as well. "I hope they let us eat soon," he said as he sat down on her other side again.
"I know it’s frustrating that he stays at school during breaks,” she said. “But these things happen . . .”
“I doubt anyone could,” Sherlock said. “I know I couldn’t -- I need someone like you around. I thought it was all me, but it wasn’t as good on my own. I needed you.”
Ellen leaned in and kissed his mouth. He didn’t respond. It wasn’t a bad kiss, but he wasn’t sure it was a good idea. She turned and kissed him again. “You’re really sexy,” she said and moved her body closer to his.
"He needs to be in a foster home, where he will be able to have the chance to find a true family," Marian said, shaking her head.
"It's always nice," Molly said as she sneaked into the room with their lunch. She giggled as the two men jumped at her surprise entrance.
Harry looked a little startled but nodded his head, "I know if I go back I will be killed. He has been threatening it for years, but this time. I know he will carry it out," he said softly with a little shudder.
I am back after so long. I am so sorry it has taken this long. But I am finding it very difficult in going back to the old fics I had already started posting before my mothers passing. So I've been taking it as one fic at a time and this one is next on my list.
"I will be going with you, I hope you don't mind. I believe that your suit might be a better choice, show them that you are above them," Mycroft said to Harry.
Harry backed from the door and closed it softly as he could and then looked around his room frantically. He needed to hide, he needed to be invisible. He wished he had his cloak, but he had no idea how to unshrink his trunk that was in his pocket. His wand was safely tucked away with his clothes in the little bedside table. He went over and changed into them. He made his bed up to make it look like he was sleeping. He would have no choice but to make a run for it, and he needed to delay the man as much as he could to have a head start.
John nodded his head, he had seen the almost father pride in Sherlock's eyes when teaching Harry something new. John wouldn't mind making the arrangement permanent, but who knew what was around the corner for them. At the moment, John knew that it would be best to keep things the way they were, at least until they caught the killer. Harry was too scared about that to really think about finding a family, and Sherlock and John wanted nothing more that to keep the teenager safe. John sat back and watched the two of them. A happy and content feeling bubbling away inside of John as he, Molly and Mike began to talk again. About recent cases and their current case with Harry, sometimes laughter and small chatter would reached them from the pair working at the bench.
The canine walked away from them and went over the child that was near the back part of the alley. John followed as the child began to wake up. He watched as a messy head of black hair lifted up and he saw slightly broken glasses hiding green eyes. John put on a friendly smile, angry at the bruises that he could see.
"All right," she nodded her head as she watched him stand up and stretched, laughing quietly at the wince as he then walked out of the room.
"Damn," John said with a sigh as he looked to the door for Harry's room, "What about family and that?"
"They pride themselves on being normal, I just let people know they aren't," he said, "petty I know, but my own revenge," he added as he looked at the window.
"Thank goodness they are gone," Lestrade grinned turning to them all, "They were beginning to get on my nerves with harassing me about seeing Harry. Anyway, I heard he saw him again?"
"Yes, of course it will," he nodded with a dismissive wave of his hand as he reached for his phone and made a quick call to John."Also, John said he will meet us in the park in about an hour, he is almost done with his shift," he told him.
Thank you all for the wonderful comments and kudos! You are all soooo amazing. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
"Social Services are making waves and Lestrade has no choice but to bring them here," he answered him, "Though I do have other news. I have learned a few things about the Dursley family thanks to the surveillance that I have on them.," he said with a smile looking towards Harry.
Any mistakes are my own, I've tried my best to catch them all, but with trying to cough up a lung every few minutes I may miss more than normal.
Harry grinned, "Good, about time people found out that the things that were being damaged around there weren't me."
John looked to him and smiled, "We don't need to , but we should. You don't have anything, and you can't keep wearing the same clothes all the time."
"I don't know what I'm suppose to do boy," he said softly, "I really don't. I just blew up my aunt and she floated out of the window. But if I go into the Magical world, they'll take me back and I don't want to. I know that Uncle Vernon will kill me if I do," he said giving a painful shudder at what he knew Uncle Vernon would do as soon as he saw Harry again, "I really need to get away from here, Uncle Vernon will try and find me, I know he will," he said a little scared.
"That's good. I know Sherlock don't really want anything to eat, we did have breakfast a little later than normal. Not only that, but we are somewhat on a case so he won't eat much on principle. Took me half hour to get him to eat this morning. But I don't really want Harry picking up his bad habits," he joked.
"The victim might have let himself be stabbed and killed to protect who ever it was that saw what was going on," John said as he looked to the scene, he couldn't imagine just standing there and letting himself be killed, he would have had to fight.
Sherlock smiled, getting up and the two of them headed into the living room, "Harry," Sherlock called to him.
"Bring some of the footage here as well," Sherlock said as he wanted to help, "I don't like the thought of him not being here," he then said softly to John.
It was almost dinner time before the two of them had come back. Harry hadn't text them at all and he had tried to hand the phone back to them as soon as they settled in the living room.
"I don't know where though. It there anywhere that could be safe for him?" John questioned quietly, turning away from the sink as he dried his hands after washing up.
"Can't they deal with it without us going at all, Harry is here alone, Mrs Hudson isn't here with us at all, since she went to go and do a little shopping for us with Mrs Turner," John told him with a shake of his head.
Sherlock seeing that he was now with the present went to the sofa and gathered John in his arms. John held him back just as tightly. The two of them held each other tightly as Sherlock whispered to him, saying everything was alright. It took a little while, but John calmed down and was finally feeling a little more normal. It was then that the two of them saw Harry.
Sorry for being away for so long. Near the beginning of last year, I had a health scare and didn't get the all clear until the beginning of November. Taken the last two months to get back into the swing of things. So hope you enjoy this chapter.
Harry wasn't that happy about John not being there, even though he was fine with just being with Sherlock. He missed having John there as well. The teen watched Sherlock for a moment before heading over to the table to sit down and watch what Sherlock was experimenting with.
They arrived at Privet Drive and got out. Harry was the last and he looked around. It was the same as he had left it, though the grass needed cutting, seems like he was the only one that did it then. Harry let Sherlock led the way as he rang the bell. It didn't take long for someone to answer.
"I can't get him to stop, and he doesn't say anything, just asks if there is anything else, and if I don't tell him he will just go and find something himself, that's how he ended up doing the windows and the laundry," she gave a sigh, she had never known a teen that able to do housework. Sherlock was hopeless at it, and even John didn't clean up like Harry did, and they were both adults.
Well, wedding over and now NaNoWriMo is about to start, be warned, I might not update each week during October and November. I am going to try and do so.
"Gary, his name was Gary," Harry said softly, looking down to the floor, "He protected me, he kept me safe when the man was there, he kept his attention on him," he said miserably as tears began to form.
"Harry," Sherlock said, his voice soft as he sat down on the sofa, "My brother has found your aunt and uncle," he began as Harry paled at the words, "We are not sending you back there," he assured before Harry could even think any more of it, "I have asked my brother to bring us some guardianship papers, they will only be temporary for now, but we will need the Dursley family to sign them. It will mean going there and seeing them. I know you would rather not, but John and I shall be there and I have no doubt that Mycroft will stick his fat nose into it again," he explained, hoping it was enough to reassure the lad he was not going back..
"It will, I'll make sure of that," John said with a smile as he went into the bedroom for a few moments and came back out, "Now, shall we get ready to go?" he asked.
Mike sat back down and pulled out some of his work and started it, making sure that it looked like he had been there for a while. The door to the next room opened and closed and then his opened. A tall man walked in and smiled to Mike.
"She's going out of the patio doors, stop her!" she exclaimed as she tried to pull Aunt Marge into the dinning room once more.
"Look, Diane, Marian," Lestrade said gaining the attention of the two, "At the moment, Harry needs to be here. We have a serial killer on the loose. At the moment it's quiet, but he is after Harry. Since he witnessed a murder. I know that John and Sherlock are able to protect him and help him with what he saw. So I'm with them, he needs to be here."
"Yesterday, the killer we are after targeted him, so I brought him here. I know, I should have contacted social services, but it scared the hell out of him that I gave in and just let him sleep there. I was going to go home and let him have the sofa there, but I ended up falling asleep too," Lestrade said with a shake of his head.
Snuffles ears picked up as he heard something disturb the background noise of Sherlock and Harry quietly talking. He opened his eyes as he heard it again. A small slight whimper came once again as he stood up and looked towards John. Sherlock stopped talking as he heard the restless movements and heavy breathing begin for John. He knew what was going to happen and he didn't want to let his boyfriend wake up like that again.
Hey all, I am sooooo sorry for the long wait for an update. I was only going to take a week off. But things happen and my mind just noped out of everything. I'm only back for a week, as April is Camp NaNoWriMo and I plan to take part and try and use the month to write for the fics that I need to update.
"I know, that is what I told Lestrade but he is insistent that we come and see, he said that the body is fresh, so it hasn't been there that long," he told John as he looked up to see Harry in the doorway of the kitchen.
Sherlock nodded his head and they sat quietly talking about a few things regarding Harry, both of them were at the same point and neither of them knew when they would be able to make things more stable for Harry. The door opened and Mycroft walked in, sending a puzzled look to them when he couldn't see Harry.
"Fine," she grumbled as she opened the door and let them in, "I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes," she glanced at Sherlock and led them into the living room where her husband and son were sitting watching TV, "Vernon, they brought him back," she sneered as she looked at where Harry was standing.
Harry nodded his head and grabbed his light jacket, he loved the fact that he had clothes that now fit him. Harry would have to get new robes for when he went back to school. He had grown a bit, and would no longer fit. It was another thing that he needed to do. Sherlock grabbed his suit jacket and put it on, it was too hot for the Belstaff.
The two of them talked a little as Sherlock the coaxed Harry back down and to order for dinner. It took a while, but in the end Sherlock ordered him something. Harry was quiet during the rest of the night, much to the worry of the two adults that were now responsible for him.
Petunia nodded her head as she and her husband quickly signed them, "now go and never come back. You are not welcome in this home. A freak, just like your whore of a mother," petunia said with a growl.
"There is another family, but I don't know if they will be able to get in contact with me, they can be a little old fashioned at times, I don't think they have a phone and I know that they live in Cornwall somewhere, but not where," he said, not sure what he could tell them about the Weasley family without it seeming like they were odd, well there were by Muggle standards Harry knew that.
Sorry for taking so long in getting this up. It's been a bad few weeks. We had to say goodbye to my dog Benji, who was part of the inspiration for the Guardians in the Harsh Reality Series. Not only that but I also lost a friend suddenly.
"Sherlock you need to eat though," John sighed as he went and sat down, "I'll make you something after this."
"I'm sorry, so sorry, you could have ran if not for me. You should have," Harry said as he fell to his knees beside him.
"Yes, my husband was a murderer that Sherlock brought to justice," she told him, "We're not the softest of people around Harry, we can take care of ourselves and we can take care of you as well."
John chuckled and shook his head, "Damn, you really know how to make sense don't you," he said softly.
"Yes, you do lighten things up John, you should know that, I don't really say that often enough" he admitted as he went back to watching Harry so he could avoid seeing the huge knowing grin on John's face.
"Boys," came a friendly call as an elderly woman walked in, "Oh you must be Harry, the boys told me about you," she said softly as she walked over to him and then noticed that the two men were arguing with each other.
Harry finished his lunch and looked down at the empty plate. He had been there now for over a day and Social Services had left just before he got his lunch. They were still trying to find out where he had come from. Harry didn't say anything, he was still to scared to even think about going back to his Aunt and Uncles home. He had no doubt that he would be punished badly for what had happened, even though he couldn't control it.
"Mycroft, we have had a bit of a problem here," Sherlock warned as he began to tell his brother what had happened.
"I don't know, I can see that this whole case bothers him but with Mrs Hudson being attacked? He feels guilty enough about even being in this situation. He seems to have taken everything that has happened so far well, but with his nightmares and now this? Kids got more issues that you and I put together." he answered him, a worried look on his face.
"This was never a home, more like a prison with a fat lump for a son and a fat abusive bastard for a husband. I can't even see how my mother was ever related to you, you're a bitch," Harry said, "I have to wonder what my grandparents would say if they could see you, I bet they would be rolling around in their grave," he told her as he turned and walked out of the house.
Harry went a little pale and shook his head, "No, it's really not a good idea and it might put people in danger and I don't want to do that," he said quickly.
John looked at Harry again and frowned when he saw that he had begun to shake. He got up and went over. He put his hands on Harry's shoulders, making the teen jump and push him away, "Harry," he said softly, calling to him and getting his attention.
Thank you for all the wonderful comments and kudos, you guys are awesome. I do hope that you have enjoyed this chapter.
Harry had done all the laundry and had even ironed their clothing as well as put it all away. He had been at it since the moment he had woken up. He had to do something to make it up to them for all the danger that he had brought into their lives. Mrs Hudson could have really been hurt, and it would have been all Harry's fault.
They could both see that Harry was upset about what he had found and he knew that he saw guilt in the teens eyes as well. Harry went over to Mrs Hudson and sat down on the floor beside her. He looked at the woman and smiled a little.
Sherlock thought for a moment, "we need to get him to see that we are in danger a lot of the time as well, even without him here."
John nodded, "Yeah, Mycroft was able to provide some footage, but we couldn't get a proper look at him. But Harry is insistent that it was him.
Thank you for the awesome kudos and comments, you guys are the best. I’m really happy that you have enjoyed the story so far. I hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
The dog whined once more and gave a rough woof as he moved and grabbed Harry's wrist in his mouth and raised the wand up. Not even a full second later there was a loud bang in front of him as a three decker bus came to a stop. Harry looked wide eyed at the purple bus and then to the dog. The dog was wagging his tail as he stepped towards the entrance.
John nodded to himself as he saw Sherlock and Mycroft exchange a silent conversation. He rolled his eyes . Mycroft could tell that there was more to the teenager and Sherlock had just confirmed that something more was going on than him just witnessing a murder. He nodded his head once more as he gave a silent word to Sherlock that he will do his best to help keep him from a family that had harmed him.
Lestrade nodded, "Right, if you can send that to me as well. I'll have a look as well. I know, I might not find anything, but it doesn't hurt to have it on file either. I'll see you all soon, and take care of him," he finished, gesturing to the stairs.
"That's my friend Hermione talking, she knows a few things," he smiled thinking of his friend and wondering if everything was all right with her.
John gave a little blush, "Things are well. Wasn't in the beginning, but they are now," he said, trying to ignore the look that was on his friends face.
"Welcome, I just text Molly, she'll be here in a bit. She's going to be bringing lunch for us all," Mike grinned, giving a nod of acknowledgment.
"Thanks," Harry said as he winced. He made sure to flatten his hair over his scar, not wishing for anyone to know who he was.
"I'll get help," Harry whispered, as he went to try and find someone, but he was called back by a weak call.
"Hello," came a friendly voice as it called out. Footsteps neared where Harry was hiding and a friendly face came into view, "What are you doing here?" he said with a shake of his head, moving the stools out of the way and getting a look at the teen, "I think you need to go back to your room, you don't look well. I'll call someone to come and get you, just tell me your name."
"No Lestrade, we can't we are not suited to doing so," Sherlock said, ignoring the question from John.
"It will be fine Harry, you are safe here at the moment, Mrs Hudson is going to be here as well and don't forget that you have Snuffles as well," John reassured him as he went over to him, "We also got you this," he said as he held out a mobile phone to Harry.
Mike smiled as he said, "I know, but you're a child and us adults are supposed to make sure that you're safe. I did what I could, now why don't you go back to Sherlock and finish your experiments, it's not a good thing to leave halfway through," he smiled to him.
"Sherlock, please, I think you and John might be the only ones that would be able to keep him safe, this guy is after him and we got nothing off the CCTV from the hospital," Lestrade said, almost pleading.
"I'm going to call Mycroft, have him come here to be with you," Sherlock then said as he pulled out his phone and called his brother.
"We can only do something when we learn and are told that something is wrong with a family or child," Diane told him gently.
"Look," John said softly, "you are under our care at the moment, that means that we'll be getting you some clothes all right, so no more arguing," he told him, a smile on his face as he tried to reassure him that it was fine.
John nodded and went over to the young teen and looking him over, wanting to make sure that he had done nothing to aggravate any of his injuries, "Okay, you're okay," he smiled to the teen, "Though you really need to take it easy, you need to rest for a few more days before you go running around. Though good thinking on hiding from the guy," he said a smile on his face as he looked to Harry.
Thank you for standing by me when I went through a tough time. It means a lot to me to know how patient and understanding you all are, snuggles to you all!
"About two years ago I had to fake my death, leaving Mrs Hudson and John to think that I was dead. I returned just over nine months ago, they forgave me after a while, but I did it for them. Because of a criminal that I was trying to bring down, he targeted them, would have them killed along with Lestrade if I didn't. It was hard and I did it to save them. And I'm still here and they are still beside me even though I could have caused their deaths," Sherlock told him as he reached out a hand for John, it still hurt John to think about it, even though he had forgiven him, it still hurt.
Lestrade sighed as he put his pen down and yawned. It was ten in the morning now and he had been awake since six that morning. He had fallen asleep at his desk again last night. He didn't do it often, but often enough that it will kill his back for most of the day. He looked over to the sofa and smiled a little when he saw the teen still fast asleep. The kid had been asleep throughout the night as far as he could tell.
"What ever that freak has done is no business of ours and if you can keep him away from us all the better," she spat out.
"Just know you," he told him a smile on his face as he stayed there as John made them lunch, moving when he did.
"Fine," Sherlock said as he turned to the teen, "Get up and come with us, we need to get back to Baker Street."
