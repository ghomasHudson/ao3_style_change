“I failed kind of spectacularly,” she told him.
Cas made short work of both of their belts, both of their buttons, both of their zippers, deepening the kiss all the while, and burying Dean in his want. Cas pulled himself free of his own slacks and then found Dean’s cock too, wrapping one hand around them both, aligning their heads to share the silky first drops and spread it as far down as one hand could hold. Dean whimpered, engaging in the kiss, finding space between their bodies to set his own hand to work and driving his hips up into Castiel’s lead.
“Sir, please. Nothing happened. He didn’t
Michael watched her dig through one of the cabinets she’d seen Cas take them from earlier in his effort to collect fluid for Gabriel.
I doubt there will be much disappointment, but I'm not even a little interested in writing the DF scene between Cas and Bobby.  It's a done deal, and next time you see them both, it will have been completed off-stage.
“All right,” he sighed.  “Restroom.  Do you want me to find you a woman escort?”
“You’re right,” Michael told him, leaning forward and leaving a kiss on the tip of Dean’s nose which earned him a withering look and a slap to his ass.  “I’ll take a walk through the back.  Where’s Portia?”
Dean swayed him slowly from behind. He kissed the side of Castiel’s neck, his eyes glued to their mates onscreen. “Look at them, C.J.,” he repeated at a whisper.
“You’re sure?”
“Pete?” Michael prompted with an annoyed sigh.  “It’s your call.  You and Ace can hang out here, go chill in one of the suites and wait for me.  Hell, go on home if you want.  I’ll catch a ride back later.”  The chip on his shoulder threatened to overbalance him, so heavy was it in his tone.
“You sure you won’t stay?” Dean asked his brother as he carried a pile of boxes out to fit into Sam’s trunk. “The Andersons will be here by dinner. They’ll wanna see you.”
He was knocked out of his reverie when those deep blue eyes turned back to him.  “I want to ask if you’ve considered graduate school, Mr. Winchester.  I know you’re graduating.  Frankly, I think I have an ideal place for you in my project, and I’d like to pitch it to you – see what you think – that is, if you don’t already have a plan for after you graduate.”
“About Wednesday night,” she said.
“I got to break the rules, Kitten. That’s a rare thing for a Dominant. I enjoyed tonight very much. I owe all three of you thanks for your parts in this evening’s very successful play. Tomorrow will tell if I made the right call or if I broke something between Dean and me.”
“Because I know you, little brother,” Dean calmly gave up all pretenses and pressed the advantage.  He DID know Sam.  “We’re going to forge a new way of doing things!  You would get to stand forward in the van and lead the way.  I know you hated those asswipes with their paddles and their sneers back in school.  And you know what?  So does everybody.  Don’t be that, Sam.  Make it different.  Make it about the need, not the power.  Goddamnit, don’t you see?  You could take what you do for me and turn it outward to help thousands, tens of thousands.  You’re not gonna fool me into thinking your wolf doesn’t feed off it when you take me on.  I know better, man.  You might fool a lot of people, but you’re not fooling me.  Look, just listen to what Cas has to say.  Give him this one chance.  Drink his free beer.  Eat his snacks.  It’s all on him.  If you listen to him, and I mean really listen to his vision, and you still want to be a cop, I won’t say another word.”
It was a confrontational question, but Dean knew her, and she had a point. Sort of. This is the kind of interaction he’d most hoped for, in truth. He wanted them to get real with him and let him talk. While the playful banter was fun, it didn’t cut to the heart of anything, and he, Sam, and Cas had all agreed to open the windows to their Pack enough to let it serve as a model for effort if nothing else. Dean desperately wanted to explain.
“No, sir. Please don’t. That would only add to her feelings of inadequacy. She’s trying so hard to balance it all and make you proud, and she’s doing it. If you come to her rescue today, it’ll send her a message that you don’t believe in her. She needs a break. That’s all. Let me and Charlie handle this afternoon. Please. She probably needs you tonight before bedtime, but she doesn’t need you dropping everything to rush home right now.”
Rounding the corner, he could make out the hunched figure, already low to the ground and scuffling, bent over a shadowed shape that was far less cooperative than the fetid alpha wanted her.  She wasn’t screaming, but a muted and persistent mumbling matched the rhythm of her struggles.  She was either gagged or the alpha had her mouth covered tightly with a hand.  He was grunting as he subdued her, vicious strikes aimed at her head from his bulky right arm, while he tangled her legs up in his to prevent her landing a kick.  Cas’ eyes lost all color but red.
“When did that happen?”
“I know,” Michael told him, feeling a nudge from his wolf who wanted to throw in an extra layer of comfort to the nervous Ozzie. Michael waved it back into the shadows, noting that Jody was watching him very closely. “Remember, we talked about this. Your physical didn’t turn up any medical reason for your block. Your physician referred you to us to see if we can figure out what’s causing you to freeze up in the middle of sex. All your plumbing works from a medical perspective.”
It was remorse he was feeling, he decided – the piece that was screwing up his anticipation for tonight. It was remorse.
Billie met them at the limo, fresh-faced and happy.  “Had a good evening, I see,” she sauced at Castiel.
They startled, growling and snarling as Nicholas’ words pierced their dreams.  Identical scowls met Castiel’s undergrad dorm mate, but he didn’t seem to notice.
“Not until you did it. You’re incredible, Dean. Every single day, my sweet alpha.” Cas leaned across the span and kissed Dean chastely then touched his forehead to Dean’s.
He thought he had sufficient motivation now for that.  He wordlessly dangled his keys for Cas as they left the turnstile.
They needed to maintain clear boundaries.  Castiel couldn’t fuck this up.
“Hmm.  Okay.  I’m Bi-.  Pretty equally both ways.  Your turn.”  Michael ran massaging hands across Dean’s shoulders and down his back, kneading the muscles as he went.  Dean arched his back.
“Good boy,” Dean praised.  Then he started the swats back up, turning the power up a little bit.  Just a little.  The pace stayed the same.  Michael’s backside was too sore to miss the intensity shift, and he stiffened and wriggled, working to find a way out of the painful blows.  Dean had him tightly held though, and he couldn’t dodge.
Dean considered the offer, his brow still furrowed.  Was his teacher making a pass?  Was this one of those skanky ‘situations’ that everyone warned Dean about?  They all said he was too pretty and needed to stay alert to inappropriate advances.  He imagined stuffy, droll Dr. Novak trying to back the young alpha into an alley, and the thought made him laugh.  Whatever this was, it wasn’t that.
and their
“Dean, what I told you…what I said.  That was never intended to be a mandate to you.  I don’t need you to reciprocate.  I don’t need that.”
Ketch grumbled a little, mopping his brow and neck with an honest-to-god handkerchief that he’d pulled from his back pocket. “It’s definitely shorter than sixty-seven yards side-to-side, but the back lot looks to be in its proper placement to me. We’d need a survey to be certain. Are you…considering this one, alpha?” Ketch’s tone hit an odd note, but Jack couldn’t tell if it was that he didn’t like the space or that he was struggling with the deference he needed to show.
like I’m still living down the street. I didn’t answer him. I don’t know if I should. I felt like I should show the text to you or delete his contact or something. What should I do? What do you want me to do?”
“He’s not…helping direct?”
“I left you when I Mated April,” Castiel confessed with an air of regret.
“No, Sir,” Dean repeated. The punishment was taking shape in his head, and with it, a determination to perform at the pinnacle of his capacity. He needed to earn his way back into the warmth of those blue eyes. Whether the hurt Cas showed had been real or faked, and Dean suspected more than a grain of it was real, he deserved recompense from his Sub, and he would get the whole nine if it killed Dean.
“Alpha!  It’s so good to see you again.  Please come in.  This must be Jeremy!”
“The reason I let you two stumble your way through this terrible subterfuge is that in the end, I want it just as badly as you do, and I’m convinced that you’ll both make excellent parents. It’s a shitty device to use for the purpose, but it was either going to be this or it was going to be something else. I want this pup. Michael, I want it very badly. I can’t fucking wait for you to make me a Papa…if you’ll…have you thought more about it? Sharing your pups into our foursome? Letting us all have a paw in the mix?”
“And number two?” Cas asked dully.  Every muscle in his body, every ounce of control was engaged in holding tightly to two leashes.
“Sir, you know something about what it takes to be a professional musician, how to build it into the whole of your life…”
Dean scoffed. “Bullshit. Cas will give you anything you want, April. You said you wanted to be a great pianist, and you picked the school. Now you’re acting like he forced you into it and that somehow that means you’ll be chained to the house. Cut the crap. You don’t give a shit about the age difference any more than he does. What are you really after?”
Cas frowned.  “Can’t you finish up at home?  It doesn’t make any sense to make two trips.”
“Yes, Alpha.”  It came to him in stereo.
Cas smiled at him.  “April does.  Don’t you sweet Omega?  Are you ready for your nightly swats?  My hand is itching to pink up a firm round bottom.  Michael’s called dibs on Dean.  That leaves me and you.  What do you say?”
Dean sat up and crossed his legs Omega-style. He licked his lips. “You keep saying that in a fit of passion, your wolf could break me. Right? But that’s not true. Cas, in a fit of passion it might fracture a bone or leave a bad bruise. But it’s not gonna do anything that won’t heal. Not to me. And a chance to feel that storm wash me out to sea…man, I don’t have the words to describe what the feeling is worth to me.”
“I’ll bring you a tray.”
Cas stilled and looked at Dean.  “It’s killing me, Dean.”  His answer was honest.  He knew no other response was going to get past the man smirking in front of him.  They both chuckled.  Cas was predictable to a fault.
“Carry me,” whined Dean pathetically.
Michael sat at the head of the bed, silent after Dean snapped viciously at him over nothing for the fourth time. He wasn’t really even supposed to be here but spending the day in training while Dean mourned without him was a stretch too far, and he’d refused to go. His eyes tracked Dean from a motionless head as Jess’ did Sam. Jess sat beside Michael on the bed, their legs stretched out in front of them, crossed identically at the ankles, watching over their mates but not interfering. Jess lasted a little longer than Michael did, but of course Sam wasn’t hitting a hormonal peak that marked the onset of Rut. Still, after Sam responded to her fifth attempt to encourage him to sit and have a snack by lifting his wide flat palm before his face and inspecting it with great interest followed by a significant look into her eyes, she subsided into tacit compliance and sank down beside Michael. The brothers never snapped at each other though. They seemed to be communicating on a different plane, and wherever they were, they were there together.
“I’m fine, Dean.  I told you, I want you and Alpha to have plenty of time together.  It’s not going to bother me.”  She swept her pile of celery into a bowl and set it next to the skillet he had heating.
Sam looked stricken. “Jesus, would you listen to yourself? You really do have your head so far up your own ass you don’t see it. How do you not see it? Yeah, man, he’s ‘Castiel-Fucking-Novak’.” Sam rolled his eyes, but then they hardened and pierced Dean with intent. “But you’re Dean-Fucking-Winchester! Dude, you two are so freakin’ perfect for each other, it’s, it’s crazy.”  Sam straightened in his chair and took up an official-looking expression.
“I have enough, Dean,” she told him.  “I get to keep my music.  We can have a family.  I have him, and you.  I have Michael…for now.”  She suppressed a shuddering breath and turned it into a firm statement of strength.  “I have it worlds better than most Ozzies.  He takes me seriously enough to bring in trainers and all kinds of resources to help me develop.  What other Alpha do you know who would do that, even if they could afford to?  I never dreamed I could have a Pack like this, or an Alpha like him.”
Castiel cleared his throat, and Adam blanched, looking stricken. But a glance at Cas proved he was teasing. Sarah whapped her Alpha’s chest as he sauntered past the couple, much as April often did. Out of her peripheral vision, Sarah saw Benny clap Cas on the shoulder and reach out for a handshake.
He hadn’t been lying about his sister.  She demanded an answer, and she seemed on the verge of calling Castiel herself.  He tapped out a terse response and then set the phone face down on the coffee table.  Michael closed his eyes and kicked his shoes onto the floor with a couple of loud clomps.  The image that his brain provided was the same that had tortured his dreams all night.  Castiel, with blood dripping from his elbow, laying a body out on a white sheet and catching the right hand in his own, laying the hand atop its owner’s belly and securing the unresponsive arm inside the rail.  The Alpha’s eyes had never stopped moving over the body until he waylaid the mate with a gloveless left hand, his right still so fouled with blood that the Alpha had tucked it obscurely behind himself so as not to alarm the beta.
“That was no wolf, Castiel. Wolves don’t give a fuck about psychotherapy…”
“Yeah,” Dean replied.  His voice sounded odd to him, forced, and he wondered idly what that was all about.  “No, man, I get it.  I do.”
***************
“You and I can never be equal partners, my Alpha.  We’re too far apart on the spectrum.  No matter what we do or say, we’ll always have a power difference between us.  Always.”
Meg clutched at his arm.  “I can’t go in there, Dean.  Charlie hates me.  She came to me for help, and I sent her away in tears.”
“Come on, big brother.  Lean on me.  I’ll help you get to bed.”
I know, I know.  I said no more for a week, but I'm weak.  So weak.
“You’ll get a lot more information about how it all fits together in your Omega training class.  Also, just real quick: Michael, you don’t ever have to obey a wolf who isn’t
It was the idea of trust that decided it for Dean.  If Cas sent him off, he’d have gone, but he’d grumble the whole way about being treated like a pup.  His eyes just wouldn’t stay open though, and what was likely if he stayed was that he’d be snoring in his chair in a matter of minutes, and then he’d look even more foolish.
Dean chuckled and nuzzled his cheek along his son’s warm head.  “Babe, I’m in.  He and I will settle.  Maybe we’ll need a scuffle or two, maybe not.  I don’t know.  If it comes to that, you need to understand I’m not holding back, and I’m not giving up until he rolls belly up.  If it turns scrappy, I need to know you’ll let us do whatever we gotta.”
Cas chuckled again.  “Figure it out,” he instructed.  “That’s what she hired you for.”
Jess stifled a laugh, and Sam’s lips quirked up before he suppressed it.
“Good luck,” he told her. “Break a leg. Hang tough, Kitten. You’re stronger than you think.”
thing that’s real.”
“What are you planning?” Dean asked astutely, narrowing his green eyes.
“Where did Mark go?” asked Castiel, looking around.
There wasn’t. Even if he’d been braver than he was and could convince himself to dive through the flames, there was nothing on the other side but a glowing pit of Hell. It’s all that was open to him, burning Hell. He screamed in frustration and agony and pounded his fist into the wall at his shoulder just as the floor gave way, and he fell into red-hot, ember covered, smoke-filled Hell.
They shared the space in solidarity and silence for a few minutes, Dean’s state of mind leaking out to blanket Castiel.  At length, Cas felt the moment ripen, and he broke the silence.
Dean snorted rudely. “The two situations are night and day, man. It’s apples and oranges. You knew their relationship was short-term. Everyone knew. Adam’s un-Mated. But, Michael, you’re not. You already jumped that hurdle. Seriously, man, look at me. Omega, damnit, look at me.”
Benny smirked wryly with praise for Sam’s insight.  “There’s my long range ingénue.  This war is going to outlast my generation, Sam.  You and Jo, Dean, Michael, April, the whole lot of you in your twenties will still be fighting after we retire.  You keep your eyes open for the next generation to come.  They’re only about twelve years old right now, so you have some time to focus on yourselves and your fight, but keep the long game in sight, boy.  Pace yourself.  Don’t let it wear you down.”
Setting April back upright, he beckoned Michael closer, and shocked both of their mates by doing precisely the same thing to him.  Michael came back upright breathless and wide-eyed, panting hard and stumbling a bit.  Castiel held his eye with a smolder that robbed Michael of whatever oxygen he had left, and then turned to face Dean.  He bent low and captured Dean’s lips with his own, adding a bite to the tender flesh that made Dean cry out and flinch before he released him.
going to be your weapon again.  If you need a dagger, you do it your own damn self!”
“It was a joke, sir. I was kidding!”
April frowned at him, confused.  “Dean, that’s not…a good idea at all.  What will Alpha think? What if he thinks we’re…?”
There was an uncomfortable shuffling murmuration. They knew. Cas hated to have his birthday celebrated. His grip in Dean’s hair remained hard enough to pull the flesh of Dean’s temples tight across his eyes. Dean huffed. Cas ignored him.
“Walk, Omega!” Castiel admonished with a roll of his eyes as he met Bobby’s.  They shared a bemused chuckle.
“Whatever kind you like.”
“Impala,” murmured Dean.
“I guess I thought you would talk to him.”
THIS!” She gestured wildly toward the school with its pretentious entry arch and Latin engraving.
Bobby put a reassuring hand on his shoulder and nodded. The older alpha asked Dean, “You coming?”
“Instinct battling with experience, maybe,” Kate decided. “I’m wired to trust alphas in spite of everything, especially one like Dean. He’s solid without being commanding. Know what I mean? But Doms have no presentation other than commanding. It’s their whole persona. The last thing I need is someone ordering me around right now.”
Cas put a hand up to Dean to prevent him from just cranking Sam’s chain.  “Sam, you’ve been trained to handle Subs in an institutional environment.  It’s critical that you keep your emotions out of your work because the other party involved is often out of control emotionally and you need to stay objective to watch over them.  That style of punishment suits you well.  It’s a comfortable place for you to work from, and it makes you ideal in your job.”  Cas looked at Dean.  “I think Dean’s trying to tell you that your mate isn’t suited to the same approach.  She wants your anger and your fury.  Her Submissive wolf, for whatever reason, needs to see you get emotional.  I believe she’s looking for you to get riled.  Do you think you can do that for her?”
Sam strolled among the desks as he spoke, drawing their eyes to the edges of the classroom where he’d mounted silicone dummy backsides and a plethora of striking tools.
“You’re going to have to deal with it, Cas. He’s testing you.”
“How close, Dean?”
“I scared myself today,” Michael admitted, stepping closer and tucking into his mate’s embrace.  Dean’s arms responded on their own.  He wrapped himself around the Omega who smelled like home and hearth and adventure and rainbows and dragons and puppies and lightning…and rain.  Dean whimpered again.  Michael was distressed, and it was Dean’s overwhelming responsibility to soothe him.  “I could have killed all of us, and you let me do it.”
“My safeword is Celestial,” he reminded everyone.  “Kitten, please state yours.”
“Yes, Alpha,” Erich replied respectfully. But he smirked at his lap where his father couldn’t see.
“The tide is turning, Dean,” Cas said firmly.  “We’re seeing the last stand of a dying breed.  The Alpha patriarchy enjoyed a brief moment in the sun, but it’s unsustainable, and it’s crumbling now.  They’re losing their power, and no one ever gives up power willingly.  We always knew it would be a fight.”
“So you believe it was having grown up around it that inoculated you from being disturbed by what they do to each other?”
“Her plan is nonsense.  It’s a childish whim, and I can’t begin to make it work.  She won’t listen to reason.”
“I thought we agreed you would leave me out of your stupid games!” he spat.  “What the fuck do you want, and why was it necessary to put me in the line of fire again?  I just got myself untangled, no thanks to you!  Now Cas thinks we’re meeting in secret!  What was with all the goo-goo eyes at the table?  Are you insane?”
Michael looked up at him in surprise.  Cas was divesting his mate of the syringes and touching her cheek gently.  “Would you like a round with Michael, Kitten?  If you’re both up for it, you have my permission.  An Omega can give you a few things that I can’t.”
“Nuh-unh,” he contradicted stubbornly. “This is something else. She never wanted in that damned school anyway, and now she’s got exactly what she wanted. She’ll get to spread ‘em wide and breed up big and fat just like her mate wants her to. This is something else.”
He spent an eternity working Dean’s hole over with tongue and teeth and lips, one foot braced a step or two down for stability.  Dean hand-walked backward to win himself position and find better friction for his dick.  All attempts to wiggle free or maneuver upward were abandoned.
But she shook her head. “It’s a group effort, Michael. It’s an effect of how all of the adults approach them.”
“That’s what I thought.”  He sat in a chair near the couch and nodded her toward it.  It didn’t take her long to arrange her notes and recorder.
“Jesus, Benny. I don’t know what to say.”
Cas raised a brow at her, and she giggled.  It was an old joke.  April had nothing to fear from Cas, even if Ben’s eyes were turning green.  Her pregnancy four years ago came as a surprise to everyone, and in the aftermath, both men realized that through one mechanism or another, the pup could be either of theirs.  Castiel’s abhorrence of condoms had made him eschew them even at a transitional moment after he gave up tutoring Omegas and weaned himself off the heavy doses of hormonal birth control.  Michael was still nursing Renée, and he wasn’t taking any birth control at all.  They’d both become complacent.  In the hush that followed, they discussed paternity testing, if for no other reason than to be sure which name belonged on the pup’s birth certificate.  Their son deserved to know.  But they decided to wait.  At some point, Benjamin would be old enough to decide for himself whether to request testing.  In the interim, Castiel’s name resided on his birth certificate as Pack Alpha and father.  It wasn’t wrong.  It just might not be entirely right.
Dean only hesitated long enough to work out in his head if his mate should reasonably have the authority to inspect another Dom’s handiwork.  He concluded quickly that yes, Michael should have that right.  Dean stood up next to the table and turned outward.  He unbuckled his belt and shoved everything down to mid-thigh, holding the back of his shirttail up out of the way and craning his head around to see for himself.
“What?! Of course it…”
Down between their thighs, Dean fist-bumped his mate, more about their similarity than because of any pride at early prowess.
Michael helped April to her feet and then reached a hand down to Cas, who took it. The four of them, alone now on the back patio but for Cain who was overseeing the cleanup crew, made their way as a unit into the house. It was quiet.
“You provoked him, didn’t you?”
He smiled softly.  “That is entirely mutual.  We’ve been through quite a lot, he and I.”
Lust fairly poured off of Castiel, leaving pink circles high on his cheeks and more black pupil to his eye than either blue or red in his irises.  His eyes raked the length of Dean’s body, taut as a bowstring, aroused and sweating.  Castiel closed his fist around Dean’s erection and stroked firmly.  Dean’s breath caught and his eyes closed.  A wrinkle formed between them.  His hips thrust forward, losing him his balance for a moment, but he caught himself before he lost a step.  Castiel fisted Dean’s cock for a handful of strokes, spreading the silky precome over the head with his thumb.
on Sunday.  Live.  In studio.  And you’re going to instruct Dean to pick two appearances on my list as well.  I don’t give a flaming rat’s behind which two.”
“I didn’t know he would abscond with our pups! He’s just going to grab them and run, isn’t he? We’ll be lucky to get visitation rights!” Jess winked at Dean at the foot of the table to show she wasn’t upset, and he grinned back in victory.
“We’ll have to play that by ear when she wakes,” Cas told him. “The usual intensity wasn’t cutting it for either of us. It took the bullwhip to finally get some traction. Her back is a bit of a mess.”
Dean ignored his belligerence. “Michael, I’m sorry I was a dick to you. I’m sorry I called you names and said you’re a child.” He huffed a frustrated breath. “I’m sorry that I bowled right over your feelings and treated you like a doormat. I do respect you, man. You mean the world to me, and you deserve better. I swear I didn’t ask April to help me with the lines, but I did do the ones that had some skipped words. That’s on me. I threw all of those out, and I’ve been working on them while I waited for you to wake up. I’ve got something like three hundred sixty now.” Dean began to apply a third coat of arnica awkwardly to Michael’s sideways cheeks, reaching over his hip, trying not to look at him bared naked to his thighs.
Sarah took a seat with the toddler in her lap, finding herself amused at Dean’s plight rather than mortified, clearly feeding off Castiel’s pleasure. Jess plunked down beside her with Hank.
Cas glanced at him in slight annoyance and sighed. “Directly. Yes.”
“When you rise,” Cas told him almost coldly.  “You do so as alpha.  You do so in the full weight of your designations and your Pack position.  You stand up into your birthright, untarnished and unadulterated by any ritual, but you do so through me – only through me, always through me, purely through me.  I charge you, Dean Michael Winchester, to live through me.”
“You don’t have to lie to be contrite, Dean.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Whatever. Come on, I need to dress for breakfast, and you need to finish your coffee before Michael takes it away from you for breakfast kneeling.”
“Fred, stop.  I get it.  I don’t need a cast list.”
“Probably,” Dean conceded, “but you’re taking swats, what, two or three times a week anyway?  Wouldn’t it be a nice change if they bought you something besides a clear head?”
“And yet?” Dean prodded.
“I was gone for one night.”
and cram it up your ass! I don’t want it!”
“No, I mean
“You know that Jo can always tell when you’re hiding something, April.” Charlie kicked April’s foot gently. “And you know she’s gonna make you spill it. Why don’t you go ahead and make it easy on all of us? I don’t want to listen to her bitch.”
It's a whole rambling chapter of coming back to themselves as a pack after all the trauma.
“He called me a baby.  Why doesn’t he get swats, too?”
“Not really ready for this conversation, Pete.”
Cas evidently decided to let Dean stand for his mate.  “After everything I’ve done for him!  Everything!  He’s still…  He thinks he can…  I’m NOT HAVING IT, DEAN!”
“Do you need reassurance from me that my matrimonial bonds haven’t weakened?”
Really?  What if you don’t respond the way you’re hoping to?  What if she doesn’t?”
The Dom pumped his fingers in and out of Dean’s hole, lubricated only with melting water and the trace of synthetic slick that remained after the plug was removed.  It wasn’t enough, and he felt raw.  Dean wanted so badly to shove back against the warm fingers, take them fully inside him and melt the goddamned ice cube, but he refrained.  He hadn’t been given permission to participate yet.  He hoped very much he would be.
Michael, relieved beyond measure that he would live to see the sun rise, held a hand out to April to bring her back up to take her place again, saddle mounted, and as she slid back into her position, he said, “Dean’s fine, Alpha.”
“You’re forgiven,” he whispered reverently. “And we’re done with this round. It’s over, Dean. Let it go. Come sit by the fire with me. Let’s calm down and take it easy from here. Deal?”
“Standard adoption fees and a down payment on having her spayed when she gets a little older,” Cas answered thoughtfully.  “And a substantial contribution to the shelter to provide the means of supporting the rest of the litter until homes can be found.  It took some convincing to get the “Kill list” scrubbed.”
“We’ll let Sam referee that one,” Cas agreed cheerfully.
“I understand, Alpha,” she said.  She didn’t sound nervous to Dean, and he figured that either meant she was bad-ass or irretrievably naïve.  “I don’t want this project to interfere with your work in any way.”
HIM!”
Kali knelt behind him after making sure that he was positioned correctly, and she huffed in amusement when she noticed a pearly drop forming slowly at the tip of his lengthening penis.
“No, I’m sure you haven’t. But I also know that you long to be seen and validated for the magnificent woman you are. Even if that never happens, even if she never changes, never stretches out a hand to you, you’re not yet ready to cut that tie. Sarah, that day may come, and if it does, I will be here to hold you while you grieve. But you’re not there yet. And she may surprise you. I don’t make this demand lightly. I will never force you to maintain a connection that harms you, but if I allow you to pull back your hand and deny her the bridge to reconciliation while there is a chance it could still happen, while it remains so important to you, I would be remiss as your Alpha. Again,” he struck that tone that she felt she could fall right into and never hit the ground, “I ask you to trust me.”
Michael melted into his mate and moved his body in a slow sway with the music, resting his forehead on Dean’s shoulder and closing his eyes.  They danced slowly, rotated and ground their hips together, kissed softly, and rocked as if alone and naked.
“So you’ve said.” Dean refused to meet his eyes.
Castiel kissed him once more, looked deeply into his eyes and then nodded firmly.  “It’s only 1:30, and we’ve got the Blue Room all night, Dean.  When you need to rest, you rest.  There’s no rush.  Don’t push yourself.”
Gabe was bluffing.  It wouldn’t have mattered how much he kicked, the elder Novak liked having his little brother curled up against him.  They didn’t talk about it, but they both slept better when they were together than they did separately.
“I didn’t want to spring this on you while you were in public. I wanted to be able to stand and explain. Dean, she’s broken. I need to watch over her while she heals. Once she can walk, I can move her to The Facility, but she stays here for now. That part isn’t negotiable. After that, the choice about where she goes is yours.”
“That’s right.  That’s all you have to do.”
“Well, if we don’t see you tonight, we’ll understand why.  The dread that just came through my Mating-bond from a Sub who isn’t even on the other end of that glower of yours tells me you may be otherwise detained.  Please stop by if you can.  It would mean a great deal to Gabe,” said Cas by way of a dismissal.  He was still laughing softly to himself after Fred nodded and excused himself.  He sighed expansively and stretched his bare legs out, working the blood back into them.  “Can we start over, kitten?  I want to know you for real, and I don’t think I do yet.”
“You son of a bitch,” he said quietly. “I’m not going in there.”
He whined.
Dean glanced across at him, reading his mind as easily as ever, a light of potential burning in his eyes.  “Right?  You see it, don’t you?”
“Castiel James!”
And I made lifelong friends.  And I’m speechless about that.  And I love all of you so much, it hurts physically.  In a good way.  Please enjoy the final chapter.
“Are you taking April with you?”
“All right,” said Cas in a deep breath. “I’m starting with twenty-six. You don’t need to count. Stop me if you need to.”
“Next come the formal oaths, then we eat and celebrate,” the Alpha enumerated.  “After tonight, we’re a pack in truth, not just on paper.  I received notification by email today that our application for Pack status has been filed and accepted.  The timing is excellent, but we already have a couple more names to add to the original filing.  We can do that at the Federal building in Topeka next week after April’s Heat ends.  Dean, will you take care of filing for Douglas County Residency for us?  I don’t have to be present for that, my signature on the form will suffice.”
“I’ll bet,” the Omega observed, filling a water glass for his Alpha at the sink. “How’s Pete?”
“You’re getting paranoid in your old age,” teased Dean.
“I’m not pregnant, boss. You don’t have to worry about me taking maternity leave while we’re transitioning. I know how big a serving I’m taking on. I’m not going to let your precious department drop.”
“What do you want, Dean?”
Not two, Michael realized as he stepped closer; six more.  Inside the crib, snuggled on either side of the wicker bassinet, Benny’s daughters slept together at the foot of the crib, and Sam’s twins curled up into each other at the head.  It was a puppy pile of babies.
Was Dean honestly growing right before his eyes?
“Yes, hello Alpha.  Sorry to bother you.  No, sir, we didn’t forget anything, exactly.  I was wondering if I might borrow something of yours for Dean?”  He paused briefly, and Dean forgot himself and closed his eyes.
“What can I do to help, Sir?” Adam asked.  He was kneeling by the door, soft and sweet.
“Pete’s getting a puppy,” Michael responded, sitting Hank up higher to try to keep him breathing easily.
“You know all of this. You know why we fought so hard before she died. You know about the bills and the creditors. You know I tried to be enough, do enough, earn enough, tried to keep her out of having to work. You know I told her all we cared about was having her home, that none of the things she was working for were worth the hours she was gone. You know it was never worth it. You remember, Dean? You remember after she died, and we talked about it? All we ever wanted was her, and I tried to tell her that. I tried to make her understand none of us cared about the stuff or the money. We didn’t have a lot, but we had enough. It wasn’t worth it, was it, son? You knew. Sam knew. I could never convince Mary.”
“I did, but had she been fully invested in listening to her instinct, she would have been invested in the Pack emotionally and wired to protect all of its members in their need.  When Gertrude died, Naomi’s instincts will have been urging her to take him back up and tuck him close as her son.  I believe that Naomi arrived at Zachariah’s doorstep already severely damaged by her own parents’ attempts to assimilate.  She was taught that the impulses of her wolf were a weakness to be destroyed, and indeed, the one time she heeded her instinct, it meant the irrevocable loss of her own son.”
“All right.  Thanks for telling me.  Is that all?”
Her optimistic exterior evaporated as April felt the first true pangs of labor biting into her lower back coupled with an unpleasant sensation of the pup at her spine shifting downward.  She shed the Madonna façade like a cloak falling to the floor, and she clung to her mate’s arm, searching his eyes for signs he was hiding worry from her.
“Charlie?” Michael prodded.
What was he doing here? Dean pulled at the bond, beat at it. It wasn’t the distance; the bastard had closed it on purpose. There were too many people between them. Too many ways Michael might be hurt before Dean could get there.
“I broke the ‘no contact’ rule, Sir!  I spanked and paddled Primate – aargh! – Primate students, in violation of my agreement with you…Aaahhh!....and in violation of the law!  I’m not permitted to touch Primates!  No Lupin is permitted to touch Primates in a professional – oomph – capacity!”
“Alpha, she’s already better trained than most of the morons out there making a shitty living as musicians-for-hire.  Get her a coach if you want, but it’s a crutch.  You need to know that.  It’s training wheels, and she doesn’t need them.”  He looked at a blushing Mark, who had pulled Matt’s hand into his lap.  “No offense, mate.”
“Because you’re Omega, goddamnit. Fuck, I don’t make the rules! I don’t like it any better than you do, but the world is not ready to embrace a Dominant Omega, man, not one like you. They will tear you apart.”
“No!” Cas shot back vehemently.  “Things have changed.  I have the full scope of April’s emotions open before me now.  No one’s going to sneak into her affections without me knowing about it.  That’s not ever going to happen again, Dean.”
“Ohio is halfway between here and New York, isn’t it?  Maybe they can come too.  We might be able to find some space with a piano.  Surely you can spare someone to
Dean set his head against Castiel’s cheek. “That trunk is me, Cas. I’m not ever going to be better than this.”
She was silent for a long beat, thinking about how to break through his walls.  She really wanted to talk to his wolf.  She knew one direct route, but it was kind of a low blow to go that way.  Pamela threw caution to the wind.  “Cas, tell me about your relationship with Dean Winchester.”
“Look,” said the dickwad in tuxedo pants. “I get it. You misread what you were seeing. It happens. We should maybe play at home next ti…!” He choked off his word as Cas shifted his arm to fall across his throat.
Castiel wasn’t truly worried about his Keller class.  He had no idea how Dean would manage it, but he knew it would happen.  It would happen, and all the specs would be ticked off the list perfectly.  He half expected Dean to find a place with a Starbucks and a sushi bar built into it, or free childcare included, or some other crazy benefit that he’d never have thought to look for.  Such was the nature of Dean’s miracles.  Cas could let that one fall off his to-do list now that Dean had taken custody.  One worry of many.
“I will smack you if you touch it again,” Gabriel warned, turning to stand at Cas’ shoulder so they could both see the figure he made in the full length mirror in the bathroom of his Facility suite.  Cas had barely slept last night, even with April tucked warmly into his side where she belonged.  He wanted Dean more than April at the moment.  He felt wrong-footed without Dean beside him.  Somehow, they’d both agreed that a night apart made sense coming into the big day.  Cas had left the house for the night.
“Isn’t that what you want, too?” Charlie asked carefully.
“It can’t work like that, Castiel James.”  Dean usually only used his full name when he had a strong point to make.  “Marriage, not Mating, remember?”  Dean ignored the niggling discomfort that told him Cas had hit the nail on the head, and Dean really did need wrapping in bubble-wrap.
“Gloating would be pointless,” he said with little enthusiasm.  “I called this one.  Next time, it’ll likely be you.”
“I’d miss a lot of services. I travel a lot.”
Dean picked up on the threat of castration.  Or, well, he could tell that there was a dire threat roaming around in Michael’s head, and he was familiar enough with Michael’s thought patterns to be able to connect the dots.
“Feeling better?” Michael asked from his place on the bed, on his belly with his heels raking over his backside, and his chin cradled in his arms.
Guys, I got quite a bit dirtier in this chapter than I usually do.  Really, just know, I have like, no limits at all, but some of you might, so be aware.  It's dirtier than usual.
Gabe fumed silently.
She laughed.  “Your son is sitting in poop, Michael.  I’m pretty sure you’re not a god.”
“It’s just…”  He decided she was right.  He had nothing to lose.  “Everything I do for Jess seems to make her mad, and I can’t figure out why.  I’ve tried everything, but she just gets angrier and angrier, and now she seems to be hurt on top of being pissed off, like I’m doing something wrong on purpose.”
Dean’s mouth fell open, and his face paled. “Oh. Uh, really?”
Dean had barely a moment to take in the fury before his brother unleashed it on him full-force.
coming home tomorrow night. I will tell the FBI everything I can tell them just as it happened, and I have enough safeguards and alibis in place to cover the gaps. My goal is not to turn myself in. It’s to satisfy them well enough that they feel no need to harass anyone else on the staff. Relax. Bobby’s done his job well. It’s going to be fine.”
“How about a walk?” April suggested.  “You could use some air.  Walk me home, big boy?”  She batted her eyes coquettishly, and Michael’s laugh was a sophomoric bubble bursting wetly through his lips.  April smiled in amusement.  “I’ll go tell Cas.  Don’t move.  Don’t fall over.  I’m not good at picking men up off the ground.”
She sighed and set the bottle down.  “Is that what this is for?”  She looked across at him, searching with her eyes.
“He can eat now,” he told the cook who was determined not to look at him.  Michael dropped a cloth off beside Tony and then settled beside him.  They fed the twins peacefully.
“Jesus Christ,” Aaron murmured, enthralled.  He dove in to kiss Dean, plundering his mouth with his tongue, and Dean let the Ozzie take custody of the bitter salty fluid, passing it across to him placidly.  That kiss.  It was the same as before.  It had been Aaron’s mouth on his earlier.
“Benny’s not in it.  Neither is Dean.  Bobby wants it kept clean and simple.  It’s just you, me, and Bobby from The Facility.  Everyone else is off-campus and unconnected.”
Castiel’s heart melted a bit. His blue eyes, already canted in form to have a sympathetic lien, softened, and he caught Michael’s eye, watching the Omega flail a bit before reaching for his Alpha.
Dean groaned and rolled to get the pressure off his dick.  He sat up on the edge of the bed, bent over and breathing hard.  “Somehow, I think you and I have different ideas about what would help.  I don’t need any ice, thanks.”
Cas directed the cabbie to drop him off at the employee entrance. He badged in as an employee, as the networks between facilities were all connected to the same database, and he went to meet with the Facility Director, a former colleague of his from Kansas, Victor Henrickson. It was a courtesy call. As Alpha, Castiel didn’t need Victor’s approval to transfer Dean back to Kansas, but it would be a douche move, as Dean would say, to do it without giving Henrickson a heads-up. No director deserved to be blindsided like that.
“Are you ready, Sarah?” Sam asked, scooting his chair back and helping her gather her items.  “Once we go through those double doors, it’s anything goes, really.  No one’s going to touch you.  You’re completely safe.  Everything that happens is for a reason, and I’ll talk you through all of it.”
Then they moved from the whats, wheres, whens, and whys of her childhood into her adult life.  What had she experienced in preparing for the Bar?  Had she had biases to face?  How did she overcome them?
The rhythm slowed without notice, drawing to a simple unremarkable close without Castiel’s usual flurry of intense swats that marked a finale of sorts.  He simply slowed his pace and then stopped altogether with a loud, deep breath.
“Doubled it is,” Cas replied. “But for using my name. And yes, right here. Anything else to say?”
to know he’ll fight to keep me at some point, not just always try to throw me away and hope I fight to stay. I need him to show me he needs me enough to fight for it. It’s selfish, I know, but this isn’t a Mating-bond. It has to be at least a little balanced or it can’t work. I needed to let him go on and pull whatever stunt he was going to pull and see where it would take him, see if there’s any point along the way where he would be able to put on the brakes and stop himself for me, for
“First, you need to eat.  Stay here.  I’ll bring you something.”
“Carrying our pup didn’t stop you from going suicidal yesterday when you flipped him the bird with a Dominance display he wasn’t prepared for.  You’re not showing the best of judgment these days, Omega.”
Cas bustled into the kitchen.  “Here it is, Michael.  I knew I’d saved it.  Take a look and tell me what you think.”  Cas turned to Dean with a hand on his back and a kiss to his cheek.  “Dean, we’re looking into venues.  I’m not crazy about using a church setting since I have no intention of adhering to a religious life.  I don’t want to be disingenuous.  I found an event venue that is large and adaptable to a range of different configurations.  What do you think?”
Cas gave him a thoughtful look. “We’re not ready for that yet, Michael. But I’d be willing to discuss it this evening. Let’s get April and go outside.”
Michael set off slowly to cross the room once more.  Across and back before he answered.  “I don’t, no.  I think one was enough for me.  At least for a while.”
“Are you fucking kidding me?  I’m not prepared for that!”
Half standing behind his mate, Dean worked his own pants low with one hand, keeping the other roaming over the flesh of his swiftly heating mate. In no time he was sliding a hand around to Michael’s chest and guiding him back up and slowly backward. Dean kept his eyes on his work, his grip on the soft bulge of his knot supporting his aim as he brought Michael back and slid him slowly onto the target whispering, “Keep your eyes on your audience, Omega. Look at them. Look them right in the eye and moan for me.”
Wednesday, February 15, 2017
“I’m reaching beneath you, baby. Gonna unsnap the ring. Don’t flinch. Be my good boy.” Dean squeezed his eyes closed. His body so flooded with adrenalin and endorphins, it felt separate from the mind holding him to a regular breathing pattern, frustratingly necessary if he intended to maintain consciousness through his reward. Separate too, was the wolf, panting in the sunlight, ears pricked forward, then laying swiftly down again in a circular repeat, looking for something solid.
Third, to get the most out of this THEN section, I recommend spending some time watching Misha's portrayal of Castiel on your television screen for a bit so that his incredible voice work will be fresh in your head.  That voice is critical to this scene.
No one had ever called Dean that before, but it sounded so natural coming from the Alpha’s mouth, that Dean barely noticed it.  And that question, no one had ever asked him that either.  “Please, Sir!  Hit me!  Need to feel it.  Please!”  Dean fantasized about being spanked all the time.  He wanted it so badly, but he’d never been brave enough to ask anyone for it.  He was alpha.  Alphas did the spanking.  They only received it when they’d fucked up egregiously and needed a real and lasting punishment.  Dean hadn’t been really spanked since he was a pup.  Sam took him over a knee every now and then, but that was different.  It was.
April cued the band, and they began a subtle pulse. Michael’s voice rang out much higher than before. April had been impressed when he showed her that he could pull off an alto as well. He had quite a range for an amateur.
“I can check. You two get dressed and wash your faces. The Andersons are due by supper time. We need to turn out for them. Dean?”
If Sammy was taking a lower rung to this douchewad, Dean would make sure Cain earned it.
“It’s a lie, Sir,” Dean stated with his head craned back to watch his Alpha.
Above the door, the light blinked on.  Dean met everyone’s eye and silently asked for their go-ahead.  Mason pressed Tyler’s head to one of the mattresses and sank smoothly into him from behind with a groan of pleasure while Ryan swallowed Austin down in the middle of the room.  Dean blew out a breath and swung his arms.  Ready or not.
“Yes, Alpha. I, um, I’m hoping to do my doctoral dissertation on comparative cultures between our two species. I want to get an up-close look at adolescent Lupin development and socialization. Sir, I want to see how you train young Canids as they come of age. To be of any use, to be more than what’s already out there, I need to see it for myself. I’m asking for full access to your facility.”
They got the Winchester couple situated with little fuss, and the four of them giggled their way into the kitchen entrance.  Only Cas was tipsy, but his playful mood infected everyone.
“We have to talk some things through before I let Castiel in. I need you to be clear on how things stack up, and where we’re all going.”  Dean watched his mate’s eyes.
“Pshh!  Fall over.  Huh!  I’m good.”
He crumpled in defeat.  He couldn’t fight all of them, not when he wasn’t sure what he was even fighting for anymore.
“You do, Sir,” she responded without hesitation.
‘Yep, now it’s suckier.’
April hyper-flexed her knees and bowed her back, starting to whimper before he’d even hit her.  Castiel used the rubber sole of her slipper to build a solid sting in just two spots, on the underside of either cheek, alternating back and forth very hard and very fast.  She began to cry almost immediately but didn’t move her body or her hands.  Her ass turned pink, then red, then the skin began to abrade a little.  Cas growled into his work.  The others couldn’t see the interplay between them inside their bonds.  He gloried at her immediate and full submission, and she stood in awe of his power.
“Just now, that’s what you were thinking wasn’t it?  About how much you love being the Top to those two?  This wasn’t your scene, it was Michael’s.”  She maintained an amused touch to her voice.
"Pssshh, it’s nine o’clock, doofus! Work ended hours ago.” Rachel smirked.
“That was a big step for Dean, wasn’t it?” she asked.
I hope everyone has a lovely and spooky Halloween.
Cas smacked his lips.  “All right.  Back to business.  You two took longer than I allowed by, oh, let’s see, about three minutes.  Michael had an excuse, but I told you to come right back, Dean.  I’ll add on to your total for keeping me waiting.”  Cas turned Dean’s head and examined his swollen lips.  “You spent that extra few minutes kissing?  Really?”
They drove over yesterday evening and encountered a delivery truck leaving the driveway, rumbling out from the big house and passing Castiel’s car by the two-story guard house which Cas said the security team used as a base office, but where no one had lived for years.  The delivery truck was painted with a bigger-than-life image of a grand piano.  April turned and watched it leave and then met Castiel’s eye.  He looked very smug.
Castiel took his lower lip in his teeth and fought his own wolf’s burning desire to take hold of Dean and ravage him on the spot. Instead, he smiled kindly at his Sub. “You are so good for me, Pet. Come here and kneel for me, please.” Dean scrambled into place before the Alpha, letting pleasure replace the tension in his shoulders. Holding the alpha in place was exhausting, and he needed a recharge. Castiel positioned him beneath the desk with a little fumbling and pulled Dean’s head to rest on his knee. The Alpha rested one hand on Dean’s head, scratching lightly at his scalp every now and again. He booted his computer back up and let Dean’s tears absorb into his slacks silently and unremarked. He could feel the release of tension as Dean slowly assumed the position his wolf needed. There would still be time for Dean to come back to the alpha that Michael needed from him before Cas locked up in the playroom and brought Dean’s wolf out completely.
Cas picked up his phone and dialed. “My suite. Right now. We’re celebrating. Don’t plan to sit again for the rest of the day.”
“Whoa!” Charlie exclaimed as she met the two of them stalking side by side down the hall, decidedly not looking at each other.  Charlie stopped them.  “Tension.  Knife.  Cut.  And I mean, like, wow.  What up, bitches?”
He didn’t remember moving, but he found his arms circling his mate’s waist as his chin came to rest on the Omega’s shoulder. Michael didn’t pause. He didn’t seem embarrassed in the slightest. He leaned backward into Dean and kept singing. The pup’s eyes blinked three times slowly and then stopped opening altogether. Michael smiled through the last line and then laid him in the portable crib beside his sleeping brother with a soft sigh.
Love y'all!
“No. You listen to me, alpha. You picked up a crap message when you were a pup. You thought that alphas only have one acceptable presentation, and you swallowed that message down into your soul. You tried to be something you’re not, and it ate you up from the inside. It felt like you were being punished because it hurt every time you squashed your own impulses, and it hurt every time you didn’t. You tried to live up to someone else’s image. But, baby, their image is bullshit compared to what you really are.”
“They’re ready for you, sweet cheeks,” the beta girl chirped, Meg, she’d called herself.  “Just follow me.  We’re going to a different room this time.  We like to keep the scents separate, so we can be sure what you’re reacting to.”  She led him down a hall, chatting happily.  He wore the thin, scratchy bathrobe they’d provided, and he could feel the lube slipping out of him and running down his legs as he walked.  “Don’t be nervous, alpha.  Lots of folks get nervous on the last round.  You’ll do fine.  Dr. Novak doesn’t do this very often, but it always goes extra smooth when he’s here.  Everybody loves Castiel.  You’re gonna be just fine.  Just go with whatever your body wants you to do, okay?  There’s no wrong response.  Even if you get off into your front brain for some reason, your body chemistry will still tell us everything we need to know.  You can’t mess this up.  Just be yourself and don’t worry.  Here we are.”  She ushered him into a stark brightly lit room.  It looked more like a hospital room than the one before.  That one had resembled a dilapidated motel room with a long mirror down one side.  This one appeared to be all business.  Two walls were mirrored here, not just one, and there was some kind of high tech equipment along the other two walls.
“What did she tell you about me?” Gabe asked again.
“No. I’m not.”
“Yeah.  I, uh, just need to put the finishing touches on the syllabus and make sure I can cover everything in four weeks.  We’re offering it as a pilot for the first round, limiting enrollment to just six people at first.  Sarah’s going to be there too.  She’s offered to be an assistant, helping me bridge the cultural gaps.  She catches on really fast.  We understand each other most of the time, and she can help a lot.  I just wish I was sure it’s a good idea to present this stuff to apes at all.  You know Dean was all for it until he wasn’t.  Cas was on board, and then he pulled the plug, too.  Are you sure?”  Sam stepped out of the way as the handlers wrangled the wheelchair to fold up and tried to maneuver it awkwardly out the side tunnel door.
Dean’s teeth took hold of his lower lip.  He didn’t notice.  All his attention was on the ocean blue of Castiel’s eyes.  He pressed down, and the first bulb slipped in easily, innocently.  Cas squatted in front of him, naked and beautiful.  Neither of them blinked.  They didn’t touch.  Nothing hurt for the moment as Dean floated and Cas’ eyes pressed his body inevitably lower.  The second bulb slipped in.  It wasn’t much larger, and it sent Dean nothing but gentle pleasure.
“Breathe, alpha,” he instructed, and Cain’s throat rattled painfully as he gulped air. “That’s it. Slow it down. Breathe for me. I’ve got you.”
“Yes, sir.”
“I’m still good for now.  Gettin’ a little relaxed, though.”
The long, awkward breakfast eventually ended, and Cas and April left the suite for the day, leaving Michael and Dean alone with the dishes.  “You want a tour of the grounds?” asked Dean, drying his hands.
“That’s pretty much it, alpha.  Only, we expected Gabe would be with the girl when she came tumbling down the slide, but he wasn’t.  We waited as long as we could, but then we had to scoot.  He’s okay, right?  They didn’t tar and feather him?”
That word. Sir. It had a place. It had a critical and defined place, and it wasn’t supposed to be in play here. Not here and not now, and she knew it.
Dean frowned at him then decided.  “Stick with me today, babe.  I’m gonna get antsy the closer we get to tonight’s big do.  I may need you.  You can come with me to witness Meg’s Mating.  That’ll be fun, right?”
Hope you enjoy.
“It doesn’t really matter what she thinks…”
“I remember that…” Michael said with confusion on his face, still not getting it.
“Yep, kiddo, he sure did. Hey, sit up, Ace. Leave Daddy’s butt alone.”
“Like I did with you.”
“We play them for our own ends, you see; Cas, Sam, and I.  We decided years ago to see if we could really help the cause by using the media as an outlet, so we get up in front of the cameras and play our roles.  We’ve always just let them make us into whatever they wanted as long as it was working to bring a spotlight to how screwed wolves were in mainstream America.  It worked better than we dreamed, so we kept at it.  Sam and me, we play the rockstar sex gods.  Cas is the hot professor.  Everybody has a role to play, and it never hurt anyone until now.  Baby, we never meant for you or April to get caught up in any of the frenzy bullshit, but I don’t think we can stop it now.  I know you never asked for this.  Michael, I don’t know what to say to make you feel better.  You don’t have to do anything you can’t or be anybody you’re not.  You don’t have to be in the spotlight much, but they’re going to want to meet you.  There will be cameras at the Broadway premiere.”
“Right.  Of course.  We’re finalizing the new Facility sites.”
“Ellen, I’m sorry, I respect you and your work,” said Dean with his eyes still boring into Castiel’s.  “But this is bullshit.  No.  No way.  Fuck that.  I’m the Bridge, or he doesn’t fucking take the test!”
asking.  I’m not that guy.  I made you a fucking promise!  And I…”
“Don’t let him fuck you bare, please.  He’s fertile, and I don’t want to take any chances while you’re in Heat.  I’m too tired at the moment…” Cas cast his eye into the room before him.  Kali lay propped against the headboard, naked with Gabriel’s head buried in her crotch and both of her legs spread obscenely wide.  Dean knelt behind Gabe, sweating and grunting into his work.  He seemed not to have noticed his audience, lost to the feel of Omega.  “…but I can feel that you’re ready to go again.”  Cas looked back down at his mate.  “Only if you want to of course, Kitten.  You don’t have to.  We can try the vibrator again.”
He breathed deeply, grounding his feet, clenching his fingers into the soft cushion.  “Is it?” he asked softly.  He felt achingly sad suddenly.  What the fuck was wrong with him, and when had he become so very lost?
Cas didn’t answer him right away. He had known Dean would be angry. Dean had good reason.
“Jesus Christ, Dean, you smell pregnant!” protested Sam in the elevator.  Dean smiled with all the smugness he could manage before he paled, remembering that he would never get a chance to tease Sam back in the same way.
“Salmon spend a lot of time and energy on sex, too,” Jim reminded her.  “Well, on reproduction anyway.  April, you’re young.  Maybe you haven’t had a chance to look back at what we used to be, back before we decided to go modern.  There are still small Lupin communities sprinkled here and there in the wilderness who follow the old ways.  They don’t have cellphones or sleek spanking benches, and they spend far less time than we do thinking about their own balance.  They don’t have charts and graphs and rating scores.  They do it all by instinct.  Somehow, they listen to each other, scent each other, and get it right.  Everyone has a place.  Everyone gets fed.  It’s not unnatural until you try to put it in pants and a tie.”
Portia trotted up to Sam’s knee and nosed at J.T.’s hand until the pup wriggled free to play with the dog.  April slipped her shirt up over her head, baring her nursing bra, and enticed Emma and Jimmy with their favorite targets.  Michael followed suit, silencing Alex for the moment.  Hank watched, mesmerized at Michael’s knee, stroking Alex’s hair in a soothing, nurturing mimicry of a parent.  Kat ignored everyone to sulk with her face hidden in the corner of a sofa, chewing on the end of her sleeve.
“Can’t we just send a family photo?” asked Gabe.  “Why does she have to come here?”
Michael nodded, and Sam helped him stand. Standing together shifted their dynamic back to a more equal footing. Sam held Michael’s shoulders and looked into his eyes. “You’re going to be great for my brother. I’m so happy for you both.” Ignoring Michael’s nudity, Sam pulled him into a tight hug, then released him to get dressed and went looking for his breakfast.
“Ah.  A light topic, then,” observed Dean.  “I thought your head would be all about how to crush Crowley.”
Someone near Dean grumbled, “When are there not policy changes?”
Ketch shrugged.  “Jo’s got her own sperm, Jack.  You’re not even that important.  You’re just here for the heavy lifting.”
“Yes, sir,” she said submissively.
Dean had Michael in stitches with an imitation of their Alpha that was so grotesquely rude and at the same time so aptly perfect that he seemed to be channeling a caricature of the lead dog.
“But…?”
“No, more like what Billie does for Cas. Kind of an
Michael caught sight of Rachel out of the corner of his eye again when he heard her squeal in delight and saw her thrash wildly in her booth seat.  Mister-brown-eyes had obviously found the ticklish spot and latched on.  From his place at the bar, Michael could see that her pencil-skirt was pushed up above her hips, and the tight line at her knees could only be panties.  Her face was flushed in pleasure.  Seeing his sister in capable hands, Michael checked one standard worry off his list and went back to the matter before him.
“Dean’s trying to protect April, and you’re protecting Dean.  Is Sam going to step in next and try to save your skin?  At what point would each of you take responsibility for yourselves if I allowed you to step in front of the strap for each other?”  Cas faced Michael squarely, and it was a question Michael couldn’t answer.  “You’re wasting my time, Michael.  I thought you had something relevant to tell me.  This?  This is just a deflection.  I won’t be played by my Subs conspiring behind my back.  I’ve worked very hard to get April where I wanted her, and he’s just casually stepped in and fucked up months of work.  That’s not okay with me, Michael, no matter what drove him to do it.”
Cas sighed.  “You’re right.  I hate it, but you’re right.”
“We won’t even take a bath together.  He won’t warm my bed or my body in any way for the next two weeks.  I retain the right to kiss him, but that’s it.”
Jo stared into her glass for several beats before looking up with a hopeless, lost look.  She seemed resigned to the fact that countering the Alpha’s wishes was a pointless endeavor.  “What the hell!  My heart got set on the wrong guy too long ago to fix it now.  What is it with those two, anyway?  They’re like spiders sitting in their stupid webs waiting for hapless saps to get stuck in the sticky, only for the two to look ‘em over and say, ‘Hmm, no thanks’.  We oughtta form a lonely-hearts club for Winchester rejects.”
The audience broke into boisterous applause.  Yep, thought Dean, this is awesome.
“Please continue,” Cas told Bobby.
“Well…I mean…there’s TWO inside spots, man.  Here, kid, swap with me.”
“I don’t understand the session schedule,” Sarah said, coming alongside Sam with no preamble.  He jumped a little.  “If the session just started, how is that Ozzie in red already?  The list you gave me says red is for week eleven.”
Cas ran a hand over the back of his neck and stood to cross in front of his desk and settle his weight there.  Better if he started it off.  Right?
Dean cleared his throat.  “To keep them from getting hurt,” he muttered.
“It’s
Thanks to Jennyfly for the collage.  Thanks to Andi4 for the peptalk.
“My promises are not lip service,” Cas protested.  “I could only work with what I knew.  Yes, I was disappointed at how shallow my mate seemed to be sometimes.  I struggled with the impulse to try to make her more than that, but that would have been wrong.  We are who we are.  But then, every now and then I saw a flash of something more.  She always buried it again so swiftly and so thoroughly that I doubted what I’d seen.  When she plays her piano.  When she composes.  She’s breathtaking.  There are no words, Dean.  When she stands in my bindings and screams beneath my lash, she’s…astounding.  I knew there was something there, but I thought it was all Tertiary.  For her to lock me on the outside and let Michael into that, it hurts worse than I can bear.”
“Maybe I just don’t know it yet.  Give me a chance, alpha.”  Michael smiled at him, crinkling his eyes.  “You ready?  We need to get going.”  Michael glanced at the clock, and Dean followed his eyes.
He snorted without looking at her. “Many things,” he admitted.
***************
“Nnnngh!”  Michael responded and wrapped his arms around his mate.  They stayed that way for several breaths.  Then Dean spoke, his face close to Michael’s bleeding bite and the smell of blood cloying in his nostrils.
“Seriously, is he on drugs?” Michael asked Cas.
He turned to Pamela.  “Pam, I’m putting you in charge.  Rufus will second, and you’re both to watch over and guide Cole when he needs you to.  I trust you both, and I expect regular reports on the progress you’re making.  Let us know what resources you need.  We’ll find the funds if we have to hold a bake sale to pay for what you need.  Fixing Dallas is our highest priority.”
“The Alpha’s expecting us at the big house in twenty minutes. Get out and get dressed. I’m not waiting for you if you dawdle.”
“Yes, disturbing.  You know they are or you wouldn’t lock Primates out.  That’s what we’re talking about, isn’t it?  We’re talking about hierarchical and training uses of sexual penetration?”
“Discuss what with Dean?” Dean prompted once it was clear the Alpha wasn’t planning to share.  Cas didn’t answer him right away.  When he did speak, it wasn’t to Dean.
April came back in, glowing, holding the fluffball up under her chin.  “Look at her, Michael!  She’s so sweet.  Here, smell her paw!  It smells like cornflakes.”
“I didn’t ask if it was wise, Dean. I asked what you would’ve done. Let’s dispense with the false notion that you would have been as frightened if I had been in Michael’s place. We both know better. I’m asking about you. Would you have tucked into a safe place and waited for the police to mount a rescue? They had her by the hair up in front of a mob whose communal self-control was waning rapidly. I’m not saying Michael’s actions are justifiable. I’m saying he likely couldn’t have helped himself any more than you or I would have done.”
“What if I think he needs one thing, but I’m wrong, and I hurt him?  What if he needs comfort and warmth from me right now, and I’ve cut him off and left him alone to suffer?  What if he needs unconditional acceptance?”  Michael plopped down into a chair near Hannah’s and rubbed his hands over his face.  “I don’t have any idea what I’m doing.”
“But you don’t,” Sarah concluded.
“That’s likely true,” he told her.  “But most of the people you know are Primates.”
“You went too easy on me,” Dean admitted. “Times like that, you need to fucking tear me a new one. Keep wailing on me until I break. You’ll know when I get there because I get really small in my head.” Dean closed his eyes and pressed his hips back into the touch.
“Everyone’s got demons, Babe. You don’t hold a corner on the market of personal anguish. You think it matters whether we ‘deserve’ each other or not? What the fuck does that even mean? God, all I ask of you is that you try, man. Just try. Try to stick it out with me. Try to raise a family. Don’t leave and don’t give up. Help me stay balanced. Play with me. Fight with me. That’s all. That’s all I ask. You don’t even have to love me if you don’t love me. Is that too much to ask?”
“And what’s that, Omega?” asked Cas as if he were merely preparing dinner, not thrusting his whole fucking hand into the man of his dreams, a man whose body wasn’t supposed to be built to take it, but most decidedly
Michael rested his knuckles against his lips, and he frowned in thought.  “I don’t understand.  What do you mean, ‘lose everything’?”
“No,” Cas defended, resolute. “No, we’re not. He needs to learn to control this exquisite gift for defensive – only for defensive – purposes. Exercising ‘The Voice’ is an exhausting experience. Michael will likely be woozy for the next couple of days. Dean, please believe me, I’m not planning use him as a weapon, quite the opposite, in fact.”
“Sweet Jesus, Dean. That smells delicious. You’re turning into a fine cook,” John gushed, helping himself to perhaps more than he needed from a healthy eating perspective. Truth be told, he would’ve complimented anyone who put food in front of him this morning. He was starving. But it did smell good, and he really was proud of his son. Dean tried to take the compliment coolly, thinking himself too old for such outright praise, but he couldn’t hide his eyes from his father. John tousled his hair and served Sammy’s plate too.
“You know how angry I am, right?”
Dean followed his Alpha’s lead into the bathroom and found a tub full of steaming water, rose petals floating on the surface, lit candles everywhere.  He looked around, taking in the overt romance.  It was unlike Castiel.  It was unlike anything Dean had ever experienced.  He thought back over the years and realized he’d never known romance directly.  He’d spent his entire adult life scening and working.  Sex was for fun and recreation, for balance and stability, for claiming a place in the hierarchy of the pack, for putting another wolf in their place.  He’d partnered with the Alpha, but he’d never in his life made love with him, not out in the open like this.  Dean had a few shame-filled memories stashed away inside his head of moments when he’d allowed his adoration of this man to turn what Castiel gave him for balancing purposes into something decidedly less businesslike – purely in his own head, of course, and kept secret for all those years.
“I’ll trade you,” said Michael snippily.
“Hey.  Alpha.  Chill, man.  This is me.  You can say anything in the world you need to say to me.  But don’t you dare let your mate hear you talk like that.  We all know Omegas are different.  But you said it yourself, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.  Buddy, you’ve got a possessive mastiff stuck in your gob the size of Rigel, and you need to worry about that before you start putting shackles on April or Michael.  Cas, that man hasn’t done anything to hurt you.  He’s Omega, damnit.  He
He had never had a struggle like this, but then, she’d never opened up that wide before.  Ozzies paid a price for every act of rebellious will, and it was beginning to look like April’s was going to be a steep one.  Cas hardened his palm still further, and released his wolf to snarl and growl into her headspace.  He felt her breathing quicken, and inside her mind, he saw her spark back to life just as another miserable sound escaped her throat, and she Released what little she had to give.
“Not an Omega,” he reminded her, adjusting the way his cock sat inside his jeans. She rolled her eyes. Alpha size didn’t do anything for Kali, and she’d seen her share of posturing. She shook her head at him and waved as he pushed through the gold curtain.
God help him, he wanted the pain of a powerful strike against his flesh that sent adrenalin coursing through his veins and setting him alight.
Michael looked away.  “I can’t go into a Dom class like this,” he worried aloud.  “I’m caught in my Secondary.  I feel stuck there.  They’ll eat me alive.  I want to go back to a one-on-one with Joshua.  Or better yet, skip it until we get back from P…”
“You’re mixing metaphors, moron.”
“Hands on the back of your head.”
“If the appropriate authority to Dominate or Claim is not present, and if the submissive isn’t capable of rolling, there’s no connection.  And in this case, when I say submissive, I really mean whoever’s the Bottom at the time.  Depending upon the relationship, Tops and Bottoms can and do switch when appropriate.  In our facilities, we monitor all testing and training interactions closely for signs of distress hormone from the Bottoms.  Everyone receives assertiveness and self-defense training so we can keep one another safe.  Omegas and Subs are trained that they have full agency over their own willingness when it comes to Tops who don’t have authority over them.
Tuesday, February 14, 2017
In the months since the wedding, April’s fledgling relationship with Michael had stalled.  They were an established couple, as far as such a label could go under the circumstances, but they weren’t forging any new steps forward.  Michael felt more like a babysitter than a boyfriend, and April seemed content to allow things to settle comfortably.  It had become commonly accepted that all the spare moments when Dean was holed up behind closed doors with Cas were free moments for April to spend with Michael.  They were sleeping together.  They talked and comforted each other.  They worked seamlessly to care for Alex and the twins when Sam and Jess needed help.
Fred’s perfunctory hug calmed the Omega. “No matter, no matter. We shall right this ship in no time.”
“Alpha,” Dean groaned, shifting a bit.  “I can’t.”
“Sir?”
“I don’t need your protection.  I can look after myself.”
the stilettos, and Amazonian with them.  He nearly smothered Cas, shrieking the whole time, and Cas emerged rumpled and laughing.
“We’ll talk to him together. I’m not going to allow you to take more than your body can handle, even if you are the world’s biggest brat. We’ll figure it out. Corporal punishment isn’t the only option.”
Ruby misinterpreted the outward manifestation of Dean’s inner turmoil—or at least she pretended to. A sobbing Sub was a Sub well-spanked. “I may hit like a beta, kiddo, but you cry like a little girl. And hard-hitting or not, I turned your backside practically glowing, soooo, once I hear the three little words I’m looking for, Deano, we’ll be done here.”
“Thanks, Isaac.  Is my brother around?”
“Not yet,” said Castiel with reluctance. “Not to fuck. But you can tongue him if you want. He loves rimming.”
“Good.  Now.  Since I know it’s eating at you, I will tell you that I had an intense training session with my wolf today.  It has left me weary and sore, and I have no interest in going any further into it than that.  Does that satisfy your concern?”
Rodrick nodded, watching the orgy build around him, unaffected. “Not until October. He lucked out on that front. We got time. He’s my oldest. Apple of my eye, and all that. Wanna do right by the kid. I’ve got folks back in the Pack telling me to do it by the old ways, let the Pack take care of him when his Heat hits. But you folks make sense to me, and I’m going to give you a chance. If this contract scene sets his feet back on the ground and his Keller test don’t knock him for a loop, I’ll give that Omega Services beta – Jack – a chance to talk me through the rest. That right there…” Rodrick nodded toward the mat where Erich’s head fell back, and his fists clenched at his sides. “That’s a good start. Kid needs to learn what his body can do. But it doesn’t get him through the hard stuff.”
When Dean finally spoke, it was in a much smaller voice—not simply quieter, but smaller. “It’s not you who’s not worth it, Cas. I don’t deserve to be here. I never did.”
“No, I’m really not.  Can we make it short?”
“No, sir,” replied Michael, growing tired of being sidelined. “Should I do that?”
Dean and Castiel were still asleep at two o’clock that afternoon.  Michael and April were watching television on the couch in their underwear when someone knocked on the suite door.  They played a quick and dirty game of
“Only those that I didn’t talk to you about fir…  Oh.”
“That’s why you need the training, Michael. You shouldn’t take that shit from me. There are other ways to deal with it besides arguing and fighting. Doms shouldn’t argue with a brat. Joshua’s going to teach you all kinds of tricks that’ll set me back on my heels, but good. I need you to learn them. Can you do that for me?”
Michael lay bonelessly across Dean, centered right at his middle, crushing his hips and his chest. Dean didn’t mind at all. The pressure to his physical body soothed his psychic one, and he dropped his head onto the pillow in exhaustion and satisfaction.
“I’ll have you know, ‘Little Miss Judgy McJudgerton,’ that I was an active member of both my high school and college theater groups, and that I have several lead roles under my belt, thank you very much. Turns out, you
“Does April know you’re here?” asked Sam.
“Okay. You were on edge. I get that. Gabe’s Heats throw wide often enough that that’s not an unfounded fear. You did everything you could to make sure you were available for him.”
He held for a few breaths after he bottomed out, and he re-greased the base of his cock where he could get to it.  It wasn’t going to be enough lube.  The shower was too damp, too humid to keep the slick in place, but he snickered when he felt Dean warning him through the bond not to stop over a simple thing like chafing.  “Or what?” he whispered into Dean’s ear, and Dean smirked over his shoulder, not meeting his eye.
“Kaia did the Tampa raid? You’re sure? Alone?”
“Hey, Kiddo,” he said softly as he approached the bed. He kept a good yard between himself and the Omega, but Kaia just rolled her head sleepily and peered up at him with one eye closed.
“Fantastic,” Dean snarked.  “Now you say it.  Fat lotta good it does me now.”  Dean rubbed himself again in wonder.  Sam really did pack a wallop, 8-year-old pup or not.  Dean couldn’t face him.  He wanted to be pissy and resentful, but he felt light.  He felt a reprieve settle over his shoulders, and he feared Sam would see it if his brother caught sight of his eyes.
