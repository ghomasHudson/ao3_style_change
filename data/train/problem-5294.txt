Sam shook his head and rubbed his temples with one hand. Steve knew what that meant. His mother did that too sometimes when he said something she knew was not just a lie, but absolutely ridiculous. It was like a non-verbal bullshit indicator. Between her and Sam, it was a wonder he tried to lie at all. He really was bad at it.
Steve gave him a tiny smile, just a tilt of his lip and a shy eye, but it was enough to send Tony’s stomach up into his throat. “I already stay here all the time.”
It was quick. Super-soldier quick. A matter of half a second, extricating himself from where he’d sat comfortably pressed against Tony’s side for the last hour.
He was starting to drift.  He could feel it happening, and went with it.  As sleep enfolded him, it wasn’t Thanos he thought of.  It wasn’t Natasha, or Peggy, or Bucky, or even the softness of Tony’s mouth on his.  No, his last conscious thought was of Stormbreaker and that scorching current that galvanized his arm when he touched it.  Could he do it?  Could he possess that much power or would the force of it simply tear him apart from the inside out?  His fingers closed and a phantom voltage tingled through his muscles--inside his muscles, as if it lived there instead of the axe’s haft.
Tony inclined his head until their lips met one more time. “I love you,” he whispered. “I want to be with you. If that means I have to wait five years, or ten years, or whatever, then I’ll wait.”
Tony checked on Steve again, then went out to the garage and worked on the cars for a couple hours.  The inane, sophomoric weatherman was right: it certainly looked like rain.  Big black clouds were piling in on each other, coloring the sky, eating up the blue.
At three o’clock, pretty much on the dot, Tony heard a car in the drive.  Steve was in the shower.  Tony had repaid the favor, getting on his knees right there in the kitchen.  They only had a few minutes, but Steve was easy to push up and over, thank you, Dr. Erskine, and wanted a quick wash before the guests arrived.  Needed one.  They’d been a little careless.
She nodded, her blonde hair glinting in the sun.  It looked pretty.  Steve touched it and she smiled at him.
Tony nodded, those eyes getting even brighter. “Okay,” he said, and resumed touching his face. “But I want to ask you for a favor first.”
Tony snagged the flannel shirt Steve had abandoned on the kitchen chair yesterday morning and tugged it on, then made his way through the house to the glass walkway leading to the garage.  The heat and light in there perked him up even further, and when it opened into the larger space of the garage, Tony was finally able to do this.  The specs were done.  They were tight.  Perfect.  He’d just show them to Ross, have him rubber-stamp them, and get him out before Steve even knew he was here.
“It’s nothing,” Steve said against his shoulder.  “It’s just a couple of stupid classes.  You’re saving the
Sam considered, then nodded.  “I’ll take it.  It’s almost the same thing anyway.”  He raised his hand to the waitress for another round.  Tony shook his head.
Tony nodded and slid his arms around Steve’s waist. He kissed him, and while Steve didn’t think it felt as genuine as usual, he sunk into it all the same. “I’m great, baby,” Tony said, kissing him another few times, tiny, soft kisses that Steve knew were designed just to make him smile. To make him think nothing was wrong.
Steve drug one eye to half-mast. Tony’s skin was silk beneath his cheek, and he really didn’t want to lift his head, so he didn’t. “I’ve been hated by somebody or other for the better part of a century,” he rumbled, kissing Tony’s stomach. “I’m used to it.”
He went back to work, back to the stuff that made him feel older. That wasn’t such a bad thing. He didn’t have
They passed through the different exhibits, stopping longest in a clear underwater tunnel where sea turtles, clownfish, and sharks sailed through the water all around them. Morgan stood with her face planted against the glass while Steve and Tony sat on a bench in the middle of the tunnel.
Tony glanced over at his daughter. “She’s never lived here before. Kind of a new experience. There’s a learning-curve, you know, but we’re getting there.”
Last night had been the worst. Tony had barely slept. He’d twisted and turned, rumpling the sheets, alternating between throwing the blankets off and burrowing underneath them every thirty minutes. He just couldn’t get comfortable. He couldn’t turn his mind off. It felt like something was wrong, something that he couldn’t fix. He wanted to call Steve, but by that time, it was three AM, and Tony didn’t want to wake him up, so he powered through, and finally dropped off around four. He’d never been happier to hear that seven o'clock alarm.
“I didn’t think…” He kissed him again--comfort like a wave--then laughed softly into his mouth. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry I made you feel like you were reading the signals wrong. I’m sorry I didn’t realize
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him.  It was amused, and it pissed Tony off.  “Are you telling me you’ve never smoked before, Stark?”
Tony watched him go, then after he was out of sight, closed his eyes and leaned his head against the upper cabinets, training his ears on Steve’s progress.  He heard the whisper of the chair, the opening of the linen cabinet, Steve’s muttered, “Fuck,” as something fell--Tony smiled at that, indescribably proud of his bad influence--then the cabinet door closing again.
Tony sauntered closer and ran a hand through Steve’s hair.  It was both longer and darker than when they’d met, but it felt wonderfully soft beneath his fingers, like silk.  “I don’t remember that part, at all,” he said, and Steve looked up at him through dark lashes.
, for Christ’s sake--gave Steve a once-over, eyeing him like he was the opposition, an enemy. In a way, Steve supposed he was. He felt his brain taking over again, and he welcomed it. He rejoiced in it.
His phone. Buzzing in his pocket. And now he was more than a little worried. He was suddenly terrified.
They went to the movies. Just like they did almost every Sunday. Steve bought his customary popcorn and frozen Junior Mints. Tony, also customarily, insisted he didn’t want anything, then proceeded to decimate all of Steve’s snacks by the end of the coming attractions. Halfway through, Steve went back out to the lobby and bought another round. Again, that was customary. Once, he had tried buying two boxes first thing and just hanging onto one of them until the first run out, but Tony was pissed. They were no longer frozen, and who the
, throwing darting little glances his way every few seconds. Steve stared back until he finally could take it no more. He stood up and went back to where he’d been sitting with Bucky. He’d left his jacket there, and there it still sat. Nobody would want to steal this old, beat-up thing. He shrugged it on and went outside. He spied Bucky and Nat in the corner on his way out the door. They were dancing too, slow and close, hiding in the shadows, Nat’s arm up around Bucky’s neck, his cheek resting on her hair. They looked good. Happy. Good for them.
The muscle in Steve’s jaw began to work as he ground his teeth together. He didn’t want to say anything. He knew if he said anything, he would lose this battle. He would lose, and Howard would win, and then what would happen to him and Tony? What would happen to their future?
“Baby,” Tony said softly. “You didn’t have to come over tonight. We could have postponed until you felt better.”
They left the building and climbed into Tony’s car. It was a little easier for Steve to get in this time. A little easier to ride beside him even with the prospect of spending the entire afternoon with him hanging over his head. Tony chatted as he drove, just like he did on Saturday, and Steve listened. He liked listening to Tony talk. He liked the way he spoke, and the way his mouth moved. He liked the timber of his voice, the quick, confident way he said whatever was on his mind--nothing like the way Steve himself spoke. He usually mulled things over for a moment before speaking. He liked to weigh his words in his mind before letting them out of his mouth. Tony wasn’t like that. Steve admired that.
“I said--” she began, and then suddenly, amazingly, the pressure was gone.  Tony had squeezed his eyes shut when she grabbed him, and now they flew open.
“I usually sleep on the right,” he said, setting his glass on the bedside table.  “That’s cool, isn’t it?”
Tony lay there, undecided.  He needed to see him.  He had something he needed to say.  It had been building up for a while now.  All the days they had sat together at the breakfast table, all the nights they had sat next to each other in the living room, the television on, a fire in the hearth, the lights dim, the scent of Steve, the
Steve laughed softly and squeezed him one more time. “No. You don’t. I’ll bet you wish you did sometimes, but you don’t.”
Steve took another step back.  His back was pressed against the wall now.  It really was a tiny room.  “Yeah, but I can’t jerk you off and talk at the same time.”
“Don’t do that, please.  They told me you were humble, but don’t do that.  I know what I know.  You’re a hero, Captain Rogers.  And after I put my girls to bed, I go down on my knees and thank God for you.  Every single night.”
“Can I come in?” he asked again.  “FRIDAY said you’re pretty upset.  I think you’ve got her worried.”  He laughed shakily.  “You’re worrying me too, baby, I’m not gonna lie.”
Tony folded Steve’s letter and slid it back into the envelope he’d put it in, and set it on the nightstand.  He put his tablet next to it, and switched off his lamp.
, he thought, watching as Tony reached the ground, and waved up at him again before disappearing inside the building.
He went into town and grabbed the few things he needed at the pharmacy and grocery store. He went to the pet shop and bought a box of those handmade dog treats that Dodger liked but Steve didn’t always buy because he didn’t want to spoil him
Clint pointed, almost imperceptibly, with his pinkie finger while he put another chip into his mouth. “Cap,” he said.
Steve nodded again.  His face was still solemn, but some of that bad feeling in the pit of Tony’s stomach went away anyway.  Maybe this would still be alright.  Maybe it wasn’t ruined yet.
“Tony,” he whispered, and there were tears just on the threshold. Held back by only his desire to not be watched by the pretty, friendly receptionist while he cried. Watched, and then talked about after he was gone, because she might not talk about the guy who came in to give Mr. Stark a message, but if the guy
Tony took an envelope out of his pocket and pressed it into Peter’s hand.  “Don’t drop this, kid,” he admonished.
Steve moved over him in a predatory way, muscles flexing like a tiger on the prowl, looking at him like he wanted to crawl inside his skin and devour him from the inside out. “I didn’t notice,” he said, and kissed him deeply.
And just like that, the bewilderment was gone from Steve’s eyes. The concentration remained, however. In fact, it sharpened. Intensified. Tony saw it happen. Saw the way a cold shroud fell over him, and for a second--the barest of seconds--he was afraid. For that second, it didn’t feel like it was Steve standing in front of him, at all. It felt like someone else. Someone powerful, someone shrewd.
“No. Steve, baby, it was just right.” Tony pulled back and touched Steve’s cheek, brushed over his beard. His eyes were wide, dark, those same bad eyes that Steve had fallen in love with over twenty years ago. Slowly, he slipped one arm up around Steve’s neck and drew him downward until their lips met. It was soft. Sweet. “Thank you.”
dated. Never had a single date in all his twenty-five years. He worked. That’s what he did. He worked. Not dating. Working. That’s what he did. That’s who he was. Who he’d always been. For as long as he could remember. And Tony was...a lot. Sudden. All-encompassing. Like a tornado that had come down from a cloudless sky. The rapidity of it all was...it was scary. Intense and scary. But beautiful. Mesmerizing.
Tony stepped closer and tipped his finger at Steve’s face. “You’re a blusher. It happened earlier too.” He laughed again. There was nothing mean to it. It was friendly and sweet, with a flirtatious lilt to it that made Steve feel a little weak in the knees. “I wasn’t trying to shock you, I just had to see it again.”
Tony stared at Steve’s face, at his body, even thinner than it had been when he’d seen him at Christmas, that old t-shirt hanging on him.  Of course, they wouldn’t be feeding him right.
Tony shifted a little, breathed in, smelling warm leather mixed with Steve’s aftershave.  He cracked an eyelid and looked down.  Steve’s jacket lay over his chest and arms, enveloping him in Steve’s warmth.
Howard nodded, and if Steve was not mistaken, there were tears of his own, hiding down in the depths of his eyes. “Yes,” he said. “Yes. I’d like to. Very much.”
He climbed the stairs slowly. He wanted to sprint up them, but he was too tired. Three weeks of busting ass from dawn until dusk coupled with the last five hours of mind-numbing frustration had sapped the last of his strength. He smiled a little at that. The fact that he wasn’t a kid anymore. The fact that he was well on his way to middle-age. He was okay with that. In fact, he was kind of looking forward to it.
He thought about what Rhodey had said when he'd come down.  Was this the way battered wives felt about their husbands?  Surely, they had to feel something.  It couldn’t all be fear of reprisal, could it?  Didn’t there have to be a love there somewhere?
So, as much as I'd love to write some good, old-fashioned, no-holds-barred smut, it's just not my wheel-house. There's more smoke and mirrors here (or maybe I'm just a tease!) but in either case, just use your imagination for the stuff that's not on the page. I'm sure it'll be awesome!
“I was going to offer to buy you a drink,” the guy said in a slightly lower voice. “But you’ve had three since coming in.”
Steve nodded. “Good,” he sighed, relieved. “That’s good. I was a little nervous about that. You know. ‘Cause...me and him.” He shrugged.
Tony sighed, looking up at him with molten eyes, his mouth quirking into a tiny, pouty smile. “Do you really want me to keep talking right now?” He undid another button, and ground his erection against Steve’s. Steve moaned in the back of his throat, his hands gripping Tony’s hips tightly. “‘Cause I will,” he promised. “If you want. I’ll do it, baby. Whatever you want. I’ll do whatever you want,” he said, kissing him again, his voice filling with need. “Whatever you want, baby. Tell me what you want.”
Tony started typing out a long text filled with angry, pissed-off-monkey words, but halfway through, changed his mind.  He erased it all, typed eight letters, then sat his phone down.
He smiled as he washed his hands at the sink.  That idea was always a good one.  Appealing.  Enticing.  Hot.  They’d done a lot since that first time, using their hands and their mouths to get each other off.  They still hadn’t gotten to the main event, however.  Steve was getting better, stronger every day, and Tony was okay with waiting.  He wanted to be able to fully enjoy it when it did finally happen, without worrying that Steve was in any kind of pain.  And he wanted Steve to enjoy it.  Wanted his first experience to be perfect.  Wanted to build on the beautiful, heady, hot foundation they’d already laid.  Not like Tony’s own first time.  Not like the drunken, alley-way fuck behind a Chinese restaurant in mid-town with some nameless preppie frat-boy who could barely get it in and smelled like beer and Old Spice, panting in Tony’s ear, “You wanted this all night, didn’t you?  Wanted daddy so bad, didn’t you?”
“What about this, though?” Tony asked softly, touching Steve’s chest with delicate fingers. “You said it’s lonely. Don’t you want...this? You never liked hiding before. You hated it. You were so sweet to do it for me, but you hated it. You said it was lying. You-”
Tony was suddenly terrified he was going to mention Howard and Maria.  He didn’t want to hear it.  Not now.  Not after talking about Steve.  It would feel like a step backward.  Tony didn’t want that.  He wanted to leave this on a warmer note.
Tony glanced around the room.  No one was watching them, but he felt flustered.  He didn’t mind being looked at, but the thought of getting a raging erection in such a public setting was...maybe more of a turn-on than he had previously imagined.
Steve leaned into him--would have been lying on top of him if not for the arms of the chairs keeping them separated--and kissed his neck. Tiny, incessant kisses that drove Tony not only to distraction, but almost insane with charmed want, until he could no longer stand it and had to shove him playfully away. He immediately pulled him back, though. He
“Are you sure?” Bruce asked.  “I thought they were being silly worrying so much, but now…” He glanced around the room, looking at the twenty or so half-begun projects, the piles of schematics.  The couch in the corner was covered in a tangle of blankets.  It was the same old black leather couch.  He’d had Jeff drive it up here on his Chevy flat-bed then treated him to a night on the town to say thanks.  The coffee table in front of it, where he’d once sat to bandage a certain super-soldier’s knuckles, was littered with cans of Red Bull and empty coffee mugs.  To his credit, there were a few banana peels and granola bar wrappers, too.  He’d been trying harder lately.  Mostly for FRIDAY’s sake.
Natasha nodded. “Yes. He would.” Tony looked down at his clasped hands, and she huffed a soft laugh and rolled her eyes. “You’d
Steve put it back on the table, tucked the other two away in his box, and carried it back to the doorway. When he got there he kissed Pietro one more time. “I don’t want to forget you either.”
They reached the third floor and stole down the corridor to the second door.  Outside it on the wall facing the door was a large Jackson Pollock.  Its exuberant splatters of blue, green, yellow, and red would be the first thing “Thunderbolt” saw when he opened his door in the morning.  And with the window at the end of the hallway, spilling out its morning light, it would be perfectly lit.  The effect was probably dizzying.
we talk about it later?” Tony asked. “Or are you going to put me off again? ‘Cause I really think we need to.”
“Steve?” he called from the bed, eyes still closed, and listened. Nobody answered, but a second later, he heard a little clicking sound that he couldn’t
Steve kissed him again, held him tighter against his chest.  "You're not the worst," he whispered. "Just don't say that, okay?  Please?"
Jeff shook his head and folded his arms.  “Nope.  And not a thing you can say will make me change my mind.”
Steve rubbed his cheek against the fabric of Tony’s shirt. “You might be surprised,” he said. “Army-grade blankets aren’t the best quality, and when we went on patrols, we weren’t always able to build a fire. Sometimes me and the Howlies ended up sleeping in one big pile just to keep warm. We didn’t call it ‘snuggling’ then, though.” He smiled. “Well, okay, Dugan did, and we always laughed. It was funny, you know? He was big, and kind of...brash, I guess.” Steve laughed fondly at the memory of his friend. “He liked to joke around. They all did.
“‘Kay. Just us, then,” Tony repeated, his hand slipping back down the length of Steve’s tie. He buttoned his jacket over it. Straightened the lapels. “Talking. Or something.”
Steve shrugged, still smiling his shy little smile. “Don’t know,” he said. “I was just thinking...maybe we should think about making that legally binding.”
Howard rose to his feet. His eyes--the same as Tony’s, although neither of them ever acknowledged the fact--turned darker. He swirled the last swallow of his drink in the glass before tossing it back at a gulp. He didn’t sway. The man was a veteran drinker. It would take more than a couple glasses of whiskey to put him off-kilter. He pointed a finger at Tony with the hand still holding his glass. It was a familiar gesture. One Tony had seen a million times since he was a kid. “Don’t talk to me that way, kiddo. I’m still your father, and you’re still living under my roof. You’ll treat me with respect. You got that?”
“I saw a guy through a window of a cafe,” he said. “I just caught a glimpse at first, but something made me stop and look harder.” He sighed. “He was slumped in his seat. Shoulders down. Hair a mess. Sunglasses on. And I thought, ‘God, that guy looks exhausted’.” Steve kissed him again. Just a small one. Sweet. “And it made me...I mean, I felt...connected to him. To that guy. That guy who looked like the whole world was pressing down on him. Like he didn’t have anything to keep him steady. Like he was teetering. Right on the edge of something. Like if he moved just a little, he’d fall over.”
He looked at it, at her, the dark eyes, the pale skin.  Steve remembered seeing her for the first time, the drop in his stomach.  She’d been there when he’d went into Howard’s machine, her voice had been the last good thing he’d heard before he dropped the Valkyrie into the ocean.  He’d been afraid to go see her when he’d heard she was still alive all those years later, but he wouldn’t trade those hours sitting by her bedside for anything.
“And if there are any fringe groups still looking for Clint Barton, you’ll take care of them.  I know there were still a few that were upset with him after what he did during Thanos.”
lot.” She was quiet, and he let her be quiet, let her think. Gave her time to ask questions if she wanted to. Finally, he said, “Is that okay with you? If I like Steve a lot?”
“Okay,” Steve muttered and ran his hands through his hair. His desire for a cigarette was starting to become an intense
of happiness. It was the only thing that made sense. It was beyond him. He would--and did--push it away, run from it, hide from it, sabotage it either knowingly or unknowingly every single time it got close. It was just who he was. It was bred into his DNA. It was part of him. Some people just weren't designed to be happy. They--
Tony looked at the chair to his left. It was empty, but his traitorous mind couldn’t help but fill it with the image of what Steve would look like lying there. He’d be wet. Fresh from the pool. Shirtless. The beads of water on his chest transformed into a kaleidoscope of color. He’d ask Tony if he was cold, and when he said,
Tony rubbed his forehead.  "You smack my head into the car door and you don't even say sorry?  Some welcome home this is."
His hands balled into fists, ready, eager to do this. He was nervous and awkward everywhere but on the battlefield, and right now that was here, right here at this stupid, glitzy party that he’d only attended because Tony had asked. Tony with his eyes, and his laugh, and his ego. Tony.
Tony flung his free hand back behind himself, and at the same time, tightened his grip on Steve with the other. “I just scaled a building for you.”
Tony let out a breath and tried again. “You can’t go outside looking like that, Steven Grant Rogers,” he said. “I’m sorry. It’s not a good idea. You’ll get yourself arrested.”
“Yes.”  She pulled back the covers and Steve climbed into the big bed beside her.  He curled his body around hers and she nestled into the curve of his arm.
“That’s right,” Tony said. He licked the curve of Steve’s ear, his hand finally making its way into Steve’s lap. He gripped him through his jeans gently, but with enough firmness to make Steve moan. Make him really feel it. “You like that, baby?” Tony asked, massaging his cock, the friction through the denim almost unbearably good. “Does that feel good? I want you to feel good. You should always feel good. You should
With that in his head, he drug some sweats and a t-shirt on.  Sleep was over for a while.  He was too tired to change the sheets and not tired enough to sleep in there without changing them.  Thank god for the lab.
He opened up his contacts and found Tony’s name. He smiled a little. It had taken him a minute to find it after Tony typed it in that first night.
“Sh-sh-sh,” Ross soothed gently, lying him back on the cold, damp grass.  “Don’t talk, Stark.  I know that’s not in your nature, but just keep your mouth shut for a minute.”
Tony shifted a little now, and Steve murmured something in his sleep, then was silent again.  Tony wished he knew what was going on inside that head.  He knew what the nightmares were about.  They’d talked about those.  Mostly of him falling, drowning, his heart stopping as the icy waters covered him.  No wonder he hated
“...It was cold.  It was like he was a different person.”  Tony shook his head.  “Whoever it was, it wasn’t
Tony snorted a little and shoved his hands in his back pockets.  He was wearing one of his endless band t-shirts.  Led Zeppelin.  Steve had tried listening to them.  He wasn’t a fan.  “Come on, soldier, spit it out.”
“Nothing,” Steve answered, and he smiled when he saw that Tony understood what he meant. Not actually nothing.
And speaking of that, he needed to shave, and have his mom cut his hair again. It was almost time for his weekend away. And after that, his summer drill.
He chucked his stuff into the bedroom, then went into the bathroom to shower. Standing under the hot spray, he tried hard to not think. He tried to just clear his mind of everything. It was getting a little easier. Even without the help of a drink when he needed it, clearing his mind was getting easier. He still
Steve put his fingers to his lips and twisted them in a locking motion, then mimed throwing the key over his shoulder.
Tony watched them through the rearview mirror, ignoring the little stab of jealousy he felt. He looked at Steve again out of the corner of his eye. It really wasn’t fair. It wasn’t
Steve blinked.  Confusion dimmed his smile but didn’t lessen its charm.  Tony’s heart ached, doing a little double-flip inside his chest.  “What’s wrong with that?” Steve asked.  “We are friends.  Aren’t we?”
Tony was still holding a fold of his sweater, and now he released it just enough to grasp Steve’s wrist in his hand as well. There was fabric between their skin, but Steve could still feel the heat. Still feel the weight of it, light but firm. Insistent. “You always deserved it, Steve,” he said. “Always.”
Steve began to close the distance even more.  “And as per our agreement,” he said dangerously, “you are to stay away from Tony Stark.”
. I’m such a fucking hypocrite. But I wasn’t even thinking about us! I wasn’t-” He groaned in frustration, then touched Steve’s neck, urging him to look at him again. “I don’t really feel that way, baby, okay? It’s just, you and me...we’re...
Steve laughed as they dragged him out of the room.  Tony watched him go, then when he was gone, turned back to the room at large.  Most of the visitors had left, but there were still ten or twelve standing around watching the scene with expressions ranging from shock to humor to outright disgust.  One young mother had her hand over her son’s eyes.
He stared at her, shocked. He’d been prepared to ask. To plead his case. To get down on his knees and fucking
“It wasn’t what I expected,” he said.  “There were so many people.”  He looked up, his face cloudy.  “They all had their phones out, Tony,” he said, distress outlining every word.  “Why would they do that?  Why would they go to see one of the most beautiful things ever created and then belittle it like that?”
Morgan smiled again. And Tony wiped his eyes again. She remembered. God. For some reason, he’d convinced himself she wouldn’t--because why would she? But she did. She did.
It landed on Tony’s neck, right at the base of his throat.  Steve kissed him there sometimes.  Lovingly.  Tenderly.  “Not much of a prize,” Ross said.
Tony laughed under his breath and climbed onto the bed.  He pulled the covers back and got under them.  “Of course, I’m sure.  I’m always sure.  Come here.”
But now a fledgling worry bloomed inside his chest.  They had never specifically discussed sleeping arrangements.  And there was a second-floor loft.  There wasn’t a bed up there, but there were some comfy-looking couches.  Steve couldn’t see them from below, but Tony had told him that.  Exactly that.  “Two comfy-looking couches,” not thinking for a moment that maybe Steve assumed that’s where Tony planned to sleep.
“I promise, Tony,” Steve said, drawing back to look into his eyes again. Tony’s breath hitched in his chest, and Steve cupped his cheek. “Tony. I mean it. I promise.”
Tony put his arms around his neck and pulled him close, burying his head in Steve’s bare shoulder. His own tears were falling now. Steve slipped his arm around Tony’s waist and held him tight. “Doesn’t feel like it’s for the best,” Tony muttered, “It feels like I’m constantly getting kicked in the nuts.”
"Hey," Tony said emphatically.  He shook him a little, and Steve stopped talking and just looked up at him, the question still there, still between them.
Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s, holding him tight with his hand, the other curled into Steve’s denim jacket. “That’s not a promise, baby,” he said. “It’s just a fact. You’re mine. And I’m yours. Forever. Okay?”
Tony laughed under his breath, still holding Steve, his anchor.  His rock.  “You sound pretty sure.  That’s scary, Steve.”
He stepped over the glass and sat on the bench.  He put his head in his hands and stayed that way for a long time.
Steve pulled away.  His eyes were shining, his tears already beginning to fall.  Tony's lips curved up in a tiny, tired, happy smile. Steve took his hand and kissed his wrist again.
Steve clasped his hand tighter and tucked his head down onto Tony’s shoulder. “I kind of liked everything you just said,” he murmured, paused, then said, “well, except for the Bucky stuff. I should have taken that to the grave.”
Tony held out his hand. “He’s a prince,” he said, as she put the cup into it. He sat up and sipped. It was hot, black, sweet. Perfect. He groaned. “Never mind,” he said. “I meant he’s a
he frowned on them, although Steve remembered a time when he had thought it was sexy. A long time ago now. He still kind of missed smoking. But that was okay. He’d rather have a happy Tony than a cigarette any day.
Steve let his head fall to the side in amused exasperation.  His eyes were still closed, but he smiled.  “Okay.  Say it.”
They didn’t gamble.  Instead, Tony rented out the casino’s bowling alley for the entire time they were there.  They drank, ate, and bowled.  All day, for three days.  He called Steve both nights they were gone, and slowly jerked off to the sweet river of filth that flowed from the phone into his ear.  And then called him again in the morning for a repeat performance.
“Pretty baby,” Tony murmured, then pressed on his shoulder. “Lie down for me, huh? Let’s get you comfortable.”
angry. He could feel it simmering inside his head, and he knew if this was any other day, any other time, he’d be jumping to his feet right now, yelling at him, asking him how
Tony laughed a little, and Steve’s heart decided it wasn’t going to seize up and kill him.  At least not yet. “Why are
This time, the laughter was definite.  “Okay,” Steve warned.  “But no bitching about a sore back later.”
The door opened, but instead of bureaucratic, government-issue dress shoes, plain old Nikes came into view.
Steve watched him from across the room.  Watched and listened with a little smile playing around his mouth.  Tony would get what he wanted, Steve knew that, because Tony always got what he wanted.  All he had to do was turn on his charm, speak in a certain tone of voice, laugh a certain way.  Steve almost felt sorry for the guy on the phone because Steve knew he had absolutely no chance against Tony.  He was just glad the guy wasn’t here in the room.  One look in Tony’s eyes, one glimpse of that smile, that tiny tilt of his head, and he’d be begging to do Tony Stark’s bidding.  He’d be all but licking Tony’s palm.
“‘For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction’,” Steve recited, and in spite of the pity he was feeling in his heart for this man, he couldn’t help the thrill of satisfaction he also felt when Howard’s eyes widened minutely. “Yeah,” Steve said, as if agreeing. “I know what it means.”
After at least a month of driving, Tony finally pulled up in front of Steve’s apartment. Tony turned off the ignition, and they both just sat in their seats, not moving, not looking at each other. An undercurrent of something hot and electric hung in the air between them, and when Steve put his hand over Tony’s, he jumped.
Tony stretched in his lounge chair, shivering just the tiniest bit. He’d gotten out of the pool an hour ago after he and Happy had lost--rather unfairly, he thought--to Clint and Nat in a chicken fight, and had been sitting there ever since.
Steve bent his head and put his mouth against Tony’s ear, ready to tell him all kinds of things, but before he could, a heavy weight thumped against his back.  He jolted on his feet at the sudden hiss in his ear and the claws on--
going to get old,” he said.  "The serum, it isn’t going to keep me alive forever.  I’m going to die someday.”
The waitress brought him coffee and he dumped sugar into it.  “‘Untoward’?” he repeated, raising an eyebrow.  “That sounds very unsavory, Doc.  Do you think you can handle it?”
“Make me forget,” Tony murmured, hands clenching into Steve’s hair as he trailed wet, open-mouthed kisses down Tony’s torso. “I don’t want to think about anything but you. Make me forget everything else.”
Steve sat on the leather sofa against the wall and Tony perched on the coffee table in front of him.  He took bandages out of the kit.  “Let me see.”
At last, Clint released Nat, and she stepped forward.  Bruce held out his hand, and she left Steve and Clint to stand next to him without looking back.
I've got this pretty well mapped out, but I never know for absolute certain what's going to happen in my stories until it's down on the metaphorical paper. I thought Bucky was going to show up here, and yay! He did!
Steve laughed. “Really? I get the front door and you get the nice, soft bed? Wow, Tony. You’re a real charmer.”
had gone by, but they didn't have to.  They both knew. They knew what the other meant when it happened.  They knew that they were "celebrating". Maybe it was never on the same day, or even the same time of year, but what did that matter?  It wasn't the day that deserved celebration--it was what it meant. They were together. They were in love. And that was worth celebrating more than once a year.
She wiped lipstick off his cheek with her thumb.  It was a friendly gesture.  It made him want to cry again.
Steve didn’t look up. He was frowning over something on his computer. He typed some numbers into a calculator, frowned harder, then typed again.
Tony moved to Ross’ bedside, and Wanda eased herself over to the other where his wife laid down each night.  Tony took a deep breath, met Wanda’s eye, then said, “Thad.  Wake up.”
Nat laughed and took hold of Steve’s arm, tugging him a little.  “Come on.  I think it’s time to retreat, Captain.”
“Baby,” Tony said again, but this time there was a dark urgency behind the word, and when Steve lifted his head to look at him, Tony captured his mouth in a long, searing kiss. His tongue delved into those sweet depths, seeking out Steve’s and worshipping it with his own.
Tony put the razor down.  The whole conversation seemed charged with another meaning he had not been aware of until just this moment.  “Maybe you’re right,” he said.  “Maybe we don’t have to do this tonight.”
“You are not worthless,” Steve said.  “You’re amazing.  You’re perfect.  You are the kindest, most generous person I have ever met, and if I ever, for even one second, made you think differently, then I really do deserve to be hit with a full blast.”
Tony laughed.  He wasn’t mad.  Had never really been mad.  How could anyone be mad at Steve?  How could anyone be mad at the one good thing in their life?  The one pure thing, the one thing that made their entire existence worthwhile?
written on them in either his mother’s or Tony’s handwriting in black Sharpie. Others were still in the process of being filled. He saw a bunch of his clothes stuffed into one of them. A bunch of papers in another. It all seemed a little haphazard to Steve, who would have done things differently, going methodically room by room and stacking things neatly one box at a time, but this, this whirlwind of activity made him happy. It was Tony’s way. All Tony. And the thought of that, of Tony doing all this just so they could be together, filled him with a peace he had never thought he would be capable of finding.
Tony refused to take the bait.  Because this was what Ross did.  How he operated.  He got inside a person’s head and exploited any weakness he could find.  The proof was right there still hovering in the air next to Tony--Baxter’s files continuously scrolling.
“No,” Tony said, sharply.  “No, no, don’t do that, guys.  Please.”  He took one of Bruce’s hands and one of Natasha’s.  “You can’t do that.  You can’t fight.  Not you two.”  He took their hands and brought them together, then looked sternly at Bruce.  “Say you’re sorry.”
She shrugged one shoulder--a very Tony-like shrug--and looked down at the floor. He stood up, taking her hand. “Come here,” he said. “I want you to meet somebody.”
Tony lay on his side, his head pillowed on Steve’s firm bicep. Steve’s other arm was around him, holding him tight to his chest. Tony could feel his breath against the back of his neck, feel his heat, the angular planes of his body that were so different from Pepper’s lean curves. He could hear a clock ticking, the sound of Steve’s easy respiration, and that was all.
Steve grinned, looking down at his shoes. Behind him, one of the servers shouted, “Rogers! Still on break, or what?”
Steve lowered his head gently against Tony’s, marveling at the soft feeling of his hair against his cheek. “Your father will change his mind,” he said. “I’m sure he will.”
Sir Purr spent the evening trying very hard to stay out of the clutches of the gaggle of Barton children who had all decided he was far too snuggly to be allowed to walk around on his own.  He hid under tables, chairs, and even climbed a tree once before finally giving in and just resigning himself to a night of being petted and packed by Clint’s kids.
“Knock it off,” Tony said lightly.  “I told you before, baby, it’s you and me.  Okay?  It’s always going to be you and me.”  Tony nudged Steve’s ankle strategically under the table.  “So quit trying to make me change my mind.  Right?  Seems like I've told you this before."
Strange stopped them in the hallway and leaned against the wall.  He looked weary, bags under his eyes, face drawn and pale. Steve would have felt bad for him, but his great reserves of patience were starting to run dry.  He was holding on--just barely--because he had to. He had to hold on to his control, his stoic, almost icy demeanor, because if he didn't, he would simply run mad.  He couldn't do that. Tony needed him to stay calm. Tony needed him to stay strong, and so he did, even though all of mind, body, and soul was shrieking behind that extremely thin veneer of cool calm he had affected.
Tony sat up, straddling Steve’s thigh, giving them both something to rub against while he undid the buttons of his shirt. “Everything in life should be so easy,” he said, looking at Steve with lust-laced eyes. He ran his hands across his chest, flicking nipples that were hard and sensitive now from his own mouth. Steve moaned, eyelids fluttering, head thrown back. He was as beautiful like this as Tony had dreamed, and he couldn’t wait to see what he looked like when he came apart completely. How he’d look laid out on his pillows afterward. “Tell me again,” he said, as he tossed his shirt aside. “Tell me how much you need me.”
Thanks for reading! I will try and get the next chapter up next week. I'm just writing it now, so wish me luck!
It didn’t hurt at first.  At first, he had only felt an impact, and he thought maybe Ross had socked him in the gut.  “What the-” he began, then the burning, searing pain, engulfed his midsection, and he felt his knees buckle.  Tony sagged, and Ross caught him, caught him and eased him down onto the ground.
Steve pulled it over his head and threw it away.  His t-shirt went with it, and he stood in front of Tony, naked from the waist up.  Bare, with no covering, Tony could finally see just how skinny he’d gotten.  The muscle was still mostly there, but there was no spare skin, no spare anything, at all.  It hurt Tony’s heart, seeing him like that, and all he could think of was Strange telling him Steve had gained some of the weight
The arms holding him loosened, and Tony clenched his eyes tightly shut. “You really love her,” he said quietly.
Steve turned to him. Tony wasn’t crying, but his face was very pale. His eyes even darker in the gloom. “I’m not going to stop loving you either,” Steve said. His lip was trembling. He had always been the more emotional of the two of them. Tony could keep it in check. Steve never could. But he tried. Right now, he tried very hard. “I’ll always love you. I’ll love you forever.” He knew he shouldn’t--fucking
But he was asleep.  Tony ran his fingers through the tuft of blond hair that stuck out from under the blanket, wondering what the hell Steve had ever done without him, wondering who would take care of him if Tony wasn’t around to do it.  He went back to bed feeling cold, himself.  The idea was too frightening.
Also, this is another long one, and everything after the phone call is the result of a marathon 10-hour writing binge before I go back to work tomorrow after three days of being flat-on-my-back sick. If there are typos, I hope they're not too offensive.
Morgan looked up as he sat down on the couch. “Hi, Grandpa Howard,” she said casually, then jumped up to tug on Steve’s hand. “Stee-eeve! Come color!”
“And I know what you mean,” he went on.  “Doctors.  Hospitals.  Asylums.  That’s what you do with crazy people, isn’t it?  First, you have them ‘talk to someone’, then you ‘put them somewhere’, then you forget them.  I’d rather die.”
They stepped out into the summer afternoon and Nat stood between them.  Steve and Clint, her two best friends.  The man she’d loved the longest, and the one she’d loved the most fiercely.  She took their arms and held them both tightly, her eyes finding those of the man she loved most at the end of the aisle.
Tony’s heart stopped, then skipped ahead, almost missing a beat.  He laughed helplessly.  “Did you just say what I think you just said?”
Tony sat up and ran a hand through his hair.  Regret was not a cure for desire, but they didn’t mix well either.  It was like oil and water coursing through his veins.  “Steve,” he said.  “Wait.  Don’t go.”
“The army laid some kind of claim on him when they found out.  They said Steve was their material way before he was an Avenger, so he belonged to them.”
“Oh, yes he can,” Ross said.  Victory was writ large on his face.  The White Whale, at last.  “Fury, arrange for transport immediately, please.”
to come over. I wanted to see you. See both of you. And I really am okay now.” He hoped it was true. He could usually work through these things in a day or two, but sometimes they intensified. Sometimes they got worse before they got better.
Part of Steve’s mind had still been in the hallway concentrating on that salad, wondering if the romaine was crunchy, thinking about how those cherry tomatoes would pop when he bit down on them, and that bacon, that smoky, meaty, crispy bacon.  But now, he was all here.  All present.  He frowned.
Steve shoved Tony out of the way and lashed out at Ross.  The sound of his fist connecting with Ross’ face was both meaty and sharp.  The crunch of his breaking nose was extremely loud.
Tony didn’t say anything. He couldn’t. It was everything he wanted to hear. Everything he had always needed. Everything he’d always wanted, and nothing he could ever have, so he didn’t say anything. He just came closer, slipped his arms tighter around Steve’s waist, burrowed his head deeper into his chest, silent, just holding him, just listening.
“I did,” she said, and pulled back to look up into his eyes. “And now I’m thanking you. You introduced us. Remember? That night?”
Steve sent his fist out one last time hard, pulling it only a little at the last second so it wouldn’t break the bag and send it flying in a storm of sand, then he turned around.
it. And...that means, I’ll be in hers too. And I want her to like me. I want her to-” he sighed, “-be comfortable with me. And I want
He couldn’t stop the tears from falling. He’d been able to stop them with his mother. He’d been able to stop them with Sam, but not here. Not now. Not with Tony. He couldn’t stop them. He couldn’t stop the way he curled into himself even as he stood in Tony’s plush office, either. He was tired. Hurt. Sick with worry and fear and loneliness.
Bruce had never looked happier, Tony thought, and if he could look like that while the woman he loved was in the arms of another man, then Tony certainly couldn’t feel upset about it.  Especially when Steve caught his eye and winked.
Howard nodded a bit. He was holding his own cup of coffee, and he gestured to the table with it. “May I join you?”
So, instead, Steve applied his tried and true method of dealing with Tony: he ignored him.  He brushed past him and went to the armoire where they kept a bunch of DVDs and started going through them.
Tony reached out and grabbed the arm of Steve’s sweater. His fingers curled into the soft weave and held on, his eyes were darker now, but Steve couldn’t read what was in them. He was afraid he might have lost the knack for that too. “Stop talking like that or I’m going to kick your ass,” Tony said.
Tony pulled him back, forcibly breaking the bonds of their linked hands, and then the images were gone.  Tony collapsed back, his arms wrapped around Steve’s chest, holding him while Steve shuddered in his arms.  His eyes rolled back in his head and he whispered nonsensical words under his breath.
Sarah didn’t seem to think it was a stupid question, though. She looked at him seriously, and nodded her head. “Yes. It’s him. He wants to talk to Tony.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “Okay,” he said, then gave Steve a playful shove toward the stairs. “Move, Rogers. I’m trying not to lose my shit, but if she opens the door, it’ll never happen.”
Steve looked around the parking lot. His eyes went directly to Tony’s car. Steve didn’t know much about cars, but he knew it was fancy and expensive. It had probably cost Mr. Stark more than Steve’s parents had paid for their apartment. It was red, with little gold flecks in the paint that caught the sun and made it shimmer. STARK4. That’s what the license plate said. Steve assumed that meant there were three other ones out there somewhere. He wondered if there was a STARK5 out there too. There probably was.
Steve sighed, and let his eyes fall closed. He felt guilty now on top of feeling inferior. Ashamed of hurting Tony’s feelings for something he could control no more than Steve could control his own circumstances.
They’d climbed into bed an hour ago.  It had become their routine.  Dinner at seven, a movie or a couple hours of TV after that, then Steve washed the dishes while Tony picked up and took out the trash.  At ten, they’d watch the news.  It was an old-timey thing to do in this day and age when news from every corner of the Earth could be had at any moment with a press of a button or a voice command, but Steve liked it.  He liked the act of sitting on the couch with a can of Coke or a beer by his hand, Tony lying against him, watching the news of the day become the history of the world.  It made him feel better.  Especially on days when he couldn’t stop thinking about the past.  Couldn’t stop remembering Bucky falling, or hearing Peggy’s voice, or feeling the cold water running up over his legs, his torso, his shoulders, his mouth--
“So, maybe we build an addition on.  Another bathroom, a couple more bedrooms.  We’ve got plenty of time.”
Tony backed toward the bed, tugging Steve with him by the hand.  “We don’t have to do anything,” he said.  “Just lay here with me.  Okay?  Come on, just lie down.  Just-Just be here.  Okay?”
“Nat and Bruce want to come up sometime,” he said, soaking in that look like a sponge.  “But I told them we might need a little while.”
“What were you saying about not knowing any words? That was prettier than even Keats, baby,” Tony whispered, and in one smooth motion, pulled the fabric away, and leaned in to take Steve’s cock into his mouth.
Tony hugged him impulsively--compulsively--as tight as he could. “Yeah,” he said. “It is.” He pulled out of Steve’s arms just enough to look at him with one eyebrow raised. “About that blow-job, though…”
go--and knowing you’d be back--helped.” He looked up at Steve, his voice a little hesitant. “Will you call her in the morning?” he asked. “Let her know you’re home? I think that would help too.”
Steve lay still, letting his thundering heartbeat slow to something approaching normal. He could hear Tony breathing in his ear. Could hear the sound of him moving on his bed-sheets. “I wish you were here,” Steve said softly. “Or I was there.” He paused, not wanting to go too far, but needing Tony to know how he felt. “I wish I could feel you right now.”
Steve looked back and locked eyes with Tony.  He gripped his hands and held them tight.  “I could show you instead.”
“Don’t worry,” Tony soothed, kissing his spot until Steve sighed.  “I wouldn’t dream of insulting your precious Brooklyn.”
“You bowled a 230,” Jeff said, and glanced darkly at one of the other guys.  “Dave only did a 180.  We’ve got to work on him.”
Tony nearly choked on the laughter that bubbled up in his throat.  “I literally cannot believe you just said that,” he wheezed.  “Where’s Nat?  She’s going to die when she hears this.”  He thumped Steve’s chest in excitement.  “And Clint!  Oh my god, where’s my phone?  I’ve got to text him.”
“True,” Clint said, and Tony blinked at him, surprised but pleased. He hadn’t expected that. “But that’s not what I meant.”
"Good," Tony said. He kissed his cheek. His ear. "Next time is good. 'Cause I just want to be sweet to you this time." He let his hand trail down Steve's chest to his hard cock. He stroked it once, twice, suckled at the soft hollow at the base of his throat. "Is that what you want, baby? Do you want me to be sweet to you?"
“If you want to,” Steve said, and loosened the towel around his waist. “I’ve never done it before, so I don’t really know what to say, but-” he gave his cock one long, hard stroke, “-if you want to,
“Love,” Tony said, smiling a little at him. “You can say it, Rhodey.  We’re past all that toxic-masculinity-I’ve-got-no-feelings bullshit, aren’t we?”
“No, but we’ve both had several birthdays since then. Are you telling me you and that Petrol guy didn’t have birthday-sex?”
“Oh, sweet Jesus,” he muttered. “You-” He stopped. Swallowed, as his eyes raked Steve over. His hair, combed perfectly back, glinted gold in the bright lights. Those eyes, blue and bright, high cheekbones, red lips. His shoulders--those ridiculous shoulders that Tony had never quite been able to fathom even now that he was allowed to touch them whenever he wanted--seemed somehow broader, his waist even trimmer underneath the close-fitting weave of the thin black sweater he had on. Steve’s jeans were dark too, not black, but a dark indigo that hung so easily from his body that Tony thought he put every single model he had ever seen walk the runway--or taken to bed--to shame.
“No, don’t you dare say that,” Tony said, putting his finger over Steve’s lips. “Don’t you dare say it’s not a big deal. It is, baby. It’s a huge deal.”
It was nice knowing he could just leave them to do their work. Nice knowing he didn’t have to be there to hold their hands. Especially when there was someone here who might need a hand to hold on to today.
They hadn’t made love.  They hadn’t done anything but lie together for the longest time after climbing the stairs hand-in-hand.  Tony lay in Steve’s arms, pressed fully against him, chest to chest, hip to hip, with his eyes closed.  After a while, he felt Steve’s breath on his cheek, then his lips, soft and sweet on his mouth.  Tony kissed him back, never pushing, just letting Steve dictate the pace and the pressure.  It didn’t go much further than gentle lips and a soft tongue, but it was perfect.  Absolutely perfect.
"You're not buying me a private island," Steve said. "You're not buying me anything. I have more than I know what to do with right now," he said, and gestured around the room as if it was stuffed with magnificent treasures instead of being filled with a whole lot of nothing.
He’d “borrowed” a car from the Compound, taking the keys and driving away.  He slid into it now and seated the key in the ignition.
Tony sat down at the small table and looked around the room.  Most of the tables were occupied, the prisoners conspicuous in their tan khaki prison jump-suits, blotches of boring against their visitors’ more colorful attire.  Tony hadn’t been sure what to wear, and had settled on jeans and a plain black Henley.  He’d been forced to strip off his watch--a Rolex Daytona that had set him back $75,000--and leave it, his keys to the ‘Cuda, and his wallet at the guard station.  They had then searched him, and asked intimate, probing questions about the arc reactor for twenty minutes before they finally decided it was alright and he could go in.  That made him late.  Thirty damn minutes late.  Tony prayed they had told Steve.  That he didn’t just think Tony had been late on purpose, or worse, that he’d decided not to show.  He couldn’t stand the thought of that.  Of the look on Steve’s face while he waited and waited and no one came.  Tony vowed to write a strongly-worded letter to the prison commissioner about the efficacy of their visitors’ policies.
He pushed that aside. Or as much as he could, anyway. This was important. Not just to him, but to the world, and he thought if anyone could understand that, it would be Steve. But by the time he finished talking with John, made sure he had a cab to his hotel, and drove himself home, Tony was tired and almost insane with anticipation of seeing Steve. Or not seeing him. Depending on whatever it was that Steve wanted.
Steve let out a breath and gazed up at him. He settled his hands on Tony’s hips. “I’ve got everything I want right here.”
“But I didn’t meet you on the street, did I?” Howard asked. “I met you in my son’s bedroom. The two of you looking as guilty and nervous as any two teenage lovers have ever looked.”
Steve stood rigid, swallowed, turned his eyes upward. “That’s not me, Tony,” he said. “It’ll never be me. You and Mom. That...That’s what’s important.”
“Will you turn the music down, FRI?  To fifteen, please.  I still want to hear it, but I guess we shouldn’t drown out poor Brucie-bear, should we?  Especially since he looks like he’s a man on a mission.”
Tony hung his head, laughing under his breath.  He knew this one.  This was his category.  It was Final Jeopardy, and he was going to win it all.
She bit her lip, trying not to laugh again.  “No, he didn’t ‘like you for a while’, Tony.  He was in love with you.  For years.”  She bumped his shoulder and repeated emphatically, “
Bucky stared at him, his eyes flicking back and forth between Steve’s, trying to read the truth in them. Finally, he barked out short laughter. “Your reasoning is so fucked up.”
waiting outside his date’s door. That was a new feeling. He’d never gotten nervous before. Not with anyone else. Just Steve. And he liked it. Liked feeling that little flurry of butterfly wings inside his stomach while he waited. It felt good. Strange, but good.
Tony took them and scrutinized the damage.  He peeled gauze off the roll.  “I don’t know why you won’t just let me make you gauntlets,” he muttered while he smoothed cream over the torn skin.
“Why not?” Nat demanded, putting her hands on her hips. “And don’t give me that ‘I’ve got to work’ bullshit again. You don’t have to work, Steve. None of us are working tonight.”
A surge of gratitude swept over him, and he felt himself sag with relief and...something else. Love? No. That was too weird. Too weird to think of love in connection with Howard Stark, the man he had hated and feared the most over the course of his lifetime. Especially when the bulk of his brain was concentrating on another man. The one he had loved and cherished the most.
When the door popped open, they walked inside.  At the reception desk, Wanda put the moves on the guard sitting there, a red, misty glow coming from her fingertips.  The guy barely had time to turn around before his eyes clouded and he slumped in his seat.
“Mad at you for what?” He shrugged and nudged Tony back. “Not only are you Starks not boring, but you’re also not not-popular either. I’ve known that forever.”
It wasn’t like Tony never saw him. He did. Glimpses of him, anyway. But the easy, flirty banter was gone. Those soft smiles and softer eyes Steve used to send his way were nowhere to be seen. It was as if they had never existed. As if they had never been friends at all. Like they were just “colleagues”. Co-workers. Nothing more special than that, and oh Christ, that hurt. Hurt like a broken bone hurts. Like a severed limb. Like a broken heart.
“If you know the initial point and the end point of a vector, you can use the Distance Formula to figure out its magnitude,” Tony said, then nudged Steve in the side, jolting him out of the mellow, happy place he had been existing in. “Right,
On the floor, Baxter was apoplectic with fear.  His face was maroon, his eyes bulging and spouting tears.  He mouthed at the gag Nat had shoved in his mouth constantly, uttering sounds with no meaning.  Nat paid him no mind whatsoever.  Her thoughts were too full of her friend.
Nat, as supple and strong as she’d ever been, slipped around him and fit her legs into his in a complicated leg-lock.  Tony groaned at the pressure on his knees and hips.
“Okay.  Can you tell me what happened?  I’m sorry if I upset you, but I can’t fix it if I don’t know what it is.”
Tony’s breath grew rougher in his ear. “Oh no,” he whispered in a husky tone, “I want to hear about that. I want to hear all about that. Tell me. Tell me what you were thinking.”
Steve let out a breath and looked at Tony incredulously. His face said he was both surprised and hurt by what Tony had said, and suddenly Tony was wishing heartily that he had just kept his goddamn mouth shut. No, more, that he had just stayed home and did a jigsaw puzzle, or watched a
“And, uh, he was getting some pretty serious looks from the ladies, even with the chair,” Rhodey said.
He tossed his bags and briefcase down onto the couch, and scrounged an old pair of jeans and a stained t-shirt from the floor of the attached bathroom and changed. He was still a little wired from his encounter with the watch salesman. Or angry. Pissed off. He’d let it simmer all afternoon, trying to shake it off, but not quite able to, and that made him jittery and on-edge. Of course, the fact that he had dumped extra espresso shots on top of it all probably didn’t help.
On the landing, Steve turned to Tony and put a finger to his lips. He pointed at the door and mouthed
“Hey, there you are,” he said, his face brightening when he saw Tony.  “We were getting worried, right, cat?”
He looked up suddenly, his eyes boring into Tony’s like diamond chips.  “What would you have done?” he asked.  “If Rhodey had--”
Steve let out a strangled breath as Tony laughed again and hung up, leaving Steve holding a dead receiver. “Tony,” he choked out between sobs. “Tony, don’t go. Tony.” He ran his hand back through his hair, clutching at it, crushing the phone against his ear. “I need you. I miss you. Christ, Tony, please,” he whispered into the nothing in his ear. “I love you. I love you so much. I wanna be with you. Forever, Tony. Please. Please.”
They stood together for a few minutes, just holding each other, soaking in the essence of comfort that brewed between them whenever they were in each other’s arms, then Steve kissed his shoulder again and said, “Sounds like you started the movie.”
--was talking to him right now in a voice that was soft and liquid-warm in his ear. “It’s late,” he said, keeping his own voice quiet, but unable to keep the hint of desire out of it. “And it’ll be even later by the time I get over there.”
Strange leaned forward, studying Tony, as if trying to decide if this was a joke.  “Wanda?” he asked.  “You mean the little witch?”
Tony was in awe of him, pride bursting out of every pore.  Six weeks.  Six fucking weeks.  He’d been almost literally torn in two, organs rearranged and ruptured, spine a litter of bone fragments.  He’d died,
What he didn’t know was how long FRIDAY had been calling Tony’s name before she finally said his instead.
Tony curled easily into him, and Steve's arms wound around his waist, his head against Tony's chest.  Neither of them thought about it. Their bodies knew where to go, what the placement of their limbs should be, knew just where they belonged.  Like puzzle pieces or praying hands, they knew exactly how they fit together.
“I’m okay, Mom,” he said. “But yeah. I’m pretty tired.” She didn’t say anything, just folded him into her arms again, squeezing him and kissing his cheek. He put his head on her shoulder, one arm still around Dodger, and let her hold him for a minute, just reveling in the comfort of her embrace. When she finally released him, he looked around the small apartment. “Where’s Tony?”
“What I want is for you to think about what’s best for Tony. I heard you tell him you’d take care of him. Do that, Steven,” Howard said. “Take care of him. Because he doesn’t know how to take care of himself. Not in that way. He’s too naive. Too much like a child.” He looked down at his own feet, and for the first time, his voice was soft, gentle. “He’s too much like his mother. Beautiful. Trusting. They both wanted everything. Tony doesn’t realize that’s not always possible. Maria didn’t realize it either.”
Dodger didn’t make any more noise, and Steve pet him for a few more minutes, just giving him the attention he deserved for being the best dog ever. When he finally stood up, Dodger followed him into the kitchen to the food bowl he had by the sink now. He looked at Steve, then the bowl, cocking his head in a very clear way. Steve laughed again and gave him a treat from the box in the cupboard. Dodger wolfed it down while Steve drank a glass of water, rinsed his glass, and sat it in the sink.
He tried to beg off on the sex.  Gina was insistent.  He said he was coming down with something.  She said she was going down on something.  He said he’d feel better tomorrow.  She said he certainly would, it was her personal guarantee.  He said, no, really, he wasn’t up for it.  She said he would be, all he had to do was let her…
Steve drew his lower lip into his mouth and chewed it. Tony waited, rage burning inside his every pore.
She hummed, a pleasant vibration against his chest.  "All lumberjacks are inherently sexy, Steve.  I shouldn't have to say it."
He had a few days off, so he came home. She met him at the door when he came in and immediately began snipping at him, telling him he was too thin--even though he had actually gained a little weight since coming back stateside. Telling him he looked too pale--even though he didn’t think he was anywhere near as pale as he had been as a kid. Telling him if he didn’t stop smoking she was going to kick his damn ass for him--even though… nah. She had a point there.
The plane taxied down the runway, then finally stopped.  Tony felt it.  So did Steve, but they both sat still until Jerry came on the intercom.  “We’re here,” he said, then Steve was on his feet.
Tony shrugged.  Steve could have sworn a blush of his own stained Tony’s cheeks.  “You live here too, don’t you?”
He was shaking now.  Tony could see it, his big hands trembling against the arms of the chair.  His jaw was clenched, those eyes, flashing black pearls in the sweet cream of his skin.  He looked both terrible and exquisite, like a god of old, worshipped on an altar stained with the blood of sacrifice.
Peggy had been there that time to keep him from trying to drown himself. Tough Peggy. Brilliant Peggy. Beautiful Peggy. But Peggy was lost to him now. Hydra and the Red Skull had stolen her from him as surely as they’d stolen Bucky. He couldn’t blame her for moving on, for falling in love with someone else and for marrying him and building a life without Steve. He could blame her no more than he could blame the cold north wind for blowing or the Earth for spinning, marking off the hours and days and years that now separated them from each other. What they had had been nothing more than a moment, a drop of saltwater in the ocean of time, a dream only half-remembered upon waking.
“Come for me, Tony. Right now. C-” He fell back on the pillows, cock spurting into his hand, covering his stomach. In his ear, he heard Tony cry out softly, and for one blinding, brilliant moment, he almost felt like he was there with him, holding his sweat-slick body against him, both of them panting, both of them flushed with heat and passion, Tony weak in his arms the way he only was when they were like this. When they were holding each other in the sweet, floaty after-time.
The tie flirted down the line of his back. “We could tie you up.” The silk tightened around his wrists. “Which would be good. Right? That’s what we talked about before, isn’t it?”
Tony’s heart went out to him and he kicked himself for not biting the bullet himself.  He stepped forward and gestured to the bed with the glass.  Condensation beaded the smooth surface and it almost slipped from his hand.  He tightened his grip.  “Which side?”
“Sam.” And he was still crying, tears still falling, but just hearing Sam’s voice made it a little better.
Tony sighed, not wanting to be affected by him and being affected anyway.  Finally, he rolled his eyes to the rafters and said, “Hey, you.”  It was grudging, trying to still be angry, and failing miserably.
Steve smiled back. He couldn’t help it. Even with Nick’s words still rattling in his head, he couldn’t help it. “Hey.”
Tony came into the room and opened the lid of the pot on the stove, inhaling rosemary and garlic and beef. “Holy shit. That smells amazing.”
Steve looked at him finally. The realization had been building slowly, but it came to a crashing crescendo as Howard stood in front of him now. “You want me to break up with him,” he said. “You don’t want to be the bad guy. You want it to be me.”
Behind them, Bucky reached the crest of the hill.  Half a bottle of water hung limply from his hand.  He stopped next to Natasha and Sam, looking at the pair on the ground uncertainly.
“An ‘incident’, maybe,” Sam said. “Look, he made Sarah promise she wouldn’t call you, so that’s why I’m doing it. He’s fine. You know? He’s
Steve took a deep breath, then sat down.  He exhaled, just sitting for a minute, then slowly brought his legs up onto the bed and settled against the headboard.  His eyes were closed.
Steve laughed, and Tony felt light enough to float away. He thought if Steve’s arms weren’t still around him, he might. “I’m not doing this with you,” Steve said.
There were a million other things, but Tony knew he had gotten pretty much all he was going to get from him.  “I guess not.”
He leaned into Steve’s side and kissed his neck. He’d been right. It was impossibly smooth and soft under his lips, and that just made him want to lick it as well, which he did with a relish he was still trying to comprehend. Steve seemed to like it as much as he did. He whimpered a little as Tony’s tongue swept up and down the cords of his neck, then sucked in a breath as he scraped his teeth along his throat. They had progressed past the “no-teeth” rule from before. Tony had discovered Steve very much enjoyed a little bite every now and then. As long as he got kissed and smothered with softness after, which Tony was always more than happy to do.
“They can’t just do that, Nat,” he said, still holding the arrow at the ready.  “They can’t just be allowed to do that.  To anyone.”
.” His hand found Tony’s in the darkness, and he laced their fingers together. “You would have fit right in.”
,” he said pointedly, ignoring Clint and Nat completely--he had principles, after all--and Bruce, who had stayed silent during the entire thing, gave him a tiny smile.
“Yes, we were excruciatingly civil and used only our words, right, Cap?” Tony said, tipping Steve a wink.
Steve gave them one last look. Sam, his best friend. His mother, wearing his favorite blue dress. There was a chance, however small, that he would never see them again. And if this was to be the last time, he wanted to burn it into his memory. The two of them, standing close together in the rain.
She nodded.  “Yes.  Selfish.  As in, you’re thinking only about yourself.  As in, you’re not taking into account the fact that he
“But what do I do with myself?”  Steve asked.  It was a big question, maybe the only question right now, but Tony’s heart felt extraordinarily light.  That hopeless cast was gone from Steve’s eyes.  His face was open again, trusting, ready to be happy.  Tony had no illusions.  There was a deep-seated depression there, and eventually Steve would need someone to talk to about it--someone with a few degrees on the wall and a string of letters after their name--but Tony thought they’d made it over this particular hump, at least for tonight.  He felt a bright flash of pride.  In Steve.  In himself.  In them.
Nope, not heartbreak anymore.  What was the alternative?  Old age?  Fine.  Old-man tears were allowed.
He didn’t really know anyone else at his table. A couple of people, but no one well enough to have an actual conversation. He was fine with that too. He didn’t even really want to be here. He wasn’t planning on staying long. Just long enough to watch a couple dances. Have a piece of cake, an obligatory glass of champagne, then he was gone. It wasn’t that crowded, really, but Bucky had a big extended family, and with kids running around and a multitude of aunts and uncles and grandparents all talking about how good Bucky looked, and how lucky Natasha was, it
“I’m not sensing anything, boss, but be wary.  My assessment of the situation--and the man--suggests he probably has a firearm somewhere near him now.”
Tony nodded.  Suddenly, he was tired too.  He had a bad feeling he’d done something wrong, and he wasn’t quite sure what it had been.  Sure, coming to pick him up had not been the plan, but surely Steve had known somewhere inside that head of his that Tony would show up.  Sure, he wasn’t supposed to know, but he found things out.  Nobody could keep anything from him.  Steve knew that.  Sure, it probably wasn’t what he’d had in mind when Tony brought him here to the home they’d shared, but Steve had to have guessed he’d end up here.  Right?  And that Tony had changed it all while he’d been gone?  Right?
He went into the house and closed the door.  He checked on Steve, then turned on the tv to start the wait.  There was a storm coming, the grinning weatherman said.  “Better watch yourselves out there, party people,” he said.  Tony groaned and turned the tv back off.  He’d rather have the silence than
Steve shook his own head, and his smile became more genuine. “Fuck you,” he muttered, and Sam laughed, the slight break between them fixed just like that. That was one of the things he liked about being around Sam. It wasn’t complicated. They were just friends. Nothing more. No weird fluttery feelings in his gut when he looked at Sam. No worrisome wonderings about what Sam’s hair would feel like under his palm. No memories of Sam’s breath on his cheek, his hand touching Sam’s hand in that shady spot under the trees back behind the school…
Tony lay back down and put his arm over his eyes. Dodger took the opportunity to lie down and put his head on his paws. “Think this is funny, do you?” Tony asked.
“Uh-huh,” Steve agreed. His lips were perilously close to Tony’s now. So close, Steve could almost taste the vodka and cranberry juice on them. Sweet and tart. Perfect. “But if all it took was a few daggers to scare him off, then he had no business being with you anyway.”
Tony reached toward him languidly, not touching him, trying not to, to make his point.  “But you’re still all the way over there.”
The thought of Howard popped into Tony’s head, what he would think about this, how he would feel, but he leaned his head against Steve’s knee, and it went away.  Tony let it go.  He was getting better at that, too.
Tony looped his arm around the kid’s neck, then took the phone and handed it to Pepper.  She eyed him angrily.  He shrugged.  “Pep, honey, will you?”
She snapped her suitcase closed and grabbed the handles.  It banged into Tony’s knee when she picked it up.  He hoped she’d done it on purpose.
“I loved it,” she said simply, and his heart burst with love for her. And for Tony. For the fact that they loved each other so much. The fact that they had a bond that had nothing to do with him. Something they had forged themselves, and never let break even after all the years he and Tony had spent apart. If he hadn’t already been the happiest guy in the world, that would have clinched it for him.
Tony looked a question at Strange and he nodded.  “I’ll be back in fifteen minutes.”  A look of vague consternation crossed his face.  “Please...be ready.”
Steve’s hand found its way to Tony’s belt loop.  His finger curled into it and Tony made a sound dreadfully close to a sob.  He wound his hand into Steve’s hair and kissed him deeply.
Steve glanced upwards.  Tony teased him for doing that, for talking to the ceiling when he was talking to FRIDAY, but he couldn’t seem to break the habit.
It was another frustrating, nerve-wracking, hair-pulling fifteen minutes before he pulled the car into the hospital parking lot.  He got out and ran into the building. He didn't stop in the waiting room. He jostled past people, slowing now by necessity, and finally found Tony's door, opened it, and went inside.
He didn’t hear the soft-footed approach. He only looked up when the shadow fell on the page. And when he finally did, his eyes widened minutely.
“Baby,” Tony breathed, and the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stood up. “Don’t talk to me like that unless you’re really going to come over here and do something about it.”
He’d helped his mother through a battle with cancer. He’d stood as best man for his friend and comrade’s wedding--then stood up again with his best friend when it was
“He called,” Sarah said. “He said he’d be here soon.” She ran her hand through his hair, fingering the ends. “Do you want to wait?”
Tony touched his wine glass, running his finger around the rim, his eyes finding Steve’s over the flickering candles.  “Have we ever done this?”
.  Steve let his hand move up and down Tony’s back, stroking it smoothly. “It’ll be better next time,” he said. “I won’t be so weird. I’ll try and-”
isn’t working.  I can’t get it to work.  I don’t know what to say, and even if I did, it wouldn’t be good enough for
Since Tony wasn’t home, Steve told his boss he could work a shift on Tuesday and Wednesday. He skipped his last class and went in to work at two. He stocked shelves, bagged groceries, helped carry things out to people’s cars. It was easy work. He enjoyed it for the most part. His boss, happy that Steve had decided to come in, was even pleasant. He even told a joke. Steve laughed longer and louder than he normally would have. Just to make him happy.
Mr. Barker nodded. He looked back toward the front of the store. He still looked nervous. “That’s what he said, Rogers.” He frowned down at Steve. “He’s not
Howard laughed. Cynical, sarcastic. Too much like Tony’s own for comfort. “I’ve got more strings than you’ve got brains, kiddo. I say the word and you don’t go to school
“Not all apologies have to happen because you did something,” Tony said.  “Sometimes you just say you’re sorry to be nice.  Because the other person needs to hear it.”
Steve backed toward the walk-way.  “I’m serious,” he said.  “Never talk about her again, Ross.  I’ll kill you.”
Steve looked up and everything else fell away, relief and happiness compounded on his face the second Tony was in front of him. “Hey. There you are.”
He ran his hands over Steve’s arms, his back, then touched his cheek, wanting to slow this down a little, wanting to kiss him, wanting to draw it out and make it last.
They sat out on the deck, each of them with a beer.  It wasn’t quite five o’clock yet, but hell, it was June and sunny, and Tony was on vacation.  You were supposed to drink on vacation.  He thought it might even be in the Constitution.
“What kind of message?” Tony asked. His voice seemed faint. Steve wasn’t sure if that was because Tony was speaking quietly, or out of some trick of his own auditory senses. It didn’t matter, he told himself. It didn’t fucking matter. Just tell him what was going on and get out. Get out.
Nat and Sam climbed into the back seat, and Steve started the car with a growl. It was Tony’s car, a midnight blue 1969 Dodge Charger that he had redone all by himself, and it was gorgeous. He thought it looked even more gorgeous with Steve in the driver’s seat, and he wondered if maybe subconsciously--or unconsciously, anyway--he had fixed it up with Steve in mind. The fact that he hadn’t known Steve when he did the work, did not make him think any differently.
Steve gave him a smile. A tiny one. Just a flash of white teeth between red lips. “Just going to get a drink,” he said, and then he was gone.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Nice, guys.  Thanks.  Really.  I needed to have the shit kicked out of me when I’m down.  That’s very thoughtful.”
She looked like she was about to say something else, but she didn’t. She just held him tighter and put her head against his chest, moving with him to the music. Steve was glad about that too. He didn’t really want to think about whatever else she might have said.
“Okay. In the interest of that, I’m going to tell you that I definitely don’t want you to go. Emphatically not. Okay?”
Tony looked at them.  All the horrible things Ross had done to Steve over the years.  Steve didn’t want to know about this part of it.  He didn’t want to think about what the consequences would be for Ross.  Or even if there
Steve shook his head, slipped his hand along Tony’s side, across his stomach, and touched the button of his jeans. “I don’t. I understand. It’s okay.”
He smiled and a blush rose up on his cheeks. That didn’t happen very often, but he kind of loved it. “I love you too.”
He turned to the table and began to sweep all his notes back into their folder.  He whistled a little while he worked.
“Save it for the camera, baby,” Tony growled in his ear, and Steve blushed harder. Smiled more. How did he get so lucky?
“I’m clean,” Tony said, watching Steve yank his own jeans off. “I got tested again a couple weeks ago, but-”
He lifted his chin toward the terrorist in front of the bandstand. He had a drink in his hand and as Steve watched, it slipped from his fingers and shattered on the floor. The man followed, crumpling at the knee and falling face-first onto the ground. The people around him “oohed” and formed a little interested group. One of Tony’s security guards broke through and lifted the man up. I was impossible to hear what he was saying, but by the looks on the crowd’s faces, it was probably something about indulging in too much champagne.
sometimes, until I couldn’t stand it anymore, and then I’d go to Rhodey. He always kind of grumbled about me waking him up, but that was just for show. He always let me in. He always took care of me.”
Steve ignored the tears that were trying to fall. They shouldn’t be there. Everything was okay. Everything was okay, so there was no need for tears. He wiped them hurriedly away, using the gesture to pull Tony closer, hold him tighter.
They were quiet. Steve pet Dodger’s head, continuously, softly. He didn’t make any move to talk to Tony. His body was warm, but he didn’t try to touch him, either. The only part of his body that moved was his fingers in the dog’s fur, and finally Tony--who was trying his goddamndest to be patient--couldn’t stand it anymore.
about someone’s supposed “crush”. It wasn’t about someone else’s (ie. his own, although he had never admitted to it and never would) reciprocal feelings of crushiness. No, this was about practicality and the safety of the good old U.S. of A. on her birthday.
He glanced almost nervously over his shoulder, then back at Steve. “There’s someone here to see you.”
Steve took Tony’s fingers in his own hand and pressed them against his mouth. His eyes drifted closed, and he sighed. “I’d like to stay here for a little bit. I love staying with Nat and Sam, but it might be nice to have a change of scenery.”
Tony watched him go.  He wanted to say something, wanted to go after him, but, for the moment at least, he was powerless to do either of those things.
Tony let out a breath, then moved his hand away from Steve’s. He moved it to the side of his neck. He stretched his thumb up and dabbed at the wetness under his eye. “Forever, baby,” he promised.
drunk in Malibu.  Nobody else was there.  No annoying, well-meaning friends dropping in.  Yeah, they dropped in now.  Since Gina’d left him in Cabo and he came back to New York sloppy drunk and had to have the cab driver and the doorman carry him up to the penthouse, they dropped in.  The bastards.
“Sorry,” he muttered under his breath so no one else could hear. “I tried to tell her not to do that, but…” he trailed off, shaking his head fondly.
Tony’s face twisted in comical disgust.  “Aww, Steve.  Gross.  I don’t want him knowing about our...
Sam shook his head and gestured vaguely with his bottle.  “Nah, nah, nah.  It’s between us.  She’ll never hear it from me.”
“I don’t know,” Steve said, clasping Tony’s hand and holding it tight. “I don’t want to bring that stuff home to you, Tony. That’s why I didn’t come here in the first place. I don’t want to put that on you.”
And here it was. A pretty little girl, decked out in a red dress, smiling into a camera, looking so much like Tony that Steve felt sick to his stomach. Feeling those old sensations of want, and grief, and pain surge up inside him again, threatening to take him over. He put his hand in his pocket and closed it over his six-month chip. He’d backslid a few times since trying to get sober, but he had six months now. Six long months. He ran his thumb over the face of it, then clenched it tight in his fist.
Tony pulled back enough to look into his eyes. He touched his cheek. “You're amazing, do you know that?” he asked. “Doing that?
It was a good moment.  A good day.  One of those ones you can keep in your back pocket to pull out and look at when times weren’t going so well.  There’d just been that one little hiccup.  Just the one.  And he could put his thumb over that when looking at it, like you did over a tiny flaw in an otherwise perfect photograph.
Steve laughed a little and put his arms around Sam. “You’ll take care of her, won’t you?” Steve whispered in his ear.
Steve bent his head onto Tony’s shoulder, holding him closer. “Now that you’re here, it is,” he said.
She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.  There was fresh blood on his lips, his chin, his cheek.  Had it only been last night that she’d kissed those lips, stroked that cheek?  It seemed like a lifetime now, a cold, lonely lifetime.
.  It wasn’t fair, Tony decided, and added a good, old-fashioned lap-sitting to his list of things he was going to do when he got Steve home.  The list was growing at an alarming rate.  And Steve had just added to it, too.
She flapped a hand. “Oh, honey, none of that’s changed. I just don’t think it will be an issue.” She leaned forward. "Do you?"
