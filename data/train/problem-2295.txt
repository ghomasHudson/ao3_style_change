“She has rubbish taste in personal assistants, though,” Sherlock goes on. “All the ones she sent me have dropped too many hints about their employers in public. Well, except Vanessa Carlton.”
.  The House of Holmes could never stir itself to avenge
“Can I?” I whisper.
“Well, let’s never do that again, then.”
“Pretty sure I do. You want me to know that you were watching us, and that I should now be very scared of you and whatever punishment you’re planning to dish out. Well, yeah, okay, message received, so let’s turn this off and get on to phase two.”
“So?” he said.
“Well. She was…competent.”
“One more setting on this thing,” John says. “Shall we give it a whirl?”
“Sherlock!” John blinked, recognizing his pale face in the dimness.  “What do you think you’re doing?”
We run toward the sound, and find the two children in the beam of Sally’s torch. They’re smiling, well-groomed, munching sandwiches from a tin school lunchbox lying open between them. They’ve lined up a bunch of the silver-wrapped chocolates in a row on the ground.
When the gate guard waves Sherlock through, having checked Mycroft’s authorization, Sherlock sits back smugly in his seat. “The keys to the kingdom,” he says.
him, not some actor.  He knows and feels and believes that he is extraordinary, and when he looks at me, it’s like having my soul x-rayed.  I’m immediately terrified that he’ll see through everything right then, but I guess the beauty of the whole setup is that he’s so used to being the only real thing in the world that he no longer even questions the feeling.
“Sherlock.” I start pushing toward the edge of the crowd, needing space, needing quiet.
“Sherlock.”
“It’s not one of ours,” he says, quietly.
, said John, and he thrust faster, and squeezed, and Sherlock lost the thread of his thought and started stroking himself again. His glans was against John’s prostate, he thought, which explained why John’s movements seemed less and less to do with the toy and more to do with impaling himself on Sherlock’s cock.
Sherlock is leaned up on one elbow watching me, eyes wide, no doubt wondering if I’m going to push him away again. His skin is flushed pink, right down to the open collar of his shirt.
We go through our usual nightly routine, taking turns in the cottage’s tiny bathroom. It’s only after I’m tucked up on the not-too-uncomfortable sofa that the full import of the day’s events hits me, and a tiny curl of hope unfurls in my chest. There may be an end in sight, after all.
“Flunitrazepam, usually.”
“That’s not what I meant,” he said.  “What are you playing at?”
“Doing what?”
That settled the issue for the moment, and John thought no more about it until he was lying in his bed later that night.  Then the sound of Mycroft’s words came back to him:
Sherlock, and he thought Sherlock liked him, but any friendly overture was guaranteed to meet with a firm refusal. Never mind any
However upset I am, I don’t dare go far from Sherlock. Out in the windy night, I sit down on one of the picnic table benches outside of the pub. I still have my glass from inside, and I toss the liquor back quickly, relishing the burn of it.
“Is that what you want?” he asks.
“I’ve worked out the missing heiress case.”
His dark gloved hand darts out to grab the crook of my elbow, pulling me close—not roughly, but snugly. “If I win,” he purrs, “I get to do something to you that no one’s ever done before.”
“Wait.” I hop off again and gesture—not with the gun—to the unseated rider, who pries off his helmet and gives it to me. He’s a young guy, dark-skinned.
“Did Mycroft send you?” I ask her.
“Yes,” I say at last.
“Ah, you’ve come,” he said, sounding pleased.  “Your timing is good.  I hadn’t meant to put you to work quite so soon, but it’s become a necessity.  Would you mind taking up that holly branch there?”
“I’d claim it was because I thought he’d take it better coming from you,” he says. “But the truth is, I just wanted the excuse for us to have this little chat. Bad behavior has consequences, Jack. Do I make myself clear?”
be you. Well, did you get it? Are you taking it?”
It turns out that Sherlock’s exile is quite similar to Mycroft’s, except that the elder brother’s country hideaway has about a thousand times more square footage. Sherlock’s is a tiny crofter’s cottage in Cornwall, with nothing else around it for miles. If you didn’t know Sherlock was there, you might assume it wasn’t even occupied, as the garden has long since gone to seed and the fence and the roof need mending.
Slow Glass is a concept I lifted from my dim memory of Bob Shaw's story "The Light of Other Days". (I thought I remembered it being Bradbury, but I've been set straight!)
“The potion swiller? What about him?”
This is him,
Sherlock climbed back into bed without answering and spooned up behind John again, leaving the supplies tucked up beside his pillow.
“Excessive,” John agrees, and laughs. Sherlock laughs, too, the world coming back into focus a little. Except—except there’s still that buzzing, slightly higher pitched, now. Maybe not phantom after all. And, even considering everything, John is breathing a little…funny. Sherlock turns in his arms to peer at him sharply.
John thought for the rest of the afternoon about what Mike had said. Teach—the very idea! But Hogwarts…John tried to imagine it. As a kid the lives of the professors had seemed practically unreal. But now, piecing together the bits of his memories, he found that he could form a picture of them: ordinary (if quite skilled) witches and wizards, with friendships and rivalries. Colleagues, idealists, hermits. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Sherlock’s lips twisted into a series of endearingly bitter expressions. “No,” he said at last.
“I’d like to lie down,” he says. “Can we?”
Once I’ve got the three serial numbers selected, I go to K2K and hit the switch. The hourglass spins for almost a minute before it turns green. My laptop shows a grey haze where Sherlock’s mirror was. I slip the phone back into its drawer, taking a moment to wipe off my fingerprints. And we’re done.
If only he could look harder for a camera. He’d gouge the wall open looking for it, if it weren’t for Coventry. John, in particular, mustn’t know that he suspects. Because the facts so far suggest that John is in league with one of them: Mycroft, Irene, Moriarty.
It turns out to be a quiet little case, no running or jumping or shooting. Sherlock works it out neatly and does his reveal in classic fashion, with victim and criminal and law enforcement all handily in the same room. Elegant, like a magician. Even if the clues were planted, even if somebody, somewhere, knew how it would end, it’s still Sherlock that makes it work—his intelligence, his art. He glances at me in the midst of his speech and catches me smiling at him. He smiles back, eyes alight. I’ve gotten a lid on it by the time we get home, but it’s too late. He is flushed with success, and I with admiration.
“You know,” I start, and then I have to pause. He watches me expectantly. How much am I going to say? “I never thought this would…that I’d be out here with you, like this. I never really dared to think about it.”
“What about this, then?” he asks.
“Well, actually—“
“More or less, yeah,” John said.
“Other magicians have each other,” Sherlock said.  “They have assistants, or apprentices, or just--people they can ask for things.”
Much later in the morning he sends a text to Vanessa, and we meet with a real estate broker later that day.
And thanks to you, dear readers! Especially those who stuck around through the hiatus. It was a huge boost to my motivation to know that you were out there, actually reading my words and waiting for more. I have been floored by some of the theories and interpretations you've shared with me. You are brilliant!
“Probably not,” Sherlock answered.  “Depends on how the spell goes.”
“Yes,” he says. “But—“
John started to get up, but Sherlock put a hand on his arm.
“And you’ve seen me at my worst.”
“Obviously,” he says, from the depths of a kitchen cupboard where he’s digging around for something to eat.
“What is this place?”  John asked.
When she answers him, her words run clattering down the long hall of his mind palace, a giggling child who darts behind a door and shuts it, creating a whole new room just for herself.
“Sorry?”
“You were just a kid,” John says. “Sherlock, look at me. You were just a kid. You had no one you could trust. What were you supposed to do? I think you—when you got back from boarding school. I think you knew, and you…you integrated that, or sublimated it or whatever. And you pressed on the best you could. I think, the drugs and everything—that’s what it was about. You know?”
“No!” John said. “No, no, that’s not—no. I was just curious because you…were in the class last year and, and. Wait. So did you…pass? Did you pass the class?”
The sitting room door stood already ajar, so that the visitor had only to push it open to gain admittance.  This he did, causing to Sherlock to scowl even more deeply than before.
what happens to you.  I want you to know who is in charge of you and Sherlock and this entire operation.”
Except. There is still that question, that thing that John knows that he isn’t telling. Sherlock hasn’t missed the fact that they’ve now dallied twice in John’s bedroom, when Sherlock’s is more convenient and bigger and has a bigger bed and a more comfortable bathroom. At John’s suggestion, in fact.
“It’s doing harm to you,” John said.  “I’d like to know what it’s supposed to accomplish, if you don’t mind.”
“Oh, thank you,” she said again. “Well, goodbye.”
“Yeah, well, don’t expect a performance like that every time you steal my gun to try and make friends with a supervillain.”  I lick my lips.   “I mean, you did just risk both our lives for some kind of game.”
“Are you online much?” she asks, lightly. “You haven’t updated your website in a while.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I remember her visiting us all the time before my parents died. The rest of the family thought she was a cranky old bitch.”
“Now would be fantastic.”
Twenty-seven minutes since he woke, alone, to John’s omega scent and the sight of Sherlock’s most extravagant toy lying on John’s pillow. The long, thick, curved one, with the remote controlled variable-speed vibration and inflatable knot, and the knobby bit at the base. It’s made of black and turquoise swirled pearlescent silicone. Because realism is not the goal. Sherlock doesn’t actually make use of this object very often, as it’s almost too much, really. A case of biting off more than one can chew. Or eyes bigger than one’s…anyway. It was an impulse purchase.
“Just wear it,” I order.
“What do you mean?”
“But you
“Shh,” he breathes.
A door opens, and I’m the only one that looks to see who’s come in.  It’s Mycroft, but he’s wearing his big-shot TV producer button-down and designer jeans, not his Sherlock’s Big Brother intimidating suit.
, I nearly say. But then,
I’ve rehearsed my “we have to stop” speech so many times in my head that I’m utterly lost when Sherlock doesn’t let me finish it, and my traitorous tongue offers up an unauthorized compromise:
Sherlock straightened the rug by the mundane method of shoving it here and there with his foot, then had John help him put the furniture back in place.  It was nothing ostentatious: a couple of aging armchairs, some small tables, a desk and chair.  There was a long leather sofa against one wall, but that hadn’t been moved.
“Anyway,” Gary says. “Sorry we couldn’t do a twin for you boys. Last minute reservations, you know how it is.”
She hefts a large frame, carved and gilded, from the stack. The canvas shows a stocky, broad-shouldered young aristocrat in mid-victorian military garb. It’s not an especially handsome face, but the artist has captured a certain rather captivating self-assurance, a chilly fineness about the eyes and mouth that suggests a knowing and secretive nature. It’s a good picture. Arresting.
“So,” said John.
“Have you ever tied anyone up?”
“Nah,” John said. “Never happen. Even his friends must be glad to be free of him. Look at how peaceful everything is now. Nobody could want to go back to the bad old days, surely.”
His left hand is still resting against his mouth, the fingers of his right just touching me. His eyes are closed.
Sherlock decided to take the hint that John was finished talking (and anyhow, he had no idea what to say). The full body contact seemed to calm John down, and gradually his muscles went slack and his breathing evened out. At some point he slid off sideways to nestle under Sherlock’s arm. They fell asleep that way.
Then John was on him, kissing him, hard and hungry. He pushed Sherlock over onto his back and climbed on top of him, heedless of their mess. He grabbed a double handful of hair to hold Sherlock’s head down and kissed him with bruising force, mouth wide open, teeth striking teeth and tongue delving. Sherlock writhed under the onslaught, breathless, and when John had finished with his mouth he moved down to suck brutally at Sherlock’s neck, raising a bruise in seconds. Sherlock hissed and kicked his feet to stop himself pushing John away. It hurt, but it felt
Naturally, she appears at the most dramatically appropriate moment. Her flair for timing verges on the unnatural. Unless she’s being helped, somehow.
He dries his hands on a dish towel and goes to admit our guest. I’m far too curious to linger in the kitchen, so I’m peering past Sherlock’s shoulder when he opens the door.
The next several days passed in relative calm.  John interviewed for several jobs, and eventually found a part-time position at a low income clinic.  Really, they needed a full-time doctor, but the money was a bit too tight to hire one.  Consequently, John put in a number of unpaid hours.  It was hard work, and paid little, but it more-or-less satisfied his desire to accomplish something useful.
The bell rang downstairs. Mrs Hudson was not in, as she had taken to visiting her sister during John’s heats (“No offense, dear, but at my time of life,” she’d said, leaving the rest unspoken, and Sherlock had not been offended.) so John, in a dressing gown probably, left the flat and went all the way down to the street door. As they came back up, Sherlock could hear them talking: excited, nervous. A burst of laughter. The sound of his own name, distinct. His heart was pounding. The smell of John was still on his fingers, and he breathed it in, paradoxically soothing and inflammatory. His omega.
She’s quiet for a moment.
Even with my good overcoat on, Holmes was still obviously suffering. If he had spent all the warmth from his core, then the dry coat would serve no purpose but to hold his wet clothes against his body. It was, all in all, a profoundly stupid situation. Good men had died of less foolish errors. However, given Holmes’ piteous state, I resolved to save my tongue-lashing until after he was out of danger.
So I’m feeling pretty good as we make our way back to Henry Knight’s place after the sighting of his “hound”. I didn’t see it, and Sherlock claims not to have seen it, though Henry seems sure that he must have. Conflicting evidence! Drama! Things are heating up.
“Nothing you haven’t seen before.”
“That good?” John asks, quietly.
“Oh,” he says. “Good. That’ll make things easier.” His ears are pink. God, why is the sofa so far from the armchair?
“You want to take these off?” I ask.
He backs out of the door, gun still trained on me. Footsteps in the hall, the slamming door. I am alone.
“Truth is,” said Lestrade, “I’ve always wanted to try something like this, but I always worried about emotional complications.”
“Try sitting straight up,” John says, peering round the door frame. Then he’s gone again.
“Ahh, fuck!” John cried, twisting out of the kiss, his voice rough. “Now, Greg, seriously, I’m on fire. Fuck me right now.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I read about that. Two healthy young women
“Well, goodness knows there isn’t much else to talk about, most of the time. You can’t help having favorites. Sherlock Holmes was in your year, wasn’t he?”
“Are you sure, Sherlock? It’s quite—”
“You think this is all old hat for me, do you? Because you haven’t done it before, and I have?” A kiss on his nose, and one where the corner of his mouth is turning up a little ruefully. He shrugs, not denying anything.
Sherlock easily gives his companions the slip while John is distracted by Henry’s state of anxiety.  Stalking away up the narrow lane back to the village, he breathes deeply of the cool night air, trying in vain to calm his racing heart. A stiff wind drags high clouds drag across the face of the moon. It pulls at the fullness of his coat and moans in the branches of the ancient, gnarled oaks growing alongside the road.
“Sherlock,” I start, but he holds up a hand, tugs the hem of his jacket down, and stalks off into his bedroom without a word.  The door clicks shut behind him.  For a moment I wish I were outside, where even now the public is watching to see how Sherlock reacts to romantic rejection.  But here, in our flat, he has his privacy from me, at least.
In the morning—Saturday—Sherlock was Alpha, too.  This was good news, as it meant that he could carry out his plan.
“Sherlock—“
It took a little convincing, but Sherlock did eventually allow John to quiz him using his notes. Then Sherlock quizzed John in Potions. Then they gossiped a bit about Harry Potter, who had been sorted that year, a topic which even Sherlock Holmes found interesting.
“What?” John asked, still not understanding.
Dizzy rush of heat. Can’t find words. “Ah, huh. Yes?”
I pause, trying to formulate a deflection. Big mistake.
“Are you and John…fighting?”
“Easy,” John says, a little sternly. His strong hands pin Sherlock’s hips in place. “Easy, my love, settle down. I’ll not bite you.” Sherlock digs his toes into the sheet and tries to hold still. John’s breath ghosts over his skin again, and he tenses. When the touch comes again, it is firm enough to at least not be ticklish, and he relaxes somewhat. John lays down a series of long, flat licks that are maybe…almost…nice, if it weren’t so—
He almost jumps when John taps his shoulder with the folded newspaper.
They dawdled around the village together until it was time for John to go, and they kissed goodbye, rather more decorously than John would have preferred, before he sprang aloft from the village green.
“Mm. No. But I like surprising you. You’re always surprising me.”
Sherlock lowered his tools and turned to look at John.  John felt that if he could see Sherlock’s eyes, they would be narrowed in suspicion.
Back at Baker Street, he finds that John has gone out and come back again and gone to bed. John has left him a curry in a bag on the worktop, but he ignores it. He lies down on the sitting room sofa, steeples his fingers beneath his chin, and listens to the traffic outside, wishing he could be certain whether its rhythms have changed. There’s something not right, something he can’t put his finger on, which brings him back again to Grimpen Village and the way he felt ever so slightly out of his depth when he turned his attention to anything besides the case. Even John seemed different there. But different how? It’s inexpressible, inexplicable, and he clenches his teeth in frustration. John, usually so transparent to his insight, is hiding something.
“How can you—“
I debated whether to point out that, strictly speaking, I had placed myself in this position, but he went on, evidently at pains to express himself precisely.
For Christmas, Sherlock gets an extravagant mobile phone and the corpse of Irene Adler.  If it is her…he’s not sure, actually.  The bashed-up face is quite suspicious.
“Ngh,” Sherlock says. And then John pushes the button again, and Sherlock can no longer sit still.
“You won’t zap me,” Sherlock said. “I’ll be more careful. And you’ll get better. Really.”
“I dunno. Bottle of good scotch?”
“It just seems like the sort of plan that would be hatched by an egomaniac with no real understanding of human emotions. No offense.”
“Nothing that’ll do any harm,” Sherlock replied.  This had become his standard answer to any such question, but this time it wasn’t enough.
By now, all the fine hairs are standing up on his arms and the back of his neck. He keeps his face expressionless. He closes his laptop and goes into his room.
“What’s this?” John asked.
At first, there’s nothing. Just an ordinary network. Then a small camera icon lights up in the corner of his screen. He clicks it.
“Yes.”
Sherlock only huffed in reply, suddenly lost for words. John smiled, tapping away on the phone—clearly he was sending something much longer than “Sherlock isn’t home”, but Sherlock spared himself the effort of imagining what it might be. Before John finished the message, a reply came back, Lestrade’s reaction to the photo, and John gave a joyful bark of a laugh.
. But before Sherlock can react, it starts up again, on a slow, thudding tempo that rises and falls in intensity. He bites his lip and holds very still.
“Not entirely,” Sherlock said. “But I couldn’t bear to fail the class again, and I thought it was worth the risk.”
“Not yet,” Sherlock agreed. “I give it seven hours.”
“Yeah,” said John, rolling the thing between his hands. “Sometimes. Erm. Thank you. It’ll be fun to try out.”
John chuckled. “And your master plan is revealed.” But he took the toy. Without waiting to be asked, Sherlock applied a well-slicked hand to John’s cock.
I press in up past the second knuckle, and he gives a quiet hum. Christ, so hot and slick inside, his pulse pounding against my fingertips. His tongue darts out across his lower lip—in imitation of me, maybe, as I’m suddenly conscious of my own tongue stuck out in concentration. I pull it back in, and Sherlock smiles hazily, laughing at me. Then I let my fingers move inside him, and the smile gives way to something a good deal less coherent. I bend and twist my fingers, working him the way I know he likes it; his eyes close again, and I can feel how his whole body reacts to what I’m doing, all his little shivers and pulses. Gradually he he relaxes and cuddles up against me, propping his knee on my hip to keep his legs open just far enough. His cock rubs against the front of my wrist, thrusting gently with the rhythm of my hand. He breathes against my shoulder, deep and steady.
It was nearly a year into John’s career as an Auror that they received reports of a series of suspicious magical explosions in a Muggle part of Croydon. They hadn’t been aware of any Death Eater activity in the area (by now the Aurors were calling them Death Eaters again—might as well call a spade a spade), and the explosions hadn’t targeted any buildings, so it was presumed to be either an accident or a prank. John went down to investigate with his usual partner, a rather hot-tempered witch named Holly Quigley.
In this universe, I own a very real gun, and a supply of real ammunition—not blanks.  These items were issued to me before filming started.  I want to ask Mycroft about it, but I haven’t seen him yet; the scene where he abducts me is going to be filmed out of order.  I suppose the gun would have to be real in case Sherlock gets hold of it, but surely the better option would be just not to have a gun at all.  I wonder whether anyone else has a real gun.
“They don’t have quite the same gravitas, you must admit.”
“He’ll suspect it either way,” Mycroft said. “You might as well profit by it.”
“Charms.”
“I know,” I said. “I am quite able to wait until we are safe and warm at home.”
As it turns out, I needn’t have bothered.  Sherlock emerges from his room at 2 P.M., eyes glued to something on his mobile.  He takes his cold plate of breakfast, deposits it on the floor beside the sofa, and goes back to his phone without acknowledging my presence in the slightest.
, damn it all. He tried to get the cane out in front, but it was too late. He collapsed to the pavement with a cry of dismay.
“Well,” Lestrade says. “It’ll be down to you, in that case.”
And so they fell into a routine of studying together. It was…well, it was useful. John’s grades definitely improved. And it was pleasant—fun, even, being with Sherlock, getting to know him. His point of view was different from anyone John had ever met; he almost always came away from their sessions with some new thought in his head. And Sherlock could tell the most extraordinary things about people just by looking at them, like where they had grown up and what they were interested in and what they were scared of. John was dead impressed with that particular skill, even when Sherlock’s observations weren’t funny or scandalous or horrifying, which they frequently were. John was half desperate to know what Sherlock could deduce about
“You may be aware that he is not very popular.”
“There was no woman in there. I was alone.”
“Well, it was a cracking orgasm,” John said. “Five out of five. But, Christ, I’m still not—I’m not calm. Adrenaline. Like we’ve been fighting.”
It’s not that I think I have any claim on Sherlock’s attention.  I mean, nothing good would come of his focusing it on me, anyway.  I’m only an actor.  But the thing is, Jim Moriarty is also only an actor, a setup, a lie, and Sherlock lights up like Christmas at the mere thought of him.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. “Hello, John.”
“There, get up,” Sherlock said, rising swiftly and turning away. “Quickly, now, or we’ll lose him!”
Mike didn’t resist the change of subject, and they chatted amiably for a while and promised to keep in touch.
“Well?” he asked.
“Sorry,” he gasped. “Oh, God, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.”
in something.  That means he suspects.  But nobody turns up to hand me my walking papers, which means that he doesn’t yet suspect
of ruining the plan.
“So, you’re the famous John Watson,” Gary says, once I’m settled in at the bar.
I consider this, consider her.
“God, you are warm,” he said. He shuddered and nuzzled his face down between my shoulder and the pallet, his cheek cold against my skin. I held him tightly, feeling his shivers diminish little by little. My shoulder was going numb from being pinned down for so long, but I ignored it. The smell of his pomade was strong in my nostrils, overlaying the faintly muddy smell deposited by the ungentle embrace of the Thames. The muscles of his back were hard with tension. Our knees bumped together. Hardly ideal, I thought; I parted my legs slightly so that he could get one thigh between mine.
],” John puffed. “Well, thanks anyway. Suppose I’d better go and change.”
“I’m not interested in being a servant,” John said, but Sherlock waved his hand.
I can’t quite muster up any encouragement, and after a moment of regarding me, his eyebrows draw together and he looks away again. A second later, though, his finger brushes against mine. I open my hand, and he takes it and grasps it tightly, there under the tablecloth where no one can see.
help anyone stay focused?”
She sighs and stands up, tossing her cigarette butt to the ground.
This conversation takes place as, by unspoken mutual agreement, we both undress ourselves. Sherlock leaves his little grey pants on—a thing with him, apparently, which is more than fine with me—but, since I’m the subject of this experiment, I strip completely. The painting is still on my mind, but this feels…good. The right move. Sherlock folds his creased trousers into thirds and sets them on a chair, then gestures me onto the bed. I lie down on my back, get comfortable. Sherlock clambers up to kneel between my feet.
John began to see: all those magicians, going about in groups, hiring out as clans.  They were never on their own.  They always had each other.  And who did Sherlock have?
John sat up. Sherlock stopped playing abruptly, turning to look at him.
So it is with no little trepidation that he mounts the stairs to Flight 007. But then: corpses. He lets out a long, relieved breath. Coventry. Of course.
John bristled at being spoken about in such a fashion, but Mike answered before he could speak.
I try not to look guilty when Lestrade shows up to clean up the…crime scene.  Yeah.  I’m not totally sure which crime is being cleaned up, but there definitely has been at least one.  Lestrade acts like he doesn’t know I shot the cabbie, except that when he first catches sight of me he gives me this look: eyes open wide, mouth set in a tight line.
“Obviously,” Sherlock said, and turned to go.
And then his hot tongue delves inward, and Sherlock makes a high, desperate sound, flayed open and uncertain but definitely wanting more of
“Sherlock, you all right?”
“This is
He took the book up to bed with him, eventually laying it aside and falling asleep.  He slept soundly and without dreams, until--
“John Hamish Watson,” he said, and John tried not to jump out of his skin, because this was just something magicians could do: know your name without being told.  It didn’t help that his voice sounded like pure midnight crawling out of a panther’s throat.  Sherlock Holmes looked up at him, and John felt that he was being looked
“And what or who is this?”  the visitor inquired, just on the polite side of a sneer.
and wrapping around me, bare skin on skin. I gasp through my nose, arch into it. His hand is rough but good, friction-hot dragging over every nerve. He licks into my mouth, and I can feel the blood in my face, my heart pounding almost too hard, heels digging into the mattress.
He grunts, not looking up.
Things roll along to one of their many possible conclusions, Sherlock and me sitting in an Italian restaurant.  I order wine, because there is an edge that needs taking off.  I make small talk; asking Sherlock if he has a girlfriend feels extremely strange, since I know very well that he has only ever been single (speculation about his sexual identity is rampant; if he’s ever had sex, it was completely darked out), but it feels like the thing to say in the moment.  Something about my delivery must be off, though, because he thinks I’m chatting him up.  Am I chatting him up?  Would John Watson chat him up?
Sherlock sighed heavily and sat down in one of the two old armchairs that were drawn up near the hearth. He gestured for John to sit, as well. The chair was extremely comfortable, John found.
I get into the shower myself after Sherlock comes out. The tiny room is humid, all the mirrors steamed over. For a few minutes, I’m alone; I can think my own thoughts and feel my own feelings, and brace myself for whatever is coming. I’m going to let it come. I’m through fighting it.
“No, fine, you’re a criminal genius,” he says, waving his hand. “But here you are saying you’re an actor.
Yeah, nice, I think to myself. In a spiteful, chaotic, reckless sort of way.
“Tell me they’re wrong,” he says. “Tell me it’s a lie. I’ll believe you.”
“Would you let him fuck you? Get his knot up all inside you? Hmm? Fill you up?”
I learn that the kiss was not darked out, after all.  Everyone saw Sherlock kiss me, and saw me react like a confused teenager.  At the time, I thought my state of reciprocal arousal must have been obvious to everyone, but most of the other actors and staff seem to regard the event as a misguided assault on my undisputed heterosexuality.  Lestrade gives me a manly shoulder slap and a look of commiseration (did he and Sherlock ever display any chemistry?  I suddenly wish I could go back and review the old footage of their meeting), Donovan gives a sigh of amused pity for poor, confused Sherlock, and Mrs. Hudson seems to regard the whole thing as far too distasteful even to acknowledge.
. He would have drawn upon his connections to evade capture, perhaps to live out his days in some comfortable exile. But that story is over.
The cab stops.
“We’ve known each other a long time, you and I, haven’t we, Lestrade.” His tone of voice gives nothing away.
At the end of the day, he returned to the tower room. Sherlock’s room, strange beyond strange. The professors ate in the Great Hall, of course, so John was alone for supper, a circumstance which bothered him not at all. He cleared a space on a table near a window, magicked up his food from the kitchens, and ate it while the sun set over the lake, casting yellow beams across the towers and the castle grounds below.
“C’mere,” I say, and I scoot down and he scoots up, and he lies back and lets me open that top button at the hollow of his throat. I kiss him there, and he sighs. I keep kissing as I undo the rest of the buttons, all bones and hollows under my tongue, smooth skin under my hands, his dusting of reddish-dark chest-hair angled like a map. We get chest-to-chest again and he shivers, starved for touch.
McGonagall was the headmistress now, John knew, and when he sat down to write the next day, it felt perfectly natural to address her as such.
“Sherlock.” John lays his palm over Sherlock’s fist on the table. His eyes are squeezed shut, a deep furrow between his brows. He covers his eyes with his free hand and takes a slow breath.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “He did. But no, I didn’t make it. I made a useless, twinkly brown sludge. So if you’re looking for someone to cheat off of—“
And then I guess I smile a bit, and he smiles back—his real, crooked, cocky, eye-twinkling grin, just for me. We kiss more, and he pulls me close, but then I just want to get closer, so I break off the kiss and hug him tight, pressing my face into the warm hollow of his neck. He makes a low, contented sound and rests his cheek on my head. We stand that way for some time.
“You love it,” he says.
And with that John stalked away, leaving Mycroft frowning on the path.
“John! John Wason!”
.  So will you kindly just leave me alone!”
“John,” his voice is soft. “Jack.”
The sun was getting low in the sky by now, and most of the students in the library were packing up their things.
I go for a lot of walks. On one of them, a car pulls up next to me. It’s not one of Mycroft’s black cars, just a somewhat shabby little coupe, but when the window rolls down, I see it’s Mycroft’s PA. What’s her name. Anthea.
“Holly, stop,” said John, just as the wizard turned around and saw them.
“Where do you want to go?” I ask him. “Venice? Australia? The Andes?”
“Why, are you gonna tell him?” It’s easy to be cheeky when he’s only said what I’ve already been thinking.
“Hmm?”
“Nothing that will cause any harm,” Sherlock said.  “Just don’t lose it.”
“Oh?” Says Billy. “About Alex?”
“My dear fellow,” I interrupted him, turning over in his arms. “You may presume anything you like.” With that, I pressed my lips to his. He met my kiss with a soft sigh, his body relaxing against me. His lips opened sweetly to the touch of my tongue, and I kissed him deeply, heedless of his sleep-sour mouth and stubbled skin. Oh, the pleasure of it! Countless times I had imagined this, torturing myself with fantasies of the unobtainable, but nothing my poor brain had conjured could approach the true experience.
I must be as quiet as a mouse.  I must be as gentle as a summer breeze brushing the tops of the long grass.
“Sounds like you boys are okay?” he said.
John clears off a spot at the kitchen table and sets down his plate and cup. Sitting, he picks up the paper and snaps it open.
The case itself might be ridiculous, but the important thing is that it fits. It’s another clue from Moriarty, another reference to the stories of that other Sherlock Holmes. He wouldn’t miss it for the world.
, the deserter, the black sheep.  It would set a bad example.”
“You wouldn’t,” Mike said.  “They do mainly keep to themselves.”
“I’m not hiding,” Sherlock said. “The light’s good here.”
Understanding dawns. I scoot up his body to plant a kiss behind his ear. His hair is damp and smells of sandalwood. “I just want you to feel good. You don’t have to worry about anything else.” I can’t stop myself from giving him another gentle squeeze, and he makes a strangled sound. I sternly will my fingers to be still. “Do you want me to go on?”
he is,” Lestrade says, “which means
“Oh, I’m sure that won’t be a problem, but…isn’t there anything I can say to convince you?”
“Easy.” Steadying hand on his sacrum. Slow press inward, and John’s breathing is unsteady with what is, presumably, self-restraint, as he hasn’t gone so deep as to get past the dubious lubrication of his spit. Still, it’s enough to make Sherlock’s heart race with the awareness of just how thoroughly he is at John’s mercy, which is—mostly—good.
“But then I…I just couldn’t stand the thought that I might push you into doing something, or revealing something, when you were so, so lovely, and I was lying to you every second. It felt vile.”
There is one file on the USB drive, a PDF labeled “Partington_082420”.   He opens it.
“None of it makes any sense,” he goes on, his voice rough and quiet. “But I sometimes feel as though, somehow, I’m not really here. Like I’m an imaginary person. As though nothing I do really matters.”
Now John had met a fair few such people in his time.  They did, after all, work under government contracts in Afghanistan, doing things the regular corps would rather not know were being done.  In that country they kept their pointed ears covered to escape notice, but you could always tell them anyhow by the way their eyes seemed shadowed even in the sun.  This fellow took no trouble to hide what he was, perched lanky as a scarecrow on his stool, wearing a dark, old-fashioned suit of clothes that seemed designed to paint him as a creature of night.  Black hair curled untidily at the level of his sharp cheekbones, but even sharper stood the points of his ears, piercing through the black mass and catching the yellow light.
“Then, you did the right thing.  Good day, Mr. Wilson.”
“So ideally, you’d have hired another magician.  Except you don’t...deal with other magicians?”
Sherlock takes off walking fast, and I have to trot to catch up.
Thus relieved of my anxiety for his health, I was unfortunately left alone with an anxiety of quite a different nature. A curious honesty, indeed! Was I to understand that Holmes might welcome my attraction to him? I was well settled in my own feelings by now, and had made peace with the expectation that they would never be returned. Holmes had made it clear on many occasions that he prided himself on his ability to bend the urges of his body to the domination of his will. Even diving into the Thames was a part of that game. But then, how many times had I seen him miscalculate what privations his body could endure? Had he confessed another such miscalculation to me, just now?
“Goodbye, John. Sleep well.”
Inside the front door of the Diogenes club, we’re met by a beefy-looking suit with a military haircut and a scar over one eye.
Yeah. Definitely killing the mirror cam.
So Sherlock shoved in further, no more than an inch, but, oh,
Mycroft exhaled slowly, as though willing himself to calm.  “Not officially, no,” he admitted.  “But that doesn’t mean we want it to happen.”
Sherlock sniffed. “That’s not what people usually say.”
short one! I'll post another tomorrow.
, and John pressed close and let Sherlock take him in his arms. The tears were falling fast; he gritted his teeth against a sob.
I have to stop and think about it.  “I guess it doesn’t bother me,” I say.  “I mean I’m just acting, the same as you.”
“Oh, don’t pretend you would
You don’t honestly believe that, do you?”
“Fine,” said Mycroft, rising smoothly. By now the kettle had whistled, and John jumped to turn it off.  Mycroft spied him popping out of the pantry, and stopped in his tracks, regarding John with a strange expression.
“Stop,” said Sherlock. “Be still, John.”
.” He sits up slightly, peers at me with narrowed eyes.
The Moriarty Monologues,
Smells of bread and egg and fried butter, but the toaster hasn’t clicked. “Egg in a nest,” Sherlock says.
“Watson?” he breathed.
It was still dark, early morning, with a half moon staring in, and Sherlock was up, wrapped in a dressing gown, playing his violin near the window. But it wasn’t the violin that had woken him. He had been sleeping soundly, he felt, though he also remembered having a bad dream, and he knew the music had been with him when he slept. He lay still, listening to it. He knew the tune; knew it perfectly, note for note. But he couldn’t think what it was called or where he had heard it before.
“Doctor Wilson,” sighs Mycroft Holmes. “You may as well come out.”
Pay him! The very idea. He fumed over it for the rest of the afternoon, determined that he would never, ever be friends with Sherlock Holmes.
There’s only one thing I can do.
I look again and, yes, you can see the Bart’s rooftop from here, one edge of it, anyway.
“Richard Brook is the lynchpin. He slipped Sherlock a bit of reading material at the pool.”
“I used to think about doing this every night before I went to sleep,” John said.
“Well, I did some magic of course. I’m a magician, after all. It’s what I do.”
We play the scene.  Things get a little bit interesting: the sight of John draped in explosives has
!  And don’t spare the soft parts.  ”
“Not the way I do.” At right angles to me, he gazes into the middle distance. “Sherlock has given his heart to you entirely. Did you know that?”
The sight that met his eyes was strange indeed.  The door gave onto a large sitting room that would have been cozy were it not in such disarray.  Just now, though, all the furniture stood jumbled in the corners, and the rug had been rolled back to expose bare boards.  On these was scribed an elaborate pattern of circles, triangles, and arcane symbols, in the middle of which stood Sherlock Holmes, stripped to the waist.  John had heard rumors that magicians covered their bodies in protective tattoos, but that was not true of Sherlock; his skin was perfectly bare, nearly hairless and as pale as the moon.  He was thin, but not desperately so, lean muscles showing in his chest and in his arms, which he set akimbo as he addressed John.
Sherlock woke up mid-morning, still Alpha, to the sound of John taking a shower. He rolled over and hunkered down in the bed, feeling wretched. It wasn’t that he set much store by the notion of anniversaries (the length of a year was, after all, arbitrary), but it didn’t do to mess them up, either. They’d been having rather a good time until Sherlock decided to give free reign to his proclivities, and now he’d gone and pressed John too far.
“What, now?” John asked.  “There’s a case now?”
your personal assistant.”
Were they great? Sherlock supposed they were. His knot was subsiding a little. John pulled off of his cock and slithered semi-upright, leaning back on Sherlock’s chest to regard Greg, who came just inside the room and loitered by the door. He had on dark blue briefs and a half-buttoned shirt, and his forelock was slicked down with sweat.
I can’t help perking up my ears at that. VRS—Visual Receptive Surface—is the technology that allows them to film Sherlock from all angles without his being able to detect the equipment. Sherlock doesn’t know it exists. It turns an entire wall into a passively receptive mosaic of microscopic lenses, like an insect’s eye. A computer receives the combined signal and processes it to determine the focus of the image—usually Sherlock himself. It’s very expensive and time-consuming to install, and Sherlock’s London is liberally papered over with it. Almost literally so: busy wallpaper patterns help to conceal the unique nature of the surface. It’s not just Mrs. Hudson’s decorating style.
The conversation moved on to John’s job prospects, and Mike was able to give him a few leads.  John followed up on these as best he could, then did some grocery shopping.  When he got back to the flat, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen, so John passed the evening alone.  He resisted the urge to explore Sherlock’s inner sanctum, the first floor bedroom, but he did snoop thoroughly through the kitchen cupboards, moving things around enough to put away the shopping.  He shifted various coffers and jars of organic matter, some vegetable and some unmistakably animal in origin.  There didn’t seem to be any order to the way Sherlock kept his things, yet somehow he was certain Sherlock would not welcome his tidying up, so he only touched what he had to, leaving the rest in place (although he did pick up and admire, with a certain macabre satisfaction, a quart jar full to the brim with what appeared to be the desiccated eyeballs of goats).  Sherlock’s experiment of the morning was still laid out on the kitchen table, the three bowls now coated with different colored residues, so John ate his bachelor’s supper in one of the sitting room armchairs, gazing thoughtfully at the empty seat opposite.
“That’s not my name,” I reply.
Okay, fine, yes, what do I do?”
“Yes,” he says. “Just—again. Oh.”
“Want any?” John asks. “Sorry to wake you.”
his friend. John would just have to remind him of that fact.
“Why can’t you just use your own?”
“I anticipated it,” Sherlock said. “Actually, I sent a Needle-Nosed Flyer to her room. I’m surprised it didn’t reach her.”
“You thought my brother would find you a wife.”
They split a cab home from the station. When they get to John’s house, Mary is out on the pavement, walking up and down with Livy fussing in her carrier. Trying to get the baby to fall asleep, Sherlock supposes. As John approaches them, Sherlock sees Livy’s face light up with a huge, toothless smile. John smiles back just as brightly, lifts the baby out of the carrier and hugs her, hugs his wife. Before the cab drives off, Sherlock sees the three of them silhouetted in the yellow light of their doorway as they go inside.
“God, Sherlock, I’m—“
“If I’d been happy there, you wouldn’t have found me in Croydon. No, I was unspeakably bored. I ran away back to London and started using a false name.  And that’s when I—well. That’s when I started misbehaving. It was a way to make money, at first.”
But John is also—well. Merely being the lodestone to Sherlock’s sexual compass is not a valid argument in his defense, but it’s more than that, surely. John
“God,” said John.
“But you trusted me?” John asked.
He gives a tight half-smile. Then the waiter comes to take our plates away, and leaves the dessert menu. I could do without it, myself, but Sherlock is keen, so we stay. I order a chocolate mousse or something. Sherlock gets a fancy ice cream assortment. Mine is fine, undistinguished. Sherlock takes a bite of his, and—pauses. Takes another bite, his brow wrinkled in concentration.
The next few days pass in a mad blur. They’ve got Moriarty in prison, supposedly. I can’t imagine he’s really sitting in there, though. It’s not as though they let us in to visit. All I know is that he is definitely
“So, it was okay,” John said, pressing his face to Sherlock’s chest. “It was just crazy. I didn’t even know I could feel like that.”
“Yes, strange. Singular. Outlandish.” His voice is getting louder, but he doesn’t care. “It’s perplexing, really. Bloody inexplicable, isn’t it, how anyone could want to—“
So: necessary. And yet so terribly unpleasant to be the one causing John distress. It’s a relief to finally abandon scientific detachment and go and let John out of the lab and explain the illusion. John recovers quickly, pulling himself together with his usual gorgeous strength of will. Sherlock spares a moment to admire it before getting on with commandeering some lab space. If he can identify the compound in the sugar, he may be able to trace its origin, and then they’ll know who killed Henry’s father. He has to move quickly, as there’s a good chance his entering Baskerville has alerted the killer that he’s close to a solution, and it wouldn’t do to have the perpetrator force a confrontation before the proof has been secured.
“Of course I’m bloody angry, Sherlock. You disappeared, with hardly a word, for—for
“What about?” John didn’t have a problem with Slytherins, generally, but he was not interested in being enlisted for any kind of scheme, and this had a rather scheme-ish flavor about it.
Nowadays, casual objectification of Omegas was much less acceptable than it once had been (indeed, it was almost nonexistent among the younger generation), but there was no denying the effect that an Omega in heat could have on any Alphas who caught a whiff of them. John wasn’t in any actual danger—or not much, anyway—both because he was tough and because norms of Alpha behavior had improved since the change. But the few times that he had tried going about his ordinary life during his heat, the distorted attention from Alphas had been disruptive enough to discourage him from doing so on a regular basis. These days, if he had to go out, Sherlock would go with him to fend them off. Sherlock was always Alpha during John’s heats—an effect of pheromones, he supposed—and he took more enjoyment then he probably should have from raising his figurative hackles at any competitor who looked sideways at his…well, his mate, apparently. John’s feelings were more mixed, but that was to be expected.
“I’ll manage,” he grimaces. “Anyhow, train travel is supposed to be quite pleasant.”
Sherlock did stop, to John’s relief.  “I suppose,” he said.  “Yes, I imagine you’re right.  Bloody Mycroft, we’ll have to re-hang the pictures.  Knocked down the rowan berries, too, I’ll bet.”
“And what if I’d rather not come along?”
“No,” John said. “It was the oddest thing. They actually took away my clothes. But when I woke up naked in that dungeon, there it was in my hand.”
Holmes laughed, an uneven bark made strange by his shivering. “Oh, I don’t regret it on account of the case. The case is solved. I only mean that I regret squandering such a tender embrace on so trifling a thing as having my life saved.”
“John?” he said.  “Are you quite well?”  He touched the backs of his fingers to John’s forehead, a light, cool touch.
. Not much was taboo in the post-Change world, but a few things remained that could still raise eyebrows. John would be willing enough to go along with what Sherlock wanted, he thought, but Sherlock had to make sure that he enjoyed it.
Sherlock hardly spoke to John for the rest of that week. John wasn’t quite sure what had gone wrong; it seemed like working the Blessing together had screwed up their friendship somehow.
“Sherlock?” she prompts.
“So what do you need to talk to him about?”
“Why? Do you like it?” Sherlock said.
I wake up early the next morning, feeling jittery and strung-out.  I get up and make tea, and cook breakfast for two, and practically crawl out of my skin waiting for Sherlock to wake up so I can try to explain my rejection in a way that will soothe his hurt feelings (if any) without either promising too much or giving away the game.
He hadn’t known he was going to say it, but it was utterly true. Sherlock froze.
Let us now, as though by a scrying charm, cast our vision into the quarters they share. We see first that the room is round, topmost in the southwest tower of the faculty wing, for Professor Holmes likes privacy, and Watson likes the view of the lake and the open hills, rolling away and away. There is a rumor—an untrue one, though they have never denied it—that they turn themselves into ravens and fly about the grounds on fine autumn evenings.
“What? Really?” He completely forgot to try to sound like it was no big deal.
“Yeah.”
“Oh! My God, not that I’m implying anything like that.” She leans in close again and looks up at me through her eyelashes. “Ten to one, you’re into women.”
John examined the letter with bemusement. Sherlock probably could have deduced what was in it just by looking at the outside. John, mere mortal that he was, could only guess, but he thought he had a pretty fair idea. Not so alien after all, maybe.
“It’ll get better,” Sherlock says. “At twelve weeks they start smiling at you.”
“Mm, quite.”
for being kind enough to beta read the second half and let me know their thoughts. I probably don't have to tell you that Chryse writes phenomenally awesome fic.
“Sounds a bit like my billet,” John said.  He meant it to be a joke, but Sherlock’s frown only deepened.
“Yes?”
“Have I?”
“Be quiet,” I said.
I scoop up a bit of the light brown ice cream on the end of my spoon. When I taste it, I catch myself pausing just as Sherlock did, compelled by the dance of flavors across my tongue, cream and dark caramel and zesty volatiles, and then the little, buttery crunch of the nuts.
“All right,” said Sherlock. He released John’s cock to trace a slick finger back across his perineum. John tensed fractionally more, but he didn’t flinch away. “Can I?”
[ Plot point: John forgets his twig and is kidnapped by one of Sherlock’s enemies]“What does it do?”
And next thing I know, I’m being ushered into the lab at this world’s version of St. Barts, and into the presence of Himself.  I see a dark-haired person leaning over a microscope, he looks up, and—bam, it’s him.  It’s Sherlock Holmes, the center of my new universe.  In person, he’s…different.  Not quite as tall, not quite as flawless.  I’m almost disappointed for a second, but then he meets my eyes.
What the phone does have is software. There’s an app called Blick, and another called K2K. Both are entirely opaque in the their design. Blick shows a long list of eight-digit numbers, any of which can be selected or deselected, to no apparent effect. K2K shows a single button which toggles between red and green when touched.
He looked askance at that last, wondering if it sounded too desperate. Well, it was written now, and he hated to waste parchment. He signed it
“I hope he will.”
you have a familiar, then?  An animal one?”
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Go. I’ll meet you later. Before you go back to London.”
It stings far more than it should.
John touches a finger to his jaw, then, and Sherlock jumps at the contact, not wanting to lose focus. But that gentle finger strokes down his neck, down his chest over his tee shirt, down to the tie of his dressing gown, which John unties with a single, deft movement. And then John is—Jesus—touching his cock, caressing him through a single thin layer of cotton, and he hadn’t known how much he needed just
. “John,” Sherlock grits out. He means it to sound stern, but doesn’t quite get there, and then John is kissing him, cooling his heated cheeks with the soft touch of his fingers.
“Sher—“ I gasp, not sure what I’m pleading for, but then he leans down close and, oh, fuck, lips around my cock, tongue intricately working, fingers wrapping tight around my shaft.
reading Arthur Conan Doyle.”
“What is it for?”  John asked.
So begins the hardest period of my life with Sherlock so far, two long months during which we fail spectacularly, over and over again, at making up. Sherlock has pretty clearly decided that if we’re ever going to so much as hold hands again, it’s me that has to make the first move. I, of course cannot capitulate to these tactics. If anything, it’s worse than it was before; even fighting with him is dishonest, and surrendering doubly so.
I know exactly what he’s referring to. Greg was cast in the Bad Old Days, when Sherlock had given up trying to make sense of his desperately lonely teenaged life and was trying every drug he could get his hands on in search of numbness and distraction. There was a moment when Greg had tracked Sherlock to a grimy dosshouse and found him unconscious with a needle still in his arm. He took the pitiful creature home with him, fed him up, got him clean—and gave him his calling. The public fucking loved it.
,” corrected her friend. “And, obviously, it’s because he couldn’t hear himself with those things on his ears, whatever they are.”
There are three chief means by which Mycroft controls the panopticon.
So Sherlock pushed inside, against some slight resistance.
Lestrade shrugs. “Brook, one way or another. He says Sherlock won’t act yet, but he’ll believe it, after this. It’s almost over. We’ve lost.”
“It was—well. Mum had it taken down. She said she always felt like it was looking at her.”
“Ta very much, but I think we’ll be okay. Our room has an armchair I can kip on, if His Nibs decides he wants to actually sleep in a bed for once.”
“Would you like that?” I lean in close to lick his ear. “Just keep you on the edge, get you all…slack and…pliant—“
, do you mean the person who…who got you out?”
Sherlock stares at John open-mouthed. Even if he hadn’t deleted most of British military history, he’s fairly certain this is more obscure than the solar system. Lady Stoner, beside him, is equally amazed.
it, don’t wait for me to—“
“I hope so, too. And I’m doing what I can to see that it’s so. Will you do the same?”
, John thought.
“Um. Yes,” says Sherlock.
“Yes.”  Breathless, unequivocal. I get a sudden glimpse of our future, and it knocks the breath out of me, the thought that I could have this, have
They were elsewhere.  Grey pavement, dingy walls.  An alley.  John watched as Sherlock took his hand from the wall, and he could see where the old plaster of the building had been chipped away to reveal a stone built into the wall, slashed with Ogham marks.  John stared.
“Quite agree. So, what does that leave? Have you ever—“
“Ask him what he’s wearing,” Sherlock said. It was slang, a way to ask whether Lestrade was presently Alpha or Omega.
“You are still powerful,” Mycroft said, more quietly.  “Anyone defeating you would gain the respect of his peers.  And they’d have a card to play against the Holmses--”
Eventually, Sherlock clears his throat. “You know, I—I wasn’t sure what to tell Vanessa about—about beds, and things. But given these developments, I thought perhaps we might not…not need the other one.”
“Oh, ’s good,” he said. “God, I want you, do it, please.”
“The golden rule? What’s that?”
She sighs, and for just a moment, I think I see some shadow of her true self. “We do want that, yes. But you must know that he won’t survive intact, not really. He’s a storybook character. He’s lived all his life by storybook rules.”
“First of all,” Mycroft said, “I really must insist that you stop interfering with my scrying. You know perfectly well that it’s for your own safety and protection.”
“Well, Mycroft did look out for the important stuff,” I joke. And oh, shit, let’s please not let that little comment spoil the mood.
“I don’t—“
“See you later,” John said to Greg, all innocence. Sherlock grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him out of the office without waiting to hear Greg’s reply. He let go again once they were out, but John followed him closely as he stalked toward the loo which was, thankfully, unoccupied. Once inside, Sherlock crowded John up against the back of the door so that he could bury his nose in the fragrant warmth of John’s neck.
So it’s me who gets to tell Sherlock that Moriarty’s back.
“Take this with you,” he said, handing the vial to John. “Everyone’s potions will go into the school’s stores, to be used in case of need. But you have worked doubly hard and, as you are going into the healing profession, you may one day find it useful.”
Sherlock grinned crookedly, still holding John close by his waist. “You thought every night about doing this, or you thought about—about doing this every night?”
“Yeah, I know, I can see you. What’s going on?” At last I get a little clear space. People have recognized me, realized who I’m talking to. They’re looking at me, now, listening. In the quiet, I can hear the sound of a helicopter.
A dozen faces turn in my direction, and there’s a general surge of bodies toward the steps. I run back into the building, lock the door, and crouch down with my back against the wooden lower half.
“And later?”
the day before.
“I’m not doing anything,” Sherlock said flatly.
“Surely you can make an educated guess.”
“If I am so bloody brilliant,” I grind out, “then why couldn’t I figure out the one thing that mattered?” It’s the final question, the worst question, that I haven’t dared to utter before now, not even to John. Especially not to him.
going to cry. He sucked Sherlock’s tongue into his mouth. He levered up on one elbow, pushing Sherlock up with him, and gave Sherlock’s hair a good tug with his free hand. Sherlock whimpered a little, and reached for John’s cock. John mirrored him, breaking free of the kiss so that he could take little bites of his neck and shoulders while he stroked him. He looked down at Sherlock’s cock in his hand, all rosy-red and ready for its work.
“And they didn’t want to risk getting stuck doing the Blessing with her, in case it messed up their potions.”
into the search bar. He knows what he’ll get: a few thousand results, his own website as the top hit, then John’s blog, then a few hackish news stories, then blogs and forum posts and fan sites.
“Mm.  My Boswell.”  He lolls awkwardly against me, but I hardly notice.  The hairs on my arms are all standing up.  I am lost without my Boswell.  It’s a quotation from “A Scandal in Bohemia,” by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Until I realize with a chill that he isn’t always
“Stand here,” I said to Holmes, steering him to stand beside the chimney. Quickly, I heaved his wet ulster over a rafter to drip and pulled the pallet as close as I could to our only source of warmth. I then set about undressing my companion. He had become listless, and at first did nothing to help me; though after a moment he seemed to come to himself a little, and shrugged out of the overcoat as I lifted it from his shoulders. Jacket, waistcoat, tie, and shirt followed; then shoes, stockings, trousers, singlet and drawers, all soaking wet and cold to the touch. Even in the dim light, I could make out Holmes standing nude before me, his skin pale and cold as a fish. Of course, there could be nothing to inflame the senses in such a grim circumstance. I fell easily into my habit of medical detachment with regard to the human form, and felt no inappropriate stirrings, not even when considering what I was about to do next.
“You sure you need that?” I ask, as he pops the white pill out of its blister pack. “It might not be as bad as you remember, and you’ll want to be clear-headed.”
“For what?”
“No?” said Sherlock.
I'm delighted that things turned out so I could post this chapter on my birthday! :-D Happy explicit gay sex day to me!
There are no cameras in the flat—he’s been over it a thousand times. So how?
“No,” Sherlock said. “I’ll be fine.” He took hold of John’s hand and kissed the inside of his wrist, letting his teeth graze the tender skin. John exhaled shakily, meeting Sherlock’s eyes with a hot gaze.
“Isn’t he good?” he said.
Lestrade smiled warmly. “Well,” he chuckled, “John did say you might pop out of the woodwork.”
“Uh, not exactly,” John said.
“Well, at first I didn’t think that you’d get out—at least, not before…well. At first I guess I assumed that they’d engineer an exit for me, eventually. Or a partial exit, you know. Like in the canon.”
“Oh! That’s the let’s-please-not-discuss-this ‘Sherlock’. Why? Afraid you’ll break me?”
Nobody has seen or heard anything of Sherlock, or any of the rest of the cast, except for Brook, who has been on the right side all along and is now enjoying life as a beloved public figure. His face is everywhere: interviews, chat shows, speaking engagements, film roles. He has stated that Sherlock is being housed in a secret location, and is receiving psychological help. He has begged the public to respect Sherlock’s privacy during this difficult time. I am grateful to him for that, although I can’t help hating him, a little, for having profited so much from engineering all of this.
“Sherlock?”
John nodded, and squeezed his hand.
“Ngh, this
I am not sure I would have given you my address if I had realized how vapid your communiques would be. To answer your questions: fine, yes, no, yes (unfortunately), and I like mince pies, as well.
“Professor Snape,” she said, “may I speak to you?”
, it was working. It was done. Just the tip, in the hot, unrelenting constriction of the inside of shivering, gasping Alpha John.
“No, no, it isn’t that. I think the next time I’m free would be Monday afternoon.”
The few minutes before Greg arrived gave them just enough time to set up a spy camera on the bedside table. Sherlock took his laptop up to John’s old bedroom—now a trifle musty with disuse and cluttered with odds and ends—and settled in on the bed to load up the feed. The camera angle left a little to be desired, but the sound pickup would be good. In fact, even now he was getting some sound from it as John padded out to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water. He could hear the real sounds of it as well, floorboards creaking and water hissing in the pipes. Ordinary and not.
“Oh, yeah,” said John, with such slow and catlike relish that the other two laughed.
“God, Sherlock. I could do this to you all night.”
Well, except. Sherlock, still pleased with himself and oblivious to my state of nerves, is holding my hand on the middle seat of the cab. I’m on his side, obviously. Maybe I just hate that I’m not the one making the big moves. Mycroft and Moriarty are the players, and Sherlock’s life is the game. I don’t think I even rise to the level of pawn. Just an inconvenient lump of detritus on the board, waiting to see how it all turns out. Having a hand to hold is not unwelcome.
“You can—erm. You can talk about that here?”
woman…
John had already been planning to spend another night at the inn, but suddenly he had to fight off the urge to leap back onto his broomstick and flee back to London. But at the same time, somehow, the hours until half seven passed incredibly slowly. He walked around Hogsmeade, had tea, tried to read a book in his room and failed, had a firewhiskey, had another firewhiskey—and that’s where Sherlock found him, sitting at the bar. Two drinks was nothing, though. He ordered a third before following Sherlock off to a corner table.
Sherlock glanced at him, then away, then back again as though surprised that John was actually there.
I wonder if I’ve heard her right. “They can do that?”
“Suit yourself.”
And with that, she sashays out of the room.  Her pretty assistant casts an amused look my way as she leaves.
“No,” John agrees, breathless.
“’S good,” he said. “Move more.”
“Yeah,” John says. “The red one.”
The silence goes on and on, only slightly broken by an occasional rustle of cloth or unintelligible whisper, until, clear as a bell, Sherlock’s rough voice can be heard: “John, oh, don’t stop, my God.”
“You don’t even know you’re doing it, do you?” Her voice had taken on a kindly, almost pitying tone.
Just then there’s a knock at the door.
“I really do love you,” I say, again. My voice, unthinking.
Billy doesn’t answer, but Gary gives a significant glance toward the garishly papered wall above the lounge fireplace, off to my left.
Lady Stoner meets them in a high-ceilinged parlour, the walls lined with books that have clearly been chosen for their appearance rather than their contents. The house is furnished in historical style, but not terribly well kept up. Lady Stoner is the only member of the family still in residence. According to Sherlock’s research, her husband has divorced her and her two daughters and one son have finished their education and moved very far away.
His eyes narrow. “You admitted that you hadn’t exchanged manual stimulation with a man before.”
Lestrade frowned. “Will you want to? I mean, I kind of assumed this was all part of — all that.”
“Protection!” Sherlock scoffed. “I can protect myself very well, and you know it.”
“I could knot you like this,” Sherlock said. “Would that be too much? I think you’d like it. Imagine if I speared you like a hungry little Omega slut, hmm? I could shove you open and come in your belly. Leave you wide open and dripping when I pull my cock out.”
“This,” he says, then straightens to show me a small clump of fluttery grey ash cupped in his gloved palm. I’ve been around long enough to know what it is.
Another minute passes in silence.
“Fine,” said John, darting out from under Sherlock’s hand.  His eyes snapped up from where they had been gazing about the level of Sherlock’s chest, and he was struck anew by the strange elegance of Sherlock’s features, the oddness of his hidden eyes.
John’s breath, his breathing, kicking up again.
“I love you,” John said. And that, also, was true. And so Sherlock was content, after all.
Sherlock breaks away first, lets the tip of his nose brush down my cheek.
While he’s tapping away on his phone, I spot a piece of paper lying on the floor near the sofa.  I pick it up.  It’s a phone number…the slip of paper left by Molly’s erstwhile boyfriend, Jim, aka Moriarty, aka old-school Sherlockian and stage phenom, Richard Brook.  Sherlock has written in a string of letters above the numbers, some of them underlined:
John Watson is a man of action. That’s the whole point of my existence, the one immutable facet of my personality that makes my relationship with Sherlock work. While the streets of Sherlock’s London pass outside the cab windows, grey and streaky, every fiber of my being is twitching with the urge to do
“Not in so many words, but it’s pretty obvious if you know him at all. You’re lucky, you haven’t had to deal with him much outside of his on-screen character. He treats me like a bloody dog, in production meetings all the time, planning out the cases and clues for Sherlock. He blames me if things go off the rails. I’m cracking, to be honest.” He pauses to rub his face with one hand before going on. “This shit with Moriarty is the last straw. I almost hope the bastard wins if it means the end of this bloody terrible job.”
“Just come. In fact, just wait here and I’ll fetch you.”
“You touched this,” he says.
“You saw what you expected to see because I told you,” he says, at last. “You have been drugged. We have all been drugged.”
“It’s what I do,” Sherlock answered.  “I’m a private detective of sorts.  A consulting magician.”
“I don’t know that, either. ” He keeps his eyes fixed on the road ahead, a muscle twitching in his jaw.
“She was vague on that point,” Sherlock says. “But she was…convincing. She told me to come here if I needed answers.”
“Why?”
“What do you think?”
“No,” Sherlock whirled to regard him.  “No, that’s exactly the point.  You don’t
“My fault,” Sherlock said. “Soundproofing charm, keeps noise out as well as in. I’ll modify it so you can hear me coming next time.”
The way he’s draped over me feels like it might almost work. Carefully, I withdraw my fingers, then try to line up his hips, but we’ll never get anywhere like this; the angle makes it too complicated, and I can’t believe we’re getting hung up on fucking logistics when every nerve in my body is—
“Only indirectly,” he says. “It’s Billy, my boyfriend—oh, speak of the devil.”
It’s unmistakably the same piece that I carried while I was inside: the one that shot Jefferson Hope, the one that’s always protected Sherlock. It feels good to have it with me again. Together, we continue the search.
“Lord,” he breathed, when we parted a little. “I never guessed.”
“Yeah, so does everybody else in the world.”
“All those Alpha cops. Lestrade. They know you need it. They know you’re in here, getting fucked. Wondering if they can fuck you when I’m done.”
We come out into a little side street, nearly deserted, of nice old row houses. Sherlock glances back and forth, getting his bearings, then makes for one of the buildings. There’s an intercom, but Sherlock ignores it, opting instead to smash out one of the door’s glass panes with his elbow so that he can reach in to undo the bolt. We go up to a second floor flat. Sherlock knocks. A couple of beats pass while we listen for movement inside, and then Sherlock tries the door. It isn’t locked.
“All of it,” Sherlock says. “All of it. Everything.”
But he was already getting up to leave, thereby cutting the argument short.
There’s a guy who brings a hamper of groceries and takes our laundry away now and then, and Sherlock’s therapist visits once a week. He’s an older man who wears jumpers, but other than that I don’t know anything about him. Sherlock is understandably anxious that we don’t run into each other, so I usually go for long walks when they have their appointments, which is fine. More than fine. He needs someone to talk to other than me.
Sherlock grimaced. “Well, it’s only a guess,” he said. He halted.
“Oh,” John said. His anger was deflating rapidly. “So, did you—how was Romania? Did you go to school there?”
“I’ve always thought so,” Sherlock said. He pulled John into a tight hug. John hugged back, and let Sherlock hold him for a while. Eventually they shifted down into the bed again. John sought Sherlock’s lips, maybe just to say goodnight, but once he started kissing Sherlock, he found he didn’t want to stop. Sherlock seemed to be of the same mind. John pulled open the tie of Sherlock’s dressing gown, found him naked and hard beneath. He pressed close, and Sherlock moaned. They rubbed together, hot and languid, until Sherlock wormed a hand between them to grab and stroke John’s cock against his own. John hadn’t expected to come again, but the orgasm welled up sweetly, hot all over his body, and Sherlock gasped and shuddered and spilled against him at the same time. Afterward, Sherlock provided a clean-up charm (not the same as a bath, but neither of them felt much like trekking down the tower stairs), and then John had the remarkable pleasure of feeling Sherlock fall asleep in his arms before he, too, succumbed.
