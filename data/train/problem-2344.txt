'You look so beautiful Sherlock, your mind is amazing and, despite what you may think, you are the most wonderful caring man I’ve ever met’ Tears had started to well up in Sherlock’s eyes as John spoke; John took the  wine glasses that had been hanging from the detectives hands and put them on the counter behind Sherlock.
‘I was stupid before’ John said ‘I tried to hide how I felt, I should have known we’d be amazing together… we always have been’ Sherlock had started to well up again; John kissed him ‘I love you so much’.
There was a knock on the door and Sherlock almost tripped in his haste to open it, quickly remembering his robe he took a breath and opened the door calmly, even if he actually wanted to rip it off its hinges with impatience.
‘Me too, it’s nice to get out and have dinner just the two of us sometimes’ he paused and saw Sherlock blush slightly still not quite making eye contact ‘I’ve got some wine upstairs if you’d like?’
John took in his flushed face and poorly concealed arousal and smirking stalked into the room and shutting the door behind him. 'Well this is quite a welcome' He flicked the lock closed and turned back to face his prey. 'I'd have come earlier if I knew you would start without me. Still I couldn't possibly be upset given the astoundingly beautiful picture you make'. He had reached Sherlock now and his hand lifted and wound into the soft black curls using them to direct their lips together. The kiss started gently but soon John deepened it, using his tongue he teased Sherlock, always dominating the young man but never harshly or in a way Sherlock didn't long for. John broke the kiss suddenly leaving Sherlock dazed. 'What were you thinking about Sherlock? Were you thinking about yesterday or about what we would do tonight?' He pushed the robe off Sherlock’s shoulders and his hands skimmed over his chest and across his hard nipples as John kissed him softly, kicking the robe away.
He remembered the fall, his hand faltered slightly at the memory before putting the tin away; sometimes he wished he didn’t remember the years he grieved for Sherlock, the pain of losing him had forced John into a marriage he thought would complete his life.
'Obviously I have no objection but you can't possibly leave now, not after all that, please John I want to please you too' Sherlock would have dropped to his knees but John stopped him.
'Both' Sherlock gasped 'I've relived last night over countless times since you left but I started to think about how I could make you happy tonight' Sherlock let John pull his head down again and devour him before pulling back slightly. 'I want to suck your cock' he whispered, a hairs breadth between them he could see as John's jaw flexed and his pupils dilated entirely 'please John?’
As John put away the shopping he found he couldn’t quite remember when these feelings had started, he remembered the first night when he tried to ascertain the sexuality of his new flatmate and the slight disappointment at finding out Sherlock was ‘married to his work’.
Sherlock had never felt anything as amazing as having John suck his cock, every time he took Sherlock in he went slightly deeper until he almost gagged, pulling back slightly the doctor bobbed his head up and down, pulling off to pay extra attention to the head occasionally.
'I've no need of your name to know all; I can clearly see in your appearance every detail that led you to this room tonight. Your time in the military and the injury to your left shoulder, the failed marriage to a woman who could never understand your wants and needs; even the unsuccessful search you've gone through to find someone who can give you the thrill you haven't felt since being discharged.' His eyes swept back up Johns body to his face 'If given enough time I could even tell you your own name, but it would be simpler if you introduced yourself.'
With a whine Sherlock felt John pull back before thrusting fully into him in one motion. He angled his hips until he found the small bundle inside Sherlock that made him cry out with pleasure and his prick jump; John had found his aim.
John made sure to keep the first kiss gentle, not sure how experienced Sherlock was at this, he didn’t want the younger man to get overwhelmed. They pulled back slightly, John watched with awe as Sherlock opened his eyes and with a slight gasp of wonder gave him the biggest smile possible. Before either of them could speak, Sherlock’s hands, which had been hanging onto the kitchen counter for dear life, came up to the front of John’s shirt and yanked him back up for another deeper kiss, Sherlock may have lacked finesse but his enthusiasm  more than made up for it.
'Wh…What is it John…you can tell me anything’ Sherlock looked down to the doctors lips and unconsciously licked his own, that sight alone made John start to feel hot.
'Call me John, Sherlock, I want to hear you.' John plucked again at his chest and moved his hand across to the other side for the same torment 'I would torture you Sherlock, tie you down and bite and suck here until you were raw from it.'
'Oh God Sherlock you're perfect' His thrusts getting quicker and harder 'You look so amazing like this baby, so beautiful' Sherlock had been hard since John walked into the room but now his neglected cock wept and jumped with every compliment given him, with every pull on his hair and thrust into his throat he got closer and closer to his release. Even with spit and precum dribbling down his chin and tears welling up in his eyes John was pleased with him. He closed his eyes and felt his prick stiffen even more.
'Would you like it if it kissed you here?' John's finger brushed around Sherlock’s right areola, the younger man flinched and whined reaching down to stroke his aching cock but John caught his hand quickly and, taking the other wrist too, pushed it gently behind Sherlock’s back and held them tight with one hand. He backed Sherlock up against the wall and pinned him between it and his relentless hands.
Angelo bought over a candle 'makes it more romantic’ he winked, Sherlock waited for the standard 'I’m not his date’ but was surprised when the doctor just chuckled and ordered a bottle of wine. As he left Sherlock looked to John still slightly shocked only to see John calmly reading the menu, perhaps he’d imagined it, or perhaps John had just let it pass rather than try to correct him, Sherlock tried to calm himself as he looked at the menu.
'Yes Doctor, please!' Sherlock was breathless and needy and his voice betrayed him as he tried to lose one hand and give himself some relief.
‘Oh Sherlock, its ok.’ John noticed the tears rolling down Sherlock’s cheek; he pulled the detective into his arms ‘What’s wrong love?’
The noises Sherlock was making had John harder than he could ever remember being, his hands went to Sherlock’s hips as he lifted off the sofa and rubbed his clothed erection over Sherlock’s plump arse.  Sherlock let out a shrill cry that sounded very similar to John’s name, the doctor lowered his hips to the sofa and unbuttoned the rest of Sherlock’s shirt; as Sherlock divested himself of the clothing John lifted both his jumper  and vest over his head.
He wanted to make this the best John had ever had, he wasn't the most experienced but he was desperate to make it good. He kissed the head and took just the tip into his mouth sucking lightly; he used his tongue along the rim and John's hands tightened in his hair as he groaned with pleasure. A slight pushing on his head and he was taking more of John in. When he was almost half way it hit his throat, John pulled out to the tip and pushed back into his mouth, Sherlock tried to relax his throat and breathe through his nose and after a few tries he took John slightly deeper.
‘Yes John, please! Please fuck me, I need you’ Sherlock straightened his arms and tried to push his ass closer to John. The doctor laughed once, a harsh pleased sound and pressed the tip of his cock against Sherlock. He pushed steadily until at once the head was inside, surrounded by tight glorious heat. John gasped as Sherlock whined clutching at the ties which bound him. He pushed forward slowly, retreating almost to the tip before going deeper with each push. Once he was fully engulfed by Sherlock’s body he took the man’s legs again, bending him almost in two he ground into the tight channel. He lent up to kiss the man, both groaning deep as John sat within him.
The bedroom curtains are open and the sunlight peeks through the window panes but Sherlock is sure the warmth is from within as he holds John’s face close to his own heart, John’s fresh tears hot against his skin. He wants to preserve this moment forever on a slide for later microanalysis, but he isn’t finished talking, and he knows there is at least one more thing he needs to tell John.
“The only reason I married Mary in the first place was that I didn’t think you felt things that way. So you have to understand, Sherlock, I have been in love with you for a very long time now.
ones. He is unaccustomed to being on the receiving end of elaborate ruses, and he isn’t sure that he likes the idea. The kitchen smells heavenly, though, so he’s maybe willing to trust that whatever John has up his sleeve isn’t hazardous. John leads him through the kitchen into the sitting room, turns him around so that he is facing the kitchen again, and removes the blindfold.
“Doesn’t it, though?” John whispers back into Sherlock’s ear. John was unaware that he needed this sort of healing, but he doubts that there is a shaman alive who can concoct a more potent elixir than Sherlock Holmes’ breath in his ear and hard cock pressed against his and tongue exploring his mouth. “Let’s take this somewhere slightly more comfortable, if that’s alright,” he whispers.
John hadn’t planned on being a dad just yet, and he’d always taken precautions to make sure that wouldn’t happen. Even after he and Mary were engaged, he’d made sure they used condoms every time, even though they really didn’t have sex all that frequently. Mary wanted to, surprisingly often, but John had had a difficult time putting his whole heart into the act.
He knows me too well, for he opens one eye, squinting at the late afternoon sun peeking through our window and groans, “Smashed glass, remember? That’s all in the past now. We’re here now, and we’re going to make the most of it.”
Both men would of course jump at the chance to snuggle the tiny girl, but Sherlock agrees that it is John’s turn. John unbuttons his shirt and heads toward the recliner that seems to have made a permanent home at Rosie’s bedside - that, or a nurse was thoughtful enough to bring it over in anticipation of their visit. Rebecca moves to open Rosie’s isolette and keeps her lines from tangling while John picks her up and cradles her on his bare skin. Sherlock fetches a warm blanket for both of them –
Doctor Bell leads John down a maze of corridors and blinding lights, though John isn’t sure the lights are blinding him as much as the grey fucking fog in which he currently finds his brain. He recognizes her face, lips gone pale from blood loss, lifeless face gone even paler. Her crooked appendectomy scar, and the scars on both knees from too much football in uni. He feels nothing for her, no need to say goodbye.
“I believe I wasn’t done undressing you, Mister Holmes,” John says with an impish grin as he moves to unbutton Sherlock’s trousers. With a lift of his hips, Sherlock assists John in shucking them off and tossing them onto the hardwood floor. John slips one finger down each side of Sherlock’s pants and slips them down just enough so that the head of Sherlock’s cock peeks out. Sherlock begs, pleads with John to just take the damn pants off, for God’s sake, so John obliges and Sherlock is finally gloriously naked, and nothing John has seen in his prior four decades has prepared him for this. Sherlock, fully nude on their bed, a porcelain god if there ever was one, curls disarrayed around his head and writhing in desperation
Victoria wipes a tear or two out of her eyes before facing the audience and continuing. “Although the husbands are not Jewish themselves, they have elected to include one more meaningful Jewish ceremony today. In a Jewish wedding, it is a joyful end to the ceremony when the groom breaks the glass. Breaking the glass has a twofold significance for John and Sherlock, the first being that as the glass is smashed, so are all the regrets of your pasts. The second meaning, the traditional Jewish one, is that your bond is as permanent as the shattered glass. As there are two grooms, it feels fair that since John Watson-Holmes initiated the wedding kiss, Sherlock Holmes-Watson will be the one to break the glass by stomping it. As you do this, Sherlock, this is the wish we have for you both: May your love sustain you and keep you together for as long as it takes for the pieces of glass to come back together. In other words, may you stay together forever.”
Rosie breathes peacefully on her own for several minutes before beginning to wiggle and thrash in John’s arms, gasping and making mewling noises like a newborn kitten. Rebecca recognizes this as a sign of pain and possibly air hunger and draws up a tiny dose of morphine in an oral syringe, then places drops of it under Rosie’s tongue to be absorbed by the membranes in her mouth. She then removes the blanket currently draped over Rosie and replaces it with another blanket from the blanket warmer in order to keep Rosie as warm as possible.
When Sherlock and I first became lovers, I had to tell him about Sholto. I think he suspected something, based on what he had learned at my wedding to Mary. I was trying to make the effort to be completely open with him about my past – about my combat nightmares, about my past boyfriends and girlfriends, about my family – about everything. So I had to tell him about Sholto. There wasn’t a whole lot to tell, since we were only together for a while in Afghanistan, before I got shipped home and we lost touch. But I didn’t hold anything back from Sherlock. He knew about the letters, about the sex, about how Sholto had held me all night one night as I wept when I’d seen one too many youth bleeding out in the hills of Helmand.
and continues his exploration and worship of my body. I wrap my arms around him, one hand cupping the back of his head and the other around his muscular back; his belly has gone a bit soft with age but his back remains solid.
Greg gives the best man speech, something about how it was about time us two bastards figured it out and how the whole of Scotland Yard owes him twenty quid apiece because he always knew we’d end up together. He toasts us and wishes us all the best, which is nice. Greg’s a good bloke. We have a light lunch, and thank God there isn’t a big group of people standing around mingling. Neither of us much likes small talk, and we aren’t big partiers.
It does not surprise me when Sholto lets go of my hand to take Sherlock’s. “You are a lucky man, Mr. Holmes-Watson. I wish you all the best.”
4) In the case of a true emergency – what we’d call a stat or crash section – things really can happen that quickly, ten minutes or less from decision to incision.
The physician continues, “We think your wife’s placenta is abrupting – that is, we believe the placenta has started to separate from the wall of her uterus. Because Mrs. Watson’s pregnancy is thirty-seven weeks along, and because we believe the separation is occurring slowly, we are going to practice watchful waiting, in hopes that she will give birth before the abruption becomes critical for either her or the baby. We firmly believe that keeping the baby in for as long as safely possible is our best course of action; however, it is possible that the abruption will continue to occur and we will have to deliver the baby emergently. We are watching her foetal monitor strip for signs of distress in utero. If at any point the monitor shows signs of distress or the bleeding continues or suddenly increases, we will at that point deliver via emergency caesarean section. We anticipate a healthy baby considering that thirty-seven weeks is considered full term. Do you have any questions?”
, John thinks – inherited his nose and chin. His heart no longer beats in his chest, no. His heart is lying here, venous line in her umbilical cord stump and a hand-crocheted hat covering her head where her brain should be. Despite the rather froglike appearance of this baby (
Despite the inflection in John’s voice, it is more a statement than a question. Sherlock walks forward and John backward, for they do not want to let go of nor stop kissing one another for the ten-step trek to Sherlock’s –
– heart, and kidneys. We don’t know exactly how long this went on in utero but in order to stabilise her blood pressure and heart rate we had to give her both fluids and blood via an IV we’ve placed in a vein in her umbilical vein. We hope to be able to make up for the blood she lost via her mother’s placenta prior to delivery.
John’s brain switches from crusty-tired husband to trauma surgeon at the timbre of Mary’s panicked voice as he glances up to see her throwing off her bedsheets. Her hospital gown hangs around her pregnant belly (
John’s waiting room chair is uncomfortable, like shoes a size too small. The telly is blaring some crap morning talk show and John’s mind feels anaesthetized, he hasn’t slept well in a couple nights, and he needs a shower, shave, and maybe a shit in the worst way.
In the span of what feels like hours but is more like nine minutes Mary is being wheeled into the operating theatre, neonatologist and newborn nurses on hand, and the surgeons scrubbed and ready. As much blood as is pouring out of her, as much distress as his baby is in now and as much blood as she’s already lost he’s pretty sure they’re going to do what they called in med school a
Let's just dive right in with the intensity, shall we? This was a hard section for me to write. I've tried to do it respectful justice.
“When you came back, the only thing I wanted was to wrap my arms around you and never let go. But I couldn’t very well do that in the restaurant about to propose to
As he kisses my back, he tells me he realises that I left for him, that I was trying to protect him, and
A noisy NICU and the bedside of a sick baby is not the place to sort it, so John stays where he is for a few minutes, taking multiple deep breaths and clenching and unclenching his fists as much to rein in his own catecholamines as to not bollocks this up with Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes, I promise to love you and only you for the rest of the time we have together on earth. I promise to do whatever I must to demonstrate that love to you, the love that you’ve so freely given me more times than I’ve realised, the love you so richly deserve in return. I promise that in everything I do, I will put your needs first. I promise to love all your quirks, and I promise to never leave body parts in the fridge, because two people doing that in our flat would simply unsustainable.
“Second, I want you to know she is stable for the moment but her condition is very very critical. Your wife lost a great deal of blood before giving birth, which in turn severely compromised your daughter’s –
Sherlock’s hands continue to tremble and his eyes focus mostly on the floor, but his pulse is no longer throbbing in his ears, and his palms aren’t as sweaty as they were whilst he was fumbling trying to tie his own tie. Though he has never said the words out loud, Sherlock loves Martha Louise Hudson as much as he loves his own mother.
Sherlock, still naked, takes John, still clothed, into his arms and wraps both arms and legs around him. John is no longer hard, no longer in search of an orgasm. Sherlock has just had a fantastic orgasm, and is now holding the only person whom he has ever truly dared to love. Sherlock inhales the scent of John’s hair
Sherlock tightens his lips, looks at the floor, and blinks several times before catching John’s gaze again. “And the baby?”
screams John’s internal monologue. His mouth manages to croakily whisper, “No, Doctor. That’s pretty clear. Thanks.”
John and Sherlock return to St. Mary’s that afternoon, having eaten and rested a bit. Rosie’s condition is unchanged from before, but John had promised Doctor Smithson that he would return to address the issues left unresolved when John and Sherlock had left earlier. Over lunch the two men have discussed banalities – weather, cases, and Mrs. Hudson’s cooking. Both know that the day is going to be arduous, and anything more at the time is simply too much.
Sherlock pours his emotions into his violin, the slide of the bow over the strings saying to John and the universe whatever he needs to express. Some days he plays a requiem for Rosie, and some days he plays a lively Mozart piece. Though he does not believe in an afterlife per se, he does believe in the conservation of energy, and believes that the matter and energy that once was Rosie Watson lives on somewhere. On days when he knows he needs to, he writes his love for John into an on-the-spot improvisation, for despite the fact that these men have one another memorized, love is sometimes easier for them to show than to say.
Sherlock’s eyes are wide and dark with wonder, arousal, and they glint with just a twinge of naughty.
I desperately wanted some song lyrics for the beginning of this chapter but nothing in any of my Spotify playlists was what I needed. Then one day driving home from work, this old INXS beauty came on the radio and voila! It was the one.
Again, the sensation of being stretched is new and I breathe deeply to become accustomed to two fingers. John is a considerate lover, and asks me over and over if I am alright.
24 pills - which is the exact number - in 72 hours means two pills every sixth hour. Reasonable dosage, really. Sherlock can’t, however, say this. ‘Reasonable dosage’ is something that John’s not likely to believe he’s capable of when it comes to narcotics.
Pushing both trousers and pants down just below his balls, John pauses to give himself a moment. He wants to say something, something crude and Not Good and something he’d never dreamt of saying to anyone else in a situation like this, but the words seem to get stuck in his throat. It’s filthy, but then all of this is; this isn’t about making love or even about having sex, and he wants to say that, to make that very clear with a few chosen words, but even with Sherlock looking like he does right now - eyes less focused, head pulled back, cock fully erect against his bare stomach - John can’t say it.
“Since when,” Sherlock begins, his voice deliberately low, “do I ever do something I don’t want to? Unless, of course, it gives me pleasure to do it anyway?”
Minutes ago, things were as they’d used to be. Sherlock, high on having been right, pointing out all the obvious patterns, John’s
There are currently no dragons waiting outside the living room, and Sherlock has closed the windows.
“Now, four years ago something made her change her church-related activities quite drastically. She left her parents’ church and began seeking out more socially radical groups…”
He has no desire to challenge whatever self-image John needs to retain. In fact, he's got everything to lose by doing so.
. Sherlock is inferior to Mycroft in intelligence, self-control and chemical balance, but he will always have this one, simple advantage.
A new distraction. For the first time in weeks, the smell of the old dishes doesn’t even bother him.
“Sex doesn't alarm me,” Sherlock says, because it really doesn't, if anything he finds the phenomenon in itself intriguing even if actual people's sex lives are often tiresome and predictable in the extreme.
“I only managed to extract what they said, couldn’t get time or date.. But it was in one of the last conversations Sophia had.”
Sherlock draws his legs up just a bit, hiding an erection that is seemingly not going to be put to use.
“Breaking into a rehab facility? Really, Sherlock? As I remember it, it used to be the other way around.”
to a chemical defect, it’s a trigger. One that happens to be obsessive in nature, but I’ve been reliably informed that this particular obsession is not considered pathological by either medical or societal standards.”
One minute they’re having a rather intense discussion about whether or not to take on a case that Sherlock finds too mundane but that John claims might be “worth the effort”, and the next minute, John’s hand is there, squeezing Sherlock’s forearm, his thumb stroking the inside of Sherlock’s wrist.
He doesn’t, however, miss the way John rests his eyes just a second longer on Sherlock - or rather on the aubergine shirt and the well-cut suit trousers Sherlock’s wearing - than he usually does.
I adore the song quoted at the beginning - Cat Stevens/Yusuf Islam is an unequaled musical talent. If you want to hear it in full (and I recommend, because it's gorgeous), here is a link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP6B9HttRI8
, regrets of years wasted, tears for what might have been and what will never be, tears over bodies on the rainy Saint Bart’s pavement and bodies riddled with bullets, whispers in the night
Neither man being religious, they had used Sherlock’s London connections and owed favours to find a celebrant; in the end they had chosen Victoria, a Jewish woman whom Sherlock had assisted solve a case years prior. There had been a series of unsolved assaults on transgender people in London at that time, and this woman was one of the survivors whom he had interviewed in order to track down the assailant. During the course of that interview Sherlock had discovered that – as part the woman’s own devotion to her faith – she officiated same-sex wedding ceremonies free of charge for any couple in need. John and Sherlock had insisted on paying her somehow for officiating, but she refused and instead asked him to do something kind for someone else later on. The husbands have agreed to pay it forward, but they’ve also chosen to include the
. I am still in awe as I swirl the words around in my mouth, still in somewhat of a shock that we are married. Finally.
His countenance changes from playful to serious. Not the type of serious where someone is in dire trouble, but the type where he wants Sherlock to pay close attention to his spoken words.
“Tough act to follow, he is,” he quips nervously to the crowd. A few chuckles ripple through the audience, and Sherlock’s eyes upon John never waver. John takes one of Sherlock’s hands in each of his – to publicly demonstrate what Sherlock means to him, but also because
Back in the old medical textbooks, babies born with what you had were called anencephalic (from the Greek word meaning “headless”) monsters. God, am I so glad that went out of vogue before I studied medicine, because you were beautiful. Holding you and loving you was the greatest thing I’ve ever done, and I’m so glad you gave me the chance to do it.
“For starters, I am not going anywhere. I don’t know if you remember what I just said out on the pavement, but I’m not. I’m staying, Sherlock. I just bloody got here and I am not leaving.
But watching you with Rosie, and watching you grieve her, Sherlock. It has made me realise just how much I don’t ever want to live without you but I may have to one day. You know, we do dangerous work. If one of us were to die right now, I would live forever regretting that I didn’t tangibly show you just what you mean to me. I want you to know – I want everyone to know – that you are the other half of my soul and that I’d follow you into the gates of hell itself if you needed me to. You have died and come back – twice – for me. It’s a debt I can’t repay but I am bloody well going to spend the rest of our lives trying. I want you to go to your grave knowing that you are the first, best, and only person in this world for me.
"The other thing I want you to know is that your daughter has anencephaly. What that means is that she was born without most of her brain. She has the lower portions of her brain – what we call the brainstem – that allow her to continue breathing, but most of the rest is not there. She is missing the parts that control her vision, emotions, thoughts, and movements.”
As much as he’d love to draw this out even more, he really cannot justify making Sherlock – patient Sherlock, who has already waited five years – wait any longer. John reaches moves up to kiss each of Sherlock’s nipples, then back revisits Sherlock’s cock. He reaches one hand up to continue to play with Sherlock’s nipple while he licks and sucks at Sherlock’s cock, paying special attention to his foreskin and frenulum. After about sixty seconds, Sherlock arches his back and moans, then comes and comes and comes, the hot salty liquid a litany of praise down John’s throat. John continues to suck as Sherlock trembles with the aftershocks.
It’s me again, your dad. I miss you so much I can barely stand it. I never ever knew that it was possible to love someone that didn’t exist before until I saw you. You were alive for just a few short days but you taught me what it was like to have a part of my heart beating outside my body.
Mycroft winces perfunctorily in his seat, as if it were an elder brother’s duty to feign distaste at the notion of his younger sibling’s happiness.
Sherlock’s mouth continues its journey southward as he kisses down John’s abdomen and hips, and he nestles his face against John’s cock and breathes in its particular scent of soap and sweat and John. “This is…..large, John,” Sherlock gasps as he licks up the length of Sherlock’s cock. He mouths at each of John’s balls and John bucks against the headboard.
the two are amazed that it all somehow fits. As they pack the last piece into the bag, something on the bench catches Sherlock’s eye. A piece of paper, hidden apparently under all the equipment Sherlock had been positively swooning about. Was it there all this time, or where did it come from?
John had sat with his head in his hands, weighing his options while his pregnant wife slept in the next room of their villa on the Mediterranean coast.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat and he can’t manage another word. He brings the back of his hand to his mouth. Despite the fact that her face is not the same shape as most other babies’, despite the lack of a skull to form her head, Sherlock is taken aback by her beauty.
“I have wanted nothing to do with Mary for a long time, but when she shot you, that sealed the deal. Any chance that I’d have loved her in any way went out the window that night. I lost you once when you jumped, and when I thought I’d lost you again after she shot you, I just….I couldn’t forgive her. No bloody way.
is – but he knows she’s not who he thought she was when he met her in the deepest throes of grief after Sherlock jumped. He has played the game for too long and isn’t sure how much longer his patience will last. He wants nothing to do with the woman in the hospital bed less than a metre away from him, but for now, for here, he must keep up the charade.
As we’ve already addressed in the story, Rosie is very very sick, but in a case like hers, they’d probably say, we’re less worried about her IV line staying in, and more worried about her father getting a chance to hold her while she’s still alive, because we don’t know how long that will be.
John begins to rock slowly, slowly at first, then picking up the pace. “You feel so warm and tight around me…..husband mine,” John grits out as he licks and kisses the nape of Sherlock’s neck and his earlobes. “I am going to make you feel so good, love, right here. You will not know who or where you are by the time I’m done with you. ”
“What you’re going to do right now is clean your teeth, put that velvet box in your pocket, and get into the car. You’ve got a wedding and a sizzling date very soon, dear.” She winks at him, and he rolls his eyes as sons do when their mothers mention anything that could remotely be construed to be about sex.
They will stand here for a few minutes and weep. They will thank their beloved baby girl for the part she played in creating the life they now share, united seamlessly and forever. They will go back to Baker Street, order takeout, and hold one another by the fireplace. They will go to bed, where they will read, talk, make love, and then sleep.
so she wanders into the flat yoo-hooing and searching for John’s fiance’. Martha Hudson’s heart fills with tenderness and her eyes with tears when she finds him, the son to whom she did not give birth, in front of the full-length mirror in his bedroom, not a hair out of place. His custom-tailored black trousers and soft white dress shirt fit him perfectly; Sherlock looks younger than his forty years, and
If he saw the expressions John made to him directed to anyone else he would say John looked fondly at them, perhaps even longingly; but could that just be wishful thinking? No one had ever looked at him that way before; they saw him as a freak, the weirdo virgin. The first night Sherlock had met John he was sure the doctor had been asking him out, it was fear of rejection and memories of being tormented in university that had Sherlock blurting out ‘married to my work’. John didn’t seem to bring the subject up again, despite how close they grew  those first few months.
'Did you get any of those chocolate biscuits I like?’ Sherlock’s deep baritone voice asked as he entered, Rosie quietly clinging to his shirt
He wet his fingers and rolled the nipple roughly between them slotting his thigh between Sherlock’s legs and pushing it gently against the young man’s hard cock. 'Then when you could take no more I'd move lower....’
He knew that John could make him desperate, would relish controlling Sherlock’s pleasure as he had already. The young man had never been good at resisting pleasure, it was why they and Ms Adler had come to this arrangement, he could control so much of his emotions but as soon as he discovered the bliss found only at the height an orgasm or with increasingly strong opioids he was lost. The room was a gift of sorts. After his brother Mycroft had found him in that sordid drug house almost passed recovery he had made arrangements for Sherlock to be allowed a more agreeable addiction. Ms Adler had so far not been able to find men quick enough for Sherlock to turn them away but John... John was perfect.
‘Oh so lovely Sherlock’ He looked up at the younger man who was blushing above him ‘I want to make you feel so good baby, would you like that?’ John smirked as Sherlock’s weeping cock jumped slightly in his hand.
John took hold of Sherlock’s hips and spun him round to lie on the sofa; he knelt between Sherlock’s knees and looked down on the suddenly shy man.
The conversation over dinner had been light and easy; John had always been fascinated by Sherlock and his ability to deduce anyone in the restaurant just to make him laugh. John had insisted on paying and as they walked home their shoulders brushed against each other, he felt himself becoming more aware of Sherlock each time they touched and blamed the wine; still he couldn’t bring himself to move away.
Later Sherlock had risked his life to save Johns however when he returned from his mission John hadn’t been pleased to see him he’d been angry, and even worse, he’d seemed happy with Mary. Sherlock tried to move on and fit into their lives the best he could but he hated how distant he and John had become. Now Mary was dead and John seemed to be coping well, Sherlock no longer felt responsible; there was Rosie to think of but Sherlock loved her, she was Johns daughter why wouldn’t he.
Looking up at Sherlock he noticed the young man had his head thrown back and was pinching his own nipples, John brought a hand up to his mouth and wetted two fingers. As John took Sherlock’s cock back into his mouth he reached down with one hand to circle Sherlock’s virgin hole, and up with the other to bat one of Sherlock’s hands away and take over pinching; John slid just the tip of one finger into Sherlock’s tight hole as he pinched and rolled his nipple.  Sherlock let out a scream of delight as he came down John’s throat; John continued pinching and sucking until Sherlock was oversensitive.
John ran a finger along the collar of Sherlock’s robe pushing it aside as he went. 'It would be like unwrapping a gift and I would kiss every inch of you as I bared it, would you like that Sherlock?'
John stood for a moment, shopping bags in hand and regarded the pair. His daughter looked so content in her sleep and his flatmate, who appeared to be deep within his mind palace, had one hand protectively over her back. This position stretched Sherlock’s neck in a graceful arch, his top shirt button was undone and from where he was standing John could just start to see Sherlock’s collarbone jutting from his pale chest, the sight made his breath catch and his heart skip a beat. Quickly pulling himself from his trace John moved to the kitchen.
'They get irrationally angry, as if I've done anything more than deduce the obvious, and leave. I should have seen you'd be different Doctor' the younger man looked pleased, aroused and almost impressed; the doctor appreciated his mind as much as he obviously did his body.
His entire body jumped as if electrocuted and he whimpered loudly. With a dark chuckle John took Sherlock in hand and pulled back his foreskin, he licked across the head dipping his tongue into the slit and tasting the unique flavour. Letting Sherlock fall from his mouth he focused on the two balls at the base, taking first one then the other into his mouth, sucking lightly and rolling them with his lips.
'First I want to thank you, Rosie and I are really happy to be back at baker street, back with you’ he paused trying to gather his courage for this next part 'I’ve always felt at home with you, but lately I’ve been feeling  something new, something quite different’
John should, he'd been told, think of this first brief meeting as more of an interview than a one-time interaction and that if he and Sherlock took to each other he would be the only man that had ever wanted to return.
Sherlock’s hand gripped harder at the thought of John taking all his autonomy, all the choices and control he didn't want right then and taking care of him. He wanted to do exactly what John asked of him and he knew he wouldn't regret giving control over to this dangerous, fascinating army doctor.
He relaxed fully, just sucking and watching Johns face, and trusted that John wouldn't let him get hurt. As soon as he'd let go John slid fully into him and almost wailed with pleasure 'Oh yes Sherlock just like that baby' He pulled out and thrust back in all the way, his balls hit Sherlock’s chin he was so deep. Every move John made pushed fully into his throat now and he loved giving himself fully into John’s control.
Sherlock had never had so much pleasure without an orgasm before, John had played and pushed his body passed what he thought he could bare and now he was looking at Sherlock’s most intimate place as if he was just getting started. He should be embarrassed but John would never hurt him in a way they wouldn’t both enjoy. As John kissed his cheeks and licked his way between them Sherlock let himself be moved and used in any way John wanted, his head dropped back onto the pillows and he stopped trying to hold back the long satisfied groans.
), and he’s willing to let it do just that, but he needs an external way to organise the internal chaos if he's to stand a chance to stay above the surface of the shapeless dread of--
It's a few beers later and John has just listened to several rather gruesome tales from a nurse who’d recently worked at a gastric ward. Selma had joined in with her usual remarks and jokes, making the stories even worse and the group at the table had been laughing at the mere inappropriateness of it all. John's glad to see that she’d not closed down as he’d seen her do on one another occasion like this, and he's now even found himself edging her on in her comments, much to her obvious delight.
- confirms Sherlock’s theory that John’s PTSD is acting up again. The past few nights there’d been the padding down to the kitchen for glasses of water in the darkness, a restlessness that only surfaced during periods of intensified symptoms. The conclusion is simple.
There’s fingers kneading his nipple and there’s a sting of pain through his body. Sherlock can’t suppress the sounds this evokes, but they drown in the wet cavity of John’s mouth anyway. John lets go of his nipple and the pressure on his body eases, his mouth is once again empty and his eyes flutter open.
For a moment, the thought of what he might have completely fucked up by initiating what he’s now about to end hits Sherlock with full force, making him feel like he’s choking.
- but of laundry detergent and old fabric. Unnerved by his own actions, Sherlock throws it back down on the bed, ignoring the already-hushed voice that’s telling him he shouldn’t be here, in John’s room.
Still staring at the ketchup, Steven’s knuckles whiten as he holds on to the edge of the table, breathing.
John’s voice goes from the khaki of deeply uncomfortable to a deep green as he starts talking about the psychotropic drugs. Sherlock sees how John’s internal focus shifts as he speaks. Where before John was self-conscious and not letting too much show, not taking any risks, he is now fixed on Sherlock, automatically entering doctor mode -
"I never insisted that you explain every time you ran off without a word or ignored me for days. But now. I asked one thing of you. One thing. I need to know if you are taking narcotics.” John’s voice escalates into a near-shout.  “Which I think, considering the fact that you’re a freaking drug addict, is not too much to ask!”
“Bed,” John says, the word uttered almost directly into Sherlock's mouth as he breaks away from the kiss.
It might be an unorthodox cure, but then again modern psychiatry has failed him, probably doesn't even have the means to evaluate someone with a brain both as intelligent and as… problematic as his, so unorthodox methods are all that remain.
When the major depression caused by his neurotransmitters readjusting themselves to the lack of various drugs finally begins to wear off, Sherlock finds himself a new and rather effective way of ridding himself of the last persistent symptoms of his depression.
Continuing to riffle through various stacks of paper, Sherlock suddenly finds that he no longer seems to remember quite what he had been looking so intently for just seconds ago.
At age 33 Sherlock knows that caring is not an advantage. If he ever doubted it, he would know from the restless tension in his mind ever since he kissed John. The dread of what consequences that could bring had been present even before that kiss, but after that, it was increased to critical levels. Sherlock isn’t good, and Sherlock cares about what happens to John. The dissonance between what he wants and what he wants to want is creating disturbances in his mind palace and disarray in his thoughts. Another dissonance; John claims to want to be with Sherlock, but Sherlock knows this to be highly unlikely. It’s probably more about John not wanting to be without their life of adrenaline and being needed but it’s really up to John to decide that for himself. The problem is that Sherlock can’t live in the limbo between what’s said and what he knows will follow. It’s better when it’s over. Sherlock doesn’t care about himself, but he cares about avoiding more self-loathing, which he finds to be a problematic issue when he tries to trust his instincts in the Work. Most people already loath him; if he loathes himself as well then why would he even bother to solve crimes and fight to get his deductions and solutions heard?
After sending a few emails to people who have no idea who Sherlock is, but who he has been researching methodically during the past week, Sherlock allows himself to sort through all the new clues about John, especially the new piece of information about Nate.
“Has that thing offended you personally?” John asks, nodding at the Rubik's cube in Sherlock's hand as he enters the sitting room, shoulders stiff from the shift at the chilly clinic -
The only really remarkable thing about this particular chemical problem is that Sherlock’s not certain if he even wants it to be solved.
Sherlock leans down to rest his chin on his knee for a few seconds, bracing himself to continue. Stroking his hands absently down his shins before sitting up straight again, he can’t help wishing for the comfort of his old, threadbare pyjama bottoms.
“I did not!” Sherlock protests, but there’s something vaguely familiar to the words, so John is most likely right. It sounds like something he’d say when he wanted John to just shut up about other people’s feelings. “A vast amount of my work is based on others being predictable in their… human nature. Knowing about it and bothering with it is hardly the same thing.”
(His own reflection, as seen out of the corner of his eye, shouldn't register as foreign, but it does, it often does, and it feels like he's being watched by someone, always observed and--)
It’s an act mirroring fellation, Sherlock knows, and so he starts sucking, hollowing his cheeks and letting John set the pace with his hand. It’s nothing like fellatio, though, because there’s no smell and also no actual genitals involved, but the thought of John reacting to seeing him do this is still--
(“You don't pick up on these things, these normal, human things, do you?” John had once said, rubbing at his own face in frustration.)
Sleep is the respite he’s after, and anything beyond that is a luxury he cannot allow and does not deserve.
His mind palace has turned into a labyrinth and there's something missing, something that will prevent him creating a pattern of
As John finishes reciting the article he found, Sherlock shuts his own laptop, nodding thoughtfully -
Then his eyelids flutter, just for a tenth of a second, because two fingers slide from his chin, slide down his throat, painting a slow line over his carotid artery before getting stuck in the collar of his T-shirt.
Matthew, Eva and a few of the others around the table voice their agreement, and Sherlock looks summonly at John.
John raises his glass of wine in a toast to the two of them, for their finally having gotten their act together. Glasses clink and the room rings with the reverberations. They tuck into their dinner and for the first occasion in their time since they’ve met, John witnesses Sherlock Holmes eating a second helping of dinner.
John startles awake and heads down to the kitchen to find Sherlock fully dressed and sitting at the table, hands steepled, ostensibly in deep thought over something. A cup of tea and two pieces of toast sit across the table from him.
Thirty-seven minutes after leaving Rosie’s bedside, John stumbles into the flat he once shared with the woman whose lifeless body is set to be cremated at some point. He’ll get a copy of her death certificate for the legalities that will have to be addressed but they won’t return her ashes; John doesn’t want them.
Pablo Neruda is one of my favorite poets, and this is one of my favorite poems of his. I've been waiting for the chance to use this in a Johnlock context, and voila! Here it is. :)
“John.” Sherlock responds rather abruptly though not unpleasantly, as he squints while opening his eyes.
Now that the floodgates have opened, John can’t stop sobbing. Between sobs, he manages to choke out, “Nothing, my love. You’ve done nothing wrong. Just that this feels so…..so….good. So right.” He’s crying the tears of a man for whom love and grief and relief are pressed down, shaken together, and running over.
. This is far better than I had imagined. As if on cue, John picks up the pace and changes his angle just a bit, and I could fall apart in his arms. The combination of John being inside me, hitting my prostate, and today being the day he became my husband makes me feel….almost radioactive. Alive. Like I could melt into earth and someone would find my remains in a century, still glowing. He rocks inside me, bringing me almost to the edge of orgasm before slowing down and kissing me again. My scrotum hangs full and heavy over where John’s cock is inside me, and the warmth of my prostate is indescribable.
“I see it. I see it now. Everything you have ever done, every choice you’ve ever made, has been because you’ve been trying to protect me.
As I take him by the hand and the band strikes up our song, I wrap my arm around his waist and he cups the nape of my neck as our other free hands intertwine. I whisper in his ear, “Sod the guests, my love, this song is for you and only you.” He nods quietly and gazes at me with a love I’m still not sure I know how to capture and hold in my heart. I am certain as I croon Etta’s words to him that this brilliant man grasps the significance behind them; our guests hear the song lyrics, but he understands the meaning reserved only for the two of us.
I want you to know (wherever you are) that you will always be my precious baby girl and that I will always love you to the moon and back.
In the inkiest black thoughts that crowd his mind at the moment, John is of a mind to not ring for anyone. He is completely unready to deal with the implications of this at the moment, but he’s far more prepared to see Mary die than he was – ever will be – prepared to live without Sherlock.
Sherlock reads it aloud again, just to make sure he’s figured out the code correctly, taking care that he hasn’t misinterpreted any of the symbols.
“What I am saying is, I think it is time for you to consider allowing us to remove all of Rosie’s life support and focus on keeping her comfortable until she passes away. Of the two options we have, I believe this is the kinder one.”
We could have a pissing match over who’s the bigger romantic here, but that’s not really the point. I love you, Sherlock Holmes, and I am going to ask you to be my husband. I want the rest of my forever to be with you.
John gently rolls me back over, and I take advantage of the opportunity to sit up and begin divesting him of his clothing. My hands are trembling and I am not nearly as agile at this as he is; there is a good bit of button fumbling involved, but soon enough he is completely nude as well. For a moment we pause and drink in the moment, gazing at one another’s naked bodies, in awe of the beauty of the love we share. We’ve seen one another naked many times by now, but this time feels different – more profound, more intimate.
“When Mary came along, she gave me the tiniest glimmer of hope. I don’t really want to think about her at the moment, but I owe you an explanation. She made me think maybe, just maybe there was something worth getting up in the morning for. But she wasn’t you, Sherlock. She never could have been. All the things that attracted me to her were things that reminded me of you: she was funny, she could be cheeky, and she was smart. God, was she smart. But in a million lifetimes she’d never have meant to me what you did.
An hour passes, then two. John stirs and without opening his eyes whispers, “I think I should do that every night.”
She is the same mother sorting his tie for him today as she was those many years ago when she wouldn’t have him sleeping rough. He doesn’t know what he’d do without her.
In this fic, Rosie Watson was the catalyst that brought her dads together. So while it seems like John and Sherlock are the two main characters, the entire story is named after her.
John had banished him from the kitchen earlier that morning and made him dredge up a tedious oath from primary school, something about Scout’s honor (or was it Scots’ honor? Sherlock didn’t know) that he would stay out of the kitchen for the entirety of the day.
“Ohhhhh god, John, if you do that much more I will not last very long either,” Sherlock moans wantonly.
There is some angst in here, but not nearly as much as what we've already been through. I wrote this chapter mostly to illustrate how difficult grief can be; one minute you're fine, then bam! out of nowhere the most mundane thing triggers (and I don't use the word lightly) a massive reaction. That's a completely normal part of grieving, although it seems hard for outsiders to wrap their heads around. There's no set point at which you're 'over' a massive loss.
After the funeral and visitors and food and having to retell the story several times, they are alone again in the flat. They have wept all the tears they can weep for now. They have felt every emotion imaginable: sorrow, anger, fear, relief, exhaustion, and several more neither can articulate, emotions so tucked into their marrow they cannot be named.
John doesn’t realise it but he has been staring at the floor all this time. His gaze moves toward Sherlock, who is on the sofa beside him trembling, shoulders heaving, making neither the slightest noise nor the slightest effort to contain the tears spilling down his cheeks.
– and with teary eyes begins to speak, knowing his words will be wholly inadequate but he can’t not say it out loud. Not after so many years of leaving words unsaid, no. He will do his damnedest, even if his voice shakes.
“And I want you to know. Jesus, I am so crap at this. I want you to know that you....I…feel the same way about you.”
“I was clean when we met but the cravings were still so difficult to manage. After you moved in, they diminished almost overnight. The rush I had previously only been able to obtain with a needle in my veins I found with you sitting next to me in the kitchen, which both terrified and thrilled me. I had never before, nor have I since, realised that it was possible to feel that way about another living human.
The rest of the guest list is short but full of meaning for both men. Harry, Greg, Molly, Mrs. Hudson, Angelo, Billy Wiggins, Mycroft, Mike Stamford, and Mummy and Daddy Holmes.
They awaken the next morning, a tangle of naked limbs and mussed hair and sour breath. It couldn’t have been past seven the prior evening when they’d made love and Sherlock had held John as he wept for the trainwreck of the past eight – no, forty – years of his life. Sherlock had wrapped his lanky limbs around John and held him until no more tears came, and then held him some more, just the two of them silent; no words had been spoken. No words had been necessary. At some point – neither is sure exactly when – Sherlock had gently undressed John down to his pants and tucked him into bed before climbing into bed himself, not bothering to dress. He had wrapped his arm around John’s waist and tucked the top of John’s head under his chin, and pressed the length of his body against John, and it was thus that they fell asleep.
'Stamford warned me you could see everything a man wished to keep hidden, I had thought you merely researched but I booked under a pseudonym ' John took in the room as he spoke. Walls and furnishings in reds and purples gave a warm intimate feeling and the immense four poster bed in the centre left no confusion as to the room’s purpose.
This brothel was one of the very few that actually took care of its staff and it was said that since Sherlock had arrived this reputation had been proved increasingly often; a well-connected benefactor or some such had apparently paid for more security staff, from the look of them it was no wonder guests complied with the rules. No guest was permitted to injure their chosen girl, or man if you went to the secret back rooms, and if any girl was hurt the repercussions would be swift and not quickly forgotten. As such most that chose to visit Sherlock ended up merely leaving before the allotted time swearing and in a blind rage.
'I found some clean glasses’ Sherlock smiled, John felt like his chest was going to burst at the shy look the detective gave him, unable to contain himself any longer John allowed his love for Sherlock to show in his expression as he took the few steps to stand in front of the younger man. He could see the shock and hope pass over Sherlock’s face, if he were honest with himself Sherlock’s face perfectly summed up how the doctor felt.
John bought the bottle back to the bed and slicked his fingers; he pushed one of Sherlock’s legs back up to his chest while the other was bent as far as Sherlock could keep it under his own strength.
‘Answer me properly when I ask you a question Sherlock.’ John gently smoothed his hand over the stinging skin ‘You don’t mind this?’
‘John…JAWN…please John please’ Sherlock begged, John had never seen anything as lovely as this brilliant man frotting against his still clothed prick. He let go of Sherlock’s hips and undid the front of their trousers, John  carefully released Sherlock’s weeping cock; long and thin with a nest of near black curls at the base.
He untied Sherlock’s wrists and rubbed them to check he was ok, and then he flopped down next to Sherlock and pulled him to lie against his side.
Despite all this John hadn’t felt the same gut wrenching, soul destroying loss he had when Sherlock had 'died’; he thought less of himself because of it but he had to admit the truth, if only to himself, Sherlock had… Sherlock does mean more to John than Mary ever could have. The decision to move back to Baker Street hadn’t worried him at all, it felt like the most natural choice; sure they’d have to change to accommodate John’s single father status but he never questioned the move.
'Sherlock…'John couldn’t stop looking from the detectives amazing blue-green eyes to his slightly parted pink lips and back 'I want to tell you something, it may change everything for us but I’m hoping it’ll be a good change.’ He looked into Sherlock’s eyes and saw hope and fear, as if Sherlock wasn’t sure what was happening.
'Oh she was wonderful dear, is Sherlock with you?’  'He’s already gone up, I know it’s a bit cheeky but would you be willing to watch Rosie tonight?’ He looked at her hopefully and saw a wide smile split her face 'Of course John dear I’d be more than happy to’ She took Rosie  back 'I’ve got enough nappies and formula so don’t worry about a thing’ Mrs Hudson assured John as she closed  the door 'Have fun dears’. ………………………………………………………………………………. Sherlock tried to calm himself as he took off his shoes and coat, John and he had been out for dinner together before, so why had tonight felt so different? Perhaps it was the wine but Sherlock couldn’t stop thinking about  the way Johns arm had been brushing against his as they walked home, it had taken all his will power not to take hold of John’s hand.
The two men fell into the seat together Sherlock clinging to John as if he were afraid the doctor would leave him.
'I’ll just go check, you go see if you can find some glasses’ He watched as a smiling Sherlock went upstairs, John could hardly believe what was happening, what he thought was happening anyway.
John was amazed by how incredible it felt and pushed Sherlock’s legs onto his shoulders as he sped up, both of them panting and moaning as the thrusts got harder and more desperate. Sherlock looked beautiful like this and John stroked his body clumsily, not willing to slow down now he had felt heaven. Faster and harder John hammered into Sherlock, praising his body and caressing each part of him. He reached up and pinched one nipple causing Sherlock to cry out. The young man’s prick wept constantly and as John could feel his own end building he used his other hand to stroke Sherlock in time with his thrusts. The feelings together of John both inside him and surrounding him fully pushed Sherlock over the edge with a scream; his body would have bucked uncontrollably had John not taken his hips and started to pull him down into the hard thrusts. John fucked him through his orgasm feeling his insides ripple and squeeze until with a roar he emptied his load into the sated Sherlock.
John's hands combed through his curls again before he tightened his hold slightly. 'Remember, keep your hands behind your back or I'll have to tie them.' God yes, Sherlock pulled against Johns grip eager to please the doctor and so aroused by the thought of the man tying his hands back.
Having finished packing away the shopping John moved to make a cup of tea, the perfect antidote to a troubled mind. From the lounge he could hear Rosie beginning to stir, looking round into the lounge he could see Sherlock moving Rosie further up his chest as he stood to make his way into the kitchen.
John reached down and massaged Sherlock’s balls as he sucked, rolling them in his palm; he released Sherlock’s dick to mouth at his balls. He took Sherlock in hand as he pulled first one then the other into his mouth.
'Yep in the tin…tea?’ John asked already reaching for another mug 'new case or just reorganising?’ he asked filling both mugs
John circled Sherlock’s hole with his tongue, licking across it broadly and then pointing and teasing his way into the younger body. Sherlock tried to tilt his hips to find more pleasure but John pushed down firmly on his thighs and pinned him to the bed. He didn’t stop until he had his lips were flush to Sherlock’s skin, the rim loose and wet from his attentions and Sherlock shaking like a leaf.
Sherlock, standing beside him in front of the bathroom mirror is currently applying his deodorant, filling the room with a poncy smell of something that reminds John vaguely of some kind of wood. Sherlock, actually using the bathroom for some of its intended uses while John is there. Sherlock, acting like this is nothing out of the ordinary.
“I think,” Sherlock says, managing to keep his voice steady, “that it would be far more efficient for you to tell me what you would like to do to me, and see if I have any objections.”
“Could you at least try to be a bit careful? Those haven’t been dusted for fingerprints yet!" one of the new crime scene techs snaps while seemingly holding herself back from just grabbing the books from Sherlock's hands.
In one passage John mentions feeling like he and Sherlock act almost as one, finding it both beautiful, profound and terrifying. This is a phenomenon called ‘identity diffusion’, meaning that the person might sometimes have a hard time understanding where the other person ends and where they begin. This makes for quite a tendency towards codependent relationships, which is something that John acknowledges having with Sherlock.
It's too much, knowing just how thin the line between ‘interesting’ pain and ‘wrong’ pain is, but not knowing
Has Mycroft talked to Helena Martell? Or, more importantly; has Helena talked to Mycroft about him? Helena -
Their eyes meet, and the khaki swallows some of the peaceful pumpkin orange that had surrounded John.
It's a strange experience, having your own methods used against you. He’d provided her with all the information needed to reach this conclusion, and yet it’s surprising in a way, because Sherlock’s not used to anyone except Mycroft actually managing to deduce anything meaningful about him.
Sherlock is not sure if he's meant to answer that, not sure that he could even if he wanted to. He remains still, phone in hand and John's breath against his neck.
Then John slowly shakes his head, turning to walk towards the stairs and his own room without another look at Sherlock.
There's the haziness from the endorphins still lingering in his blood, a faint ache on his scalp, a strange and somewhat unfamiliar urge to be
John tries to grasp it, to fully take it in; the feeling of Sherlock’s hand against his own, not clasped together between the rumpled sheets of Sherlock’s bed late at night, but at the back of a London cab on a busy street at 5.27 pm.
A bite almost breaks the skin next to the base of his skull and a breath is held far too long before it’s let out.
“You wanted to show me that I don’t want this?” John says, now staring at Sherlock with no small amount of disbelief.
Feverishly fumbling for the bottle of lube in the creases and folds of the sheets, John lets himself get high on that very thought. Stroking his own cock with lube makes him realise that Sherlock’s cock might be in a similar state of ache. John leans over to get his hand underneath Sherlock, grabbing his cock and stroking it three times before letting it jut back against the tense stomach that his own knuckles had just grazed.
They don't say much to each other as they get home. They heat some food from the fridge, they watch the news, and then John is off to bed. Sherlock, attempting to read through the files they got, gives up after an hour, heading to his own bedroom and one more night of insomnia.
He needs to be able to make a rational decision about his own potential death, but unfortunately, he’s in no fit state for rational decisions at the moment. So however futile it might seem, he needs to do something about said state.
- Sherlock reaches for the package of anxiolytics that has now moved to the drawer in his bedside table.
And as John gives in to exhaustion, letting his forehead come down to rest against Sherlock's shoulder for a few breaths before gathering the strength to take a step back, to allow their eyes to meet, that's what he'll remember as the only truly shocking thing in all of this.
On the screen, a few short comments appear, along with Sophia’s current contact information. It only takes Sherlock a minute to compose an email to the address provided by Beta. In less than ten minutes, he receives a reply.
'Yes…or we could leave her with Mrs Hudson? I’m sure she wouldn’t mind and it’ll be pleasant just the two of us.’
'Not yet. Would you like it if I kissed and sucked and even bit you here?' He gave the nipple a slight tug, just a soft pain to test the waters.
He lent down and kissed the younger man fully, not seeming to care what had just been where his tongue now was. 'You're so brilliant Sherlock, so good for me' John kissed and praised him until he regained his control. 'You were going to cum just from sucking my cock weren't you love?'
John however was never one to be put off by mere reputation; he was an army doctor and had been in situations most men wouldn't wish on their worst enemies.
Sherlock was lying in his chair, legs over one arm head stretched back over the other, with Rosie asleep on his stomach when John walked in.
By the time they got back to Baker Street John was disappointed he hadn’t thought to prolong the evening, he hesitated briefly before digging around in his pocket for the keys. Sherlock was waiting at the bottom of the steps 'I enjoyed tonight John’ he said shyly, looking more at his shoes than at John himself.
Their breathing was harsh and fast in the now quiet room; John lent up and kissed Sherlock as he slowly removed himself from his new favourite place. ‘You are the most amazing man I’ve ever met. And as soon as I can feel my limbs I’m going to carry you to that bath and worship you properly’
As the first button popped open John lent forwards and placed a kiss in Sherlock’s jugular notch, John continued unbuttoning his shirt and placing kisses down the centre until there was enough space to uncover Sherlock’s  nipples.
John pulled off Sherlock and got to his knees and took himself in hand, he stroked himself hard and fast remembering the way Sherlock had looked and sounded as he came, and the way his hole had fluttered against  John’s finger as his hot cum had flooded John’s mouth. With a strained groan John came over Sherlock’s stomach and crotch, when the aftershock had stopped he lowered himself down to lie next to Sherlock.
'First I want you on your knees. I want to see you suck me and I want to bury my hands in your gorgeous curls as I take my pleasure' Sherlock felt weak in the knees, almost as if he would fall then and do just as the doctor wanted 'You'd look so pretty I would want to finish right there and see you swallow all I'd give you but you're far too delicious to stop so soon. You're right, I want so badly to bring you pleasure too, I would undress you slowly.'
“Jesus Haploid Christ, Sherlock Holmes, you are a marvel,” John whispers in awe. Their cocks are touching – barely – through their trousers. John resists the urge to rip both their clothes off in favor of getting on all fours to surround Sherlock’s head with his hands and Sherlock’s hips with his knees, hemming Sherlock in, as it were. As much as he wants to take, to claim, to mark, he just as much wants Sherlock to build an exquisite room in his mind palace in which to tuck this memory.
He turns to see John Watson beside him at the bench, smiling but smiling through tears. He takes both of Sherlock’s hands in his and begins to speak, his voice barely above a whisper.
From that chance meeting grew a steady friendship that had seen Mrs. Hudson moving home to England and starting a new life, free and safe. They had maintained contact while Sherlock had been in and out of drug rehabilitation centres, and when Sherlock was kicked out of his flat on Montague Street, well, Martha Hudson would rather sleep naked in a metre of snow than let that young man be homeless. She marched down to his favourite sweets shop, bought some raspberry tarts, and walked the streets until she found him huddled behind a set of bins outside a restaurant eating food he’d scavenged. She’d yanked him – lovingly – by the arm and walked him several kilometres back to her Baker Street flat, where she’d made him a cuppa, served him a tart, and told him that from now on he would be her tenant at 221B. They’d work out the rent details later.
- and Victoria places it on the ground in front of Sherlock, who wastes no time in applying all six feet, one hundred eighty pounds of himself into smashing the goblet into infinitesimal crystalline shards. John gazes at Sherlock and thinks Sherlock’s smile at successfully smashing the past could light a thousand candles in the night.
. He would swear that Rosie smiles at the feel of her father’s heartbeat against her cheek. He watches John’s face, a smile mingled with tears, as he kisses Rosie’s forehead. For his part, Sherlock allows her to grasp his index finger with the hand not currently on her back, and he begins to sing her the same French lullaby as he did at their first meeting. Together John and Sherlock envelop Rosie as she moves from this world to whatever comes next. John feels rather than sees Rosie’s body relax when her final breath leaves her tiny body. His shoulders heave with sobs as he holds her even more tightly to his chest. Tears flow from Sherlock’s eyes as he kisses the tiny hand over and over. They stay like that for what feels to them like days but by the clock is twenty-three minutes. Time of death 11.48.
, sweat-slick bodies entwined, orgasms taken and given, hope that the lover will recognise that he is also the beloved, all these and more are contained in one box in John Watson’s pocket.
The cab ride home is a torturous fifteen minutes made even more so by the occasional hand trailing up a thigh but not quite where it needs to be, a couple fingers sucked in silence, a few ravenous glances. They practically fall out of the cab before it stops, Sherlock tossing a fare plus a generous tip at the cabbie as they unlock the front door and are up the stairs and into the sitting room before their cab has pulled away. Sherlock closes the sitting room door behind them and pulls John to himself
“Until that point no one had ever wanted anything to do with me. Apart from Mycroft – such as he is – no one gave me even the time of day. When I told you that people generally said ‘piss off’ I wasn’t exaggerating. I grew used to being labelled a freak, a bastard, a faggot, whatever insult was popular that week.
he wants to know. I tell him that I have not, because that is the truth. I have been propositioned, but I have never seen the draw nor had the desire before now.
Sherlock glances down at sleeping Rosie and casts a sideways glance at the nurse on the other side of the isolette, who nods her assent with John’s statement. The faintest of smiles creeps into Sherlock’s countenance and his shoulders visibly relax.
They arrive at the NICU, do the requisite three-minute handscrub, and the same nurse that sent John home yesterday is here today. “Mr. Watson, so good to see you again, Rosie will be glad you’re here.” Normally he’d write that kind of statement off as bollocks –
One thing John Watson has known about Sherlock Holmes for many years is that despite the indifferent façade he presents to most of the world, Sherlock cares. He cares so deeply,
From the window Sherlock sees the cab pull up and is down the stairs and has the door to 221B open before John can retrieve his meagre belongings, pay his fare, and step away from the kerb. Sherlock can’t quite put it into words, but John has aged a decade in a day, and Sherlock fights to regain his composure.
John and Sherlock visit Rosie again. There is an extremely difficult discussion to be had and John has to make a decision no parent should ever have to make.
Sherlock shuffles in the doorway of the flat, suit jacket in hand, obviously uneasy. “John…I-…I’m not sure the best way to ask you this.”
John continues to slowly undress me, leaving kisses where my clothes once were, lavishing praise on this body I once viewed only as transport. I am torn between begging him to rush because I want him inside me right this second and wanting the bliss as pure as any I’ve ever injected into my veins to last eternally. My clothes come off entirely and, as he has never done before when we’ve made love, rolls me onto my stomach. I begin to tell him
It has been a monumental task on the part of the grooms to keep from seeing one another before the ceremony’s start, but they’ve accomplished it with the help of some well-placed curtains beside the
John rings for the nurse and immediately the room is a flurry of sounds and of people who unplug things, reassure Mary that she’s going to be in capable hands in theatre, and talk to John to keep him in the loop of information. There are no consents to sign, as the physicians had taken care of that when they’d realised they were dealing with abruptio placentae and knew a caesarean might be a possibility.
As if I cannot feel any more bliss, John begins to move inside me, at first infinitesimally slowly. My legs wrap around his waist once more because I do not want him going anywhere. He leans down – or do I pull him down? – to kiss me. My arms are around his neck and I want us to stay like this forever. It is impossible to know where I stop and where John begins.
John Watson, always the good soldier. John Watson, always the little boy trying to stay out of trouble and do what he thinks is right. Same story, writ larger and later. He loathes the woman beside him, but his daughter is still his daughter.
John lets go of Sherlock’s right hand and bends retrieves the box from his pocket. In one motion John bends to one knee and pulls the ring from it to slip on Sherlock’s left ring finger. He kisses the back of Sherlock’s hand before asking,
I am speechless and cannot begin to articulate exactly what else it is that I want. “Please. I want you.”
It is an unseasonably warm day for London, as if nature herself has given her blessing for the wedding of William Sherlock Scott Holmes and John Hamish Watson to be held outdoors at Bingham Gardens overlooking the Thames. Cumulus clouds against the backdrop of a Caribbean-blue sky causes all eyes to squint as the celebrant takes her place under the
John is zipping his jacket when Sherlock looks up from the sofa, the question in his eyes before it leaves his mouth. “Do you want me to go back to hospital with you, John?”
Sherlock turns his gaze toward John on the sofa, his vision blurry through tears, and sees John as he must’ve been at twenty. Gone are the worry wrinkles, the furrowed brow, the lines around John’s eyes that aged him unfairly. John’s ocean-blue eyes sparkle and he smiles the smile of a man given a third second chance.
Sherlock stares blankly for a few seconds, then queries incredulously, “You….are inviting me? You are saying you want me there
“The little gir-….the bee suit…..I just – I can’t do this, John,” Sherlock manages to grit out between sobs and ragged, heaving breaths. “She just-….she’s gone and…I loved her and she’s gone and it’s SO bloody unfair,” he spits out, the last few words coming rapid-fire-machine-gun style before he collapses into more sobs in the middle of the floor at Sainsbury’s, tears pouring from his eyes and mucus dripping out his nose and he does not move to wipe way either.
“John,” Sholto says softly to me, almost inaudibly, “I’m glad to see you happy again.” With his good arm he takes my hand.
Without further ado Sherlock spins around and braces himself against the sitting room door. Mrs. Hudson or the neighbors might hear, but all Sherlock can think about is having John’s cock inside him.
As the physician turns to leave, a voice calls. “Doctor, what about kangaroo care?” Sherlock inquires. “I did some research overnight and found that kangaroo care is good for both babies and their parents. John would like that.”
Sherlock is almost ready to retire his violin when he feels a pair of arms around his waist and the soapy citrus scent of John’s freshly-washed hair behind him. “Mmmmmm, I was getting lonely,” he smiles as he lays his violin down to find John’s hands clasped around his waist. He leans back into John’s embrace and stays that way, gently swaying side to side in the arms of this man who has endured so much and chooses to make Sherlock’s heart his home.
In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate of a chemical reaction without having its own chemical composition permanently altered.
Sherlock’s coming undone here, he isn’t sure which way to go. Go backward to John and John’s cock brushes against that beautiful bundle of nerves deep inside, and forward to fuck into John’s hand, the pre-come slicking him up just enough to build friction, John’s wedding band rolling against his shaft and frenulum and heightening what is already an impossibly glorious sensation.
“Darling, you need to eat,” John finally offers as he places a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s temple. John rises to put the kettle on.
The nurse – Rebecca, her name badge reads – hands Rosie to John while Rebecca gathers all the lines and tubing attached to Rosie in order to transfer it all smoothly from the isolette to John’s arms. She has John lean back in a reclining chair someone has kindly brought to the bedside. Together they bring Rosie to John’s bare chest, taking care not to disrupt the IV in her umbilical vein as the nurse lays Rosie on her father’s chest. She is lying on her side looking up at her father so her exposed brain does not touch John’s skin and so the umbilical intravenous line is not compromised.
