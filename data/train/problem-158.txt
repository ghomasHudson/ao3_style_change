Sherlock steepled his fingers under his chin, concentrating on the feel of his callus finger tips to calm his rattled nerves. He closed his eyes and began the retreat into the refuge of his mind palace. Facts, facts had always been his closest ally and his best friend (besides John of course) and when John pulled away, to facts he would return.
It was within the pages of Homer that Sherlock found his first dynamic view of witches, in the descriptions of Calypso and Medea. Of course, he knew they were portrayed as villains, wicked women who were punished for their use of magic, but their power and their respect for the earth and the gods stood unwavering beneath the scorn of their contemporaries and their author and creator. From these descriptions Sherlock began his search for all things Witchcraft. After a few false starts with the Scarlet Letter, Witch of Blackbird Pond, and a few others, Sherlock finally found a beginner’s guide to the art of Wicca. Inside that book and the many many others that followed, Sherlock found a home for himself and his persistent curiosity. He found that there was always a new angle, a new opinion on the mercurial garden that is magic.
“You’ve been spot on thus far, like always. Nessie is mum’s third cousin twice removed, whatever that means. I am from the north, crawled out of a bog around 32 years ago to start living as a human. There’s…” even with the seriousness of the situation Sherlock could see John’s lip quirk, “not much higher education out on the fens.”
“So, what’s new on Hegg? What are the headlines. The gossip. What exactly have I missed.” It was far too much to ask for a murder but perhaps a robbery or
, her genius and hardship struck a chord in his young soul that he couldn’t fully articulate, most of the other books in the section were drivel. He knew of vaguely of witches from other Roald Dahl books, but those had sent him whimpering through the darkness into Mycroft’s room for several nights after finishing it. He had explored the biography section from Black Bart to Mary Read and more. Those had sent him gallivanting into Mycroft’s room like the swashbuckling scalawag he was, for weeks afterwards he was the scourge of Mycroft’s waking moments, poking and prodding him constantly with his miniature cutlass and rapier.
With at least the rough outline of a plan, Sherlock leapt into action. He stood abruptly and surveyed the flat as it stood, no movement from the kitchen, bathroom or stairs, Sherlock knew that Ms. Hudson had taken her “herbal soother” for the night and wouldn’t be in any state to interrupt them. With an empty kitchen and a still house the only place John could be is in his bedroom, where he’d been spending an increasing amount of time for coincidently 3 days, 4 hours and 57 minutes. Turning a keen ear towards the stairs to John’s room and above, Sherlock heard the tell-tale rustling of John getting ready for bed and for his nightly wank.
Apache Tear: They will raise your ability to recognize the approach of menacing situations, where you may be at risk.
Eventually he extracted enough mush, and he was able to take his first halting steps off the pier and onto the island, trousers covered in mud and the indent from his ring fresh enough to be visible to a keen observer. Within a few moments the rain began its assault, slicing almost horizontally through the air and clinging to his limp curls before straightening them with the weight.
Finally, John stood, suddenly in a jerky movement that Sherlock would usually attribute to his limp but now obviously a result of his tail. This abrupt movement on John’s part knocked Sherlock into a tense silence, without even thinking about it, Sherlock began to fidget, lacing and unlacing his fingers as he found himself unable to look at John’s face any longer. Despite his hesitance, he couldn’t help but notice that John was slowly making his way over to Sherlock’s side of the room.
Curling his fist around the aging ship’s railing, Sherlock wished the rickety, rusted ferry would sink straight into the sea before he had to face his brother without the fiance he had hinted to.
After the cacophony had ended, Sherlock could suppress his gruesome curiosity no longer and he spun, expecting to find that he had hallucinated or even been drugged by some long-forgotten member of Moriarty’s web. Alas life and chance had never been kind to Sherlock before and this was not to be the day that lady luck shined in his favor and when his eyes found John’s across the room, it was almost like Sherlock hadn’t just seen that he was a lizard disguised as a human.
“You’re too late, Sherlock Holmes. He’s mine now!” Philip hissed towards him before stretching his face into an almost manic smile and continuing down the aisle.
He slept less, ate less, and his deductions turned from brutally honest but fair to vitriolic and uncalled for. He accepted his continued solitude and learned to tune out the obscenities often shouted his way on the rare occasions he attended lecture. Though nothing truly interested him, Sherlock began to explore the underbelly of London during his free time. He learned every street and alley within days, the unfortunate souls who could be tempted to speak after a kind word, within the month after that, and was given his first hit of cocaine exactly four weeks and 3 days after he began his explorations of London.
, given to him by the kindly librarian after his 100th official borrow of the novel, and his beloved violin as well loved and well cared for as the day he began lessons.
Like a newborn colt Sherlock stumbled into the church proper, just as the music swelled to a crescendo. Mortifyingly all eyes, including Victor’s, turned to him, drenched and wrapped in a threadbare white blanket that was older than he was.
The first thing he noticed was that John, in the corner in front of his dresser and mirror was hunched in an odd way. He had too many angles and seemed to be spilling out of his sweater. It couldn’t be comfortable, the way John held his head, so that not even a hint of it could be seen. There was a soft hissing that filled the room, it seems to come from John’s direction but that made no sense, he didn’t have any alarms or text tones that sounded anything like it, Sherlock had memorized them all.
She thieves a look at the screen of his phone, holding it towards her tired eyes. She asks, voice thick with fatigue, ‘What is this?’
Greg clamps his eyes shut, thumbs halting. He swiftly turns to stare at John, asking, ‘Wh-what do you mean?’
‘You knew we couldn’t skip this conversation.’ Mycroft has his left finger on his mouth, thinking, ‘He’s back then…’
‘It’s a beautiful thing, I think it’s the most beautiful kind of memory our brain can have for ages keeping the memory intact, as if it happened yesterday, thanks to that smell or that sound we are connected to that memory forever…’
‘Johnny Rockets, it’s a 50’s American Diner, with posters of old movie stars. It’s a typical American pub, but they have waiters dressed as movie characters and they serve hamburgers, steaks, and salads….you know, the usual.’
A man walks out Sherlock bedroom’s door, looking at his phone on his hands, not noticing John’s presence in the apartment.
“I don’t fucking care about safety! You’re just making up excuses again! Shut up!!! Shut up!! I don’t want to hear you anymore! I don’t care anymore! Go away!! Go away from my life!”
Sherlock follows the smaller blonde as he hails a cab, and keeps watch until it pulls away with John inside.
‘Sherlock, I told you- you must inform me when you get this kind of information. The police can start doing a proper search if you tell us ASAP.’
They quickly run past the crown and the barriers toward a waiting taxi. The press, and the crowd attempts to follow them, until the cab leaves them all behind.
Victor is sitting in front of Sally, her arms crossed. Mary is standing next to her, the record player is on.
Mrs. Hudson smiles, ‘They must be Sherlock’s fans!’ She follows John, and joins him peering out of the large window.
‘Oh, we can help you’ Sherlock forces the door, pushing it, and walking inside ‘Doctor Watson and I took a volunteer course’
'And this person, my Best Man, is here...’ John, smiles at Sherlock, and everyone begins clapping and staring expectantly.
‘No, it’s set in the Victorian era, he’ll be different...they can’t portrait a gay detective who was in love with his bisexual flatmate and split up after he faked his death. It’s 1895, darling.’
‘Well that’s another topic, because from her point of view she’s constantly hurt by a man who betrays her, her husband. She’s beautiful and rich, and she incarnates the dream Gatsby wants to reach, his vision of the American dream. She’s a victim of the two men, because one betrays her and the other one just wants her like a toy, because she reminds him of the past. And it doesn’t matter what’s her life about, what Gatsby wants is a life like the old days with her and I think she’s a victim of his obsessions, too’
He huffs out, exhausted, then sees a little box on the left door, with blue screen and black buttons on it.
‘I’ll be out for work, John, I already told you.’ Sitting on the sofa, dejected ‘But you probably forgot it..’
John sips tea, then puts the cup on the table and looks at Greg ‘I thought I understood him, I thought that I didn’t need to talk to him to really understand him but I was wrong,…. I don’t understand him, or at least not anymore, and he’s angry, and I know he has his right reasons, but I would like to understand to make him feel better’
Greg “ You think she didn’t know what Daniel was up to? Do you think she didn’t know he was involved in this case?"
He surfs the channels, and stops when spots the news. A reporter is in fact, just outside 221 Baker Street. They can see the fans stretch out on either side, shouting and clamoring at the police near them. The reporter is obviously talking about the explosion. ‘
‘Well, looks like your fan forgot that you eat eggs for breakfast’ John comments sarcastically at Sherlock with a tight smile.
‘When I arrived with my brother the first day, and the assistant showed us all the university rooms and halls. When we entered in the library, a small group of us, there were many people reading silently, and when Victor saw us....
‘Sherlock needs to eat or he’ll faint. Plus he needs to assimilate the drug. Thus, he needs food. He needs to eat. Go buy something - steaks.’
John gets closer to him, looking into his eyes, behind the sad smile. “I know this period is not great for you,...and I know you probably need someone you want to talk to, so...if you need anything, or just..somebody...even if,..even if we-
"You did it, all by yourself, with your own hands. And you know why? Because you don't know humanity. You would like to be a mother, a woman in love, but you're not."
Sherlock slides into the kitchen, and flips on the kettle. Then he nervously walks around the kitchen, seemingly without aim, and John stares up at him.
Victor students clap their hands while Victor walks through the hall and everyone turn to stare at him.
‘I don’t know…I didn’t see much, to be honest,….when he turned a page I saw these polaroids of a young boy, I don’t know much…’
“You just want Victor to be involved in the case because you can’t admit to yourself he’s my boyfriend."
‘Yesterday evening. He flew to Berlin in the early afternoon, but he didn’t notice somebody was following him. The German Police found him dead in his apartment.’
The telephone on the furniture next to the dinner table starts ringing, it automatically takes the call on speakerphone. A robotic voice is heard.
John is quickly running out of breath, and huffs though sharp inhales, ‘I can’t see him anymore, Sherlock!’
The car leaves the hospital to go to the cemetery. Sherlock and Mary are sitting next to each other, he looks tired, dejected, Mary looks nervous "Why I'm here?"
Victor opens the door, but Sherlock stops him. “What should I do with your dog? Shouldn’t he get out or something?”
“Nothing, I....I never thought we could...get into this...really be into a relationship, you and me...something,..serious. I thought it was something pointless for you, just for the sex..."
Sherlock drags John to the dance floor without needing further encouragement, and though he didn’t recognize the music playing his hips immediately started moving with it rhythmically as he walked onto the dance floor.
‘We sang it wrong! I was supposed to sing the part, ‘you’re the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye, did ya think I’d crumble, did you think I’d lay down and dieeee?’
‘CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAN YOU HEAR WHAT I’M SAYING? I SAID I NO HOSPITAL! TAKE HIM BACK TO BAKER STREET! SAY WHAT AGAIN AND I’LL HAVE YOUR HEAD!
Two policemen block him, grabbing him by the arms, Victor sits down again ‘Sherlock, what am I doing here?? Please, tell them, tell them I have nothing to do with Moran, Jesus Christ, I was at university, everyone saw you arrested me, you can’t treat me like that’
‘Come on, the books are well written, and anyway, it’s only based on your character, I mean...the Sherlock Holmes won’t be exactly like you’
‘It’s a special day, there are exceptions!’ Lestrade, tried to keep his voice down, but he knew he’d failed when Sherlock almost spit out his wine with a loud chortle.
Sherlock turns again, the sheet now is up his hip, he puts his arm under the head ‘Come on, publish them’
‘Sherlock.’ John sits down next to Molly, but she stands up to give him some space. John scoots closer to the prone consulting detective. ‘How do you feel?’ he takes Sherlock’s hand, ‘You’re cold.’
‘Hey’ John whispers softly. The sound gets lost, but Sherlock returns the smile that accompanies the intimate greeting.
‘When I decided to get married you weren’t still back, you weren’t alive, I thought you were dead, Sherlock, did you already forget it?—Oh, Please stop it!’ shouting at the taxi driver.
Mycroft turns, hinting a smile ‘No. He would turn mad.’ He closes the drawer, taking more clothes from the bag. ‘Did you watch the tv show last night?’
‘Moran,’ Sherlock replies, as he walks around the office, gesticulating. ‘He did all this because we were proceeding well, he wanted to warn me, he wanted to draw the attention of the media to mess up everything. The media confuse, they…. create fictions…they change words…he wanted to stop me because I was getting too close to him.’
“Poor girl...” His grimace expresses his displeasure. He looks at Sherlock. “So....are you sure about it?..”
Mycroft stretches out on the chair, getting his hands together, thinking ‘Well,...that’s debatable.’
‘I think he’ll like to…settle down. He’s always wanted that.’ Lestrade gently expresses before raising his voice again, huffing 'Still...I can’t get over the fact that you’re calling me past midnight, complaining about this! It’s ridiculous Sherlock!’
Mycroft insists, trying to convince him, lowering his voice, speaking softly “Do it for me. It’s for your safety. If you don’t find her, you’ll risk your life. And I won’t let it happen.”
‘Why do you think Adair wanted Woodley to kill Moran?’ Tanaka finally hands the letter to Sherlock’s greedy hands.
After dancing a bit, he sits on the sofa, and takes out his five-pound note. He starts to roll it, still singing.
Sherlock suddenly answers with his usual sarcastic, bitter tone ‘Do not laud him too much Mrs Hudson, he’s already above himself’ Then keeps tapping on his phone while talking to his brother. ‘So, you’ve got news about the car’
‘Yes, Adair wrote him this code to tell Tanaka he was hiding something in the hotel room, Tanaka disassembled and assembled the room but never found it, because Adair hide it outside the room, on the balcony’
Sherlock is in the kitchen, conducting an experiment, the television blares from the livingroom area in the backgroung. The flat is quiet without John.
Mycroft waits before answering, feeling Sherlock's stress and rage. “..You don’t have to go with me, if you don’t want to.”
‘Uh… well, she complained that he’s always busy, and they don’t have time for themselves. You know…’
‘Booooooooooored!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m BOOOORED!!! My brother gave me those damn pills and I feel like I’m collapsing any moment, I can’t even talk and think properly, I….’ he goes toward the big sofa and falls into it ‘I want to……do something, NOW!’
While the shots quickly absorb into their bloodstreams, all three are frozen, until Greg slams a hand on the table ‘I think I’m going to vomit.’
‘MYCROFT!’ Sherlock shouts from the kitchen, scolding his brother for the wrong assumption. John looks bewildered at Mycroft, who tries to answers, a little embarrassed, stuttering ‘I---I didn’t mean,..that..way,..absolutely’ smiling oddly.
Mycroft turns away from the drawers, glowering at his brother. Sherlock moves round Mycroft, reaching into the drawers for a fancy shirt, ‘I don’t suggest you to wear one of those to bed. You won’t be comfortable.’ Mycroft assures.
Sherlock doesn’t see him as he watching John close the door behind him, and Greg starts washing his left arm, looking annoyed.
John bends over Sherlock and picks up the adrenaline-filled needle. He opens the sealed packaging, and prepares for the injection. ‘Take his shirt off and find his heart’ he says somewhat calmly.
Art is by Peter P. Plasencia - The Man Who Invented the Future (Franz Born's biography of Jules Verne), 1964.
Sherlock starts playing with the bed’s sheets, moving them, making waves and playing with his hands, laughing, he turns back and sees the Polaroid and smiles at it
‘By the time you finish the call your lunch will be cold.’ Sherlock calls, hoping his bold voice would breach the wood and walls.
John makes a beeline through the policemen, straight towards Sherlock and Lestrade, slamming the door behind him.
When he does not speak, the man continues, ‘You are so full of yourself. You can’t even understand what’s really going on - that Sherlock might need somebody he can actually talk to.’
‘Eh?’ Sherlock regards him with confusion, as John is not normally one to invade others’ boundaries. John continues despite the look, and leans in to wrap his arms around the lanky consulting detective.
He rubs Sherlock’s back, then down to his butt with both hands, pushing him against the seat. ‘Mmmmm’
Sherlock takes a long breath ‘Well you know...sometimes it’s not that easy. It’s better to shut yourself off and go on than face what society bans as different still today’
Sherlock turns his head toward the left, as if he’s going to look closer at the polaroid, thinking. ‘It’s…strange….’
‘Because it’s better, there are sheets that can make good contrast with black and white, with your body,… do you like the idea?’
‘and….he said me that I had to go to Sherlock’s house to….you know…check on him…’ he coughs, looking around, at the cab window, outside, turning the windscreen wiper on ‘this damn car glass is always so dirty, isn’t it?’
The man’s eyes widen, as he realizes what John truly means. He tries queries, ‘Are you accusing me of what happened to-’
‘Interesting, it tickles on the left side of your neck, and yet, when my lips are on the right side- you become aroused.'
‘Stop shouting! Jane is sleeping for pete’s sake, but yes, yes I know. What’s the problem? You knew this.’
He looks at Sherlock not understanding anything of the courses ‘Ok..let’s make something easy..I can make a delicious Pan Bagnat’
They arrive at Greg’s house, he leans back, still sitting, closing his eyes for a bit, taking long breaths.
Sherlock reaches over his plate, for packet of biscuits. Sharply, the pirates’ packet is torn open, crumbs spilling out over the last of his steak. Eyebrows rising as his eyes catch sight of the picture on the packet, Sherlock gobbles the biscuits.
John's face turns serious, not expecting those words. 'Ok, but don't say I'm not trying to do something for us!!'
‘and we spent days not going to university and running through the bouvelard listening to Oasis….we were so 90s!’ Sherlock comments laughing
“Yes, I did..but..I don’t think that’s appropriate right now, after what happened...there’s the dean too, he wouldn’t approve it.”
‘Mmmm’ He stands on the sofa, with his knees on it, thinking, looking around  ‘If you…want to have fun, we could..do it on…the table?’
John realizes himself, astonished. As his mouth widens, wordless and gaping, Mycroft answers, ‘Your t-shirt, John, the one you made.’
"The last piece you wanted to kill to get your new identity. But it can't be enough...you killed all those people...Adair..Tanaka, Sarah.." Sherlock takes a deep breath "Victor..."
Sherlock goes toward the sofa, taking his scarf, ignoring Mrs. Hudson, just answering to Greg ‘Just go on the history event and you’ll read all the passages the program did’
‘I see…’ looking at Sherlock ‘Not in that---way, I mean I know that you’ve been busy because,…you know…rehab…and….’ Coughing ‘pills…’ trying not to look embarrassed.
‘I named it <<The Moody Detective>>, it’s elegant, smooth, witty, sweet and clever, just like you.’ ‘Nice, very nice, indeed’ looking at his moleskine, still sketching.
‘You could eat for months with all this food, Sherlock!’ she comments, finally deciding on a strawberry.
‘And so, Adair comes out of prison, wanting to meet Moran. Wanting to have his portion of the reward, but Moran kills him.’
‘He’s the one who avoids me, it seems like I can’t help him anymore, doing everything by his own and always hanging out with...Victor’ He steps forward, talking closely ‘Sherlock has changed, Mycroft. And he’s slowly replacing me with Trevor in his life.’
They decide with a nod, and start following the cab, sometimes taking different ways, John is thoughtful; Greg looks at him with concern.
He timorously grins, standing statute without speech for a moment. Then, taking in a deep breath, closes his eyes.
‘What? lowering his head, and looking through the spy-hole. He can’t see anything, then comes back trying to open the door, but it’s still closed.
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, in the living room, next to Sarah’s mother and Sarah’s sister, Melanie. She’s comforting her mother, holding her hands.
Do something useful: call Lestrade, wake him up, and tell him to meet us at Tonkotsu Bar in 10 minutes.
‘Yes, to be honest it’s not 100% guarantee that you’ll not get diseases or infections. I mean you could still get a fever after the vaccine, but we decided to…’
John Rance is keeping a sheet on his hands, looking down and to the audience of people and press in front of him, clearly moved.
The press is outside the flat, waiting to see someone coming outside to take a photo and get an interview. Mrs. Hudson is downstairs, hearing the press outside chatting and calling her, but she refuses to go out.
Sherlock nods, and mutters something John takes for an affirmation as he steers them toward the VIP section. John looks around at the sea of people, when a nearby man dances closer, a drink sloshing as he moves. He’s singing along with the music, but exaggerating the words as it’s too loud to hear himself.
Woodley doesn’t answer, but continues to mix the martini. Once he’s done, he drops it in front of Sherlock, and rest his hands on the bar. He takes a long breath, obviously choosing his words carefully, ‘Yeah, maybe. Why?’
‘Because you’re my friend, and John is my friend too. And I saw what he went through when you died Sherlock. I know he cares about you, and I think you two should talk to…..just close this argument forever and come back together.’
Greg, Sherlock, John and Molly are having a night out at the pub. During the dinner, there are flashbacks about the week Sherlock passed during John's absence. As usual, to listen to the songs ---> right click and 'open in a new window'.
‘Oh, I trust you, because he didn’t do receipts, absolutely nothing, I bet he neither had any kind of agenda..’
Greg turns toward Sherlock ‘Boy---hey, if you’re implying anything—‘he follows him in the bathroom, where the alarm is still on, and digits the numbers: 29 – 01 –10.
‘You should see how the assistant looked at me, she probably thought I had to feed a herd of kids.’ He continues to munch with a satisfied smile ‘well, perhaps she wasn’t too far off.’
When he’s taken a sufficient number of grainy photos, he pockets the phone, picks up two shots, and juts his chin out in a motion that encourages Sherlock and John to do the same. ‘Okay boys, down the hatch!’ He raises up the little glass with rum, gulps it down and quickly follows with the vodka. ‘Jesus,’ he coughs out, ‘smooth.’
‘MYCROFT, YOUR BROTHER IS DYING IN MY LAP. HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO SAVE HIM, CAN YOU TELL ME?’
Greg remains silent for few moments before saying, ‘I think we should leave….’ He gives a sweeping hand gesture to the building, ‘I mean we know where he’s at. I’ll call him tomorrow morning.’
Lestrade walks out, still not saying a word, trying to think what to say. He walks up and down the kitchen, crinkling his hair ‘Jesus, jeeeeeesus, fuck’ he whispers, then walks quickly toward Sherlock’s door, not getting inside
‘Looking for Daniel, he’ll tell us who’s Moran. Victor, don’t worry, you’ll get out of this mess soon.’
Richard Brook smiles, giggling with the actors "I don't know, I'm glad I'm part of this show, and we are all proud of this success, this is all thanks to our devoted fans."
Sherlock is curled up on the sofa, face shoved into the cushions, with a hand dragging on the floor. Mycroft marches lightly up the stairs, disregarding the door knocker. Crossing the threshold to the flat, he pauses to to stare at his younger brother for a moment before tapping the floor with his umbrella. Sherlock grunts, but doesn’t move a muscle.'Sherlock'
‘Sebastian Moran killed the surgeon Fox one month after the surgery, running him over a street. Then he gave himself the time to come back from the holiday to cicatrize the stitches of the operation.’
He tries to hold the tears “Why you didn’t tell me anything? I would have saved you! You would be here now.” He rests a red rose on Victor's grave, whispering "Thank you...thank you for everything, thank you for teaching me how to love, thank you for teaching me how to forgive, that kindness is a form of strength, that we should always believe in what we do, and never give up, even when the whole world is against us."
Sherlock’s still laying on his bed, naked, with just the sheet covering down below his body, completely indifferent, smiles at him ‘See you after’
The announcer is back on the stage and interrupts their moment with a loud speech, ‘LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE MOMENT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. THE KU CLUB KARAOKE CONTEST!’ The crowd erupts in enthusiastic applause, hoots and whistles.
John smiles, confused, narrowing his eyes. Sherlock is walking closer to him, excited, fast-talking ‘We must go to the Jack London Inn Hotel. That’s where we started and where Tanaka went to find the message Adair left him. He never found it and Moran killed him because she thought Tanaka found the message Adair left him, it’s something that reveals her identity. The message Tanaka gave me—‘
Sherlock ferociously devours a steak. Mycroft loiters about in pajamas next to him, peering at his outfit. Sherlock’s t-shirt reaches his belly, up the navel.
‘What you mean when you say he helped Sherlock to get through a bad period of his life? What are you referring to?’
Sherlock stands up, going toward the door “thank you for everything, keep us in contact and call me whenever she calls or if you know something new about her"
'Why must I repeat myself? I AM FINE. GO AWAY! Sherlock snatches a cascading pillow from the edge of the sofa, pitching it towards his elder brother’s form.Mycroft deftly swats the cushion away with the umbrella. Steps shouting against the floorboards, he stalks toward Sherlock’s bedroom.
He brings out a plastic bag with white powder inside, makes a fat line, and quickly snorts it. His head jerks back. His hands fly up to his nose, he feels like it’s on fire, then blood starts dripping from it. Sherlock tries to stands up, but he loses the control, and falls on his knee near the table. He starts shaking, everything spins around, and suddenly a terrible feeling of nausea catches his stomach, he tries to stand up again, but falls down on the floor. Blood still dripping down his nose, he wretches and heaves. He starts coughing, and choking.
‘I mean.. I’m not talking about the…gossip, or what everyone thought of you, I’m talking about what you or Sherlock felt for each other. It was just a friendship? We have to clarify this point because, otherwise, we have to see what’s happening from another point of view’
Greg relinquishes a swollen breath, rushing forward. The pair clash, arms entangled. John’s breaths were short and hasty, completely unfulfilling to his lungs. Greg continues to hold his friend until the last desperate gasps are eventually released… until John’s weeping was quieted.
‘Guys, could we please stop it, it really doesn’t matter, does it?’ Greg tries to settle the dust, smiling.
‘Yes, John, you say he’s your best friend, except that best friends tell everything to one another. You are not even able to ask him, who the man was in his apartment!’
“Too late to marry him,” the leader replied, even as she wrapped him in a blanket and pushed him inside to avoid the groom’s car’s approach.
Sherlock remained as distant to those around him as he’d ever been, but for the first time in his somewhat stinted life he had the freedom to construct his world around him. Within days of moving into his tiny flat on Montague Street, Sherlock began to cultivate his garden.
They stood like this for a few moments, breathing each other in and adjusting to the emotions that now sat heavy in the air between them. Eventually Sherlock lifted his head from what couldn’t have been a comfortable position under John’s chin and subtly wiped the corner of his eyes, trying to pretend that he was adjusting his constrictor-like grip on John. Before he could settle back into stillness John grasped his jaw and gently tipped it up so Sherlock had to meet his eyes. When John saw that slight shine and few droplets on Sherlock’s long eyelashes he couldn’t help but bring their lips together once again. This kiss was soft and gentle, just a slight pressure and the dry catching of their lips. Soon though the kisses turned from a demonstration of their devotion to something much more carnal. Dry turned wet, soft turned ever so slowly harder and light presses turned to nips along Sherlock’s plump lower lip.
When John had first moved into Baker Street, Sherlock had been careful to remove his beloved plants from most common spaces, fearing ridicule and derision from the doctor whose approval he craved. But as months passed and John continued to be his grumpy, but not cruel self, Sherlock slowly began moving his plants back out into the main areas of the flat. First into the sitting room, ivy winding around the knife stuck perpetually into the mantel, then onto bookshelves and windowsills almost blocking the weak London sunlight.
When John came back to himself, he realized that his hands had undertaken voyages without his conscious consent, one was slipping up Sherlock’s chest while the other took its time making its way to grip the firm one of the firm globes of his arse. John could practically feel Sherlock vibrating against him and firmly pulled them down onto John’s hereto forgotten bed.  With his hands slipping easily under Sherlock’s pants, John suddenly felt far over dressed for the situation. He pulled back, quickly divesting himself of his jumper, button up and trousers, leaving Sherlock and him on equal footing. With that out of the way John finally took a moment to stare down at the prize laid out below him.
If only the cure for a broken heart was as simple as that, as having the ocean swallow it down into its icy depths, Sherlock would jump down and join his,
“I’ll marry you, Sherlock. How old will you be in eight years?” the grandson asked, leaning further towards Sherlock.
Suddenly the creature began scrambling for something that lay discarded by its feet. When it finally grabbed it, with hands that were undoubtedly John’s, Sherlock saw that it was a rubbery horrible rendition of John’s face.
Thank you so much for reading! Eventually we will earn the explicit rating but until then, sit tight! I'm hoping to update this every few weeks.
Sherlock remembers almost everything that has ever happened to him, though there are blank spaces made during the Dark Ages of his university career. Unusual as it is, he remembers with vivid clarity the days and weeks before all of his (six) overdoses, but that first time, what must have hooked him is a blur, a blemish in his otherwise flawless Mind Palace. In the years since he broke the grip of cocaine Sherlock built his Palace up to the glorious structure that now stands erected in his cavernous mind, rivaling even Alexandria in both knowledge contained and beauty. He understands that most people who have the misfortune of making his acquaintance believe him to be an unfeeling machine, focused solely on the physical world, on what can be touched and seen, but most people are idiots.
After a few minutes of hapless dithering, he finally decided to walk in with a casual sexuality. He slipped his fingers to the button on the inside of his zip and carefully unhooked it, shimming his pants over his slim hips. Fingers wobbling with nervousness and some fear, he painstakingly undid each of the buttons on his shirt until it lay forgotten against his back. Breathing deeply, he made the last-minute decision not to knock, this couldn’t wait, it couldn’t be held back. This was happening now. With a calm he didn’t feel, Sherlock threw open John’s door and took several steps into the center of the room without even noticing the situation that greeted him.
“One of Lestrade’s sheep drowned. They had to fish it out with a curtain rail.” Mycroft responded sharply and then was quiet, even going to far as to remove his hands from his wheels so that Sherlock was his sole source of movement as they slogged through the mud towards the church.
Sherlock breathed in and out, calming himself and shutting out the world around him, he hadn’t realized his eyes were closed until he opened them to find himself in his mind palace and John standing before him. With careful steps, he approached him and took John’s injured hands softly in his.
After the first breathless exchange of kisses and desperately whispered “I love you”s, Sherlock lay curled inside the circle of John’s arms in his (their?) bed and thought of the little boy he had been when he read about Matilda finding her place in the universe, the boy he had been when cocaine stole his mind and body, and the man that now lay surrounded by the love of his life.
Instead, Sherlock ceased toying with the one remaining artifact from that ill fated romp into sentiment, held it glittering in the weak summer sun, and without fanfare or regret dropped it into the waveless water that surrounded him.
Mycroft’s chair suddenly stopped, nearly throwing the man off. He struggled uselessly for a few minutes to free the chair from its muddy prison before Sherlock stepped in and pushed him free. Embarrassed by the obviousness of Mycroft’s embarrassment, he quickly changed the subject.
“Mild out, isn’t it Mycroft? It’s this global warming.” As Sherlock removed his coat, the alpha of the group looked him up and down and with a sigh said, “Sherlock’s back I see.”
Instead of constant spell working, Sherlock turned first to his experiments, stealing microscopes, chemicals and specimen from the biology labs only to whole up in his dormitory for weeks poking and prodding tissue, algae or some intriguing mixture of the two. Only when the dormitory management and the university president firmly and repeatedly requested the immediate termination of his noxious gases, chemical fires, and decomposing frog remains, did Sherlock consider other means of clearing his mind.
“I needed a flat mate, Mike introduced us, and I was hooked. When I first saw you, I couldn’t believe my luck in you needing a flat mate, but I also couldn’t believe how incredibly smart you were, are, in seeing how depressed and listless I was. When you cured my limp and we laughed against that wall I realized that no threat could be worth giving up color in my life.”
Impossible though it seemed, John could see Sherlock working to forgive his grievous lies and breaches of trust. He couldn’t believe his good luck, that this man, this wonderful man had not only not run screaming when he had seen John’s scales but had almost immediately worried about John’s experience after being shot.
Of course, over the years Sherlock did discover a passion for crime solving and chemistry, but his reliance on salt, good thoughts and spells were never ever forgotten. In University, he had to give up, at least briefly, his rituals (the dorms didn’t allow fire or candles or candles on fire in large quantities). This proved harder to accommodate than Sherlock had expected and by the middle of his first semester his mind had begun to collapse in on itself, breaking him apart into the hopeful child that his Wicca practice had sustained and the darkness within him that formed from his childhood bullying and the constant and unapologetic scorn of his classmates that had followed him all the way to University.
Once he had collected his materials, Sherlock scurried back to the space in front of their bed to set up. He carefully flattened his scarf out, placing a candle on each corner, securing them to the floor, next he lit the candles with care to not catch his scarf or the flat ablaze, mixed the salt and water then settled himself in the right mindset to perform his spell.
tumbling ring among the rocks and crags and monsters at the bottom of the sea. Giving up and letting this latest in a lifetime of disappointments beat him was too much to bear for Sherlock though, and so he stood staring down into the growing waves of the darkened sea as his boat approached the dock.
‘What are you talking about, I was back, and we didn’t talk for days, then you came at home because you had to make a "speech" to me, and I realized it wasn’t about me but about your marriage, about Mary, and I accepted it’
At the nuzzle Sherlock eyes go wide, and he stammers out quietly, ‘we…uh. We sh-should go now John.’
Sherlock is aware of Mrs. Hudson’s voice filtering from downstairs. His phone is in his hand, he’s got a text.
“Russia. Moriarty kept the most influential part of his business in Russia: terrorists ready to act whenever and wherever he wanted. That’s where he and Moran built their empire, that’s where they ran the eastern world from. Each terrorist attack in the whole world was planned by them, with them....Sherlock was becoming a real threat, that’s why Moriarty wanted to stop him. But he survived, and Moran took his place, her plane is to destroy the man who destroyed her partner. She wants her revenge. That’s why she’s back."
‘Like a shit!’ He takes the pills pack on his hand and throw it on the table ‘These damn pills make my head spin like hell and I can’t even walk properly, I feel like somebody injected me an anesthetic, I’m a zombie!’
‘Sherlock..calm down, I...I just thought that you two had to clarify things...I didn’t know what he was going to tell you- honestly. Sherlock, you’re behaving like a child! John said he was getting married and now you’re calling in the middle of the night shouting at me? What did you expect when John came to Baker Street? You’re both grown men, supposedly! I don’t want to be rude, but Sherlock...things have changed. You know John has a fiancee, and a lovely one at that. Not to mention, she’s a brilliant agent, and she’s not like other girls John’s dated in the past.'
"I'm just saying that you're a killer. A born killer. You've always been, and you'll be Moran for the rest of your life. Moving on with another name, changing your face and getting married with John, that's you trying to hide in plain sight. But you're not like everyone else. You're a killer, and you can kill me right now, and impress everyone at Scotland Yard, fool Lestrade and the police, and have John back, and get on living your life as a normal human being. But it won't change your nature. You really think your life would have worked?"
“Me??? I’m out of mind!! Not you! Right? It's always my fault! You’ve been lying to me since the first day we met!”
The room appears to be spinning, and his stomach lurches as he sits upright. He pauses for a moment, trying to work up the energy to stand and make his way to the bathroom which he desperately needs.
Thankfully, John chooses the next moment to make an entrance into the office. Breaking some of the tangible tension, and gives an overly chipper, ‘Hello!’
John hangs up on him, as Greg careens back onto Baker Street. They drag a slightly awake Sherlock out the car and upstairs, into the living room. They put Sherlock on the sofa, and stare at him worriedly. His mouth is hanging open, and his eyes roll back into his head. Greg starts pacing back and forth along the room.
‘Maybe it was an unconscious move? Find another....friend to do with him the things he would have done with you?’
John walks in, gasping for breath, and looking pale. ‘Sher-‘ he huffs out, while stepping into the room.
Sherlock starts moaning, annoyed. He takes a pillow and throws it on the sofa, putting it under his head. Sherlock curls up.
Sherlock looks away, embarrassed. John stares at him going away, with his hands in the coat pockets. Mary watches the whole scene, and gets closer to John, her hands on his left shoulder. “John” she whispers, kindly.
‘Perfect!’ Sherlock exclaims. ‘You two are drunk as hell- we should go downstairs now to met Woodley!’
‘He always arrived when we were making love, what a drag!…I bet he already spied on you.’ he asks laughing
Mycroft “I’ve always known how to do it, I'm not that stupid. But I’ve always assumed there was someone else ready to do it for me.”
Greg was again rudely interrupted by Sherlock, ‘No, he actually wakes up early in the morning and Skype’s with Mycroft while he runs around the Park.’
Sarah is sitting on a bench under a tree, drinking a coke, Victor is next to her. Victor: ‘I see you’re a bit concerned, is it about the course?’
‘John, our honeymoon was a disaster, and you’re only focused on your blog, the case, and worried about Sherlock and his new fiancée, I wonder if you still care about me’
A strong wind prowls about outside, knocking on doors and shaking weakened window frames, but the crackling fire warms the living room. Sherlock stands stout, his dressing gown laced about his waist. He clutches his violin, gazing at the frosted glass of the window. Ignoring the setting beyond, neglecting to recognise his reflection, Sherlock stares unseeing.
John raises both his eyebrows in confusion, then turns Sherlock’s phone off. He turns the lamp off too, and curls back into Sherlock’s arms again. He reaches down, and pulls the sheet back up, to cover them both completely, then enfolds his arms around Sherlock’s body and his head back onto Sherlock’s chest, closing his eyes.
‘Mmm’ Sherlock takes another biscuit, dips it in the milk, but before he gets a chance to eat it, the biscuit falls in the milk, and some splatters onto Sherlock’s face.
He looks at him in silent, not replying, then gives him a soft, small kiss on Sherlock’s lips, smiling at him.
‘I’ve never liked him, he has always had a….bad influence on Sherlock. And now he’s back, and this is a bit bad news,…he’s not like John, you know’
‘I know, but it’s not that easy, plus we’re looking for illegal surgeons. These are people who do not certify their job, they’re hidden, they have different day jobs, and perform surgeries at the night, it will be hard.’
"But he's different from other heroes. Batman is Bruce Wayne, Spiderman is Peter Parker. When Sherlock Holmes gets up in the morning, he is not Sherlock, he mustn't put on a costume to become the genius detective, with the hat and the pipe. That's why he's unique. When Holmes wakes up in the morning, he's already Sherlock Holmes. His alter ego is Sherlock, when he's in his dressing gown, playing the violin; that's his costume, to hide in plain sight. Sherlock is the alter ego of the genius Holmes, the way he sees society. And which are his characteristics? He's frail, irritable, doesn't believe in himself, and he's addicted to drugs. Sherlock represents the critic of Holmes to the human race, just like you and Mary Morstan."
"After Reichenbach you've buried Moriarty under the grave of a woman named Mary Morstan. You took her identity and escaped from Moriarty's gang, they knew you weren't dead, but for the rest of the world you were somebody else: Mary. You didn't kill Adair for the money, you were afraid he could reveal your identity. You got closer to John, creating a new identity just to get to me. Why."
John reads his words, check the post before publishing it. Then reads a draft written before, ready to delete it:
He stares at it, touching the books with his soft fingers and taking one: The Little Prince. He opens the first page: there’s a note, Sherlock reads the poem written in it.
Years passed with Sherlock still under the spell of his mistress, though he eventually learned that to keep Mycroft from swooping in on him like a protective mother hen, he did have to eat at least once daily and emerge once every 12 days from his stupor to at least insult Mycroft’s weight just to keep the meddling bastard from sending his minions slinking after him. After Sherlock’s sixth and final overdose, he finally consented to attend rehab though it was a very secure one located on the Southern Coast.
The next time Sherlock cast a spell, hoping for the clean resolution of a particularly gruesome case, candles dripping wax onto the sitting room floor and mixing with salt, John came up behind him, ruffled his hair and sat down across from him. This soft love was what he had been searching for in the books of the library and the streets of London all his life and now without hesitation or doubt, it was his.
Sherlock groaned, low and loud, as John ran his hands up his thighs to the waistband of Sherlock’s pants. He tried to articulate what he had planned, the meticulous diagrams that lay on his bedside table, but all that came out when he spoke was,
“Obviously I’ve known since I was a child so called cryptids were a real phenomenon, Nessie, bigfoot, and others, though the animalistic ones do tend to be centered in America. People saying that all of those pictures and sightings were simply drugs and photoshop when records stretch back hundreds, sometimes thousands of years? The universe is rarely so lazy. You’re likely a relative of Nessie’s, with your well-hidden northern accent and taste for abominable sweaters. What is your popular name I wonder? How did you become a doctor? How did you hide your nature in the army, especially after getting shot?” Sherlock stumbled as his mind supplied the terror John must have felt as when he awoke, in horrible pain and afraid that he had been discovered.
When he came back online it was to vague memories of John’s release mingling with his slick in the seconds after he came. Focusing outside the memories that he would file and store later in his mind palace, he could feel John wiping the remains of their orgasms off of Sherlock’s stomach with what felt like John’s own button up. After completely this John laid himself down next to Sherlock and appeared to settle in for a long night being the big spoon for Sherlock.
Suddenly, and for the first time in Sherlock’s life, he was not on his own. Instead of a sigh or scoff when he arrived at crime scenes, there were good natured jabs thrown towards both him and his doctor (and that’s what John was,
Victor is sitting in front of the desk, his scarf on his hands, nervously joking with it. “...so....I can’t even try to....get in for the next four months?"
‘I was at the karaoke pub! I thought something terrible happened! This man said his name was Alarm something, I can’t remember, my mind is making bad jokes lately…but I don’t know who’s this man’
‘I’m not apologizing...I’m just…realizing now that maybe he did take something. I wouldn’t have considered it before, but now…’ he trailed off, looking forlornly over at Sherlock. ‘It was hard to understand him even when we lived together. And it’s even harder now that we live apart from one another.’
Sherlock stands still in the living room for a while. Then he goes toward the stereo near the TV shelf, and looks through a stack of cd’s and selects one;
He steps forward, closer to Sherlock, their noses almost touching, he gives Sherlock a small kiss on the lips, and looking at him in the eyes whispers ‘Goodnight’.
The trio walks through the halls of Scotland Yard, and everyone’s trying to catch a peek at them, as they enter Lestrade’s office.
Mycroft “It was their plane to kill Sherlock. They would have split money....” Mycroft touches his stomach, grimacing with pain. Greg and John look at him, worried, then fakes a smile, looking at each other uncomfortably “....a lot of money,..they’re still in the caveau drawn in the map. But then the plan was destroyed, Moriarty killed himself, and Moran decided to kill one of the gang and burn him to fake her death. That's why she was “dead” for Scotland Yard, she changed face and identity, and came back to London to kill him, because Adair knew who she was and what she was planning. She wanted to close the case with Adair's death, and take all the money. Until Sherlock came back...with you” looking at John “He came back investigating. And she’s coming after him, ready to kill him"
‘What of it? Everything is fine. You forgave me, I’m back and you’re back with me. You’re going on your wedding-holiday-thing. What’s the problem?’ Furiously, Sherlock exclaims, ‘There should be no problem!’
He looks at him, already high and excited ‘Ohhh, what a lucky day’ he whispers singing and giggling, glancing at Sherlock’s lips, slowly lying down on him ‘What do you want me to do’
Sherlock stands up suddenly, and both Greg and John scurry back outside, away from the exit door. Then the pair of them slide back toward the window, and peer through it.
The journalist turns to face Amanda Abbington "And what about Mary?, it's confirmed she'll be here tonight."
John glances at Sherlock’s phone, grasping it’s from Victor. He takes a long breath, then turns to him ‘Listen, Sherlock...we need to talk about last night.’
‘No, I can’t, I can’t take time to my work doing these things, it’s not useful, how can you not understand, it’s so simple’
Mycroft looks at him ‘He wanted to have a look around, anyway, you know….check everything was okay,…….’
"The fans and the press are outside, they want to see the real superhero tonight." John smiles, ironically. Sherlock pretends not to look at him, hiding his smile, reading the newspaper. John continues: "They tried to get in and interview Mrs. Hudson but she slammed the door."
Sherlock quickly goes inside the flat and takes his coat, John frowns, not understanding what's going on. "Where are you going?"
Sherlock greatly exhales, ‘Oh, Jesus.’ He puts his fingers over his eyes, blindly continuing, ‘Mycroft told me you could go on without me.’
“We did and it was a disaster! And we decided to not see each other anymore, and I want to start my life again now, ok?”
‘It’s beautiful….’ He comments, touched. Then looks at John, who nods, smiling. ‘I thought that the black one you have is already full, you don’t know where to write anymore, so…it’s useful to write about the cases, you know…informations’ Sherlock looks at him, smiling kindly ‘Thank you John.’
Brando looks out of the window, Sherlock notices him and closes the moleskine, going next to him ‘What’s on, Brando’, caressing his head. Sherlock looks out the window and sees people strolling with their dogs on the street. ‘Ahhh, you seem interested, don’t you?’ A half-aged woman with long red hair and big eyeglasses walks with an Afghan Hound ‘Mmmm,..not really your type’ Sherlock comments, leaning on the window sill next to the dog.
more than Seb’s betrayal and Sherlock’s own ban from casework in Edinburgh. After his grand proclamations of life beyond this forgotten windswept pebble, Sherlock was now on the River Styx, floating towards damnation brought at the hands of 90-year-old amateur hedgehog eradicators and the Hegg Book Club.
Over the next few weeks Sherlock became engrossed in the lore section, plopping himself down in the midst of it every day at 9 when the library opened for the day, pilling books around him until only the very top of his curls were visible, until 20 minutes to 4 when Sherlock frantically but methodically replaced each book in its proper home and then rushed to the mathematics section where he read until Mycroft picked him up after school each day. In those too short hours Sherlock entered new worlds of magic and mysticism that he had never known existed. He soon finished the specifically mythological section and found himself looking through indexes and even asking the librarian for her advice on occasion. Sherlock found himself reading Homer, Rumi, and Ovid for background on the myths that so captivated him.
Eyes blown wide, lips cherry red from attention, the shirt that had rested on his shoulders long gone, and a bulge trying valiantly to break free of its confines, Sherlock made the most beautiful picture John had ever seen.
If acquaintances make it through Sherlock’s first tirade, they assume him cold and calculating, they assume him to be wholly scientific and utterly focused on the pleasure he derives from unearthing their darkest secrets and baring them for the world to see. People assume, but people often assume wrong. If they would stop for even a moment, Sherlock often thinks, people would notice that beneath his bespoke shirts and just on top of his heart lays a pendant made from Apache Tear and Aventurine. Perhaps it was unfair of Sherlock to classify people as idiots simply for not recognizing his twin stones when they slipped from under his shirt; perhaps it was an unfair hope that as unlikely as it was for someone to recognize the type of stone he wore, someone would take notice of the fact that though these stones offered luck to the user, they offered no protection.
Taking a moment to steady himself, Sherlock decided that a tumbler of scotch would if not calm his nerves, then give him the fabled liquid courage that he so desperately needed. With that decision made he moved slowly into the kitchen to retrieve their one good bottle, above the refrigerator pushed behind a dusty pinot that Sherlock had once preferred and a more regularly used Merlot that John broke out every now and then to ease his annoyance at Sherlock’s antics. Carefully he reached to the back, maneuvering so he wouldn’t knock into either bottle of wine or give John any reason to descend from his room.
“Of course, you will need someone to butter the doors and help wedge you into the chapel. How could I refuse.” Hateful. It was all hateful.
Sherlock remembers almost everything that has ever happened to him, births and deaths and drugs and loss, but what Sherlock remembers best and most fondly is his first experiences with Wicca. He was five years old and already three hours into exploring new and uncharted sections of the local library. He’d already read through the mostly horrific and mindless children’s section, and though he did have a soft spot for
Lavender: Uses include love, protection, healing, sleep, purification, and peace. Promotes healing from depression.
“Oh Sherlock, you gorgeous man,” John breathed without truly realizing it, “You sexy, brilliant man, how can I ever show you what you do to me.”
“We’ve often discussed your lack of comfort with the general populous, and while it is less pronounced than mine it still makes sense, can’t be found out and given over to a government who would surely torture you if you don’t let anyone get close.”
After that, there were even fewer lectures and no disturbing experiments because Sherlock was rarely in his dorm. Instead of spit out life stories Sherlock found himself waking up in the damp cellars of abandoned factories, tourniquet still tight around his arm. Sherlock found that he didn’t need his massive brain or his spells, in fact he didn’t need much of anything except the singing of cocaine through his overtaxed and underfed body.
“Just thought I’d pop ‘round for a ginger nut, do we still keep them on the top shelf? Of course we do, couldn’t have us changing the very basis of our household, London might fall,” Oh
Wiping out the inside of a faceted glass and quickly pouring a healthy portion of the amber liquid, he swirled the scotch around and hastily swallowed. Unashamed of his naiveté to drinking, he successfully managed to keep about half of it out of his lungs, choking up the burning liquor as he coughed intensely.
, Sherlock was rambling like the idiot he spent his childhood trying to prove he wasn’t, “How’s the diet going? Or what about the issue in Yemen, I assume you’ve played a large role in that, haven’t you?”
Sherlock knew that his time for cowardice had run out, he could not pretend that his love for John was his secret. He couldn’t pretend that his aloof and distant act was fooling anyone, if it ever truly had. Sherlock believed with very little doubt that John would not ridicule him even if his sentiment was unrequited.
Both John and Sherlock knew that tomorrow would bring discussions and emotions and huge changes to life as they knew it, but despite that, despite John’s scales and Sherlock’s toes in the crisper, they would make it work, just as they always had before.
day.” Fat insufferable ass. There was only one unmarried couple on the island and it consisted of his former paramore, Victor, and long time antagonist, Philip.
He slowly pulled the pants down, revealing Sherlock’s perfect cock, small, slender, and beautifully pink, nestled in a nest of unruly dark hair. John couldn’t help himself then and bent down to slowly lick at the tip of Sherlock’s cock, swirling his tongue around slowly and cleaning it of the precome that had been collecting there during the excitement. After a few moments, when Sherlock’s moans had begun to turn from low gasps to high whimpers, John raised his head from Sherlock’s cock and pulled off his own pants as quickly as possible.
Obviously, the optimal time for his seduction, clumsy as it would be, would be before John finished, despite his health and fitness, John was not a young man anymore. One go a night was probably as much as could be hoped for, at least this first time.
When he finally did, John was smiling down at him as bright and warmly as the sun and Sherlock couldn’t help but return that love and warmth he saw in John’s eyes. His face craned up for a kiss and he saw a crumpled paper bag from the pharmacy held in John’s hand.
With no more than an instants hesitation, John flung himself against Sherlock, finally wrapping his arms around the strong chest that he had fantasized so thoroughly about. He could feel his detective shaking, just slightly but enough, and pulled Sherlock tighter against him, tucking his head underneath his chin. Without conscious thought John began to sway back and forth slowly, bringing Sherlock along with him.
In his mind, he vehemently cursed James Sholto and his upcoming marriage for feeding the vapid masses who wanted so badly to peer into other people’s lives and clogging up his bloody wheels.
In short, even without the humiliation of his recent break-up, the angry sea looked more and more appealing to Sherlock, the closer they drew to the island.
This annoyance on John’s part led to Sherlock, sitting criss-cross on their, less than spotless, bedroom floor, frantically searching for healing spells that were specific to the hands. It seemed silly to him that he had deleted any healing spell, given his line of work, but his mind palace was utterly devoid of helpful information and thus the increasingly annoyed search history his phone showed him.
John’s voice was calm and cold, and it reminded Sherlock vaguely of tin cans being shot by a BB gun. It held the hint of command that Sherlock was never able to fully rebuff and he found himself turning away to give this monster-man the privacy he desired. The sounds that came from where not-John was sitting shook Sherlock to his core, squelches and wet noises of the mask being replaced over the scaly face of his best friend filled him with disgust.
Before this recent upheaval, it had seemed like they were moving, inching at times but glacially trudging towards something greater than they’d ever had before. John’s heated glances had turned into a fire, heating up the space between them. Touches lasted longer than strictly platonic and though he’d always assumed John would be as warm to the touch as his smile was, there’s always been something. Sherlock had found recently that John felt like an ice box most of the time. They’d always complimented each other so well, tall to short, kind to cruel that it only fit that they fit together in body temperature. Contrary to popular opinion, Sherlock was not ice, was not stone and was not cool even with his coat and cheek bones. In fact, he had been told and proved that physically at least he ran hotter than the average person.
“Sherlock, Sherlock please just shut up and let me explain,” despite the harshness of his words, John’s tone was soft, the same one he used when dealing with fragile witnesses and debilitated patients. Once John reached Sherlock’s corner of the room, he gently placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, the bitter cold of John’s body causing a shiver to run down his bare spine, “Can we maybe sit? You look like you’re about to faint is all.”
Six months after the earthshattering event that was meeting John Watson, Sherlock had no trouble admitting to himself that he was irrevocably in love with
As he trudged across the old stone of the pier, his nearly antique, barely wheeled suitcase snagged on a discarded and waterlogged copy of a tabloid and he was forced to kneel on the muddy ground to tear the soaked pages from his wheels.
John knew that it was now or never, he would never have this courage or this beautiful man standing in front of him putting his heart on the line again. With his heart somehow simultaneously in his throat and threatening to beat out of his chest, John reached forward and gently took Sherlock’s hand. John gave him a few moments to flinch or withdraw from this, but seeing no more horror or disgust in Sherlock’s eyes, he slowly brought their joined hands up and placed them over his heart, holding them so that his racing heart was undeniable to Sherlock, even in a state of shock. A small part of John, the one that was truly an Englishman, hoped that this could be enough. That he wouldn’t have to say the words and explain just how deeply he loved Sherlock. But the larger part of him knew that with the lies he had just been exonerated from, now was not the time for anything but absolute honesty.
With the legs of a new born fawn, Sherlock began the shaky trek up John’s stairs, 12 of them, each of them more daunting than the last. When he finally made it to the landing, to John’s locked door, he paused to get his thoughts in order.
“Once you’ve had your ginger nut, would you mind accompanying me to a wedding? It might give you ideas for your own
John had been injured in the latest case, nothing too serious, just burns on the palms of both hands from grabbing evidence from a suspect started fire, but long to heal and annoying to live with. He had been grumpy and tetchy all week, hating his inability to type up the case notes or open a beer without sharp stabs of pain.
As it stood John was sitting, hands braced on knees with knuckles white from the stress he was putting on them, wearing Sherlock’s favorite of his jumpers, the black and white striped one. He was breathing like he’d just run a marathon and couldn’t seem to meet Sherlock’s eyes, not that Sherlock blamed him.
Slowly John began to turn, more hesitantly than Sherlock has ever seen, and what Sherlock saw ripped a loud gasp from his throat. This thing that turned towards him wasn’t John but it was. It has green scales and a long snout that didn’t even begin to hide sharp teeth from sticking out the sides. Its, his, eyes were dull and grey with a fog covering them, not unlike the snake Sherlock had kept as a pet during his teenage years. Behind that fog, those dark, dull eyes was something of the John Sherlock knew and loved.
“When I woke up after being shot, all there was, was fear and pain for me. I was convinced I had been found out and this was the torture I’d be subjected to the rest of my life. Living with humans has always been hard, wanting to be close but not too close. Not much point in living in a culture but keeping it at an arm and a half’s length but I’ve never seriously considered going back.” John’s nervousness was blatant. It amazed Sherlock that this man who was such a terrible and translucent liar had pulled the wool over his eyes about something so very basic. “There is so much more to life as a human than there ever has been as a great big lizard.”
Something’s wrong with John, he’d been distant and snappish at times. The snappishness wasn’t new, not by a long shot; that has always been his way and Sherlock accepted that. But when classic John Watson snappishness and ill humor was mixed with a cold distance that Sherlock had let his guard down against when he let his blogger into his home and life, Sherlock began to worry.
When they reached the shelter of the church, he was again bombarded, though this time not by the rain, instead by a gaggle of 90 year old women acting as ushers.
He could pretend that Sebastian had had an urgent case that needed attending to in Edinburgh, but the lie would buy him only precious few moments until Mycroft’s face slipped into its most heinous expression. One of pity for his younger, newly cheated on and dumped brother.
For the first time during John’s explanation Sherlock looked up and settled his gaze at a point just below John’s collarbone, not yet strong enough to look into those soulless eyes.
First came the thistle, pots and pots of it around his door and windows, to remind him to stay strong. Then coltsfoot and ivy on his tables, counters and even the few chairs that Mycroft had somehow snuck in before Sherlock moved in. Finally, he filled his bedroom with daisies, lavender, marjoram, marigolds, and more to fill his infrequent dreams with hope, strength and to remind him of the simplicity of the days he spent on the creekside during his youth.
“Good, I don’t want to meet him. He sounds like a twat,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed at himself for breaking his silence, “Anyway, I’m like kryptonite to men. Kryptonite wrapped in dynomite.”
Even after he moved from Montague Street to Baker Street, on the behest of Mrs. Hudson who feared retaliation from drug lords who had either hated or loved her deceased husband, Sherlock maintained and expanded his collection of greenery, secretly hoping to one day have a garden that rivaled Ms. Honey’s in beauty.
Even as he slumped down further into the rough wood of his seat, an elderly woman and a young boy who appeared to be her grandson leaned over towards him and whispered, “There’s always the Hirtan tinker. He’ll be visiting soon, come September.
“You know that I’ve never been good with emotions, and I’ve always been absolute crap at expressing them,” John paused to duck his head, suddenly terrified of the wrecking ball he was crashing through their life together, “But you must know that I love you. God Sherlock, I would do anything to stay by your side, of course I love you.”
When he emerged ten months to the day after entering, Sherlock was an unemployed 27-year-old with vague but visible track marks and an abrasive personality. Thankfully his trust fund was to be unfrozen that afternoon, though it was to be monitored closely by one of Mycroft’s many goons and he was able to return to his third love, London, and find a cheap but manageable flat to rent.
He knew it was irrational and illogical, but that’s what John does to him, what John has always, always done to him.
