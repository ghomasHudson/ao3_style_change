"Take a picture it will last longer." Sherlock mused, not tearing his gaze from his work. John tensed up, a crimson blush plastered on his cheeks. When he jumped his hot tea nearly spilled all over his hand.
He would never let Sherlock be alone again. From this moment forward, they would cuddle every chance they got.
There had been many times that Sherlock had stared the darkness in the eye to catch people that would only do more harm to others if not caught and even though Sherlock may seem heartless and cold, John believed that his heart was bigger than any of theirs.
Sherlock didn't let John finish and retreated to his room. He actually
Sherlock glared at John and John found himself gulping at his friend's narrowed eyes.
hasn't come home and I was wondering if you were fortunate enough to come across him or hear from him."
Sherlock was nearly shaking, his hands flat on the table and his knees pressed together. John couldn't see his face but he wanted to. Sherlock looked as if he was ready to turn to jelly. Sherlock suddenly jumped up, pushing John's hands away and gasping loudly. John noticed Sherlock's face was red and his eyes were wide. Not in anger but in shock and John felt his heart tug.
"Donovan."
"He's skinny. I can carry him, don't worry."
"Just let the Freak do his own thing, John. He'll turn up again sooner or later, and probably with information about the killer as well." John wanted to reprimand Donovan for using such a word to describe Sherlock, though even though he's done it countless times before, it seems the offensive five-letter word had become tattooed in her brain as Sherlock's name. He didn't have the energy to argue with her right now and as much as he hated to admit it she was probably correct. Sherlock was a smart man and reasonably cunning, he would always find a way to get himself out of a sticky situation and save the day.
"To what?"
"You'll break your back trying."
Sherlock pressed his hands to his chest and embraced the warmth of the water. He almost didn't want to get out but he wasn't sure if it was because the water was warm or he would have to tell John about his fear. Sherlock shook his head and turned off the water, throwing a towel over his head and ruffling it. It hadn't dried completely, but he wasn't in the mood to dry it. Sherlock's long arms pulled a white T-shirt over his head and pulled his grey sweatpants on, having a little trouble because he was still damp. There were water droplets on his shirt from his soaked hair but he didn't care.
"I thought you went home," Lestrade said leaning back onto his desk.
"I'm fine."
"ok, now I feel more like laughing."
. Sherlock, you selfish, selfless bastard.
That time Sherlock let his mouth twitch up a little bit and John couldn't help but smile as well.
"Bloody hell, Lestrade, what are you standing there for? Turn the heat all the way up in the car." John growled, pulling Sherlock's icy form close to him and ran a hand through his hair. Donovan and Anderson could only stare jaw dropped as they witnessed Sherlock in the most vulnerable position they had ever seen him. Watching him shiver in John's arms was enough to make them feel terrible about how they treated him, however, the guilt didn't last long. Lestrade scrambled out of the ice locker and back to the car.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he felt John's own burning into the back of his skull.
"Sherlock! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you I just-"
Sherlock rolled his eyes and drew his knees closer to himself. "Oh don't make me laugh."
He sat himself down on his bed and sighed, picking up his phone and texting John that he was ready to talk.
Mycroft took a deep breath and looked out the window. The bright lights of London making it seem as though things were right, even though things were very very wrong.
"I've already seen what happens."
"Where the hell does he think he's going?" Anderson scoffed, his expression twisted in dissaprovement as he turned half towards Donovan who only shrugged. There was a great moment of hesitation, John wondered if he should go after his wreckless flatmate or stay here and continue helping the others with the investigation, however, Sherlock's expression clearly suggested that he had an idea, and Sherlock's ideas from John's personal experience were never safe.
Sherlock groaned and winced when he felt his fingers. At least he could feel his fingers. That was good. Right? He could feel something soft underneath him. From his deductions, it was obviously a blanket, and judging by the feel of it and its material it was an awfully cheap one, he was obviously in the hospital.
"I...I don't know," John's hands intertwined with each other, "Hypothermia is very tricky. He was in there for a little more than an hour and that's dangerous enough as it is but...we won't know the damage until we get him warmed up. We can only hope for the best."
"Was that your attempt at a pep talk? Because if so that was rather degrading."
"J...jn...." Sherlocks shivering lips failed to accumulate a single word. If John didn't get him to the hospital he would suffer permanent damage, if he hadn't already.
Sherlock shivered when he entered the building. It was late at night and even though it was summer the building was fairly conditioned and cold. Sherlock could see his breath in front of his face and he shoved his hands in his pockets in an attempt to keep his pale and slender fingers warm. Coming to this place was a bit of a hunch on Sherlock's part. Their current killer was tricky and unpredictable. There wasn't much sherlock could go on besides the fact that all of the victims had been kidnapped, froze to death, and were placed back in their apartments. Sherlock mentally hit himself for not being able to deduct such a murderer though the entire situation was vaguely interesting. When he examined the bodies he noticed that they had all been wearing their sleepwear, they had been taken when they were sleeping. He also noticed the barely visible pinprick in their necks that suggested that they had been drugged. Most likely to keep struggling to a minimum. None of the victims had shared any common features with each other. They were men and women however their ages stayed between seventeen and thirty. The killer didn't seem to really have a motive other than murder. Sherlock could only boggle his mind trying to figure out why all the victims had frozen to death. He spent a good thirty minutes staring at the blue face of a young woman contemplating the choice of murder.
John chuckled slightly when he imagined if he said that to Sherlock. He could see the offended expression on his flatmate's face before he said "Honestly John, The credit you give these psychopaths is highly astonishing. As far as I'm concerned, their intelligence isn't even a small fraction of what I'm capable of. The day a criminal outsmarts me is the day Mycroft admits he doesn't need a diet."
"John." He cried out, though it wasn't as loud as he had hoped. It was more of a pained whimper. His eyelids began to grow heavy and he fought with everything he had to stay awake. It was all in vain and the world spun and the ground suddenly became verticle and his head met the cold floor. The world suddenly became dark.
"Is that bad?" Mrs.Hudson asked her voice rising in pitch.
"John, there's no going on foot. The hospital is too far away to walk and no offense to Sherlock but the man isn't exactly tiny."
"One of you, get in. Sherlock is going to be in the middle."
John covered his eyes as the whirring blades created a large and powerful gust of wind as it landed on the side of the road. John wasted no time picking up Sherlock with much effort. The man was heavy though he was tall and lanky and looked rather awkward to John's short arms. Anderon tried to make it look as if he was lending a hand by setting his hand on Sherlock's shoulder or under his arm to support him. He did an awful job of making it look like he actually cared.
The steel hooks had stilled and Sherlock reached out and stilled one that was still swaying slightly. Lowering his gun and raising his eyebrow as he looked around. His mistake of lowering his guard did not go without consequence and Sherlock cried out when something sharp was plunged into his neck. Staggering forward, his hand reached his neck and ripped out a syringe. Oh god, he had been drugged. When he looked up to see who his attacker was, he was greeted by a strange grey blob, shaking his head didn't help and only made him dizzy. The syringe fell from his hand and fell to the ground with a metal clink and Sherlock steadied himself against one of the hanging meats on the ceiling. The coldness of the flesh made him wince and suddenly he couldn't feel his fingers. They fumbled for his gun but he groaned when the gun slipped from his fingers and fell to the ground.
"That he's normal. That when he'll wake up he'll make a snarky remark and complain that he's bored."
"Neither ever appealed to me. They were rather useless."
cold, never mind felt cold. Sherlock was as icy as they came and yet he froze so easily. Donovan thought he was cold and cruel, however, you can't freeze somebody who's already frozen. Turns out his heart was warm enough to turn to ice anyway.
"So you haven't been touched...at all."
John walked around in the kitchen, pushing around jars of eyeballs and fingers to reach the tea bags. The only sounds were Sherlock grunting and the water boiling in the background. Everything was peaceful and content, if only Sherlock would stop sulking. John turned around, eying the back of his friend's head. His black and curly hair only moving when he checked his phone or pressed his face closer into the microscope. John wondered what Sherlock used for his hair, it always looked so soft and silky. He rarely saw Sherlock's hair when it was wet. Sherlock normally dried it with a blow-drier or kept a towel on his head like women normally do. John wasn't bothered by it, he was almost jealous of Sherlock's beautiful hair. He wondered how lucky Sherlock got with the Holmes genetics, Mycroft...wasn't so lucky.
Sherlock felt a few tears fall from his eyes and suddenly he couldn't care less if John could see or not. He just wanted to be able to look at John and apologize for making him worry. Sherlock almost gasped when his eyes finally cracked open and he was assaulted with a bright light. He winced and shut his eyes again, turning his head away from the annoying light.
"I have a location." Lestrade turned the computer so John could see.
like the total arse he was. He knew how Sherlock felt about hospitals. Sherlock tried to open his eyes again. He began to hear a faint and rather annoying sound. Beeping? Must be the hospital monitor. Sherlock began to get frustrated with his eyelids. Why wouldn't they open on command? He was awfully tired and wanted to sleep, but he needed to tell John about the killer! He could be out there murdering somebody else! Blast this stupid hospital!
in your opinion?"
"Because unlike you, Donovan has proved to be somewhat useful in this situation. Now we have to go!" John quickly tightened his grip on Sherlock's broad shoulders. Sherlock's head slumping into John's shoulder as he recklessly bounded towards the Helicopter. John noticed Mycroft standing in the doorway of the helicopter, the tails of his suit flapping in the wind of the helicopter. A worried look plastered on his normally smug face as he leaned down to tug at Sherlock's jacket, pulling him into the helicopter as two other paramedics grabbed ahold of Sherlock and pulled him onto a gurney. Mycroft held his hand out and John gratefully took it before helping Donovan up as well.
"Lestrade, look." John pointed down and Lestrade's eyes caught the gun abandoned on the floor. This was no accident. Sherlock wouldn't have left his gun like this. With nervous hands, John pulled his gun out and Lestrade, Donovan, and Anderson did the same. Anderson and Donovan taking the situation a bit more seriously.
"God damn it, John. I'm sorry."
"Perhaps he's a vampire and is substituting human blood for pig blood." Donovan grinned, not looking up from her paperwork.
"You did?" Sherlock nodded.
"We can keep him warm until the traffic passes, until then, nobody is moving." Lestrade unbuckled his seatbelt and turned in his seat to look at Sherlock. He was paler than he had ever been, and Sherlock was quite a pasty man. His skin was almost glowing with luminescence and Lestrade was sure that it wasn't healthy. John was quite angry with Lestrade's demand. There was no way in hell that he was just going to stay here for some bloody traffic. There had to be some other way to get them out of there...
"No, I think I've got it just right. What if you died? Did you think about how Mrs. Hudson? How she would be affected? Or Mycroft or even Me? Dying doesn't just mean the end of your life, Sherlock! Some people need other people to live! I need you to live!"
John knew it, he knew that was why Sherlock ran off and it almost made him want to cry.
"I suppose I should be grateful it was a freezer and not a bullet to the head."
"Sherlock?"
Sherlock must find a way to keep warm until he can be rescued. He doesn't have a lot of options.
"Alright. There's no rush. I'll wait for you."
She was quick to remove her coat along with Anderson's and tossed them to John who quickly wrapped them around Sherlock's lanky body.
Sherlock moaned as he felt his body sting and his arms and legs ache with a dull pain. As if somebody had dunked him in dry ice and his limbs were slowly freezing so much that it burned him. It was so dark, why was it so dark? Sherlock tried hard to open his eyes but such an effort proved to be futile. The first thing he thought of was John. He had found him right? He began to wonder if he was dead, and that John finding him had only been a dream. What a cruel dream that would have been.
"You know you can tell me anything," John said quietly. Sherlock felt his stomach warm at this. Of course, he thought of John as his friend. They had been through so much together and he loved him dearly. However, he couldn't take the feeling of being judged. Especially not by his best mate.
"I'm sorry."
"Oh, hello dear." Mrs.Hudson smiled dragging out the "dear" as she lifted a tray of tea and placed it on the table in the kitchen. "I put the kettle on a little while ago, I know Sherlock doesn't like the green tea so I made a bit of black tea for him."
"Alright, what would you have me do."
"Anderson, stay here."
Donovan has been silent the whole lift-off. Watching John and Mycroft discuss Sherlock's condition and shoving herself into the wall of the vehicle to stay as far away from the two working paramedics as possible. She felt awful and she didn't know why. She had been a total arse to her colleague ever since she met him. In her defense, Sherlock was an obnoxious git sometimes, but she knew he couldn't help it. She called him a freak because to her, he seemed emotionless with little regard to anybody's feelings but his own. He had no vulnerability and only knew how to bring others down for his own selfish benefit. She still thought he was an arse, but now she realized that he was vulnerable, and had people that cared about him.
"Can we get around them?" John asked hopefully, looking around at the tight traffic.
He knew that he was lonely and nobody had ever touched his head like that. Not even Mycroft. He was embarrassed that John had seen him so vulnerable. He wasn't a house cat! He didn't need to be pet him to make him feel better.
John's hand finally landed on top of Sherlock's head and he felt his flatmate's shoulder tense up at the contact. John waited a moment before ruffling his hair, dragging his nails lightly over Sherlock's sensitive scalp and was thoroughly surprised when Sherlock shuddered, letting out a small whimper.
John carefully grabbed a fleece blanket that was next to him and wrapped them both in it to keep warm. The AC was on and it was getting a little chilly in Sherlock's room. Sherlock always liked his room to be cold, though John never understood why. When Sherlock felt the warmth of the blanket he lifted his arms to wrap around John's neck and nuzzle further into the crook if his neck, making John chuckle. John brought one hand up to play with Sherlock's soft hair and the other slid up and down his side. Feeling the curve of his waist and the raise of his hip.
"Aha!" Lestrade shouted out loud and slapped his hand down on the table making Donovan jump and send him a death glare.
John noticed how she couldn't dare to look him in the eye, only fiddle with her fingers as she looked out the helicopter window. John didn't want to pry.
John was beyond frantic though he kept his worried words to himself. He didn't want to alarm Sherlock though he even doubted the detective could even hear him or if his brain was thawed enough to function. As a Doctor, he was aware of the long-term effects of hypothermia.
Sherlock sat on his bed, facing the door. His eyes were wide and his body hunched over. His clammy hands clasped together and sweat beaded down his forehead. He felt terrible for reacting the way he did. He wasn't mad at John. He was simply shocked. Sherlock had known he had been touch starved for a while. He had no desire to seek physical contact with anybody. The very thought of purposely and unnecessarily touching another person made him cringe. He had never really touched another person. He had no girlfriends in his lifetime. Not that he wanted any he just saw no need for it. The closest contact he ever had was with Mycroft, years ago when he was a child and needed comforting. Ever since then his touches have been limited to subtle brushing of fingertips when he handed John his tea or Lestrade paperwork. Sitting too close to John in the cabbie made him feel queasy and tired so he was always sure to press himself up against the door as much as possible. It had been years since he had any contact and his body knew it. Every time Mycroft hugged him or Lestrade put a heavy hand on his shoulder or the back of his neck he would shake and his legs would turn to jelly. A warm feeling would gather in his stomach and he felt like he would pass out.
"Yes, John, haven't you been listening?" Sherlock said shaking his head rather annoyed.
"Would it be alright if I touched you," John asked rather quietly, a blush creeping upon his face?
John felt the urge to whip around and rip Anderson a new one but was more focused on finding Sherlock now. John noticed a large door fairly close to where the gun had been dropped and a small trickle of blood on the floor. Now he was really worried. Striding forward rather quickly, John grabbed ahold of the large metal door's handle and ripped it open. Aiming his gun inside and looking around.
"Did you find the freak?" Donovan asked, her eyes not leaving her paperwork.
It was as if its body had a mind of its own and his will was gone. Had he truly wanted to touch Sherlock's unruly hair that badly? How would Sherlock react? Would he turn around and snap at him? John was beginning to regret trying this, Sherlock was a harsh man and they never really shared many touches. They were friends, yes, but Sherlock had clearly shown his remorse for touches.
"John wait! Don't call a cabbie. We can take my car." Lestrade called out to John holding his keys up.
"Sherlock, wait!" John called out to Sherlock who had already begun to speed off into the night. Away from the crime scene, they were currently investigating. Sherlock being bloody Sherlock, he inclined to listen to John and run off on his own, leaving John, Donovan, Anderson, and Lestrade with their mouth open like fish out of the water as Sherlock suddenly became euphoric in his own discovery. Unfortunately, none of them had the power to mind-read, and the discovery went unknown to them. John only noticed Sherlock's eyes go wide and a smug grin spread across his pale features as he turned with a swish of his jacket and jogged off into the city. John cursed under his breath angrily. There had been far too many times Sherlock had gone off on his own, putting too much faith in his ego and absolutely none in the people that were supposed to protect him. Countless times Sherlock's life had almost come to an end and countless times he would brush it off like snowflakes on his shoulder.
Donovan looked up at the mention of her name. John sat on the helicopter bench, his hands resting on his knees and his blonde hair tousled and messy. He looked at her as he called her name.
"Whatever do you mean?"
The day had been rather uneventful. Lestrade hadn't called Sherlock is for a case much to the pale man's disdain and Sherlock was now sulking at the table. Eye pressed up against a microscope and slender and pale fingers gingerly turning the knob on the side to zoom in on whatever grotesque liquid he was looking at. Growling every few minutes and checking his phone to make sure Lestrade hadn't texted him giving him a case. Unfortunately for Sherlock, his inbox remained empty, just like his boredom.
It wasn't long before John gulped and set his tea on the counter and casually stepped forward with the utmost silence. Sherlock was far too into his experiment to notice and John's approach went noticed. Very slowly and carefully, John's hand reached forward towards Sherlock's soft hair. Sherlock was unsuspecting and John was rather surprised he was doing this.
"Can you get me a cigarette, bestie?"
Both men looked away from each other and stayed silent.
"What is it? Did you find him?" John asked, hopefulness clear in his voice.
John rolled his eyes, "Oh for the love of-" John leaned forward and put a hand on top of Sherlock's head, running his fingers through the damp black curls, and was utterly surprised when he heard Sherlock gasp and begin to shake. His body fell backward on the bed, only being propped up by a shaky elbow. Sherlock's eyes were half-lidded as John ran his nails along his scalp. The position was rather uncomfortable for John because he had to lean forward on his hands and knees to reach Sherlock's head so he stopped scratching only for a moment to quickly position him and Sherlock on the pillows of the bed so that Sherlock was next to John. Sherlock tried to escape, almost making it off the bed before John pulled him close so that he was squished into his side. Sherlock whimpered at the sudden movement and the feeling of John's warm chest on his own. John could feel Sherlock's panting breath on his neck and it almost made him shiver. Sherlock struggled weakly in John's arms as he holds him tightly, after a few moments the struggling ceased and Sherlock melted into John's embrace. His cheek against John's jumper and his eyes half-lidded, small noises spilled from his lips. With the occasional whimper and protests, even Sherlock knew that deep inside this is what he needed.
"I liked it."
"And...the worst?" Mycroft asked, his voice full of hesitation and fear.
"Why is she here?" Mycroft was well aware of Donovan's countless antics and bullying of Sherlock having been watching him all this time. Mycroft gave her a mean sideye. Unsure as to why John would allow such a foul creature in Sherlock's presence.
John grunted and shook his head, "He's probably fine. He's probably interrogating some poor sod at the Yard now."
"You're going to catch a cold, idiot." John threw the towel over Sherlock's head but didn't dry it for him. He feared Sherlock's reaction if he touched him again. To be honest, John was afraid to touch him. It was as if he was made of Porclean and would break if touched. Sherlock sighed and ruffled his hair with the towel, drying it a bit more before throwing it to the side. Sherlock looked nice with wet hair, it was even more curly and shiny when it was wet and made him look even more ethereal.
"Donovan, Anderson. Give me your jackets."
"J-John..." Sherlock whimpered, his voice high in pitch and broken. His eyes were slightly open and his icy irises darting around the car trying to access what was going on. His hair was wet and sticking to his forehead from the frost melted on his skin. "I...I thought.." Sherlock began but everyone in the car was beyond surprised when the tall man broke down sobbing. His fingers clenched into his own shirt and his body hitching with broken gasps, "I thought I was going to d-die."
"Sherlock," John said softly reaching over and brushing a piece of hair out of Sherlock's face, "Sherlock, I called your brother. He's on his way, you're gonna be alright." Sherlock merely responded with a weak grumble and pressed his arms close to his chest, his numb, thin, and pale fingers entwined with each other in an attempt to keep warm. He was shivering, which was a good sign since at least he was beginning to feel again. Donovan pressed her hand to his back with pity. She never imagined herself being this close to the freak or even touching him. In this situation, she didn't exactly mind.
Sherlock jumped as John leaned forward, placing his torso on Sherlock's and enveloping him in a warm and rather tight hug before Sherlock could finish his sentence. The touch felt so nice to Sherlock. John was so warm and Sherlock fought sleep as soon as John touched him.
Mycroft and Sherlock had their differences and John knew Sherlock may have despised his older brother in just the slightest. however, he knew Mycroft would swim across the ocean and still have the energy to snap the sneck of anyone who dared wrong his younger brother. With frantic hands, he hit the call button. There was a few seconds of ringing, and with John in such an impatient state, he was ready to hang up and call again. However, a click on the other line and a smug voice on the other end caught John's attention. Everyone in the car was watching John intently. Everyone, except Sherlock.
"I think there's quite a good chance your missing clue will turn up there," John said, nodding down toward the boardwalk.
"I never meant for you to be dragged into this so far," Sherlock says.
"No, it's exactly what they would expect. Which is why you will stay here with my mother and your daughter, and make sure that neither of them ends up being an additional opportunity."
"I just wanted to look outside," she tells him earnestly, then looks up at her father. "I didn't know I wasn't supposed to open the curtain."
"He's starving for love and attention," John says, following Sherlock to the car idling at the kerb. "He saw me cuddling Emily, and he just about fell apart. Broke my heart."
"The Poisoner's Handbook" by Deborah Blum is a non-fiction book in the true crime genre that investigates the beginnings of forensic toxicology in the early twentieth century. I thought it looked exactly like the kind of thing Sherlock would enjoy. "Poisons: From Hemlock to Botox to the Killer Bean of Calabar" by Peter Macinnes is a 'popular science' book about poisons.
about you," he says. He leans forward and lowers his voice. "I was especially interested in what he had to say about your skill with a..." He looks around as if someone might overhear him, then leans in even closer to speak directly into John's ear. "A gun," he finishes. He makes the word sound indecent, virtually caressing it on his tongue.
"Yes, that's right," Father agrees. "Her name was Godfreya Norton." He says it slowly, now peering at the mountains. He sounds a little unsure about it, as if it's something he almost forgot.
"It's not that; it's that he doesn't let most people appreciate him." She should know. She'd appreciated the hell out of him for years. But she knew it wasn't just that he was gay. It wasn't even just her.
Father has noodles with a creamy white meat sauce, and Doctor Watson orders a big white sausage with some unhappy looking cabbagey stuff on the side. He also gets a couple of thick slices of dark bread with it. He does the same thing as Tristram and picks up the whole sausage on his fork so he can take a bite off the end. Father watches him, both wary and cautiously fascinated.
All of a sudden, Irene is beside him, kneeling on the floor in her pretty yellow dress. "Tristram," she says, taking his good hand between hers. Her hands are cool and smooth and her skin is soft like the little squares of coloured silk Uncle Mycroft sometimes wears in the breast pocket of his suit jacket. "Everything is going to be fine," she says. Her dark brown eyes are clear and deep, and even though Tristram knows Father and John don't trust her, something tells him that this is the truth. "Your father's one of those people who always lands on his feet. Yes, of course he's coming back. But as you said, it may be a day or two. You can't stay here."
"I thought you had a job to be at," Father drawls. "Something about being fired if you didn't show up."
"Oh yes, Dr Watson!" Mrs Hudson cried, diverted - thankfully - onto a tangent. "How are the two of you getting on then? Thick as thieves, or so I hear. It looks like you've made yourself a friend."
John and Tristram kind of sat there and gawped at him. Emily grinned and plucked the book out of her father's limp hands and shuffled forward to hand it to Father.
"No, like this, it's good, very good... John..." Sherlock clutches at John's arms to pull him closer, making sounds in the back of his throat in response to John's ministrations. They both look down to watch John's hand on him and his on John.
"No, not at all," Anderson assured him. "I'm happy to leave that honour entirely to Mr Holmes." It was all too clear what he meant: that the play was going to be a disaster, and Sherlock would take all the blame.
"You have to try the magnets, they're really cool," Emily tells him. That's one of the things Mrs Daniels has in her room. Emily said she had lots of toys and games.
Doctor Watson seems both satisfied and disappointed by that. Maybe he wanted to talk to Tristram's father about Tristram coming over to their house after school. He'll have to ask Emily at break, because the bell is already ringing for them to go inside.
"Which one?" Father demands impatiently.
&&&&&&
An email arrived for Sherlock while they were driving back to London. John and Lestrade were in the front again, arguing eloquently and loudly on the merits of some classic rock band. Sherlock took one look at the sender of the email (sent to his work address: he'd looked up Sherlock's website) and put his phone back in his pocket, message unread. He could imagine what it was going to say, and he wasn't interested.
Sherlock would do, if he thought it would be useful. "I have tried to contact you several times," he points out. He settles back and stretches his legs out. He deliberately angles them away from John.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In batches, add a few handfuls gnocchi and cook until most have floated to top, 2 minutes. With a wire-mesh spider or a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi immediately to a sauce.
"Shame," he hears her say as he walks away. It's equally likely to be an expression of regret as an accusation.
"Hold on." John moves some papers aside and picks up a blue folder. He brings it over and sits down next to Sherlock.
"Will you..." Now Sherlock was the one unable to look John in the eye. "It would be useful if you accompanied me," he said stiffly.
John had come down from the stage as well and came to stand at Sherlock's side.
little troop, chanting a marching song and snapping his fingers at Jade and Bob, the perennial stragglers, in a playful yet firm manner. He didn't have any idea that this place held bad memories for Sherlock.
The language situation in Switzerland is exactly as Sherlock describes. There are four official language areas. When you cross from one to the next, all the signs on the roads and in the stores are suddenly in another language, even if they're just across the street. The German area is the largest, in the northeastern part of the country (Zurich, Lucerne, Basel), followed by the French area in the southwest (Geneva, Lausanne). The southern tip of the country - called Ticino - is Italian-speaking with the cities Lugano and Locarno, while the easternmost canton of Graubünden contains a small
Sherlock scoffs. "They didn't understand-"
"Thank you, Mrs Hudson," he said crisply, reaching out for them. He would never have thought to thank anyone else for doing something for him, but with Mrs Hudson he never considered not thanking her. It was all the more strange because she never really seemed to be bothered by his lack of social niceties; not that she didn't notice them or even take him to task for it, but she never took it as a personal affront, and was never anything but unfailingly generous to him. It was a puzzle, but somehow it engendered in Sherlock the impulse to indulge her with just those forms and rituals that she didn't seem to miss.
"Yes, of course. I apologise." I stepped back and ushered him inside. The cozy room felt suddenly close, his body looming too near mine. I closed the door behind him and retreated to the kitchen, where the kettle, which I had set to boil earlier, was clattering furiously on the grate.
There is no response. Doctor Watson yawns heavily, then blinks down at Emily. "I guess we're up."
Time: 14:28
"Oh, good, you're here!" Molly trilled. "There's some sort of mix-up with the wigs, can you just-" She somehow managed to insert a grease pencil into Sherlock's hand. "- finish putting beards on the Nazarenes while I sort it? Emma, where's your halo?" She took the little girl's hand without waiting for an answer.
Message: Rev still @ phone.
Message: Doing sth w phone. Dunno what.
Only John had to admit that for him, it would make a lot of things easier. He was wired to express love physically, it was that simple. It didn't have to be sexual, necessarily. He was just becoming more and more frustrated at having to hold back; not feeling free to hug Sherlock when he came home from work, or put his hand on his leg when they rode in a cab together, or to just kiss him on the top of his head when he passed by him in the kitchen.

"Everything's fine. She's fine. I'm fine. I just..."
I had one more objection, too. There was an erotic element to many of the demonstrations being put on around us. Contrary to what one might presume, my concern was not touching or being touched in an intimate manner by an alpha, or more to the point, by Holmes. At least not in broader theory. It would be akin, I imagined, to certain explorations on both living subjects and corpses which we were called upon to undertake as students at the medical college. Admittedly, as I would be the subject in this case, I was not anticipating with any large degree of enthusiasm being forced to do so under the eyes of dozens of strangers. But that was still not what had a lump of worry forming in my gut.
"Yeah, I'd be happy to help with that," John offered as he came to stand next to the table where Sherlock was working. Sherlock didn't need to see his face to know that his tongue had darted out to wet his lower lip at the end of that statement.
Sherlock brushed a hand down his front. "Yes, well. The silver. Your choice."
"Well, I-" Sherlock began. "Thank you. I mean... I'm going this way, if you-" They could at least walk together, if their paths took them in the same direction.
"Yes, of course. It's just you said, 'properly', and I thought..." Sherlock finds the bag stuffed down in a fold of the cover and pulls it out. The plastic crinkles sharply.
John glanced over his shoulder at the next hearth. Space was at a premium in the cave they'd adopted as their shelter for the season, and they were practically living on top of each other. Hudson's mate and her protegee, Molly, were already lying huddled under their piles of skins, their fire little more than a reddish glow. A baby was whimpering somewhere further back - probably Sally's latest - and a low, rhythmic grunting foretold the possibility of a new one sometime in the fullness of the hot season. Privacy was pretty much a foreign concept, but if Sherlock had really wanted it, John considered, they could have gone somewhere outside.
Father tips his head back and closes his eyes. His nostrils are flaring and his mouth is thin and hard. Tristram feels awful. All because he went out on his own without permission. And Father had told him to report back anything that was out of the ordinary. A strange man hunkered down in Grandmother's stable at dawn certainly counts, Tristram sees now. He knew it then, too, to be honest, but he was trying to do the right thing and be helpful.
Could she love me ?
Doctor Watson's right, of course. A curtain won't stop a bullet, just like laws don't stop criminals and a lock doesn't stop Father. And if someone really wanted to shoot him - or Doctor Watson, or any of them - there would certainly be easier ways to do it. Knowing all of that doesn't stop Tristram from wanting that curtain closed. He knows it's illogical, but it doesn't change how he feels.
"It would be if I had more time." Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut and presses his fingers against his temples.
"Thank you," Tristram hears him say. He supposes Father means to thank her for bringing Tristram back, which doesn't quite make sense to him: if she hadn't taken Tristram away in the first place, she wouldn't have needed to bring him back.
"Okay," Doctor Watson says again with a little nod and slides his hand away, leaving Father holding the backpack.
"Unless you're not interested," Greg added.
"Is it true?" John asks, guarded.
Doctor Watson leads Emily over to the bottom end of the couch bed. She sniffles and wipes her nose with her hand, but she's not actively crying anymore. "Did someone want to shoot me?" she asks, her voice trembling.
Tristram's supposed to be sleeping. He wants to. He's so tired, though, that he's past tired, and his brain won't slow down enough for him to drift off.
Tristram's mouth has gone dry, but he manages to dutifully parrot back: "Good luck." That was kind of a big speech. No one's ever told him he was incredible before, not even John, who's fairly generous with his praise. He's told Father's he's incredible - and amazing, and lots of other nice things - lots of times. And he did say that Tristram guessing right about the phone was amazing. But given Irene's track record with the truth, he's not sure what to make of it when she says it. Does she really think that? Based on what? All she's seen him do the past few days is eat and have panic attacks.
John had never climaxed this way. That wasn't the point, of course. Sherlock didn't really care one way or the other, and John wasn't doing this for his own physical gratification. Sherlock would have liked to say he didn't care why John was doing it, but that would have been a lie. Part of the pleasure was knowing that John was letting Sherlock fuck him even though he didn't like it; didn't get any physical enjoyment out of it, rather. His penis would be dangling limp between his thighs right now. He enjoyed it on some level, though. Must have. The way he looked at Sherlock afterwards... and before, and at other odd times for no particular reason. It wasn't a sacrifice, anyway. Sometimes Sherlock would lie next to him after he was done and let John thrust against his thigh until he came. Mostly, though, John was too sore afterward and didn't want to do anything other than hobble into the loo to clean up and gingerly apply some Anusol.
Sherlock watched Moriarty, still trying to figure out what his purpose was in being there. His expression was impassive, inscrutable; if anything, he was displaying signs of impatience, looking around from time to time and even checking his watch. As if he were expecting someone. Or something. But everyone was here - Sherlock, John, Lestrade... Moran, beside Moriarty, was calm, taking the occasional note and looking - dare Sherlock even think it - mildly entertained. But what else could it be? A direct interference would violate the first unspoken rule of the competition between them, namely that any success or failure was judged on the basis of their own efforts (or errors). Giving the opponent rope was allowed. Kicking the chair out from under him wasn't.
"Why are we here?"
An argument could be made, he supposed, that the running away began when he pushed the first needle full of seven-percent solution into his veins (carefully titrated to give him more control over the effects). Maybe he
"Is Doctor Watson your boyfriend?" he asks.
The police pulled them aside for interviews - separately - as soon as they stepped out of Lestrade's office. It was easy to convince the officer that it was a case of poor judgment rather than malicious intent, but when they finally let Sherlock go, John had already left. While it was obvious where he'd gone and with whom (pub, Stamford - clearly the 'space' he needed was away from Sherlock, not humanity in general) Sherlock opted not to shadow him. Instead, he went home, got Gladstone, and set off for a long walk and a think. His time would be utilised more efficiently coming up with a plan for what to do next than dwelling on the look on John's face when he'd left Lestrade's office.
"They can't, they're two boys," Ollie objected.
"The objective is the same as ever: exposing your wife's -"
"No," Sherlock agrees.
"Thank you, John," Tristram hears Father say behind him. He stays in the bedroom, though.
Sherlock was put out over the defeat. "You get to miss lunch to collect the Christmas tree for the school," he said as he jumped down off the stage.
John blinks and shakes his head. "No, just..." He puts a hand over his mouth, then scrubs it up over his face into his hair. He sucks on his lip and looks up at the ceiling as if he could find an appropriate response there. "Well, that's good, right?" he says finally, his briskness belying the underlying quaver in his voice. "I mean, that's what we wanted. He's - He was the one behind Mary's death. Not that it was about revenge," he says, pointing at Sherlock emphatically. "You put me in an untenable position."
. The story of the word 'meringue's origin is apocryphal, but often repeated.
After consideration, he decided that wasn't clear enough, and added:
"God, you poor kid," she says, sounding half pitying and half amused. She holds out her hand to him. "Come on, out you come."
The swooping sensation in his stomach surely indicated that it was time to turn toward home for dinner. Sherlock smiled.
On the other hand, everything is different now. Maybe, now, Sherlock's hand over John's would be acceptable. He lays the picture he's still holding back in the folder on John's lap. Then, as he pulls his hand back, he lets his fingers brush the back of John's hand and pauses there. John doesn't flinch away. Sherlock slowly lowers his hand until it covers John's completely. He hardly dares to breathe.
is more than the police are seeing." Sherlock was practically bouncing on the edge of the seat in excitement.
"It might happen," John said stoutly.
"Yes, later," Sherlock promised impatiently. "Now, John... the game is on!"
Sherlock doesn't respond.
Sherlock leaned over and spoke to her quickly, in a low voice. "Tell him you've run out of lens solution. There's a Lloyds two streets over that's open late."
Suddenly, all of John's quick texts to Sherlock between patients, on his way home, that awful week (not to be repeated) when Sherlock had had to go to Helsinki alone on an errand for Mycroft -- not just today, but every day, every time they were apart for more than a couple of hours -- became tainted and sour. Sherlock had looked forward to them, savoured them, probably read much more into them than ever intended or indeed appropriate. Those little check-ins like invisible I-miss-yous, reaffirming how closely their lives were intertwined, how closely they both
John let his leg relax so that it was resting against Sherlock's. "Not even for my godchild's christening?"
Tristram doesn't lie down again after that, but he does dare to lean back against Father's arm. Father doesn't say anything. Tristram's angled so he can see out the window, although there's nothing to look at except the station lights when they pass through. Emily stays where she is, with her nose practically glued to the window, eagerly monitoring the snow levels.
This was news to John. "We do?" he asked, his senses prickling as he looked up at Sherlock.
Harry's wife watches her, a brief glimmer of sadness showing in her eyes before she gets up too, ushering Tristram and Emily out of the dining room and down the hall.
"The passport is immaterial. I know you got a duplicate from Mycroft. The point," Sherlock reiterates, exploding the p, "is that she walked off with him. When you went back to the hotel, I assumed the children were safe in your charge. What was it you said? When you're part of a team, you trust that everyone's doing what they're supposed to? That was your part."
"No, Mum, it's right--"
Tristram isn't sure how he's supposed to answer. He has the impression that his father thinks it's a stupid idea, but Tristram would like it if he could get rid of all these bad feelings. He shrugs. If Father thinks it's a stupid idea, it probably is.
"Why, yes," he said with an incredulous laugh. "That's-"
He scoffed. "It's nothing to do with that. It's Holmes. I don't see how anyone could... With him."
"And now you're not." Sherlock raises his mobile to his face, scowling, and scrolls around.
So he'd read the same brief on trust and openness as Sherlock had. The fact that he was offering, despite his obvious discomfort, meant a great deal to Sherlock. It meant that John was willing to give something up for Sherlock, that he was seeking more than a physical connection. It was actually quite sobering and indicated a degree of commitment that Sherlock wasn't entirely certain he wanted. Of course he wanted to know everything. But that would entail a certain degree of reciprocation - in fact, that was probably John's primary motivation:
"Tristram..." Tristram knows that tone of voice. It means that Father is trying very hard to be patient. He almost never succeeds. "What - is - wrong?" His hands squeeze Tristram's shoulders, as if he's trying to squeeze the answer out of him.
"Morning," his father murmurs, his fingers tapping over the screen of his phone.
"Tris and Emily were friends first," John says fiercely. "Don't drag that into this."
"Come on, get these off," she said breathlessly, pushing her hands down between them to get at her own trousers.
"And what do you think?" she says, looking up at Doctor Watson.
"From the butcher, he owed me as I did him a favour, and it seemed like a good idea at the time." The actual reason was that he'd needed something to distract him from going over and over the confrontation with Moriarty the night before, and the subsequent argument with John. The word 'obsession' had occurred to him, which led to memories of psychiatrists, which led to amusement over an ink blot test, during the course of whose administration he'd convinced Dr Prentiss he was a sexually frigid pyromaniac with an irrational fear of heights, which led to wondering whether creating his own personal ink blots would lead to any insights on his current situation. And the blood had just been sitting there in the refrigerator, waiting to be used...
Sherlock grasps John's arms, pulling him closer, holding him in place so he can nudge John's lips open farther, nuzzle against his cheek, lean his forehead against John's and suck the breathless gasps out of his mouth.
She hopped inside and stood just inside the door, feeling awkward and very nervous. "He's gone," she blurted out.
The man across from them left after just a few minutes. John remarked quietly that he hoped they hadn't driven him away.
John and Mr Holmes both stood up when she came in, red-cheeked from the cold and patting down her staticky hair.
Waiting. -SH
"Two boys can get married," Jade said. "Didn't you see that video on YouTube where they all danced in the DIY shop?"
"Good." John nodded once, fighting not to smile too hard. "Good night then." He gave Sherlock's hand one final squeeze and let go.
"That's my job, Sherlock. I already called in pleading a family emergency the past three days."
"Of course." Mycroft leads the way into his office. "Both of them are snug as bugs. Which is more than one can say for the two of you. Have a seat." He goes to his desk and wakes his computer. "What happened?"
Sherlock's parents hadn't invited him because they felt sorry for their son's poor divorced flatmate and didn't want him to be alone on Christmas. In fact, John didn't recall there ever having been a formal invitation made. It had been more along the lines of "What time are you boys arriving and should we meet you at the station or are you hiring a car?" A single pronoun encompassing the two of them. A single cup of tea. A single bed.
Then he straightened up and everything was normal again. She smiled back and sat on the bed, very straight and prim, her legs crossed tightly, as he went to the door.
Tristram feels a burst of pride, because that's one of the things Doctor Watson said to his father when he was telling them about some of the cases he'd solved. Only he'd said it softer, and it sounded like it meant more than just the words. Now, he says it in a jolly way, and it means exactly that: Tristram has done something amazing. Tristram can't stop grinning. He can't wait until his father comes so he can tell him.
Tristram lifts his head to look toward the door. It's not far, he knows that. Normally it would only take a few steps to get there. But now, naked and cold, with his back and his hand hurting more than he thought anything could hurt, and his father gone off to who knows where, he's not actually sure he can do it. Still, he props himself up on his left elbow, crooks his right arm so that his injured hand is up out of the way against his neck, and pushes himself forward with his legs, which don't seem to have been hurt. Dirt and debris dig into his knees and elbow, but he somehow manages to drag himself forward. Doctor Watson hovers over him on all fours like a huge umbrella. Tristram is shivering now. It must be from the cold air coming in through the broken window. Tristram's back protests every time he moves, but the pain in his hand has lessened to a dull throbbing, as long as he doesn't let it touch anything.
Irene returns his stare, apparently weighing the offer. Finally, she acquiesces. "Fine. See if you can get four seats out of Zurich tomorrow. If nothing's available, try Geneva."
The man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. He's wearing dark, bulky clothes. In the shadowy gloom, Tristram can't make out much of their details, but he can see the thin white line of his cigarette balanced between the fingers of one hand. He makes a motion indicating that Tristram should sit down. Tristram stays where he is. The man takes a drag on his cigarette, then nods his head at something.
to stay. We've had some big pledges come in because of the interest from Whitehall. We can't shift responsibility to another staff member at this point. Look, I know you weren't exactly enthusiastic about this project from the beginning, but there's a lot more riding on it now. Blackwood School's music director showing up and whatever that was out there" - Lestrade thrust a hand toward the door - "is a case in point. I have the board and the press breathing down my neck. This project
"Sometimes. Not now," he tells her. She didn't really jostle it much.
"Why don't I just bow out completely then?" Sherlock said icily. "I've done my part with the music. Or at least I had before I let you scribble all over it."
"I was listening to that," John protests.
Sherlock left off and moved back, and when she had recovered enough to look down her body at him, he was sitting on his heels, fisting his penis, which was already hard, in a rapid tempo. His face - shiny and wet - was angled down to watch himself. He was breathing hard, his mouth hanging slightly open, and something had shifted. Whereas before, it had been something almost playful, a challenge, for both of them, now there was an urgency that went beyond the pressure from the time constraint.
Mrs Hudson has lots of pictures of people in her family too, all over her flat. Her parents and her brother and her sister, at various ages, and their spouses, and her nephew and his wife and kids. Mrs Hudson's nephew's children aren't too far off Tristram's age. There's a boy and a girl. Tristram's sometimes thought it might be interesting to meet them. But they've never visited, even though they only live in Blackpool. Mrs Hudson gets a Christmas card from them every year with a new picture - sometimes just the children, sometimes all four of them. She always puts the picture in a frame and finds a place for it on one of her already cluttered shelves or tables or mantel and tacks the card up on her kitchen wall. There's even a picture of Mr Hudson on one of the little side tables off in the corner of her living room. He's sitting outside somewhere with palm trees in the background, smoking a cigar and smiling. Mrs Hudson says he has a rakish grin in the picture. Tristram assumes that must mean something about the way his teeth are showing like the prongs of a rake.
Then he pretends he's Doctor Watson, and Emily pretends someone's trying to drag her into a car. She screams really loud, and Tristram actually gets scared because she sounds just like she did in the warehouse when he was tied up and she was trying to get to him.
He picked up his briefcase and set out for the school. For the first time he could recall, he was actually - if not exactly looking forward to the day, then at least not resigned to it being unutterably dreary. And if he was honest with himself, the highlight was going to be seeing John again. Sherlock wondered whether he'd be back to using the cane, what disruptive activity he would instigate today, and certainly the least important of all, what his reaction would be to Sherlock's composition.
"Do you think they're kissing?" Emily whispers, glancing up from where she's sitting on the floor drawing a blueprint of a flux capacitor.
Doctor Watson flips through the pages. At first Tristram thinks he's just checking to see how long the chapter is, but then he takes his arm off Tristram's shoulder and closes the book. "No," Doctor Watson says, "we're going to skip the next chapter. I'll tell you what happens, but I'm not going to read it."
Sherlock shook his head. "No," he said under his breath. "But don't be fooled. Whatever his reasons are, it's not as a favour to you or me." Mycroft only ever did something if it served himself.
Then there was the question of his own employment. It was less urgent than the issues involving John, but he would eventually have to find another source of income. And not in the educational field. He could probably get by for food and clothing for a little while by calling in favours, but he needed cash for the house and utilities. If only someone would pay him to squirt blood at walls, deduce people's secrets, and find the quickest route on foot from the power station to the war memorial. What a tender world that would be.
"Extraordinary," he said, barely more than a breath. "How does it feel?"
The next one comes much closer, close enough that Doctor Watson has to duck, but when he comes up again, it's to send a snowball at Tristram and Father with uncanny accuracy. It glances off Father's arm, splattering Tristram, and after that there's lots of ducking and dodging and shouting and breathless laughter, with Tristram handing snowballs up to Father as fast as he can and Emily and Doctor Watson both pelting them with everything they've got. Tristram's nose is running, his feet are freezing, his mitten has soaked through, his head is sweaty and itchy under his hat, and he somehow got snow in his ear, but he can't remember ever having so much fun. Tristram has no idea who's winning, but it doesn't matter one bit. Father is glorious, standing tall and fearless next to him, never giving an inch, batting at any snowballs that come too close.
He comes anyway.
"I saw him," Tristram confesses. "The man who was under my window. I saw him another time too, before tonight."
Emily frowns. "But my dad told me about them after we got back from your grandmother's house. When we were getting our things to go to your house. And they were sleeping on the couch together, and my dad even slept in your dad's room last night."
"Does he have any friends around here? Anyone he might have gone to?" John asks.
"Should probably have put condoms on," John mentions breathlessly, but doesn't let up.
"Sorry, what's going on?" John said, looking from Sherlock to Mrs Holmes and back. Had there been a discussion of plans that he'd missed?
"I'll have Billy bring a bowl of water for your dog while you decide. Oh, and a candle!" He stepped away for a moment and came back with a tea light in a small glass, which he set on the table. "More romantic," he said with a wink, before leaving to tend to the kitchen.
"Right, okay. I think I'm going to turn in," John said eventually when the silence became awkward with him still standing there.
"No one's trying to-" John started to say, angry and defensive, but Molly jumped up with a look teetering between dismay and conciliation.
---ooo---
Doctor Watson, meanwhile, has taken an instrument with a light on the end of it out of his case, which Tristram is intrigued to note has several interesting fold-out shelves and compartments, and is chock full of tools and ampules and vials and bottles. He has Tristram open his mouth and shines the light in there and up his nose.
"You didn't force me. I was happy to go. To be there for him."
Tristram shifts a bit, then sits up. The bandages catch on a couple of spots, but overall it actually does feel better. "Better," he confirms, trying to be as convincing as possible.
"Like you love me," Emily says happily and smiles at her father.
Tristram and Emily were kidnapped. Tristram supposes he probably has the thin and illogical plots of television series to thank for that, where people are kidnapped and blown up just because the bad guys are bad and the good guys need someone to save.
Tristram realises with a start that she's right. Not the latter point, which is entirely irrelevant, but the first part. He was so distracted by her eyes and everything they were trying to say to - or hide from - him that he didn't notice: she knew his name. A prickly shiver runs down Tristram's back and lodges in his stomach, and this time it is fear. Not so much that he loses track of everything else, but still uncomfortable enough that he wants to go back upstairs and find his father. He doesn't, though. Doctor Watson is here with them, not letting them out of his sight. He won't let anything happen.
Tristram thinks he can manage. He's been up to use the loo several times by himself already, so he says it's fine, scooting himself to the edge of the bed to demonstrate. He just has to mind the IV line and remember to take the pole with him. She smiles and tells him to use the call button if he needs anything, then leaves.
Lestrade was silent for a moment, looking John up and down and eying the phone in his hand. He had to admit that it was strange for Sherlock.
"But it's cold in here!" Donovan whined but immediately shut her mouth when John wheeled around and looked at her like Jack Nicholson chasing Shelley Duvall up the stairs in the shining and said "Give. me. your. fucking. coat."
As soon as John had realized what he had said he sat back in his chair, his face a crimson red and his fists closed on his lap. His eyes searching the floor for nothing in particular. Sherlock could only stare wide-eyed and with an equal blush on his pale cheeks.
"I let Sherlock go off on his own to hunt a killer. For the first time, he was outsmarted. The bastard locked him in one of those industrial freezers in a meat factory."
John practically leaped out of the car when they got there and immediately ran into the building. Ignoring Lestrades calls and barreling into the building like an angry bull. Where was Sherlock?
John looked up at Sherlock, shocked. Sherlock eyed the floor, blush on his face and his long slender fingers fiddling with his sweatpants strap.
John was taken aback by the unexpected apology. Why was Sherlock apologizing to him?
"What the hell has he gotten himself into this time," Anderson muttered under his breath.
Donovan decided to break past her wall of judgmental hatred in an attempt to comfort the man next to her. With hesitation, she lifted her hand up and placed it on his cheek. She almost gasped at how cold it was and was deeply surprised that Sherlock; the man who despised her, whimpered and leaned into the tender touch. His eyes twitching under his eyelids. She couldn't imagine how great a warm hand must have felt to him and she felt her heart break a little. When the car began moving, Sherlock winced and fell further into Donovan so that his cheek was pressed into her chest. Anderson stared at him and then at Donovan, and she shook her head in confirmation that she was alright. She wasn't like Sherlock. She wasn't a monster.
"I'm not mad at you," Sherlock said simply.
"It's alright, Lestrade you don't have to-"
"S-sorry." He sputtered out. He forgot Sherlock's abilities and underestimated the vigilance of his flatmate. Sherlock was normally a very stoic man. Cold and emotionless in most cases, even though he had seen Sherlock in some vulnerability, it was very rare and he normally became emotionless in the next second. John still eyed Sherlock, even though it was very clear that his flatmate had already caught him in the act. It's not as if he had an attraction to his friend. How could he? Sherlock was...Sherlock. Though even though John was entirely heterosexual, he would not deny that the consulting detective was a beautiful man. His ethereal look nearly made his skin glow in any lighting. He was slender and had a strange facial structure but it didn't make him any less handsome. His hair was silky and beautiful and his eyes were something out of this world. John often felt a little self-conscious standing next to Sherlock. He felt like a blonde golden retriever puppy standing next to a tall and beautiful, black great dane.
"I'm sorry, John. Don't fear I will find the killer I have a good idea where he's going next. I just need to-"
The ride to the factory was unnerving. John's leg was restless as it bounced nervously. His lips tugging at the wrinkly bit of skin in the middle of his index finger and his eyes searched out the window. The street lights danced and reflected off the car's windows as they sped by. Lestrade going a little faster than the speed limit. Donovan and Anderson looked utterly bored in the backseat and John wanted to just open the door and shove them out of the moving car. All they ever did was berate Sherlock. Calling him a freak and a weirdo. They never cared about the man no matter how many times he proves himself to them. Sherlock had issues, yes and he could be a little mean, but most of the time he rarely deserved such treatment. Now, they simply want to tag along for the entertainment. Not because they care about Sherlock. John gritted his teeth. He was almost positive neither of the detectives would mind seeing Sherlock laying face down in a pool of his own blood and it made his own blood boil.
He'd have to look over the list more carefully when he got home, see if he had contacts anywhere and take a closer look at their staffing policies, but it was a good start.
"Yeah," Doctor Watson says. He purses his lips when he says it, though. Tristram recognises the gesture from playing 'Not Likely' as one of the things Emily did when she was bluffing. Tristram smiles to himself. "He does care, you know," Doctor Watson says quietly, to Tristram.
I was at his side in a trice, prising the bottle from his fingers. "Have I not made it clear I hate the stuff? Holmes, all of this..." I set the perfume down and tried to calm my breaths. It defied all logic and sense that he still had not understood. I took his hand in both of mine, but he only let it lie limply in my grasp, as if he were not certain whether to withdraw. I continued, once I was sure of what I wanted to say: "This does not spring from some vulgar desire of a lonely relict and widower. I do not want an omega to quench my thirsts. It is you. Only you." His hand twitched in mine. I pressed it firmly, and he now returned the gesture, clenching my fingers as in a vise.
"Yes, we know, can't be corrupting the children," Sherlock said bitterly. He jumped down from the stage to stand level with Lestrade.
He'd just finished slicing up the last of the mushrooms when he heard John downstairs. Sherlock paused, the knife hovering in mid-air, to listen. Footsteps measured, not quick but not plodding. Probably just tired. No hesitation at the top, the door opened as soon as he reached the last step. Sherlock set himself into motion again, sweeping the mushrooms off the cutting board into the dressing to marinate.
Emily's finger hesitates just a moment too long before the next note.
Sherlock cried out again, weakly. "More..."
Tristram stands firm. He doesn't want to contradict her, but it's more important to do what Doctor Watson said. "I'm waiting here." He really hopes that Emily stays, too.
"Consulting detecive," Sherlock answers sharply. "It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me."
"I said my bed's bigger." Sherlock seemed preoccupied with his notes but there was a tension in his body, a flicker at the corner of his eye that told John he was actually paying very close attention to him.
Tristram stands up. Father picks Tristram's suitcase up and lays it cross-wise on top of his own, so that it is resting against the long extendable handle sticking up from the top. Then he opens his carry-on bag and rattles around in it until he comes up with a roll of duct tape. He deftly wraps the tape around Tristram's suitcase and the handle so that it is held in place. He gives the combination an experimental shake to test the stability, then pulls it forward with him as the queue moves. It wobbles a little, but nothing falls off.
Irene gives him a sidelong glance and withdraws her hand. "Well," she says, noticeably more subdued, "I'll consider you one, and I hope you'll consider me one as well." She drinks the last bit of her espresso. Her lipstick leaves a red mark on the rim of the white porcelain cup. Tristram wonders whether he should try to take the cup with him. If Irene's part of a case, it might be helpful to have a sample of her DNA. But then he remembers that Irene kissed Father on the cheek that morning, so if he needed a DNA sample he could have taken it then.
Out the window, a light flashed from the direction of the house.
Father smiles and puts his hand on Tristram's shoulder. He doesn't need to hold the brake anymore, so that's fine. "I'd like that," he says. Tristram would too. Very much.
"I'm not re-writing any of the songs," Sherlock told him pointedly. "You'll have to make do with what we have. It would be hopeless to try and teach the children a new song this late anyway."
Doctor Watson reaches around to open the door for them. "Good night, Sherlock," he says.

"No?"
He's only read about half a chapter when there is a knock at his door. "Tris?" It's Emily's father.
"What the hell- Sherlock!" John exploded. "After last night, do you really imagine I'd- Jesus Christ, this isn't..." John braced both arms on the table and leaned in, speaking forcefully. "These kids care about you. That's what I'm trying to show you, after our talk yesterday. They're doing this play for their mums and their dads and for you." He pushed himself back up, hard, and ran a hand through his hair. (Upset, wants to hit something.)
His hand was cupping the phone in his pocket when he felt the buzz of an incoming text against his fingertips.
"They have to kill me," John finishes the sentence, breathless with the impact of the implication. "Brilliant." John's eyes glitter at Sherlock in the semi-darkness. "Although I'm not sure any of those titles really fit me," he adds self-deprecatingly.
Doctor Watson and Emily come back with two white paper bags. Emily shows Tristram what's inside: sandwiches and some jam-filled biscuits shaped like smiley faces.
His father gives him a mildly curious look. "What do you need plutonium for?"
"Down to the bar." Sherlock hangs his jacket up in the closet, taking his time to get the line just so.
He made a negative sound. "Let me see." He came over and stood in front of her, his hands hovering as if feeling for emanations from her body, looking her over carefully.
"What a shame," Mrs Hudson tuts. "Well, you know what they say: great oaks from little acorns. It's still lovely that Tristram has someone to play with now." She turns and beams at the children. "You two feel free to come downstairs any time. We can play Snap. I have a feeling it will be much more fun with three than it is with two."
"I could get up and let you sleep a bit more," Sherlock offered. "Or make you some tea?"
When they get to the end, Tristram's face is burning. He can really play better than that. He's about to apologise for messing up when Emily exclaims, "Wow, you're really good!"
It would be nice, maybe, to do what they'd done last night. Crawl under the covers together. Talk in the dark. Have one more laugh. A brush of the foot, a squeeze of the hand. Once in a while. Or every time. John wasn't fussed.
"-Sherlock?"
Tristram considers with a guilty start, lying there in the dark next to Emily, that perhaps Father had wanted to be asked to read before tonight too. Maybe that's why he sat in the chair at the end of the bed and pretended to be busy with his phone: because he wanted to be included but didn't know whether he was welcome. Of course Tristram would never in a million years have thought to ask his father to read him a story at bedtime. Has this side of his father always been there, waiting for someone to discover it? Or is this him trying on a part, like he does when he pretends to be a streets and sanitation worker or a clergyman or a policeman? (Tristram knows Father could get in a lot of trouble for that last one and he's not to tell anyone.)
John came over and put a finger under her chin to tilt her head up for a kiss. "It's fine." He pulled back and caught her eye and held it, as if he were delivering a weighty pronouncement. "It's absolutely fine," he repeated softly, stroking her cheek and smiling. Sarah's heart fluttered and her stomach contracted, because it was as if he knew exactly what she'd been thinking. But he didn't, obviously. Obviously. She was just imagining things. Guilty conscience.
And most of all, thanks to
John snorted with real amusement. Then he shook his head. "God, this is horrible. The kids are going to be so disappointed."
Moriarty grimaced. "Dr Watson, please." He put his hands over the ears of the child closest to him and whispered, "Little pitchers."
"You don't need to worry about being wrong," Doctor Watson assures him. "It's just a game. Anything?"
"I should clean my teeth too," Sherlock said between soft little meetings and partings of their lips.
"The studio was looking for something light and heartwarming. I wasn't privy to their discussions. Mycroft approached me."
Rather than acting on it, he snapped, "If you are going to give instruction in classroom mischief, the least you can do is make sure to impart the first principles of aerodynamics." Sherlock snatched up a scrap of paper that bore a greater resemblance to a tri-cornered hat than anything capable of flight and tossed it on his desk in disgust. "And this? What's this?" He picked up a piece of paper that had been crumpled into a vaguely spherical shape. "You'd need a ballista for this type of projectile. Really, for someone who's supposed to have been in the army, I'm very disappointed."
(See the end of the chapter for
When the match started up again, Sherlock was induced to go back with them to watch the second half, which was somehow less tedious than the first half had been. Alfred (Dimmock, but Sherlock was feeling magnanimous by this point) shared his nachos with Sherlock, and Sanjay spilled beer on his shoe. Greg pounded him soundly on the back when their team scored, and John didn't seem to care one whit that everyone thought Sherlock was his boyfriend. 'Your man's got it going on upstairs, eh?' 'Hey, pass this to your fella.' 'So if he's the best man, does that make you the best man-in-law?' Raucous laughter. John took it all with equanimity and good humour. They were all drunk. John wouldn't want to make waves. This was Greg's night. None of it mattered.
The observatory is called the
"I don't need your pity!" Sherlock's face twists in displeasure.
"In six weeks."
Thank you to my fabulous beta readers, ruth0007 and dioscureantwins. If anything in this chapter still doesn't make sense, it's all my fault.
"And the man at the toboggans," Tristram adds. Although he didn't speak it very well. Still, it must count.
Sherlock leans marginally closer, his eyes darting over John's face, his hair, his mouth.
"Who's that?" Emily asks in a low voice as soon as the woman has looked away and they are out of earshot.
When they pull into the gravel field that serves as a car park, the wind has picked up, twisting ragged wisps down from the dark gray clouds and whipping Tristram's hair into his eyes as soon as he gets out of the car. The sea is laced with foam as it sloshes up against the rough, dark stones protecting the beach. Tristram can feel the wild energy of the abating storm, and he and Emily barely need to exchange delighted grins before tearing off pell mell onto the expanse of pebbles and shells.
"Yes," Doctor Watson agrees. "Because of that." The way he says it makes it sound as if he thinks Father's the one who's being an idiot at the moment.
"Nice to see you too. I'm on holiday, would you believe?"
"Wow, that's soon," John said. "Cutting it close on invitations. You don't think... is Molly?"
"Hi, smells good," John called from the other room.
John forced himself back to the present. He must be missing something, but... "Did something happen to the guest room?" he asked.
He's also pretty sure Sherlock's not the only one who feels that way.
Sherlock shakes his head. "It was my fault," he says quietly. "I should have realised it from the first message."
"This is scenario four, John," Sherlock says, as if speaking to a recalcitrant child. "She's not going to give up. Go now before it turns into three." He thrusts the phone at John and pushes the button again to un-mute it.
"If Mr Watson were here, we'd still be doing the play," T.J. said sullenly.
"Any in the sink? On the mirror? Anywhere else?"
"Mm, old friend," Sherlock said, fiddling with his music stand.
"You're the best, I really, really appreciate this."
! Better than he would be vegetating in that room for one minute longer, at any rate. You know how much he hates hospitals."
"And why?" John's feeling unpleasantly fuzzy all of a sudden, stupid and slow, and he's uncomfortably aware he's still got his hand wrapped around Sherlock's leg.
Sherlock smiled, couldn't help it. Everything in him was happy. His face, his stomach, his ears, his toes. "Good morning."
Now it's Father's turn with the triumphant look, accompanied by a quick riff on the violin.
Sherlock scoffed. "You'd have been able to handle a serial killer dressed as a clown on your own, I've no doubt."
Sherlock crowded in close again. "Let me take care of it for you," he said, stroking John through his trousers with intent now as he rubbed his face against the side of John's head.
"To get a leg over, not to play Black Ops," Aunt Harry snipes.
"And out..." Doctor Watson says as soon as Tristram starts to exhale. Everyone else breathes out too. They repeat it a few more times until Tristram can keep up. On the last one, Emily starts to giggle. Tristram glances over at her and can't help losing it a bit too.
"I should think so."
Not that Mycroft's assurances meant anything, of course, John wasn't as naive as to believe that, but Sherlock's did, at least those he made to John, and Mycroft knew that a misstep here would destroy once and for all any scrap of brotherly sentiment that existed between them. The shocks and betrayals of Sherrinford were too fresh and went too deep. Although Sherlock had forgiven him those, more or less; he understood something of being motivated by love to do terrible things -- likely more than Mycroft did, come to that.
One year, not too long before Christmas, Father damaged his violin bow somehow. Tristram never found out what exactly happened, but it was odd because Father's always so careful with both his violin and the bow. Anyway, Father was able to fix it enough that he could still use it to play, but he would get all snarly and cross after not very long, and even Tristram could tell it didn't sound quite right.
Doctor Watson's expression shifts immediately from relaxed holidaymaker to keen-eyed lookout. "Spotted. Yeah, it's a submachine gun, but he's airport security. There are a couple up there. Down here too, for that matter."
John harrumphed. Then burped. Frowned and looked down at his drink, turning the tumbler slowly around. It was more than half empty. Only a couple of millimetres left. How many was that? Three? Four? More? Enough was enough.
I must have cried out as well, or given some other indication of my instinct to rush forward and preserve the poor fellow, for I instantly felt a hand at my elbow, a body at my side, and a familiar voice in my ear.
"Oh." He is even more embarrassed now, having made a fuss over nothing. He should have known. It isn't the first time Uncle Mycroft has sent bodyguards after his father.
But Sherlock was one step ahead, even now. He took his finger out of John's arse and his mouth off of John's cock, but before John had gathered the presence of mind to protest, Sherlock had dropped a glob of spit onto his first two fingers and wriggled them into John's arse, whilst with his clean hand he grasped John's cock and steadied it back into his mouth, and John was honestly not able to come up with a single reason why that shouldn't be allowed. Sherlock's fingers quickly found their mark, then pumped smoothly in and out with every push of John's cock into his mouth. It didn't take very much longer at all before John emptied what felt like the entire contents of his brain down Sherlock's throat.
Yes, it actually did bother him, but he saw the sense in it. The songs were better now, at least for the purpose they were going to be used for.
Time: 14:14
On the other hand, there's the way they look at each other sometimes, that secret way when they think no one's watching. Is that love? And there's also the fact that Father tries to protect John the same way he tries to protect Tristram. Does that mean he loves them both? Tristram knows it's possible to love more than one person, so the thought doesn't make him jealous. In fact, it makes him feel stunned, almost, like when something's really obvious and you didn't see it and all of a sudden it clicks. Like everything is perfectly right and aligned, at least for the moment. It's almost easier for Tristram to call what's between Father and John 'love' than to apply the same label to Father and Tristram's relationship, if only because he's spent so much time thinking about Father and John lately, and it seems that he's being inexorably pushed toward that conclusion.
"Okay. Okay," he repeated, now grinning broadly because he couldn't help it, and because he couldn't help the next bit either, he went over and kissed Sherlock again, only this time it was on the mouth and there might even have been a hint of tongue, and John hoped to God that Sherlock understood what he was trying to say. He thought he might just, as he had a rather dazed expression by the time John was done with him.
The doorbell rang downstairs; footsteps and voices followed. Mycroft? Sherlock's eyes peeled away from John's as he looked over his shoulder toward the door. "All things considered, probably the best course of action," he said cryptically and swung himself around to get out of bed. "You can take the hall bathroom, I'll use my parents'," he said. He went to his suitcase and gathered a few items, which he held in a bundle in front of him as he slipped out the door, keeping his back to John.
She chuckles. "I'm not sure Doctor Watson will appreciate that."
It's not that his father is kissing a man - although he's perfectly aware that is a behaviour which the majority of men would not engage in, and in fact is likely to garner ridicule or worse. The percentage of his father's behaviours which coincide with the majority of the population is so small as to be statistically insignificant anyway; and the percentage likely to garner ridicule conversely large. He doesn't even consider the fact that, if anyone from school were to find out, it could make life difficult for him. The difficulties that come with being Sherlock Holmes' son are the warp of his life's weave, so omnipresent that they don't even register.
Thanks to ruth0007 and dioscureantwins for the invaluable feedback and help with rewriting this chapter.
He must lose track of time and place for a short while, because the next thing he knows, there are long legs standing beside him, and Doctor Watson's voice is saying, "What are you two up to, then?"
"Tell me, Molly," Lestrade repeated. "What did you know?"
Sherlock nods stiffly but doesn't turn around.
Sherlock makes a dismissive gesture with his hand. "I took care of the cameras earlier. They were on, but nothing was recording. 'Technical malfunction'."
"And you're certain it's her?" John drags his eyes up to Sherlock's.
"Absolutely. The surgeon who worked on her was talking about it because the case was so unusual."
Sherlock shifted and raised the covers. His heart was racing so fast it was forcing his respiration to increase as well.
. Sherlock's arse clenching, his pelvis jerking forward. Not quite enough. Faster. John's arm cramping.
"Not like that's familiar or anything," John mutters. Then in a more normal tone, he asks, "Well, can you stop it? Do you know the password?"
Father puts his hand up on Doctor Watson's elbow and stares right back. His eyes are really big. It looks like he didn't might not have known whatever it is. Tristram can see his throat move as he swallows. Eventually, he nods once.
Finally, finally, after Doctor Watson has checked both of their homework and Emily's redone her spelling, he says they can go play. Tristram wants to play Snap, but Emily wants to play 'Emergency'. Tristram agrees to play Emergency first, because he really does like the feel of his phone in his hand.
"So, what, did she follow me here?"
"Did you track down that witness after all?"
!" Emily exclaims. But then her face falls a bit. "But my dad doesn't want me to read it."
Sherlock glanced at it, then tossed it onto the coffee table.
"I am jolly well e'en smarter? E'en?" John reads incredulously.
And then there are those times when it's just Tristram and Doctor Watson, when Emily's father talks to him, asks his opinion and listens hard. When he gives Tristram time to say what he wants to, even if it's nothing. It's like he can never give a wrong answer when he's talking to Doctor Watson. Or the things the three of them - himself, Doctor Watson, and Emily - have done without Father, like playing at the park or even doing homework. Tristram wouldn't want to give up any of that. Even if Doctor Watson sometimes wants to talk about things that Tristram would rather let lie.
This is a new idea for Tristram, and an intriguing one. He's never actively wished to have a sibling; his father doesn't get on well with his own brother, Uncle Mycroft, and he's never interacted closely enough with another family to be able to judge what a home life with more than one child might be like. It does get lonely and boring sometimes, being all alone in the flat when his father's out working on a case (or even when he's at home and immersed in his own experiments or thoughts) and it's only Mrs Hudson puttering around downstairs. He's worldly enough to know that having a sibling wouldn't mean they'd always get along, though, or even be interested in doing things together. He likes playing with Emily, but maybe it would be different if they were around each other all the time. He decides to reserve judgment on the issue for the moment, although it's certainly an idea he'll be revisiting.
"It's going to be brilliant," John said as he came in. "People are going to be talking about this one for years."
"He get you anywhere else?" John asks.
"I'm going to have a look around outside. Stay away from the windows." He pulls the door shut behind him. Tristram hears him walking away - faintly - and then the cotton-wool blackness is back again. Tristram doesn't dare do anything but lie stock still under the blanket and try not to think about what's outside the window, or what he saw in his father's room. Not to think about anything at all.
"Maybe they'll end up looking like a map of the Underground!" Emily says. "Like on Dumbledore's knee. Look, this could be the Jubilee Line right here!" She traces her finger down Tristram's back. It tickles, and he twists away, laughing.
John shakes him off. "Yes, I can. Or what, have you blacklisted my passport or something? You did, didn't you. You and your bloody brother. I will fucking
Father stops what he's doing on his computer and looks over at Tristram. His face looks eerie and distorted in the yellowish glow from his screen.
"Oh God... Come- Can you come here?" John slid one hand up from Sherlock's hip to the back of his shoulder to nudge him down.
Within a matter of seconds, the school yard was full of hair-pulling, shin-kicking, epithet-hurling furies, trying to come to their teachers' aid. And John and Moriarty were at the bottom of the pile. Sherlock shouted - not that his own pupils had ever been much impressed by that; he was under no illusions how little impact it would have on Moriarty's - and pulled the screeching brats back as fast as he could. But he could only hold onto two of them at a time, and as soon as he let go to grab another pair, the first two leapt into the fray again.
Donovan and Anderson had seen what John was like when Sherlock was on the line and was far from interested in angering him and did as he asked. Donovan went in first and carefully helped John guide Sherlock into the back seat. As soon as he was sat in the middle, Donovan could practically feel the cold radiating from his body instead of heat. She truly wondered how he was still breathing and her eyes were filled with guilt and sadness as she stared at the barely breathing person she called a freak all the time. Anderson entered last and shut the car door. It was beginning to get hot in the car but Lord knows Sherlock needed it. Donovan and Anderson suddenly didn't feel so bad about giving up her jacket. Sherlock groaned, he was beginning to warm up. His body still shivered and being so cold and suddenly being thrust into a hot car made his limbs tingle though he was grateful that he was rescued from his icy prison. So grateful, in fact, that he felt tears rolling down his cheeks and his breath hitched, gaining the attention of Anderson and Donovan. Even more surprised to more vulnerability from the cold and calm man.
"Mycroft!, Mycroft, you must help us." John panted into the phone rendering Mycroft silent, "Sherlock's gotten himself into trouble again. He's...He's dying and we're stuck in traffic and...and I can't get him to the hospital. For god's sake Mycroft-"
Was that....
"Well, I'm not trying to be funny I'm trying to be realistic." Sherlock again rolled his eyes at John much more dramatically this time.
"Piss off."
"J-john?"
"Not likely. This is the M- twenty fucking five, We should have expected this."
Heart attack, Liver damage, kidney failure, and brain damage were all on the table. What if Sherlock lost his abilities? What if he turned into a...into a...
Sherlock's pulse was there but it was faint. John let out a shaky sigh of relief and quickly shrugged off his parka, wrapping Sherlock in it. As she jostled Sherlock around, the frost fell from his hair and into his face. Sherlock's white eyelashes fluttered open. His eyes dull and glazed over as he turned towards John.
Mycroft lifted a hand up to his mouth, eyeing his brother carefully. Sherlock's eyes were barely open as they lifted off the ground. His pale and full lips parted in what Mycroft could only see as pain. His hands stayed by his sides as the paramedics clasped an oxygen mask over his face and covered him with blankets. The orange shock blankets Sherlock always hated.
John was sure Sherlock was asleep. His breathing was steady and calm and he was no longer moving. John felt sleep call to him as well. John heard Sherlock practically giggle in his sleep and he nuzzled John with a content sigh. John couldn't help but hold him closer.
With Sherlock finally rescued, John and Sherlock get caught in traffic and John must call Mycroft for help.
The very thought of Sherlock being the opposite of alive made John uneasy and rightfully so. Suddenly, he found himself moving a little quicker and with a little more urgency.
"I only let you touch me for a few moments and that already took a massive toll on my body I don't know if it's still a good idea and last I checked you were not gay, neither am I."
"Damn it..." Lestrade smacked the steering wheel as they were stuck in traffic. No matter how many times Lestrade honked the horn, nobody moved. The root of the traffic must have been far ahead. Of all the days, it had to be this one? John turned around to see Sherlock panting in Donovan's grasp. He would question the woman's kindness though even though he was quite aware she was a bitch, she wasn't below making Sherlock suffer more than he had to. Anderson, on the other hand, was scooted as far away from Sherlock as possible and even behind his mask, he showed much annoyance with Sherlock's situation.
"I did."
John had to admit it was a bit strange for Sherlock to not be home by now and there was this tight nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach. What if Sherlock was actually hurt? The dumb and coy bastard always found a way to get himself in trouble and John would be lying if he said he wasn't worried. With a sigh he pulled out his phone and called Sherlock, holding the phone up to his ear.
Mycroft felt his heart sink a little. "He won't what?"
"I wasn't scared." Sherlock defended his dignity.
"Hugging you."
. It nipped at his skin like wildfire and he felt himself shivering at the lack of heat.
Anderson was now above Donovan on John's hit list.
"Because you almost died, Sherlock!" John pulled back and he could have sworn he saw Sherlock flinch at the loss.
Just walking right up to the black lion, and shoving his hands in its magnificent mane.
to his room. Nearly tripping on a book before slamming the door, leaving John standing in the middle of the kitchen, his hands still at his sides and his heart thoroughly broken. How was he to know Sherlock would react like that? John suddenly began digging into his mind. His psychology and medical classes were stuck in the back of his head and he rummaged through any information that could help him. He had many theories of why Sherlock had acted the way he did but none of them were solid. He would have to ask Sherlock himself.
"People touching me."
"What? Why?! I don't want to stay here in this bloody traffic!"
"It's alright Sherlock. You're going to be okay, mate. I got you." John's voice was shaky. He wasn't sure if it was from the cold or from fear but it scared him. John put his arms behind Sherlock's neck and under his knees and with a huff he lifted him up. John was a short man and Sherlock was tall and pretty heavy. It was awkward holding such a lanky man in his small arms but he hadn't much of a choice.
"I'll stay here and wait the traffic out and come back to the hospital, Text me when Sherlock is alright!" Lestrade yelled over the wind. John nodded. He very well couldn't ask Lestrade to ditch his car to uselessly ride in the helicopter with them.
"I think you've got the saying all wrong.."
"You're my best mate, Sherlock. This isn't a matter of relationships it's more a matter of mental health. No matter what Donovan or Anderson or even you say, you're still human and have human needs."
Sherlock stood himself up on long wobbly legs and walked to the large door that seemed to be the only exit to the walk-in freezer, however, his heart dropped ten stories when he pushed on the door and it didn't budge. He pulled on it, hoping it was a pull and not a push, the door did not move. Sherlock felt himself shivering far more than before. In fear more than the cold. Normally he was such a calm and collected man, but the thought of a man such as himself being bested by a serial killer who destroyed him with a freezer? Oh, that really made his blood boil, and yet he didn't feel any warmer. With a yell of frustration, Sherlock kicked the door and shoved his hands into his pocket, and sighed in relief when he felt the familiar cold plastic of his phone case. Pulling it out he searched through his contacts with shaky and numb fingers. This wasn't good, he could not be in there for more than an hour at most. Sherlock didn't have any meat on him, he was a skinny man and had no protection from the deadly cold. He needed John.
Tristram does not scream. He does not make a sound. He does check that the curtains are drawn tight; they are, as they always are, even during the day, at Tristram's request. Insistence, really. Tristram knows the thin piece of material won't stop a bullet, but at least this way anyone who might be outside can't pinpoint his precise position in the room. His singular thought beyond that is that he has to contact his father. He usually arrives just as visiting hours are ending for the day, and then stays overnight, sitting at the table clicking away on his laptop or sitting hunched over his phone in the chair by Tristram's bed. It's pretty much like a typical evening at their flat, actually, from the days when Tristram had taken to sleeping on the couch, only without the violin. But he isn't there yet, and probably won't be for a couple of hours.
A small line appears between Sherlock's eyebrows. "I can't- That's two different questions. Yes, everything I told you is true. Irene is correct, we never discussed anything after I left with you for the Falls, and we never planned any of this, here, beyond her oblique reference to me dealing with Moriarty's files. Which is unfortunate, as she's left us with a tidy little problem to deal with. And no, I didn't leave anything out last night. Not knowingly, anyway. John, I..." His voice drops, adding an extra layer of soberness. "I meant what I said." After a couple of seconds, he adds, "All of it ..."
Sherlock took another sharp breath. "I mean I don't know what the protocol is for this. Do we simply say goodnight and ignore each other until the morning?"
"Good morning." Sherlock's voice cut through the remnants of John's sleep haze. He was barely awake, but Sherlock must have been waiting for him to stir beside him and pounced on the first sign of life. John cracked his eyes open. The thin, winter light in the room told him the morning was well advanced.
"If I don't agree to this, she'll find some other way," Father says. "I'd like it to be on my terms."
John wraps his arms around Sherlock's body and he presses firm, steady hands against the undulating muscles of Sherlock's back. Sherlock's arms are braced on the mattress on either side of John, where his hands flex and clench in an odd syncopated rhythm with the increasingly erratic motions of his hips. Their kisses are little more than breathless smears and both of them are making sounds that start somewhere deeper than their throats. They whisper each other's names, as if inventing a new, secret language, and when first one climaxes, then the other, the echo reverberates between their hearts.
Father interrupts him: "Something's wrong." He gets up and walks over to Tristram, keeping his eyes firmly locked on Tristram's. "What is it?" He puts his hands on Tristram's shoulders and leads him to the bed, making him sit down on the edge. Right next to where -
"Well according to you I never listen so why should I compete with your massive intellect?"
Sherlock craved a bag of greasy hot chips and a fat burger from a cheap fast food place. Sherlock wasn't a fan of fast food. He found it rather disgusting and unhealthy, though John would sometimes buy it when neither of them felt like cooking. Sherlock had neglected his needs since they were on a case and the feeling of hunger combined with the feeling of cold wasn't pleasant. The feeling of warm food In a bag was something Sherlock longed for right now. He could almost feel the warmth in his hands if he focused his concentration. That feeling went away quickly when he felt the coldness on his face once again and curled up tighter against himself.
"Lestrade." Lestrade nearly jumped at John's voice. Lestrade almost dropped the stack of paperwork he held in his hands. With a relieved sigh, he straightened the papers out and deposited them in a nearby file cabinet. Donovan and Anderson were there as well. Anderson sipping on a mug of black and bitter coffee and Donovan hunched over paperwork with a rather annoyed expression.
Sherlock clicked on John's contact and pressed the call button, his hands were shaking far too much to be able to send a text. Sherlock let out a strange noise when the call didn't go through and the icon on his screen was replaced with wifi bars that were empty.
"Are you alright?"
John looked at his phone with a raised eyebrow. Now that was odd. Sherlock never turns off his phone and where could he possibly be that didn't have reception?
When we looked to the ground and saw the frightfully still consulting detective he almost dropped his gun. His heart plummeted to his stomach and he swore he felt tears spring to the corners of his eyes along with the unexplainable mixture of feelings. Anger, sadness, and worry sloshed into one concoction of lost hope and broken sorrows. His knees stung as he fell to the floor next to Sherlock and quickly began examining him. He could hear Donovan's frightened gasp behind him and he quickly pressed his fingers to Sherlock's neck. God, he was as cold as ice. His lips were blue and frost had settled on his eyelashes and curly black locks. He looked like a snow angel, and John feared that if he did not hurry, he would soon become one.
"So be it." John spat with a nasty face. Lestrade didn't blame him for wanting to try. Sherlock was his best mate and Lestrade would be lying if he said he would be tempted to carry him to the hospital himself, but it was simply too far. They would have to keep him warm until the traffic subsided.
"Where is Sherlock, by the way? He left during the case and didn't say a word to me. Figured the bastard came back here when he was done." John suddenly became fairly uncomfortable at the look of confusion on Mrs. Hudson's face as she slowly placed her hand on the back of a nearby chair.
"you watch too much TV." Anderson shook his head with a chuckle. John, however, was not amused. Without another word, John stood up and scrambled out the door. Lestrade barely had enough time to get out of his chair to follow and Donovan and Anderson looked at each other momentarily before following. It beat doing paperwork.
Sherlock groaned when John jostled him a bit too hard as exited the building. Holding him close and making sure the coats were wrapped securely around him.
"Watch your mouth," John warned lifting a finger at Anderson who only rolled his eyes. Such disrespect wasn't uncommon from Donovon or Anderson though John tried to keep Sherlock's name out of their mouths as much as possible. As well as his insulting nickname. "I tried calling him and it says he was unavailable. I tried calling him three more times on my way here."
"I'm not sure you should be, Sherlock, you just rolled your eyes so hard you saw the back of your brain, are you alright?"
"Get...get the hell out of my way." John huffed as he struggled carrying Sherlock out the door. Sherlock's head tucked under John's chin. Anderson and Donovan both looked at each other, their jaws dropped halfway. This was turning out to be a shit night.
John took a look at Donovan who looked equally curious to hear the answer.
Was she alright? That's seriously what he was asking her right now? She wasn't the one who had been locked in a freezer! Donovan looked down at her hands and nodded even though she wasn't. She didn't want to seem selfish.
This wasn't some of those times. Sherlock failed to excogitate like normal and it nearly cost him his life. John was angrier at the fact that Sherlock had the nerve to apologize to
"I...I don't mean it like that I'm not...You're my best friend, Sherlock."
"I need to make sure my consulting detective is alive, John.
Sherlock's head snapped up at the sound of metal clanging on metal and noticed some steel hooks about twenty feet away from him moving around as if somebody had run through them. Sherlock pulled out his gun and tightened his grip on it. His icy eyes were vigilant as he slowly approached the steel hooks. There was definitely somebody here, and that half proves that Sherlock was correct in his deduction. He began to regret speeding off so quickly and leaving John at the crime scene. He was beginning to feel odd not having John at his side, especially in this situation.
Sherlock's teeth chattered violently. His nose and cheeks were red with the cold and his knees shook under his raw and red fingers. He had been trapped in that locker for a little over a half-hour but to Sherlock, it was almost as if he had been in there for hours. He knew he couldn't last much longer if his body was reacting this badly already. God, Sherlock much preferred the heat over the cold. As much as he hated getting sunburnt, which he did so very easily, he loved laying in the sun. He didn't like winter and he hated being cold. He was fairly certain that his hatred for cold weather would only grow if he survived this. With a shaking hand, Sherlock put icy fingers to his neck to check his pulse. It was slow and that wasn't a good sign. He was begging to grow drowsy.
"Sorry."
"John, I-" Sherlock began, but his words caught in his throat and it felt as if he was drowning. He clenched his shirt in his hands.
"Good lord, John, What have you done?"
"He hasn't come home, John. I thought he was with you."
"And what is the
"We can talk but...I want to shower first." Sherlock murmured.
"Are you sure he isn't just ignoring you?" Donovan set her pen down on her desk and glared at John.
John froze, partly in relief and partly in surprise that Mycroft would respond so quickly. The phone hung up and John didn't get the chance to tell Mycroft where they were, though he relaxed when he remembered that he wouldn't need to. He was sure Mycroft probably already knew. Lestrade looked out the window and sighed. The traffic hadn't moved at all. Again, what did you expect from the M-25?
"I know, I figured as much. I apologize. I overstepped my boundaries."
"Leave her be, Mycroft. Focus on your brother."
"How long has it been like this?"
sherlock made another noise, unlike a groan or a moan. In fact, it was rather high-pitched and awfully embarrassing, Sherlock felt his cheeks warm up even though he still felt cold. He hoped that nobody else was in the room with him.
Mycroft arrives at the scene with help and raising hell or high water for his baby brother.
"Hush, Sherlock. You don't need to pretend you're alright all the time. I'm more than happy to help you with this. Just relax, I'm going to take care of you."
"Please John, hurry, I don't know how long I have left..."
"It's just...I'm not used to it."
Very slowly but surely, Sherlock managed to open his eyes. The light was still bright to him but he was grateful he was no longer being smitten by the gods in the form of a hospital lamp. John looked like a blob to him at first but Sherlock almost cried when John had fully formed into his normal self. Sherlock wasn't sure if he was happy to see John or was just overjoyed that he hadn't gone blind.
"I'm sorry."
"Be careful saying that out loud, people might talk." Sherlock joked. "I'm not sure that's a good idea. My body never listens to me. I would rather not have you see what happens."
Sherlock's eyes felt like the heaviest weights he had ever lifted. His entire body had stopped shaking and he could almost no longer feel the sting of cold on his body anymore. As pleasant as that may have sounded, that was really really bad. Sherlock knew that meant his time was almost up. He was in the last stage of hypothermia and would not make it if he stayed in the freezer any longer. His eyes began to water up. He didn't want to die. He didn't even catch the killer and now somebody else might die because of his failure. He was stupid enough to go after a murderer with no backup or plan. Only a bruised ego and a gun which he no longer had. When a tear rolled down his cheekbone he could have sworn it turned to ice. Like a crystal falling from his icy blue eyes. This was it, he was going to die. He longed to see John and Mrs. Hudson once more. Kiss Mrs. Hundson on the cheek and apologize he had been an arse to her. He wanted to hug John and never let go and tell him how he was his best friend and he had never had a friend like him, and he couldn't and that broke him like ice. He thought about Mycroft and how he would react to his death. The old sod would probably eat his heart away and throw away his diet. He always did that when he got his heart broken.
John flagged down a cabbie as quickly as he could and directed the driver to take him to the Scotland Yard. The whole ride there he nervously tapped his fingers on his knees. He wasn't worried, was he? Sherlock was a perfectly capable human being and could protect himself far better than John ever could. At least that's what John kept telling himself. The current murderer they were investigating was tricky and he somehow managed to stump Sherlock. Could he possibly outsmart him?
John had trouble thinking about the possibility of Sherlock turning into a....
John kept looking at Sherlock, hands nearly knocking over his teacup as he picked it up and filled it up with hot water, dunking the teabag in and leaning up against the counter as he watched Sherlock.
The words echoed throughout Sherlock's skull giving him a warm feeling of belonging. It felt so right cuddled up to John like this. As platonic as it was, Sherlock couldn't help but get closer. John relished hearing Sherlock's soft breathing and feeling the warmth from his shivering body. John rubbed Sherlock's cold arms up and down and Sherlock whimpered at the feeling. John could see the slightest ghost of a smile on Sherlock's face and it made him feel so cozy. Sherlock had such a beautiful smile.
But oddly, despite Tristram's discomfort when he considers each individual part of the message, as a whole it's secretly his favourite of the three. Secretly because it feels disloyal not to like his father's message best. And he loves his father's message. He's already read it what seems like dozens of times. He has to turn his arm over to see Doctor Watson's message, but then it's like that surprised and delighted feeling you get when you open a drawer you haven't looked in for a while, and find something you were looking for forever and thought was lost.
If they were at Tristram's house, they could use actual flies. There are always a few dead ones lying on the window sills. But Uncle Mycroft has a cleaner. Still, Tristram has an idea. He picks up the bar of soap and scrapes some off with his nails.
They finish their breakfast in silence - neither one of them eats much more - and are in the middle of putting things away when a woman in red trousers and a bright jumper with a zig-zag pattern bustles in with several plastic bags of groceries. Tristram recognises her as the same household help who was here when they visited the previous summer. Mrs Bowen, her name was. She's about ten years younger than Mrs Hudson and has a few extra pounds around her middle.
I swallowed over a dry throat. I supposed I should not be surprised that he would already have deduced what I was up to. My nervousness, which up to now had been confined to a few butterflies in my stomach, erupted in a prickle of sweat under my arms and a flush which I felt creeping up my ears.
"Oh. Right. Because I wouldn't have anything useful to add to the report." Doctor Watson says it in a way that means he thinks the exact opposite.
Tristram thought they spoke another language in Switzerland - and to be sure, many of the people waiting with them at baggage claim and queuing in the tiny bank weren't speaking English, but that's no different than London. All of the airport signs, though, are in English - Information, Bank, Check-in, Shopping, Taxi, Gates, Parking. Some look like whoever made the sign wasn't sure how to spell, like Telefon/Telephone and Toiletten/Toilets. But some of the signs have words in what must be another language in addition to the English - Gepäckausgabe/Baggage Claim, Ausgang/Exit, Zoll/Customs. Extrapolating, that must mean that the 'misspelled' words are also in that other language. Tristram wonders what it is.
"Is Sherlock hurt?" Emily asks in a hushed voice once their fathers have disappeared into the bathroom.
He somehow made it to the door, cognisant at some level of everyone watching him, but not really seeing them, and escaped down the hall to his classroom.

"Sorry, who?"
"No, I agree," John says quickly. "But we'll need to know them by sight, at least. If only so we can tell them apart from Moran's gang, assuming they're also on their way."
Father slouches down more firmly in his chair, frowning at his phone, which he's holding up in front of his face. "No, I don't."
Sherlock touches him on the arm. "John," he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's possible Magnussen's been having you shadowed," Sherlock concedes, "but it's more likely he's been monitoring your internet activity." He precludes any need to ask what John's internet activity has to do with his presence at the hotel by explaining, in a slightly more patient way that grates even worse than the condescension, "You went online this afternoon and reserved the room, John."
"He told me to," he deflects, pointing at Doctor Watson.
"Get Tristram and Emily to cover. Now!" Father shoves Tristram at Doctor Watson, and then Tristram can't follow what's happening very well. All he knows is that Doctor Watson's picked him up under one arm and Emily under the other and dives with them behind the check-in desk.
"How about here?" Doctor Watson touches another spot lower down. Tristram compares the picture on the phone. That must be the second stitched-up cut. It's sore but not painful. Tristram shakes his head.
"No."
"Where did he get your number?" Sherlock realised suddenly.
"Yes, we'll leave that as a last resort, shall we?"
"Can I touch you?" he asked in a voice that was low and rough around the edges.
At the conclusion of the story, Doctor Watson leans back and flops both hands down on the armrests of his chair. "I never would have seen that coming."
Ah. Now he's getting closer. The question is, does she actually want to go home, or does she want to leave Grandmother's? He supposes it doesn't much matter; they haven't any choice in the matter. They are at the mercy of their fathers' wills. He answers as truthfully as he can: "Whenever my father decides it's safe enough."
And all the time, he was aware of John's eyes on him. John was right: it was exciting.
&&&&&&
This is set six months after the end of chapter 23 and is for ruth0007 on LJ, who wanted to see the day John moves in.
It turns out Irene was telling the truth about keeping him safe while Father and John were busy setting a trap for the man who was doing all the bad things. Even Emily had to go stay with Uncle Mycroft. Tristram has a brief, ridiculous vision of Uncle Mycroft playing Super Mario Kart with her. On the other hand, he never would have dreamed that Father would enjoy reading the Harry Potter books out loud to him. And if anyone could get Uncle Mycroft to play video games, it would be Emily.
"Ethiopian all right?" he asked as he composed his text.
Before Sherlock can respond, Harry appears at the top of the stairs in loose shorts and a sweatshirt. She's blinking and squinting against the light. "What's going on? Sherlock? What the hell, you're going to wake Emily," she hisses.
"Oh. No, no case," Sherlock said, regretfully, as he slid into his chair. They'd just wrapped up a case last week but it hadn't involved much legwork. Mostly combing through phone records and tracking down the manufacturer of a certain type of piano wire. John had been happy anyway. Sherlock wished Lestrade had a case for them. Sherlock would have liked to see again the way John's entire body came to life, the way his expression became focused and his jaw firm with purpose. But that would have to wait. Lestrade had other things entirely on his mind at the moment.
John stares at Sherlock. "Right," he says, very quietly. "Right. If that's all then. I'll be collecting my daughter." He turns to Mycroft. "Where is she?"
"I wasn't asleep," Sherlock said. Once again, his heart beat furiously at the sound of John's voice, the knowledge of his proximity. Pavlovian.
His father makes them stop off at the bathroom to wash their hands before proceeding downstairs. Tristram already feels better about this visit. Without Emily's aunts around, he doesn't worry so much about smudging the doors or knocking something off a shelf. And his father and Doctor Watson have managed to be alone together without getting into an argument.
Grandmother, throughout the recounting, sits calmly and eats her roast, following the exchange between Doctor Watson and Father as if it were a tennis match.
Sally finally got a line on them. They were standing by the window, their heads leaning together in order to be heard over the ambient noise. "They're just talking." Not that she had any particular desire to defend Holmes or his assistant, but she didn't see anything untoward. And she felt like being contradictory to Nigel, who had been a rather humongous dick the past couple of weeks.
Kate shakes her head. She looks frustrated. "It's not that. He's not right."
"Look, Bill, isn't this a sweet one. She's getting so big." Vi Holmes tilted her tablet so her husband could see it from his position beside her in bed. He lowered his own tablet, where he'd been reading Philbrick's latest. Gripping stuff. He cleared his brain of muskets and revolutionaries to focus on the small grinning face displayed on the screen. Rosie Watson. Sixteen months old now. Her wispy brown hair was scraped together into a pigtail sprouting out of the top of her head. She had her plump hands clasped under her chin and her eyes closed. 'Rosie deducing', John had added as a caption across the bottom.
Tristram looks at him too, hoping it is okay. A blanket invitation to come over any time he likes!
Sender: John
'We have to move fast now, Tristram,' she'd said, wrapping her fingers around his arm the second John and Emily went through the hissing door at the end of the carriage, heading for the loo. Irene's eyes were big and intent. He'd thought they were earnest too, but now he thinks he was wrong. 'Someone has followed us onto this train, and I don't intend to let them catch us. Do you trust me?' she asked him.
"Could be done," John says stolidly.
"Okay, it's okay, I've got you, that's it," John assured and coaxed. He took over once again, his hand on Sherlock now flying firmly up and down his shaft. He wrapped his other arm around Sherlock's back and held him, mumbling encouragements and praise until Sherlock tensed and grunted into John's neck, his spirit's essence splashing warm and thick onto John's side.
He shook out a crease in the broadsheet, drawing my eyes inadvertently to his capable, steady fingers. Those fingers had mapped every inch of my unclothed body, invaded every cranny, drawn out inexplicable pleasure from me until I was insensate. Now, at most, they might pass me a letter-opener or clap my shoulder over my coat.
There was a sudden burst of pain. It was not excruciating, but my instinct was to lift my arm again immediately and shake the offending objects out. I gritted my teeth and let the weight of my arm drop further. I did not want to disappoint Holmes.
... It hadn't been Moriarty at all. It had been John. How exactly- But he must have overheard the conversation. Of course. That explained his behaviour afterwards, on the way back to the school. He hadn't wanted to admit he'd overheard a conversation not meant for his ears. Yet he'd obviously gone and done just that, to someone in a position to blow the whole thing wide open. Sherlock's head was a whirl of conflicting emotions and impulses. He couldn't deal with this now. He needed to get out of here, needed to think! But everyone was waiting for him to say something. For lack of a better idea, he began with what he'd been planning to say a moment ago.
