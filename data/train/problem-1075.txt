Mrs Holmes blinked at him, an endeared smile blooming on her face, “Darling you don’t have to do that I-”
After about an infuriating hour, having managed to make only a measly six mince pies, the boys decided to give up. The both of them were covered in way more flour than seemed humanly possible, and Sherlock still seemed fit in levitating what remained of their overly thin pastry above their heads.
“Oh. Oh right.” John paused a moment, looking at him hesitantly, “So you’ve got a boyfriend? Which is fine by the way!”
“I’m so sorry-” John wheezed, “Ah… it’s really not your night, is it?” He began to dab his eyes gently with a nearby napkin, still bobbing up and down somewhat as his laughter petered away.
“Do you have the photographs?” Sherlock said, leaning forward, “Can I have them? If they’re fakes surely I’m allowed to-”
But how they would be punishing him that day, Sherlock never found out. Thinking quickly, he flicked his heal up behind him and kicked Seb hard in the crotch, and without a seconds pause turned his head around as far as his neck allowed and spat at Anderson's sour, sweaty face. He was nowhere near as strong as Sebastian and lifting a boy at least an inch taller than him was taking its toll so the sudden shock of pain and saliva meant Sherlock could wriggle free. With no time to waste, he darted through the lunchtime shoppers to escape his pesterers after making sure to retrieve all five of his bags from the floor. Then he just kept running.
Somehow over an hour had past, and there they were still scrunched uncomfortably in a filthy corner of the Owlery as Sherlock reeled off letter, after letter, after letter to John, who seemed, at least, to be clinging to every word. To be quite honest, Sherlock daren’t question why he was listening so intently, why he was interjecting at the correct, informed, appropriate points, or why he was exclaiming “fantastic!” and “brilliant!” at random intervals. So, to combat those worries… Sherlock just kind of… kept going? It wasn’t until the clock tower rang out 9 o’clock across the cool night air that Sherlock finally stopped talking, much to both his and John’s disappointment.
John burst out laughing, “I am not overly keen on your train of thought there, Greg… don’t tell me you’ve been so unlucky with Molly that you’re going to chase Mycroft!”
And then it came to John. Mrs Holmes passed John the envelope eagerly, and Sherlock’s stomach dropped.
“Is that a ministry seal?” John asked, looking at the letter Sherlock had taken from the tawny owl’s talons.
“You- you wouldn’t- you really wouldn’t try here would you? Metres away from the headmistress’ office?” he gabbled, trying to control the definite tremble in his voice “Or is- is going into the Forbidden Forest at midnight how you too get your kicks?”
The colours above began to bleed deep blues and purples into the still vibrant oranges and pinks of the late September sky, as John ambled his way from the changing rooms up the hill toward the castle, feeling the lightest he had in a long while.
“Trying and failing. You’ve done nothing in the last ten minutes but draw what appears to be yourself on a broomstick-”
The group all clapped and made agreeable sounds before spreading themselves up and down the Gryffindor table. John, though, could not stop worrying, and was pretty certain they would not be fine, but he definitely was not going to tell his team that an hour before they took flight.
Greg slumped into his rickety chair with such weight, John was surprised it didn’t split beneath him.
“Oh just, well, erm…” John realised quickly his lack of answer sounded a lot more suspicious than what they’d actually been doing. Greg winked at him.
“I think I’ve seen you around with her a bit. Are- are you two…? Have you ever been-” John said, trying the best he could to keep the conversation going.
“Leave it alone, Mr Holmes,” She said wearily, “Surely you’re not too arrogant to believe no someone could fool you?”
“Don’t worry! They put some special shield over the lake which warms it up a bit!” he said, teeth chattering, pulling on a jumper roughly over his head “Which I’m glad for, if this is how swimming feels in September!”
“See, I’m not the only one who reads over people’s shoulder” She teased, leaning in rather closer than Sherlock felt necessary.
“Pfft, John… I know many a secret passage in this place that even the teachers don’t know exist…” he said proudly.
John had never baked the wizarding way before, but he had made mince pies with his mother when he was younger, and he was very interested to see how the methods differed. Very, was his assumption.
John clambered between the sheets, and the dorm room exchanged their goodnights to one another, and it wasn’t long before Greg’s snoring could be heard loud and clear from behind his curtains. But John. John lay awake for just an hour or so, his mind mulling over the evening’s affairs, and found he just simply couldn’t wait for breakfast the next morning.
Sherlock swallowed, the sound of bubbling cauldrons and pots, and Mr and Mrs Holmes apparent attempt to make Mycroft play charades in the next room filling the silence.
Hello! This is yet another case of throwing many chapters at you all at once! I'm sorry! Hope you enjoy the four chapters coming at you over the next few days! (It's so I can get the VERY LONG Christmas chapter up before new year)
Sebastian was almost sobbing with amusement, falling over his desk in attempt to stifle it. John felt a wave of fury wash over him, and he didn’t know why?
Mycroft apparated himself to his bedroom almost immediately in some dramatic show of how eager he was to get away from them both, which left Sherlock and John in the lounge, a box of the remaining bunting lying excitedly between their feet.
The sudden laconism that followed startled both of them somewhat, as if John’s words carried some weight, which neither of them thought to be true.
John, too, bought a pumpkin lollipop, and Greg bought a chocolate frog, and the three of them then found a seat on the low wall outside, covered in decorative cobwebs,
Weekends had never been his thing at Hogwarts, they allowed more time for boredom, and supplied Seb and the others more time to torment him… still, John had asked him to breakfast,
But after a few moments, the bluish smoke swirling in front of his face, Sherlock stopped abruptly, rather embarrassed all of a sudden.
John stared at the photograph, and his mother and father were staring back at him, beaming up at him. Not only beaming but laughing, they were moving, looking from John to each other, and then to a younger Harry, and then his own younger self. John’s father wrapped his arms round all of them giving them the biggest squeeze. John remembered that squeeze, the warmth of it, the comfort of it, how it made him feel safe, feel home.
A short, slim, pale boy was sat on the windowsill at the head of the common room, cloak still tied, with what appeared to be a suitcase at his feet. Sherlock stared. A Slytherin scarf and tie were folded upon his lap. He was smiling at him.
“Has my brother shown any signs of… being irritable, or skittish, fidgety while you’ve been associated with him? Locked himself away, disappeared for days on end?”
, when Mike, who’d been concentrating sternly on his thrid bowl of ‘Pixie Puffs’, finally clocked the injuries to Sherlock’s face,
“The hours up. I play fair,” He said, rising, “I’ll go get her letter. Meet you outside McGonagall’s room?”
“What if your friend Mr Watson hadn’t checked the papers, hm? You would have been harbouring a murder from the school, a murder that took place in very close proximity to here. What if the murderer had gotten into the grounds?”
Harry had been all for it of course, she obviously had more faith in him as an alchemist than he had. She was very generous, Sherlock thought.
“I’ve spent time with you for the last two days, both in which we’ve sat in the Owlery surrounded by feathers and poo. Is this a coincidence or do I need to invest in some wellies?” John said, teasingly.
As he made his way to breakfast he noticed the corridors had been laced with garlands of spiders’ webs and in many cases, spiders, which he chose to ignore, and the ghosts were singing chorally from far distances of the castle. John felt very much in the spirit of things. Yet, although the breakfast of warmly spiced porridge and lashings of hot tea was delicious, and the floating pumpkins bobbed playfully above their heads, John was much more excited for the event planned later that evening in the Gryffindor common room.
Sherlock’s bare hips were exposed with the combination of his loose fitting pyjama bottoms, (neither of them had bothered dressing that day) and his arms being raised above his head. John didn’t quite know where to put his hands, and he felt his face beginning to redden at the contact.
“Here,” John wafted a small tearing of parchment at him, “Your mum tried slipping it under your door earlier, but erm… you… burned it… want to see?”
“Right, is it only your nose?” John said breathily, crouching beside him whilst fumbling through his rucksack.
“Oh you might’ve missed it, but you didn’t. It isn’t in there,” he said, faster paced, growing in enthusiasm, “look!”
Geoffrey, Steven, John and Sherlock were all sat around a small rickety table at the back of The Three Broomsticks, rummaging excitedly through the goody bag of Halloween decorations, costumes, and of course lots of beverages they’d accumulated.
Mrs Holmes entered, holding an annoyingly perfect few dozen mince pies knocked up in less than five minutes.
The box itself was mostly dry apart from the flecks of snow that had evidently clung to it on it’s journey.
“A Slytherin? Well, let’s see how friendly you are next Saturday. First quidditch match, John. You ready?” Sarah persisted, in spite of John’s apparent fit of giggles.
Of course, as soon as the last first year student (a floppy haired Slytherin boy called Archie) slid his bottom down onto the edge of the Slytherin table, what came gleefully from McGonagall’s smiling mouth was music to their ears…
“Who’s us, though?” John asked finally. Sherlock frowned, “No I mean- you’re the only person to notice this, Sherlock, to know how the flames moved, to have found these things… So if they want attention it seems that they want it from-”
“If I ever bake,” Sherlock said coolly, flicking his wand quickly, causing the pastry to tremble a little in the air
John stood up as if he’d been asleep for days, slinging his bag on with as much muster as a mountain troll taking a leisurely stroll. “I’ll see you back in the common room,” he yawned “Save me an armchair.”
“Anyone else?” She continued, pulling her spectacles up to her eyes from where they hung about her neck.
It was to his surprise then, you can imagine, when two vaguely familiar faces, and a third he didn't really acknowledge, appeared at the door to his compartment. It was the sandy-haired boy from Diagon Alley, whispering quickly to his dark haired friend, who was whispering quickly back. They were pushing and shoving each other silently towards the door.
“You’re both hopeless. Go! Wrap up!” Mrs Holmes chuckled, swatting him with her teatowel, “Oh, John-”
Once both had collapsed into the warmth of the entrance hall, John’s eyes fell warmly on the lanky figure that stood before him; cloak hung limp around his shoulders, heavy under the rainfall, and his curls of hair stuck flat to his forehead. His nose and cheeks were pink from cold, and his entire body was quivering.  It was rather endearing, not that John would admit that, of course. John quickly broke his gaze, once cleverly realising he must look just as drenched and dishevelled as his companion, and instead set about tidying his hair, running a few fingers through his fringe and smoothing it down at the back.
“Not how you imagined Christmas Eve,” John murmured sadly, taking it with a trembling hand. He looked at the floor, sniffling, “I’m so sorry.”
“You want to go first?” John said, stretching, as Mrs Holmes fired two towels at them with a swish of her wand.
The feast was magnificent. Steaming cauldrons of pumpkin soup stood tall across the four tables, baskets of every sweet and treat you could imagine littered the tables. Halloween themed crackers were scattered here and there, offering either a trick or a treat once pulled- to John's amusement, when he pulled one with Greg he won a glistening toffee apple, but Greg in turn got a dung bomb to the face
He made the logical decision to continue his journey to the far end of the hall with face angled down. This did result in him seeing only the bottoms of black trouser legs and the grubby soles of people’s shoes, the spilt and disregarded bits of food and the surprising amount of dropped cutlery, the cracked and time-worn slabs below his own pointed, immaculate shoes…
John paused, glancing up the many stairs where he knew Greg was probably sitting pestering Molly’s friends, and anyone who’d listen, about how to get to know her.
“Fighting, Professor. Behind the greenhouses. I saw them from my classroom, house points are to be taken from Slytherin and,” Sholto shot a disgruntled look towards Greg and John “… and my own house.”
John slithered into his sheets fuzzily, pulling them tight up to his chin. As soon as his head hit the pillow, his vision started to spin slightly.
It was true. Excluding those Sherlock could physically see poking out of people’s pockets, careless, he could spot at least another twelve judging by the imprints in people’s cloaks, or how they anxiously gripped their hands inside them.
“I can’t do Magnussen first lesson. I can’t cope…” mumbled Greg, flicking out a lazy arm and pulling the mug towards him. “I’ll nut him if he even comes near my cauldron… with them drippy hands of his…”
“You’ll send us into the dark forest for an hour, leave us wander about a bit, deduct a few house points, and not question the fact we managed to obtain pictures of a corpse?”
By the time dinner time was drawing in, and the group of them headed off to the great hall, Sherlock bid them goodnight and turned to go. John grabbed his arm.
He longed for them both to be back at Hogwarts, where she couldn't do all this shit... Alas, John knew she would still find ways... She always did.
The ghosts flew in and around the tables, giving first years a scare, and the school choir sang proudly to open all the festivities. Suits of armour walked regimentally around the place, bats circled and swooped from the hall's highest corners over the tables, and John was fairly certain he caught professor McGonagall bobbing an apple on the high table.
He unfastened the parcel, lifted Billie onto his perch, checked to see if there was food (there was) and was about to throw the parcel carelessly onto his desk when intrigue got the better of him. Sitting down on his windowsill, in the moonlight he swore the string binding the parcel looked familiar?
Greg was the first to arrive and, as John was quite an infrequent user of the floo-network, he couldn’t pretend that he didn’t jump a foot into the air when his best friend smashed into Sherlock’s living room with a rucksack and a puff of smoke. John had wondered why Sherlock had moved the coffee table a few inches backwards before setting up the nibbles; Greg would have cleared them out completely otherwise.
“When’s your next lesson?” John asked, trying to keep the conversation on anything but Sebastian-bollocking-Wilkes and his smarmy sidekick.
His friend looked far too small to be about to start his seventh year. There was a running joke, which John was very much bored of, in which John was half Goblin. It wasn’t a great help to John that when the three went to Gringotts together before the start of their second year, the Goblin who took them to their vaults wasn’t a great deal smaller than little Watson, and John found it very difficult taking out his money when all he could hear was two giggling idiots behind him muttering “Gobbbliiin” at random intervals.
His house had no such rule that shoes should be removed, but nonetheless some guests may, understandably for the need of comfort, wish to remove their shoes, but some may wish to keep them on for the exact purpose. Will shoe people panic when they see sock people? Will sock people feel awkward and informal? And what would he and John decide on?
Sherlock stirred, eyelashes flickering against his cheeks. John stayed still, hand clasping his wrist. He stared at him.
He turned to John, who was now sporting a comically large and long fake moustache. Sherlock sniggered.
And with contented sighs, Sherlock a little unsteady due to the earlier turmoil beginning to hit his body, the two stood up to go. As they approached the doors out of the Great Hall, closest to the Slytherin table, John tugged at Sherlock’s robes to go quicker.
It was Molly, bounding towards them from the path they’d just come down, waving excitedly. John liked Molly, it was just Greg in her presence that annoyed him, was all.
Ooof. He clattered to the pavement with a painful thump. However, the fall wasn’t as… hard? as he’d expected? He opened his eyes slowly, the sound of laughter from an individual close by, and saw he was lying on top of a relatively short individual, with that sandy coloured hair that gets mistaken for both blonde and brown, who’s head was lying on the cool stone cobbles outside Fortescue’s.
His mind suddenly darted to the letter he’d received the night before, and how furiously impatient he was to solve it.
Also, I am very aware I haven't posted in ages, school's been very demanding but I will try to post chapter 8 and possibly 9 over the next week or so. Again, I am so sorry :') I know I'm not very good at this...
John blinked, and a tear escaped him. He looked up at his friend, who’d been fidgeting where he stood.
“Cases. You know. ‘My handbag’s trying to eat my cat’, ‘My husband’s gone missing’, or you know ‘My uncle’s been murdered! Solve it! Please!’ you get the idea.” Sherlock spoke with confidence, but John could tell there was a hint of anxiousness in his voice, a slight reddening in his cheeks. “It’s just a- just a little… hobby. Okay?”
“Might’ve stopped him bombarding me with so many owls- think it through next time,” he quipped, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He paused, “Thank you.”
“These photos – here - show the man to have a bruised neck and throat, as well as slight bruises around the nose, suggesting straight away that this was not suicide-”
“So so far we have Mike Stamford, Molly Hooper, Greg Lestrade, your sister Harry, and Stephen Bainbridge?”
Their laughter filled the living room, accompanied with the sound of the fire cracking behind them, with Mr and Mrs Holmes stirring and chopping and chattering from the kitchen, and Mycroft’s turning of the pages of the Daily Prophet, and his mumbling of how “The Christmas issue is always completely useless”
Sherlock, judging from earlier experience, decided not to press the matter, but noted it all the same.
but he could feel his heart beating faster and faster the longer he felt Sebastian's breath down his neck.
John and Graham started to sing along heartily, but Sherlock… Sherlock eye’s were filtering through as many faces as he could, trying to find who he knew to be coming, who was no longer there. Sherlock was, unexpectedly, on a case
Very uncoordinatedly, Sherlock fell into the dormitory, dropping Jim’s case at least twice, before lying it upon the freshly made up bed three away from his. Thankfully, Anderson only seemed to stir slightly, and everyone else continued snoring away.
“So you sneak down here to smoke, but refuse to litter?” John joked, trying to cheer him up, “pick and choose your rebellions then?”
Sherlock listened again. Only the sound of the distant group of students could be heard, still scaring themselves silly.
It was John, hand clasped tight around the door handle, glaring at Mycroft, the softness of his expression completely gone from his face.
The Saturday morning came, and Sherlock got dressed, obviously having planned his outfit the night before, and came down to breakfast swiftly, only being called a freak a few times before leaving the common room.
“Well, I’ve examined both sets of string, from bonfire and this package, down to their very fibres, and they are indeed identical, so that makes that definite, at least, even though I already knew that.”
As he was paying, which took longer than it should have as John was quite out of practice with muggle banknotes, the lady complimented him upon his scarf.
Sherlock took hold of John’s carving hand, without really noticing, and began steering it across the pumpkin’s surface.
Sherlock’s mind wandered back to the pocket of his robes on his bedpost where that letter harbouring his new case resided, begging for a reply.
“He found out I had a double-free this afternoon. So of course told Hagrid I’d love to help him,” Sherlock frowned slightly, “he collared me earlier… he was so thankful… couldn’t say no really.”
They got up with a grunt and started up the cobbled path, their feet crunching on the mass of leaves beneath them, eventually leading them past the very small office of the DLE of the village. Sherlock glared at it as they walked past.
Anderson wasn’t in the dormitory yet, which was an added bonus as Sherlock would have rather thrown himself off the astronomy tower than see Phillip’s ugly birdlike face before bedtime.
“Erm, I leant over my cauldron while I was brewing some ‘Dragon Dung Fertiliser’ to help my Herbology Teacher. My tie... well it now doesn’t look or smell too good so-”
“What riveting conversation. I’m so glad John’s staying with us,” Mycroft droned, waltzing into the kitchen. Judging by the yelp that followed either their mother or father had hit him with a newspaper.
Sherlock could feel his brothers intruding gaze searching the two of them, could feel the judgement and opinions he was forming within the first thirty seconds of seeing him. He hated it. All he wanted to do was to disappear before he could stick his overly large nose into something… but of course that was made impossible by the excited footsteps of his mother running down the stairs.
John bolted upright, which proved not to be the best idea, as the last time he’d stood was before having drank quite a substantial amount of firewhisky. Having steadied himself, he saw Harry, lying in the centre of the common room, sobbing hysterically.
He knew it worked on wizarding film, and even muggle film… but he’d only read a few times out of many that it worked on a physical photograph itself, and when he’d thought up the idea in theory, it seemed the easiest thing in the world… but now, as he was holding the photograph between some tongs above the near boiling liquid… he was starting to cold feet.
“You called?” Sherlock was leaning carelessly against the wall directly opposite the classroom entrance. John was taken a back, but surged forward confidently, clenching his fists as he walked,
The Gryffindor seeker was now diving to the ground, the Slytherin’s close, but not close enough. Sherlock found himself cheering with the rest of them, as the two of them raced for the glistening golden dot in the distance. John, Sherlock could see, was cheering too, whilst defending the chaser’s attempts to get a few more shots in, and defending spectacularly.
Meanwhile, John was having a whale of a time, and by the time eleven o’clock was approaching, Greg was practically legless, which was always entertaining, and no amount of trying was stunting the effects of the giggle water, which was even more entertaining. Mike and he had dragged Greg’s hysterical, limp self to the stairs to give him somewhere quiet, at which time John realised he himself wasn’t the soberest of wizards. By the time they reached the bottom step, all three of them were giggling on them like naughty toddlers.
They dressed, John putting on his new cardigan over a burgundy t-shirt, and Sherlock, to John’s delight, continued to wear his new jumper. He looked lovely in it, he really did - John was impressed with himself - it brought out the green flecks in his eyes and made him-
He played an old carol, something folksy and gentle. As they watched, Mrs Holmes entwined her hand in her husband’s. John felt a lump form in his throat. Sherlock’s eyes fell on him, and a small smile tugged at his lips. John smiled back, though knew embarrassingly that his eyes were damp. The playing continued, Sherlock moving effortless between carols. It was beautiful.
"I'm sorry... J-J-John..." Harry said, drowsily, the potion quickly beginning to take effect, as she lowered herself shakily onto her bed. "I... I-I reeeaally... am... John..." and with that her eyelids closed slowly, and she was out. Her brother gazed at her sadly, her t-shirt stained, her hair a mess, her makeup smudged around her eyes... After a few minutes, he pulled his and Harry's packed trunks out of the wardrobe ready for the morning, made sure he'd got all his uniform in his backpack, blew out the candles, and clambered up onto his top bunk. He lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the muffled angry shrieks from Mrs Turner next door. And as they grew silent, and the minutes passing became hours, and the room grew so much darker, he began to wish he'd taken some of the sleeping draught too.
At this, the entire Gryffindor team, and many of the supporters, threw John into the air in triumph. John begged to be put down as they began bobbing him about, but he looked almost illuminated with joy, eyes sparkling and head thrown back with laughter. Sherlock smiled up at him.
As the week dragged on, Sherlock found he somehow saw very little of Jim around the grounds or the common room, or even the dorm. He knew himself to be somewhat of a recluse but this seemed a bit excessive, really. Any meetings they did have seemed standard enough, and yet… Sherlock didn’t know. Perhaps it was the fact he’d become quite friendly with Anderson, thus by default Sebastian. However Sherlock was quite sure, judging by the size of this Jim person, he’d be able to defend himself if he ever felt the need to ruin his life like the rest of them.
“Yeah,” John said, staring at him as a nipping wind whipped round, causing his curls to quiver and Sherlock to shiver, pulling the cuffs of his jumper tight into his palms, “Yeah I bet it is.”
Mrs Holmes gave him a gentle smile, clasping his arm “You’re the only person he’s really mentioned as of yet, love.”
Sherlock moved swiftly over to him and snatched it. He pondered it for a moment, as John began scrawling the letter to ‘Mr C. Powers’ himself.
Not knowing when “normal people” deemed acceptable to rise for the first meal of the day, he decided to sit and wait for the other members of his dormitory to toddle off, and he would follow, and hopefully that would meet John’s breakfasting standards.
Sherlock stood there, a bit awkwardly, suddenly very aware of the colour of his scarf. McGonagall spotted him.
His heart was beating fast, his brain moving even faster. He daren’t hope that this was an actual one, an actual case…
However, all this sudden burst of light and wonderment that bled through the castle so hatefully, Sherlock had to admit he wasn’t entirely glad that John seemed to be absent of such silliness. John had come down to breakfast on the first few December mornings with that increasingly familiar, worrying look upon his face Sherlock had noticed that day on the train months before. Eyes sunken, frown fixed, gaze distant… Sherlock had an inkling why. Harry had the same demeanour.
He may very much have been mistaken, but this year he did have a rabble of kind and… well… not uninteresting… acquaintances. And John had called him his friend, hadn’t he? And John was very interesting.
It seemed that with each person coming into the lounge the alcohol content in the house grew and grew. That was until Harry arrived, who nearly bowled John over when she saw him, handing him instead a large bottle of spiced pumpkin juice.
“Ah, Mr Watson, Mr Lestrade… Fighting already? Only, few, five minutes into the first lesson of term? Twenty points from Gryffin- Gregory put Mr Hope down!” Greg reluctantly let go of Andrew’s collar, and lowered himself back into his seat, fuming. John began drumming his fingers on the table heavily. Harry looked over at him nervously, but John didn’t meet her gaze.
“Well, Billie is part of the family, John,” Sherlock said, hopping down off of the fence and holding his arm out to welcome the owl, “It’s right that he is on the walk too.”
Again, another nod. Sherlock walked forwards onto the level stone path, swerving a little but righting himself quickly, left hand and sock still clutched to his nose.
“Right,” John said, rising, “I’m just gonna pop out, won’t be long," he stammered, checking his wallet was still in his jeans from the other day, “Fresh air.”
Sherlock didn’t know where to go after leaving the dungeons. But it’d felt so good; shoving his perfectly completed potion into Magz’ cold face and storming out of the classroom... but where now? It was nearing break time, which meant the remainder of his potions class would be leaving soon... meaning Sebastian Wilkes would be leaving soon... so Sherlock’s first logical move was to transport himself as far away from the dungeons as possible within the next ten minutes. After gliding through the empty corridors, having to slow to a walk every time he passed an open classroom door, he arrived in the entrance hall. He was met with Filch, the caretaker, mopping the floors, whimpering with each muddy footprint he lay his eyes upon. This meant one thing to Sherlock. Rain. Sherlock’s glance darted to the window and yes, it was indeed pouring it down. Rain meant there were less places for Sherlock to hide himself, only having within the castle walls as his sanctuary. (It was out of the question to risk getting his freshly ironed robes, his new shoes and his freshly-washed curls soaked) So where? His original plan was to linger around the womping willow until the end of break, then he was scot free; Anderson, Seb and Andrew all had Herbology for lessons three and four. With that, the bell tower rang out for 11 o’clock, end of the lesson, so once again, Sherlock bolted up the marble staircase, skipping the third step from the top (as it was Thursday) and continuing down the long corridor leading to the library. Once it was in sight, he slowed his pace, and the doors around him opened. Students spilled across the floors stalling him to a stop.
As the hour drew to a close, John started to get very hungry. It was nearing half past one and the memory of his sad, stolen piece of toast was waning fast, and still no reply arrived…
The grass was damp from the torrential downpour the night before, leaving deep puddles of mud in the many troughs and contours of the grounds. These were such puddles that Greg enjoyed trapesing through, splashing great amounts of mud all over the bottom of his jeans and, to his dismay, John’s in many cases, before the four of them had even been outside for five minutes.
“Sherlock!” he called, heading to the corridor quickly, pushing past Mike and the pretty blonde he’d been sitting by, “Sher-”
John found Sherlock’s lack of enthusiasm bothersome, yet thought it best to only rant about one thing for the time being.
“But I want to,” He said urgently, “I picked up a few things today while I was out, so you don’t need to worry about ingredients- it has to be vegetarian, though, but…”
Another chapter down! Hazar! I'm going to continue to update asap! Thanks for reading, are you enjoying it? I really hope so... x
Soon enough, the time for chanting, counting and holding champagne readily had arrived. Mike, Molly and Mary stood excitedly, arms linked together. The room full of guests were united, the music had been paused, someone had written a timer in the air in sparks with their wand, which was now fizzing at the edges readily as it ticked down to only two minutes remaining. The back door to Sherlock’s garden was open, and a handful of guests were ready to release their filibuster fireworks, and Mycroft was not-so-sound asleep in bed.
“They’re clean, don’t worry” He added, before instructing Sherlock to pinch his nose, and hold the sock to catch the great deal of blood that was oozing from it, “Good.”
Playing into John’s hand, the three of them turned at once, only to be met with a stunning-charm to the face: they stared at him blankly for a second, then slouched to the grass gormlessly, revealing the poor victim they’d been plaguing for who knows how long.
John tried to conceal the smile forming at the corners of his mouth. Sherlock, noticing, cleared his throat.
Although not in the most comfortable of positions, at least Sherlock could see the subtle elegance that was the September sunset… upside down… whilst fighting desperately not to inhale blood too often.
After a few minutes, John dragged his hands from his face and let out a long sigh. Sherlock edged closer, and passed him the glass of water from the table.
Before he knew it, Mrs Holmes was hugging them all goodnight, and John was up the stairs into Sherlock’s bedroom and wrapped in a thick duvet. The clock read five minutes past ten, and even Sherlock was snuggled up on the floor beside him, the candles fading to darkness with a small pop. Perhaps you do get an early night on Christmas eve, afterall.
“Grah-? Oh! It’s, erm, it’s Greg, and yeah... He doesn’t like to admit to it but it’s so obvious. Liked her since she joined the school. She’s in your year, right?”
"Sure yeah, let's get a seat away from the front so we don't get stuck with the bloody first years... See you later.... Greg." Mike answered, a sly smirk seeping up his pink face, as Molly and he rushed off to the Hufflepuff table.
“If I come across one more puddle of mud in these corridors, I’ll be taking students to the Forbidden Forest myself!”
John had found in a very short amount of time that Sherlock was chippier when he was stuck on something -
Greg and Mike had come bustling in, but quickly shut up when they felt the tension in that small space.
Sherlock did try and circulate, though; that is what a good host does. However, John had told him in private to be on his best behaviour, so Sherlock tried to keep the deducing of guests to a minimum. Although he did find it rather difficult to not tell a friend of Bainbridge that the new jumper he was wearing, evidently knitted by his grandmother, had in fact initially had gone to, and even been worn by, said Grandmother’s lover, and had been re-gifted at the last minute.
John took in a sharp breath, and he held it. It was surprisingly useful when trying not to yell in a practically silent classroom.
John then watched intently as Sherlock pulled a long thin letter opener from his robes, giving it a swift wipe on his sleeve before using it,
John moved quickly out of the living room and up the stairs. Sherlock slipped over to the Christmas tree and tucked his little parcel somewhere unassuming behind, by his deductions, three wrapped pairs of socks, a bottle of firewhisky in a very unimaginative bag, two new sets of phials, and one very large book that everyone in the family bar father would have already read at least twice.
“Ah yes,” Sherlock said, glumly, “Let’s go and investigate that murder that turned out to be a fraud.”
“Heads of houses are probably going to do a sweep soon,” John said tiredly, looking up to the grandfather clock, “as they obviously know we’d be having a party tonight…”
"Sherlock." he said, a subtle sadness in that he had no title or interesting information to put after it. “Well, you seem like a good flyer.”
“What d’you think?” Graham was wearing what appeared to be a blood-stained ruff around his neck, which was spinning gently. “Am I Nearly-Headless-Nick yet?”
"Thanks, by the way," Mike added breathlessly, fumbling in his pockets to check he hadn't dropped anything in his panic, "Where's Greg?"
"I’m fine Greg. Okay? I'm... I'm great." and that was that, the three sat in silence listening only to the clickity clack of the carriage on the path, and the chatter from carriages behind and in front.
He snuck inside, and was relieved to see it was empty, apart from a few students who weren’t particularly nice to Sherlock, but didn’t outwardly want to destroy him, sitting on the sofa lazily, giggling hysterically and hiccupping every four seconds.
And, after stuffing four of the loaves into his pockets and a gentle wave, he trudged off in the direction of the greenhouses, whistling happily.
"Took the words right out of my mouth." Greg chipped in, leaning across John to look at her. She was very pretty, with choppy, bright orange hair that stopped just below her ears, making her look remarkably like a pixie. Greg had had a minor crush on her in their 4th year when Molly started dating a fellow Hufflepuff, Tom. This was marginally odd as Harry, no matter how you dressed it up, was just "John with breasts and ginger", as Mike pointed out, and this image ended Greg's interest in her very quickly.
But before John could question ‘right about what teapot?’ Sherlock was on to the next letter. This one was lengthy, with four or five photographs pinned to the bottom. Sherlock’s eyes widened, a grin stretching up one side of his face. Intently, John surveyed as Sherlock pulled a delicate piece of black ribbon from yet another pocket of his robes and, using his letter opener, pierced it through the top of what was now his fourth letter.
“Someone’s taken my gloves!” Carl whined, “I had them in my pocket at the bonfire and they’re gone.”
“We can just summon it down? Pass me my wand,” John chuckled, as Sherlock hopped onto his tiptoes, using John’s forearm as a support.
John, having changed back into his jeans and after a hearty sing-along of the school song in the  changing rooms, left them positively floating. Greg had met Mike and was now waiting outside for him, still chanting “roar-roar-Gryffindor” with a voice now nearly gone.
“You didn’t sleep well at all last night, and haven’t for a while judging by the bags under your eyes, you seem sensible enough so I can assume you weren’t out partying the night before school begins, that’s a terrible idea, so probably worrying about something. Worrying about what though? Maybe everything; your tie is from a second hand shop and your clothes are at least two years old judging by the fabric and the fit so you don’t have a lot of money to buy new ones frequently. Money trouble keeps many up at night. When your friends were in here they asked you about a “Harry”, you mentioned how she was in another compartment so she goes to Hogwarts. I’d say girlfriend but you’d probably sit with her, so sister it is. You dismissed the topic of your sister quickly, and yes you aren’t sitting together – bad relationship. Your stomach has rumbled fourteen times since you got to this compartment, but the food trolley’s gone past and you still haven’t got anything, but didn’t ask your friends for any either. Again money troubles - but you wish to keep it hidden from them. Your shirt is badly ironed, probably done it yourself - showing lack of parental figure or carer. As I was boarding the train I saw you and your sister arrive on the platform without accompaniment, and when Gareth mentioned he was homesick you looked very uncomfortable – you don’t enjoy your home life and probably won’t be going home for Christmas, however the lack of sensitivity by Gareth means he doesn’t know how you feel about it, so you are closed off about your private life.”
“I’m just thankful, Mr Holmes, you decided to tell me,” Sherlock beamed at her falsely, McGonagall continued “knowing of course I will no longer let you carry on with this… investigation”
Sherlock’s face broke into a thrilled smile, and before John knew it, the two of them were running back up the hill in direction of the Owlery.
Madam Pomfrey sighed warily and led Sherlock to the nearest, neatly folded, empty bed. John trotted after them, glancing interestedly at the few other students tucked up in crisp linens.
Sherlock looked gingerly up at John, who suddenly caught on to what was happening, and waited until he’d span around, before quickly unbuttoning his shirt. Madam Pomfrey supplied him with a fresh one from her cabinet, which was a tad too big.
“You make a fair argument, there,,” he replied coolly, “But will I have to wear a ridiculous costume?”
“And-” Sherlock sat up, running a hand erratically through his curls, “the aconite was planted, it’s dampened state meaning-”
Sherlock enjoyed being out in the grounds out at night - it often meant slipping out of his four poster under fear of death and having to find the correlation between certain snores of his roommates and how deep their sleep was, but once he was out of the dungeons and, more importantly, out of the castle, he felt more at ease than any other time at Hogwarts. That evening, having nursed his sore nose in some dark corner of the library before heading off to bed, he felt the need to investigate the courtyard.
The first lesson was theory, in which the class copied down ‘Golpalott’s Third Law’ and the reasoning behind it, idly scribbling down names and dates and potion ingredients here there and everywhere - it was beginning to resemble one of Professor Bin’s lessons…
Towards the end of the evening, nearing 10 o’clock, as John was sinking deeper into his armchair, Sarah decided to pop over.
Sherlock nodded earnestly in the direction of the doorway. John, without hesitation, exploded into a fit of giggles, which Sherlock didn’t know whether to question or be concerned about.
It was John, a bit sweaty, his nose pink from the cold, hair slightly dishevelled from the wind. Sherlock, bizarrely, felt suddenly very exposed.
Sherlock planned out his path out of the kitchen, and hoped his legs would follow. They… sort of did. He pushed through some people,
Sherlock didn’t really hear, feeling like John was speaking to him from under water, but he did his best to nod and allow John to pull him upright.
“Turns out I deleted how to bake, mummy," Sherlock said, matter-of-factly, which he was quite proud of considering his mother could be a fiery woman when she wanted to be.
“So why didn’t they explode?” John asked, peering at them worryingly, as if they were about to explode any moment, “You said the fire got close to them, shouldn't we all be horribly burned by now?”
“Why the hell are we even doing this now, at - what half an hour before midnight? On New Years Eve?”
He crept oh so slowly over the dust covered floorboards, each step forcing an aroma of old chalk and dampened oak up into the air with an ear-wrenching creak.
John crept over; he’d never had an owl of his own, although both he and Harry had always wanted one. Obviously they’d become second nature to him living at Hogwarts for years, but it did mean he saw them more as a practicality than a pet, thus treaded with caution.
Sherlock thought best to slip away whilst Mycroft squirmed away from his father’s affections, grabbing John by the sleeve and pulling him all the way out of the kitchen, up the stairs and onto the landing, an action to which John willingly obliged. It had become a common occurrence, it seemed. John following wherever he led.
Sherlock huffed, and it seemed to move his whole body, “My socks aren’t organised, John,” he whined, like an overtired toddler, “I keep trying, but they. Won’t. Organise.” `
“I wouldn’t mind at all,” she said after a moment, beaming, “I was hoping he’d go somewhere, bless him, I’m off to Clara’s…” she bit her tongue eagerly, “Him going to yours is perfect.”
“Where’d you want to go in Hogsmeade, then?” John asked excitedly, walking briskly a few steps behind Sherlock as the two of them left Alchemy.
After a brief, heavy silence between the three of them, in which Greg looked a bizarre mixture of guilty and intrigued, John forced a chuckle;
After a few minutes complete commotion, in which Sherlock was quite sure many students assumed this to be part of the spectacular, and fired some filibusters off for good measure, the bonfire managed to calm itself down, and to Hagrid’s disappointment, was actually smaller than it had been originally.
Sherlock opened his eyes, the distant light ghosting through the curtains catching them in the shadows. He stared back.
John looked down and there was Sherlock, sat comfortably on the floor twiddling his wand through his fingers.
“See. You’re distracting me.” John said bitterly after a three minute long struggle with his potion, forcing it to turn orange again. Sherlock didn’t say anything, and just removed his potion from the heat, which was a rather alarming shade of pink, and began dropping salamander blood into it (of course, in intervals of three)
John rarely got post, there was no one really to write to him who he didn’t see every day anyway, unless of course it was from-
After a few minutes’ brisk walk down steadily steeper terrain, the two of them entered one of the clearings opening onto the black lake, glistening a dark teal in the September sunlight.
The following fortnight slugged along as the opening weeks of term often did, and subtle clues began emerging, signalling autumn was just around the corner. On the most recent mornings, earlier rising students were met with a chilling mist that settled throughout the grounds, causing many to begin bundling up on their way to breakfast. Alas, the milder weather had been returning by lunchtime, so many students were confused as what to wear, making frequent stops back at dormitories throughout the course of the day to dump their cloaks and jumpers.
The conversation's duration had reached 32 minutes, and Sherlock had now progressed to reading the back cover of his book, when finally he decided to chime into the chatter, if only slightly.
“Well,” McGonagall sat herself down behind her desk, eyes fiery “No. You won’t. But if I find out this was something you two made up for fun…”
When Sherlock finally arrived on the scene, later than usual, John could see the pure panic in his eyes at this array of determined-looking-people in scarlet and gold robes. John merely gave him an awkward sort of nod and gestured for him to sit down opposite.
Hiya, I know it has been absolutely ages since I've updated I am so so sorry! This term at school has been so hectic, exams have been flying around everywhere... But I am back now! I will be updating more often (I know that isn't hard... it's been like two months...) but hurray! I've missed it here :')
Sherlock, after ensuring the now dishevelled stacks of letters were stuffed deep inside his cloak- don’t want that ink to run- gave a worrying nod to the wash of grounds that lay ahead of them,
As they entered the office, a tall, stocky, grumpy looking wizard with a glistening silver badge pinned to his navy blue robes, glared at them.
– and slipped on his freshly polished shoes, which looked to anyone else identical to his uniform pair. Of course to Sherlock they were barely comparable. Pulling a small hand mirror from his drawer he looked into it, ruffled his curls three times, gave a gentle sigh at his beautifully bruised eye socket, and slid it into his back pocket. He then grabbed his wand from the nightstand, also sliding it into his back-pocket, before hopping from the bed and heading off to breakfast.
Mrs Holmes adored her book of “Muggle festive traditions to be avoided at all costs - from Valentine’s Day to Christmas” that Sherlock had selected, and Mr Holmes enjoyed his one-day-a-year Christmas tie, which Sherlock was always asked to get and always loathed to buy, this year’s rendition being a bright green fluffy disaster with pompoms that glowed depending on how much alcohol you’d consumed. Even Mycroft’s sour face lightened when he opened his jade leather-bound journal with 'MH' printed on it.
“Sit down, you spoon,” John laughed, and after a moment or two’s pause murmured, “Where’s Sherl gone?”
John was taken aback, “Apology accepted.” The expression that crossed Sherlock’s face hurt John; he looked so shocked, so flawed at John forgiving him… “Its fine, Sherlock. It’s all fine, I swear.” John said more forcefully. “But actually, I was wondering how you did it? How you knew that? How you know everything apparently” John said with a slight laugh.
Sherlock sat in the back compartment on the right hand side every time he rode the train, and had sat alone ever since Mycroft finished his seventh year. He preferred this (Mycroft was unfathomably irritating). It rarely bothered him that other students would come to the back in search of a seat, spot him, and scuttle away again. He was so used to it now, it had become almost tradition, a lovely way to be reminded of his lack of companionship at the start of a new term. Though of course, he really didn't mind. Honest.
Soon enough, it was December 23rd, or “Christmas eve eve” as John and Harry used to call it. Sherlock sneered at this (
As the crowd broke into applause at the teacher's efforts, Sherlock’s eyes pierced through every student he could see, and that’s when he saw it; at the back of all the laughing and cheering, the back of hooded figure, was skulking away into the smoky evening.
John had stopped looking at Sherlock long before he’d finished his little speech. He was now staring at the floor… he looked defeated.
“Excuse me, erm, do you have any Gryffindor ties please?” John said politely in between breaths: He and Greg had to fight their way through the commotion outside the shop: twin girls who were obviously first-years-to-be, with confused muggle parents.
“Oh for God’s sake…” Sherlock whispered, wrenching open the window and allowing the dainty black owl to hop inside. He nipped him.
“You realise that whole… thing… probably took more effort than maybe, you know, just poking your head out the door and yelling-”
They continued their little stroll about the grounds, Mike moaning about the amount of Herbology homework he’d received, Greg talking wistfully about the probability of him ending up working for a house-elf the way his grades were going, all chatter to which Sherlock was saying very little. Glancing at him to check he was alright, John noticed that, although listening, he was looking at, well, everything else. There was a concentration in his eyes that flared up whenever a group or student or teacher passed them, his eyes flitting back and forth ever so subtly, squinting, as if he were reading something very fast, studying. From what he’d learned about Sherlock in the very short amount of time they’d known one another, it wasn’t that this surprised John, but intrigued him to how one person seemed to see so much.
“Yes, well. The smoking only affects me, really…” he said flatly, putting the full little tin back in the bag, “Besides, Carl doesn’t want to be swimming through my ash, now does he.”
“Holmes. Here, if you can carry your big head this far.” Sherlock obliged reluctantly, his cheeks flushing slightly pink when he realised who he was sitting by. “Continue.”
“Nowhere whatsoever,” He leapt up onto the windowsill, drawing his knees up under his chin, “Write to Carl. Ask him whether he himself has any ideas on who would steal from him- All we can do until we’re back at that hateful school.”
"I'm gonna punch his fat face" Greg said flatly, sulkily dropping himself down at the Gryffindor table.
So quickly, he leapt onto his four poster, bouncing lightly on the freshly pressed green sheets, and drew its curtains. With a sigh of relief he flopped back onto his pillow heavily, allowing his eyes to gently close.
“I bet they’ve thrown those bloody pictures away,” John said one day, wrapped up in his scarf, seated by the lake where only weeks before they’d been trying to solve the now irritatingly “fake” case.
“Don’t even think about it.” John snapped, as the pool of tea began wipe itself up “You want to be an auror right?” Greg groaned in reply. “Right, so you need five NEWTs, at least, to even be considered… You are only taking six bloody subjects anyway, and let’s not pretend you’re currently passing Charms or Herbology. You are absolutely bombing Potions, I get it but Magnussen might have done you a favour here mate. You need it.” John barked, pulling Greg back down into the seat beside him. “Now eat your toast.”
When the pastry decided to descend upon John, sticking to his face, hair and eyelashes, he somewhat regretted not just letting Sherlock continue with his ridiculous experiment.
John slid in beside him, mouthing apologies at the Professor before rummaging about for scraps of parchment and a quill.
“You remember the password right?” John whispered to Sherlock, as they reached the top of the staircase leading to Gryffindor tower.
John nodded to the stone seat beside him, and Sherlock obliged. Sherlock smelled very heavily of tobacco.
John’s stomach gave a tremendous growl in reply, so quickly, before they vanished and were replaced by a magnificent array of deserts, John filled two steaming bowls of vegetable broth from the nearest, nearly empty, pot; one for himself and one for Sherlock.
“Oi-” Hagrid had suddenly appeared on the steps of his hut and thrown them a grubby looking towel, “That’s not what I’m paying you for, is it now?” he said cheerfully, raising his bushy eyebrows, but clearly smiling through his beard.
“Sherlock, love, don’t lean on the wall - the threads will begin to pull! Why are you wearing it anyway?” She pecked, pulling him forward and beginning to busily brush him down with a large peacock quill she’d produced from her jade cloak, slung over her arm. “I took mine off long ago, like every other sensible person...”
Sherlock’s face lit up, he scooped up his letters and shoved them into his robes, leaving the letter clutched excitedly in his hand. He looked about him, as if afraid someone would listen in.
“Come on, let’s go to the library,” John muttered through gritted teeth, and off they went, leaving Sherlock alone in the corridor with Sebastian.
“-the loops in her ‘L’s and her ‘E’s; rigid and narrow; She was gripping her quill tightly. She’s tense, she’s rushing-”
“No- Christmas!” Sherlock gave himself a little shake, “Would you mind if I asked John to stay with me over the holiday?”
So sorry this is SOOOO late... by that I mean six months late... I'm finally free from college and exams and revision and all that gross stuff and on holiday now until September! So I promise updates will get actually more frequent, and I'm not just saying that this time... Thanks for still reading after such a long break!
“Good luck!” John called pleasantly, a bit dazed, “You going to try-outs as well, Mike?” he asked astounded, as Mike started to follow them,
“Then try to struggle all the way to the end… little brother!” Mycroft, followed by his parents reached the wall, and slapped a long spindly hand onto his brother’s shoulder, “Finished shopping have we?”
“Thanks! The first match this year is against Slytherin I think, so I guess you won’t be cheering me on there,” John said with a smile, turning slightly pink.
John was sat at the Gryffindor table, Greg beside him, with what must of been the entirety of the Gryffindor quidditch team surrounding him. They very much respected John as a captain, looked to him for guidance, for tactics, for ways to “make Sebastian Wilkes cry”, but all John really wanted to do that morning was have a dozen cups of tea and a piece of toast.
Suddenly very excited indeed, he moved to the further two points of flame contact, and yet again found two pouches identical in size, tied with the same jade string. Once Sherlock had all three, he pulled off his gloves and daintily prodded them with his fingers. Damp?
After dinner, when the two of them ran up to Sherlock’s room to get into their pyjamas, John had a thought.
"H-Hellooo! HOW ARE-" John quickly rammed a sock from his pocket into his twin's mouth, and dragged her into the kitchen.
John had a very normal evening. Dinner was nice, the conversation was enjoyable… but a very off feeling swept over him afterwards, as it sometimes did. This was a feeling the others around him understood, somewhat, and as always they left him too it. Greg didn’t try to make conversation as they climbed the stairs to the common room, he didn’t make John come up to the dormitory when he got tired, he didn’t press John to sleep when all others went to bed. He hated how normal it was, now.
“Watson, seeing as you're much more inclined to chat with Mr Holmes than listen to me, what was the name for the remedy to cure all disease and all life indefinitely?”
When Friday rolled around, November the fifth, it was time for their annual bonfire praising the wizards who’d helped foil the gunpowder plot. Sherlock and John watched intently from the clock tower as Hagrid constructed the thing, sprinkling twigs and kindling, heaving logs and what looked like old bits of furniture from his hut, big enough to build the entire monstrosity all on its own. It was really quite a sight to see, it was just a pity John was too preoccupied to notice.
“Fine,” He said, softening. John beamed. “But as soon as third years start pretending to be drunk after a couple of Butterbeers I’m done.”
“No I have not fallen over, I’m fine!” Sherlock eased himself up and looked at John, almost fearfully, “Thank you. You didn’t have to do that.”
“I will hit you. And it will hurt.” Greg said gruffly, inches away from John’s face, then quickly snapped back into his seat when John pointed out his ice-cream was melting.
"Set up what? Mummy’s laid out a spread to feed a small village of overtly hungry goblins, and the decorations look perfect now that I’ve seen to them, so relax.”
After a short inhale Sherlock said “One trip to Zonko’s lasting less than fifteen minutes. Then to Scrivenshaft’s quill shop to restore some dignity and buy things of actual use. If anything catches my fancy, perhaps to Galdrag’s wizard wear, and before we can relax to Dervish and Banges; I need some new phials.”
Sherlock was still looking at him. John could see it in the corner of his eye but he kept his gaze on Mrs Holmes, excitedly fussing about the place, opening curtains and tapping her wand at the fireplace and the Christmas tree, her presence bringing light to the room. “Oh, go and get Mikey will you Sherlock?”
He finally gave in, and climbed in between his sheets about half past two. Greg stirred and said a gruff,
“Fine, yeah. I feel like I’ve barely seen you, recently,” She said, rather awkwardly, “Barely spoken to you…”
“They’re not the same colour” Mycroft and his brother snapped in unison, to which their father reacted by flopping into the nearest purple, sorry lilac, squashy arm chair.
. He slid open his curtains and felt around under his bed for his trunk. His heart was pounding… He wasn’t afraid of the boys, he really wasn’t… but he just didn’t want them to catch him up in the middle of the night…
Billie hopped onto Sherlock’s forearm excitedly and, as Sherlock stood up steadily, launched himself into the air. Sherlock watched him go, soaring contently, until the tiny black dot had disappeared completely into the drifting cloud that framed the murky green hills so beautifully. He had no more business in residing in the Owlery, and there was still a dampness in the breeze that whipped the back of his neck where he stood, but he didn’t know where to go otherwise. However, as the wind gave a howling detour right up the left sleeve of his cloak, he knew it was only best to just to go and barricade himself in his dormitory, but only after checking there was enough food and water for Billie when he returned.
Finally, however, the last practice exams drew to a close (and John only thought he'd completely failed half of them, so things weren't so bad frankly) and with them, November did too. On it's waning days, a buzz began to brew around the castle. The kitchens got busier, Hagrid was spotted selecting pine trees to decorate every corner of the castle, and families were sending parcels of sweets and chocolates to get students through the cold weeks of advent.
Sherlock just made the ground-breaking decision to go back to the robe shop and punch Mycroft right in his hoity face when a cold, pompous voice came from behind him. Sherlock’s throat went dry.
“He’s twenty-four, has a nose three times too large for his face, thinks he’s going to be Minister of Magic one day, has far too much interest in my life, and probably knows exactly who you are already…” Sherlock spat bitterly, “Oh and he’s a rubbish big brother.”
John looked rather embarrassed at Mrs Holmes handing him five presents for him alone. He opened a large selection of chocolate frogs, a thick notebook tied shut with a lovely burgundy ribbon and accompanied with a selection of inks and quills, a book titled “Crimes Related to the Dark Arts, a collection of case notes written by Aurors throughout history” which Sherlock was very jealous of, a selection of thick woollen socks in various colours and patterns, and finally, which judging by John’s expression was his favourite, an oversized cream cardigan with large wooden buttons which was very very soft, and thankfully much less ugly than John’s usual choice in knitwear.
“You okay?” John said, smirking slightly at the small rising flour that emanated from his jumper when Sherlock released it.
“I need to identify the specific particles in that water- what vegetation its been near, or run through. Obviously by the looks of it it's just old rain water, but looks can be deceiving and as we know this has been planted here- There’s also something- something flaring up in the solution, something irregular- something- that needs investigation. And
Greg, after a few moment of thought, nodded. “Thanks, Sherlock!” he slapped him on the back, “Maybe it’s time we had a beer!”  and as Greg started rummaging through his bag to reveal a hefty amount of butterbeers, Sherlock mouthed John a thousand thank yous.
“I, erm, I realised that last night I didn’t really ask before showing you them, I’m sort of… used to it by now,” He said softly, “I apologise.”
Sherlock barely said a word, and ate even less than he did normally, which was quite impressive, pushing food around with his fork seemingly for the joy of doing it, barely two forkfuls making it up to his mouth.
A tall, thin boy of nearly 17, with a mop of untidy black hair atop his head, was leaning against the wall that separated Diagon Alley from ‘The Leaky Cauldron’ and the Muggle world. He was dressed in black jeans, a white shirt, and a long, grey coat with a large collar that grazed the tips of his ears whenever he put it up (which was always). This made passing wizards and witches stare, as it was a considerably warm morning. He pulled a long, slender wand from his pocket, and began twiddling it between his fingers irritably. It was fairly plain to the uninterested eye, however to anyone who looked closely, they would see it was covered from tip to handle in hundreds of tiny calved skulls. The handle itself was shaped to resemble what looked like a Hungarian Horntail’s tail tip. However, to anyone who didn’t know the markings and details of such dragons, often annoyed the wand’s beholder by saying “Ooh! Isn’t that a nice spiky bit?”
“Look – I only let him help on little ones, you know around the castle… Missing pets and belongings and things- What?” he said, rolling his eyes.
“We were home for Christmas,” he exhaled, “A nice, normal Christmas. You remember what it was like- How bad it was with… with you-know-who-”
It was an invitation, but clearly for some sort of peace offering more than anything else. Mycroft refused it, bidding his mother goodnight and skulking out the room and up the stairs.
It’d started to rain; a relentless, persistent, filthy kind of downpour which had already transformed the majority of the grounds ahead into a slippery slope. The embers burning outside Hagrid’s seemed long extinguished, and the torches welded to the grand doors in the distance were flickering and dancing violently, fighting desperately to stay alight.  Upon reaching the archway out onto the grounds, both pulled up the long hoods of their cloaks snuggly above their heads.
Sherlock huffed, “It better be warm with brandy cream,” and pushed himself up from the sofa, and trudged out through the archway into the kitchen, smirking at John before he retreated into the hallway.
“No- Here now-” Sherlock reached up his second arm, lacing his fingers around the jar, causing John to grab hold of his waist for support. John swallowed.
John swigged his tea, he gave his head once last rinse under the water, before bundling out of the bath. He dried himself quickly, and pulled on his pyjamas complete and dressing gown, and headed down the landing to the bedroom.
“See, that’s better! Watson, I’ll wash your sock and Quidditch trousers in with the shirt.” She said cheerily, helping Sherlock up and slipping his cloak on around him. “And I must say, you did tie a fantastic bandage.”
“From what you’re holding there, Mol, I’m guessing… you didn’t get it?” John said, cheekily, Molly gave him a little shove with the golden robes, “I’m kidding! Well done!”
. His mother simply cupped his handsome face in her hands, kissed his forehead maternally and that was that. Even that took effort, Sherlock fidgeting irritably to get away even though the moment lasted but a few seconds. His father just waved from afar. Sherlock had no reason to bother with two goodbyes.
The Gryffindor crowd erupted, screaming at the top of their lungs and waving their flags above their heads. In all the commotion, however, John looked away for a mere moment, and Sebastian saw his opportunity. Seb flew at him and, quaffle in hand, threw it hard at John’s chest and knocked him into the metal goal post, scoring a goal in the process. John, disoriented, started to slip from his broom, and Sherlock’s heart leapt into his throat.
“Right! Everyone!” Steven yelled, opening a large chest that sat behind one of the squashy red sofas, “Costume lucky dip! Come on!”
“We have searched every residence, asked every household. No one knows these people, has seen these people, no one has been reported missing, the woman who has written to you does not exis-”
Sherlock nodded, and just as he was beginning a lengthy plot in how to remove Magnussen from the castle without trace, a smirk split across his face. He’d found his hiding place.
“Ah don’t worry, rather ruin a pair of socks then you suffer severe blood loss from the face,” John said, smirking “Not as bad as I thought, though,” He added, examining him closer “I imagined you coming down this morning with half you face purple.”
“Is it? If you’re going to lie, you’ve got to commit, surely. Slytherin did it last year, carried their brooms around in protective cases, remember? Yeah they were just their normal brooms, but a bit polished up. And they won, so,” He retorted, before taking a large sip of coffee,
Before long, a complete and utter brawl had commenced, and both were clambering breathlessly over pumpkins, hiding behind pumpkins, and of course were covered in pumpkin itself.
“The murderer entered the house, how? We don’t know. The man was found in his bed, which suggests he was asleep when the attack occurred. The Incarcerous hex was performed, and the murderer…”
Many had started to head up to bed, now, and the common room was nearly empty; Steven was dozing on the sofa, an over-sized witches hat on his head, an arm wrapped around a pumpkin he’d carved appallingly, and Gary was eating an apple from the basin happily, leaning against the wall. Mike had left long ago, and only about five others were still up and dancing.
“No, not at all. But she will kill me if we are having this- well this party- and she learned of its existence and that she wasn’t to attend.”
Sherlock looked at him, concentrating, as if this was something he too was only questioning now. John felt like he was being examined. Sherlock then smiled warmly.
“He’s in the shed,” Mycroft murmured, as if it was the most taxing thing in the world, without glancing up from his paper, “He’s told us to tell you you’re not to go in there.”
“Right, you can be on your-” She stepped back, glaring at his shirt. “Well you can’t go to dinner like that, you’ve got blood all over you. Now – take that off”
“Right,” John was still full of sleep and, to be quite honest was not overly sure what was happening, “This means?”
Knowing perhaps a handful of the piles and piles of guests in the Holmes’ cottage, Sherlock stayed practically attached to John’s side. In fact, Sherlock didn’t want to… deduce anything… as was usually his forte, but they
The first Quidditch practise had arrived, and John practically flew there in excitement, sprinting as fast as his short legs could carry him to the pitch, broom in hand, as the clock struck four that afternoon. As soon as he’d stepped foot onto the sandy earthing, he threw his bags down and that was that, he was off. Kicking off hard, he bolted upwards into the cool evening air, doing so for the first time in months. He breathed deeply, inhaling the feeling of pure freedom into his lungs.
“Why do you just- just.” John shook his head irritably, “Why do you just say things? I mean, I’d never spoken to you, really, before yesterday and you’ve already blurted random facts about me about ten times-”
“They’re not bows. And they mean quite a lot, in fact,” Sherlock snapped, pulling one from his pockets, “Aconite heated lightly, then ground into a fine powder becomes highly flammable. Practically gunpowder - whoever did this seems to have a theatrical touch, doing so on November the fifth…”
John waved in response, before watching amusingly as that mop of dark curls, that towered above the heads’ of the swarm of first years, travelled on its way. Sighing defeated, however, as Sherlock turned down the corner at the end of the corridor, John felt a nagging sense of guilt growing in his stomach.
“Why was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher fired?” Mrs Holmes, who was in a mauve top hat, read from her joke paper.
There was a family around him, humming happily, beaming at each other from across the room, cuddling up close and dozing together. This was a proper Christmas, a Christmas he hadn’t had for five years.
And she and Greg started to walk towards the Quidditch pitch, seemingly in pursuit of the Ravenclaw team.
Sherlock swallowed, and approached him, his hand outstretched. The boy laced his fingers into his, and shook it firmly. Sherlock couldn’t muster up his usual strength of handshake, however.
"Ever heard of a prank, boy?” he circled round from behind the desk, “What I want to know is, did you do this?”
Sherlock merely shook his head and moved his hand from John’s shoulder, instead wrapping his arm around his friend's back.
The whistle was blown, and the players took their positions in the sky, John and Sebastian hovering face to face, the quaffle between them.
“Oh most definitely,” John replied immediately, smirking, “Last year there was just a big box, and whatever you pulled out of it was what you had to wear.”
“In the photos” John piped up, “I didn’t get a good look or anything, but the marks were all over him, right?” John asked, intrigued, “So that makes sense, right?”
And Sherlock agreed wholeheartedly; he’d been writhed with boredom all summer with the only newspaper clippings pinned to his wall being “lost doormat known to spontaneously combust; if found, keep it” and “my teapot is shrinking, I’ve not had a brew for three weeks”. His parents had gotten sick of finding him setting their weekly newspaper on fire, or leaving it to dissolve in his most-recent potion.
“I went for the drizzle, thanks for asking” said Mycroft, lowering himself reluctantly into the chair besides Sherlock. “Looks like you’ve been buying too”
And she didn’t, but continued reeling of dates and, judging by Sherlock’s groans, mispronouncing alchemist’s names.
Mr Holmes hummed in agreement, taking a bite out of his mince pie. John smiled understandingly and took a bite himself.
She lurched forward into the group, and was all of a sudden in between Sherlock and John, holding the sleeve of Sherlock’s robes.
“Sorry” John said once in the entrance hall, “But if I’d seen Seb sitting there I’d have had to go and punch him… And I really can’t be bothered right now”
“My god, you’re here!” came a girl’s voice. Suddenly, two hands were clasping Sherlock’s shoulders, and John wasn’t sure if he should get ready to fight someone or not, “Thought I’d never see the day, Sherlock!”
Before he could even open the doors to his mind-palace, his eyes were forced open again by large gasps from the crowd.
“-With people you don’t know?” Sherlock continued louder, “whilst you’re not only absent, but in another country.”
“Bless, its little Sherlock’s first party,” she teased, elbowing him hard as they walked into the hall “look who’s growing up.”
“Defence Against the Dark Arts first, I know.” Sherlock began pouring himself a coffee from the steaming pot in the middle of the table.
John left quickly (a few of the people in the surrounding beds were giggling) and stepped out into the corridor. He expected he’d have to go and find Sherlock, as he’d probably legged it back to his common room or something, but he was pleasantly surprised.
“I thought she was at Ravenclaw? With Clara?” John asked sternly, to one of her friends. She looked about her, awkwardly. John sighed, “Take her to bed?”
When he looked up, however, he felt peculiar. He looked about him, the tall bookcases laden with dust and cobwebs, aching under the weight of it all, and had the oddest feeling that he was being watched by someone. He glanced about him. The floorboards creaked from somewhere near.
The matter of actually asking John whether he’d want to come to the Holmes household for Christmas didn’t actually occur until the Sunday before the Friday on which they left for the Christmas holiday.
The wall had opened but only a few inches when Sherlock slid through it. He bolted passed the coolly lit fire and jade green armchairs of Slytherin Tower, and up the spiral staircases, not even pausing to survey the new first years whispering excitedly on the snakeskin rug.
With a sigh of relief, he pulled at a slightly crumpled parchment bag and thrust it in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock opened it and pulled out the Slytherin hat he'd bought two weeks ago that day, still in its wrappings. He tried, he really did, to say thank you, but for some reason he couldn't explain, his voice didn't want to work. Instead, he nodded in the direction of his own trunk below John's feet. John understood and slid it out towards him. Sherlock opened it, and there on the very top was John's tie. John snatched it, beaming, and began examining it carefully.
When they got downstairs, Sherlock with his violin in hand, Mrs Holmes practically wept, and poured everyone a glass of mulled wine as Sherlock positioned himself in front of the fire. He stood with great precision, back impeccably straight and eyes focused, which was a funny sight considering he was wearing baggy flannel pyjamas and Christmas socks. He cleared his throat, and everyone, even Mycroft, quietened.
Sherlock was sat on the damp steps of the Owlery: the rain had ceased now, yet mud and puddles were scattered everywhere.
Over the next few days, neither spoke of the incident, nor did Sherlock’s parents to John’s severe relief, as he was pretty certain they’d have heard… but John could see Sherlock acting rather tentatively around him, especially in the mornings, or if John even so much as stirred in the night. Sherlock would respond almost instantly, and it made a pang of guilt run through John’s chest, when John would rise routinely to get a glass of water, or pop to loo, Sherlock would wake too. John couldn’t pretend, however, that the steady whisper of breath that clipped through the murky darkness from Sherlock’s lips didn’t act as a comfort, whether John required it or not. It was a funny feeling, a closeness John would never have expected… but there it was.
“We studied together! We studied together! I don’t know why you weren’t here but-” the boy gave John’s right arm a forceful squeeze “thank you!”
Sherlock, looking over the top of his book, felt the corners of his lips twitch into a subtle smirk. Without warning, the roundest of the three, who'd been hiding behind his two friends, was thrown into the compartment. Sherlock recoiled slightly, pushing his back hard against the damp window. The boy smiled awkwardly, and down he sat, and the other two followed suit. Sherlock's eyes flicked across each of them one by one...
“I never guess, they were just very ugly sofa cushions, but once they were torn open the culprit was obvious.”
“Have a nice summer?” Came a voice opposite John. It was a thin mousy haired witch, blushing slightly as she spoke.
“Well then, have fun with him, John!” Irene winked again, at John this time, before slinking off up the cobblestone path.
“You’re staring” Sherlock said quietly, swinging the now empty mug around his finger by the handle, whilst Greg and Mike continued their conversation ahead.
“Yep.” Sherlock’s pupils were now aimed at the ceiling. “Those four beams are made of alder wood, yet the rest of them are made from aspen.”
The year was drawing to a close and the pages of Sherlock’s bedroom calendar tore themselves away for the last few times… but Sherlock was unaware of the passage of time entirely. He flitted between bedroom to shed, shed to bedroom, John wafting coffee cups and mugs of tea under his nose every hour or so, and forcing him to go bed when, by the 28th, Sherlock hadn’t so much as had a five minute doze. (Sherlock had stropped rather ceremoniously, before falling asleep within mere moments of being pulled from his desk in his jeans and new green jumper without even getting under the covers.) John liked the hours in the shed much less, which was where their base was when a new experiment was required to begin before the many on the surface of Sherlock’s dresser had finished. He could see his breath wafting up in front of him and had to jump from foot to foot to stop himself from freezing to death while Sherlock compared the fibres of leaves and of dirt clods with shivering hands. Thankfully, for the whole Holmes family’s safety, the experiment’s results weren’t groundbreaking, but were... something. Enough to keep Sherlock tearing his curls out, at least.
Cloak wrapped snugly round him and wand grasped tightly in hand, he stepped out into the bitter cold November night, to where a pile of charcoal and a sprinkling of ash now lingered from the bonfire the night before. This didn’t matter, however. He’d sussed out the remains of that that morning and it was that useless now.
“Oh don’t worry, it’ll be in the papers now. I can revel in complaining about everything the DLE get wrong," Sherlock scoffed, “And anyway, I’ve got the reply from the client to wait for. I’ll be fine.”
Settling down on the bank that was being lapped by the lake’s surface, John was finally able to talk about all Sherlock had introduced to him the night before, however Sherlock beat him to it;
“Why are you up here, anyway?” John said, sitting down beside him, which his increasingly wobbly body thanked him for.
Awkwardly, the two of them slipped out of the classroom, trying to ignore the sneers of some of their fellow students, and were met with a stony faced headmistress.
"Wait! Wait- I have got it- hang- bugger where is it... See, we picked up the wrong bags, remember?" John said, socks and other various objects of his flying about the compartment.
Sherlock was sitting cross-legged in a fresh pair of pyjamas and a burgundy silken dressing gown, his hair still damp, dripping at the tips, draping in untamed curls across his forehead and the nape of his neck.
“Oh it is just a well-known fact about salamander blood; unless told otherwise you add it in intervals of three drops.” John looked up at him, literally, (he was a good few inches taller than him, which was embarrassing as Sherlock was the younger one) whilst stirring his potion aimlessly, not knowing if he should be impressed or pissed off. “… And it says on the previous page - Your potion, John.” Sherlock finished, smiling slightly as John’s eyes flicked quickly back to his potion stopped his stirring abruptly and began to curse repeatedly under his breath. The potion passed its orange stage and had begun to turn green again…
“Ooh!” he said suddenly, startling Sherlock a little who sloshed a drop off tea onto the table, which dried itself instantly, “It’s Hogsmeade this weekend! First one!”
answers back to), some letters from his brother that he immediately ignored, a few from Mummy, to which Sherlock replied out of habit, but nothing of real importance.
When he looked underneath the tree itself he froze; there was a parcel with Greg’s handwriting addressed to Sherlock… and John hadn’t even gotten Sherlock anything yet. Not for want of trying - he’d spotted a few things around the village shops when Sherlock had shown him round, and in Hogsmeade for that matter, but Sherlock was impossible to get rid of, and did not seem to catch on to the subtlety of John wanting him to wait outside. That and there was the minor issue of whether Sherlock would do presents himself, which was completely fine, John wasn’t much for gifts, but he wouldn’t want him to feel guilty or embarrassed about it.
John passed it huffily to Sherlock, who skimmed over it before tying a small piece of string around it that he plucked from his pocket. He then handed it to Billie, alongside the idle message to his mother.
Madam Pomfrey ambled up to Sherlock as he entered her quarters without any air of panic or concern, like she was used to the thing. John loitered behind, not really knowing where to stand.
“I’m gonna use that,” John said, raising his eyebrows “Or, you know, use a flask?” he added, giving Sherlock a little nudge,
John’s footsteps followed, more cautiously. Once out in the corridor he asked, rather nervously, “What do we do?”
The match ended in a rush with the score two hundred and thirty points to forty, and John looked positively giddy with it. He flew over to the seeker, along with the rest of the team, and gave her an enormous hug.
Recently, she only wrote to question John and Harry’s living arrangements after the end of the school year, saying “You’re welcome at my home as long as you like, but I’d really like to know your plans for the future as soon as possible” in every letter she’d written. This was no exception.
Sherlock, still giggling, found his gaze falling on the far end of the hall, where Clara and Harry were sat very close, hands linked tightly, and beaming at each other. Sherlock couldn’t help but beam too.
Evidently, Sherlock had struggled to such a ridiculous degree to remember Greg’s name, that the top half of the card was taken up by now unreadable scrawls of varying names beginning with the letter G, each scribbled out in frustration.
He took a wary step forward, yet they matched his move, the both of them filling the narrow corridor completely. Sherlock, anxiety climbing, thought quickly as the two backed him into the jagged brick,
After a few minutes harmless chatter, however, John noticed Sherlock’s focus shifted to the Slytherin table.
They continued their awkward, yet joyful conversation for the remainder of the feast. John was worried at first Greg would embarrass him, but thankfully he was elbow deep in a steak and ale pie and failed to notice.
It was very nearly dark when Sherlock stepped into the cottage again. John’s present was carefully sealed in a parchment envelope, a very thin red ribbon tied neatly around it, hidden and inside his cloak so as to avoid any scrutiny, mainly from his brother.
Steven nodded, patting Sherlock on the back hard, and went over to a bedraggled record player that sat precariously on one of the tables, “Make yourself at home! You like
“They’re little pumpkin loaves, really,” Hagrid said proudly, putting the tray down next to the both of them, “Right, better be off- gotta go and harvest the smaller ones.”
“Yeah, didn’t think you’d be up for that again,” John laughed, “It’s for the common room, for later.”
As he passed the courtyard, he spotted the first flurries of sparks and smoke rising from the bonfire, spitting and spluttering.
Somehow, and John honestly had no clue how they managed it, he and the Holmes family managed to demolish the troll-sized Christmas pudding, complete with brandy cream, custard, ice cream, the works, within less than an hour of eating dinner. Someone was still passing him chocolates, Bertie Bott’s, fudge… No wonder both Mycroft and Mr Holmes were snoring in the armchairs. That and the gallons of mulled alcohol, of any kind, and sherry and wine and whisky they’d all been drinking since lunchtime.
“Hm, suit yourself,” John said, tapping his wand on the stove to ignite it, “It’s basically potion making… you’re an expert at that.”
The four of them sat there for a few minutes, until Sherlock’s nose decided to stop running. It had only been two punches from Sebastian, no stamping on his face, or anywhere else for that matter, but that didn’t make it much better.
“Steven’s already eighteen,” John said, turning to Sherlock eagerly, and after a moment’s pause, “you should come!”
“But Sherlock I just hope you’re okay, it looks so painful!” she continued, reaching her hand to his face.
“The left one is thunder grey and the right one is slighter lighter - drizzle,” Sherlock added quickly, in attempt to diffuse the tension between Mycroft and his mother. “The trouble is that Mycroft has both a thunder and drizzle coloured set of robes, and he is trying to envision himself prancing into the Ministry, and is unsure what shade will impress them. Brother mine, we have been here for 17 minutes – If you work for the Ministry, they will not care what robes you’re wearing…”
John reached the foot of the first grand staircase leading out of the entrance hall, ready to climb all the way to Gryffindor tower before he realised. Sherlock stood timidly by the Great Hall doors, looking about him nervously, obviously becoming more and more conscious of the marks upon his face.
John and Sherlock were left giggling, both slightly awe struck by that whole endeavour, half way down the hill.
“We were just going to head to the feast? Greg is about, he just refused to step into the library on Halloween… or a weekend, so-”
“A lot can happen in a minute John. Hey- who’s this handsome thing?” Harry said, dropping onto the bench next to him. John, who’d just happened to have taken a large swig of tea, choked.
Hagrid, rather ceremoniously, got the fire well and truly going once the students had cramped themselves into and around the courtyard, keeping within a ten foot radius of the bonfire of course. Flames of a deep amber swirled up into the air, the sparks dancing high above them. The students let out the appropriate “oohs” and “aahs” as the flames turned to crimson, then emerald, then a magnificent royal blue.
Eventually, with some help from the very nice, very normal, lady, John came across the perfect one. Well, he thought so anyway. It was a dark green cable knit one, thick enough, but very very soft. Sherlock was a lot slighter than John, but John got him quite a baggy one anyway.
“Exactly,” He exhaled deeply, slowing down now, “But. The ropes remain on a victim after the spell is administered; it’s why it’s so effective as a way of capture or…” Sherlock swallowed, “-torture.”
“I drown him out a lot of the time- Billie will find him. Thank you, Billie,” and Billie flew off into the.wintry grey morning.
and with December 23rd brought waking up at lunchtime, met with a frantic Mrs Holmes casting cleaning spells top to toe in their little cottage for the arrival of her eldest son.
“You’re the guest…” Sherlock murmured, sulkily, picking his wand up and twiddling it between his fingers.
Having been at Hogwarts almost seven years now, he knew that it would be merely some troublesome third years or something, or first years in a muddle. He’d have thought this then too, if it wasn’t for a sudden wail, echoing across the near-empty grounds.
The Ravenclaw Quidditch team were also out and about, heading in high spirits in the direction of the pitch, broomsticks in hand, and chattering brightly to one another. John eyed them closely.
Sherlock hummed in response, looking worryingly at the thick coating of mud on his trousers and shoes.
John stared at him, and edged slightly closer, so they were touching shoulder to thigh where they sat.
The three of them moved through the crowd to a small table next to an uninhabited armchair, and John pulled a small flask from his robes, and poured some into one of the self-cleaning party cups Greg had bought the day before. He then poured one for Greg, and then looked to Sherlock.
“Er, Sherlock” John said hesitantly, giving a nod to the group at the chatting at the edge of the water,
“Yeah- cool yeah, great,” John got up with a stretch, “But if you’re clearly the ‘target’, you won’t mind me going to get some breakfast, then.”
To anyone mischievously out and about the grounds at midnight that Saturday, Sherlock would have looked relatively… bizzare. However, to him, his actions made complete sense.
“Okay,” John fidgeted. He’d never thrown a house party before. Well, not to be morbid but he’d never had a house, not a real house, to throw one in. “Shall we put the fire out?”
As the sun began to sink lazily, casting thick shadows of the tall hoops and seats across the lawn, and the bell tower echoed along the early-evening breeze, the Gryffindor team, now sweaty but contented, trudged back up to the castle in time for a well-deserved meal. Being captain, it was John’s job to return the rather hefty case of Quidditch gear after changing roughly back into his robes. This meant, although John rarely minded, that he was always slightly later to the feast after training than the others. He needn’t worry, however, Greg never went near John’s “rabbit food” as he so called it, also known as his meatless meal.
, he sprinted off to the dungeons before most of the other students had even finished their second piece of toast.
“Diminuendo” he said, and it gradually shrunk until he pulled his hand away, leaving it no bigger than a galleon. He then pocketed it.
Sherlock clambered out of the kitchen and pushed passed a few bodies on the bottom of the stairs, and scaled his staircase.
“Stop apologising. I mean, yeah maybe insulting my parents the first time we actually talked wasn’t the best move.”
“Morning Harry,” John said bitterly, not turning to look at her “And, for the record, I’m a minute younger than you-”
A wide grin was desperate to spread across John’s face, which he fought to retain control of. He pulled his parchment towards him.
“Me? Not yet,” He said, chuckling, “I’m having a whole night of it tonight and tomorrow with the first years – only the smaller ones, o’course. Glad to see you’re giving this one a hand, mind,” he nodded to Sherlock, “Now only do as many as you can manage.”
He wasn’t wrong earlier, either, Mycroft was definitely surveying him the entire time, honing in on anything he said, especially when he spoke to Sherlock. He didn't like it. There’d been many occasions when John was acutely aware that Sherlock was doing a similar thing… reading him… but Sherlock’s gaze… felt different, felt interested, merely curious, and John had grown not to mind it… But Mycroft’s felt intrusive, judging almost.
John and Greg sat at the back of the potions class, their cauldrons were set up, John’s book open (Greg had forgotten his) and there they were, waiting for Professor Magnussen to arrive. In front of them was Sebastian Wilkes and his friend Andrew Hope. John was less than impressed…
“Yeah, Sherlock seems to like all of them,” John murmured, staring at the quill quivering eagerly on the notepad between them, “I suppose we should add Clara, she’s my sister’s-” he paused, before clearing his throat, “her erm, her- her girl...friend.”
His heart was beating fast. His brain wasn’t quite sure what he was going to do but he was moving. He pushed past those around him, trying to get to the door.
As they sat and waited, Sherlock pulled his wand from his jeans, and pointed it at the discarded mug in his hand.
Sherlock started to talk while still sipping the last mouthfuls of his first butterbeer, which proved fatal.
This bold endeavour to concentrate at two o’clock on their first day back, whilst well aware his best friend was most likely asleep somewhere, the late summer sun blazing through the window for the first time that day, was obstructed by the curly-haired sixth year to his left. Sherlock was drumming slowly upon his weighty stack of parchment, his slender fingers tapping and tapping rhythmically to a tune unknown to John. It wasn’t overly noisy, creating only a dull thud every sixth beat or so, but each tap of his fingertips nagged at him. He could see it in the corner of his vision, see the lack of notes being made and the fact his quill was not even in the ink pot. It was with a specific pound of his thumb that John turned to him,
Mrs Holmes plonked herself down in Sherlock’s vacant spot. She didn’t mention the throw that still covered John’s legs, or the deep grooves that remained in the sofa back, which did not require the mind of any of the Holmes’ to deduce that they had slept there.
“I can assume your parents are neglectful?” Sherlock said quietly. He didn’t intend to say it I assure you, but he did. It just fell out of his mouth. And he regretted it. John lifted his head slowly, his jaw clenched.
She relocated to the living room, past where Sherlock watched from the doorway as John familiarised himself with the stove, the whereabouts of utensils, and began peeling and chopping the various vegetables on the surface. To Sherlock’s amusement, he used a combination of both wand and knife-work to do so.
Sherlock merely nodded and, after pulling his torn jumper off over his head, followed John down the many stairs, and out into the grounds.
Somehow he found himself in the sitting room in complete darkness. His face, his hands, and his legs were shaking.
“Is there a problem, Mr Watson?” Borage said, voice brittle, giving him the aura of someone about to crumble to dust before their very eyes, “There’s a seat beside Mr Holmes I believe!”
“You don’t need to thank me, you git,” John replied, laughing, but his eyes remained fixed on the sofa cushions.
The hall started to clear, plates cleared themselves miraculously from the tables, and they all began yawning, eyelids growing heavy, conversation becoming sluggish and sleepy.
John took off his red and gold scarf and placed it casually on top of Sherlock’s Slytherin one, rolled up the sleeves of his robes and started scraping out one of the nearby pumpkins innards. Thankfully Hagrid had kindly sliced the tops off most of them before heading into his hut.
Sherlock continued to watch as John sped back to get his bags from further up the path, after mentioning something about getting his kit. It didn’t take long, he seemed to be eager to help.
He felt quite nervous. He knew barely anyone, and it was a regular occurrence that people who had met him wanted to ignore him entirely or punch him in the face. Which didn’t really bother Sherlock… but he didn’t want to cause a stir, ruin it for John or anything…
Entering the great hall, where the tables were weighed down with biscuits, mugs and teapots for elevenses, John was relieved to see Greg sitting there, staring mournfully at his tea.
As soon as the buckles on his trunk had clicked open, and the boys snores had not ceased, he calmed himself. His pyjamas are always packed on top,
“John. I cannot say I am certain you will win, as judging by the probability of who’s won or lost out of the pair of you over recent years, it pretty much balances out. Although I hate Sebastian, you and him seem to be of a similar standard and to be honest with you I’ve not watched a quidditch game properly for a very long time so I’m not even certain of how you play and-”
Sherlock’s expression dropped immediately, dropping his hand from John’s face, and stepping ever so unsubtly about a metre away from him.
There they remained, the two of them, for the rest of that traditionally festive day, Sherlock distilling and boiling and studying whilst John looked on. He was a very good spectator. Very good. He would give praise when praise was deserved, or even when Sherlock felt it wasn’t, would read up on something if Sherlock asked, would sit silently when he was doing something in need of great concentration. It was here, on this Boxing Day, that Sherlock felt they were really, for want of a better word, a team, which John would probably have thought ridiculous seeing as his main occupation whilst they worked was watching and waiting. But there was something so inherently comforting and supportive and perpetual about his being there.
They sat there happily for another half an hour, chatting casually about the year ahead, how Mike hadn’t written to either of them all holiday so he’d probably forgotten how to use a quill, and predominantly how the two of them had wasted their entire summer.
“Might as well move closer – to the water, I mean,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly, “No point appreciating it from faraway.”
The low mist that settled across the grounds that Sunday morning, with the wind howling through the treetops, the air cold and damp, was perfect for that day. Halloween had arrived at Hogwarts.
“Well, better go – get dry and stuff, you know,” He started to head off out of the clearing, “Oh and Sherlock, just let me know, yeah?”
“Enough Mr Holmes, you will remain in here for the rest of break while I get on with these letters, and not a word out of you. Do you understand?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his brother’s overly perfect handwriting, and scrunched it up into a ball, before returning to staring out of the archway.
“So,” John said, shoving his hands into his cloak for warmth, yet instead finding two soggy pouches of rainwater, “I’ll, er. See you in the morning?”
“Dunno. Maybe I rolled on her cabbages when I tackled Andrew to into the mud?” Greg smirked, admiring the thick brown and green stains that littered his robes “God they’re arseholes.”
“I’m glad you think so; whittled it myself over the summer. Not that mother knew, though. I think she thought it was going to be a boat or something. Seemed quite proud of me.”
“Ah what a subtle way to get rid of me,” Harry said teasingly “She does actually! Isn’t it brilliant when you can get a girlfriend and your brother can’t?” She planted a forceful kiss onto his cheek, before jumping up “See ya guys- see ya Sherlock!”
“Er-wait!” Sherlock said urgently, just as John started to pry open the parchment, “Maybe you- don’t open that… here.”
At about ten o’clock, while circulating, however, Sherlock came across a vaguely familiar looking blonde witch whom Mike had brought along. She was very pretty, hair cropped into a pixie cut and wearing a short blue dress. Sherlock smiled at her politely, yet she completely grabbed him as her greeting.
John was taken a back. He did mind, really. He wanted to grab it and throw it into the lake, with the little tin and all, but how could he? He barely knew Sherlock, after all, a fact that all too quickly he’d forgotten. And anyway, the smoke seemed to be funnelled by an invisible barrier, so it only rose around Sherlock himself…
As the weeks continued, and December became agonisingly close, professors in most classes found it fitting to set “end of first term tests” before the castle got gripped in full Christmas spirit, apparently as to “not detract from festivities once December came”. John understood the premise of this; he definitely didn’t want Christmas to be tainted by exams, but John wasn’t a fan of Christmas anyway, and honestly wished everyone had decided to have the tests a few weeks later.
Sherlock’s mouth fell open slightly, before he gave a tiny nod, “Thank you,” he said, in a gentle voice.
“Anyway, let’s welcome him to Seventh Year potions. I doubt he’ll keep up. Sit!” Magnussen shouted the last word, and Sherlock lowered himself slowly to his desk. “Now, Potions!”
It was Sebastian Wilkes, a wealthy Slytherin boy in the year above. He'd hated Sherlock ever since he'd openly deduced in third year that Seb was snogging Sally Donavon, a Ravenclaw girl of Sherlock and Anderson's year, in the male Quidditch changing rooms every Friday, and that their enthusiasm lead to them breaking off a shower cubicle door... This not only got the both of them a sizeable amount of detentions, but also put a tremendous strain on Sebastian and Philip Anderson’s friendship. (Sally being his girlfriend at the time). Sherlock didn’t mean to tell everyone, it just sort of happened… and God how he wished it hadn’t. Ever since, Sherlock had been branded by that group of students as a “sick pervert” a “teacher’s pet” a “twatfaced paedophile” and a “freak”, which now the majority of the school knew and used. He’d been unpopular from his very first day at Hogwarts School but, because of this one mistake, for the last two years he had been completely invisible to most students, an outcast… And to Seb and Anderson a walking target.
out of lessons for one thing or another; talking back to the professors, refusing to do work he  found “pointless”, conducting experiments in the confines of his four-poster- he was used to it by now, but he was under the impression John was pretty much a golden student.
what sort of headline’s that? Where’s the actual stuff?” Gareth said suddenly, discarding the newspaper he’d been staring down in disgust “An auror’s not been mentioned for months – well, except for that article about how ex-auror Magnus Pickerin had been on bloody holiday to Belgium and lost his soddin’ glasses.” He picked up the nearest coffee pot irritably and began pouring himself a large cup, as the others devolved into laughter, “I’m serious, it’s getting ridiculous!”
He wasn’t a better exam partner, either. As John sat there eagerly scribbling away names and dates or fought to remember how to spell an incantation or what potion ingredient was the most important to a certain antidote, Sherlock was humming. Humming. Just quiet enough so only John and perhaps Greg could hear him. That, or he would write nothing for the first half an hour, before finishing in less than five minutes.
After a pleasant hour or so, in which the floating candles dotted about above them began to melt into bizarre gloopy shapes, the feast had come and gone, the gold satin ribbon had flown from McGonagall’s wand and the school song bellowed at different pitches and rhythms and finally… It was time for bed. No sooner had the phrase “Bed time” vibrated to their ears, John was being pulled by his burgundy hood up into Gryffindor Tower, happy to be home.
And Sherlock, only slightly stumblingly, made his way out into the corridor, and after giving John a gentle wave, crept off into the darkness.
But before John good find out if Sherlock was at wherever he was about to say, an angry yell from two boys behind cut him off –
“The train? I know,” Sherlock said glumly, turning round to face him, “I’m sorry.” His voice was soft, and very quiet. John knew he meant it. “Sometimes, my brain goes faster than I can keep track of and… ironically… I forget to. Well. Think.” Lifting his head to face John directly, “I’m really, really sorry.”
John sighed, shoving the letter into his pocket. He craned his neck to look to Harry, sat down the other end of the table. She clocked him, and waved an identical looking letter in his direction, shrugging.
It was Irene Adler, a tall, slim, very beautiful witch that John was very intimidated by. She perched beside them, her hands wrapping around Sherlock’s shoulders with her long black nails.
They both began sprinting across the glistening cobbled paths, slipping and sliding every time their feet collided with a patch of drenched grass, clinging to the lengths of each other’s cloaks as not to fall face first into the mud - Sherlock was not keen to be doing that again anytime soon. Not twice in one evening, at least. Sherlock could hear John’s laughter intermingled with the sound of the intense pitter-patter of raindrops slamming into the world around them. His hood slipped over his eyes, and he felt John’s cold hand tug him back into the right direction, as they both legged it to the glowing lanterns of the grand double doors, seeking their salvation.
Sherlock had written a letter to the victim as soon as they’d reached the Owlery, inquiring as to why she hadn’t reported the murder, or why it wasn’t in any of the papers. The two of them then sat there, waiting, for almost an hour.
“Come on I was only looking, now why’s it different?” She said smiling, swinging herself down to sit beside him “I’ve got double-”
“Just going to check if this letter’s arrived,” Sherlock said, slightly deflated, “Might as well check, you know.”
“Apparently they’ve got new brooms this term,” he murmured, squinting at the set of blue-robed figures in the distance
The two of them exchanged a nervous smile, before plopping themselves on the sofa again, waiting for someone to arrive.
“And obviously I’d forget that detail if you hadn’t circled it five times with your quill!” Sherlock interrupted sarcastically, finishing his tea off with a large swig, “And anyway, I have one more experiment to set up. We’ll solve it.”
“Fine,” and with that, Sherlock flicked his wand, knocking over the bag of flour onto the work top, erupting a large cloud into the air, “Let’s go then.”
On the morning of New Year’s eve, the two of them sat at the kitchen table, a refreshingly different surrounding, the space warm enough and devoid of cauldrons, microscopes and phials. They read over their findings which John, with help with Mrs Holmes’ enchanted quill, had been jotting down, christening the notebook Mrs Holmes had given him for Christmas.
“They took my cloak.” He said hoarsely, muffled through his hand. “And my wand…” he felt himself flush, ears growing hot.
Sherlock smiled, opened the bag and unwrapped the paper, then carefully lifted out its contents. His mother looked at him, confused. He smiled, as what he was holding was not a green and silver woolly hat at all, but a burgundy and gold, slightly frayed tie.
A sudden thump of pain swelled in the narrow bridge of Sherlock’s nose as he took his first step forward, acting as a helpful but uncomfortable reminder of what was to be now prominent bruising across most of his face…
He watched as Janine’s bouncing brown curls bobbed out of the Hall and towards the staircase where Sebastian, the
Sherlock even seemed to be enjoying himself, John thought. He’d not eaten anything at lunch, but he’d drank a lot of tea, and chimed into the conversation when necessary, which was nice.
It seemed Sherlock pouring him a glass of water was his way of apologising for ignoring him over the past week.
"Harry, I swear to God. I SWEAR to God!" he said in a whisper filled with so much petulance it would have made the largest trolls tremble "You said you'd be home by seven. You SAID you wouldn't be drinking... You lied. TWICE! Do you have ANY idea how worried I've been?!" he was filling a small glass with sleeping draught with one hand, while Harry tried to pull free from his other, unsuccessfully. "Why do you do this? Why do you HAVE to do this, really?" he pulled the sock from her mouth, and sat her down on one of the old wooden chairs, "Drink this." She let out a whine, but John's stare was enough; the draught wasn't nearly as inviting as what his sister had been drinking all night previously, but she did oblige, and did so every time this happened. "Now. Come on. We're all up early." And he slung her thin arm over his right shoulder, and back they went up the creaky oak stairs to their bedroom. On their way, they passed Mrs Turner screeching at a dorm full of boys who'd managed to set three bed sheets on fire.
He remained there for a minute or so, calming himself in the quite of Gargoyles corridor until gentle footsteps approaching brought him back to his senses. It was McGonagall again, but she didn’t look angry this time, concern was painted across her face as she approached him, arm outstretched,
After Sarah left, Sherlock felt the need to thank John… but he was sure this wasn’t the correct way to handle this social interaction. But still…
He stared blankly ahead of him, eyes red-rimmed and weary, but Sherlock could feel his breathing evening out.
He gestured to the drink in his hand. He’d noticed, however, ever since Harry had a… moment, John hadn't drunk anything. Sherlock obviously had, and it was beginning to show.
Sherlock sighed, “It gets very boring in the country. Don’t touch anything until the turkey is carved.”
Muggle Studies was atrocious. Well, it was to Sherlock, anyway. He’d sat next to Janine, who spent most of the lesson fawning over Sebastian, which made for wonderfully awkward conversation. To his surprise, however, the new boy, Jim if he weren’t mistaken, whose bed had been untouched the night before judging by the luggage and robes unmoved from it that morning, was sat at the front of the class. He wasn’t writing, similar to Sherlock, but he was listening, unlike Sherlock, and eagerly so, hands clasped tightly together on the desk, mouth twitching at the corners as the professor lectured to them why muggles were so interesting.
It was very odd being in a muggle shop, something John hadn’t really thought about until that moment. There were no hangers rearranging themselves on the racks, no flowing robes upon said hangers, no candles bobbing up near the ceiling, or helper-owls perched upon the counter having a doze. Just a smiling lady behind a very boring looking desk. His heart clenched slightly.
It was the 31st of August and the sun was only just visible over the houses and shops John could see from his window. He waited, watching the street closely, his heart in his throat.
He ran past 'Ollivander’s', past 'Magical Menagerie' past 'Gringotts', only slowing to avoid the crowd surrounding muggle couple with twin-girls screaming at the Goblins on the steps at the bank. His aim was to speed off to the Leaky Cauldron and wait there for the rest of the Holmes family, but something happened as he crossed the road by the ice-cream parlour delaying his plan...
“Please - seriously, I’m more likely to pass the divination exam this year,” John said glumly, “and I haven’t even opened a single book on it in my li- Oi?”
Greg had gone off to find Mike, who’d forgotten the Gryffindor password, and, in addition to his Hufflepuff scarf, it had caused quite a stir with the Fat Lady. That left John and Sherlock sat on the armchair, John in the chair and Sherlock on the arm.
“Three shots of firewhisky, four shots of Dragon Barrel Brandy, and a medium size glass of Berry Ocky Rot would do that to a boy of his size…” Sherlock stared longer, “However it could also be the combination of four glasses of Berry Ocky Rot, one shot of firewhisky and two shots of Dragon Barrel Brandy.” he said, concentrating.
Dinner went wonderfully, John thought, and all of them seemed to enjoy what he’d made them. Mycroft made no snide comments, and happily mopped three bowls of it up with large knobs of homemade bread Mr Holmes had made the day before. Sherlock polished off six bowls of the stuff, but John wasn’t sure if that was purely to comfort him. Mrs Holmes had even asked for the recipe, which was the real seal of approval.
“It’ll be my last year at Hogwarts soon, Sherl. Better give my punishment while I can - Anderson will make a pig's ear of it without me next year!"
“Alright then,” Sherlock said, in a trusting sort of way, before continuing, “So we have a pre-empted murder, asphyxiation by strangling. Taking all we have currently without seeing the scene itself into account, it has to be the Incarcerous hex, taking place in a house completely locked up magically, no sign of forced entry, while his wife was supposedly at her sisters who, from her letter, has no reason to be viewed as guilty. She’s irrelevant.”
John made an agreeing sort of sound: Potions was hell, but John was good at it – in spite of what Magnussen told him – He always received high marks in the exams, and got an O in his OWLs at the end of fifth year. He would have dropped it at NEWT level if he hadn’t needed it. He also was told by his head of House, Sholto, to take Alchemy, which is seen to be one of the most difficult subjects to do. Then there was Greg: He loathed potions, and Magnussen knew this. It should be stated that Greg was terrible at potions. However, Greg openly slagging off the subject meant that although barely scraping a pass at his OWLs, Magnussen pulled some strings and forced him to take it at higher level, as punishment for being disruptive.
John started to peel it open, and Sherlock averted his gaze, focusing instead on the garishly patterned rug beneath their feet.
John looked at him, puzzled, “I was thinking we could go for a wander? Then to The Broomsticks?” He said, confused, “Unless you want to go-”
Eating the broth itself was found to be somewhat difficult; Sherlock was right handed, and although no-longer broken, his wrist was still very painful when put to use. This meant, to Sherlock’s increasing annoyance, he had to use his left. By the end, he’d spilt more of the watery meal onto the table top than he’d actually ingested, and was beginning to feel really quite cross about it.
The two of them stared at one another from across the living room. John shoved some kind of oddly materialed sack behind his back, and Sherlock clutched at his cloak, just in case.
By the sound Sherlock made, you’d have thought John had actually hurt Sherlock in some way, elbowing John out the way and giving his head such a shake as to displace the flour that he completely forgot about the circle of pastry bobbing so gleefully above their heads.
He folded his neatly trimmed square of parchment into a diamond and handed it to the small Black owl seated beside him.
Sherlock’s interest spiked. He unwrapped the string quickly but carefully in order to keep it as intact as possible, before lifting the lid of the box. The box was velvet. He fumbled around inside, before feeling something woollen.
“Tutor me,” Mike burst out suddenly, grabbing Sherlock’s arm, “In my class none of us know anything. At all. Magnussen just sits at the front and laughs – he kept me behind three hours the other day because my potion solidified and crawled off – I swear I was following the recipe –”
However, even he couldn’t deny there was a certain energy to the party, the sound of some old wizarding band he’d barely heard of blasting from the record player, intermingled with snatches of conversations, laughter blaring, and the hilarious giggling hiccups that were emerging from all of his friends as they drank shot after shot of giggle water was information he was happy to retain.
John recalled their findings of “Carl’s glove water” as he’d titled the sheet of parchment, listing the various species of pondweed they’d found traces of, two of which a variety specifically found in the north of Scotland, which placed it in and around Hogwarts, which although entirely obvious, as Sherlock pointed out, they also found the traces of said pondweed on the pouches from the bonfire.
John’s mouth twitched, “You realise, when you were at school, you said you’d do anything to leave… and now you’re here you’re saying that you-”
“I can honestly say you were definitely not” Sherlock said coolly, and the three of them laughed. Sherlock tried to conceal how good that felt, “At this rate it sounds like I’ll be tutoring all of you?”
“He’s in the year below” John added, looking at Sherlock with a facial expression of ‘Shit I’m really sorry’, yet, on the contrary, Sherlock found her rather fascinating, if a tad terrifying.
John suddenly remembered the incident on the train, and a pang of resentment began to bubble again, but he pushed it down.
Yes, Anderson would tell Seb, and yes Sherlock would probably pay for it later, but he cared very little as he was meeting John in the courtyard, and was in fact not spending the weekend alone.
“Right,” he said, jumping up suddenly, wiping his nose on his sleeve, “I’m off!” and starting heading onward to the castle once again.
He said this with pride, however John couldn’t help feeling there was something profoundly sad in what he’d said.
However, Sherlock couldn’t help but laugh along with the rest of them as Geoff pulled out fake beards that grew the more you drank, party hats that sang to you, fake bobbing apples that shrank every time you failed to bite them, and pumpkins that swore at you once carved.
"Is if fair to say I'm already sick of this school year. I already feel homesick. Well, bedsick...” the dark haired boy said matter-of-factly, who Sherlock had learned was named Gavin...
He didn’t notice John, but merely sat there, robe hanging loosely on his shoulders, glistening in the firelight, cradling his violin in his lap. He plucked the strings carefully. John moved closer.
Sherlock was always one of the first to hop on board the Hogwarts Express. Well, to say hop is a bit ambitious, his bags weren't the lightest, nor he the strongest... but the boarding was done quickly nonetheless. It didn't take a genius to deduce why: Sherlock didn't waste time blubbering or giving heartfelt goodbyes to his parents like all the other sickening people on the platform, who made it impossible to move an inch without colliding with an owl, a trunk or a sobbing child...
“John, meet Billie” Sherlock said cheerily, pulling one glove off and stroking him gleefully with the end of his index finger “Don’t worry - he doesn’t bite; he likes to pretend he does, but really he just likes a lot of praise and a bit of company”
“Come on John, you’re the bloody one who wanted to get fresh air, or whatever?” Gareth called from the hall’s entrance.
“Oh I’m only messing… Seb hasn’t mentioned anything to me about that so I don’t think he knows yet.” Sherlock’s stomach gave a sickening jolt -
“But they were muggles. So, what happened was… what happened to muggles then. What they did for sport,” John spat, “They didn’t understand who they were. They just knew that they were bad. And they had to keep us safe.”
Thankfully, by the time he crept into his dormitory, everyone was either asleep, or too tired to cause him any more irritation just then.
“I think your other bags are there,” John said, pointing to a scattered pile of bags behind Sherlock, “Do I… I think I recognise you, are- are you at-”
“I have no idea where he is?” John said suddenly, after his eyes had been flitting around the hall for a minute or two, “since when would he miss eating?”
The rest of the day followed as all Christmas Eves had for the entirety of Sherlock’s lifetime; Mother had wrestled with the turkey which had outright refused to have an orange shoved somewhere indiscreet, Father had sat by the fireplace and read aloud from 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard', which neither Sherlock or Mycroft could even begin to act interested in, and the smell of the mulled wine and red-currant rum which were popping and simmering away on large cauldrons upon the stove perfumed the entirety of the cottage. It was while they were stirring these enormous concoctions full of cinnamon and orange slices that John said something that made it even more impossible to not warm to him entirely.
Borage began to reel off the ‘basic’ facts about transmutation and the elements, which John could vaguely remember from the previous year… sort of. His quill was moving sharply, tiny sprays of ink dotting themselves on his parchment and hands as he scratched away at the paper. He needed this subject, he really did, and he already felt he was behind.
“Where do we want this, then?” John asked, looking about the lounge, which was covered top to toe, rather excessively, in multi-coloured bunting.
Greg came bounding towards them just as the two of them reached the courtyard, accompanied by Mike, and a very excited looking Molly clutching what looked like Quidditch robes in under her arm.
“Eat it.” Greg scowled at him, but didn’t heed from lathering up a thick slice of toast with umpteen layers of raspberry jam. “And Hurry up, we’ve got to be at Dungeons in ten minutes, unless you want an emotional beating by Maggie to settle you in.”
“Now, I suggest you both go to the feast, get some food in you. I dare say you’ll be a bit woozy for a time. Any troubles, come straight back here now.”
John, in his relatively drunken state, really really had to try not to laugh at the image of Mycroft he was presented with, standing at the top of the stairs.
“Granny lives in Amsterdam,” Sherlock explained, allowing Billie to hop further up onto his arm, “I bet it’s beautiful at Christmas.”
“Night,” And John leant across, taking a few attempts to blow out his lamp, “Party well-planned, Greg.”
Sherlock quickly began to think of something, anything to say to fix this, just as the compartment door slid back open.
“They’re… they’re cases, John” Sherlock sighed, gathering the letters together into some form of order.
“Hmm, well done Sherl. So this means you get to study with the hunky older ones then…” Sherlock shot her a piercing look.
“I dunno, I’ll finish this one? Then maybe do that one together?” John happily finished off his loaf, dusting the crumbs from his hands “then go get warm?”
John stared at him, lifting his gaze from his own parcel of Butterbeers and a chocolate frog, “You’re joking?”
John didn’t speak much to Greg that morning. He listened, and made agreeable sounds whenever Greg’s speech needed some kind of reply, but otherwise he sat at the breakfast table staring into his mug. Greg nodded to the doorway of the great hall suddenly, and John looked up, seeing an irritable looking Sherlock. John lifted a hand weakly to call him over, and tried not to be too endeared by how relieved Sherlock looked at this.
“Come on, you’re still going to come, right?” John asked, almost pleadingly, “Greg and I are going, and Mike and… everyone really.”
It didn’t work brilliantly, it wasn’t Seb’s wand after all, but it still produced a sudden forceful blow to the neck, which caused Sherlock to swerve where he sprinted, trip carelessly over his robes and to land contortedly upon the cool grass. With caution, he rolled onto his back, lifting his hood (which had fallen over his eyes in the debacle), his chasers’ contentment imminent in the air. His eyes peeled open, panic beginning to flood him, just in time to see Sebastian’s foot falling fast towards his face.
The three other boys were asleep, their individual snores distinctly recognisable in the otherwise silent room. Sherlock bolted upright suddenly, and began feeling his clothing in a panic.
John couldn’t find the energy to defend his intelligence that morning, which was just as well in his opinion, as deep down he was sure if they were to get into a battle of wits, Sherlock would win hands down, and frankly John was too bitter about their loss to Slytherin last summer, which now seemed even more humiliating.
After giving the four of them an earful, taking twenty points from both Slytherin and Gryffindor and giving them all a detention the following evening, she dismissed them with simply a glare that could shatter glass. None of them hung around, and as John and Greg trudged soggily down the stone staircase from the headmistress’ office, now covered in muddy pools and bits of sodden grass, Sherlock followed.
But that seemed unimportant as, as soon as their shrill tones started to fill the common room, everyone got very excited and started doing… something… that Sherlock could not believe they called dancing.
Sherlock tossed the hat to the end of his four poster carelessly and tucked himself into the crisp, clean linen. He shut his eyes, forcing sleep to take him.
The impending fear of progress tests and revising poorly written alchemy notes in the gloomy candlelight of the library was not improved by the fact that Sherlock did not care in anyway whatsoever.
“The Incarcerous conjuration, John,” Sherlock’s eyes were very serious all of a sudden “You know, ropes are conjured and wrap around a person, used to hold or strangle them.”
John walked him to the portrait hole, which Sherlock assumed was half due to politeness, half due to ensuring he didn’t hurt himself.
And all of a sudden, Sherlock was certain John’s eyes weren’t looking at his anymore, but somewhere else. Sherlock swallowed.
She smiled kindly, heaving out a large pile of beautifully wrapped presents from underneath the tree, their shimmering crimson paper shining in the firelight of the early morning.
Mike punched him in the arm jokily. John’s face broke into what looked like a forced smile and he began clenching his left fist repeatedly on his thigh. Sherlock noted this -
The two sat in silence for a while, Greg staring off into the distance (probably dreaming about Miss Hooper…) and John staring at the table.
Before they knew it, they were coming to the end of their first term of the year at Hogwarts. December had arrived at the castle, and with it had brought the smallest sprinkling of snow on the rooftops, and a giddy mood which Sherlock despised.
“Mr Watson, I am well aware Mr Holmes is a lovely boy,” John felt his cheeks redden “But do be careful not to get mixed up in those things. The letters he receives, the sneaking about- you’re a good student, and I don’t want him ruining-”
