“Just one more thing.   I just saw that necklace you’re wearing.”
Castiel glanced at Dean, and then back at Sam, “They would say otherwise, but mostly because I’m gay.”
“We gotta do something,” said Dean.  “I don’t know what exactly, but I can’t stand by and let this kinda thing happen.”
Reaching forward Castiel placed his hands on Dean’s rear.  “I suggest you remove those pants then,” he said, raising a single eyebrow.
From Dean, Monday 7.46am.              Sammy says hi
“If you need anything, or have any problems, just dial zero on the room phone, and you’ll come through to reception.”   Mildred glanced over to Dean, “Do you need help with the bags?”
It was only as Noah started to ring up the massive pile of items Dean began to worry about the amount they were spending.    Gabriel had said not to, but money was something Dean always worried about.  He’d been careful in his selection of store, trying to find a shop that had clothing options that were more low to mid-range and therefore price, rather than the branded names such as Levi.
With a loud keening sound, and an even louder “CAS!”, Dean came, pushing back against Castiel, as Castiel’s knot formed and caught on Dean’s rim, locking them together. Castiel cried out loudly himself, biting down on the meat of Dean’s shoulder, as he came long and hard within Dean, his own need for release having been withheld to satisfy his mate.
Ma brought him a carafe of coffee and tried to encourage him to eat some toast. Several of the guests were looking at him disapprovingly. At first he wasn’t sure if it was his appearance they were unhappy about – even he would admit he didn’t look like a Doctor when wearing motorbike leathers – but he didn’t look like a Hell’s Angel either. He wondered if it was his scent; he didn’t have any chemical blockers to take, or surface blockers to put on. Eventually, he realised the issue, when one of the women, a small timid looking Omega, received a glare from her Alpha as she looked him over appraisingly and gave him a small knowing smile. Castiel and Dean hadn’t exactly been quiet this morning, and it looked like half the guests knew exactly what they’d been up to. The last thing he needed was a challenge from an upset or territorial Alpha, so he picked up his coffee and went to sit outside on the porch to await Gabriel.
“Jack!  Where’s Jack?” The fog in his head was clearing.
Dean showed Castiel the maneuverer again at full speed, and then twice more in slow motion, before indicating that Castiel should try it on him.    It took a few goes, but Castiel learnt the principle quickly, and was able to consistently break free of Dean’s hold.  To test Castiel, Dean suddenly grabbed Castiel’s right wrist, and was pleased that Castiel reacted and broke the grip.
“Hi there.  Sorry to descend on you unannounced Mr Winchester,” said Gabriel standing and extending his hand to John.   “I’m Cassie’s brother, Gabe.”
Cas for his part loved hearing Dean swear, knowing he was causing Dean to unravel in ways that he had never experienced. And Dean certainly knew some interesting and imaginative swear words. Cas himself was not immune the effects, and he could feel his own body responding to Dean and what he was doing to him. But this was not about Cas at the moment, and he easily controlled the feelings. Allowing himself to harden pleasurably, but not to be overwhelmed by the moment.
As they continued their walk, Cas realised that Dean was leading them to a very specific part of the bunker grounds. When they rounded the corner of a well trodden path, he saw several cushions and blankets had been carefully prepared in a secluded area. A picnic hamper and a portable beer cooler was also waiting for them.
Dean checked his watch and smiled.  7.30am.  They still had a few hours before they had to leave.   He lay back with his hands behind his head and grinned.  For the first time in a long time, he felt good.
“Cas…” Dean whined as his own desire began to overtake him. “What do you want?”
There was a moment of whispering between several students before a dark-haired girl wandered over to Dean and leant provocatively over the desk in front of him.    “You’re new here, aren’t you,” she asked coyly.
Dean shrugged. “I am trying to keep my time off for when Jack arrives.”
“He’s always known….”
Sitting back down, Gabriel leant back in his chair.   “You’d fight for Castiel or for Sam, but you just don’t care about yourself.”
Dean had been counting down the seconds until his 48 hours of bedrest was completed, and Dean then insisted on being taken down to NICU to see his pup. He was worried and he knew he would never forgive himself if something happened and he personally wasn’t there.
From Castiel, Sunday 8.22pm.             See you tomorrow.
Dean rested his chin on Castiel’s shoulder and just held him.  “You’re going to be having way too much fun at Berkeley to miss me that much.”
Dean could see Henriksen’s eyebrows raise impressed.   “Well done.  That was very insightful, considering you haven’t read it recently.”
The movement must have disturbed Castiel though, as he opened his eyes and looked about in confusion at the angle of the room, and position he found himself in.
Dean almost cried with relief.  “Fuck Cas, you scared me.”  He kissed the top of Castiel’s head.   “You are the best thing that every happened in my life.  You saved me from Hell.  Actual Hell.”  He squeezed him tighter.  “I know you would never knowingly hurt me.  You’re my Angel.”
“Sorry Dean,” Castiel said pushing himself upright again.  “You should have woken me.”
“Gabriel told me that you and Benny were acting on the family’s behalf in a Kidnap and Ransom situation.  Castiel had been taken, and you were meeting with the kidnappers.”
"But you called to me. So perhaps now is …."
Dean gets his 24 weeks scan. Castiel catches up with Gabriel and Rowena over dinner.
Sam stared at him, confused. "Juice?" he queried. "You know there is no vodka in that, right?"
Castiel appeared to be considering this.  “I’m not sure.  I mean, people might see you with me.”
Be warned.   This is a sad one.     Trigger Warning in the end notes.
Dean said nothing.
“Does it matter?” echoed Castiel.  “For crying out loud, you just painted a sign on your back, for no reason.”
The words hit Dean like a punch to the stomach.   Castiel had and would die for him, just as Dean realised that he would do the same for Castiel.    Castiel, Angel of the Lord, who had been alive for over a thousand years.   Dean felt like his heart was about to burst.
“Hey, Novak,” said the taller one.  “I thought we told you to stay away from normal folk.”
Throwing his head back Dean laughed and then kissed Castiel.  He quickly slipped the one stamped Assbutt over his head, and then carefully placed the other over Castiel’s.  “They’re perfect.”
be Castiel’s anything no matter how much he might want to be.
“Are you done Sam?” said Dean.
“Do me a favour though, don’t tell him,” said Dean firmly.  “He’s convinced himself that being friendly with people will get them hurt.   Just don’t let anyone knife him, or worse.”
Dean always made a point of moving the Impala from the school car park to the library car park whenever they visited.    It wasn't that the school car park was unsafe, or the library was safer, but more that he had an inbuilt requirement of needing to have a quick getaway should it be required.    John had drummed into the boys the concept of personal safety from an early age, and walking even a few blocks in a strange area, or where the streetlamps might be out, was not considered safe.  Tonight though, Dean was glad that the car was within easy reach.
Dean shook his head, “Seriously, you have a very bizarre life.”
“Jeez Cas, you are going to kill me.”   Dean leant up on one elbow and let his fingers play with the soft hairs on Castiel’s chest.   “There is no guide for this stuff.   Every person or couple is different.   Do what feels right for you Angel,” said Dean.  “If that is moaning, moan.  If it’s grunting, grunt.  If it’s swearing, feel free to swear like a fucking trooper.   If you want to try something new or different, just ask me.  If there is something you don’t understand, you are allowed to and I want you to ask.”
Castiel huffed a laugh, “You’re the first person I’ve ever told about it.”
“I’m going there now,” said John.   Automatically checking his hip for his gun, his breast pocket for his phone, and his jacket pocket for his keys as he moved, John walked towards the door.
“Holy shit,” came Benny’s southern drawl suddenly from behind Dean as he took in Castiel’s new appearance.  “This is like Grease.”
floor.   Take the main stairs, you can’t miss it.    Because we’re quiet, you’ll have that floor to yourselves.  There’s also a seating and TV area up there, you’re welcome to use,” said Mildred passing Castiel a small card with the door’s key code written on it.   “I see you’ve already booked at table for dinner at 7pm.  That’s down here in the Great Room.   Breakfast is included in your room rate and served from 5.30am to 10.30am. Check out is by 11am please.”
“Let him go.”
“No one will come out here to help you,” spat Alistair.
Shaking his head with confusion, Castiel started the movie again, and settled down on the sofa.   Dean had said that Castiel could use his bed.  But he hadn’t felt comfortable at that idea, so instead he sprawled out along the bench sofa, and propped his head on a cushion.  He would watch the movie, and then just sleep out in the lounge.  He could keep watch from here, just in case Sam needed him.   Happy with his decision, he still couldn’t shake off the feeling of unease.   Sighing, Castiel had a feeling it was going to be a long night.
Dean sighed, “I know this is going to freak you out, but before we go any further, I think we need to talk.  And I think it would be best to do it out here before I lose control back in our room.”
Dean and Castiel make love.
Sam flopped back on the sofa. “I’ve eaten way too much,” he complained.
When Castiel returned to the room and went to his overnight bag.   “I almost forgot.  I got you a present.”
From Castiel, Sunday 8.18pm.             Not at all.   I guess I used ‘talk’ as a euphemism for something else.
"What – I just fancy some granola!" protested Dean.
“I think we’ll save rimming for another time,” said Castiel and lowered his head back to Dean’s cock, as he pushed his finger in again, this time slightly deeper.
Squeezing his hand, Dean said quietly, “I promise nothing will happen that we won’t have previously discussed.”
Shaking his head, Benny took the ball from Dean’s hands, and started to walk back to the school, their lesson was almost over.  “Not really.  But I am not sure he really wants any.  I know he used to be friends with a guy called Kevin.  But Kevin got injured in a hit and run, and his parents pulled him out of school and moved to a new area, closer to a rehab facility.  Never saw him again.”
So far, Dean and Castiel had done nothing further than some serious kissing.  Dean was not rushing Castiel into anything more, and although Castiel was dropping some pretty big suggestions about the back seat of the Impala, or the privacy of the disabled shower area, Dean held back, saying that their first time together was going to be special, and not a quickie during their lunch break.
“I thought you might appreciate the gag,” said Alistair with an evil smile.  “I seem to remember that featuring in your little fantasy at the cabin.”
“Sounds like there were quite a few lines they crossed.   All the stuff from before with Cas and then setting fire to the cabin,” said John shaking his head in disbelief.  “How is he now?”
"Unnecessary," said Cas and mojo'ed them both clean.
“I’m sorry,” said the man. “I wasn’t sure. It was hard to tell outside in the storm, but you’re an Omega. I should go.” The man made a move to grab the door handle and climb out.
They both paused, as the song came to an end.
“I’m getting Cas back, and if I have to take apart this fucking town to do it, I will.”  As Dean marched towards his car, he fired off a quick text, and then opened the door.  “You don’t have to come, Benny.  I mean it.  This could go to shit real quick.”
Thanks to everyone for their kind comments and for leaving Kudos.  It's really interesting to see your comments and ideas.
him,” said Gabriel.
"What's so funny?" said Dean with mock severity.
“You’re right,” said Dean.  “Cas’s hands, they’re forming sign letters.  A and L.  He’s telling me who took him.”
There was a loud beeping noise, and if anything the frantic dance of the nurses sped up. Dean laid his head back down. He was tired and everything was too loud. He could hear what sounded like his own blood rushing in his ears, pounding in time to his heart beat, which was weird, because it seemed to be slowing down. “Sam,” he mumbled.
“OK, I’ll come out,” said Dean.  “I’ll tell…”
Dean could see the moment when Alistair suddenly realised that he was in a whole heap of trouble.   Making yet another fateful decision, Alistair pushed Gordon forward, directly into Dean’s field of fire, as he ran off into the woodland, trying to get away from the scene.
Through the darkness and the pain, Dean recognised that voice. “Sammmmmy?” he seemed to be slurring. Was he drunk? Still hungover? How much had he had to drink?
The man looked puzzled, tipping his head on one side. "Are you a psycho Alpha killer?"
Watching as Gabriel proficiently assessed and treated the injuries, “That one looks close to his kidney,” said Dean quietly, pointing to bruise in the shape of a boot print on Castiel’s left side and he rested another pack on the spot.  Castiel winced.   “If he’s pissing blood, he’ll need a doctor.”
Dean had lost count of the number of schools that he had attended over the years.  Sometimes it was only a for a few weeks, sometimes, a month or more.   The rigmarole of registering at the front desk, being assigned to a Tutor Group, being given a timetable often meant that the first class he attended was always underway, and he became a “show and tell” as soon as he was introduced to the teacher.  The usual, “why don’t you tell the group about yourself,” soon became stale.
He felt Dean pull on his hand slightly and smile at him broadly. “No threat here, Alpha,” Dean teased, putting out his own calming scent. Dean was pleased when Castiel nodded, visibly relaxed, and calmed his scent. Dean thought Castiel seemed a bit embarrassed.
“любимый мой, the flat is clean. Stop worrying!”   (**My beloved)
Looking at Jack, Dean sighed. “He’s barely even three days old.”
Waving the flashlight beam in front of him, he walked unsteadily to the rear of his car. His leather jacket was soaked through within seconds, and he could feel the rain trickling down his back.
“Exactly.  I had an appointment at my lawyer’s office,” said Castiel happily.  “I have to say, probably the first time, I have ever been more grateful to be there.  I just put my mobile on speaker and called him.   I told him I was with the Principal, and could he confirm my whereabouts all morning to her.   Which he did.    He then threatened her with all sorts about lack of validation of evidence, heavy handedness, persecution due to sexual orientation and several other statutes.   By the time he’d finished, I think she was about ready to pee herself.”
Dean’s POV
Walking past the receptionist, Castiel noticed how her eyes had widened as she saw them holding hands. He couldn’t help it as his Alpha postured slightly, straightening his back and raising his chin a little. He wasn’t about to tackle anyone that looked at Dean to the ground, but there was a definite protective, assertive stance.
“It’s complicated,” said Dean.   “Something about him being an emancipated minor.   They are around, but own like half the town, and make his life miserable.”
Dean stood up and hesitated slightly.   “Maybe you should have my number. You know in case you want anything.”   Dean unlocked and handed Cas his mobile phone.   “Put your number in, and I’ll text you so you get mine.”
The first hint was in the afternoon on the following Monday, when Castiel was unexpected called out of class to go the Principals office.  Castiel gathered his books into his rucksack and after casting Dean an anxious glance left the lesson, following the ‘runner’ that had been sent to fetch him.
Castiel moaned and hide his face in his hands.   “I hate you, so much,” he mumbled.
“I’m still processing,” said Castiel, holding up a finger and looking at the ceiling.   “Give me a moment.”   He paused again before looking at Dean.  “Sorry, nope, can’t picture it, I think you may have to give me a demonstration.”
The only dark point in their relationship had been when Dean had asked about Cas’s family.   Cas had never mentioned anyone, and given Sam was such a large part of Dean’s life, it felt weird knowing nothing about Cas’s.     Unfortunately, Cas had become distressed, finally, explaining that they hadn’t parted on the best of terms, and that he had since had zero contact with his family, having been kicked out when he’d told his parents he thought he was gay.   Dean had spent the evening holding Cas as he cried, before falling asleep in Dean’s arms on the sofa at Dean’s flat.   They had never discussed the subject again.
“I don’t know,” said Dean softly.   “I think he does.  But he was more concerned for my welfare, if anyone saw us talking, rather than his.  He seemed to think that his parents would make life difficult for me.”
Castiel allowed Dean to steady him as he got to his feet and shuffled back to the lounge.   Once he was settled back down under his duvet, with Dean at his side, he picked up the remote control for the TV and set it to Netflix before passing it to Dean.   “You choose.”
Today Dean was pleased to be out on the playing field, in bright sunshine.   Dean was working with Benny, throwing the football back and forth between them quickly, as they ran down the length of the pitch, trying to improve their speed and accuracy.    Suddenly a tall figure running in the distance caught Dean’s attention, and Dean fumbled the catch, tripping over his own feet and sprawling on the grass.   Swearing under his breath, he paused to take a breath before sitting up.
Castiel smiled.  “You’d be surprised how relaxing it can be, as well as the obvious benefits of flexibility.   My little sister wanted to do it, and because I had to mind her anyway, I learnt as well.  I kept it up after I left home.”    He stood up straight, and bent forward at the waist, keeping his legs rigid, and folded his entire body in half, and resting his forehead on his knees, his hands flat to the floor.   “This pose is called Uttanasana.”
Words were not needed between them as Dean gently widen the gap between his legs, allowing Cas's legs to fall between them, increasing the pressure on both their groins. A noise akin to a growl escaped from deep in Dean's throat as Cas started to move. Cas reached around and grab Dean's hand, stretching it up until it was above Dean's head. Maintaining both momentum and pressure he quickly grasped Dean's other hand, and repeated the maneuver, effectively pinning Dean beneath him limiting his movements.
“Yes, well, no fear there.  She’s not my type,” Castiel replied dryly.
“How about you tell me what you want, and I’ll say if it can happen?”
Sheriff Mills had kept them apprised of the ongoing case against Alistair and Gordon, but currently there was no expectation of a court date on horizon, so John planned to head back to Matty’s for another week.   A week after the events at the cabin, Dean helped John pack up the truck ready for John’s return to Texas.   John slammed the tailgate shut and indicated for Dean to join him in the cab.   Dean climbed in and steeled himself for a ‘conversation’ with his Dad.   This was something John often did when he wanted to speak to either of the boys without the other being present.   The simple physical positioning of facing forward, lessened the possibility of conflict that sitting opposite each other would bring.
“Nah. I couldn’t sleep. Thought I would grab us breakfast from the bakery in town, and happened to pass this way. Sorry man, I wasn’t following you. I saw the bike parked up and, thought I would check you were OK.”
Once they arrived at the hospital Gabriel was quickly able to ascertain that Castiel was currently being treated in the ER.  As family, Gabriel was allowed into the treatment area, whilst Dean paced anxiously in the waiting room.   After about 40 minutes, a nurse appeared, and called approached him.   “Are you Dean?”
“And yet you fell asleep with your head on his lap while he stroked your hair. Classy.”
Dean's jaw fell slightly open, and his eyes flickered around Cas's face, taking in the stern but caring look Cas was giving him, the slight stubble around his jaw line, and the messy, but oh so sexy hair.
Handing them each a menu, Ryan quickly pointed out the special’s available on the board and asked about drinks.
The illumination from the car headlights was swallowed immediately in the darkness and rain, lighting up perhaps only the first few inches ahead. The windscreen wipers couldn’t keep up with the vicious sheet rain beating down on the car, and Dean could feel the tyres occasionally lose their grip on the slippery road. Patting the dash, he muttered, “It’s alright Baby. We’ll just go careful.”
He had been patiently waiting in line for his turn, when his eyes had flicked over the rest of the shop, and finally rested on the magazines on the top shelf to the far right of the checkout.  Initially the bright yellow and red of Busty Asian Beauties had caught his attention, but then a pop of blue, from the next magazine along had him drawing a quick intake of breath.   Those crystal clear blue eyes were unmistakable.
“I sincerely hope not, young man,” said Zar with a smile.
“Oh yeah, I did,” said Dean kissing him.   He pushed himself up to his elbows and frowned looking down at the mess of his underwear.    Glancing across at Castiel, he saw that Castiel was in a similar predicament.  An idea formed in his mind, and Dean said, “stay right there.”   Carefully getting off the bed, he went to the bathroom, and started to fill the large double ended two person tub.  He quickly stripped off his underwear, using it wipe up most of the sticky cum, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
Carefully finishing his mouthful before answering, Castiel sighed.  “I guess it’s just habit.   I don’t really ‘do’ fashion,” he said using air quotes.  “When I left home, um, I just focused on what was necessary for school, the rest was just ignored.  I am not sure, but I don’t think I own any jeans.”
“Good shout.   One second…...   It’s dry.”
"Fuck no, Cas," said Dean. "I initiated this, I wanted to do it that way." He reached down and adjusted their bodies slightly, so again their cocks nestled. Dean's cock still rigid, but comfortable against Cas's. "Would you ride me Cas?" he asked shyly, resting his hand on Cas's lower back, and gently encouraging him to move slowly against him.
Looking at his watch, Castiel grabbed his bag.   “Let’s get some lunch, and if you’re really interested in the shitty details of my life, I’ll fill you in.  Then you can leave me alone.”
“Well, that’s good. I mean about not hitting you. Not good that you broke down. But what about you?” said Dean. “Are you hurt?”
Dean was the first to reach out and place his hand on Cas's hip. "I know I said I would "help" you," said Dean cautiously. "But, I ….. I would like to take some time to err, research, the situation." He finished weakly.
"Et Latine loqui?" Sam asked Castiel hesitantly.   (**You speak latin?)    Dean looked up.
Dean pushed the feeling of dread down and went back to grab his jacket and keys for Baby. He had no idea that Cas could ride a motorcycle, and wished that Cas had told him or left a note that he had left the bunker.
Trying to look sternly at Dean, Castiel said, “Don’t tease Gabriel.”
“I don’t think so.  Not physically,” said Dean thinking back to how Castiel had behaved at school.   “I think he could, he’s not small or weedy.  From what I saw, he’s just kinda trying to hide.”
“Cas,” he said quietly drawing Castiel’s gaze to him.  “You sure about this?”
He found himself standing in the shower room of the bunker facing the 3 open fronted cubicles that made up men's shower area. The green tiled walls, common throughout the bunker, were covered with condensation, and the room was partially filled with steam obscuring his view. A whimper came from the cubicle on the right, and Cas stepped closer full of concern.
Castiel gasped loudly, his hips jerked once more, before he came over Dean’s hand in long strands.   Castiel continued to shudder as Dean stroked his cock, milking him through the orgasm, before gently stopping.
Castiel breathed deeply, through his nose, and could smell the unmistakable smell of warm leather, gunpowder and whisky that was just so Dean.
“Yes Sir,” said Dean relieved.
Am I (and Cas) forgiven now?
"Hell Cas, that's a useful trick." Dean threw a blanket over them both, and reached for the beer cooler. He passed Cas a bottle and took one for himself, sipping it slowly. He leaned back against Cas reveling in the cool touch of him, and the comfort he provided. He looked up at Cas, who was staring at the stars. Another meteor flashed across the sky.
Dean took a deep breath, the whisky loosening his tongue enough to speak, and looked up into Cas's amazing clear blue eyes and released everything in one go. "Cas, you are way too good for me. I know I will mess this up, like I have messed up everything else in my life. Everyone I have ever loved has either been hurt or killed, and I know I couldn't bear it if that happened to you; I've never been with any man before, and I don't want to screw it up, or not be good enough for you, or hurt you. I think you can do an awful lot better …"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well don’t get too used to it.  We’re leaving as soon as the school year is over,” said Dean sadly.
“Just think about it,” said Gabriel.   “Sam could take Cassie’s room, and you guys can use the bed, just the bed mind you, in the Playroom.”
"When my father would leave Sammy and me to go hunting for days at a stretch," said Dean breaking the silence between them, "one of our favourite activities would be to climb up onto the roof of whatever crappy motel we had been left in, and lie out and look at the stars. I swear Sammy knew every constellation in the northern hemisphere."
Gabriel and Zar both burst out laughing, and Gabriel held out his hand.  “Five bucks Zar.  Pay up.”
Castiel’s jaw dropped.   He threw his bag down on the desk and stared at Dean.   “Seriously?”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
“I’m Lisa.”   Lisa indicated to a group of girls sitting on the other side of the classroom.   “My friends and I would love to invite you to join us.  I mean, being new and all that,” she glanced disapprovingly at Castiel, “you wouldn’t know the right people to know.”
“Sam,” said Dean, getting his attention.   He quickly signed something to Sam, whose eyes went wide, and he blushed furiously.
When Friday came, Dean and Castiel sat inside in the cafeteria, while Benny and Lee wandered out to the quad area, and then towards the outdoor sports storage sheds.  It hadn’t taken much effort to establish that Alistair and his friends would hide out amongst the sheds smoking on a daily basis.
Dean looked at Sam worriedly.  "OK Cas, we'll take you home."     Dean passed the knife to Sam.   "I'll bring the car up.  I am not sure he can walk.  I don't think they'll be back but keep an eye out."
At the conclusion of his explanation, Dean stopped talking and waited for their comments.    There was an immense pause and wall of silence as Lee looked at Benny, Benny looked at Lee and they both looked at Dean.   It felt like no one wanted to be the first to disrupt the intricate picture Dean had woven of his intentions.
“No problem, dearie,” Ma said. She reached around Dean and opened the door for him.
There was knock at the door, and Sammy called out, “Dean.  Gabriel gave me some cream for your back.”
“Fuck Angel,” Dean breathless exclaimed.
Dean rolled his eyes but stood up.   He took a small folding knife from his pocket and placed it on the table.   He flexed his arm and his longer thin knife dropped from his jacket arm into his palm.   He placed that on the table too and sat back down.
John cancels the grounding.
“Promise me,” Dean demanded, squeezing his hand tightly, his eyes drilling into Sam.
“Yeah, well the old bat gave you ‘Angel’, and I got ‘Trickster’.  So suck it up, Angel,” said Gabriel. “Soup’s ready.  Do you think you can make it to the breakfast bar Cassie, or do you want to eat in here?”
Dean didn’t want to leave his flat.  He didn’t want to visit the Roadhouse, and spend time being sociable.  He wanted to crawl into a dark hole, where his boyfriend (ha!) was a cute, naïve librarian working student that liked burgers and had to have jokes explained to him, not some bizarre sex idol.
Cas had immediately looked up from the floor where he was kneeling and if that wasn’t the hottest thing Dean had ever seen.  This stunning man on his knees looking up at Dean with concern.  In a smooth move Cas had risen to his feet and was cradling Dean’s jaw in his hands, holding him steady, whilst inspecting the cut on the side of Dean’s forehead.
“Oh Dean,” she said sadly. “I’m currently in Portland. Darn, I don’t land back in Kansas until Monday evening. Are you going to be alright?”
“I’d like that,” said Castiel as he reached up to hold Dean’s face.
“Don’t you think it suits you?”
The expression on Castiel’s face was completely innocent, “Do you mean being able to hold you?  Or being able to say you’re mine?”
Confused Dean looked at Castiel.  “Are we going out?”
Castiel’s eyes went wide, and he raised his hands immediately.
Dean and Gabriel carefully helped Castiel stand and guided him to the Playroom.  Once next to the bed, Dean handed him off to Gabriel and left the brothers to themselves.   He made his way back to Sam in the lounge.
This morning however Dean was completely unprepared for the situation he found himself in. Firstly, he was hit with an unusual smell – a combination of ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and raspberries. It smelt so good, he couldn't help but deeply inhale the scent enjoying the difference between that and dusty blankets. He could also tell that he had slept much longer than his usual 3 or 4 hours, and had slept really well – proper full restful, no nightmare sleep. The shock moment came when he tried to stretch and discovered not only was he in bed someone, but was completely entangled with them. This wasn't just cuddling, it was more like possession. Dean found that he was not only leaning on that person, using their arm as pillow, but their legs were entwined together, almost to the point of being unsure who had the more dominate position. Dean also realised that he was comfortable – the "I don't want to move – can I stay like this forever" comfortable.
“Yeah, I’m fine. That’s OK Charlie. It can’t be helped.” Checking he was still on his own, Dean took a deep breath. “I wanted to ask you. Do you still have your grey hat?”
“He then gave me a very embarrassing lecture on safe sex, explained about putting a sock on the bedroom door handle, told me not to traumatise my brother, and brought me a large box of condoms.”  Dean blushed.   “I appreciated the thought.”  He saw Castiel trying not to laugh.   “Given the shit you’re going through at school, I guess things were not quite so easy for you.”
Cas nodded, a scared look in his eye, but he held up his hands trying to placate Dean, by showing he was harmless.
Rowena and Gabriel had added to their family too.  Their second child, Anna, was a month younger than their twins. This time in the hospital, to Gabriel and Castiel's relief. All the children got on well together and frequently had sleepovers at each other’s houses to give their tired parents a break.  The older ones, sleeping tangled together in a huge puppy pile, the babies nearby in a cot to benefit from their collective scents.
Cas could hear Dean's ragged breathing and smiled happily to himself. He waited a few moments for Dean to gain enough strength to stand on his own again, before using the sponge to tenderly clean his groin and legs.
Suddenly there was another presence by the bed. A doctor, if the white coat was any indication. “Mr Winchester, I’m Doctor Taylor.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll live, and you’re a bit too ‘bear’ for me anyway,” Dean said with a small smile.
Cas held out his hand, "would you please lie with me? Nothing else, just lie with me."
Sheriff Mills approached at look down in curiosity at the whimpering man. She raised an eyebrow in question at his appearance.
Dean scowled at the damp patch on the bed, and grabbed a couple of towels from the bathroom to clean up the amniotic fluid the best he could.
Dean increased the distance between himself and Castiel, but reached out to entwine their fingers together.  “You OK with this, Angel?  Being seen holding hands in public, with me?”
Dean nodded and awkwardly rested a hand on Cas's arm. "Be safe," he said quietly.
“Are you OK, did they hurt you?” sniffled Sam as he clung to Dean.
“Is anyone there?” he shouted, trying to raise his voice above that of the wind.
“If he is interested, that’s a good idea,” said John.  “But remember fighting isn’t for everyone.  Some people just aren’t built that way.”
Dean has a scan of his pup. Castiel gets roped into helping with fundraising.
Grinning Dean carefully kept scissoring and stretching Castiel. “I may not have done the same level of research you did, but trust me you’re going to love this bit,” said Dean, and gently reached and stroked Castiel’s prostate before pressing it firmly.
Blushing Castiel looked away. “Had sex then.”
Dean hadn’t moved since he first spotted Cas. He couldn’t tell if he had been watching for 1 minute or an hour. He had always admired Cas’s fighting skills when he’d seen them. He knew Cas had been a soldier, and a darn good one. But he hadn’t ever thought about how he had learnt or honed those skills.
Dean looked a little startled at first as he felt Cas's cock grown and harden against him, but discovered it just increased the pleasure and was happy Cas also seemed to enjoy this.
When Castiel winced once too often for Dean’s liking, Dean made him sit down, and let him watch as Sam and Dean sparred with each other.   Dean was stronger, but Sam was lighter and very quick on his feet.
Against All Odds – Phil Collins
Dean slowly stepped forward into Castiel’s personal space.  Carefully he raised a hand and let it brush across Castiel’s jaw, before slipping it round the back of Castiel’s neck, letting his fingers gently rest, tangled in Castiel’s hair, and pulling Castiel towards him so their foreheads touched.  “Your Assbutt, if you’ll have me.”
Castiel was hovering by the door. Dean thought he could smell embarrassment in the air. “You should get undressed,” said Castiel. “You’re wet and will catch a chill.”
Concern rose in Castiel about the request from Dean not to look for him. If Castiel was being honest with himself, finding Dean was exactly what he was now thinking of doing. His body was screaming that
Dean reached out to smooth down the slightly rumpled jacket Sammy wore.  He was growing again, he’d would need a new jacket soon.  Along with blue jeans, a Star Wars T-shirt and white sneakers, he looked older than his actual age of 14 years.  “You got your lunch?”
“Yes, Sir,” said Sam obediently.
As always, huge thanks to Sailor_fujoshi on Discord for being my Beta reader on this.  She has been amazing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you mean it, Cas?” he asked gruffly. Cas could feel the tension as Dean waited for a response. “About another day?” he clarified. “This isn’t a one off?”
Away from the warm water and noise of the shower room, suddenly Dean was afraid. He knew nothing about making love to a man. He knew almost instinctively he was in love with Cas. He wanted to hold Cas and protect him. Dean snorted out loud at the thought of 'protecting' Cas – the soldier of God, Angel of the Lord.
Doctor Seccsi visited Jack later that day, and spoke to them both. Castiel had already spoken to Doctor Seccsi earlier in the week, so knew he was pleased with Jack’s progress. Doctor Seccsi confirmed to Dean that he planned to arrange Jack’s transfer to the Special Care Nursery, as early as Monday. Jack would need to gain a little more weight before he could be discharged from the hospital completely, but had every confidence that it would happen fairly quickly, if Jack’s progress continued at the rate it had been.
Castiel shrugged, “It’s not something I would be keen to repeat in a hurry.   I believe I should thank you for teaching Dean so well.  Without him, I don’t think I would be here otherwise.”
Castiel stopped his massage and flicked a drop of water at Dean.
Without saying another word, Dean indicated for Benny to get in the back seat, as he climbed in the front, and they drove off.
Sam bit his lip.   “Dean wanted me to keep an eye on you.   Keep you out the way. So, he arranged for you to come here overnight, so you were safe.  With me.”
Dean caught the eye of Jess, who was now hovering nearby. “Jess, I believe you know Cas. This is Jack’s ….” Dean looked at Castiel with a little frown. “What do you want to be called?”
Returning to the kitchen Dean started rummaging in the drawers and cupboards of Gabriel’s kitchen.  “Do you have a blow torch or portable gas stove?” he asked
Shrugging slightly Dean grinned, “Kid likes Celine frigging Dion.”
There was a beeping from Dean’s phone in his jacket pocket.   “Shit,” he exclaimed.  “I lost track of time, I gotta go get Sammy.”   He grabbed his jacket and slipped it on.   “Sorry I gotta run.”
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Once Dean had managed to open Cas's shirt, he left it on but open, and sat up slightly, to look down on a very rumpled and thoroughly kissed Cas staring up at him. "Hell you're a beautiful sight," said Dean.
Patience laughed, “Well that’s good that your pup is active. But I’m afraid without the amniotic fluid cushioning the force, you are probably going to feel it a bit more than normal.”
No, no, no!
“No, numb nuts.  I mean, what if we make him part of our group. Instead of covertly following him, let’s go all out.  Make him sit with us at lunch, during lessons, even drive him home,” said Lee enthusiastically.
From Dean, Monday 12.16pm.            Food not feed   u r not a horse.
“Faster,” Castiel whimpered he let his eyes flicker shut, giving in to the sensations that Dean was producing in him.   “Good.  So good.”
"No Cas, Hell no. Don't leave yet." Dean practically lunged at him and grabbed his hand. "Look sit down, and I'll try to explain. Promise you won't leave. Not until we have talked."
Google Map is very useful.  Archer Road does exist (although the cabin is fictitious).  The border of the counties, is also true.
Dean made a feint causing Alistair to start to move.  Dean edged right again, taking him closer to the Impala.   Judging distances and opportunities Dean took one more step, then took his chance.   Dean shifted as if to lunge at Alistair, which caused Alistair to jump backwards, in that moment instead of going forwards Dean pivoted and crouched, sweeping his hand up and over the rear wheel of the Impala, allowing him to snag the hidden gun as he moved.  Alistair completely misread the situation and thinking Dean had fallen, charged forward raising his knife ready to plunge it into Dean’s back.
“Oh my,” said Noah breathlessly, who had just returned at that point.  “Very nice.”
“Why?” said John.
“It’s just the first time seeing them again after Lawrence and…”  Dean broke off.  He still had trouble verbalising John leaving him behind, even though he loved him for it.
The pièce de resistance though was the centrefold.   Dean was sure his heart had stopped.   There was Cas lying amongst the hay, lit by shafts of sunlight that caught the dust in the air, giving him an ethereal glow; hat by his side, his hand clearly cupping himself, in his unbuttoned jeans, giving a tantalising hint of curly dark hair at his groin, his lips slightly parted and his eyes half closed as though in the act of pleasuring himself.  Dean couldn’t bear look any more.   He closed the magazine, letting it slide to the floor, and he curled up in his bed.
Castiel walked away, but stopped at the sidewalk as they drove past him heading South.   Sam waved and he raise his hand in response.
Dean stared at the number of wires on Jack’s little body, monitoring his heart beat, oxygen level, another tube providing oxygen, a nasal feeding tube and something that looked like RF security tag around his arm.
“Mmmnnngg,” said Castiel inarticulately, as Dean removed one of his hands to hold the base of Castiel’s cock.
“No way.  He’s my brother,” said Gabriel angrily.   “You can’t expect me….”
“Well I think I saw a pizza place over at the main offices.  How about you and I wander over that way, Dean, and grab us a couple of extra spicy’s”
Noticing that the windowsill had some dust, Dean decided a quick tidy up wouldn’t hurt, and might help him relax. He dusted and wiped all the surfaces; gave the window a quick wipe over, and hoovered the floor. He then checked all the clothes in the chest of drawers that would double as a changing table, putting them all neatly back in order of clothing size.
Dean turned to look at the boy that had spoken, “Might have known you’d be here Gordon.  What’s up Alistair, need backup?  Do you only feel brave when you have an audience?  Or is planting trip wires more your thing?”
Thank you very much to everyone who left a comment or kudos, I can't tell you how much they help my anxiety.
Dean grinned proudly and mouthed a "thank you" at Castiel.
By the time they were about halfway through breakfast, Castiel was feeding Dean his pieces of crispy bacon, whilst Dean was passing him his fruit kebabs.    Sitting together enjoying breakfast felt comfortable and right.
“You just always seem sure of yourself, and, well, you seem much more experienced.    And you know my past, or well perhaps lack of it,” said Castiel.
Breaking apart, but still holding hands, they glared at Benny and Lee, who were wolf whistling and cheering along with the crowd.  Rolling his eyes, Dean grinned at Castiel, and pulled him along to their first class.
From Castiel, Sunday 8.20pm.             Hug you, kiss you, maybe more if you were amenable.
Dean stared at Castiel.   Dean had always been stunned by the brilliant blueness of Castiel’s eyes, the depths of them having previously conjured images of crystal clear lakes, or the vibrant ocean around a tropical island.  Now was no different.
“No.  I won’t.”   Dean lifted Castiel’s leg slightly, giving him greater access, and as much as he wanted to bury himself in Castiel’s warm hole, instead he took the time to line up carefully, and nudge Castiel’s rim with his cock.  Castiel unconsciously tensed, and then deliberately relaxed.
The room itself was large, Dean realised it has been created by converting the large double garage.  But it was the contents of the room that was a surprise.  There were two main areas, a bedroom and a bathroom with a large double shower.  In addition to several large standing LED stage lamps, there was also several film cameras.  All pointing at a large oversized bed, with crisp white sheets and masses of pillows resting against a very padded headboard.   Dean took a couple of steps into the room and noticed various other pieces of furniture that looked like padded benches, a replacement headboard with metal rings embedded in it, and even what looked like a school vaulting horse, stacked to one side behind the cameras.  Different types of rope, handcuffs and other devices were displayed on the wall.  Suddenly Dean realised what he was looking at, and the term ‘Playroom’ made sense.  “Dude, is this …….?”
From Dean, Sunday 8.18pm.               Oh. Talk.  Should I be worried?
“Yep, but you aren’t going near mine,” said Benny laughing.
The removal of Alistair’s little gang from school, also allowed Castiel to relax more.   With the protection of Dean, Benny and Lee, he was hiding less, and his personality began to shine through.  Others saw it too, and more students began to acknowledge and talk to Castiel, inviting him to join their discussions.    But on the rare occasions Castiel did participate, everyone knew that no matter how interesting the subject, or how attentively he appeared to be listening, Castiel’s gaze always sought the warm green eyes of Dean, who would be sitting within Castiel’s line of sight, reassuring and supporting him.
“I thought he was just doing the whole customer service thing!”
“Obscene material?” question Dean.
Dean could still hear the shower running and Castiel humming quietly. With another quick backwards look, he quietly opened the bedroom door and snuck out. He padded down the stairs, throwing a glance over his shoulder to make sure Castiel hadn’t followed and made his way to the front door.
“Your assistance would be appreciated,” said the stranger. The voice was deep and gravelly, so Dean assumed the rider was male. Indicating the bike trapping his leg, the man said, “I don’t appear to be able to lift it from this angle.”
Dean laughed, and then winced as another contraction took hold.
"Have you changed your mind about me?" Cas hung his head. "I… I can erase the memory and leave if you would prefer."
Uriel turned and walked away.  Gabriel waited several seconds to be sure Uriel was out of earshot before letting go of the breath he was holding.   Looking to Dean, he smiled.  “Sorry about Uriel.   If I said he was the most accepting of our siblings, you have some idea of the level of animosity within our family.”
Soon the room was filled with the sound of flesh slapping on flesh, and both men panting from the exertion.  The mutual urging, grunts, cries and moans of pleasure created a feedback loop that pushed each closer the edge.  Dean reached for his cock, but Castiel replaced Dean’s hand with his own.  “Let me.”
“Fuck.  You feel amazing,” Dean moaned.
“Um.   Dean told me about your job”
“So Cas, wotcha doing?”
Castiel watched Dean’s face closely. He could tell that several different scenarios were going through Dean’s head at the moment. Dean had seemed amenable to the idea of marriage and mating earlier, but what if he was just being polite? He had been stuck in a car with Castiel at the time. He felt like he was holding his breath again until Dean spoke.
“One more, Dean?” asked Castiel dropping his eyes.
Glancing at Dean, Castiel shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot.   "I... um.... thought I'd sit over ...."
Joining them at the breakfast bar, Gabriel watched them closely.  Suddenly his eyes went wide as he spotted the marks on Dean’s neck.   Seeing Gabriel’s stare, Dean just smiled and adjusted his collar.
“Well, when you put it like that,” said Dean rubbing the back of his neck uneasily.  “I guess it does sound crazy.”
“Yeah. Gabe, I’m here,” said Dean.  His mind was churning at a million miles an hour.  There wasn’t time.  He had 45 minutes to get there.  Sheriff Mills couldn’t get here in that time, even with blues and two’s.  The local police would be worse than useless.  He stared at Benny’s concerned face.
“Yes Cas, a friend.  Not a boyfriend.  Not a with benefits friend.  A ‘please help me with my homework and let’s watch a movie together’ friend.”  Dean laughed.   “Please tell me you have at least one platonic friend at this school.”
“OK Sammy, it’s OK,” he said reassuringly.  “Where’s Dean?”
“Dean!” yelled Sam from the main house.   “Dad’s here.”
“You pretty much hold all the cards,” said Castiel, rubbing Jack’s back comfortingly. “It’s up to you.”
Dean could tell Sam was frustrated.
“Really?” said Castiel in surprise.
John had returned late Sunday, and he listened with interest as Sam, with some embellishments, and Dean, with less embellishments, told him the story Castiel’s attack.  Both boys had agreed not to mention Gabriel’s line of work.
"Fuck yeah."
“I see,” Sam turned to Castiel. “Will you look after him, and Jack?”
“Gabe,” whined Castiel in protest.   “I barely know him.  I’ve spoken to him like five times, and one of those was me bleeding over him.”
Thanks again.   Enjoy.
Shrugging with one shoulder, so as not to disturb Jack, Castiel remained quiet.
When the police car stopped, Dean was amazed to Sheriff Mills climb out “What are you doing here?”
I hope you enjoy this chapter.  I had fun writing it.
“Winnie the Pooh.  Really?”
Turning his back so the teacher wouldn’t see him looking at his phone, Dean checked for a message and then sent a quick text.
The shy embarrassed smile that Castiel’s wore was breath-taking as far as Dean was concerned.  “Hello Dean,” said Castiel timidly.
“Really, ‘cos from where I’m standing, it kinda looks like you do.  I know you two attacked Cas the other week at the library.  Need a team to take on one guy?  You both ran off pretty quick when I arrived.”
Dean found himself humming to Jack as he waited. Sam arrived about 15 minutes later, his eyes wide and anxious. Dean could smell the distress on him, and wafted his hand under his nose. “Woah, Sammy. I think you better use blockers,” said Dean.
“Please Hannah.”  Castiel turned to Dean.   “Dean, what would you like?  My treat.”
The brothers meet each, but not under the best of circumstances.  We also discover more about Castiel, and his living arrangements.
He was a good 30 minutes into his journey as he rounded the long curved bend in the road that skirted the nearby lake. Dean glanced over to the lake to appreciate the simplicity of the forest and lake, and was stunned to see the missing motorbike parked off to one side by the water’s edge. He quickly checked the road, and pulled into the nearby layby. It wasn’t specifically designed for stopping, but glancing around he could quite clearly see where the motorcycle had gone off road, cutting through a narrow track leading to the lake. The track was too narrow for Baby. Biting his lip, Dean locked the car and made his way on foot towards the lake shore. It only took him 10 minutes to reach the bike. Quickly he checked it over to make sure it was indeed the one from the bunker’s garage, before looking around for Cas. The bike was upright and in once piece, so it was clearly not an accident scene.
Dean swore, blushed a deep red, and glanced at Gabriel who was howling with laughter.   “Dude, seriously!”
..~~~...
“Let’s get you up bucko,” said Gabriel with forced brightness.   He could see how much Castiel was suffering.
Castiel nodded holding Dean’s hand.  “Partly.   I was grabbed this morning when I was out running.  Tied up, blindfolded, and eventually driven here.   Alistair said he’d let me go in exchange for Dean.  He made Dean kneel then he went for him.   Dean told me to run.  So I did.  Benny was close by.  He pulled me to safety, untied me and by the time I got back here it was over.”
“Sam, I am very concerned about your behaviour,” said Castiel firmly.  “You seem distracted and uneasy.   Is everything alright.”
“Don’t hold back,” said Castiel, rolling his eyes and huffing.
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
Dean leant back in his seat and stared at him with a shocked expression.   “That’s so fucked up man.”   Suddenly he felt guilty about allow Castiel to buy his lunch.   “Where do you live?  How do you cope?”
“Yo Dean,” yelled Benny from where he was standing next to Azzer’s prone form.  “When you two love birds have finished, this one probably needs a hospital.”
Castiel dragged his hands from Dean’s hip and shoulder and down his chest, and across his stomach to Dean’s belt.   Dean could feel Castiel’s breath on his neck as Castiel made quick work of unhooking the buckle, before popping the buttons on the fly, and easing them open enough to slip his hands back to Dean’s hips to push them down.  Dean felt like Castiel was deliberately torturing him, by avoiding the one part of Dean that needed attention, like 20 minutes ago.  After he guided Dean to sit on the bed, Castiel lowered himself to his knees to pull the jeans off completely, one leg at a time.   The care and consider Castiel took, in removing Dean’s socks at the same time as his jeans startled Dean.   It was such a small thing, but it showed a level of attention that Dean he wasn’t sure he would possess himself by this point.
John had left for Texas the previous day, Sunday, leaving the boys with a couple of hundred dollars for the week.   It was a well ingrained habit with the boys that when their Dad took a job, and left them on their own, they would spend as much time after school in the local library.   It had started as a way of being to let Sam study in peace, and access books for his studies that they couldn’t afford, but it also meant it saved them money not having to light and heat the trailer.  Another point in its favour, was that not all hotels had free Wi-Fi, but libraries nearly always did.
Dean nodded.  "This is my younger brother, Sam.  I know Cas from school."  Dean paused, "I wanted to take him to the ER, but he insisted he wanted you.  I don't think he lost consciousness, but they worked him over good.  Back and ribs especially.   He didn’t want us calling the cops either."
Shaking himself from his thoughts, he realised that before things went any further though, there was an additional conversation to be had.    With Castiel watching him, he opened the drawer of the bedside cabinet and reached in removing the bottle of lube and box of condoms he’d placed there.  He left them within easy reach on the cabinet, and then Dean purposely dropped his towel and slid into bed, lying down in a perfect mirror of Castiel’s pose.
From Castiel, Monday 12.17pm.         DO NOT COME TO THE HOUSE.
Gabriel waved him off.  “Let me order the Chinese, and you need to call your father.”
Once Jack had been given the all clear to leave hospital, both Dean and Jack had moved into Castiel’s house. Initially Dean slept in Jack’s room, but within a month, Dean and Castiel had mated. To their embarrassment and surprise, Dean had fallen pregnant immediately, which gave them their daughter, Claire. Whom, with all the care and attention that Castiel could lavish on Dean, was born at full term, a healthy 8lb 5oz, and Dean suffered no complications this time around.
“Hey,” said Dean brightly, standing up and drawing their attention to him and away from Castiel.   “I don’t think we’ve met yet.  I’m Dean.”
“That was quite good.”
Alistair tried to reassert his authority over the group.  “OK.  We’re done here.  Let’s head back to town.”
Saying goodnight at the door was difficult for both Dean and Castiel. Especially with Sam waiting on the outside for Dean, and Gabriel standing smirking on the inside.  Everything stayed at the PG13 level, much to their frustration.
“Hey there. How are you doing?” said Sam, giving him a gentle squeeze. Sam could smell an undercurrent of distress from Dean. “What’s wrong?”
"But the example...."
Dean grinned.   “That’s something we can work with.”
Twin.   Dean glanced over at the other Cas in the button down that was smiling at him.  Identical twin.  “You never said you had a twin.”
“Can I ask you a question?” Dean asked.
Tonight however, the stage at the far end was empty.   There was a reasonable crowd of patrons, enough that all of the tables and booths were taken, and groups of people were clustered around several of the standing tables.    He’d spotted Sam immediately behind the bar, his tall frame and long floppy hair, obvious above the heads of the other servers.  Pushing his way through the crowd towards Sam, he stopped dead when he saw who Sam was talking to.   Blue eyes, messy hair and a jaw line that Dean had wanted to kiss every day for the rest of his life.  Cas.
“Describe him,” said Charlie urgently.
OK.  Here you go - the ending to Heart Story.
Pursing his lips, Dean nodded, and retreated to his room.   It had been a very long night, and he hadn’t got that much sleep, and right now he wanted to avoid ‘that’ look his father had given him.
"Wanted to see you, see all of you," said Cas firmly.
“Needed to go,” he said, confused as to why she would be worried.
Dean then turned to his bedside cabinet and extracted a half consumed bottle of whisky and a single glass. He poured a large measure into the glass and handed it to Cas.
"It's OK Gabe," said Castiel reaching for him.
“I don’t remember you complaining! And how was I to know that your little swimmers would still be quite so active for quite so long after your snip,” complained Dean. “You’re the Doctor.”
At around 6am Dean felt the need to use the bathroom. Swinging his legs out of bed, he took a slow careful walk just down the hallway to the cubical. He felt a lot better after relieving both his bladder and bowels, and carefully washing as much of his nether regions as he could manage. As he exited the bathroom he saw Alexis approaching the bathroom looking concerned.
Dean stared at Cas.  His Cas, wearing a t-shirt that said ‘Bee Happy” which had a 3D crocheted bee on it.  His Cas.  Cas that was reaching out for Dean, his blue eyes full of concern and love.  “Cas?” Dean’s voice broke over that single word before pulling Cas into his arms.    He couldn’t speak.  He held onto Cas as though scared he would evaporate at any second.
- which is an awesome story.
Events after Dean and Castiel make love.
Alistair took a step forward, but Dean just racked the shotgun and tightened his grip.  The sound was loud and threatening in the quiet woodland.  “Don’t!”   Dean heard the rustle of movement, and out the corner of his eye, saw Benny step forward also holding a shotgun to back Dean up.
Dean found himself fixated on Cas's hands as he held the book. He was nervous. "I um wondered whether you wanted to maybe take a walk up top."
“Fucking faggots,” called out one of the boys.
Thanks as always to my amazing beta readers.  I bow to your talents.
“I’m good Dad.  Good to see you,” said Dean, dropping Castiel’s hand so he could hug his Dad properly.
"Er, great, OK." Dean stammered. "I'll grab a jacket." Dean walked away and almost tripped over one of the chairs. "Real smooth Winchester," he muttered to himself and he left the room.
“So, should I ask you to you fuck me now?”
“Gabe, this is Benny,” said Dean in a rush.  “He’s a friend of Cas’s too.  Where’s your gun?”
Castiel nodded.  “I have the same subject, follow me.”
"What?"
Dean put his head in his hands.  Given Gabriel’s reaction to the tags, he had a fair idea that the bracelet was also something sex related.  “Cas.  Take it off.”
“Missouri, if it means my pup’s OK, you can deliver him via my tonsils,” said Dean. “Please just make sure he’s OK?”
"OK, when you came, you didn't call me Cas. You said Castiel. I just wondered why?"
Confused Castiel held out his hand to Dean to take the tags, when Gabriel suddenly reached out and closed his hand around Castiel’s wrist snagging the black and red beaded bracelet that was now showing. Gabriel looked at it closely and then howled with laughter again.  He was laughing so hard, he couldn’t speak.
There was a larger louder group of people this time coughing the word “nerd”.
“Never mind.  Looking good Cas,” said Benny cheerfully slapping on his back.
“I wanna suck you,” said Dean gruffly.  “And what you said earlier about making love, I want that too.”
"Which one?" said Dean as he turned into the road.
Woo hoo.  You all made it this far.
He dialled the number for the delivery suite at the hospital, and waited for them to answer. A cheerful voice, finally answered with polite, “Birth centre, Patience speaking.”
“Really?” huffed Dean.
“No way,” said Sam stunned.
Surprised, Dean nodded.   “How’d you know?”
“I think it would be a good idea for you to take it easy,” said Missouri as she disposed of the needle in the used sharps bin. “If you haven’t finished working yet, I think you should.”
“Alistair and Gordon,” said Sam.
“I’m sorry.   I didn’t mean to startle you.”  Dean withdrew his hand and took a half step back as well.   Maybe he just needed a bit of space?
Castiel cut him off decisively by handing over a credit card, surprising Noah who had been looking at Dean expectantly.   “No. I like the items, we’re getting them.”
“I suppose we could,” said Castiel hesitantly.
Rubbing his thumb over the head of Castiel’s dick he could feel the drop of precum there, and used it to lubricate his movements.   He continued to mouth at Castiel’s neck and back, “Do you want me to stop?”
“We don’t have time for that, if you’ve made a dinner reservation for seven.   And I am not going to rush a single second with you.”  Dean said glancing at his watch, and Castiel’s hopeful face.   “Cas, I love it.  I can’t believe you planned all this.  You’re amazing.”
Dean stood up and started pacing the room, swearing under his breath.
“Gabriel,” warned Castiel, rubbing his hand over his face. “I’ve had a trying couple of days.”
Dean had prewarned his Dad that on the final Friday of their exams, he would be out all Friday night.   John nodded thoughtfully but said nothing.   Dean wasn’t sure if no comment was better than being lectured.
Sighing he knew that he couldn’t refuse Sam.
Castiel settled back into the pillows.   “Thanks.”
Dean glanced around and saw at least two other cronies of Alistair standing off to the side.   “I’m kinda in the middle of something right now guys.   Go home.  I’ll see you on Monday.”
After thanking Noah for his time and effort, they gathered their many bags of purchases, and with unspoken agreement made their way to the food court.  Both were ravenous after their long shopping trip.
“Sorry.  OK.   And I knew he didn’t like you, and was horribly homophobic, so I was kind of talking as though we were, you know, having sex, and I made a few references to you being gagged, so that would explain why no one heard you.   I threw in a few deeper sounding moans as your response.”
Gabriel tipped his head on side, in a move reminiscent of Castiel’s, “I know your father is away at the moment.   Have you two talked about where you’re going to stay for the week?  Has he asked you to stay here?”
Castiel was released on Friday, and Gabriel invited the brothers over for dinner.   When they arrived, there were a couple of other guests at the house.  Gabriel had also invited his old friend Kali, a lovely lady of Indian descent, who was visiting from California, and a tall thin English man, introduced as Zar.
After being out all Friday night, Dean felt like he should put in an appearance at home, and regretfully left Castiel a little after 6pm.    When he arrived home, John had made dinner, and the family enjoyed a meal of Spaghetti Bolognese, before they all sat down to play cards for the evening.
“You were there in spirit,” said Benny.
Falling into each other’s arms they hugged as though they needed each other to breathe.  Eventually they let go of each other, and instead pulled back to stare into each other’s eyes, before Dean kissed Castiel on his forehead and broke the connection.    Dean started the car, and Castiel let his hand rest on Dean’s leg, as they began their journey home.
“Sometimes we create our own when we aren’t sure of the official one, or we want to avoid spelling out words,” said Dean.  “Hey, did she give you a sign name?”
The police had confiscated the gun Dean used, but he was able to rescue his pocket-knife and blade from the ditch along with the blow torch, pan and the surviving kitchen knife.  Dean figured Gabriel probably wouldn’t want the one in Azzer’s leg back.
“Goodnight Angel.  Love you too.”
Dean smiled, “I thought, I mean you wanted…”
From Castiel, Monday 12.17pm.         Gabriel is ‘working’.  I am hiding in my room with noise cancelling headphones.  But thank you for your concern.  Gabriel has provided sustenance.
The conversation with his Dad went about as well as Dean could have expected.   Once he’d got over the initial surprise about situation, and the concern about Dean shooting and killing someone, he was keen to return to Lawrence as soon as possible.   Dean managed to persuade him that they were all fine, and it would be better to stick to the original schedule of John returning on Saturday.   At the back of his mind was the thought that if John came back sooner, they may leave Lawrence early, and he wanted to spend as much time with Castiel as possible.
This chapter is I think the longest, and the epilogue will be published immediately after.
Cas's deep voice soothed Dean in a way that he never noticed before. Dean looked at the bottle again, and at Cas and reached a decision. He carefully placed the bottle on the dresser and turned back to Cas. "For you, I'll try. For you I will try to be better."
“Yeah.”
“News travels fast in this town,” said Dean.
As always, many thanks to Sailor_fujoshi, without whom this fiction may have been deleted from my laptop and never finished.
Castiel wasn’t offended at the comment.  He knew that Sam was much more proficient than himself.   Despite Castiel’s height advantage, Sam would be a formidable opponent if wanted to be.
Castiel arched his back, at the sudden sensation, and swore loudly.  “Fuck!”
“All OK?” asked Sam.  He was obviously burning with curiosity.
It had been several weeks since Dean went to court and faced the Lafitte’s. Sam was convinced that Billie had both seemed somewhat sympathetic towards Dean, and unhappy with Noah’s behaviour and responses. However, being sympathetic wouldn’t necessarily mean a favourable outcome for their case.
“Yes, I understand.”  Dean was convinced that Castiel had subconsciously learned that via Gabriel.
The following day, Dean found several pages of English notes slipped into his locker from Castiel.  Dean tried to find Castiel to say thanks, but apart from spotting him in class a few times over the rest of the week, Dean could never quite manage to get to speak to him.  It was like Castiel was a ghost, disappearing quietly before Dean could approach.
“A little too well,” huffed Sam.  “I may need to buy an annual pass for the local cinema chain.”
“I’ll pick you up here at 4. Text me if you’ll be late.”
Castiel looked surprised.  “You want my number?”
Arms intertwined, Castiel rolled slightly and threw his leg over Dean, so he was gently pinning him down.  Their earlier release had taken the urgency away, and they were able to explore each other’s mouths and bodies without the fear of a premature ending.  Dean twisted his hips and pushed back, pushing Castiel on his back this time, and lying on Castiel’s chest.   Their faces were inches apart, and Dean ran a hand through Castiel’s hair, playing with it.  “I’ve never bottomed before, but I’d like to try, with you.  It’ll be a first for both of us.”
Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and left messages.   Whilst this story was completely written, some of your ideas and comments have been taken into account, and little snippets added where appropriate.  Thank you.
Thanks to numerous hunting buddies of their Dad, and the eclectic library of books that their Uncle Bobby let Sam read whenever they visited, Sam already knew large swathes of Latin, French, German and some Greek.   Sam also had an almost photographic memory, and Dean had made sure that Sam had already read every book that the mainstreams schools used for English Literature and language, learning with Sam along the way.   It was amazing what classics could be picked up for 25 cents at most thrift stores.  Where something very unusual or specific was required, well, the old five finger discount at the library took care of any problems.   Dean knew that Sam had a thirst for knowledge, and like a good older brother, did everything he could to feed it.   Although he was willing to concede that enhancing the Chemistry set, purchased for three dollars, with additional chemicals like phosphorous and sulphuric acid may not have been the smartest thing that Dean had done.   The toxic smells, smoke, and fire damage to the motel room they had been staying in was the stuff of legends in their family.  John had also promptly banned Dean from trying to teach Sam anything chemical related again.
“Dean,” yelled Benny when he spotted him.   Lee was with him, and they looked worried.  They both ran over to meet Dean and Sam and pulled them a little ways away from the crowd.  “It’s Cas.”
“Do it then,” said Dean firmly. Dean wasn’t a medical expert, but he trusted Missouri, and he would do everything he could to give Jack the best possible start he could.
“Jeeze, Cas, I’m sorry,” said Dean full of concern.  He started to withdraw, but Castiel grabbed his hands stopping Dean from moving.
“Thank you for everything,” said Castiel honestly.   “I don’t know what I would have done without you.”
“Dean, are you OK,” asked Patience with concern.
“Shit.  So do I.”  Dean dug through his pockets and pulled out his timetable.   “Any idea where Physics III is?”
Gabriel grabbed his car keys and indicated for Dean to get in Gabriel’s car.   “How bad?” Gabriel asked as he pulled out the drive.
“Well colour me impressed,” Gabriel with a grin.   “You know that’s the name for the super swotty Princeton, Harvard, Yale application group.”
“I did it.  Self-defence,” said Dean firmly.  “He had a knife and was going to attack me.  I didn’t mean to kill him though.”
“I don’t like it, but I got it.  You know this little gun ain’t accurate much beyond about 50 yards,” said Benny.

Cas sat back in the chair confused. "You want to know my intentions towards Dean?"
Dean shrugged at Gabriel, and followed Castiel into the garden, shutting the door leaving Gabriel in the house.
“Oh no honey,” Missouri reassured him quickly. “The injection would be in you but would benefit Jack. It would help his lungs mature a little more quickly. If your pup comes early, and I gotta be honest, I think he will, it will definitely help him.”
The scene with Dean at the cabin, was the first scene I had in mind for this story. (OK it was an actual dream, but you get the idea)
Castiel nodded and squeezed Dean's hand in acknowledgement.   "…ank you," he muttered.
Dean said nothing as he drove them home.   His stomach was full of little butterflies.   It was only a phone number.  But he couldn’t help the thrill that filled him when he thought of being able to contact Cas if he needed to.
“Brother,” he spluttered. “Not partner!”
“I don’t think I can express it with words,” said Castiel kissing him again.  “You trusted me enough to let me….” Castiel broke off burying his face in Dean’s neck.  “It was wonderful.  Thank you.”
Very slowly in a similar manner to how Cas had treated Dean last night, Dean gently trailed kisses down Cas's chest and stomach, before pausing and then gently licking Cas's cock. Dean had never felt any fascination before at another man's penis. But he decided there was no other word to describe Cas's, other than magnificent. It was large, and strong, and just perfect. At that moment Dean felt like it had been created, just for him. The girth perfectly fitted Dean's hand and it tasted just like Cas smelled. All warm with a hint of spice.
Grumbling, Dean hit the play button. “We’re going to have to work on that.”
Thank you to MalicMalic for correcting my Russian.  The sentences in this chapter are from a website of flirty lines in Russia.  Amazing what you can find on the internet.
Castiel walked with Dean to the front door, “I’ll text you, about coming round to teach me.  Bring Sam.  I’ll cook dinner.”
“I understand,” said Castiel warmly.  “Thank you for today. I really did enjoy our shopping trip, and spending time with you.”
Castiel looked up, he made a fist with his left hand, held his right hand index finger to his lips, and then dropped his right hand on top of left, flattening like a piece of paper.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas laughed.
Thank you to everyone who has left Kudos or comments.  Seriously they mean the world to me.    Shout outs to From_My_Dark_And_Twisted_Mind, Leela24, vrskaandrea, Cinders and MalicMalic for your efforts.
“Ready,” confirmed the man. With a little help from the stranger, Dean managed to lift the bike enough for the man to pull himself clear, and then pull the bike fully upright.
“What like Kevin got hurt?” said Dean.  He gripped the handrail on the porch.  “Run Kevin out of town did you?”
"Dean…" Cas moaned, and Dean felt a thrill of delight at being able to provide pleasure to Cas in that way. Dean smirked inwardly, he'd had plenty of practice of kissing, knowing it was a particular skill of his that previous partners had commented on. Dean reached up and whilst continuing to kiss Cas, removed Cas's tie and undid a couple of the buttons on Cas's shirt. Licking the exposed flesh, loving the taste of Cas as he did so. A moment later, Dean suddenly felt a draft as Cas lifted Dean's t-shirt from the waist and pulled it off over Dean's head. "Not using your mojo tonight," whispered Dean still undoing Cas's shirt buttons.
Gabriel glanced up and pursed his lips.  “Do I want to know why?”
Castiel waited until Hannah had served their drinks and pie and allowed Dean to take his pick of the two.  When Dean take a large mouthful of the warm apple pie the moan Dean allowed to escape as the taste exploded on his tongue was practically pornographic.
"How did you do with your supply run; How's Garth?" said Sam easily, glancing up at him and the large box of food he was carrying.
Gabriel pulled Castiel into a hug, the moment he was out of the car.    “You have got to stop worrying me like this,” Gabriel said emotionally.
“Bobby’s gut rot will blind you, if it doesn’t poison you first,” said John dryly.  “I figured you might be in the mood for the good stuff.  Exam’s finished and all that.”
Looking over at Dean, John released Sam, and pulled Dean into a back-slapping hug.  “How are you doing, son?”
“I’m glad I was there too,” said Dean.   “He’s a good guy.  He doesn’t deserve the shit he gets.”
Very slow, gentle, minimal movements by Cas distorted the muscles, as Dean watched. At first he thought Cas was dancing, but then Cas performed an intricate series of moves so slowly and gracefully, that Dean stood mesmerised. Although Dean didn’t practice martial arts, he realised that he was watching a true master perform some kind of kata. A series of predetermined moves to exercise and stretch the body, and train a kind of muscle memory into them.
Any semblance of restraint from Dean disappeared at that moment.  He smashed his lips to Castiel’s and gripped his shoulders.    The gentleness from earlier, disappeared in a mutual frenzy of grabbing and kissing.   Dean could feel Castiel’s muscles under his hands rippling and moving, and he loved it.   They kissed and rolled together like one entity.    Dean sucked a large hickey on Castiel’s collar bone, and Castiel moaned and gasped loudly.   Dean loved to hear him come apart underneath him.   Castiel pressed the advantage at one point, running a single finger along the underside of Dean’s cock.    Dean swore and grabbed Castiel’s hand, pinning it above his head, before diving back on Castiel’s mouth.  Dean held him loosely with one hand, whilst he used the other to caress Castiel’s cheek and jaw.
As he entered the kitchen, he saw Sam sitting at the table reading his iPad, an empty plate in front of him and half a jug of orange juice on the side. "Morning Kiddo!" said Dean as he grabbed a large glass from the draining board. He poured himself a glass of the juice, downing half the contents in one go before refilling the glass.
“Gabriel isn’t paying for this stuff,” said Castiel.   “I am.”  Castiel removed his wallet and showed Dean the credit card.   The name, Castiel Novak, was clearly printed below the card number.  “It’s my card.  Gabriel just keeps it for me.”
Cas sat down on the edge of the bed, almost as though he was preparing to run at a moment's notice, and nodded his agreement. Dean sighed, and turned to his chest of drawers. He rummaged for a moment before pulling out two sets of boxers and two t shirts. He handed a set wordlessly to Cas, and then pulled on the other set himself. He saw Cas's face fall slightly, but Cas silently obeyed the unspoken request. Dean then pulled a sock out his drawer and walked over to his bedroom door.
“Gabe,” warned Castiel.
They laughed and stepped back giving each other space.   “I’ll see you at school later,” said Dean.  It wasn’t a question.
Dean wanted to see his pup. “Can I see?” he croaked out weakly.
Dean shook his head quickly.
With a resigned sigh, Castiel allowed Gabriel and Dean to help him stand.  Once he was relatively stable, Dean took a firm grip on Castiel’s arm, making a show of closing his eyes in front of Castiel, before Gabriel quickly lowered Castiel’s jogging bottoms and boxers, lifting each foot carefully, and slipping on a pair of clean jersey PJ’s.
Dean admitted that other than a few items of clothing, he didn’t have much for Jack. He didn’t have a cot or crib for Jack, or even a car seat. He’d been too afraid to buy or plan anything due to the court case. He couldn’t bear the thought of going home to his apartment without Jack, and seeing a crib there. Castiel had pulled Dean into a comforting embrace, and then opened his phone, selected his Amazon account and told Dean to fill the basket with everything and anything he wanted for Jack’s room. At first Dean refused, but when Castiel had pointed out that if Dean didn’t select the items, Castiel would and he might get the wrong thing, Dean had taken the phone and carefully selected only the essentials, including a cot that could be converted to a bed later. When Dean had finished, Castiel selected delivery for the following Saturday, confirmed the order and checked out.
“Thank you, Ma,” said Castiel.
“Yes Sir,” said Dean and Castiel in unison.   They glanced at each other and smiled tenderly.
“Amen to that,” said Dean.
Withdrawing the gun from his pocket, Dean passed it over his shoulder to Benny, along with the spare clip. “I’m gonna approach from the East.  There’s better tree cover.  I’ll drop you off along the road. Use the tree line or any other scrap of cover to get as close as you can.   I don’t know if it will be just Alistair, or more of them.   I think it unlikely he’ll be waiting there.   He’ll want to see me there first before coming in.   That should give me enough time to set up a couple of things,” said Dean.  “Don’t worry about me.  Your only job is to protect Cas and get him out of there.  However else this plays out – leave me.  Got it.”
“Thanks for the warning. I guess I’ll see you soon then.”
When they arrived back home, Dean was surprised to see Gabriel’s car.  Inside, they found Sam, Castiel and Gabriel playing cards at the table.
John led them, as they walked back to their cars.  Mindful of safety, like he’d been taught, Dean opened the shot guns, so they couldn’t accidentally fire, and stowed them safely in the Impala’s boot.   Benny stashed the small camera’s they had used and suddenly yawned.  “Sorry Cher.   I guess the time has caught up with me.”
“I’ll tell you about it in the car,” said Dean.  He wanted to wait to speak to Gabriel before leaving.
Serving up the pancakes, Dean joined them at the table and sat next to Castiel, their legs touching under the table.
It was much later in the day when Cas returned to the bunker. He walked into the main room to find Sam seated at the map table.
Dean looked down at Jack, taking in his small frame. “It’s not good Charlie.” He said quietly. “He’s very weak.”
They lay facing each other, just smiling stupidly at each other for several minutes, before Castiel said, “I know this sounds formal, but um, thank you again for last night.”
“You OK kiddo?” said John with concern.
When Cas had looked at Dean, it was like all the air had been stolen from Dean’s lungs.   He couldn’t form a single word.    Cas’s blue eyes had fixed on Dean’s green ones, and they stared at each other in silence.   For Dean it felt like the world had stopped turning, and his entire focus was now on the six foot tall mound of human sprawled across his lap.  It was a cough from his brother across the table that broke the spell.   Cas had scrambled off Dean, blushing furiously, dropped to his hands and knees and starting picking up the books, now unable to look at Dean.
Shaking his head as an answer Dean flashed a glance at Sam.   His Dad picked up on it immediately.  “Well I think you boys deserve a treat tonight.  How about pizza?”
Dean didn’t have time to check where Castiel was, he and Alistair were facing off.  Dean watched Alistair’s movements carefully and it was clear he wasn’t properly trained.  Alistair was sloppy, relying on intimidation rather than prowess.  Dean might be unarmed, but he was still a better fighter.   He couldn’t reach the other knife he’d buried, Alistair was in the way.  He needed another option.
Dean’s blood ran cold, “Is he…?”
Dean backed away, giving Cas some space.  “I saw your magazine today.”
Dean felt like he was slowly being driven mad, and worshipped at the same time. As Cas lowered and dipped his head dropping kisses here and there, he felt his body respond in a way that had never happened before with any of his sexual partners, not even Lisa. His whole body felt like it was on fire and freezing at the same time. He wanted to reach out and touch Cas, but the whole situation seemed so unreal, he felt like one wrong move would shatter this perfect illusion. Almost as soon as the thought formed in his head, he heard Cas say, "shush my love. Keep still. I have you. You're safe." At that moment Dean realised he hadn't been relaxed and he'd been holding his breath. He exhaled, took another deep breath, and willed himself to not think anymore.
“They would probably serve you alcohol free beer if you wanted,” said Castiel.
Sam looked over.  Castiel looked peaceful, even with his badly bruised face.  There was a gentleness to the scene that made Sam smile.   Castiel asleep, with Dean’s right arm draped over Castiel’s chest and his left hand gently massaging Castiel’s scalp, carding through his hair.  Sam caught Dean’s eye and got up to adjust the duvet, so it covered Castiel, ensuring his back didn’t get cold.   He returned to his seat and focused back on the movie, only glancing across once or twice to check whether Dean needed something.
“What happened?” asked Dean.  The rush of adrenaline from his concern for Jack was still flooding his system. Sam had released his grip on Dean’s shoulders and was standing next to the bed.
**  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL  **  SUPERNATURAL **
“Try this,” said Castiel.  “да. Нет. налево. направо.”   (**Yes. No. Left. Right.)
The nurse checked the monitors, and looked puzzled. “Hmm. I’m not seeing them on the monitor.”
“You keep saying you’re just Cassie’s friend.  But I get the feeling there’s more to it than that,” said Gabriel.
“Who the hell are you, and what are you doing in my home?” the man asked loudly and commandingly.
The rest of the evening passed uneventfully, watching old episodes of Dr Sexy, that Dean had to explain to Castiel.  At ten, Gabriel swung by to pick up Castiel and take him home.   Dean went to bed feeling a little happier than he had in a long time.  Spending the day with Castiel on Saturday would be fun.
The top two buttons of Castiel’s shirt were already undone, he quickly loosened a third, before pulling the shirt over his head, as though it were a t-shirt, and tossed it behind him.   Now bare chested he raised an eyebrow at Dean, who blushed and pulled off his own t-shirt.
