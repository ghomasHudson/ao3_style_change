“Oh, yeah, this is perfect right now” John murmured under the sound of the crowd with a grin, recognising the song at once, and when he looked to Greg, the other man was grinning, as well.
The crowd’s noise swelled again, applause and vocal sounds filling the bar, but John felt like maybe the volume was just a bit less than when his and Greg’s names had been said. Just maybe.
That night, the prize was matching drinking steins with the K-Town logo on one side and ‘Couple’s Night Karaoke Champion’ on the other; the pot was further sweetened by the fact that said prizes could be refilled for half price drinks for the rest of that year.
Whichever category each couple chose, the song would be a random pick of those available, which gave the competition a bit more spice and made it a little harder on the contestants. The gigglers had been doing a lot of girl band power ballads and j-pop. The leather-clad pair had been doing mostly heavy metal. John and Greg’s choices of ‘classic rock’, ‘motown’, and the like had absolutely played to their strengths. It didn’t hurt that the crowd seemed to like them pretty well, too.
Their ‘normal’ now included Sherlock once again solving cases, though with a lot less recklessness in the face of danger, and being a pretty decent ‘uncle’ to Rosie; while John not only embraced his role as a father and best friend, but maintained other friendships to give himself a bit more of a healthy variety. One of those friendships being with Greg Lestrade, who’d stood by Sherlock over the years and who’d come to be a rather good friend to John, as well. Greg, who’d become something of another ‘uncle’ to Rosie, along with her Aunt Molly and Nana Martha, was actually a good sort to pal around with for John and yet another one willing to help watch Rosie now and then—though he had less time than any of the others for obvious reasons.
Greg came down the steps hugging anyone who held still enough, bussing people on the cheek randomly—John suspected he’d had more than the one pint while the last act did their bit—and then catching John and dragging him in to get loud smooches on the cheek and forehead. John was giggling a bit, returning the cheek kiss and then giving his friend a totally exaggerated smackeroo on the mouth. Both of them dissolved into giggles immediately and Greg went down the steps first, the two ‘karaoke groupies’, as Sherlock had labelled them, pulling him into more kissing with a lot more intent than John’s jokey version.
“Absolutely,” John agrees apropos of nothing he could understand, grabbing his jumper to cover the bulge in his trousers and heading for the door.  Where he collides painfully with Sherlock, who is standing, just standing there, his mouth pursed in concentration.
"Jesus, we've really got ourselves into it, haven't we?" John shakes his head. After several minutes, he forces himself to keep talking. "So, what would be something you would choose?"
"Not even if I ask you to?" There is an edge to Sherlock's voice, and John sees that his whole body is tense.  Not aroused, just tense.
“It was a little fast, I know, I’m working on it,” admitted John ruefully.  “Isn’t that what the morning after is for?”
And he couldn’t very well go on his own, having deleted a great quantity of information on acquiring ingredients just after moving to Baker Street.
And there are nights, somewhere between a few and many, when they lob guarded glances at one another, and John reaches out, and Sherlock grumbles, and they slow dance around each other until something gives, and then usually there is sex and usually it is fine, all fine, but not transcendent.
“No,” Sherlock dismisses the query, then hunches further in on himself.  John is obscurely insulted by the gallantry.
There is no residual heat from John’s side of the bed, and the covers have been pulled smooth.  Sherlock sees that John has retrieved his clothes, but left 5 golden hairs tangled in the pillowcase.  A restless sleep, then.  He wants to spend longer here, deduce John down to the last scattered clue, but he hears the chattering of a zip and the creak of a bed above him and it propels him into his dressing gown and up the stairs. It’s been a long time, and now he realizes that waking alone in a smooth bed was like looking over the edge of an abyss.  Remembering the lock, he puts his shoulder to the door, and falls into the room when it opens easily.
“So.” John picks up the conversational slack. “You’re the one who wanted data.  What happened?  You were surprisingly quiet for someone who was going out of his mind.”
Later, at uni, he intended to add to his database with a few strategically-chosen partners, but his plan derailed almost immediately, when the principles of pleasure he had derived so easily in isolation failed to apply in combination.  The same touch that he had quite clearly recorded as pleasureable on his own became awkward, cloying, aggravating, galling, and very deeply tiresome, and he abandoned the effort with the conviction that the data would be anomalous in any case. So it had been a very long time since Sherlock had indulged on his own, and forever since he had done so with another person.  And John had nothing to say about that.
It’s a breach of professional ethics, probably, but Ella has known him for years now, she's kept him alive long enough for Sherlock to take over the job more than once, and she smiles when they shake hands, as if his happiness and stability can be read from his fingernails or his haircut.
“Forty-six minutes,” answers Sherlock automatically, and when John frowns at him, he pulls out his mobile and clarifies “46 minutes and 25 seconds.”
Sherlock knew how it went.  The first 36 hours, a slight giddiness and a welcome bit of extra free time.  For the next 36 hours, there was clarity, euphoria, and lightning-fast reflexes, except at the 20 minute intervals marked by bouts of intestine-cramping drive to put something, anything, into his mouth.  John came in handy here, as Sherlock had learned that allowing John to bully him into one of his  occasional cuppas could prolong the not-eating by another two days.  In fact it got harder and harder to start eating again – because the getting there wasn’t easy, after all, and the urge to find out what happens next, what was around this particular corner, was so strong.  And because evading the increasingly subtle and tempting offers from John – half a poached egg cunningly forgotten amid the petri dishes looks like ambrosia to a man starving himself – that was half the fun.
, and besides that, John is catching on.  So the next time he hears a stray footfall, he all but leaps to attention, flies innocent, lube under the pillow.
Since then John’s been wanking morning and evening, and sometimes in the afternoon if he can get a bit of free time.  He is intensely and pathetically grateful to Sherlock for never bringing up the “coming in his pants” part again, and he doesn’t feel guilty now about appropriating Sherlock’s image for his personal pleasure, but still…
When Sherlock’s fingers resumed their lonely meandering, John reached down and undid his own flies and Sherlock just looked at him with alien eyes.  After several painful moments, he grated out “I don’t know – I mean – I do know, but not with someone else, not with you, or anyone...” And then, after more painful moments, “tell me… what to do…”
That afternoon, John appeared in his going out jacket just as Sherlock began emulsifying the watermelon.  John looked bemused but sounded unconvinced that disposal by emulsification was a viable criminal option, although Sherlock vigorously denied having tested that hypothesis, which John could have checked easily by counting the ears in the fridge. John looked faintly disgusted when Sherlock showed him the watermelon recipe, but leaned against the doorframe so long that he finally sat down to watch in comfort.
John reached up to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock closed his eyes contentedly.  John flipped himself towards Sherlock, maneuvered himself around Sherlock’s still curled up form, and nuzzled a bit at the side of his face.  Sherlock held his breath, but John didn’t stop. Instead he nipped playfully at Sherlock’s lower lip. Sherlock’s body coiled tight and his voice came out a bit louder than he wanted.
After a bit of wheedling, she agrees to explain the process to him, along with some wry warnings about the advisability of doing sex therapy without an actual therapist.  “Could be dangerous” notes John with a momentary grin, and she laughs as if it was a joke.
But his eyes rotating in their sockets must have been louder than he expected, because John stirred, frowned a little, as if uncertain why a large seastar-like being was scrabbled in next to his back, and then smiled as the identity of the mystery creature resolved itself.
All right then.  But first he needs to get himself together.  Not entirely to his surprise, he finds that 90 seconds is indeed more time than he needs if he is methodical and goal-oriented.  Then it’s a simple job to do up his flies and grab his jacket. Lacking a swirling coat to pull Sherlock in his wake, he settles for a hand grasping biceps, and keeps his mouth shut when Sherlocks demands an explanation.
"I've been taking classes," Sherlock informs him. "Did you know wikipedia lists 49 separate kinds of massage?"
Sherlock smiles at John sardonically, and John realizes he is breathing harder than the detective.  Much harder. “Got  a little off your count, then?” John manages.
After the artichokes were gone and he had drunk three glasses of brunello to Sherlock's one, John had smiled a bit fuzzily and suggested a movie. He eyes were closed almost before he got to the couch, but Sherlock followed anyway. It was his couch after all. He sat primly on one end and watched as John gradually relaxed into a sprawl, still smiling with his head tucked into one elbow. Sherlock steepled his hands and considered Lestrade's text, running scenarios and solutions in his mind, but it was like watching a jerky silent movie, not at all his normal electric flow from thought to thought. It was really quite difficult to think with John taking up half of the couch. Like a physical roadblock in his head. He scowled down at John and was surprised to see a hand, fingers, his own hand obviously, his own fingers running through John's hair. John's hair was soft, a bit coarser at his temples and the nape of his neck. Sherlock closed his eyes, wondering if he could identify the bones of John's skull from touch alone. He was really quite sleepy too. That must account for the jerky still-movie in his thoughts. It was ridiculous to be sleepy when he'd slept only the night before, but there it was. Perhaps artichokes or olive oil or mint had soporific effects. And John's hair, thousands upon thousands of individual strands, were tickling his palm. He thought he could probably count them by feel if he wasn't so sleepy. John Watson, he would say, did you realize that you average 335 hairs per square centimeter? And John would give him that quiet look that meant he wasn't sure whether to be impressed or worried, and Sherlock would veer off into murder weapons or the principles of retrofitting a secret room instead of saying I love you and wait, what? Secret rooms or murder weapons, then, or why beginners fail at lockpicking, or the best way to shoplift costume jewelry, although it wouldn't work if it was raining out, or essentials of surviving if kidnapped and locked in the boot of a small car...
Finally a glint of amusement breaks through John’s anger, and he says softly, “something with fewer syllables than ‘Vatican Cameos’?”
Sherlock makes an annoyed face and says “it’s a metaphor, John.  Like my mind palace.  Like you’ve given it legs and walked it into a new universe.”
When Sherlock finally abandons the go-pro and starts the timer, his hands are cool and his touch mechanical.  He palpates John’s left shoulder until he finds a knot and bores down on it before John can figure out how to direct him.  After that it’s an awkward two-step, John couching his language in careful elliptical phrases and Sherlock lurching from one instruction to the next.
"But you would let me do it, even though you wouldn't enjoy it.  And you wouldn't want to do it to me at all," Sherlock finishes bleakly.  "We're right back where we started."
John feels his lungs collapse inside him.  He closes his eyes and tries to stop his hands from tremoring. He feels that he's narrowly avoided mass destruction, and it's all he can do to keep breathing.
John could have sleepy, comfortable, middle-of-the-road, cuddly sex five nights out of seven without getting bored.  He is happy to burrow into Sherlock’s embrace, shelter against his solar plexus, curl up between his fingers.
But some quick calculations and cross-references of John’s schedule suggested that now John wanted more. And he was going about it in an aggressive manner all too likely to succeed -- flirting, dating, even bringing women to their flat where they quickly disappeared, giggling, up the stairs. Sherlock supposed that it was partly his fault, what with his trick with the cane and all.
“Fine.”  Sherlock blinked, wondering what John was agreeing to, as John’s fingers caught at the edge of his jumper, yanked it over his head, forcing Sherlock into a quick grab at the couch to avoid being dislodged. “I know what you want,” John grimaced.  As Sherlock tried to kickstart his brain, John calmly unbuttoned his shirt, oblivious to Sherlock’s precarious hold on couch or composure. “Right, then,” he concluded, leaning back, “look your fill,” and Sherlock realized he was meant to be looking at John’s scar.  Because apparently John had noticed, really John was quite perceptive when it came to certain things.  That wound, that scar – the actual physical presence hidden by horrid jumpers and stripey pullovers, and why did John never just wear a simple tee? – but its consequences so obvious to a man who couldn’t help but notice everything, every tiny inconsequential detail around him.  So Sherlock was not so much actually looking at the scar as he was comparing the real, flesh-and-blood scar with the one he’d created in his mind, built from every small observation of John, from the way his shoulder hitched sometimes when he took a gallon of milk from the fridge, to the way he twisted slightly to open a cab door.  He traced each line of the scar with his eyes, correcting the geometry and colouration of his private version as he went, soothed back into a languorous contentment again.
Then John’s warm hands were strong on his arms, squeezing him together and the voice out of his head.
2. John has installed a lock on the inside of his door.  Of course it’s only operable when he’s actually in the room, but that’s fine, since being in the room is what’s getting him in trouble in the first place.
“No,” agrees John, “not at that volume.  That plus the nightmares I’ll no doubt have, there won’t be any trouble convincing a therapist.”
And finally John took pity on him.  In a low, careful voice he described how Sherlock could trail his fingers up the back of John’s hands, how to find the pulse points under his wrist, how to press kisses into the crook of his elbow.  He described how to use the tip of his tongue to draw a meandering line down John’s throat, how to lick along his collarbone, how to catch the nipple between his teeth and tug and what that would do to him. He described how Sherlock could press his palms against John’s belly and follow the sparse trail of blondish hair to his cock and how to encircle it and where the sensitive spots were.  And Sherlock knew it all already, it was simple anatomy, but in John’s rough, longing voice it came out like poetry.  When John fell silent, Sherlock’s own skin was tingling, burning, too tight for his bones.  He squeezed his eyes shut and breathed deep to trick his brain and reached for John and put John’s fingers on the back of his hand, then John’s tongue on Sherlock’s throat, then John’s palm on Sherlock’s belly.  Sherlock squeezed his eyes tighter still because god help him it was hard to keep that brain at bay, but he could, because everywhere that John touched he left a warm writhe of comfort with a hint of fire, and when his hand reached Sherlock’s waistband, Sherlock undid it shakily and was glad that when John’s hand got to his cock, there was something there to encircle.  Not an obvious bulge like John, nowhere near hard, but at least there was some evidence of effort, Sherlock thought.
Beyond his head, John heard Sherlock say loudly, “I’m going to steal your partner away home, Lestrade.”
Coming back to the mic, the MC got the crowd quieted down once more and said in his best gameshow host voice, “Greg and John! Get up here, gents!”
“I know, I know,” Greg agreed with mock mournfulness. Clapping a hand to John’s nearer shoulder and looking from him to Sherlock and back, Greg nodded approvingly. “It’s about time. Have a great weekend, you two.”
“I thought there was more to your nights out with Lestrade than ‘having a few pints’,” Sherlock said with a knowing hint of a smile, voice just barely loud enough for John to hear over the beginnings of the next couple’s final number. The gigglers were doing another j-pop piece, or so it sounded, and the crowd’s attention had shifted to them accordingly.
Blinking in astonishment, John opened his mouth to comment on the believability of such a statement coming from Sherlock, but Greg returned just then with his and Sherlock’s drinks, putting the tumbler of scotch before the detective while keeping his own pint glass in-hand. Sherlock looked as though he would relinquish his seat back to Greg, but Greg waved him off.
Once upon a time, John might’ve been a little prouder of his more toned legs and flatter belly—he doubted he’d ever have the abs he’d sported in his army days—but he was a lot less self-focussed of late. His motherless daughter and his reclaimed best friend keeping his attention most of the time; well, except for that particular day, which had seen John alone in the flat most of the afternoon and, if things went as expected, would lead to more of the same for most of the evening, too.
There wasn’t a one of them who hadn’t been in therapy since then, including John; especially John, whom Sherlock had somehow forgiven for all his failings as a friend, but who’d been working quite hard to forgive himself.
The MC said their names again, officially declared them the winners of the ‘Couples’ Night Karaoke Competition’ steins, each of which had a tightly rolled t-shirt stuffed into it, and handed them off to more enthusiasm by the audience and even some of their fellow contestants—John was surprised to see the leather-clad couple and several of the couples eliminated in earlier rounds applauding in front of the stage. Greg and John hugged each other laughingly, Greg hugged the MC and John shook his hand half off before they headed off the stage with their arms around each other, holding their steins high.
John and Sherlock both groaned long-sufferingly and Rosie laughed, squirming away from her two fathers and going to fetch Mrs. Hudson over to the kitchen.  “Daddy really liked the card,” she related on the way, expression bright with happiness.
John waited for the joke reveal, for a response inside himself that was negative, for… what? For the sky to fall? Nope. Instead, he held on a little tighter, hoping he hadn’t banged his victory stein into Sherlock’s back to hard, and let himself realise that he couldn’t think of anything he’d like more right that moment than to kiss him again.
Her smile was, despite the cliché of it, like the sun coming out from behind the clouds.  Sherlock smiled in response and was prepared when she threw herself at him for a vigorous ‘Watson’ style hug: warm and snug with a hum of happiness when it was returned.
If it weren’t for Sherlock’s smile—not at all mocking, it seemed—John might have been embarrassed to be ‘found out’ that way. “Well,” he said, tipping his head to the side humorously, “sometimes it really is just us tossing back a few and going home.”
“Come here, you,” rumbled John, pulling Sherlock into the hug, slightly squashing Rosie between them.  He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, and then his lips, and then drew him close again with a hum of contentment.  “I am the luckiest man in the world.”
Rosie rolled her eyes and sighed impatiently.  “Okay, but is it good enough?”  She fidgeted her fingers together rolling and hooking them in one another as she stood next to Sherlock at the kitchen table.
John, as they’d both been doing, mimed playing instruments in between singing backup or chorus, or whatever was appropriate. In this instance, he made as if he were playing a keyboard, but he was dancing in place the whole time, just as many an electric keyboard player had done on many a stage. Greg was moving to the music, too, and as the music built toward the chorus, he grabbed the mic and tilted it on its stand just as John leaned in to sing the chorus with him, their shoulders coming to rest against each other like they’d planned it. “But at night it's a different world. Go out and find a girl. Come on, come on and dance all night. Despite the heat it'll be alright.”
A chuckle, small though it was, moved John’s shoulders, his head lifting briefly. Giving another glance to the book he’d laid aside, even as the oscillating fan blew another stream of vaguely cooler air at him, John shook his head and tapped out another text.
The MC tapped the mic loudly and waved the noise down after a few minutes. “Now, as with each round before, you must all indicate your preference between the last two couples by your applause. I think you know what to do… Greg and John?”
Now, the therapy had been reduced to occasional visits—for John and Sherlock, both—and the two of them seemed to be closer again, almost as they’d been early on in their association as flatmates and friends. John had moved back into Baker Street, which had been rebuilt and renovated, including a surprising amount of child-proofing, and things had eventually become… normal. Well, maybe not everyone else’s idea of normal, but closer to it than in the past.
Looking around the sitting room, giving the tiniest philosophical tilt to his head, John sighed as he tapped out an answer,
“Thank goodness,” Sherlock muttered against John’s lips as he captured them again, this time a lot less platonically. John was so much more than okay with that.
Rosie nodded vigorously.  “Papa printed out the art I found on a colouring book site so I could colour it pretty for your card.  Look inside, Daddy!  Look!”  She was bouncing on her toes as she hurried him breathlessly.
Casually looking in the direction Sherlock had indicted, John saw one of the three ladies who’d greeted him coming off stage a few minutes before and the film-star handsome man who’d been right behind them. John was torn between blushing and sniggering like the teenager he hadn’t been for decades or saying something clever and urbane, but ended up blushing a bit and saying without thinking, “Where were they back when I was single?”
“Yes, Dad!” Greg sneered cheerfully, but winked with another nod before reaching up to ruffle Sherlock’s hair and saunter off to his two new friends.
John turned away from watching Greg getting happily mauled and found himself swept into an enthusiastic hug, which he returned automatically. He was on the second-to-last step and it wasn’t until the person hugging him put their lips to his that his senses caught up to him and thwacked him in the back of the head—mostly metaphorically. The sensations of full, warm lips, a solidly muscled but lean body, huge hands spread upon his upper back and at his waist, and the secondhand taste of scotch were overridden by the familiar scent combination that he would have known with his eyes closed and one nostril tied behind his back. Sherlock?
single,” Sherlock pointed out after a moment. When John turned to him, lips parted, half in shock and half in puzzlement at himself, Sherlock wore a strange sort of frown. His eyes searched John’s face, focus going from there down to his hands—the right clenched inside the curve of the left, atop the table—and then he spoke in a deliberately light tone, “That is, unless you and Lestrade have more to reveal than your hidden karaoke talents?”
“That’s a great idea,” Greg replied, his voice revealing that he was probably grinning like a fool. “Saves me heartlessly ditching him later.”
Though he’d hardly noticed the people around them once the impact of who was hugging him and kissing him, the sound of catcalls and Greg sodding Lestrade going, “OooOooo!” like they were twelve-year-olds penetrated just enough to make his face go hot.
“Sherlock!” Greg’s surprised-sounding voice came from beyond John’s left shoulder. “What’re you doing here?”
At the end of the song, John and Greg got a raucous standing ovation that lasted several minutes before the MC went up to pave the way for the other couple—the gigglers—to do their final number. John followed behind Greg to the stairs at the end of the small stage, laughing out loud as a couple of women grabbed him for enthusiastic praise involving bouncy hugs and far more than flirty kisses.
Rolling his eyes on a much louder and huffier sigh, John sat upright as he pressed the tiny keys as rapidly as he could manage and still make sense. Just because he’d gradually come to realise his affections for his friend and flatmate were deeper than he’d been able to acknowledge in the past didn’t mean he was going to act upon them and ruin the friendship he’d fought so hard to regain; nor was he going to let that sort of teasing go unchallenged, though Sherlock had never really seemed to pay it any mind.
“It was all Rosie’s idea,” Sherlock told him almost solemnly, though his lips were still curved into a lesser version of a smile and his eyes bright.
John was chuckling a bit as he pried himself loose from his chair, tucking his phone in the cargo pocket of his shorts, and going upstairs to change. On his way out a while later, John texted Sherlock.
“I know!” John replied, having to practically bellow over the even greater noise of the crowd’s approval.
Sherlock made a breathy little almost-laugh, but if he’d planned to say something further, the end of the last song in the karaoke competition interrupted whatever it was by drowning anything and everything out with shouts and applause. John thought it might’ve been louder than what his and Greg’s last number had received, but then they’d never expected to really win—certainly nice if it could be had, but not expected—only to have a good time. John, and he was pretty certain Greg, too, had enjoyed himself immensely, win or not.
Nodding, knowing what Sherlock’s implicit question was from the obvious clues—well, that and knowing the man so well for so long—John got control of his jaw and the slow, wondering grin welling up in him arrived on his face as he said, “Yeah. Yes.”
“Oh, bugger!” John said as he stopped short of the taller man, one hand on the bloke’s chest, looking up. “I’m sorry, I—oh!” He felt a sort of shock and a burst of something like surprised glee. “Sherlock?!”
“Oh my fucking god, John!” Greg said loudly as he caught John’s arm and nearly hauled him bodily up the short few stairs to the stage.
When their names were called to come up for their final song, John and Greg bounded up onto the stage, a bit sweaty despite the cool air blowing down from a vent over the stage, but still having a great time. They chose Classic Rock from the 60’s as their category, the alternative being Top 40 this time, and the screen showed them title of the song a moment later.
Lifting one brow, Sherlock gave a nod past John’s other side, leaning close to murmur, “I believe those two would like to be
The leather-clad couple came in third, finally encountering a song they hadn’t known well enough to avoid stumbling, leaving the gigglers to face off against John and Greg in the finals.
In seconds, the music started and Greg stepped into the mic to start singing right on cue. “Hot town, summer in the city. Back of my neck getting dirt and gritty. Been down, isn't it a pity, doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city. All around, people looking half dead, walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head…”
The MC waited a couple of minutes for the noise to start dying down before he motioned for quiet again. “Same again, Yolanda and Cheryl?”
“Nah, stay,” he said off-handedly, attention caught by one of the women who’d been so eager to kiss him after their performance. “I’ll be back in a bit.” His grin went flirty at the woman and John snorted, shaking his head and chuckling.
“Looks like I’m all yours,” John said, a little breathless with the words and how he was coming to understand just how much he really meant them.
That morning, Sherlock’s parents had swooped into town to take Rosie with them for a weekend at the seaside. Although the rift between Sherlock, Mycroft, and their parents had taken a while to heal after the events two years prior, when a third Holmes sibling had been revealed in the most terrifying and horrible way imaginable—John, as well as Sherlock and Mycroft, having nearly been killed—Sherlock had come away something of a changed man. He had continued to visit his sister in the once-more-secure facility in which she resided, the two of them playing violin duets for hours, but he had also pushed his parents to change their attitudes toward Mycroft and Sherlock, himself, as well as to try to accept what had happened with their lost and found daughter and move forward.
“He’s pretty bloody good, actually, yeah. Come on, then, have a seat,” Greg urged, gesturing for Sherlock to take his slightly padded wooden chair. “Want anything?”
Five minutes later, after John had shaken his head with a little smile and tucked away his phone again, it jangled and vibrated again. He found a second message from Sherlock.
“Right, right,” John placated, opening the card.  “Oh, let’s see… a poem?”  John scanned it quickly—his typing might never be anything approaching ‘fast’, but there was nothing wrong with his reading skills—and, after a soft gasp, he pressed his lips tight and looked down at his daughter with rapidly dampening eyes.  “Rosie, this is… the best poem I’ve ever read,” he managed, voice roughening enough that he had to stop and clear his throat halfway through.  “This is going right on the mantel.  Thank you, sweetheart.”
Half the people in the bar were singing along by the chorus, the song not only well-known after more than 50 years, but more than a little timely, considering London’s ongoing heatwave. John surrendered to the moment, dancing and spinning, leaning into Greg on the choruses and egging on the audience with winks and grins. They both gestured to the crowd to join them as the song neared its final chorus, ending up with most of those at the front-most tables standing and waving their hands or clapping along, apparently all of them singing by that point.
“You did,” acknowledged Sherlock with a nod. Looking past John and then around the bar at the crowds enjoying the karaoke contest, he then returned his gaze to John, his smile going a bit wistful. “I ran out of experiments.”
Shaking his head and guffawing, John licked his lips and wished himself anywhere else; what had he been thinking, revealing not only his bisexuality, but far more than Sherlock probably cared to know? “No, that’s… nope.” He looked around, finding Greg standing against the wall that ran behind the stage, the woman he’d gone over to chat up practically glued to his side and a man—possibly the one that had snogged him coming off stage—pretty much playing opposite bookend on his other side; all of them a bit flushed and smiling at one another with increasingly blatant intent. “Though I’m wondering if this karaoke couple is breaking up, as well.”
John gaped in happy shock, turning to Sherlock to find him grinning in obvious happiness for John’s own excitement. Standing, John looked around to find Greg approaching, but stopping part of the way to him and beckoning for John to go up on the stage with him. Giddily caught up in the excitement, certainly fueled by the momentum of the events that evening and the pints John had been having since they’d arrived, he barely had the presence of mind to shout, “Be right back!” to Sherlock before joining Greg to accept their win.
“I wouldn’t have thought there was such a thing as a karaoke groupie,” Sherlock said dryly before taking a prim sip of his drink.
“Surprise!” Rosie sang out as soon as he was stopped in the open doorway of the sitting room, then she grabbed Sherlock’s nearest hand and tugged it as she shouted, “Happy birthday, Daddy!”
John smiled fondly, assured that Sherlock was in a good mood by his phrasing and that he would be eating thanks to Molly. He promised himself he would get something really nice for Molly on her birthday. With that worry dismissed, he was free to relax and enjoy tossing back a few with Greg. Amongst other things.
John is no consulting detective, but even he realizes that in the absence of footsteps heading down the stairs, Sherlock must be sitting, standing, or draping his long body over the landing.  He tests the waters with “Buggering shit,” and when that produces no response, he continues on with “Jesus fucking christ on a trampoline,” more softly but with great feeling.  He hears Sherlock bounce once on his sulky toes and blinks, a sudden picture in his head.  Not Jesus on a trampoline -- he might say it, but the image is beyond silly -- no, what he sees is Sherlock, his long limbs splaying, his impossible curls ricocheting, his one-size-too-tight aubergine shirt straining to the breaking point.
The next morning, after a bout of furious texting, John offered the yogurt to Mrs. Hudson, which made Sherlock quietly happy.
“And I don’t want a show,” Sherlock manages in a barely neutral voice.  “I love you,” he adds, as if that explains something.  When John doesn’t move, Sherlock slowly lowers his forehead to John’s shoulder, then slots himself behind John and tips them onto the bed.   His lean body curls around John protectively and they are quiet for a long time.
"Under the circumstances..." offers the other man wryly.  Then, when John looks unlikely to bite, he adds "Let me know if you get bored with him."
When Sherlock only looked at him expectantly, John repeated again, “Not sure I follow.  What about Thursdays?”
At home they move softly around one another and have small conversations that seem very important without any actual meaning. Sherlock even nips out for the shopping and returns triumphant with a gallon a milk and seventeen carrots.  When John asks what experiment he has planned involving carrots, Sherlock looks perplexed, and John tries to figure out how to fit it all in the fridge.
“Should I—“ John starts, but Sherlock waves in one of his quick, undefinable gestures, rolling his eyes a bit as he does, and John stays where he is.  He had thought that going first would allow Sherlock to ease in and feel more comfortable, but he’s not sure now that he was right.
John stitched him up with only a few extra jabby parts, and fetched an extra blanket for sleeping on the couch. Sherlock did feel a little sorry about that part, but after he’d mistaken a street sign for a hippopotamus and tried to talk the wallpaper into changing colors, he supposed that John had made the eminently logical choice.
“Rosie! Let’s go to the park!” he shouted. He dropped the toy on the sofa and walked over to one of the doors. Katsuki leaned forward and touched one of the bumblebee’s wings.
Holmes looked decidedly uncomfortable, avoiding Rosie’s glare. She could look frightful when she was angry, Ellie decided.
Holmes finished his song and gingerly put the violin on the desk beside him. He didn’t turn around, but stared down into the streets below.
Most of the time, the loved ones want to know how everything was going. Some even want to know details. Others want to talk them out of doing their job. Others again think that if they hold up Ellie and Katsuki for a bit longer, their beloved will stay with them for a bit longer. It is a lie that is commonly believed.
“I don’t...didn’t need her to fulfil anything.” He looked up at Watson; their eyes met. Holmes gaze was filled with so much more, as if he tried to convey what he actually wanted to say with his eyes alone. His eyes which were the palest blue, the colour of an early morning sky in late spring.
Next to her, Katsuki had his fists clenched, and his face scrunched up in an attempt to not burst into tears like Ellie. She suddenly felt very foolish.
Ellie hoped she had conveyed everything without lying or frightening Rosie. She didn’t say anything, and continued staring at her father. Doctor Swift brought up a hand and placed it on her shoulder. “Okay,” she finally said, and Ellie gave her a last reassuring smile before she put on her helmet.
“Oh god, I’m such a bad hostess,” Rosie said and hurried over to the cabinets to retrieve some cups and a packet of teabags. Ellie wanted to wave it off, but Rosie insisted and only sat down when everyone had a cup of tea standing in front of them.
When her eyes adjusted to her surroundings, she spotted the tiny bee on the coffee table just between the two chairs. Rosie was sitting on one of the chairs, crammed into something like a high chair so she wouldn’t fall off it. She was gnawing away on her fist, her big green eyes fixed on the person in front of her.
Rosie spoke into the content silence. “Say, how’s it going with” but Ellie couldn’t understand the name she said. It sounded like a word in another language, but at the same time, it was complete silence.
“Stop worrying,” says John.  “I spent half my 13th year at the local swim club flipping off the high dive, and the other half jumping off walls and landing on my head.  It’s already been damaged to the extent possible.”
It’s tempting to stay as long as Sherlock will have him on the narrow couch, but John can already feel his shoulder stiffening inside him, and he has a shift in the morning, so by midnight he makes to get up.  Sherlock rises as well, but when John turns toward the stairs, the detective tugs on his sleeve and asks, in a barely audible voice, “Stay with me?”
“It doesn’t have a lock, and I don’t need to lock it, it’s the door to my room, Sherlock,” John starts with exasperation, but works his way up to a shout.
He considers a list titled “What Sherlock tolerates”, but that’s a bit self-serving really, and John doesn’t have the stomach for it.
There is a careful approach fraught with secret codes and passwords that change from week to week, monsters that roam and quicksands and shifting tides. There is nothingness. There are echoes of shouting, and insults that can interpreted in multiple ways.  There is (somedays) a tipping point, though it shifts continually in the shimmering landscape, and some days Sherlock is happy to tumble over it and other days he digs his heels and fingertips into the bare rock and pouts.
“I told you, John, more than once in a month is completely redundant.  I just wanted you to understand.”
Sherlock nods almost absent-mindedly, and continues, as if he never paused “every relationship I had, the other person wanted... just wanted… not wrong, but not what I wanted.  And either they weren’t worth the trouble, that was fine, just end it there… or they were, maybe, and then we argued and they tried to be sensitive and I tried to be … accommodating.  I’m good at that you know.”  John grimaces, remembering how many times he’s seen Sherlock shamming.  “Until I got bored,” continues Sherlock. “And then it would end too.  Not fine.”
Sherlock just looks puzzled, so John clarifies, "Is there anything physical that you enjoy? Sometimes the strangest things -- when Bill saw me, he knew that touching or teasing were out, and he let me get in a fight with him. Something like that?"
"Oh, you're here, I suppose you may as well eat," he huffed, pleased to see that John was already sitting down to table with no invitation at all. He plunged into his own risotto, leaving John staring at an empty place. John squinted at him, rose and placed the diminutive bottle of garlic oil next to Sherlock’s glass with exaggerated care, and only then retrieved a plate from the cupboard. He had barely served himself when Sherlock rocketed out of his chair, snatched the lemon from him, and zested it carefully onto the mound.
"Well, really more of a private tutorial. Even massage therapists need favors, you know,"  Sherlock clarifies, and then falls silent again.
He puts the lock on carefully and tells himself that he wouldn’t want to upset Mrs. Hudson with holes in her woodwork.  He sweeps up the bit of shavings and then scuffs over the floor to erase the evidence of sweeping.
John gets gooseflesh hearing Sherlock voice gone husky, his eyes wide and black, a slight flush on his cheeks, his tongue darting out to wet his lips, and John thinks
John wants to make a point about privacy, feels a need to set some boundaries and establish healthy communication about this, but fuck, as soon as he allowed himself to linger just for a moment on the memory of Sherlock’s breath on his skin and the faintest brush of his lashes and the moist heat of his tongue when he licked his lips, John is lost.  He is worse than lost.  The presence of those same lashes and lips and tongue in this room with him, even if they are gazing at him earnestly from over near the door, overwhelm his rational mind and he gives himself over to the movement, the push and pull, the warmth and tightness and building waves of pleasure, the incredible rightness of it all, until he tips happily giddily dizzy over the edge.
"I can do very well even alone. As soon as I've finished eating, "I said, but evidently too late, since he had already finished.
I reached the house of the sick boy and found Father Baen uttering some prayers, while he made the sign of the extreme anointing on the forehead of the boy, who was breathing weakly, his face now pale.
Sherlock caught me again by surprise and started laughing. I felt my hands clasp my hips and realized the position in which we found ourselves. From the shame, I felt my face flush.
"Whenever possible, I would need a hand. I must get rid of some things, if you were kind enough to give me assistance, you will be grateful, "I said with a note of sarcasm.
I couldn't see electric light as far as my eyes could see. So as far as logic rebelled against this idea I knew within myself that I was no longer in the twentieth century.
"I was saying how much this evening Miss Leary is beautiful do not you find Mr. Holmes too ?!" I asked in a mischievous tone. Holmes did not even look at the girl as he answered in a neutral tone.
"I know that your last wound is right at your left shovel right here", doing so hit me with force in that same spot with the hilt of the sword. And I backed away from the pain, clumsily slipped and fell to the ground on the straw and Sherlock, caught the moment disarming me and pointing his sword to my throat.
I kicked him in the middle of his legs and a head. Just to make him move and get away, but the moment lasted only a few moments because I felt his hands affirming my ankles and dropping me on the ground. Then a man in Kilt threw himself on the soldier by hitting him in the head and making him faint. The man in kilt then beckoned me to follow him as he spoke in Gaelic and after taking me behind a trunk to hide from the British troops, I felt something hitting me in the neck and everything became dark.
"Oh... Johnny, I missed you so much "his hands had begun to caress my face and neck, while I felt his warm breath on my face. Oh God... please touch me!
Hello everyone. I wanted to thank all those who have and are reading this story. But I'd like to know what you think. Let me know and see you soon.
"Well ... here, I really am here for you. I have to change the bandage. You see? I brought the necessary ", I pointed to the basket I held in my hand.
"Frank, I didn't..." tried to get away for a moment, for fear. I was no longer the same guy who had departed to help in the war. I was back broken and poorly reduced. On the body I had scars and signs that would never go away and especially the bullet hole on the left shoulder, not pleasing to the eye. I feared that once he had seen me he would have escaped disgusted.
"I come from you as a consanguineous and ally. But I will not give you any votes. Because I have already solemnly sworn on the name I carry. I give you my obedience, as my kinsman and my lord. I consider myself bound by your will, until my feet rest on the territory of Clan MacKenzie. "
"Sherlock, Dougal says you'll have to stay behind this troublemaker and you'll sleep in the stables tonight. Good luck. "Saying this he staggered back, evidently drunk, from where he had come.
"In the twentieth century it did not seem changed much. Last night I heard the bartender in the pub turn to us calling Saxons "I remarked to the reverend that he answered immediately chuckling under his mustache.
"The MacKenzie greet the men in Leoch. He hopes they have made a good trip. And that never comes the day when the clan's warriors have to draw their swords, but if it happens, he does not imagine men better than those in front of him today to defend the honor of the Clan. Only one fool could challenge the MacKenzie with or without weapons. And he is proud to be their laird. "
Suddenly one of the servants dropped a tray and Mrs. Hudson approached her, whispering words of comfort and giving her permission to go home to her children.
Nobody spokes to me and the whole group looked at me as if they wanted to slaughter me from one moment to another.
When I got to the stables, I saw Sherlock inside the fence with a nice white horse, intent on turning it around him. I was fascinated, so focused and seemed to be one with the animal. And his black curls moved with the wind, revealing his pale, elegant face in the sunlight. As I approached the fence, I dropped a cup, causing a state of agitation in the animal and Sherlock fell badly backwards.
"This is not my blood, not all at least" he did to approach me and I tried to overcome it, while I was blocking the escape route.
Sherlock leaned over and started untying himself from the wheel. His face was so close that I could feel his breath on my face. I found myself staring at him fascinated. His gaze met mine and for a moment I held my breath. Time seemed to stop. His lips seemed to me the most beautiful thing my eyes had ever seen.
"Of course, I do not think I have anything better to do," I said, pointing to a smile. When I looked up at him, I think he could feel my sadness, so he put a hand on my shoulder and left in silence.
"How would it be 'too'? V-you want to say ... "once again I did not have time to finish the sentence, I was left behind.
Suddenly a gunshot made me jump. From behind some trees I caught the soldiers in costume with the white and red English uniforms, with a rifle in hand.
I'm about to go on vacation so I'll see you again with a new chapter in both Italian and English in about three weeks. Greetings and see you soon.
Fortunately, I had read somewhere, how to dress a kilt. I had to try a couple of times before achieving a decent result. I felt terribly discovered.
"Are you ready John, are you ready for me?!" and so it happened after so many years and a long time apart, Frank was back with me in my arms. At first it seemed that he was afraid to hurt me, but soon after his thrusts sped up, as well as our breath and the squeaking of the bed.
We rode for several hours. We arrived at the foot of a mountain with a strange form from the tail of a rooster.
"Near the brook he was talking to a certain captain of our acquaintance, but it did not seem to me one of them."
He pulled out a small ceramic jar. Inside was a thick cream that looked like honey, but if you sniffed carefully it released a scent of wild herbs and whiskey.
"So, kid, you had a good earshot," he advanced leaning against the pillory. "There is no need to complain so much, a little shot and it's over" the figure of the boy was trembling.
"And you did it in the end you brought it to a place of peace, and it's the best when you're dying. So thank you. "
"More than an escape, it seems to me a suicide project," he said in his pedantic and irritating tone.
"Captain of the British Army Dragoons and your direct ancestor" I got up and headed for Frank at the desk.
"I do not know if you are or not. I just say it would be better to leave Sherlock quiet during the rally. "
"I am an educated man, if I can be frank. Maybe not as educated as you are. But I had a very good preceptor. He taught me Latin and Greek and much more. Not children's stories of fairies, devils and aquatic monsters of the lakes. "I laughed.
"Thank you, then I'll boil it in the future. Well ... I would still like to talk to you about Victor, but I still have to finish preparing some things for the hunt. "
"I ... I'm so sorry. It must have been a horrible experience, "I told him, unable to form an equally comforting sentence for him. Sherlock started moving and I blocked him.
Holmes approached me and without speaking offered me the arm to accompany me to sit, while the minstrel continued to start playing.
"Listen to me, you're going to break my arm. You have to indent the bone in the right position before you put it back into the joint. "
"It seems that the captain has commanded Fort William's fortress for about five years, it seems that they have raged against the Scots on behalf of the Crown," said the Reverend.
"Why never? We are fighting is it possible to touch the opponent, no?! "he said with a mischievous look, moving his pelvis slightly.
"It's the punishment for those who steal, it's already so much if they cut off their hands. Surely, he had stolen a loaf of bread from the baker. It's not unusual, it often happens. "
"They do not trust, that's why they exclude you. Dougal definitely hates you, but he hates everyone. "
"I am the disciple of God, you do not have the authority to cast out the devil. Get out of this house immediately. "
We approached the pillory. Holmes put his foot on the step and leaning his elbow on the leg leaned toward the boy.
"Saxon you have to eat, your face is pale, it would be able even a Czech to notice that you have clearly lost weight since we left, you barely touched food. You have to get back into force if you want to survive, "he said, staring straight into my eyes.
"If I have to be honest, you are the only friend I can talk to without feeling judged. Wrapped up I really feel like a stranger in a foreign land ", I sat in one of the chairs by the fireplace.
"Satan is pleased to make fun of God, but God will have the last word" so saying Father Baen came out of the house and slammed the door.
"Go, I do not want to hold you back. There are women waiting for you. Take the wine and share it with your friends. "
"Apparent? Excuse me but I do not think this is the most suitable term. I have been threatened, mistreated and kidnapped. I would say I was more than "apparently confused", sir, "I said through clenched teeth, I felt offended.
"Did you miss it by accident?" he inquired with a sarcastic tone and half a smile on his lips. I didn't answer him, but I stepped back. The man was covered in blood and I noticed that his arm was no longer wearing a bandage. The man with a leap descended from the horse, approaching me. I noticed that it was very high, it certainly exceeded my tonnage, but I was also able to fight and it seemed that these people had the nerve to underestimate me.
Sherlock waited a moment before getting up and offering me a hand to get up. He approached my ear slightly and felt his breath on my neck, and a chill ran through my body.
"You will come with us on a journey," he announced casually, while I still could not understand what he was saying.
"There is a great quiet here, it is not at all as I expected it", I admitted aloud admiring the ivy-covered ruins.
Murtagh Holmes, Sherlock's uncle had taken a seat next to me, perhaps he had noticed my discomfort in not understanding what Colum was saying then he began to translate aloud.
"Yes, well a tinker will be here next Saturday, he stops here in Leoch before going to Inverness, once a month. It often has room for one or two passengers ".
"If I had known that one day we had been in this position, I would have imagined a different context," he said as he laughed at her.
My heart suddenly lightened, and I knew at that moment that I could no longer wait for permission or be helped. I had to escape from the castle and return to the stone circle as soon as possible, even if I risked dying.
Nothing I found absolutely nothing, except trees and streams. A slight sensation of panic envelophad me.
I jumped up on the bed and laughed, as if I was back in the back in time, when I was five years old.
"It's all right," Holmes said as he lifted me off the ground, holding me by the side, "is that he cannot stand the sight of blood." We walked away towards the horses.
"No, I do not believe it. But I think you have secrets you do not want to divulge, so I'm still dumbfounded by your presence here in the Highlands, John Watson, "he grinned at me, as if I were the most interesting puzzle on the face of the earth.
When Mr. Holmes returned to work, I noticed that someone was following me. Surely a spy on Dougal's behalf. I knew they did not trust me and I suspected they thought I was an English spy. So, in the days that followed I devoted myself to doing uninteresting things, not to give satisfaction to Dougal. Mrs. Hadson had given me the task of helping her with the harvest of herbs for the kitchen. I rediscovered the pleasure of growing things and making them mature.
"N-no, what are you saying? It's just that I do not want to go back and forth from the kitchen every time. "
"Thank you!" I said sincerely. So, I took my leave and wandered around the castle, thoughtful. Arriving on the walls that led towards the inner courtyard.
As soon as I regained consciousness, I found myself tied to the wheel of one of our wagons, obviously with my butt in the mud. I began to feel the blows received, a twinge in my stomach made me think that there would probably be big bruises on my abdomen, my face was almost certainly covered in blood and soon my right eye would have swollen and become purple.
"Would not you do it for me?" He asked with a mischievous note, which I wanted to pretend not to have grasped.
"Do not be silly Victor. I assure you that you are on the wrong path. "I turned to the window with my back to him.
"No, it would be like calling a tall man short. It is not fast but can gallop for days. The only problem is that if it is not checked at the earliest opportunity, it will try to go home. I leave you alone so you know each other. "
As I approached the little house where the creature's screams came from, I saw from the window that the mother held the baby in her arms, trying to make the baby suckle without success.
Sherlock had approached me with a bowl of hare stew, I accepted it even though I did not even eat a bite.
The next morning I met Victor Trevor in the garden of the castle, to collect some useful herbs and flowers in our medical dispensations.
"No, I would say no. However, it would be unlikely. At sixteen I did not have the slightest interest in girls ", angrily nudged Holmes and squandrai.
"There's nothing" I stopped and looked in his direction, when I added, "If there's nothing else I would have to do here in my prison, as you can see" and I began to grind my herbs.
We reached the castle of Liocke, where I had been just two days before with Frank. At that moment I realised that my journey had just begun.
John has lost his breath but catches it back again, and he obliges by pulling the foreskin this way and that, revealing quick glimpses of the head that Sherlock pieces together in his mind.  Gradually, leisurely, his cock begins to thicken, pulsing slightly in his hand, the foreskin slipping back and down and revealing more and more.  Sherlock stares mesmerized.
“I didn’t mean it, the pushing,” Sherlock continued.  “It’s just, there’s so much. It all crashes in on me.”
, but John has already stepped willingly into more than one trap tonight, and he is not sure that this is not a test.
John had been down for the count after the first 21 hours, although Sherlock would excuse that, would absolutely not even secretly ridicule John, who’d been coping with a sprained ankle and two cracked ribs from the first footchase.  Hadn’t stopped John from trying to mother-hen him away from the petri dishes, though, and had certainly taken nothing away from the inventiveness of his language (and Sherlock could bask in John’s verbal pyrotechnics all day, if truth be told) when he discovered the toaster oven had been on fire for a good 3 minutes while Sherlock finished measuring reagents.
John looks up at him in uncertainty, and Sherlock repeats, a bit more firmly, "I'd like to watch you."
The other man undresses somewhat haphazardly, with one eye on John alert for attacks, but John just watches him.  John is already in a sleep shirt and pants, and he doesn’t seem to feel the need to be wearing less.
do. John is cursing himself already for a coward and a gentleman, but he will impale himself on his own prick before he would take advantage of Sherlock asleep.  It’s not a game of cat and mouse they’ve been playing, not angst and subterfuge and misunderstanding -- no, there have been enough words that John knows just exactly how unwelcome his advances would be.
After a hard look at the sleeping man beside him, John lays his hands on himself.  He’s soon wet with pre-come, so it’s a simple matter of push-pull-twist, and he makes no attempt to keep his voice gentle or his movements quiet.  Instead, he groans and cries out and shakes the bed as he comes, then notes the time grimly by his mobile.
So John closes his eyes again and feels himself growing ever harder as Sherlock's hands play over his body.  Where did Sherlock learn to trail seafoam and fireworks from his fingers?
“John, we have to get there before -- oh,”  Sherlock goes wordless just for a moment, but recovers valiantly.
, for god’s sake, the custard altogether forgotten, and Mrs. Hudson had caught a glimpse of ash under the flask and ferreted out the rest) Sherlock set his sights on molecular gastronomy.  It had everything he could want, including bite-sized portions and plenty of interesting new gadgets to buy.
John shoves his sleep pants partly down, applies the condom and lube with a steady hand, and pushes into the other man with one practiced motion.  Sherlock is fascinated with what comes next, because he would not have recognized this if he hadn’t seen what John was doing with the kissing.  John changes his angle slightly on each stroke, he speeds up and slows down, he adds a slight twist, and each time Sherlock can see he is testing the results, waiting.  Sometimes a combinations works and John stays with it for 20 or 30 seconds, but then there is a subtle shift and John is searching and testing again. Each time he gets it right, the other man moans or curses or, in one case, whimpers, which Sherlock can scarcely credit.  Then, so softly that Sherlock barely catches it, John asks “good?” and the other man nods again.  John speeds up and Sherlock times the other man’s breaths, curious whether they follow a regular pattern or are as chaotic as they seem.  Finally the other man cries out “oh god, that’s it, harder, jesus” and jerks over and over.  John looks down at him, and Sherlock sees his hand reach towards the other man face, but it stops.  It looks like John is biting his lip – why?  Has he been hurt?  After a long pause, John pulls out, discards the condom, and finishes himself with five strong and efficient pulls.  He is silent for the first three, but his breath hitches on the fourth, and on the fifth he is mouthing words, so it's good that Sherlock is an accomplished lip-reader, which he needs to be in this profession, and he reads "idiot, git, berk, sodding idiot" over and over until John collapses onto the bed.
After that John loses himself in the joy of the movement, flipping, twisting, spinning fast and slow and fast again.  It doesn’t hurt that he can see, from various upside down and sideways angles, Sherlock staring open-mouthed, though it could equally be John’s trampoline prowess or the idea of John having a growth spurt.  After several minutes of pandemonium, John flips to his back again and stays there, just bobbing softly and smiling rather foolishly.
Sherlock propels him to the bed with one hand on his back, and undresses them both as well.  He pushes John lightly onto his stomach and resumes his former activities. His hands roam down John's back, his arms, his legs, prodding, kneading, rolling, tapping, pushing into sore spots and dragging comfort into his muscles.  After 20 minutes, John feels like his body is made of clouds and beach sand and seafoam.  He is a thousand miles away when Sherlock suddenly flips him over and starts on his front, his hands on the planes of John chest, over and between John's thighs, pushing into the soles of his feet, across the inside his elbows, and back to his throat. Which is very tight. John feels he is getting hard and he grits his teeth, not wanting to betray Sherlock, but also not wanting to ask him to stop.
“And, well, I guess keeping myself emotionally uninvolved was a way to shield myself.  But you saw, it didn’t completely work…”
Then he packs a few things in his normal bag, not much really, just the straight razor, a packet of tea, the new bottle of lube from Sherlock, and the aubergine shirt, gets roaringly drunk with Greg, sets out in a long, stumbling walk home, and disappears.
“It’s really only a six, a sort of a cold six at that,” Sherlock essays, but John is already halfway down the stairs.
Gadgets could be ordered online, but ingredients needed to be bought in person, the book was quite clear on that point.  Sherlock had always been happy for food to simply appear pre-bought.  He assumed it was John, since Mrs. Hudson was vociferously not a housekeeper.  Sherlock considered making out a shopping list, leaving it on the kitchen table, and hoping for the best, but John might get suspicious.
John squints at his back in some disbelief, remembering at least one memorable occasion of guttural drawn-out moans and Sherlock’s head tipped almost perpendicular back on that long column of a neck and that bloody well had been the exact same spot and the exact same pressure, John knows because he tries now and then to replicate that night, but now he knows maybe not the why, but perhaps the fact that it won’t work again, not easily in any case.
Sherlock starts to roll his eyes, stops, frowns instead.  Someday he’s going to sprain an eyeball doing that, but today he just says, surprisingly mildly, “it’s fine, John, it’s – it’s good,” a lie so blatant that John scoffs at him.
Finally the timer buzzes and Sherlock drops his hands from where John had asked him to stroke lightly up and down the backs of his thighs.  A moment later, the hands return and stutter out a few more strokes, then disappear again.  Sherlock clears his throat, and John cranes his neck back at him with a smile that Sherlock doesn’t return.
So it was fine, and Sherlock went on exploring, and eventually he wanted to see the hip, to trace the pathways that led from being shot in the shoulder to walking with a limp, and that would involve John wearing less clothing.  Not that John seemed likely to complain.  But reaching down to undo someone else’s trousers, pressing into the softness of their belly to get the button loose, tugging at a zip over a hard cock, those intimate actions were beyond Sherlock right now.   Instead he straddled John’s knees, keeping his right hand where it was, and running one finger of the other along John’s waistband, dipping below when he could.  After a few passes, he pressed his cheek against John’s belly and tongued at the smooth cool skin.  John was jerking under his head, and making small strangled noises, almost like he was about to cry, so Sherlock turned to look up at him again and John pleaded “Sherlock love, please don’t stop now, you … I can’t… please…” which confused Sherlock again – had John always called him love?  He couldn’t remember at that moment.
Three things that Sherlock was rather pleased with himself for, largely, avoiding.  And he had the numbers to back it up.
Although John had been right, that first night.  Sherlock considered 90 seconds to be plenty and to spare for an activity that he indulged in only rarely, and which tended to leave him dyspeptic afterwards.
Sherlock’s connection arrives during Columbo – the fifth episode in a row for John, who gets up and walks straight into the bedroom when he sees the other man at the door.
Finally John reaches for the lube and a condom.  The other man takes the opportunity to press his own kisses on John’s neck and chest, and Sherlock sees John go still, his eyes glassy but his skin nearly glowing.  John’s breathing has turned harsh and after 12 seconds he jerks his head suddenly to mutter “are you ready, or do you need…”
Now there are many nights where John is too tired or Sherlock is too pre-occupied for much more than a perfunctory cuddle before John falls asleep and Sherlock lays awake beside him.
On Monday, Sherlock uses 3 of the carrots to make risotto for John and huffs at him when John looks surprised.  Cooking is just chemistry, after all, and there's no reason for John to think that Sherlock can't do it, other than the fact that John hasn't seen him do more than wash forks since he moved in.
not blaming you and I’m sure as fuck not asking you to change, it’s just…” he trails off briefly, looks down at half-unfolded jeans and bottle of lube for inspiration, and continues softly “I’m not like that, there’s so much that I want, and it’s not fair to you…”
“Yes, there’s a problem,” John realizes he’s going to have to spell some things out for Sherlock.  “You can’t just come leaping in here with a case when I’m -- when this is -- when I need privacy.”
But that’s run-of-the-mill, 18 hours without a case boredom.  A consulting detective plunged into the black depression of inactivity is an entirely different proposition.  For one thing, he never leaves the flat.  He is curled on the couch in the morning when John gets up, and he is there where John retires to that very detective’s own room.  Once, John wondered if Sherlock-in-love would be immune from these jagged pits of despair, and now he knows the answer.  John has prodded, encouraged, empathised, ignored, and all but tackled his unmoving arse, but Sherlock has responded only once, and that was to snarl venomously “I suppose you thought your prick was a sodding magic wand?”  The insult burns despite the fact that it doesn’t even make sense, but Sherlock snaps his mouth closed and pulls his robe tighter around his emphatic back.
“This,” Katsuki said, holding up the letter for Mister Montgomery to inspect, “Does not tell us anything about his last wish.”
The wind in the trees was the sad song of a lover lost. John listened to it, taking a deep breath. He leaned on his walking stick, looking down at the gravestone of Sherlock Holmes. He pulled out the deerstalker from his jacket pocket and placed it on top of it, smiling ruefully at it.
“Rosie,” he said, lying in this glaringly white room, connected to various tubes that led to nowhere. Rosie sat next to him, holding his hand. She was sitting in Sherlock’s chair, right next to his bed. She looked so much younger. She was crying. She knew that this was the last time they had a chance to talk. The last time she would see him.
Once inside, he’s less sure of himself, because “Bloody fuck Sherlock!” John gasps, and buries himself in the duvet so fast that Sherlock wonders if he’s been practicing.  His violent burrowing sends the bottle of lube flying through a perfect spinning arc to shatter at Sherlock’s feet.  John goes bright red fading to aubergine around the edges, and Sherlock steps carefully away from the slippery mess.
But John’s hand has continued to move, and he clears the other man’s head without even brushing against it, and instead he puts his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, then sits to free his other hand to put it on Sherlock’s other shoulder, and his face is almost but not quite touching Sherlock’s and he says “It’s ok, I’ve got you.  We don’t need to talk about this right now, ok?” and Sherlock takes a deep breath and nods. Then he nods again just to make sure that John saw, and John smiles a bit and says “idiot.”  Sherlock is somewhat sure that it sounds affectionate.
John pulls his damp fingers along Sherlock’s jaw, pushes his t-shirt out of the way, and molds himself to Sherlock’s still-brittle back.  “Shhh,” he croons, and “I’ve got you,” and “I get it,” and Sherlock doesn’t call him out on any of it, even though there is nothing remotely to get in anything he said.  Instead his back relaxes in increments and John nuzzles at the soft skin in the curve of his neck, and Sherlock’s breath goes slowly even.
They sit in silence again for a few minutes. Tentatively, John reaches for Sherlock's scalp, muttering "don't worry, I'll try not to prod too hard."
, John was repeating, his voice sliding unpredictably between affection and alarm.   And Sherlock took a deep breath and tried again, “I thought it would be reassuring to…” but trailed off as he saw that John, like all the others,
John can’t help it, he has to touch Sherlock, so he grasps one sharp wrist and makes a show of counting his pulse. It is absolutely steady and normal.  “Why even do it--” he begins.
He doesn’t ask for a joint appointment.  Even a therapist must have her limits, and he is not interested in witnessing Sherlock shred hers.  In any case, fitting Sherlock into her beige office would be like stuffing a peacock into a phone booth. No, he just makes an appointment for himself, on his lunch break, on what he hopes will be a quiet day.
“And you’re not interested,” John countered, then he punctuated the comment by reaching up to press a soft kiss on Sherlock’s mouth.  It was a momentary fleeting thing, and Sherlock surprised himself by not hating it.
That night John explains the experimental procedure to Sherlock – the timer, the pants-stay-on rule, the no-actual-sex rule, the way they are meant to communicate and use their words and tell each other what works, what feels good, what doesn’t.  Sherlock’s eyes light up at the word “experiment”, and John doesn’t object to either a laptop on the side table or a go-pro camera on Sherlock’s forehead. The camera band flattens Sherlock’s curls into a parody of an eighties aerobics instructor, so John closes his eyes.
