Tony scooted closer, almost touching but not sure he should. “He's part of you, you know. I mean, I get that you still think of yourself as the skinny kid from the projects, witness your shirt collection, but I've seen Erskine's notes. The things that make you Captain America were there already when he found you, the Serum just brought them out. I mean, I'm not complaining that it also brought out muscles for days,” he skimmed his fingers along the closer bicep, “and, you know, all that... stamina, but you're not just some meathead, and you're not an empty suit and a fancy Frisbee. You're smart, maybe smarter than any of us realize, you're a good leader, good with people. I mean, you're genuinely nice, and that never happens. Seriously, I know there are nice people out there, but they get within a mile of me, their inner asshole comes out, no one is nice around me, but you manage it, and I am truly impressed.” His brain jumped tracks, and he had to take a gulp of coffee just to have something to do with his face. “I, um, almost feel like I should be asking if you're with me just because I remind you of my dad. Or because I'm absurdly wealthy. Or...”
Tony shrugged. “Tell you what. You try out all the top rated ones, figure out which parts of them really work, and which parts fall down on the job, and then you and I can sit down and create a brand new one, from scratch, to your exacting standards. I’ll even let you name it when it’s ready to be released.”
*A*A*
He bit into the sub, and had to close his eyes for a moment as the complex flavors of various cured meats flooded his mouth. When he had chewed, swallowed, and reopened his eyes, he saw Tony watching him, bright eyed and eager. “Good, right?”
Steve moved down again, unbuttoning the last buttons and untucking the shirt. He kissed Tony's solar plexus, then dropped to his knees and kissed just above the waistband of Tony's pants. Tony let out his breath in a whoosh. “Oh, God, look at you. Look at-” Steve glanced up through his lashes, and Tony groaned. Steve chuckled, his breath hot on Tony's already-sensitive skin, and went to work on his button and zipper. Tony sagged against the door as Steve slid slacks and boxers over his hips (over his erection, God, how could this incredible man-) and down his thighs just enough, then swallowed his cock down in one hot, wet movement. Tony whimpered and tangled one hand in Steve's hair, needing the anchor, and gave himself up to- “Star-Spangled Plan. Good stuff.”
Almost before the picture was over, Tony was jumping up and running away upstairs. Steve made himself stay a few minutes, say good night to everyone, even straighten the sofa pillows... And now he was stalling. He told himself that if he went up and Tony was already in bed, he wouldn't bother him, but he wasn't sure that wasn't a lie. He moved with the quiet speed he still blessed the Serum for giving him, but when he caught sight of Tony, standing at the window, framed by the city lights, he froze in place, hardly able to breathe with the beauty of the moment. He could feel himself memorizing every detail, vowing to get it down on paper as soon as he could, no matter what the next few minutes brought.
Leyenar smiled.
"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way." said Dr. Strange. Tony and Pepper were understandably shocked, and Leyenar shot the doctor a death-glare. "I'm taking back the congrats." Strange quickly fixed himself.
Scarly=Scarlet Witch
"I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot." said Rocket and revealed an artificial eye. "Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack, you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball." He then gave the artificial eye to Thor, who asked where did it come from.
"Stark Raving Hazelnuts."
"Including my own." Drax added.
Thor stood up and yelled, "Your father killed my brother!"
"There's no time for a thing."
"You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?" asked Thor.
And then she heard about Ant-Man, and since he was the hero, the villain was definitely DOOMED. But in order to save him, she had to persuade Darren Cross, the villain, to wear that Yellowjacket suit. All that talk-talk-talking was no use, so she decided to put up a musical number instead.
And, now, let me begin.
"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here." Star-Lord replied. The four Guardians disembarked and sneaked into the Collector's collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos was threatening the Collector while the Guardians hid behind rubble.
"Hi, Bruce." said Nat.
They shared everything as they worked. The Prince claimed he never wanted any of his stuck up siblings or the whiny brats to meet the Soldier, but he spent days talking about each and every one of them. The Soldier told his prince about all his favorite places, and the fragile mortals that meant so much to him, painting a picture of a lonely, gentle genius with too much potential and so much strength.
Voldemort:THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!
Captain Rogers has no surviving family. A public ceremony will be held October 1st.
Palpatine:Okay, Red Skull for Three Cap Deaths.
Everyone:Hooray!
"But it should." said Steve. He then turned to Vision and said "We don't trade lives, my friend. If the director knew about this, what would she say?"
"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector." Thor replied.
Steve followed them with his eyes before waving as well. "Good night," he murmured, smiling into the darkness.
It had been an easy decision, at first. A quick, easy, untraceable way to gain financial security.
"Which isn't the point... I mean… If he doesn't pony up..." Star-Lord began.
"Yeah. Everybody has that."
"Rabbit?" asked Rocket.
Deadpool leaves again.
"Why?" asked Thanos. "Why you? Daughter..." He held his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora broke down, sobbing.
"I am prepared." Thanos declared.
"I was a child when you took me." Gamora reminded him.
The Shining Lord refused traditional black robes or the advanced armor created by the Celestials. Instead, he created his own suits of armor, which were far more powerful and elegant than anything that existed before, and he was only challenged once. The Shining Lord, challenged by an adviser, proved himself worthy through a bond between his kingdom and Asgard. The Asgardian king was no fool, for he could see the power that swam in his veins. And his prediction was revealed true through the passage of time. The Shining Lord was, indeed, a most powerful being. His power extended to space, time, reality, mind, power, and soul. It was infinite, a power unlike those belonging to the Asgardians or any other people.
"How the hell is this dude still alive?" asked Star-Lord.
"He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt." said Mantis, referring to Thor.
"I don't have it." said the Collector.
"Thank you, sweet rabbit." said Thor, and placed the artificial eye in his empty eye socket.
"I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."." said Drax.
"I don't...I don't know. But something..." The stone trilled again and Vision flinched. Wanda took his face in her hands. Vision turned his head so he can kiss her left palm, then pressed Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone. "Tell me what
Bruce rushed over to him. "Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?"
A young soldier who went by the name of Sun, one of many soldiers tasked with defending the borders of the multiverse from the darkness and also a powerful warrior.
"Can you do it?" asked Wanda.
"It ain't the eye." said Rocket, pointing to a dark planet outside. Much to Thor's surprise, it turned out to be Nidavellir.
Thanos scowled, his egotistical narcissism preventing him from fully listening to her. "I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter."
"Now what did I say about that big mouth of yours?" he said before Pepper could say anything racial. "I will come back, and, true to the director's words, I will surely deliver a rocket punch to your pudgy face." And, with that, the connection was shut off.
"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective." replied Thor.
"Of course you can!" squealed Lyla. "Let me down, daddy!" she yelled, though she was really more laughing, her little body swaying from side to side as the two of them walked up the stairs.
"Oh, she's Agent Daisy Johnson of SHIELD. We picked her up on the way home." replied Steve.
"What if I miss that train?" asked Vision.
"Where's the Soul Stone?" Thanos demanded.
"I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. But because you did. And you
"Yeah, right." Star-Lord admitted.
"And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so..." Tony said.
Bruce attempted to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck. "Been a while. Good to have you, buddy." said Tony.
"You'll find...removing a dead man's spell...troublesome."
Electro:No way! He can't get Spider-Man!
A fully grown Gamora activated the spring-action blades on that same dagger. Star-Lord approached her, and said "Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to—"
"Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page." Tony told Star-Lord.
happened.
All in all, everything worked as they had planned should the Avengers be involved in yet another international emergency. And yet, Tony often felt like he was in an old and clichéd western movie. The good guys were surrounded by bad guys, and the bad guys were in turn surrounded by angered Indians.
"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy." replied Tony.
"I should have told you, I just didn't want to lose you." He sniffed and rubbed his face on his arm.
"Did it have a name?" asked Thor.
"I am Groot!" the plant said in a mocking tone.
On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stood up. He looked out the window and saw the ship, then tapped on his best friend in the seat in front of him. "Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted." General Okoye told King T'Challa.
As Black Dwarf approached the team, a slender, shiny nano-tech suit enveloped Tony's frame. He grew a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grew a set of blasters that easily threw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestured and deflected his massive companion into some cars. Iron Man turned to Leyenar and said "Stay back sir."
"Tell me what it needs." Thanos demanded.
"I was gonna go home—" Peter began to speak.
Just then, Tony is knocked down by Dwarf, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man. "Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark and Director Leyenar?" asked the boy.
Irah=Iron Man
Her eyes continued to strain, but her erstwhile visitor eluded her sight. "What do you want?"
Voldemort:Oh yes, I want to change my vote now! I forgot Vision has a stone in his head.
"Rabbit, fire up the pod." Thor told Rocket.
"Vormir!" Gamora cried, and Thanos deactivated the Gauntlet, and Nebula gasped in air as she was pieced back together.
said Leyenar.
Apocalypse:PUT ALL OF MY MONEY ON WOLVERINE!
"On its way." replied T'Challa.
Thor awakened, sat up violently and threw himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turned to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game. "Who the hell are you guys?" asked Thor.
Leyenar added. She then held up her hand, displaying her Infinity Gauntlet.
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge" is our favorite." said Wong.
"Not sure, I'm working on it."
Soul-bonding was a romanticized notion. This was a glossy, shiny definition of soulmate:
cried Leyenar.
"Gamora." replied the girl.
"'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help." said Star-Lord.
"Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."
More than a product of science, however, Captain America was a product of his time - both literally and metaphorically. World War 2 required new innovations in military technology, especially if these innovations could either prevent casualties or grant an advantage to allied soldiers - as the super-serum would have. Beyond that, the public image of Captain America was shaped by the propaganda performances required to sell war bonds and raise civilian morale for the war effort. After all, if there is no war, what is the use of a soldier?
Bruce gave Tony a desperate hug, without answering. Leyenar understood, since she could feel that he went through a lot. And so, everybody except Pepper headed back to the Sanctum Sanctorum. "From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence." said Wong, using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.
art if it was only referencing other art, and not reflecting on the human condition. Steve found himself gesturing emphatically at a piece that seemed to be nothing more than a haphazard tower of broken furniture and discarded toys. “This! This isn't art! It isn't
Steve couldn't help laughing. “What I cannot believe is how spoiled you are!” He bent, getting one hand under Tony's knees and the other around his shoulders. Tony sighed happily and draped his arms around Steve's neck. (Steve took a moment to ensure that Tony's robe was tucked properly around him. Wouldn't do to
The young Alpha was lounging back, hands behind his head and ankles crossed, in clothes more suited to a Palace gala than a stranger’s bedchamber. When he caught sight of Steve, he swung up and around to sit at the edge of the bed. “Hello, there, Earl Steven. Well, you’re prettier than your portrait.”
Does it still count as a first date if you're already together?
Thor, when he was there, was good at lightening the mood (pun totally intended, it wasn't like Tony was made of stone), getting the rest of the team talking and laughing and explaining some bit of pop culture to him and Steve. He also encouraged movie nights and video game competitions and karaoke. Oh, God, the karaoke. Tony was glad a hundred times over that he'd set JARVIS up with a karaoke program so they didn't have to go out to a bar and expose the poor innocent public to the way-more-enthusiastic-than-skilled Avengers. Clint and Thor were all volume and no pitch, Nat made up her own words, Bruce wouldn't even have gone, and Steve, for all he tried, didn't actually know the words to anything. If they'd gone to a karaoke bar more than the once, Tony would have drunk the place dry that night, and bankrupted Stark Industries the next day trying to keep the madness out of the media (a losing battle, what with the existence of YouTube and all). But here at the Tower they could have a couple beers, a LOT of pizzas, and whatever lyrics they wanted to come up with. They could also pause between songs to explain things to Thor and Steve if they needed to, and sometimes Tony found himself choosing the most obscure tracks he knew, just so he could show off his knowledge and watch Steve's face light up with understanding.
fingers invading him, stretching him so wide... The delightful burn was partially quenched by a glop of cool lube, but then, oh then, there were fingers, plural, delving deep into him, and he was squirming against them, into them, with and around and for them, and he
The next gallery along had a display sign that proclaimed “007”. Tony perked up sharply. “Ooh, Bond!” He paused, looked over at Steve consideringly, and wilted. “Ooooohh, Bond. Ummm... Yeah, you know what? We'll put those on your watch list at home, you're going to end up yelling at the screen a whole lot, let's not do that in public.” He caught Steve's elbow, and hauled him along to the next gallery, labeled “
Tony didn't even have to think. “Might as well have it brought here. We can take it the rest of the way.” He stood in front of Steve and held out his hand. “After all, we have a tradition to properly establish.”
Steve sat back on his heels and clapped both hands over his heart melodramatically. “Oh, Heavens, no! Not... eating regularly! How cruel I am to you!” He grinned and started pulling tins and tubs out of the bag.
Steve woke as soon as the rising sun hit the bed, but he found no need and no reason to move. He would almost have expected disorientation, confusion about the body draped over his, but he could feel the arc reactor, Tony's heart, separated from his own by nothing more than his own flesh. This was...
has been getting lately.” He claimed another kiss from Tony, feeling like he was
Tony knew Bruce, and his focus on the science over the teammates, almost as well as he knew that part of himself. Tony knew how easy it was to convince yourself that they didn't actually want you there, and so whenever he left his lab, heading to the communal kitchen or living room, he made a point to stick his head into Bruce's lab, see what he was up to, ask him along. Pretty soon, all he had to do was open the door and raise his eyebrows, and Bruce would grin and start packing up his experiment or whatever. Tony didn't look too closely at the fact that that grin warmed up a place in his heart he thought he'd put into cold storage back when the other high schoolers hadn't wanted a skinny pre-teen following them around. And because of it, he found he was also leaving his own lab more, wanting to lure out Bruce (being lured himself) to the boisterous camaraderie of the common areas. He
Steve burst out laughing. “Yes, because when I think of Tony Stark, I think laid back. Wouldn't want to break that illusion.” He leaned up and kissed Tony. “So, Bucky always told me, if they let you stay the night, make breakfast for 'em the next day. You want breakfast?”
And now Tony was laughing at him! This was just getting worse... Everything had been so perfect... “Oh, my God, I just deflowered Captain America!” Steve's mood was crashing. Was Tony going to go blabbing to the papers about what they'd just done? Could Steve just die of mortification right now? “Oh, my God! That was you without any practice or experience or anything? Hot damn, get you some training, you are going to be a sex god, I don't know whether I want to share you with everyone, or at least the people I want to reward, or just keep you for myself and gloat to people that they will never have sex as good as what I'm getting.” Well, ok, that didn't sound quite so terrible... “Oh, my God, I just took Steve Rogers' virginity!” Steve blinked, and Tony was standing up and dancing around.
Steve slept for an unexpectedly long time on Sunday morning, and only woke up when the smell of bacon and sausage hit his nose. He shifted, surprised that Tony was 1) awake before him, and 2) actually cooking, but then he realized Tony was once again sprawled across him, one bony hip digging into his ribs and the arc reactor practically in his armpit. He chuckled and nudged him. “Hey, Tony, ummm... baby? I think someone came home early...”
Tony was glowing just as much, but somehow in a dirtier way. “Well, you know, if you want to make it even more obvious, we could give each other hickeys right now...” Steve didn't recognize the term at first, but when Tony started biting at his neck, he got it, fast. Oh, wow, Tony wanted to mark him up, wanted to show him off... Oh, wow, that was awful hot...
It was comfortable, comfort
Steve's hands shifted. It took Tony a moment to notice, but those hands were definitely drifting downward. They settled on his ass, and Tony threw back his head and moaned aloud. His hips jerked forward, and he realized how incredibly, painfully hard he was. Then, oh god then, he realized Steve was just as hard, the bulge threatening to split his jeans. He whimpered and rubbed their erections together, the fabric between them little more than a nuisance. Steve groaned into his mouth.
Tony grinned at him, lo mein hanging from the corner of his mouth, then slurped it up. “Yeah, me too. Though if the rest of the team is around, we probably want to have pants on. That whole 'naked Thor' thing. Though if Nat wanted to...”
Steve bowed back. “Until tonight, my Lord.” Tony left, and Steve went about getting dressed, in a daze of shock. Pregnant! Him! He was torn down the middle, this development both a blessing and a curse. He made sure to apply his perfume a bit more heavily than usual, to ensure none of the new scent leaked out.
Tony moved around behind him, and spent a moment just running his hands over Steve's cheeks, his back, the backs of his thighs... “God, you are so gorgeous... So many things I want to do with you...” He slid a finger down Steve's crack, and Steve shivered in delightful anticipation. “To you...” He kissed the middle of one cheek, then the other. “But right now...” There was the soft snickt of the lubricant opening, then a cool drop of it right where it was going to be needed most. Steve gasped, his hips and back automatically arching up toward Tony's hands. “Oh, and so responsive... I bet this part won't take long...”
When Steve had finally finished his workout, showered, and gotten some lunch, he figured he probably ought to pack up his things, if he was really going to be moving. He pulled out the couple of duffel bags SHIELD had given him, making short work of filling them with his day-to-day clothes; The Suit was, as always, tucked away in a garment bag, and he slipped his handful of sport coats in with it. Then he went around the room with a knapsack, gathering up all the bits and bobs of life, the photos of him and the team, the novel he'd borrowed from Bruce and hadn't finished yet, his sketchbooks and pencils...
He wasn't entirely sure what to do with the riding crop, (and he wanted to keep changing things up, keep Tony guessing) so he spent his dozen strokes playing around, hitting with the length of it, or just the end, hard here, soft there... At the end, he didn't have much of a better feel for it than when he started, and Tony seemed to feel about the same. (Honestly, how could he
eye-opening things (and gone through far more lotion and paper tissues than he was comfortable admitting), but in the end he decided it was time to redefine himself again, and make some more waves.
of my life...” He lifted his head just enough to look at Steve, then turned it away shyly. “Though, um, yesterday? When we were talking about fantasies? I feel I should confess, I've been jerking off to images of you since I was about 15. Um, and to seriously kinky thoughts involving you since about 19. Though they were pretty much only me leaving bruises on you. This.... This is so fucking much better than any of that.”
with release.
One of the Serum's side effects was that Steve didn't sleep much anymore, which was pretty useful in helping him adjust to this new, bright, fast future. He could spend hours watching musicals from the 50s, candy-colored and absurdly optimistic, or wandering through the rabbit warren of Wikipedia. He had spent whole weekends with one teammate or another, 'marathoning' seasons of their favorite tv shows. So, when not just his daytime thoughts, but his right-before-bed thoughts, and his first-thing-in-the-morning thoughts, and every single thought he
Tony realized that his plate was empty, and that the others were standing, clearing the table, and moving toward the living room couches. He hurriedly pushed himself up and joined them. “So, whose turn is it to choose the movies? I know it was Thor last week, because we saw Star Wars. Again.”
good. If you kept on, I was gonna pop, and then we wouldn't have been able to do the next part. Which-” He pulled, without much leverage, at Steve's shirt. Steve grinned, kissed him on the 'hickey', and sat up to take the shirt off. And after that, well, it just made sense to take off his own slacks and boxer briefs. Tony ran an approving hand up his side. “Oh, Cap, you seriously have no idea how ridiculously much I am looking forward to the next part. Mmm, ok, to prep you, I think... Have you on your hands and knees? Just, anywhere on the bed, grab a pillow if you want.” He dug in the bedside table for the lubricant, while Steve arranged himself basically in the middle of the bed, facing the pillows.
Well, that seemed to work, if the filthy grin on Tony's face was anything to go by. “Aw, really? I was so hoping to see you in nothing but an apron and rubber gloves...” And then Tony was kissing him, and they were rubbing against each other, and oh, God, he needed more...
“Good morning, Sir. The date is Monday, October 1st, and the time is 8 am. Shall I tell you the weather?”
, out in public, having meals and taking in culture together. Hah, the way the paparazzi followed Tony around, there were likely to be pictures of them in the papers tomorrow anyway. As Steve ducked around a delivery truck and vaulted a hand cart, he wondered if any of the photos would show them off well together, and if he could get his hands on them... And then he realized that at least one of the tabloids would likely insinuate that they
"Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh." Rhodey replied.
"Thanks, Director!" Peter said, and immediately added "I'm trying to say that...something is coming."
"So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious." Thanos insisted.
"Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother...and Ronan. And Leyenar. Everything."
Black Dwarf grunted out two untranslated syllables, and Maw ordered, "Bring me the Stone, before they can give it to her!" Black Dwarf spat three untranslated syllables, and dropped his huge alien hammer and dragged it along as he obeyed his brethren.
Thanos signaled a nearby servant who tapped on a control pad. Nebula's voice said,
"We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake." said Dr. Strange.
His hand was all-powerful, pulling from within His pocket a grain of existential matter—the very materials of which life is born. With these tools, the creator laid down on upon the Celestial ground a gift. It was rumored to be greater than all—a direct descendant of the great One's strength and self. Thousands of colors danced against the windows, casting shadows and rays of brilliance, and the Celestials, who were used to such splendorous kind of wonders, stood in awe. It was a magical scene, prompting wild tales that would never cease to hold a curious ear and the interest of those who see much more than what is. Even the production, herself, would find her attention arrested by the stories told of her making.
Thanos said, "You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you." He offered his hand, she wrapped her little fingers around one massive finger, and he led her to a pavilion, where he crouched to her eye level again and produced a small—for him—red-jeweled handle. He pressed the switch, razor-sharp blades popped out both ends. "Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…" He balanced it on one finger, overbalanced it purposefully and caught it, then gave Gamora a try. Meanwhile, Ebony Maw was outside, proceeding the execution. One half of the crowd got shot down. The survivors screamed in horror, and Gamora tried to turn but Thanos prevented her from seeing the massacre. "Concentrate. There! You've got it."
Steve chuckled and moved a little closer. Tony was starting to feel like a wild animal Steve was trying to catch, the impression not much helped by the realization that his heart was pounding a thousand miles an hour. Steve caught his eye. “Is this about my announcement at dinner? Were you, um... hoping to come out first? Or planning to never come out? Or-”
Sometime later, JARVIS pinged. “Sir, the delivery from Chez Chic is here. Shall I have it brought to this level?”
- to bring him back from the edge. Steve opened his eyes, wanting to watch, and Tony locked gaze with him, stealing Steve's breath away. (The artist part of his brain was noting down every detail, but the rest of him was living entirely in the moment.) Then Tony slowly, almost gently, lowered himself down onto Steve's jock. Steve concentrated on breathing, driven nearly crazy by the tight heat slowly enveloping him. This was- God, this was the most incredible thing ever. No wonder everyone was obsessed with it!
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and drew him close. “Hey, hey, relax, shh, shh, it's ok. I want this too, I want you... I'm not sure I want the billboard, but yeah, I want you, and I doubt you're going to screw it up as bad as you think.” Tony tried to pull away, to protest, but Steve gave him A Look, and he subsided a little. “So, if I stay here tonight, am I going to wake up to Pepper hustling me out the door?”
Steve clutched at him.“No, hold on, just give me a minute...” Just had to refocus, think about something other than his jock for a little while. He finally -
Fortunately, JARVIS interrupted him. “I beg your pardon, everyone, but there is an incoming call from Dr Banner.”
He batted his eyelashes. “Very favorite person in the whole wide world? Seriously, though, we do have a major gender imbalance. Is it irresponsible to actively recruit? Hmm, come to think of it, we're pretty damn pale, too, you think Rhodey wants to be an Avenger?” She was starting to scowl, and he was feeling too good to bait her, so he left off. “Anyway, yes, just t-shirts, safe for work and everything, I just didn't want them sent to me for, you know, security reasons. Here, you wanna look?” He tore the tape off the top and pulled open the flaps. Pepper rolled her eyes, but she came around the desk to peek over his shoulder.
and dim the lights.”
Tony shuddered, feeling tensions he hadn't even known he was carrying flow away from him. “Yellow and red. Good, yes.” And then, before he knew he was going to say it, “thank you, Cap.” His eyes were wet, and he didn't care.
Tony went immediately to the oversized coffee maker and got it going. Steve stopped at the fridge for the bacon and eggs, then set up shop in front of the stove. He pulled out two frying pans, then glanced shyly at Tony. “You want pancakes too?” Tony nodded, and Steve grabbed a third pan. “Grab me the mix, then?”
Clint was sprawled across the big sofa, wearing Hawkeye pajamas and eating some sort of brightly colored breakfast cereal. There were cartoons playing on the tv, but all of Clint's attention was currently on Steve. “This is actually kind of adorable. You look so nervous. Kinda makes me want to take a ton of embarrassing pictures of the two of you before you go. Ooh, ooh, did you get him a corsage? Or are you expecting him to bring one? Wait, did you even have prom back in the 40s?”
Tony had on the most authentic smile Steve had ever seen out of him. “Oh, yeah. You apparently enjoyed yourself twice!” His grin somehow got even more wicked. “Which, gotta say, cum from the first time squishing around in there for round two? Way hotter than you'd think. Guess it's been a while for you, though, huh?”
about them, and the nakedness, and... But they were being so
Tony shifted his angle, and cried out, the most beautiful noise Steve had ever heard. He rocked again, and turned to look at Steve in gorgeous desperation. Steve slid a hand over to grab hold of Tony's jock (for the first time? How had that happened?) and stroke it, which sent Tony screaming over the edge. Between the sound, the ragged clench of inner muscles, and the sight of Tony, head thrown back and drops of milky liquid spurting from his jock, Steve hurtled headlong into his own orgasm.
They walked out of that exhibit room both nearly glowing with happiness at the connection they were building. Next along the hall there was a sign for an exhibit called “
, baby, please fuck me...” He flailed one arm in the general direction of the bedside drawer with the lube, until Steve growled and lunged for it. A moment later, he was back, pressing his lips roughly to Tony's, driving his tongue into Tony's mouth almost mercilessly. Tony groaned again, his hips rocking up against whatever part of Steve was closest. Steve was already popping open the bottle of lube, slicking up his fingers, and now he slid his hand between them, down to Tony's hole. Before Tony could even finish his moan of approval, Steve was sliding one finger into him.
Gamora looked up at Star-Lord in concern. He returned her look and grimaced a "don't worry about it" expression at her.
"Choose a side, or die." Maw told her.
Voldemort:Yes. Here's to the one villain who's done absolutely nothing but is being treated as the scariest villain of all time!
"And you said your sister and your dad?" asked Rocket.
"We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?" asked Bruce.
"Wonderful." said Thor.
"What?" asked Peter.
"And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk."
Joker:Yes, zero! It's MARVEL! The good guys always win!
He wondered often if going to the Sheriff and simply asking for shackles would be easier than trying to make amends.
"You should know...it extracts a terrible price." said the figure.
"Whatever. Point is:things change." concluded Tony.
"Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig." Rocket said.
Hawkward=Hawkeye
Truly, this is what made him so awesome. The Celestial Monarch loved without barriers:he loved Everything and all that was entailed. I believe that once, he even loved the Children of Darkness:Galactus, Dormammu, and myself. All of the One Above All's creations were precious to the Shining Lord, but there was one who he loved to no limit, no act of his could have derailed the passions inside him. To love him, the act was inscribed into his bones.
"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?"
The fact he'd also agreed to handle reconstruction duties for the government as well as paying for a major part of it had probably weighed heavily in the Avengers' favor.
"That's a bit much."
"It's not helping your case, OK?" Pepper told Tony. That aside, she was thankful that they were finally together. That crazy director hell-bent on getting "Cap and Irah" back together was no match for the power of pure true love, after all. Also, she was fed up with that girl calling her boyfriend Irah. Thank goodness that Leyenar finally gave up.
Spidey=Spider-Man
"You're very perceptive." bragged Rocket.
"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?" asked Rocket as he clambered up the table. "Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
"Who just saved your magical ass? Me." said Tony.
Ultron:I bet he only gets Two. I bet it's Vision and Scarlet Witch.
"Where's your guy?" asked the engineer.
"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks." said Star-Lord. Suddenly, he noticed Thor rummaging through their food stores. "Excuse me, that's our food."
said Leyenar, suddenly cutting in.
Well, almost every solar system, almost every world, almost every species, almost every life, and definitely not every universe. There are few universes—and lives—in which her silent song is paused, the music forever ringing on the last note played. In these worlds, to all that are miniature and grand, immortality is a haunting tone. I have heard its concertos and symphonies, listened to the notes fall only to never end, stuck forever as I wait, agonized, for the next unending measure.
? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?" asked Tony.
Some time later, they all moved to another room to discuss.
Yeah, and that was exactly what happened to Cap and Irah, they were Twin-Flames. Leyenar recognized them as an ancient spirit, which had once been two soulmates conjoined in an act of desperation and true love. Now, the spirit was two souls once more, however, the separation caused great unrest in the depths of their beings. The young girl's hands curled up into tight fists, with an intense fire burning in her eyes. She would do anything in her power to bring Cap and Irah back together, and Ultron would certainly aid and abet her in any plan necessary. And, together, they would make Pepper Potts pay.
"You let her go!" Star-Lord ordered.
But, let's just put it aside, when the news of the Star Warrior and the Apple Princess reached the Shining Lord, he got bent out of shape. Hell-bent on winning the Warrior's love back, the Shining Lord created a powerful being to teach the Apple Princess a lesson she'll never forget. His name was Ion, the God of Destruction. He would later be known to a certain amount of people as Shiva. Rebellious and daring, Ion dared to supplant his creator as the High King of the Celestials until he came face-to-face with the One Above All, who told him about his true duties. Ion did not believe at first, but he knew that the One Above All was unable to tell a lie, so he finally came to his senses and used all his powers to conjure up a magical path separating the Star Warrior and the Apple Princess, the Milky Way.
Joker:How does he do that?
"Can you stand?" Sam asked Vision.
"You talk too much." spat Thor.
"But I did." Peter exclaimed.
said Leyenar, quickly cutting in. She then bowed, and said
Chitauri Soldier:Oh yeah, Loki's totally gonna die.
"Because you murdered half the planet."
"Stop massaging his muscles." Star-Lord said snidely, then told Mantis "Wake him up." Mantis did so.
"Give up the Stone, and she lives." Corvus told Vision, who flew with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof. Simultaneously, Proxima and Wanda fought below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima used the blaster effect of her weapon to knock Wanda meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaped down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of Wanda's face, only held back by Wanda's powers. Furiously, Vision pummeled Corvus, then threw him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus used his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflected back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him. Down below, Wanda has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she heard an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthened her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. Wanda then flew up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.
"Why?" Pepper asked.
"Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan." Tony sneered.
"I mean, I'd like to. I really would…" Gamora silenced him by covering his mouth with her hand.
"For the record…I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't." Star-Lord told Rocket.
Doc=Dr. Strange
"Let her go, Grimace!" yelled Star-Lord, blasters in hand.
"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?" Rhodey retaliated.
"Yeah." replied Tony.
"Did you
" The Mad Titan was quite alive and undamaged, and the red Reality Stone was already seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.
With a thump, Thor's body got plastered to the hull of the ship. "Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!" yelled Rocket, shaking his hands wildly. Thor's remaining eye opened, and everybody gasped.
"Yeah, that's the... thing." Tony replied, awkwardly.
If democracy sometimes seems slow and ambling, that is because it is weighted down with responsibility; if it sometimes seems callous and uncaring to the individual, that is because it watches out over society as a whole. It is vital to our nation that we preserve the institutions that uphold it. Nobody, not even Iron Man, should be able to avoid the law. Dura lex, sed lex.
"Quiet!" boomed Thor.
"Oh, great." sighed Strange.
Captain America was at first a stage performer who raised enthusiasm for war bonds. He was then sent to the Italian front to raise the morale of the troops, but Rogers was meant for more than wooden guns and paper shields. On November 3rd 1943, he coordinated and lead a rescue mission to free over 300 Allied POW's from a German internment camp, among them his childhood best friend, James Barnes. His spectacular success lead to him being placed in charge of a group of special forces, the "Howling Commandos," which enjoyed some of the highest allied mission success raids. Rogers, called a tactical mastermind by his superiors, carried out over a hundred raids on German bases and outposts. His bravery, well-known among the men at the front, manifested itself when he boarded a German airplane headed for the continental USA. To save millions at home, he made the ultimate sacrifice and brought the plane down over the arctic ocean.
The girl began crying. "My mother. Where's my mother?"
"You gave Stark your word." said Wanda.
"I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life." Gamora lamented.
"What do you know?" asked Star-Lord.
"And what did you imagine?" asked the king.
Soul-bonding was a rare occurrence with only 3500 bonding confirmation in America since the early seventeenth century. The rarest and ultimate bond of soul-bonding was called the Twin-Flame, they claimed to have spent many past reincarnations together.
Leyenar smirked.
"Okay, fine." Tony grumbled.
The issue of proportionality is another one altogether. Our idea of vigilantism is based largely on literature, as it rarely occurs on a significant scale outside of fiction. In fiction, vigilantes are violent, but they are not killers. Out of the good of their hearts (or convenient alliances, or tragic pasts) they do not kill. However, fictional vigilantes are, without exception, violent in their attempt to remove injustices and "villains" from the world. Violence, as the modern film-going audience has become used to it, is sanitized, bloodless - with the obvious exception of horror-style crime movies like Pulp Fiction and the works of directors like David Cronenberg. It does not really bother us that violent justice has become a normative representation of justice, because we are so used to violence being a thing without real consequence. This is one of the reasons fictional vigilantes do not kill, as killing is an act with a definite consequence in the movie world. That being said, our real world is not like the movies. Even what we might be tempted to consider low-level violence has real and permanent consequences, and only inspires others to seek violent solutions to problems. This is the reason our justice system is not violent. Vigilantism thus undermines both justice and peace by perpetuating violence.
But before she could finish her sentence, something came crashing through the roof. It was Bruce Banner. The Cloak of Levitation swirled around Strange's shoulders immediately.
" It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet—" Before Tony could finish his sentence, Ebony Maw created a spike of earth that threw him far up, and attacked the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summoned the Shield of the Seraphim.
"Whaddaya mean?" asked Bruce.
Yes, indeed, they were, in accordance with the Fate's designs and Time's past illustrations...
"What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?" said the driver. Peter jumped out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He made his way hastily towards the ship.
"What happened?" asked Mantis.
Palpatine:Ant-Man will go molecular between time and space, and come back in the past meeting up with Captain Marvel, and they will work together to destroy Thanos in the sequel.
Meanwhile, on the ringship, Leyenar, Tony, Strange and Peter were nearing Titan. "Hey, what's going on?" asked Peter.
"Okay, and then you're like, "Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?" "Oh! Someone's watching." "I'm gonna go in my pants." joked the genius.
"On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals." Ross reminded him.
"Where to, Cap?" asked Sam.
"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need." said Thor. "I assume you're the captain, sir?" he asked Rocket.
"You knew I'd come." Gamora snapped.
"You told me that too." said Thanos as he sat on the steps to his throne. "Every day. For almost twenty years."
"Yeah, he has!" said Rocket.
"A best friend?"
Tony looked around the ship. "Just 'cause I'll...probably not make it back for a while."
Tony walked towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect. "And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening." he said, irritably.
Everyone stares at Zod.
"It's not you I'm worr—Hey, whatcha doing there, Lyla-Pyla?"
"That was a mistake." sneered Thanos. He borrowed Corvus's glaive then stabbed Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.
"You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!" cried Eitri as he assaulted Thor.
Tony drew in a shaky breath. "Come on. We got a situation." He led Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouched to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder. "See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go."
"Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it." Vision replied.
The Guardians nodded or waved farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot departed. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers, watching them from afar, murmured "Don't you dare interfere unless told otherwise, report immediately to the Director and the Supreme Accuser when you notice romantic interactions between Star-Lord and Gamora. Keep a safe distance."
hitch-hike onto
"The Thanos killing kind." Thor replied.
"Field trip to MoMA." Suddenly, Black Dwarf grabbed Peter and threw him away. "What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?" asked Peter.
"I like you." Thanos told Star-Lord, and then teleported himself and Gamora away. The Reality Stone's effects disappeared once they left.
Gamora looked at him, and her haughty smile turned into a panicked gasp as she realized what was coming. "No. This isn't love." she tried to protest.
"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone." Thanos declared.
"You're totally rambling." Pepper replied.
"The Avengers broke up. We're toast."
Palpatine:Not you, Deadpool! It's an actual dead pool. Now get out of here!
"Y'know what?" said Star-Lord. "You guys have NO feel for dramatic tension!" He then closed his eyes and pulled the trigger, but instead of laser beams, bubbles came out. Thanos was playing him.
"How could you marry her? How did this happen?!" The Moon Prince paced back and forth with his hands in his hair, trying to make sense of the world. The Sun Soldier was so kind and caring, he was gentle, he loved too much. He was brilliantly smart and funny. He was lonely, how could he have ever met the Dawn Bringer? It wasn't possible, this was just some kind of joke. He looked at the Soldier, silently pleading with him to deny it.
"THANOS!" yelled Drax as he flung a blade at Strange, who neatly deflected it with a mystical shield, and in return sent the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Tony had a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pinned Tony face-first to a structure.
손대지 마시오=Keep Your Hands Off
said Memory Nebula.
3. And maybe because the holy-bagumba-ness of it all had caused our d-i-r-e-c-t-o-r to...
"Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight." ordered T'Challa.
"Oh, boy. Adoptive father. Technically, she hates him as much as you do." said Star-Lord, and Thor calmed down instantly.
Leyenar begged.
Iron Monger:Remember Quicksilver, man?
The question now becomes clear: where's the war that's given Stark his mandate? Of Stark is neither a superhero, due to the lack of war, nor a mutant, due to his lack of an X-gene, he lacks a mandate for action. Iron Man has been spotted at the site of several violent altercations both in the Middle East and in the US, but is not restrained by either national or international law, and can thus act with impunity. At this point in time, the obvious classification of Iron Man is a vigilante. Vigilantism, the diligent reader will recall, is illegal, and for good reason. Citizens taking the law into their own hands without the expertise of our first responders and legal officials are sure to undermine, rather than strengthen, the rule of law. Essentially, Iron Man is either an open invitation for any idiot with a spandex suit to take "justice" into his own hands, or an admission that those with money and power can do as they please.
Thanos found himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opened his hand and saw that he now has the orange Soul Stone.
"He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard." Meanwhile, Wong and Strange fought Maw. Maw lifted several bricks from the ground and turned them into sharp points. He sent them towards Wong and Strange. The two made portals and boomeranged them back towards Maw. Maw moved a car to protect himself, but one spike still hit his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw used a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious. Strange snapped a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanked, but Maw flew forward with the pull and pinned Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.
Clint nodded, like this happened often, taking a few steps towards the little girl. "Why, she having a date tonight?"
The Fire Star Warrior was one of the seven sons of the Ruler of the Heavens, charged with the duty to protect and watch over the festival of lights as it happened each year. He was also titled the Shining Lord's Guardian many years before the birth of Midgard. The revered position of High King's Guardian changed every few hundred years when one was felled in battle or retired to pursue family and the peace that Death brings. Fate, despite the Star Warrior's every effort, had planned her newest guardian to bring the Shining Lord's demise.
"Stabbed through the heart."
"You got some nerve. I'll give you that." Ross insisted.
Palpatine:So be it. I thought we'd start a dead pool on how many heroes Thanos is officially going to kill.
"Nah." replied Strange.
"...Director?" said Star-Lord.
Here's a short explanation of how Ultron can be the reincarnation of Ion:
"Protecting your reality, douchebag."
Everyone:Ooh ooh! Yes! Me me me!
"Just stay out of his way, you know the Dawn Bringer has a temper." He warned, but the little kids just stuck their tongues out and danced around him in circles. Would Sun like to come to a wedding with him? The Moon Prince had never really thought about bringing him down to his home. Going up to the Sun Soldier's domains, he felt like a different person. He wasn't a failure, he was the eldest son of the ruler of Heaven. People thought he was important and more than that, the Soldier liked him.
A mechanical hum grew louder as Tony approached the intersection. As he turned the corner, he saw a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.
Your soulmate understands and connects with you in every way and on every level, which brings a sense of peace, calmness and happiness when you are around them. And when you are not around them, you are all that much more aware of the harshness of life, and how bonding with another person in this way is the most significant and satisfying thing you will experience in your lifetime. You are also all that much aware of the beauty in life because you have been given a great gift and will always be thankful.
Act I-The Coming Of Thanos
Meanwhile, Tony was snapping out orders. "FRIDAY, evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
Yesterday, the nation celebrated as the bombing of Nagasaki brought about what has so long been desired: peace. Today, we mourn as the true cost becomes clear. There are no figures from the fronts yet as to the number of dead, but speculation can only be placed in the millions. Among all those heroes that gave their life to defend freedom and democracy, we honor one in particular. Captain Steven Grant "America" Rogers was revealed today to have been killed in action on March 4th 1945, while stopping a German bomber from reaching New York.
Seconds later, the Time Stone was seated in Leyenar's Infinity Gauntlet, safe and sound. The director began giggling maniacally, and declared
"Uh uh."
"You have second thoughts?" asked the secretary.
The general nodded eager. The Prince stifled a chuckle at his friend's giddiness. "But, it is ultimately up to the Shining Lord. He must choose for himself."
"Rupees."
"The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks." Okoye replied as everybody got off the quinjet.
asked Leyenar.
"And they can clearly find us." replied Wanda.
. And do you wanna know why? Because you love
Carol had dropped Leyenar in front of Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, telling her that "See you soon!" As soon as Leyenar entered the place, she saw Dr. Strange himself, dressed in casual American clothes, proceeding down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.
just say "hitherto undreamed of"?" asked Tony, leaning on a cauldron.
"I know."
Deadpool:(popping in the door) Did somebody say Deadpool?
"I had a dream about it. It was so real."
"Now? Really?" said Gamora.
Yet, even with such greatness, he was not immune to the temptation of love.
Mantis gasped. "He just did it again!"
It had been two days ago, when Tony had—not so legally—gotten notice of the document. Ever since, he had researched every law paragraph, every draft, every e-mail he could locate in an effort to understand what was going to happen.
Palpatine:Well, everyone, it has been a long time coming but it is finally time for our janitor, Thanos, to finally go out and make a name for himself.
She sighed, and said "I do hope there's no monster in your closet. And don't you dare bring Director Leyenar up again! She's a bitch and a banana."
"It means get lost, Squidward!" Tony snapped.
"I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?" Tony told him.
Leyenar retaliated, and revealed two action figures.
"Then stay. Stay with me." Vision pleaded. Wanda looked down, but then her eyes and attention drifted to her left.
." Yes, Tony did love Pepper but he couldn't stand it when she said these
Loki stood with the Black Order. He watched Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette. "I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right...yet to fail, nonetheless." said the Titan, as he lifted Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggled feebly. "It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say...
"He gave you his eye?" asked Thor.
Dr. Strange was now fully in his mage attire, and he shared a look with Wong. "Who?"
(Bridge)
Rhodey sounded a little bitter. "That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that." he said, glancing down at his leg bracers.
"But...but there's no way!" said Maw. "How could a scrawny earthling like you possibly...?"
"How many did you see?" asked Star-Lord.
Deep inside, Tony had always known that paying for reconstruction and smiling at a few cameras wouldn't be enough this time around. He had known that something had been in the works, had known that, come the time, they would have to face the consequences of their actions. For a long while now, it was just a matter of when and in what form those consequences would be laid bare for them.
"What the stone was warning me about." He kissed her hand. "I have to go."
"If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?" Thor replied. He sniffed and hastily wiped below his eye before standing up and sitting at the front of the pod, beside Groot.
Zod:All I know is if you kill Groot, I'm gonna be totally pissed.
"We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives." Wong added.
the director exclaimed.
" Strange retaliated.
"Hey, we haven't officially met." Peter offered the Cloak his hand to shake. It ignored his offer and continued to Dr. Strange. "Cool." said Peter.
Cap=Captain America
"Right." smiled Pepper.
Little did anybody know that everything will soon be put at great stake, and long-hidden secrets would soon be unfolded.
Okoye's kimoyo beads chimed out an alarm, she flicked one bead into her palm, where it projected the globe with a pulsing location marker. "Something's entered the atmosphere." she exclaimed.
And Tony still hadn't told Steve what was coming for them.
"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nidavellir." said Thor.
"$250,000."
We begin our story of strife and glory in a local cinema, somewhere in South Korea. The year was 2015, and Director Leyenar Oh was just 12 by the time she first phased into the MARVEL Cinematic Universe. She somehow knew that she had been chosen by the One Above All, to bring salvation to everybody in the MARVEL multiverse. And that was when she was first introduced to Ultron—Yoshida Ultron, the Steve/Tony matchmaker, who went on a rampage, forgetting his true duties. Leyenar wondered for quite some time if she can ever get to persuade Ultron. That was when Hawkward's little daughter gave her hope.
He'd never had a best friend before, but he had fallen into the Sun Soldier's life like he was a missing piece. It was shocking how well they fit, laughing together, playing tricks and pranks, challenging each other with stupid dares. Even when the Soldier was shy or reluctant, the Prince could always coax him into trouble that more often than not resulted in them running for their immortal lives, chased by angry spirits or annoyed imps.
"Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you."
There was a humming sound, then Clint picked Lyla up, a small squeal filling the air, as he held her with her upper body all but slung over his shoulder. "How about we go upstairs and you tell me all about Tasha's wedding, guest list, cake choice, music, flower arrangement, don't leave any detail out."
"As long as you can give me." replied Shuri.
"I'm trying. He won't come out."
"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?" asked Rhodey.
"Show me." said a satisfied Thanos.
Corvus Glaive pinned Vision down and dug the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone. Wanda commited her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifted Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where Wanda drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway. "The blade. It stopped me from phasing." Vision said.
She sighed. “CEO of one of the biggest, most complex corporations in the world? The one who has to clean up after superhero messes? Your-”
Tony let out a strangled groan, and his hips thrust up without his input. “Ohh... Just, being here, like this, kind of a fantasy, really.” He pulled himself together a little. “Um... I, you keep mentioning bruises. I want... Oh, God, I want you to give me bruises, I want to feel your hands on me even when you're not in the room, I-” Just the thought of it had him suddenly so turned on he could barely think.
He blatantly ignored her interruption. “-who has been so steadfast, and loyal, and have I mentioned lately how grateful I am for all that you have done for me, for years now? I know I'm kind of a handful...” He couldn't help leering a little at the innuendo.
But the last thing! He eyed Tony doubtfully as they both sat up. “That's a carpet beater. You want me to beat you like a carpet?”
him, and so he focused on leaving a major love bite in the space between the collarbone and the arc reactor. The helpless, breathless little moans of pleasure falling from Tony's lips, and the needy little hitches of his hips, made him feel so powerful that it bubbled up in a growl. Tony shivered all over.
Tony dropped the bottle of lube next to Steve's hand, and pulled back a little to gulp air. “I want... oh, God, I want you inside me, but you're huge, you're going to have to prep me a bit first, please, I want you to...” And he dove back into the kiss, trying to ignore how he felt more exposed emotionally than physically at the moment, which was weird, right? He was vaguely aware of Steve fumbling behind his back with the lube, and then Steve broke the kiss so he could peer over Tony's shoulder and down his back.
Steve glared around, as if said dogs would leap out from behind every tree at him. “I just- what is the
Tony made a noise of agreement that was about half purr. “Yeah, seriously wow.” He took a deep breath. He could do this, had to do this, before they got too entangled. He raised his head so he could look Steve in the eye, and wow, that was going to make everything way harder, because Steve's pupils were blown out, his lips swollen and red, and he was just gorgeous. No, he had to- “Steve, god, you have no idea how much I want- But I'm screwed up, I screw up everyone around me, you shouldn't-”
There was nothing in Tony's world anymore but Steve's voice, the sweet fire Steve's hands had made of every inch of his skin (except those few inches that craved it the most), and the deliciously obscene feeling of Steve's cum filling him up and dripping (
Steve smiled and freed one hand from his towel to hold out to his husband-to-be. “Tony, then. Please, call me Steve. And why would they show me any portraits? No one cares what I think of you, as long as I stand before the priest with you tomorrow.”
He had just started on the heavy bag when JARVIS interrupted. “Captain Rogers, Ms Potts would like to speak with you, if you are available.”
. It sounded sappy, like something out of a romance picture, but right now he felt like he and Tony were... destined to meet, like all that time in the ice was so they could be adults together, be
pretty weird. “JARVIS? Do you know what this is about? How's his health, really?” She got up to pace.
Steve recoiled bodily, almost comically, from that. “You had to
He couldn't help laughing at that. “God, no. I feel like I'm more alive than I've ever been!” He cleared his throat, trying to maintain focus on Pepper. “And it's only a little favor, just part of your day.  I just want you to get me a press conference. No rush, actually, what's today, the 28th? You got a couple weeks, then. I'm aiming for Thursday the 11th, maybe late morning? Nothing to do with the company, totally a personal thing, but you know how I hate arranging these things myself, especially when you're so much better at them anyway.” He had too much energy to sit still, he had to get up and pace.
him, shifting just enough that he could never get the angle he was half-consciously aiming for.
started in the background, Steve settled Tony onto the couch and knelt between his legs, hands finding their natural place on Tony's hips. “So I'm pretty sure you promised me another class in 'blow jobs'. I figured now was a good time.” Before Tony could put together a sentence, Steve was wrapping his lips around Tony's mostly-soft cock. To his utter surprise, Tony felt it twitch, stir, and start to fill.
“Tony, no!” But Steve was already too late. The electronic panel Tony had been kneeling in front of (without the armor, dammit!) went from sparking and spitting to full-on exploding, sending Tony flying across the room. He smacked shoulder-first against a statue of a person, but instead of continuing his fall to the ground, Tony was caught as the statue’s arms wrapped around him in a parody of a hug. A moment later, the statue went back to its original position, and Tony dropped onto his (perfectly round, wonderfully bouncy-
anything! It's just a whole block's weekly trash, piled up randomly and trying to be
Steve grinned at him. “I dunno. I think I might need lots and lots of practice, to be sure I'm getting it right...”
give the team an eyefull.) He headed through Tony's  -
Bruce curled up in an armchair, cradling a tea mug in both hands. “The problem is, which ones? There have been so many...”
Tony lifted his head, grinning at- oh, my god, was Steve Rogers his boyfriend? He felt his grin getting even bigger. “Good morning yourself. I might even say great morning, but that might ruin my rep as a laid-back guy.”
Tony closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and gave a little nod, not even pretending to misunderstand. “Honest. Only for you, Cap.” He let out a little laugh, and opened his eyes. Steve was looking concerned. “Yeah, see. I'm not so good about...” He could do this... “One of the nice things about being a Dom, especially with, ah, short-term encounters, is that the sub tells you what they're looking for, and what their limits are, and you go. No need to open up back, you know? I, ah. I'm not great with talking about...” Steve gave him Smile No. 73, I Know You're Deflecting, I Can Wait You Out; Tony sighed and rested his forehead on Steve's shoulder. “The truth is, I don't trust anyone. A week ago, I would have said there would never be anyone in the world I trusted enough to let hurt me recreationally, let alone get me far enough into subspace to be really worth it.” He lifted his head, feeling unspeakably vulnerable, but needing to look in Steve's eyes. “But you! Part of me wants to take absolutely anything you want to give me, and I know that that's actually a really bad idea, I know how strong you are, I still want to
His ass cheeks hit Steve's thighs, and he realized he had taken Steve in, right down to the balls.
They ate quietly, still slowly waking up, feeding each other random bits of sinfully delicious food, and Steve was both utterly surprised and utterly unsurprised at how comfortable, how perfect everything was. He knew he was grinning like a sap, but then again so was Tony.
Steve slid his fingers through Tony's hair. “Good pet. Sleep now?” Tony was startled at his first two words, and more so at the rush of affection (and relief? Where did that come from?) that flooded him, but he was also suddenly far too tired to think about that or anything else. He tossed the washcloth in the general direction of the hamper, gathered up the blankets, and laid down with his head on Steve's shoulder and one of his thighs draped over both of Steve's. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist, and Tony slid happily into sleep.
Clint snickered behind them. “Have fun, kids. Don't get arrested for public indecency!”
Tony's lips closing over the chopsticks was blatantly pornographic. “Seems appropriate for this weekend then. Now I'll have to come up with even more firsts for you to be fond of.” He was delighted that, even thought he blushed, Steve gave him a pornographic grin in response.
Steve sighed, and tried not to squirm as much as he wanted to. “Yeah, and then I was in a war, and then nearly everyone assumed I was dead for a few decades, and then I was living in SHIELD barracks... Not all of us have the urge for
. I was thinking I could just order Chinese, and we can watch movies on the couch.” He tried to look hopeful but not pathetically eager.
She raised one eyebrow. “Don't even try. He came in this morning looking like he should have cute fuzzy woodland creatures frolicking around him, and JARVIS says you spent last night with him. So, what are your intentions? I should tell you that if you break his heart, I will be obligated to bury you in several shallow graves.” She looked at him expectantly.
"You too, Rhodey." replied Steve as they all gathered for a group hug.
And to Leyenar, it all began with that
It was one such year, as the Star Warrior sneaked down, in hope of grabbing some of the famed apples when he found not just the fruit but the Apple Princess herself, daughter of the ruler of Earth. Instantly enamored, he forgot all about his original intent and instead whisked her up away into the heavens.
"You should have shirts in your closet."
"Well, if we don't do our jobs." Strange said. "Ha, in your face, Tin Man!"
"Aye, aye, captain." replied Wanda.
"Asgard is destroyed." said Thor, stopping Eitri mid-strike. "Eitri, the glove. What did you do?" the Thunder God asked.
Clint chuckled. "Ohh…big thing, huh?"
"Well, he's never fought me." declared Thor.
"Arrest them." Ross ordered Rhodey.
"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal:To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre..." said Gamora.
"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back." said Rhodey.
"It's okay. Hey, stand down." said Tony, then he turned to Wong and said "Keep an eye on him. Thank you.".
"You know, I'm 1500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so." Thor explained.
"No." said Bruce.
Thor wasn't listening, and stared at the soup spoon in his hands. "I need a hammer, not a spoon…" He attempted to fiddle with machinery. "How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… Maybe a birth date or something…"
"Maybe. But..." Tony sighed.
"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own." said Ross.
"Who's there? What are you talking about?" Her questions tripped over each other, voice quavering more than she truly wanted to admit. At that moment, the voice was recognized, and her hands began to shake.
"I'm gonna make a call." said Bruce. Wong nodded in understanding and closed the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of this arc. Bruce held Steve Rogers' cell phone and made a call.
"I know somewhere." said Steve. And so they all went to Wakanda because they knew a certain
"Um. Okay, okay... uh..." said Peter as he and the Cloak popped back upright. "Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?"
M. Brian
"Not anymore." replied the colonel. Just then, the fugitive Avengers entered the room, Vision supported by Sam. Steve was the first one to get in and address Ross.
