As I climb down, my eyes scan the other corners of the war room, noticing an uncomfortable pattern. Trying not to look too out-of-the-ordinary, I pack up my supplies and retrace my steps through the bunker, wandering past the boys’ dormitories as I go.
(“If you’re served a sandwich with onion rings on the side, but you don’t like onion rings, what would you do with them?”
“Come on, Cas,” Dean scoffed. “You gotta know that without any of us, you’d still…. You wouldn’t be the kind of person to shit on someone else first, ask questions later.”
Castiel looked back at his laptop screen—at the judgmental blinking of the cursor only one sentence into his fifth chapter. “I don’t have time for this.”
“He talked about a lot of places. Said he’d take me to the beach and to see rollercoasters and even to space if I wanted—even though I told him you had to be bigger to go into space for real. I don’t think he was telling the truth—and Mommy told me never to trust people that lie. Cas wasn’t lying. He said I could have a backyard with a swing and as many books as I wanted.”
“Uh huh,” Sam responds, as Dean’s mood plummets rapidly—like a falling star burning up the closer it comes to Earth’s atmosphere.
“I—” Dean takes a deep breath and puts on a pseudo-confident grin. “—was gonna do a Star Wars movie marathon and I wondered if you wanted to join me?”
now. We can’t hang out at his place because it could be awkward for Lisa, and we’re avoiding the press, so we don’t go out that much. But it doesn’t matter because they know to come
He pushed his chair away so that he could squat down near her legs. “Tell me—” he pleaded with her. “What’s the right thing to do here? Because I… Everything’s a mess—and no matter how I look at it, it just gets messier. And I may not be Ben’s father, but I’m for
An opportunity presented itself sooner than expected when Sam went to fetch his morning coffee. Cas was, once more, in the kitchen, this time with his head bowed over his phone. He glanced up when Sam came in, but to the hunter’s relief, went back to texting Claire almost immediately.
“Well, that fits,” his partner grumbles. “He’s a Caucasian male. 30. Moved here from Chicago about a year ago and--” Benny stops to whistle. “Looks like he opened up his own martial arts teaching center. He’s trained in five different kinds of self-defense. How do you figure the Angel Killer got to him? This guy didn’t go anywhere without a fight.”
“A bit,” Castiel admitted reluctantly. “And it’s near lunchtime, so I’m sure you are too. Unfortunately, my grocery shopping has been a bit more whimsical than practical of late.”
“So, has anyone here done one of these before?” the staffer asked to a chorus of “no”s. “Well then, you better hope you’re good problem solvers—if you want to escape alive!” From the overhead speakers came the prerecorded sound of bats shrieking. It was followed by metaphorical crickets.
“Gabriel!” Anna hisses, the effect somewhat ruined by how she’s blinking back tears. “Just be serious for once in our goddamn lives.”
“Cas,” Sam breaks in gently. “You do know we want you around…just to have you around, right? To watch movies or listen to music or just hang out with us in the library…Right?”
“There is a botanical garden and bee sanctuary in California--” And even though that sounds only slightly less suck-ass than Sam’s thing, Dean lets Cas ramble on for a few more sentences about
Castiel wandered over to the food table, justifying to himself that he could do another half an hour on the treadmill in exchange for loading his plate with a few more of the mini Philly cheesesteak sandwiches that the crew had put out.
Dean huffed, though he seemed distracted by one piece of Cas’s hair that had stuck to his forehead and curled from sweat. He brushed it to the side. “You having fun though?” he asked.
Dean’s frown thins slightly before he jabs a finger in Sam’s direction. “The next time someone brings this up, you
Sam opens the door to Dean’s room at 7 o’clock in the morning to find his brother clasping his watch to his wrist.
“Did you have a good night with Benny?” Cas asked, twisting his grip around himself as he reached the head—his hips automatically canting upward in pleasure.
For once, Dean doesn’t care what Sam needs. He feels cornered by the stuff his brother might know about him—maybe even stuff he didn’t know about himself—and why? Why, on top of the dying and getting reborn and the monsters and the PTSD should he have to worry about his every worst thought and desperate breakdown being found on a bookshelf next to frickin’ James Patterson.
“Because,” Castiel says, giving himself another pause he shouldn’t need. “We’re about to destroy it.”
“Hi, I’m Dean,” he says, before looping his arm around soulmate. “And this is Cas, who has never seen a single episode of Dr. Sexy in his entire life. Poor, deprived man.”
His outfit suggests he isn’t here playing Special Agent. She probably wouldn’t blow his cover by going over to him at the bar and saying ‘hi.’ But she can’t help watching a little more.
“Come on, Charlie, we’re not that bad—” Dean protested. Although, he’d have an easier time believing himself if the laptop wasn’t still flashing a slideshow of their pictures—Dean holding a door of the Impala open for Cas; them eating sandwiches on her hood; standing on either side of Baby, talking, while Dean pumped gas….
Silence wrapped around them like a weighted blanket. The burning in Castiel’s soulmark eased to a warm glow.
He wishes he could read Dean’s eyes—to see if he is truly content where he is—thinking that might help him make his decision. But the hunter doesn’t look into the distance the way he used to stare at Castiel, and he can see nothing in them but familiar green-gold specks. Another leaf falls.
“I know it’s early days,” I say, once I’m sitting on the edge of the bed, having convinced Cas to take the chair (“Standing over me like that is weird, Dude.”) “But you
Just below that was a message from Charlie—a video of a tiny black kitten making a pitiful but adorable attempt to leap onto a counter. She didn’t want pets herself but had been trying to stoke his own wistful thoughts of cat adoption, saying she would be the “Best Aunt Ever.”
Let’s start with a name,” Dean’s breathing hard through his teeth, the soulmark on his arm burning again. It’s all becoming too real, looking at his Dad’s dead eyes. That could be him the day after tomorrow.
“Really?” Dean asked, eagerly. “Wanna split? And one of us can get fries while the other gets onion rings.”
I wasn’t even allowed to sign his school permission forms—not that the teacher really cares if there’s a scribble on the dotted line, but… I forged all Sammy’s forms when he was a kid. Figured I should be allowed to do it legally just once.”
Castiel watches Dean fix the outdoor AC condenser, the hunter cursing much less than he would have expected, and wonders why he tortures himself by coming here. He knows that he could go to Dean now, ask for aid, and the hunter would do it. But it would shatter his peace in the process. And the worst part is, a part of Castiel wants to ask anyway—not because Dean may be able to help him defeat Rafael, but simply because Castiel would rather have Dean at his side than at Lisa’s and Ben’s.
“He was there, you know,” I say instead. And it should scare me how much the almost-growl I make feels more natural against my throat than my regular voice. “Cas and some other douche angels went back and watched Azazael break into Sam’s room. Watched Mom barge in. That’s why they sent you on your little time travel journey.
The overhead fan in the room spun, casting strange shadows over Sam’s face while he seemed to weigh his options. “Yeah. Something did,” he admitted at last. “…but I can’t tell you what.”
“A clusterfuck.” Hundreds of people all claiming to be his ‘one’, showing up with fake marks, knowing he doesn’t remember who it is anyway. Not to mention, there’s a good chance that anyone who he’s meant to be with wouldn’t speak up at all—too creeped out by all the attention.
“So, the Casting Director is usually in charge of looking through early resumes and tapes,” Balthazar continued. “We’ll be reviewing four of their recommendations for Michael today. Once we have him cast, we’ll start looking into other roles, since those actors will need to have chemistry with the lead.”
“‘Fraid not, Brother,” comes Benny’s (usually) soothing drawl. “Just letting you know we were able to reach Judge Mosley and she signed the search warrants.” He pauses. “I’ll admit, I’m still wondering what lit a fire under your pants about this guy
“Well, I--” Dean abruptly stops himself. Had he really been about to tell the guy he was somewhat crushing on about the time Rhonda Hurley slipped a pair of pink panties into his back pocket without him knowing it, so that when he got up to do his Spanish presentation, there was no way Señora Alvarez wouldn’t see them? He used to be smooth, right?— “You know, late assignments, mouthing off. That kind of thing,” he answers instead.
scary smart. And you already call me out my shit. But at the same time, I know you would put your ass on the line for me in a heartbeat—just like you would for anyone who hasn’t given you a reason to distrust them yet. Not to mention, you’re kinda nice to look at….” Dean gives him a slightly lecherous smile, but then almost instantly becomes more serious. “Anna and Gabe and Jack—their lives are all better for having you in it. So, soulmate or not, you can’t blame me for wanting to keep you around…if that’s something you want too.”
Cas glares at him—but probably not as hard as he will once Dean changes the ringtone on his cellphone.
And even though Castiel had predicted that this was where Dean’s mind would go, now that the moment was here, he couldn’t
react. Because apparently, he’d gone from the being the one Sam turned to when he was nervous about asking Amy Pond to the middle school dance to the one that he needed to hide that shit from.
Dean’s younger brother had gone back to school for his fall semester a month or so ago, leaving Dean in a grumpy mood for days. Castiel suspected that his soulmate’s reaction would have been even
He took so long trying to decide what next step to take that he didn’t notice that Dean and Benny had gotten out of the trailer and were walking toward the main studio building. Not until Dean stopped mid-step to turn to him, at least. “Cas?” the actor called out, squinting against the sun.
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas could see Dean—no longer laughing, but now watching the two of them intently as the makeup department padded some sweat from his forehead and nose. It reminded him of the first conversation he and Lisa ever had when Dean had informed them that they weren’t “allowed to be friends.”
” Dean muttered, gruffly, and even though Castiel never liked the insecurity in Dean’s voice, he would admit that this time, it sent a warm feeling curling through him.
“You’re close, sugar,” Professor Mosely promises, and even from here, Dean feels like he can see the guy blush. “He actually moved there after college and has lived there ever since.
And, for sure, the corners of his little brother’s mouth are twitching up at the corners. “It’s a real nice offer, Cas, and I’ll definitely take you up on it—but let’s just stick to PG-13 vocab, OK?”
“What’s your favorite dinosaur?” the seven-year-old finally asked, voice solemn. Castiel relaxed, marginally.
“Yeah, well, that’s how it’s supposed to work, isn’t it?” Dean observed, unable to keep the slight tinge of bitterness out of his voice.
“Mmnhhhhh,” Dean let out a desperate-sounding noise only a second later, as his head tipped back and Castiel’s mouth was suddenly flooded with a musky, bitter flavor that still wasn’t his favorite taste in the world, but which he swallowed down in small increments, extending Dean’s pleasure until it turned into oversensitivity. The actor flopped over onto his side of the bed.
And yet, Cas took it as somewhat of a good sign that the actor hadn’t completely stormed out of the room.
Dean decided not to push it, swinging his arm up and over Lisa’s shoulder so that everyone wouldn’t be so crammed in.
And it was like a circuit breaker in Dean’s brain tripped, lights going out all over the place. “You
“The Angel of Thursday,” Sam supplied and Castiel had to blink a few times in surprise. “Are your parents religious then?”
Now, Dean has never been the kind of person to believe in that ‘if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it all’ bullshit, but he does manage to spare Kevin the number of creative curse words going through his mind at the moment.
And in that moment, Castiel felt it—the last lingering tightness in his soulmark—unwind like it had been massaged away. He hadn’t even realized it was still there until it was gone. And just like that, they were Dean and Cas again, completely. They might be other things too—soulmates or maybe lovers-to-be. But they were most importantly
Dean’s frown deepened. However, this time, during his sweep, he finally caught sight of the author’s barely-there smile. “You fucker. You don’t have a car here, do you?”
“Now why don’t I? Because one night Planet Earth got a little too tipsy and decided to get a ‘Property of the Winchesters’ tramp stamp, which makes everything that happens to it our responsibility.”
Sam stares at the text. Stares at what his brother crossed out of the text. Stares at the door his brother just walked out of. And then back at the book again. Did this mean…? Were they really…?
Cas shakes his head, grabs his seeds, and then turns on his heel and leaves, Dean watching him go like he’s suddenly grown two heads.
“Holy soulmark, Batman!” Charlie gasps at his side, which is apparently the signal for everyone in the room to start talking again—the noise like a dozen TVs that someone is turning up, up, and up.
numbers, not just crunch them.” As they talk, Dean buttons a black vest over Cas’s royal blue T-shirt, an outfit they’d bought specifically for this case. Of course, Cas is probably perfectly capable of putting on his clothes himself, but neither he nor Sam have mentioned that.
“Well, if this particular Hallmark movie moment is over, I should probably--” Dean begins once he’s done with his drink. He gestures towards the door with his empty bottle.
“So, Cassie…” the producer grinned. Castiel groaned internally. “I have to ask… What kind of man did you picture Michael as? Have to say, I’ve never read a book that didn't mention what the main character looked like before.”
sounded like me—but now you’re back to drumming along to Blue Oyster Cult? Want to make any more pit stops for
They only have a few seconds to look at him like he’s insane before Benny is once again at his side, spinning him around. “Now, I have followed your lead without questioning a lot the last coupla days, but right now, you’re gonna stop and tell me what
“You said you were still angry,” Castiel reminded him, squinting at the actor from around the now-open freezer door. “I understand
“So, what have you guys been up to?” Sam asks when they’re all sitting down. There’s a slight hesitancy to his voice that means he’s worried Dean might still be annoyed with him.
“It’s an endangered species of bird—one of Hannah’s favorites. It’s her birthday next week so I donated to the World Wildlife Fund on her behalf, and they send you a plush to represent symbolic adoption. I was planning on getting a bag for it at some point.”
Even now, he knew it wouldn’t be long before they had to go back inside to the trailer—to Ben—and then, eventually go their separate ways for the night. Still, there was
Sam’s open expression instantly transformed into a scowl. “You know what, Dean, you’re not invited. Cas, d’you know two people who’d want to come?”
“Usually only get in about four hours a night.” - Dean said he gets about four hours of sleep a night in "The End" (5x4)
The two men might not sense emotions the way that he can, but they must be able to tell that he’s serious.
“Dean, it’s not that big of a deal,” Sam sighs, carefully navigating the stairs with his arms full of groceries.
Of course, Sam just took the seat next to him. “I mean, I was a bit… surprised… when you two moved in together.”
to her. And, boy, was she was willing to throw Zazael under the bus. Some people are so messed up that even their soulmates can’t stand them—hate them worse because they’re supposed to love them. Eve might have killed the fuckwad herself except she had a son she was raising on her own. Didn’t want to risk going to jail.”
stuff out. For one, his soulmate’s an early riser—so if Dean sleeps in too late, he’s likely to forget the dreams that they shared and only remember his own—hence the alarm and why he put the clock far enough away that he can’t press snooze twelve times in a row.
“Not really,” Dean responded, stripping the bed of its old sheets and replacing them with the higher-thread count ones he’d bought at
Meanwhile, the 2016 version of Dean keeps switching his gaze between them—and I realize he’s not used to this—to seeing it from the outside. Perhaps he doesn’t even
Castiel knew he had the familiar furrow between his eyebrows again, but he handed it over, regardless.
“Mud in the kitchen,” he says, jerking his thumb in that direction. “Castiel took his shoes off when he came home. Most people who do that ask their guests to do the same, but someone was wearing boots. Fight didn’t start there though. It started in the living room. So, what did he want in the kitchen?”
“Do you think me doing this… You think it’d make a difference?” he asked his friend, voice so low he couldn’t even be sure she heard it.
They stuck to polite questions about his latest acting project and Sam, which he’d answer in the most boring way possible. And then, with that social obligation out of the way, their conversation would turn to life at the country club or Lisa’s sister’s teaching gig, and he and Ben would get into their own thing. Last week, the two of them spent most of the time talking about which fast food mascot was the creepiest. Ben’s vote was for the Burger King—but Dean had seen enough horror movies to know that Wendy was
The quality of the audio sounded a bit off as Dean said, “Yeah. Sure,” before Cas hit ‘end’ and slipped the phone back in his pocket.
“Why? Because celebrities are known for their long-term, committed relationships?” Benjamin asks, dryly.
Unable to stop himself, Cas glanced over at Dean again, wanting to know if anger was still chiseled into every line of his body. Instead, he found the actor looking at him worriedly.
My comment seems to have fully drawn Dean into this conversation and Daphne’s eyes widen with recognition, “You.”
“I want to publicly come out as bi,” he managed, pushing through the statement like it was a line from a script.
“Goddammit, You boys better be on radio silent because you’re stalking something—not fallen into a trap like a bunch of Bambis. When you get this,
He didn’t believe his current inertia was permanent. He would be pathetic for a little while—and then, he’d get better—because that’s what life
that Dean was as happy as he could be with Lisa. That he wouldn’t like Cas much, even if they met. He had good reasons for those theories, but they had been wrong, and it could have cost him greatly. What if his assumptions about his father were wrong too?
” Gabriel said with a dismissive wave of his hands. “M’always underestimated in this family. I took care of him, shopped around Chinatown some, got a massage with a
It was a simple statement—nothing world-changing and perhaps not even true. And yet, for some reason, it lingered in his brain even after Dean had tucked himself in. His dad might have had dark hair. His dad might have had dark hair like

“So, how about you?” she prompts Dean, leaning back in her seat and shaking out of her thoughts. “Still saving the world?”
heard her say, “We’ll talk about this later,” in the ominous tone feared by boyfriends everywhere. Which meant that when a pimple-faced teenager—clearly trying to sneak a picture of them from the end of the alley—interrupted their heated whispering and she’d said—
“So, you’re Cas,” the man who must have been Sam Winchester greeted. He turned halfway in his seat to offer the author a handshake, just as Dean drove over a pothole that sent the whole car lurching a little bit. “Is that short for something? Dean didn’t say.”
“Well, Cas,” Sam says, reaching over to clap him on the shoulder. “We like having dinner with you, too.”
time together, not less. Maybe do some things with Ben, too. Not right away, but… eventually—so that he gets to know you as something
Later, when Dean goes to edit the footage, he saves the ten minutes of them bickering to show their test-tube babies someday.
Eventually, Dean pulled Cas back to rest his head on Dean’s shoulder, the way it had been during the movie. “The last time I said goodbye to you, we didn’t talk for a week,” the actor whispered like a confession. With the surprising crack in his voice, maybe it was.
But for now, lying together in their room, the rest of the world oblivious, destiel was still incredibly canon. And it was heavenly.
Across the street, Charlie was peering over a newspaper she held high over her face. “Just kiiiiiisss,” she groaned.
“Smartass,” Dean grumbles, but Castiel recognizes something fond beneath it. It’s enough to make them smile, and that softens Dean’s eyes.
“And Charlie— uh,” Dean fumbled for an explanation as to why Charlie couldn’t be naked with Cas. “She’s, uh— she’s a lesbian, and it would really suck if she was uncomfortable being naked with a guy all night, so—“
“So that’s how we fix this,” Charlie said. “Well, who’s up for some birthday suit cuddling with Cas? Sam?”
“Thanks.” Dean doesn’t move to leave right away. Instead, he considers something for a few moments before asking, “Hey, does she ever make pie?”
Charlie pursed her lips. “No,” she agreed, it’s not.” She seemed to consider something for a moment, then met his eyes, determined. “Let’s hit the books.”
Charlie was beaming, practically bouncing up and down with excitement as she scrolled through her music.
“Just kidding,” she said, waving him off. “And I don’t think we’re getting Cas into skinny jeans. Anyway, my point is— pretty much all the classic fanfiction tropes? If we get them to play out, then they’ll have to confront their feelings!”
“Oh,” Jack said, nodding seriously. “If we make him his coffee will he come in for birthday pancakes?”
get to be cowboys,” Dean corrected. He held up the other hat. “Well, oh-partner-of-mine, what do you say?”
Dean’s eyebrows raise almost comically. “Seriously?” he demands. “They— those fuckers. Can’t trust them.”
“Four, huh? You’re getting old,” Dean teased, then added, “How do you feel about birthday pancakes?”
Sam stuck the bags into his cart, lodging them between a few loaves of bread. He went back to looking for kale, tamping down an already triumphant smile.
“Dean Winchester,” Cas said, turning a charged look on him, “I raised you out of Hell. I believe that I’m entitled to some of your french fries.”
In all honesty, they were running out of feasible tropes and fanfic-esque scenarios to throw them into. Not that they had a lack of inspiration, far from it. But in Charlie’s words, how were they supposed to give Cas corporeal wings? Or exploit Dean’s cowboy obsession? They couldn’t quite zap the two of them into a western, or show Dean Cas’ wings without his eyes being burned out.
“The coat’s gotta go,” Charlie had decided while working her way through a pack of fruit snacks. “Dean would jump his bones if he saw what was under it.”
“Alright,” Charlie said. She popped an Oreo into her mouth, then cracked her knuckles. “Let’s do this.”
They stand there beaming at each other for another few moments before Castiel remembers that they have to finish the drinks for Dean. When they set them down for Dean to grab, he pulls a black sharpie out of his pocket and scribbles something onto one of them. He picks it up and holds it out to Castiel.
Harper Falls was a small, sleepy town. Any other time, Sam would have enjoyed it, but in places like these, everyone knew everyone, and unusual things stuck out, including new people. Like bubbly redheads and tall people. Or, a new gay couple.
Dean gave her a weird look. “Alright. Well, then I guess I’ll see you guys in a bit.” He turned and headed in the direction of the garage, clapping Cas on the shoulder as he passed him.
The man offers him a grin. “Hey. Uh, could I get—“ he looks up at the chalkboard. “—uh, a caramel latte, and…. Charlie says you guys have a good honey macchiato, but I don’t trust her. Can I get your professional opinion?”
There’s a crash and Charlie starts laughing. She laughs harder at whatever Dean says (it’s muffled, but Castiel thinks it sounds like “Cas isn’t my soulmate!”). When she turns back to them, she’s grinning widely. “He’s about as coordinated as a mountain troll, but you did good,” she tells them. Castiel is reminded of the way she had looked between them and Dean when she and Dean had first come to Busy Bee Coffee together, like she knows something.
“You can ride with me this time,” Dean said nonchalantly. “We’ll just come back for your pimpmobile another time—“
Dean flushes and looks away from Castiel. “That wasn’t— we weren’t—“ He looks helplessly back at them.
A smile began to spread across Charlie’s face. “Awesome. Luckily for you, I have a list of the most effective ways of getting my OTP to make out. Hold on, lemme get it….”
Charlie sat up. “Nope. Cas knows he’s in love with Dean, Dean knows he’s in love with Cas. They’re just… not doing anything about it.”
By the beginning of April, Castiel has a good idea of who their regulars are and when they like to come in. Monday seems to be a popular day. For the past six weeks, every Monday without fail, a man by the name of Balthazar shows up, orders the most complex drink he can, flirts excessively with both Meg and Castiel, then leaves. Kevin shows up as soon as they open, request for a red eye already on his tongue. Donna Hanscum, a local member of law enforcement, pops in every other week and takes two coffees to go, then sits outside Busy Bee in the police cruiser with her partner.
Rowena waved a hand, sending the four of them backwards and pinning them against the wall. “I’m sure you can fix it,” she said. “Castiel just needs a little skin to skin contact—“
It’s over two hours and three cups of coffee before he leaves, but when he does, there’s a little more life in his steps.
Sam and Charlie were grabbing food at a small restaurant when they overheard the women behind them gossiping.
“True.” Dean flipped the pancakes, offered Cas a grin, then turned to Jack. “So, birthday boy, what do you wanna do today?”
“All good things, I hope. Didn’t expect to see you here either, uh… Diane and Lacy!” came Dean’s voice.
“Hey, Cas,” he said, stepping inside. “Brought you some—“ He cut off abruptly, coffee mugs in hand forgotten as he noticed Cas’ clothes. Dean opened his mouth as though to say something, then snapped it shut, swallowing hard.
Cas tried on a wide array of clothes, all to the soundtrack of Angel With a Shotgun. The song wasn’t lost on him; halfway through, having traded his trench coat to try on a snug leather jacket, asked, “Is there a reason my montage song is about angels and love?”
“Serves them right,” Dean said almost petulantly. “That’s what they get for trying to set me up with my boyfriend.”
Charlie geeked out with Cas for about half an hour before she said out of the blue, “You know what would be great right now? Coffee. There was a coffee shop on Main Street I wanted to try while I’m here. Would you mind doing pickup, Cas?”
“They’ve given up,” Cas said, pulling the shirt over his head. “Sam didn’t want to involve tentacles and Charlie is out of ideas. They’re both very disappointed.”
They wait until Dean has a seat before moving back behind the counter. They don’t make his usual drink. Instead, they make something loaded with chocolate and whipped cream and honey. Those flavors always make Castiel feel better when they feel like shit. While they’re doing that, Meg nudges them and says, “I’ll take care of the line. You go help your unicorn.”
Charlie swatted his hand. “Don’t touch that! And they’re both oblivious, they’re never going to see us.” She turned her attention back to Dean and Cas.
“You know what, fuck you. Fuck both of you. I’m just… glad because we’ve been on the road for a while and no helicopters have shown up yet. Meaning that maybe I can actually see my own bed sometime this week.”
These facts were like scattered puzzle pieces laid in front of him. He wanted so badly to put them together—to see the larger picture. Except, he suspected, some of the pieces were superfluous; there wasn’t a place for them to fit.
“OK, OK, I get all that,” Sam insists. “And I can understand if you’re embarrassed or whatever. But, underneath all that, I hope you know that Dean’s not just running scared because of what he picked up from you…. It’s what he saw in himself, too.”
people said hundreds of thousands of times in their life. As toddlers, learning to walk by moving towards open arms. In loud whines when they don’t get something they want. Gentle, “Thanks, Dad” on birthdays and graduations. By contrast, Cas had used it much less often—and almost always in reference to other peoples’.
not the patience in them. “I also think it’s easier, you know? Talking to Cas and Charlie instead of you and Lis about that sorta stuff. Not because I trust them more, OK?” He quick-glanced at his brother again. “But there’s less pressure since they don’t have to
It takes him a minute for his brain to get in gear enough to realize he could be touching—really touching—Cas too. Slowly, he drops his hands down to slide them over Cas’s ass—beneath the loose fit of his jeans but over his boxers—helping bring the other man into the V between his bowed legs—and God, Cas’s broken whimper—the involuntary thrust of his hips….
A few follow-up questions reveal that Cas had already hired a lawyer for the adoption process—from Douchbags R Us—aka Crowley & Associates—aka where Sammy works. (His brother, of course, is the only non-douchebag there). Dean thinks of the half a dozen rejected calls on his phone and cringes.
She remembers this, too—though she thought she’d gotten used to it, in the over a year they spent together. After all, of course someone who just lost his younger brother while trying to avert the
“—but other than that, I don’t—it’s hard to think about him. Every once in a while, it just hits me out of the blue. Like the day I realized I forgot how he liked his coffee because I got used to making yours. I told you I was going out with my friends and then I spent the whole day hiding in one of the guest rooms, bawling my eyes out.”
“Thank you,” the security guard rumbles, face mostly hidden behind the boxes, when Dean opens the door for him.
Because since that day, if things have been bugging you, you’re right—I haven’t felt that. Not here,” Dean looked down at his chest, as if he could see through his shirt to where the bright green and purple phoenix lay. His throat sounded like a whistle. “…What if I broke it or something?”
For several minutes now, Dean’s mind had been floating between postcard-like images of beaches and Claymation-style Christmas cartoons, but suddenly, the other pieces of what Gabriel was saying fell into place. “Are you seriously giving me the ‘you hurt him, I’ll hurt you’ speech?” he asked, incredulously. “What? Am I picking Cas up for prom?”
“Yes,” Billie repeats, dully. “But seeing as his records state that Mr. Novak has not met his soulmate at this time, that is hardly relevant.”
sons at the time and that didn’t stop him from taking the same risk. “So, what? This guy used to talk about the people he killed as pillow talk?”
By unspoken agreement, they didn’t bring the conversation up again.  Dean could tell that Sam wanted too, could tell that he had questions.  He wasn’t interested in hearing any of it though.  The closer it got to his deadline, the more convicted he was feeling.  He was going to do this, regardless of the consequences.  Even if Sam was being a little bitch about it.
Dean’s thoughts were foggy this morning and he was having trouble concentrating.  And he hated to admit it, but he was missing the simplicity of living with Cas right now.  He always woke rested, cooked healthy (whether he wanted to or not), and the air there was always peaceful.  He was disgusted with himself for missing that damn bird right now.  He was HOME, with his FAMILY!  This is what he’d wanted since the minute he’d left here.  And now… well, it was hard to wrap his mind around.
. He thought to himself.  He had a feeling he wasn’t going to get away from today without any tears, but he didn’t realize they were going to start so early.  He chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment before shrugging.
That shut Dean up pretty quickly. Was his freedom worth Sam's life? That answer was easy. An emphatic yes. And so what if this thing ate him later? If it cured Sam… if Sam could go on and live the life Dean always wanted for him. Dean would pay any price.
“Okay, well first of all, you sound like a lunatic.  Like straight from an institution lunatic.  Second, if this is for real, you need to call Bobby.  If there’s a giant bird out there promising miracle cures then it’s guaranteed that it’s no good.  I mean, Dean, come on!  Did you just happen to forget everything dad ever taught us?!”  Sam was agitated enough that he stood from his position on the couch.
“Alright!  You have a preference on what we watch?”  Dean asked as he turned and made his way back into the hallway and towards his room.
It was a system the boys had devised with Bobby after a few near misses with John. Doctors were reluctant to tell Sam or Dean exactly what was happening, likely to try and spare them any fears as young boys, but it had nearly killed Sam more than once.
Dean closed his eyes and looked back up at them with a frown.  “I’m not staying.”  His voice was a little stronger than before, though not by much.  “I can’t.  I promised I would go back.”
Cas turned his large head to face forward again, ignoring the heat that was searing him from where Dean’s hands came into contact with his skin.
Dean bit the inside of his cheek nervously.  They were finally getting to the point of this discussion.  John wasn’t likely to be physical with him right now, he seemed calm enough, but he could arguably do more damage by worming his way into Dean’s head.  Dean made an attempt to tune his father out by quoting movie lines to himself.
Electricity shot down his nerve endings and he threw himself down in an attempt to get away from the creature. The bird didn't press further though. After that first contact, it resettled its wing against its back and looked at him expectantly.
And now he was here, wherever that was.  Judging by the trees and complete lack of any sign of human life, he guessed he was in Cypress Provincial Park.  It was a fairly short drive from their house and Dean often came out here if he needed some time to himself.  The views were remarkable, when you could see them anyway.  It was dark as pitch out right now, which made sense since it was apparently… three in the morning.
Dean pulls his sleeves out of the way of his hands, tapping his fingers along the keys as he tries to come up with a third idea—when all of a sudden, the scanner next to the touchpad heats up, and he sees a faint red glow under the skin of his wrist.
Turns out ‘step on a crack and you’ll break your mother’s back’ comes from vengeful fairies that live in ‘between’ spaces like doorways and windows and, sometimes, the gaps in sidewalks. They don’t like people stomping on the veil between this world and theirs, so, at midnight, when the whole world lingers ‘between’ night and day, they sometimes go after the families of those they think wronged them. As if Dean needs more reasons to dislike those little fuckers.
“It’s not like you to ask questions you already know the answers to,” Dean grumbled for lack of anything else to say, crossing his arms over his chest.
The author could admit there was logic there, but it didn’t help much with the daze he was still in. “You want to go grocery shopping,” Castiel repeated.
how amazing you were with him. And piece by piece, I started to think that, even if I could do it alone, maybe I didn’t
“I have points I could make. I’m just concerned it will send you into even more of an existential crisis.”
He almost gets run into several times by groups gossiping as they walk down the hallway—and his phone is constantly buzzing as his friends share blurry pictures of the actor to the group chat. Castiel’s interning with Michael for the day—and even though the older doctor makes it clear he’s
“So, song or story tonight?” he asked as Ben finally got his toes free and Dean helped him slip under the covers. It was then that Lisa came in.
” I demand, but the memory is already playing. A memory of Dean and I looking at each other silently while Sam watches from Bobby’s kitchen window, suspicion creeping in.
been refilling your container of frou-frou shampoo with the cheap stuff anytime you tell me you need a new bottle—so I guess we’re even.”
“He’ll get over it,” Dean snorted. “It’s not like he doesn’t enjoy telling all my embarrassing stories every chance he gets.”
At some point, they had started moving down the long hallway from the lobby, past a series of decorated doors. One had an Elsa poster taped to it surrounded by paper snowflakes—another a bunch of emoji stickers. They stopped in front of the one labeled ‘Jack’ in letters all vaguely resembling animals.
“Castiel didn’t invite the killer in. He was already here, waiting for him,” Dean tells Benny once he rejoins the other agent.
Dean sneaks into the classroom the same as before—only he’s a little bit later than last time and Hot Guy is already seated.
Both Sam and Lisa asked him something, but he waved them off, hunching as much as possible to avoid being recognized by any of the restaurant’s other patrons as he walked through the main dining room and out the entrance doors.
He’s already in first place. He could bet nothing and win by default. Plus, he doesn’t like the look in his friends’ eyes—amused, but also implying he should be embarrassed to be ‘found out’. Except he isn't embarrassed that he knows a lot about Dean Winchester—just like he had never been ashamed of any of the things he knew in high school that his peers did not.
“Ah.” That… would make sense. Dean didn’t hate shopping (despite how much he grumbled about it) but there was something about the quality of the shirt that hinted it cost more than he’d be willing to spend on it. “In that case… thank you?”
Dean shifted some more—and for a while, everything was just quiet. Then, his voice sounded again, muffled against his pillow. “So, you gonna tell me how many freckles I have?”
“No, no, it’s not that. It’s--” Dean picks up the sound of people murmuring in the background and soft jazz playing. He changes sentences abruptly. “Where are you right now?”
“I think she wouldn’t see the point of lying,” Castiel clarified. “None of us could do anything with the information we were given. Most of the time, I don’t think she recognized we were people. We were—lab rats, as you said.”
“You know, I admire Sam’s bravery immensely,” Cas begins slowly, looking down at the hand Dean had removed and laid to rest on the bedspread next to his—about six inches of space between the two. “He is…one of the strongest and kindest humans that I think this world has ever known. But I think the reason that he is—well, everything he is—is because he is
For the next two hours, they go over the footage again and again, prioritizing vehicles. Cars that clearly had families in them or which only contained a female driver were unlikely suspects; however, they can’t get a clear view into everyone’s car—sometimes due to the angle, other times to window tinting. So far, none of the people the cars are registered to have a record or any known associations to the victims.
“You’re taking this whole process well. Better than I expected,” Cas says after a few minutes, already done with a pile of what looks like steak fries and starting on making a pile of curly as well. Maybe, Dean will change the spices on those—Cajun seasoning would be good, even if reminds him of Benny.
“Whatcha talking about?” the younger version of my brother scoffs from where he’s driving one-handed down the Wisconsin highway, his Other self a half-mile ahead of us having grudgingly taken Cas’s truck for the day. “Bobby loves us. We’re adorable.”
“Sure, Kiddo,” Dean says, lifting the bowl at the same time that Sam responds, “Absolutely not!” The two brothers frown at each other.
“And now, she and my cousin keep on pushing me to pursue mine. And it’s not that I think my soulmate’s
“It’s a big universe out there,” he murmured, thinking of the times he, as a teenager, had climbed onto his mother’s roof to do the exact same thing. “Of course it has some interesting stories to tell.”
The two of them were carrying plates over to the kitchen table to eat when an influx of text messages caught Castiel off-guard. “It’s probably Gabriel,” he told Lisa in apology, setting his food down and slipping his phone from his jeans pocket.
Dean paces the length of the room behind the redhead’s chair. “Well, what about gas stations? If he’s going back and forth from the city to his hidey-hole, he has to stop for fuel somewhere along the way at least some of the time.”
“You feel more comfortable with the idea of people getting to know you through you, rather than through what’s published by the press. I think that makes perfect sense.”
She’s hot—with dark, straight hair that falls to her collar bones and a leather crop top that zips up at the front, almost begging someone to drag it down with their teeth. “Whatcha boys in the mood for?” she asks with a smirk in her voice.
. He checks his phone and sees that it’s about 9 AM, which means he got six or so hours of sleep after drifting off mid-episode. He doesn’t even remember any nightmares so, yeah, he’s great.
Beside him, Dean was waiting for an answer, his forehead furrowing slightly in concern as the seconds ticked by.
The problem came around nine o’clock. Because he wasn’t going to skip out on tucking the kid in just because his mom wanted to tear him a new asshole.
“Sorry, sorry,” he whispers, attempting to roll off of him, but Cas only uses that opportunity to get on top instead.
Sam’s already had a really weird day—so when he stumbles into the kitchen to find Cas humming as he waits for the coffee machine to percolate, he’s can’t help but wonder if he’s still asleep. “Cas—” he starts, prompting the former angel to turn around with an almost obscene smile on his face.
"Combined with the black vest and red tie, Dean was 90% sure either Jess or Charlie had blackmailed him into a shopping trip." -  https://i.pinimg.com/236x/0e/6b/b8/0e6bb81e76fad872750eef6dab67ee8f--red-ties-gorgeous-men.jpg
signed the contract, confirming that she saw him do it. Of course, if this ever went to court, her testimony would
Dean stands, stewing outside the restaurant’s doors, persuading several people just by the look in his eyes to choose a different restaurant. He feels almost sick—skin too tight and tingly, his clothes (and bulletproof vest) almost unbearably hot. He unbuttons the top button of his collar, pushes his sleeves up—just waiting,
“—and so, apparently, some of the dentists are pushing for flavored latex gloves so that when they are inspecting people’s mouths, it tastes better—” Lisa was continuing, amused, when they both heard a rumble sounding from outside the kitchen. It was followed by the tilt of headlights streaming through the window.
“With a face like this?” Dean swirls his finger in the direction of his freckles. “Don’t gotta. You—on the other hand—”
Castiel was in the middle of describing a place called The Last Bookstore (built from of an old bank, the owners used books to create arches between pathways, as well as other forms of art) when Gabriel raised his hand up in protest. “How dumb do you think I am, Cassie?” he asked, his voice coming out slightly tinny from electronic feedback.
And yet, that hadn’t helped the slight drop in his stomach—that feeling of forgetting about a step and stumbling—over the simple word “dad.”
“I should at least be able to tell you when the switch happened,” Charlie continued apologetically. “Considering the SIM card would have been blank before that day. Just, um, pop it back in—”
“Uh, Hey there, Cas,” I stutter, trying not to startle at seeing the real angel in front of me, even as my eyes travel over his face without my permission. It’s the hollows around his eyes and the shape of his nose that I didn’t quite remember right, I decide, with something like guilt. I see Cas almost every day. I should know this.
Normally, he’s all for being quiet in the library. But Dean and Cas are saying plenty—just without words. Every few minutes, his brother glares at the angel until Cas feels eyes on him; then Dean abruptly goes back to flipping through centuries-old pages like he’s trying to tear them out of the spine. Meanwhile, Cas’s body language is even tenser than normal—standing versus sitting like the Winchesters—and enjoying his own turn glaring at Dean.
Pretty much as soon as she was conscious, Castiel—“Cas” as both Deans are calling him, so I might as well—laid his hands on either side of her head. And then his eyes lit up from behind like he was some kinda Jack-o-Lantern—and we suddenly knew exactly which house Sam was being kept in—by the British Men of Letters, apparently, in the worst case of being nosy neighbors I’d ever heard of. Sure, hunters could be more organized, but we didn’t need a goddamn homeowner’s association.
Dean raised both eyebrows. “Uh, pretty sure we’re past that, Buddy.” - Dean telling Cas, "We talked about this. Personal space?" in "The Third Man" (5x3)
person I ever met who truly follows that whole ‘Compete with yourself, not with others’ bullshit. I mean, it’s not bullshit—but who’s really above comparing themselves to the guy in the next stall over?
“So…” Sam begins again, his posture relaxing as he watches Dean’s do the same. “What would constitute a perfect day for you?”
“You sound a lot like a fortune cookie for someone who hasn’t ordered Chinese takeout since I’ve been here.” I should leave it at that, but I feel compelled to add, “Besides, I don’t
“I was just about to pick up an order for pizza,” Sam announces. When he sees Dean open his mouth, he cuts him off, “Yes, I got you a meat lovers. And cheese knots. And wings.”
At last, other Dean opens one of the ridiculously heavy steel doors—this one leading to the massive garage. My eyes skim, impressed, over several car-like shapes under dropcloths but then I see
Cas, in fact, doesn’t miss with the knives all night. And yet, he is new enough to guns that Dean is allowed to reposition his shoulder for him—to correct his stance by nudging one of Cas’s feet with his own—to fit his chest against Cas’s back to make sure he is breathing in time with the trigger release.
He found another one of the keys fitted to a slot in the wall, and when he opened up the tiny metal door, a green beam of light shot out, bouncing off a mirror a few feet away. Actually, now that he was looking, there were several mirrors around the room—most fixed in place—but two appeared to be on movable arms.
Bobby finds me in one of the storage rooms I was definitely told not to be in—but I figure that if my older self really meant that, he and Sam would have put in locks that were harder to pick. “What are you doing in here, boy? Ain’t you supposed to be getting a memory transplant right about now?”
Even though their trip to the store was by far the most eventful shopping excursion Cas had ever been on, he’d felt an almost-giddy rush afterward… the same kind of adrenaline spike he imagined teenagers got from sneaking out of the house under their parents’ noses or taking their first illicit sip of alcohol. Except, in Cas’s case, part of the thrill was knowing that he and Dean
—and he’s done that for himself. I—” With an effort, he made himself calm down, not because he cared if Naomi Novak hated him, but because he’d already disrupted Cas’s launch once today and he didn’t want to do it again.
“Why? What are people saying?” Ben piped up—and that, at least, seemed to make the adults in the room stop short.
Eventually, he’s joined by the tall drink of water that is his brother. He seems to finally have grown into his size—no longer trying to make his presence small from inside his body. Cassie decides she likes the long hair.
“Alcohol,” he observes, once he’s got a can in hand, sniffing it suspiciously even though all he gets is a whiff of metal. “Should you really be drinking this while on the road?”
“I think it’s a practical solution,” Cas responded slowly. “Gabriel is better off than I am, and, with this arrangement, I can stay somewhere more private, with better security. I will pay him rent but the lease will be under his name. That, and taking a few other precautions, might stop the press from even knowing I—or you—are there. And while you are at work and our other friends are busy, I will also have more company—should I decide that Gabriel’s not getting on my nerves too badly that day.”
“Brother, you came out twice. Once in that interview with Pamela. Then again when ya told the press about Castiel. Did you think that meant that you were done?”
“I’m still not sure what kind of creature it is,” the hunter sighed through the TV. “Based on a combination of bite and claw marks, it could be multiple monsters working together. In any case, I hope to report back soon.”
are going to talk to your best friends about the social media shitstorm—and if you guys think of something that I can do to help with that, you let know at dinner, okay?”
“Well, I’m going make myself some eggs, and it’s just as easy to make double portions, so let me know if you change your mind,” she said, setting her coffee down on the kitchen island.
I know I should stop him. If he remembers all this in the morning, he’s going to be embarrassed and that could very easily tip over into anger when we’ve just reconciled. But he’s rarely ever bright and free like this, not even when he’s drunk, and it makes it hard to worry about tomorrow’s problems.
An hour later, breathless and laughing, they hung up their armor—and Castiel realized that this is probably what being a little kid felt like.
Suddenly, the car door opens with a creak—and bodies are climbing inside. Samandriel gets shoved into the backseat first, and then Dean and Hannah are opening both front doors simultaneously. “
. So, yeah, I have faith that he’ll do it all again no matter what you change.” He drinks the rest of his water before opening up a cabinet under the sink—and what do you know? There’s recycling.
And while Castiel couldn’t even begin to comprehend what that was referring to, he was more than happy to let Gabriel ramble for the rest of the call.
She sighed, the fingers of her left hand drumming a pattern on her opposite arm. “Thank whatever God you believe in, plus The Beatles, that this isn’t live,” she muttered.
On the other end of the line, Gabe seemed to know that his message had sunk in. “Now,” he segued, tone abruptly shifting with his smile, “Why don’t you fill me in, for real? From the top. Preferably while tap dancing.”
“You seem better,” Cas observes, because of course, he noticed and, of course, he had to say it out loud. And yet, for the angel, it isn’t just about stating the obvious when he points out the color of the sky or that someone made coffee—it’s his way of expressing pleasure for the little things that most people scarcely notice.
“He’s been told that he’s the one who is supposed to win the war for his side, but he thinks that just because he has the power to do so doesn’t mean he has the
“Today, I’m mostly glad to be hanging out with you,” Dean gave him the side-eye. “And that’s part of what’s messing me up. I
Dean’s actually thought about this one a lot—on long, silent drives with Sam, hundreds of miles away from where Cas was staying in a mental hospital. Out in the woods of Purgatory, where every distraction could possibly get you killed by a Leviathan. In hotel rooms where he imagined he saw Cas’s face outside the room. “You went behind our backs, yeah. But that didn’t mean you didn’t
“Cas…! Cas…!” Dean called out, the syllables clipped off as he gripped tighter to the author’s sides. “Mnnhhh… You’re… Either more wriggling or less wriggling, Man. It’s your choice—but—uh—the way this is going is—we’re gonna get somewhere—so—
He looked at the photo—at the beautiful, curving wings of his phoenix—and realized that, as messed up as it was, the person he most wanted to talk to about this was Dean.
He wasn’t anti-soulmate. Clearly. He was happy for Charlie and Dorothy, right? And he was glad when Benny found Andrea a few years after their… thing… in New Orleans. Yeah, okay, it kinda sucked when his ex-girlfriend, Cassie, threw away the good thing they had going just because she met “the one,” but he’d gotten over that—
There was definitely a smile hiding somewhere on Cas’s face. “See? You’re very creative. I have no doubt you would be more than up to the challenge of defending yourself in any verbal confrontation.”
Cas seems to consider carefully. “Dean and I both value free will highly,” and Dean wants to glare at him for taking an obvious one, though to be honest, he hadn’t thought of it yet. “We both tend to act emotionally to problems--” Dean raises his eyebrows at that one. “And to make unilateral decisions that we should discuss with others first.”
Dean doesn’t want that either—and once again, the thought refuses to stay in his head, but comes naturally to his lips. “I—need a breather, yes—but I promise I’m not bailing. Just give me a few minutes of human time, OK?” Dean requests.
“Besides….” Castiel began, but then paused, thought through what he had planned to say, and shook his head, “Never mind.”
Castiel slid over the milk and the plate of lemon slices, both of which could combat the effects of capsaicin. “These should help,” he promised, then reached calmly for his own food.
Mick clears his throat. He reaches into his pants pocket, seemingly ignoring the way the rest of us reset our fingers on our triggers or adjust the grip of our blades.
He opens his eyes and—I’m taken aback. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him look like this. His walls are down. If an angel wanted to possess him right now, they might not even need a verbal ‘yes’ to do so and it’s clear—to some extent—that that is what he is doing—inviting me in, inviting me to
—at connecting with people. But I’m starting to think that’s it’s not all intentional. That her criticisms and censure might be her way of… reaching out, so to speak. I mean, I’m not the most socially adept either. And overcoming that… takes practice.
Less than 12 hours ago, I was ready to gank the son of a bitch and I wasn’t even gonna to give him the chance to convince me otherwise. If John Winchester had been transported to 2016, he would
He nodded in thanks, knowing she was trying to be nice. He just wished that so much of what society called “niceness” wasn’t one step away from lying.
“You didn’t explain. But I knew. Sorta. I knew that however much crazy was rolling around in your brain at the time that you weren’t trying to hurt us. I mean, Man, you were
“I think you already know anything I haven’t said yet. And you’ll tell me when you’re ready to hear it,” Cas explains, leaning slightly into his touch.
He wanted to look at the painting that was this man until it made him feel something other than “it’s beautiful.” But he also
Even when he had tried alcohol at Gabriel’s request, its pull was over for him the next day. Given his track record, he assumed that addiction would just never be one of his vices.
“I admit, I didn’t always have the most generous thoughts in regards to Sam. I never hated him or despised him—but I did think he that he was…damaged goods, I guess is the best way to describe it. It’s what all angels were told to think. To some extent, they also thought the same about you, Dean—but I…I knew better. I knew
To be honest, it’s not his kind of movie either—but underneath his hard hunter exterior is a little brother who still hasn’t forgotten that Dean put toothpaste in his Oreos when he was twelve—so he’ll take any opportunity he can to make him squirm.
They have a glass solar-powered bee that you can stick in your garden and it will light up and rotate at night that he thinks Cas might like, but it’s still not
Dean wrenches himself away from that thought, his heart elevated in panic, purposefully ignoring the way he’s gone slightly hard. He feels like he might throw up.
There's obviously vampire/werewolf/hunter mentions in this chapter. However, they're not very accurate to canon—a stake wouldn't kill vampires in Supernatural, obviously—but considering the world these characters live in, I felt I had to go with the more well-known stereotypes.
“Nice to see you, too, Gabe,” Sam responded with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. “Slept well, I hope?”
Cas only got a brief impression of light grey walls and fluttery white curtains because he was too taken up by the sight of Dean moving over to the wrought-iron bed. Sitting on the edge with his feet on the ground, the actor bounced on the mattress a few times as if checking its quality, which only served to emphasize his bowlegs. “Ah, memory foam,” he sighed, leaning back and proceeding to make a snow angel across the bedspread. “Come on, feel it. You know you want to,” he teased.
Castiel had never particularly wondered if his strength was enough to crush a cellphone, but if he wasn’t careful, he was about to find out. “There was no need to stoop to these kinds of tactics. The book was doing fine on its own.”
of her. They were like—like a piston and a crankshaft. Two separate parts of an engine—that moved differently, had different tasks—but were both working toward the same goal.
Sitting down on the floor, Benjamin rubs his hands together eagerly, probably anticipating one of his come-from-behind victories.
“You don’t have to apologize,” Cas answers back, gravel-gargled voice even thicker than usual. “I just wanted us to be awake for this.”
Cas huffs, “I know I said I didn’t care about word choice, but I might have to remind you of that particular sentence in the future.” His voice isn’t upset, though, meaning he’s teasing.
“The room is more than adequate,” Castiel admonished. “That was never the issue. I just don’t want to impose…”
way to figure out who accessed my phone? Or how much they got off of it?” he hoped out loud, even if that hope was likely in vain.
floor, feeling almost celestially tall as he watched the oblivious people shuffling on the sidewalk below.
So, as annoyed as Cas is at his friend for exposing something he’d hoped to keep secret for a few days longer (and for unnecessarily brushing a nipple in the process), being newly-engaged means that the sight of it also makes him indescribably happy.
“Well, now that I’m aware that it upsets your delicate sensibilities—” A smack. “I was kidding that time! For real.”
“Alright, alright,” Charlie muttered, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. Castiel’s nerves jittered in time with her rapid clicking of the keys. “This is what we got,” the tech genius announced—throwing a pie chart up on all their screens. That, at least, seemed to get Dean and Gabriel to blink.
“Around… somewhere. I’m sure you’ll find him,” the agent answered dismissively like Dean was a fly on the wall he was trying to shoo away.
that this is the way he and Cas are around each other and the confusion on his face would almost be funny if his expression wasn’t darkening by the minute.
This...was a very difficult chapter to write and I probably went through three or four versions before I landed on this.
“Hey, Little Bro,” Gabriel murmurs, in a surprisingly calm tone of voice, drawing Cas’s gaze to him.
An hour later, Benny was saying goodbye to Lisa. The two of them had bonded some over sports talk and, even if the teams’ and players’ names meant almost nothing to Castiel, he did have quite a collection of random sports facts memorized (“Did you know golf is the only sport to have been played on the moon?”). He figured Benny’s and Lisa’s responses to these tidbits were mostly polite, but at least Dean had been biting back a smile, so all-in-all, the end of the evening was, at least, more pleasant than the start of it.
“Gross,” Sam declared at the expression on Cas’s face, wrinkling his nose the exact same way that Ben, the other boy that Dean raised, had done not too long ago.
After a few weeks, Sam decides that life AD (After Destiel) is pretty similar to life BC (Before Casdean). Dean throws his arm around Cas’s shoulder on movie nights—and Cas seems to get a lot more innuendos all of a sudden—but thankfully, the bunker walls are super thick so whatever happens in their bedroom
Castiel, who knew the average spray radius that came from flushing, could admit that that sounded unpleasant, but “I’m serious, Dean.”
Apparently, some amount of brotherly telepathy still worked though, as Sam whipped his puppy dog eyes out for the second time that day. “I’m glad I caught you. I really wanted to apologize for—”
is about an inch long—a series of lines and swirls that wouldn’t hold meaning to most people—and, in a dim part of his brain, he’s surprised that the killer knew it relates to angels at all.
And yet, when he pictures Cas, it is still messed-up dark hair and blue eyes that come to mind…and, you know…other things—like perpetual stubble and strong shoulders… He shifts on the bed slightly, causing the frame to squeak because it’s not his memory foam. He feels weird, how clearly he can see every detail of Cas in his head, while studiously not turning to look at the angel for reference. And he can’t help but wonder if it would be better or worse if the angel suddenly went out one day and picked a different form? Which makes no sense, because Dean doesn’t care what he looks like. At all.
“Thought you might need that. You got some bullshit right… here,” Dean explained, pointing at the corner of his mouth as if telling Cas where to wipe.
Amusement glinted in Dean’s eyes, like sunspots off a rearview mirror. “I’m pretty sure that’s exactly what someone who could blow shit up with their mind would say.” But then he glanced back toward the building next to them and sighed, “Look. I’d love to hang out, but I have to be interrogated in a few minutes,” Dean explained—and it was one of the things that Cas found most confusing about shooting a movie. The scene Dean was talking about—actually the one that Dean auditioned with—occurred at the start of the film but they had had to shoot all of the action sequences from the end first because they required more effects work. “Want to watch me get put in handcuffs?” the actor asked, bouncing his eyebrows playfully.
Crowley gave a short laugh. “Even in the—near impossible—event that I overlooked something, need I remind you that I have one
“You’re kidding, right? That’s freaky, too. I get that Heaven is apparently upside-down Hell, but I don’t know if I wanna find out what happened to make an angel fall like that.”
Bobby finishes up the last of Cas’s name with a flourish he would deny having and, for a second, the paint glows white-blue like grace. It’s a moment that feels nice and boring and domestic.
Sam had seen that when Cas died the last time. Had seen it in the alternative future Chuck had tortured him with. And as for the former Angel of the Lord, he’d proven time and time again that there was nothing in Heaven or on Earth that he would choose over Dean. If you could ignore all the times that they almost killed each other or got mad enough they stopped talking for months, it was kinda sweet.
“Whatever,” Dean huffed, leaning back against his seat again. “I’ll get over it. I just don’t need to do a magazine shoot right now when half the reason they’re trying to give me the title in the first place is that they think being bisexual is hot.”
But if this was her way of calling a cease-fire, he’d take it. Especially considering how exhaustion was settling heavy into his bones. He might even get eight hours of sleep tonight.
“And while I appreciate that sentiment, I still want something more solid than that. I want to know where your erogenous zones are—your inner wrist? The small of your back? The shell or the lobe of the ear? Do you like a light or a firm touch when you’re being stroked? Do you make noise when you really like something, or should I be paying attention to something subtler than that—the way your breathing changes or your toes curl?” His voice turned a little more pointed. “Also, I’d really like to know whose penis is going to be in whose anus, at least for the first time around.”
crap about disappearing,” Dean remarks around a mouthful of burger, giving the angel sitting next to him a slight nudge with his elbow.
Even with a good portion of his brain cells not working, Cas wasn’t going to let that comment go by without retaliation. And so, he dropped his weight onto Dean—the actor’s bowlegs parting slightly to better accommodate him automatically.
Sam sighs, wondering for the millionth time why he even bothers trying to talk to Dean when he catches sight of the book that his brother was talking about. It’s one of Chuck’s. One of the ones that Sam marked—and that sets off all kinds of alarm bells.
Meanwhile, Meg is just watching him closely. “Now, now, I have faith in the little tree topper. In fact, anyone want to bet me next week’s scut that he knows what it is?” she asks the room, referring to the hours of filing, faxing, and badgering insurance companies that new doctors had to do every day before an attending would even
Their favorite day to work is on Thursdays. Thursdays are especially quiet, and as much as Castiel enjoys the people watching they do every other day of the week, they like the quiet, too.
Dean was back at the stove and calling over his shoulder, “I’ll have your breakfast ready next, angel.”
An hour and a half later, Cas felt even more ridiculous, covered from head to toe in flour, cowboy hat included.
Castiel glances down at where they attached them to their shirt. They were a gift from Gabriel when they came out. One of them is the asexual flag in the shape of a heart that’s pinned right over their own. The other is striped yellow, white, purple, and black and reads
“There they are now! Why, Steve, Wyatt, I didn’t expect to see you here!” the second woman said. “We were just talking about you two!”
Dean leaned into him, head finding a spot to rest itself on Cas’ shoulder, as though he’d done it a thousand times. “You’re ridiculous,” he said.
The gods of fanfiction must have been smiling down upon them. Sam had barely taken a sip of his beer when there was a woman approaching them.
They were both excited— Jack was hardly able to stand still, and Dean just barely refraining from opening the closet.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says. “Bee fact and coffee for your favorite customer? Two Bumblebee Iced Mochas and an iced honey macchiato for Charlie.”
“Honey bees don’t sleep. They actually spend their nights motionless. That’s how they conserve energy for the following day,” Castiel informs him.
“Crowley doesn’t allow pets,” Castiel reminds her. They don’t add that they’re fine; they don’t mind that they come home every day to an empty apartment. Not too much, at least.
Castiel barely keeps themself from staring at their joined hands. They’re slotted together with such ease. Like they’re meant to fit together. Dean’s hand is warm in their own, and all Castiel can think is that
Sam and Cas followed her out of the bunker and to her scuffed up car. She hopped into the driver’s seat, calling over her shoulder, “You get shotgun, Cas. Sam gets to suffer in the backseat.”
Sam shushed her, straining his ears. He could vaguely hear Dean and Cas talking, nothing but the buzz of voices, and—
Castiel can’t wipe the smile off their face. It’s still there several hours later when Kevin comes in for his red eye.
Sam shifted uncomfortably from where he stood next to her. “This isn’t very inconspicuous,” he said, raising a hand to adjust the wig Charlie had forced him to wear.
Cas seemed just as confused as Sam was. He stared after where Dean had disappeared down the hall for a few moments, then glanced at Charlie, and then finally at Sam.
Cas glanced up from the tome he was squinting at. “Hello, Sam.” He looked back down at the book. “I’m afraid that this translation is slow going. This dialect of Enochian was from before my creation, used only amongst those closest to God. I know very little of it. It’s… frustrating, to say the least.”
“Awesome! Thanks!” Charlie said. “Personally, I’m a fan of anything with a lot of whipped cream. And chocolate. What do you and Sam want? What does Dean like?”
“I’m your friend, aren’t I, Clarence? Can we rename black coffee to ‘Shit In a Glass?’” Meg looks up from the table she’s wiping down to flutter her eyelashes imploringly at them.
and Castiel likes him. As a friend. Plus some. Dean doesn’t like them. No way. They don’t want to make things awkward between them.
“But seriously, Cas,” Gabriel says after a minute. “Meg has pictures of the two of you staring at each other. It’s pretty obvious that he likes you.”
“He’s— I knew he wouldn’t like it. He was the only person who didn’t know,” he says, hands closing tightly around the mug. “You know. Guys walk down the street holding hands and he makes a comment about how unnecessary that is. Before Sam got away to Stanford, Dad would tell him that he should cut his hair or people would think he was gay.” He laughs, but there’s no humor in it. “Dunno why I did it. We were talking and he asked if I’d gone on any dates, if I had a girl yet. The usual shit. Told him no, ‘cause I haven’t. Haven’t looked at girls in awhile, ‘cause there’s this… this person I like…. Anyway, I kinda just decided
They don’t have time to give it more than a few moments’ thought before Dean appears, red-faced and flustered.
“How about I owe you a favor instead?” Charlie suggested. “Not even the government can afford my computer skills.”
They try not to think about that too much. They accepted a long time ago that Michael, Luke, Hael, and their mother will never accept them. The sting of it has dulled over time, but it’s still there. Castiel knows what Dean is going through. They wish they could do more.
He has a thing for westerns and dresses up as a cowboy for Halloween every year, age be damned. He drives a ‘67 Chevy Impala that he refers to as his baby and loves almost as much as his little brother. When he was little, he wanted to be a firefighter, but his mom loved music, so he opened his shop for her. He had his first beer at sixteen with his dad, and even though he thinks it’s crappy, he drinks an El Sol every time he sees him. He calls everyone dude regardless of gender (but he’s been trying not to do it to Castiel ever since he learned it makes them uncomfortable and that makes them unreasonably happy). The handful of times he’s stayed to drink his coffee, he likes to draw on the napkins, and he’s a good artist.
“I already have a drink,” Cas said obliviously, glancing between her and the half full glass in front of him.
Dean was standing outside the coffee shop Cas had been about to walk into. He held a cardboard tray of coffees in one hand, and the keys to the Impala in the other.
Castiel’s treacherous brain reminds them of Winchester Records. They very pointedly ignore it. They don’t have anything to offer Dean except for coffee and themself. Right now, they’re his friend, and Castiel thinks that might be enough for them. At least, they’re trying to convince themself of it. Being more, though? They shake their head. Wishful thinking. It’s all just wishful thinking.
They came back to the bunker a while later, Charlie with her flannel and Cas with a bulging bag in each hand.
“I think they’re just oblivious,” Sam said. Or— “Maybe they haven’t figured out that they like each other like that.”
“I can help carry the coffee,” Cas offered. He reached out and grabbed the tray from Dean. “The Impala doesn’t have anywhere to put it, and you don’t have anyone to hold it to keep it from spilling.”
Castiel is well aware that that’s a pickup line, but they don’t acknowledge it. “Yes. I opened this shop, actually.”
It very well could be. Despite all his exposure to it, Cas was still a little lost when it came to humanity. And Dean could be completely oblivious at times. Was that all it was?
“If they’re idiots here, and they’re idiots in every fanfiction to ever exist, then we can get them together like in fanfiction!” Charlie’s eyes were wide.
Charlie elbowed him. “Shut up. We can talk about trope-ing me and her tomorrow. Tonight, we’re celebrating.”
“I opened my own place, too, actually,” Dean continues, oblivious. “Not a coffee shop, but still a business. Winchester Records.”
“No, I know where it is,” Cas said. “It’s in my bedroom. Charlie and Sam suggested I try using clothing to ‘express myself.’ Do you like it?”
“What’s your sibling’s name?” Castiel asks. They pass Dean back his change and muffin, then grab a to-go cup and start on his drink.
“Of course it is,” Rowena said smugly. “Lovely working with you, Samuel. Call anytime.” She winked, then added, “You as well, Charlene. Invite me to the wedding!”
“Brothers, plural, and a sister. Michael is the oldest, then Luke, Gabriel, myself, Alfie, and Hael.”
On any given day, Jack was a bundle of energy. He was almost constantly brimming with excitement, pulling whoever was nearby off for some escapade or another. Hence why Cas wasn’t surprised when he woke up to a small body jostling the bed and small hands shaking his shoulder.
thank you again to everyone who’s left comments or kudos! I’m absolutely horrible about responding, but you guys make me smile :)
“Just glad you’re here,” Dean says, and the admission makes him blush a little. “But, uh— would you— listen?”
Castiel has all of ten seconds to take it in before a door in the back of the shop opens and Charlie catches sight of them.
“You said you weren’t going to use your magic on anyone without reason,” Cas said, squinting at her.
“Make sure it’s a room with a camera. Maybe in Dean’s bedroom,” Crowley said, thoroughly amused, before disappearing.
Castiel doesn’t think about it; they greet Dean with their usual, warm, “Hello, Dean.” The slightest bit of tension seems to drain from his shoulders, but by no means does he seem completely comfortable here like he usually does.
Charlie brightened. “Great! Sam, why don’t you give them the details, and then we’ll get going. No time to waste!”
“Yes, albeit annoying. I had to live with him for a few months after….” They trail off. “Anyway, there is no good reason to be woken up at three in the morning by someone screaming the lyrics to ‘Let It Go.’”
“C’mon, you’ve gotta give us something besides fine,” Charlie insisted. “Romantically satisfying? Relaxing? Enlightening? Gay?”
“Their molecules arrange more pleasantly than other foods,” Cas said matter-of-factly, snatching another.
“Oh. Gabriel just became an ordained minister, which I’m sure will end in disaster.” Another thing to come out of his discovery that Castiel was considering watching Star Wars. Gabriel claims it’s one of his life’s ambitions, but they suspect otherwise.
“So, Cas! How are things? What have you been up to? Has Dean finally forced you to watch Star Wars yet?” Charlie asked enthusiastically.
Any snarky remark Dean was about to make back was lost as he watched Cas awkwardly climb into the backseat. He swallowed before opening the driver’s door almost mechanically.
They think about Michael’s ice-cold stare and Luke’s contempt and Hael’s disgust. The condescending remarks their parents make and how everyone but Gabriel and Alfie agrees. How Alfie still says
like you. You’re cute and smart and super dorky and your eyes are really fucking blue and, uh. I, uh. I know you’re kinda my best friend, but… I was wondering if maybe— maybeyou’dwanttogoonadatewithme?”
“Yup,” Dean said. He leaned over and pressed a kiss to the top of Cas’ head before pulling back to stand up.
It’s quick and chaste enough that by the time Dean realizes what’s happening Castiel is already pulling away, but his grin widens nonetheless.
Charlie turned to Cas. “Well, Cas, what do you say? You want Winchester Elder or Winchester Taller?”
Dean very quickly has become one of their best friends, too, despite the fact that they only ever see each other for a few minutes at a time.
It doesn’t take talking twice with Dean to develop a crush, but by their sixth or seventh conversation, Castiel is definitely crushing.
“Sure you are.” Charlie waved him off, turning her attention to Dean. “Your fairy godmother is really pulling out all the stops.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You’re a lesbian, Charlie. You’ve got no idea if he’s dreamy or not. And he’s—“
Castiel looks up and squints at him. Before they can open their mouth to say anything, Dean is talking again.
Dean grins innocently. “Don’t know what you’re talking about, Charlie,” he says, turning back to Castiel. “I’d like a caramel latte, a Bumblebee Iced Mocha, and a favor, then.”
After Dean had fished his phone out of his nightstand and crowded the three of them together for the picture, Cas moved to pull the hat off.
Their eyes meet and they hold each other’s gazes for a moment before Charlie interrupts cheerfully, “There’s a line, handmaiden, and I’ve got work to do. You two can have eye sex later.”
“Probably,” Sam said, shuddering as he thought about having to live with this UST for the rest of his life.
Dean practically shoves the sleeve into their hands. “Here,” he says. “This one’s got one of my favorite songs on it. Zepp is a good place to start.”
“You’re not gay either,” Sam pointed out. “Anyway, I don’t think that the ghost would be able to tell if we were faking.”
“I sincerely doubt that will be the case, but if it does happen, you are more than welcome to do so.”
Learning that Dean isn’t straight shouldn’t make Castiel this happy. It really shouldn’t. (It does.)
Twice a week, Dean shows up, visibly brightening when he sees them. Dean coming in is another reason to add to why Castiel likes Thursdays.
Looking between the two of them, there’s no doubt in Castiel’s mind that they’ll make them answer the question. They don’t even bother to defend the fact that the ewoks were their favorite.
printed in pink, purple, and blue. Like Meg, he takes note of the flag in the window right away and grins.
Looking at the large collection of shelved records, it’s clear that they’re not sorted by genre or artist. Instead, there are handwritten labels taped onto each shelf. One reads
Dean laughs and takes a bite of the muffin. “Sammy did that to me once, but with that one song from— holy shit, Cas, this is amazing.”
“It’s a shortened version of my name,” they say without missing a beat. “Lemon or blueberry muffin?”
“They’re lovely people. They moved in right next to Shelby and Grant, you know, and Shelby swears she’s never met a man more charming than that Wyatt Smith. I’m inclined to agree. Steve is a bit awkward, but he’s really sweet, too. They’re so lucky to have each other,” the second woman said.
Sam met Charlie’s eyes and cleared his throat to cover a laugh. “So. Uh, when are we getting you guys dates?”
“The only thing we can do.” Charlie opened her laptop and tore the seal off the Oreos grimly. “We keep looking for tropes.”
At first, they’re pleasantly surprised. And then Castiel sees the tense set to Dean’s shoulders and his heavy walk. He gets in line for Castiel’s register, now mostly obscured by a cluster of college students that are waiting behind the patron Castiel is making a honey cappuccino for.
Dean grins proudly. “Yup. The thing is, I’d just stock all good music. But we do exchanges— you bring in something you don’t want and get a discount on something you buy— so we get all this crap.” He waves his hand towards the
“Yes. They’re fascinating, and incredibly important to the environment,” Castiel says. “They’ve been here for about thirty million years. There are roughly twenty thousand different species.”
Castiel fixes him with a serious look. “‘Those fuckers’ are incredibly important to the environment,” they say.
“When Not Moose and his angel finally do the do, I want the sex tape,” Crowley said, as though that was a perfectly reasonable thing to ask for. “It would be invaluable.”
“Oh, no,” he says. “No way that you’re gonna listen to that. The good music is over here.” Then, he grabs Castiel’s hand and leads them over to
Unbeknownst to Sam, Charlie, or the legions of hellers outside their room, Dean and Cas were very much canon. Canon when Dean fell asleep to Cas’ fingers running through his hair. Canon when they shared stolen kisses in the Impala, on hunts, in town. When Cas stole Dean’s fries and Dean grumbled at him.
Castiel shrugs. “It was a few years ago. They didn’t like it when I told them I was into men, and were… even less thrilled when I told them I was non-binary. It doesn’t hurt as much anymore. But when it did, I had Gabriel. I had Meg. It doesn’t magically fix things, but you have people, too, Dean.”
“Plus,” Meg adds, “I want to be invited to your wedding, and you two aren’t gonna get married if all you do is stare at each other.”
“What else are we supposed to do?” Sam said. Short of nearly killing one of them (as though that didn’t happen enough), he was out of ideas.
“Sammy. He’s a pain in the ass sometimes, but he’s great.” His tone softens from joking into something proud. “Just a couple of years younger than me, off in college. He’s studying to be a lawyer.”
They’re also a bit confused— they don’t quite understand that reference, but they can assume that Charlie is suggesting that Dean is uncoordinated. He isn’t. At least, not that they’ve seen.
Cas gave Dean one of his just-there smiles. “I drove myself. My car is parked down the street. I can’t leave it. But if Charlie sends us on another coffee run, I would gladly ride with you,” he said sincerely.
It wasn’t a long drive to Donnie’s; less than fifteen minutes later, the four of them were sitting at the bar, drinks in hand.
“Yes. Charlie sent me as well,” Cas said. He squinted in confusion. “Why would she send both of us?”
“I am,” Dean agrees, “but don’t tell him I said that. Besides you and Charlie, he’s my best friend.”
someone save dean. someone save sam. someone save charlie, even. they’re all suffering, except for cas, who’s just here for the ride.
Sam wanted to slam his head against a wall. Those two idiots. How could they have that much UST and not do anything about it?
Castiel hadn’t actually thought this far ahead. They’d been curious about where Dean works since he said he’d opened the place on his own. They had also wanted to see Dean. But they can’t just say that, can they?
Dean was white knuckling his beer when he elbowed Cas and hissed in his ear, “She’s flirting with you, dude.”
“She’s a menace,” he says. “But she also does the books, so I can’t complain. Too much.” Dean starts moving towards the door. “See ya, Cas!”
“Online dating?” Charlie suggested half heartedly. “Get them to match with each other? I could hack those sites in my sleep.”
Charlie grinned. “Hell yeah, he does.” Her smile faded slightly. “But if it’s not that he’s in the closet, then what’s keeping him from making a move?”
Charlie waved him off. “Nothing.” She raised her voice and directed her next words to Sam. “You can uncover your ears, Sam!”
“I see that,” Cas said, moving towards the coffee, but not before giving Jack a small smile and saying, “Happy Birthday.” He was in the midst of pouring himself a mug when two arms wrapped around his waist.
since he was going to find out at some point anyway. He gave me this look, and then said—“ Dean breaks off.
“What?” Charlie demands while Dean crows triumphantly. “I love Han as much as the next person, but really?
Cas sighed. He recognized it from a case years ago, where Dean had claimed it would help them “blend in with the locals.” Despite his reasoning, Cas still had a strong suspicion that that hadn’t been the real reason Dean had convinced him to dress up.
“Not unless you want to cry,” Sam muttered. He was having flashbacks of a late night on ao3, milkshakes, romance, heartbreak, and tears.
“Yup!” Charlie said. “Anyway, you’ve gotta wingman for Cas. Who knows, maybe he’ll find the Siobhan to his Kristen.”
“I’ll take one of those, then,” the man decides. He pulls a worn leather wallet from his pocket then looks at Castiel, eyes flickering down to their name tag. “Both of them to go. How much, Casteel?”
The moment she had turned her back to them, Dean was snatching Cas’ hand up for himself, rubbing the digits furiously with his thumb.
“What do you mean? He’s your unicorn!” Meg insists. “Don’t think I don’t see the way you just—“ She gestures vaguely “—light up when he walks in. I sure as hell haven’t missed the way he looks at you. Write your number on his cup or something equally cheesy.”
Dean opened his mouth to retort, but she was already refocusing her attention towards Cas, an incantation rolling off her tongue.
The woman frowned. “Maybe another time, then,” she said, before slipping a pen from her pocket and grabbing Cas’ hand. She scrawled something onto it. “Call me if you’re ever up for it.”
It was all incredibly domestic and Cas could hardly believe it. There they were, him, Dean, and Jack, celebrating a birthday. Sam, Eileen, Garth, Bess, Jody, Donna, and the girls were all set to come over in a few short hours. A year ago, they had been, yet again, trying to prevent an apocalypse, but now…
“No, you couldn’t,” the first woman agreed. “But with those two… they’re something else. Don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone more in love.”
They were close enough that Charlie didn’t really need to make conversation during the drive by launching into a description of her dream girlfriend for the night then abruptly asking, “What about you, Cas? We all know Dean likes dark hair, layers, and a sexy voice. What’s your type?” but she did anyway, looking far too amused.
“Actually, Charlie wants to leave now,” Charlie said, poking her head into the library. “Ready to go, guys?”
“Oh, well,” she said suggestively, turning to Dean, “maybe your friend could come along. I have a large bed.”
told her.” Dean turns his pleased gaze from the pie to Castiel. “Alright. Gimme my bee fact, pie, and coffee.”
June first, Castiel hangs a pride flag in one of the shop’s front windows. It makes the place seem brighter, though it obstructs some of the sunlight.
Cas shot Sam a slightly panicked look. “It was… interesting,” he said slowly. “Very creative. I liked R2-D2 a lot. I wasn’t aware that Dean was… as you say, ‘crushing on Han Solo.’”
He looks surprised, but pleased. “Yeah. Took a hell of a lot of work to get it off the ground, so I can appreciate the dedication you’re putting into here.”
“No. I have heard that it’s a ‘staple American food,’ though,” Cas said. “Wyatt has yet to explain that in a way that makes sense.”
His eyes are dull and rimmed with red. He’s a mess. Something is very obviously wrong. When he puts down a few bills on the counter, his hands shake.
There’s something about Dean, though, that sets him apart. And Castiel isn’t quite sure what that is.
“Why don’t you take a break, then?” Sam suggested. “Charlie and I were going to head out to pick some stuff up. You could come with, get some fresh air.”
Jack’s grin widened. “Yeah!” Then, he started shaking Cas’ shoulder again with renewed importance. “C’mon, Daddy! Dad’s gonna make
“Goodbye, Dean.” Castiel smiles back as they watch Dean hurry towards Charlie. They hear him excitedly telling her, “Guess what? They said yes! Cas said yes!”
“Yeah,” Dean said. There was a satisfied shine to his eyes. “But first… birthday pancakes!” He set the plate on the table with a flourish.
Charlie squealed. “How did you like it? Who’s your favorite character? Are you crushing on Han as much as Dean?”
Sam waited, listening to her fingers flying across the keyboard. For a moment, he let himself imagine it. A normal, sexual tension free existence. Not having to see his brother and friend making eyes at each other constantly.
Busy Bee Coffee is picking up more business. They’re still not mainstream, but word of mouth has brought them several new regulars, and even Thursdays, quiet as they had been before, are slowly but surely gaining more patrons. They’re still quiet enough, though, that Castiel still gets to talk with Dean.
They’ve only ever talked, only ever seen each other here, at their coffee shop. They haven’t even known each other for that long. It’s only been about two months.
“What Charlie means,” Sam said diplomatically, “is that you’ve worn the same thing since we met you. You don’t ever think about trying something different?”
It takes time before Dean is back to normal. Or at least, as back to normal as he can be. He comes to the coffee shop more often, now. Four to five times a week. They don’t get to talk for as long as Castiel would like everyday, but Castiel can tell that Dean is… accepting it, it seems. Dealing.
Eventually, he conceded, “I do think that Han Solo is ‘Dean’s Type,’ but I don’t think he would marry him.”
They were waiting outside. As soon as Sam had pulled over, Dean was shooing him out of the driver’s seat.
“Actually,” Dean said, piling a stack of pancakes onto a plate, “I have one present that you can open before everyone shows up.”
Castiel rolls their eyes fondly. “I’m not gay, Meg, but thank you. And no, Crowley still doesn’t allow pets.”
Cas turned his head to squint at her. “Is there a problem with my clothes?” He looked down at himself a little self consciously.
I come bearing a god-awful gay pasta joke today. apologies in advance. sorry folks, I have a terrible sense of humor and you all have to bear with me.
“Now, now,” the shorter man chided. “I’m sure my mother was a lovely woman.” He tipped his head, “—who just so happened to ding-dong-ditch a baby on her ex’s doorstep.”
“I just did what I had to do,” he mutters, trying to shrug off the attention—and feeling relieved that Sam isn’t here. Both because his brother shouldn’t have to listen to this conversation and because he doesn’t think they would have talked this honestly about it—truth spell or not—with him around.
Holding his phone out as far as he could, he tried to take a picture of his own chest. However, he’d never used the camera setting before and winded up with one of his door instead. Switching it to “selfie” mode helped immensely. He zoomed in on the photo to get a closer look.
Cas could almost see the scales tipping back and forth in Dean’s eyes—and the moment that the actor chose to believe him. “Very pleasant, huh?” he said, with a sideways smile. “You sound like you’re giving a Yelp review. How many stars do I get?”
“Dean, I really have to go or my client’s going to wonder why I’ve been gone so long,” Sam continues. “But we should catch up sometime soon. Maybe have lunch here at the Swedish Crown. I think you’d like it.” Well, that would come off as an obvious lie to anyone who knows him, so Dean hopes Brady is nowhere within hearing distance.
” He is looking at neither of them in particular, but his voice seems targeted at Dean specifically, with the emphasis of someone who has had to repeat themselves a lot. “You both tend to live in the past a lot—wondering if there is stuff you could have done differently. And it makes sense with the kinds of lives we live that any mistakes we make end up a lot bigger than other people’s—but that doesn’t mean that we’re any less entitled to make those mistakes. We’re only human—yes, Cas, you just as much as the rest of us.
is the loosening in his chest. Castiel’s approach seems to be working. Dean is relaxing—and Castiel is able to settle into the bed a little more easily.
Gabriel?” Castiel demanded, finally conceding to call his cousin after his phone buzzed so many times that it vibrated off his desk.
“Mr. Novak,” the head of the delivery people stepped in then, an invoice in his hand. “We’ll be going now.”
She turns back to me, fists tight with accusation. “You didn’t go to Heaven….You…You ran away to live with
“You’ve seen your father choose a path that led him away from his soulmate. So did my mother. We’re not—following a script.”
Strange as the encounter was, Castiel couldn’t help but feel weirdly proud of Dean afterward—not only because of the obvious happiness he’d brought to several people just with his presence but also because he handled it all with much less cockiness than Cas had expected.
For the next few minutes, Lisa recounted some funny stories Matt had told her about his job. Apparently, he owned a dental practice and people had quite a lot to say under the effects of laughing gas. So, Castiel tried his best to give her his full attention. Because she actually
first try. “And you can tell him I said so,” Dean added while Ben gave a flush-faced grin that helped Dean to not think about things for just a little bit longer.
that. But not only would it involve breaking his lease, but he’d likely have the same problems wherever he went next unless he were to shell out for a place with much higher security. And that—just wasn’t in the budget right now.
“What do you think Billie’s going to say?” Cas asked when his eyes adjusted to the light enough that he could follow Dean across the way to the keycard-activated glass door.
Dean’s fingers twitch against his jeans leg, instinctively trying to curl into fists. He’s going to say “no homo” and slam the door in Sam’s face—and then probably avoid Cas for weeks while hitting up every strip club in the Tri-State area—because that’s how his brother acts when he’s on the defensive.
“You could at least pretend to go to the bathroom first before bailing!” she calls after him. He just flips the bird in response.
“I probably would be considered infamous among the angels,” Cas elaborates, sadly. “But that was never something I wanted. Plus, the angels that are more well-known to humans, like Michael and Gabriel, tend to get prayed to a lot more, which must be very distracting.”
it—standing there, watching, while Naomi’s goons cut into her friends and stitched them back up again. Or worse,
” she told him firmly. “We don’t have time for that. We’re already behind schedule with absolutely nothing that can be edited together for tomorrow’s release.”
“And if I was in your position, I probably would have done the same thing,” Sam told him, suddenly serious. He ran his fingers through his hair. “It’s actually something I thought about,” Sam acknowledged. “Before I met Jess. What I’d do if I found my soulmate and they were dating someone else. When I was with Ruby—I wondered what I’d do if I bumped into my match by accident. I mean, it’s hard not to think of things like that, while you’re waiting.”
In the end, he ropes Dean into going shopping too, correctly predicting that Cas was going to be overwhelmed by the options at their preferred big box store. The two brothers follow him as he wanders aimlessly up and down the aisles, feeling fabrics rather than seeing them. Sam considers pulling some plaid—before remembering the times Cas has made fun of Dean for looking like a “lumberjack” and realizing he should probably be insulted by that.
Castiel squints at him, tilting his head slightly so that he can see him better against the bright, sterile light haloing his light brown hair. “I think it would be physically impossible for Jesus to do that to himself.”
“Fine,” she huffed, blowing red bangs out of her face. “But don’t think I won’t get it out of you later, Novak.” Ironic, considering what she’d just interrupted. “Now, seriously, LARPing…?” she asked.
cake.” Mick nodded vaguely, obviously having lost interest, before he retreated to the back of the bar.
Impatient with himself, he grabbed Dean by the hand to drag him back onto the bed, pressing kisses to the actor’s chest and his neck and his face until he could speak. “I love you, Dean Winchester,” Cas said at last, as clearly as possible. “More than words can describe.”
Dean leaves the coffees on Benny’s desk and, without a word to each other, they grab their jackets and head out the door, already feeling the pressure of running against the clock.
She rolls her eyes, but not before he sees the fondness there. "Whatever. Are we done with this heart-to-heart now?"
“And Dean?” His brother reluctantly pulls his gaze from the angel, tight-jawed. “Don’t get sauce on the books.”
was straight. After all, there was such a thing as platonic soulmates, and considering his own lack of sex drive, it made sense.
“Guess someone’s home,” Lisa announced, turning to put both of their now-empty plates in the sink—and despite everything Castiel had just been thinking and worrying about, he couldn’t help but feel the warmth and the excitement of that purr in his gut.
And yet, if he thought he was going to get a reprieve when Dean started to do his scene, he was very much mistaken. As soon as Dean dropped his hand, he took his chair and spun it sideways. This way, when he sat down, he stared straight at Castiel with those incredibly green eyes. “
“This is the same cousin you mentioned before?” Dean asked, seriously. Castiel nodded. “Pass on a message for me,” Dean said, before flipping the bird. The driver next to them, apparently thinking the gesture was meant for him, honked his horn and flipped one back.
“Oh,” he thinks, brow furrowing, and she prepares to hear how they rescued him from a den of werewolves or maybe stopped him from being sacrificed in some weird ritual. “I guess the most succinct answer would be that I am a Nephilim—part angel, part human. Dean and Castiel are my fathers.”
Dean thought, looking at a woman who must be Naomi Novak. It was weird—he’d never seen a picture of her, but it didn’t even cross his mind that she could be anyone else. The way she looked at Cas—obvious judgment in her eyes—well, that just screamed
“So, there’s—uh—a lot of soulmate talk going on in there,” Dean pointed out since he assumed it was the reason that they were both out here.
“I mean, there were some pretty strict instructions on what kinds of clothes he can wear when promoting Cas’s book. No black, no suits, nothing Italian.
“Yeah, they do. And don’t let Charlie hear you talk like that. She’d kick your ass for thinking they wouldn’t drive five hours for this.” Dean’s posture changed slightly so he was standing a bit taller. “Any, uh, word from your mom?”
the possibility of more out there for him, he doesn’t think it can be much more than what he has right now. And he’s not willing to bet the precious few poker chips in his possession trying to sweeten his own pot.
“Family…yes, understood,” Mick nods and, in the awkward silence that follows, offers to show himself out.
“Yeah, OK,” Dean breathed in what Castiel thought might be relief. “I’m serious. It wasn’t like a test or anything—but….”
Unfortunately—but also not—Dean didn’t give him much time to admire the view before he was dragging Cas’s hand away and replacing it with his body instead, muffling a groan into the bolt of his jaw.
“Guess we know who’s at the top of Castiel’s freebie list then,” Meg says, finally pulling out a chair to sit on and stealing the lollipop directly from Gabe’s mouth, teeth biting off the top of Dean’s head.
time, Dean’s mouth was open—and Cas could taste the salt from the popcorn they’d shared—and wondered what Dean was tasting as the actor’s tongue invaded his mouth, curling wet against the roof of it. And yes,
Dean cleared his throat, sending vibrations through Cas’s own chest and causing the hardness in his pants to brush against Cas’s. The author closed his eyes automatically. “Right… Yeah. Just… give me a minute.”
Eventually, Dean has to start looking up jokes on his phone. “Why can’t you explain puns to kleptomaniacs?”
Dean doesn’t think so. Everything about this guy screams that he likes to be in control. He didn’t even like other people being
Castiel instantly thought of the disgusted expression Charlie made when saying “TMI, Dude,” and wholeheartedly agreed.
She turned to Lisa and winked. “Don’t worry, I know he’s taken,” she said in a loud whisper. Lisa waved off her concerns with a smile and, with that, they started the scene.
By the time they’ve gone through all of their bullets and the army of werewolves, zombies, and vampires is thoroughly annihilated, they’re smiling and laughing together in a way that feels like the happy buzz of neon outside of a well-loved bar.
“It’s okay, Sam,” Castiel interrupts since it seems Dean’s younger brother is still trying to make him feel better. “I know that Dean…” How did Sam put it? “…acts like more of a jackass than he is.”
He shook his head and disrobed smoothly.  At least this clay mansion was a comfortable temperature, the floor beneath his feet was almost warm to the touch.  He settled himself into the basin of the tub and leaned gently against the back.  It was a strange shape, not especially ergonomic, but it was deep and Dean was thrilled to realize that he was going to be able to almost completely submerge himself.
Dean frowned at himself and pressed a hand against his chest.  His heart rate had picked up and the hair on the back of his neck prickled.   Something was definitely not right, but what?  Dean tilted his head to the side and listened carefully.  It took about half a second before his brain caught up with what his senses were screaming at him.
“Oomph!”  Dean felt the air in his lungs leave him in a rush as he rolled to the side and away from the ghost.  “Lady, chill!”  Dean shouted as he swung an iron bar towards her to protect himself.
Dean’s eyes had finally adjusted to the low light in the kitchen and he could just make out his brothers forms across from him.  He wanted to hit the stupid son of a bitch for that comment, but he refrained.  Dean was not a stranger to self-loathing, he recognized Sam’s comment for what it was.
Dean nodded even though Cas couldn’t see him.  At least Cas had thought to warn him and not just, pop up out of nowhere.
Dean laughed at the two of them squabbling and shook his head happily.  Damn he had missed the old codger’s grouchy sense of humor.  He had missed all of this actually, the small kitchen, the petty arguments, the laughter, the sights, the smells.  There was a smell to home that he’d noticed yesterday, something that couldn’t be replicated, but that was immediately recognizable.  He inhaled deeply and smiled contentedly.  There was just a certain feeling about being home, something that was impossible to really describe.  It filled his heart and his soul with a warmth and a peacefulness that couldn’t be matched anywhere else.
“That stupid son of a bitch!”  Dean shouted to the empty halls of the clay mansion.  When Cas had said he leaving on “business” and seriously, the fuck kind of business did a bird have?  Dean hadn’t realized that he’d meant that very second.  He was annoyed.  So, no, he didn’t LOVE the bird, but they’d become friends in a Stockholm Syndrome kind of way.  He was odd and intense, but he was also kind and gentle and very easy to rile up.  Dean was surprised to realize that he enjoyed his company more than he’d thought he would.
Dean swiped away a tear from his cheek with a knuckle and swallowed against a suddenly dry throat.  He was going to be okay.  Castiel had kept his word, Sam was going to be okay.  Dean ran a gentle hand through his brother’s ridiculously long hair.
“I- uh, I love you, little brother.”  Dean said quietly.  He knew they weren’t much for melodrama, but he wanted to get the words out just in case.
Dean felt a pain in his chest at the thought.  A pain that he tried to never allow himself to feel.  It was always there, a constant companion to him, but it was background noise to him now because he’d gotten so used to pretending it wasn’t there.  He had to be the rock, he had to be strong for Sam, he couldn’t allow himself the luxury of terror.  But… it was getting harder to ignore it.  The ache was settling deeper within him, radiating outward further and further with each passing year.  Your years are winding down… Sam was dying.  Right here, right now before his very eyes.  No, no, he couldn’t have a panic attack right now.  He needed to take care of Sam.  He needed to be here and to focus, listen to Pam, make sure Sam was comfortable, make sure Bobby was okay.  He was ok, he was fine, he could do this.  But, he could feel hysteria creeping up the back of his skull and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to hold this off for much longer.  Sometimes, these kinds of things demanded to be felt, and even Dean wasn’t strong enough to ignore them forever.
A powerful gust of wind kicked the soft powdered snow up around their feet into small cyclones.  A dark shadow fell across the sun and all four men turned their eyes upwards.  A gigantic silhouette nearly blotted out the whole of the sky above them.  Dean squinted against the stinging wind in his eyes and admired the way Cas’s powerful body moved towards them.  It had been impressive the first time he’d seen the guy take flight, though it had felt like a fever dream and a nightmare at the time.  He was able to truly appreciate the majesty in front of him now.  Though his awe WAS tempered by his concern over his families’ reactions.
Finally, they entered the largest room they’d come across so far.  Set against the wall were two giant ovens.  They were primitive in a way, built into the house instead of being added later like most appliances.  Some well worn benches and tables littered the room and Dean noticed a set of large and shiny knives atop one of them.
“Good.  Now, you need to do a little recon here, Dean.  Figure out what this thing is, what it really wants!  Supernatural creatures don’t give out favors for free and I seriously doubt that this thing healed your brother and the only thing it wanted in return was your… presence.  Think about it!  It could be after Bobby, or me!”
A clatter down the hall drew his attention.  He was on guard immediately, but it only took a moment for him to recognize the sound.  “Cas!”  Dean called in excitement.  The bird's talons clicked against the floor, though the pattern sounded a little different than he remembered.  He hurried down the hall, eager to see his companion.  A turn here, a twist there, a sloping hallway and then he was there, standing in front of Castiel’s large feathered form.
Dean sat against a fallen tree trunk before looking shrewdly at the bird, Castiel apparently, before him. After a few brief words, Dean had reluctantly agreed to step further into the forest with the creature. He could still see the Impala from where he was sitting and Castiel had allowed him to keep his knife, not that it would help, so while he felt like a fucking idiot for doing this he didn't feel like a total fucking idiot.
“Alright, Dean, I need to hear everything!”  John said with a grin.  “I’ve been all across the damn country looking for you!”
“That’s bullshit.”  Dean snapped at him and turned his back.  He busied himself fiddling with the dishes in the sink and Castiel watched as his shoulders crept closer to his ears.  He was angry but there wasn’t much he could say to ease his tension.
“Then what the hell are we gonna do? Film the worst remake of the Odd Couple ever conceived?” Dean said incredulously.
He drug himself from the bed and tromped lazily down the stairs and to the kitchen.  He was in his boxers and a t-shirt but fuck it, this was his home.  It was dark in the house and he yawned widely as he entered the small kitchen.  He stepped toward the coffee pot only to realize that the red light on the top was already on, which meant someone had beat him to it.
After a time, Dean noticed that their forward motion had slowed.  He cracked his eyes again to see if he could make out anything about their surroundings.  He blinked rapidly in confusion.  Well, not only had their forward motion slowed, it had stopped altogether.  They were now standing outside a large… house?  Mansion?  Fucking mountain?  Dean had absolutely no idea what to make of the giant structure before him.
Dean nodded to himself.  That was just as well, he doubted he could handle Sam’s tears right now anyway.  He clapped his brother on the shoulder lightly a few times.  It wasn’t much of a goodbye, but it was the Winchester version of one.
He stepped around Castiel and further into the room, inspecting each item he came across.  It looked to be a fully functional kitchen, the only thing it was missing was a refrigerator.  Guess they wouldn’t be keeping leftovers here.  Everything looked a little weathered but well cared for and he ran a hand across one of the large tables.
“It’s school stuff, honest.  I’m just… talking to a classmate about what I missed.”  Sam was still red and Dean picked up what Sam wasn’t saying.
Dean made quick work of repacking his duffel.  He really hadn’t brought that much with him, he didn’t really have a lot to bring to begin with.  He took a quick shower and brushed his teeth.  The good thing about all of this was that he knew what he was going back too.  There were no nerves and no concerns about the amenities at his secondary residence.  That made the thought of leaving a little easier.  Not a lot, but a little.
He turned awkwardly and met the eyes of his father.  John was only an inch or so taller than him, but for some reason he always seemed to stand like a giant.  Dean eyed the man warily.  He’d been so good about steering clear of his father the last week and a half but now it seemed like he’d backed himself into a corner.  Hopefully, Cas wouldn’t find out.
He didn’t wait to see Bobby’s response before his feet were moving forward again.  He found the nearest stairwell and all but threw himself down the steps.  He needed to be outside.  He just needed to get some fucking air!  His feet tripped over themselves and he almost tumbled down the last flight of stairs.  He probably scared the shit out of the people and staff on the bottom floor as he all but sprinted out of the doors and towards the parking lot.
Dean frowned and looked back up at his jailor.  Cas was staring at him with an earnest expression on his face and it was an odd thing to see on the feathered features he’d gotten used to.  Normally, Cas looked completely passive, unruffled and unbothered by everything around him.  He seemed genuinely concerned for Dean at the moment though.  Dean sucked on his teeth thoughtfully before setting his fork down on his plate and squaring his shoulders.
Castiel smiled inwardly and felt a quickening in his heart rate.  True, he was going somewhere dangerous, Dean didn’t know that though.  But it was nice to know that he wanted Castiel to be safe.  They’d grown much closer in a short amount of time and Castiel cherished every moment of it.
Dean looked up in irritation.  “Ok, I know this sounds crazy, just give me a damn minute.”  He snapped at the two men.  Both looked at him with pursed lips and raised eyebrows and he rolled his eyes in response.
They all threw arms across their eyes as small bits of grit and chat from the yard were kicked up by the air generated by Cas’s immense wings.  The sound of them flapping was like being buffeted by a thunderstorm and Dean had a brief thought that maybe Sam’s suggestion of Cas being a Thunderbird wasn’t as far off as he’d imagined.
And with that, Cas’s large wing wrapped around him swiftly.  The last thing he saw were Sam and Bobby’s sad expressions before his vision was obscured by large feathers.  Cas swept swiftly into that strange dark space that he used to travel.  Dean could feel the change in the air around them as they moved.  His bag and the box in his arms seemed weightless in this place and he was thankful for that at least.  He pressed his face against the warm feathers of Cas’s breast as they floated through time and space.  Dean could feel warm tears as they burned tracks down his frozen cheeks.
He glanced up with a frown at the creature before him. Confusion muddled his features and he forgot that he was supposed to be angry. “What-what ARE you?” He asked with a note of awe in his voice.
Castiel had absolutely no opinion on the matter, he was just happy to be included.  He clicked his beak at Dean in agreement and watched as the man pulled his laptop out from under the bed.  He had a box that was attached to it, though he wasn’t sure what it’s purpose was.  Dean settled himself on his bed, in the spot that Castiel slept, though Dean didn’t know that.
Castiel’s head turned to the other side to contemplate him silently.  Finally, his strange voice sounded throughout the room.
“Dean…”  Sam’s voice was low and furious.  “Are you telling me you’ve been, been living in the lap of luxury for six fucking months!  Going on hunts and watching movies!  You never once tried to contact us to tell us you were okay!  We’ve been worried si-”
“Are you coming back again?”  Sam asked.  The tone of his voice matched the sickly boy Dean had left behind more than the man who was in front of him now.
The taller man turns back to Castiel. “Look, Cas—you want out of here, right?” he asks the question innocently, almost eagerly. “That’s what we—me and Dean and our friends—do. We stage prison breaks—help Specials with families get back to them if they want to, give them a place to stay if they don’t.”
Too soon, Dean pulled back, giving him a curious once-over, “You okay? You really did look like you had something on your mind when I came over here.”
It creaks open. The first thing I notice is the completely black suits both men wear. The next is that, even if they are dressed alike, that don’t seem to have come
Before Castiel can give more than a rumble of protest, Meg’s hand has dipped inside his scrubs and pulled out the long chain he’d had pressed to his skin. On the end is a ring. Black onyx makes up the top and bottom, separated by a band of blue resin (“I was trying to find something that matched your eyes—but they’re a different kind of blue all the damn time. This… I guess it’s pretty close to how they look in the morning. You know when the sun makes the room all glowy and you’re grumbling for coffee and shit,” Dean had said as he stumbled over his not-a-chick-flick moment.)
“Cas, I’ve died a bunch of times—and none of them were your fault. All that proves is that deep down, you couldn’t kill the real me even if you tried. So, tell me, what else? Or…” Dean bends down to pick up the crystal, carefully using the ties of his robe to keep it from touching his skin. He hands it me. “Show me. Whatever it is that you think will send me running for the hills.”
“Should go apologize to him?” Castiel suggested with a raised eyebrow as he sipped his orange juice. “Yes, I think you should.”
“Oh! People who ask if you want the good news or the bad news first. The fuckers should just say what they mean to begin with. Bad parkers. Jehovah’s witnesses. Girl Scouts, especially when they’re peddling their cardboard cookies. People who crack their knuckles—”
“It’s actually a recorded phenomenon in soulmate pairs who are under extreme duress,” one of the eavesdropping EMTs mention. “It’s similar to when a twin senses that their sibling is in danger or hurting.”
“—I’ve been paying more attention to the way you are around each other. And it just seems like… you guys live side by side, but not… together.
The moment hangs there for a moment, peaceful in a way their life so rarely is—so, of course, Dean has to interrupt it. “I thought we were here to see The Fast & The Furious. Not whatever chick flick you’ve apparently got playing in your head.”
In the end, even Dean doesn’t really get in on the action. Benny (the traitor) called Bobby on the way to the restaurant to inform him of the situation. The Director then promptly ordered that Benny was to go in alone since Brady wouldn’t recognize him and, therefore, would be less likely to react dangerously to him showing up.
Sam listens attentively—but he’s always been a multi-tasker, so he also can’t help but notice that every time Dean moves to make a point with his hands, Cas’s body shifts slightly in response. When Cas moves, Dean does the same. Meaning that some part of them is
“Mmmm, not sure. Maybe if you and your twin are interested in some double trouble, we can work something out.”
“Then I’ll pick you up,” Dean decided. “Five then?” He must have been able to tell that Castiel was about to argue, but he beat him to the punch. “Dude, no offense, but I really don’t want you taking an Uber to my house.”
He wondered if Dean felt it, too, and if that was the reason his arm came around him more hesitantly than usual. “Tonight was okay, right?” the actor asked at last, whispering in a way that came naturally at night. “Nothing major went down while I was in the basement?”
Dean leaned forward, pressing his head into Castiel’s stomach. “You someone who hates cowboy movies, you sure love riding on your high horse, cowboy.”
Dean snorts to himself. He thought it was a coincidence before—when Benny mentioned Castiel’s name. Guess he knows better now; his parents probably named him after his soulmark as a baby. He wonders if he tends to have good luck on Thursdays too.
“Slightly,” Hannah responded, her eyes on the smart tablet she was writing on with a stylus. Castiel watched, fascinated, as she dodged the other people in the hallway without looking up.
“But…” Dean struggles to put any words to the uneasiness inside him, wishing he had some way of just thrusting the whole tangled, vomit-inducing thing at Cas and saying ‘here!’. “When we’re at diners and I hit on waitresses, you don’t seem…you know…bothered or anything.”
what a sock on the door means?” he asks, scrubbing the back of his neck while carefully cataloging all his friend's facial expressions.
And it must have worked, because when he came to, it was to a hand on his shoulder, shaking him awake. “Sammy?” he asked automatically, the hand far too large to be Lisa’s.
So far, I’d had twelve hours to get used to the idea. Admittedly, most of it had been spent sleeping. Then, I lost ten minutes of my life arguing that there was
“Anyway… that’s what we were doing at the courthouse,” the actor concluded with a somewhat proud set to his jaw. “I was adopting my kid.”
“Uh… Lisa likes a bunch of Tex-Mex stuff. So, I’m doing some breakfast quesadillas, burritos, that kind of thing…”
Inside are two scraps of fabric in plastic bags. The piece of nightgown is obviously older. While he can tell it used to be white with faint blue dots, it is now almost rust-brown, looking like someone had trampled it into the dust.
try to warn Pamela that she couldn’t look at his true self without her eyes burning. You remember, he resisted coming forward? But since when has any hunter—or psychic hunter assist—taken “no” for an answer when we think we can get a peek behind the curtain?”
“When I’m annoyed at you, I feel annoyed with almost everything around me. But when you’re happy—singing in Baby at the top of your lungs and, for once, not thinking about the weight of the world on your shoulders—I feel like maybe God hasn’t abandoned the world quite as much as I thought. When you invite me to movie night and insist I eat popcorn I can’t taste, I feel grateful that you’ve chosen me to be your friend. And when you fall asleep without nightmares, I feel peaceful. I have many feelings for you.”
Castiel’s feelings were still shouting from inside his chest, but they didn’t overwhelm the quiet fondness that came with those words. “You’re a good person, Gabriel,” he murmured softly.
Dean feels it again—an anxiety and tension he didn’t feel a second ago. But once again, Cas smiles at him, like he’s just made his day and the sudden tight knot in his stomach loosens slightly. “Thank you, Dean. I’ve been around since the beginning of existence and while I spent a lot of it fairly content, I can’t say much of it was happy.
This time, it was clear she was giving him no choice but to follow her—out of Ben’s room, down the hall, and into their bedroom, where normally, the sight of his memory foam mattress made him happy.
Castiel couldn’t help but feel defensive anyway. “There aren't many good reasons why he wasn’t around, Dean. It hardly seems worth it to put time and effort into something that is likely to only upset me.”
, which Castiel distantly recognized as his head connecting with the door behind him. He had so many
“Gabriel!” Cas interrupted, hopefully not loudly enough to be heard outside. “We’re not characters in Casa Erotica. Dean just came to help me relax.”
“But…” Dean cautioned, his stomach clenching and unclenching slightly. “Don’t think you’re getting out of this without spilling a few secrets of your own.”
“Unfortunately, that was his last communique,” the staffer said once the tape ended. His voice was so unbelievably solemn-sounding that it caused Dean to snort again.
Dean swallowed heavily, maneuvering himself even closer as he worked to get the shorts completely off Cas’s legs—Cas’s cock sliding obscenely along his cheek in the process—and then Cas was standing there, completely unclothed, feeling Dean’s eyes like hands on every part of him.
“Well, it is past midnight,” Sam agrees with a yawn. “And I think we’ve done all the prep we can. Mind if I take the first shower?” He asks, getting up from his creaky wooden chair with a stretch.
—all of the lowercase a’s written slightly like 2’s—when a label caught his eye. “This one,” he decided easily, popping it into the player before Dean had a chance to see what it was.
mean—” God, he hates feeling like this. Self-consciousness. But mostly, exhausted. The way a wrung-out towel feels. “Look, today has been a lot for me. I have no clue what I’m saying or what we’re doing right now.”
