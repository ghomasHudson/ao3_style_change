It was a good feeling, one Dean hadn’t had in a long while. Heavy but not in a bad way. He wasn’t sure what changed it from every other time he’d eaten something and become aware of its weight within him, but he wasn’t going to push and wind up making himself sick. Not today. He had a full wallet, a tank of gas and a nice view of Castiel licking his fork clean, a little speck of whipped cream stuck to the corner of his lips.
Dean chances a hamburger without onions when they stop four hours later for dinner and to let the dog pee behind the restaurant’s dumpster. The manager gives her a funny look but nothing is said. Dean is tired of all the bland healthy food he’s been forced to eat for the past two months and even if he the tomato gives him heartburn bad enough to send him to his knees, he wants a burger goddammit.
His body reacted on instinct, either from fear or remembered trauma he didn’t know, but the hiccups returned, painful hard shocks from his middle that squeezed his stomach and made acid burn up the back of his throat. Castiel’s eyes were wide now, terrified and he was practically thrashing. Alastair was pressing his head down into the dirt—harder and harder and harder—
“Yes. There’s a difference between Obsession and Possession. You’ve encountered Possession before. Demonic Obsession is harder to spot… It’s where a demon marks a person, marks a soul. Most people confuse it with schizophrenia, OCD, or a number of other mental illnesses because of the symptoms… Other times, the demon can give the person abilities… Like Azazel did to you.”
He gathered his discarded clothing and left without a word. Rocked forward into solidity at the driver’s door of his truck.
Ellen nodded, worked her tongue against the backs of her teeth; “It’d take a lot to make me hate you, Dean Winchester. A lot more than even Hell can throw at you.”
There are two small beds in the room. Dean looks at them and feels the muscles in his back tightening up like someone’s plugged a torque wrench into his spine.
It’s small, a little twitch of the corner of his mouth and Dean—for half a moment—doesn’t see Castiel the angel standing there before him in a threadbare OZZY t-shirt and backward sweats, he sees his Cas, all mussed hair and small crooked grins. Flashing denim blue eyes and mischievous intent. His heart swells in his chest and steals his breath because this is REAL. This is right in front of him and that void of memories in his head surges up—so close but still unattainable.
With a sigh she tucked her son into a nest of blankets at her hip, took the gun in one hand, and Sputnik’s collar in the other. “Hey,” She said, her voice shaking; “Don’t let this thing get you.”
They have to stop twice to let the dog Go and Dean vows never—NEVER to let her have greasy human food again.
“Get a grip,” He muttered and smacked himself on the cheeks a few times, “It’s just a frickin’ support group!” His stomach turned. Support group, how pathetic was that? Boy, if Dad could see him now—
Cas stares at him, eyes dilated and bloodshot, lips kiss bruised and cheeks flushed. He looks so utterly human and debauched and broken down Dean wants to wrap him up in his arms and not let him go.
Castiel nodded. “The ingredients are crushed together to create a paint that is used to outline the seal intended to hold the demon in place,” He narrowed his eyes, “Are you alright?”
Castiel nodded. It was a tiny thing, barely perceptible. Dean only felt it because the prickly hairs on the angel’s jaw scratched audibly against the pillow. “Dean?”
Dean feels a weird knot growing in his chest, a constriction of his lungs that is more physical than anything he’s felt all day.
Ellen seems to have no compunctions against stripping out of her sweats and yanking her jeans back on without even shooing Bobby out of the room. He does, however, have the decency to leave anyway and stand in the hall while he tries to regain Dean’s attention on the phone.
Dean doesn’t know whether to take it as her being funny or a slip of the tongue, so he doesn’t reply to it directly. Says he’ll be there in a few hours to pick her up.
He pushes Sam back with a nod, “Dizzy… Just dizzy,” Bows his head between his knees and breathes deeply.
The screen changed and the kid was under the knife, the guy with the gun holding some brunette young doctor woman hostage on the other side of the operating room glass while some scruffy doctor in the OR pointed into the kid’s cracked chest.
Cas sitting in the driver’s seat of his truck, door open left leg out and dangling above the ground. The engine is still slowly ticking, cooling, so he must have only arrived moments earlier. His clothes are rumpled, shoes untied. His hair is dirty and his cheeks are covered in dark hairs— His mouth looks strangely pale. Dean looks at him, trains all his focus on him, not the bone and blood and the satisfaction on Bobby’s bearded face.
Sam stared at her in shock—But in a blink he was back on that Beige chair and Jo was tumbling across his lap, groaning as she quickly chewed and swallowed.
HE looks down at the knife, blinks— and locks eyes with Dean as he pulls it free. Drops it to the floor as if it were a toothpick and Dean looks up at Bobby because THIS—oh dear SHIT! THIS is unexpected.
Even the wall of crumpled blankets Dean had constructed between them hadn’t been enough to allow him true rest, even if he did fall asleep. Sleep just happened. Rest had to be achieved and he didn’t know if he could manage it with Castiel so close.
“Hey!” Dean said, spying Bill in the rear view mirror; “There’d better not be cheese on that. She’s lactose intolerant.”
The worst thing about winter, Sam’s realized, is that digging up graves when the ground is frozen harder than concrete is a long, tiring affair. Weirdly, he doesn’t think Ghosts should be allowed to wreak havoc on small town folks in the middle of winter. It’s damned near impossible to salt and burn the bastards when it takes you four hours to dig down the twenty inches past the frost line.
Sometimes when Bobby was working intently Dean could—could FEEL a buzz of activity coming off of him. Or when Jo was reading or watching TV, or when Ellen was particularly irritated or worried there was this pressure. Dean had never felt it coming from Sam. Of course, he hadn’t been around Sam much in the past few weeks, not since he’d begun to notice it.
The doctors had been impressed with how ‘well’ he’d seemed to take it. But inside, inside Sam felt numb, cold and hot by turns. Like it wasn’t really happening, a hyper realistic dream he would have to fight to wake up from. He’d wake up emotionally wrecked. Choking down sobs and praying nobody heard him, or that the oxygen pump didn’t alarm and wake someone up.
Ruby is pissed, she’s all teeth and arched eyebrows; “Great, just peachy. Impeccable timing, guys. Really.”
“You’re Skully, I’m Mulder, got it?” Dean motioned between them while he connected Sputnik’s lead. “You gotta act like you care about these people or we’re in deep, OK?”
Dean winced at the ceiling; “He kind of had us on a ‘need to know’ basis with the things he collected. Unless I had to deal with it, I never asked.”
Ian is in the men’s room with his hands on the lip of the sink sobbing and Dean stands by the door with his hands up, tries to be placating but he’s not as good at it as he thinks he is and seems to only make it worse. “Hey—hey, seriously! It’s OK! It’s just one little mistake, no big deal, everybody makes mistakes!”
Dean rubbed a hand over his head; “Hey, you need some new bait, Jo? Because you’re fishing at the wrong end of the pool,” He pushed past her into the room and spoke carefully, but loudly enough to get the older man’s attention. “Mister Stanley?”
The Xuphrek stared up at him uncertainly for a moment, blinked and—And where the hair had touched its skin the Xuphrek began to change. Slowly, but then with growing speed until its body wouldn’t fit into the bucket anymore and it drew itself out.
Dean nods, what else can he do? This— this thing, whatever it is, breezed through their traps and talismans like nothing and dropped Bobby with two fingers—with a fucking tap to the forehead! Mosquitos don’t even go down that easy.
“Maybe it’s something in the cat food, or some disease. Like rabies or something. I dunno. And all those people up in Maine! Christ… Did you hear about that one?”
It is not easy to haul yourself into your car with a wheelchair. He’d done it before, but he didn’t like it, kind of wanted to see if he could find a van to convert like Chad had done. One he didn’t have to get out of his chair to drive. This dragging himself across the front seat of the Prius was bullshit, especially when he then had to drag the wheelchair in and hope the footrests didn’t get in the way of the door shutting.
Castiel looks at him, actually seems to LOOK at him instead of through him. After a moment he turns away again, looks down where his fingers are laced easily together; “Why did you do it?”
Dean swallows, waits for the angel to continue and when he doesn’t he gives his head a shake; “What do you mean? Here for her, like ‘here for her’?”
Dean’s hands go up because he can feel the fury burning into the back of his head, knows that look without even seeing it. He’s made it often enough to know when he’s pissed off. Knows enough about himself to recognize when struggling will just get you hurt.
There weren’t many potential cases in West Virginia. Too many hunters in the mountain state, and they weren’t the type to share. Dean remembered Bobby talking once about a case he and Rufus had gone on years ago in New Martinsville. That they’d been in town only two hours before being ran off by the local hunters.
Sam makes a face, like Dean’s just slapped him in the mouth with a severed, erect donkey penis and slaps a hand over his eyes; “Great, now that’s seared in my brain…” He lets out a breath.
Ellen blinked and pursed her lips in thought; “What kind of weird are we talking about? Like, awkward morning after weird, or ‘I’m an emotionally constipated jackass’ kind of weird.”
Dean dipped his fingers under the cuffs of his sweatshirt and ground his teeth. He seemed to be keeping bloody scratches on his wrists and the insides of his thighs, sore stinging places that bled if he picked at the scabs. Physical, solidifying… comforting.
The yellow light is on above the elevator and Dean stares at it, presses an ear to the door and listens to the sounds echoing up the shaft. Sputnik squirms in his arms and he puts her down, wraps the lead around his fist and— There’s a horrible noise in the elevator shaft a hard deep LURCH of screaming metal and vibrating cable. It makes Dean very nervous and he fumbles for his phone, holds down the call button and hisses into the microphone; “Hey, you OK?”
It’s the second toss into the wall that does it, Dean’s sure. His head can only take so much rattling anymore before it starts rattling back. The world dissolves into pain and swirling colors. The ghost is gray and brown and electric blue and swallows up everything, he’s reaching forward hand curled and hungry toward Dean’s chest—
But then her fingers pulled at the blanket, letting in the cool of the air and the buzz of the light over the sink. “Hey, tough guy…”
Dean’s eyes moved quickly, checked each of the three angels opposite him for anything that could be the sword. Anything—
Bobby climbs to his feet pulling his phone from his back pocket and skedaddles into the bathroom to talk or take a piss or maybe both.
Most of it, Dean realized was weight training and stretches. Then Sam rolled himself halfway up a ramp and held the position without locking the wheels, backed himself down it and went up again, closer and closer to the top each time.
Dean breaks open the wall in Safire’s bedroom and finds an old brickwork chimney, the bullet and a silver dollar sized piece of Lucius Crane’s skull.
Seismographs would pick up a tremor at exactly six minutes after midnight as far west as Idaho. By dawn the media would be flooded with images of flattened buildings in Ilchester. Earthquake, they’d call it, “Gas Main Explosion Kills Fourteen in Abandoned Convent”; Dozens of sudden and inexplicable natural disasters around the world; earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods.
“Well, next time we’ll remember the Coppertone,” Dean hadn’t slept in three days. Not any more than thirty or forty stolen minutes on the side of the road so he wouldn’t have to surrender his keys and the comfortable groove his ass had worn in the Impala’s driver’s seat to Castiel.
“Dog…” Castiel shifted his shoulders and pulled his legs up, crossed them and rested his palms on his knees. He relaxed visibly, the glow in his throat growing and fading in time with his heartbeat and he reached out with his grace, brushed against every soul he could find— Dean’s stood out, he could feel it so strongly… But everything else was faded, indistinct. Murky. He shook himself and stretched out further, felt resistance deep in his core and visibly winced.
It took Sam two tries to get back into the car because his arms were so tired, but he didn't complain, seemed to lounge in the seat instead of sit there stiffly.
It’s funny how much can change in two hours. Sam was pacing, phone held to his ear, tie skewed. “Come on, pick up—“
He didn’t want to share himself like this—didn’t want to lose himself bit by bit, splinter by splinter until he didn’t have anything left to call his own. “Don’t… I-I can’t do this—“
Rufus was trying to peel the Xuphrek off his arm and scare the thing down a storm drain, but it wouldn’t go, just kept wrapping its suckers around his hand or clinging to his boots. Bobby put an end to it, said he wasn’t staying in a hotel room with a damned tentacle monster and Rufus narrowed his eyes, sprinkled more hair onto the thing, pleased when it had assumed a more ‘normal’ shape. “Can you stand a dog?”
Bobby stares at him; “You had a fit earlier just hearin’ this thing’s name, Dean. How the hell do you expect to be in the same room with it?”
They are damned noisy things, Seagulls and the dog had it in her head now that any time she saw one she was to lunge at it and snarl like a thing possessed.
Dean sat simply because there were about six too many people in the room with guns and itchy trigger fingers than he would have liked.
He vaguely heard Bobby yelling his name and then there was nothing. There was a time, bright and thoughtless, where he was in a strange place with strange walls and a soft bed. Strange faces flashing in his head that slowly named themselves as the stranger bending over him hummed something by the Kinks with a smile on his face.
For a second he looks confused, his eyes are unfocused just slightly, and Dean can almost see the smoke as the wheels in his head turn. After a moment Castiel’s lips purse, relax and pulls at his tattered overcoat, pats his chest; “This—this is a Vessel—”
Uriel looks like he’s got a new suit. Same color as the old one, but this one looks weirdly silkier. Less like wool and more like—well, SILK. Castiel is standing against the far wall with his hands in his pockets and his eyes locked on an image of Teddy Roosevelt on horseback hanging over the bed farthest from the door.  His jaw is tense and he looks strangely blank. Kind of like he’s just part of the décor.
Tessa shouts, reaches up and claws at the demon, commands him to stop, but Alastair presses the blade in tighter and begins to chant.
The alcohol stings, burns his eye, but Dean doesn’t say anything, prods around it with his fingertips checking for the beginnings of a bruise and slowly follows.
How he makes it to his feet he doesn’t know. But the next thing he is fully aware of, Cas is pushing a bottle at him, saying it’ll help.
Everything looked pretty much the same, but there were no dusty cobwebs in the corners, no grayed patches on the window.
Sam paws at him, gets the blankets from around him, pushes them toward the foot of the bed. “Dean? Dean, if you can hear me just focus on breathing. It’s OK, you’re gonna be OK!”
“Well, uh— if you like something, and you enjoy having it frequently, then you want that something.”
Dean went still, tried not to look it in the eye. Bobby had told him that once, about wild animals. Don’t look them in the eye they think it’s a sign of aggression and will attack you. He pulled on Castiel’s shirt tail and muttered, “Just back up slowly.”
Bobby remembers hearing his mother talk when he was very young, about his great grandmother’s death. How she had watched through a crack in the door as her mother, aunt and grandmother had washed the elderly woman’s body  where it lie stiffened by arthritis and cooling, had rubbed sweet talcum powder into her skin, curled her hair and rubbed rouge into her cheeks in preparation for her funeral. They hadn’t been able to afford a proper one, just a pine box and a linen cover for the coffin. He remembered hearing his mother speak of how the women had recited hymns and verses and laid silver dollars on her eyelids, then bound her hands together with green ribbon around a bunch of Damascus roses that grew out behind the shed.
Dean can hear the urgency in his voice now, it’s no longer hidden it the quick cadence of words, but is actually tinting the color of them into something uneasy. He nods.
Why is the TV on, why… He rolls out of bed, grabs up the sawed off and looks around, makes sure there are salt lines down on the windows and one in front of the door… There’s a smudge, small, doesn’t go all the way through but he’s not taking any chances, he inches toward the door to fix it and—
Cas’s head tilted again, in the opposite direction and he shifted forward a little, shoulder forward to offer the smallest target he could. Dean focused took in the cold outline of him, all scar tissue grey and empty bits shaped like hands.
The Xu-Cat stretched its legs and coiled around Rufus’ ankles before turning its pink nose to the air and padding off.
Thirty feet more and the Xuphrek made a screeching noise in the bucket and flung itself out again, wrapped around Castiel’s arm and started climbing quickly toward his face.
Sam doesn’t turn, doesn’t look away from his brother, but speaks to the demon, motions with the hand he’d been prodding his neck with toward the man on the other side of the room. “He’s hurt… go… get him out of here.”
Castiel sits and regards the world around him. How Man has remade it, unshaped and reformed the purity of the landscape and made something new and aesthetically pleasing. Places for their children to play and run and climb and jump. Concrete paths to walk on so the dirt doesn’t sully their shoes…
“No,” Dean groaned and threw himself back at the bed, sprawled on his back and shoved a hand in Castiel’s direction. “Let’s get this over with.”
Dean tilted his chin upward; “It’s no trouble, but we are going to have to see the body. Nothing personal, but the bureau did deploy us and we have to have something to put into the report. They don’t look too kindly on mistakes like this, solar flares or no.”
Bobby takes one of the leaves and flattens it out between his fingers, grumbles something under his breath, tosses the leaf into the sink and walks away, almost like he’s disappointed.
“Forget it,” Dean sighed and pushed his hair off his brow; “It’s probably just a cold… Used to happen to me a lot—You should have Sam tell you about the time I got us found by the Gripe we were hunting because I sneezed… Like something outta’ Bugs Bunny.”
Dean’s fingers shake and he has to squeeze them into a fist to stop it before he has the nerve to push the askew lid up and step back—
The demon tilted his face up into the wind, head shining and hairless one instant, and crowned with a thorny tangle of horns the next, face always grinning—placid and horrible and secretly hungry. It only vaguely resembled the other spider demons. This one was larger, somehow more twisted and regal, with some kind of burning pride in its eyes. Eyes… Yes, four of them, lidless and alight, like fire through bottle bottoms.
The rumble in the earth built and built to a terrible crescendo and the floor gave a sharp POP and cracked under Castiel’s feet, split right under the door and suddenly the blackness receded and the door crumbled like cinders. Dean’s swung open and he launched himself forward, grabbed Sam around the chest and tackled him to the ground—
She giggles—actually giggles while she’s perched atop his hips and says for a guy who didn’t want to fuck like bunnies until the apocalypse he’s sure doing a good job of it.
He calls Ian up as soon as the pressure dissipates and he’s sure it’s not an aura. Sputnik stays where she was, in front of his desk between him and the door, gnawing on her ball, she’s still young. Doesn’t have all her adult-dog teeth yet, he should be grateful she’s not chewing on his shoes at home.
Dean pulled his knee up toward his chest, breathed slow through another hard twist in his stomach and the words came out on a whine, barely audible as he reached for the keys. “The girl… The cheerleader. It’s the cheerleader.”
Physical therapy was a nightmare, surreal. Watching the muscle mass in his legs slowly fading while his chest and arms developed. He ached, had difficulty breathing, HATED it. Then followed Ellen slowly around the store during a grocery run, trying not to tear down clip strips, or knock over things in the too small aisles.
Dean has always felt at home on the road. Some of his fondest memories took place in the back seat of this very car, eye spy and card games. Comic books and watching Sam sleep through a cold while Dad drove and explained that vampires aren’t like the ones in the movies.
The girl looks at him, then at Dean, flicks her tongue over the points of her teeth and smiles a little; “Good to see you again, Dean…” Her eyes go dark, like pools of ink in her lovely face—it splits and tightens and warps and Dean knows her before she speaks again. Remembers her… Can’t unsee that wretchedness.
It’s a little bit of a relief when the Dracula doesn’t turn into a bat—as cool as that may have been—and it’s more frustrating than anything when the bastard gets away on a fucking Vespa, but Dean deals with it, guy left a piece of himself behind anyway so it doesn’t matter. They’ve got him now.
The world is cold and black shot with glittery lights amid the fog, dawn is still hours away but Dean thinks he can feel it growing on the horizon, empty and gray and hopeless and feels the words seething in his chest, feels Sam sitting there quiet and unquestioning, blameless like he has no right to be.
Zaphiel sighed, satisfied; “That was the smart thing to do,” The next second Sam was forced to his knees in the snow and the angel shoved his blade to the hilt through Sam’s right thigh—piercing through his calf and shin and five inches into the concrete pathway beneath him.
Dean stares at him for a moment longer, uncomfortable and twitching his hands for lack of something to distract himself with. In the end it’s not because Sam can stare longer without blinking, or any number of other excuses he makes so he doesn’t have to feel responsible for this act of ‘selfishness’. Dean looks away and rubs his face, rinses his toothbrush and bobs his head while he swallows past the knot in his throat; “Okay… yeah, okay.”
Benny snorted, “You really are a drama queen,” Instead of giving Sam back his knife he handed over a cell phone; “Go ahead and call the police if you wan’ta, try to explain to them why your brother’s got wings. In the mean time, try not to bleed all over the place back there, it's distracting.”
Sam’s exhausted. Rubs his face and chokes down two of those caffeine pills he bought at the gas station a while back. Dean doesn’t like it when he takes them, not that either of them are exactly stimulant virgins, but Sam gets snarky when he’s running on no sleep and too much caffeine.
They stare at one another for a long time. Dean revs the engine again, grins wide and turns the radio up.
Castiel scuffed the blankets back and slid under them, teeth chattering. Watched with watery blue eyes as Dean moved around in the tiny kitchenette. Sat the bag of his purchases on the counter top beside the stove and pulled out cans and packages.
Sam hooks one of the chairs with his foot and drags it closer, sits down and leans his elbows on the edge of the desk; “I know it sounds crazy, but… Yes.”
Uriel appraised him like one may find inspiration in dog shit on the bottom of their shoe and spoke down the length of his nose at Sam; “I don’t think I said anything about you… We only need him.”
Chuck crosses his arms, ties his robe shut at his waist and pushes his feet into a pair of flipflops.  He follows them warily, casting glances left and right as they exit the house and head toward the Impala.
Dean can’t move, is afraid to because this seems so alien, he just stands there with his breath held, heart in his throat and watches as those hands move in again, slowly, carefully.
It’s a novel concept, staring down at her, this small creature, with bones broken by demons and hearing only her concern for Dean, her NEED for Dean to be OK.
The vice-principal wasn’t nearly as intimidating. She was a taller woman in a pant-suit with close cropped graying blonde hair and an unfortunate affinity for blue eye shadow. She answered the questions Sam threw her way and when prompted offered a post-it note with the teacher in questions room number printed in quick precise script on it.
“Okay,” Destiny pressed her hands together, feet shoulder width apart; “Okay, what if I…” She rubbed her hands together, wrinkled her nose hopefully; “Cut your hair for free?”
He goes to Dean, intent on telling him that he can’t follow—and loses his words at the sight of him.
Sam took him back to the hotel sent a few texts to Bobby while Dean took a long shower, watched concerned as Dean came out shivering even harder with a blue tint to his lips and nail beds, arms hidden in the sleeves of his shirt. His knuckles were bloodless but there were red smears under the broken ends of his nails.
He hurt in his Heart, felt a want to pull Dean close and take away all the awfulness. He wanted Dean safe, relaxed and unfettered by guilt and nightmares. He wanted—
He ran until he couldn’t breathe, until his vision tunneled out to pinpricks and when he came back to himself he was sitting hunched in the V created by a crashed armored truck and what had once been a bank. It took a long while to get his breathing under control. Even longer to coax himself out of hiding. Too many repetitions of ‘Come on, Dean. Don’t be a pussy’ in his father’s voice, and ‘It’s OK, you can do this’ in Ellen’s.
Her lips move but there is no sound, nothing but the chanting; Pamela’s voice, strained, hissed and wet through gritted teeth.
The ‘Morphine’, made his head hum and his vessel lax, made his stolen human vision twinkle with colors and a listlessness settle in his limbs. Castiel, forced so close and deep into his vessel felt the effects of it as an unnatural lassitude. A muting of his senses while at the same time an expansion of his perceptions. His vessel seemed almost capable of understanding the scope of time, of thinking and existing in different states.
“I think someone’s got their chocolate in your peanut butter, Dean,” His finger lifts, almost touches the seal or whatever it was Cas had put on him but Dean finds his voice. “Someone plays dirty—“
Dean never talked about It directly, but there are only so many ways for a man to discuss Martin Sheen’s performance in
Sam is quiet, works his tongue against the backs of his teeth, then the alcohol gets the better of him and he turns to his brother with his nose wrinkled up; “If you’ve got something to say to me, say it.”
Dean discovered Sputnik was a good gambling piece rather quickly. That when it came to sniping guys at pool they took one look at her, in her little red sweater Sam had picked up in Sioux Falls and her service vest and took Dean for incompetent. They put up large sums of money and he cleaned them out just about every time. Sam thought it was funny as hell. Dean thought it was getting old fast, but wasn’t going to say no to easy money.
Bobby opened his mouth to protest but the Harvelles were already going. He spluttered after them ineffectually and resigned himself with a huff. Their car stared in the driveway and after it had pulled away Bobby stomped outside again with a grumble about deer proofing his garden.
Sam scrounged through his computer bag and found headphones, plugged them in and tried to drown out the bickering with something less… Just LESS.
“My grace is unstable, even though I’m drawing from you something has changed. I’m not able to perform as I once was, you yourself have pointed this out. I can’t see souls any longer. If we have any hope of finding out where this demon is, YOU have to do it.”
“You’re wrong—“ Dean feels it bubbling up in him, feels everything just BOILING to the surface. “You’re wrong.”
Dean lays there for a few minutes breathing deeply, feels his heart begin to race in trepidation, skims a hand down his chest under the blanket, over his stomach and hesitantly prods around the front of his boxers. He’s whole, there is no mess, just what feels like your typical lazy half interest from sleep.
Ellen looked at him questioningly and Rufus asked him what was wrong that there was no way in hell he was full already.
Rufus made a kissing noise at the Xuphrek then looked up at Bobby. “What I don’t understand is why one so young is out on its own.”
Sam’s back straightens and he speaks carefully, leans back a little and casts Dean a sideways look, then glances down toward the dog warily and back.
Dean turned his repaired sock right side out and pulled it on, wiggled his toes to check for comfort and grumbled as he put on his shoes; “She needs a bath too—“
“You asshole,” Sam muttered, “Couldn’t wait for me, could you!” He snapped his laptop shut and backed up across the room, fished the weapons bag from under the bed and went about loading himself for the proverbial bear… or Hulk, he supposed.
His mouth opens and closes and he feels himself speaking even if he hadn’t intended to; “I need to eat… Slept too long.”
Things are hazy for a while. Sam slaps him a few times and he feels like maybe that should be a big deal but at the moment nothing really matters. He got the monster. Mukilteo and the surrounding area are safe again. Trina’s broken leg will heal, Sam—from the hickey glowing purplered on his throat—got himself laid and—
Benny shakes his head; “Not how this works… My job is keepin’ him alive and right now all It wants you to do is rip into him… Sooner or later It’s gonna win and you know it.”
“Cas?” Dean touched his arm and all he could feel is warmth, pressure—the contact is electric, shoots up into his throat and pulls his breath out in a whoosh.
It was… was weirdly relieving. Freeing. Nobody to impress, nobody to save. Just violence for its own sake. That Dean could understand. Chaos in motion. No meaning behind it, no purpose. It just WAS. Simple, elegant, streamlined, pure in a way nothing he had ever encountered was.
Dean rubbed his face. “Well, this thing has been here kidnapping people for about five years now, maybe one escaped a long time ago. Any hell breaches about five—“And Dean’s heart skipped a beat.
Their eyes met, held for precious seconds longer than was strictly necessary, warmth and sadness and longing sparking into life between them—Then Dean looked away, chest tight, and bent to scratch Sputnik behind the ears. “We’ve got work to do.”
Everything HURTS. He doesn’t know where he is, why it’s happening or what’s going on. He’s blank inside and nothing makes sense. There’s nothing but that choking world ending PAIN.
Empty eye sockets watched him, gaping red mouths screamed silently at him as he passed. Some of the faces were twisted, heavily lined and… and SMILING. Others were dark and heavily textured with leaves and snake like scales—
Sam exhaled, Dean could almost hear an indulgent, sad smile in it… the bastard. He cracked open the door and peered out, couldn’t see Castiel’s face from there, but he could see the hunch of his shoulders under the blanket and hear the soft sound of his breathing. Feel the gentle pull of whatever connection bullshit they had between them.
Her thin little hand wrapped clean around the barrel of his Infield and as he watched she worked the bolt, brought it up to her shoulder, and took aim.
Jay’s voice shook; “No… I-if I see any of you again before sunrise,” He swallowed, “If I see any of you again before this thing is gone… I’ll shoot you.”
She watched him shifting uncomfortably. It was a barely perceptible motion, but she caught it. Caught the tinge of fear in the corner of his eye, the tightening of uncertainty at his jaw. The curl of his fingers as he struggled to gather his thoughts. “I can’t even really conceive of what you are. And yet, you’re here. You’re real. And you’re letting Dean Winchester teach you to be human… Why?”
“De—Dean!” Sam rubbed his face tiredly on his folded arms and let out a defeated sigh; “That means no…”
It wasn’t fair. It really, really wasn’t. The fact that this whole situation with Castiel could, in fact, be a manipulation weighed heavily on her mind. It was cruel. So cruel she couldn’t imagine it possible that angels would stoop to such a level, but that’s why it made so much sense! Angels had put Sam in a goddamned wheelchair, what’s to say they hadn’t done this too?
Dean pulled back, didn’t want to hear anymore. He snuffed and scratched the back of his neck, senses tingling. Bobby was still at the sink when he came out and Dean shuffled past, thrust open the partition and gave Sam’s shoulder a light smack when he found him sitting there on the sofa in the dark. “Come on.”
“I know a psychic, a few hours from here. Somethin’ this big, maybe she’s heard the other side talkin’.”
Lightning crashed overhead and the lights in the motel room flickered—dimmed—and went out. The world around Dean’s body felt muted and thick, like he was under water, moving at slow motion. Something shook the bed, hard.
Dean’s headed north, Sam’s gone south, the wind is getting worse and Sam’s face is almost numb. The police haven’t said anything about another disappearance. Nobody’s heard anything.
Dean barely even noticed the walk back to Jay’s house. He only became aware of his proximity to it when he heard Sputnik barking and saw Sara’s worried face in the living room window. She didn’t unlock the door right away, just stood there peering at Bill through the glass with her brows drawn down angrily; “Where’s my father—Bill—WHERE IS MY FATHER!”
They left the motel quickly. Castiel had time to pull his jeans back on before Dean shoved Sputnik into his arms and pushed him out the door.
Sam peeled back the bandages on Dean’s back and wing—there, he said it without flinching this time—and found the skin around each wound reddened and blistering, that same blueish white light peeking out between the stitches.
“Oh, my God…” He flattened himself back across the mattress and stared up at the ceiling with his mouth hanging open. His fingers pressed into the coverlet on either side of his body, felt the springy pillow of the mattress top and the painful burning ache in his back as all his vertebrae began to stretch out. “I want one. I don’t have anywhere to put it, but I want one.”
Sam makes a pie. He makes pancakes, banana pudding, banana bread, milkshakes and goddamned banana splits.
Dean blinks, turns to Bobby and swipes his tongue over his lips; “Because. ‘Why me?” He looks at Sam as if the whole thing is preposterous, the expression holds long enough that he meets Bobby’s eyes, then it’s different. Not so much changes, but is no less different. He looks so scared.
He doesn’t speak again for close to two weeks and even then there’s a resignation to his features. A sadness –regret.
Gabriel sighed and climbed down off the chair, sat and leaned over his knees tiredly. “It's not like that. He doesn't need you to save the world, or do anything you aren't already doing... He's half human. He needs his family. Even if it's just to pop in and eat your food.”
As soon as the lab is shut away in the Focus and the woman has pulled out of her parking space Sputnik goes quiet, still straining at the end of her lead, panting and snorting and sneezing, but she’s not barking—not snarling. By the time the car is at the end of the lot she’s calm again, breathing heavily and still kind of foamy around her mouth but the light around her has diminished, eased back to a soft glow the color of honey.
Shaw explains as they lead the demon inside, that the girl’s name is Tilly, she had been in a mental institution, her parents had put her there for ‘hearing voices’ but it seems the poor girl had been possessed the whole time, she’d tried to kill herself to escape them—HAD killed herself, but the demon kept her meat suit going.
What kind of world was it when Angels tortured other angels? It—he felt sick, SQUEEZED his hands together and tried to push that part of himself that considered his Cas and Castiel the same thing out of his head. They weren’t the same, would never be the same and it was wrong to hope for it. It was wrong because Castiel was and never could be Cas. Ever.
“It’ll take a few weeks for the paperwork to go through,” He spoke slowly, “But I’m excited,” He patted Sputnik’s head again, then looked right at Dean; “How long did you have to wait?”
Dean felt his nose crinkling up in disbelief. “Jo? Really? Little—Little five-five, Joanna Beth Harvelle?”
“That narrows it down a lot… Go sixth through twelfth-street, everything lower than sixth is houses.”
“It’s like the whole town is cursed,” Sam lifted the cloth away from his eyes and refolded it, “Just bizarre things—impossible things with no connection.”
“Well, Jesse Turner is about as average as you can get. B-student, won last year’s Pinewood Derby. But, get this!” Sam was grinning broadly; “Jesse’s adopted… And his birth records are sealed.”
“The decision had to be made solely by you. Your judgment, your weapons, your call. It had to be determined if YOU would make the correct decision.”
Bill snorted where he was leaned up against the front bumper of his truck rolling what Dean dearly hoped was just a cigarette.
Dean breathes in and out, lifts up onto his elbows and stares down at him. Wonders if maybe, from his stillness, if he hasn’t actually died. Overdosed or given Dean what was left of himself and just—just gone out like a match flame.
“Yeah, it’s okay. I didn’t think… Just, be sure to eat something, if you can. Want me to save a potato for you?”
He turned in her direction, face scrunched up in something close to anger; “It’s not like that—I can’t…I don’t—I haven’t,” He shudders and a little voice in his head that sounds like Alistair hums Gershwin and peels back the memories of Canonsburg and Jamie and that guy from the bar to look at through a projector made of his ribcage and Dean can’t breathe. Drops Castiel’s hand and folds in on himself nausea rolling around in his stomach like something alive and fighting for freedom. He digs his nails into the backs of his arms.
“Not really the appropriate time to talk fashion, Dean…” She turns and looks at Sam; “You let Jimmy get away?”
Sam pushed himself up and paced, scratched his nails on the legs of his jeans, ground his teeth and contemplated breaking something.
“I mean, at least you’ve still got some kind of feeling down there. I’m just—” He let his breath out in a huff. “Fuck… I’m sorry, okay?”
Dean’s phone rings suddenly and he almost cries out in shock of the noise, fumbles in his pocket and takes some time to breathe before he puts the phone to his ear; “Yeah?” When he looks up again the angel is gone.
It’s only then that Dean realizes the curtains have been drawn and there’s a dismantled gun near Adam’s right hand. He snarls. It’s pathetic sounding, but it gets their attention, gets Sam on his feet when Dean tries to push himself up.
“No, no, I’m good,” Dean entered the room and found a group of chairs spaced into a circle. Thought it was just like some of the crap off TV and wanted to spin on his heel and leave, but Sputnik was making nice with Destiny and Sam was pulled up beside her talking quietly with a little grin on his face. Chad and Ryan were at the back of the room, stacking doughnuts and shortbread cookies on tiny paper plates.
That’s where Bobby found him an hour or so later, on his knees next to the flowers pulling out weeds and removing discarded leaves and old petals. He watched the younger man for a while, let him have his thoughts, only interrupted when Dean found fruit hanging from one of the plants and his eyes widened.
Dean crosses his arms, winds Sputnik’s lead around his fist a little more tightly. “Is that what that was? When I heard you in my head? The grace?”
Sam swallowed, he was still smiling, but it was tense, forced, Sam was suddenly scared, he was just good at hiding it. Dean would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little frightened as well.
The kitchen was warm, even with the door open, and Dean smelled fried chicken and fried potatoes. He took the plate Jo shoved against his chest and poked his tongue out at her spitefully. Jo rolled her eyes;
He let out his breath in a whoosh and scrubbed the back of his wrist against his brow, felt the greasy smear of oil against his skin and reached for the flashlight he’d had magnetized to the frame. “I really don’t know what you want me to say. I’m fine… I—I gotta deal with this on my own.”
Castiel was in front of him, lying on his face, eyes closed, lips parted. He wheezed in his sleep—and Bill was across the room pouring scotch into his coffee.
He sighed, shoulders buyunching as he peered out from between his arms; “At this point, I’m willing to try just about anything.”
There were voices from another room down the hall, soft chatter, and a few women were standing together by the window with crumpled tissues in their fists.
“This car is landlocked. God can go anywhere He so chooses at any time. If we want even a chance of finding him, Dean, we have to do things my way. If you’re so averse to flying let me borrow—“
Dean stared down at what was left of his sandwich, stomach bubbling, and with a sigh tossed it in Sputnik’s direction and went to wake Cas.
There were Voices. Loud like the first crashes of thunder in the spring. Forks of lightning that froze and moved with a foreign purpose. There was LIGHT—so bright it leeched the color from everything.
He took a second to let that sink in, then nodded, and nodded again to cement it in his own mind. “How?”
Two nurses come in, the taller one with the pregnant belly introduces herself as Sandra, the shorter nurse is Quinn and together they maneuver Sam from his back to his left side, rearrange the pillows and blankets, fiddle with this machine and that. Blood pressure and blahblahblah. Bobby tries to ignore what they’re doing, his stomach is unsettled by the alienness of seeing someone else move Sam’s legs for him. It kind of solidifies the situation in his mind and he excuses himself, goes for coffee and takes a quick detour outside to make a few phone calls.
She finds him deep in the trees to the west, one hand bracing himself up against a birch, the other on his knee, his whole body shaking with unproductive dry heaves. She doesn’t get close, just calls out to him when he goes quiet to breathe and asks if he’s OK.
Stupid angel. Stupid Dean for being so fucking worried when all it got him was a harsh attitude. And still, he thought a crabby angel was an improvement to the silent apathetic one. At least he’d not carved up his arms that morning to repaint the sigils on the walls. Bobby’d had to stitch the last one and if Castiel was going to be stuck like this indefinitely, the last thing they needed was someone catching sight of the marks on his skin and thinking he was suicidal.
Castiel’s eyes widen and Dean sees the fear in them blaze brightly, like all the stars in all the galaxies have gathered there and are fighting to get out and the angel begins to squirm, trying to free himself, but Alastair grips tighter, seems to swell and the barn shakes—the smell of hellfire rises and Dean could feel the growing power in the demon like an ache in his bones.
Sam snorted. “You can tell me, yanno. I’m not gonna think less of you…” He leaned forward a little in his seat, “I helped you to and from the toilet in Cheyenne for a week, remember? I’m not gonna think less of you.”
He can hear them roaring and screaming and hear the living trees moaning deep and low in a way that echoes through the earth.
Castiel appears, his vessel looking openly surprised. He inflates his chest and warily takes half a step forward. His color flares and Dean becomes aware of a tingling in his follicles. Castiel is Present now, not lingering, he looks exhausted, kind of like he’s had too much coffee and his clothes are more rumpled than normal.
The archangel spent the night on the sofa, wrapped in his blanket, and the next morning had prepared enough French Toast to feed six Winchesters. Or himself and four others.
“Dean, we have to go!” Castiel grabs him again, shakes him hard enough that Dean’s teeth rattle, and pulls him up. Dean wobbles on his feet, one hand to his head and finally gets a look at the room—or what’s left of it.
Susan McHenry was an older woman who dealt with obscure ‘supernatural’ creatures, she had a farm further south where she took in the ‘harmless’ breeds and let them live in relative safety. She had agreed when Sam called her, to meet them and take the beast off their hands. She drove a beat-up Ford pickup truck with an aluminum water tank in the back and with Sam’s help untied the wyrm and transferred it from the Impala.
Sam snuffed and took another drink, followed Bobby with his eyes as the older man limped in and went for the coffee pot, settled himself gingerly into a chair across from Castiel and let Ellen take a look at the cut on his cheekbone.
The first—the silver knife—the blade had been dulled visibly, the kitchen knife was melted down to a blackened hilt—but the iron knife was TWISTED, bubbled—like it had been melted and poured into icewater and set in a weird—almost waxen shape.
Castiel climbed to his feet and wandered outside, found Dean in the paint booth laying down clear coat in its final breath thin layers. He peered in through the spy hole in the door and watched, heard Dean singing slightly off key while he worked, he had a Walkman shoved into the front of his overalls and headphones on under his hood. Every so often his hips would make an unnecessary swinging motion or his heel would sliiiiiide against the ground a little as he moved. He shuffled over to the mixing table and poured more clear coat into the reservoir, tucked his elbows close to his body and rocked his hips side to side, mimed a drum solo and turned back to the truck—He jerked suddenly, “Son of a bitch!” His head lifted, eyes honing in on Castiel’s face through the spy hole and his hands went self-consciously to his sides, body locking up, eyes scowling behind his goggles; “Learn to freakin’ knock, Cas!”
Castiel lifted a hand and stared at it, then realized Dean wasn’t talking about his vessel and put it down again. “My grace is recharging, I don’t know why I would have dreamt.”
Sam remembered the dog running at him all bloodshot brown eyes and sick-greasy maw open wide. Bobby had knocked him out of the way, pulled that gun out and BANG.
But Sam’s hands balled into fists and he reversed, turned quickly and banged out onto the porch, slamming the door behind him.
Sam had shown his brother the bottle when he picked it up. Dean had been sitting in the chair by his hospital bed in sweats, a t-shirt  and that ridiculous neck brace the doctors insisted he wear looking annoyed with the world, staring at the ass ugly purple socks they’d put on him with the white zigzag tread on them. He’d looked up at Sam, looked at the bottle and turned to focus on the corner again, like it fascinated him.
Dean felt like his body was nothing but an amorphous lump of mucus and oily tissue. He oozed out of the car and staggered drunkenly a few paces to the nearest tree. Sat down against it with his chin tilted up and all his limbs flopped against the ground, spread eagle trying to find some kind of relief. He felt like he was drowning in the heat.
It’s once they’re stopped in the parking lot and Dean has already exited the truck that he notices the delicate tremble in Castiel’s chin, made all the more disturbing by the diffused jaundice light of the restaurant’s signage. It takes him a moment to realize it’s not emotion, but chill. A fine rash of gooseflesh beneath the displaced cuff of his jacket.
“Yes. Forgiveness MEANS something. It’s absolution without penance… I—I don’t understand it and I can’t do it.”
Bobby gave him a long, hard look and slowly started thumbing through the money in his hand again; “Any particular reason why?”
Dean stares at him, tense and defensive and huddled against the door like he’s afraid of Sam; “Why?”
Sam grabs a tray away from the server and Jo aims a kick at the cartoon Kangaroo and snags two vanilla milkshakes. They stuff their faces quickly between staring in a commercial for T-shirts, “The Touch, the feel of Cotton! The Fabric of our lives!”
Jo lurched upright quickly and went to Sam, pulling him up into a sitting position so he could breathe. Dean—Dean rolled to his hands and knees and shook his head like a dog to clear it. Pushed up on shaking legs and leaned against the wall, eyes locked on the stern, yet sad expression on the plastic Castiel’s face where he was protruding from under the coffee table.
He could. Like a draft through cracked windowpanes. He could feel hellfire burning through. It made his stomach hurt… made that pustule of sealed off memories in his head ACHE.
“Maybe you’re just seeing things, Dean. I mean—you’ve been through a metric shit-ton of Bad. Nobody’s expecting you to come through it without some kind of issue… Maybe you just need a break.”
Julia shifted her feet uncomfortably. “No… He was born and he went away. That’s it. Are we done here?”
The truck ahead of them only has one functioning tail light and someone’s duct taped a halogen lamp to the hood in an effort to replace a busted headlight. It casts uneven ugly shadows against the car ahead of them, catches on downed limbs and debris in the road. Every so often they have to dodge into the median or onto the berm to circumvent pileups or things Dean tries not to look at.
The air punches out of Dean’s chest and for a minute he thinks he might just drop backward into the floor like a fucking starlet but Sam grabs the sleeve of his coat and pulls with a childish urgency, mutters his brother’s name and pulls again.
Sputnik is lazing about under Dean’s feet chewing on her towel, Dean’s sitting on the edge of the folding table absently swinging his feet. He glances down at her and wrinkles his nose. The towel’s clean and smells fresh but won’t for long now that she’s got it back, he shakes his head.
“Ah, good. Well, I’ve got to put Mister Kingston’s paperwork through, but they’ll be moving him to a room shortly. I’m sorry to say that he’ll likely be placed on a public ward, but I can show you to the waiting area if you’d like.”
The wound on his chest was still sluggishly bleeding but the light had thinned to a dim glow and by the time Bobby had padded gauze over it whatever was lit up inside of him seemed to have gone out or healed over or been concealed beneath the clotted blood.
Sam flicked on his high-beams and saw a pale figure emerging from the woods with a mag-light in his left hand. He rolled down the window and shut the Prius’ engine off, then shouted as loudly as he could;
Bobby… Bobby sees something different. He sees a little kid who learned tough lessons too soon. A young man who has very little sense of self-worth but a really handy set of masks that fit oh-so-perfectly over the cracked exterior and balls enough to fake it anyway. Like filler in all your dents, it may look good on the outside, feel smooth under your hand, but it’s all plastic under the paint.
“Not hard enough,” Dean looks at him, watches feels a pressure growing in his chest like something’s trying to wedge itself in there and hollow him out. Like the air before a lightning strike.
Dean moves without thinking, or maybe he’s thinking too much, his eyes are alight and excited and before he can stop himself he has the angel’s face pressed between his palms and is staring into those denim blue eyes; “You son of a bitch, Cas.”
Dean felt it happen. Felt it down deeper than his bones. One minute there was nothing for his grace to reverberate against, nothing for his energy to ‘Resonate’ with as Castiel had called it. Then one minute there was, as if it had never been absent. He turned on the balls of his feet and there the angel was, standing in the doorway looking rumpled and disturbed and more than a little frightened. The knife in his hand clattered to the floor and he took a deep, shaking breath, eyes casting about as if in search of the antichrist.
Her lips part and something like pity or understanding flashes in her eyes, but she doesn’t say anything, just nods.
Dean gets annoyed quickly and downs half the contents of his flask. He’s been awake since a little after four, had woken with Sam bending over him, shaking him and visions of Uriel gleefully throwing him back into the pit still BURNING behind his eyes, the angel’s WORDS still ringing in his head like church bells.
She’s tall, thin, with dark hair and light eyes. She’s wearing a Ramones shirt and smiles with everything she’s got, laughs in genuine good humor and pulls Bobby in for a hug. Growls and hefts the older man off the ground.
Dean followed, because Sam said he could in that voice that said; ‘Don’t leave me alone back there’.
The sizzling grew louder and Dean thought he could hear Sam saying his name, but then it cut out completely.
“Because you can’t keep letting me force you to do stuff like this. If you do that, I’m no better than those assholes upstairs!”
Bill met Dean’s eyes when they peeled open and bobbed his chin in greeting, voice low; “We still got an hour or two before sundown. There’s a freak storm gathering right over us.”
Sam opens his eyes and stares around, sees corpses without eyes and gaping bloody mouths. The smell is toxic and he gags into one bloody hand as Anna pulls him bodily upward and pushes him toward the door. She snaps her fingers in the direction of the fryers and they spontaneously ignite, boil over. Flames eating away at the building like living things.
“Don’t,” He cut into the pancake; “Don’t apologize…” He breathed in deeply while he chewed; “I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry.”
“I don’t—“ He snuffed wetly, coughed, “—I don’t like that show. It’s—“ He seemed to struggle for the word, mind hazed by sleep and cold medicine, gripped the blanket and pulled it tight over his shoulder; “—It’s scary.”
“That’s fascinating…” James sets the dog down and pushes to his feet. He hasn’t opened his bottle of water. “I’m out of time… I have to go.”
Sam kills her, demon and all with a curl of his hand and they leave Cindy’s body by the side of the road halfway covered in broken brambles and weeds. Sam wonders if this means something, or if it means nothing at all in the larger scheme of things.
Gabriel gingerly took a pistol when Eileen pushed it into his hands. “I don't like firearms. Even toy firearms.”
Dean pushes his hands away, chokes on a breath and wraps both arms around Castiel’s shoulders, hides his face in his neck; “Don’t.”
Tracy says she doesn’t know Wallace, doesn’t think Jenny did either. The water had been just fine a few seconds before when she’d done it. How could water boil that quickly?
Does it have a nickname? Anything to identify it specifically. Does it recognize anything any of the others have called it, does it accept something as its name? It can take a name for itself, anything at all!
He feels himself yanked free—dangling like a torn scrap of meat between titanic fingers, carried up-upupup and away. The PUSH IN of the darkness and Dean feels himself drawn in close. Sheltered…
Dean wrinkled his nose. “I’m not chasing tail! And the Cas thing is… it’s complicated, Sam. Really complicated, I mean—“
“Cas says they’re called the Crawling Ones… I—I think they’re more like spiders. They’re responsible for transporting souls in hell… Crash course, Hell is real, apparently Heaven is too. OK? Good, I—I’ll spare you the details about Hell, but these demons don’t move souls in one piece.”
Dean leaves Sputnik safely locked in the car, but it doesn’t stop her from yipping excitedly and leaving a foamy dogspit mess all over the windows trying to escape to get to them.
Right now, you go to sleep and tomorrow morning you and Castiel go find God. You want to help? That’s what you do.
Dean came back he didn’t know how long later. It couldn’t have been anything more than thirty seconds, but it felt like eternity. Alastair was still standing there, gun in hand, SMILING. “Welcome back, Dean, have a nice trip?”
Ruby throws up her hands; “Oh, well that’s fantastic. Captian Chatterbox over there’s having a nervous break-down! Anna’s grace is GONE and we are now the fucking Ar-em-ess Titanic of lost causes!”
Dean feels it bubbling in his chest and doesn’t immediately know what’s happening until the laugh has already erupted. “Aw, man. Seriously? You—Oh, no… No no. I don’t believe it.” He turns in his seat to look at Castiel with new perspective. “Have you really never—“
Castiel’s shoulders went up a little, chin going down like he wasn’t sure if he’d done the right thing or not. Like a kid who spoke up and now everyone’s just staring at them agape. There wsn’t any middle ground to this, he either fucked up beyond all redemption or he’s dazzled everyone. Self-consciousness didn’t look good on him, Dean didn’t like it at all.
Dean stared at the packaging, held it up and let the greenish lights of the truck stop sparkle against the cellophane. “I don’t remember that.”
Dean stared at the Motel, lost in a haze of rain, the cars packed into the lot and the orange bug lights outside every room. Then he turned to the two-lane, stretching off to his right, glittering under the slightly green glow of streetlamps.
“Don’t forget the joy buzzer,” Jo said, motioning to the ham. “If we can’t figure that one out we should sell them on QVC, it’d knock the George Foreman Grill right off the air.”
Dean swallows a bitter taste in the back of his throat and looks at his brother, watches him finger that flask in his hands and the regret in his eyes slide away into determination. He slides it back into his pocket and turns to face the door.
Alastair is smiling, broad and bloody with both his faces and he gestures upward with a gentle nod of his head; “You should talk to your plumber about the pipes—“
Alastair still has the scythe in his human hand, the other eight are stretched out wide, claws exposed. He tilts his heads and SMILES; “You can’t run, Dean… Not now. Not from me.”
“It—it’s just different, okay! It’s—“ He made a rolling gesture with his fingers and couldn’t quite make himself look Castiel in the eye. “It’s better—nicer, when there’s someone else there… J-just close and wi-willing—“ He cleared his throat, “It—“ It’s claustrophobic, crushing. Messy. You lose a part of yourself during, let yourself be possessed OWNED—tearingwantingtakingstealing bruises shaped like fingerprints and hands pinning you down—
NOTE! I broke this chapter into two chapters because once I finished writing it I realized it was 50+ pages, and even for me that's excessive. So, enjoy part 1! Any mistakes are my own as I am exhausted and won't get to proofread it until later.
“—But I had a bad one a while back. It—It’s not something I want to repeat,” Dean stretched one leg out and raked his nails against the side of his thigh; “Sputs helps a lot, she can like smell it before it happens—Anyway the website said that’s likely what gives her the heads up—but she barks at me if she smells something off.”
One meeting, two—six later and Sam felt like maybe—maybe this wasn’t a death sentence. Maybe he would be able to do this.
Dean shifts in his seat, lifts his head away from the glass and swipes his fog-drawings away with his sleeve, watches the little town shift by and rubs gingerly at the back of his neck. Sam gives his shoulder a light smack and points emphatically at the neck brace half hidden in the floorboard.
. Sam exhales and the sound of it rattles over the line. A few minutes later Bobby can tell the younger Winchester has stepped outside from the sound of traffic.
Too bad the local newspaper had published a photo and story about the unfortunate squirrel and now everyone in the city could hear the phantom ticking.
“After our little… uh—‘Experience’. For that whole year, I felt like I had this hole in my gut. Like I was missing something… I didn’t know what. But you know what it was? It was you… The pain of losing my father and Sammy. I just— I wish I’d gone with you then… Maybe none of this would have happened if I had.”
Sam wants to ask, wants to know if there’s something he can do to fix it, but he knows there’s not. This isn’t something that can be talked into submission, or dealt with as a team. As much as he wants to take this weight, he can’t and the fact of it hurts somewhere deep in his chest. This might actually be worse than Dean looking up at him, battling sleep and asking him with that terrified high whine in his voice ‘don’t let him get me’ this is worse because they’ve both realized the monster has already done its damage and now they have to deal with the aftermath.
There isn’t much to do in hospitals. You can wait, you can sit and wait, you can pace and worry yourself sick. You can badger the nurses and doctors until they call security. But all of it amounts to one thing. WAITING.
There was also a gaping, eight foot hole where the front door should be, taped off with a crinkly blue tarp and yellow police caution tape.
Dean improved quickly, he could walk with little to no problem, could breathe on his own and the notes he scribbled on the yellow steno pad he’d been given were only slightly untidy and Sam could convince himself that was because of the continued pain medication. It seemed the cold treatment he’d been given had worked. The physical therapist, an older woman with short gray hair and a broad smile seemed optimistic. She’d got Dean up and shuffling around the Tuesday after he’d woken up, had laughed a booming strong laugh when Dean had peered at her from the corner of his eye and scribbled quickly on his notepad that she’d given him an atomic wedgie with the walking belt.
“And exactly how do you kill these things?” Dean tipped the bucket up and sneered at the creature inside.
If he had been there, at Dean’s side, he would have been able to help, or at least aid Dean in fighting the demons back. Dean wouldn’t have exerted himself—wouldn’t have ripped that protective barrier around the grace and his memories open.
Sam didn’t want to see him. Sam didn’t want him there because he knew. He KNEW it was Dean’s fault he was hurt and he could SEE the guilt written like a curse across Dean’s face. Could read the weakness in him as plainly as the words in any book.
“Well, I ouijii’d my way through a dozen spirits, no one seems to know who broke your boy out, or why.”
He comes out of the bathroom just as Sam’s finishing with his arm, his nose is swollen and his eyes are bloodshot. His mouth doesn’t look much better and he’s still sweating, still shaking. Sam doesn’t think it’s from pain, not from his shoulder anyway, but clamps his teeth shut. Dean takes long slow pulls from a bottle of Wild Turkey and paces some more.
Dean sighed and pushed to his feet, retreated into the bathroom to brush his teeth. “It’s not that kind of argument. This—this is a FUN argument.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “You're down for the count, I really don't think loads of sugar is going to do you any favors.”
The bartender snaps the breach shut and lifts the gun to his shoulder, whistles merrily as he aims down the barrel.
Sam’s always been a bit of a lightweight when it comes to narcotics. He can hold his alcohol better than even Dean sometimes, but slip him some pot or a powerful pain reliever and it’s all rainbows and unicorns in Sammy-Land.
In the end, Dean only managed to disentangle himself from the angel by virtue of his human stubbornness and Castiel’s waning angelic strength.
Sam knows the stages of grief, he took psychology. Helped Jess study for all her psych courses, he should have just taken a goddamned minor in it honestly, but it doesn’t help.
It takes a while to find a good place to do it. Someplace they won’t be disturbed or risk hurting other people. Takes another two, maybe three hours to get all the sigils painted on the walls, ceiling and floor; Salt lines laid down and everything as tightly guarded as they’re gonna get it.
Castiel had discovered the TV and was watching reruns of some talk show. There were five women sitting around a table arguing about the state of the economy and the safety of children in schools. Then one of them mentioned something about a TV show with doctors winning a bunch of awards and the audience went crazy.
The guy at the window has turned around completely now, is staring at them with dark cold eyes. “Enough of this—“
Revisiting each of the scenes Dean finds the same message rubbed into the glass of the policeman’s basement window, the band kid’s rear view mirror and in tall big letters across the doctor’s bedroom windows.
There are doctors and back boards and neck braces and a nurse pushing Castiel away in a wheelchair while Dean shouts that they were mugged. He didn’t see much, but they were mugged. He presses the urgency of those words toward Castiel and catches blue eyes locked with his own in brief understanding before the ER swinging doors clap shut and Dean’s left surrounded by a throng of nurses trying to push him down into a wheelchair.
Dean moves closer with every step until he’s right there, so close Castiel’s vessel’s eyes almost cross looking at him. “Just so you understand… Why I can’t help.”
Chuck’s color is… Chuck has Color. It’s the first time Dean’s ever seen it. He’s a dull lavender, but around his head there is a soft, gentle corona of Pale yellow. Dean has never seen someone with that kind of, for lack of a better word, HALO of a second color. There’s a BRIGHTNESS similar to it around Cas’ head, around all angel’s heads he suspects, but he’s never seen a person with one.
Sam swallows a lump in his throat tries not to think of this as a failure, tries not to think of having to make Dean eat again and glancing at his fingers and knuckles for bruises from his teeth every time he walked past. “Why?”
Dean feels it, like the current in a river, it passes into THROUGH him in broad tendrils, poke and prod at the PAIN in his head, that PRESSURE and ease it away—
“Unless something wanted to power it down, but not enough to leave it vulnerable to attack from other demons. And not powerful enough to put up a fight.”
He hits the cold spot about halfway down the hallway, sees his breath go white in the air and his hackles raise. Isn’t really surprised the thing would manifest behind him, but then again, he was dumb enough to fall for the old ‘Shining’ trick anyway.
Dean swallowed audibly and Sam turned his head to look at him, saw Dean’s fingers pulling the blanket a little more tightly over his shoulder.
Bobby lets out a whooshing breath of relief and focuses on the road for a little while longer. “How you doin’, Kid?”
The room was on the second floor, at the back of the building overlooking a basketball court and a smoker’s shed. No smoking in the rooms, please and thank you.
Dean blinks, blinks some more and his eyebrows draw down; “They cleared a path for us—which means this—“
All he could remember was being scared. Seeing Alastair hunched over Castiel like that, building himself up with that spell… Dean hadn’t really thought, he’d just reacted. He’d wanted that demon away from Castiel. He’d wanted that THING away from his Cas—
There was no full moon on the winter solstice in 2008, therefore that CANNOT be the time during which the episode takes place!
He finds the sides of her head with his hands, tangles his fingers in her fur and for a long while just sits there and watches his numb digits pass through her ruff, pusher ears flat and watch as they spring upright again. She looks at him. Looks him right in the eye and there is no blame there, no condemnation, no pity or anger.
Alastair blinks and leans in as well, breath hot and wet and smelling like brimstone; “’And it is written that the first seal shall be broken when a righteous man sheds blood in hell. As he breaks… so shall IT break.’”
Dean doesn’t look at him, can’t make himself really. He turns and heads for the door, tries to be forceful when he speaks but it comes out cracked; “Are you coming or not?”
Something in his chest pops and crackles. Collapsed lungs suddenly inflate, his heart shudders—skips and beats to quickly. He’s used to it, doesn’t realize what it is until he’s choking, coughing.
It’s a pretty open and shut case after Bobby gets back to them the following afternoon with means of killing the Ahuizotl. Blood of a bird (any bird apparently, Moss Dogs included, Eagle just seemed more majestic than ‘random bird’ in Navajo) on a gold knife, not silver. Which meant bad news for Sam and Dean who would have to get close enough to stab the thing…
Sam cuts him off, meets his brothers eyes and lifts his brows earnestly; “There’s nothing to worry about, Dean. Lilith and me? In bed?”
It isn’t hard to find Anna’s home address. It is however a little difficult dealing with what they find inside.
“Dean—I didn’t expect you in today. How are you?” He closed the door behind himself and eyed the dog distastefully when she lowered her head and pinned her ears back at him.
There’s a spider in the corner, it’s pale and dried and dead but it’s the first animal Dean’s seen since he arrived. It’s fascinating. Pristine and preserved in a delicate web frosted with dust particles.
Dean’s face contorted; “Oh, like you didn’t get a power kick out of me being down? Okay, well at least I’m just driving you around instead of—“
The woman slid on a braided rug and swung herself into a pantry, throwing her slight weight against the door just as Jo caught the jamb.
Sam could only see Dean’s silhouette against the brightness and he lifted a hand to shield his eyes from it, felt his mouth fall open in complete shock because this—What was
Sam dropped his pen; “Okay, this—this is insanity. What the hell is going on here! Did—did Sabrina the teenaged witch grow a dark side? I mean, come on!” He motioned to the list he’d made of ‘weirdness’. “We’ve got a guy whose smoked for thirty years LITERALLY coughing up a lung, a girl with a three pound gumball in her stomach, poprocks and coke times three, a guy with a frozen face, and a girl scratching her brains out because of itching powder—“
“I know souls, Dean… I may not be able to see hers, but I can feel it, and I promise you, that is not Sputnik.”
The room was on the second floor, at least two doors away from anyone else, thank Christ, and when Dean opened the door he had his breath held.
Castiel rubbed his neck; “I don’t know, it had never happened before… I was surprised—and frightened.”
Zechariah is waiting for him—catches his fist and finds the center of Dean’s forehead with the deceptively gentle touch of two fingers.
Adam smiles; “She probably smells Jasmine on me…” He looks up when Sam quirks an eyebrow at him; “My girlfriend’s cat,” He leans to the side again to look at her and Dean thinks the smile Adam gives the dog is somehow unpleasant.
“And that’s supposed to comfort me?” He turned a cold, calculating eye on the angel; “You’re not the only ones looking to sway or capture it.”
“Because there’s a catch, Sam. There’s always a catch. He didn’t do it outta the kindness of his heart, he had a reason, he wants something—so I’m gonna get him before he gets me."
Castiel scans the menu, has it memorized in just a moment, but looks at it for five more minutes. There are too many choices. Too many variables. Why can’t this be easy?
Castiel’s hair is dirty. It’s one of a myriad of things Dean notices when he climbs out of the car. One of many things, but it’s the one thing he chooses to focus on instead of Bobby humming to himself as he finishes carving away pieces of a deer carcass hanging from a chain in the empty bay opposite the Impala.
Mukilteo is a small town, quaint. Reminds Dean vaguely of those New England towns with the fantastic food he remembers from his early twenties. All the long legged women with
She looks different-- seems to GLOW from within, her eyes blazing like distant flame on low cloud cover; “You have to leave. NOW—“
Castiel tolerated Bobby changing his bandages with all the grace of a goddamned stone. He looked on distastefully at the scabs and blood and made unhappy faces when he tried to get up or move and it hurt or Bobby told him to stay put, or eat something or drink some water or swallow these pills or HELP dammit because Dean was screaming and clawing at his face and JESUS what did the Winchesters get him into THIS TIME.
Then it happened. From the distance came a sharp shrill, animalistic cry like nothing Dean had ever heard before. Bill lurched to his feet. “It’s Kia—Jay!”
Lucifer withdraws, like Dean is no more annoying than a spot of dirt under his nail. He stands there with Sam’s shoulders slumped and this kicked puppy look on his face. “I am not the evil here. I am not the mistake.”
He can’t speak, feels the words burning in his throat like stomach acid. He turns his eyes away and tries to convince himself that he’s done right by Dean, that pushing him away is the correct course of action. That Dean wouldn’t kill himself… That SAM wouldn’t kill himself, but he can’t. He feels sour—bitter and strangely selfish. He—he feels ashamed for even thinking it because he already has. He’d thought—The only way I’m gonna keep him safe is if I’m not there and the first thing he’d pictured wasn’t pushing Dean away.
“Lucid dreaming?” Dean wrinkles his nose, “Isn’t that where you—“ He motions vaguely to his crotch. “And you’re not ‘tapping’ me.”
Benny supported his head, made off key shushing noises and pressed the lip of a flask to Dean’s lips; “Go slow, don’t choke yourself.”
He curses bitterly under his breath and looks around, feels sweat prickling in the small of his back and puts a hand to it, breathes IN and pushes it out slowly, feels at the edges of the wound with his grace and focuses on it, tries to remember what he’d done to heal Sam but hard as he tries he can’t figure it out and all he manages to do is grow a headache.
Sam and the strawberry from the bar. Keys—Sputnik’s bath. Dean hasn’t slept well in two weeks. He’d taken his medication and found something about Klingons, he can’t remember really now, only that there wasn’t a case to occupy him and the Valerian root always knocked him on his ass when he was already tired, he—
“Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that, Chachi,” She shakes back her hair. “So, let’s be clear, shall we? You wanna rip your souls outta your bodies and take a little stroll through the spirit world?” She takes a seat and crosses one leg over the other, elbow on her knee and closes herself off from them.
Dean’s heart convulsed and he reached for the light, hoping the sudden plunge into darkness would ease the frantic feeling in his middle. He could still see Castiel’s edges, highlighted against the darkness of the room by the diffused light of the parking lot and the trickle through a crack in the bathroom door.
The room smelled like disinfectant and lilac, Dean knew the scent because there was a lilac bush growing near the office end of Bobby’s garage. It was a big thing with some branches broken out of it by the previous winter’s snows, but the blooms were gigantic and made the whole area smell floral and peaceful over the engine oil and spilled fuel.
Dean nodded, shook all over and nodded again. He didn’t stop shaking as Benny went back to bury the body. He thought it was owed in all honesty, didn’t want anything eating it when humanity—even vampires—were so keen on the idea of the body being the person.
Dean looks amused for all of ten seconds, contemplates turning the radio back on and ends up talking about the case instead. Something they can focus on that doesn’t have anything to do with Hell or the ‘whatever’ Dean had been dreaming about.
Her hands are cool and he can feel them, but the only ones he can see are those of her vessel, she touches—soothes, whispers into him of his courage, kneels with him in the ruin and presses her lips to his brow.
Behind her, Bobby was already digging in his cupboard for the scotch, then in a moment of self-awareness put it back and made coffee instead. “Maybe it wasn’t all John…” He stared at his hands while the coffee pot dripped. “Not like I was the best role model for them when they was here.”
“Sam, you’re in a wheelchair, that’s a pretty big difference than a bullet to the leg. I mean, can you even still handle it?”
He bit and scratched and fought because he is a wild thing now. He roared his terrible roar and gnashed his terrible teeth.
It took her twenty minutes in Bobby’s bathroom and her mother’s help to get her hair piled up onto her head in something resembling a business casual bun, and another ten for her to put on makeup that didn’t make her look like a twenty-something. “Less is more!” Ellen said, “You can wear eyeshadow and liner all you want when you’re being you, but when you’re playing a fed you gotta look like a fed!”
He doesn’t answer, stands up and walks—wrongwrongwrong—to the door, peers out and goes back to his chair. Sits and picks up the hatchet again. Continues sharpening it.
He wants to be sick, but can’t manage it, even when he does give up and shove some fingers in his mouth, all he ends up doing is scratching the back of his throat raw and contaminating his tongue with the phantom taste of grave dirt and rot and blood from his torn nails and knuckles.
Sam called Bobby and told him what had happened with Jimmy, he left out what had transpired between Castiel and Dean, instead told the older man they were going to cool off for a few days, watch the demonic omens and would check in by Friday.
Dean leans close over him and speaks slowly, carefully; “I don’t want you near it. This thing—“ His breath hitches, “This thing’s dangerous and I can’t focus on killing it if I have to worry where you are.”
The smell hits them first, bowel, blood, the usual, but the sight of the body—or really REMAINS of it, are a mess. Pieces really, lying in the bottom of the bag, some of the flesh is missing in places, others it is sagging and clinging on by tendon and bits of vein.
It has to be miles—He’s locked away in the center of the earth. He could claw and tear forever and never get—
Sam’s hand twitches on the sheet; “The angels aren’t going to stop until he says yes. They’re going to keep coming after me and Cas and you guys. You didn’t see him, Bobby, he was terrified… I-I’ve never seen him that scared before. Not since Alistair,” Sam’s jaw tightened like he was nodding, even though he couldn’t move his head and his voice came out muffled behind the oxygen mask; “I’m not going to let these bastards hurt my brother… I’m not going to let them use me to do it.”
Dean leaned forward and motioned to the dog with the flat of his hand; “Me and Cas go into some burger joint with her looking like that… People think things.”
“Just—“ Dean held up his hand plaintively; “Let me do it, I think you butting in last time is what made it so rough.”
They appeared in his periphery once more, Bobby closer to his feet, Ellen next to his head, Jo somewhere near Bobby’s elbow with her arms crossed and her face schooled into calm. Sam thought that just made it worse.
But Cas can. He looks right at Dean and his jaws tighten, eyes open and his own thoughts are plainly visible, almost as if Dean can hear them in return.
He made it to the edge of the yard and leaned his hips against a low rung in the horse fence. He peered out into the corral and saw the horse, Kia, shifting restlessly back and forth while a man in an off white hat brushed her down and stroked her neck, murmuring in an attempt to calm her.
Castiel set the wood to burning atop the altar in the middle of a circle surrounded by chunks of salt. Then he sat back on the cold concrete to watch it, seemingly intent upon staying right there to watch. Dean stood over him for a few moments, then went to finish his trap. He returned once the paint was dry and after a moment of staring at Castiel, sat beside him and balanced his arms on his knees.
He didn’t look away from the screen. Seemed intent for all the wrong reasons. “Dean seemed surprised that you’re a dominant sexual partner. I believe it has to do with his inability to emotionally separate himself from your similarities and see you as anything more than a younger sibling.”
She steps closer and he can feel her like a magnetic force, “I’ve been around Death from the get-go. You know what I see most?”
This pale, shivering human form dwarfed by blankets and bandages and a purpleblack bruise spanning the length of his face from temple to jaw on the left side. This sad creature that had spent forty years in hell and been raised to serve heaven—only to reject that destiny and strike off into uncharted territory  with only his wits, his failing physical health, his demon-infected little brother and a dog with short legs and an attitude problem.
Castiel looked up from his chocolate; “Old Enochian… It will require a few spell components. White ash from the burned wood of a thousand-year-old Jerusalem pine, blessed salt from the Dead Sea, Holy oil, water from a holy place, and rose hips.”
Sam draped Dean’s coat over his shoulder said he was going to shower because he was covered in goo, and when he came out Dean was fast asleep. The swelling had gone down considerably and Sam breathed out a sigh of relief as he pulled his shoes back on, paused in the door to just stare at the curl of Dean’s back and swallow down his own misgivings. This is right, I have to do this. He’s taken care of me his whole life, now I have to return the favor.
The scars. Cas had scars… He’d had his appendix out, he’d— The only scars Castiel has are the ones he got because of me. And my Cas didn’t have those. Dean ground his teeth, remembered that fizzPOP sensation transferred through him when Zechariah had shot Castiel, closed his eyes and saw the red dimple of scar tissue in the flesh above Castiel’s hip. The starburst of an exit wound and pinpricks of stitches.
Three AM there weren’t any police on the roads, especially on the stretches of interstate between state lines. It was a hard push, straight on ‘til morning, Peter Pan and all that bullshit. Sam sat with his face to the wind and a hand over his mouth watching the world spin by and only half listening to the shit on the radio. The engine didn’t sound the same. The difference between a Chevy and a Ford he supposed. It was too high pitched a whine. Too hitching a switch between gears. There was a squeak in the back end, probably a squealer on the breaks.
He tried once, and Sam had pulled his lips back from his teeth, eyes narrowed and filled with anger—his color had shifted, gone almost entirely black and lashed out at Dean like a battering ram. It had made his chest feel tight and his head ache.
He was on his back sleeping, Sputnik curled up on his discarded pants in the floor. She had her head lifted and turned to look Dean right in the face. Like maybe she could feel it too—
“We’re under the gas station. There is a storm drain large enough for the Xuphrek to have pulled Sputnik in.”
The camp sign had been spray painted. Someone thought it was funny to replace the ‘C’ in Chitaqua with an ‘S’.
Kelly had met her at the curb because the sky looked gray and fat like the neighbor’s tabby. Like it was going to rain cats and dogs all over, like Kelly said.
It’s a shitty old workshop set back from the road. The parking lot is a mess, cracked concrete with weeds waist high. Dean parks a ways back, walks in and watches through a window.
It was the art teacher, which Dean thought was a little humorous… until he stepped into the room and found himself looking up into twisted, grotesque faces hanging from clips on a metal drying grid.
“That’s because I just got hit by a minivan,” He opens the can and takes a slow drink, eases back in his seat stiffly and rubs a growing knot on the side of his head. Sputnik scratches at his ankle, looking for some sort of reassurance and Dean finally relents, drops his hand onto her head and scratches behind her nearest ear.
Dean gave a hard jerk and went absolutely limp, would have slid from his seat if Sam hadn’t put a hand on the back of his head to keep him in place.
Bobby was standing at the corner of the house stretching, eyed Sam evenly and spoke in a hushed tone; “Don’t let it get to you,” He turned his eyes back to the ground, using a can of old spray paint to make little marks here and there.
Cas is quiet looks at him as if he expects to be dismissed. Tries to keep from letting the feeling of rejection show on his vessel’s face. He’s not very good at it.
Bobby muttered and with a huff of effort and a hand pressed into the back bumper, pushed himself up and chucked the For Sale sign across the room like a Frisbee into the garbage can.
Sputnik doesn’t look away from Dean. Reluctantly she lets Bobby pick her up and carry her carefully outside to relieve herself, halfheartedly eats the noodles and chunks of chicken the older hunter had strained from the soup and the crusts he pinches from his bologna sandwich. But she doesn’t look away from Dean. Watches and worries.
Castiel looked up at him from the ground with sweat visible on his vessel’s brow, plunged two fingers into the glowing hole in his chest and began scrawling something messy in his own blood on the back fender of Bobby’s car.
Ruby turns and regards Dean where he’s trying to get his hands and knees under him. “I know this is hard to believe right now, Sam… But this is a miracle, so long coming. Everything Azazel did and Lilith did just to get you here… And you were the only one who could do it.”
The waiter, Castiel realizes his name is Justin and wonders why it took him so long to know this, brings over a tall glass of water with ice in it and a straw.
“Dean, Samhain is the damned origin of Halloween. Celts believed that October thirty-first was the one night of the year when the veil was thinnest between the living and the dead. It was Samhain’s night—I mean, masks were put on to hide from him. Sweets left on doorsteps to appease him, faces carved into pumpkins to worship him!” He licked his lips and flipped over a few pages to show Dean another image; “He was exorcised centuries ago.”
Jo and Ellen returned twenty minutes earlier than predicted. They were both dusted with graveyard dirt and neither of them smelled exactly ‘Fresh’ but Ellen smiled and presented a lumpy garbage bag at arm’s length. “One burial shroud of a lesser saint.”
All it took was two flares and the beast went up like kindling, lurched and with a loud POP went still. Everything would have been fine, but the sound of the flares scared the Xuphrek on Castiel’s shoulder and with a shriek it flung itself toward Rufus and wrapped around him warbling helplessly.
Dean focused on breathing and ran hot water in the sink cursed those damn cheap disposable razors hotels sometimes left in plastic sleeves and the fact that by noon tomorrow he was going to look like a fucking teenager.
“Okay,” She shifted back and drew him up into her arms, pulled him close and wished she were bigger or he smaller so she could wrap herself protectively around him and soak up all the pain like an amoeba or some shit, “Yeah, that’s gotta stop.”
Someone grabbed Sam’s chair and pulled him too fast in a tight circle and shoved him to the center of the stage again. The Mic was in his hand once more.
“I mean,” Dean tried to laugh it off, but it sounded forced and thin; “—Sam thought I was stupid, but I know my body. Straight fingers and no cavities I can overlook, but THAT. I mean, come on, did you think I wouldn’t notice?” He glanced over, then quickly away, expression switching from nervous humor to borderline panic. “It—uh—It helped. I didn’t know how until a couple weeks ago, but it helped. I don’t think I would have been able to—Just thanks, I guess.”
After a moment of staring stupidly Sam jerks into action, grabs a carving knife and lays Dean’s shirt and jacket open from the waist to the back of his neck carefully starts cutting toward the wound when he notices something—something that makes the chilled blood in his veins turn to fucking icewater.
“No wonder! You need to lay off the chicken nuggets, she’s getting pudgy. Dogs aren’t supposed to look like loaves of bread with feet, Dean. She’s supposed to have this—this DOG shape, yanno?”
And Jo spoke; “What about the pregnancy? Was it a normal pregnancy, or was there something strange?”
He bares his teeth, feels himself shaking and keeps one hand up, defensive, a barrier of sorts between himself and their grabby hands. “I’m fine… I—I need to make a phone call.”
Being the focus of Castiel’s stare wasn’t new, but it felt different. More unsettling. Dean climbed to his feet and went back into the kitchenette, came back with a bowl of soup and a spoon. Held them out wordlessly until Castiel sighed and levered himself up to sit against the headboard.
Dean pushed his chin up and gestured vaguely in front of him, made a rolling motion with one extended finger; “Yeah-yeah, they’re related to tricksters… Spirits that can control the minds of infected animals… it’s like a bite, isn’t it?”
demons—“ His breath shudders in and out; “And it scares the hell outta me that you…” He gestures toward Sam’s chest with a mirthless chuckle and turns away rubbing his sleeve over his face.
Dean shrugged one shoulder toward his ear; “Not really. Happened once to me when I was twenty-two in Florida… This old house that’d been turned into an apartment building, classic haunting. Had a good story behind it too, previous owner of the house died in the lower bedroom—suffocated by her nurse. Cold spots, rustling in the walls, furniture moving, shadows, pet cat freaking out in the middle of the night for no reason. Turned out it was shitty duct work and a nine foot ball-python named Jinx that the upstairs neighbor forgot to mention had escaped from its enclosure,” He turned and gave Jo’s look of horror a wide eyed nod; “Oh, yeah. One thing my dad and me had in common—Hate snakes—HATE snakes.”
“It’s OK, we’ll figure this out,” Benny rinsed the wounds again with holy water. There was no bubbling this time, hadn’t been in a few days, but one could never be too careful. The strip of Dean’s shirt he’s using as a rag is black red with gore, streaked every so often with bits of puss and tissue.
Dean watches her as she moves around the room, pulls on a jacket and shoves her feet into her shoes. She gives him a Look before she leaves but if she notices the lingering redness of his eyes or the paleness of his mouth she doesn’t say anything.
“You could have sex again, Dean… Satisfying sex, not like that pathetic display with Jamie, or that guy at the bar? Dean…” He shakes his head. “He could erase all that. He could make you whole again.”
There were no lights on in the room but the images Castiel had shoved into his brain like a sharpened stick, were very clear. Dean and Sam were in there.
Sam’s snoring, is sprawled on his back in his own too small bed with his head tilted back and his lips parted. It’s a dry irritating sound and Dean throws a pillow at him—“Shuddup,” And he flops onto his side and pulls his legs up tight, worried… What if someone had seen—what if he’d been making noises.
He pulls open Sam’s shirt but there is no wound, just a growing bruise low on his abdomen from the internal trauma. His torso seems strangely twisted. It’s barely perceptible but Dean’s brain latches on, screams WRONGWRONGWRONG in his mind like an air raid siren.
Sam finds him a few minutes later crouched outside in the confines of the Milligan’s back yard tossing a ball toward the fence for Sputnik to chase. She’s been as uncomfortable as he has been though for entirely different reasons most likely.
The angel looks like he pities him again, or envies his ignorance; “Three days ago, you thought there was no such thing as me… You thought I was impersonating a fantasy you created while a gluttonous djinn waited to feed on you.”
Bill grew quiet, face hardened, but his truck kept up, stayed two car lengths behind the Impala as they drove.
Dean knew in his chest that Castiel’s new boots were ruined, you never really could get the smell out of them once they’d gotten completely soaked, and they jogged in front of Bobby back to the room, leaving wet footprints in their wake, hoping the hotel manager hasn’t seen what they’ve done.
He looks at her and something in his eyes is frightened and angry and desperate for release. “Would it work?”
Dean had never been comfortable being at the mercy of a stranger. He muttered discontentedly to Sputnik as he pulled the Impala into the work bay. He rolled up the windows and made sure all the doors were locked, and stared around the work area for signs of the cat. There was a large litter box in the corner, a spluttering air conditioner in the far window and a scattering of mauled cat toys leading into the old office. Sputnik rumbled low in her throat, head lowered, nose pointed toward the office and Dean had the urge to bend down and scratch behind her ears encouragingly.
“I’ll talk to him tonight and I’ll give you an answer Tuesday… So he’ll have a few days to think about it.”
It's not easy, but he gets the knife away and shoves the other man toward the den, brandishes it and bares his teeth threateningly; “Alright, if I was either, could I do this, with a silver knife?” He pulls his sleeve up, keeping his eyes on Bobby’s—A sick twist in his chest makes him hesitate, stare at the unmarred flesh of his inner arm—he knows this feeling, knows the way the blade SINGS as it finds blood—he swallows bile and presses it in. Lets the blood drip and watches Bobby’s expression closely.
Dean sighed, took another bite of the bacon; “I didn’t know what was going on—I come through those doors right into the middle of Jerry Springer doing a ‘Confrontation’ episode between me, and a creepy realistic looking Lilith—I almost had a panic attack then everything went black for a little bit and suddenly the Trickster’s got me by the neck shakin’ the hell outta me and asking ‘What’d you do!’. And I get a good up close look at him and—” He gave his head a shake; “All I saw was the hands. I didn’t see any wings or-or—” He makes a gesture encircling his head, “—Like you’ve got, Cas, but I knew. I felt it. And I—I guess I panicked a little.”
Bobby shoved into the room, grabbed Sam around the chest and hauled him back before the blade made contact.
Dean could feel the anxiety rolling off of her. The fear. She disappeared inside and Jay held the door open for them, “Make yourselves at home.”
Tabitha cackled and Bill leaned over the fence to give Dean a hand up since Castiel was occupied with the other dogs, seemed to be maintaining a group conversation with them. Dean shook his head and, seeming to shake himself free of his shock, fished in his pocket and handed Tabitha what he had in loose bills.
“First,” Dean pulls a napkin out of the dispenser and starts folding it into tinier and tinier squares, just for something to do with his hands. “It’s not your fault… I—if I’m honest with myself, I really don’t think he was going to help us, even if we—even if I hadn’t stabbed him. Little dude’s gotta be playing bitch to someone. He’s an angel, right? So, he’s gotta be on someone’s side. I don’t blame you for him taking off. That’s on him. We tried, I screwed up, and it didn’t work out… so we move on to plan B.”
“Three? Yeah, she could have up to twelve…” She snorted out a laugh and turned toward Bobby, “Dog’s nesting in Dean’s suitcase.”
“All I had to do was say ‘yes’ and he woulda stopped, but I can’t—I don’t want him touching me. He’s got no right—NO RIGHT. ‘s my body and they can’t have it! They can’t have it—”
Castiel cranked his window down and stuck his head out; “The demon’s moving—We’re not going to make it in time!”
“Hey—Hey!” Sam’s voice was still low, half volume, and he waved a hand beseechingly at Dean’s elbow, but didn’t touch… He didn’t touch. “Inside voice, okay?”
Sam shakes his head, can’t stop shaking it, covers his face because he doesn’t want this stranger to see him like this.
“Don’t even kid about that, you asshole,” Jo took a sip of the coffee and aimed a halfhearted kick at Dean’s behind as he shuffled into the bathroom to change.
“Jesus,” Craig goes about wiping the mess off the table, shifts the tray aside and pockets Sam’s phone without notice; “Don’t worry about the meal, sir… Just—Shit, I’ve got some khakis and a polo in the back if you wanna change. I’m real sorry about this.”
When Dean wakes from his second nightmare he remembers James in college. They laughed and joked and told funny dirty stories. James moved away, they don’t talk much anymore. Dean doesn’t really like him much but he brought Dean the dog to help, to keep him safe, so he can’t be all bad, no matter what his memories tell him.
He snorted; “Well, it sure as hell wouldn’t hurt anything,” He curled an arm around his waist and focused on his shoes, the flecks of mud on his toes butted up against the instep of Castiel’s.
The last time he’d been at the hospital they’d weighed him. He hadn’t been able to look. He’d never really been LEAN, not in the way Sam was, just bone and sinewy muscle. Dean could admit he liked his cheeseburgers and his beer, but the softness of his waist had never slowed him down—But now there wasn’t much softness of his waist. Now he could feel his hipbones until recently he’d been able to see the stack of his ribs and the knobs of his spine, so it was a little surprising, standing there staring at the dial on the scale—to see it had ticked upward a little. It—it was nice. Maybe he was beating this thing.
“Oh,” He turns and faces Dean, smiles a little, like he thinks this is just too precious. “Aren’t you a surprise.”
Sputnik yawns and Dean glances down at her, how she’s looking up at the stranger like she knows him, tail thumping slowly.
“Well that’s comforting,” Sam wondered if Dean just hadn’t told Bobby about the blackness… or if he’d lied about it.
“I’ve had sex, Sam. You remember Jamie? Five times, Man. FIVE TIMES!” He stared out the window with his shoulders hunched.
Anna hugs her knees to her chest; “Maybe everything’s gone wrong because I just don’t deserve to be saved.”
Sputnik, however, seemed to know. Be it her sense of smell, or just something dogs knew, like when food hit the floor, or when you would look away from the plate on your lap long enough that they could grab something and run.
“This is your Ebenezer Scrooge moment. I’m just the angel of Christmas Future… So, take your time, enjoy the—
Dean didn’t want to wake up. He didn’t want to move—he wasn’t even sure he wanted to be alive. “Aw, shit—“ He rolled off the edge of the bed slowly, onto his hands and knees, head bowed.
The Other Dean squints back, “You’re not a shifter. Shifters are brown at the edges, just like ghouls and revenants. You’re not a demon because you don’t have a color and the only one who doesn’t have a color is me, so. It’s kind of a process of elimination… That and you didn’t react to anything.”
Where’d it all gone? There was like—five pounds of… He hiccupped and turned to stare down at the mess in the floorboard and across the passenger seat.
Yes, there had been men and women to oppose heaven before, but they were ‘brought around’ eventually, or crushed beneath angelic heels.
Sputnik makes a low ‘woof’ sound and Dean rolls his eyes and flicks his tongue over his bottom lip; “That’s Sputnik.”
Sam’s mouth and voice worked without his control. He had never felt anything so eerie, or so completely violating. Even being possessed years ago had had some kind of reason to it. This simply and inevitably was and it was terrifying; “S-Samuel John Winchester.”
Dean pushed to his feet, one hand on his hip, the other on the back of his neck, “We just gotta find out where it’s taken these people and exorcise it back to Hell. It’s that simple.”
“Even a human with a weapon of that magnitude could cause unimaginable destruction. You can’t do this. If the demons got hold of something charged with grace, Dean, they could warp it. They could find a way to kill angels with it.”
The hatchet hits the floor and The Other’s chair clatters back he stands so quickly. “Zechariah brought you here?” He doesn’t give Dean time to answer, stabs a finger at the ground and raises his voice so it shakes the air in Dean’s sinuses; “You call that son of a bitch down here right now!”
Two days later a group of Demons attack them in a gas station in Iowa, they manage to get away, but one of them, the leader it seemed, took a wide-armed swipe at Dean’s back as they fled and when Sam finally caught his breath in the car as they sped away he saw the woman shaped Demon standing there in the parking lot with a handful of something. He thought it was the back of Dean’s shirt but when he made his brother lean forward his clothes were intact.
Rufus let out a huff of air and hefted the box onto the bed by Bobby’s knees; “You want the good news or the bad news first?”
Sam took the book when Dean offered it, read over the entry for himself and called Bobby’s contact, some man named Ramirez, to relay the message. The man said a quick thank you and Sam said to call back if he needed anything else.
Perhaps it’s the fact he chooses not to resort to vulgarities that makes the message hit home. Dean has a wide vocabulary of expletives, he could easily have used any number of them, but he didn’t. He wants Castiel to know this. He wants this to HURT.
Pain sliced through his heart and Castiel’s breath shuddered with it, face contorting. He turned away, felt Dean shifting to sit on the far edge of the bed, discretely rubbing his face with wide palms. Shoulders trembling as he fought to chase away the crawling sick feeling under his skin.
Sam went upstairs and got her, brought her down and sat there beside his brother until it was over. Nothing big, nothing dramatic like he was so afraid would happen. Just dizziness and an overwhelming weak trembling in Dean’s limbs. Sam helps him up onto the cot because Dean’s limbs just won’t hold him and ignores the grumbling when he shakes a blanket over his brother’s shoulders, then takes a seat in the floor by the bed and finds the pulse point in Dean’s nearest wrist.
Sam nodded, looked down and caught the dog following Dean around looking up with such a worried expression on her face. Like she didn’t understand what was going on.
And Dean feels his stomach try to escape through his nose. He steps forward with his eyes wide, heart beating swiftly; “What are you talking about?”
Dean took him to Physical Therapy the next morning. He met Ellen in the hall as she was waking and said he would do it, to rest. She’d been handling Sam’s care since the beginning, she deserved to relax. She put her hands on Dean’s face and met his eyes, tired and relieved and fed up; “He needs you… He needs you more than any of us.”
Benny peered at him over the lenses of his sunglasses; “Why scream, you got a phone? Look, if I was gonna hurt you why would I have bothered to pull that car of Dean’s outta the snow? It was an inconvenience not to mention cold— And what the hell are you two doin’ out in a goddamn blizzard with a rear-wheel-drive? ‘slike you wanna crash and burn,” He turned and placed Sam’s knife on his dashboard. Swatted at his clawing hand like it was an annoying fly. "Dean told me you had a temper, but I wasn't expecting this... You gonna keep tryin to scratch my eyes out? Or can we talk like civilized people."
Castiel exhales, sounds like one of those haggard school teachers who are about thirty seconds away from yelling at their students. “The risk outweighs the benefit here. A weapon like that can harm more than just demons. In the wrong hands it could
“I was dreaming,” He rubbed his eyes on his wrist; “I mean, I was doing that thing—while I was dreaming.”
Dean finds a shape shifter in Pensacola that’s nabbing women off the street and strangling them to death. Video surveillance shows the guys eyes flaring white, as he drags his third blonde off into an alleyway. Dean can guess what comes next, the shifter takes her form, leaves her body naked in a dumpster and empties her bank accounts.
“You simpering wad of insecurity and self-loathing?” Zechariah takes a step back and rubs his fingers together as if trying to rid them of some greasy discharge. “No… You’re just a human, Dean. And a pathetic one at that.”
Sam sometimes picked, poked and prodded trying to get some kind of reaction from Dean, tried to draw him out of the silences but all he was doing was pushing Dean farther in.
Uriel’s eyebrows lift and he tilts his head forward then back imperiously; “Now, you mind your tone with me.”
Castiel waited until Dean climbed behind the wheel before he gave directions. Had Dean pull across the street to the gas station and sidle the car up to the ATM on the corner.
The dog jogs past them and roots around in the basket by the fireplace for a toy and retires to her cushion in the corner.
Sam exhaled slowly; “It’s not that… There are. I—There could be a hint of what happened to Dean in here, Bobby and I—“
“Just think for a minute… Lilith is a white-eyes. You can hurt her the same way you hurt Alastair in Union.”
Dean didn’t answer, and a moment later felt Castiel brush his mind, felt words and images popping into existence between his thoughts.
Sam thinks he should probably restrict his brother’s TV watching privileges when he’s concussed. He takes the cloth from Dean and wraps it around the ice, hands it back and watches while Dean folds it around his head like a kid might do a security blanket.
Dean glanced at him while he pawed through his clothes, looked away, and back again. “Okay,” He shook out a t-shirt from the pack and shrugged it on quickly. “We need to get a few things straight.”
Dean scoffed and looked up with watery eyes. He didn’t say anything but it was clear that he was no more interested in punching Chuck than he was in playing football at the moment. He nodded and Castiel vanished with a sound like a whipping flag in a storm gale.
“I s-SAW THEM! They were so ANGRY! They w-were h-hurting you!” His hands tangled in Dean’s t-shirt and he hid his face in Dean’s throat, coughed loudly and snuffed back the wetness in his nostrils; “They’re coming!”
Dean dropped his spoon onto the tabletop, little spatters of coffee followed it; “I meant does anything jump out at you as not natural?”
Dean swallows; “It hurt when you just touched it, OK? Imagine how it felt for him to—to do that to me.”
“I did it to keep your soul from shattering. If you can manage to learn to control it, the grace will be very beneficial to you.”
“Alastair… he was grinnin’ at me, then—“ He lets one knee sag toward the edge of the bed, a futile attempt to roll over; “Lights out.”
Dean went to brush his teeth when he came back out Castiel was dozing on his bed and the doctor show from the night before was back on. Something about a ‘best of’ marathon in preparation for the next season. Dean spent three hours cleaning his weapons and bundling his new underwear, socks and t-shirts together and if by the end of those three hours he had begun to fantasize about cowboy boots nobody was the wiser.
He pulls down his face mask about halfway down the passenger side and watches his brother and the dog. Sam’s getting tired, but Sputnik is excited, is guiding the ball with one shoulder and her open mouth, snarling and yapping excitedly as she runs with it because she’s too small to actually get her teeth into it.
Thirty minutes later they’re on the road again and Dean’s slumped in the passenger seat with one hand over his eyes fighting to breathe through nausea and an increasing razor like pain in his head. Sam gets them to the hotel without incident and Dean only puts up a token protest when he feels Sam’s big hand catch his elbow to keep him upright.
Once he’s dressed Dean is surprised to see Rufus waiting outside with Sputnik sitting by his heel, he’s pushed out in a wheelchair and the woman—Chloe—stops when Dean looks up and speaks. Dean has no idea where Rufus came from or why he’s there. He wrinkles his nose at the older man and asks in a snarl of a voice; “What the hell?”
They go through a drive-thru for a late lunch/early dinner because Sam had sent him a message that said he was having canned ravioli and he’d better find a burger wrapper or something in the floorboard when Dean got back.
“I’m trying to stop this, Sam. I’m trying to HELP you—“ She stomps over and flattens her palms to either side of his face, forces his head up and his eyes to meet hers; “Have I don’t anything— ANYTHING— to make you think I was trying to obsess you!”
Dean rubs his forehead and tries not to breathe through his nose because he’s sure the smell from Fifteen is still all over his clothes and part of him wants to take a long LONG shower and scrub himself with a fucking brillo pad because he feels vaguely slimy.
Sputnik was dancing again, round and round and round. Sam was laughing at her behind his hand, obviously enjoying it. Dean kind of wanted to pick her up just so she’d hold still. All the movement of her, the wiggling dumpy presence of her near him was making his heart race.
“That thing? You think it’s gonna find God?” He rocks back in his seat a little like he’s been slapped. “It’s supposed to give you psychic dreams—“
Dean wet his lips, settled his jaw on his arms and shrugged; “I’m not just gonna sit on my ass and wait to die. I may not have a chance of winning, but I guarantee by the time we’re done they’ll remember us. They’ll remember we put up one hell of a fight. That we didn’t fight because it was ‘Divine Plan’ or ‘Fate’ or all that bullshit, but because we CHOSE to.”
“You're you! You're, Cas! You-you're smart! And kind of dumb. You know all these rituals that we can't find in books–“
He gets out. It isn’t easy, not by any means, but he gets out. Has to climb down off the damned crypt and run back to the car.
“Siafu Ants are some of the most vicious in the world… When their colonies march anything that tries to oppose them is killed and eaten to the bones. Bulldog Ants are responsible for many deaths in Australia every year and Bullet Ants release a neurotoxin in their sting that causes excruciating pain for upwards of twenty-four hours and can be lethal if one is stung in large numbers.”
Dean blinks at him, slightly curious, slightly appalled; “Okay… So, you understand what I mean when I say that I
“There is no other way,” Castiel said, the tone of his voice was gentle, but there was power behind it.
He crouches there for a long while, passing his palms, both ethereal and physical, over Dean’s back and head, ventures as low as his hips for a moment but doesn’t linger. It’s a delicate process healing Dean. If he presses too hard with his grace Dean’s will react defensively and fight against him. He has to go slowly until Dean accepts what he’s doing. It’s not likely to happen while the human is barely conscious, but it’s possible so he doesn’t relent.
It’s a strange thing, fleeting—but Dean finds himself reaching out to her and there is a brief connection, a ZAP like static electricity between his fingers and a doorknob. There are no words, but the way his heart beats faster is familiar, the urge he feels from her is known.
His prickly jaw clenches and he seems to shake, the energy he gives off shakes with him and Dean, for a second, feels crushed by it, feels like he may just be squeezed to death by it… But then Castiel speaks and the words pull that flicker in his eyes up and out and it burns itself a place in the angel’s eyes, burns itself a home and Dean knows the face of it.  “I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore… Whether you passed or failed here,” His lips compress.
“So, you started workin’ here three weeks ago? Yeah, me too,” he exhales and gropes for his briefcase, drags it closer and fishes out the little blue bottle of vitamins he keeps beside his laptop. Funny, they seem to help more than any of his prescriptions. He catches Sam staring as he swallows it down without water and shakes the bottle emphatically; “Just vitamins, it’s not illegal or anything.”
The sound is loud, too loud and the smell of gun powder is nigh overwhelming but Sam does as he’s told, tries not to hear Dean shouting his name.
His lungs still burned and the coughing was more painful as time went on, but he ignored it. The sound of his own breathing and coughing was less bothersome than the static on the radio.
Dean grinds his teeth, pretends, puts on a brave face because that’s all he knows to do. “What? Not confident I can kick my own ass?”
The Yellowshirt gets on the elevator again as Dean and the dog are leaving for the day. The kid looks tense and that automatically makes Dean tense. It’s not fair really. He’d been having a good day… mostly, Julia notwithstanding. Now there’s this too tall guy with his stupid hair and his long arms and his weirdly familiar face.
Dean shivers, feels the air temperature drop suddenly like he’s taken an arctic plunge. He half expects vengeful spirits, but there is nothing. Just the distant rumble of thunder and a soft pattering of rain on leaves.
What kind of life is Sam going to have, confined to a wheelchair or a bed, most of the world inaccessible and unsympathetic. What happens now? They can’t run away from this. There will be no quick escape out a side entrance and a few days nursing bruises and gauze covered in blood then a quick escape down another stretch of highway filled with more monsters. This—Dean takes a deep breath and leans his hips against a soggy picnic table toward the end of the lot under a maple with small leaves sprouted on it—is not something they can get away from.
Everything grates on his nerves. His skin feels too sensitive, like when he’d had chicken pox and everything that touched him had just feel like fucking sandpaper, every noise bit through his head like a chainsaw and the light hurt his face—not just his eyes, his whole face. Burned like a goddamned lazer. But he hadn’t been able to lie down and wallow in his misery then, no, because Sammy was sick too and wanted to be cuddled. Sam had wanted Dean to make him soup and oatmeal baths and rub his back and Dean had just wanted to curl up and die. Maybe it was his own fault they’d been so bad, maybe it hadn’t been. Who cares. All Dean knows is that now it feels like every nerve has been set aflame and the very weight of the air is unpleasant.
“Hey, Bobby?” He picked up one of the bottles littered around the computer; “What’s the deal with the liquor store? Hmm? Your parents outta town or somethin’?”
Ellen looks like she wants to touch him, to shush and say ‘don’t push yourself’ but he has to. That’s his new reality, the PUSH. She breathes deep and flexes her fingers; “We’re looking. We’ll find a way to fix it and if we can’t then we’ll deal with it. You’re alive, that’s all that matters,” After a moment she lets out a sigh; “The things you boys get into…” She loses her battle and pushes her fingers through his hair. “Jesus, you’re cold. These folks ever heard of a blanket?”
Dean sidles up to the opposite side of the table and motions with what he’s got in his hand; “Who was that?”
“It’s after this little girl from Newton Elementary. It’s on Sixth and Pueblo. I only got mental images, but it was enough.”
“Hell, I don’t know,” Bobby says from his desk, “Mighta done him some good. Best sleep I’ve got since I was a kid.”
The car came from nowhere, engine roaring and Dean saw the impact, saw her little body bend to the side unnaturally in a shower of molasses colored fluid and broken glass. Then she—the car, everything exploded—tore the very fabric of reality around her, and let DARKNESS pour in.
Dean hadn’t seen Sam’s stomach or back since New York, and then it had been covered in bandages. Seeing Sam change was startling. Maybe it was because Sam was used to Ellen being there and Ellen had seen it, maybe this was Sam’s way of reaching out with a little trust, but seeing the scar running the length of his brother’s abdomen and a plastic medical bag taped to his side made Dean stop and stare a little. Seeing that red line running from the back of Sam’s shoulders to the small of his back where the surgeons had put steel rods in made Dean ache in his bones. He knew it would make Sam uncomfortable, so he turned away again quickly, but he had seen it. Knew by the hitch in the sound of Sam’s movements, and the sudden electric tension in the air, that his attention had been noticed.
Dean meets his brother’s eyes. They both know what kind of power it would take to do something like that.
It’s weird really, thinking that what’s bothering Castiel isn’t something incredibly deep or epic or philosophical. It’s merely the fact that he doesn’t know a definite and until that moment his whole world had been nothing but definitives. Absolutes with no exception, black and white, good and evil. And suddenly… inexplicably and against all reason there was this gray area. This single thread of unease. Castiel was afraid because there was no definitive answer to the question not that the answer itself was questionable.
“Okay,” Castiel said and stroked a hand awkwardly over Dean’s head. He pressed their brows together and gripped him with his non-physical hands. Refusing to let go. Pulling Dean in protectively against his heart even if there was almost two feet of space between them.
Dean didn’t know he was standing until Ellen gripped his arms and pulled him down into a hug. “You’re nothin’ but skin and bones—“
Chuck looks up at him with a dumb expression on his face; “Did you really have to live through the bugs?”
Dean rubbed the side of his face, using his palm as a physical barrier between himself and the angel. “As long’s you stay,” He almost regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth. He hadn’t meant to speak them. Feeling them was one thing, he’d learned how to shut his thoughts out of the link he shared with Castiel, for the most part. But speaking? Why was it that Castiel could make him talk? Just by sitting there with that dumb concerned look on his face. How could he make Dean talk without even knowing his lips were moving?
His brows pull down and he glances over his shoulder where Dean can see the Other lying there, eyes glazed, still and gone ashen in death. He feels sick—remembers seeing his own corpse as the hellhounds had dragged him away and wants to vomit.
He closed the windows and sat there with his hands clenched into fists on the tabletop, stared and let his breath shake in his chest as he opened the window again and started paging through the forums, more because he didn’t know what else to do than with any hope of finding something that would help.
He scratches bloody lines into the skin of his arms and grinds his teeth until his head hurts, scratches his scalp and in a fit of spitefulness throws the glass of orange juice Bobby had brought for him with breakfast across the room, satisfied when it shatters against the far wall.
Sam stands there in the doorway with his mouth hanging open and his eyes wide in horror because all he can see in that moment is something OTHER. Something NOT HUMAN wearing his brother’s face.
Sputnik yawned and stretched in the front seat, bedded down with her head on Dean’s jacket, smacking her lips until she’d settled again.
He nodded, heaved a few deep breaths and focused on the boy’s footprints, followed them out into the hall, splashes of color from his brother and sister, his parents—Dean pushed past them, lingered longer than he should on the warmth of their love and happiness, found himself seeming to float, a guest behind the echo, along for the ride. Faster and faster images passed behind his eyes. Running and playing, games and talking with girls. School and science fairs, friends and first kisses. Dean pulled back farther and farther, like a rocket shooting off into the stratosphere, he saw a shimmering pattern, intricate and dazzling like lace, or Christmas lights seen from space, the lasting impact TK had left on the world—
In Hell he’d had a stick… But he hadn’t cared what he’d maimed with it, as long as he wasn’t the one on the pointy end.
“Okay,” He pulled in a deep lungful of air and let it out, let his eyes fall closed and didn’t flinch when Castiel’s grace echoed with his decision. “Okay.”
The lights fizz and pop and grow impossibly bright as her temper flares. Her rage changes her, paints dark circles under her eyes and pulls her skin taut on her features. Changes her from some cute girl-next-door into a revenge obsessed ghost.
Dean’s jaw clenched and he turned off the stove burner with a rough twist of the dial. Left the sauce pan sitting there simmering and approached the bed. Sat at Castiel’s hip and stared down at him. “Why do you wanna mix yourself up in this? Do you know what I’d do to be able to turn all this shit off?” He folded his hands together and tightened his fingers.
It’s quick. Just a little flash of dull olive green around the man and a stab of pain behind Dean’s eyes—He puts his hand to his forehead and grinds his teeth, Sam glances at him, but back to Chuck when the man starts talking quickly.
Sputnik was wiggling in Dean’s arms, tail thumping as Chad continued to talk about her ‘little face’ or ‘little feets’. The more he talked, the more excited she got. Dean finally had enough of her struggling and sat her on the concrete, felt moderately betrayed when she waddled over to the other man and put her paws on his knee so he could shove both hands into her fur and vigorously scratch. He found a spot on her chest just below her collar, and as he scratched, her rear left leg started thumping.
Sam feels his mouth pull back into a grin, feels it bubble up from somewhere behind his stomach, deep in the dark bitter pit that swallowed everything he’s been trying to sew shut since he was a kid but now seems to run over and split larger at the edges in want of what he’s filled it with; “You have no idea.”
Castiel sees her human body, doesn’t even recognize her without the burn of her grace in his vision until she is standing at his side and Uriel is dead.
Castiel flinched. Dean couldn’t see it, but he felt it in his chest. Like a fist knocking on his ribs. He hefted his bag higher on his shoulder and started walking.
Ancient crumbling railroad ties stacked nearby made Dean think that perhaps, this town had been a hub of some sort for ranchers transporting cattle. The rusting corral fences lying in twisted heaps amid scrub brush and dead weeds made a perfect hiding place for snakes and bees, Dean endeavored to stay away from them. He pulled the Impala into one of the building’s gaping entrances, headlights turned low enough to illuminate his path, but not alert the authorities who might, infrequently from the amount of graffiti, abandoned clothing, and crumpled condom wrappers—patrol the area. It looked kind of like the place a djinn would call home, dilapidated and musty, full of pigeon poop and ancient rusted machinery.
“No. He's alive, I just... I can’t tell you over the phone. Just know that it’s bad, but he can’t go to a hospital.”
He looked like he was going to spout something sarcastic, or something that played at Dean's emotions enough to piss him off. But, he hesitated, looked the human in the face and couldn't find the energy to lie about it.
Dean paces back and forth for a little while, tries to identify every talisman painted on the walls and decides watching Bobby work was less boring so he leans his hips against the table covered in his weapons and waits.
He pinched the fire from the joint and flicked it out the window into a puddle, held his breath for a few seconds too long and exhaled, smoke wreathed around his face and the firefly flicker of his too blue eyes within it.
It was stunning, to realize Dean needed something that Sam wasn’t capable of giving him. Not by any fault of his own, but simply by virtue of Sam being too close to the situation. Too close to Dean.
Dean let out a snort; “Riviting… Julia Wright was possessed the whole pregnancy. Conception to birth.”
It was small, and not at all what Dean thought it would be. The Xuphrek in the bucket back at the hotel had been white, this one had been coal black with inky eyes and a body that was definitely dog shaped. His immediate thought was a dog with tentacles but he hadn’t noticed the creature in time to find its head.
He speaks slowly, carefully, like dictating to a child, his expression is sedately curious, just a crinkle of his brow. He seems intrigued by whatever he’s seen in Dean’s head; “Castiel.”
The guy with the gun was wild eyed, pulled the brunette’s hair and tore her blouse, but finally relented, the doctor went back to his surgery and the police dragged the gunman away.
Elk Creek was much like Alliance, small, seemingly untouched. Julia Wright lived in a small chipped white house amid an overgrown yard behind spike tipped iron fences and hand painted ‘No Trespassing’ signs. Nine of them in all.
“My friend and I work for Literature Weekly. We’re doing an article and wondered if you would mind answering some questions about the work of Carver Edlund?”
“Wouldn’t he?” Cas leans forward, meets Dean’s eyes and speaks carefully; “We left him, Dean. You and I just left that morning. We didn’t say goodbye, we didn’t go back. We were going to find God and we didn’t let anything distract us… Then the morning after Oakland you called him, said it was best if you stayed apart , that Zechariah would only use you against one another… So that’s just what we did. We didn’t talk to him or Bobby or Ellen or Jo again. Think of what that did to him. He’s alone and he’s hurt and you’re off chasing God instead of helping him. Everybody has a breaking point, Dean. Everyone. You should know that better than most—“
The storm got bigger, and louder the later it got and fear of the man in the dark coat grew. Sarina had heard the news woman talking about a man in a black coat, when Momma and Daddy thought she was asleep. Daddy said the building’s Super had put new locks on the windows in January and the security lock was still on the door from when Sarina had been sleep walking last year. It would go off if someone tried to come in after it was set.
She glanced at him, slightly uncomfortable, then glanced back at the TV. “Look, it’s none of my business, but, what are you and Dean doing?”
He chokes on his own blood, feels it frothing in the back of his throat where one of them had gnawed his lungs—can feel it bubbling out of the wounds. For a little while he can smell himself, smell the spilled contents of his stomach and bowels the acidic burn of bile on soft tissues. He believes that it’s over then, that it can’t be worse. This is Death, the end—the absolute.
Realization struck her like lightening and for a moment she almost wanted to look away, felt as if she were invading on something private. She’d seen Dean relieved before, and on the other end of the spectrum, she’d seen Dean relieved over Sam. This was something different. Intense and unrestrained like she’d never known Dean was capable of. It was softer than his relief over Sam, less likely to make them both fly apart and destroy something, but in the same moment stronger.
Dean saw a blur from the corner of his eye, something black and white with icy blue eyes and the next second Sputnik was a wild thing at the end of her lead, barking and wriggling all over, practically choking herself in an attempt to get at whatever that thing was—
“Yep,” Guy stuffed his hands into his pockets and Dean caught sight of the vintage Sigfreid and Roy t-shirt, complete with the white tigers and matching shirts.
the things to slip past the goalie— And isn’t that just absolutely fucked up—Jesus Christ I think I’m gonna puke.
Dean thinks his knees may give out, focuses on his heart beating and keeping it even and slow, not the prickle in his sinuses; “Good,” He walks around the desk, “Wait, what do you mean ‘as far as you know’?”
“You can’t just go off hunting ghosts without some kind of contingency plan, Sam. You can’t put your life on the line like this without health insurance!”
Dean rolled his eyes but couldn't concieve of letting go; “This isn't a 'sole purpose' thing. It's not like anything else we've been through before. Gabe didn't bring you back just because Jack needed you to do something, or because I need you to do something. He brought you back because Jack is frickin' god now, and he learned everything he knows from
Dean swallowed convulsively; “I…” He looked around, noticed a few people had come out of their houses with flashlights and were heading over slowly, warily. He felt his skin crawling, mind overloaded by all the smears of soul color and the very living thrum of the earth beneath him. “I need to lie down.”
Sam shakes his head, he’s glad Dean’s taken a new interest in food, really he is. But he’s pretty sure Dean’s put on about five pounds since Canonsburg and gone through at least that many bottles of scotch. He seems to constantly have a candied alcohol smell about him now and Sam knows trading a blooming eating disorder for flat out alcoholism isn’t any healthier.
Dean shivered, could feel the warm brush of intent in each touch. The gentling and shift of pressure until Castiel was tracing each muscle structure of his shoulders and neck and Dean found his head butted against the angel’s abdomen, head enveloped with the scent of him. Soap and laundry detergent and the melting candy in his pants pocket.
He shudders in relief, nods and stands there for a few seconds more just relishing in the pressure, in the solidity of Castiel before he steps back rubbing his face dry and muffling a cough into his fist.
It bubbles up like vomit and Sam can’t keep it in anymore, tightens his hands into fists on his knees and wrinkles up his nose in disgust; “You fucking hypocrite… I’m SAVING people, Dean. That guy—“ He points toward the door, “I saved his life!”
Julia from PR is out back smoking a cigarette when Dean takes the dog for her afternoon walk the next day. She smiles asks how his department’s doing, if there’s any news on the Pierpont venture. Dean smiles and says it’s a hole in one, for sure. She blows smoke at him playfully and asks what he’s doing Friday, maybe he’d like to go check out this little Greek place she’s fond of.
Castiel’s hands stop below his shoulder blades and smooth out toward his sides. “You can’t,” His voice sounds sad.
Sleeping though, may not have been the best idea he’s ever had. Not tonight. He knew that within two seconds of the dream starting. Knew before that really, because when did things ever go right? He tried to wake himself, fought and twisted and screamed at himself to WAKE UP, but he couldn’t. Maybe he wasn’t really asleep at all.
“Uh—I’m” He peered around, forced air between his lips to keep the soap bubbles dribbling down his face away from his mouth. “Uh—There’s a big parrot and a really big black cat-thing—nice kitty—Is it trained? It—it’s not gonna like, come after me is it?”
“I’m so glad he finally convinced you to come!” Janie tipped her head to the side; “I’m Doctor Jane Holmes, I mediate the group.”
Dean dozes for a while, feels strangely drained. He can’t sleep, won’t let himself because every time he gets close he sees Alistair wearing Cas’s face GRINNING down at him and bile rises in his throat.
He pushes himself up and something sounds wrong about his footsteps. Something—something’s NOT RIGHT—
“I know he’s just bitching to save face, but he knows Sam needs some privacy. Traipsing in and out of there at all hours is kind of wearing at him.”
Bobby’s standing at the corner of the house by now, watching, rubbing his hands clean on a rag. Sam looks up and meets his eyes, searches for some kind of help here, but Bobby just jerks his chin as if to say; ‘Get goin’.
The waitress at the Waffle House asked him what was wrong, Castiel looked up at her and asked; “How do you kill the pain of bad memories?”
She snorted; “Aw, am I gonna have to promise you a lollypop to get you to sit still?” She plucked up a clean comb and sat to work.
He can see the notches of his spine through his shirt, the curl in his hair where it’s stuck to his neck by sweat and grime. He seems dimmed, colorless… dead.
It’s quick. Too quick, Dean didn’t think it was possible for him to move like that considering this version of him is missing half of his leg, but one second The Other is just standing there, the next Dean is on his back on the table and He is bending over him and all Dean can see is those same hands pinning Cas down, folding him up and TAKING—
Chuck slouches heavily in his chair, eyes unfocused hands lifted and twitching around his glass of booze; “I killed your father. I burned your mother alive—I—“
Dean feels himself speak, can’t control it, it comes from somewhere inside him and bubbles up in a voice too thin and tight, like violin strings; “Whosthere!”
Dean wakes up with a gasp, his chest aches—his head hurts and the room is too hazy with late afternoon sun, twinkling against the ceiling, reflected off old cracked windshields in the yard.
His breath hitched and came out in a stuttering hiss, “Okay,” He moved forward slowly, bouncing slightly on his toes. A little of this, a little of that—a couple grapes to roll around and wobble across the empty places on the ceramic.
“Dean, he doesn’t have the energy to chase off a Coyote spirit! How the hell do you expect him to heal your car!”
Castiel looks down with keen interest and for a moment Dean fears his body has betrayed his thoughts and desires. He shifts his hips uncomfortably and is relieved when his genitals seem to have been paying no attention to the conversation.
“Mukilteo Washington… Over the week three men disappear and wash up on the shore drowned with their eyeballs gone and some of their teeth missing. One of them had his fingers and toes half eaten, but that could have been gulls, he was kinda bloated when they found him. Weird thing was all three of these guys were strong swimmers and the tide was out at the time they disappeared.”
For the first week Dean didn’t really know what to do with himself. He’d run out of bullets in less than an hour, gave up and used his gun as a club until he’d lost it one night. His knife came in handy, not much here liked silver and any weapons he happened to find weren’t silver or iron or anything useful. There was always a monster out there to fight, always something trying to kill him, be it the beasts with the glowing eyes, or the very scenery—He had a minor panic attack when a tree… or what had looked like a tree, bent over and opened a wide gaping mouth amid its leaves and tried to eat him. Thrashed its branches against the earth trying to grab him and groaned like a lion in heat.
They don’t stop for a hotel, of course not. Dean pulls off at a fucking Wal-Mart and parks at the end of the lot away from everything else, shoves his keys into his hip pocket and slouches against the door with his arms crossed. He won’t even let Sam drive. Of course, Sam isn’t exactly sure he deserves to drive after what he’d said.
His jaw tightened and his eyes flicked to meet Sam’s in the mirror then down to the blood in the sink. “You saw how strong he was, Sam. I tried but—“
“It’s possible,” Castiel said. “You were unaffected by his presence, it’s possible the act wouldn’t cause any ill effects if you aren’t open to grace.”
Castiel wonders if Dean understands the fact that Sputnik knows about God and is beginning to grasp the idea that she has a soul. Nothing near as powerful as a human’s soul, but it’s there. Castiel can feel it reaching toward him and pulling him toward Dean. Pleading with him to help, to make it better.
Why is Castiel just standing there though, hiding. Why the hell is he invisible? Dean ignores him at first, stealing glances every few minutes while he throws Sputnik’s ball around. Maybe he’s upset that Dean had… had kissed him.
His mouth opened and closed. Talking had never really been his forte, well, maybe that was a lie. He just didn't like it, “We didn’t do anything. Really… It just—Am I really an emotionally constipated jackass?” He felt his face twist in discomfort.
“I don’t know, but its something we need to keep an eye on… He couldn’t feel Sputnik. He couldn’t find her when he looked, and couldn’t tell where the zoofreaks were.”
It’s the voice, soft and so—so human sounding. When he looks up he doesn’t see an angel, he sees his Cas standing there looking at him just like he had in the front seat of the Impala. His eyes were pleading but veiled and there was tension between his brows, across the bridge of his nose and in his jaws. Like it was taking everything he had not to let his lip tremble. It hit Dean right below the heart and twisted upward like a knife.
Sputnik likes Safire because the girl throws a stick for her in the yard while Dean and Sam talk to her mother about what’s been going on in the house.
Tabitha was back behind the fence now standing at her father’s elbow with her arms crossed on top of the fence; “She was all dirty and covered in chiggers when I found her. Took her to the dog groomer in town, they gave her a bath and a flea dip, she cleaned up real nice.”
Then there was a flash—a brief, dying kind of glitter and Dean craned his neck, blinked and felt his middle tighten up like someone had stuck a fist in there and started squeezing.
There was an active hornet’s nest clinging to the corner of the porch roof and Dean eyed the winged monstrosity perched at its mouth with a mix of fear and hatred.
I hope to have more soon, but I'm not really sure. I've been very very sick and there is school to contend with, but know, I will not EVER abandon this unless I like, die in a horrible car crash or something, so... yeah.
Dean shrugged, looked down at the food and then focused on his hands; “Not much. I’m pretty tired, but it’s my own fault… And I think I’m getting the flu—Had this weird cough the last few days.”
Sam pushes his hair back from his face and holds his hands out, one toward Chuck, one toward his brother; “You want proof?”
Dean snorted, nudged some dying plant life at the edge of the yard with the side of his boot, found something blue and silver and wadded up half hidden in the leaf litter. At first he ignored it. But ten steps later when he found another one stopped, crouched and picked it up.
Sam wrestled Dean’s arms down and pried his eyes open between forefinger and thumb. Dean grumbled and rolled his eyes around petulantly but Sam checked the reaction of his pupils.
Dean swallows again glances to the right and gropes numbly at the cup of ice-pieces the nurse had been employing against him earlier. His teeth hurt too much to chew them and swallowing anything feels like choking down broken glass, but letting the pieces melt and slide down doesn’t feel too bad.“Cas?”
Sam rolls his eyes and gathers an armful of things, books and old newspapers and a bag with their dirty/bloodstained clothing in it. “I’ll come back for the rest later.”
“Hey,” Dean tried to pull it out of her grip, but Jo was strong for her size, dragged out a t-shirt that hadn’t smelled too awful and shook it at the dog.
Angels, most particularly Seraphs, are terribly gossipy. When in groups they often chatter ceaselessly. The buildup of energy often causes a dull ringing in the ears of humans near them. Psychics sensitive enough to catch snippets of conversation often call it white noise, when in fact it is only the inane conversation of the host.
Benny backs off the first few times, then he laughs and calls him a puffed up sparrow and Dean threatens to chop off his head, needing him or not.
Dean sneers down at the blade as it catches and pulls on the flame like edges of him—he can see it, see how the barely there flicker is shaved at by the blade—it’s cold—BURNS leaves him aching and conscious of the singed threads where it has touched him. “You’re gonna kill a Reaper with that? It’s a little on the nose, don’t you think?”
Chuck Shurley is a scrawny guy with an unkempt beard, messy half combed hair and knobby knees. He answers the door in a tattered gray and black robe, his underwear and an undershirt with what looks like a spaghetti-O stain on the front. He squints at them and exhales a cloud of whiskey scented breath into the chilled air, left eyebrow cocked up in a way that denied any wrongdoing with his his obvious drunkenness and undress.
She limps, staggers and whines occasionally, stops and lays down a few times, but when Sam calls to her, pitches his voice high and feigns excitement she wags her tail weakly and forces herself up again.
It happens completely without his permission or awareness. Some little thread still tethering him to his body pulls taut—
Dean rubbed his eyes tiredly, shifted his weight against the car seat and blinked at the signs flipping past.
“I have never, in all my millennia of existence, encountered a creature as stubborn, faithless, and damnably self-effacing as you… I want to save you from this, but I can’t.”
Light burns from within him, through his skin, out his mouth, nose ears, between his very cells. Dean can see an outline of his wings and four of his arms stretched wide in pain as he seems to levitate, burning resplendent like a nebula before with an audible, horrible tearing sound—like flesh between hellhound’s teeth—the world around them flashes static and Castiel hits the warehouse floor on his knees, gasping for ragged breath.
He had the Impala up on jacks, changing the oil with the radio playing. He was tapping his foot along with the beat and grunted in acknowledgement when Ellen came into the bay and called out from a short distance away, so as not to startle him.
He tried to swallow, couldn’t quite manage and tried again with no success, wound up coughing into his elbow and turning away from that… that Face. “Fine… I’m fine.”
He knows without even seeing him who it is, knows even though the thrum of POWER is near nonexistent. He knows because Castiel just—Dean KNOWS him. Knows the feel of his borrowed skin and the pressure of Him and it is so strangely familiar and weird and Dean almost recoils from it because the familiarity is alien and he doesn’t know where it’s come from so he doesn’t trust it.
Bobby remembered helping Sam wash the blood from Dean’s body after the hellhounds had torn him apart. He remembered the smell and the visceral, ugly quality of death to someone so young and so important, someone so vital to Bobby’s existence. It hadn’t felt sacred then, it had felt sick and desperate, some pathetic denial of a life cut too short. Like it made a difference to the worms and flies if the body was clean or not.
Sam rolled his eyes; “Look, I know Ruby’s not exactly on your Christmas list, but if she can help us get to Lilith—”
Dean reached out on instinct, something foreign that he didn’t understand, similar to the way the words Castiel spoke sounded so familiar, like when he’d learned some French watching Canadian VHF TV when he was younger and Dad had parked them in upstate New York. He couldn’t remember the meaning of much now but he remembered the words, the feel of them in his mouth. He reached out and touched the angel’s leg, felt the contact jolt through him like the electric shock of an ATM. Castiel’s grace grabbed him and Dean felt something clicking into place, like the tumblers of a combination lock, twisting and twisting until heat burst in Dean’s chest and throat, burned like the first drag on a cigarette when he’d been seven— Allison had laughed and laughed and little Dean had choked and coughed and felt the smoke in his lungs like acid—
