"You alright with this? Just that you are unusually quiet. I mean... Mrs. Hudson is out and all today and I thought you'd be more... vocal," it's not something you hear everyday, nor it was a common day-to-day question during an intimate moment like this but it was their first time and they were in a way
15.36pm. The detective inspector visited the consulting detective. Because in the past days he'd been visiting, Sherlock wasn't too good. At all. He was the definition of an emotional wreck in every sense of the word.
were all confiscated. He proceeded to sit up and get out of bed while rubbing his red wrists that was irritated from the cuffs before turning his head to what was on the other side of the glass wall.
He could hear John's tired footsteps up the stairs, seemingly ready to nag at Sherlock. It's not even dinner time, so he must have cancelled out on his date. If it were a more tense or angry footsteps, then just maybe it would be because
domesticity was what he wanted. But he probably would like to keep it as to only on important occasions, like her birthday and Christmas day. He will make sure he can visit then. But he didn't tell the missus this. Because worst case scenario is that he wont be around to even visit. That'll just break her.
He knew he got the permission from Sherlock earlier, so he didn't need any double checks before he pulled Sherlock up and pushed him to the wall, and continued marking all over the man's sturdy and thin frame. Now
I... I had flashes of his name a few times but-" a pause. He's clearly choosing his words to see if he should or should not have this information before deciding in a short time.
At that exact moment he reached the end of the sentence, he heard the door creaked open and John entered with a hot cup of tea. The expression on John's face was obvious that he was holding in every single venom he had to offer to Sherlock.
"I really do hope so," at this point, John looked insecure and a tad nervous about his decision to marry his girlfriend, and Lestrade knew that look. He had it with his ex-wife when the spark in their relationship still existed. So he smiled at John when that expression reminded him of good times.
Of course he didn’t answer. He’d be tired of John by then. His only response to John’s question was moving to a nearby bench and continued with his smoking.
“You’re freezing but you won’t come back home,” it sounded like a plead, not an empty blame on him. Sherlock could only respond by ducking his head lower, in embarrassment. But he snapped his head back up when he felt a fabric being wrapped around his shoulders and saw John wrapping him in an extra scarf he had brought along with him there.
she whined but with a very lovely smile across her face. He did managed to stop by a grocery store on his way back, but the plastics in his grip wasn't filled with food-just basic miscellaneous home items. He had something in mind about the food issue-he wanted to bring her over to a fancy (and coincidentally) her favourite restaurant and have dinner there. Maybe, just maybe if he could word it out, he would finally propose to tie the knot with his girlfriend of somewhere under two years.
"How can I believe you when all these times, for me it's always you but that doesn't apply to you, does it? So why tell me now?"
flat was left ajar very much carelessly. Sherlock isn't one to appreciate the lack of privacy so he always keep the door completely shut, almost at all times.
"Then take me," that made John's dominant side to take over, pulling him for a heated kiss with some hip movement while he turned Sherlock over to overpower the taller man. Being devoured by Sherlock was fun, but he would have preferred to see the man tremble underneath him. He met his hips with Sherlock and started moving while kissing the man's tempting throat as he savour all the sultry moans that came out of his mouth.
Mrs. Hudson had came in moments after, calling up an ambulance without a second thought before she rushed to Sherlock, who was half lidded as if keeping his eyes open was too much work. There was no other sounds than sobs and cries in the eeriely still living room of 221B, and it receded into silence when neither of them could feel any more rise of Sherlock's chest.
“Dismantling Moriarty’s network took me longer than anticipated and I was not who I was, John. Every human contact I had was interrelated to interrogations or simply to… kill. My fight senses were high and the last few months had me only with my flight senses. I was… scared. John that’s not even generic of me but I was terrified. I was broken in so many ways and yet when I came back to you-”
"Yes, okay," he answered and locked his eyes with Sherlock's. He nodded to allow Sherlock to continue, which he did-slowly. John let out a long moan when Sherlock is pushing all the way in. He looked at John to make sure he was still alright and John upon seeing this, nodded to telling him to go on.
He was surely not imagining the small tug of the end of Sherlock’s lips after not seeing it for so long when he said “Home”
convinced even the most important people in his life that he was dead-committed suicide-because he was fake. How the fuck are we supposed to take this information as it is?! No, I can't accept this! For god's sake, you control all the computers, systems and contacts all around London, how come there wasn't any other option but to let us live a lie?" he had to take a pause, because everything was just overwhelming. The lies, the terrible,
Four more people need to be eliminated because they were overthrowing Lord Moran from his position in the government. He went cautiously to the third political person, codename : Antartica. The whole pathway toward's this person's office, the whole vibe of his steps was strangely familiar on his way towards the underground office.
… Then maybe you should. I’m behind you in all this,” John firmly nodded at this, reassuring Sherlock of his commitment for this newfound relationship. In just a few minutes, concerns were shared about the possible consenquences to this. What if Mary burst out in anger at him. Worse, what if she cut off any contact between him and Rosie? That would be the death of him. But Sherlock, clever, clever Sherlock, knows how to ease John just right.
“J-John? It’s… Why are you here? Why-” he began to mumble incoherently, obviously confused. After a few moments, he quieted down and began crying, hard, as if he had kept the tears welled up since the day of the incident. John stood up and slowly wrapped his arms around a very thin Sherlock, trying to calm him down. He didn’t know what to say at that moment, so he just hummed and shushed slowly, as if calming a child.
He's shivering terribly but the touch of the softest fabric only stings to him. Mycroft had threaten him with the promise of rehabilitation centre if he as much as opened his supply box to 'heighten his thought processes' when in reality he just wanted to feel nothing, feel numb because shedding tears for days straight wasn't his usual demeanor and it felt foreign. But those miraculous substances only help for the first few moments, before he could feel how fast he was plunging deep into the abyss of nothingness. He's craving for a fix. He
“Sherlock, that’s…” of course Sherlock would expect words like ‘wonderful’ or ‘a dream come true’. But he was unlucky-not that he believed in luck, but surely he was breaking inside, even Rosie sensed his growing tension.
“All these times, these two hands did so much more damage to you than the oppos-” before he could finish, Sherlock grabbed his hand, startling him.
He tiptoed behind the door so that he won't be seen first hand when they pushed the door, and in position to attack whoever that'll see him. He fixed his mask back on his nose and mouth to absorb any unnecessary sounds he might make, even the sound of breathing, that could spoil anything he planned. His finger was ready on the trigger and his gun was fully loaded. A refill was in his tool belt around his left thigh in case there's more people than he expected.
“You’re well aware I’m off cases for now due to my drug use. Lestrade refuse to let me in on crime scenes nor near any of his precious case files for the time being,” he sighed. Why must it be so hard to believe that a calculating machine could care and even love someone so much? As much as he love John? He was lost in thought and was frowning the whole process, and this had made John smiled. To see his Sherlock thinking so hard about this thing, and so he approached Sherlock slowly and carefully kisses him. He felt Sherlock put his hand behind his neck to deepen the kiss before parting their lips for a moment.
"If it's true that Moriarty brainwashed me, then whatever you are doing to me is just the same. How many times do you need to alter my brain until you're satisfied?" This man just keeps on frustrating him more and more, to be honest.
He had the right to push John away, but John also have the right to fix things. Both of them just needed time to make room for apologies in the future. He's going to try.
“Why are you doing this to me, John? I-I don’t know how to deal with these hurricanes of emotions I’m currently feeling and I hate this,” he said in merely a whisper, but given the distance between them, John could hear each and every word from Sherlock’s shaking mouth.
“But can you still accept this offer, and make it through the wedding? For us?” Sherlock, who was still sitting on the bed, grabbed John’s wrist, and said in a mix of jokingly and serious manner, “but I still hate you”. John just smiled at this.
John was taken aback by this burst of information and took his time to process everything. Lestrade, on the other hand took one of the prepared glass of scotch in front of him, and took a big sip before looking at Mycroft, Sherlock and the glass in his hands back and forth. He put the glass back down angrily and harder than necessary.
Moriarty gave a tight smile and nodded at Sherlock's statement, obviously unsure of releasing Sherlock alone back in London. "Lord Moran will give you the details of which political people to take out. Remember, make sure you get
"Why bother going out on a date with a girl who had nothing better to do than talk about her expensive house and the Labrador she had for Christmas, plus her subtle snort every now and then. Not really someone you'd stick with for more than two weeks," Sherlock muttered from the kitchen table while examining a sample which research would be crucial for a case he had gotten from a client recently.
Sherlock led Janine to the door after the whole charades that happened right before about finding him in a drug den (obviously not clean). One month. One bloody month and that was how they were reunited; being exposed to ALL of their
The voices rarely ever stopped now, and he had to take more than what he used to to keep the noises to a minimum.
He pushed the key through the hole, opening the door in a swift push. It was silent downstairs but he heard murmurs upstairs, maybe of the landlady and the detective, but it sounds like only Mrs. Hudson talking to herself. He swallowed back every words he had, suddenly doubtful of everything. But he made his way to the steps anyway, avoiding the creaky step. And alas it's true once he reached the first floor and gave a few light knocks, that only Mrs. Hudson was there. And she was so pleasant to see John. Maybe she didn't know what happened last night.
"Mary suggested I come by and check up on you. She realized I was worried how you were doing and frankly, she's just as worried," Mary was a fine woman. Sherlock doesn't hate her. He's just jealous of her for being able to get John but
“John. This IS Rosie. The Christening had already happened years ago and… Mary died years ago, too,” John’s eyes widen in disbelief as he clenched his hand onto the bed sheet, trying to contain his anger, his… shock.
. Is that it? Because I think you held me captive long enough here" his voice had the old childish behavior back, his technique to get people to get things done quicker because the longer he used the tone, the more annoying it gets. "Oh and can I have morphine? For the pain?" Lies. Partly a lie. Or technically the truth. It was for pain, both physical and emotional. Numbing. Perfect. All of them in the room was hesitant, but then they prescribed a very controlled amount for Sherlock, and Mycroft was sure to have surveillance on his usage. Seeing him in this state to ask for morphine was something to keep an eye on. Danger night could be any night if it's Sherlock. When they eventually agreed on the dose and had the documents for his discharge signed, Sherlock was unusually giddy about going back home to his flat. But Mycroft knew better why he was excited to be in his own privacy, away from general sight and away from naggings of anyone ever. Especially now he got his hands on his addictions. God knows how many more he hid in his house. Mycroft had dropped his younger brother off to 221B with a sigh, warning Mrs. Hudson too about a possible usage for the week, or month, and also about the scars.
"I'm waiting for Mycroft to get me. I'm dropping the case," he turned to John and looked at him up and down. "It's a little too close to inconveniences," he diverted his sight to the empty view, and as if on cue, the recognizable black car pulled up in front of him.
"It's Holmes. Mycroft Holmes," he continued when Sherlock wasn't offering any answer. But the revelation seemed to only made him more confused.
The change of expression was noticeable. Even someone other than John would see it. It was quick, but clear-hurt, betrayal and pure sadness. And yet the doctor didn't want to comfort the detective, thinking that's what he deserved. Giving a taste of his own medicine.
Rosie was so very clever, because she was raised with the help of the genius Sherlock Holmes, his supposed fiancee no-more. She knew how hurt Sherlock had felt upon receiving the anger from the two Watsons, because Sherlock doesn’t just break down in front of people if it were bearable. She had felt guilty, obviously, because Sherlock was in a way, his father too. Just yet to be official. So, she had tried to show John how much Sherlock had done for him and that both of them hadn’t treated him as they should. She had contacted her uncle Mycroft from John’s phone, asking for help in retrieving John’s lost memory, even if it’s just on video, or on text exchanges, anything. She knew that this should be fixed. But she was still a child, all she could do was hope that she did enough to at least slap some sense in her father. But in a matter of months, it did worked, even if just a bit, but it had made John realize that they did love each other, and that everything Sherlock said in the hospital was indeed true. But were they too late by then? Not even little Rosie was sure.
As ever, the landlady urged Sherlock to eat more, but unlike in the past, she urged because she was worried. Sherlock looked thin,
do. I just wanted you to know everyday or every second, of how amazing that is,"  John would be lying if he said he wasn't awed or flattered by this, because he was, very much.
. He didn't want to know, he really didn't. No involvement, no nothing. But curiosity got the better of him, because he asked himself
"Prove what? That I am your brother? Do you want a list of all the things that you had done when you were little that pissed me off? If so, you will have to wait for a while because frankly, even a file can't fit all the lists," he sneered back. His mind was now a mess, with two contradicting tales mixed up in his mind. Slamming his fist on the thick glass, he raised his voice that was unintentionally filled with agony and hurt.
the most important person to Sherlock back then, and not even he comes close to the rank in Sherlock's mind.
"How?! Tell me how he saved you, Sherlock, because just look at you! You are skinnier than you've ever been, you're dangerously pale that I know if I were to take your hand, it would be ice cold. Now tell me, how the
"Right. Okay," he didn't take off his jacket when he reached home earlier, so he waited for Sherlock by the door, unnecessarily nervous. He was just a regular man, invalidated from Afghanistan, and was asked out by the craved Sherlock Holmes? Shit can't possibly be real right now. Could be a trick, or maybe just a bloody social experiment.
to this so such questions left awkward heaviness in the air. John gave him a warm, apologetic smile before kissing the side of his lips before finally speaking up.
"Make you... love me," he said in barely a whisper but it still echoed in the room enough for John to hear it. He looked down at his hand with the pen he had gotten some time ago from John.
"Just make sure that wound is taken care of. It would take weeks to heal and months to properly disappear or form a painless scar"
Just before he went to hop in the car with a case of clothes and necessity tools, he went to give another bouquet of the same flowers to Mrs. Hudson, less flowers in this one though. Making it look less lively, and a bit empty. Both were wrapped in a way that visualizes and represents the Victorian era for some reason. He explained to Mrs. Hudson, just briefly, enough for her to get the idea for the second bouquet.
Walking out the NSY, he sees the supposed car waiting for him, and recognized everything of the car. The colour, the brand, and the tinted windows. Usually when this car came for him, it was because the other Holmes would want his help to track down Sherlock or help solve a little case involving Sherlock. It would all be about Sherlock. But why now? There's nothing to be spoken about after two years-Sherlock was
Sherlock could only looked at the door which John went through, feeling a bit guilty. He never knew what kind of comments were necessary or not, kind or not. But considering John's annoyed reaction, maybe he didn't do a good job at it. Trying to tune out the thought, he went back to his simple research and tried to get this case done and over with soon.
He took a breather, not knowing what to expect. And he didn't really expect otherwise when he pushed the door open to find the room empty. Rid of any life. All the stuff are there, messy as always but... lifeless. Maybe he went out for a case, and was rushing. John instinctively walked around the room, tracing everything with his eyes, trying to deduce terribly what Sherlock might have been doing. But most of what he gathered was that, not much had been at all touched. Let alone moved or used. The most used item was probably the teacup Mrs. Hudson used to make his tea in but that cup was dry. Sherlock's experiment table wasn't filled with any new projects. He touched the familiar leather chair but it wasn't even warm.
“We can’t say for sure, Mr. Holmes. But from the looks of it, he would recover soon, positively. Further details can only be known after the surgery and treatment,” Sherlock just nodded, not knowing what else he could do after receiving that news. Every second felt like it had extended into hours. His heart was beating so fast, it could had been enough to beat for the both of them, but that wasn’t a plausible option, no matter how much he wanted to do that.
"But you should". Sherlock looked annoyed that this person was insisting something he clearly doesn't want nor need, so he turned his head to tell whoever that was to piss off and leave him alone, only to see a familiar face. Eyes widen in shock, he stood up abruptly and walked slowly to the glass.
"You know that's not how the bathroom work! You go in one at a time, not... twice at once, Sherlock," he sighed at the lack of respect his flatmate have against privacy.
to prompt a drugs bust for his sake. Earlier that week, the drugs bust attempt really was of no use because Sherlock, who was practically living in lowkey wealth, could always acquire a new batch of drugs. Today was his routine visit to see how the man was.
"London isn't the same anymore, Mrs. Hudson. What's the point of staying when home doesn't feel much like one?" he said with a smile, a smile desperate for her to try and understand what he meant. It's not the same for him anymore because he was dead. And he wished he truly was. Because that would be a better memory than having to return knowing John moved on from him, and possibly still hated him a little about the falsified death. Mrs. Hudson's forehead just creased more, growing more concerned and pitiful towards the man he knew since his worse days.
. I wouldn't risk that, neither would he. Plus, if he had actually died later, I don't think either of you would take his death better than the first time," and to be honest, they wouldn't. They'd just go on a mob saying that Mycroft gave them false hopes because no promises for survival was made.
Sherlock just stood there in awe, feeling his heart shatter knowing that these two years just as painful for John as it is for him. He wanted to be selfish, saying that John doesn’t understand what he went through but he wouldn’t want to add salt to the wound. But he was all in all, stubborn, anyway. It was something he couldn’t simply resist because it was built into his character. A stupid feature that comes with this genius machine.
"I don't think so. Well, I don't know but I assume she's not. I like her, but there's nothing interesting in it for me and I'm sure she thinks the same of me," he said with as much uneasiness as John was when he was considering the possibility of his proposal to be rejected. They exchanged a few more words and smiles and reassurances until the hour had passed. It was finally the time for John to serve lunch for Sherlock, and he'd be lying if he said he wasn't even the slightest nervous to finally see Sherlock after two years of not being face to face with the mad genius, if that's even him anymore.
Apologies for the lack of enthusiasm in my writing for this chapter. I was highly motivated to finish this chapter but my mind and eyes wasn't cooperating. Frankly speaking, I was a bit sleepy and exhausted writing this after midnight and I have plans for tomorrow early in the morning. But a writer gotta write.
"Two years. Two- You let me grieve for two years," John spoke, in a slow, rage filled voice. It falters, but not out of fear, but pure,
lie to him about an important information of your survival, but he will be happy that you are alive. Not too well, but still alive," both of them let out a long breath. This interaction was wholesome.
Mycroft glanced at Sherlock's sleeves and back up at him. "John Watson, an ex-army doctor who had moved in with you four years ago in 221B Baker Street. He's your best friend," he briefly explained, just in case Sherlock couldn't take in too many confusing information considering his current mindset, thanks to Moriarty.
"I am the Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard, which hopefully you remember which place I'm talking about. You always helped me on cases and I suppose we have known each other for quite a while. Give or take, 9 years," Sherlock didn't at all looked impressed by the explanation, though.
“Why is there a new apparition? I didn’t take any hallucinogenic drugs recently. You shouldn’t be here,” he turned his head slightly away from John, but he managed to cup his face before he completely looked away.
"If this is just an attempt to rub the incident to my face, then I'll just go. No use talking to you," Sherlock muttered in a short breath, the whole sentence rushed but lack of any of the usual weisenheimers. He was already stepping back from the car and about to turn back to the length of the sidewalk when Mycroft opened the car door.
"Sir, if you would follow me. I shall bring you to your meeting venue," he turned back around and walked in long strides inside the building. John and Lestrade had no other option but to follow the guardsmen because standing outside cluelessly wont help whatsoever. Fear and anticipation in heart, they finally reached an office-like door after walking through some corridors and past many rooms. One guard knocked on the door and stepped aside to give room for the two confused men to enter when he heard a faint but strict voice say
"Look at you, such a masterpiece. And now you're mine," Sherlock commented before climbing on top of him like a predator that found itself a prey, teasingly runs his hand up and down John's body but avoiding the sensitive area.
As if it couldn't get hotter, he was drooling by the sight of Sherlock using the precum from John's hard cock to open himself up. His eyes fluttered as he insert one finger into himself and John just couldn't help it but to massage his aching cock at the sight. When Sherlock was a bit more relaxed, he saw what John was doing and pulled his hand off to be replaced by his own mouth. The way he teased every nerve and vein using his tongue and teeth, and the vibration he got from the stiffled moans Sherlock gave out as he fucked himself using his fingers was overwhelming that he pushed his head back, calming himself to try to last longer.
"I don't see why you should know. Just because you're my best friend, doesn't mean you can fish for any information from me, John,"
, though a certain someone prefer the name 'Ice Man' on you. Aged 41, unofficially. A minor position in the government but big enough of a position to threaten my employer," Sherlock's deep baritone voice was clearly heard by Mycroft, who was reading a book cross-legged on a chair outside of Sherlock's cell while Sherlock didn't move from his bed and kept looking out to the man in a fairly expensive outfit, fitting for a political man, who's family was a country squire.
Greg didn't even had a room for any more words when Sherlock hastily took out the keys to his flat and practically slammed the door shut when he made his way in. Subconsciously, Greg had the growing weight on his shoulder, because at this point and moment, he might just be the only support system Sherlock had, because unlike Mrs. Hudson, he had witness the ugly truth of the danger nights.
"Maybe... like a married couple," John winked at Sherlock. His face was getting so red, because who would've thought that Sherlock himself could have someone that would marry him, let alone the man of his dreams? "Y-you'd bear with me for the rest of your life?" he subconsciously had one of his hand on his mouth, being embarrassed.
One of the car window rolled down to reveal a very smug looking Mycroft, face a mix of pride and sympathy when he made eye contact with Sherlock.
“Sherlock. If you want me to tell you the truth then you must promise that you will not stop talking to me, or something in the similar manner,” Sherlock scoffed at this ridiculous statement.
"The same thought in my mind before, but... we can make it a reality now," he looked into Sherlock's eyes lovingly, admiring the Crab Nebula pattern in the sharp gaze.
, especially hearing Sherlock swear during this session which was undeniably sexy as hell. Everything was perfect. John being in complete awe was unable to respond in the few seconds between them so Sherlock proposed the idea in a different paraphrase, that shows his eligible dominant side.
“Sherl- what happened?” Rosie was giddy and happy, she was practically jumping around and calling out ‘daddy’ out of excitement, but every bit of joy and thrill simply fade away along with the last words of John’s next question.
"Because I'm not the only one who deserve an important piece of information; a truth, once in a while," It must be a while since he heard such sincerity that was meant for his ears because Sherlock was visibly taken aback by this. It was always deceit, mockery and dejection in his everyday life, and the Watsons was one of the only joy he could obtain for his sake of sanity. And for once, he had gotten something he never had expected from John-mutuality of interest. He raised John's hand that was holding his and rest his forehead on it, hiding his face in case he suddenly had been emotional from this.
"What comes first isn't my life anymore," he mumbled breathlessly as the grip on the photograph loosen just a bit.
"Why aren't you at the wedding, Giles?" Sherlock asked, very much annoyed by the grey-haired man stepping out of the car.
He'd had to risk it, because he needed to stay alive. Slowly, while clutching onto himself in hope it would help warm up, he made his way to the wooden door and knocked on the door loudly-or rather banging on it. After a few seconds, he could hear someone working on the locks of the door and ocean blue eyes peeked from the gap between door and the frame before widen in shock (and maybe horror).
Making his way through the hallway towards the room at the back, he noticed the pictures hanging on the wall. Family portraits, memorable pictures with friends, there's one with Mike Stamford and another with Lestrade, or even Rosie's godmothers. He doesn't know the others.
"Yeah, he always does that. It's not like it never happened," he knows he's familiar with the voice, but that must be impossible, right?
"Not necessarily the old one, but we just don't know you anymore at this point. We just want you to be yourself again. Not this... brainwashed version,"
"Will you be okay?" Mycroft asked slowly, cautiously. He was worried, definitely worried because Sherlock just doesn't seem much like himself now. It's alarming.
"I don't know. The future remains mysterious. Who knows what will happen," a pause. Reminiscing the risk he's taking and the fate he's expected to accept. "I
"Then you're going to love what comes next," he stood up to grab some lube and condom from the nightstand before climbing back up to the bed.
He pulled Sherlock up in surprise while leaning him on the wall, and Sherlock instinctively wrapped his arms around John, both of them already quite breathless but too driven by lust to even stop. John slowly pushed the head of his cock in Sherlock and Sherlock's head fell back to rest on the wall, while he clawed at John's back. Once he was ball deep, he felt Sherlock move his hips subtly so he gave him what he wanted and began to thrust in and out.
or think is so wrong to you-to everyone?" he walked back to his bed and sighed as he sat down, avoiding any sort of eye contact. "Don't bother answering the question, then as it clearly frustrates you so much to even be in this room,"
"Why are you here anyway?" he avoided the question entirely, and changed the direction of conversation. Pointless to talk about the injuries. If John were to only be nice to him after he saw the scars then what's the point? It'll just be misguided guilt and a false mask.
The last thing Sherlock expected to see looking at him from the cab window was John, but it was his partner, Mary. John didn't even took a second glance. Was he really that repulsed by him? He pulled his hand away from his nose, assuming it's not bleeding anymore before he walked opposite to where the cab drove off to. Probably should just sniff in the night air and think about everything. From what and how John responded to his return, it made him think if coming back to London was a mistake. If Mycroft saving him after the last thread of Moriarty's network was a mistake. Mycroft did warn him that it's possible for John to not welcome him back, and as much as he hated to admit his brother's preminition was right, he was, in every way, right. If John, the person he focused on coming back for amongst everyone else, the man who
not at the wedding? You're John's best man. I should be the one asking you that" Greg mused and only just noticed the burning end of the cigarette between Sherlock's delicate fingers. He really could only internally shake his head at that because he suspected, no,
“But damn well a damaged good, you are” he grunted a tone higher than his mumbles, but apparently loud enough for John to register that he had indeed said something under his breath.
"I waited for two years, only to come back to you moving on, to another person. A woman. Mary. And completely dejected me last night. What do you want me to wait more for?"
"You hardly ever open up to me anymore after the incident. Is that why? Being nice to me isn't necessary anymore?"
"Not surprising, considering it was you habitual routine to come barging into my office when you have a demand in mind, or just to annoy me from time to time. You
skin. Sher - I love you too much to let you go,” John said in between sobs that he just couldn’t hold back anymore.
. He got into the black car, and it almost instantly drove away. The whole trip took so long, so he was sure he was now outside of London.
"Get out," his tone leaves no room for arguement, and so John closed the bedroom door, and leaned on it. He covered his face with the palm of his hands while sliding down the door to sit against the door. He was guilt ridden. Sherlock was indeed an arsehole but he didn't deserve all the poison he spilled just now. From inside the room, he could hear Sherlock's shaky breaths and muffled sobs just for a few moments and he was sure Sherlock was trying to straighten himself up and maintain a casual persona. He could hear some movements from inside the room, something like the flap of the heavy Belstaff coat he had always heard back then when Sherlock was ready to go out, and then he heard the clink of the teacup against the coaster and some... slow shrieking of metal being rubbed against one another.
He will say this again and again, but the first drag of smoke will always be the the most satisfying one. And it made him wonder why he even stopped smoking in the first place? That was fucking relieving and the little dose was helping him, even in the slightest that it made him forget why he was even standing on the sidewalk, backing the golden label of 221B. That was when he saw a pair of bright lights of a car he knew all too much slowing down next to him.
Promises aside, Sherlock tugged on John's finger, taking off his ring which strongly tied John to Mary.
The visits started to see how Sherlock react to the people who he presumably saved before working with Moriarty. It was the search for the truth for him, and it wasn't anywhere near easy.
"Yes. Fuck yes, I will. I want you to take me," all pride and dignity aside, he just wants to feel dominated by Sherlock-fucking-Holmes and feel him inside and be fucked into the cushion of the sofa. Sherlock insisted they retreated to the bedroom, with more space and privacy before pushing him on his back to the bed.
The man in the black suit was obviously not pleased in any way about him speeding up the street because he chased after him and pointed a gun at him, forcing him to turn back to the car and get in. He finally complied when threatened like so.
"You know, everything nice that happened between you and almost everyone are usually fake and you never cared how it affected your... Lab rats for this social experiment of some sort. What made you like this?" he fiddled with the handle of his teacup, looking intently into Sherlock's direction. He could only sigh at this question, knowing it would as well start a petty banter between the two men and wake the poor sleeping Rosie in another room. Carefully, he revert his focus back to the slide of sample under the lens of the microscope, while adjusting the height of the sample to get a sharp microscopic image to be recorded.
"Shhh, Watson. Go back to sleep," Sherlock mumbles under his breath while cradling the head of the toddler in his arms, when he was actually meant to say his thanks allowing him an acceptable escape from John.
For a man that was seen as emotionless and of the sorts, him being shocked by those words would be unexpected. But that was what happened. He took a small step back, taken aback by the exclamation. Jaws clenched and voice caught in his throat, finding nothing to counter those words for a few seconds. All sense of time seemed to malfunctioned when he felt that time just froze itself, but his heart was beating fast, he could hear it in his ear. And god forbid, inhaling air suddenly became the hardest thing to do. His body now stiff, all the scars and wounds ache so much and the desire to scratch it till it bleed again was strong.
He hated it when the weather forecast had a completely different prediction that his, but maybe this time he was rather regretful that he didn't take heed of it. Because now, he's freezing in his car in the middle of a stakeout. The car was stuck a while back when he was stalking his suspect but if he needed to chase him again, he'd need to wait until he had help from anyone passing by but the next person might pass by by the time he froze to death, so he looked over to the houses and spotted one that was still lit.
telling me this!" he clenched his hair and let out a long exasperated sigh. "You're-you're just trying to make him look bad to me, because you don't like him". Mycroft stood up and goes directly in front of Sherlock, talking in a dangerously low tone, "just as he did with me, John and the others".
,"  John corrected and Sherlock was sure he could hear a faint chuckle at the end of it. Both of them missed the nonsense in their daily conversations from when they were still living together. Sherlock looked up slowly to savor the smile on John's face while he's still here but he had only contrived a few moments of it before John's smile faded. Confusion was plastered across Sherlock's face and bewilderment on John's face.
In a distance, he heard the familiar hoot that Mrs. Hudson always does. At least that made him smile a bit and decide to get up. She was the person that truly stuck with Sherlock, like a mother figure too. And so Sherlock went out to present himself in a shabby fashion-hair ruffled and dressing gown loosely hanging from one shoulder. Mrs. Hudson was with her uplifting smile and her giddy pitch, offering the morning tea to Sherlock.
Just when he was about to let the fate wash over him, the door swung open in a force that could only indicate that someone had kicked it open. Fuck—
"Why wouldn't I be?" he replied with a forced grin, ones that daredevils would often wear after a flawless jump to prove people wrong.
“John? This… uh… this isn’t right,” he admitted before locking his eyes on John’s dilated pupils. Almost abruptly, John stopped and a guilty expression clouded his face.
Maybe being the best assassin known from the underworld doesn't help Sherlock escape the intellect of his own brother, Mycroft Holmes. Every flight will eventually experience its fall, and so does the glory days of Sherlock's assassin identity.
"I have," Sherlock said in a broken voice, barely coming out of his throat from the tears he's trying to swallow back.
Sherlock had heard the familiar voice that visited him all those days just outside the door, but he had fallen over when his knees gave out. He took a little too much that day, his desperation got the best of him. The need to shut his mind off from self loathing was too much that day and that had him injecting, consuming an amount that'd supposedly could fight those off. But little did he know, that it might just have a more permanent effect. In his mind, he was terrified, but also partly anticipating the end. Maybe it's for the best.
. Et cetera,” Sherlock sneered in annoyance. It was just some simple declination of offers but it had hurt Sherlock so much because John had chosen simple, normal activities over the cases that had gave them thrills and something to occupy their time with all those years. Of course it would hurt, because Sherlock doesn’t know how to entertain himself otherwise.
After a few moments of thinking about worst case scenarios and possibilities, he only had one plausible solution, which was to break the news to the public. But... perhaps firstly to the three most important people for Sherlock pre-fall. He shifted his attention towards the screen that showed Sherlock through the cell cameras, just sitting on the bed-clearly thinking. Maybe if they come and talk to him, he would start to believe the truth once again. But he sure wasn't eager for the response for when he tells them about the faked act. Some yelling would definitely be involved but it would be worth it if it meant he could get them to help him in this problem.
“I-I’m sorry for being such a selfish prick. I didn’t know that part of your story, nor even cared to acknowledge it,” he let his sight drop to the floor in shame.
”All the compliments you have given me over the years. Are they sympathetic attempts that are actually hollow in the inside?”
“You know you do so much more. You’re my second opinion－an important remark,” he was getting stressed by the strain John was putting on their friendship. He took a pause before continuing his response just in hope to make John stop hurting him emotionally.
“John. Sorry I didn’t realized you arrived,” he said with a brief eye contact, as if to make sure he was not talking to a wrong person. John gingerly nodded at the statement and hand out the hot coffee to Sherlock, who grabbed it with his uninjured hand. A short contact of their fingers had made John feel relieved he brought some hot drink because he was as cold as a dead corpse in water, or in the morgue.
"Thank you for the clothes and tea. I'll leave as soon as I can, and stay out of your life," he said with a low but cold voice, keeping his head low.
“Will daddy wake up soon?” little Watson asked Sherlock who was lying his head beside John’s inanimate hand.
“John. Could you just… wake up for me? I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you, now look at where we at now. Usually it’s me on the hospital bed. Seeing you on this godforsaken bed is… wrong. So very wrong. I need you, John so please wake up for me,” the knuckles of John’s hand was brought to Sherlock’s mouth for a feather-light kiss before putting on the fallen ring he had retrieved back on John’s finger. As if a promise that he’d be there when he wakes up.
the doctor in him fussed before he packed up the medical kit and stood up along with Sherlock, handing him his untouched coffee.
pointed out before I left. Good job, Sherlock. That's one more on the list on the dates you ruined," he was pressing the bridge of his nose, stressed.
"I'm bleeding," Okay. That's a way to get his attention. He swiftly pulled his towel from a nearby railing to wrap around his waist, and he needed to cover his slight erection that hadn't yet completely go away. When he thought that he hid it well enough, he stepped out of his cocoon of shower curtain and walked towards Sherlock, who was touching the side of his head that wasn't visible from John's direction. Once he was close enough, Sherlock turned his head around to John, and with a smirk, he let his hand fall to his sides.
Sherlock looked up from his phone when he reached his bookshelf and put a small box of petri dishes on it.
The first word he uttered since being in the car, was when the slow, barely subtle gasp of the private doctor was heard from behind him. He just don't get why they need to be so surprised when they treat a lot of patients, mostly bloody work. A simple criss cross on his back, and some burn marks shouldn't be new to them. There were two deep lines of wound on his back, and too fresh to handle a great pressure on it. The nurses and doctor assigned to handle Sherlock practically had to peel off the shirt off of Sherlock because the wound started to excrete both blood and pus from the lack of care of the wound. Sherlock might've not seen it so he wouldn't really realize how bad it was, but eventhough the liquid release wasn't much, it wasn't a pleasant sight.
“I said; you SHOULD BE!” John had never heard Sherlock raised his voice that high, and in addition to that - so full of anger, it made John want to cower in the corner somewhere, like a terrified puppy.
After a bit more of investigating, he had found a connection between the two victims, which was Lord Moran. Ugh of course, how was he this slow? The killer must had been assigned to kill anyone who was a threat to his position of power, and unfortunately he himself would be one of them. The time of murder had a pattern, and was bound to be repetitive even for today. So he called up his security team before walking back to his office, followed by the loyal Anthea, all waiting outside the office to fetch the moment the infamous murderer to show himself.
It felt almost eternal in the car, but in reality it was only approximately 25 minutes. Finally the minutes were up and he reached a part outside London that seemed rather abandoned except a very white, properly structured and guarded building. He looked around to see the car drove away so he proceeded to walk closer to the building to see a man looking as lost as he was, so he approached him, pat him once on the shoulder thinking that he could help him, only to see it was his own friend, Lestrade.
"I just don't want to lose you anymore, because- because it hurts," he said softly and brings John's hand up to his lips.
"Alright, alright. Don't worry, Mrs. Hudson. I'll see what I can do," sounded like a cue for this person to come up, with or without Mrs. Hudson.
"Don't wait up for tea. I'll be out with Felicia today," John exclaimed from the living room, while looking into the wall mirror to make sure he looked dapper for his gorgeous date.
"Best sleep in a long time," he gave a sincere, but controlled smile. He wasn't lying. The sleep was the best in months, but it doesn't mean he wasn't aching or having nightmares. It was still better than ever. Mrs. Hudson sat opposite to him on the unused armchair, chatting away with Sherlock. She missed him dearly, and she won't miss the chance to be more talkative anymore.
"This is some bloody fucked up shit, I can tell you that," he sighed and leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs and looked at nothing in particular, just in the space between them. When Lestrade doesn't seem to have any more remarks to make, it was finally John's turn to talk, and Mycroft was in a way scared of what he would say. He
"I learned to move on, Sherlock. Maybe you should too," and that was John's goodbye before he left Sherlock alone.
"Because, he, and Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, were under Moriarty's threat. He was ready to kill them, so you saved them by making everyone believe you had really died, to convince the snipers the deal with Moriarty was settled. Me, and Miss Hooper, of course knew what happened and knew you went to infiltrate Moriarty's network in multiple countries, making sure he wont harm anyone else," at this point, Sherlock was starting to breathe more heavily out of frustration the information gave him. Which story should he believe in and which one to delete from his mind? In the brink of tears, he managed to choke out some words while Mycroft looked at him apologetically. He
He never had any problems with people calling him a freak, obviously, because if anything, it was because they ran out of vocabulary to properly describe him. Donovan’s accusation had come a long way before John, it had became a routine for her and for Sherlock to coolly respond with a smart remark. But John, his dear John, the one who made him feel actually worth something and not just a tool to solve problems, had call him a freak. A freak.
Not the reaction he was expecting, but Lestrade froze upon contact and looked more startled that what he would deem necessary.
"Just you," he said quickly, not letting her finish the sentence for he knew what she will say. He gave a pleading smile, and she responded with an understanding one.
John let out a sarcastic laughter and looked at Sherlock dead straight in the eyes. "Oh sorry. Yes, you're right. So
“As I was saying, John, this case is extremely risky. I could very well cross this from my to-do list but Mycroft insisted so much I help him,” he ended with a huff of his breath, obviously amused by his brother’s reliance on him.
, what do you mean?” Now Sherlock’s voice is more firm, very, very pushing him for the truth. For an explanation for that brilliant mind. That, had made John more nervous. He was discombobulated from this level of insisting because it’ll come to a point where he had no other choice but to let the cat out of the bag.
“The doctor said that he’ll be alright. If he wakes up seeing us, he’d be fine,” he tried keeping his voice calm for Rosie’s sake.
Just for a day, that's all Sherlock asks for. If the discussion with Mary turns catastrophic, then at least let him have one day to call John Watson as his own.
It had been weeks, heck it could even had been months since the incident. John didn’t count the days because he hated remembering the day he had regretted what came out of his mouth. Little by little , he tried to improve himself and be more considerate towards Sherlock’s feelings a lot more, and that had shown positive effect. Sherlock wasn’t fully comfortable with John, yet, but he was starting to open up to him like the old days, just with a mix of caution every now and then. John didn’t mind the extra precaution Sherlock took every time they interact because he deserved that treatment, as long as Sherlock was there, alive and talking to him without any visible anger present.
“Shh Sherlock, just let it all out. It’s okay, it’s just me.” And with just that, Sherlock clenched onto the fabric of John’s jacket and hid his face in the crook of his neck before letting all the tears fall. When his breathing started to even out, he placed the cold cheeks in between his small hands gave the most reassuring smile he could make out before speaking once more,
because John Watson was the kind of person to seek a closure for everything. And he was, as always, right, when he saw John entered the kitchen with guilt plastered across his face.
Mycroft chuckled and without raising his head from the book, he answered "It's been a while since I had been using that code name," the casual tone in his voice annoyed Sherlock more because now he's on the receiving end of the humor.
"Well, you're fucking right, Sherlock, I wont be going out with her.. All I could focus on during the dates was how annoying the details
"John, I know this is sudden but I had to find shelter somehow and the other house was vacant, or unwelcoming,"
The first week, he walked in on Sherlock high on cocaine. That very weekend, he got noted that someone spotted a scrawny man sending off a package to 221B, to which Sherlock himself had claimed. Second week, there was three or four different types of opioids in that flat was was regularly used, known mainly because Greg
I have a busy weekend ahead of me, so I put no such promises to make a daily (or every two days) updates on this.
"Jim said you always left me for girlfriends and your friends because I was too weird for you," he frowned. "I was a
He was definitely too close to the glass now, which was quite prohibited but he couldn't care less anymore at that point. "Fucking hell Sherlock, this could kill you!" He closes his eyes while trying to calm down from the headache Sherlock was giving him
"Why is he here?" he asked, panic slightly in his voice. The towel he had draped on his shoulder was shifted to cover more of it, knowing one or two wounds were long enough to show on his shoulder.
“Yes, of course I do,” he said as he placed his large hands on John’s cheeks when he saw that John’s eyes started to water, not wanting to believe that he had heard what he did, because he didn’t want to lose the moment nor to suddenly wake up from a deceptive dream. He gently placed a feather light kiss on John’s creased forehead and John’s tear fell the instant he felt the warm contact on his temple. He thought he had lost everything along with Sherlock, but in just a few little moments like these, everything was somehow magically rebuilt. Maybe they can fix the cracks in their pottery, or even fill them with gold and preserve the cracks that had taught them the value of each other. Maybe not everything done was ever archaic anymore. It was finally full of meaning.
"I was just taking a night ride and then I saw you here, I thought I'd update you that the man we caught at the wedding was now behind bars until the court date" he said, trying to keep the conversation as light as he could, but that seemed like just a fever dream.
“I… I prefer not to talk about it,” of course. Sherlock Holmes is the guy who hates not knowing things. He took John’s wrist in his grip and kept his gaze fixed on John, trying to see any signs of deceit from what he would say.
"You're special, John, and I can't emphasize that enough. When people see the sky, you see the stars, and when people see a freak, you see... an emotional human," Sherlock gave a genuine smile at this before continuing, "The people you went out with wont acknowledge this marvelous quality of yours because they don't see how rare it is, but
“I should talk to her directly. Having her finding out her own husband is having an affair from someone else would hurt more than knowing from my own mouth,”
“Yes, I’m ready. You forgot your scarf, though,” John said while he held out the well-known blue scarf towards Sherlock, but he didn’t make a move to take it. Instead he just… bent down so he was eye level with John. An invitation.
actually happened. Neither of them would have thought it was anywhere near possible but here they were, post-orgasm fatigue on the bed.
“There is nothing not crazy that we do on a day to day basis anyway?” Sherlock countered his reasoning.
“Will he be alright? Will John be okay?” he asked the nurse on his left, who was keeping a close eye on John’s vitals.
“Dr. John Watson had undergone a successful surgery, Mr. Holmes. No complications during the entire operation but a close eye will be kept for a short period of time to ensure no unwanted after effects to occur on the said patient. He should be awake soon, so you may enter his room and stay for as long as you like, considering that you are indeed his fiancee. Congratulations, by the way. The medical report is on the desk inside the room for your purpose of reading, as per request,” the doctor nodded at him and proceeded to lead the way to John’s ward. Upon reaching, the doctor held the door open for all three of them to enter, but Sherlock just stood still, confused of whether he wanted to see John’s condition or just be there for John. Rosie was the one to drag him in because she wanted to see her father so badly, just to make sure he’s alive and breathing. She ran towards the bed and released a breath of relief when she held the hand of his father, which was evidently warm-sign of life.
, who made him forget about all of us-of his old life in London. He was made to believe that none of us cared about him nor liked him, and that Moriarty's attention was all that mattered," he lets out a long breath and observed the looks on John and Lestrade when he stated these information. Tense, but still willing to listen.
" He was almost shouting now, in addition to the echo of the spacious rooms, all the while made it louder than it should be.
“Please, give me another chance, Sherlock. You don’t have to forgive me, just let me prove to you that I do love you,” he pleaded but only got a scoff as an answer before finally being questioned back in return.
"Don't pretend like you care, suddenly. Just go," he got in the car and glanced back at John for a split second before insisting the driver to drive away quickly.
"He said that Moriarty saved him. That's just absurd," he frowned as he turned his head towards the computer monitor on Mycroft's desk that's now turned towards them. Greg must had turned it over out of curiosity of what was happening inside the cell.
“You know Sherlock isn’t here anymore, or at least for a few months more. You’re wasting your breath, John,” she was about to close the door on his face when he managed to hold the door open with his feet.
“She-Sherlock, are you really saying that? You expected to die? You wanted to stop seeing me? Sherlock, let me tell you that I would risk my life to prevent that from happening,”
"I'm sure you talked with John Watson and is aware that I don't remember much about you. So tell me what I should know. What are you to me?" As if scripted. This must just be for his mental notes.
"You're so tight, so right for me," he grunts while moving his hips slowly, still letting John be accustomed to his length inside of him. A few groans were released from John's mouth as he forcefully pull Sherlock in for a lustful, deep kiss and giving love promises in the midst of moans and intelligible cries. His hands were pinned down to the sides of his head by Sherlock's strong grasp that doesn't budge even one iota.
They just came back from Scotland Yard after spending a whole night there, helping Lestrade finish up some paperwork because half of that had Sherlock to blame. He was too eager to catch the killer until he cause major casualties on the crime scene and he needed to settle all the paperwork to reason and clean up his name so he wont get any sentence for it.
With a glass of nearly finished scotch in his hand, he gestured the two men to the seat in front of him. "Please, have a seat". Both of them walked towards their respective seats, each with their own skeptical expression.
When his breathing became a lot more even, both of them calmed down greatly and Sherlock had seem to regain some life in him as well.
He didn't expect anyone else, to be honest, to come into the bathroom except Sherlock, but he was surprised nevertheless. He had his burgundy dressing gown hanging loosely around his bare torso with a pair of sweats.
After a long talk with Rosie, he had finally convinced her to go to the babysitter. Mainly because that he was going to a
be writing a letter to you when I can, though. Can't have you missing out on what I'm doing," he said with a spark of joy in his voice. But the motherly instinct in her knows more than to ignore the hint of sadness that comes with the perky voice.
His steps were furtive, slow but evenly paced. It stopped when a black car trailed him. 197 TPH. No doubt it's one of Mycroft's. The car wont stop unless he does, because that's just how it works between them. And as expected, the car braked when Sherlock turned to the car window, face blank and if it weren't for the dried blood on his nose and lips, some would say he looked rid of life.
"It's going to be alright. You said it yourself, and you're hardly ever wrong," John caressed Sherlock's soft curls and pulls him in for a hug, making soothing circles on his back.
. He had wasted two years worth of tears for a man who wasn't even buried under his own tombstone, two years of being so fucking stupid to believe someone he had cared about had died. Of course, Sherlock was as if a God of Mischief. He was
“I married Mary, because she helped me through the grieving period. Se kept me grounded and prevented me from doing uninmaginable things,”
For most people, the rays of sunshine peeking through the window and reflecting onto the wooden floors are the best part of waking up, accompanied by the smell of morning tea. But for Sherlock, it felt... blank. He knew there's feelings about waking up somewhere but above it all is a strong hollow feeling.It's unsettling. A part of him was relieved to wake up in comfort of a bed after for so long. But another part of him felt heavy, demotivated of everything. Like there's nothing he felt like he can do to perk up his own mood. And when he tried to figure out why, last night's incident just flashed in his mind. He regret thinking about it but no can do now.
Grunting, he's quickly planned a quick escape from the room under their noses. Thankfully he spent the time scanning the room earlier quite thoroughly. In the midst of planning and frowning as he eliminated options that would be insufficient to flee, the team was startled by the loud voice in their earpiece.
John couldn’t help himself from the thoughts alongside some self-loathing. He had asked Mrs Hudson to care for Rosie for the night and most probably the next day because he needed to settle whatever feud this was with Sherlock.
“It was already so painful, John. I don’t see why-” He sighed, hoping to end this conversation soon.
“John. You got what you want from me- a story. Now I want to hear yours. Tell me. Please,” John was starting to get very nervous. Of course he would be. How else would he feel when a flatmate of two or so years who died for two years was urging him to tell the forbidden truth he told himself all these years. The truth he took big measures to hide, even if its by the means of marrying the woman namely Mary Morstan.
“YOU FUCKING SHOULD BE! *sigh* John, I’m surprised you never register that any of what I did was for you. I died for you, I killed for you, and I’m broken for and by you. What do you fucking want?! I had done all of that because I thought you were actually the one that genuinely liked my peculiarities. The quality that had repelled so many others, I had honestly thought you liked me for me. Evidently I was so wrong. Maybe you’re just here for the fame, or maybe for the money or prizes we get after a solved case. I don’t even know, anymore. And I fucking hope I shouldn’t worry anymore because I’m just tired of all these bullshit, John. It’s like having literal years of my life wasted on someone who had only been holding off the word ‘freak’ because he had to! Maybe Mycroft was the one to convince you to not hurt my feelings or else you’d be incarcerated or something. Well guess, what John? No need to pretend anymore, because I’M DONE!” Sherlock had said all that with so much fear, anger and resignation, that it couldn’t be delivered as swift as his usual deductions. As he said, he was done.
He could hear someone calling his name repeatedly, but his body won’t budge and his gaze won’t move from John. He was so… scared if he walk away, John would be gone. They promised each other for a future together, no matter what happened. But if the ‘what happened’ was somewhere as painful as a death row, they can’t have a family together. Raise Rosie to be that brilliant and funny child that would resemble both of them. The ring on their finger won’t change into a marriage ring and- Eventually a calming touch on his shoulder had broken him from his long train of thoughts. John… wasn’t there. He was inside the ambulance, in too deep of thoughts, he had missed them taking John out of the van. His head snapped to the direction of the touch when he heard a child’s voice coming from the same direction.
It didn't take too long for the team outside to get a signal from Mycroft. They nodded to each other, a silent confirmation and quick double check about their action before one of them kicked the door in a hard slam, harder than what Sherlock anticipated. Sherlock, in attempt to avoid the door from hitting his face, jumped out of his hiding spot and straight into the centre of attention of the team assigned for his death. He kept his grip at both his weapons while glancing at the door to find it sealed by two armed men. Sighing, he made sure to make as little movement as possible, as all the target laser was all over him from the team's guns which efficiently surrounded him.
to tell you. I know you will not quite like them, but do keep in mind that I had no choice but to do this," he said this while looking utterly resigned.
Sherlock dragged a chair and placed it beside the bed for him to sit as close as he can with John, to make sure he’s there when John wakes up. Mrs. Hudson offered to distract Rosie for a bit and give Sherlock time to spend with John, although unconscious. He took John’s hand that was connected with the respiratory clip and intertwine their hands together.
John was awestruck after Mrs. Hudson explained about Sherlock leaving for missions after missions. And that forcing Mycroft to tell him of Sherlock's whereabout would be near to pointless, because Sherlock wont just be working under Mycroft alone, but the general British authorities. John felt like he was letting go one side of the rope, of the bond they both had. At first he thought Sherlock was the one to forcefully cut the rope off, and letting the rope hang tense single-handedly by John. But he never really registered the fact that even when falling off the rooftop, Sherlock was trying to keep his hand on it, and most probably also when he was off in some dungeon being tortured for information. A part of him, deep inside, was still blaming Sherlock for what he did, but it's not as overpowering anymore.
With whatever energy he still had, Sherlock did try to reach out to Greg with his shaking hand, managing to weakly grasp onto his lower arm with the cold fingertips. He was breathing heavily, and his chest hurt so much to the point he really wanted to be a child again, whining to his mother in pain as if he just fell and cut his knees. But no, he was clinging onto life, and he couldn't whine to Death of how he didn't want to go yet. His two verdigris eyes were scanning Greg over and over again, having to blink a few times because his focus kept going out.
Everything was a mess but he remembered one important thing; pain stimulated his memories. He exposed the needle of the reindeer brooch, and slowly but firmly press the sharp end to his skin, somewhere at the end of the JW carving he made. He dragged it down his skin to form a long line continuing from the end of the letter W. It was now a mix of W and M. Watson and Moriarty. He needed to remember
"Sherlock? Sherlock! Open the door!" Greg raised his voice to make sure it reached wherever Sherlock was on the other side, frantically turning the locked doorknob.
"Why not? It's what we do, isn't it? Just that I'm the one doing the job and you make sure I'm safe from a distance," he put one arm around Moriarty's shoulders and gave a soft pat, as if giving reassurance. He didn't know why Moriarty was making a fuss about him taking a job that would require him to fly to London at a moment's notice. At least not yet. He knew London was where his last sense of humanity resides for whom he thought was worthwhile completely moved on from his 'death'. Moriarty proved to him how much of an unimportant little presence he was in their lives, and so he decided he should move on from whoever the three person was. All he cared about around that time period onwards was to make Moriarty proud of how well he did in the job. It was the least but the best attention for him throughout his service.
John was now starting to tear up, because he could physically feel Sherlock slip away from him, that the man he loves the most in the world was fading from his life, and he himself was the very cause of it. He was too full of guilt to even realize that his eyes were watering. It wasn’t to fish for some sympathy but he saw how Sherlock’s eyes widen in disbelief and shock and he raised his hand to cover up his eyes.
"Why didn't you call me? You could talk to me," John asked gently as he rubbed Sherlock's shoulder when he saw how much he'd been shivering on the chair.
"I'm only telling the truth," he looked up from his microscope to see an aggravated expression plastered across John's face, so he raised one eyebrow in question as to why he's denying the truth he had spat out. All he got as a respond from John was a grunt when he turned around to leave the flat as quickly as he can, trying to flee from Sherlock's remarks.
?" Okay so it's settled that he was for sure going on a date with Sherlock. He seriously thought it was just the lack of knowledge for these kind of things for Sherlock that he used the term 'go out' but maybe he knew more than he expected.
"Get in, Sherlock. I know you were pushed down to the floor, and from your stance it's obvious that some of the wound might've been affected. Just, get it treated properly this time," he practically pleaded for Sherlock to do as he says. People who knows Sherlock would be well aware that he doesn't really like being treated by doctors, no matter how severe he was beaten, unless he couldn't treat it himself and a treatment is needed. But even that would cause a fuss in the hospital. Sherlock begrudgingly stepped in the car, but not making any more eye contact with anyone. He felt like this was defeat for him-not being able to do things on his own. The whole time in the car, the only voices that echo in the hollow vehicle was of Mycroft's. Asking, reassuring, and trying to pry any information out of Sherlock. Basically anything to get Sherlock, that includes annoying him.
"John is here to visit you, dear. Now come here, let me treat your wounds" she gushed Sherlock and motioned to the empty client chair in front of her. Sherlock wanted to refuse, and just delay the treatment to when John goes home. Spare himself the conversation. But then again, he could rub the guilt on John's face. At this point, he was so tired of everything, and wanted the bandage to wrap him tight, tighter than any hugs anyone would give him. Sherlock maintained a sharp eye contact with John as he walked over to Mrs. Hudson, sitting down and his back facing the lady.
“You… love me?” asked Sherlock, as if it was the most ridiculous statement he had ever heard in years.
"John is that you?" the soft, soothing voice of the landlady echoed through the corridor and heard up the stairs. John heard the sound of rustling plastic downstairs and he assumed his presence might've rushed the lady into putting her stuff away. She came up minutes later, face despondent. And that made John's stomach twist inside.
Sherlock was sitting on the hard plastic waiting chair outside the hospital rooms with Rosie sleeping on his lap, while Mrs. Hudson was calming him down and prepared to take shifts for Rosie. He was frantic. Absolutely frantic. Mrs. Hudson would squeeze his hand every few minutes to keep him from hyperventilating or getting panic attacks. That had helped a lot when the doctor finally approached them and asked for him.
"Sherlock Holmes is waiting for you, sir," John just scoffed at this. This must be Mycroft's tactic to get his attention, because anything of Sherlock always did. But he's not an idiot, so he walked faster, keeping a thought in mind.
"Yes, we are. Tell me why, Sherlock," now he's near pleading for a reason to why Sherlock is much more emotionally distant now towards the only person he had ever trusted enough to show his true self, his quirky side and his sweet side. He misses them a lot, even though he have Rosie now to occupy him with such behaviors but he just want to tear down the wall Sherlock had miraculously put up when John was in a way, neglecting him. Even in the hospital when they worked on the Culverton Smith's case, Sherlock was hesitantly playful towards him, and it hurts.
"Christ, Sherlock. What are you doing here?" John sounded very annoyed and worried, but more angry at him. Sherlock just pointed at the car he drove in that was stuck in the snow and John let him in the house which was thankfully warmer than the outside.
"Then we need to solve your problem then. Because someone seems very excited already to be examined thoroughly," he purposely end the sentence with his deep baritone that could have made John come on the spot. As obvious as this turn on was, Sherlock would want him to take it slow and be properly pleasured. As John runs his hand up and down Sherlock's back, the fly of his pants was opened and in mere seconds he was bare. Sherlock catalogued what he could in his mind of the rest of John's figure before aiming for John's nipple and latching himself there, sucking and flicking his tongue on it respectively and simultaneously rubbing John's dick. It seemed like the simple touch had John lost for words, actually lost for any voice to be sounded. Of course, this actually worries Sherlock a bit because if he was off to a good start perhaps John should have been more... noisy? Or at least some remarks or intelligible noises. He stops his hand movements and diverted his sight towards John through his raven eyelashes.
