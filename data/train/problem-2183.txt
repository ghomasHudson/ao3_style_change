, flickering between different experiments, web searches, tv channels, composing.  Then there were the crashes where nothing was of any interest at all.  His mind slowed and stagnated, until the only thing of comfort was to pluck listlessly at his violin and wait.  Just waiting.  Constantly waiting.  Repeat this rollercoaster cycle ad infinitum.
The Guard side of his brain, the one honed in combat, was decidedly not happy about something.  John scanned the scene again, trying to figure out the reason he was suddenly on edge.  He stretched out his left hand until the knuckles crunched, then scrunched his hand into a fist again.  In his right, he clutched his phone.  He stood straight and stilled, as if he could slow down the world for easy viewing like the footage earlier so long as he stopped too.  The buildings opposite had fronts of glass so no symbol there.  But his gaze kept on jumping over something, as if there was a glitch, a jump cut just behind the railings that surrounded the stairs to the tube.  What
Scruffy was the main descriptor.  His shaggy brown hair was in desperate need of some scissors, his two-piece tracksuit was frayed on the sleeve cuffs and there were had holes in the knees and elbows.  He was sat hunched, tilting forward with his cuffed hands clasped together.  All in all, he could have been here for possession or a bust-up in a pub, something low level that would go on a record but not worth an arrest over.  His eyes betrayed his purpose however.  They were sharply focussed.  They were also unerringly staring at Sherlock.  John glanced over to the switch, but it was stuck firmly on the mirror charm setting.  A lucky guess then.  Maybe murderously glaring was just his default setting.
.  If he said something and the Fallen happened to be there, then he could get in trouble and John couldn’t let go of him just yet.
) and either the chase would begin or Sherlock would sulk all day about the lack of imaginative crimes until the process repeated itself the next morning.  If no people emerged then it was up to emails and texts and badgering every known detective at Scotland Yard, and if
“Well he does love his own appearance.  A bit like a parrot come to think of it,” Victor swivelled to look at Sherlock thoughtfully.
Backtrack.  BACKTRACK.  His mind screamed at him to come up with something, anything to get them out of this situation.
John laughed, squeezing the arm that was around Sherlock in an adaptation of a hug.  “I’d love to go.  Maybe I’ll get to know your friends a bit better yeah?  See what you get up to on all these night’s out.”  Look, he was being supportive and everything.
“Either John is there or Moriarty.  If it’s John, excellent.  If it is Moriarty he needs to pay for what he’s done.”
“Sherlock?!” John shouted.  “Sherlock are you alright?”  The detective had been thrown back by the blast and was laid out on the floor.  He was, however, still conscious, as proved by his head rolling over to look at John.  The grey eyes looked up at him, a little dazed, but soft around the edges.
John gasped for breath, the energy gone, the sense of spiralling fading away until he was fully back in reality.
He fell asleep with the feel of John’s humming an unrecognisable tune in his ear, John’s hands stroking his back.
John laughed and Sherlock’s insides practically glowed (both from the laugh and from the alcohol).  “Well it’s like a wise man once told me.  People do little else.”
“Tidied up for me?” John said, nodding around them.  Even more of the room had been restrained, and John could see his books had been piled onto the shelves, Fleming leaning on Antoine Lavoisier, old medical journals falling onto Newgate novels.
Tall was John’s first impression.  The figure was stood, straight-backed, unflinching, which made him seem towering.  That and the ridiculous coat, a woollen, flowing, swishy coat.  His next impression was the phrase “Tall, Dark, and Handsome,” only for a moment before he remembered he was a professional on a job and he should not be checking out a shadowy stranger in an alleyway while he was trying to scare off some stupid kids.
John started forward, quickly breaching the distance and Sherlock braced himself for the punch that would surely follow. It was to be expected really. It was only fair.
), John had to stop himself from sighing in relief.  This was what he’d been missing.  Sherlock was amazing but it was difficult to keep up with his rapid fire mind sometimes and to actually talk openly with him.  With his new classmates, he didn’t know any of the well enough to go and talk to them, never mind the fact they had no idea he wasn’t 100% human.  All he needed was a friend who understood where he had come from and what he was trying to say without him even needing to say it.  Of course, with his luck, it just so happened that that person happened to be many miles away and only reachable at certain times due to both their schedules being taken over by either work or university but you couldn’t have everything.  John felt this understanding of one another was emphasised when Greg switched from joking about John’s old crushes to a very serious:
He dragged his phone out of his left coat pocket, huffing again to ensure Mrs Hudson knew just how much of an ordeal she was asking of him.  It was Molly.  His interest was stirred slightly.  Perhaps there was an interesting body in the morgue that might possibly be worth looking at, if he could be bothered of course.
“It’s a flamingo,” she said, waving it above her head to show the yellow beak poking out of the feathers.
John had to say he was still curious, both about the car and about Sherlock’s plan to get him speaking again.
Sherlock coughed through the dust.  He stayed still for a moment, until his ears had stopped ringing.  As far as he could tell he wasn’t substantially injured.  A few cuts and bruises.
“We checked them first, found nothing.  It’s only this gym that these victims have come from so we’re guessing it’s a localised operation, probably from within the gym itself.  We want you to find whoever’s responsible for this.”
Of course, this was John and Sherlock.  They could make all the decisions and agreements they wanted, hell they could even plan everything down to the exact hour and day.  Their lives and temperaments however would simply do as they damn well pleased, not minding the good intentions of our earnest pair.  And
“One has to take all the small pleasures life offers us Sherlock.  Now, unless you’d like to spend the rest of your life in my spare room, I suggest you open your eyes so you can begin.”
He wasn’t only angry, though it was in his voice.  Panic.  Overwhelmingly panic, like he was about to bolt at any moment.  The hand that wasn’t clutching tea kept on clenching.  This would require some quick deescalating.
“Never better,” he said jokingly.  He groaned as he heaved himself up, first onto his elbows, and then upright.
Lestrade stared at Sherlock.  All their lives would be made much simpler by him believing Sherlock’s story but he believed his work was about more than taking the simpler option.
“What, with this wing?” John pointed at it.  It was a delicate thing and being crumpled up would hurt at the best of times, never mind every other week, and he grimaced at the thought. “Are you jealous?”
“That…was incredible,” John said in awe, a smile creeping over his face as he processed Sherlock’s rapid-fire words.
Sherlock took pity on him and added gently, “I’ll be fine John.  Go to work, I’ll text you when I’m done.”
John shuffled in his chair, oddly ruffled.  “I just think you haven’t given yourself enough credit.”  There was something about having Sherlock smile at him that made him feel odd.  Happy but odd.  “So you’re going to stop lounging around and get on with something productive.  Set the curtains on fire.  Re-draw your internal map of Thai restaurants in a 100 mile radius.  Learn to paint.”
“What is the project?  You seem reluctant to talk about it so I’m assuming it is personal which then makes me question why you would need
Molly squeaked and John realised she was still there, as wrapped up in Sherlock’s mutterings as he had been.  Her cheeks turned red and they looked at her, and her eyes skittered away, over to the clock on the wall.  She stood up.
quicker than Broadgate and John couldn’t help the thrill he felt as he vigilantly and carefully made his way over to work.
“You weren’t there.”  Sherlock didn’t say it as an accusation, it was merely a statement of fact, a request for a why.
"I have.  I just wanted to see if you have been listening," Sherlock said and looked at him.  Sherlock had been extoling the powers of observation at him for weeks.  They were stood so close John could see the different shades in Sherlock's eyes, even in the dim light.  Sherlock looked way, cheeks flushing a light pink.  John also looked back at the photos hurriedly.
Self-conscious, John’s mind supplied.  Stupid.  “Oh, no, these are fantastic,” John reassured.  “It’s just were nearly out of time and I have to put all this back.”  Although he would deny it if John were to ask, he could see Sherlock’s shoulders relax slightly.
People were definitely staring now.  They locked eyes for a moment before Sherlock’s lips twitched and John laughed at how ridiculous they must look.  Sherlock looked away, as if blocking his own huff of a laughter.
“Oh, you’re bad are you?  I can work with bad.”  In one movement, he was attacking Sherlock’s mouth, dragging in his tongue to suck on, while his hand moved to finally,
“He kept to himself,” she began.  “Quiet you know?  I find it very strange.  I was telling this to Gladys, she lived next door, lovely woman, moved in with a man last summer-”
“Never too busy for true love.”  He was going to argue with her but then remembered the vial in his pocket.  “Plus, we owe you.  Consider our debt repaid.”  Her voice echoed up the high ceilings.  The cellar was as grand as the rest of the house but empty apart from Lestrade and a portal.
“- They instruct you in what to do and your terrified they’re going to kill you.  Boss seems as good a word as any.”
“It’s just until we’ve found the other Fallen’s.  Then we can re-open it and you can go find them.  We can even get the system back up.”
to happen, whatever it was.  After a while, every time his master past the coffee table he stroked Gladstone’s fur soothingly.  He was happy to help.  Perhaps he could convince his master tummy rubs would also help?
Lestrade nodded.  “Understood.  But you can’t live on this decimated platform forever.  Mainly because now, it’s technically a crime scene.  Come on,” he said, holding out a hand.  Gently, Lestrade pulled him up and frowned at his now bleeding hand.  “We’ll get that sorted out too.”
“Don’t you dare.”  He had not gone through several elaborate shenanigans, only to be stopped now.  “It’s just-  Well I’ve never-”  John’s eyes lit up with understanding.  Now he was thinking about it, he probably should have mentioned this earlier.
“S’not nice.”  On the one hand, it was concerning that Sherlock was so affected.  On the other hand, this was going to be perfect blackmail material later on.  Or maybe just something to tease him about when he was more lucid.
“I think I’ve made my thoughts on the powers quite clear.  And you’re going to make it up to me,” Sherlock said smirking.
John looked back into his eyes.  He didn’t have chance to think as John yanked him forwards and crushed their lips together.
It's unedited and it may feel a little rushed in terms of wrapping things up but it's finished and if you've got any questions about it, ask or I've made some glaring errors, please tell me.
It had taken time but gradually he made progress towards stopping the spiralling thoughts.  He’d had to learn to ignore the slight disappointed vibes from his dad which made his heart clench every time he even thought about it but overall by mid-spring he was definitely better than he had been.  That’s when he found photography.  He’d been out for a walk because that’s what people had said might help and the thought of spending another moment in the house had gone from feeling like a sanctuary to feeling like he was being trapped in a huge box.  There were few green spaces in his area of London so it was quite a way to the nearest park but when he finally arrived it felt like a run-down, glass covered oasis.  He wandered until he was near the small pond on the far side.   Just by the water, he watched as a small train of ducks veer their way wildly to the pond, somehow managing to skate around it without actually ever getting into the water.  His lips twitched and stopped.  He actually felt something.  Nothing overpowering, nothing wild but...something.  He was struck with the need to remember this moment.  That’s when he took his first photo.   Nothing wild, just a small snap of the ducks on an overcast day in a city park.
“Alright so we’ve got most of the information but, as you can probably guess from the lack of actual arresting going on, we haven’t found the perpetrator yet.  Usually we wouldn’t look into this in depth but with the number of people who all linked and the fatalities we do actually need to intervene.  You read the full report after your breaking and entering yeah?”
Lestrade laughed shortly.  “Unfortunately not.  I’ve contacted everyone we know, no one had seen him since you this morning.  But we’ll find him.”
Sherlock dismissed the not-John.  Now that his brain was back online, it was shuffling the strands back into order and rising again to a fever pitch.  He needed more information.  Data.  Input.  There were too many variables at play and too much he didn’t know and each fact he didn’t
It was only a quiet “Sherlock” that broke the spell and he jerked back, blinking out of his revive. “I have informed him of your return, as per your request.”
They fell quiet as the car moved through the empty streets.  In the back of the car, lulled by the movement, Sherlock fell asleep again.  His head still rested on John’s shoulder, face slack, snoring softly, totally at ease.  John looked out of the window but his hand remained a comforting presence around Sherlock’s middle, wing still protecting him.  Lestrade pretended not to notice how similar this was to another scene he viewed recently.  Idiots, the pair of them.
"I do remember.  You split acid on the counter top because the volleyball team walked past the window.  It saved me from being kicked out."  Why Sherlock remembered this but did not know the current Prime Minister, John could not answer.
While John was distracted ruffling the dogs ears, Sherlock took him in.  Ignoring the fact that the first thing his mind screamed was 'cute', the next thing was military.  But what was a soldier doing walking dogs in Marylebone?
There was some truth behind this statement.  Greg Lestrade, Senior Guard and technically John’s boss somewhere in the hierarchy of things, was under the distinct impression John didn’t have any friends (true) and had taken it upon himself to change this (unprompted).  A trip to a crime scene was apparently a stepping stone in a long-winded plan that began with friendly hello’s by the water cooler, and would eventually end up with
That, of all things, was the bit that widened the man's eyes and made him step away. He looked over Martin in the strange man's body one more time and said "My god. You're telling the truth."
"I know you are.  Running yourself into the ground isn't going to make things any better.  Phillip and Moira are counting on you." John turned to go upstairs.  To his surprise, Sherlock followed him; apparently he wasn't going to be spending the night downstairs.
"Sherlock," was all he said, but it brought him back to reality and his eyes lost the glassy look.  Sherlock got up and went upstairs, returning in a few minutes with both Hamish and his laptop.  He sat down at the table, Hamish on one side and the laptop in front of him, but he didn't look to be doing anything in particular.  John changed the station to one playing a football game, even though the news had already gone off the air.
"No.  You're on the witness list but you aren't going to be called.  You wouldn't offer any testimony that wouldn't be duplicated by other victims or witnesses."
Recalling the conversation he'd had with Mr. Rodgers moments before, John said "It's okay if you have mixed feelings about the plea."
"He sought me out to say it, even though he didn't know that I wouldn't just turn him into the police."
"Well, yeah, but I saw what it did to my mum and other people. I'm not thick, I know better than to mess with all that." His brown eyes bored into Sherlock as he spoke.
"The eleven year old should know the truth, I think," Mari commented. "If your wife's okay with telling them that. The others are really too young. Tell them she's sad because of some things she's remembering."
"No, of course not. K won't know we've talked. Thank you, Moira." Sherlock emerged from the room. He looked paler than usual, although it was hard to tell. "Come along, John," he said as he walked down the hallway. They returned in the kitchen where Mr. Aherne was still waiting, his other two children now eating a biscuit each. To John's surprise, he thrust a plate of biscuits wrapped in plastic at Sherlock.
"Did you ever tell them what you told us about that room before?"  Clark said "that room" in a way that left it obvious what he was omitting from the sentence.
"Good." He gestured for them to leave his office. John was perfectly aware of both the fact Sherlock had told Phillip about his past experience and that he undoubtedly knew he had just told Lestrade as well. He figured that Sherlock wouldn't want to talk and would go home and brood, so he said nothing as they went back to Baker St.
"I was thinkin' it was you." Sherlock opened his eyes a bit. From the cold and lack of light, it had to be the evening. "That stuff's gonna kill you."
John could only manage to be shocked for a second or two, because Lou once again spoke.  "Do you remember when you saw her next?"
"No further questions."  Clark shuffled back to the defense table.  Harvey smiled at him; John wondered if that little bit of doubt was really enough to make her happy.
"Let me go!  It hurts!  Let me go!"  Sherlock stared blankly into space as he struggled, like a sleepwalker.  "Please just stop!"
Of course, when he got to the room and shut the door, Martin suddenly had no desire to read.  He had even less desire to go back into the sitting room and make awkward small talk, so he just flopped down on the bed and stared at the ceiling.  He might know why the Comet failed so often in its first years, or the instrument panels of  sixteen types of aircraft, but he had no idea how to solve this.  Eventually he fell into an uneasy sleep.
"Oh, yes, I remember that case.  There were some signs of sexual abuse on the exam, mostly reduced rectal tone and a patent vagina.  Father claimed she'd said a lewd phrase to him, which made him come to the A&E with her.  There was a custody battle at the time as well, with the mother."  He seemed pleased he remembered that much, almost like he wanted to get credit from Sherlock for this.
Sherlock then came to sit in the chair Mr. Aherne had been sitting in. He took in the framed photograph at her bedside and asked "Is your dog allowed to sleep in your bed, or does he have to sleep on the floor of your room?"
"Are you all right?" Eli asked John. Eli always took the time to check in with each group member individually.
Harvey looked surprised, as if she couldn't tell what Phillip had said would help her client or not.  "Did you tell him what it was like?"
Harvey looked frustrated.  "Did you know that Mr. Holmes had been previously associated with who your daughter had picked out of the lineup?"
"Are you sure he was referring to sexual abuse in his remark?" Of course Sherlock would ask that. He had said a few days ago people always assume, and it was apparent that he was trying not to.
"She put Her hand down my jogging bottoms and rubbed between my legs.  It felt hot and it was kind of nice but I didn't know if I liked it."  Moira wasn't crying anymore, but the sobs in the audience had only gotten louder.  "Then She said I was definitely a girl.  Said that you could smell it and She smelled the fingers on that hand.  Then She asked me if that felt good.  I said yes because it kind of did and maybe if I said it did She'd be my first friend in London.  She told me that if I came back the next day I'd get a surprise."  Even though John had heard it all before, he still got a lump in his throat.
"I pretended to be ill and stayed home from school.  Then I went to Sherlock's house.  I thought about telling my parents or even the police, but I didn't want to break that promise I had made.  I thought it would be the easiest to just tell his mother, like I had said he should.  So I went to her house and knocked on the door.  She took one look at me and asked what I wanted.  I asked her if she knew Dr. Martin, and she said she did, that one of her son's was friends with her.  I asked her if he spent a lot of time with her, and she said yes.  Then she asked if he'd gotten himself hurt again, and I said 'not really' and then I told her that she'd been assaulting him for years and I didn't think he should spend time with her anymore."
"We won't be here long," Susan said.  "I don't want to take up too much of your weekend.  Just wanted to go over a few things."  She looked over at Sherlock, who looked warily back.  "When you met the accused, you were..."
"That's probably a good idea for now. Tea?" John figured someone had to be hospitable here, and he'd just heated up a kettle full of water.
John sat up straighter as Mrs. Bena began to speak.  "Michael and I separated because he didn't approve of my drug use.  You see, after Jennifer was born I felt awful and I wasn't working.  It didn't seem to lift up at all, until almost a year after she was born.  A friend of mine gave me something she said would help me feel better.  MDMA, but I didn't know that then.  It did make me feel better, and at first I could get out of bed again and take care of my daughter.  Some of my friends came over again, and they all were using too, and before I knew it I was caught up in using whenever I could.  Michael came home to find me out of it too many times and he left and took Jennifer with him.  We went to court and we each got her alternating weeks.  I was happy he wasn't starting a row with me every evening.  But since he had been the one that was working I was left with no money for anything.  I got on benefit but so many things ate that up I had nothing left over for the drugs.  You have to understand that back then I would have chosen the drugs over my daughter; there was no contest.  Then one day I was at the supermarket and I didn't have enough for groceries.  This woman behind me took her card and paid for it with her own groceries, and she asked if I lived nearby.  I said I did and we left together.  She asked me how old my children were. I always bought a lot of food Jennifer liked, spaghetti hoops and things like that, because I did - do - love her, and I suppose she guessed from my shopping.  I told her that Jennifer was three, and showed her a picture I carried with me of her.  I said she wasn't at my flat, because she was with her father.  We talked about the separation and once we got to my flat she came upstairs with me.  It was nice to talk to someone who wasn't going on about how much I owed them.  Eventually the conversation came around to money.  I said it was hard to get by, and she first asked me how much Michael gave me.  I said none, because he wasn't making a lot then and he probably spent more on Jennifer than I did."  She paused to look at Susan, as if she needed permission to finish.  "I told her I was on benefit, and she asked me if there was anything I had trouble buying.  It sounds hard to believe, but I really did say, 'Crack.'  I wasn't thinking clearly, and all of my stuff was gone so I'd been looking for a few days.  She looked at me and then said I looked like I was coming off something.  Then she said that she had a lot of money, and would be willing to help me.  All I'd have to do is let her spend time with Jennifer, an hour or two at most.  For that I'd get two hundred pounds for every hour.  She didn't actually say what she and Jennifer would do for that time, but she said, 'She's a good-looking girl,' when she explained it and I knew what she meant from the look on her face.  Hungry-looking.  All I could think of was how much easier my life would be with the money and I said yes."
“I mean, what. Do. I. Do?  How do I not mess this up?”  Sherlock thought he had been explicitly clear.
“You ready?” John asked him, mischief in his eyes, but before Sherlock could ask he was suddenly falling through the air onto his bed.  He was about to protest but John giggled and crawled on top of him, capturing his lips again.  They awkwardly wriggled up the bed which had them both laughing at the ridiculousness of it, until they were actually on the bed properly.  Sherlock rocked up from the bed and they lazily rubbed against each other, John teasingly backing off when Sherlock’s gasps grew ragged.
There was a pause after this.  Sherlock seemed to be struggling to say something, his mouth opening and closing as the words refused to come out.  Clearly they were at the crux of the conversation.  It looked like he was going to give up entirely when he finally choked out: “He seems...happy?  Now?”  He was staring resolutely out the window now, not the focus of before but the determined stare of someone ignoring absolutely everything surrounding him.
.  That’s how I work.  It’s not some external Power bestowed to me.  It’s mine, I learnt it.”  The words flowed rapidly, pent up frustration flooding out, in the same even tone as before.
their new landlady was nosier than Mrs Hudson and kept flittering about the flat at the most inopportune times, and yes it was lovely she was helping keep the space clean but John had a day free and there were no cases and please for the love of everything, woman, take the hint.
Sherlock. No, let me finish," he shook Sherlock's head slightly as he opened his mouth to interrupt. "But I waited. I didn't have to, but I did and at times I wondered why but somewhere, somehow I knew. I knew you’d come home, would come back to me, and now you're here and-" he paused, a look of revelation in his eyes. "And I want you. Right here, right now.  If you’ll let me."
“Hang on,” said Sherlock, as he shuffled over, one hand stabilised on the floor, the injured one still raised in the air.
The angel’s head shot up at the sound, startled at the sudden noise.  His mouth fell open slightly, mirroring Sherlock’s own surprise.  They stayed locked in their positions.  Sherlock couldn’t force himself to move, or blink, or breathe.  All he could do was look.  Look and wait and hope, hope ferociously that he wasn’t dreaming, that this was real and John was here and it wasn’t a dream, it wasn’t...
Molly sounded resigned.  “Look, we’re all just worried about you.  Stop being a baby.  Anyway, there was a legitimate reason for me knowing about your case, if you must know.  I’m a member of the gym and was just wondering if you wanted someone to go with you who actually knew the place and instructors.”
“Bit nicer than my flat,” John said from behind him.  In his haste to sequester John away in the flat away from prying eyes, he hadn’t realised his focus had left John trailing him.  He didn’t seem to mind though, looking around at what he could see in the shadows created by the streetlights.
John pulled back however and that cheeky grin from yesterday was back as Sherlock whined.  He slipped out of bed with the words “Shower before breakfast?” as if they’d just been discussing it, as if it was a foregone conclusion they’d spend the day together.
There was a clatter of something downstairs and both paused.  John gathered energy in his fingertips, just in case.  Silence.  Carefully, Sherlock began backing towards the other side of the room.  John hesitated.  He looked at Sherlock who locked eyes and nodded slightly.
“Oh no.  That’s not what I meant by not friendly, I mean sure it’d be nice to get a decent conversation now and again but I don’t think anyone’s malicious, or at least I don’t know of anyone-“
Sherlock would never admit it but it was slightly more difficult than usual to walk the 20 minutes home.  It wasn’t his fault.  It was the pavement’s fault.  It kept moving.  So did the stairs.  So did the lock on the door. Also the other stairs.  The world was off today.
“The fact you sound surprised wounds me you know.  I’ll text you my timetable and you can turn up to a few of the classes, get to know the staff.  I’m warning you now, some of it’s pretty intense.”
A deal seemed to be have been silently struck that they would not get completely rat-arsed this time and stick to the job in hand.  Rogue Fallen’s on killing sprees and all that.  Probably best to have their wits about them.  Probably not good to get drunk and snog your flatmate while society-threatening chaos descended around you.  Sherlock had even deigned to wear a looser shirt and John was wearing the jeans he’d had on all day, rather than changing into the tighter pair he was wearing yesterday.  They ordered drinks at the bar but Sherlock didn’t touch his own and John was sipping his so slowly he might as well have asked for a tap water for the effect it would have on him.
“Yes, I’ve been up and down all day.  Figured I’d actually tidy seeing as neither of you were ever going to.” She paused before continuing, gently. “You haven’t found our John then I take it?”
“I missed you too.  So much.  But we’re here now.  We’re both here now.”  Sherlock couldn’t do anything else but nod as he allowed himself to be soothed.
.  As the mystery unravelled itself he was trying to keep pace with Moriarty and try to get John out of the fatal energy buzzing around him, and for that he needed more
“Hey you,” John said, eyes not leaving the page but a hand running up to ruffle Sherlock’s hair and pressing a kiss to the top of his head.  For a moment Sherlock let himself soak up the sweetness of it.  However, as John continued to only partially pay attention to him, it was time for some more direct action.  He began by slowly moving his hand across John’s stomach, ostensibly to cuddle closer.  Then, he moved his hand up and down John’s side, rubbing his head slightly.
“Oh no. No no noooo no.  Terrible Boy Scout.  Accidently set fire to everything.  And tried to keep the frogs we found.”  John couldn’t help laughing, imagining a mini-Sherlock, all riotous hair and pleading eyes, trying to smuggle his quarry back to camp.
The reason for secrecy was fairly simple: they didn’t want to deal with the pressure of people knowing yet.  As they had seen in several high profile cases, the demands of the press and sometimes even just family on a relationship could cause severe strain on a relationship which they didn’t want to inflict on their fledging romance.  Also, the press had regained interest in both their lives after the ups and downs of the Moriarty case, and the failure (read: betrayal and utter destruction) of John’s marriage.  So, they kept quiet.  No other people, no other pressures, no one asking questions or jokes.  Just the two of them in a wonderful little bubble.  Easy.
Sherlock nodded, having retreated into his mind.  When John wandered to the kitchen, Sherlock trailed him before moving over to his chair.
“Not trying to imitate no.  This?  This is the original.”  He emphasised his words by taping on the engraved name plate affixed to the the door.  John read it with sinking horror.
The puzzle that had kept Victor occupied while he wandered around the freezing cold park was why.  Why had he disappeared?  He’d been acting a bit odd at yesterday’s party (well, what Victor could remember of the party anyway) and Sherlock had lost him for a while until he was spotted chatting to another group of people.  Between then and now Sherlock had somehow managed to lose his beloved and was now frantically running around with a search size the area of the entirety of London.  Now if you asked Victor, John had probably either a) gone out for something or b) was passed out on someone else’s floor but as a good friend here he was, wandering round a freezing park and-
When his professional brain set in, his impression of the stranger was ‘Oh Shit.’  Because there was a
.  One of the few certainties of the total termination of existence had always been the lack of feeling at all, physical or otherwise.
“And you could never leave London.”  Fact.  London was chaotic and noisy and brutal, but it could also be calm and quiet and home.  John reminded him of the city, why he loved it, and the energy rolling off of him was matched by hum of London.
She was holding his cane which he had dropped when the adrenaline had kicked in and it had rolled down the alley in his short tussle.
There was also a text from Molly that was 80% emojis of hearts and confetti that was something resembling a good luck message.  Sherlock was sure it was not going to be the only one he received that day.  No word from John however.  Was that weird?  Was he supposed to message?  Or was Sherlock supposed to initiate as John was the one that asked him out?  Or were they not supposed to talk at all before seeing each other?  Or was
John tried not to swear.  “When are we going?” he asked tightly.  He wanted to do some errands today, the toaster giving him some direction of purpose.  This desire to procrastinate increased at the prospect of another night like the previous.
“Well there we are then.  Drive yourself mad with hypotheticals or get some solid answers and then head back here when you’re ready.”
“Our friend Jake lives here.  Well used to anyway.  2 days ago he came home from work to find this, went straight over to stay at Oli’s.  There was no note, no message, nothing.  I told him you might be able to help us find out who did this and why,” Victor explained.
For the past two years, they had met every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.  Wednesday was rugby practice and John didn’t mention that he saw Sherlock hiding behind the trees across the field, still sketching away.  Because of this, Sherlock didn’t mention that he saw John sitting outside his Friday labs with a sketchbook in his hand or the glances tracking Sherlock’s movements as he moved around the classroom.
John outright giggled at that.  Sometimes he was shocked by how much he loved this man.  It wasn’t that he could ever forget but most of the time it was kept just the right side of overwhelming.  This was not one of those times.
As people rushed out, he hung back, not fancying being trampled underfoot.  This meant the room was fairly empty when
Sherlock made a ‘tsk’ noise, focus now entirely on the screen.  “Now let’s see if you’ve been clever,” he muttered under his breath, as he navigated to the right system.  Started his search at Baker Street.  His breath caught as he saw John stepping out the front door.  He knew he’d been in trouble, knew that John had been embroiled in this since the beginning for reasons he couldn’t work out and still he’d let him leave.  If only he’d been watching, paying attention this morning, then maybe...
“Of course I do John, stop worrying,” Sherlock dismissed him with a wave while hitting the button for the 34
John scoffed.  “You’re not one now.  Not even close.  But you care about other beings, deep, deep down.  That counts for something.”
“No squatters, no rubbish, no graffiti.”  The three tenants of the abandoned building.  “This place is literally a blank canvas.”
“Yes, hello.”  Now he was in Sherlock’s presence he had apparently forgotten how to talk.  Luckily Sherlock didn’t seem to be listening, already striding towards the door.
.  Languid, loose and yet graceful, rolling from one movement to the next.  He was in control but compelled by the beat.  Although John knew he was looking, always looking, it seemed as if Sherlock was entirely unaware of his surroundings, as if they’d melted away into the generic music.
“John.”  Victor winced.  How could one voice contain so much relief, so much happiness when it was tainted with so much hurt that it sounded broken?  Hell, John had only been missing for one morning; Victor couldn’t imagine what would happen if something worse was to ever happen.
“Yes.  But I’m not interested in any of your usual crimes,” Sherlock said, dropping the charade.  “I have just one question.  Why take us to the warehouse?”  Dimitri frowned so Sherlock continued.  “The who is obviously you, when and where are already clear, what would have happened is probably something horrific and also boring, but what remains odd is the
When she had left, muttering under her breath, he texted John.  Sometimes you just had to listen to your landlady.  Mainly because he was worried she would genuinely kick him out if he did not.
He was slightly disappointed then, when they pulled up outside Bart's.  Although he was sure it was a lovely place, the only challenges there would be intellectual ones, and Sherlock had that base covered.
In the end, much to the disappointment of many, it wasn’t any of the teams combined efforts which revealed Sherlock’s secret but the man himself.
Even on foot it didn’t take them long to get to St Barts.  The basement floor was busier than earlier.  There were a few other professionals gathered in the break-room and some of the classrooms were in use.  They must have been quite the sight, with several people moving out of their way swiftly and staring.  Molly had taken over a desk in one of the classrooms, and was carefully guarding it, glaring at people who came too close.
There was a fleeting, brilliant moment about two weeks in, when Sherlock was searching for John.  Sherlock was always searching for John, because he was constantly having to interact with his brother, and this meant he required attention before Mycroft was set on fire for being an annoying git.  Luckily, John was in his room, sat reading some presumably boring document on his bed, and Sherlock threw himself dramatically next to him, curling up into John, head resting on his chest.
He paused in the doorway, savouring the familiarity. The way the street looked shrouded in shadows, the distant hum of traffic, the smell of pastry and cigarette smoke which never really left Speedy’s awning. Depending on how this meeting went he could very well be back to experience it all again in a few moments but hopefully it wouldn’t come to that. Mycroft had not explicitly offered him a room but it was implied.  Whatever happened from this moment on, his brother would not allow him to spend any more time on the streets. However the longing for his own bed was strong. It was an odd one considering his disdain for sleeping in general but, he supposed, being on the run changes a person whether they wanted it to or not.
“Yes, he is.  Has been the entire time I’ve known him.  And the wings, they don’t change any of what I said.  I would still choose to be here.”
“Surprise baby,” John replied.  Irene and Victor exchanged a Look as they backed away from the door.  “Baby?” Victor mouthed but Irene could only shrug as they retreated to the kitchen.
“Big Day,” she said as he approached.  He shrugged.  He was also not expecting her to punch his arm.
Neither boy could meet the other’s eye, each trying to control their blushing so the other didn’t see.
“Oh come on John,” Sherlock said, with a small smile on his face.  “You’re not a Guard.  Not really.  Not one of them at any rate.”
He lolled his head to the side.  There was no other word for it.  John looked smug as hell.  All-out 100% blissfully fucking smug.
Sherlock was stood on the road, rocking back and forth on his heels and scanning the road for something.  Instead of heading towards the café next door, Sherlock led him a few streets away to a coffee shop where they sat in the window, John with a large latte and Sherlock with an Americano he didn’t touch.  As they walked in, Sherlock’s wings drew attention but either he didn’t notice the stares or, more likely he didn’t care.  John was not thrilled about the attention and sat facing the door.  He supposed now would be a good time to question why he was being shadowed.
, the heading declared boldly and underneath were photos of a range of students all collaged together, like a more realistic version of a university brochure.  He recognised a few of them, but that wasn’t what made him stop.  His face was front and centre, his photo one of the larger ones in the piece.  He’d expected John to use one of the more serious takes, but instead, his lips were curled up in a rare, genuine smile, eyes crinkled at the sides with laugh lines.  Was he really
“No,” Sherlock said slowly, drawing out the o.  John hated this stupid guessing game charade they had to go through but it made Sherlock happy to show off he was the cleverest in the room.  Or driveway.
.  It was only as he walked down the street that his paranoia kicked back in and he reassessed if he had actually been talking to Mrs Hudson at all.  Either way, they had certainly captured her mannerisms and had given him his marching orders.  He was certain John, and answers, were not in the flat.  That left him with one more solution.
Sherlock was so focussed on the task of getting John out of the restaurant and onto the nearest flat surface that he didn’t even stop to be annoyed at the knowing wave and wink Angelo gave them as they raced out of the restaurant, although a small part of him thanked the universe that his bill was, as ever, waived by the owner.
“Sherlock!” John shouted.  The Fallen stopped dead, drew himself up, and stalked out the door.  John followed closely on his heels, with an apologetic grimace to Lestrade and Miss Lincoln.  He was sure Lestrade could handle the fallout.
Sherlock took over the conversation once more.  “Lunch I think.”  And there he was off again, causing John to wonder if Sherlock ever stood still for longer than a minute.  He looked bemused at Mrs Hudson who patted his shoulder and was still trying not to laugh.
After the second time, this time in Sherlock’s bed due to a) the state of John’s and b) its closer proximity to the kitchen, both of them lay snuggled together, much like the way they’d stated the morning.  John was just about to let sleep drag him under, eyes shut, lulled by Sherlock’s slowly steadying breaths and the feel of Sherlock’s hair threaded through his fingers, when Sherlock spoke.
John’s hands came up to bury themselves in what was left of his hair, slowly as if to savour it, his eyes looking up to follow as the curls flowed around his fingers.
2) Sorry about the gap between posting- these last chapters weren't written before I started uploading and then I got carried away and uploaded the first 3 too quickly so there's going to be a bit of a wait (like a few days)
Back in the car was much less comfortable but he still had Sherlock’s presence which would have to do.  He tensed at first, when an arm slid up around his back, in front of his wings and onto his shoulder, until the hand started kneading in a motion similar to his own.  Sherlock was not looking at John and John did not dare look at Sherlock.  It was fine.  Sherlock was just helping.  He wasn’t even sure if Sherlock was aware of it, or if it had just been an unconscious volunteering.  Anyway, there wasn’t really room for him to cross his own arm over to massage his shoulder and it did help with the pain a bit, so really this was a medical procedure, if you think about it.
, John started his medical studies to become qualified as a Doctor because apparently one could not just say they already had several years experience on the frontlines of the biggest war known in the cosmos because “they won’t believe me Sherlock, now go away and stop distracting me.”  This meant that any moment John was not helping Sherlock on cases or filling his time with human concerns like shopping or laundry, was dominated with pouring over textbooks and muttering processes under his breath.
, John started, adrenaline flooded his body, and his hands tingled with powers that could heal and hurt.  So, when Sherlock burst through the doors with a shout of “John?” it was both fortunate that John was prepared to answer the call, and unusual in the sense he needed to respond.  In fact, the abrupt change in routine made John even more agitated as he sprang up from his chair and whirled round to face him.
She dropped the makeshift weapon and started to smile before actually looking at them and scowling.  It wasn’t clear whether it was from concern for them or for her lab.  “What is it?”
Sherlock was about to agree he was being illogical when instead he said, “I never said what I needed this for.”
It was true that people “woke up” in heaven but this was not instantaneous, as many people presume.  Therefore, in the period of time between dying on earth and waking up in heaven, it was the job of a team of angels to make sure they were set up for their time in heaven, including soul registration and identification checks.  It was not a highly sort after branch of Healing, despite being a lucrative one, as working with the recently deceased who could awake at any moment understandably unnerved many.  However, access to the databases and information that undercut the world around them would be a useful resource for someone unofficially fighting crime, and John could see why Sherlock would cultivate an association.  Molly however?  What was she getting out of the deal between them?  John thought of the voice on the phone but couldn’t see Molly as a spy.
The adrenaline rush was starting to abate slightly and his legs felt wobbly.  Far too much excitement for a Thursday morning.  He propped himself against the counter, going through the mundane ritual as a balance to the unusual.
“No, it’s fine.  Nice to know you care,” John said with a half-laugh.  “It’s just...difficult to explain.”  He brought his hand up to scratch the back of his neck and Sherlock tried not to smile at the “John-like” gesture.  He was unsure when he started to categorise things as “John-like” but now was probably not the time to start questioning it.  John started to explain in starts and stops, hands fiddling with his camera.  “You know how I said I wanted to be a doctor when I was little?” Sherlock nodded.  “Well I actually tried.  Applied, got in to a med course, things all looked to be going to plan.  And then...things just didn’t work out and I felt... bad.  Really bad.  Have to drop out to survive kind of bad.  I’m doing better now but sometimes life...well you know, life is just a lot isn’t it?”
He edged them carefully out of the room and on a whim decided to go left. It would be difficult to navigate them out without the detective’s sure-footed abilities.  However, considering John was carrying the weight of two of them, he figured Sherlock wouldn’t mind taking a slightly scenic route.
John sighed and followed, equally as slow, keeping one eye on the stairwell.  Sherlock gasped slightly and John swivelled, mind already flicking through possible life-threatening scenarios.  He then gasped as well.
She paused and looked between them.  “We met here.  You took a pair of feet and told me not to ring Security.”
“Well I did try but it seems like your stupid face is burned into my memory so I thought I might as well keep up appearances and ring,” John shot back, instantly settling back into their conversational pattern.
It was impossible to miss the way Sherlock’s eyes lit up and although his tone didn’t change, he leaned in excitedly while explaining.  “When the Guards are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.”  He was clearly very smug about this.
“I don’t think that really counts then- Sherlock!”  John, having wrangled the piece of hair into submission, had walked out of their bedroom, only to be faced by his beloved lying prone on the sofa, still in his pyjamas.  “Sherlock?  You are still coming out yes?”
“Oh, just shut up.  Anyway, I’ve got to go,” John grumbled, looking at his phone.  No message from Sherlock.  That was fine.  He didn’t expect one anyway.  It was all fine.  Great even.  Just great.
Sherlock repressed a sigh, as he closed his eyes and smiled. It was such a simple thing, a monosyllabic name that was so common it was entrenched with ordinariness. But, oh, it was so much more than that. That one word contained in it the knowledge that he had done it. He had kept them safe.
"Me? Yes, fine, never better, why wouldn't I be?" It hadn't escaped Johns notice that Sherlock a) hadn't moved from the space in the doorway but his hands kept twitching every few seconds, as if he was preventing himself bolting and b) hadn't looked at him yet.
He had started wishing his day would go quicker, but not to get them over with as efficiently as possible, but because tonight might be a night Sherlock was around, to fascinate him with tales that were only just plausible, or Mrs Hudson would be pottering about with cleaning or cooking or card games (she was spectacularly good at Rum and awful at Poker).  Even coming home to an empty flat wasn’t terrible, its walls filled with promise that something could happen at any moment.
*Creeps out of the woodwork* sorry about the delay on this chapter- a busy week followed by an ill week did not a lot of writing make.  Hopefully have C8 up soon to catch up a bit.
After a few deep breaths, John managed to sit up properly.  He smiled up at Sherlock, who was gazing curiously at him.  Signalling, he held his hand out.  Sherlock blinked.  John raised his eyebrow and waved his hand a little, which seemed to trigger Sherlock into movement.  They locked fingers and Sherlock helped haul John up.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock did hand it back, not letting his eyes drop.  John felt as if he was mesmerised as he reached up to grab it.   Then Sherlock spoke, head tilting slowly to one side.
“I don’t know.  Just, might explain about the car?  And there might be footage I guess,” he said, shrugging, unable to pin down his exact thoughts other than the tiny part that was flashing
“How are we going to get in?” John didn’t pretend they weren’t going through the door, getting straight to the logistics.
, and John almost thought of leaving it before realising it was the only way of getting a blog post written today.  His highness was nowhere to be seen.  He set up station on the desk and aimlessly doodled on his notebook while the laptop switched on and Google loaded.  No wonder Sherlock always stole his, this thing took forever.  At the cheerful chirp that registered the thing was finally ready, his eyes flicked up and he froze completely.
“Just your face,” John said, and Sherlock blushed without meaning to, an annoying habit that had started as soon as he and John began their friendship.  “Wait, that sounded weird.  Look, I’ll explain later.  I’ve got to go but can I come round at like 3?”
“What?  Technically I’m on time,” John said, pointing to the clock above the door.  Mike only shook his head but couldn’t respond as the lecturer walked in yelling about how she was going to murder whoever set her lessons up so she had to run from the Graydon building to Barts.  But apparently the administrators thought it was fine to throw the photography class any old place, travel time be damned.
“Stay here.  Both of you,” he said, glaring meaningfully at John.  Sherlock’s scowl deepened even further.  John didn’t want to know what he would be persuaded into.  Probably questioning the suspect while Sherlock ran him questions telepathically, or distracting Lestrade while breaking Sherlock in through the ceiling.
“Neither of those.  Eccentric yes but he can be sweet when he wants.”  Sherlock looked a little scandalised.  “There’s a second bedroom upstairs if you’ll be needing two?”
Denying something does not make it true however.  It would appear his second mistake of taking the case had just strolled through the door.
an angel did not necessarily mean it was difficult to harm one, as he was acutely aware.  His shoulder was patched together but reconstruction was only partial, and his wing was, for want of a better word, fucked beyond all measure.  What hurt more than the lack of flying ability though was the loss of his healing powers.  He retained some of them, but they would never reach his pre-war levels, never mind the strength he had in the glory days.  So at the end of his hospital stay, he was told he was lucky to still be in a physical form, lucky his soul had not been shattered on impact, and simply lucky to be alive.
“Just caught him boss,” the guy with a death-grip on John’s arm said.  Later he would find it odd that the manager didn’t look surprised to see him but his attention in the current moment was focussed on the thuggish man, making sure he wouldn’t get a chance to get a punch or kick in.  The other bouncer marched forward, clearly looking for others.  He hoped Sherlock had the sense to hide or run.
John looked up at the approaching footsteps and smiled when he saw him which was a good sign.  Maybe.  More data needed.
"Oh," was his eloquent response.  If he started running now he could probably be at the airport in an hour and be on his way to a new life in Mexico where he wouldn't have to worry about running into GC-
John replied tightly.  “We had literally 5 minutes to ourselves Mycroft and there were other concerns.”
“You think he’s faked it?”  Sherlock shrugged.  “But why still drive a taxi?  Doesn’t seem to be dreaming very big.”
Well, that wasn’t strictly true.  There might be something in here to wear.  On the other hand, the stuff he would normally wear on a night out with his friends might not be what he should wear in front of Sherlock’s friends.  Surely they couldn’t all dress in tailored shirts and suit jackets, could they?  Could they?  Whatever, next to Sherlock he was likely to pale into insignificance anyway, a direct counterpoint to his tall, monochrome aloofness.
Soothed, Sherlock smiled.  “Yeah.  Nothing important.”  John was still frowning slightly, a small wrinkle in between his eyebrows and that was not allowed.  Sherlock placed his hands on John’s waist and leaned down to kiss him lightly.
This Monday however, things had shifted.  As he approached, John was already there, scowling over something in the back of his book, every few moments adding another stroke of his pencil before stopping and scowling again.  His scowl was adorable, Sherlock thought.  Objective fact.  He didn’t think about wanting to smooth the frown lines from his forehead, tease him about getting so worked up, kis- nope.  Not going there.  Having feelings for John was pointless ergo thinking about having feelings for John was pointless.  Instead he tried to guess what John was scowling
Frankly, by the time they had to leave, he was exhausted.  This was useful in the fact that he couldn’t concentrate on what had happened the last time they were in the bar but did not make him a reliable detective’s assistant.
Sherlock returned to glaring at Mycroft.  “I’m assuming John was the matter you were alluding to earlier?”
“It’s nothing.  Seriously.  Just been having nightmares again, that’s all.” John tried to make it sound casual, hoping Greg would leave it.
John got in the back seat, expecting Sherlock would want the front for a better view.  Therefore it was a surprise when the other back door opened and Sherlock slid into the middle seat.  Lestrade’s car was not massive and Sherlock seemed determined to stare out through the gap in the front seats, so their sides were pressed against each other from foot to shoulder, their wings overlapping.  John couldn’t have moved away if he tried, there being no space to move
“Thank you,” Sherlock whispered in his ear, refusing to let John move back and see his face.  "For what you said and I know you did something extra, I know it and just-."
John swallowed.  “Yes.”  Of course, there was one place that he saw F.A. every other day, although his interactions were tinged by grief rather than the clinical precision Sherlock was showing.
“And John?  If you have another nightmare, either tell Sherlock or call me.  You don’t have to do this alone mate.”
“For you to stop your designs on the community centre for a start.  If you try anything like this again, anywhere, and I will find out, I’m more than willing to offer the same ultimatum.”
A bark made them spring apart.  Sherlock hadn't realised they were stood so close together.  Gladstone was stood on the sofa, paws up on the arm, looking at them expectantly, looking between them and where his lead was still hanging up.
He knew they knew each other.  Why was this freaking him out?  Hypothetical friendship was fine.  Evidence of such was upsetting.
“Hi John,” she said, folding her arms across her chest and angling herself so she was directly in the way of the opening of the shield.  “What are you doing here?”
He moved into the centre of the room to give the space a chance.  It was a bizarre room, messy probably with the previous occupant’s things, but not off-putting.  Victorian wallpaper, the darkness of which should have made the room claustrophobic but which made it feel cosy, like a den.  Two armchairs, mismatched, one squishy, one modern.  More tables than necessary, coffee table by the sofa, square one by the windows that seemed to be partially desk, one by each chair.  A mantlepiece above an actual fire had a random collection of things, a skull for one which was strange considering
“Hello, the number you’ve rung is not available at this moment.  Please leave a message after the tone.”  Sherlock tried this 5 times until he gave up.
He huffed and slumped into the bed.  Trust Mycroft to turn everything to shit.  No John.  No wings.  No violin to screech when upset.
This then set a precedent.  Every time Sherlock had a case, he would text John Watson, who gradually was promoted to simply John in his mind.  Later a text would arrive with a picture of Gladstone and a message from John about his walk.  Sherlock denied he was the sort of person to have a million dog photos on his phone but the way he jealously guarded it begged to differ.  There was an entire sub-section dedicated to walk photos.  Some of Gladstone on his own, sometimes with other dogs, many of him posing on rocks or on the move (like owner, like dog), and memorably, one of him halfway across a duck pond.  That one was accompanied by an apology message and a picture of Gladstone wrapped up in a fluffy towel looking especially pleased with himself.  John did not appear in any of the photos.  Sherlock ignored his disappointment because
“How could you possibly know all that?” John asked, eyes narrowed and his expression neutral.  Dangerous, so dangerous, but the deductions were already there, in plain sight.
This was the same impulse that could explain how John found himself on the upper level of the Guard station, staring at security footage.  Dull, fuzzy security footage.  If he had assumed his beat was boring, it was nothing compared to the mind-numbing torment that was watching the streets he had walked round, without even the calming effect of feet slamming into pavement to keep his mind occupied.
“I’m sure you’ll think of something.  John, are you alright?” Sherlock said, trying to sound casual.
seen another sign.  But the Fallen had also been there and John didn’t want to get him into trouble.  Normally, if he was being practical, he would assume that the Fallen had something to do with the crimes.  It was the logical explanation and as a Guard, John really should have brought the guy in for questioning or at least investigated him further. Such as, for example, mentioning his existence to someone.  His boss perhaps.  His boss who was currently asking if he’d seen any more signs and was desperately, if secretly, looking for any leads.  But.
"You can go get Hamish if you'll come back down," John said, figuring the bee might help him relax. Sherlock lept to his feet and John could hear him racing up the stairs. He half expected him to not come back and was surprised when he heard someone coming down the stairs. Sherlock walked in front of the sofa and sat down next to John, holding the bee in his lap like a frightened child might, seeking the comfort of the soft toy. John began to speak again. "I know that you've talked yourself into believing that a relationship with me is impossible. It's not. I also know you're interested in one. Right now I want you to understand that that is my choice, not yours."
"He wanted all of her records here.  I only knew her for a little while; she left here five years ago, but she never..."  Sarah shut her eyes for a second, like she was thinking of something.  "Actually.  Now that I think about it, it's not the case.  You know she worked in the pediatric clinic here, usually in the evening.  One thing she always insisted on was that she examine children without their parents in the room at the same time.  She said it was because parents so often get hysterical over minor things."
"I divide my time between London and Bangalore.  I'm currently the head of a small firm that is devoted to tablet technology and a selection of peripheral wireless components.  My parents are both retired and also divide their time between the two countries, although they live in a country village when in the United Kingdom."
"She took my clothes off, except my pants.  I almost told Her I could do that myself, but lots of people don't think I can do things like that.  And then She started to examine me, feeling my arms and legs to see they were all right."
"That would be good, thank you," John said before Sherlock could object.  He was hungry and knew better than to think Sherlock would want to go anywhere besides Bart's when they got out of here.  Mrs. Murray soon returned with a large brown bag that smelled of cooking oil.
"Well, I've got an anniversary coming up, too," Peter said after a period of silence. "Next week it'll have been one year since the last hospitalization." The group gave him another round of applause. John wondered what it must be like in that relationship if that was a milestone.
.  When he talked about his dire circumstances upon returning to London, it sounded just like John did when he related the circumstances he had been in before meeting Mike in the park.  In this version, they apparently met in a bar, and Mike was a dresser (whatever that was).
Lestrade here is honestly relieved that he doesn't have to go through the trial of deciding whether to ask Sherlock to assist on the case. He knew it would help, but also was worried about how the children would feel about it. Moira's made his decision easy.
"Yes. There's no other explanation for the injuries. The only good thing is that if whoever it is doesn't live in the area, she could possibly go home with her father. We don't want to send her home to the same thing." Unable to help himself, John let out a sigh of frustration.
"He must be anxious."  If John felt anxious even though he was only going to be an observer, he couldn't imagine how Phillip felt.
Since Douglas wasn't in the hall itself or the living room, he walked down the hall into the kitchen. He was indeed there, and from what Sherlock could see he had been attempting to make either stew or stir-fry; the meat and vegetables on the counter were however so cut up they resembled an attempt at puree. Once he heard Sherlock enter the room, he turned around. "We need to establish some rules." Cutting the vegetables and meat must have diminished his anger, as he spoke flatly; of course the reason he was so angry was that his relationship with the body (as Sherlock had begun to think of the absent person) was not long-term and he was nervous over previous failed marriages. Of course, that must have been what the cheerful one meant about the extra brilliant part. He meant that he wanted his mother's wedding to be a double wedding with these two. That was the reason for the "Not after six months" comment from Douglas. While the man had clearly not been the brightest, he seemed to understand people well and must have seen something that indicated a bright future for the two of them. Sherlock tried to imagine how he'd feel if this had happened six months after he got involved with John instead of two years. Much to his dismay he could see himself acting like Douglas.
“They choose victims from the tube lines.  Scope them out somehow, know their routes, then land close enough to follow?” Lestrade said, nodding as he worked through it.
Sherlock looked at him then, with a small, lopsided, genuine smile.  “Thank you, John.”  Because there was the mystery of Sherlock Holmes that John felt he had to unravel and
This meant they could move on to stage two.  He retreated to the kitchen and returned with tea.  Eating was the gateway to drinking.  “You can’t stay on the sofa forever,” he said as he handed one mug over.
Sherlock looked like he wanted to say No but hesitated.  Instead of answering that he didn’t know, he shrugged.
“John, kiss me,” he demanded and their mouths crashed together as John began rutted to match his thrusts up. Slowly at first but then faster, and faster, grunting in time to Sherlock’s gasps. Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth as he brought his legs and arms up to wrap around John’s back.  He was nearly there, fingers dragging down John’s back as he moved his head back to tuck it into John’s neck as he panted desperately.
“Yeah, you may want to tell your body language that.  There are advantages to your constant nagging about observance you know.”
But, as the days drew on, mania turned to lethargy.  He couldn’t mark when the tipping point was.  All he knew was that one day he was crackling with energy and the next, it was a trial to even open his eyes.  Hope, stupid illogical hope, had somehow seeped into his bones and now it was crumbling.  Mind Palace John had disappeared.  The F.A. had dimmed.  The signs were pointing towards the devastating.
“I should probably get to work.  Just lock up the room, I’ll clean up.”  And without waiting for a thank you she ran out the room.  John looked at Sherlock.  Sherlock looked back and shrugged.  They both turned back to the screen.
John hesitated but conceded as he saw the desperation in Sherlock’s plea.  “Tell me if they hurt okay?” He tone brook no argument.
“Now before you go in, all you need to know is that this is what the flat normally looks like,” Victor said, producing some photos.  The image of the inside the single room flat showed that it was basic but as clean.  The living area would be first upon entering the door, the kitchen on the left and the bedroom, obstructed by a screen, directly behind.  The bathroom was separate but more of a cupboard than a room, a shower squished in as an afterthought.  No clutter was evident on the windowsills or on the floor, the pale blue bedspread was neatly made and the kitchen looked as if it was rarely used for fear of disturbing its rigid order.  There were only small hints that the flat was lived in at all, a few photo frames dotted around, shoes by the door, a toothbrush by the sink.
Then Sherlock said “Oops,” still clutching his lock-pick.  It was not the best weapon he could have chosen and was not remotely intimidating.
“Sherlock, where have you been?  You need to come round more often, you bring him yes?” he said, turning to John who looked thoroughly amused.  Well at least one of them was enjoying this.
“Right now?” Sherlock felt caught between wanting to show off his skills and not wanting to scare John away.
"I was not!"   Well not now anyway.  Later, after he'd told him exactly why he'd kept his past with Sherlock a secret instead of telling him like a mate should.
“John, deal with him,” Mycroft gestured with his umbrella as he made to leave. This request had only increased when Mycroft had deduced their relationship change, as if John had more control over Sherlock now they were having sex on a regular basis.  John had been hiding in the kitchen hoping to avoid the conversation entirely.  As Mycroft left, he stood in the kitchen doorway, watching Sherlock.  He hadn’t moved, but John could see in his eyes that he was carefully listening to Mycroft’s exit, making sure he was really gone.  As they heard the front door shut, and Sherlock relaxed minutely, John sauntered up to the chair.
“Not really.  You’ve been avoiding me,” he accused, innocently looking up through his lashes.  It was John’s turn to look at the floor.  It was a shade of rough-faded beige which he hadn’t noticed before and he had to say, looked particularly awful.
John.  His John.  Just sat in an armchair.  He was holding a cup of tea in one hand, a book in the other, relaxed and whole and decidedly not dead.
“Duh, Victor.  They’re like so cute together and they like the same stuff and yeah, it’s just obvious.  And look at them, they’re like together already.”
“Oh, it’s nothing.  Rugby stuff.  Boring.”  It was a lie but Sherlock didn’t know how to mention it so he didn’t.
Now all he had to do was seduce John, who would be back home in about twenty minutes.  Easy.  John loved him.  He loved John.  John wanted this.  He wanted this.  Easy.  Yep yep yep.  Nervous?  Him?  No.
“You must excuse us a moment,” Sherlock said in a tight voice, hand curling around John’s bicep and pulling him away towards the foyer.  John tried to give the woman an apologetic look but it was difficult considering he had apparently lost his privilege of choosing where he was headed and they were walking at pace that meant they could probably outrun a London bus.  In fact Sherlock didn’t slow down until they were in a quiet, shadowy corner of the foyer where they couldn’t be seen.
“The Guards will have verified it you know,” Molly said, even as she did as bid and logged into some software.  Sherlock scoffed to demonstrate just what he thought of the Guards ability.
His magic had been severely weakened and he rarely used it anymore, getting frustrated when he hit his limit.  On top of that emotional manipulation was not his greatest skill.  He hadn’t bothered to learn much as his own morality stopped him but he had the basic knowledge and he had to try at least.  Anything that might help his Sherlock.
Instead he scanned over each of the files.  Nothing sprang up as unusual which only sank Sherlock further into his petulant state.  The least it could do was throw up
“John’s my neighbour from across the hall,” Sherlock jumped in.  Victor’s eyes lit up at that and turned to John with more interest.
A bet was placed.  Whoever could find out Sherlock's secondary gender, or successfully guess the person who discovered it would get the prize money and, more importantly, would be honoured above all others as truly, the greatest detective on the force.
“Me and Harry don’t get on, never have really, and I am the youngest.” Sherlock smiled at the confirmation of his guess.  “But Harry is short for Harriet.”
Beside a sudden acquisition of gym-etiquette knowledge, Sherlock had just about managed to meet all the instructors on the rota and although he would happily arrest most of them for crimes of being overly enthusiastic and overall idiocy, none of them had actually committed the crime he had been sent after.  Well, he’d arrest them all except Ivan.  He was not afraid to admit he was a little scared of Ivan.
If they were still pretending their relationship was truly platonic, that meant they had to pretend to be
It wasn’t like he had the best morning either.  Insomnia was a reoccurring problem since the war, something he’d been told was because of the change in surroundings but which he personally believed ran deeper.  He’d been home for going on a year now and still what little sleep he snatched was plagued with awful visions and a longing that had him in frustrated tears.  It was surprising then that he slept through his alarm and was only woken by a neighbour bashing on the thin adjoining walls telling him, in no uncertain terms, exactly what he would do if John did not switch it off.  Showering and dressing were a rushed job and he sprinted to work.  This turned out not to be worth it as, for the 214
, moved out of Mycroft’s house, Sherlock was absolutely beside himself with delight and thought all issues had been resolved, or would soon be resolved at any road).
thing.  After the ‘Fall’ of Moriarty, as people were calling it, he had wondered if he was a fully fledged human.  His wings were gone and for a few days he couldn’t perform any magic whatsoever.  However, a small bit had gradually returned, the odd spell here and there, mostly healing ones but he had nowhere near his old powers.  This meant learning
He opened his eyes, looking down at Sherlock’s comically horror-stricken features. John couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s hair, who ducked and snuggled into John’s chest.
“Used to be flats.  They knocked through to create some community space years ago but both the funding and enthusiasm dried up.  Now it’s abandoned.”
Out, John decided.  It would have been much better had Sherlock not been there.  Then at least the distraction would have been imaginary and thus controllable, deniable.  But with his solid presence in the flat, so was the elephant in the corner, the thing John didn’t want to look at too closely.  It was an elephant with power, an elephant that could crush him if he wasn’t careful.  In the corner it had to stay and so ignore all his emotions he must.
The door swung open.  Sherlock was dressed down in a plain white t-shirt and black skinny jeans which John thought would look lovely strewn across his bedroom floor.  He then quickly dismissed that thought because he felt it inappropriate to ask his neighbour for a favour while picturing him in a compromising situation.
“You should,” John nodded back.  He may or may not have been beaming and so tried to tone it down slightly.
skin on show and oh god he was still so late what was he doing!  Definitely not the time to be checking out his neighbour,
“At least I know I have the right house.  But I’m not here to shout at him.  I’m John, Sherlock’s boyfriend.  The visit’s a surprise.”
Sherlock grinned.  “Spectacular isn’t it?  Come on, we don’t have long.  We need to get there before they ruin it-”
"I've got something I want to show you," Sherlock said and then pulled him by the shirt sleeve down the hall.  He unlocked the room at the end and then suddenly John was in a bedroom.  Sherlock's bedroom to be precise, if the periodic table of the wall was anything to go by.  Sherlock shut the door and hurried over to his desk to switch on a small lamp.
There it was- John whimpered and began to fuck Sherlock’s face as Sherlock relaxed and tried not to gag.  He was probably a mess, hair sticking up from hands run through it, drool out the side of his mouth, cheeks flushed deep red, but John was looking at him like he was a creature from heaven, a precious being, and Sherlock moaned at the feeling there.  That apparently was enough to send John tipping over the edge and he came down Sherlock’s throat with a whine of “Sherlock” ripped from his lips.
She started to say something but bit her lip.  Nodded.  “Okay, so thinking positively, John could technically be on Earth.”
John smiled but there was glint in his eyes. The dangerous passion had not passed and he was calculating something. Sherlock didn’t feel nervous however. John would look after him. He always did.
Lestrade sighed.  “Apparently pressure makes him turn to melodrama.  But that is the long and short of it.  John’s gone missing and we think it’s linked in the case we’ve been working.”
“We need to get the rest of these clothes off,” he panted, as Sherlock started rocking forward and back and if they didn’t undress immediately this was going to end
Sherlock rose into a sitting position. "No, no, no, no no.  I don't.  I swear to you I don't.  Never." He sounded like he was begging.  "I promise I don't want to."
"No," said an irritated Mr. Ogebide.  "She only reacted when she saw the news clip about the arrest."
Right at the top of the stairwell was a hall with several doors, three nearby. One was open and revealed a bathroom, one was shut tight, and the third had a sign made out of wood on it that said "Martin's room" in writing done in every color of the rainbow, one for each letter. The cartoony planes drawn on it indicated it had been made by a child, and since he was sure this body didn't have children, it had to be Douglas' youngest.
Err, this got deleted and I've only just noticed. It's only a few lines but if you wanted to read the original ending :3
Sherlock took this as his cue to step forward that little bit more, to bring his hands up to cup John’s face so his fingertips could brush at that soft hair at the back of his neck and to kiss him.  Finally kiss him.
“John, you can’t hide forever,” he called as he started upstairs.  John better appreciate this, stairs were not easy when every step felt slightly like he was going to throw up.
Because at this moment, he could still leave.  Once he stepped through the door that was it, he’d have to deal with whatever was in the building but there was still time to leave. He looked around.  It didn’t
The kiss was perfect (all of John’s kisses were perfect) but the angle was not.  Kissing your boyfriend should not require physiotherapy after for neck strain.  John gently nudged Sherlock until he was on his back and then a thrill ran up Sherlock’s spine as John straddled his waist.  He gasped as the kiss deepened and he knotted his fingers into sandy blonde hair, pushing up into the solid weight of him.  Without breaking the kiss, John pulled Sherlock’s shirt tails out of his trousers and snaked a hand under to caress his chest and abdomen.  The sensation of the soft touches mixed with the bruising force of the kiss was heady and electrifying, a complete relinquishing of control.  John gripped his waist and moved down to bite kisses onto Sherlock’s neck and fuck that felt good and…
Sherlock’s mind supplied and he nearly face planted the floor from the plank he was supposed to be holding.
“John,” he shouted and the winced, his voice about four times too loud.  He scrambled to his feet and inadvertently caught sit of himself in the mirror.  It looked like Gladstone had dragged him through a hedge backwards.  In a wind tunnel.  Set to tornado mode.
About two weeks after they had agreed to taking it slow, there was a chase.  In all honesty the Met couldn’t understand how the boys managed to always need to be running after their suspects but so long as they caught them in the end, they would let it slide.  Of course, this time was no different, and they managed to corner him only a few streets away from Baker Street.  After dealing with the necessary questions (“Yes this is the right person”, “No we didn’t steal your badge again”, “I’m so sorry, but you know he pickpockets when he’s bored”), John jokingly suggested a race back.  Really he should have seen his mistake.
“Don’t worry dear, he’ll be back at some point.  He keeps strange hours our Sherlock.”  John began to deny both that he was waiting for Sherlock to appear and that he was in any way ‘ours’, but Mrs Hudson had already disappeared into the kitchen again.  Selective hearing appeared her specialty.
John frowned at the sudden detour in conversation.  “Victor and Sherlock are best friends.  Been practically joined at the hip since they met.”
The good news was that Sherlock was amazing and interesting and fascinating.  In fact John was running out of adjectives to describe him.  It turned out they could of run into each other sooner.  Sherlock was studying Chemistry at Barts and used the labs at will when he wasn't running after the police correcting their mistakes, whether they wanted his help or not.
“There’s been something of a criminal upswing here over the past few years.  Turns out getting into the better place does not automatically make people want to hold hands and sing.  So, we made a deal.  Their worst for our best.”
They both looked startled at Sherlock’s sudden appearance and John winced slightly at the fact that might look guilty.
...”  John felt his temper rising and his heart beat quickening as if he was panicking.  Oh gods was he going to have a panic attack?
It had started innocently enough.  Due to his work, Sherlock couldn’t always be in the flat to take care of Gladstone but he would be dammed if he gave him away.  Mrs Hudson could deal with feeding and so on but walking an Irish Setter was rather more work than he could ask of her, especially since she allowed Gladstone in the flat in the first place.  Therefore there was only one obvious solution.  A dog walker was necessary.
They were in a living room.  The floor plan was similar to their own, a living room connecting to a kitchen, stairs, fireplace.  However, the décor was more modern, very minimalist with a lot of clear lines and a base neutral colour palate to accentuate the bold colours of the blue sofa and various artworks on the walls.  It wasn’t to John’s own tastes, preferring the cluttered cosiness of their own flat.  That being said, differing interior design tastes did not give you permission to let yourself into their flat and nosy about.
They easily identified the main stumbling blocks to their new relationship.  The most pressing one was probably themselves.  So they talked.  Communication wasn’t either one’s forte but, when push came to shove, they could just about manage it.  Just.  It involved a lot of looking at the floor and more blushing than either expected but in the end they agreed on certain things.
John shook his head. "I don't know if he'd ever let me. I wouldn't even say he's afraid of it - it's more sheer terror and panic."
"Just don't go far," Mr. Aherne added.  The three children then left the office.  "What do you want to ask me?" he said as he turned to face Lestrade.
"Because I was lon- I wanted company."  Sherlock looked up at John, and he smiled back at him in what he hoped was a reassuring manner.
"Any luck with that so far?" John asked.  Lestrade seemed to be doing his best to pretend Sherlock wasn't there, so John decided to be direct.
"You're a pretty big boy for your age."  Harvey seemed triumphant at this point.  John felt uneasy; he didn't like wherever this was going.
The day passed by like molasses. John couldn't remember a longer one, and he remembered some very long Christmas eves from when he was a child. Sherlock didn't try to talk to him any more, and just sat in his chair staring out the window. John read, watched television, and went to bed at a ridiculously early hour - in his own room.
John wasn't sure if this was designed to throw Phillip off guard or it was just another one of Harvey's abrupt segues.  "I would say I told you what happened already," Phillip finally replied.
"A pulmonary embolism from her pregnancy.  She hadn't had any symptoms until she collapsed at work and then it was too late."  He sounded sad even remembering it.
"This is the last picture I have of Phillip," Mr. Rodgers said as he put a photograph on the table.  It showed a black-haired boy barely out of toddlerhood examining a music stand.  He smiled in the photo, something John hadn't seen Phillip do in real life.  "I play for an orchestra and he always loved to come to work with me."
"Of course. I want to see what you draw. Bring your flute, too." Sherlock smiled warmly at him as he walked down the hall, alone. He looked like he was planning on leaving himself, but Lestrade cleared his throat.
John didn’t know that, but he knew the general idea they operated on.  “They use a system to code and uncode called a one time pad. The code is randomly generated and used only once.  Which means we can’t get anything out of this message even if it’s meant to tell us something, because we don’t have the code.”
“There was also a man in town, Mr. B, who was retired and enjoyed chemical experiments.  Unlike with Mr. A, I knew he had interacted with Sherlock on a few occasions.  Sherlock had seen him carrying some chemicals home and recognized what they were from their periodic abbreviations on the container.  He was impressed and from then on called him ‘Little Einstein’ if they met on the street. He was married, childless, and left the area because of his wife’s poor health.  I could not find any evidence that Sherlock had gone to his house or even knew where it was, but I still remained suspicious of him.”  He paused, looked at the floor, and began again.  “Now, Mr. C was middle-aged and also childless.  He lived two streets away from us.  Right before I came home, he and his wife moved to Australia.  It was so sudden that they had not sold their house and had left it mostly furnished.  I found this suspicious in the extreme, and later discovered he had gotten an inheritance from a distant relative and it had been his wife’s lifelong dream to move to Australia.  They moved then to secure a job opportunity for her that was only available for a limited time.”
"That will help, no doubt about that.  It's the biggest reminder we have of how small he was at first."  Before she could say anything else, Lou came in through the doors and fell into step with them.  He had a large bag in one hand and a drink holder in the other.
Thankfully, it was early enough that no crowd had gathered by the courthouse.  Before he could go up the steps, he saw Lestrade walking up.  "John!" he said, clearly happy to see him.  "I thought you'd be here.  The prosecutors will be here shortly.  You wouldn't know them, of course.  Lewis George - everyone calls him Lou - and Susan Glenn.  Both good people who've done abuse cases before."
"Do you always know so much about people? Just from looking at them?" Phillip didn't sound angry or irritated; he seemed intrigued if anything else.
"That'd be good, thanks.  I should get going.  I want to see if he's fallen asleep yet."  John knew perfectly well that that was a pathetic excuse to end the conversation, but couldn't think of a better one.
"Said to come back tomorrow. Said, 'I want us to be friends.' Said, 'I like dogs too.' If I came back there'd be a surprise."
At this point John was convinced that he wasn't going to verbally savage Moira, although he couldn't tell what on Earth he was leading up to. He'd gotten her to be chattier than John himself the previous day, and that was in itself a success.
"Then the court is closed for today."  He banged his gavel.  "The court will resume session at nine AM tomorrow."  As usual, the crowd of people filed out, and also as usual John waited for most of them to be gone before leaving.  He quickly found a cab and rode silently back home.
In his defense, it was early in the morning.  True, it wasn't much of one, since there were about a hundred other things he should have noticed, but it was something.  No matter when Martin woke up, he had fifteen minutes of haze to work through before coming fully awake.  And he'd woken up in so many different hotels over the years he was used to his surroundings being unfamiliar.  That really wasn't an excuse, but it was something.
Mr. Aherne sighed.  "Coping, I suppose.  We have good days and bad days.  Moira's therapist says my job is to be a 'good poison container,' and I try.  Some days though, when she gets to talking a lot about that woman..."  He looked furious but bit back whatever he had intended to say.  "One thing: why does Moira have to be in court in person at all?  Don't they have arrangements they can make where she'd testify in another room on camera?"
"You may at this point understand why I am married to my work." His voice sounded stiff, like even his vocal chords had gone rigid.
Right after Lestrade spoke there was a knock on the door.  He stood to open it.  Five young adults stood there, four clearly related; they all had the same dark blond hair, light brown eyes, and lean build.  The fifth was a woman holding an infant.  "Sorry, we couldn't find a sitter in time," she said in apology as they all stepped into the room.  Her dark hair, almond-colored skin, and high, flat cheekbones were in sharp contrast to the other four.  "I can wait out in the hall if you like.  I'm Gloria Yellowfox, Graham's fiancee."  Even her accent was different, distinctly American.
John bit his lip and considered asking the driver to just let him out now. He instead made another nonspecific noise while thinking
"Nerves."  He didn't want to say the words "panic attack."  There had to be something he could do.  He suddenly thought of the laptop he'd been using before.  "Is it all right if I use your laptop for a while?"
, he thought before going right back to sleep. When he woke up in the morning Sherlock wasn't there. He looked at the clock, realized that it was past the time the morning papers would be delivered, and immediately went to the sitting room, not even bothering to get dressed. The room was empty, but there were scattered newspaper pages all over the floor and furniture. He looked in the kitchen, but wasn't surprised to find Sherlock wasn't there.
"Now you can get up." This was obvious even for someone who only knew planes got you from one place to another, as the plane had stopped and the man was undoing his belt.
"That one?" Lestrade said.  He didn't sound surprised.  She nodded firmly in response.  "All right.  Thank you Moira."  She moved away from the mirror to stand by her brother and sister, but Mr. Aherne gazed coldly at K.  He seemed unable to tear himself from the spot.  Outwardly his expression had changed little, but there was a quiet fury in the way he held himself.  If K had not been behind a mirror it was very clear she would not have been safe.
"Everything," she said with a laugh.  "I live on the property and every tenant has my number in case they want to ring me.  I check on leaks and paint any flat once someone moves and give orders to anyone who comes in to clean or fix something.  I made sure every flat in the building had a washer and dryer in the flat itself."  While Mrs. Murray sounded like she would have been happy to go on about her day-to-day routine, Susan looked at her pointedly, and she went silent.
"I almost didn't.  I was going to say that I didn't know anyone there.  But at the last minute I pointed to Her."  His voice was still thick with tears.
John intended to say "I know you don't," but to his surprise he found himself saying "Where do you keep vanishing to?"
This is grooming, plain and simple. K didn't have any interest in dogs any more than drawing or insects. In all those cases she just figured out the things the child liked and learned about them as well as got various items that would interest said child.
"No, they're watching telly in the lounge. I just couldn't leave them with someone. We have no living family…" He trailed off with a sigh. "Should I be in the room with Dr. Watson?"
"Yeah."  Phillip didn't add that he wasn't close to his mother in the first place, and John knew that gave Harvey an actual point to go with.
John told himself that the police might come at any time, and he had to keep her talking.  He was fairly certain that K didn't know Sherlock's job and had no idea she was in any danger.  “You met him when he was four years old.  Four.  Years.  Old.  That's still toddler age, when he was probably taking naps to make it past supper every evening.  Was Phillip 'good' before then because he never struggled?”  He was still looking in her eyes, and disturbingly she made no effort to break the line of contact.  In fact, she seemed almost proud of how disturbed John was.
"I'll be out in the audience the whole time.  Just look for me if you get nervous," John reassured him.  "Are you going to be up for much longer?"
"One, the father is innocent. He didn't do anything and he doesn't know who the perpetrator is. You saw how he gave her a hug and a kiss before he left the room. She was the one to initiate that; therefore she is comfortable with him and has an implicit trust that he won't cross her boundaries. He also didn't let the presence of two adults stop him. If he was truly the guilty party, he would fall into one of two stereotypical patterns. He would either avoid touching his children with the false perception that any physical affection from him would mark him as a perpetrator, or he would pile on unnecessary physical affection as if to show anyone who loved their children that much wouldn't abuse them. Also, he has restructured his day to be with his daughter as much as possible, irrationally thinking that if he is with her all the time the abuser will not be able to further harm her. If he knew who it was, or even had an idea of who it might be, he would have said something about a suspect because his fear is genuine. It's likely someone the father doesn't know or only knows slightly. Two, one of the reasons she is refusing to name who abused her is because the abuser has threatened her family if she tells anyone who it is. Young children don't ask for photos of their family the way an adult would if hospitalized. Parents are usually given more leniency in regard to visiting their children and a child wants something to do in hospital, not something of purely symbolic value. This threat is very real to her because her mother is dead and both of her parents were in care as children. While her father has not told her too many tales about his childhood, she has managed to get the general impression that he was emotionally neglected and is certain that would be her fate if she does speak. The perpetrator is aware of Mr. Aherne's past and is exploiting that. Three, the abuser does not live in the area, as the Yard correctly surmised, but has regular access to the area, probably work-related. Because of that, the parents of the victims know little about the perpetrator. Four, she either thinks her abuser will enter their flat at night or has already done so. She lets her dog sleep on the bed because he is her protection, and I am willing to guess that she's clung to her father recently and spent a lot of time following him, since the abuser knows better than to act when he's around his daughter. Her teddy bear is a gift from her mother, and she's taken to carrying him everywhere because in her mind he has magical properties to protect her." He paused to take a breath.
"All right then."  Every time they talked it seemed like it was between two people who knew each other only vaguely, from working at the same place or from living in the same building, and always made an effort to be polite to each other regardless of what it meant.
"Shall we go and eat?" John interjected. He wasn't sure if this exchange was going to lead into a fight, but he didn't want to find out.
Once he got upstairs and into the flat, he noticed Sherlock standing in the hall between his room and the sitting room. His hair was wet, like he'd just taken a shower, and he looked guilty. "Hi," Sherlock said to him in an unnaturally flat voice. He quickly retreated back to his room, and shut the door firmly behind him. John sighed and sat down in the nearest chair. It was going to be one of those days.
Just before six, Mrs. Hudson came up, supposedly to retrieve her tea mug, but as soon as the evening news came on she sat in the remaining chair.  "I can watch just as well up here," was her excuse.
Sherlock’s arm brushed against Hamish and his eyes lost that glazed look.  “What?” he muttered, his voice still thick with sleep.
"Susan's getting the drinks," he said once they stood together.  "Let's head inside."  They headed up the steps and into the building.  Lou kept talking.  "The foster mother, Jane Henderson, is going to testify first.  We wanted Mr. Ogbeide to go first, but she's only available this morning.  Ruth Murray is the last one for today."
Shaking his head, he got out of that part of the forum and went to the one that was for the new captains.  It was one thing that never failed to make him smile.  And truthfully, seeing other captains who were just as proud of their planes as he was for GERTI made him feel less like a weirdo.  He soon lost himself in the threads there and in the other parts of the forum.
"Of course.  Hello John, I didn't get a chance to talk to you yesterday."  ,Lou sounded like they just hadn't seen each other.
"All right.  I'll say it's a police matter and hopefully he'll get back to you.  I'll see you on Monday?"  The last part had an unstated "if you're not running somewhere with Sherlock on a case" clearly attached.
When John woke up in the morning, Sherlock was no longer there.  Hamish was also missing and John figured he'd find both him and Sherlock in the living room.  He was right; both of them were on the sofa.  "I have made some inquires about Phillip," he said once he saw John.
John's both concerned with how Moira will react to Sherlock and to her situation in general. At this point he of course doesn't know that Moira is actually one of K's more fortunate victims, and since she was physically injured as a result of the abuse, it creates especially vivid images for him, that he doesn't want to deal with. And a very small part of him has already figured out why Sherlock is so determined to get on the case.
Once again Sherlock thought it was best to change the subject. "What do you tell your psychiatrist?"
At least he hasn't completely lost his capacity for deduction, John thought with relief.  "You're right."  He looked at the clock, like he had just noticed the time.  "I'm going up to bed."
"It wasn't just that he said it, you understand.  He seemed genuinely disturbed by it, enough that it was still with him some time later."
"They'd ask how she was doing and if she needed anything.  Foster carers have limits on what they can talk about with a parent, so I had to be careful."
"Yes.  But you're bringing it up for a reason.  Even if it's got nothing to do with what's been going on recently, you didn't just say that because you felt it needed to be said."  John thought it was strange that someone as intelligent as Sherlock would spend so much time talking in circles.  A thought occurred to him.  "Did Phillip call you today?"
As everyone filed out, John hoped that the break would do poor Phillip some good.  He wandered down to the courthouse cafeteria for the first time.  After a look at whatever was being served that day, he made do with a few biscuits and a cup of coffee.  He ate sitting by himself in the mostly deserted cafeteria.  While he knew the jurors ate elsewhere, he had expected to see a few of the reporters or buffalo.  Then again, considering what he'd just seen, maybe they knew better than to risk whatever the cafeteria dished up.
"He would have known about the bruises on his thighs.  Possibly he was hoping to pass them off as the result of rough sex."
"Not much, truthfully."  Dr. Arthur was still looking at John, like he had been the one to ask.  "He said the car was blue and the flat was clean, but he seemed dazed."
. Her father is named after my own, and is loosely based on my own father. His back story of being in foster care because of his alcoholic mother is also taken from real life. My maternal grandfather with the same name grew up under identical circumstances. Nora Aherne is not based on my mother at all, because it seemed a bit auspicious to name a dead mother figure after my own alive one. Her back story was created to make sure the family didn't have any relatives to be ruled out as the abuser. Her siblings aren't named after anyone; I just picked them at random. Like Mary Boyle, Moira is a twin. I didn't know when I started the story what type of twin Mary is (I learned later on she is an identical twin), so I flipped some coins and got her brother. Their relationship is based on my own relationship with my twin, and many other relationships between twins I have known. Unlike most of the families and parents in this story, the Ahernes are functional, warm, loving, and happy. When Sherlock says later in the story that this was K's big mistake, he's correct.
"Yes.  Truthfully, I was terrified I'd see someone I knew from the neighborhood, or from work, or a hundred other places.  Knowing the person beforehand would have been too much."  His voice broke.
"We're out of time for today," Dr. Dodson said. Everyone got up to leave, but before John could go out the door the doctor gestured for him to come back. John walked back over to stand before him. "It sounds like your friend needs individual therapy, but it also sounds like he'd resist it."
This was clearly not the answer Harvey had been looking for; she frowned.  "Did you want physical affection from Dr. Martin?"
"No one did, though.  I don't think She was trying to break my arm, just hold it behind me so I'd get back on the bed."  Phillip's voice broke halfway through the sentence and he squeaked out the rest of it.  John expected the person who had laughed before to react, but there was no laughter, just silence.
The screen went dark.  Sherlock had the remote in his hand, and he tossed it on the ground.  "She'll probably get five years.  Her solicitors are smart enough that they wouldn't agree to a plea for less than half the time.  Then of course She'll leave the country to avoid having to register.  Thailand is cliche at this point.  In the places of Africa She could get away with it there's a language barrier, and I know She speaks no French. Probably Jamaica, then.  Close enough to the States to visit."
John woke up once during the night, not enough to fully register what was going on, but he did hear Sherlock say "You've been crying."
While he expected Sherlock would remain in his room the rest of the day and this would be one of those nights he would be sleeping upstairs, Sherlock actually emerged around supper time. He didn't say anything but he did drink a cup of tea and poke a bit at the remaing risotto. John didn't say anything, either, and felt almost glad that he wouldn't have to have the headline discussion. As soon as he was done eating, Sherlock went right back to his room, but didn't shut the door that time. When he decided to go to bed, he merely came into Sherlock's room and asked "Am I welcome?" Sherlock nodded slightly and he got in beside him.
Mycroft turned to look at him, and John realized he actually seemed nervous.  "Even if this case goes to trial, there's still a very good chance that she will be found not guilty."
Moira turned to him in surprise, obviously not expecting him to speak.  "The afternoon of the day I went to hospital.  I took Rory for a walk and She was in the park.  I almost always saw Her there first.  The other times She'd come in my room."
This chapter is really a short bridge towards the rest of the story. I knew Sarah was going to be part of the story, but I didn't know to what extent. Having her be the doctor who examined Phillip at first was my way of doing so, but the more I planned out the story I realized how much she could be used as a character. Even though she doesn't have a big role on the show, I find her character interesting and wanted to explore it.
"No.  But She must have known I was looking.  She knelt down and asked me to help Her with the buttons.  She wasn't wearing a bra either, so when I did them up I touched Her breasts.  Once I did that She grabbed my wrist and said that I had to ask before doing something like that."
"Why am I listed as Victim Three?  None of the charges involve me.  Statute of limitations and all that."  While Sherlock clearly meant to sound angry, his shame crept into his voice.  He laid down the paper he was holding and John noticed it listed Victims One to Fifteen, with their real names in parenthesis by the side. He couldn't make out any of the names.
"Well, I didn't like the woman when she came up to us.  There was something not right about her tone of voice.  But it was the bit at the end that made me think something was wrong.  She didn't just give him a pat on the shoulder.  It was more like a lover's caress."  Victor visibly shivered.  "And he didn't seem to like it, but he didn't seem to think that was wrong, either."  Even now he looked distressed.  "It just felt wrong, for lack of a better word."
"Oh, shut up and let me finish!" Mrs. Murray snapped.  "I stayed outside because it's my duty as the owner of the building.  They didn't let me in, didn't let me see in at all.  The only thing anyone said to me when they were working was chat about the weather."
Without a word, Sherlock brandished his laptop.  The flash drive stuck out of one side, and on the screen was an open folder with a program in it.  “If we get a chance to look through the history of the program, we can figure out what the recording says.”
"I started the drugs because I knew I was too old and there wasn't a way to make Her take me back."  The self-disgust in his voice was clearly evident.  "I'd have made myself younger to live with Her forever if I could have."
“I was tired of getting teased there.  The kids asked me all sorts of things about my broken arm and when I wouldn’t say how I’d got it they’d make all sorts of nasty things up.  I went to the park and sat in the shelter I used to hide under.  I’d have stayed there all day but a police officer came by and asked me why I wasn’t in school.  When I didn’t say anything he took me down to the station.  As soon as I got there this other man asked who I was and when I told him my name he said that he needed to talk to me.  I got really scared then because I was sure he was going to arrest me.”
"Nothing new. Still sober. I think I may be able to bring his friend in once. He's wearing down." Mari's husband's best friend had apparently seen him being abused when he was a teenager, and it ate at him tremendously.
"No, Sherlock Holmes, you are not leaving. We're all going back in that office and listening to that tape. I promised Mr. Aherne we're going to catch this man, and the sooner that happens the better." Sherlock's smile became a scowl, but walked back into the office without a complaint. John followed the two of them and shut the door behind him.
"Ah. His bee. I would ask where you had learned about that, but that is not relevant to the question. That is a very long story, and I hope I can answer your questions." He glanced out the window, and then to his hands in his lap. "That bee is my greatest failure."
"All right."  He sighed.  "Back when we were living with Her we didn't get to talk to our dad.  They said he could ring us but She said that he never did.  Well, once I felt bad because of something me and Dominic had done that day," he said, making a face that indicated just what that had been, "and I waited until everyone else was in bed and I took the phone and rang Dad.  I don't know why.  Just wanted to hear his voice, I guess.  Well, he picked up and all I said was 'Dad,' and he goes 'Martin!  I thought you didn't want to talk to me,' and that really set me off and I started crying and I said I wanted to go home.  Because he did drink too much after Mum died, but he did love us a lot.  He kept asking me what was wrong and I couldn't say anything.  Then the phone goes dead and She's standing in front of me with Her hand on the switch.  She told me to go to bed and I did.  A week later we found out Dad had killed himself."
"I wasn't supposed to talk to them much.  I had to stay in my room when they came.  Except when She would take me to the fucking room."
"Do you mean you don't know if what you did was a crime, that you don't remember if you did commit a crime, or that you're not sure if someone else will say you committed a crime?"
John shivered.  He had seen those jurors, and although he already knew that you couldn’t tell that from looking at someone, he still couldn’t believe he had been fooled.
"The day before at Her flat we had a fight.  I'd seen Her for a couple of months and everything we did was starting to get scary.  It was scary before too but now it just got worse.  Things I'd had to put in Her She wanted to put in me.  I finally said I was going to tell me dad about Her.  She said She knew where I lived and if I told him She'd kill him.  I said She was lying and I left.  The next night I heard Her tap on the window.  I opened it and She gave me a meatball I was supposed to give to Rory and I let him eat it.  She came in through the window then and said if I yelled She'd put poison in me dad's sugar for his coffee."  A few people actually gasped as they heard this, and John heard someone head up the aisle and out the door.
"A little over a year ago.  Mum and Dad went there because they help homeless people and asked if someone could checkup on me once a month or so."
John was suddenly seized by the desire to talk about anything but K for a change.  "Well, there's no way you can change that now.  What's been going on here for the past couple of days, anyway?"  Thankfully, she got the message, and they spent the next hour in idle chitchat.
"She..."  He stopped.  "She, after that said we could kiss like grown-ups and She showed me how.  Between my legs and Hers, with your lips and tongue."  His discomfort was palpable, and John noted that he couldn't seem to make himself say "penis."  "And we did that for a while when I came over.  But when I'd been going there for a few years I said that I loved Her and I'd done that before, because She liked it when I'd pretend She was my mother, but this time I said I wanted to marry Her when I grew up."
Just then Sherlock emerged from the bedroom.  Phillip turned towards, him, eyes lit up.  "They said I couldn't see you."  He bounded off the couch and towards him.
The woman burst into laughter.  "Yes you are.  Do the walk around and then get in the cockpit with Dr. Watson."
"I didn't want them to go into care at all, but I said if they really felt that was the only way to protect her I'd let them go, which was true.  My daughter's safety was the most important thing.  Eventually they decided that since it clearly wasn't someone in the home she'd feel more secure there.  I was told to keep an eye on her and I planned on doing that.  No more walking the dog by herself."
"Yes," Sherlock firmly replied.  John guessed that the people he intended to ring began and ended with "Mycroft."
Mr. Aherne took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.  After a long period of silence he told the court the same story he had told Lestrade last February.  When he finished it he added: "I tried to think of a person that could have done it and I couldn't think of one."
Sherlock's long monologue before this is very deliberately gender-neutral, in hopes of breaking John out of his assumptions. Lestrade is surprised to see him there, but is also relieved in a way - no one else is getting anywhere and maybe Sherlock can break the case. Like almost everyone else, he's very disturbed that the abuser has gotten away with it for so long and is willing to do anything to stop them.
Before all of this began, it would have been the sort of lazy Sunday he rarely got to have.  Now, however, there was something sinister about it, and not just in the fact Sherlock was asleep upstairs and not working on one of his experiments or stealing his laptop or pacing around or sulking.  Everything suddenly seemed tainted by K.  John thought he'd been angry at K before, but then she had just been some unknown monster.  Now she was the person who had broken his best friend.  Someone who made you think all relationships caused pain and the best you could do was keep that pain familiar.  He knew that there was nothing he could do at this point, so he spent most of the day doing small things that needed to be done and doing his own sulking to try to control his anger.
Whether it was that she had a cancelation or that she was so alarmed at John willingly planning to see her he didn't know, but she could get him an appointment later that afternoon.  Now he was sitting on the Tube trying to not think about the feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach.  It's for Sherlock, he told himself.  It doesn't matter what you think of it.  Sherlock needs help.  While that didn't make the feeling go away, it was enough to calm his nerves until he got to his stop.
Martin didn't think "the body I'm in now needs to gain weight" was a sensible answer.  "Changed my mind."
"They should be here in a couple of minutes," Lestrade said.  He put a tape recorder on the table and then went to sit in a corner.
"When I think about it now I can understand more."  John noted he seemed to make a point of looking Clark in the eye.  Clark didn't seem to know what to do about it.  He clearly was happier with a witness he could intimidate.
John figured he should be the one to break the silence, and he did so with a cheery "Hi. Are you Moira?" The girl nodded. She closed the book and brought the teddy bear to her chest with both hands. "What's your bear's name?"
being alone all the time.  So they tried their best and did alright.  Which is how both of them ended up considering a crime scene a bonding activity.
“I do not strop!”  That was a yes then.  “And I think your graffiti theory is off.”  Well now he was just being childish.
“John,” Sherlock whimpered at the tender touch. The softness was both too much and not enough. He wanted more but didn’t know how to ask, his words stuck because of the man in front of him.
John burst into giggles.  It was the combination of the question, the indignant tone, and the adrenaline rush which sent him over the edge, and as the adrenaline took the wheel, he worked himself into near hysteria.  It was the sort of laughing you couldn’t stop even if you wanted to.  He caught Sherlock’s eye mid-laugh, which set the detective to chuckling which evolved so he was in the same state of John.  Each time one of them seemed to calm down, the other set them right off again, until Mrs Hudson appeared demanding to know if they had finally lost it.  When they waved her away with a ‘It’s nothing Hudders, sorry for the noise’, they managed to get a hold of themselves.
A small knock on the door was John’s only warning before the door opened.  He turned with a smile, a joke about how it was nice to see him again after so long, what was it 6 hours now, on his lips before he froze.
"A green one to be exact.  There were flecks in this mark here." Sherlock pointed at the photo.  This caused their arms to touch again and for him to lean slightly into John's space.  It was as if all the air had left the room.  John only trusted himself to nod, swallowing heavily.  "They figured if the perfectly usable ladder was left in place, no one would suspect them of bringing their own. Stupid reasoning really but then again that's probably why they were caught."  John laughed at Sherlock's derision but it came out breathless.
Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever been happier in fact.  University had given him a freedom he hadn’t experienced before, given him the space to do what he wanted so long as he completed the necessary deadline pieces, which surprisingly, were sometimes interesting.  Another plus was that he could keep an indistinct schedule, sometimes appearing in lectures, sometimes electing not to go, making it easier to evade Mycroft’s constant interference.  This, along with his ever increasing knowledge of London’s backstreets and alleyways, provided a working map of both respectable and not so respectable areas that he could access for his own purposes such as his increasing desire to actually be allowed onto a human crime scene.
“Patience is a virtue,” he whispered, and he laughed again as Sherlock shot back “I’ve never been accused of being virtuous.”
sometimes,” Sherlock said, turning towards him with a smile.  It was such a lovely smile.  John felt his own lips twitch in response.  Then he remembered he was probably smiling because of Victor.  The sick feeling came back.
“And there’s that morbid sense of humour I know and am slightly scared by.  Now I need to ask you for a favour that’ll employ those great observational skills but will also help me with a little problem I’ve got.”
“By sticking his fat nose where it doesn’t belong.  And using powers he shouldn’t have to leverage me out of the Other Place.  Not entirely sure why.”
“Yes I can and you know I can so it’d be better for all of us if you just went back to the pub and forget this ever happened,” Victor dismissed and, to Sherlock’s surprise, the man huffed and walked back the way he’d came, taking time to glare at Sherlock before doing so.
Sherlock was running after the culprit.  As usual there was no time to wait for Scotland Yard but he was sure they would catch up.  Eventually.
That person was the brunette he had spotted checking out John earlier.  She introduced herself as “Clarissa.”  Sherlock hated Clarissa and her stupid pretty face and her stupid interesting job as a doctor in an A&E department which John took interest in and asked
Which brought them to yesterday.  Yesterday was Gladstone’s birthday.  Sherlock realised it was illogical to celebrate a dog’s birthday as they had no concept of what a day was, never mind the date of their own birth.  But then Mrs Hudson arrived with a dog birthday cake (and some human birthday cake for Sherlock) and fussed over both of them for a while and it seemed a waste of perfectly good cake to do nothing.
"Are you sure? I mean, are you sure this isn’t just adrenaline talking?  I would hate for you to do something you’d regret."  He tried to pull back a little and give John some breathing space but the iron grip in his hair stopped his efforts.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock insisted.  Victor made to reply but was interrupted by Sherlock’s pursuer appearing at the end of the alleyway.
“Meaning they’ll be more tomorrow?” Sherlock said in mock-horror, with a hint of curiosity.  It would make sense that John would be a romantic.
Jake shrugged.  “Could be any of them.  That’s partly why I agreed to let you look.  I thought if you were as good as Victor said you were then you could help us pinpoint who it is.”
“Tell me you did not put that in your mouth,” John demanded.  Sherlock looked vaguely guilty but was masking it with a haughty ‘
John glared at him and added, “Fine.  No tea for you,” before marching off in the direction of the student’s cafe.
When he went to work the next day, he expected questions from Lestrade, yet no grey-hair appeared in his vision.  Apparently there was a lead on a case or paperwork or something capturing his attention.  Whatever.  John didn’t care.
He repeated but it still sounded like a ball of consonants and vowels rather than anything that could be described as a word.
There was supposed to somehow be more plot in this chapter, really pushing us into the action.  Then I started writing a month ago and the chapter got a bit busy and then I got a bit busy and basically it's a month later than the last chapter, I've somehow written 5k words and we're still not at the part I wanted to be at.  If this carries on I expect the next chapter to be about 9k long and featuring at least *gasp* two plot points! :P
Sherlock frowned.  Party’s weren’t exactly his thing, too loud, too many people, too much input, but this was Victor and Victor had said he was a friend and friends go to parties their friends invite them too,
Mycroft had helpfully provided a car to transport him back smoothly through the tangle of streets to his desired location.
“Well, you will be happy to hear he is now one the Guard’s personal liaisons at Barts, picked it up after Cameron retired last year.  Nice for you to catch up I guess, but don’t forget to ask if he’s seen the arm,” Lestrade said distractedly, glancing at his watch.  Although he attempted to be punctual, it seemed as if Lestrade’s life always existed half a minute behind everyone else’s.
The ensuing scramble around the desk nearly took out at least two desks and four nearby angels.  Luckily, those surrounding had learnt to move quickly where Mallory was concerned.  Once in the office, Lestrade shut the blinds while Sherlock moved to the other side of the desk, glowering menacingly.  Mallory was undeterred.  He was certainly committed to being keen.
Mallory pointed behind him.  “I heard you talking.  There’s only one set of F.A.  If there were two people, there would be two sets of F.A. and two origins of the splinter marks, but there’s only one.”
anyone but I could at least use it for something useful.”  He shrugged and shuffled his feet, suddenly finding the floor fascinating.
The first week was spent running, through streets real and imaginary, tracing and tracking to see if he had any luck on his own.  He didn’t sleep, didn’t eat, and chain-smoked manically .  All his energy was consumed by being ready for the call, spending hours sat in his chair with his eyes trained on the door.
