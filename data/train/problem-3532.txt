tbh meant for this whole thing to 3rd person omniscent -
The bullying didn’t end. It lessened for sure, as he was no longer the new kid.  It wasn’t a novelty to bully him, just a bit of boredom relief when they needed it.  Jack complained less during the car rides home, or during calls on bus rides.  He had started to recluse himself.  He learned to lie, as things had started to become far too obvious.
Christmas part 1 with everyone
Jack just looked down.  He wasn’t really sure what to say.
“I do, but I can’t. Literally.”  He said, his voice low.
“It was your turn to do the dishes, Cas.  Five days ago.  They’re still here-”  Sam said, before turning and realizing it was Jack  “Oh, hey, sorry.  You doing ok?”  Sam asked, his voice turning a full 360.
“Yes.”  He said, quietly.
He cursed himself silently, as he pulled a plate of pancakes out of the fridge, which had his name on it - funnily enough.
“You’re staring at me, almost like I’ll explode.”  Jack observed.
The pain was interesting; usually his body could heal any ailments real quick, but this, well it seemed to be a larger issue - that couldn’t just be healed up.  It was another sign that everything he was doing, it was more than just some attempt to fit in - if it was, he would’ve stopped by now, yet he was still completely obsessed.
Jack dashed to the door - his mood changing in a second.  He hadn’t felt horrible, at least not as he usually would, until now.  It all changed - and now he felt like an absolute failure.
Jack waited for a second, for Sam to leave - and when he didn’t, Jack knew he was completely screwed.
Jack was awkward.  He found the large array of food terrifying, and the fact that he couldn’t hide under layers of clothes even more so.  Sam insisted they don’t all hide in layers of jackets, so Jack had to let others see his body, even just a bit.  A flannel wasn’t enough cover.  He basically felt naked.
He was fine, really.
Watching it, he couldn’t even think - he just couldn’t fathom existing at all.
750-850 a day, sometimes 4500, but that seemed rare.
“And you’re planning to finish it right?”  Dean asked, his voice stood firm.  Jack just nodded.
By the time he had entered the third trimester of the year, the bullying had almost completely diminished, as he integrated himself into the school.  He was no longer new at all, just the weird skinny kid who never ate.  He was now just struggling with himself, and the addiction to the starving.  There were no longer any outside problems, just Jack facing Jack.
Jack just shrunk.  Dean had started liking him, until this moment.
It was a red day, so Jack had Math, Theater, PE, and English.  He didn’t hate these days, he really just didn’t like PE.  It was mentally taxing to just exist in the gym, let alone strip to his underwear in front of other people.
The awkward feeling remained.  Cas was silent, but that wasn’t uncommon.  It was Sam’s silence that really bothered Jack.
Jack was quiet, and with it he stared down the fries.  He wanted to eat them,  really, but it felt as if he couldn’t.  Something was stopping him.
It was for more food - because apparently the treatment for eating disorders wasn’t therapy, but forcing food down his throat, and Jack found it completely stupid.
Jack found himself in his room once again - hiding from the footsteps in the hallway - he currently didn’t have a puke bag in his room, thankfully, but he was awaiting the bathroom to be freed up, so he could go puke the breakfast he had forced down his throat - which was a little too much - causing his stomach to actually hurt - a new problem that was arising.
“Well yeah, you told me not to.”  Jack pointed out, tugging at the sleeve on his wrinkled flannel.  He stood by the stairs, and one-by-one ended up giving the shortest of hugs to everyone who walked towards him.
“How’s school?”
“Jack, hey, you’re awake.”  Sam breathed.  Jack just crashed back down on the pillow, his muscles still disoriented.
The rest of the night seemed to go so smoothly.  Everyone somehow had received something, and Jack had a brand new notebook.  He knew what it was for the moment his hands touched the leather binding.
“Cas?”  Sam said surprised.  Dean had told Sam about what had happened - not the whole story, but Sam knew that Cas was in the Empty, and that it had wrecked Dean entirely.
“I wanted to be healthier.”  Jack lied again, halfway.  He wanted to say everything, just like he used to, but the starving was a monster.  He just lied now.
“Well, there’s something that happens after starving.  He was probably hungry, and experiencing the reactive binging, but without the proper support, his eating disordered brain probably freaked out.  Purging, it produces dopamine; Jack probably needed something to counteract the lack of emotions from the starving.”  She explained - putting the small snippets of information together.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Honestly, I don’t know.  Go see a doctor?  The main thing is that you need to eat, and more than just some cereal or eggs.  I don’t care if you’re a nephilim, you still need food.”  Sam explained.
It left Jack speechless, and even more reluctant to eat anything.  This whole thing made it all worse.
The hunger tended to become painful if he ignored it for too long.
It was easy for the week that he spent alone, but when they came home, he realized that he can’t leave the scale in the bathroom, or the notebook on his bed.  He can’t just not eat, or attempt to make versions of food that was super low in calories.  They’d pretty much notice immediately, so he had to get sneaky.
The rest of the morning was chill.  Jack was in his room, doing close to nothing.  He was far too tired to do much else - all he thought about was food.
It didn’t take longer than a few seconds after being done, and he was pretty much already running up the stairs, to try and get it up.
It reminded the brothers of the time where the biggest evil was Yellow Eyes, where they’d road trip to the case, stay in dingy motels, while trying to find their dad.  It was bittersweet.  There was truly a question of “what now?”.
Awkward.
Jack just awkwardly took the plate out of the fridge, and sat at the small table, while Dean shooed Cas out of the room.  He walked to sit across from Jack - which caused Jack’s heart to speed up.
“Jack, uh, he had an issue for a bit.  With food.  He wouldn’t eat...well, not a lot.”  Sam said, tripping over the words - it was obvious that the words were hard to say.
The smell of food seemed to waft through the bunker, as time went on.  It wasn’t a fun notion for Jack, as that meant food was on the horizon, but with other angels - it might be easier to eat close to nothing.
The fall.
Jack started walking, as running wasn’t the biggest thing on his list.  He just struggled through the heaviness in his body, until he spooked when someone touched his shoulder.
Jack nodded slowly, and she sat at the edge of his bed, before peeking at his laptop.  Jack’s cheeks grew red, mainly with embarrassment.
Once Dean had come back with an extension cord, Cas figured out how to top the tree.  They definitely didn’t use an angel to top the tree.
Smells seemed to seep in and out of his nose as he walked down.  Pizza was the strongest smell, and the most terrifying.
Jack ended up pulling a hoodie over his torso, after getting the energy to get off of the bed.  He trudged his way into the kitchen, still hungry, but hopeful that today would be different.  He wouldn’t end up ravenous enough to eat the entire kitchen - but part of him feared that he would.  It wasn’t like before, his iron desire to starve was gone - leaving the human part of him just hungry.
They promised they’d let themselves have a break once humanity was safe, and now, well they did just that.  They promised they wouldn’t hunt, not for a while.  It took time, healing.  The processing of everything that had happened after Sam left college.
Jack pulled his small duffel out of the trunk, and followed Sam to the door.  He wasn’t awfully tired, but the post-purge exhaustion was different.   It was much more of the body being weighed by limbs that felt far heavier than they should be, and his heart beating just slightly too fast, which made it uncomfortable.
Jack found himself zoning from the discussion in the class.  The teacher was going on about tragic heroes, and Jack found himself thinking of everything else.  Food especially.  He was excited to get home, so he could eat.
“Sorry.”  He noticed one of Taylor’s old friends behind him.  Dread washed over him, as he braced himself for the teasing to start again.
“If you ever need anything, you’ll let me know, right?”  Dean asked.
Observing himself in the mirror, naked, as per usual.  He noticed the dead look in his eyes.  The pale skin.  Even his grace didn’t have the energy to keep him completely healthy.  His body wasn’t invincible - no, it felt pain.
“Well, at the start, yes, but now I don’t know anymore.  I just do this because I feel like I have to.”  Jack explained.
“I don’t want to stop.”  Jack said, letting himself feel something.
He started to try and hide when kids began to walk in.  Friends, and Jack never felt more alone.  Cas wasn’t there, and the last time Jack used his powers around others, he killed someone.  Jack felt like nothing without his powers  He was just a kid, naive, and broken.
He was sick of it, and it seemed that this had only been going on for a few months, hilariously so.  He found himself feeling horribly invalid just from length alone - most stories talk of those who’ve had these issues for years, but Jack assumed things changed between disorders, because no human being can do what he’s been doing without getting pretty ill.  Being a Nephilim was coming in handy - just for the sheer power of keeping him alive through the trash he was addicted to.
“Oh… I’m really sorry Dean, really.” That was Jody. She seemed really sorry, and Dean could not bear that anymore. He had to leave this place, he had to find a place to be alone. He wanted to cry. He wanted his angel back.
“Dean, we don’t have time anymore. Chuck already started destroying the big cities, we have to hurry up. I want to see Cas again too, but we don’t have time.”
In the hunter’s eyes, he could see that he was thinking about Castiel too. Since the angel died, Jack had been able to feel Dean’s guards being let down. He talked to him, he listened to him talking. Once, Dean even hold him tight, letting him cry for a solid hour. Jack was feeling safe again around him, he was feeling loved, and understood. They both had lose one of the most important people in their life, they both lose their parents without being able to tell them I love you a last time, and they understood each other. Not that Sam couldn’t understand this feeling, he also lost his parents, but it was different. Dean and Jack understood each other about the loss of their parents, but it was also the loss of Castiel that made them feel close. And even if Sam and Castiel were very good friends, they didn’t have the same relationship.
In the afternoon, after lunch, they came back to their reading. But once again, it was just... Useless. Pointless. They realized they didn’t have anything left, their world was going to go down, they were going to die, all of humankind was going to disappear, and it was just because God wanted them to follow his rules, but they never agreed to, because they always wanted their liberty. They were the only Sam and Dean in all the universe who did this, and God punished everything he ever created because of them.
“Ok. Where do we start guys? Defeating God? Finding the angel?” asked Dean.
The next morning, they woke up feeling refreshed. The feeling didn’t last when, during breakfast, they received a text from Jody. She sent them a video she took of her TV while watching the news. All we could see was New York city’s building collapsing for no reason, their debris blocking streets, and people running everywhere trying to find a shelter. Along with the video, Jody sent a message “does that has any link with why you had to leave us Miracle?”. Dean cursed, and looked at Jack.
The demon gaped at them. Every demon on Hell knew about the Winchesters, and only the most powerful of them tried to take them down at this point. The minor demons like he was didn’t even try, they avoided them as much as possible. And, since he didn’t want to die, he asked them to follow him, and went directly to the throne room. He opened the door, and announced the Winchesters.
“No. We find a way to bring Cas back, and then we find a way to kill this son of a bitch. The four of us.” Answered Dean, without taking a single second to think about that.
“It sure is. We’ll tell you, if we win. Otherwise, we won’t even have to.” Sam responded.
The day after, they left the Bunker pretty early. They didn’t want to be late, and they didn’t have anything to do left here, so they hit the road right after breakfast and Miracle’s daily walk. Dean would have to explain this ritual to Claire, since it seemed really important for his dog, and the only time they didn’t went for a walk together in the morning, Miracle had felt betrayed, and decided to ignore everyone for the whole day, scaring them when he disappeared for two hours, only for coming back and asking for food like he didn’t almost made Dean have a heart attack.
« No. I… It’s probably nothing. Just a feeling. Isn’t this trench coat familiar to you ? »
“Hey guys. Eileen is still sleeping, but we should probably get to work. With all the resources from the Men of Letters, we could find something useful, about Cas or God.”
Jack’s voice was full of rage, of despair, of sadness. He was young, and those emotions were strong, really strong. Feeling one of them was already hard, but now, he was feeling the three of them, at the same time. Jack didn’t know how to react, his blood was pulsing, his eyes were full of tears, his fists clenched. He made a sudden movement of rage with his hand. And the table, he hadn’t even touched, was thrown to the other side of the room.
« Castiel.. »
At some point, Dean realized he was only talking about Cas now, but he didn’t stop. He continued talking about all the fight they had, the time they found each other back, all the times Cas saved him. He talked about those movies night they had together, when Jack and Sam were away. Dean found himself smiling at the remembrance of Castiel asking him so much questions that Dean had to put the movie on pause every two minutes.
They stayed like that a long time, without a word addressed to each other. And then, Dean smiled, and came close to Jack so he could hug him tight.
Dean hugged Jody really tight, thanking her, and took a step back to explain for the hundredth time to Claire how to take care of Miracle. She only responded with an eye roll, and she smiled briefly, Kaia holding her hand. Dean didn’t know if he would be alive tonight, he didn’t know if he would survive having his soul touched, or if he would survive the blast that will follow. But he felt at peace, he felt at home.
All of them agreed, and they all went to their room. Even Jack, who didn’t need much sleep, went in his room, even if wasn’t going to sleep, he wanted to feel like everything was normal. The only one who stayed longer out of his room was Dean. He wanted to sleep, but also... He needed to do something else, before going to sleep. He walked to Castiel’s room, the one he stayed the most in when he was at the bunker. He sat on the bed, and looked at the place. It was empty but he felt safe here, as if Castiel was still protecting him, even dead, like he always did. Dean stayed on the bed for a while, until he saw a tape player on the desk. He didn’t know that Castiel owned one of these things, he never saw him listen to music, except when Dean forced him during road trip. He opened the player, to see if there was a tape in it, and his heart skipped a beat. There was a tape in it, and not every tape. There was the mixtape he made him, with his favorite Zeppelin’s songs. Dean never had realized that Castiel actually cared about this mixtape, he thought that the angel left it somewhere, in a drawer or anything, and that he never really thought about it anymore, but it seemed like Cas listened to it, more than once. Dean should have put it back in the player, but he just couldn’t. He kept it in his hand, while he left the room, going back to his.
« Absolutely not. Dean, you sure you’re alright ? You seem nervous since we defeated Chuck. You probably should get some sleep, I haven’t seen you sleep much lately. I should drive tonight, to get us back at the bunker. »
“Dean, Sam is right. Today was full of emotions, we should take some time off. He said that he’ll go slowly, tomorrow or today won’t do a big difference, but it will for us.” Eileen said.
The paper in Dean’s pocket made a rustled sound when he stood up, which intrigued Dean. He didn’t remember having a paper on his pocket, and when he took it off, he realized it was the one with the ingredient for the supposed cure for Nephilim’s power. Looking at it, he realized for the second time how odd those words in capital letter were. He never saw any list of ingredients using words in capital letter, even for emphasize. It was even more strange considering the fact that the person who supposedly wrote this list did not put any word in capital letter in the other thing he wrote in the men of letters books. And, another odd thing, was that only one ingredient was in normal letter.
Kevin had been in Hell for years now, and it never had become easy. This place was all about torture, loneliness... Time was different, here in Hell. For him, it has been decades, suffering here, after God lied to him and the Winchesters by sending him here, because He didn’t need the prophet anymore. Kevin was, for the demons, just another soul, he never made a trade or anything. His death could have been worse, it could have been like Dean’s journey in Hell, at least, he never had to do the choice of torturing people or being tortured. Today was just another day, as he saw hundreds before, but it seemed different. Demons seemed to be waiting for someone, and they still hadn’t started the tortures, which was odd since they normally did at this hour of the day. Kevin only understood what was happening today when he saw three figures approaching. He could recognize two of them really easily. Sam and Dean Winchesters. The one for who he died, and for whom he would die again, a thousand times if they needed it. They were two of the best humans he ever met in his short life. Kevin could recognize the Winchesters boys, but the third person? He never met this woman in his life. He only understood that she was important when all of the demons knelt before her. The women approached him, a satisfied look on the face. She loved seeing people knelt before her, she loved being powerful, Kevin could see that. The Winchesters followed her close, and they were smiling at the boy.
Dean was close to God now, he still had tears in the eyes, but he calmed down. Because at least, now, he didn’t have the feeling that something was wrong. Because what was wrong was the fact that he didn’t remember Cas, but now he did, and he felt complete again.
“I told you. I don’t want to save the world if Cas is not with us. If we have to see this world end, I want him to be here, with us. I need him, Sammy, I really do.” Dean was sincere, and his voice was steady. He would never abandon Cas, he was his priority. For the first time in his entire life, his priority was not Sam or saving the world, it was Castiel, his angel.
When Dean woke up the next morning, the mixtape had not left his hand. He fell asleep holding it, and it was the first night in weeks where he actually slept well. It felt weird, feeling refreshed in the morning. After a minute, he moved to sit on the bed, and this movement woke up Miracle, sleeping on the floor in front of him. The dog jumped to go see his owner. It was like a tradition, every morning, Miracle would wait for Dean to wake up, and he would greet him. Dean felt great with this dog, which was funny considered his hatred for animals. But Miracle was not an ordinary dog, he was the only thing alive when God made everyone disappear, and he had been the miracle Dean was waiting for to keep going. When Jack brought him back, after Chuck’s fall (or what it seemed to be), Miracle immediately recognized Dean, and didn’t want to leave him anymore, and Dean was just happy with that.
Hope you'll enjoy today's chapter <3
Kevin frowned. It seemed serious, and even if Dean and Sam had to fight serious things before, this time seemed worse. They went to him, not even sure Kevin would be able to help them, while they had Donatello, still alive and well, that could definitely help them, but they chose to come to him. He was flattered but worried at the same time. Because it could only mean that there was a problem.
Dean was not sure. His brother may be right after all, maybe he was overthinking the situation and nothing had really happened, maybe she was like that because she thought of something, maybe because she thought it was a bad idea trying to bring Castiel back… So many possibilities. Dean was probably just overthinking, like he always tends to do. He had to trust Rowena, he had to have faith, and believe that everything was going to be fine, that Chuck didn’t really decided using Rowena against them.
Hi guys!
When they arrived in Hell, the three boys immediately find what they were going to search. A demon, surprised to see them here, and already ready to fight them.
Finally, they were all ready, and they would start soon. Sam was still at the same place, a few feet away from Jack and Dean, who were face to face. Dean was standing straight, still smiling. Jack had stopped shaking, and looked way more confident. When Sam announced that he was ready whenever they were, Dean nodded slightly, giving Jack the green light.
Even if he hated searching things in books (that was more his brother’s thing, he wanted to do the action, not searching how to do it), this time, he was actually fine with it. He wanted all of this shit to be over, he wanted to be free, for the rest of his days. He wanted to retire, and to go to the beach, Sam, Cas and Jack next to him. He wanted to live, really. He wanted to be happy. So he stood up, and was the first one going to take a book.
“Then just shut up and come here so I can
A confused grin crosses Dean’s face. Talking about it was giving him a headache. He knew deep down how he felt, who he was, but his whole life pointed to the other direction and after that New Years, Dean did everything to keep those feelings buried and hided, even from himself.
“Don’t worry Cas, when I’m tired enough I’ll pass out.”
-Dean, I don’t own “a cloud” – Seeing Cas using his fingers to say that warmed Dean’s heart and put a beautiful smile on his face, that’s for sure. - I don’t think I can return to Heaven at all.
-Who’s behind it?
wants you to want to kiss me.
“Do you love him now?”
He didn’t even remember finding Sam, or even putting Jack on his lap, Dean just remembered the picture of Jack safe with his brother inside his head and then he left.
for a case anyways?”
“Not feeling like talking, Cas”
Dean’s mind have been going a thousand miles per hour since they left the torture room, but now it seems to be impossible for Dean to understand any kind of information.
Half of the Bunker. Dean had to walk half of the Bunker and Jack's still awake.
them more than anything.
-You’re telling me you haven’t think about kissing again since the moment we stopped like I am? – The angel is shy and Dean could swore that if he were human he would be blushing.
Repeat after me: all my homies hate John Winchester. Fuck him.
Hope you enjoy, let me know what you think about the story in the comments.
-You think I don’t know you? There is no way of knowing someone more than seeing their soul. I saw yours. You saw my true form, we both know each other well enough to see who we really are. And Dean, you are
Dean Winchester, hunter, saved the world multiple times, had eyes glued in him in every bar he walked by, now taking care of the Devil’s baby, who is growing up incredibly fast.
-But I wanna kiss you…
“It's what we did.”
-So 30 years being tortured and 10 years torturing were, what? Three and one month?
like, not one of those kids songs.”
-Screw you!
“You’re so not getting Baby. Take one of the cars in the garage.”
-Yeah, sure. Is just, I don’t think I could do it without thinking about my dad beating me up. Why am I being so open about all of this?
In the morning, he makes his way to the kitchen, happier than ever when he sees there’s fresh coffee already there. Also because Cas is sitting there, looking at his phone.
“Maybe the help could include figuring that out too?” She had a nice laugh, he could make some moves and probably have some fun, and still, he never felt less in the mood than right now.
-I didn’t…
-For a reason. Doing bad things is part of being human, I guess. But that is not the only thing in you. In fact, I only noticed it when
here.
“I can
-Is it going to hurt?
“The -- the price was my life. When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.” Of course the price would be his life, but way say this?
Inside his stupidly long arms, still wrapped in a towel, the source of the crying and screaming was moving to every possible direction. That was until he saw Dean and decided that that was where he was going, one way or another.
“Is still good to hear it.”
“That ought be hard.”
-I know how to hide, Dean. Strategy, warrior in command, remember? But is hard to hide a human soul, especially
-There isn’t another way. I wish you didn’t have to do all of it again.
-So, sore losers. You guys crying over losing a battle is how rain happens?
-You’re kidding, right? Did you not see all that crap?
Cas waited only one second after Dean finished his coffee to talk again
“We’re going to be the sappiest, most disgusting couple there is, aren’t we?”
“We don’t do a lot of choosing in this life, if you haven’t notice.”
-Sorry. Each Circle of Hell contains and punishes one kind of sin. Like I said, Circle 8 is about Fraud. Circle 7 is about Violence, to others, to themselves, against God. Circle 6 is Heresy, Circle 5 is Wrath, Circle 4 is Greed, Circle 3 is Gluttony, Circle 2 is Lust and Circle 1 is some sort of limbo, where pagans who lived morally lives are, Heaven couldn’t take them, neither did Hell.
What did he expect anyways, telling stories about Cas every night and then just wishing the kid didn’t understand and would never mention it? Mention
-But you are Dean Winchester…
You can’t really do much without him, can you? Even when you had him by your side, he would always have to “discipline” you, right? What about that time your little brother shot a deer when it was supposed to be you shooting Bambi? You think he still loved you after that? Has he ever? – Dean was tired of it, of always be expected to reach expectations of others, and especially John’s.
“Oh, that makes me feel so much better.”
-We still have to pass through the Ante Inferno.
-I want to have you craved in me at all times. My guardian angel, savior, sexy boyfriend, ya know, the whole package.
-Why?
-Dean, I promise you, one day I will be able to make you see yourself the way that I do. And is not just me, Dean. Anyone from Heaven or Hell can see it too. That’s why those demons and gods hate you so much, they never saw someone like you, at the same time they wish they were exactly the same as you.
“Don’t do this Cas.”
-I get it, but is my little brother we’re talking ‘bout here. Please, Cas.
-I hate you…
think about coming back, about talking to your brother or so help me God I’ll kill you, I don’t want Sammy any near this thing that’s inside of you, is probably contagious. Get out or I’ll burn everything in your room and I won’t check if you’re inside of it or not before I do so.
-It worked! Holy crap it worked! Come here you sexy angel, lemme kiss you properly.
-I think you should try to deal with it when you go back. Your father’s actions and believes shouldn’t define you.
The Limbo, they are almost out of there.
“Sam’s a jerk who takes pictures without people knowing it.”
“Dude, just some tricks to make him shut up.”
“Goodnight.”
Dean looked in Cas’s eyes. He was really doing it, huh? After years of rejection and self-hatred, Dean allowed himself to do something he wanted to do since he saw Cas’s true form. Everything inside of him was screaming that that was wrong,
-Can you even put my body back together? Sammy cremated me, and it was a long time ago, years.
Dean and Castiel were on their way to get out of Hell, and somehow they didn’t stumbled in many demons, the few they happened to see would be terrified of the angel, and Castiel would kill them with the very touch of his hand.
-I didn’t mean to make you cry, Dean. I…
-And you can’t break an order ever once in a while?
“Dean I understand you may feel mad about my timing but I am
“Again, you choose to believe that, I didn’t.”
“He can scream, believe me, I know.”
“’Night, Cas”
-So my soul will be divide like freaking Voldemort. If you ever meet him, don’t tell Sam I know this.
“I was at a bar, Sam.”
“Here, you should keep this. Usually he doesn’t
-How is it like? Being an angel?
-No, you’re right. It was your first kiss ever?
-Is okay, Dean, I’ll watch over you. We’ll remember. There’s one thing you can’t change, Chuck. Dean Winchester is saved!
Jack is almost talking. He tries to copy whatever the boys are saying in the middle of a fight about something stupid and that’s what makes them stop. They don’t know what to do. People usually try to make their kids say something related to them first. But what would they encourage Jack to say? “Daddy”? It doesn’t feel right. Yes, they’re raising him, but something is missing, like they need permission from someone to consider themselves that.
– The silence was enough for Dean to understand it. If he thought he messed up before… Now it was a whole new level. – Cas, I’m so sorry – Dean said in a soft voice.
-It is the only way out.
-So Cas-- can I call you Cas? – Dean didn’t ask people if they were ok with nicknames, but after seeing how easily the angel put demons to a nap, he certainly didn’t want to piss him off.
-It did, Dean, it worked.
“Dean…” Devotion. Cas always says his name with a touch of devotion, like every time Dean says something is his fault, every time Dean puts himself down, Cas has this particular tone of utter devotion, like Dean is committing blasphemy, like Dean himself is something sacred in Cas’ head. But he’s not. And Cas has to know this, even if is the last thing Dean does, because Dean doesn’t deserve to have such a heavenly being devote himself to him when he’s the cause of his death.
“People need our help.”
Cas slowly takes Jack on his arms and freezes, but then Jack snuggles his way just like he does with Dean and Cas finally relaxes.
-Yes!
-And that is?
an ordinary human, you are
-That’s supposed to make me feel better? Look at this, it’s all shattered, very obviously from all the horrible things I’ve done.
-You need to have faith, then. And how hard it is for you to understand? I’m an angel. I’m sure I’m speaking your language.
-I fucking love you, Cas.
Dean’s response surprised both of them. Yes, when he thinks about it he still feels weird, he still remembers how John taught him in many different ways that it was wrong, he still knows he’s messed up and that he will have a lot of problems dealing with it. The thing is, when he was with Cas, he didn’t think about that. He didn’t think of anything other than
-“I am Icarus. Many people see my death as a tragedy; that is very wrong. In my opinion, they did not tell you, when Apollo gave me wings, they did not tell you that I knew I would burn in flames, I knew. You see, I knew the agony I would face, and as I fell, I knew I did it for the
Now Dean’s mind was torn in two. One part was thinking about what else he would face in Hell, and then what he will face when he’s back on Earth. The other part was thinking non stop about how Cas was beautiful, how he never saw anything like it, how now he wish he’d touched his wings, the only part that seemed physically touchable. Castiel was the opposite of what Dean ever believed in his life and it was difficult to his mind to understand that, but it was the facts. Cas is real, and he’s an angel. An
A shiver passes through Dean’s spine. She was there with Alastair in some moments. She would also offer him a way out of his misery. He said no, for 30 years. The things they did to him…
-Dad? Is this really you? Or just a memory?
-Huh…
-Hum, no.
“No problem.”
-See what?
-I think I understand that.
-What’s the matter, Castiel, didn’t you miss me?
It could be minutes or hours, but eventually Cas was there in his room, putting a chair beside his bed, which just made Dean turn the other way around and if Cas noticed him punching his pillow, he didn’t say anything.
“Sure, Cas.”
“Didn’t do it for Jack, did it for you.”
Sam sounds alarmed so Dean lets the hunter inside of him take over. He just passed out last night so he’s dressed and he only takes his gun and runs to the library, making sure Jack’s room it's locked on the way.
of there.
The weird little guy says that like it was easy, like Dean have done this a thousand times. Maybe he has.
What, just because he has sweet eyes you suddenly believe in God? Aren’t you a romantic, to think someone so stunning like him can only be a true creation of God?
Dean is happy that he doesn’t. He doesn’t see himself like ‘Jack’s Daddy’, ‘cause he doesn’t want to be. He never did. He tried the dad thing. First with Sam and look how that turned out. Then with Ben, and that wasn’t a good experience in the end either.
stop it. There’s no real choice here. - Chuck snapped his fingers, and two more people, creatures, were with them. –Naomi here will take Castiel to Heaven and will clean his head; new memories will be in that little angelic brain by the time you meet again on Earth. As for you, Dean, Lilith will take you back and when you get to Alastair, your memories will already be changed.
Dean let go of Cas’s arm and did just what he wanted, what he needed to do for so long. John’s face was almost unrecognizable after a while, Dean’s hand was red with blood. His soul had an awkward configuration, with gold and green fighting against black and red.
They tried to pass through it, and they did. Cas kissed Dean once they were out.
“’Cause I was a mess! ‘Cause you died on me,
-Only you did, Cas. Is ok, I get it, you’re an angel, I’m just an annoying human who’s demanding things.
Dean’s eyes were filled with tears, something made his stomach feel different, like the freaking butterflies teenagers feel.
Because this is real, this isn’t a dream that will become a nightmare the moment he figures it out.
he deserved to be remembered, to be celebrated even.
-Yes, your life had traumatizing moments, but somehow you managed to go through all of it and remain pure. It takes a lot to do that.
-Listen to your human, Castiel. Easy way or hard way? You can still choose.
“Dean, finally! Can’t you pick up the fregging phone for once?”
It doesn’t last long though, because way too soon, Jack takes his first steps, and now he wants to walk everywhere, and they need to pay extra attention on him. He likes to bite stuff too, should a baby have so damn strong bites even without teeth? And of course he couldn’t care less to the toys
“Shut up, it’s a classic. And he’s smarter than you think. Why were you even
-Cas, did it work?
-It’s okay, Dean, I’m right here. All the way through, with you.
“I know.” And he sound so soft… Like he’s okay with the idea of them both dying in this room.
-I love you too, Dean.
not me, at least not until I try to interfere. You will fight and I will be close enough to collect that piece of your soul inside of the Custosanimaer.
Dean’s soul was reduced to a little sparkling spot, and still, shining like never before, the black and red almost all gone, gold and green taking place of it.
-Easy there, I may have missed some birthdays, but does that makes me that much of a terrible father?
Kneeling in from of Dean, with the worst physical pain he ever felt, Cas remembered something a human wrote once, something that he wasn’t sure if it followed the mythology right, but couldn’t be closer to how he felt about Dean, about what was happening.
-What? No.
For a human, from the moment they met and now, there were six months.
-We are not going to keep being your puppets you sick son of a bitch.
-CAS! CAS, HELP ME!
-Only you could face that. If it’s consolation, I would give anything for you not have to face that. – Dean looks down, suddenly guilty for yelling. Then, a thought crosses his mind.
“What do you mean? It's what we do.”
Hell was molding itself to contain Dean, Lilith wouldn’t let him go away that easy, and they noticed it. Circles 3 and 2, Gluttony and Lust got together to punish Dean all at once. Gluttony preventing Dean to move with chains all around him, hooks piercing his flesh; Lust causing storms of rocks, hitting him.
-Like what?
me to be there when he wakes up, and he probably will sleep the whole night too.”
but at the same time it was like nothing could be more right, something almost
-Ok, so how does the “breaking my soul” part of this yellow brick road back to Earth works?
“Thanks for the help.”
Cas talked more about Heaven, about his siblings, about some of the battles he was in, what he did to win. Sometimes he would say something in a language Dean didn’t understand, which Cas told him was Enochian, his real language, and Dean was amazed by it, silly smile on his face and all.
-I said no, Dean.
“He knows I’m the cool one, that’s the secret.”
“No comments.” Dean bites back everything inside of him trained to defend John ‘cause, okay, it was a shitty thing to put on Dean’s shoulder when he was so young, he can see from where Cas is coming from. “ Dean all the things you did… That’s not someone
Sam is getting better at it. Jack still just sleep when Dean is the one to sing something or tell a story, but he’s fond of Sam now too. Laughs when he does something silly, likes to pull his hair just like Dean taught him.
“Do you want him to keep crying? Give me him, Sam.”
-Hey, Dad, watch this.
Yep, the exact same rollercoaster of emotions with the subtle change of carnal experience.
“No point, haven’t been able to shut my eye for more than 20 minutes at a time and it pisses me off.”
Dean did as he was told. He couldn’t deny, he was so curious. An angel, right in front of him. A nice one, as far as he could tell.
-In another man’s mouth! Who knows how long this has been going on, or if it was really just a kiss or more? I raised you better than this! Is disgusting, is inappropriate,
Dean’s chest felt heavy, but what could he do? He knew he had to go through that. He was praying for it to be easier to go by.
He drags the moment for as long as possible but eventually goes back to the library, where Sam still has that face and now Cas is smiling just as much.
An ordinary, impure human like him, kissing such a divine and pure creature like Cas, in a place like Hell? That covered all levels of
can you
-Dean, you were tortured by Alastair, Hell’s best torturer, and Lilith herself. No one expected you not to surrender.
to make it his room.”
I’m falling for you in a very human kind of way…
-Dean, are you alright?
-I’m a killer – Dean said in a broken voice, then, he felt Cas’s hand cupping his cheek.
-It has to be another way.
soul is. At the end of the line, they both are creations of his Father, right?
-It could bring up attention of demons.
-We are in Hell and I’m going to torture you, demon didn’t cross your mind? You’re getting’ lazy, boy. Still, we will have so. Much. Fun.
-Well, we didn’t need it for a very long time, like I said. And it can’t be anyone, there are certain bloodlines for each angel.
They walked for some more time; Dean didn’t trust his own mind to keep track of it anymore.
BAM “But I think I know - - I think I know now. Happiness isn’t in the having. It’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.”
“You seem to be thinking hard there, buddy.”
-If you guys are real, then why none of you bastards have ever helped us?
Here it is, guys. The last chapter of the story. I will post the epilogue right away. I hope you enjoyed, and hey, maybe this will be part of someone's head canon as part of the show.
Dean’s eyes showed his confusion.
An awful sound comes from behind him and he knows, he just knows that’s the Empty. This can’t be happening again. Why is the Empty here? He didn’t say it back. He couldn’t say it back because of this, so this wouldn’t happen…
oblivious, or stupid. He just has enough trauma and probably several undiagnosed mental illnesses to make sure he keeps this shit burred. Deep,
-We should keep goin’.
-I’m anything but pure – The hunter said a little bit flustered.
-Lobotomy it is, then. – The scream of pain that left Cas’ lips with just one move of Chuck’s finger had to be the worst thing Dean ever heard.
-Then do it. I don’t want some stranger looking into my soul and saying things about it, and I certainly don’t wanna see this ugly thing myself while I have to go all the way through Hell.
That made Dean stop.
kind of fun.”
The Circle of Heresy, where Dean faces some old enemies.
Cas looked around. Maybe if they were quick… That could make Dean trust him more, maybe even realize how beautiful
so little… “Poor kid.”
At this point, Cas only hide Dean’s soul to make it harder for demons to find them, not that there was much left of it. But Dean made sure to let Cas know that hide it was just that, because of demons, Dean didn’t mind Cas seeing it anymore.
-Shut it. – There were tears in Dean’s eyes, John looed stressed and had his hand on his chin – Just, shut it.
Silence.
-Yes. She rebelled, she choose not to be an angel anymore.
Dean couldn’t be the cause of so much pain to Cas. Not after falling so hard for him, not after everything Cas went through to get him out of Hell, not after making Cas decide to abandon everything and everyone he ever met just to be with Dean. This was to much.
-Let’s get out, then, and we can figured it out when we get back to Earth. Is going to be okay, Cas.
-You’ll rot in here forever and I couldn’t be happier. When I get back to Earth, I’m going to be myself for the first time in my life just to know that you’ll hate that.
“Jack’s starting to talk, he picks up on what we say, so we’re holding back”
“Don’t let him blackmail you into singing.”
Still, his ego wasn’t bruised whatsoever. Even after begging for something that didn’t happen. He would keep begging every second of every day for the rest of his life if he thought that that would do any good.
“Yeah Jack, I do have a black car, don’t I? You know that already, don’t you? So darn smart, kid, I’m telling you, you keep this up, you can get into Stanford just like Sam.”
“What? Are you sure? Dean, are you entirely sure?” asked Sam, suddenly really concerned and almost scared.
Dean often stayed late, with a beer in the hand, making his research. Tonight was one of those nights, but he wasn’t alone. Jack, who almost didn’t sleep, was sitting on the stairs, petting Miracle who was already asleep. The bunker was calm, and Sam was probably sleeping or talking to Eileen, who was still on her hunt, that seemed more difficult that what she had initially planned. Dean was happy for his little brother, even if he often liked to mock him, because that was what big brother are for, but he really thought that Eileen was the best thing that Sam could have ever expected. She was one of them, a hunter, she was funny, comprehensible, smart, she definitely was the best match for a guy like Sam. Dean only wished that when everything was finally over, the two lovebirds could have a great life, with 2,5 stupid kids and a stupid house with a labrador or any stupid dog you could see in those « perfect families ». He didn’t see himself living this life, but it was what Sam wanted, he was almost sure of that. Dean, him, just wanted to live happy. On the road or a cool apartment or anything cool that Sam would not want. But in every dream life Dean had, Castiel was here, by his side.
“Hey buddy. It wasn’t your fault, you know that? We all thought we beat this son of a bitch, that we finally won our free will. It’s not your fault if he just manipulated us. It’s what he does, what he always did and what he will always do.” Dean told him.
Sam finished his narrative by the incident at the bunker. This part really caught Rowena’s attention. That was... Surprising. She couldn’t understand why God would have leave Jack with power, if he had stopped trying to get the ending he wanted. It didn’t make sense, it was too dangerous to do. The only option was that…
They had a dozen of DVD to watch, and they were very lucky that Gabriel only let them without any pornographic content, but most of what they watched was useless, and just Gabriel giving advices on random subjects. They had to watch 5 of those videos before actually finding something useful. Gabriel looked really serious on this one, more than they ever saw him actually.
When they hit the road, the sun already began to decline, and the night was close. Dean was in the passenger seat, trying to fall asleep, but he just couldn’t. He wasn’t even thinking about the fact that the person driving Baby wasn’t him. It was worse than being afraid for his car, it was, again, this feeling that didn’t leave him, and that got worse since he saw this stupid trench-coat. He couldn’t forget about it, and he didn’t know why. Maybe someone he couldn’t save wore one. But he remembered almost every face he wasn’t able to save, why wouldn’t he this time ?
Sam started translating, after finishing his coffee. It took a while, since the man was half asleep, and Dean was feeling nervous during the whole time his brother stayed silent. When Sam finally finished translating, he had a smile on his lips, which made Dean’s stress go away. A smile like that is always a good thing, isn’t it? Sam wasn’t smiling sadly, it was pure pride, happiness and confidence. It was definitely a good thing. His brother had good news.
For the whole morning, they didn’t stop reading. Eileen joined them when she woke up. They didn’t find a thing during the whole morning. Not even a single line with the most insignificant information. They always used to find useful things in the men of letter’s lore, but this time, it was like they were on their own. They spent their whole life controlled by Chuck, and now they just felt left alone. Somehow, Dean hated the feeling, but at the same time, it was one of the best things he ever experienced. He didn’t think that this time, their action was controlled by God. He told them that he was tired this time, that he wouldn’t try again, and he believed him. God was stubborn, but not stupid, oh no. God was even somehow too intelligent. He had his chances, many times, of controlling them. None of them worked, Dean knew that God would stop trying this time. Now, they were really on their own. And they will defeat him, because they had to. So, yes, it will be difficult, so much more difficult that their life normally is, but it’ll worth all the struggle, because at the end of the day, they will kill God.
“I can’t risk to lose you too, Sammy. I can’t risk to see you die too.” His voice broke a little at the end of his sentence.
“Gabriel... Wait, Gabriel wrote this thing? And what is the code you’re talking about?” Sam replied, looking at his brother, and not at the paper he put on the table.
The young woman, Claire, laughed when Miracle jumped on her, happy to have some attention. Dean turned around and smile. Ok, he officially knew that everything was going to be fine for his dog, Claire will take good care of him. The blond girl didn’t even look at the Winchesters before Miracle finally decided that he had had enough attention, and came sitting next to Dean, who patted his head with a smile on his lips.
At the end of the evening, they all went in their room, and tried to sleep. But as much as they needed it, none of them were able to fall asleep this night, except Miracle, asleep in Dean’s bed, with him petting him, trying to fall asleep. He finally stopped trying, because it was pointless, and he was feeling worse every second he spent in the dark, trying to stop thinking about God, Cas, and the entire world that was going to collapse because of him. He made sure not to wake Miracle up, and went in the kitchen, where he saw Jack, sitting in front of the table, eating pb&j. Dean cleared his throat, making sure that the Nephilim was aware of him being in the room, and came close to him, sitting in front of him.
“We don’t have time anymore. We have to do it now, understand? We thought we had time but we obviously don’t anymore. Sammy when will you be ready for the hiding spell?” Dean asked, anger tangible in his voice.
“Yes. Please. That was the reason I came. Jack has his power back, we found a way. But… Yeah. We can’t find anything on how to bring someone back from the Empty. I know that Crowley had a lot of stuff that helped us before, maybe you can find something too.” Dean replied, still nervous. Rowena had not made any comment on the story he had told to her, and it seemed like she was not going to say anything on it. Dean didn’t like that, she usually loved to give her opinion, even when they didn’t ask for it, but now that he was expecting it, nothing.
Sam woke up with a start, when he felt a weight on his chest, and burst out laughing when he realized it was just Miracle, the dog Dean adopted, here to wake him up, while Dean was at the door.
Dean choked, trying to find something to say. Of course, she was right, but he didn’t expect her to call him out on his bullshit. And suddenly, he was talking about Castiel again. Suddenly, he was back two days ago, when he had to say for the first time out loud what had happened the day Cas died. He talked without stopping for a few minutes. His eyes were itching, but he was not crying. He could not cry, he felt like all of his tears had leave his body, it was probably due to the fact that he had cry more those past few months than he had his entire life.
« Hey sleeping beauty. Wake up, I found a new case » Dean said, already walking out, Miracle following him.
“Screw this. Screw all of this.” the hunter said, looking and sounding so disappointed.
“Calm down boy. We’re not here to fight, we just want to see your queen.” Said Dean to the demon.
Jack struggles with reactive hunger
It was disgusting truly, but still his own way to cope.
“Sometimes it’s hard to be around new people, especially after everything you’ve been through.  It’s ok to not feel like you belong, especially because you’re not human.”  Cas explained.  Jack had stopped thinking of purging, and started to grow drowsy again.
“Was there a girl?  She cute?”  Dean asked.  Jack found himself turning red.
“So, Jack.  It’s your first vamp nest.”  Sam pointed out.  Jack found himself looking up from his clasped fingers.
“She’s just taking a piss out of you.  Nothing she says actually means anything, really.”  Dean explained to Jack, who just took to silence, and stared out the window on the way home.
Cas stood shocked.  He felt horribly about what had happened.  Dean wandered in, confused.
It sucked.  He had gained weight, and now he had to eat when he didn’t really deserve anything.
“Ok, I’ll help.  It wasn’t hard to get.”  Jack said, as he started writing down his own observations, and let the other two put them together, so they had something to turn in by the end of class.
The one thing that seemed to stick was to eat less - so that’s what Jack swore to do.
He stepped on the scale, heart racing.
“He’s right.  Whatever Jack is dealing with, he needs to get through it.  Jack can accept his trauma, but it won’t just go away.”  She explained.
It didn’t feel great.
He walked out and was met with someone having recently left the room - while he was loudly shoving his fingers down his throat.
“We’ve been listening, you won’t speak.  I can’t help you unless you tell me what’s wrong.”  Sam exclaimed, his voice teetering between anger and worry.
“Jack is a nephilim, he can’t die, even if he destroys his body.  That said, Sam is right.  Jack is just as stressed as before.”  Cas said.
He slowly opened the stall door, just to see who was on the other side. It was a large relief to know that it was just Garth.
Dean just shoved Cas aside, and drove for hours, first to see Bobby, then to just eat and puke until nothing else seemed to matter, and with his throat completely burnt out - he went to Lisa, broken, puke on his breath, and having nothing left.
“Yeah, but two weeks isn’t that much.”  Jack said.  He found his fingers shaking just a bit, and he wasn’t sure if it was stress or low blood sugar - assumedly both.
Somehow it felt like a challenge.  Dean was not about to stop some of the only habits that gave him comfort.
He stood with his back to the wall, the water beating down on his skin; he cherished the warmth, as he pulled himself up, and rid of the taste.
“I’m not hungry.”  Jack stated, and as he got up, he just fell back down, hitting the floor with his ribs.  Dean just stared over him.
Jack made sure to not sit across from Dean - another awkward interaction would give him away.
“A therapist, like we were told at the hospital, but you ended up saying no, because it’s weak.”  Jack explained.
(See the end of the chapter for
Of Sam asking what’s wrong if Dean walked out of the bathroom pale, while Hell was breaking loose outside.
“I do not.  I wasn’t granted with the ability to measure lines.”  Cas explained, so Jack just sighed.
Cas was smiting, Sam just got some heads, and Jack found himself with the final three.
Even a Nephilim needed some potassium throughout his system - which flushing loved to diminish.
“Dude, you gettin in?”  Dean yelled, and Jack awkwardly slinked into the passenger seat.
Jack had friends.  Claire obviously - but that’s it.  He just didn’t find anyone he could trust.
“Sam’s clearing dinner, then we bring the pie.”  Dean explained.  Jack ended up turning his back to the array of food, just to keep himself from it.
“Yeah, I bet.”  Sam said, and went back to the stove.  Jack shoved the banana into his mouth, and headed back to the table.
“You ok?”  Dean asked.  Jack pulled his hoodie over his hands - a method of comfort for himself.
“They’re probably gonna be gone, you know, you should eat now.”  Dean pointed out.  Jack could tell there were hints of frustration and some worry in his voice.
“He definitely did - what about lunch?  Meet anyone?”  Dean asked, and then winked into the rear-view mirror.  Jack just shook his head.
“Are you ok?  You haven’t been yourself lately.”  Cas pointed out, and Jack just said he was fine.  He was fine.
Something had changed, until he ate.
These nights were the ones where he’d lean against the sink, and try to let himself feel, after puking and hopping on the scale twice in a minute-span.
Jack quickly finished, and then put the bowl into the sink.  He slinked away from the now crowded kitchen.  It was bad enough with an eye on him, but multiple?  Awful.  There was already enough anxiety when he ate around others.
Dean stood in the doorway, entirely exasperated.  He hadn’t slept since he had contacted Jack, and spent his time pacing in the corridor - waiting for sound to be heard through the doors.
It took a long silence, and Dean getting just a bit angry before Jack could actually speak.  He definitely had moments where only breath came out - and none of the time was spent looking at anything but the floor.
“Then eat.”  Dean said, sternly.  Jack just shoved the sandwich into the backseat.
Dean cleared his throat, and Jack just picked the menu back up, ordered some fries, and kept staring at the window, plotting to either eat just a few, or all of them, and try and get them back up.
“Obviously it wasn’t.  I mean Jack was basically destroying himself.  You saw him, you heard him.”  Sam said, he was starting to get angry.
Jack started finding there to be a numbing that came with not eating as much, and throughout the next month it got worse.  He never ate lunch, sometimes he’d skip over breakfast, and if he did, well, it’d be small.  They never had a crazy rigid food schedule in the bunker as they began to take on more hunts.  When Jack was alone, he’d usually just go for as long as possible without food, and then find something he deemed “safe” to try and fill the empty feeling.
“No, no.  It’s not the greatest thing after alcohol,”  Sam explained.  Jack started peeling the banana, as he walked to the trash can.  “What about you?  I thought you liked the pie?”
“Great, you do that, I don’t even know where I’d start.”  Dean said, pushing aside to the door - which Cas blocked.
“Yesterday begs to differ,”  Sam said, and he held a hand out for Jack, who just pulled his knees closer.  “I promise you’ll feel better when it’s off your chest.”  Sam said.  Jack just sighed.
“Why wouldn’t you want to?  You keep saying you feel like crap, you look like crap, and you don’t want to stop?”  Dean said - clearly ready for an outburst.
It solved nothing.
“What now?”  He asked, annoyed.  She just let out a sigh and walked beside him.
He found it slightly disheartening, how slow things were moving, but it was something.  He was starting to feel some of the hatred let up.  It wasn’t a lot, no, but he didn’t feel he deserved nothing.  It was a stupid, crazy though that had shoved itself into his head after the first month of school - after the whole incident.
Jack had started with chucking his pillows at the walls, and then moved to scratching anything that wasn’t his skin, and then his skin, and then he just zoned out - leaving the spots to bleed.
Jack still ain't happy
“I don’t want it.  I thought I already told you.”  Jack shouted.  He pushed a plate of pancakes back at Sam, pissed.
The question now was “what now?”.
long time no write - but I finished the first draft of my book, and now have some time.
Jack wasn’t sure of the significance of weight - he just knew it measured his body in some way.
“Not really?  So, it is less?”  Cas asked.  Jack just nodded slowly.
Jack wasn’t so sure.  It seemed so many people wanted to join in - just because it was happening.  He knew that they didn’t really do too much, but it was the “cool” thing to do.
“Fine.”  Jack said, and quickly took a few steps backwards, as a chill ran through his body.
It wasn’t the worst thing he’d done, and if it would stop the kids, he was ok with it.
“How, uh, how you feeling?”  Sam asked.  Jack shrugged.
“I don’t know why I do it anymore, honestly.”  Jack said; his voice low.
His dwindling body wasn’t dead yet - and wouldn’t for a long time, but it didn’t feel good.  Not anymore.  Starving didn’t leave him with the same high feeling, no, it just caused other pain to arise.  Headaches, chest pains, stomach issues.
“Any of it.  I don’t like eating, at least not when I don’t have an escape plan.  People notice.  They ask about it.  They know that I’m gaining weight.  They’ll probably go back to making fun of me.”  Jack finally explained.
He heard the screen door close, and turned to see behind him.  Claire ended up on the front steps beside him.
Jack pulled his outermost hoodie over his palms - to try and keep warm, even in the heated school, as his body temperature was still ridiculously low.
“Oh so like, he needs more bananas.”  Dean said in his “I don’t understand, but I sort of know it” voice.
“No.  It feels good.”  Jack said.  He couldn’t lie about the high.  He constantly chased the first binge, the first purge, the first week of starving.  He could never feel good, not anymore.
“I’m a Nephilim, this doesn’t hurt me.”  Jack pointed out.
More chapters?  yea
Something held him.
“He trusts you Dean, besides, you’d definitely benefit from it yourself.”  Cas said.
He just stared at the sandwich with a bit of vigor in his eyes.
Jack couldn’t take it, so he found himself in the kitchen at two am, trying to dig up a box of cereal without making noise.  He didn’t want to get the attention of Cas, who didn’t sleep at all.  If anyone would hear him, it would be Cas.
He was the problem, and there was nothing he could do to get anyone to listen to him.
“He’s not as thin as before - I say that’s progress.”  Dean pointed out.  Sam gave one of his “yeah but” reactions.
Jack awkwardly peed, and walked back to his room.
“You do?”  Jack asked, hesitant.
“So what changed your mind?”  Jack asked, curiously.
Sounds of distress came from another corner of the cave, which sounded too much like Sam being dragged, so Jack had to act quick.   He flew to the sight, and found himself beside Cas, who had acted just as quick.
It wasn’t Dad that brought Dean over the edge.  It wasn’t losing Sam, the first time, nor was it Hell - a year later.  It wasn’t the meeting of Castiel, nor was it Sam saying yes and then jumping into the pit.
“Have I?”  Jack asked, playing stupid.  It was the easiest way out of the whole thing.
“You’ll need to be there for him.  Getting angry won’t do anything.  You need time.  This doesn’t just go away.”  She explained.
“It was a bit off the top,”  Jack lied, and drank the milk from the bowl.  “I’m fine Cas, really.”  Jack reassured him.
The concept of working with other people wasn’t easy - but after this class, Jack found it bearable.  He couldn’t lie - he liked Cole, especially after figuring out his name wasn’t Cory.  He also liked Jane.  They were nice to him - and not in a pity sort of way.  They were actually nice, as if he was a human.
“I met some people.”  Jack said.
It wasn’t easy - no.  After eating again, things don’t quite go the same way.
It seemed almost too fast.
Jack was the one who got pulled down this time; into the dusty and awfully bloody cave.  The fall caught him off guard, and he found some black spots in his vision, before picking himself up, and calling out to the others.
So it was now just a month in, and he started to feel like he was going insane.  The food was a way of control - broken control.  He found it becoming a nightly thing - just something to do before he went to bed.
When he awoke four months later, he noticed the way nothing hurt.  He was hungry, thirsty, and completely confused, but everything he had destroyed, well it felt fine, in tact, actually.
Silence, until Claire got up from the bed.
heyyo
So in other, shorter words, Jack’s eating disorder had developed into bulimia.
Sam handed Jack the small duffel with his clothes, and they all wandered into the lobby while Dean got the key.  Jack found himself shivering even in the heated lobby - his bag heavy on his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well they’re clearly not working.”  Dean said.

Walking into first period was always awkward.  He felt like every eye in the room was on him, but when he looked up, no one cared.  Everyone was either on their phones, or doing last - minute homework, reading the Shakespeare play they had to read - King Lear.
Jack awkwardly ate the cereal, trying to get Dean’s look of disbelief off of his back.
“Did you even read the book?”  The girl on the right asked, Jane.
“I heard you’re in school now, huh?”  She asked.  Jack stood awkwardly, shifting his weight between feet.
He said he loved it, and that he was tired.  It was an excuse to hide in his room, so he wouldn’t be around the snacks on the table.  Dinner was hard enough, but snacks were just there, taunting him.  It would end horribly if he stayed.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was the first time that Sam had noticed the weight loss, but he didn’t feel like prying at the moment.  It would ruin the magic of the night.  Jack didn’t need the stress of confrontation.
He couldn’t just tell anyone he was struggling - not if he wanted to keep doing it.
“Five...foot...ten?”  Jack guessed, but the teacher had just shrugged, so Jack assumed it was fine.  He was given permission to leave, and when he got back to the gym - Taylor was standing, a smug look on her face.
The first few days were weird.  Jack had to make excuses for why he wasn’t eating as much.
“I want to know how uh…”  Dean said, looking at Sam with quite a perplexed expression.  Sam cleared his throat, before just motioning Dean to continue.   “How you feel.”  Dean said, his voice reluctant.
Homeroom was quiet.  He sat in his corner - the one he chose after the ridicule had started - and now he was just here - quiet, as friends was out of the question.  Letting anyone in would be bad news - more than just the eating thing - the whole Lucifer’s son thing as well.
“No, it was already half-empty.”  Jack lied.  He could feel his cheeks turning red, as he felt his stomach begin the pain again.  His face contorted.
Sam was in there, making something.  Jack tried to sneak past for a banana, but ended up tripping on his own feet, again.  It caught Sam’s attention.
Dean loathed the feeling of food more and more, but he was just as addicted as he had been.
“From this morning, yes.”  Jack stated.
Jack basically collapsed on the bed, his legs absolutely exhausted.
I will try to update more now that school closed bc of covid
“I’m not that hungry.”  Jack lied. Sam sighed and shoved a banana to Jack.
He assumed many things, but an eating disorder - no, not Jack, not now.
“As reluctant as I am, I’ll help you find one.”  Dean said.
“I didn’t get your name.”  He asked, quietly.
Sam mentioned the wrist to Dean, who seemed to pass it on to Cas, who seemed more worried now.  It seemed they all were starting to catch on.
Jack climbed into the car, and his shoulders just dropped.
“We’re not doing this right.  None of it.”  Sam pointed out.  Dean looked up, with a mouthful of sad looking pancake.
“No, but I’ll text you later if I need to.”  Jack explained, and he followed her back inside.  The others had packed while he was out.  The table still carried his half-eaten plate of pancakes.  He tried to keep his eyes from meeting Dean’s, who was washing some dishes - every dish.
It scared him - but in the bunker - this was common.
He left his final period of the day early - by about fifteen minutes.  He was making his way to Dean’s car, and ran into one of the kids who had screwed with him months earlier.
“I don’t care if you want it or not - this isn’t something you can just keep doing, we’ve been over this.”  Sam pointed out, trying to keep his cool.
“How did you do it?”  Cas asked, exasperated.
“I’m fine, really.”  He said, and his heart rate increased again.  Jack was avoiding Dean, knowing too damn well that they would stop for food on the way home, and another long argument would be had - all in stares.
“I understand that reference.”  Cas said, and they released from each other.
Jack walked down the stairs, and into the library to do some homework.
And Jack found himself in the bathroom quickly after, heaving into the shower drain until he got anything up.
“Is something wrong?”  Jack asked, after the silence kept on for far too long.
“You’re sorry.  Yeah, for what?  Destroying yourself-”  Dean said, and Jack was about to speak up.  “No, I don’t care if you’re a Nephilim or a human.  This will destroy you.”  Dean said.
Nothing was left.  He had fulfilled his purpose, but he was still here.
The spring had fully come to life, and Jack was still in his flannels and jackets.  Sam questioned it once or twice, Cas much more, but Jack found it easier to twist his words with Cas.  He was able to just lie about stress from school, or just from being a nephilim.
“Is there a right way?  It’s what we were told by that hot nurse.”  Dean said, which caused Cas to glare - but that was dissolved with a wink.
The movement caught the attention of Sam, who quickly walked back into the room.  There was a lot of stress covering his face - and Jack knew what it was from.
The best part of the day was when Dean showed up in the Impala, half an hour later than the end of the day.  He still smelt like smoke, presumably from some form of fire.
“Hey sport.”  Dean said, and chucked Jack a cookie.
“I know, I’ve already asked him about it.”  Dean said.  He was definitely worried, and even when Jack reassured him - it didn’t feel real.
“Support him.  Sit down for one meal, and be gentle.  I think the arguing at the dinner table is stressing him out,”  She said, and looked at her phone.  “Our time is up, I’ll see Jack back here in a few days, and we’ll meet for a family session again in 10 days.”
It never quite went away, and Lisa never quite knew what was up.  Dean had gotten so good at hiding it with his brother, that it was almost too easy now.
“We need to support him.”  Sam said.
Jack ended up at the library table again, with some small plate of whatever Sam had tried to make.  He could trust Sam, and his food.  It was usually better than when Dean made anything.  Jack never really ate any of Dean’s food - the excuse of it being too greasy seemed to work just fine.
“I don’t like it as much anymore.”  Jack lied.  He wanted the pasta, dearly, but no, he couldn’t because it just had too many calories.
Jack found it annoying, that he couldn’t use his powers to prove to the others that he wasn’t incompetent.  He can kick Soccer balls, but his human side was never trained, so he kind of sucked at it.
“Oh no, I-”  Jack tried to deny it.
“School, obviously.”  She said, and Jack nodded slowly.
He’d leave school early on Tuesdays and Thursdays for therapy.  Dean would pick him up in the Impala, and they’d stop to get food.  Jack would pick at it until Dean mentioned it, and Jack would just slowly eat, awkwardly.  He didn’t like eating in the car, especially not with Dean watching over him like a hawk - only through side-eyes.
The bunker was different.  Cas was going a bit crazy with the tree, and Dean kept trying to get the lights to work, but all the sockets were slightly out of reach.
So Dean had picked Jack up from school, and they started the drive to Colorado.  Jack couldn’t really shut up the whole drive.  They had driven the full seven hours, and grabbed a shabby motel for the night - making sure it had a couch for Jack.
“It’s a lot, but I did get to talk to Claire.  That was nice.”  Jack said.  He found the chaos both awful and yet, it wasn’t too chaotic.  This was better than food - which he dreaded.
“Jack still needs help - even if this won’t kill him - it doesn’t make it easier.”  Sam pointed out.
He did stop telling Dean everything on the short trip home.  It just felt weird to do so - as he had the fear of spilling all the secrets, which had Dean assuming it all had ended, so he stopped worrying.
“Wait, what’dya mean?”  Claire asked, concerned.  It was something that Jack hadn’t seen from her, a side that wasn’t so sharp.  With it he wanted his walls to come down - but they stood strong.  No soul could knock them down in their current state.
Dean always told Jack to ignore it.  They were just trying to get on his nerves, and if he didn’t pay attention, they’d stop.  Jack believed it, hoping that it would get better.
“Is something wrong, Jack?  You’ve been picking at your plate for the last ten minutes.”  Cas pointed out.  Jack just shrugged.
But he was also exhausted - his energy dipping back down again.
The tree was Cas’s idea as well, and he absolutely had to choose the largest one, which ended up by the stairs.
“Do you know Geometry?”  Jack asked.
“Conflict?  Everything was perfectly fine before they forced us into this whole therapy thing.”  Dean exclaimed, irritated.
Cas wasn’t as good at support.  He would just reassure Jack that things were ok, but not really know the circumstances.
Dean looked confused, and he exchanged the confused look with Sam, who just mouthed “dinner”.
“You know you can still eat pasta though, right?  Only vegans can’t, but they’re kind of crazy.”  Claire explained, confusion on her tongue.
The thought of actually getting better seemed absolutely horrrible.
“I don’t feel too great.”  Jack stated, as his stomach was churning - both awfully hungry and nauseous at the same time.  He couldn’t help but feel the impending anxiety of Dean, the moment he would walk in.
Waiting for Dean that day, it felt strange - he didn’t want to say anything, just in fear that things might end up going haywire, but he also trusted Dean.
“Isn’t it a little too cold to not wear pants?”  Cas asked, genuinely curious.  Jack just looked down, his cheeks flushed.
He stared at the food, and then at his dresser, as behind it, he had hidden his scale.  He wanted to stand on it, and just go back to bed.
Sam placed both the journal and the scale on the table, waiting for Dean to return with Jack.
He pulled one of Dean’s old baggy shirts over his torso, and a pair of Sam’s gym shorts from high school over his hips.  It all fit awkwardly, but he had yet to get his own clothes - a promise that Dean had made over a year ago.  That when it was all over, he’d take Jack to pick out his own clothes.  Jack just assumed that Dean forgot, which was fine.
Cas, the angel who’s trying to save him, the angel that is pure and innocent and doesn’t get any pop culture references so far in their conversations while looking for the next Circle. Cas, that ever since the first moment he laid eyes on Dean could only see beauty and love when all Dean himself could see was ugliness and pain.
-Yes, we do, but we can discuss this after we get you out of the sight of Alastair. Now, Dean.
-You have no power over me anymore.
-Okay, but you’re meeting me right now, shouldn’t we all be happy?
this was happening, he just knew it was different, new, delicate and
Dean did not, in fact, have a good night. He barely slept, memories of the light going out of Cas’ body behind his eyelids all of the fucking time, he stayed
“I think both, me and him disagree.” That’s the pity smile now. “Here, I think this size should be good. Try this with other clothes but make sure to compare the actual sizes, sometimes they have a different shape, it's a whole thing, just use this as your example.”
-It isn’t wrong, you know that now, don’t you? – Cas said after some time.
for all of it to stop. It was Hell, after all.
When Dean thought it was over, a bunch of memories of his life did the same thing the fights did. There was a lot of noise, and the memories started to gain form again.
BAM. Billie enters the room, and Dean knows that this is it.
-Dean, let me hide your soul, you seem to be more comfortable when I’m not seeing it.
“Thank you”
“Sam, be realistic,
-‘Cause is not true.
Now all the way out, looking around, he could see a circle of dead trees. He needed to figured out where he was, how to find Sammy and Bobby, and most of all,
“But we’re not leaving, if you’re agreeable with that.”
“I want to keep them.”
He runs to take Jack in his arms, the kid laughing lightly, making his way to put his head on Dean’s neck and his arms around his shoulders, like he’s used to do by now. Dean takes a deep breath, taking in the smell of baby that Jack has and hot tears run down his face.
“Cas, he’s not that
“Because it was me losing you, again. Because you are important and I lost you. Because I didn’t want to start a family without you and I still had to. Because I need you, Cas. I simply need you to function.”
“Yeah?”
“Whatever. Look, you don’t wanna work, that’s fine, just give me the keys and I'll go alone.”
“He wouldn’t stop moving! I told you, he’s being extra difficult today.”
but Sam didn’t look for another case. Dean’s pretty sure that one was just Sam trying to feel better, to make things better, to forget everything they lost once again. It doesn’t work, it never does, that’s one of the reasons Dean didn’t bothered to go hunt.
He wants and longs and needs to stay longer with Cas here, inside his arms, but that would be weird, right?
“See?”
is in front of him but a lifetime of being deceived still letting his gun in a firm grip pointing to the angel.
Great, now his shirt is soaked, just like his neck, but at least the crying is stopping. Looking down he can see that the diapers are wrong in all the possible ways.
“No, no kid, please don’r cry. It's just… I don’t think I was ready to hear you saying Cas’s name. I always miss him, and you two look so much alike, but you saying his name just make everything so more real, and it hurts. It just hurts too much, Jack. I’m not upset with you, and I’m not leaving, it's just… I need some time.”
I feel like important things need to be said: no, years of repression, homophobia and trauma don't go away easy. Dean's internalized homophobia is something that we as a fandom talk about, and it's SO important to talk about it. But that isn't the only thing that crosses Dean's mind when it comes to his feelings about Cas, from my point of view, so here I exploit more about Dean feeling unworth of love, especially from a divine creature like Cas.
-Cas…
“You’re welcome, sweetie.”
-Is not going to be easy, but yes.
-That’s sweet. I really am curious about this, but I have a whole plot ready, so this will have to wait. Can you do this for me, Castiel? Can you be patient? There is more than one love interest to Dean planned already, I was putting some clues about him being bisexual until I was sure that was something I wanted to go with, but now it seems more interesting than ever. Of course, him being repressed and traumatized will make the trick to make him behave like the women heartbreaker that he is. Oh, oh! I can make a male love interest for him
The Ante Inferno, the last part of Hell before they can get out.
-Yes! What about you?
-Then be my guest, keep going, Castiel.
-And how exactly are you going to put me back?
-Shut up, I’m hilarious.
It feels like little wins all day at the same time that feeling of home, of ‘this is what we should be doing all the time’ gets inside of, Dean hopes, all of them.
“I can’t believe this” Cas whispered under his breath “Dean, do
-Killing demons? In Hell? What are you on, dude?
“I love you too.”
“Oh” now that he looks at it, his hand
-Dean! – An angel blade was put in Cas’ neck.
-This is a vessel. – Dean suddenly stopped
If being in Hell wasn’t enough to give someone shivers, hearing this was.
-I don’t want to, but we should keep goin’.
“’So’, you should worry about it.”
-Then why start now?
-You didn’t notice? What did you see? It’s the most noticeable thing here.
-Didn’t they send a lot of angels just to pull me out? Why would they hurt me?
-I know, is just,
The mission was starting to get to Castiel’s mind, and body. It still fells awkward to be in a human vessel. Jimmy Novak stays quiet and dormant for most of the time, especially after Castiel told him they were going to Hell, humans can’t cope with this most of the time. On top of that, it has been a long time since the angel needed a vessel, but they figured angels entering Hell with theirs true forms would cause some talk among the demons.
“See?”
be back,
-Cas…
-Great. So what, everything I did that goes against the Bible can punch me in the face?
-What was that for?
Those Circles shouldn’t be this hard to go through, but making Dean understand what Cas was telling him was. Little pieces of his soul falling, the storm making it harder for Cas to fly since there was no floor, everything repeating over and over.
-You idolized me!
What in the hell was all of that? Open up to a stranger? He should have stayed at home. He doesn’t talk about this shit with
-Is it because I’m in a male vessel? – Cas didn’t want to think like that, but a lot of Dean’s hell was about his sexuality. How with the limited time to get out of Hell he would explain that angels don’t have a gender but when they get a vessel they use what they feel more comfortable with? He wouldn’t change that, for anyone.
because of me. BAM. “Everybody’s gonna die, Cas, everybody. I can’t stop it.” I wish I could. BAM. “She’s gonna get through that door.”
“Yeah, but hey, that’s part of the job, right?”
-Look who’s talking. You wanna ignore all the absolute crap your life was? Fine by me. Let’s make up a scenario, shall we? Let’s pretend mommy never died, just a normal family, normal life.
because of this, and to be honest, I think the punishment fits the crime! Keep doing this and you will be an abomination to a point of no return.
-Sure.
“What is my love good for?”
clothes that look at the very least uncomfortable is the proof.
Cas though, he was as surprised as someone could possibly be. He wasn’t sure to
Never taking care of what was inside of his head, just as John taught him, he never thought it would cost a price. They were memories of his father drunk, miserable, right after Mary died. John screaming that they would never have a home, or rest, not until they found what killed Mary. The first time he saw John kill someone, in front of him when he was just four years old. All the times John made him repeat that he was the one responsible to make sure Sammy was safe. How he learned how a gun worked at the age of five, how to shoot at six. All the times after that, when John was drunk and would mumble how Sam is different and that he didn’t have the killer instinct he and Dean had.
Outside from all of it, Cas could see Dean’s pain. His soul was visible the second Violence took over. He could see how hurt Dean was from all of it, how he was doing his best to fight back, but the first time Dean killed was the breaking point to a piece of his soul. Cas got closer and collect the hurt part of Dean that couldn’t take it. Still, Dean kept fighting all of the violence that was thrown at him.
-What…?
just so his Father come back and end all of it? After so long,
but I was able to make him forget the summer romance he had with the hairless ape. I also put a trigger, every time he try to remember Hell, or his feelings towards the Winchester, I’ll know and we’ll be able to convert him again.
“Fine, I’m dad material, geez, Cas. Can I go to sleep now?”
-For my Father’s sake, understand once and for all, you are
Castiel was sad Dean had to hear all of that, see all of that, but also so happy Dean seemed to finally understand he was worth and that his father’s opinions didn’t matter. That’s exactly the point of this Circle, know this and quit being so angry.
He had heard of how humans show affection, but he was never part of it. He liked it. Especially because it was with
-Dad, stop, I’m your
love me?”
“He just
Still, Castiel is one of the very best. He knows glory, he has succeeded in countless battles, and he
-Right – Dean still felt dizzy and just… amazed, but Cas was right, they should keep going, and that’s what they did.
-You can do that?
-That’s not possible.
-Who?
-I can’t do it when you’re fighting, but if it makes you more comfortable now, let me. – another feathery forehead touch and the light was gone. – We should keep going, if we wait here long enough it will start again.
