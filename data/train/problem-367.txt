"I did warn you..."
******
"The first train arrives at four fifty-three. That's not too long." Sherlock rattled off the information as if he were a British Rail employee. In fact, he had memorised the departure times before he'd left for the party.
What little free time he had, he spent with the other soldiers in his unit. He'd been fascinated to discover that the camp was usually divided along gender lines between alphas and betas. Eric had been the only beta John had established a friendly relationship with. But now he immersed himself in the alpha group, who it was fairly obvious had the say of what went on at the base.
John tasted the mint of her toothpaste and the sharp tang of her mouthwash. Nothing else. Just stale emptiness.
Sherlock wrinkled his brow and looked at John as if he'd lost his mind.
"Well, didn't you say Cilia was the one who inherited it?"
Sherlock heard water running a few moments later. He was just pouring himself some more tea when his cell phone screen lit up, and a fraction of a second later the melody of a ring tone started playing. It was Lestrade.
Sherlock had found out quickly who Tom was. An athletic youth with strawberry blond hair and loads of freckles, he was quite a bit shorter than Sherlock, but his shoulders were at least twice as broad. He obviously spent more time hitting the gym than the books. The reason might be his latent insecurity, which he tried to conceal – unsuccessfully. At least according to Sherlock. He couldn't help noticing the way the other young man constantly chewed his nails, nor his excessive nervousness when apparently stronger men passed by him. Sherlock assumed Tom had had some bad experiences with bullying at school. Which presumably had to do with his ginger hair – even though Sherlock couldn't understand rejecting someone based on a certain hair colour. Or else it was because he was gay.
.) He can’t even explain why he didn’t leave sooner. Why he didn’t pull the alarm bell earlier and do a runner when he first realised what was going on.
"You went to the Yard and played it up to him in order to get the file, didn't you? Did you flirt with him, Sherlock? Did he
"When will I see you again?" Victor asked when Sherlock stopped his car in front of the flat.
With those words, John lifted Sherlock's hand to his lips and dropped a kiss onto his knuckles.
He put his hand over Sherlock's, forcing an up-and-down motion with a slight twist that quickly brought him to the brink of his self-control. He reached for Sherlock roughly, kissing him and sucking on his lips, then tore himself away again and threw his head back when he climaxed onto his bared stomach.
As a doctor and a soldier, John had seen many – too many – people die, yet nothing had prepared him for the panic he now felt constricting his airways. The frantic restlessness that had been making him vibrate with nervous energy a moment ago vanished into thin air. What remained was a paralysing fear that nailed him to the floor in front of Harry's sick room. He didn't want to face what waited for him behind the door: the fact that alcohol poisoning could end fatally, in the worst-case scenario, or at least leave permanent damage.
Moriarty had found Greg and was now using him as a bargaining chip. What about Mrs Hudson and Victor? Had they evaded the clutches of this madman? Or had they also been abducted?
"The victims were injected with a fast-acting tranquiliser. Is the dose high enough to be fatal, in your opinion?"
"Precisely!" Sherlock stopped in front of the desk and put his hands on his hips triumphantly, but Lestrade still had no idea what the hell he was talking about.
"Did you find anything?" John inquired after a period of relaxed silence.
"Wow. That's... just wow!" Bill replied with disbelief as she came to a halt in front of the last room at the end of the hall. "I'm really happy for you, truly." She opened a dark brown wood door that complemented the hallway's dark green silk wallpaper perfectly, and indicated that John should go in.
. It's unsettling."
Victor was hard as a rock by now and more than willing to release a little of the dark energy that was buzzing just under the surface of his skin. He set his legs shoulder-width apart, slowly undid his trousers with a smirk, and pushed them far enough down his hips to free his erect cock.
Sherlock looked down at him and nodded again.
"Stay."
"Sherlock's alive. He's in a safe house outside the country, but based on what this letter says, I need to assume that information regarding his location has ended up in the wrong hands," Mycroft explained matter-of-factly without so much as batting an eyelash.
find didn't lead anywhere. It was almost as if..." Sherlock broke off and pressed his lips together so as not to let the rest of the sentence out.
"I'd hoped you could tell me." Mycroft pursed his lips pompously. Sherlock was only too familiar with that smile – if you could call it that. It was one of the diplomatic tricks his brother employed when he asked questions to which he already knew the answer.
"For me too," John agreed. "We'll keep going in a sec. You just need to turn over, darl – Sherlock. Turn over, okay?"
It was around nine o'clock when John set out for the hospital. He felt eyes on him, and a quick turn of his head confirmed that he was being observed. He already knew the journalist who was following him. The only reason he hadn't approached John yet must have been because they'd had words just a few days earlier.
He reached for his phone as if on autopilot and pressed the button for Sherlock's contact. It was answered on the third ring.
"How can you be in heat again so soon?" John murmured, bewildered. "There weren't any signs earlier this –
Sherlock bounced faster, pressing his forehead against John's and eliciting a moan from his alpha's lips. The urgency inside him suddenly kicked up a notch, pushing him harder and faster no matter whether his body was ready for a knot or not.
"What happened to Sherrinford then?" John asked, trying to pick up the thread of the conversation again.
with him?! (Bloody, manipulative bastard!)
"Seven?"
Victor relaxed visibly. "We could go to mine, I live just around the corner. That will save time."
Mike exhaled slowly as he tried to find the right words. He then came closer to Sherlock and placed one hand on his shoulder. "I remember how unhappy you were the last time you sat in my consultation room. You were devastated, even if you didn't want anyone to see that. I can imagine you must have been going through an emotional roller coaster at the time, and it must have been the same if not worse when John returned. No one can expect you to function perfectly and solve a series of homicides on top of it when you're under all that stress, especially given all the changes you were going through. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but even you are only—
"Here, this is a nice picture of him," Sherlock heard his mother saying, and leaned as close to the door as he could without touching it.
It ended up taking them nearly two hours to arrive at their destination, since the road had only been partially ploughed. It was frustrating. John was so full of nervous energy he would have loved nothing more than to get out of the vehicle and run the rest of the way, if it had made any sense to do so.
John pushed down on Sherlock's torso so that his back was resting on the wooden tabletop. Then he grasped the backs of Sherlock's knees, bent his legs up, and placed his feet onto the table. He greedily wiped his mouth and took a step back to get a good look at his omega. His splayed thighs, his stiff omega cock, his plump, round balls and his arse crack which was already glistening with promise.
was underlined several times. Victor snapped the books shut and put them back on the table.
"I love you, Sherlock. That's my reality. Anything above and beyond that is immaterial for me unless it changes something between us. And..." He paused, bit his lower lip, and sighed. "And I hope that you'll... tell me if... if anything changes for you," he said, but the last bit was almost inaudible, swallowed in a sob.
Sherlock was still avoiding John's questioning gaze. "… He escaped."
"We have nothing to talk about!" Sarah nagged one evening while jumping from the bed, slipping into her shorts.
"Then dump it," John laughed. "What's in there anyway? Old socks? Are you sure it's safe?"
with a stranger in my bed! And certainly
"Not for me! I purchased a batch of Seven from an extremely talented chemist a few years back. It was such a good blend that my alpha completely forgot about me. I would have liked to work with the creator to share my discovery and create an effective pheromone blocker for both bonded and unbonded omegas. Just think what that would mean… for
Heat and alcohol, rhythm and a sea of lights. It was a wonderful feeling. Letting go and following the rush of blood. Abigail flung her arms around Victor's neck and drew him close in a clumsy embrace.
The metallic clink of the shower curtain rings made him flinch and whirl around, but before he could process what was happening, John had climbed into the tub in front of him and turned the shower head toward himself to catch some of the water. "What the – !"
So what was the problem? He couldn't understand it himself.
"You don't say? That explains why the service is so poor," Victor retorted disparagingly.
"No! Damn it, John, what is this? Twenty questions?"
Nearly an hour passed before Mycroft had John brought in to see him again. Mycroft indicated that John should sit in the chair he'd kicked across the office before; it was back in its place as if nothing had happened. He handed John a sheet of paper across the desk. An analysis report.
"A new case, hm? From that DI?"
Sherlock glanced down at the hand, then into Victor's face. Quicksilver-blue eyes gave him a searching look. Questioning. As if expecting additional instructions; as if Sherlock didn't know the rules for this game.
"Liar."
He'd spend a few days at Harry's and think about how he wanted his life to continue. He'd never expected to be injured so seriously in combat that he'd be sent home on an invalid pension. He'd never expected to have to ask Sherlock for shelter. Good God, he'd never even expected to see the man again. And if he did, then not in his current condition, but as the powerful alpha he'd once been.
John's heart squeezed painfully in his chest.
"Nothing," Mycroft answered simply before returning his pensive gaze to the computer screen. "He said that demons from the past were waiting for me... whatever he intended that to mean..."
. Sherlock's blood and John's saliva combined in his mouth to a chemical cocktail that would seal their bond.
"Are you really sure this is what you want? You know what he's capable of..."
John thrust one more time as far as he could through the tight ring, wiggling his tongue until hot semen spurted over his hand. Whimpering, he sucked at Sherlock's arsehole and felt another load of come flow down Sherlock's glans, to his great satisfaction.
His gaze slid over to Sherlock once more, oozing slowly down his body like tar.
"It's called Seven and it makes a heat more manageable."
John followed obediently, not daring to meet any stranger's eye for more than a fraction of a second.
John had distributed the twelve letters between his two jacket pockets. He ran his thumb over the edges that were sticking out, as if to reassure himself that the envelopes were all still there. John assumed he would be brought to Mycroft's residence, but apparently even after knowing each other for over two years, the civil servant wasn't willing to reveal his homestead to John.
"Yes?" Sherlock prompted with an atypical gentleness in his voice.
Sherlock's forehead furrowed in thought; he seemed to be having an internal debate. Yet at the same time, John had the impression that his behaviour was more for show than genuine, as it only took a couple of seconds before Sherlock set his book aside and stood up.
Sherlock nods appreciatively. "She doesn’t suit you anyway," he murmurs and shovels fried noodles from another box onto his plate.
"Have you ever had to get through a heat alone before? It's not very fun!" Sherlock pointed out.
"I don't know what to do, Sherlock," John said softly, ignoring Sherlock's statement.
The cool water combatted the burning in his throat to provide a measure of relief, and calmed his gurgling stomach. After a few more sips, he sank back down onto the mattress with a sigh and closed his eyes. He was tired and wanted nothing more than to fall back asleep until he felt better and –
"That was fantastic," John whispered, already on the verge of sleep even as his fingers continued to dance across Sherlock's skin. "I missed that the past few days. It's always nicest at home."
"Cilia?" John asked gently, placing two fingers under her chin to lift it so that she would look at him. He looked into her big, brown eyes and tenderly stroked her cheek with his thumb.
"Sherlock!"
Several alphas were engaging in intercourse right there with the omega they had chosen, with orgiastic enthusiasm. Tables and cushions were being used for unintended purposes. From every direction came the rhythmic slap of skin on skin, slick sliding, sharp cries, and ecstatic moans.
"Did you go out?"
He watched as Victor took one of the notebooks and leafed through it, furrowing his brow in thought and returning repeatedly to the same page. After placing a pen between the pages, he picked up the other notebook and flipped through it too.
"Yeah, everything's fine," John said. He jerked his chin in the direction of the woman who was now being buckled onto a stretcher. "And she'll be fine in short order as well."
Thirteen weeks after the tragic deaths of Sebastian and Augustus Moran, Sherlock finally decided to seek out professional help. He'd been waiting three months for his next heat, but none of the usual symptoms had appeared. On the contrary, Sherlock felt almost exactly the way he had during the five years he'd spent living apart from John. A time in which he – as planned – hadn't undergone a single heat. It was downright ironic that it had failed to materialise now that he and John were together and happy, and he wanted to voluntarily renew his bond with his alpha.
"Not all, to be sure, but more than you might think. After all, their livelihood was secured, they had a roof over their head, a family... and they took care of each other. Most didn't marry for love, Sherlock, but love is something that can emerge with time. Something that needs to grow."
“I told my brother to mark the spot even though it's not really the purpose of
“It’s not enough. I need…” But before he could finish, John was forcefully pushing two fingers into him.
The liquid wasn’t tasty but appealing to John on an instinctual level. He just managed to think: “Pheromones!” before he pulled Sherlock’s hips in his lap.
*****
Struggling for control over his overwhelmed body Sherlock rolled to the side, effectively pulling John with him.
“Loo. Hydration. Nutrition. Understood?”John’s voice was firm but laced with worry as Sherlock stared unseeing into his face. “Come on.” The doctor said before he walked his taller patient carefully towards their bathroom.
John knelt on the wooden floor letting his head hang down and trying to breathe through the pain in his chest. He had taken the first few punches to his stomach with as much dignity as he could muster but the kick to his chest had pushed the air from his lungs and made his eyes water. Moriarty was still yelling at him but John saw no point in answering.
“Am I now? And, statistically speaking, how often do I do that around you?” John looked at him expectantly.
“Shall I keep the jacket on when we get back?” Sherlock asked teasingly while they walked down the long hallway to the automatic door that would lead them outside.
Sherlock appeared at his side silent as a cat. John held the hanger into the torch light to make him understand what had happened without having to explain it. The Consulting Detective picked up a small piece of china that lay close to his feet and threw it unceremoniously against the creature. It bounced off with a wooden sound and rolled around before it disappeared into a gap between the floor boards.
John felt his heart hammer against his ribcage as he forcefully pushed the door to the stairwell open and immediately made space for Sherlock to follow. The tall man’s handgun was held on eye level as they assessed the situation. Greg and Sean were trying to cover all other directions, standing protective behind Mycroft and Martha with their own guns drawn.
(And had never felt so good.)
Consciously, he brushed his hand against Sherlock's to convey his admiration and just a little bit of desire.
“Where is your son, Mr. Mullins?” He boomed at the slumped figure.
Sherlock had been ridiculously bad tempered for 5 long days now. Agitated, he paced up and down the living room, muttering to himself while constantly scratching his lower back. When John attempted to start a conversation, Sherlock immediately began throwing insults at him, stepping so close they were almost touching. Only a millimeter separating them in those situations. A mere millimeter that somehow accomplished to grate on John’s nerves, made his skin tingle and his fingers itch.
“Prince James’ realm!”
As it was, it only served to kindle his curiosity.
“I needed a tattoo, so I would get an appointment and with it the proof that the suspect was indeed the serial robber. I had you tattoo my thigh. You finished and I realized I rather liked your name on my skin. You went to bed and I took the equipment to my room. I still needed a tattoo to cover. So I put one on my hip. Unfortunately that weak excuse for a criminal wasn’t able to make it through more than one interrogation before confessing every thing since age 3. But now I had the tattoo. So…” He concluded in annoyance, raising his eyebrows in a here-we-are expression.
“Why don’t you cry? What is wrong with you?” He screamed down at him. Small drops of saliva were raining on Sherlocks face.
Trying to regain his composure, the shorter man pressed hard back into the mattress. He made an obvious effort to suppress his need to press/push/pound up into another gratifying contact. With heaving breath, John finally managed to open his eyes and take a look at his stunning position. Wanting more sensory proof for the realness of the situation, he raised his head and licked over the flushed neck above him. While he still relished their shared presence in this room, this bed and this world in general, Sherlock fixed him with an unreadable gaze. Questioningly, John raised an eyebrow and waited.
Nodding, Mrs. Phillips got up and shook John’s hand. “Thank you. If you couldn’t find him…” She said by a way of goodbye. Sherlock’s face twitched in annoyance at the words and John knew that the case wasn’t over at all. As soon as the door fell into its frame the Consulting Detective produced a laptop out of thin air and began typing furiously. John settled for the 3 day old London times and the last box of biscuits, instead.
“It feels rougher than I thought.” John stated intrigued while looking up into Sherlock’s eyes.
Annoyed, Lestrade got up from his chair and crossed the room towards the dark corner where John and Sherlock had taken an observing position. When he had called and told them that he needed help finding a missing child, John hadn’t expected Sherlock to actually be interested but surprisingly the Consulting Detective had merely taken his coat from the hook and said “Coming.”.
“I mean it!” Sherlock’s tentacle’s slowly pushed out of his back and stretched to the sides, filling John’s vision once again. Sherlock nodded at them, signaling John to take a closer look at them.
--------------
“I don’t know what you mean.” Sherlock said, contorting his face in pain when John pressed on the edges of the scratch.
Since Mycroft had picked them up, they had undergone drastic changes in their behaviour with huge amounts of sleep being the one they all had in common.
while he read but instead of an explanation there had been a reference to “The Bond”.
Sherlock observed the doctor’s dilated pupils and flushed face before he rested his hands on his hips. He felt John’s touch on his ribcage, the elated pulse being transferred onto his skin.
“I don't know what happened before you shot me but… I know I would never have chosen you out of the two of you.” A bitter smile appeared on his face. “Why would anybody choose a woman like you? You always tried to make me feel useless and small. Unloveable. You… You were the problem. For once, it wasn't me.”
Greg nodded, already used to them having completely mute conversations every now and then, he knew how their communication would work from that point onwards.
It made Sherlock smile none the less.
It was earth shattering.  John lay trembling on his back, seeing hearing and thinking nothing at all. His whole body tingling with the sensation of want…
Sherlock hesitated before he found a reply. “Pheromones, nothing else.”
Above him, he heard little gasps and moans that eventually grew ragged when John scratched his fingernails lightly down Sherlock’s back.
For a few seconds, nobody said anything while they collectively tried to understand what they’d just spotted.
John gave him a soft smile as the world around him dissolved yet again.
Oh God. I hope the grammar doesn't suck too much. I STILL haven't found a beta and I learn to live with it, at the moment.
“He says his name is Prince James and you would be searching for him.” Sherlock scrambled to his feet as if the bed was on fire. The crossbow fell to the floor, one arrow going off, nailing May’s skirt to the chair she had been sitting in. She shrieked, startled.
“In. Your. Dreams. Who?” Sherlock demanded.  The DI steeled his gaze, looking at him with conviction.
When a familiar dining table crashed into the street a few meters away, Sherlock turned around and resumed walking.
John, always the thorough doctor, spent the next 2 hours looking up everything that could possibly come in handy concerning gay sex. To his surprise, the concept didn’t frighten him when it was related to Sherlock. It even sounded… stimulating.
, he told himself. It would probably be best to order a beer and something to eat for the both of them so he could discreetly find out if John had ever heard of him at all. Sherlock didn’t want to think about the possibility that it was the wrong John that made him feel excited, anxious and just that little bit sanguine.
Their newest companion spared him a sympathetic glance. “They don’t want it. They know they can’t get in. They just don’t want anybody else to have it either if they don’t.” Sean said, sounding guilty.
before his mouth broke in an honest grin.
“I choose you. Not because you pressured me, not because I need your half of the rent. I choose you because I want you. I want to do this the right way. Do you still want this…me?” He held Sherlock's hands tight, looking into his eyes.
At times, John was very worried about Mrs. Hudson. Her talkative and cheerful personality had suffered from the drastic developments of the last months and had turned into a rare and always welcome occurrence. Most of her days, she spend brooding in the huge kitchen section. Between all the stainless steel, her crooked body seemed alien and out of place. It hadn't taken them long to get used to her ear-less head but her melancholic state still prove to be hard to handle. Especially for Sherlock.
“No!” Sherlock yelled, resolutely. His father’s face contorted in anger but Sebastian seemed to be unimpressed if not amused. Sherlock had to try something else than just arguing. He walked closer to the throne and knelt down at his father feet.
“I want you. Right now.” He whispered in between their kisses. John’s answer was a deep growl and a hand wandering to Sherlock’s arse, while the other one was busy trying to get rid of Sherlock’s ridiculously tight shirt. Their combined groping made that task impossible and John cursed under his breath. He pushed Sherlock a few inches away, trying to find his composure.
“I am willing to agree.” Sherlock said, smugly. “But next time, we will reverse the roles. I know what you meant to tell me with it. I understood. And you should know that I share the sentiment.”
John tried to be fast but silent. Fortunately, he didn’t wear socks or shoes. It wasn’t the first time that little habit of his came in handy. Frantically, he produced his gun kit from under his bed side table and made sure the firearm was serviceable. Stuffing the gun into the back of his trousers and adjusting his jumper so it wouldn’t show, he took a deep breath and waited for Sherlock’s call.
“John sends his regards.” He feed the last bites to Sherlock before he left as if nothing had happened.
*****
"Oh my God! Could you please stop this, Sherlock?" John demanded loudly.
Not bothering to take off his pyjama pants, John crawled onto the bed. Carefully, he placed his knees on either side of Sherlock’s hip only to lean urgently closer to try and kiss the awkwardness away. Who knew how long Sherlock would let him get away with it.
There were almost 40 people drinking and chatting in the almost tropical main room. Sherlock immediately regretted taking the heaviest coat available. He hated feeling all hot and sweaty but in this situation there was no helping it. While he walked through the room, seemingly purposeful and familiar with his surroundings, he looked for the best place to unobtrusively observe everything and be almost invisible himself.
“I don't know what you mean.” Sherlock said defensively before he sipped the tea and walked over to the couch.
Sherlock nodded in the general direction of the kettle.
“Ok.” John commented, not knowing what to make of the earlier intermission. Following Sherlock’s lead (as usual), he leaned down and pressed a teasing kiss on the tip of the detectives length.
John often caught him staring at her with a miserable expression. Aside of that and the bigger amount of sleep, Sherlock appeared to be unfazed by each and any change he and his life had undergone. John knew better though. They probably all did. But if Sherlock used his every-day behaviour as a comforting haven, John was the last to care. It was only a matter of time until the Detective would snap. Locked away as they were. That he had managed to reduce his break-outs to a minimum was no short of a miracle to John and he tried to make it up to him on every possible occasions.
“Can I see?” Sunlight was falling through the window and illuminating John’s form as he turned around.
The king was furious when he saw the state his beloved son returned in. He promised Sherlock that he would never have to go back to Prince Sebastian.
attracted. But he was actually looking forward to the pictures. Now that he has them, has seen them and looked at every single one -definitely more than once- his mouth is dry, he feels arousal surge through his guts, his heart pounding violently against his ribcage. And that text. That last bloody text from Sherlock. For half an hour, he entertained the possibility that he was only physically attracted to his genius flat mate but not at all emotionally. But then he got that text. While most people would probably have jumped up from the bed, ran down the stairs and licked every part of Sherlocks body (and yes, John briefly imagined doing just that.), he just began to giggle about Sherlock's impatience and felt a warm wave of affection rise in his chest.
“Yes, of course.”
As soon as Sherlock understood, he loosened his fingers enough to slip from John’s grasp. Chasing satisfaction in a way he had never before and at the same time rubbing against John’s leaking cock, he urgently pushed into his tight grip.
“How did you do it?” He asked while stepping closer and surveying the seven small slits on Sherlock’s back. He was sure they had been there all the time but somehow he hadn’t been able to see them.
“I said SHUT UP!” His whole body was trembling now. But Sherlock didn’t worry about it. John was already standing behind him, raising his gun.
“Please Sherlock, I need your help! It is something… medical.” He put all his worry in the last word, counting on the strong friendship that had built between them during their short time together.
John pulled his hips down, letting his softening erection slip from Sherlock’s body. A whimper of disappointment was elicited from the man above him. With his body pliant and exhausted, he still managed to use his will to move the tentacle from Sherlock’s pelvis higher up, where it slipped between the Detective’s cheeks at once.
As soon as Sherlock had closed the bathroom door, John sat down heavily in a kitchen chair. The whole situation seemed so ridiculous and absurd. He didn’t know if it was just the Alpha in him but he had definitely felt drawn to Sherlock from the moment they met. He wasn’t shallow enough to not realize that Sherlock played a huge role in his wanking fantasies those past weeks. But it wasn’t only sexual interest that pulled John closer and closer to his flatmate. If it had been, John would have gone out and found someone to get a bit of relief and distraction but since he had moved in, John hadn’t even attempted to date someone. He just didn’t need anyone else’s presence. He needed Sherlock. Always.
“It was a good one.” Sherlock said smiling to himself.
“Honestly? I think I understand most of it.”
He got out of the bed and covered his almost naked form, trying not to feel awkward.
3 months later
"I suggest we don't risk too much then." Sherlock muttered while turning to the clicking door. In his leather jacket and rough jeans he managed to be somewhat of a distraction to John who was relieved to know that Sherlock would be somewhere behind him and therefore out of sight while he had to be concentrated.
Through the Window, Sherlock watched as the men dragged John across the street, through a backyard and into a deserted house with barricaded windows and an old wooden door hanging loosely in it’s hinges. As soon as he saw them vanish inside he exited the Inn, deliberately stumbling and swaying in broad wiggly lines. With the coat collar hiding most of his face he made his way to the chubby housing. He waited silently in front of the door, listening for the voices inside. He could clearly hear Moriarty’s high pitched, manic voice through the broken front window when he began to speak.
In this case, Sherlock was the experienced one. He pushed John up as far as possible without slipping out of him and shifted his hips just a few centimeters to the left, before he thrust in again.
John bit his lower lip to keep himself from pushing in too fast. He felt himself being engulfed in tightness, every clench of Sherlock’s inner walls making it harder for him to breath. As soon as he had thought it the tentacles around Sherlock’s body fastened and he entered his lover completely. Fighting his instinct to thrust in and out, he kept his gaze fixed at Sherlock, who wore a look of astonishment as he stared right back into the doctor’s eyes.
“Just remember it next time.” Sherlock added with a shrug as he resumed playing.
Already taking a step forward, John raised his hand in a signal to move. He trusted Greg to have his back if what they found would turn out to be dangerous. What ever it was, it was small and fast. The niche under the stairs couldn't hold anything bigger than a dog but even a hungry dog could become a problem in the destroyed world it was now inhabiting.
John tried not to lose it. Not to yell at a square meter of grass in the middle of a cemetery.
The water was cool and soothing on his itchy skin. John positioned himself under the spray in a way that made the water run down his body in thick streams, caressing his back and thighs. His thoughts were spinning with confusion and anxiety. He tried to calm down, telling himself that he and Sherlock were both men. Men understood the male urge to achieve satisfaction. John had to believe that even Sherlock would have felt it at least once in his life. It would be enough to get a certain amount of absolution from his flatmate. It had to be.
When he saw the chains that were dangling from the wall, he felt regret creep through his limbs. He should have tried!
He was unable to breath, or move, or even react as everything fell into place. Suddenly, he realised why he had been shot. Why Sherlock had behaved so strangely out of character.
“John, I can’t stop. If I stop it feels like… I tried but it… it hurts. I need you. Please, help me!” The Omega looked pleading into his eyes. John grabbed his wrist and pulled the hand away from Sherlock’s cock.
He couldn’t think. The only thing on his mind was to follow his baser instinct to claim/mate/fuse.
“Fuck, I almost punched him for looking at you.” He said when he walked to the couch and sat down beside Sherlock. Sherlock, who looked kind of happy and just a little bit flattered.
A knock on the door shook him out of his reverie and made Maddi yelp in surprise.
“That’s what you said when I touched your knee. When I told you
“I want it that way. Now hurry!” John’s voice was hoarse but he still managed to sound demanding.
In Afghanistan, he gradually developed a feeling of self-worth and control and when it ended, it seemed as if some kind of deity had kicked John back into the preposterous, average existence he so loathed.
“Such a shame. I’ve been collecting earrings half my life and now they are of no use anym…” Sherlock tuned her out as he leveled his attention back at the box. It was heavy. 18 to 20 pounds, he estimated. The box was made of cardboard and hadn’t been bound in any way.
“Where is Mrs. Hudson?” John asked, suddenly worried.
He sneaked out into the hallway and crept down to the staff quarters. In two minutes the guard would be back from his (definitely forbidden) break. At least he was reliable in his bad habits.
“Good.” John said but didn’t ease his grip on Sherlock’s arm. Instead he leaned down and pressed an insistent kiss on Sherlock’s rosy lips. “Good.” He repeated, finally letting go. Straightening up, he noticed that Sherlock’s eyes were closed. When they opened again, they were looking right into his and an expression of pure wonder was written all over Sherlock’s features.
“Shut up and sleep.” He muttered hiding his smile against Sherlock's chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock! Please, let me put the groceries away.” John wriggled free from the assault and fled into the kitchen with Sherlock on his heels.
There were certain things so desperately unspoken in 221b that it made John stop in his tracks, even in a situation as serious for the world as it was right now, to hear Sherlock acknowledge what they both knew all along.
And, without preamble, soft lips pressed against John's.
The Thing on the Doorstep
Minutes went by. The birds around him were busy collecting dry leaves and small twigs. A single ant was passing right in front of John's feet, shielded by the grass as it moved in a gentle breeze.
“Oh, what now?” Theatrically, Moriarty stomped his foot like a stubborn child and nodded for the man to John’s right to go and end the noise.
“Haven't you slept well?” He asked with a worried expression.
John let his head fall back and threw one arm over his eyes, the image of Sherlock preparing himself on one of his tentacles while sucking his cock probably burned into his retinas until the last syllable of time. His other hand found thick dark curls to hang on to. With every passing second, it got harder and harder for John to keep his hips still. He wanted to bury himself inside Sherlock’s mouth and come down his throat right this instant but he also wanted to hold on to this. This right there. With Sherlock as open and loving as John had ever seen him.
“Shit!”
“Yes, love.” John managed to answer through his harsh panting. Pulling all the way out until only the tip of his cock was left inside his Bonded, John took a deep breath. Closing his eyes to concentrate on his sense of touch, he pushed roughly back in, forcing his knot through the rigid ring of muscles.
“Had to call Lestrade.” Sherlock stated briefly. If his theory was correct and having made certain that the DI was alright, there was only one person this limb could belong to.
. She didn’t seem to mind his assassination attempts and he admittedly didn’t try very hard. All he wanted was to make her screech again. But it had only worked once, when he had accidentally set her hair on fire while experimenting on a very interesting powder from china.
“I don’t know what happened to Howard but this…” She moved her hand in an all encompassing gesture indicating the world outside their window. “…this isn’t his fault.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes at her, dissecting every expression that passed her face. John had the sinking feeling that he knew where this was going. Sherlock leant forward and, resting his arms on his thighs, raised his brows at her.
“The world is shaking!” John could feel a deep embarrassed blush spreading over his whole face at the sheer corniness of the statement.
John thought about that when the man turned mid-flight and questioningly pointed into the crater. Nodding, he wondered if they'd ever make it further than 50 meters without encountering a more or less dangerous monster. They needed a better equipment. And an army would be good as well.
After several seconds, he felt long fingers brush against his hand. “I'd rather show you.”
As he entered the parlour, John almost ran into a cup of tea. Surprised, Sherlock balanced the hot liquid without spilling more than a drop or two.
“Can I join you?” He sounds much more casual than he thought himself able. Good.
The sound managed to draw even the two
---------
Apparently, Mycroft had sent them a car for the occasion so John was pretty confident that the older Holmes had also been the one arranging the funeral.
A small whine escaped Sherlock’s throat. His body was tense with the effort to keep still. John tried to soothe him by letting his hands wander over his chest and arms, stopping only to squeeze one nipple at a time, which forced a reaction out of Sherlock that John immediately filed away for further exploration. He leaned down to kiss him tenderly before he brought his lips to Sherlock’s ear.
“I didn't know how. And I wasn't sure you hadn't changed your mind.” Sherlock admitted into the air between them. With their foreheads leaning against each other and their knees touching, John still didn't feel close enough.
Sherlock was sitting in the quiet living room. Staring off into the distance he didn’t acknowledge John as he entered the living room. While the doctor fought to keep his embarrassment to a minimum, he noticed that the flat had become a disaster. Sherlock’s chaos had overtaken most of the kitchen and actually all of the living room.
The pained yell that he elicited from the man’s throat made the crowd behind him wince in unison. He was pulling the dark hair towards him, looking right in the perpetrator’s face.
Sherlock stared angrily at the floor of his hotel room clutching his hair painfully tight in his right fist. He was sitting on an awfully modern leather sofa that was neither comfortable nor cheap. It made Sherlock even angrier. His gaze was still locked on the little pieces of bone that had covered the floor after throwing an annoying, if not hateful skull against the wall.
“There is. At the moment you are mine, you said it yourself.” John tried.
“I am not hungry but we could order in if you want something.” He proposed calmly.
Taking his hand, John led him out into the living room and to the couch, pushing him down into a lying position.
“Decidedly.” Sherlock sighed.
“How likely was it for you to meet an Alpha.”
“Close!” Sherlock warned, moaning impressively loud.
“Downstairs.” Was the only thing John understood when the Consulting Detective closed the door and left.
Looking at the raised shoulders and crossed arms that were effectively covering John’s groin, Sherlock took a deep breath.
“John. I told you to… Did you eat on the way here?” Sherlock said with now wide eyes.
Unsure what to do, John remained standing right where he was and looked questioningly at Sherlock. If he’d expected to get his explanation that easy he was obviously wrong for the Detective just sat down in his chair, calmly staring back at him.
Insecurity flashed over John’s face.
He found the best spot already occupied by an unassuming middle-aged man in worn clothes who was sitting at a table for two in the right corner. Without hesitation he strode forwards and took hold of the remaining chair. Remembering that some might consider it rude to just sit down he looked into the irritated face on the other side of the table before he said: “May I.” It wasn’t a question.
John’s rhythm faltered, his thrusts turning erratic but growing in force. Sherlock felt heat pool low in his body as John grabbed his hands hard and tensed beneath him.
The climb was exhausting and midway it began to drizzle what made every step even more difficult than the loose earth beneath their feet alone. Greg fought to catch his breath when he suddenly ran into Sherlock. He had been the first one to reach the top edge of the crater they had found themselves in and had stopped in his tracks as if he had forgotten about the others behind him. "So much for stick to the plan." John muttered, pushing past them.
“Fine.” Sherlock managed to say almost as casual as he had intended to.
wanted a massage but the fact that he suddenly felt exhilarated at the prospect of Sherlock doing it…
Sherlock was just trying to keep his head out of it. And it was easier than he’d expected. Especially after John pulled one of his hands from his body and, entwining their fingers, pushed it into the mattress beside Sherlock’s head. A romantic gesture that was both unnecessary and appreciated. Sherlock didn’t do this with just anyone because he only trusted John to know and care for what it meant to him. He had gotten
Sherlock’s experience was limited but he was pretty sure that John was enjoying himself.
His plan was simple. He went over to her, seemingly nervous and fidgeting with his coffee. She looked up at him questioningly before she indicated with a short nod that he was invited to sit at her table. He knew what to do. He would tell her about his flat mate. What had happened the other night and why. (Sherlock would tell her that they had been robbed in a dark alley.  He’d leave out that consulting detective bit. Too risky.) Furthermore, he’d say that he was straight but strongly attached to his flat mate. He’d call himself John.
“Stop talking!” Sherlock's voice didn't carry the demanding note he clearly wanted it to. He pressed hard down against John, rounding his back to guide John's cock where he wanted it. John's movements turned more hurried and grew in force. His eyes now watching the tentacles as they began to quiver.
“Oh.” There was always something.
Sherlock moved quickly to his right side before Greg started to cross the distance in a zigzag pattern and came to a halt at the other side of the entrance. They had no choice but to take a look if they didn't want their short visit to be a complete waste of time. With a decisive nod John pushed himself up the wall before he pulled the gun from the back of his jeans and took a careful step into the doorway.
“There is no difference in the way I feel
“You mean, you wouldn’t have to talk to yourself for two days in a row.” His counterpart corrected calmly.
“Oh, John. Stop thinking. I know exactly what to do to make this pleasurable for both of us!” His breath tingles John’s ear with every word, causing goose bumps on his neck.
“I know.”
“You convinced me that acting happy and normal was the same thing as being happy and normal. That it doesn't matter who I am.”
The lanky man took one controlled step forward, letting the bag with their food drop unceremoniously on the table. Another second or two passed before John had to fight his defense instincts when Sherlock almost jumped him in one sudden explosion of movement.
He whirled around, ready to shoot whatever threat.
3 days into Sherlock’s heat, the former urgency was slowly receding and the bond was influencing their sex in new, thrilling ways. For one, John didn’t need to see Sherlock’s face anymore to know exactly what Sherlock wanted him to do next.
The movement around his sensitive length made John blissfully aware of the trust that existed so natural between them by now. If it was during one of their adventures or in an intimate situation like this, there was no doubt about the deep connection they shared. How far they'd come.
Sherlock looked back at him with unmasked desire and when their eyes met everything fell into place.
“Let’s eat, first. I think we have to talk about some things.” John started scattering the food on both their plates, looking utterly calm. Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to eat but he didn’t know what else to do and poked around in his curry chicken, stirring it under the rice he usually enjoyed. That John was watching him was the only reason to take a fork full every now and then. Apparently, John was satisfied with the amount of food Sherlock had consumed after ten minutes and put down his silverware, taking a deep breath. Sherlock mirrored him and waited for the inevitable.
H.P. Lovecraft,
“Have you ever considered getting pregnant just to ensure that we don’t?”
John stares at his phone. It was Mike's idea to make that thing with the pictures, just to see if John would find these features attractive if they weren’t in that intimidating package of Sherlock-ness. If he had been honest with himself, which he quite seldom was when it came to Sherlock,  he sure as hell
Pushing his head back into the pillow, John groaned when he felt his climax approach. He was working his cock furiously, imagining plush lips on his skin and long dexterous fingers caressing the inside of his thighs. With one final down stroke, he gripped the root of his cock as firm as possible and came, moaning loudly with his forceful relief. He felt his semen splatter on his chest and belly, his torso bow-taught by the strongest orgasm of his life.
Awkwardly, Sherlock fidgeted in the door way, glancing at a sheet of paper in his hands.
“As you wish.” The blogger muttered and, taking a torch from underneath the sink, made his way through the parlour.
After waiting for any sign of movement behind Sherlock’s closed door, John decided to place the list on the living room floor in front of the Omega’s room and go upstairs. It was already late at night and though John didn’t expect to find any sleep soon, he would just lie down and think about what he’d just read.
“Nothing. We didn’t find him, did we?” Sherlock said standing up. He buttoned his jacket and walked over to the door, prompting their client to leave. John smiled to himself thinking how very close together empathy and rudeness occurred in Sherlock’s behavior.
Sherlock was standing under the spray, one hand around his considerable erection, the other moving behind his back. John couldn’t see what Sherlock did but he was able to very well imagine it.
On her 20
“That’s…rare, John. Very, very rare. I should have known. I felt so…” Sherlock trailed off before John could understand what he meant to say. “Not important, right now. I have a book about this. People like…you.” While he spoke, Sherlock’s gaze was fixed determinately on John’s face but it seemed to be quite difficult for him. John suspected that he wasn’t as unaffected as he tried to appear when he saw the outline of Sherlock’s engorged prick pressed against the inside of his tight, black trousers.
“Well what?” The consulting detective felt strangely out of his depth.
“Just do it, John.” He said reassuringly.
When John came out of the bathroom, Sherlock entered the flat. Having left without a coat, the detective must have been freezing outside but his face was flushed and there was a slight sheen of perspiration on his skin.
“Greg. Come in. How can we help you?” John asked, gesticulating for Lestrade to take a seat.
*****
Without a word, John got up and headed for his quarters.
“John?” He sighed as he pressed against the inviting arse.
Sherlock’s arousal began to press insistently into the space between his thighs and pelvis and John could already hear him panting loudly above him. He was sure this would never lose it’s novelty. Just when he felt the need to press up harder and a bit faster Sherlock froze above him. Surprised eyes looked down into his.
But he knew what Sherlock wanted and this want flooded him through their shared bond in a way that soon made him forget whose need was more urgent. He steered the spine tentacle outwards and made sure that it dragged excruciatingly slow down between Sherlock's cheeks and over his entrance. It was slick. It always was right after leaving his lover's back.
After he had put the groceries away, John went to the bathroom and knocked. Sherlock had been in there for half an hour. Long enough to worry.
“JOHN!” Sherlock yelled, shaking John from his apparent fixation and earning a look of surprise.
Well, that's it. The 3000 word One Shot I had planned. Hope you liked it. It's still unbetaed as hell.
John isn’t happy. Sherlock can see as much. Still, they gaze at each other with a smile gracing their faces. They are holding hands and nuzzling against each other. It’s distracting and more than a bit annoying. John drifts off for a few seconds but she is already there to pull him back to reality. She grins and kisses him. Time to leave. Sherlock can’t stand it, it’s too…something. He makes it to his room before he thinks
“Here.” Kitchen. The crime scene. Well then.
“Oh God, Sherlock!” John looked down at his new lover. Sherlock looked debauched and was probably the most erotic sight in his life. Unselfconsciously basking in his pleasure, virgin was the last word that seemed to apply to him. John positioned himself between Sherlock’s legs, coating his fingers with a generous amount of lube. He began rubbing his thumb against Sherlock’s entrance in soft small circles to loosen the rigid muscle. Sherlock moaned even louder, growling impatiently after a few minutes. Carefully, John inserted his index finger in tiny thrusting motions. Sherlock started writhing beneath him and pushing against his finger which John took as a hint to add another digit.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and interrupted him, adding: “And you are mine.”.
“It’s not as if I could risk being wrong in this case.” He said dryly.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Sherlock said, trying to evade an answer.
Some of you might miss an explanation for what John and the others did in Regent's Park and I considered writing one but frankly: Our friends don't know either and I personally prefer some magic in my life. Not everything should be explained and analysed in depth, in my opinion.
Hamlet. He should have thought of that! What he didn’t expect was the end of the sentence. Well, he expected that there was more because of the way it trailed off, but he really didn’t expect
Crawling back on the bed and keeping his eyes intensely focused on Sherlock’s, John feels self consciousness expand below his skin. In this moment, he is a virgin all over again. Suddenly, it’s hard to breath and his throat is constricting painfully.
The surrounding world fell silent while Sherlock concentrated on making an educated guess.
“John?” There was irritation and something else. (That John was clearly mistaking for arousal, because of the sudden hoarseness of Sherlock’s voice.)
Because decent human beings would be interested in the grave of their wife.
“I know.” Even in the quiet of their parlour, Sherlock’s voice was almost inaudible.
John narrowed his eyes at that. He’d just returned from a walk to train his weakened legs and was not in the mood for polite lies. “Does it? And what are we doing instead?”
“I wanted to bond with you from the moment I knew that it was possible.” Sherlock whispered, his breath tickling the blonde hair on John’s belly.
Sherlock looked disgruntled at the half empty plate on John’s side of the table. “I didn’t know you. And it is really not my area. This right here just serves to prove that.” He narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. “What would have been the right thing to say?”
“If you had told me right away this wouldn’t have to hurt.” The disinfectant made Sherlock hiss in pain before he sat up to take a closer look himself. A surprised expression crossed his face that was quickly replaced by a faint display of interest.
Calming down, Sherlock sat on his bed and contemplated the possible outcome of their situation. Of course, there were several but only one he hoped for and one he was horribly afraid of. It was unusual how hard it was to chose the next course of action. He couldn’t discern between a logical result of a hypothetical act or plain wishful thinking. The only thing he could do was to wait for John to present new data.
Beneath him, John squirmed trying to keep from thrusting up. Agonizingly slow, Sherlock began to suck and move his head in long rhythmic motions. The tiny counter movements of John’s hips making it easy to adjust the tempo.
Sherlock watched John as he stepped through the door of 221 b and followed soon after. When he entered the living room, John was rummaging in the kitchen, apparently searching for a snack. Sherlock was well aware that he wouldn’t find one and prepared himself for frustrated muttering but when John gave up and turned around, his face was relaxed and he was smiling. Sherlock had left the house in his coat that morning and, though he would never admit it, he felt awfully warm and wanted nothing more than to take a shower. John sat at the kitchen table staring at a point on the wall, still smiling, when Sherlock threw the coat in his armchair and walked into the bathroom.
“Who, what?” Lestrade said irritated by the apparent change of topic.
flat.
After less than five minutes of walking down the desolated streets of London, the earth shook beneath their feet as a loud uproar from behind threatened to deafen them. Turning around in horror, they watched an almost black cloud of brickwork, dust and earth explode from the ground.
“Go!” John’s face contorted in frustration.
“Are you sure that that there is a difference?” John asked with a smirk.
“There is no sound, taste or voice that doesn’t remind me of you. Everything lost its value the day I lost you. Sentiment, I know. God, I am just so angry. And it makes it worse that I can't hate you. I wish I could. Oh, how I wish I could hate you. Maybe I could move on then. Maybe I could start a new life somewhere else. But I'm just sitting there. Every day. I'm staring at your violin for hours, imagining you’d come and play for me. Imagination grew very important to me in the last month, I daresay. I can’t even count how often I've pictured you returning. I can almost hear you chuckle at that. Amusing! I remember your laugh but not my own. I don't think that's a problem, I won’t need it again. Just another thing I have lost.” He was clearing his throat to find the bravery to proceed.
“I don’t….I can’t! The man’s voice was small and pleading.
"How can you expect me to sit down when the real world is so close to allowing us in again?" John was amazed at the phrasing of that sentence. Had it been like that? While John had felt imprisoned all the time, Sherlock felt barred from the real world?
“Oh, just shut up! Or better still, tell me where you thought you could go with your loot. No one in this kingdom would mistake this jewelry for anyone else’s than my mother’s!” The only answer he got was more screaming. Rolling his eyes, he pressed his knee in the thief’s spine.
Even nodding was difficult as he picked up the box and walked out.
Rolling his eyes, John jumped up from the couch to follow Sherlock.
“Mary?”
He was right. Sherlock had been hiding. But that wasn’t the only reason he had stayed for two consecutive days. Fortunately, he didn’t have to explain his reasons. John knew what he knew.
“Did I do that to you? You said I did it to Mrs. Phillips.” He inquired, letting his other hand rest on Sherlock’s hip. He tried to pry beneath the closed cuts but didn’t want to just press his finger inside of them.
“I was planning to let you fuck my mouth. The feeling of your cock hitting the roof of my mouth would be excellent. I imagine, it would be hard to breath and I might choke a bit while I try to swallow around it. Would you want…” John pushes his groin hard against Sherlocks moving lips and the rest of Sherlock’s sentence gets cut off. John is on edge, the first signs of his orgasm are already pooling along his spine.
“I am in my bedroom, calling you to come to me. Deduce it!” John yelled with a hint of amusement in his voice. Sherlock only heard how husky it sounded. He was up from the couch and on the stairs in less than two seconds. He ran up only to stop, as if dumbstruck, in the doorway to John’s room. The sight that greeted Sherlock made him swallow around the sudden lump in his throat.
Stuffing the gun into the back of his trousers and adjusting his jumper so it wouldn’t show, he took a deep breath and waited for Sherlock’s call.
“Good?”
Slowly, James raised the feather to his left flank.
“I didn’t just decide, Mr. Holmes. You did it! You brought this upon us. You went to Japan and awoke them!” She accused him, her voice breaking on the sheer intensity of her hatred.
“Can we, maybe, talk later. Apparently, you scared everything away with your bloody outburst but I’d rather not linger.” The few things that had been hidden in the shadows of broken furniture and columns had been fast to move away. The sudden activity scaring Greg more than the realisation that they had been present the whole time. Eventually, the same almost gliding motions that had carried them away in the blink of an eye might bring them back, too.
*****
Shaking his head, he tried to suppress the hope that was blooming deep inside of him. It was very unlikely that he had already found the John he had been searching for even though he very much wanted him to be the same one that had sent someone to help him escape. It was unlikely but not impossible. Gradually, Sherlock felt his heart rate getting back to normal.
“I am glad how things turned out.” He whispered confidentially. “I am so fucking glad that it's just us, again.”
No way to answer that genuinely. Or at all, actually. Sherlock couldn’t quite put a finger on the reason for his extreme caution. One moment he wanted to start a string of deductions, the next he found himself unable to speak, worried about the possibility that the murderer would feel insulted and therefore punish them all. Instead he had kept quiet, what in the end had made the murderer much angrier than any insult could ever have done. Sherlock just stood there, frozen to the spot while the accomplices took position behind John and Lestrade. When he heard the safeties on their guns being unlocked the words just started spluttering out of him. Fortunately, he managed to talk as long as Lestrade’s fortification needed to storm the apartment. Meeting their perpetrator while breaking in was his plan all along, not that he would tell John, but getting himself and the others killed not that much. And what was worse was the fact that he suspected somebody else entirely. That had never happened before. He actually had believed that the husband was innocent, how he fell for that was beyond his understanding. In retrospect, all the obvious signs were there he just hadn’t managed to string them together in the right order. Well, mafia bosses
“Yorick speaks of you, you know? You always argued about his name but that is none of your concern anymore, is it? How else would you name a skull? And he is quite smart. He is right about so many things. I understand why you talked to him so often. He is the reason that I am talking to you now. There was one thing he said… and I…I had to agree with him.” He knew that it would be hard and he didn’t want to hurt Sherlock but he had to say it. He had to say it out loud.
John withdrew the gun and looked at it, contemplating what had just happened. He could clearly see it and he was sure seconds ago he wouldn’t have seen anything at all but would have been able to feel its weight in his hand at the same time. He put it on the mantel piece, letting his hand rest on it while collecting his thoughts. It wasn’t even midday and John was already feed up with that day as a whole. His stomach was growling, his head spinning and the urge to kick Sherlock was almost surreal in its intensity. He wasn’t sure how much of it was conveyed to his flat mate but it was obviously enough to have him shifting uncomfortably in his seat now.
“I think you actually did him a favor. From what I’ve gathered the mutations range from minor changes, like in Mrs. Hudson’s case, to people actually mutating into a heap of moving flesh. I even heard of cases of levitation. But I doubt it.”
Still thinking about the last note, he suddenly recognized a book peeking out of the row on his bookshelf. He took a careful step in its direction. His pulse was racing. He had never seen that book before. He took it from the shelf turning it over in his hand again and again. It was a brand new copy of Twelfth Night by Shakespeare. Relief washed over John when he opened the book to find a white slip of paper between the first pages.
“So it was you?” She said, her eyes wide and almost manic as she turned facing John. “You brought this with you. You started this!” She hissed stepping closer. “End it!”
“At night, when the objective world has slunk back into its cavern and left dreamers to their own, there come inspirations and capabilities impossible at any less magical and quiet hour. No one knows whether or not he is a writer unless he has tried writing at night.”
Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn - Yes! Yes! Cthulhu dreams.
“Yes, of course. No question there. But it was you who excluded me. How many times did you run off into danger leaving me to worry or even oblivious to what you were doing?” John stared at his own hands that were lying unmoving on his thighs.
behind him. He turned around to see John laying on the dirty cobblestone, a man standing over him. Sherlock’s heart sped up when he saw the gun that was pointed at John’s limp body.
Sherlock’s agitation was palpable as he motioned for Greg to go on packing for John.
(See the end of the chapter for
he was unable to get in a bad mood. He was too busy reveling in the feelings towards one mad consulting detective. Strangely, he wasn’t afraid or anxious; he only felt relief, having finally found out what it was that always drew him back to 221 b even after the worst fight.
“Me too.” Sherlock commented a second later.
Having dressed in a pair of boxers and a white shirt he walked down the stairs when he heard the doorbell ring. He ignored it, knowing all too well that their landlady was more than happy to answer the door but as soon as John heard Lestrade’s voice being carried up the stairs his attention was piqued. In a hurry he collected his trousers from the floor of Sherlock’s room and put them on.
“Sean. My name is Sean.” The man pressed out. Only now, Greg noticed the claws at the man's feed. The left clearly broken and almost torn off but he was more worried about the unharmed one and if he wasn't imagining things then what was partly visible above his shoulders were wings. Bleeding huge dark brown wings. One look at Mycroft's unusually obvious amazement told him that he wasn't imagining anything.
Kneeling in ankle-deep water, he pressed his head hard between his hands and concentrated on the periodic table. The decomposition degree of human skin. The complexity of Dvorak’s work. The solar system. John.
Yet, while he was telling himself:
“But probably not.” He added, looking serious for a few seconds before he started to laugh again.
John was at a total loss of words, gripping the Omega’s hips under his hands.
“It’s not logical. It’s… When I was ill and you took care of me, I saw things. I saw a man with us in the room when you…petted my head…” Sherlock stared down at the floor between them before gathering his thoughts and looking back up, noticing the unimpressed expression on John’s face.
“No, I couldn’t have.” Sherlock states dryly and rolls onto his side to face John. He puts his hand on the doctor’s chest, feeling the strong heartbeat under his palm.

“I just wanted to say it could have been worse. His change isn’t obvious and could even be helpful for his work.”
“Had something to cover.” Came the short reply.
, they had taken the next case that Lestrade offered them.
“Just think about it, Sherlock. As long as you are still able to think, that is.”
“John.” Sherlock sighed into his ears, upping the pace.
He had been holding it together. Mostly.
“It’s disgusting. Please, John, do me a favor and get rid of it, would you?“ Mrs. Hudson asked with her pleading “I-Am-Only-An-Old-Lady”- face that often made him do things she would have had no problem doing herself. Nodding, he closed the box and picked it up.
that was barely visible above the consulting detective’s waistband. With a short nod he prompted him to go on.
Greg had grabbed Sean's right elbow but without Sherlock holding the man by the shoulder's he would have had a hard time supporting the mutants heavy body. John hit him painfully pushing into the small gap to help them place the body on the stretcher. “Oh no! Oh....No!” Mrs. Hudson shrieked behind them.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the evening he visited him again, telling him painful lies about his family. He claimed that the king didn’t love Sherlock, that he just wanted to get rid of him. He made up stories about affairs both his parents were having behind each other’s backs. And when he noticed that the lies didn’t work he started to insult Sherlock, calling him ugly, dumb and pathetic. With every word he said, Prince Sebastian grew more and more agitated but Sherlock only laughed at him. It wasn’t an amused laugh, though. It was provoking and arrogant and Sherlock enjoyed every minute of it. Eventually, Prince Sebastian gave up and left and although Sherlock knew that he had won this time, he felt exhausted and a little bit homesick. He lay on the bed, hugging himself tightly while he fought back his emotions until he fell asleep, at last.
“Ok…” He nodded to himself. “Why do you like this one?” Carefully, he put his hand on the marked skin.
Sherlock considered the question. Both of them had issues with intimacy. Big, obvious issues. And even though they were close from the very beginning this was something else entirely.
And try he did.
“It worked. It worked on me.” Sherlock said astonished.
but drew a blank apart from
“John!”
“I…I am very grateful for your help. How much….?”
“Bloody hell, Sherlock! You're my friend. If you know what’s wrong you should tell me. You with your giant brain!” John spits the last words out with disgust and turns a deadly glare at Sherlock.
“Yes, Captain Watson, Sir.” Sherlock answered, his smug voice implying that he'd already decided that they were on different missions, then.
“Done?” John asked when Sherlock had managed to fight the urge to vomit.
John’s pace quickened and with it, his respiration. All of a sudden, John stopped dead. His eyes shot open. In shock, he looked down at his rapidly deflating erection. His thumb was resting on a small unevenness right at the root of his penis. John could clearly see and feel it. His heart was thumping wildly in his chest and his brain was working frantically. The bump was clearly getting smaller while his erection died down. John’s hand fell to his side, resting on the blanket unmoving. John stared blankly, searching his brain for some medical explanation. He found none.
His pick was excellent. The woman (Beth) was more than eager to help him.
, grinned at him.
They had crossed two thirds of the distance when the earth started to quiver beneath their feet. At first, John thought he might have lost his footing on the rough stones and kept on running. He barely managed to let himself fall backwards when he saw the earth below the two men give way. Sherlock kicked him painfully in the kidneys having been to close to stop before he ran into him.
John’s knot was pressing against the walls of Sherlock’s entrance, bearing down on his prostate insistently. When he felt the Alpha’s teeth breach his skin, Sherlock had barely touched his cock but his climax hit him severely. He threw his head to the side, giving John space to claim him.
*****
“I think you are forgetting that I can’t know if you don’t. Oh, come on. Don’t look at me like that!” John got up and crossed the distance between them in three steps. Kneeling down, he put one hand on Sherlock’s knee and looked into the Consulting Detective’s frustrated face.
“Sherly, just give in. We both know how this is going to end!”
“Oh,  O.K.! That’s… good.” John licked his lips again, obviously unsure what to say next. He slowly started to retreat backwards when Sherlock spoke up next.
John rolled to the right, stopping Sherlock's legs from pressing uncomfortably into his back while he saw the men vanish into the gaping hole. The light of the lantern-thing was withdrawing fast into the darkness when he cautiously crawled forward to the descend.
The Yard was as crowded as ever.  People hurried from one office to another while browsing through a stack of paper. Others just watching the fuzz from a comfortable distance. Sherlock and John were probably more familiar with the office than some of the newbies that were so very easy to detect. Panic in their eyes, sweat on their brows and always a coffee in hand that they certainly never drank themselves but had to bring some superior.
Reluctantly, John took a step back and quickly slipped his dressing gown off to hang it loosely over the taller man’s shoulders.
"Change of plans." He whispered when Sherlock and Greg had reached his position. "Sherlock will be in the middle. Greg, you will look out for hand signs of him. I don't want to make too much noise as long as we don't know what's in there."
*****
“Ah. Sherlock has told you, hasn’t he?” He asked untroubled.
“Ok. Good. That was the second one. They are not a good sign, I take it?”
Deliberately, Sherlock got up and began to undress without breaking eye contact for even a second. His controlled efficient movements were harshly interrupted as John let his left hand glide through the coarse blonde hair on his stomach and drew nearer to his hardening cock.
With a start, the agitated woman got up from the chair and turned towards him. “You are monsters, just like me! Is it true what he said? Did you do that to me?”
One hand on John's chest, Sherlock began to move. Slowly at first, he soon found a comfortable and languid pace.
Carefully and almost without any pressure, Sherlock spread the liquid over his shoulder blades and lower back.
Pressing up and against Sherlock's hard arousal, John felt his cock resting heavily against his pubic bone.
. At least it gave the exact source so he could re-read it in one of his own books. Just to be sure.
“Good that you seek help so soon. Most men don’t.” Rosen took a deep breath before he spoke on. “Well, Dr. Watson, as you might have suspected, I need to see the bulge and, as you said, I might not be able to recognize it while your penis is flaccid. My plan is to look at it in both states.”
“Oh, John, you were fantastic back there. When we get home I want you inside of me. And it’d better be deep and hard.” He growled into John’s ear, his voice a low rumble, while he pressed his right hand against the growing bulge between John’s thighs. A loud moan was erupting from the doctor’s throat.
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me. You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.
He ran the last few meters to Bakerstreet.
As soon as he sat down at the laptop, he heard Sherlock's door close.
“What do you
“Look at me, John!” The doctor drags his gaze away from the point of their connection, noticing the precome that is dripping from Sherlocks neglected arousal. Their eyes meet and Sherlock sinks down on John’s cock. Agonizingly slow, but definitely enough to let John feel the hot tightness that continues to pull him in.
John was still trying to process this new piece of information and the images it brought along when he curled his fingers downwards.
It was the last thing he noticed before he came hard all over his hand.
“Do it now.” Was the mumbled reply.
He hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock's black briefs, stroked the bulge with his thumbs, and slowly pulled the material down past the milky white skin. He encircled Sherlock's erection reverently, tracing it with his fingertips and feeling its familiar shape. Sherlock's breath caught. His hands rested on John's shoulders, holding him gently at his nape and reaching up into his blond hair.
"Not bad... not bad at all. Now let me..."
It was all too much... too much...
Sherlock smirked and stood up to go over to the desk. He opened his laptop and started up the browser. It didn't take long for him to find what he was looking for, and he clicked on the button for another express delivery. Feeling quite pleased with himself, he snapped his laptop shut again and steepled his fingers under his chin.
"Offspring. Is that the problem?" Sherlock asked. He pulled his shirt back up over his shoulders, although he didn't button it back up.
But this situation was completely different. For one thing, he had no idea when he might overstep one of Bill's limits. For that reason, he proceeded with caution as he started to touch those intimate parts of Cilia which Bill couldn't reach from her angle. He gently stroked her outer, then inner folds, wandering downward where he was pleased to find traces of moisture now.
"You always are..." she replied with a vaguely doleful note. She apparently still held it against him that he hadn't returned to her and Mycroft's care after his hospital stay, choosing instead to live free of the social strictures of a bond – at least for a couple of months.
"…fairy tales…" Sherlock whispered, his head lowered.
"It's fine... Just don't, all right?" Sherlock grumbled and looked back down at the erection in his hand. His salivary glands immediately kicked in, and he had to swallow. "It's not all going to fit in my mouth; no way."
******
Sherlock jerked back suddenly when the plump head bumped into the back of his throat, causing tears to leap to his eyes. His gag reflex kicked in, and he shot an indignant look up at John; but the ashamed expression he found there, together with the desperation and almost palpable hunger in his eyes immediately quelled his rising pique.
"We don't see each other," Sherlock cut in. "By mutual agreement."
Sherlock lifted his head a bit and inhaled. "I believe your mother has already taken the initiative on that. I smell pancakes!"
John went over to the omegas with everyone else, as if on auto-pilot, making a beeline for a young man with pale eyes who watched him shyly. He was slender, almost gazelle-like. His dark hair was cut close to his head, emphasising his fine facial features. And even though his skin was darker and nothing about his attitude hinted at any amount of self-confidence, John was almost painfully reminded of Sherlock.
"No, some recent spy movie, no idea what. Just leave it on, but don't tell me the end," John says and smiles as Sherlock rolls his eyes theatrically. "How are the samosa?"
A low growl escaped his throat when he saw the naked man in the mirror. His split lip was now decorated with drops of fresh blood and complemented by abrasions on his left eyebrow and cheekbone. Both spots were dark red and would turn purple by later in the day. Although he'd frequently taken his lumps while doing sports, there was a world of difference between voluntarily taking part in a match and beating each other up in a fit of rage and despair. The alcohol hadn't helped.
John looked at the letters with rounded eyes. Haltingly, he picked them up and thumbed through them like the pages of a book.
"No, I was bringing the laundry downstairs," Sherlock said and went back into the bedroom to put fresh linens on the bed.
John didn't know how he felt about that.
"No," John said. "Just... leave me be." He stood up heavily and turned to go into the kitchen. But Greg reached instinctively for his wrist, pulled him back, and put his arms around him. John let it happen as if in a daze. The other man's familiar smell and body heat surrounded him, but were only able to scratch at the surface of his consciousness. He hung lifelessly in the embrace, barely able to keep himself on his feet.
If there hadn't been such a hullaballoo when they'd come the last time to pick up Augustus Moran for questioning regarding Sebastian, they might have found the lab earlier and prevented another murder. Even if none of the affected parties shed a tear for the Lord. Quite the opposite: they were all happy the killer had been found. Even if he couldn't be brought to justice anymore.
"Well, that's the point. A bond between an alpha and an omega is generally consummated during a heat, for the specific reason that the processes which the body undergoes ensure that the omega doesn't feel any pain. It's similar to intercourse. Outside of a heat, penetration by the alpha may be perceived as unpleasant or even painful, especially if the omega hasn't been fully prepared. During a heat, the omega's body adjusts to the demands of the act automatically. Muscles relax, essence is produced, and all of that is necessary for the omega's body to fully accept a knot. Pleasure hormones are produced that have a euphoria-inducing and pain-killing effect. Many even report the bite as being pleasurable."
that the first serving was warm, John handed the plate to Sherlock, who began to eat with gusto. When his lasagna was warmed up too, John, feeling more ravenous than ever, cut off a large bite and shoved it into his mouth. The delicious combination of ground meat, pasta, and melted cheese exploded on his taste buds, making him sigh with bliss.
Sherlock shook his head, running his finger through some of the leftover sauce on his plate before popping it into his mouth. John hastily swallowed his mouthful of pasta, lest the lascivious sight cause his food to go down the wrong way. Even though he knew Sherlock wasn't doing it with any ulterior motives. Probably...
Just then, Victor realised that someone was leaning against the wall directly behind Abigail, watching him. Sherlock. Positioned between a window and a table, he had a good view of the entire room without being too visible himself. The insecure aura he was radiating must be due to the fact that he didn't usually come to events like this; or so Victor thought to himself. Sherlock raised a plastic cup to his mouth and took a large sip, quickly averting his eyes.
Later, they wouldn't be able to say whether hours or mere minutes had passed. At some point, they collapsed exhausted onto the couch, cuddled up together and enjoying the closeness they had abstained from for so long.
John smiled as well and nodded enthusiastically. As if on command, the door to the office opened and Mycroft's assistant entered, asked John to follow her, and turned on her heel without once looking up from her phone.
John felt like he was fifteen again. The only difference was that his breathtaking omega was spoiling him with his talented mouth, frantically chasing his own climax at the same time, rather than one of his crushes practising their awkward first attempts on him.
There was a buzzing sound, and Sherlock pushed against the door to enter the building. He walked up to the fourth floor and waited. He almost thought they'd forgot about him on his way up, but then someone finally took pity and opened the door to the flat. A young woman with long brown hair and alert grey eyes stood in the doorway. She tugged at the cotton shift she'd just thrown on. One strap of her bra had slipped down her shoulder and rested in the crook of her elbow.
The beta looked around suspiciously and lowered her voice. "He's one of those polybonders and has at least four omegas. And even so, he's scarcely home, always travelling for work. It's just the omegas who are always there."
"Sorry. I probably shouldn't have said all that."
Breathless, John watched Sherlock's blissful expressions in the half-light. His eyes closed, his sensual bottom lip tucked in between his teeth. John briefly regretted the insufficient illumination, wanting more light so that he could see more, more,
"John. This... is important to me. I don't want to give up my freedom just because I can't manage to take this step on my own. And I don't trust anyone but you right now. So do me this favour, all right?"
The monitor informed him that the next train was delayed due to a technical defect. The more people who gathered around him, the more restless John became. His eyes darted over the crowd of figures, vigilantly studying their expressions. A strong sense of panic began to stir in his gut, and his stomach twisted into knots. Feeling anxious, John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. In through the nose, out through the mouth. He simply wasn't used to so many people anymore.
Back in his bed he reopens the web browser on his mobile. It is now three o'clock in the morning. Chewing on his lower lip, he scrolls through the videos offered on a porn website and clicks randomly on a couple of short clips. The audio is turned down and barely audible, just loud enough so that he can hear the moans of the women whose oversized breasts jump over the display. John likes breasts, but today the sight causes nothing more than a tired tingling in his body. (I shouldn’t have drunk that bloody tea!)
Sherlock's imagination returned to the image of him riding John. The way his cock would stretch and fill him, completely stuffing him. Hard and hot inside. The way it would gleam wetly, anointed with his essence, drilling relentlessly into him, triggering innumerable nerve endings and setting Sherlock on fire. The way the knot would expand at the base, bumping against his hole over and over, spreading it open bit by bit until it overcame the last natural barrier and slipped inside. The way his muscles would swallow up the knot and clamp down with a burst of pleasure when the hard-packed flesh pushed against his prostate and filled in every nook and cranny inside him.
"What are those circumstances?" he asked after a bit.
Sherlock seemed to be in a similar state: the omega was fairly vibrating at his side, even if he appeared outwardly to be completely calm. But he couldn't fool John. The alpha not only felt Sherlock's excitement and coiled energy, he could smell it clear as day: the wild aroma of adrenaline and arousal.
John and Victor crossed Regent's Canal and turned left into the market to find something to eat first. They ate falafel wrapped in bread while alternately people-watching and observing the handful of boats in the canal. Victor grinned when he saw John making an effort not to let any of the delicious sesame dressing drip onto his blue shirt, yet still managing to get something stuck between his teeth.
He also worked on New Year's Eve, as he didn't feel much like celebrating. He'd barely been able to reach Abigail lately, as she was either spending all of her time with Marcus, or else Victor had the bad luck to get Tom on the phone whenever he rang their flat. Tom didn't bother passing the receiver on, instead hanging up promptly as soon as he heard Victor's voice.
With those words, John grabbed his sister's empty wine glass. He was barely able to rein in the impulse to throw it against the wall. Instead, he set it down firmly in front of his parents as a silent witness to the fact that they not only tolerated Harry's alcohol consumption, but encouraged it through their wilful ignorance. The sense of gratification he hoped to achieve remained elusive, however, as he saw not only Harry's dark blue eyes fill with tears, but his mother's as well. Sighing, he turned to Lorraine, pressed a kiss onto the side of her head, and whispered an apology into her grey-blonde hair.
"How quickly are alpha hormones broken down in an omega's body?" he asked instead.
Sebastian laughed. "Consult? Alphas? I can't imagine they let an omega tell them anything!"
Sherlock nodded and suppressed the small whimper that had found its way into his mouth. He watched out of the corner of his eye as John stroked his erection with his free hand, the way the glans disappeared over and over in his fist and how he gave a slight twist to his wrist to get the right stimulation.
"He spent nearly seven years in prison after being sentenced for his crimes. He must have managed to post the letters to Sherlock during that time. He obviously had someone helping him. Someone within MI6 who was supporting him. It might even have been the same person who arranged for Sherrinford to be offered a deal. This was just before there was to be a joint Canadian-Afghan offensive against cells of the Taliban in Panjwai."
Victor Trevor. What did he want now? They hadn't seen each other since their meeting at the cemetery and the spin round Camden Market; hadn't so much as texted or called. But John knew by now from experience that Victor usually meant trouble. He'd been attacked and injured by that youth in Camden – the same young man with connections to Sebastian Moran – while preventing John from confronting him. John didn't want to try and imagine what might have happened if it had come out that John had shot Moran. Not that the young man was any great danger in and of himself, but if he were mixed up in Moriarty's web somehow... the mere thought sent an icy shiver down John's spine.
She stopped speaking and sheepishly gestured at a casserole pan that smelled seductively like lasagne.
He looked over at John, who was still standing in the doorway, trying to figure out what the phone call was about. In addition, Sherlock still recalled John's warning about the risk of an unprofessionally conducted interview endangering the case. But what if the suspect wouldn't answer questions from anyone else? At least there was a good chance Sherlock would get some answers he wouldn't otherwise have.
"Shit!" All of a sudden, all of Bill's aggression vanished. She ran her hands through her short, sweaty hair. Then she grabbed John by the wrist and dragged him toward the exit.
"That's fantastic!" Sherlock exclaimed enthusiastically.
"Monsieur?" John asked, startled.
"Shame can induce people to do stupid things even when they know better. We'll try to help them get back on their feet now. After all... after all, we're family."
Ever since John had returned from the clinic, Sherlock had been retracing the same few square metres of the living room, giving an emotional account of his day.
, whispered a matter-of-fact female voice, which he identified as that of his old therapist, Ella Thompson.
Sherlock turned back to the screen, grumbling, and pressed 'play'. The interrogation room appeared again, but this time Mycroft was already seated when a limping Moriarty was brought in and chained to the usual chair. His face was disfigured, marred by dark red and blue bruises in several places. A laceration that had been covered with a thick gauze pad stood out over his left eye, which was heavily swollen. He must have been hit by several blows.
"Charming," Mycroft replied easily. "Can we get back to the business at hand now? With whom are you collaborating, James?"
Victor licked his lips and enthusiastically reached for Abigail's hand so he could twirl her around and dance with her. He pressed his hips provocatively against hers, rocking them salaciously. He found himself filled with a certain satisfaction. Sherlock was here. Good. It was a start. Of some sort, anyway.
"Who are you talking about?" John drew his eyebrows together, bewildered. Moriarty, Sherlock's arch-enemy, was in a maximum-security prison under continuous watch, so it could hardly be him. Mycroft was still holding something back.
Page 65:
"Well, could I wait for him?"
"I think you should sit down," Mary said and came closer to John to manoeuvre him inside the house. "Come on, I'll help you."
Since he was there anyway, he might as well drop by the Department of Chemistry and check the inscription lists to see which laboratory he was supposed to show up at the next day. He briskly rounded the corner, only to see from afar that there was a group of students already gathered in front of the bulletin board where the lists were hung. His eye landed on a young man he knew. He was the flatmate of Abigail, a good friend of his who had to start all over again this semester after switching majors.
Concern and anger flashed through John's gut for a fraction of a second, making him inhale sharply. He squeezed his right hand into a fist and dug his nails into the ball of his hand.
A small smile tugs at the corners of Sherlock's mouth. "You’re welcome."
His parents might not even know how far the friendship between Sherlock and Victor had gone at university. For that reason, John looked over at Victor for help, inwardly cursing the fact that he'd learned so little about Sherlock during the two years he'd lived with him. Why had he never asked what had gone wrong between him and his parents? And whether it had had anything to do with his sexual orientation?
John turned toward Victor, disturbed from his musings.
"Other things," Victor repeated and grinned when he saw the blood rise to Sherlock's cheeks and Sherlock's eyes fix somewhere straight ahead. He'd have to come back to that comment another time...
"You've got to buy it if you want to read it, aye?!"
"We also buried Sherlock..."
"Here, made just the way you like."
Nine months had passed since Archie was born. Sherlock hadn't seen either him or Anthea since. He'd fallen out with Mycroft so hard that he couldn't imagine their relationship ever being repaired. It hurt to know that the little boy would be growing up in a household without a father figure – not because Anthea had separated from Mycroft, but because nothing at all had changed about their situation.
Sherlock opened his eyes wide in shock and found himself staring at John's startled face, who had stopped moving. Had he returned the kiss? Sherlock didn't know. It didn't matter. It
"I need a shower. And I really don't like it when we're in different rooms," John said with a shrug, picked up his shower gel and started to soap up. "We should put something over the mattress, it's going to get completely soaked otherwise."
"Thirsty..."
With an unyielding grip, John twisted Sherlock's arm around to see the inside of his lower arm. He traced his fingertip along the crescent-shaped scar that shimmered brightly there.
Moriarty was obviously mentally disturbed, and being held in that tiny cell probably hadn't done much to improve his condition. Unfortunately, Sherlock was able to sympathise all too well. "Continue."
"Oh, John..." she gasped blissfully. She deepened the kiss, nipping at John's bottom lip before plunging her tongue into his mouth and swiping it across his.
Sherlock felt sick as he listened to the report. Several times, he had to swallow down a rising sense of nausea and try to control the trembling in his hands, even though he would have liked nothing more than to leap at the next alpha he saw and slam his fist into their face.
They'd only found James Moriarty's body, three days later. Mycroft had personally come to 221B Baker Street in order to inform John. The crime lord's body had got caught on something underwater downriver before the bloated remains had been washed up on the banks of the Thames. Due to technical aspects of the investigation, it wasn't possible for unauthorised individuals to inspect the body, but Mycroft had brought photographs to show John. He hadn't felt anything when he'd examined the images: Moriarty's black, motionless eyes staring unseeingly into the camera. Not even so much as a sense of justice had stirred within John.
John couldn't imagine what Victor's cryptic message meant. Did he want to meet up with him? Why didn't he just say so? Not that John was particularly keen on a meeting, but he had to admit that the story Victor had told last time made him curious. After all, Victor had known Sherlock much longer – almost twenty years – and therefore knew a lot of things that John could never find out otherwise. Things that would always remain hidden from him. Maybe Victor would be willing to divulge a little more, even if John wasn't sure whether he could handle any more intimate details.
"I know. But we'll both be at the Yard, surrounded by dozens of alphas and betas. It's highly unlikely that he'd be in any position to attack me, or even make the attempt. You weren't there when I confronted him in the lane, but he was... rather fascinated to find himself facing down another omega. Yes, he did try to overpower me – " Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock saw John stiffen. " – but it was child's play to put him out of commission."
"Show me his corpse." The smug smile didn't disappear from Moriarty's lips. He knew he had the better cards in this game, if the British government wanted to get any information at all out of him.
John nodded once and squared his shoulders, preparing for whatever came next.
"What's she talking about, John?" Sherlock asked warily.
What was the reference supposed to mean? Who was W? Victor had been frustrated by Sherlock's refusal to explain himself.
Sherlock immediately peeled off his soaked clothing. His coat and shirt had taken the brunt of it, but his trousers hadn't been spared either. As he made a beeline for the small bathroom, he heard John following close behind him, still complaining about his sister's behaviour. Sherlock stopped in the doorway to the bathroom and turned to face his alpha.
There was so much still unspoken between them. He didn't know what he was permitted to do, where Sherlock's limits lay, what was allowed or not. Just as he was about to claim Sherlock's lips with his for a kiss, the omega began to speak.
The springs of the mattress creak under John as he repeatedly turns from one side to the other. When his bladder turns against him and he feels the need to pee, he folds back the duvet, grumbling, and swings both legs out of the bed. He goes downstairs in the dark and switches the light on in the bathroom. After he’s used the toilet and washed his hands, he drinks a glass of water in the kitchen. He refills the glass and takes it upstairs.
"I'm almost positive – or at least I'm certain he
"Shame, that," John laughed around the food in his mouth.
you?"
good..."
"Sarah," John corrects automatically and cannot resist a silent laugh while digging out boxes from the plastic bag and putting them on the kitchen table. "Let's just say ... we didn’t get along as well as I originally thought."
"Have you now?" Sherlock cocked one eyebrow and looked at John with an expression of mild interest. But the omega couldn't fool John. The tension emanating from Sherlock fairly made the air around him vibrate.
He soon felt the glide become smoother, and John was able to move more easily. Perspiration beaded on his forehead and trickled down his temples as he finally managed to seat himself fully inside Sherlock. He let out a sound that was more growl than moan, and leaned down to unite their mouths in a heated kiss.
"I think he's asleep." Victor scooted closer to Tom and leaned over him until their faces were only a couple of millimetres apart. He could feel Tom's body heat and heard Tom's breath catch at the sudden closeness.
He'd hardly seen Sherlock at all over the past week: Sherlock had spent most of his time in the lab, which was mostly unused so close to Christmas. Victor had met up with him there once and peered over his shoulder to see if he could help Sherlock in any way with his first-semester assignment. But whatever Sherlock had been doing had had nothing to do with the introductory course. The only thing Victor had been able to tell after a cursory glance at the notes that Sherlock had made in his cramped, spidery handwriting was that it had something to do with advanced chemistry.
Sherlock's heart was beating rapidly and his cheeks burned almost as hot as the erection underneath his dressing gown. He wrapped the material more firmly around his body and turned away from the living room window in order not to have to watch John leave.
John freezes on the spot.
"John... I've done everything in my power to protect Sherlock, but it's obviously not enough."
Who set the mark for conventional roles in the first place? That was something Sherlock rejected anyway. Was it not time to break free of the chains of society and openly acknowledge their biology, their emotions, and their love once and for all? Did he have to redefine what it meant to be an alpha for himself so that Sherlock could be the omega he already was?
As soon as he'd explained the situation in a quavering voice and given the address, he went back to Anthea.
"You goddamned bastard!"
"Did you know about these letters?" he finally asked, but Mycroft shook his head.
"And that's the point. How can we not have noticed his scent before? Not even at the crime scene? I mean, two to four hours isn't enough time for a scent to fully dissipate."
My dear readers,
"Your soul bond!" Cilia's smile grew wider, although the tilt of her head and other body language signalled a lack of comprehension on her part.
He had so many questions, but knew all too well that he wasn't the one who should be posing them. Not now, and not here at any rate. There would be time for all of that later. He took out his phone pressed one of the speed-dial buttons to connect with Lestrade. No sooner had he reeled off their location than the omega leapt to his feet and lashed out at Sherlock with the shard.
"Oh..." Sherlock unconsciously touched the bandage wrapped around his chest underneath the hospital gown.
Sherlock wrung his hands nervously in his lap and averted his gaze from the alpha sitting across from him. It wasn't difficult for him to play at being intimidated – not because Augustus Moran had that effect on him, but because it was so easy for him to slip into the role of the shamed omega. He and John had gone over the plan for hours until they virtually incorporated their new identities in their very flesh.
Sebastian Moran looked almost the same as the first time they'd met. His shoulder-length hair was a little more stringy and hung down over his face in unkempt strands. The dark rings under his eyes had deepened, and the frantic look in his dilated pupils reflected a combination of fear and thinly veiled anger. He'd been given a jumper that was too big for him, as he hadn't been wearing anything more than a t-shirt when he'd run off. His right hand looked like it had been bandaged by a professional.
"Mycroft told me about Sherlock's problems at Uni, and that he moved in with you. About the fight with Sherrinford and... the overdose..." John anxiously rubbed his palm on his left thigh and wondered whether he might have changed anything about Sherlock's past, made anything better, if they'd met earlier. Whether he would have noticed how much the man would eventually mean to him. He pushed the train of thought aside as it wasn't doing anything other than causing a deeply rooted, dull pain.
"I love you," he breathed out against Sherlock's earlobe.
John quickly followed him into the darkened chamber, inhaling sharply in surprise when Sherlock let his dressing gown and pyjama trousers glide carelessly to the floor. He turned around to face John, naked, crossing his arms in front of his chest. Whether in a defensive gesture or to partially conceal his nudity was unclear. However, the uncertain expression on Sherlock's face, his nibbling at his lower lip, and his flickering gaze spoke for themselves.
But it wouldn't. John would never forget those eyes, where he'd lost himself in the scintillating sea of colours more than once. The intensity with which Sherlock had looked at him, making all doubts melt away regarding his ability to love. Their profound friendship. John had watched with a sense of gratification as Sherlock had slowly learned to understand and appreciate the value of that friendship. He'd felt a combination of pride and sadness at the same time. Pride because it was almost like teaching a child something wonderful. Sadness because the thought that Sherlock had had so few friends in his life was so unspeakably painful.
Mycroft rolled his eyes in annoyance and set the porcelain cup down on its saucer with a light clink. John couldn't say why, but the elder Holmes had the air of having been caught red-handed.
"Damn it," John grumbled, staring back intently at the wall.
. For some reason, that further darkened Sherlock's mood.
Sherlock shrugged with one shoulder, giving no further response. It was clear he didn't want to discuss the topic any more just then.
Three days later, Sherlock still hadn't left the house. He hadn't pilfered any of John's clothing or taken a hot water bottle to bed with him. Instead, he'd worked on his experiment and sent Lestrade a couple of texts regarding the McKenzie case, but the Detective Inspector hadn't had time to get another copy of the file to Sherlock. He suggested that Sherlock fetch it from the yard himself instead.
"If you say so. You'll know best what kind of people you want to associate with, John." Without gracing the men with another look, Mary strode down Baker Street and soon hailed a taxi, into which she disappeared.
"Don't say anything. I don't want to know. Not now. I only want you to understand that it's not all about you. We were both naïve to think we could enter into a bond and not have there be any consequences. That's what makes me so fucking angry. And then you go and think of nothing the whole time except how bloody hard it is for you as an omega. Did you ever stop to think it was also torture for me?
Despite all of that, Sherlock managed to get in touch with Sebastian through his old contacts. Although he wasn't entirely able to convince Sebastian that he was harmless, the man still sold him the drug he wanted. They agreed on a drop point for Sherlock to leave the payment. He later received a message where he could pick up his "order."
Sherlock grunted his agreement as he hovered over her shoulder. "Did she have blood drawn?"
"Make yourself comfortable, John. I'll just check whether I can scare up a blanket for you."
The Fisherman and His Wife
"They used Seven," Sherlock said softly.
Sherlock clung to John and buried his face in the crook of his neck. His heart was beating so hard all of a sudden that he thought he was having a panic attack. He felt his throat constrict and tears pricking at his eyelids, but something stopped them from spilling out and providing an outlet for the stress that had built up inside him. Short, gasping breaths burned in his lungs. The cool air seeped in underneath his clothes where John wasn't touching him, intensifying the confusing sense of being adrift.
"It's just that I'm… not used to it. You're so big. Move a little, all right? Slowly, slowly," Sherlock said, propping his hands against John's chest to guide and direct the shallow thrusts and stop them if necessary.
"Hm? John? What...?" Sherlock complained sleepily.
"Oh yes, I
"You should get some sleep..."
John had to bite down on his bottom lip so as not to cry out loud as he sank inside Sherlock's tight channel bit by bit. Sherlock seemed to feel the same. His mouth stretched wide in a silent groan, he leaned his head back, arched his spine, and lifted his body up as far as he could from the table until John filled him completely.
The scents of tobacco and leather hit his nose. A familiar, red-hot fury flicked through his gut when he fixed his eyes on Sherlock, still holding the McKenzie file.
"Fuck," John swore with awe and stepped further inside the room. As if in a trance, he closed the door behind him with a soft click. He then immediately slipped off his shoes and socks and took his shirt off. He struggled with the cuffs without taking his eyes off Sherlock, eventually tearing at the sleeves until he'd freed himself. Slowly, like a beast stalking its prey, he paced around the bed before coming to a stop at the foot, where he had the best view.
"You knew about it and didn't say anything?!"
"You couldn't have picked a worse time to call, Sherlock."
"He's awake."
Everything is back to normal. The bed is freshly made, though not quite up to John’s usual military precision. No ominous sex toys have been left behind. No signs of vandalism or Sherlock's unorthodox experiments. John can’t help himself from taking a deep breath in relief.
When Mrs Holmes returned to the living room with freshly brewed tea and refilled their cups, Victor sat up straight and gave her a disparaging look. "Several pictures are missing."
Others said that they were able to turn on their alphas enough with roleplay and expressly submissive behaviour that a knot began to form, if only for a short time. Whether such a reaction occurred was heavily dependent on the individual alpha's personality, however. Some of them enjoyed certain acts more than others, or were turned on by other things.
Sherlock returned to his seat behind the microscope with a scowl and stared demonstratively down the eyepiece. "The military academy. How often have you been rejected?"
As soon as they landed and the door of the private plane was unlocked, a team of four agents in combat gear stormed the tiny cabin. They approached the surprised passengers with their pistols raised.
..." Sherlock gasped, reaching behind himself to spread his cheeks and make it easier for John to get in deeper.
"Damn it, Sherlock..." John protested half-heartedly. Embarrassed at his misjudgement and the obvious signs of intimacy between himself and Sherlock, John averted his eyes.
Mycroft didn't seem to be doing any better. He was still abusing his keyboard, presumably searching for some clue as to Anthea's whereabouts. He had one small last hope that this grave suspicion would turn out to be wrong. Maybe Anthea had been abducted too? But the chances of that were low; after all, only a handful of people had unlimited access to those rooms.
It probably wasn't even necessary: the fact that John didn't feel any particular need to pay frequent visits to his nuclear family meant that Sherlock was largely absolved of the same responsibility. However, it was a different matter where Lorraine and George were concerned. After all, they weren't going to live forever, and Sherlock didn't want John to regret not having spent more time with them once they passed. And if Harry was going to be present on those occasions, they'd simply have to get used to it.
He was an alpha, just as his partner was an omega. Without beginning or end in the Biblical sense, but rather two bodies, two hearts, two souls.
"Hold that on your lip, I'll be right back."
"Are you serious? No! That's exactly what I don't want. It's stressful and doesn't do either of us any good to be constantly at each other's throat. But if we could find a way to get along better..."
"Yeah, I think so too." Lestrade said, keeping his eyes locked on John as he continued his examination.
"Yes..." Sherlock agreed, tugging at his clothing in order to get his jeans rebuttoned. He took a tissue out of his pocket and handed it to Victor, who accepted it with a word of thanks, so that he could mop up the worst of the mess. When he'd taken care of that, he took his cigarettes out of his jacket, opened the pack, and took one out. After he'd lit it and taken a deep drag, he passed it over to Sherlock and rolled down the window.
Sherlock gave Mycroft a gentle shove in the shoulder without letting go of John. "You can leave now, thank you very much."
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder and saw Mycroft clenching his hands into fists. A whining sound escaped his throat, but Sherlock couldn't tell whether it was from grief or anger.
"I think you've had enough..." he said and reached for the neck of the bottle, tearing it out of John's hand and ignoring John's bark of protest.
He found Sherlock in the living room, standing in the centre of the room with his arms folded in front of his chest and staring at the jam-packed wall. John still couldn't make out any connections in the display, despite the numerous red strings stretched between sticky notes, scraps of paper, and photographs.
"No."
that the cardiac massage was performed on."
"You should eat something. According to my information, you haven't eaten anything today and it would be regrettable if you collapsed on us during the flight. You'll need the energy."
But that was only one side of what had happened. John had a guilty conscience. He hadn't wanted to hit Victor. Alcohol, anger, and disappointment were one thing, but injuring someone on purpose went against everything John believed in. Yes, he'd hurt people before, even killed them, but never when acting on the basis of a selfish emotion like anger, vengeance, or jealousy.
John sighed softly. His body was confused, trying to separate the pain from the pleasure and transport enough oxygen into his cells at the same time. Dazed and overheated, John let himself sink into the kiss, nipping at Victor's injured lip with his teeth and eliciting a tortured moan from him. They kissed again and again, desperately smashing their mouths together and grabbing fistfuls of each other's clothes and hair.
"I wouldn't dream of it, Mr Holmes."
John hesitantly entered the house behind her and peered down the corridor as he closed the door after himself. His heart was beating in his throat, slowly but surely shutting off the oxygen to his brain. He felt downright dizzy, he was so nervous.
Sherlock's breath caught in his throat. John had wanted him from the beginning, and even now, after everything that had happened, after everything they'd done to each other over the years and everything they'd learnt about each other… he still wanted him.
The omega fell silent when John's eye was caught by something on the floor that had been hidden beneath Sherlock's thigh and the dressing gown before. They both stared at the open McKenzie file with the gruesome crime scene photos on top and the workup of the suspect beside them. John picked up the file with disgust and reluctantly examined the photos.
John twisted his mouth into a semblance of a smile and accepted the glass with a thank you. The whole atmosphere at the club was fairly overwhelming, and John realised without any real surprise that this milieu wasn't really what he needed on a day-to-day basis.
At first Victor's hands slid up and down Sherlock's thighs, which rested on the seat on either side of him. Then they slipped inside Sherlock's jacket, over his hips and waist. One ran up Sherlock's back, the other caressed his bottom. Sherlock's breath caught audibly at the unaccustomed touch, his teeth digging into Victor's lip. But Victor took that as a hint to continue his explorations, making Sherlock's attention flit back and forth as if following a tennis match.
John ignored the hurt expression on Martha Hudson's face as she stalked out of the kitchen in high dudgeon. What he'd said was true, after all. He didn't want the elderly woman in the flat. He didn't want anyone here. Not her, not that policeman who brought Sherlock those dubious cases and had just marched into his territory the day before as if he had any right to do so. He didn't want to see
Sherlock made a sound of agreement and rolled reluctantly out of bed. He would have liked to spend more time in the warm bed, but the chances were fairly high that they would be back soon enough. Making certain that John's eyes were glued to him, Sherlock walked around the bed, nude and without a lick of self-consciousness, and went to the door that led into the ensuite bathroom.
"Guys, what's going on here?"
"The best? You mean share heats?" Sherlock asked irritably, frowning.
"Are you seriously trying to tell me you're planning on completing uni in one year?"
John pursed his lips and set the phone aside. He picked up his tea, drained the cup, and put it into the sink. He pulled on a pair of jeans and a jumper, cleaned his teeth, and washed his face. The man reflected in the mirror looked like he was suffering from extreme exhaustion, but this was definitely not the time to think of sleep.
John nodded with resignation and looked around furtively to make sure no one else was listening. As an additional measure of security, he lowered his voice before continuing. "Sherlock isn't able to go into heat at the moment. He's already consulted a doctor and tried just about everything, up to and including some disgusting teas, but nothing's worked."
He slept an extraordinary amount. Maybe his body was taking the rare opportunity to catch up on all of the sleep it had been denied over the last decade. But Sherlock never felt completely rested. His mind's unaccustomed lethargy frustrated him to no end, yet he still couldn't decide whether it was better to be awake and wait for the few moments of alertness, or to sleep and dream.
John sat up far enough for him to kneel between Sherlock's spread legs and picked up the tube. It squelched when he opened it and squirted some of the viscous fluid onto his extended fingers. He spread it generously around Sherlock's arsehole without even coming close to penetration.
John acknowledges the defensive insult with a knowing grin.
"Sherrinford was the only one who called Sherlock by the name of William," Mycroft explained shortly.
"I only ask because it might be that your source has dried up. If your dealer's name is Sebastian, I see troubled times ahead..."
He was relieved when Sherlock nodded and made an affirmative sound. John cautiously manoeuvred them until they were lying on their sides, tucking Sherlock up closer against him and kissing the bite one more time.
Sherlock shook his head. "No, but your accent has betrayed you. The French lilt together with the American speech patterns. Where are you from? Louisiana?"
She turned around and gave Sherlock a brief nod. "Morning. Breakfast will be ready in a moment."
"Is he here?"
Holding himself up on his elbows, John continued moving his head up and down – sometimes slower, sometimes faster – letting Sherlock's erection thrust into his throat, sometimes partway or even all the way. Only when Sherlock was breathing hard and had forgotten everything else around him did John let up and lift his head to regard him with his pupils blown wide.
"We're on our way back to the Yard to interview Moran."
John leafed further through the album and found a page with three pictures of Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock was around fourteen, wearing a school uniform with the tie undone. He obviously hadn't cared for them even then. His face was stiff and empty of any emotion. Mycroft, who must have been attending university by that time, stood beside his little brother in a suit, not looking much different than he did in the present day. The only difference was that his hair was more voluminous and his face was smoother; the cool, distanced expression, though, was the one John recognised as that of the politician.
Without another moment's hesitation, Sherlock lunged forward and pressed a kiss to the reddened skin, tapping his tongue against it before withdrawing again. The alpha's fragrance exploded all over his taste buds, making his own cock twitch in lascivious anticipation. Still not certain how he was going to get the oversized alpha erection into his mouth, he cautiously licked around the rim of the head, then down the entire length to John's balls.
No matter how logical Sherlock's decision might have been to allow Victor to be shot so that John wouldn't receive the final dose of poison, deep down it must feel like a betrayal. John had no idea whether Victor would ever get over that.
one of the drugs used in the States for executions by lethal injection. Why not go ahead and use enough to kill the alpha outright? Why the bloodbath?" Sherlock asked rhetorically. "And then the two omegas... They were done in by the bond breaking, but there's still something strange about it. Look at this."
John held the door open so Victor could walk out with his bag. Together, they went to the aforementioned desk, where an orderly had already assembled the needed documents, which he handed to Victor. Victor thanked him briefly and stuffed them in his bag.
John didn't even want to hazard a guess regarding Victor. On the one hand, John could well imagine that the memory of the incident in the Rose Playhouse would be incentive enough to make Victor cooperate. On the other hand, it was also plausible that Victor was simply nowhere to be found because he was hanging out in some club again. Or he'd send Mycroft's agents away with a rude hand gesture and go into hiding for the foreseeable future...
"If you keep on like that, there won't be any left for John. When was the last time you had a proper meal, young man?"
"We haven't been able to discover what caused Anthea to work with Moriarty. As far as we know, none of her known family members or friends were threatened. At least not overtly. She apparently met Moriarty during her studies. He was going by the name of Richard Brook at the time. The file has been placed on the back burner for the time being. But that's not the reason I'm here."
His eyes wandered over to the inviting bed with midnight blue sheets, but Sherlock shook his head emphatically and pointed at the desk chair.
"It's all right, doesn't matter." It was clear that John didn't buy the lie, but it was hard enough to remain calm and not blow his top. "Although I don't much feel like going to your parents' right now," he added.
"What are you doing here?!" Abigail asked in a whisper. "Sherlock's not even here today," she added unnecessarily.
Meanwhile, Sherlock has dished out all the plates and drinks on the coffee table and turned on the small TV. Only the lamp on the desk and the flickering screen light the room, softening Sherlock's hard contours in their twilight. Sherlock stares skeptically at the screen with his eyebrows drawn.
"What?" John asked as he slipped out of his jacket and shoes and gave his weary limbs a stretch.
John wasn't lying there motionless either; he kept lifting his pelvis to get closer to the point of stimulation and his own release. He encouraged Sherlock with salacious comments, moaning over and over as he threw his head back to gasp for air.
A smirk stole across Victor's lips. "That's it. Although I'm not the one who wanted to practise before his big day. You don't want to embarrass yourself in front of Walters, do you? Come on, then. Show me what you've got."
"What do you want from Sherlock Holmes?"
Two other guests were standing in front of the cooker, scooping chilli onto their plates as they excitedly discussed some novel or other that Victor didn't know. He greeted them in passing, opened the refrigerator, and took out a bottle of beer, which he then handed off to Sherlock. He watched silently as Sherlock took a sip.
I moved the body into a corner and was about to return to Sherlock, fearing I would miss the grand finale otherwise. I stopped just in time when I heard footsteps on the stairs. Based on the gait and the tempo, I could tell that they didn't belong to another lost soul seeking refuge, but to someone who didn't actually want to be here.
"You could have brought them along," Sherlock reproached him, but his voice was utterly lacking in venom.
"Yes. No. I'm all right, but… the omega's injuries are… extensive."
Sherlock was in desperate need of a coffee and a cigarette, but didn't dare leave Anthea's possessions alone with these strangers. He rubbed his burning eyes, trying in vain to stave off exhaustion. Even more than the coffee and cigarette, however, he wanted to get his hands on his brother. He was so unbelievably furious at Mycroft that he wasn't sure how he would react when he finally saw him. What hare-brained excuse would he come up with this time? What possible justification would he dish up when he found out that he'd missed the birth of his child?
It was a sunny day. There were lots of people strolling through the streets, enjoying the beautiful weather. John watched them. A little voice in the back of his head asked when he would ever again be able to enjoy a day like this – or any day at all, for that matter. Whether there would ever be anything like carefreeness in his life again.
And yet he sensed his nerves reacting with increasing sensitivity to the gentle touches; his body undulating more strongly in response to the promising friction produced by the fingers inside him. It wouldn't take much longer until the wave of lust building inside him reached its crest, causing him to collapse back against the pillows, deflated. But not yet.
"To answer the door! Mrs Hudson isn't here, which you cannot have failed to notice," Sherlock stated, glaring down at John with a flash of annoyance.
The kettle clicked in the kitchen, and Mary got up to prepare the tea. John couldn't take his eyes off of Sherlock, and observed how he kept a vigilant eye on the agent as she walked away before turning to John. The hard lines in his face softened, and a gentle smile danced on his curved lips. John still couldn't believe they were back together. He squeezed Sherlock's hand affectionately and returned the smile.
"I don't quite know what to make of you fraternising with Mycroft. The two of you seemed downright
Lestrade squared his shoulders and stepped around the boxes. In the corner behind them lay a young man with tangled, curly hair. His mouth hung open, yellowish strings of saliva criss-crossed his chin, and an empty syringe protruded from his arm. He was pale and so emaciated that Lestrade's protective instinct immediately flared up. He struggled to rein himself in and not pick up the pathetic creature and carry him outside.
Wildflower honey, summer rain, nightshade and adventure. Danger. Moonlight. How did moonlight smell? John didn't know, and yet that tiny patch of skin on Sherlock's neck smelled just like it. A tone of yearning escaped John's throat. He swallowed hard, licked his dry lips, and withstood the urge to run his tongue across the fragile omega skin.
Sherlock snorted out a laugh and shook his head incredulously. "You can't honestly be serious! You're a man of science, speaking of such things as the soul? The soul is nothing more than an absurd construct arising from theistic superstition and mystery traditions! What does any of that have to do with me?"
During the first three days at the Holmes residence, Sherlock locked himself in his old room and only communicated through the closed door. After a while, however, he got so bored that he occasionally sought out Anthea's company.
"John Watson. Mycroft Holmes is expecting me."
It wasn't until much later, after he'd gulped down a sandwich and drunk a cup of coffee, that John felt he was ready to ask Bill what had happened. He barely remembered anything other than the all-engulfing panic and the knowledge that his omega was in a life-threatening situation.
Sherlock rubbed his eyes as he listened to the report, pressing his teeth together so hard that his jaw hurt. He startled when he felt John's hand at the small of his back.
Hard evidence would be necessary to pursue a charge that Lord Moran was engaged in some form of human trafficking. But under the current circumstances, it would be difficult to get a statement from his omegas, and even then that wouldn't be enough to charge the alphas involved. And of course no one expected that any of the alphas would voluntarily surrender if they were found guilty.
The incoming message signal from his phone startled him awake. Still half-asleep, John read the few brief words and yawned extravagantly. He lay down on the couch and blinked against the light from the phone screen.
"Is it dangerous?" Sherlock asked, looking sceptically at the needle which the other omega held between her bony fingers.
He was on his feet in a flash, already pulling on his dressing gown, when he stopped and grimaced in pain. His shoulders, his back, his thighs – his entire body, really, ached with every movement. Now that the hormones from the heat were no longer coursing through his veins, he abruptly became aware of just how strenuous it all had been.
"Nothing. That's just it... He didn't do anything. In fact, he was always quite solicitous with me. Not like Mycroft. He was patronising. But Sherrinford... he always kept an eye out for me. I was the baby of the family and he was my big brother. He often read me fairy tales, I still remember that..."
"Please tell me that you didn’t send emails in my name," John pleads as he taps Harry's year of birth to unlock the screen. At first it looks like nothing has changed, but that doesn’t mean anything. Muttering quietly, John decides that if Sherlock has denounced anyone on his behalf
Moriarty, who hadn't missed the hasty retreat, smiled sedately into the camera and shook his head. "Do you really think I'd let you change the rules of the game just like that, Sherlock? Believe me, I've thought of every possibility and planned ahead. If Mycroft turns up at that nasty secret hideaway before we've finished our game, all of your friends will die. Anthea will put a bullet through each of their skulls, one after the other, and I'll have the pleasure of putting down your beloved pet... and believe me, it would be more than a pleasure!"
For several long seconds, Mycroft simply gave John a calculating look; John fancied he caught sight of the internal dispute on his face, which was unable to conjure up its usual icy facade again. This might have been the first and only honest conversation he'd ever had with Mycroft Holmes, John considered, biting down on the inside of his cheek as he waited expectantly for it to continue.
John instinctively placed one hand on Sherlock's thigh, giving it a soothing squeeze when it began to bounce. Sherlock froze briefly, only to relax markedly a moment later.
"John!" Sherlock gasped as he reluctantly let go of John's erection. He wiped the spit off his chin and sat up. His arms and legs quivering, he inserted his knees to either side of John on the sofa and pushed up against his hot body, pressed his lips to John's and kissed him greedily.
John shook his head. "Not really. I've only known for a couple of hours that you... that it was all a setup."
John ate a meagre dinner alone, then flicked disinterestedly through the TV channels until he grew tired. He completed his evening ablutions lost in his own thoughts. But before he got as far as wondering whether to go directly to bed or try to speak with Sherlock again, there was a tentative knock on the connecting door.
John pulled Sherlock toward him as he leaned in to give him a hug and kiss him on the cheek. "I love you," he whispered.
"Good, I'm glad I've caught you. We've got a problem. Thanks to what went down at Lord Moran's and the subsequent media presence, it looks like we'll be moving the case to the back burner for the time being."
"So, Mycroft. How was your meeting?"
"Well, Moran was also a no-go. None of the four wanted to be associated with that name any longer, as I'm sure you know. They consulted amongst themselves and eventually decided to name the wing Novikov, after—"
"Let him go and we won't chase you down," Sherlock tried to negotiate.
Just then, the whitewashed door of the house was flung open, and Cilia ran out. If it could be called running, as she was preceded by an imposing stomach. She awkwardly pulled John in for a hug, and he in turn clasped her firmly back. The scents of daisies, rock candy, and morning dew infiltrated his nose, causing him to sigh with pleasure.
Greg crouched down in front of him, sighed, and reached for John's hand, squeezing it gently in a futile attempt to give him some comfort. The dull emptiness inside John prevented him from reacting to the touch in any manner. He stared absently at the fingers stroking the back of his thumb. Warm and callused. The faint scent of nicotine hit his nose, betraying the fact that Greg must have had a smoke a short time earlier. Something he rarely did anymore. Only when he was nervous, overwhelmed, or out of ideas. Right then, he might have been all three.
Sherlock looked at John, only to promptly turn his face away again. He wrung his hands in his lap nervously.
"Should I order in something to eat – Hey, are you for bed already?" John asked as he stuck his head in through the crack between the door and the jamb.
Sherlock checked his watch and calculated that he had a little over an hour before John returned from the late shift. That should be enough, he decided, and went into the bathroom. After a thorough wash, he walked nude into the bedroom and opened the bottom drawer of his dresser, where he kept the alpha dildo he'd bought several months ago to get John's goat.
Alpha and omega moaned in unison.
Sherlock came. His body surrendered, his nerves quivering against the onslaught. Pure ecstasy washed over him, sweeping his body clean for the span of several fleeting seconds. He felt his cock twitching against his abdomen and the wet bloom of his ejaculation. A whimper escaped his throat.
"He did, but that wasn't until a few years later. As I said, the mutism disappeared when Sherlock got the dog. He began speaking in full sentences from one day to the next. To be frank, there was no stopping him. As if he were trying to make up for lost time. He continued at school here for a couple of years so that I could keep an eye on him. After Redbeard died, though, Sherlock wanted to transfer to boarding school. He was ten, and it was very difficult for him to integrate in the new class. That remained the case all through school and carried over to university as well. And that's where he met..." Mrs Holmes inclined her head in Victor's direction, but he didn't respond to the prompt.

"Dr Watson, I must say, I'm surprised that my brother's trust fund has only now become a topic of interest within your relationship. Considering the financial environment from whence you come and the substantial holdings of the Holmeses."
Warning: This chapter contains a goodly portion of dubious consent (dub-con).
What had happened? What had they discussed that would have an effect like that on the man who was otherwise such an even-tempered port in every storm?
"Fuck, you're so hot." The words huffed out against his neck. Sweet pain where blood vessels burst beneath tender skin. Large, warm hands under the borrowed black shirt, on his bare stomach, in the sweat-damp groove of his backbone. A hand stumbling over the heavy-duty material of his jeans and grabbing his arse, eagerly drawing him closer to the other body.
It wasn't until they were sitting in a taxi on the way back to Baker Street that Sherlock dared to let his shoulders droop and exhaled wearily. He rested one elbow on the side door frame and rubbed his eyes with his thumb and index finger.
"All right, if you insist on hearing it… Yes, I need you, Doctor Watson. Your medical skills are by far superior to mine. Please, please work with me and so on and so forth," Sherlock says unconvincingly. When John responds with a chuckle, Sherlock pouts, offended and crosses his arms in front of his chest.
"I hope I haven't forgot anything," Molly said, pushing the front door to 221B shut with her foot; in one hand she held a bag and the other was balancing a box.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson
"I panicked and used too much force. But you were so pale, and..." Lestrade buried his face in his hands and let out a heavy sigh. "I couldn't let you die."
It was impossible.
But maybe... "Do
Victor let his gaze wander over Sherlock's awkward figure. He usually made such an unapproachable, supercilious impression, as if no one could touch him, as if he stood above everyone and everything else. In reality, though, there was so much insecurity under that stiff exterior, so much curiosity paired with a sense of adventure... a rebel who was resisting the strictures of family and society but didn't know exactly what he hoped to achieve through his protests. Someone who tended not to fit in, and ended up pushing everyone away in his desperate attempts at holding on. A study in contradictions. Looking for his place in the world.
"Sherlock." The monotone voice on the other end instantly catapulted Sherlock back to the past, to a life he'd left behind long ago.
"Most likely. But Mycroft is one of their ranks, and he's been personally affected now. Maybe he can move the discussion in a positive direction."
He parted Sherlock's rounded arse cheeks, exposing his anus. The object of his desire. A little redder than usual, and maybe a little puffy. John licked his lips greedily and bumped his nose against Sherlock's bottom.
Greg nodded, grateful. Then left.
In addition, the idea of being soul-bonded to a partner who had made it crystal clear that there was no place in his life for John made him feel a deep sense of panic. A run-of-the-mill bond was one thing, but a link between their souls was something else altogether.
John reflects upon how he should react if Sherlock is going to backpedal and try to sweep the whole thing under the rug. Did he do something wrong? What it too much? Too intimate? It seems impossible to assess the situation without confronting Sherlock.
Sherlock, both arms wrapped around himself and his shoulders drawn up around his ears, only relaxed a little when the downstairs front door was pulled shut and John's scent diminished noticeably.
Victor held out a piece of paper the size of a business card. An address was printed on it, and three numbers were handwritten on the back. He placed it in Ryan's hand, brushing his fingers as he did, without breaking eye contact.
He watched for a while as Abigail tried to get Sherlock to dance, the way she kept pulling him back in whenever he tried to pull away. She liked Sherlock, that much was obvious. He had become part of her circle of friends, part of her little family, and it was important to her that she let him know.
"What time is it?" John mumbled unintelligibly.
"And no wonder," John laughed, amused at Sherlock's affronted tone.
Sherlock removed his hand from John's shoulder and buried it in his own hair instead. Throwing his head back, he sped up his movements, incessantly fisting his cock and moaning with abandon into the room.
He was only briefly surprised at his own boldness, whispering fantasies like that into Sherlock's ear, here in a strange bed. But his arousal had materialised all of its own accord at the sight of his omega unclothed, and he didn't want to hold back. Not today. Not now. Maybe not ever again.
"Oh? Show me!"
"He gives control over to the other alphas and we... have to live with the consequences."
"No, never."
"I simply asked about the situation with my trust. It's no secret that Harry drinks, and your parents' debts—"
Nausea rose in Sherlock's craw. He pressed his lips together and put one hand over his mouth. That couldn't... it couldn't be true. Not John.
"He was a big man. Not nice. Selfish. Rough. Une brute. My heats were irregular, and too infrequent for his taste. He didn't like it when I turned him away. You must be familiar with this?" The omega glanced beseechingly at Sherlock, then returned his gaze to the table. "It... it hurts without the essence... and... I'm not sad that the bond is broken, okay? The first few weeks were hard, but I figured out what to do."
The timbre of the man's voice was accented, although John couldn't make out its origin. Visibly nervous, Jean-Baptiste ran his hand through his short, cropped hair and regarded his visitors uncertainly.
At the moment, he was thinking about Harry's past and her hatred for alphas and omegas. No one had told her that it was an omega who had saved her life, the reason being that no one was quite able to anticipate how she would react to the news.
Sherlock sighed heavily. "My alpha can't get through an entire heat with me due to his injuries. And that makes him unhappy – as you can see." He gestured vaguely at his injured cheek. "He's looking for another alpha who can take on that duty. Lord Moran expressed an interest, so..."
"Oh, you know... well, I don't like to gossip and one isn't aware of everything that goes on. But I do get the sense that there's a spot of trouble now and then. One of the boys in particular, Sebastian, doesn't seem all that pleased with the situation. And who can blame him? He was the first omega Lord Moran bonded with. The poor boy was almost still a child, just barely of age. And then one omega after another's been added year after year. Sodom and Gomorrah, I say. At any rate, I need to be pressing on. My Sekhmet is already anxious to be taking care of her business."
, Sherlock thought to himself and reached for his coffee cup. He stared down into the dark brown liquid, in which the six lights of the contemporary chandelier hanging over the table were reflected.
John shook his head and stood up, grabbed his keys and phone off the table, and put them into his trouser pockets. He needed a walk, now.
But what if he does? If John refuses and deletes the app? Would they simply return to their normal daily life and pretend nothing happened? (Do I even want that?!)
******
"So... will you finally have coffee with me?" Mary asked, and John could have sworn the invitation was extended in a lascivious purr.
John flinched back as if Sherlock had slapped him, tugging automatically at his faded jumper. It was old, washed once too many times, and stretched out of shape, just like his jeans, which had also seen better days. To say nothing of his worn-out trainers. He felt the red of embarrassment rise to his cheeks. And here he was an alpha, putting on such a display in front of an omega! His family's impoverishment had always been a sour spot for John, and he'd worked hard to pay for medical school.
Sherlock huffed disparagingly. "Thank you for that reminder!"
"You've found one more." Not a question; a statement of fact. Or maybe it was the only logical conclusion which the mind of such a highly intelligent man could draw.
"Up, come here..."
John frowned sceptically and drank some of his coffee. "We should have at least let them know we're coming, shouldn't we? I mean, maybe they're not even home. I imagine they're both very busy people and wouldn't be particularly enthused about two friends of their dead son suddenly popping up on their doorstep... especially after all the fuss that was made about his de— about everything."
He leaned over, kissing and licking Sherlock's thighs and grazing his teeth lightly across his skin. When Sherlock leaned up on his elbows in order to see better, Victor put one knee between Sherlock's legs and pushed him back down onto the mattress. Heated lips blazed a trail across Sherlock's chest, each individual rib, his flat stomach, lingered on the prominent hipbones and briefly brushed his erection.
"Of course... of course I forgive you, you idiot. And if we can close the file on that whole episode, I'd be in favour."
"I know you do," Victor said with a sidelong smile at John. They fell into a companionable silence, watching the dancing crowd from their vantage point while John drank the rest of his beer.
"What do you mean?" John asked evasively.
They ate dinner together, then watched a documentary on BBC and had an animated discussion over it. Afterwards, Sarah helped John to set up the sofa bed, and they said good-night. It was pleasant to spend time with her, and it all felt very natural.
"Not necessarily. I mean, of course he preferred London over anything else, but he was only in Sussex over the holidays anyway. His parents lived and worked in London themselves as far as I know, before they retired to Sussex. The children were shipped off to boarding school and only spent holidays with their parents. I never saw the London house, but I've been to Sussex once or twice."
"Mum, may I present Sherlock?"
"John..." he whispered softly and pushed his face firmly into the crook of his alpha's neck.
Sherlock scraped a few crumpled banknotes out of his trouser pocket and smashed them against Wiggins' chest. "I'll pay more than usual. What more do you want?!" The immediate proximity to the junkie coupled with his sour breath made Sherlock's stomach roil with nausea. He watched the corner of Wiggins' mouth twitch, a nervous tic when he felt that he was being hassled. Or was it... a mischievous grin?
"I told you he was here," Abigail said, nodding toward the young man sitting in the last row of the lecture hall by the window, trying in vain to melt into the background.
