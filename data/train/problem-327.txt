Sherlock looks away, embarrassed. 'I haven't yet. I watched some youtube videos. I was still… getting hold of it.'
John had been somewhat angry with Mycroft. But he looks at his worried and resigned face, and understands what he has been told all this time.
'Really though?' he replies sarcastically. 'I don't know a single creature with poorer social skills than you. And you throw the sociopath card around so people don't know. You are aware of your limitations.'
Since it’s a self-fulfilled prophecy, try to avoid visualizing a pink elephant and that’s all you’ll have in your mind, he rewinds the events. Sherlock putting a coffee in front of him, Sherlock pulling him all the way to the canteen, Dr. Coleman going back inside the staff area of the hospital, him almost losing his temper at her, Dr. Coleman explaining to him there were no signs of pregnancy or a baby, him questioning if she had mistaken the patients charts, Sherlock’s hand at his shoulder anchoring him, Dr. Coleman saying Anna wasn’t pregnant.
'To be honest, I'm not entirely sure he came back home yesterday. He has been arriving late for some days now because of the case.' Mrs. Hudson tells him in a worried voice. He passes Rosie to his other arm to relieve the left one.
The car enables a bluetooth connection to his phone through the radio system. He prefers not to listen to music while driving, but he does tap the panel screen to make a phone call. It rings twice before they pick up.
After that, there was the wedding. He had asked himself if it was normal to not to be fully delighted, participating in all the plans - even Sherlock had been completed involved. And all John wanted was to ignore all that.
John tenses again beside him, but he just shrugs. She doesn't acknowledge John, and is taken downstairs. They barely notice another agent placing her gun in a plastic bag and following his colleagues.
Thing is, as professional as she was, she still needs to use the toilet eventually. So she informs Fairbrother where she is going, and he immediately pockets his phone, to pay full attention to his surroundings, seeing that now it would be only one pair of eyes.
'I understand.' John replies, keeping his voice from cracking. 'It seems stronger than a person. But...' he swallows and looks away. 'There's two of us to fight it. If you ever feel like that… just tell me. I'll be here. Always.'
People consider twelve weeks the safe point, but spontaneous miscarriage could happen until about twenty weeks, even if not that common. What could have caused it? She wasn't exactly young. Twelve weeks. They both know the procedures of late miscarriage, and all the pain involved. He remembers Mycroft mentioning her going to a pharmacy in his first surveillance report.
John isn't much thrilled to come back to Mary's house, as he started to call it, but Rosie was there. She started to smile when he arrived, wobbly arms supporting the raising head that turned to the sound of him entering the nursery.
There's a lump in his throat that he hopes doesn't evolve. 'And I will not lie to you again.' he adds quickly, because he supposes he should. John looks contented to hear, so it's a win.
'That leads us to the first part of the plan. I told you the second was easier. If we need to go through this
None of that diminishes the fact that working at this surgery has become unbearable. The environment has never been his cup of tea to begin with, but since he had been labeled as the cheating spouse alienating his daughter, the understated general hostility towards him makes the whole morning go as slowly as possible. He reaches the conclusion that it's honestly not worth it feeling humiliated every day.
Haines understood. “I get you. I hear you loud and clear. Very well then, we will keep an eye on him. All of us.”
“I am sorry for the late notice. But I really am not in a position to do the surgery, after this horrid stomach upset and nausea.”
“Hudders,” Sherlock was appalled, “Will you please let me finish my sentence and stop second guessing? Mycroft is annoying enough when he does that and I don’t need you to act like him in his absence.”
John nodded. That was vintage Moran. Always very clear about what he wanted. He wished he was a bit like that.
John and Sherlock stared at each other, confounded. Then Sherlock said a startled ‘Oh’ and looked over his shoulder. The origin of that cry was from somewhere behind and he saw a head and an arm bobbing over several other heads and faces. Sherlock stopped, stepped away from the escalators and peered closer, then smiled with recognition. John, on the other hand, got pushed on to the escalator by the rushing crowd after him and found himself separated from Sherlock.
Sherlock hung up. An angry hulking giant like Sebastian was hardly a foe worth taking on. If Jim had brought this on himself, then he better handle it on his own.
Sherlock held his head in his hands and made a pained sound. His head was reeling and his palms sweaty, whirlwind of thoughts were swirling in his mind as he kept pondering about possibilities of John being swindled, John being hurt, John being compromised was not letting him settle down in a spot. He felt restless, angsty, antsy. “Listen to me Mister Bouffler,” Gretel whispered, “There is a reason why you notice a huge difference in fortunes between Mr. Watson’s family and Mr. Moran’s family. While Dame Rosalie is a sensible woman who married a sensible, enterprising gentleman, worked hard on her marriage and kept temptations at bay, her sister married someone who blew up all his family fortunes. Since then, Sebastian’s father’s generation onwards, this family has been pulling the other one like a horse pulls a cart. They live like kings without a penny in their treasury, all of it borrowed or donated.”
Sherlock lifted his legs higher in the air and that move made John slide in even deeper. The inner muscles tightened around his cock and he grunted loud, supporting himself on his strong arms and rising above Sherlock for a moment.
“Yes, yes I would love to. I’ll give you my ID and details. And Jawn, do you think it would be a good idea to take an ad out in the papers for you? Maybe there are family members and friends waiting for your return. They’d discover you and contact us and…. As some theories state, if you see the same places you were used to you might just get that
“But-But that is, that is…..” Mike Stamford seemed a bit perturbed. Phillip Anderson audibly chuckled and snorted in disdain. Greg finished the sentence for him, “The state owned place for rehabilitation and reformation. Yes, that’s the place. Where do you want us to take him doctor, some five star resort that’s eco friendly and offers organic breakfast and dinner?”
John was taking a bath when a strange sensation began to sweep through him. Initially he thought it was just his mind playing tricks on him but with passing time he realized it was no trick of the mind or some hallucination, he was ACTUALLY seeing vivid images of a naked Sherlock stretched out before him like an ‘All you can Eat’ buffet.
John almost groaned as Jim joined them. “Do not trust him! He still sends Adler his nudes, which she uses to trap bisexual women into a supposed threesome and then blackmail them.”
A twitch to his groin and a growing heaviness in his balls made him realize to his dismay that he was not quite ready to call it a night yet. He needed more, he wanted more, he had to have more. Sherlock’s wig had fallen off, his hairs were a mess underneath it, and he was spread eagled on the mattress, totally slack and limp. Occasional snorts and a constant stream of gentle snores left him, indicating a deep and peaceful sleep.
But that smile had nothing pleasant about it, not did it reflect happiness. It was sinister, sharp, sly, it almost cut through Sherlock’s skin as it focused on him for a bit longer than necessary. John seemed quite pleased to see his cousin though and stepped up to give him a hug. They made quite the contrast as two brothers, nearly eight or nine inches difference between them in terms of height.
Sherlock mewled softly as John finally softened and slipped out of him but continued to lie on top of him, moaning softly, his legs still spasming a bit from the remnants of his release a while ago. Sherlock’s own legs dropped back on the mattress but he kept both his arms tightly wound around John. He was scared that if he let go of his man this reality would vanish, as would his John, and he would be back in some deep and dark hole somewhere, languishing in regret.
The two other ladies laughed none too quietly. Sensing that staying back here would only make him lose face and feel the pinpricks of such unsubtle insults, Phil almost backheeled out of the room. Mrs. Runa Chakraborty adjusted the glasses on her nose and gave a sharp glance in the direction of the departing man and muttered, “Idiot.”
, without his wits around him, it was not a sight he was prepared to see. He wished he could close his eyes, open them a bit later and all this would change and go back to normal.
I have made six decision points, which I want to share with you and take your opinion on! First, I am going to ask the government to give me an official space where we can display the art and paintings my family owns. While the government will maintain the security and maintenance of the space, the money made from tourist visits and entry fees paid by locals will be donated to an organization that supports budding artists. I will retain ownership over the artifacts but won’t make any money off them.”
The two men in their late middle age nodded affectionately, each exiting the car he was driving and handing the keys to their sons. “Twenty fifth birthday gift,” Reginald Holmes hugged Sherlock and pointed with a flourishing gesture of both arms, “The Chimaera, roadster for you.” Next to them Jeremy Moriarty was shaking his son’s hand, “Congratulations son, your new Jag is finally here!”
As soon as he had entered the room, he noticed the reasons why women and some men liked this guy with the strange name and chased him despite his eccentric behavior.
. “Wait,” the young boy said, shaking his head from side to side so his curls bounced, “You don’t have to eat that Mr. Klaus. You said you like bangers and mash, don’t you? Well, I could get you that. Incidentally we had bangers and mash for dinner and two of our guests didn’t show up. They were stuck in the snow somewhere. So their food is in the fridge but I suppose they wouldn’t mind if something else was served to them tomorrow. I could heat that up in a jiffy in the oven. I do know how to operate it.”
“Calm down, calm down Molly, it’s fine, he’s just another man and not the country’s Premier or Prince of Wales,” Mike did his best to soothe her as she fretted, “Just take the sugar separately and ask His Highness to mix it by himself.” Her demeanor had changed completely from relaxed, easy and happy to restless and apprehensive and John found that very odd. Who had asked her for coffee? Was it her boss? Even if he was, this was just not done. She was not his beck-and-call assistant, she was a fully qualified pathologist. He gave Mike a quizzical glance to which the latter made a subtle eye movement, indicating he would talk about this later.
“We were just smoking, I mean….. Sherlock was smoking and I accompanied him,” Jim said cleverly as they came out of the animal pen, leaving the cacophony behind, “They don’t allow smoking anywhere else around the fair for fear of fire etc. ten years ago there was a terrible fire on the very last day of the fair and more than six people were killed, double that number injured. Hence the caution, even today.”
“Imagine, the diamonds were hidden in the turkey, the roast turkey,” John giggled, unsteady on his feet but trying to keep Sherlock off the road as the lanky coat-clad man kept veering towards that side, “Diamonds worth like what……
“Sebastian the Tiger has given me an ultimatum, no getting into another’s pants,” Jim cooed, humming a tune and talking at the same time, making things slower and infuriating for the sleuth who controlled his temper somehow. He knew better than to lose his cool with Jim because the madman was still in several ways a madman and could make him miserable for several days later. John too. So best way was to feign ignorance and wait for Jim to come to the point. He eventually did so. “Soooo, I had been fucking around with men and women until last year Sebby put a ring on me and signed some papers. They called it marriage and now whatever I own, he owns half of it. If I stray he divorces me and if we divorce I lose half my assets. Nope, it’s nothing romantic but…….”
Sherlock looked a bit perplexed. “He owns a hamlet? I mean, what is this property actually? I thought it would be a mansion and vast, expansive grounds.”
No, he wasn’t going to let that happen. He knew what he had to do. Yes, this was the only way out. He was going to end this life, end his misery once and for all. With that thought he reached for a paper-cutter knife, with a sharp and shiny blade, it’s handle inscribed with his name. a present from Sherlock. How ironical! He would die from this instrument and give their tragic tale the finest footnote. He picked it up and raised his arm.
“Oh no no, I didn’t mean this,” Irene was hysterical, “I never wanted them to die. I thought it was only a sinister plot….. ohmygoodLord what have I done? John and Seb will never forgive me, never will they forgive me……”
“Guys, hey…..oh you’re having some high tea here!” Eugenia Holmes entered the conservatory with three people in tow, all three wearing decent clothes and looking pretty nervous. Mycroft and Eurus exchanged looks, same thought playing on their minds.
That revealed the latest home gym concept, The Mirror. An interactive tool with an interface that allowed one to workout anytime, without always resorting to gyms and personal trainers, stream videos form YouTube or specialized classes provided by fitness experts.
“Your brother tests me at home for preparedness, you test me here…..I have to confess you guys are all a bit we…wee..wei…..”
John was tempted to accept the hundred grand including employer’s contribution to pension funds and a single four figure variable bonus a year but he remembered what Sherlock had said. So far whatever the man had ‘deduced’ had been proved right, including the fact that he would soon get a call and an offer, so he decided to go the rest of the way based on his new housemate’s suggestion. “In that case we will probably have to re-think,” John said amicably, “Or conclude with a ‘no-thank-you’ handshake. No hard feelings here but I can’t accept this offer since it’s a few notches below what the current market-rate is. I am not just a consulting physician, I am a surgeon.”
John smiled, “I realize I do deserve that judgement. Alright, we go back home and talk. I have realized my error. I hope at least you will consider the apology, if not give it to me right away.”
“Oh don’t you worry your pretty head over it,” John said with an assuring smile at his young lover, then looked at the bare arm Sherlock had exposed by taking off his shirt, “This is not exactly a minor scratch but nothing worrisome either. But frankly, what puzzles me is how did you manage to get it? Who the hell gave it to you? Did you scrape your arm on something sharp in your house or lab?”
The fragility of life, relationships and happiness struck him full force and he felt blank for a few moments.
“All right, if I have to spell it all out,” Sebastian chugged back his second drink and reached for a plate of fish and chips, “I am not the ‘committing and settling down’ kinds. Jim is not someone who can be managed by me, someone who is not at par with him intellectually. So we agreed on a middle path, something that works for both of us. Mycroft was sending him feelers and he responded to them agreeably, we saw a potential of a romance…..but more important than that, a relationship that could last forever. Believe me, had I been in a long term and exclusive relationship with Jim he would have either blown me up, turned me into shoes or had himself committed somewhere.”
“Good, I am glad to hear that. Let’s go back home. I need a shower,” Sherlock said, already turning towards the path home.
……he thought, without thinking about how later would be better. His mind was an enormous cauldron of conflicting thoughts right now.
He was about to get out of there when he saw that confounded Harry coming up the sloping path. Jim was prepared for him this time and sprung the trap for that person, a man-trap which he had devised entirely from natural sources.
John laughed, seeing Sherlock squirming. “Don’t worry. I am not going to ask for sex tonight. tonight we just get used to sleeping next to each other.”
“See, I don’t have them on,” Sherlock pointed at his bare groin, “I was free-balling today. It seems none of my underwear was washed so I……”
It was a dark and stormy night. In the suburbia town the streets were empty, late-night revelers and pubgoers had chosen to withdraw to the safety of their homes and even the cops, whose duty involved patrolling the streets irrespective of the weather, chose to stick to their cars and remain safe. There was a warning of a cyclone, a really bad storm with winds traveling at high speeds and chances of a downpour of mammoth proportions.
He heard the other man’s moans reaching a crescendo, he felt the hand speed up and bed shake harder, he sensed Sherlock was tensing up.
“Mmmm,” John intended to return the favor fully, “You sexy little bitch, what a boner you pack here! All ready to cream yourself, eh?”
To her surprise and somewhat relief, she didn’t hear it anymore. Whatever was following her had thankfully left her alone. Maybe it was a Divine blessing on her which her poor boyfriend didn’t have. After that it all slowly turned black for her as she passed out from the grief, exhaustion and shock of the incidents.
Sherlock was the first one to wake up. He randomly shook John by the shoulder. “Jawn?” “Hmm, mmm, what is it? Go back to sleep!” “No, someone was outside.” “Impossible, no one would come here.” “I thought I heard someone, towards your mother’s room.”
of fixing. I have forgotten the one-bite-cocktail-snack recipe you taught me once. The hard boiled and halved quail eggs sprinkled with rock salt, dried oregano, chilli flakes, hot sauce and a wee droplet of maple syrup?”
He parted the cheeks and dove in. He fucked it with a hard tongue and when Sherlock’s moans rose and he started to thrash about, he started to soothe it with licks with the tip and flat of his tongue. He alternated between the two ministrations till Sherlock was sobbing with arousal. “Wanna cum now?” He asked, stroking himself with a light hand. He didn’t want to cum…. Yet.
“Oh man, she is in a bad mood,” John said, humoring her, while Sebastian looked mildly offended despite understanding her ire. “Let’s go to my room upstairs,” Sebastian turned towards the stairs without prolonging the conversation when he spotted the innkeeper’s daughter snooping, “We can talk in my room. I got an electric kettle and John got a bag of fine tea and some amazing Indonesian coffee as gifts. We can make you a cuppa!”
She grumbled as she cleaned up later, something about how I could be so stupid as to follow instructions to the last word. But that’s what one must do. Established, proven data and methods must be followed. Then she reveals that my oven is set in Celsius while the recipe gave directions in Fahrenheit. That is totally the problem of the author who wrote that book. I am going to publish an open letter to Nigella Lawson and ask her to smarten up. Directions must be clear and precise.
“Well, well, well, we saw a curious case of ‘loooove at first siiiiight’ today, didn’t we Phillip?” Sally commented jocularly as they sat for dinner at the hotel they were staying in. It was takeaway Chinese and they were all in Greg’s room. Phil had got hold of some beer and it was a nice cozy evening at the comfortable and clean hotel; their favorite country music on, nice food and the company they were used to!
“Sherlock,” Mike said by means of explanation, “He’s quite popular with women. But unlike Molly he is not the most pleasant or friendly person around. He can be quite acerbic, too brutal with his words and sometimes eccentric without limits. Still, Molly adores him and so do several other young residents and a few nurses, even a couple of male members of the administrative staff sort of go all gooey-eyed around him.”
“Better I guess,” John stretched part of his body and pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand, “I just saw the time. I have been asleep almost the whole day.”
“Five for you, four for me,” John panted, his body thumping down on the mattress beside Sherlock, “All in two hours… no, actually three. Gosh, has it been that long already?” He rolled over and checked his watch, “Damn, it’s 10 am. Mrs. Hudson must be impatient and pacing up and down in the hallway outside.”
John was startled on three grounds. The way he had reacted to the sight of a naked Sherlock. How right it felt to start doting on him, rimming him, kissing him. Finally, the most shocking revelation! He had not expected Sherlock to be a virgin. From the way he had come across in the initial two or three days, it was easy for him to assume Sherlock was like any other young, sexually liberated man of the new millennium; happy to take risks and eager to explore. But the gorgeous creature turned out to be a virgin, a precious, untouched virgin who had trusted him to be his ‘first’. While not a prudish bastard, John couldn’t deny the power trip he got on it and how it endeared Sherlock even more to him. The first few knocks on the door of his heart had been subtle, with those nocturnal cuddles and stolen glances, then that kiss! But now Sherlock was pounding on the same door, demanding entry, and John found himself growing more and more helpless by the moment.
“JAWN! OH MY GOD! I almost hit you over the head. What are you trying to do, sneaking into your own bedroom like a thief???!!!”
“Don’t worry,” Molly grinned, “Johnny guide has the full list of things to do and places to visit. Just look at him and that list he has made.”
“We will talk. But first, use the washroom, at least brush your teeth and wash your hands and face, get out of these clothes. I will get you PJs and a clean set of underwear out.”
“Out,” Sherlock yelled, aggressively approaching the man who cowered behind John, “Get out of here before I take your hands off along with those currency notes.”
Sherlock comically choked on his mouthful and had to be thumped on the back and offered some water. He drank a few gulps and rolled his eyes at John, “I am supposed to be the one to say that because your food surely did the trick. I mean, from my stomach to my heart, way to a man’s heart, whatever they call it!” John kissed him lightly on the lips and said, “I mean it. Not a trifling matter. I love you, I always have. The moment I laid my eyes on you, seven weeks and three days ago, I knew I had found the most special person of my life and I’d never let him go.”
Greg said, “Mr. Von Dyke, what really started this curse? We have heard all forms of stories about it. Almost every person in our village talks about it but no one ever knows anything for sure. They all attribute it to ‘I heard from this one or that one or my grandparents’ etc. Have you, by any chance, been close enough to this legend to know where it really stemmed from?”
The two panthers nuzzled and licked at the two blond men and then one went towards Mycroft and nuzzled his legs as Mycroft patted his head. Then, with the speed of lightning, both the beasts ran out of the house and into the darkness of the night.
Sherlock woke up with a jump. He could hear the arrival of the midnight hour, by the sounds of the clock gonging in the other room. Had he dozed off for some time?
“In that case doesn’t it make me weird? Or peculiar as a person? You see, to answer you in a nut-shell I can say only this – I am a scientist and work independently in partnership with my best buddy and neighbor, Jim. I like science, nature, playing the violin. I dislike…..”
Maybe his voice triggered more emotions of rage and vengeance and John lunged at Sherlock. This time Greg whacked him and John got aggressive, aiming a punch back at Greg. Fortunately Jim grabbed his arm and pulled him back.
Sherlock got up and moved back like a torpedo, gasping and groaning as he put too much pressure on his right foot. He left John sitting on the chest in a stupefied position, eyes wide and jaw slack. The beautiful moment had transported him from his dull, drab world to one that had rainbows, purple hearts and rivers of milk, honey and chocolate. Suddenly he was back to the grey planes of the present, apart from Sherlock’s haloed presence in it. He cleared his throat. “What is it Mike?” He called out. The other man, who was somewhere in the bedroom suite but not in the inner sanctum yet, called out loudly, “Are you in there? You had an appointment, remember? You’re already ten minutes late!”
“I promise you Mrs. Hudson. I promise you from the bottom of my heart. I shall always put him first in our relationship.”
He dreamt of some place nice, where everyone was happy and everything was bright and sparkly. An aura of happiness hung around and he saw Sherlock playing the violin while he worked on a wooden ship he was building from scratch. He heard Mrs. Hudson somewhere in the background, chatting merrily, her voice mixing with the violin strains and other ambient noises from Baker Street.
“Yeah?” Mycroft seemed amused, “Mummy, when he stays there you still visit him and bring back his laundry. Eurus cooks over the weekend and sends him packed meals. I have gone over and fixed his kitchen faucet or shower head and dad always drops by to drop some milk and groceries. That is
After using the bathroom he fell on the bed more than lay down on it, everything around him had begun to spin by then. Before he could draw a few relaxing and calming breaths, he was fast asleep.
John took a deep breath and said, “Yes, sure. I think I can organize one more pass for him. But if he doesn’t agree to come along don’t blame me. He’s not really that into people, gatherings and noisy places…..unless it is for a case.”
“We are looking into this Mr. Smallwood,” Greg Lestrade assured him. The body had been put into a bag by then but the three men, Mycroft, Jim and Sherlock, had seen a glimpse of it before that and it was not pretty. “Seems like someone attacked him with a sharp object and repeatedly ripped through his skin, sinew and bones,” Mycroft murmured, “Hit him so hard on the head that the back of the skull is smashed. Part of one hand was severed and somehow landed on the footbridge. This is no ordinary murder, this seems like a psychopath.”
“However, not always do those manips and mixes are done for harmless reasons. I am aware they’re done with malicious intentions as well and sometimes with such accurate methodologies and fabulous touch-ups that one can be truly deceived by the altered photo and think ‘Oh my husband really bedded that woman’ or ‘My God, that lady really is naked in the pool’. But here you see, original pics, they are nothing like they have been portrayed in the altered photos. That woman was in a different room and this man in a different room. That lady in the water is actually wearing a two-piece. Anyways, there are the two photos which were amalgamated, using our systems and software and special effects, to make a single consolidated picture of a couple.”
The third roommate showed him a clean rag, some antiseptic and a bucket of warm water. “I kept these, so you could wash up and clean your wounds.”
“Oh no, no way, that’s not gonna happen. In fact the headache is already going away and pretty much already gone, just hearing about it…. Ohhhh!!”
His smile, usually a naughty, impish one, suddenly seemed a bit shy and something sighed in Sherlock’s heart. “I think I am okay already,” he murmured.
“Yes,” Mycroft, Greg and Sebastian said together. The rest gave a nonverbal answer. All six heads nodded in unison. “Yeah, we are here about that, but how did you guess?” Eurus asked, fairly surprised.
At some point John lost patience. “Alright,” he said in a slightly impatient tone, “I have kept my eyes closed from the inn and right up until here, at least about half a mile. I am opening my eyes now Sherl.” Sherlock immediately objected, “Oh no Jawn, not yet. Trust me it will be a surprise worth it. Come on, walk with me, just a few more steps.”
When Sherlock nodded, John asked him to get him some aspirins and two tall glasses of cold water. He swallowed the pills and spent about half an hour, taking small sips of the cool water until he had drained both glasses. “Get me a powder from the first aid shelf, behind the bathroom mirror,” he said, wiping his lips, “It’s ayurvedic. I had been given that pouch by a good friend of mine but never touched it. Now it’s time!” Sherlock quickly fetched it for him and after swallowing two teaspoonfuls of it, John lay back down and wrapped his arms around Sherlock. In a low murmur he explained what the powder contained and how it acted like a good detoxifying agent.
“So,” Mike Stamford took him aside later as everyone had dispersed and started having tea/coffee and snacks, “I think a certain brown haired, green eyed, debonair young man might be very happy with this ‘present’.”
But he hadn’t been as happy as he should have been. Despite the success, the accolades, his brother in law Roger introducing him to a couple of eligible men, his heart had remained in his hometown, with John. He had seriously missed the man. But life had been busy and he didn’t want to come across as desperate either, hence he hadn’t called John on the hospital lines. Now of course he wanted to meet him the soonest he could.
“Yes. He got out of that only a month ago. After that he’s been locked up in his bedroom. He hasn’t emerged from it, not even for a moment. Even his sister hasn’t been able to get through to him. We are all very afraid he might give up one day. We might have to break in and what we’d discover might not be very pleasing to the eye….. in fact, it could be all over,” Greg paused and shrugged, getting up and walking a few paces towards the window, “Sherlock please, if you’ve been in therapy and he’s attempted to take his own life and then locked himself up in his room for days, shunning company and a normal life…. What do you think that means my friend? You both love each other, enough to almost destroy yourselves when you were driven apart. Then at least try one last time. See if you can get through to him….. Sherlock?”
“There is no reason to go slow either baby boy,” John said as he was helped into his blazer by Sherlock, “As soon as I am back I am calling my lawyer and also Greg Lestrade. We will tear off that contract and release you from it. My husband is not going to be bound to some contract or sign some stupid prenup. As for the properties to be transferred, it is a custom. Remember what my grandmother said to you? Whenever someone marries into the family we always give them their own wealth, so they feel like equals, so they are independently wealthy and can spend without asking for allowances.”
Soon after that Sherlock and John got engaged before a close-knit group of family and friends. John’s sister was a bit shocked that she had not been ‘consulted’ for this but soon she accepted Sherlock in the family and even agreed that her brother couldn’t have found a better match. Sherlock’s parents were quite thrilled with John, especially his dad Reginald Holmes.
Jim walked out, whistling and a chip on his shoulder, not the least bit bothered by the altercation he had just had. He soon disappeared behind the landscaped hedges and stunted trees that were planted around the pool area but his dark presence lingered, especially in Sherlock’s mind. He collapsed on a chair, trembling, and wrapped his arms around himself. Jim was not the sort to issue empty threats. What was he planning? What was he trying to do?
“Says the man who keeps me in the dark on so many things. You’re a sociopath, a high-functioning one but a sociopath nonetheless, in your very own words. Then how do you even care about these things? You take them with a pinch of salt when it’s your turn to be honest.”
It contained three books. A big fat book about the world, with pictures. The second one was for beginner magicians and tricks they could easily learn. The third one was a collection of whodunit stories. Sherlock loved all of them immensely and hugged them to his chest.
“Now come on everyone,” Mycroft said to his assistant Edgar and Greg’s assistant Michael, “We have three square miles to scout and we are only four people. None of us have all day.”
The discourse proved to be quite enlightening and Sherlock was in deep thought when Santa asked, “So what’s the special gift you want this year? All the kids ask but you gave, you fed me, something special must be done for you. Just name it and it shall be yours.”
Sebastian watched him very keenly. His eyes narrowed, as if studying John’s reaction in great detail. Feeling like an insect under an eagle’s gaze, John ran his fingers through his dirty blond hairs and tried to keep his expression and body language as neutral as possible. “After a bit of prodding and probing he told me something I will never forget,” Sebastian suddenly added to his earlier story, “He said love and fondness could exist in different forms and shapes and we could develop these feelings towards multiple people at the same time. But that intimate, romantic, monogamous relationship one craves for, that can only happen with one. Or at least, one at a time. After meeting Jeff he realized Christie, his girlfriend, was a damn good buddy but not someone he really viewed as a wife. Or at least as a potential wife.”
“Vouchers,” John gave an eyeroll, “For a holiday next week, when you’re feeling better. We both deserve a holiday. Scotland, rolling hills and green meadows, a lovely resort in a small picturesque town, next to one of the lakes….sorry, lochs! Maybe we can even spot Nessie.”
There was silence on the other side but he could hear quickened breathing, could almost feel the tension through that silence. Except that….the breathing sounds and tension were not from Janet but the man right next to him. Sherlock was glaring at him and the moment he looked back, the detective got up from his seat and walked towards the toilets. Baffled by the reaction, John decided to call off the date for now. There was always next week.
More than his degrees, experience, his views on advancing methods of surgeries, his knowledge of the human body and emergency measures, they kept saying he would miss the army life and get re-enlisted and therefore wasn’t a horse to bet money on, at least not for the long haul. So annoying.
and somehow that needed to happen. Hook or crook or look. He’d insist and persuade and coax if need be. Persuading was his second nature, thanks to the unique profession he had. He waited for the reply which came a good thirty minutes later. The answer was quite unexpected and rather disappointing when it finally arrived.
“Bathrooms,” John said, “I know the ones used by the staff. They’d be emptier than the ones used by the patrons.”
“So this isn’t just a lunch with a friend then,” she grinned good-naturedly, sipping from her glass of pink lemonade, “Not that I had expected the suave, much-in-demand young man in his thirties to take a much married woman in her fifties out for any romantic reasons.”
“No,” Sherlock refused to be diverted, “I want to know what’s on his mind Roger. Tell me brother mine, why do you feel I am not telling you the truth? You always cock your eyebrow whenever you think I am lying.”
She heard a growl close by, as if someone or ‘something’ was irritated. Then the sounds of it came closer, as did the growling and snarling noises. She turned and tried to run.
“Yes, I can feel something below, they didn’t dig very deep,” Sherlock said as he continued to dig. Jim was taking a breather after the initial digging. He squinted at the sun and said, “Why did they do that? It was just a road accident after all and they saw an animal, right?”
His free hand, which was on top of the covers still, was now….held by Sherlock. No, he was holding Sherlock’s hand too.
“I do have a boyfriend now, by the way. John always encouraged me to start a new life, find a man and have babies with him. I am extremely fond of children, you see! But I was worried about him being alone while he remained worried about me ruining my life. Hahaha, we were two buddies trying to look out for each other and ending up going around in circles. But now, I am relieved. He has you. Someone he deserves is finally with him, for the long haul.”
” Jim said, sounding a little too panicky, “My aunt Daphne gets really cranky if I am late and so does my housekeeper Bess, who also acts as her caregiver. These two women can be really annoying! If I haven’t informed them of my whereabouts or that I am coming home late, they freak out and start calling the whole world and its brother in law. They might even
She nodded and looked at Mike, who quickly took over. “Yes. He could use a bit of help. The comfort and confidence of a home, a friend and a normal and healthy atmosphere where he won’t be constantly reminded of what he has lost.”
“Yes Mr. Watson. For the new John to emerge from the shell, the old John must actually die. The trick is not only to learn new things but also unlearn quite a bit. For the next four weeks, please trust me and hand yourself over to me and my team completely. You can do this if you set your mind to it and agree to pick things up fast. Slow and steady may win some races and Rome wasn’t built in a day, two golden proverbs used by lazy asses who want to put things off till tomorrow. You must learn and learn quickly, sometimes on the fly.”
“He’s living a happy life as the husband of the assistant commissioner of police, Scotland Yard. He doesn’t need a former convict to walk back into his life and remind him of the dark past. His present and future are both bright, so let’s leave it at that.”
Mrs. Hudson was decidedly antagonistic and told me I am a numskull outside of my cases and investigations. So the old bat compartmentalized by intelligence but I dare not revolt or there will be no morning tea, laundered clothes and the occasional biscuits, cakes, scones, sandwiches and milkshakes.
“John, you mean to say you didn’t really recognize him as he walked past you just now?” Mary was smirking and her eyes glittered with mischief, “Damn, he told me he would go unnoticed and slip past me while I had placed a bet saying you’ll find him in a crowd, or in the deepest trench, or atop the highest mountain. There was no way you’d ‘not’ notice him despite the disguise….a very sexy, foxy, tricksy disguise.”
They were lying on the couch in one of the dens, with strict instructions left with the retainers to ‘NOT DISTURB’ them. The door was open, there was no one else in the wing, and all of that combined to give them an additional dose of kink. If anyone dared to break the rules and orders and came anywhere close, they’d hear them, both of them. For once, John was just as noisy as Sherlock, not making any effort to rein in the moans, grunts, yelps, groans and hissing sounds that spilled out in a constant outpour.
“Yep,” Sherlock awkwardly handed it to him, “I wanted to give you something for a long time. But what do you give a man who has everything!”
Oh God, don’t they ever get the message? But Sherlock hated to be rude so he politely smiled, “Yes, we can do that sometimes. But excuse me for now please ladies, I need to rush home because I have a commitment ……” he was interrupted by an incoming call. “One moment,” he said to the sisters, “This is my brother in law. I must take this.” He walked away from them and answered in a quiet voice, “Hello Roger! I am yet to leave the Uni so can I call you once I am in the car? Then we can talk properly.”
John opened the door to their flat and held it open with his foot, picked up a duffel bag in each hand and entered the living room. Something seemed out of place immediately even though the flat seemed surprisingly fresh, airy and clean. There was no foul smell nor any dust, the windows were open and the furniture was mostly in place. Mrs. Hudson was right, she had cleaned regularly and hadn’t noticed anything unusual. But then what……
“Not so much when you know you will be eating those pretty things later,” Anthea said irritably. She was a vegetarian mostly, had eggs and the occasional chicken or tuna and hence didn’t quite enjoy the fare there nor did she find the concept of a marine aquarium in a seafood restaurant interesting. Sherlock gave her a deathly glare and dug back into his food, stabbing the oyster with his fork rather than handling it with his usual finesse and scooping out the saucy meat. Next to him Jim also looked pensive. Both were trying their best to control the beasts within. The closer they came to the no moon night, the dreaded night which coincided with Good Friday, the more difficult it became to control themselves and their instincts.
“Jenny is lost at sea,” John could help but snark and laugh at the same time, wondering what an amazingly peculiar luck he had always had with his dates/lovers, “Sea of humanity. Just disappeared one fine day man! Rachel and I broke up, she wanted a rich doctor, not a military surgeon, even the uniform couldn’t hold her back. She has two kids now.”
In a mere blink of an eyelid John changed his opinion. No, this was not Mycroft being cold and heartless. It was Mycroft being warm and caring. He was just like any husband concerned about their suffering partner and looking for the easiest and fastest way of relief for them. Jim’s condition was not life-threatening or even bordering on it, but ear aches could be nasty, even in adults. Mycroft was suffering because Jim was suffering.
Kayden Goldman listened quietly without emotions, then paused to think. Then he said, “I appreciate your honest feedback. But no, it’s
Second later he felt warmth splatter on his thighs as Sherlock came hard. His epic orgasm followed seconds later. Along with it came a realization that with every round his orgasm was not weakening, it was becoming more and more intense and pleasurable.
“What the hell happened man?” The blond man was stunned, sitting still with his hands still clasping the wheel, “Where did it come from?”
Sherlock was not a conventional good-looker. He was tall, about six feet, but quite willowy instead of the usual gym-toned suppleness and all-muscle avatars men preferred nowadays. He clearly didn’t get much sun because he was pasty white, desperately in need for some Vitamin D. He wore his hairs in unruly waves and curls, which hung thickly around his a-bit-too-long face with angular features and eyes that were a weirdly close-set. Still, there was a magnetic appeal about him and somehow all the oddities added together to create a stunning effect. His eyes were a beautiful blue-green, his lips a delightful bow shape, his cheekbones sharp and pronounced as if someone had sculpted them on his face while his sharp nose was contrastingly large and gave him an intellectual look.
She had an uneasy smile on her face this time. “Okay you got me,” she said finally after a long moment of deliberation, “You’re too clever to not notice something is amiss. But I swear it’s not a bad thing at all. Can I be honest with you?”
For a few seconds it seemed as if Eugenia Holmes was going to protest or argue about that statement, like she had done many times before whenever Sherlock would bring up any references of John. Several times she had soundly rebuked him for not moving on or still being in love with a person who had never even bothered to check on him, but something worked up inside her that afternoon and she seemed surprisingly sympathetic towards him. “I can’t feel your pain son but I do understand it. Unrequited love can be very painful, very upsetting and frustrating. I gotta go now. Need to do some Christmas shopping. The turkey, the salmon, the crabs, stores run out of those items faster than you know. Sort of blink and miss.”
He isn’t even happy to see me after thirty seven days. He is just focused on the loot. Is this the same Jim I fell in love with and who promised to be with me till the very end? Sherlock shook his head, “I-I haven’t any idea, believe me. I didn’t get a chance to ask him about such things…..” But before he could finish, Jim interrupted him and hissed, grabbing him by the collar of his T-shirt. “No silly, no, you
The rest of his skin, exposed to John’s hungry eyes, had flushed a soft pink under the horny gaze of his lover and housemate.
To his surprise, the sleeping Sherlock reached out and grabbed his hand, not letting it go even though John tugged it backwards gently. Finally he gave up resisting and just let it be that way. It felt good to have that handhold over his wrist and after a few moments of deliberation, John slid his hand downwards and threaded their fingers together. That felt even better, more intimate. With a soft, sated sigh he closed his eyes and murmured his name the way Sherlock spoke it. “Jawn.”
In the distance Mary smiled at them, mixing the drinks at Mrs. Hudson’s small but well-stocked bar, serving the guests. “Please,” John muttered under his breath, “I don’t need you to tell me things about her. I know her. No woman in her early thirties is a virgin Sherlock, that’s a fact.”
. But your dad was very particular this belonged to you, all of this belongs to you and always will. Hence I only send her what’s within my rights to do.”
Not that Harry had ever felt isolated before that day. But that day was different, it was ominous in some ways.
“But Jawn I…. ohhh…. Uhhhh….” Sherlock scrunched his eyes shut and his legs curled up as he felt a firm, hot grip on his groin and manhood, massaging and stroking and caressing, until he was so close that a shriek left his mouth and he batted his lover’s hand away.
“Sherlock, why? WHY? As I see it, you have enough and more money of your own. At first I thought you had no income but you seem to have a steady paycheck as a forensic investigator and expert with occasional handy payouts due to your inventions and cases. You even have an inheritance for Christ’s sake. Why would you even need Mycroft’s money?”
“No, not that,” she gently pushed him off and this time he took notice. “What’s the matter with you?” He asked crossly, “Is it something only you and hear and I can’t……” He stopped, eyes widening when even he heard that sound. For a city person like him it was hard to make out what it was. It sounded like footsteps but not that of a human. “What-What is it?” Julia asked, fearfully looked around.
“Ohhhh, so my hunch is true, I am going to die,” the poor man babbled, backing off towards the fire escape staircase. “Why will you die,” John called out, “Hey wait.” Sebastian rushed forward to help the man, “You better take this flight of steps instead of the narrow fire-escape ones.”
, to take a day’s break from the two men who they’d begun to fancy. ‘We won’t meet them or call them today, give ourselves an opportunity to ruminate. If they still seem ‘interesting’ tomorrow and we also find them equally eager as the first day, then we give this a chance’, that was what he had said.
Sherlock assured him nothing like that would happen this time and he had it all under control. He would be back before Christmas, maybe on Christmas Eve.
The three of them hugged each other hard and smiled at one another. Then John winked at Mary and said, “Now off you go my friend, so I can hug my fiancé and future husband properly, without any censorship etc.”
, this was too much. There was nothing for him to wear aside from two Santa Hats and both were labelled, so he knew which one to use.
“Wow,” John stared in astonishment as the car rolled into the driveway. He had never seen a house like this before, he was sure of that. But the next moment he laughed at himself.
“Stop it John,” Irene hissed, “Don’t you see we are doing it for everybody’s good, for the greater good??” She tried to reason with him but he snatched her revolver away, taking advantage of her temporary distracted state. “No, you are interfering you fool, we were about to fix this,” John yelled at her, brandishing both guns now.
. ‘It’s like this every day, any time of the day, I never walk into a room without knocking and calling out nowadays’ was what she muttered before quickly scuttling away. Despite having squirmed and blushed earlier, John felt warmth spread in his chest as he imagined this unlikely couple together. If there was one criminal less in this world and one more genius rescued because of his unconventional choice, then Mycroft deserved the kudos and credit for his bold decision.
“Yeah, very much! I want a black one too, semi-formal, single button casual blazer for regular use. With a purple shirt. You like purple on me.”
Then he realized what that meant. His eyes turned to Mary who was smirking. “I…um…. Mary …I have to….you know, go with him.” She nodded, “I knew it. I knew it the moment I saw him.”
Then he stared at the food with his jaw on the floor. The next moment the phone rang again and he began howling ‘Why me, why me,
John’s eyes narrowed, a lopsided grin on his face as he peered into Sherlock’s face. “They can what? You do know that unmarried priests cannot marry, right?”
“Don’t be so sure. During these moments people reach out to childhood friends, friends from an earlier time, or even an ex they are still on friendly terms with. If we talk to his brother, we will figure out who such friends or an ex might be.” She paused and gave him a quizzical look, “But before we even get there, is there something you wish to share with me? I think you do, don’t you?”
“Oh by the way, Sherlock probably just saved your life,” Mary said in a tone of admiration, “The tree house, which you visit frequently, could have cost you your life or a few broken limbs at least. He tried to climb the ladder and then the rope bridge and detected spots which were so damaged that it wouldn’t have supported the weight of a fully grown man. Even I had no idea that thing needed so many repairs. He even spotted specific areas and told Eckhart to repair them right away.”
Sherlock, Jim, Greg and Sebastian went to meet him shortly before he was to be shifted to the prison facilities. That day John had a big reveal for all of them.
Ultimately Sherlock found his body responding again as John made slow love to him for the better part of half hour. When he was finally allowed to cum, he was knocked out completely for the next hour or so.
Soon he felt his balls beginning to draw up and an intense throbbing start at the base of his spine, his now overheated loins and somewhere in his toes, throat and the back of his head. God, he could hardly breathe and, from the looks of it, Sherlock could hardly stay still.
“Yes I was Sherlock and I am calling you from the ship,” Mary answered, sadness replacing the earlier alarm in her tone, “I am with my partner and we were just having our morning tea at the deck on our level when….. When John called me. He told me…. Wait a moment, don’t you know it yet? Has no one told you the news yet Sherlock?” She sounded quite incredulous and Sherlock felt his stomach drop slightly. “Is this…. Is this about John? He is away on business and-and I don’t see any missed calls from him today…..??” He asked, already getting out of bed.
Greg Lestrade’s totally horrified look was matched by the equally dismayed tone of his voice. Next to him Jim gave a disappointed stare at Mrs. Hudson and said, “He was really quick this time, wasn’t he?”
He heard the door open and close but his usual powers of observation and hearing were a bit off that day since he was totally focused on the ‘human experiment’.
For a few seconds it seemed as if Sherlock was about to throw a sarcastic, cynical comment. ‘You are too rusty Jawn, there’s a way to do this without begging for cases’ or ‘I doubt if it’s truly worth it sifting through 999 idiotic and useless cases to get your hands on one real one’. But Sherlock didn’t seem to say anything, he just sat there thoughtfully, head hanging low towards his chest.
Sebastian did precisely that, he dove between the open legs, pushed them high above and began to tongue fuck Jim. Soon he had the man wailing and thrashing about, eager to cum but only when Sebastian was inside him. This time around Seb maintained some semblance of control over himself and managed to keep rimming the younger man until Jim’s controls slipped and he came all over himself without even a single tough.
, it hurts….” He tried withdrawing his hand again, using the brute force of an adult to pull his hand out. It only resulted in Sherlock going up with the hand trapped in his mouth but he didn’t let go of the hand despite everything. “Murder, someone save me, get this thing off my hand, police, someone, anyone, HELP!” The doctor kept screaming.
“So your John….. Which company does he work for…. Part own? What’s the name of the firm?” He asked enthusiastically.
Sherlock occupied it the moment the chair arrived and even as John tried to get him off it, talk him into giving it up and even issued a threat or two, the thick-skinned young man seemed determined to stay put and refused to budge. He also took over one more item John dearly loved and had been gifted by one of his former military comrades, a gorgeous lamp shade from Chinese Taipei, a full length one which could be placed anywhere on the floor in any room. The beautiful, colorful shade complemented and cedar wood stand and illuminated the entire room end to end in vibrant hues, yet retaining an incandescent and soft glow that soothed the eyes.
His breath was knocked out of him in a whoosh as he saw John standing there, naked. “Who says we need swim trunks?” Asked the naughty priest as Sherlock gasped like a fish out of water. He had stiffened so fast he was in serious danger of cumming in his pants right now. His eyes drank in the sight of John standing there, his skin smooth and unlined and his compact frame packed with muscles. He was athletic, strong and there were a few scars here and there that showed a colorful past that was hardly the stuff ordinary and regular people had. A knife fight, taser mark, even toothmarks. But what was truly remarkable was the size and girth of his cock. Heavy and long, with sizeable balls, he was well hung and uncut, the thatch of light brown pubic hair trimmed neatly.
“Of course you did things personally. I can see it written plain and large on your face Superintendent! Anyways, do you think his…. I mean John’s amnesia case is really genuine?” Jim asked.
A car passed them by and he jumped, “There! That is Sherlock! He is driving away from us. He is in your car!” Clearly dismayed, Phil switched off the engine by mistake without putting the gear into neutral. As a result, the car jumped and jerked like a horse coming to an abrupt halt.
“What no one else seems to be doing,” she said scornfully, annoyed at being stopped and finding these people here, “We need to put them down and if that means we go through you then we go through you.”
Realization dawned on John and he swallowed, his throat had gone dry. How the hell had he not seen this before? How blind and stupidly selfish had he been! Of course Sherlock deserved better. Better than him at least. What was he – an amnesiac with no past and no bearings?
“Start right from the beginning, from the time you left home after our disagreements and fights and the blowup with dad, right up to yesterday when I found you by the highway. I don’t want you to leave anything to imagination or guess, I want every single detail from you. I have more tea brewed, I have breakfast ready, so we can talk while we eat.”
, coursing like wildfire through his veins. His already hard and hot cock jerked between their bodies as John’s belly pressed against it, a trickle of precum sliding down the shaft and getting right on to John’s sensitive skin. His large hands awkwardly grabbed at various parts of John and tugged at his clothes impatiently, making irritable noises because he couldn’t just pull them off in their current position and the passionate clinch they were in.
When the moment arrived and washed over him like a tsunamic wave, John temporarily forgot everything he had learned and known in this world. Clutching at the spasming body of his lover, their souls truly soaring and merging as one entity, their spirits joyous and somewhere up and beyond the clouds, he let himself get carried away by the amazing sensation of cumming inside the man he so loved!
It was huge, just as large as John’s was, and had attached dressing room, spacious walk-in closet, en-suite bathroom and a store room as well! The whole place had the usual trappings of wealth and elegance but what stood out was the quirky décor, like wooden masks and hand shaped vases, and a wall filled with family photographs. Above the wall hung the lady’s photograph and one look at it confirmed what Sherlock had expected all along. She had been the soul of the party and the fizz to the champagne, with her departure this house had begun to lack both a soul and a fizz, the electric presence of someone who could hold it all together in spirit, not just the basics.
But once the girls left, both Sebastian and John felt awful. They sat in their hotel room, pensive and sad, thinking about how their experiences here at Beckett and New Beckett had been so mixed and puzzling. On the one hand it was a place that had brought love and enormous happiness. On the other hand this very place had shown them a cruel side of fate. Agatha’s death had also affected them deeply, making them wonder about the fragility of life. “We should have gone with them,” Sebastian murmured as he lay on the bed, eyes on the sloped ceiling of his room.” “I know but I can’t just leave Sherlock overnight, I need a few days. Even he must be very upset about these incidents,” John added.
“You must know your table manners, at least the basic ones. Know the cutlery, utensils, which one to use and when, how to sip your champagne or the sparkling rose. It’s useful to know how to use chopsticks as well. Might be useful while dining at Asian restaurants. Recognize your cheeses and wines and cuts of meat. Now, you may never be ready to dine with the queen, but I can assure you that you will be the one people would look to before they choose the fork for the next course.”
“Nope, it’s not your health or disease-free status that’s holding me back…. I want you to be comfortable first. Be familiar, be okay with the person that I am.”
“It doesn’t come to him naturally either,” she sighed, “Alright. Give it time. Maybe things will sort themselves out. But do drop a few subtle hints.”
Tried to garner support from mummy and daddy. Daddy said ‘Mummy knows best, whatever she says is right otherwise I will be in your position son.’ Mummy said I had made a serious mistake calling John a typical wife. Went to Mycroft, had little hopes he would support me and I was proved right when he proudly announced that ever since he married George Lestrade he has learned never to contest roles and responsibilities in the house.
“I have no idea to be honest,” John confessed, giving him a sheepish smile and scratching behind his right ear, “Though I am immensely grateful you made those exceptions.”
“The sea coast is only three hours away,” Sherlock said, “They also have huge marine fish tanks. They stock these lobsters and crabs in one tank and the white flesh fish, the salmons and groupers and halibuts in another massive one. You can actually go and see them, they show those tanks on request. It’s a beautiful sight.”
Pierre was equally stunned to see him back so soon. “N-No, I got accommodation…. I was just leaving now.”
“Oh – sure,” John says, surprised to be allowed in on this. He crosses to the coffee maker. “Let’s hear it.”
Harry rolls her eyes at him, likely at his abruptness. “I think the accepted response is ‘good morning’, but what do I know.”
“I remember having promised you that I would, back at Mary’s flat,” John says. “I’m – I’m going to do better. I promise.”
John can’t breathe. Only now, unlike earlier, it’s because he’s so filled with emotion that he’s genuinely afraid that it will all come out in a sob when he exhales. His heart is beating so loudly he’s sure the people sitting on either side of him can hear it. He can’t look at Sherlock, either. His fingers are shaking but he looks down at the screen of his phone and types back,
in Sherlock’s eyes – John exhales hard and comes, spurting three, no four times over his fist. What was that look? he wonders, breathing hard and letting the water run down over his head and face and chest and still-twitching cock. It’s not as though Sherlock will ever explain it to him, let him in on whatever mysterious process is going through his head this time. He just doesn’t process stuff like other people, and apparently John is never to be privy to whatever it is he’s thinking.
“There you are,” Sherlock tells them. “So: whoever this is will be looking for a six-year-old next. Get looking!”
The bathroom door opens a few minutes later. There are footsteps and then John stops behind him. “Hey,” he says, his voice low. “You okay?”
We stop when the kettle starts whistling, and laughingly separate to put our clothes back on and set about making and drinking our tea. Sherlock gets out his laptop, pulls up several menus, then turns the computer to me and tells me to make a choice. I look at him surreptitiously over the top of the screen, thinking yet again how I can’t see myself ever not wanting this. By now, almost everything has been said in terms of the silence being broken, the secrets being shared. Not all of it, but nearly.
John waves this off with a forkful of pasta shells. “Go ahead. I clearly need all the help I can get in figuring this out.”
John talks him through the rest of it, explaining the knotting, and they agree to try for six sutures in total. By the end of John’s explanation, Sherlock feels white around the eyes with stress, himself. John reaches for his coat sleeve again. “You can do this,” he repeats, his eyes full of something that makes Sherlock’s chest ache to see. “I told you: I trust you. To the end of the world and back, Sherlock.”
“Wasn’t going to,” Sherlock says, and that’s good: his voice comes out perfectly naturally. He does steal a look at John in them again, though. He can’t help it. The glasses just render John ten times more appealing than he was before, particularly when he’s reading something and concentrating intelligently. He clears his throat. “So, what’s next, doctor?”
Saying yes to this feels too direct, so John sidesteps it. “Date,” he says instead. “I mean, I’ve never seen you do it – unless you count fake-dating Janine for the Magnussen case, but I mean for real. Do you just – never do that, at all?”
“It’s been a nice day,” Sherlock comment, that same, careful lightness in his voice. He picks up his wineglass and swirls the last swallow around in it.
A silence rich in expectation, contemplation, and a sort of peace that John has very rarely experienced before settles in the long nave of King’s College Chapel. The priest rises and begins to speak, the words of the liturgy for Evensong ancient and well-worn in his mouth, and John instantly understands the inherent appeal of the service. He half-listens, more interested in the way Sherlock’s fingers are intertwined with his, seated in what they think are the chair Sherlock was sitting in last night and the one to its right. His service booklet is on his knees, untouched. He doesn’t need it. It’s enough just to be here with Sherlock, at long last. It’s half-past five, and outside the daylight is already fading, the day giving over to night: the perfect time for Evensong.
John squints at the water. “Technically, I think we’re now in Durham, actually.” He nods toward the coastline. “Shall we?”
John strokes his thumb over the sharp line of Sherlock’s cheekbone. “I actually spent some time wondering which of us was getting the worse deal,” he admits. He hesitates, but he’s got to ask. “Does he know about the coachings?”
There’s a pause between dinner and dessert, and someone goes to the microphone and begins talking about this and that. John isn’t really listening. Both the wine and the kiss have warmed his cheeks, and holding Sherlock’s hand isn’t anywhere near enough contact to satisfy him at the moment. Sherlock leans forward, letting go of his hand, so John follows him, casually putting an arm around his back and leaning into him. Sherlock doesn’t respond overtly, but he doesn’t stiffen or pull away, and John thinks he catches the merest hint of a smile lurking at the corners of Sherlock’s mouth (
“I thought we deserved it,” he says quietly. “It’s taken us so long. I thought we deserved at least a weekend. You know: to get ourselves – established, as it were.”
“We’ll be better now,” John says, looking back over his shoulder from the ladder he’s standing on, painting close to the ceiling. “In a way, we’ve been making the same mistake from the very start. Now that we both know that we want this, we won’t misunderstand each other so badly. Plus the Mary complication is done, so there’s nothing in our way now.”
After a bit, John pulls off, almost breathless. He puts a hand on Sherlock’s face, trying to gather his thoughts into actual words. He’s already halfway hard and suspects that Sherlock might be, too, and he wants so much to get this right at last. “Let’s – I want to do this properly,” he says, looking from one of Sherlock’s beautiful eyes to the other. “I want to get this right. More than I can even say.”
He stops, heat suffusing his face, his entire frame rigid with anger. Mycroft has been listening impassively. “You’ve worked yourself into a complete state, brother m – ” he begins, but Sherlock cuts him off.
Molly comes to the door and opens it. “Sherlock,” she says, with a confused smile. “What are you doing out here? You could have just come in.”
They’re facing the Plaza Hotel and Sherlock turns to him. “I went ahead and booked us a room here,” he confesses. “Thinking about it, I didn’t really want to go back to our hotel. I hired Aston to pack up our things and have them sent over. Do you mind?”
It takes every ounce of strength he possesses, but somehow John manages not to laugh at this. No point upsetting Sherlock still further by pointing out that he’s already aware that he’s turned on at the moment. He clears his throat. “Okay, then… do you want to sit down?”
Sherlock hears himself make a rather interested sound in response. “What’s the current status of breakfast?”
Todd moves on to Andrew and Avi at last, and Sherlock gets lost in his own, private musings and doesn’t pay them any attention whatsoever.
Mary sighs, then raises her voice so that John will hear it clearly and says, “So, I meant to show you the latest test results when you asked earlier but I left them in the bedroom. Come and have a quick look. The stew can wait.”
He cleans himself up, too, then dries his hands, switches off the light, and goes stealthily back into the bedroom. Sherlock is still sound asleep, though he’s turned onto his back now. John creeps around to his side of the bed, lifts the covers, and gets in. He slides over to Sherlock and stretches out an arm across his chest. What he’d really like is to press himself all the way up against Sherlock’s side, including his gently aching, spent cock, get Sherlock to turn toward him and put both arms around him in turn, but it’s not like that. He’s just there to maintain a steady contact and prevent the nightmares from returning if his presence can possibly do that. His eyes drift closed. It’s fine. It’s all fine.
He doesn’t say anything to hurry John out, but the warmth of his smile somehow gives him the boost he needed. John cracks open the door and peeks into the corridor. The coast is clear, so he slips out and begins walking toward his own room, taking care to assume a casual walking speed.
Ella, meanwhile, has been jotting some of this down. “I see,” she says now. She turns a page in the notebook so that neither of them will read it, and turns her attention to Sherlock. “You’ve been quiet,” she observes. “How do you feel about what John has said so far?”
Sherlock wonders if any of these things are detailed reasons why they simply cannot go on being friends. But he inhales slowly, squashing down the turmoil in his gut, and nods. “Okay,” he says.
“You will,” Sherlock promises. “Come on. The paramedics are here, see the ambulance outside, there? And that American doctor was so quick with the antidote. She only took a sip or two. We’ll see.”
“Okay.” Sherlock agrees, butterflies swooping in his gut, already anticipating John’s return and their next embrace without a one-year-old between them. He thinks of the implication of John putting Rosie down for the night and shivers: John means to stay over again, then. Likely not on the sofa this time, either. He gets up, wanting to stretch his limbs after the long sit, and also suddenly nervous. Or – not nervous, precisely, but the anticipation is making him jittery. If John intends… that, then it will be incredibly important to get it right, and he is singularly ill-equipped to prepare himself adequately for the task, mentally speaking. Physically, he’s already begun to respond, visibly so. His body knows what it wants, but not necessarily what to do should he manage to obtain it at last. Nevertheless, he finds himself yearning for John’s mouth again, for his dizzying proximity. His heart is racing. He wants this very much, nerves notwithstanding. He stretches out his fingers and shakes them and wonders if there are steps of preparation which he should be undertaking in the very possible event of whatever may come with John staying over. He paces around the sitting room until he hears John start back down the stairs.
He tosses the flannel away in favour of pulling Sherlock back into his arms, their mouths coming together jointly, as though they’ve been doing this for years already. And maybe that’s because they should have been, John thinks fiercely. Meanwhile, the weight of everything that’s happened, the lack of sleep, the rush and stress of finding Mary in that terrible village is mixing with the intense relaxation of his muscles following two orgasms. Feeling completely secure in Sherlock’s arms, John finally lets himself relax all the way, only realising now how much tension he was still holding onto. As soon as he decides to let go of it, a wave of sleep washes over him. John gives in to it at last, letting it sweep him out to sea like the tide. Sherlock is here. They’re together. Everything is going to be okay now.
Sherlock repositions himself so that he’s all the way onto the bed, the bedding shoved aside in John’s hasty exit. “If you really did want to shower and get ready… we don’t have to…” he begins, trailing off.
John wonders if he’s done something to make Sherlock angry, yet again. God, he’s shit at this. He searches his brain for something to say, but can’t seem to come up with anything.
His face is flushing, though he determinedly finishes the sentence, and John feels his own face heat, just thinking of Sherlock sitting on Corey Graham’s rented sofa, his cock sticking out and nothing else. He swallows some of the saliva that’s gathering in his mouth, and suddenly thinks he’s got an inkling of where this conversation may be headed. “Right,” he says. “So… are you saying that you want to… er, practise being naked with someone?”
She nods and looks down at the daisies, then across at him. “We are friends,” she says simply. Then she nods toward the door. “Now for God’s sake, go home and plan your honeymoon!”
I turn it over in my hands, not wanting to believe it. “It could be a coincidence,” I begin, but it’s weak. It could be, but it rarely is, not when there’s a double homicide to consider.
Molly stares into Mary’s blue eyes. What could Mary have possibly done that would rival what she knows about Molly? “What?” she asks. “You know I won’t tell anyone.”
John understands at once. “Right, I guess they don’t want the tabloids printing them. So what are we supposed to do about it?”
“No. I will,” Sherlock decides, stepping out of his shoes and coming to collect the teapot, his coat still on.
John shakes his head. “Even if that were fully true – and I’m still working on that – it doesn’t excuse the things I said. And did.” He watches Sherlock, sees him swallow, his features otherwise unmoving. “My letter,” he adds, wincing internally. “I didn’t mean a word of that, you know. You’ve never failed me. Mary failed me. Over and over again. You’ve never – you’ve done the opposite. I know that. Just in case you thought I didn’t. I do know that.”
“It’s not a trick question,” Margaret assures him. “I’m asking because the questions people ask me are often the questions they’re asking themselves. What’s the real question behind that one?”
John appears to be trying to organise his thoughts into words, despite the long stretch of silence preceding this. Or perhaps he’s just feeling apprehensive, himself. “So, you just – never, then. With anyone else.”
Molly is still beet-red, but she doesn’t want to seem stuffy, either. (Is this how most women carry on with their female friends? If so, she missed the memo!) She doesn’t say anything and Mary comes round and sits down on the end of the sofa, facing her. “Sorry,” Molly says, still completely flustered. “I’m just not – ”
The voice surprises him from behind; he hadn’t even heard the doors open. Sherlock turns suddenly and finds Paul right behind him, too close. He grits his teeth and suppresses the urge to take a large step backward. “Good morning,” he says, his pulse racing. “You startled me.”
That night was the last time I saw her, though. She disappeared after that. It was as though once I’d openly confessed the affair-that-wasn’t-quite, that pretend version of her faded away. The truth was out. I knew it wasn’t her. I knew all along that it was just – myself, just some fucked up projection of my own thoughts onto a person I simply wanted to believe was a better person than she was, because accepting that she was what she really was would have meant acknowledging the incredible depth and enormity of
The eye contact is intense. John shakes his head. “I can’t possibly know that,” he says, as gently as he can. “Only you can know how you feel. I’ve told you what I do know: that recovery from trauma doesn’t go in a straight line. That there are always going to be good days and bad days, progress and setbacks… I can’t know in advance that this case wouldn’t be something that could trigger something and set your recovery back. I also can’t know that it wouldn’t be – I don’t know, affirming in some way, that you wouldn’t get there, find that you still love the work and that it actually helps you get back on your feet. I don’t know. I don’t think you can deduce this one logically. What does your gut instinct say?”
John clears his throat again, then nods. “Yeah. About that – I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. And definitely not the way I said it, either. But you’re right, of course. Obviously that’s why none of my relationships worked. Hard to make yourself fall in love with one person when you’re trying desperately not to be in love with someone else.”
Unfortunately, it seems to have rendered their once-scintillating friendship rather dull. Sherlock suppresses a sigh and pushes away his plate. “More wine?” he offers.
Sherlock turns to face him. “Do you want to go back in there?” he asks, very directly. “If you’d rather not, I would understand.”
Lestrade brushes this off. “There are at least six bedrooms, some with multiple beds. We’ll all have somewhere to sleep. We can sort it later. Meanwhile, everyone come and get a map of the local area. I want you in teams. Donovan, you can take Daryl and head to the south ridge, here. Parkins, you and I will cover the area to the east. Sherlock and John, I want you to head to this area in the north. That’s the suspect’s exit route, so if we don’t get him first, you will. Mobile reception’s going to be spotty so I’ve got radios. We’re going to do this old school. I also hope you’ve brought your wellies like I said; it could get muddy out there. We’ve got some air support but they won’t come in until we’ve got a better idea of where Rutherford is headed.”
He turns around to lean back against the counter, his arms half-crossed over his chest, holding his coffee. Sherlock’s lips tighten a little and he looks down, but all he says is, “I thought we’d interview Phil again. Ideally with her there, in the background. We can ask a question or two, but make it sound like we’ve hit a dead end and are just planning to give up and spend the rest of our time here strictly as conference attendees.” He glances up at John to gauge his reaction.
“I thought it was a fair question,” Sherlock says stiffly, just over his shoulder. “I fail to understand why heterosexual men so frequently ‘joke’ about losing their liberty and all joy in life at the prospect of marriage. It’s inherently misogynistic.”
There is no answer. Molly waits a bit, then rings again. “Don’t worry,” she tells Rosie, though it’s as much to herself as to the child. “I’m sure he’s coming.” She shifts Rosie’s weight and Rosie makes a loud sound of protest.
Sherlock listens to him shamelessly, then glances down at his own erection, pushing visibly up from beneath the covers. Practically everything John does is a stimulus at this point, but anticipation has to account for over fifty percent of it in this particular instance.
Sherlock shrugs. “All right,” he says, not particularly caring. What does it matter about sausages when John is leaving for Christmas and won’t even find the basic decency to tell him? “Whatever you like.”
, I’m sorry!” It comes out too loudly, but he can’t help it. “I shouldn’t have said that – I don’t even know why I did! I don’t – think of you like that, of – whatever that implied.” He’s not even making sense, but it doesn’t matter. “I’m – it’s just me, my stupid jealousy – I don’t think you’ve – no, that’s not right. Let me try again: it doesn’t matter to me who you’ve been with before. It doesn’t matter one bit, and I’m furious with myself for having said that tactless shit. Especially when I’m always so hard on
That makes him frown, though. “John… you know I don’t – ” He stops, those long fingers gripping his hip.
good – what Sherlock is doing is exquisite, his curly head bobbing along John’s length like he’s done it thousands of times before, knowing exactly what John likes, how fast and how tight to keep his lips, his tongue cupping around him from below in a way that’s positively ungodly. He can hear himself panting, both hands in Sherlock’s hair now, trying not to grip or steer or thrust into his mouth. He doesn’t even need to – Sherlock is taking him unstoppably into ecstasy. His hands are busy, too, one wrapped around John’s cock, the other travelling over his arse and hip and thigh. John feels a telltale shiver of pleasure like quicksilver right at the base of his balls and has the wit to stammer out a warning – “Sh – I’m – I’m going to – ”
“Deal,” John says, happiness welling in his chest like lava. “I was going to suggest exactly that. But first, lunch and Manhattan. There’s a whole city waiting for us out there.”
Vee had relented then, feeling a bit badly for taking out her wrath on him. She’d patted his arm. “I never thought it, either, my love.” And she hadn’t. Mary must have charmed her, too, loath as she is to admit it to herself.
It’s nothing luxurious, not that John cares in the slightest. The only thing occupying his attention is the fact that there is very definitely only one bed. Well: that certainly clears some things up, as far as what Sherlock is thinking about this, he thinks.
I grin back, my eyes on the buttons of his shirt as my fingers undo them as quickly as I’m able. “Take your trousers off,” I demand, and he complies immediately, then steps out of his underwear and takes me by the wrist to tug me down the corridor to his bedroom. I don’t know what we’re doing, but it doesn’t matter – I just want to be with him again, any way we possibly can. We get the bedroom door shut and tumble into the bed together, wrestling the blankets over us and slotting our bodies together any way we can, pressing and rubbing together shamelessly, breath hot between us as we kiss. I let myself get a bit too carried away and find myself on top of him, my cock hard as rock against his. On one thrust I pull back a bit too far and suddenly my cock is right there between his cheeks, his balls resting on top warmly on top of it.
Todd raises a finger. “Sometimes these things clarify themselves later, or only when someone asks,” he says. “How do you feel, Andrew? Have you always wanted to be a parent?”
“Easy now,” I soothe, as though trying to calm a wild horse. “I’ve got you. I’ve got you.” I pull him backward and onto my lap in one of the plastic chairs, and get an eyeful of his cock, still flushed bright and partly hard, pearly drops still welling up from the slit. The sight fills my mouth with saliva and I know I’ve got to get my mouth on him at the earliest possible opportunity. “God, you’re gorgeous,” I whisper, nudging my nose in behind his ear and stroking my lubed-up palms up under his shirt, needing to touch his bare skin. Don’t want to get lube stains on his beautiful shirt, either.
“I said, was there a body found?” Sherlock repeats. “Any time shortly before or after the parachute washed up?”
. He’s trying to stop beating himself up, mostly for Sherlock’s sake. He wants to be able to let it go so that they can both move on. He knows that it’s him holding them both back and that feels awful, too. So John does his best to reach out, do small things, gauge Sherlock’s reactions with as much attention as Sherlock pays to him to figure out what he likes, what he wants. Every good interaction between them is another step forward, he tells himself.
“Quite new,” Sherlock adds. He looks slightly defensive and I cringe inwardly, thinking that this was hardly the ideal way to first introduce our brand-new relationship to the world. Even if it’s only Mrs Hudson. We might have kissed in public once or twice, but it’s very different being caught in the act by someone who actually knows us. Sherlock gestures at the stove. “We were just – making breakfast.”
Reassured, Sherlock makes a hummed sound of deep contentment and bends his head to kiss John’s throat, allowing him to pant and moan freely. John can feel how quickly Sherlock’s heart is beating, too, his pulse thudding through his skin, his cock wet where it’s pushing against John’s hip.
“It’s – that’s – that feels amazing,” John stutters out, actively preventing himself from pushing into Sherlock’s mouth, demanding more. He grasps at the sheets with all ten fingers and holds on hard.
Andrea smiles, and it strikes him again that she’s quite beautiful, in a cold sort of way. The façade is difficult for her – she’s obviously a straightforward person, unlike Mary, who knew how to play just about any part without a hint of struggle, or any conflict regarding her own past. Andrea has to work at it. She was probably a fairly decent person before the life event that caused her to make the choice to become a serial killer. Now he hears an echo of Sherlock again, as he makes himself walk at a firm, but moderate pace out of the dining hall, not liking the thought of having Andrea at his back:
Something about his face is so… he doesn’t know how to describe it, but the suppressed mirth, the mischief hovering around the corners of his mouth does something to John. He feels suddenly engulfed with affection for Sherlock out of nowhere and swallows it down hard. “So I see,” he says, and his voice comes out sounding normal. (Good.) “I suppose I’ll have to go and explore. Though you’ll probably tell me that I’ve put on weight again by the end of the week.”
“I thought maybe you could provide a diversion of some sort.” Sherlock tips his face up to look at him. “Find some reason to talk to Steven Larson, or something along those lines. It will depend on what things look like when the time comes. I know there are plenty of other conference staff to avoid besides Larson, but he’s the real danger. Or perhaps some sort of scene at the front desk. I’ll text you when I’ve got a clearer idea.”
John processes this, his eyes still on Sherlock’s face. “Why would she have come back here?” he asks, feeling bewildered. “I mean – she would have known better than anyone what it had become. I don’t get it.”
“Shit, I’m sorry,” John says, full of self-recrimination. He clears his throat again and tries to force the words out. “Look, you know what crap I am at this stuff, and I don’t know what to say that would ever be enough to say it all, but I’ve got to start somewhere. I’m sorry, Sherlock. So sorry. For all of it. For it taking so long. For not seeing it sooner. For going back to Mary. My awful letter. For blaming you. For all of it.”
Before she can get fully wound up into her usual rant on the subject of the many inadequacies of the National Rail, Sherlock answers her question. “Well, you see, I was planning to come up with John and his daughter, since you did invite them. Right now his sister’s got Rosie, and I’m not sure what time they’re bringing her back, or if he’ll want to spend the night. I’m sure he won’t be strongly opposed, but everything is complicated when a small child is involved. I’ll just need to discuss it with him. That’s all.”
John glances at Sherlock, then goes on. “It’s an extremely tempting solution,” he says slowly. “Rosie is practically Sherlock’s daughter at this point, too, however, and I think we should talk it over at length before we come to any major decisions. It’s a lot to think about. But I like what you said about it not meaning us giving her away permanently, about being in her life regularly, but letting that life have its base out here… yeah. I’m strongly tempted to agree with you that that would be the best thing for her. The thing is…” He squeezes Sherlock’s hand under the table again and goes on. “Our relationship is very new and very exciting for us,” he tells them candidly. “As Mrs Hudson keeps saying, we’re in our honeymoon phase, and having some time to ourselves would be really wonderful, just to establish our relationship and let our bond develop. I think that would be an important base for any child to have, whether she’s living with us full-time or not. I just need to make sure that we neither decide to keep Rosie with us because we would miss her too much if she came to live with you, nor that we have Rosie live with you because it would be more convenient for us. It has to be what’s best for her. I do think you may well be right that having a quieter life with her own grandparents, or the next closest thing, would probably be the most ideal solution there is. Mrs Hudson isn’t that young anymore, and she has a life of her own, besides. The two of you are stable, retired, established, in a healthy, loving relationship as far as I can tell, and even related to her. And I like the thought of not giving her up entirely.”
Sherlock shakes his head a little. “I promised I would never leave you,” he reminds John. “I thought you might be disoriented, considering how much has happened. And – I wanted you to remember what happened with – this.” His face comes closer and his touches his mouth to John’s. “Us.”
Sherlock blinks several times and swallows again, clearly trying to hide how upset he is. “Okay,” he says, and it comes out slightly ragged.
“Sherlock,” John says from the bed, very quietly, but Mycroft hears it and treats Sherlock to one of his more poisonous looks.
Then imagine how I feel Sebby? Oh, did I just address him in my mind as Sebby? What is he now, my boyfriend?
“Oh you have a problem if I stay quiet, you have an issue if I talk, then suddenly I am talking too fucking much,” Sherlock gave it back with equal annoyance and irritation in his tone, “Did I ever ask you for anything other than….being there for me, being the only friend I have. Remember Dartmoor, where I told you I don’t have many friends, I have only one…..and-and I am aware I am not an easy man to live with but I try….I do try, I have changed and I can change….but what sort of friendship do we share if you keep things from me. She is someone you’re serious about and I am just…..clueless about it. I hate being in the dark.”
Jim looked squarely at Mycroft, shifted his glance over to the DI, then spoke in a wicked tone. His chocolate brown eyes glowed with mischief, “Says the one who can’t keep it in his pants even during the so-called dinner get-together? Look here Detective Inspector Lestrade, if you criticize me and my choice of jokes and references then I shall let your in-laws and Mycroft the Iceman’s parents, who have just arrived and are on their way up now, know that you happened to be kissing their son’s pee-pee in the bathroom five minutes ago.”
As soon as Greg and his party were gone, Jim jumped on Mycroft and dragged him into their car. It was a huge SUV that Mycroft drove, a Land Rover Discovery Sport, and when the front seats were flattened it more or less became a bed. “Oh fuck,” Mycroft moaned when Jim grabbed his through his pants, “We are still at the parking lot of the pub Jimmy!”
“Yes. He has divorced his first wife and taken on a second. The first one took him to the cleaners and the second one has accumulated debts. He also has illegitimate kids, two from former mistresses plus three from the previous marriage. Then this new, young wife has a child from an earlier relationship that he’s adopted. In ten years his life has changed completely. He is no longer the carefree and cheerful bachelor he used to be when he joined us at twenty-eight. He is broke, steeped in debt and alcoholic.”
Greg looked at the open door of the house and the broken window of the kitchen and exclaimed, “The storm has arrived. We must close the door at least, try and board up the kitchen as well Myc. Irene, help him.”
John did a facepalm. Of course. He had indeed made it sound like a relationship. Common friend, tolerate each other, space, the rent….oh well, wrong reason given, the rent wasn’t high.
“He is a man in his nineties but, as people say, still going very strong and walks three miles a day. Lives with his granddaughter and her family and his younger sister at the Ignatius village, where we were headed. He was a resident here but after his wife died ten years ago, moved to the neighboring village. His son and daughter both live in Manchester, they work there. But the granddaughter and her husband are grocers and love the peaceful, country life.”
Mary didn’t say anything, though it was pretty clear from her startled look that she had seen through his lie. John booked a cab for her and escorted her to it, saying he would call her shortly. He didn’t notice her eyes on him as he hurried towards the Harrods parking, to take his rented Range Rover out. She hoped he would turn and give her a look and wave as she passed by but he never did.
“Rather you be disappointed now and realize the truth sooner than live blindsided and regret it much later when you finally come to grips with the truth,” the older man pleaded, “I know something about the curse of these parts and I have seen the very manifestation of that in someone I had once adored and even contemplated marriage on. Yes, my fiancée Stella, she is the one. She was struck by the curse and she didn’t die by suicide because she was mentally ill. She did that to herself to stop her own macabre ways, she did that to stop the curse from passing on to anyone. Unfortunately it did pass on, maybe in some other way, and it’s your brothers who are now bearers of that curse. Please, you gotta believe me.”
“Oh God, don’t tell me you guys have broken up. Even if so, please don’t leave us, don’t move somewhere else. I have become quite attached to you and Sherlock needs you around, you both are
“Ouch,” she giggled, “Why are we so quick to label and judge? You don’t need to do either, my friend. Let the feelings flow over you, guide you in the right direction, and don’t call anything ‘impossible’ unless you have explored it fully. Mind you, I am not asking you to jump into bed with a man just to see if it works, but I am also not asking you to consistently brand that attraction is just rubbish.”
Sherlock stood up, angry and upset at the insensitive behavior. “Either you stop this conversation completely or you change the topic. The third option is that I leave the room or you do. But I don’t want to know about John, talk about him or discuss anything about him.”
The gate was open but the moment he entered through it a sentinel sprang out from nowhere and stopped him. John stated his name and the resident he was paying a visit to. A call was made, a camera was turned on, his image was captured and sent and finally he was allowed in.
That night, as Mycroft and Roger cuddled in bed with pizza and watched movies while kissing and touching and making love every one to two hours, Sherlock watched them a few times through the keyhole. He had been given his pizza and coca cola and ordered to remain within the confines of his room but Sherlock wasn’t one to listen to such orders. The more someone tried to restrict him, the more he rebelled and went in the exact opposite direction. Mycroft had no clue that his brother knew.
“That was ten years ago,” Jeremy Moriarty began, “Reggie and I had taken the boys to the Hope Hill for a picnic. There they were chased by a strange creature that seemed too big for a panther and too small to be a lion or a tiger. Strangely enough, its roar was different from any other animals we had see in a zoo or safari. Fortunately Reggie had a double barrel shotgun with him to shoot a few birds and I had an air-gun, using which I wanted to teach the two teenagers how to be crack-shots.”
They’re relaxing after a late-ish lunch the next day when Sherlock picks up his phone and sends a text. The response comes a few minutes later, and Sherlock types back. After several more exchanges, he puts the phone down, smiling to himself.
“You seemed like you were having a good time,” John says, still feeling tetchy. It comes out a bit more accusatory than he intended.
Sherlock smiles and turns from the counter. “That’s because I made bacon,” he says, and John grins, drops his two bags of shopping on the table and comes over to kiss him for several long, very good minutes. Sherlock doesn’t stint himself, doesn’t make any effort whatsoever to bring it to an end any earlier than it needs to, and reminds himself that this is fine. This is perfectly allowed. They both need the reminder, he thinks again, relishing the feel of John’s fingers in his hair.
“But not like your last post-honeymoon phase, I hope,” Sherlock says dryly, and John laughs and shakes his head.
That gets him two very arched eyebrows. “Is it, then,” Mrs Hudson says. “Good. I’ll hold you to that, young man. Now go on and take John somewhere nice.”
When they get inside the flat, John finally speaks, pulling off his coat. “I’m half-asleep,” he says. “How are you feeling?”
to falsify my own suicide in front of you? And then live on the run for two years? And what would you call standing by and watching you marry someone else, when I – ” Sherlock stops, aghast at his own words.
“Anyway, the good news is that while we each have a few slightly corrupted memories, the overall consensus seems to be that there was no other long-term damage,” Sherlock says, helping himself to more of the salad.
“Right. Yeah.” John closes his laptop, so whatever he was looking at doesn’t seem to be that pressing, to Sherlock’s private satisfaction. He sets the computer aside and gets to his feet. “What are we making?”
Mrs Hudson has assigned herself the small task of feeding Rosie puréed chicken casserole from a jar. She shakes her head. “I’ll never forgive myself. When I came to and realised she was gone – ” Her voice quavers. “I can never go through that again.”
And it’s left him space, too, space to sort himself out after Mary’s death, the trauma that Eurus Holmes inflicted on everyone she came into contact with, and to wrestle his own demons back into control, work on fixing his friendship with Sherlock, and generally get back into some sort of life. They had all the big talks back in January, one long Saturday of endless-seeming apologies, mostly on his part, and it’s all water under the bridge now. They took a bit of time off from crime-solving, mostly to rebuild Baker Street. Mrs Hudson went to stay with her sister in Cornwall for a month while the contractors were working. John and Sherlock did a lot of the small stuff themselves – repapering the walls, repainting what needed repainting, spackling up the holes and rehanging the artwork, feeding themselves on takeaway until the wiring was fixed. Somewhere in there, John started sleeping over again, just because the trek back to Mary’s flat was so long, and besides, the flat was haunted with clouded memories of his life there, the life he never really wanted in the first place. Finally they came to the end of the renovations and Sherlock asked him, his voice a bit distant, when he was just going to bring the rest of his things and move in properly.
Sherlock nods, so John feels around until his hand comes across the lube, and he gives it to Sherlock in silent accession to this. Sherlock accepts it from him, swiftly gets some of it out and tosses the tube aside. He moves up higher, so that his face is next to John’s now, his fingers still loosely cradling John’s balls. “I want to see you,” he says, like he did last night, his expression sombre.
Sherlock is just pulling on a worn t-shirt over his pyjama pants and John stops short. They both attempt to speak at the same time, John flustered, but Sherlock hastens to reassure him. “It’s – fine,” he says hurriedly, then moves swiftly past John to take his turn in the loo.
Sometime later, he makes himself break off the kiss. Sherlock is warm in his arms, but the night around them is growing cold. “Let’s go inside,” he murmurs, brushing snow out of Sherlock’s curls with his bare hands. “I want a do-over on last night.”
Sherlock’s long fingers are on his balls, his forearm subtly nudging John’s thigh up higher and out of the way, and John reminds himself to keep trusting, and shifts closer to allow Sherlock easier access, still touching him in turn. It feels good, the way Sherlock is pressing into the bit just behind, and then his middle finger slips a little further back. “If you change your mind, just say,” Sherlock says, pausing for a moment, pulling his face back to look into John’s eyes. “With – the word, or – other words. Whichever.”
“Barnes. One more thing.” Sherlock pauses. “I assume that your security cameras are a closed circuit system?”
Sherlock is on his knees in front of him and pulls him into his arms, holding him tightly. “It wasn’t your fault,” he says again, his voice low and gentle. “It wasn’t your fault.”
Jodie has to think about this. “Oh, I don’t know… like explaining his behaviour to people. I get why – he says some odd things, but then his face does a thing when you intervene and clarify – to rescue him, I assume. Save him from a social gaffe. But he’s definitely aware when you do it that he’s said something out of line, and even though you’re being nice and trying to save him from whatever social disaster he’s about to create, he seems to take it as a direct rebuke. Again, I don’t know either of you all that well at all. It’s just what it looks like to me.”
The room is dark. Sherlock makes a sound that John can’t quite decipher the meaning of. “Thank you,” he says a moment or two later.
John gives half a smile, though he completely understands. “Yeah, I don’t think that’s how this stuff works,” he says. “I’m sorry this is happening to you. For what it’s worth.”
all of that in the first place. But I wanted to do it officially. I thought that maybe I should wait, buy you a ring first, but I wanted it to be tonight. Here, where it first happened.”
Sherlock smiles at him, then says, “Listen: I have a strong feeling that involvement in this trafficking ring is limited to Lucas and Paul. It can’t have possibly been more people than that. The working theory is that one or both partners would be taken, and the other partner silenced. Killed,” he clarifies, when both Todd and Kyle look confused. “Some of the men reported their partners as missing while they were still here. Others realised only after returning home that their partners had not simply come back early, and made their reports from London or Birmingham or Milton Keynes. One person made a report on a review website and it was removed within minutes. That was the one that first raised suspicions in connection with this place. Then, what do you know, but someone went missing under our very noses, a member of our own group. What I imagine will happen now is this: the police will make their search and gather evidence. John’s theory is that the ravine may have been used as a handy disposal place for the partners who weren’t selected. It’s being searched by a specially trained team as we speak. When all of this dies down, I imagine that you will legally inherit the full ownership of this place,” he says to Todd.
The afternoon drags. The final session is a choice of four different workshops. Sherlock texts him to say that he’s going to the one called
John jerks back from Sherlock, their eyes on each other’s, then they fly into a silent, semi-panicked improvisation. John moves to the far wall and hastily sits down with his back to it, elbows on his knees as he bends forward, and Sherlock reaches for the door lock. “Yes, come in,” he says, assuming a tone of clipped urgency.
Sherlock catches the spirit immediately, picking it up even as the father appears, startled by their voices and frowning at them. Sherlock ignores the father as though he hasn’t noticed him there. “There
Sherlock fixes his gaze on her serene face. “Did you know?” he asks abruptly, point-blank. “Did Mycroft tell you that we weren’t really a couple when we came here?”
He risks a look at John and sees John’s mouth open. “But – ” He closes it and swallows, then tries again. “Tell me this,” he says instead, his voice and face as intense as Sherlock has ever seen it. “Why did you shoot Magnussen? Was it really for Mary, after she’d shot you?”
“All righty, question number one,” Jim says, assuming the role of leader. “What are some of the pros of having a destination wedding?”
“What, you didn’t add it to some sort of spreadsheet or something?” John digs, having a go at a light flirt.
“Right. Yeah. Okay. I’ll do that later.” John is vague, not specifying when or precisely where. “Are you still ordering us something?”
John nods. His throat is too tight to speak, but he manages to meet Sarah’s eyes first, then Kyle’s.
Sherlock struggles. “I – it’s not that simple,” he tries. He’s painfully aware that this is inadequate. “You were always different,” he says, the words coming with difficulty. “I knew that I was – intrigued by you. That I wanted you to move in. That I wanted you there by my side. That I couldn’t have – and wouldn’t have – ever brought anyone else to a crime scene.”
Several thousand thoughts crowd into Sherlock’s head at once and for a moment he is pinioned between all of them, unable to decide what to say first. Then his mind whirls and clears and he says the one thing that truly matters right now: the answer to John’s question. “I love you,” he says, and it comes out more intensely and urgently than anything he’s ever said before. He sees John’s face change, his eyes softening and somehow becoming even more fierce at the same time.
“Here,” he says, reaching back and clawing at the drawer handle of their shared nightstand until he’s successfully retrieved a small tube from inside.
Sherlock closes his eyes and puts his forehead against John’s, feeling swamped with emotion. “I love you,” he says. It’s the first thing that comes out. “And I meant that. Thank you for this. Thank you for marrying me. And for saying all that, too.”
He wrestles the man’s hands behind his back and has them secured with a zip tie after a brief, sweaty tussle. “Stop it!” he snarls, digging a knee into the man’s spine, but he’s distracted by Sherlock, who is bent over on his hands and knees. “Are you all right?” he asks, out of breath and worried.
This is part of their running joke and Sherlock knows it. He doesn’t rise to the bait, though, smiling as he tips his head back against the back wall of the tub.
“We did say we were looking to liven things up again,” Doug says, grinning. “So do put on a good show, won’t you? Could make our year.”
Sherlock’s lips purse a little. “I – literally got out of the car and made a beeline for our front door, there. Do you think I should – I don’t know, say something? Apologise for having left so abruptly?”
“An addictions group, yes,” Sherlock says evenly. “You know as well as anyone my own history of addictive behaviour. It’s also been an issue of some contention between us in the past. This way, it’s not just me supporting you or something, but us facing our problematic behaviour together and supporting one another. Thoughts?”
Sherlock makes a negative sound. “I still don’t necessarily agree that the comments were made by a woman in the first place,” he says, almost musingly. He looks up at the buildings towering above them. “Furthermore, when something seems to be deliberately drawing attention in a very particular way, it makes me ask what I’m being distracted from noticing instead.”
“I just want to make sure that I’ve said everything that needs to be said about all of that stuff before we leave it,” he says, a bit doggedly, knowing that Sherlock doesn’t want to discuss it anymore. “I want to make any amends necessary.”
Sherlock shakes his head a little. “Nothing until dinner. I’m going to my room to work on the case. What about you?”
“We never know what may come in handy,” John reminds him. “I noticed something, though. Not about the officer.”
“Calcium glutamate,” John says. “It was found in her blood. It’s prescribed for certain conditions, or to counteract magnesium sulfate, but her potassium levels were normal at the time of her death.”
Sherlock’s lips compress a little. “To have someone – do that – what you did… it made me feel… loved. More than that. Like I was worth… enough to you for you to – do that.” He stops, making an exasperated face. “That sounds ridiculous.”
John nods, understanding. “Yeah. They actually suggested that I marry my eighty-year-old ex-landlady,” he tells her, and Linda bursts into laughter.
John says his name then, his arms coming around Sherlock’s back and shoulders and they kiss for so long and so passionately that Sherlock nearly feels dizzy by the time they part for breath, almost overwhelmed by how much he didn’t even know he was capable of feeling for another person. He never would have admitted it unless John had actively asked, but ever since the day that he first touched John’s arse, put his mouth and tongue to it, he’s become privately
He’s gasping like a fish out of water, his arms shaking, hips pumping himself into the heat of John’s body, deeper and harder than he would have dared five minutes earlier. John is reaching down to grab at himself and Sherlock thinks that he should be doing that for him. He’s only just got his fingers around John’s when John arches upward and comes, wetness spraying hotly out and catching them both in the belly and chest. His body spurts again, clenching around Sherlock, and that’s it – he closes his eyes and lets himself go, giving one more hard thrust and feeling the wave break over him, turning himself inside out, flooding John’s body with gushes of wet release. He can hear himself, shouting and slamming into John, coming more and still more after that. The orgasm seems to go on for ages, his entire body prickling with it, flushing over his skin and huffing out his lungs.
He wakes with a guilty start because his arm is around John firmly, his entire body pressed up to John’s from behind him, but then he remembers everything and relaxes. A foolish, ridiculous smile spreads itself unstoppably over his face, his eyes still closed, thinking about the previous night. They’d emptied the champagne bottle and reduced most of the strawberries to a heap of green crowns, licking and sucking at each other’s fingers as they fed each other, until Sherlock had exhaled deeply and said, “Get these things away from me!” John had grinned, moved the last few berries to the night table, then reached for the lubricant and rolled Sherlock onto his back. He’d experimented between just thrusting against him the way Sherlock had earlier, and jerking them off jointly. Sherlock had been a little buzzed from the champagne, and that served to wash his memory of this in golden sensation. They’d come after several minutes of sweaty, gasping, rocking together, then lain together, breathing hard, and fallen asleep fairly soon after.
“That’s absolutely right,” the female cook corroborates. “Andrea is brilliant, and Phil’s quite good, too. He does most of the training and he’s a little more patient. Andrea can be very kind, too. She has her moods, but when the heat is on, sometimes everyone’s biting each other’s heads off. It’s just how big kitchens like this are.”
John puts his phone away and takes out his schedule. The Sally Jordan lecture is scheduled to begin in five minutes. Will Biggs turn up for it? It’s his best bet; they’re all supposed to attend the keynote series. It’s important to be seen doing so. He tucks his folder under one arm and makes for Hall A, falling in with a loose group of about fifteen all wandering in to find seats. He pauses just inside the door, scanning rapidly for Joe Biggs. He spots Pamela Blake first and wonders whether they should apprehend her, too, but Biggs is obviously more important here – he’s literally got a bomb in his room, only a few storeys above all of their heads. Homemade devices tend to be wildly unstable, depending on the bombmaking skills of the person who built it. Biggs’ bomb looks incredibly amateur-ish and John wonders when he built it, how long it’s been sitting there all ready to go for Saturday’s parade. Forty-eight hours away, John thinks, and then his eyes land on Biggs, sitting by himself in the very last row of the hall. Bingo.
John lets his hand fall from Sherlock’s. “I’ll, er, just take this… upstairs,” he says, meaning to his old bedroom.
Their table is called. John finds himself hastening to keep up with Jodie, falling into step beside her. “Er, all right, then,” he says, under his breath. “I guess if you have any insights, I could use them about now.”
Sherlock’s lower lip presses upward a little. “It’s hard to separate the notion of our… difficulties the past two nights from a perception of our success or potential for success on the whole. It’s hard to not think about it in terms of blame or self-reproach.”
John pushes a thigh between Sherlock’s, pressing it up into his spent balls, loving the soft warmth of them against his skin. “You okay?” he murmurs, his eyelids sagging.
Mrs Hudson waves this off. “No thanks, I’ve got to go and meet my friend Lila. She wants to show me some shop or other, so we’re meeting up for tea first. You two go ahead.” She favours them with a smile and Sherlock thinks uneasily of her choice of the
