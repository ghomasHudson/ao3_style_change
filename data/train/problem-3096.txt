He didn’t even have to do anything, really. Once he had made the connection to Dean between the effects of an orgasm and false ironwort, all he really needed to do was reinforce the concept a bit, and Dean would be left squirming.
That power was all Jack had to bargain with, though, and soon a deal was struck. In exchange for Castiel’s release, Jack would do what the shadow couldn’t and put the dead angels and demons back to sleep, leaving the Shadow once again in peace.
“Yeah, that sounds easy.” Dean let out a shaky breath. “I want. I want to kiss you again. And I want to go to bed with you too and then I don’t want you to be gone when I get up tomorrow. And I want to do that every day.”
Guy was the last to leave, and he turned to Mary at the door. “Enjoy your rum,” he said, then left, leaving her alone.
There was nobody there but each other, so they both shrugged sheepishly at each other, said good night again, and went back into their rooms.
“Sam, Cas and I have been friends for years, but with Michael gone, and our whole family here, and nothing looming on the horizon, this is an opportunity. Maybe a beautiful, moonlit ski lodge is what I’ve been waiting for. Maybe now it’s finally time?”
“Yeah, pretty shitty,” Cas said. He frowned. His mellow mood was fading quickly. He sat up. “Why would you do it?”
Castiel could remember those days, inhabiting Jimmy’s corporeal form was more like manipulating a puppet than actually living. Even after Chuck had resurrected him after he’d been exploded, first by Raphael, and then by Lucifer, he had not truly been a part of his body. It was only after he’d become human at Metatron’s hands that he’d fully integrated and
He worked his way down Dean’s back once again, and when he reached the offending underwear he hooked his fingers into the waistband and slowly tugged them off, creeping backwards until he reached Dean’s feet. He slid them off and tossed them aside, kneeling with one leg between Dean’s and working his way slowly back up, one big hand on each leg, thumbs and fingers working the muscles in his calves and thighs.
“I hope you two got everything out of your system,” Sam said. He’d been looking back and forth between them warily since he’d gotten home, but seemed relieved that they were both there, and that there was no open hostility, nor were there any broken items, holes in the wall, or injuries that would indicate any kind of violent fight.
“Well, I was about to burst out of those jeans,” Dean replied, walking over to the couch. Rowena’s eyes widened and a lascivious smile flashed across her face. Cas scowled at her, but she ignored them, scooting over and patting the sofa between herself and Cas. Dean grinned and squeezed himself in between them on the sofa.
Cas squinted and tilted his head in confusion, before apparently deciding that Dean was being serious, and handing him his plastic bag. Dean looked at it for a moment, then shrugged. “Which room, Cas?”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Cas replied. “He’s not your type. You usually go for the wealthy type, don’t you? Dean doesn’t really have much to offer you in that department.”
Dean rose to meet him as Cas began a steady glide in and out of him, and he lowered himself down to his elbow, pressing his body more firmly against Dean’s back as he moved within him, mouthing at his shoulder and neck, letting his tongue trace along behind his ear and to his jaw.
Cas knew he should be angry. And maybe he would be later on, but right now, he still had kind of a mellow feeling in his blood, despite his embarrassing display, so when Dean knocked on his door, Cas called out for him to come in.
Cas kept his eyes on Dean’s at first, but soon they drifted shut. His mouth parted, and his breath quickened. His hips jerked, and he wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist. Not stopping him, but just holding on.
Dean looked, but he didn’t see anything. Maybe a cloud. He looked at Cas, who was staring at the horizon intently. Then back at the sky again. Hm. Maybe it was bright for a cloud. A kind of soft, yellow wavering light in the sky. It was faint, barely there. Like a ghost that didn’t want to be seen. Without him even noticing the change, it brightened and intensified, although, if he were to be honest, not to the point that it was really worth putting on his bucket list or anything.
Ironwood. Iron… something. Okay. Whatever. It was in the history or something. Dean stared at the website. It was not really a good website. Small print. Lots of links, poorly designed. He sighed, trying to find the order history, but it was just a jumble of crap. He didn’t feel like looking at it. He did find the search bar though. He started typing, poking at the keyboard with one finger.
“He’s all yours, Angel. Besides, I have my eye on a Winchester.” She turned to the mirror and started smoothing her hair and touching up her lipstick. She was just rearranging the neckline of her dress to show her breasts off more advantageously when Sam came in the room and stopped in his tracks, staring at her. Cas sighed. Sam would be a much better partner for Rowena than Dean. He was much more graceful and classy, and he had a much deeper appreciation for her magic. Plus, he couldn’t keep his eyes off her. Unfortunately, Rowena never seemed to notice the younger Winchester.
Walking up the bathroom door, he began what he’d been wanting to say for what seemed like his whole life.
Cas eased his finger out of Dean and left the bed, quickly finding the lube in Dean’s bag and returning to his spot between Dean’s thighs. Dean closed his eyes in anticipation at the sound of the cap flipping open. He let his legs fall further apart when Cas nudged at his inner thigh with his knee, and he was almost quivering by the time Cas finally pressed his lubed finger once again to Dean’s hole. It slid inside easier than before, further, and Cas resumed his rhythm from before as he worked it inside, bit by bit, until his knuckles were pressed up against Dean’s ass.
Dean didn’t argue, for obvious reasons, as Cas lifted him up and bridal carried him back to the Impala.
Mary was in the corner, digging through her bags. Finally, she pulled out a couple of bottles of rum and held them up triumphantly. “Wow! I was worried they would be broken, what with Sam’s crazy driving. Guess what, guys! I’m gonna go make hot buttered rum!”
When Cas returned to the living room, he found that Rowena had followed Dean across the sofa and was pressed up against him once again. He was nodding uncomfortably as Rowena ran her finger down his arm and purred into his ear. Cas caught something about “getting past it and relaxing” and decided he better step in to help his friend. His friend Dean.
“AGGhhhh!!! Get out!” Cas yelled. His eyes flared for a moment. He’d had more than enough for one night. Sam fled with his champagne clutched in his hand. Dean turned to Cas, but before he could say anything, Sam stuck his head back in the door.
He wasn’t sure what to do next, so he looked at the newspaper again. Apparently, a woman had survived, and was still in the hospital. Castiel headed there next. He didn’t have a suit or any identification or badges, so he wasn’t sure exactly what he was going to say, but when he pulled up in front of the building and saw a cop coming out, he decided to just go right for it. He rolled down his window and flagged the cop over.
But with the events of the last few months, it was in an uproar. Angels and demons of all kinds had woken up. Some wandered, calling out for companions, while others fought, old grudges awoken just as easily as those who held them.
“Take this off,” he said. Dean nodded and grabbed the whole thing, t-shirt, flannel, everything, and pulled it off over his head, leaving the flannel shirt inside out inside the t-shirt. That was a problem for later.
Nobody ever said Dean was a nice guy. Or that he was above pulling a prank every now and then. So nobody could get mad at him if he played a little joke on Cas, especially after all the shit they’d been through. After all, they were family. And if he wouldn’t hesitate to pull something like this on Sammy, given the opportunity, then nothing should stop him from pulling something like this on Cas, right?
For a second, he was relieved. He saw Dean, standing against a post, his head bowed. But his relief was short lived. At his feet sat Sam, surrounded by the corpses of vampires, and he was crying.
Cas didn’t seem to hear, thank god. His phone went dark. “You should get some rest, Dean. We have a long drive back tomorrow.”
Dean did actually feel a bit bad about it. It was just a joke. He tried explaining it, like a kick me sign or when Sam had put crazy glue on Dean’s beer bottle.
Castiel set the cloth aside and turned back to Dean. He started at his shoulder blades, rubbing them firmly in slow circles, then up to his neck and down along his spine, slowly, avoiding pressing on the spine. The angle was awkward from where he was sitting, and Dean must have noticed the uneven pressure. He turned his head and peered up at him.
It was making it so that now whenever he looked at Cas, he couldn’t think of anything else. He couldn’t bring himself to mention it to Cas, though.
Dean looked at his brother, waiting seductively in Cas’ room, and felt a fury he hadn’t felt since he had the Mark.
There was a pause, then Cas answered. “Good, actually. I feel, mellow, but not like I’ve been drugged or anything. More like… like I’m limber and warm. I think I needed that stretch.”
“Oh… that sounds like heaven!” Cas said. “Fresh air, nice views. Curling up with a blanket by the fire with a steamy drink…”
Sam opened his mouth to say something, but before he could, Cas returned. “It’s all good,” he said. “Rowena said she’d love to come.”
Dean watched, eyes wide, as Cas ran a finger through the mess on Dean’s belly, and bringing it to his lips, licked it off.
“It’s harmless,” Cas said. “It’s not addictive. It’s not even irresistible. It’s just very alluring. And if we smell it or eat it, it can induce a kind of euphoria in angels. It doesn’t last long, and there’s no after effects.”
It was a good thing Sam and Jack weren’t here. They’d gone to the movies, since Dean had been on edge a lot the last few weeks, and eventually Sam had grown tired of his snippy attitude, making sure to make it very clear that Dean was
The bathroom door opened in a whoosh and Dean’s heart fell into his stomach… then it shot straight back up and entirely out of his body, because it wasn’t Cas standing in the bathroom doorway.
He felt a little awkward as he headed naked to Dean’s room. He hoped Dean wouldn’t mind if he borrowed some clothing. He headed to the dresser first, pulling on a shirt and grabbing some jeans, hesitating for just a moment before grabbing underwear and socks. The pants were a little tight, but they would do for now.
Dean looked puzzled for a minute. He rolled his eyes around in his head for a moment, trying to remember, and Sam sighed in exasperation. Finally he remembered. “Oh, the thing, with the thing. With the plant website. Yeah, I ordered it.”
Rowena hopped to her feet, striding over to Cas and poking him in the chest. “You just want him all to yourself!”
With that in mind, Castiel headed into the bathroom to retrieve a washcloth, which he dampened with cool water and brought back to Dean. He only hesitated a moment before he sat down next to Dean on the edge of the bed.
So he mixed a good tablespoon into the sauce, a bit more into the garlic butter, and for good measure, sprinkled it over the top of the cheese before he put the whole dish in the oven. An hour later, he yelled for everyone to come for dinner.
He slowly came down, and Cas slowed his movements, but he didn’t stop. When Dean was able to open his eyes, it was to find Cas still watching him, a lazy smile on his lips.
Astoundingly, Cas continued. “Although, in my experience, that was merely a fleeting physical experience. This was as much cerebral and emotional as it was physical.”
“Dean,” Sam warned, but he didn’t get any further. Suddenly, Cas let out a loud moan, and then without warning, it was like an explosion went off, and the kitchen was full of black feathers.
They watched each other another few moments, an eternity, a second, and Cas let his hand rest on Dean’s face, his thumb tracing his cheekbone, his lips. Dean crept closer and Cas let his legs tangle with Dean’s. Maybe they would kiss.
Guy shrugged in a very French looking sort of way. “I don’t know. But, may I venture to say, it didn’t look like you enjoyed Rowena’s flirting very much, either.”
Dean watched, straining to see in the dark, as Cas tapped some of the herb out into the palm of his hand. He shoved the baggie back into his pocket and brought his hand up to his face, and
Cas was admiring the view out of his window while everyone else got settled in. He was a little bit worried about Dean. He was acting a bit strangely. But then again, he had been that way ever since the thing with Michael. He sighed and pushed the thought out of his head. At least Dean seemed happy.
“You’re very warm, still,” Cas said. He removed his finger from Dean’s mouth. “I’d better keep trying to cool you off.”
If Dean had had anything in his mouth, he would have spit it out. He sat up and stared at Cas, who didn’t look up from his phone.
Cas stiffened for a few seconds, and Dean just went on kissing him, mentally bracing him for the blowback. He figured it would be about a sixty/forty chance that Cas would either back up in a panic, or haul off and punch him. He put about a zero percent chance on what actually happened. Which was Cas sighing against his mouth, before squeezing his arm and actually pulling him closer.
If Castiel thought it was difficult running a cloth over Dean’s front while keeping up the pretense that this was some kind of treatment, it was about a thousand times worse from the back. Dean’s muscles gleamed in the low light of the motel room, the dim lamp and the bathroom light casting shadows and giving him a soft glow.
He wanted to spread those cheeks, push them apart with his thumbs and bury his face between them, but he wanted to drag it out more, so he slid his hands to the side, running them up Dean’s hips to his waist then back down again, rubbing circles into the tops of his thighs once again.
Cas looked up as Dean came in. He was on the phone, with Garth, Cas guessed. “Mom, can you turn that down? I can’t hear.”
Dean felt the cloth return to his chest as Cas ran it down his chest and over his ribs, back up and over his nipples, which peaked up with the cold. Dean thought he heard a small sound escape from Cas, and then he did it again, and again, and maybe Dean was wrong but maybe he’d let his thumb slip past the edge of the cloth and flick his nipple.
“Me too,” Dean, Cas, Guy, and Rowena all said at once. They all followed Sam out of the living room.
Cas didn’t argue. Instead, he just kind of rubbed his face where the dried leaves were stuck to him, and then rubbed his fingers together and took a big sniff. “Mmmmgh” he said.
“Good night, Dean,” Cas said, and gave him a little wave, the small plastic bag visible between his fingers. There. Let him wonder what Cas was doing in his room all night tonight.
There was a shout from the bed and suddenly the covers flew up and over, covering the shape on the bed. There was no hiding that voice, though.
Dean followed Guy down the stairs to his room, where he opened the door and stepped inside, flicking on the light.
Two more songs played, and Cas occasionally twitched and shivered next to him, or let out the odd soft sound, and the lights in the sky faded.
During dinner, he suggested they watch a movie. While Jack and Sam made popcorn and Cas finished up the dishes, Dean headed to the Dean Cave, ostensibly to set up the movie. Once there, he grabbed the jar out from where he’d hidden it, and pulled the old quilt off the back of the couch. Quickly, in case the others arrived, he spread some of the herb from the jar on the quilt, before closing the jar and hiding it away again. Then, he rubbed the leaves into the blanket the best he could, and then refolded it so the angel-nip was on the inside, and replaced it on the arm of the couch.
“Hey, Cas,” he said. Cas was standing outside his door, with Jack. “Hello, Sam,” Cas said. Jack lifted his hand in greeting.
Of course, that meant Dean was a tiny bit distracted while the ghost tried to defend its bones, and it swooshed right through him just as he dropped the matches in the grave. It wasn’t able to save itself, but it did disable Dean temporarily.
It sounded like a sob. Castiel crept forward, his knife ready, a sick feeling of dread slowly building in his stomach.
Cas leaned forward, paused, just shy of Dean, and Dean could feel his breath, he could feel the sheer electricity of him, and he leaned the rest of the way and let their lips brush together.
“Side pocket of my bag,” Dean replied. Thank fuck he kept that around for the occasional pay-per-view-and-alone-time opportunity he got on hunts.
He looked around, noticing with curiosity that Dean had a half-finished job application sitting on his desk. Was he hoping to get out of hunting? The thought pleased him.
They offered him a job at the library, so he got a real job, better than working at the Gas-n-Sip, at least, and Sam and Eileen got a trailer and pulled it out to Bobby’s old property and stayed there. Sometimes Castiel helped them on the weekends as they cleared out the rubble and old cars. As they planned the house they wanted to build.
“I don’t think so,” Sam said. Both of them watched as Cas sniffed heavily and exhaled into the baggie, causing a poof of dried leaves to float out. Some of them stuck to his face. He didn’t seem to notice. Instead, he licked his finger and stuck it in the bag, before pulling it out, coated in the herb, and stuck it in his mouth.
Dean licked his lips in anticipation. The movement drew Cas’ eyes to Dean’s mouth, and Dean saw his throat move as he swallowed.
“I want to go to your room,” the angel said. “I want to see if there’s anything I can do that will make you make the same sound.”
“I thought I heard you in here,” Guy said. He must have picked up on Dean’s desperation, because he glanced back at Rowena before adding, “I have that thing I was telling you about. In my room?” Dean was confused for a moment, before he realized Guy was giving him an out. Maybe this guy wasn’t so bad after all.
Rowena moved next to Dean and ran her finger up his arm. “I bet I could create a better view with a little magic,” she purred. Dean didn’t reply, but he did shoot a glare at Sam.
When he arrived at Cas’ pants, they were already open. Dean wanted to taste him, to feel him on his tongue, but Cas stopped him with a hand on his cheek. “Are you sure, Dean?” he asked.
Cas took it upon himself to introduce Guy around the room, finally stopping at the two brothers. “This is Sam and Dean Winchester,” Cas said.
“Wait a second…” Sam said, from the doorway. He looked suspiciously at everyone, glaring at them one at a time. “All these attempted hookups. All this sneaking around…. and nobody was looking for me?”
Dean turned too, looking at the horizon again. The aurora had intensified during the last few minutes, and was a definite shimmering glow now, green and yellow, hazy, still and moving somehow at the same time, twisting and curling on itself. Dean felt weird, almost like he’d taken some kind of drug himself that had created this vision. His hands and feet tingled. His stomach seemed to drop into his pelvis, and there was definitely something inappropriate happening in his pants.
Cas was the last one through the door. He had no luggage, although he did have a plastic Gas-n-Sip bag with a book in it. He hadn’t found much to pack, after all. “What a lovely place,” he said, glancing around. He walked over to the window. “What a lovely view!” he exclaimed.
“Dean, you’re forty years old. And Cas doesn’t understand pranks. It’s not like he’s gonna figure out how to get you back. This just looks like you’re picking on him.”
Satisfied, he picked up his dish and stated that he was going to eat it alone in his room. He tried not to laugh at the sputtering sounds that came out of Dean’s as he walked away.
He didn’t think he would be able to handle it if Cas got into his pants right now. And honestly, he wanted a turn exploring Cas’ body as well. He wanted to see what was under all those layers. Investigate at his leisure. So he yanked Cas to his feet and began pulling him out of all his clothing.
He raised his hand and began stroking the blanket, and then a minute later, he slid it off the arm of the couch and buried his face in it.
Cas said something in French to Guy, and Guy finally stopped staring at Dean long enough to reply. They spoke back and forth for a moment, and Dean noticed that Cas did not take his eyes off Guy at all the whole time. It was irritating. Finally, in order to break up the conversation, Dean just blurted out the first thing that came to his mind.
“Ohhh. Yes.” Cas cleared his throat. “It’s a herb. Mostly harmless. In the mint family. It’s good for cuts but not much else. It does have one property though.” Sam watched as red started to rise up Cas’ face. “It… uh… smells really good to angels.”
Sam eventually managed to summon his ghost, but he was still a bit pissy about the whole thing, so when a case involving a possible vampire popped up in Minnesota, Dean let him stay behind and grabbed Cas instead, and they drove the eight hours to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. They checked into a motel, and set about the business of tracking down the nest.
Despite what Sam and Dean thought about him, Cas did, in fact have a good sense of how the sort of prank wars the two brothers engaged in occasionally functioned. He also had a good idea of how to best get a little payback for Dean’s actions with the false ironwort. He was a soldier. He’d been created to strategize and outflank his opponent. And he was perfectly willing to use the endowments God had given him as an angel to his advantage.
Dean turned down the next road he saw, then drove until Cas indicated he should pull over. He stopped the car, and shut it off, but Cas leaned over and put it on accessory mode, leaving the radio on. He rolled down the window and got out. Dean stepped out too, walking around to where Cas was leaning on the trunk, his feet crossed.
“Hmmm. Divine,” he said. Dean thought he would die at the sight. He wanted so badly to see his angel come. He needed it.
Castiel could tell Dean was going to be okay. Although he had been a bit concerned when the ghost had passed through him earlier, it’s not like this wasn’t anything they hadn’t seen before. But usually Sam was there, and Castiel usually deferred to Dean’s brother when it came to these things, because, frankly, it was a minor thing that usually passed.
“We just ran into each other here.” A faint frown flickered across Cas’s face. “I was on my way to the kitchen.”
Cas slid out of the bed and towards the door. Dean noticed he was wearing nothing but his pajama bottoms, leaving his chest bare.
When there wasn’t a trace left to be found, Cas stood upright and stretched. “Should we go?” he asked.
She turned the volume down an infinitesimal amount. “Sorry,” she said. “I had a cold last week and my ear is still plugged up.”
“Don’t say anything. I think I’ve been embarrassed enough for one day.” He opened his door. Dean followed him.
“You’re a little warm,” Cas said. “We better get you back to the motel. I can’t heal you just yet because I had to smite all those werewolves, but I don’t think it’s an emergency.”
They wandered through the bunker alone afterwards. It was quiet. Castiel tried to sleep at night, in Dean’s room. He didn’t pray. What could he ask for? Jack wouldn’t interfere, wouldn’t bring Dean back. If Castiel had just stayed in Heaven, he and Dean would be together now.
Once things were set in motion, Castiel was able to take some time to visit some of the souls he’d met on earth. He visited Charlie, Kevin, and Bobby, but he saved Mary for last. He’d known her best of all, in some ways, having met her later in his time on Earth. She had been part of his life when he’d been most fulfilled, living in the bunker with Jack, Sam, and Dean. He’d been more human-like by then, less the angelic force he’d been when he’d met Bobby, and he loved her like family in a way he felt with nobody else besides Jack and the Winchester brothers.
He wet the cloth again and went back into the bedroom. Dean was still sprawled on the bed. Their eyes met.
Days passed. The dog sat by Castiel sometimes, by Sam others. Eileen visited, left. Visited again. Sam and Castiel sat in the library and talked. Castiel told him about Jack, about Mary and Bobby and everyone in heaven. Told him they were waiting for Dean.
As soon as he was inside, he realized what the problem was. There was light and sound coming from the bathroom. Maybe this would be better. It might be easier if he didn’t have to look Cas in the eye.
He went back to the kitchen and managed to find some food, and as he ate, he considered his options. He had no phone, but his truck was still in the garage, and he knew he had one of the Winchester’s unlimited credit cards in the glove box for emergencies. He could wait here for Sam and Dean to return, but he was impatient, and besides, he might be able to help them on the hunt. It was a long drive, but he figured he could make it to Ohio in about eight hours if he drove like Dean.
Sam could only watch in dawning awareness as Cas nodded at Dean in agreement, who then proceeded to plant a kiss right on Cas’ lips, before taking his hand and tugging him out of the room.
He could feel Cas’ gaze on him. He could see it in his mind without even looking back, that intent stare. His hands circled, pushing his ass cheeks apart, dipping between, brushing the back of his balls.
Once they left, Dean let out a sigh of relief. Guy set down the fire poker and sat on the other end of the couch, propping one ankle up on his knee and stretching his arm along the back of the couch. He smiled at Dean.
Cas smiled a little, and his eyes crinkled a bit at the corners, and it was captivating. Dean looked at him for a long time, until he finally came to the realization that they had probably done this a hundred times before, just watched each other. But this was different. Like the air was charged between them. No, that wasn’t right. The air had always been charged between them.
They arrived in the living room to find a stranger there, burdened down with bags and bags of groceries. Cas rushed to help, taking most of the bags and revealing the stranger’s face. He was… wow. He was very aesthetically pleasing. Glossy brown hair, green eyes, and a toothy grin… Cas suddenly decided to reconsider his opinion about human obsessions. This man looked like a perfect jumping off point for Cas to test out human relationships.
it. Dean stopped breathing for a moment, until Cas let out a sigh, almost a growl, and Dean released his own breath.
Dean stalled, hanging up his towel and putting his things away. Cas shifted from one foot to the other.
Cas grinned. “Pretty much anywhere without any light pollution. Maybe down one of these gravel roads here.”
“Even better! You know how I’ve been saying we should take a holiday? Well, I have it right here! A three day weekend in Breckenridge, with a private lodge, and lessons from an Olympic champion!”
Cas wasn’t blind. He knew that Dean, perhaps only subconsciously, held some small attraction towards him. But Dean had never said anything, nor indicated he was interested in anything other than the friendship they had, and Cas was unwilling to jeopardize their relationship by indicating that he’d noticed, or that he himself felt similarly. He’d rather keep things as they were, rather than risk losing Dean altogether. He’d long ago accepted that a more intimate relationship with Dean was something he could never have.
He passed the dirt road about a mile outside of Canton, and he could see the old barn between the trees. It was worth a look, he figured, pulling over and checking for traffic before pulling a u-turn and heading up the dirt road. He grinned when he drove around the abandoned barn, seeing the Impala tucked away out of sight. Jackpot.
Cas’ room was dark, but just as Cas fumbled for the light switch, there was a loud POP. When the lights came on, they revealed Sam, shirtless, in Cas’ bed, with a bottle of champagne spewing all over his chest and lap. As soon as he saw who it was, Sam started desperately trying to keep the champagne in the bottle, but only succeeded in spilling even more of it.
Not in a dramatic way. Maybe that wasn’t the word. Dean didn’t know the word. It was like he was fidgeting, but his movements were sinuous instead of jerky. His breaths were long and slow, but with a forced, huffing quality. He looked itchy.
Everyone was staring at him. Dean looked around frantically. When his eyes landed on Guy, he snapped, “Get the hell out of my bed!”
His eyes followed Castiel’s hands as they worked loose the buckle of his pants. Castiel let them fall, and pushed his boots off with his toes before stepping out of the whole works quickly, eager to get his hands back on Dean.
“You smell better than any ‘angel-nip’, Dean. You’re intoxicating.” He took a deep breath. “I want to know if you smell that way all over. I want to know how you taste.”
Rowena sort of… glided into the room and slid onto the end of his bed, raising one eyebrow at him. “So,” she said, tapping one glossy, lacquered nail on her chin. “Now that he’s not trying to murder me, I am starting to realize how handsome Dean is.”
Rowena had brought very aerodynamic skiing clothes with her, and looked stunning with her fur lined satin coat. However, under no circumstances would she leave the lodge. Instead, she sat by the fire and let handsome young men buy her drinks. Sam considered dragging her outside and tossing her into a snowbank, but since she had actually made it into his room the second night, he didn’t want to jeopardize that.
He was doomed for sure. Or so he thought, until he heard a knock at the door. He was saved! He pushed Rowena off of himself and went to answer the door.
It was the ski instructor, leaned up against the doorframe, a grin on his face. Dean blinked. He really looked like Dick Roman when he did that.
Suddenly, Cas remembered something. “Oh, I just realized I can’t go.” He glanced guiltily at the brothers. “I told a friend I would help with a translation of some Enochian spells, and I’ve already postponed twice.”
“Really?” Sam took the paper from Jack. “Huh,” he said. He read further down. “Jack, it says here it’s for this weekend! It’s Thursday now!”
“Is that so?” Cas asked. “Like this?” And he moved his mouth across Dean’s jaw and down his throat, licking and kissing along the way.
Mary was standing at the stove, stirring a pot with one hand and hitting herself on the ear with the other. Cas walked up beside her. She startled a bit, but relaxed with a small laugh when she saw it was him. Cas normally knew better than to sneak up on hunters, but it had been too easy the last few days with Mary’s ears. And he’d already given up on offering to heal them, there was no point in bringing it up again.
As soon as he saw the flannel on the back of the chair, he realized it was Dean’s room, but it wasn’t empty. There, in the bed, was the ski instructor, Guy.
Castiel stood, shrugging out of his coat and suit jacket. He hesitated a moment, before rolling up his sleeves. Dean watched him intently, his eyes wide. Castiel went to wet the cloth again. While the water ran, Castiel looked at himself in the mirror. He was definitely flushed, and it wasn’t because of any ghost sickness. Honestly, he was surprised he had enough blood left in his body to flush his face, since so much of it seemed to have collected in his vessel’s penis.
Dean turned to Cas. “Hey, uh, before you go see Rowena, can I talk to you? There’s something I need to tell you.” Cas nodded and followed Dean into his room.
Dean fully intended to do exactly that, but first he needed to order this herb for Sam. He’d been working on this case for weeks. There was a ghost of a soldier who was somehow travelling from place to place. Sam had been driving all over the country, trying to track it down. But then Rowena had suggested a summoning spell that worked on warriors who died of their wounds. They had most of what they needed in the bunker, but the ironwort would need to be ordered online, if it had a chance to arrive before Sam did.
Bringing them back down to his sides, he rolled his shoulders and his neck, his eyes closed, and it reminded Dean of a cat stretching in the sun. There was another growl, almost like a purr, and then the wings vanished again into whatever dimension Cas normally stored them in.
Dean came into the living room a moment later to find Sam watching Rowena, and Cas just standing there. He was going to go talk to Cas, but then Mary came in and a moment later Dick friggin Roman walked out of the kitchen.
“Hell yeah. I wanna see… I’m dying to know if I can do anything to you that can make those wings pop out again.”
Sam kicked the snow off his boots as he strode into the bunker, his arms full of groceries. Spying Jack sitting at the map table on his laptop, he sent the kid back out to grab the rest of the stuff from the car. “Don’t forget the mail on the front seat, Jack!” he shouted as he headed towards the kitchen.
They undressed themselves the rest of the way, then crawled together into Dean’s bed, where they came together in the middle by some unspoken agreement. Dean’s mouth found Cas’, and they lay like that for a while, running their hands over each others’ bodies, mapping them out, finding the sensitive spots and the soft spots, until eventually, Dean found himself on his back, Cas lying between his parted legs, his hips moving in a slow rhythm.
Sam figured he should probably put this stuff somewhere safe, but he kind of wanted to see what would happen. Dean seemed equally fascinated, his eyes wide as he watched Cas repeatedly rub his face, and sniff and lick his fingers.
“It’s when solar flares react with ionizing gasses in the polar regions of the outer atmosphere. It’s a relatively rare phenomena this far south.”
His heart pounding in his chest, he decided to just go for it. He opened the door and stepped through.
Sam was sitting in the living room with Cas and Dean when Rowena came in. She was dressed in a long, silky purple nightgown. The dark colour really complimented the red of her hair. “That’s a really pretty nightgown,” Sam said to her.
It took him a moment to come back to himself. Cas hadn’t moved, his body draped over Dean’s back, his forehead pressed to his shoulder. An aftershock rippled through him, forcing Cas free, and Dean shuddered at the sudden emptiness. Cas shifted slightly, but didn’t move. Once he did, they would have to acknowledge this change in their relationship, and Dean, at least, was not quite sure how to do that.
When he was done the toast, Cas started on the lasagna as well. He started picking it apart again, but after the first bite, he just started shoveling it in. Dean tried not to laugh. Man, he’d have to slip this into all of Cas’ food from now on, just so he’d appreciate his cooking.
“Hm, maybe I could rub them a bit.” Castiel tried to disguise the eagerness he felt at getting his hands on Dean directly, but his voice shook a little bit despite himself.
Sam rubbed his hands over his face. Now he was going to have to order the correct herb and wait for that before he could do the spell.
Visceral, all right. Dean pictured it, the way Cas made that sound and then looked so… blissed out. Like he’d just…
Dean looked at Cas’ face, and it only took a second to realize the expression was fear, more than anything. He stepped back, out of reach. “Oh shit, I’m sorry,” he said. He got ready for the next part. The part where he pre-emptively told Cas it was okay if he wanted to leave, because it was easier to blame himself for Cas going than to blame Cas. He looked at the floor, getting ready.
“I’ll walk you there,” Dean blurted out. “The hall is dark.” He shrugged at Guy. “I think my room is safe now.”
Dean unlocked the door to the ski lodge and ushered Mary in. She was waving her phone around. “Do you think they have Wi-fi here?” Dean ignored her and began working his jaw. His ear had popped coming up the mountain. He pushed on his ear and smiled in relief as it snapped back to normal. He looked at his Mom. “How are your ears doing?”
Everyone greeted him, with apparent friendliness. The guy, “Guy,” was only looking at Dean, though. Dean stared back, and it took him a moment to realize he wasn’t actually Dick Roman, he just really resembled him. He could have been his brother. Dean sidled over to Sam. “Does he look like anyone you know?” he asked.
“I guess not,” Dean said. He didn’t really want to look at ionizing gasses, or whatever, right now. He kind of just wanted a beer and some chili fries. He glanced at Cas, who was looking at him hopefully. He sighed. “Okay, fine. Where to, sir?”
Dean could feel Cas looking at him in the dark, and he suddenly felt self-conscious, even though it had been Cas who was exposed. Without saying anything, he moved to lean on the Impala beside Cas again, and turned his attention back to the sky.
Castiel returned to the bed, straddling Dean’s thighs. He tried to ignore how perfectly his hips seemed to nestle into Dean’s ass, and instead began to concentrate on each muscle as he worked his fingers into it, starting with the splenius capitus, down the trapezius to the deltoid. He ran his hands along the rhomboid major and minor muscles, inching his fingers along in small circles until he reached the latissimus dorsi, which he followed up to the ribs and then back down to the spine. The only thing left was the gluteus maximus, and honestly, mentally reciting all that Latin had not helped in the slightest.
“Oh. The thing. Yeah.” He turned to Rowena. “I’ll catch you later,” he said, and without waiting for a response, he stepped outside.
for granted, forgot to look past the confused head tilt and the frumpy accountant getup. But sometimes, like today, he remembered that Cas was
Cas stood up. Apparently, Dean had been closer than Cas had realized, because he almost fell over. When he straightened up, he moved away from Rowena to the other end of the couch. Fine by Cas, this way there would be room for Sam. “I’ll get it,” Cas said, and headed into the kitchen.
“Rowena, can I talk to you for a moment? I just thought of something about that book you brought, and I wanted to mention it before I forgot.”
Mary didn’t seem to have heard him. Cas decided to go back to the living room and wait until it was ready.
It had really been just a goal, at first. No solid plan had come to him immediately. And the incident with the aurora borealis hadn’t exactly been a part of that plan. He’d truly done that mostly just to relax. He had had the herb safely in his possession for a while, but he just hadn’t found a good opportunity to use it until then.
But he was also not willing to let Dean get away with his actions in the movie room, and especially with the lasagna. Actions had consequences. So he had decided, not long after that event, to get a little bit of petty revenge, and see if he could make Dean as uncomfortable as he had been. Just for a little while.
Sam walked up behind his mom and tapped her on the shoulder. She jumped, and Sam took a step back with his hands up.
Just then, Rowena came barging in from her room, covered in a towel. She stormed up to Sam, her eyes flaring purple. “How dare you walk into a lady’s room without knocking. Don’t you Winchesters have any manners?”
Back in the map room, he untied the parcel. Inside were three small ziploc bag full of dried leaves. He opened one up and took a sniff, and frowned. It didn’t smell quite right. He’d used ironwort before, but not often. He wondered if it was just stale.
Cas had recently come to the realization that he was… lonely. He loved Jack, and the Winchesters, and his other friends, but he wanted a companion. And he had realized years ago, when he was human, that Dean saw him as nothing but a friend. So he had decided a short time ago to perhaps start meeting people, dating, as the humans called it. He’d even considered going to Sam to ask for advice.
As soon as he was gone, Sam turned to Dean. “What the hell, Dean! You’re making a fool of yourself!”
He didn’t have to consider it for long. He would miss Mary, Bobby, and Jack, his friends and family who lived in Heaven, but he knew he’d see them again. He was willing to wait.
“D-Dean!” Cas’ fingers tightened on Dean’s hip. It would bruise later, mark him, and Cas slammed into him hard, pinning him down, stiffening, as heat flooded into his ass. Dean pushed back against him, desperately, on the brink, and Cas’ hips flexed one more time, his cock slurping wetly into him, hitting his prostate and pushing him over the edge into oblivion, his body tensing and shaking as he spilled into his fist.
Rowena looked at Cas for sympathy. “I can’t believe it either. And the second Guy came along, he ran off.” She wiped a tear from her eye and then stomped off to her own room, slamming the door behind her.
“As you know, I’ve been working to repopulate the angels with converted human souls. I think I’ve found a way to reverse the process. The other times you were ‘human’, you weren’t really human, so much as graceless to the point that the core of your grace, your essence, was basically functioning as a soul. If you want, I could convert your grace into a genuine human soul. After that, resurrecting your body is simple, and I would simply place your soul back in your body. You’d be fully human, permanently. You wouldn’t be able to steal grace, or hear angel radio, you’ld age and die, and your soul would be weighed by Anubis and sent to Heaven or Hell.”
“Jack is only half angel,” Cas said. He stared at the bag, then shook his head and looked up at Sam. “It’s definitely not going to work in that spell, though. It’s not good for much else, unless you wanted to make a particular kind of incense.”
“Okay, fine. I won’t give Cas any more angel-nip without telling him. And I should go apologize. You got the rest of these dishes, right?” he said, tossing the towel to Sam and striding out of the kitchen.
As he watched Cas drive, his fingers wrapped around the leather of the steering wheel, Dean became aware that control was gradually returning to his body. First his fingers and his toes, then his legs and arms, then his torso, thank god, because he was a little uncomfortable and needed to shift a bit because the left side of his ass was starting to ache. Then, just as they pulled into their parking spot at the motel, he was able to move his face. By the time Cas stopped the engine and came around to the passenger side, Dean was already getting out. “‘M fine, Cassh,” Dean said, only slightly slurring. “I can walg.”
Dean laughed to himself. Sam was pathetic. He didn’t have a chance with Rowena. He stepped over and caught a bag just as it slipped from Sam’s grasp. “You look pretty tired, Sammy. Maybe I shouldn’t have let you drive? The way you took those curves, Rowena kept smashing into you on each corner. It almost looked deliberate.”
“You’re looking a little flushed. Your pupils are dilated too. Let me check if your temperature is still high.”
Dean couldn’t even respond. He just leaned back onto the door as Cas licked at the side of his neck, behind his ear, then the front of his throat. His hand worked its way under the shirt Dean was wearing, but when his mouth got to the collar, he gripped it and tugged in frustration.
She didn’t reply, So he repeated his question again, then once more, before waving his hand in front of her face. He pointed at his ear. “How’s your hearing?” he asked again, loudly.
“Fuck, yes,” Dean replied. He didn’t move though. Instead he just kissed Cas again, until eventually the angel grabbed onto his shirt and started tugging, and they just sort of stumbled their way to Dean’s room.
Ugh, this was hard. At least the website autofilled suggestions. Blearily, he scrolled through the list. Finally, he found it. False Ironwort. Awesome.
Sam figured he had a fifty-fifty shot, so he took a stab at it and opened the door to the middle room and flicked on the light.
“Just do it, please,” Dean answered, and Cas didn’t make him wait any longer before pressing his aching cock into Dean.
“No, not your room. Your- nevermind.” He stepped closer, and spoke a little louder. “Is it my imagination or is your son Dean attracted to-”
“No, I promised. I should keep my promises. If you want it, you can have it. I know you were thinking about taking a holiday.”
“Well,” Mary began. “I wasn’t sure about her at first, what with her being a witch and all. But with all the things that we’ve gone through in the last few years, I have certainly come to appreciate her.” She peered up at her son, who was looking down at her with wide, hopeful hazel eyes. Her youngest son really was such a kind boy. She wanted nothing for him but happiness. She leaned in conspiratorially. “I think she has the hots for you,” Mary said.
It didn’t come up again for a few weeks, although Dean did notice that Sam had removed the jar of false ironwort from the herb cupboard. Not that it mattered. He still had a bit, and he could always order more.
That made sense. Castiel wiped the cloth gently down Dean’s neck and chest, running it over his shoulders and across his clavicle. He wanted to press his mouth to that bone, to the hollow of his throat, to his nipple, but he shouldn’t. He couldn’t.
“Okay,” Sam said over the phone. “I saved that website on my computer. Just go into past orders, and find ironwort.”
Dean was not threatened by Sam. Not even a bit. “All I said was, that it’s interesting.” He smiled at Sam, then winked, before heading out of the room.
Dean was already turning to go back into Cas’ room, but then he stopped and peered at Guy. “Jealous?”
Sam snickered and headed to the other adjoining door. “I’ll let you sort this out. Meanwhile, there is a beautiful woman on the other side of this door waiting for me.” He threw the door open only to be met with shrieks as a wet and naked Rowena ran over and slammed it shut in his face.
Shit, Cas looked hot standing there, backlit from the bathroom, his hair all stuck up and his sleeves rolled up, exposing his taut biceps. They were probably so firm from all the… like… knife fighting. And smiting. Dean swallowed hard.
The door flew open, and Dean stood on the other side. He looked like he was about to tear into Sam again, but then he saw the ski instructor.
something that he hadn’t let himself want almost since the moment they’d met. He could feel the electricity of it coursing through him, the need for him building and he arched back in an attempt to get as close as possible.
They were a bit stiff and sore when they returned to the bunker on Monday night, and everyone waved off suggestions that they hang out and watch a movie or something.
His stomach clenched. It would be just this kind of thing that made Cas decide to fly the coop for a month or two, and honestly, things had been kind of nice around here lately. He wasn’t ready just yet for the inevitable fight and flight.
Canton was only a twenty minute drive south and Castiel’s heart beat faster as he anticipated seeing Dean soon. He was so close. He stepped on the gas, going several miles over the speed limit, and in no time, the small town of Canton came into view. He slowed as he drove through town, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Impala, but he had no such luck.
Dean’s head turned towards Cas and his eyes opened, looking into Cas’ very core as they moved together. Without a word, their mouths brushed together, gently, just for a moment, and then they were kissing properly, exploring each other’s mouths with increasing desperation as the pace of their movements increased.
Sam helped Castiel get some papers, and he found an apartment, just a place to stay until Claire’s wedding. He went to the library some days, and then he volunteered there for a while. He sat with Sam and Eileen at the wedding. Eileen told him she was pregnant. Sam said he hoped Castiel would still be around to meet the baby, and Castiel agreed. It was only a few more months.
Cas’ hands mirrored Dean’s, sliding around his waist to the small of his back, before tugging him closer. The motion caused them to bump together at hip level, and when Cas moaned at the contact, heat flared in Dean’s groin.
“It’s me, Dean,” he began. “This is so hard. I have been keeping this inside for what seemed like forever, but I guess with everything being so dire all the time, it never felt like the right time. I know we’ve had our differences in the past, our trust issues. But with all we’ve been through, I am starting to realize we have to grab happiness when we can. And so, I wanted… I needed to tell you… I love you.”
It was a twenty minute drive back to town. Dean had no way to stop Cas from driving his car, but as it happened, watching Cas with his hands on the wheel of his Baby was almost as exciting as the smiting had been. Probably why he hadn’t let it happen sooner, Dean figured.
“I don’t know if I will be able to judge your temperature accurately without a deeper reading, and I am going to need a more effective lubricant for that,” Cas said.
“It smells… it smells…” Cas sniffed the bag again, practically shoving his nose inside. “It smells so good. I don’t think this is ironwort.”
A few nights later, Cas found Dean sitting at the kitchen island at around eleven, eating leftover pie. Cas walked past him to the freezer and pulled out a small container of ice cream. He dished himself up a small bowl and caught Dean’s eye as he licked the spoon clean. After replacing the container in the freezer, he reached into his pocket and pulled out the small packet, deliberately sprinkling it on his dessert.
“I guess it really isn’t any of my business, though,” Cas continued. “I shouldn’t be thinking about who Dean… and Sam have the hots for. I should be thinking about Guy.”
As though Cas could read his thoughts, he spoke. “I can’t exactly explain it. I wish I could give you something similar, but there isn’t anything exactly like that for humans. Most drugs, from what I understand, that would give a similar effect, last much longer, or have addictive or dangerous properties. The only thing I experienced as a human that was similar, was ejaculation.”
Castiel walked into the library, drawn by the loud sounds of an ad for Raid: Shadow Legends. He knew what he was going to find before he got there.
In all the chaos, somehow, Jack found him. The Shadow wasn’t pleased. It knew the cause of the noise was Jack, and it wasn’t inclined to do anything to assist either him or Castiel, but it held no power over him now that he had the full strength of both Chuck and Amara within him.
Dean paused outside of Sam’s room, watching Cas and Rowena as they walked up the stairs. Rowena went into the left bedroom, and Cas went into the right one. Dean looked at Sam, confused. “I thought they were in the other rooms?” he asked.
Castiel had visited Jimmy and Amelia as well, and although there were no bad feelings between them, it didn’t change the damage he’d done to the Novak family.
Castiel ran the cloth down the length of Dean’s spine, then back up to his neck, slowly. Down again, on the right side, then back up the left, then down the middle again, a little lower this time, nudging the waistband of his underwear down a little. Dean let out a groan.
He brushed against Dean’s prostate, and Dean swore, loudly, before choking out a raspy, “more,” and Cas responded by scissoring his fingers apart, opening him up.
Dean nodded at his mother approvingly. Sam wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Maybe later she’ll make pork nog.” Dean thought about that for a moment, but it didn’t actually sound that bad. He shrugged, then looked over at Cas, who was wandering around the living room, looking at everything.
Dinner was amazing. Or so everyone said. Cas couldn’t really taste anything, although he had eaten quite a lot, since Guy had made it. After everyone had disappeared, Cas had lingered to help tidy up and now he found himself sitting next to Rowena on the sofa in the living room watching Guy poke at the fire.
But, well, Dean’s temperature was slightly elevated. Although it was within normal parameters. Still. He
Sam grimaced, and then reached out to gingerly take the baggie away from Cas. He relinquished it, but his eyes followed the bag, watching it intently as Sam sealed it and then began to dig through the parcel for the packing slip.
Except that left him alone in a room with a half-strength angel who looked like he needed glasses, and who was completely oblivious to the fact that he was driving Dean absolutely insane.
He’d been researching the plant, and once he discovered that it had no harmful properties to humans, he came up with his idea.
and wondering if it would make him look the same as that stupid plant did. All breathy and moaning. Dean had even been thinking about it in the shower, as he jerked off, something he’d managed to avoid doing for over a decade. All these years, and he’d kept Cas out of his spank bank, only to be defeated by some weed.
“Not that I can think of.” Castiel sighed. “What makes it worse, is I can still hear him praying to me. He doesn’t know I’m no longer in the Empty. He talks to me. He… he says so many things he never said before. He told me he loves me.”
Before he drove away, Sam hugged Castiel. “I’m glad you’re here. I’m sorry.” Sam said. He drove off. The dog went with him.
Eventually, however, the sticky mess under Dean grew uncomfortable, and he moved slightly. Cas rolled off him and to the side, facing Dean. He could feel Cas watching him, and eventually he opened his eyes and looked back.
the palm of his hand, and then his fingers, one by one. Dean was fascinated. Cas wiped his hand off on his coat, then leaned back with his hands on the trunk and looked back at the sky.
It was about twenty minutes later when Rowena crept from her room and tapped at Sam’s door. She waited, tapped again, and then finally gave up and went back to her room.
“That’s right. Are you gonna come for me, Dean?” His hand tightened on their cocks and that was all it took to push Dean over the edge. His hips rose off the bed and his head lolled back as wave after wave passed over him. He gripped the sheets and then he gripped Cas’ thighs, digging his nails into the muscle, trying to ground himself.
“I think so,” Sam answered. “Hey Cas, does this ironwort smell off to you?” He handed the open baggie to Cas, who took a sniff. His eyes widened and he took another, deeper sniff.
Even Sam noticed Cas’ unusual gluttony. He stopped eating and just watched as Cas shoveled it all in, then his eyes widened as Cas proceeded to
Cas came running in, drawn by all the ruckus. “What’s going on?” he asked, before noticing Guy in Dean’s bed.
Back in the car, Dean started the engine, taking a moment to enjoy the gratifying growl of the Impala, and turned to back out. Cas was looking at his phone.
“Aaaanghhhehhaa!” Dean replied, somewhat desperately, not entirely sure what Cas meant to do with that finger. He tried to raise an arm to bat Cas away, but it flopped uselessly at his side. Luckily, Cas just slipped his finger into Dean’s mouth. Dean blinked. Cas held it there for a moment, his head tilted to the side, his eyes scrunched in concentration. His finger slid past Dean’s tongue, and even though he couldn’t move, he could still feel it, and, like, two minutes ago Cas was fucking smiting werewolves with these hands, and honestly, the heat flowing through his veins had little to do with any kind of fever.
“I can’t host human diseases, as an angel,” Cas said. Dean shuddered. “I can use one if you prefer, but it may interfere with my… uh… reading.”
“I’m sorry!” Sam was truly mortified. He really should know better. “My Mom told me you had the hots for me.”
to the ghost, and while Dean burned the corpse, he had the pleasure of watching Cas stab and smite almost half a dozen snarling beasts.
Dean tried not to think about it, most of the time. Castiel was thousands of years old, and he wanted to believe that he would continue for thousands more. The powerful, immortal being who showed up in a flash of exploding lights and thunder, the shadow of his great, full wings, the otherworldly blue of his eyes striking terror in Dean that he’d fought to hide. So different than this apparently middle aged man lying on a motel bed in his socks.
Dean let his breath out through his nose, swallowing his groan as Cas slowly eased inside. His finger felt huge, but he moved so slowly there was no burn as he gradually stretched to accommodate it. His other hand still rested on his ass cheek, squeezing gently and rhythmically in time with his finger as he began gently working his finger deeper.
“I know. It was destroyed when the Empty took you. Your vessel, it was… unusual. It was integrated with your grace in a way unlike other angels. With time, I could, perhaps, recreate it. But you’ll be possessing it, like you did with Jimmy originally. You won’t have the same feelings and experiences you did after Chuck rebuilt you.”
“Yeah, sure did. They headed out that way an hour or two ago,” the cop replied, pointing east. “I think they were headed out towards East Canton, from what they said.”
The door banged as Sam came in, carrying several suitcases, and followed by Rowena. “I don’t mind,” he was telling her, trying to keep his grip as she brushed past him and looked around.
fully grown man, and I think he can decide for himself. Besides. Maybe I am looking for something a little more fun for once.”
“Allo,” the stranger said. “I am Guy, your ski instructor.” He had a French accent. Cas liked it. Guy smiled at Cas and looked around the room. Spotting Rowena, he nodded towards her. “Allo,” he greeted her. Rowena slid over and looked him up and down. She held out her hand towards him, and he took it in a friendly handshake. She curled up her nose and extracted her fingers. “I had better take these to the kitchen,” Guy said, indicating the groceries. He picked them up and left the room.
They finished cleaning up the mess - of both the fluid and feather variety - just as Sam and Jack returned from the theatre. Since both of them tended to be night owls, their absence would probably cause more questions than it answered, and Dean knew it wouldn’t be long before Sam came banging on his door. So they both got dressed and headed out into the common area.
He didn’t do the spell and ritual right away when he got home, since Jack had to tell him all the things he’d been doing while Sam was away, and he needed to have a shower and change, and grab a bite to eat. Then he had to double check that Dean hadn’t done anything completely heinous to his laptop. But once all that was sorted, he headed into the storage room and then the kitchen to collect all the items he needed for his spell. He set it all down on the map table, then went to his room to grab the ironwort.
“Sit up a bit, Cas,” he said, and the angel obeyed, sitting back on his heels between Dean’s legs. Dean sat up and wrapped his fingers around Cas’ cock, stroking him, running his fingers over the tip, and sliding his hand down to stroke his balls.
