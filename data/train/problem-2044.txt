They stood at my door one day without prior notice. My own personal task force. After three weeks of taking care for her on my own. Three weeks of sleep deprivation, of forgotten meals, of thousands of bottles, of thousand of nappies, of a million of dirty burp cloths. They looked around, then shared a glance in silent agreement. Father hushing me into the shower, Mummy taking over Maddie.
For the first time since smashing my violin against John's chair back at Baker Street, I am longing for a new one. The sound of my playing used to dispel his nightmares about Afghanistan. It might work again now.
John quickly contemplated what to say. He was so used to ignore his feelings for Sherlock that he almost denied them out of habit. But why should he? Feeling very bold, he nodded, “Yes, you did.”
“Look at point 2, or 3. That's not you he is writing about! Does he even know you?” Mary shouts, and John thinks that Sherlock is not ranting about the man John has become, the one that meanders when things get rough, the one John hates from time-to-time. No, Sherlock has written the email about the man John used to be. The man Sherlock believes is still alive inside of new John, somewhere deep, deep inside. The man who stood beside Sherlock's bed in Edinburgh, hand outstretched.
"Could you … " John starts but stops talking again. His eyes wander to my fingers and then to my violin. He frowns.
Shouldn't he be overjoyed to be alive? Instead, Sherlock only felt tired and gloomy.
He has bad dreams, that much is easy to deduce from the whimpering and the tears but they do not wake him up. I remember that day back in 221b when I tried to comfort him in his sleep and he turned away subconsciously. The memory still hurts.
Oh. A new thought crossed Sherlock's mind. Was it his job as best friend and best man to talk to John about his feelings?
In the kitchen, he finds Sherlock sitting at the table, looking unperturbed. “You all right?” he asks, but is only rewarded with an annoyed glance. Of course he his. He does not comment on Sherlock's slightly shaking hand, but keeps it in mind. Just in case.
We went to the Vogelkoje and to the bench where John was sitting after not boarding the ferry. At the plate that shows you in which direction London lies, John kissed me, long and wet. We even stopped for a last glass of whisky at the Blaue Maus while Emmi was sleeping in her pushing chair.
In Sherlock's head, the TV started playing again, this time in black and white. Mary shooting John. John dying right next to Sherlock, who is forced to watch helplessly. Sherlock standing at John's grave. Sherlock, bitter and broken, sitting in front of a cottage somewhere in the country. Old. Alone.
Only that he doesn't say Sherlock, not really. He stretches the S and slurs the O and it sounds more like “ssssssh'lck”. Sherlock swallows hard. The atmosphere is thick with awkwardness and pain and a loss of words.
“Why would someone try to drive you insane?” I interrupt Janine's stream of words to see if maybe the motive turns out to be interesting. She sighs.
This one had started with John going to see Mary in prison to talk about their baby. After they had been brought into a small room, Mary had started pleading with him not to leave her. John had been completely surprised by that move.
John Watson in lying in his bed, his fiancée by his side, and he is wondering how he can feel homesick while being at home. Maybe home is really where your heart is. He presses closer against Mary, feeling the heat of her body, feeling her hand on his hip, but his mind does not stop spinning around Sherlock's “I love you”.
All this hits home, and after reading it four times, Sherlock feels chivalrous enough not to mind the final paragraph that thanks Mary for her tireless efforts to care for John.
Without telling me which hospital she's at. Or asking me to join him.
“He's … “ I start and have to stop again instantly. How can you find the words to describe someone like John? Impossible. “He's warm and loyal and honest,” I go on then, my words a shallow effigy of the man I love, “a brilliant marksman and the most patient man on earth.”
There are more atrocities listed up, but studying John's expression becomes more important that Mary's past. I deduce that he wants to say something important, but can't bring himself to open his mouth. Usually I need a Tube carriage and a bomb to make him talk about it. (But he said he loved me, didn't he?) (Shouldn't that help me make him talk? If only I knew how.)
The world was blurry, shifting in and out of focus again and again. There was a figure leaning over him, talking to him, touching him. John? Sherlock concentrated on him, and really, when his vision became better he recognized him. There was something wrong with him except the smell, something about his hair, but Sherlock could not focus on that. He was too busy to fully regain consciousness.
Not sure if the dreaded “Christmas Carol Singing” has been a disaster or not. Hearing twelve people sing out of tune for nearly twenty minutes insulted my skilled musical ears. Commented on that after developing a severe headache. Used non-Christmas words to express everyone's level of incompetence. Donovan challenged me to prove that I could do better. I did. Everybody was silent after my solo performance of O Little Town of Bethlehem and O Come O Come Emmanuel. John was looking at me with a funny expression. Could have been admiration, mixed with heavy feelings. Or maybe he is developing a cold. Every one else was quiet for nearly three minutes afterwards. Don't quite understand why.
“He won't get any more polite than that,” John quipped, and for some absurd reason, it made Sherlock feel happy again. Just like the old days.
That had indeed been surprisingly unselfish, John thought, and a little warm feeling spread inside of him. Don't show it. Moran shook his head: “No, John, all he wanted was a sidekick without handicap. That's the only reason he did that.” Then the other man's expression became somewhat painful for a second. So he had realised by himself how he had just admitted that Sherlock wanted John, for whatever reason.
Sherlock smiled and relaxed into his pillow. No Eurus. No crazy escape room plot on a lonely island prison. No poor -
John quickly explains our situation and is assured that a rescue team will be sent at once along with an ambulance. Might take a moment because the GPS of Mary's mobile tells Mr Super Secret that we are far out in the woods.
I close my eyes and my ears take over. It is loud inside the plane now, you can hear the air rushing by outside, and people screaming and screaming, and I am not sure if John says “I love you” or not. There is nothing I can to except hiding my head between my knees and hope for the best.
The first one is Lestrade who hands Sherlock a manila folder from an unsolved case. John's interested glance is the only reason Sherlock bothers to look at it. He needs three minutes to find out that the acid attack was carried out by an actor who acted as ambassador of Abu Dhabi using a dead spy's alias. Ridiculous, really, for even among his ancient ancestors there is no one with an Arabian background, plus you cannot be the ambassador of a city. And the fact that he kept saying appetiser instead of aperitif should have told Lestrade everything he had to know. Stupid moron.
When the worst part of the pain was over, he weakly opened his eyes again. Moran was watching him closely, clearly enjoying way too much what he saw. John doubted that killing those people fifteen years ago had cost him quite an effort. He tried to catch his breath again, but this time Moran seemed unwilling to give him a break.
Looking at him feels just as bad as looking at the crash site.
“You're welcome” John answered, and after a while he asked curiously: “What for?” This earned him the first “John, really?”-glance in a long time: “For saving your life.”
After a while, I cannot help but detect a problem: I am no longer sure that we will make it out of here alive. Not good, that notion. When John asks me about it, I deny it. I don't dare to deduce if he believes me or not.
It has been quite a while since I caused that much publicity. And only now do I realize how much I missed it.
it's been a while, but here it finally is. Sorry to let you all waiting so long.
Instead she had looked at him silently, eyes wide open with shock
I am always grateful for all who subcribed, give kudos or leave comments. Hope the next chapters won't scare you away.
Emmi stops my heavy thoughts by waking up. She no longer cries when she opens her eyes in the morning. Instead, she searches for me, rolls over and hands me her cuddle doggy. For some reason it delights her to no end when I kiss it before I kiss her. So Doggy gets his kiss but before I can kiss her, too, the bedroom door opens (slowly).
“Exactly. Only that he lacked your ... goodness. He adored me up to a point where he would have done anything for me. He even went out to get me cocaine if needed, took it with me against his conviction so we would have something more in common.” Sherlock turned his back on John, looking out of the huge window, his slim frame picturesquely surrounded by the silhouette of the Eternal City.
John is still smirking when I return, now dressed. (Love how the purple shirt still makes his pupils dilate.) The little laughter lines around his eyes make my heart lose about two pounds of weight, and before long I am finally deeply concentrating on the Enigma.
He hopped around excitedly, eyed the corpse at the desk with critical interest and disappeared for several minutes while John took some more time to look at the late Adigi. The upper part of his body was lying on the desk, his dead eyes wide open, the large, strangely smeared puddle of blood underneath his head turned to brown. Flies were buzzing around his head. It smelled. Italy in spring probably wasn't the right place to let a corpse lie around uncovered for a couple of hours.
He watched Sherlock think about it. “I would have forgiven her for your sake,” he heard him whisper then.
Of course he will.
“I cannot come when you look at me,” he had once told me. An assessment that turned out to be false. He had not been able to come when other people looked at him, never able to let go, to let control slip away completely. For some incomprehensible reason he feels safe in my presence, and the first time he came under my observant stare, he was nothing but surprised.
Next to me, John is already checking flight plans and trains on his mobile. The flight attendants start handing out drinks again. I can feel our plane changing direction, taking a long curve to the left. That must be the diverting course.
“Yes,” I say, trying not to look too pleased. I fail.
“John,” Sherlock murmured, still caught in his dream. So it was about him again. A chill ran down John's back. Was he dying again in Sherlock's nightmare?
In his mind, he tells John about it, and John is all admiration and marvel. Sherlock feels a clarity of mind he has last felt when taking cocaine.
He never does. Not yet.
He rubs my back for a long time. When he steps back a little to look at me, he has to grin. “Lord, Sherlock, you really need to think about sick puppies or cold showers or something.” I follow his glance down to my pelvis. Apparently the arousal has not subsided along with the tension. He laughs quietly (that wonderful laughter that always reaches his eyes and his soul). “I can't let you walk out with a boner like that,” he grins.
I long to touch him but he is still out of my reach. So instead, I touch myself. We both get incredibly aroused by that.
Thanks to all those who gave me the words for this wonderful promt. I would have never written about an absent-minded archbishop and his axe without you.
This time the pain was even worse than the two times before. John felt his defence slowly going down. The sweat on his forehead was burning as it was running into his eyes, mixing with the tears that had started to build. His breathing was hollow. His vision was drastically dimmed. Don't slip into shock now, he ordered his body, with little success. He needed something to hold on to. Something...
“Oh, I'm not talking about all those little hints that he didn't care. Like ruining your dates or using your things like they belonged to him or pushing you around.” Moran moved closer, stroking John's cheek with his thumb, causing another sting as he touched the bruises. “He never thought about you when he stood on that roof.” What was he implying?
And so John got regular texts from “Mary”, who was obviously enjoying a trip around the world (“Why would people pay that much money to climb a tower that leans?” “Why are people proud of the fact that their dispensable village hosts the world's biggest ball of wool?”), that more often than not included a hidden plea for John to remain mourning.
He smiles. “I know,” he informs me, with the trace of an arrogant smile on his lips. Funny how much I love him like that.
“I want you to see me,” he says, blindly reaching for the lube we brought along with good sense. He fails to reach it, so I get it myself and hand it over. That creates a little break, a moment to realise what we are doing. Our eyes meet and suddenly it is not only my body that needs him to be inside me. It is my soul that reaches out for him, that needs him to be as close as can be, that needs him to heal my final wound.
When the door opened, he was ready to yell at anybody who would dare to talk to him. But instead of a nurse John entered the room, looking glad and apologetic and questioning at the same time, the way only John could, and Sherlock's anger melted into something softer he could not define.
Without further comment I manoeuvre the pushchair over the sand and we proceed in silence. Emmi quickly forgets the incident, watches the birds, and happily exclaims every time some of them fly above us.
“Trouble in paradise?” Mycroft asked, “Are there shadows looming over the little Watson family?”
Then he decides to clutch those painful memories, for they give him the drive he needs to challenge Moriarty's network.
* * *
When we manage to identify Cheng Wong he smiles. Honestly. With bright eyes.
In June conceals himself in a coat check room of the Caring Cross station, waiting to take down one more part of Moriarty's net, one of the last left. He has to wait for a long time, and in the meantime allows himself to fantasise about how John figures it all out by himself. How he comes up with the brilliant solution of how Sherlock survived the fall.
and then I am just standing there. I cannot bring myself to play a single note.
“Of how to go on after being shot. It covered a span of about two and a half years and included us forgiving Mary.”
“It is wounded, but will recover,” I sigh, and lead her back to the kitchen table. “About that Blue Book ...”
Author's note: As I don't have access to the same data bases Sherlock has, I could only make up the dead sailors of course. Both ships, the Irma and the New York are likely to have sailed in the vicinity of Amrum at the right time, but I don't have the slightest idea if one of their crew was reported missing.
She is allowed to see me once, and John leaves us alone while I (falsely) assure her that I will talk him around this time. When she leaves and he comes back, he is strangely quiet. “Mycroft has met me at the cafe,” he explains, unaware that he is playing with my fingers while he speaks. (I let him, never able to resist his touch, no matter how casual.) “Looks like the prenatal test was not altogether our doctor's idea.”
Now that is anti-climatic. He fumbles for his mobile, and sends Sherlock a text, “Where are you?”
My blood pressure is indeed sinking. I close my eyes, only for a second. It won't be long now. When I open them again, I see the fear on Jon's face. I wish he would not have to watch.
After Sherlock heroically solves the case in less than 24 hours, they turn in at the homey house bar of the hotel, and John teaches Sherlock all he knows about whiskey. Which might be a bad idea, for after the first glass John is already having fantasies of Sherlock, giving him a hand job in a hot bath or in front of a hearth fire.
It turns out that my assessment of the places John would like was right. I can see his body losing tension the very moment we enter the trail through the dunes. When someone at the bakery asks him (in broken English) if he has already visited the lighthouse he only snorts. And he forces me to stay at the freshwater lake in the dunes for more than two hours because he thinks it is the most peculiar thing to have a lake that close to the sea.
I adore him but sometimes he is a stupid idiot.
His repeatedly losing consciousness is driving me insane and I think there are tears rolling down my face again. But there is no time to drown in pain. I lean his body (gently) against the backrest of his seat, open the overhead locker (only a little twisted) and get out our jackets and his backpack (ugly thing, blue synthetic, but containing all our papers). I wrap him into his jacket (with some effort) while he only stares at me with these damn unfocused eyes. Then I (clumsily) get him to his feet.
John. Thinking of him hurts terribly. I should probably do what Mrs Hudson had suggested: loathe him for leaving me, loathe him for taking Emmi with him, loathe him for giving up. Instead, I am deeply sorry for him. (As if feeling my own pain isn't enough to bear.) I wonder how he is carrying on.
It takes him a long time to find the right words, “We survived a plane crash.”
He leapt back to attention,
John spends some time with us, then prepares food. We eat in front of the TV. (Bad habit, that, but the only way to make Rosie be something similar to quiet for a little while.) She can choose, so we watch that little girl travelling to a fantasy world through her closet to help a nice dinosaur, and then we are forced to endure that American puppet singing about the dragon with bad breath.
He is still trying to comprehend. “So, you had a … what? A sex fantasy about someone else?”
He was still standing in front of the bed. Too far away for John's liking. Out of his reach. When John tried to sit up to reduce the distance between them, he regretted that instantly. Despite the narcotics he got, there was a sharp pain in his stomach. Stupid.
Janine gives me an unreadable glance. “Pretty much the same thing you were planning to do to her, isn't it? Taking the baby away from her?”
Sherlock looked away. “Yes,” he whispered after a while.
(trying not to sound too disgusted, keep voice neutral)
Who was she?
She was babbling sleepily, probably telling John's jumper all about her day. A warm feeling spread inside of John. Who would have thought that he would love being a father?
But he is not a poet, so instead he introduces another theme to the song, one that speaks of all the unexpectedly soft feelings Sherlock gets when thinking of John's hair. The tempo changes from allegro to presto when Sherlock starts to wonder if John's pubic hair colour is that fascinating, too.
“You will be watched officially, and not allowed to leave London,” he explains, “but otherwise free to do whatever is necessary to solve the 'Moriarty Enigma'” As if I would leave London voluntarily. And how does he know I am calling the case the Moriarty Enigma in my head? Anyway. The thought of going home, of finally going home eases my mind instantly. I can even feel my shoulders relaxing, and there is a smile on my face I cannot hide. Happily (yes, I have to admit it, I am happy) I turn around and look at John -
Then I turn around the bend and see -
But well, the list is as endless as it is fruitless. It all boils down to one fact: John has been responsible but distant. I figured out that one before, thank you.
When I finally arrive at John's room, find him sitting on his bed fully dressed (clothes Mycroft sent him, no doubt), watching the news. Somehow, he feels me coming in, looks at the door just at the right moment, and smiles. (And his smile touches my heart and melts something that built up over the last few hours.)
How I collapsed when they took his body away. How Daddy and John had to carry me inside the bathroom to take a shower after thirty-eight minutes. How scared John was for my sanity.
“What?” he says, for he did not hear a single word the doctor said. Ponders apologising but dismisses it. He's surely not the first one to be absent-minded here in this dreadful room.
I fly upstairs, taking two steps at a time. For the first time in nineteen weeks. Maddie giggles against my shoulder. In the living room, I come to a sudden stop. Look at the bookshelf. And suddenly I realize the mistake I've made those last nineteen weeks.
That is exactly when my mobile chimes again. John fishes it out of my pocket and shows it to me. Mycroft once more. Sent a picture of John's old room, miraculously turned into a crib.
The shifting stops and John takes a deep breath.
And John (INNER JOHN!) slowly descending to the bed, laying next to me, becoming warm and loving and caring again, takes me into his arms, murmurs words of admiration into my ears, and before I can even think of leaving my mind palace I am falling asleep. Fuming inner Mary the last (wonderful) thing I see.
On the morning of the third day, Mummy "accidentally" leaves her mail account open. There is a mail from my father, telling her that he will surely be home today. That he will reach the last ferry if the traffic stays low. That she should gently prepare me for the fact that he will come back without John.
The rest of this night is a blur of noises and shadows and wind and tears and adrenaline and sickness and loss. When my world comes back into focus again, I am sitting in a holding cell, completely alone.
I can feel his hands on my bare chest now. They are not exactly caressing, more … exploring. No, taking back lost territory. Gentle, but firm. I am half hard by the time he reaches the waistband of my trousers. He is so close that I can feel his breathing on my skin.
After another moment, Sherlock broke the kiss and let himself slump against John's body. “John,” he whispered, sounding astonished and pleased.
I can tell from the way she holds her hands that she will definitely not get the career boost she is hoping for.
Then I remember falling apart in his arms the other week in my cell. All he did was holding me and (probably) saying something soothing. So I wrap myself around John, press my cheek against his, carefully start rocking a bit and murmur something down the line of “Everything will be fine”. Apparently, I am better at holding and rocking than at back patting, for John relaxes against my body and starts sobbing really badly.
It takes John a long time to calm down again. “Sorry,” he sniffs after a while, “I don't know what ...”
And there was more: Why had he imagined a sister?
“We survived,” I repeat, returning the pressure to his hand, taking in the heat he is radiating, drowning in his wonderfully focused eyes. My whole body gives in all of a sudden, and I have to lean against him. Our foreheads touch, a soft reminder of the moment we became a couple. I allow myself to close my eyes for a moment, ignore the world, and only feel John's skin touch mine.
He looked over to the living room too. A body seemed to be lying on the floor, covered with the blanket that used to lie on the sofa. It was light blue with a floral pattern.
“Imagine my surprise when I found out who was still alive, disabling the other members of our spider web.”
I take a deep breath, because yes, there is the one thing I still need.
I can tell that he wants nothing more than to go out, vent some steam on his own for a while but he stays with us. Something terrible could happen to us while he is away. So instead of seeking for the solitude he needs, he does not leave us alone for a second. He even lets the door slightly open when he has to go to the bathroom. I pretend not to notice, and he pretends to believe that I do not notice.
WARNING WARNING WARNING
Even now he could not bring himself to think the unthinkable. But he didn't have to. Sherlock had woken up, and he would be fine.
Fatigue seems to fall from the sky (like we did not long ago). My legs stumble, and I can barely turn around without falling to my knees. I notice pain somewhere in my body, several places hurt but I cannot tell which. How can I ever make it back all the way to John?
Into the bathroom they had just checked out together. Only that two minutes ago there had not been another post-it sticking on the shower cubicle. “8 o'clock, Taverna Del Teatro” it read. John grabbed his gun, but before he could call for Sherlock, his world went black.
Mary looked from John to Sherlock and back to John. “How is it going today?” she asked then.
Sherlock's heart is beating wildly in his chest.
This chapter was supposed to me much longer but it has been really some time since my last update. So I decided to split it in half. That way you can read the first part already while I finish the second.
She looks at me, only mildly surprised, and grins. “You are welcome, Sherlock Holmes.”
“No, it is not,” he states, and without looking at me he adds, “it's Emilia.”
Yasmin does not seem to realize my abashment. Instead she goes on, “And he is stuck with this mean bitch, instead of being free for you.” She also misses the meaningful look Janine gives me over the rim of her tea cup. “Oh, dear, you would make such a lovely couple. It's really a shame that he married that cunt. Especially now that she's ...”
And on the other hand she is deliberately avoiding a certain topic. I am intrigued. What can it be? It becomes even more interesting when I deduce that Janine is always trying to make her talk about it. And I still don't know what it is all about. Feels a bit like watching a fencing match without seeing the rapier.
I have spent three weeks in almost complete isolation. My senses are completely overwhelmed now. I try to stay calm, really, but the constant buzzing and bustling around of Mycroft's minions is scratching on my nerves. It leaves a residue inside my brain. When I am (sent) home (by my ridiculous brother), I can still hear it. Feel it.
Then the cab arrives and takes me to the hospital. The radio is turned on, and I cannot bring myself to make the driver turn it off. I could make him change the channel or turn it off but that would not be normal, right? Listening to the news is normal. (There is nothing new anyway. The pilots turned off the wrong engine, people died, the voice recorder and the flight data recorder were found. Did Dan Miller work last night at all?)
She waits for me to hide my (profound) disappointment before she comes back into the living room. We do not have to talk about it. She knows my sadness and I know her pity.
“He never minded me doing this...” Sebastian reached out for Sherlock now, cupping his face
John (whose headache is back) squeezes my hand when we leave the train, and I steer him towards the cabs. When the cab driver (who is also listening to the news about our crash) wants to know where to take us, I give him Mike's address. John squeezes my hand again over the children's seat in the middle of the back row. (We always catch cabs with children's seats when we want to travel with Rosie. No idea how Mycroft can do that.) John is longing to see our child, and so am I.
He always makes sure that we talk about the future, make plans that we will probably (almost certainly) never realise. “We can turn my old room into a nursery,” he suggests and makes me talk about wall papers and carpets and changing tables. “I want to introduce you to my parents,” he smirks and laughs at my horror-stricken face.“We need to talk about how to go on once the baby is born,” he says but flatly refuses to do so now, because there will be enough time for it later on.
We stand next to each other in (rather comfortable) silence for a while until nature seems to have pity on us. A small object catches my eyes.  "Oh, look, Sherlock," Mummy exclaims, "it's an acteon tornatilis. One of the most seldom nautili. When you were little we spent weeks searching for one, do you remember?"
They look at me when I enter my living room, and all activity comes to a halt. "With so many of you here I am sure there is at least one who has time to make me some tea," I say, unimpressed and walk into the bathroom as gracefully as a naked man can.
Instead of posting a new chapter I need to apologize to  my readers.
I move my head a little so I can see his face in the moonlight. He does not want to talk about it but he offers it anyway. I have missed the real John endlessly.
Nothing lasts forever, though. After a while, neither of us are hungry any more and Mary sends Big Boy away.
Big thanks to my wonderful betas!
Then he starts with the chest compressions, steady and deep, then does mouth-to-mouth respiration. The back of his mind registers how wrong it feels that John's chest is not moving on its own and that John's usually so expressive face is lifeless. The better part of his mind tells him that he will not be able to keep up CPR with this intensity for another seven minutes.
“I always watched the sunrise, every morning. Everything was so peaceful then and … I was longing for peace, Sherlock, so much that I thought … “ He swallows. So do I. Unlike last night, his voice is completely free of tears now. It is all right, because I am silently crying for both of us.
John does not love her. But she loves him, and she wants to take care for him and the majority of his so-called friends kind of expects him to fall for her. So he meanders again, and they are a couple by May.
It soon becomes obvious that the only way out is through the door. And the only way to reach the door is to overpower Mary somehow when one of us is free. Maybe when she changes our positions, or when she plays one of the games she surely has in mind.
Because Sherlock is lonely, yes, but John needs to be, has to be all right. If he were not, it would destroy Sherlock, more profoundly than Moriarty could have done it. It is a caring notion, one Sherlock is not used to. It challenges the opinion he has of himself.
I watched the little “Did you miss me?“ clip on my mobile before landing, my mind racing. Who sent it, and why? There is no doubt that Moriarty is dead, of course. Have seen the brain dripping out of his head after he blew away the back of his skull. Know that Mycroft had his body taken away. So what could be the reason behind this campaign? I don't know. Interesting.
… squeeze a little …
“Who was your first?” he asked quietly after a while. Instantly, for just one brief moment, John was back there in the officer's mess that day, still freezing from a chilly day, that boy standing in the middle of a crowd...
“I think so,” I answer, a bit surprised at how rough my voice sounds. Must have been out cold for more than one day then. Hard to tell without any natural light in here. I raise my head as high as possible to take a closer look at our prison. No window, only one door. The room is not bigger than approximately five square meters. Bare walls, cast concrete floor. A cellar room? Likely.
“Then I heard your voice in my head, from the rooftop, you know? Telling me this was your note. And I remember how angry I was when I thought you were dead, how mad at you for throwing away your life and how disappointed in myself for not being able to stop you. And then I thought that the only way to end my life would be to get my gun and blow away my head right there, right now because I would never find the courage to do it if I kept thinking about you.”
So I am located amongst the most dangerous prisoners of the UK. How fitting. Not that I am likely to meet any of them. After my (short, but disastrous) time at Belmarsh Prison in 1998, it was understood between Mycroft and me that contact with other prisoners should be avoided at all costs.
When I pick up John at eight, he has taken a shower, is shaved and wearing fresh clothes. His bag is not unpacked. He does not smile or touch me but follows me without resistance.
Two of them are already emulating his elegant movements, others are eyeing him from the far. Orks on the other hand seem to be completely unimpressed by Sherlock's extravagance. Probably because Sherlock is so much like an elf himself, John muses, thinking of his esthetic features, his unearthly skin, his beautiful eyes.
Caught completely by surprise, he opened the door and looked at a sheepishly grinning John Watson.
We share another smile, and then I lean forward and press a chaste little kiss on her cheek. “Thank you, Janine.”
His hand lets go of my cock and moves to my backside. There is always this moment of silent communication, wordlessly discussing who will do what, and like so many times before, John's need fit mine perfectly. I nod, knowing he does not need that sign of agreement for he already understood. He smiles at me, and starts to widen me as gently as he can.
(Oh!)
They sat together in silence for a while until another therapist told them it was time for another terribly humiliating exercise inflicted on Sherlock. This time, the name of the game was “Sitting up”. It included Sherlock having to flex all his damaged muscles and to use his almost useless arms to stabilize himself. It caused so much pain he almost vomited but did not move his body even close to an upright position.
and had returned now to do so once more. They were sweeping the underground complex
Encouraged by this deduction, Sherlock decides to take a risk, for he has always been a believer in the “No risk, no fun” thing. He hugs John. It takes a moment, but then John hugs back. Strongly. Sherlock's stomach does a wild roller coaster ride. John's hair does not smell like John, it smells like Mary. But he feels like John, very much so.
She beams at the compliment. “Aw, you are really as charming as the good doctor always states on his blog.”
There is an awkward silence for a while. Then she disappears into the back of her laundrette and returns with an envelope. Still hesitates to hand it to me. “Mary is relentless, Sherlock dear,” she says with gravity, “If I give you this, you need to promise me that you will protect me from her.”
“You got off the ferry to stay,” I explain, and he nods, like accessing a long forgotten memory.
How do you react to a (true) statement like that? I do not know so I stick to plain honesty. “Yes,” I say again.
No warnings this time. Well, no warnings regarding violence or stuff. I've been told that you need one or two handkerchiefs for this chapter. But then, you are all rather used to that by now, right?
On the other hand, she is able to play on her own longer than a nearly nine months old infant needs to be able to. Probably indicating that John spent more time watching her than playing with her.
“Of course we can,” he heard John say with lots and lots of affection in his voice. “I am sorry for lashing out. I was just …”
Here it finally is. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that it took me so long - and how happy I am that Like A Landslide is no longer a WIP.
Me, stupidly disguised as waiter, seconds before telling him I'm back.
Thanks to all who patiently followed and to all whose comments encouraged me not to give up.
Then, time slowly picks up speed again, as John stumbles towards Sherlock, checks for and finds a pulse, calls for an ambulance, moves Sherlock into recovery position, talks softly to him while waiting for help, and Sherlock still does not move at all.
“This is how it goes,” she explains. “You and I will have a little fun with this thing here.”
He closes the space between us and only stops when he is so close that I can smell the red wine in his breath. “I know I couldn't, last time. But now I will ...”
Only now do I realise what Daddy must have seen all along. In real life I haven't been in the backyard yet. Why not?
Time continued to pass, the staring went on. The joints between the tiles were black, but frayed.  The world left John alone for a while. After another eternity, the door was opened once more. Molly. Shaken and sad, eyes red and swollen. Again, he looked away after a fraction of a second, realizing that he was simply not able to stand looking at her.
Sherlock's whole body tensed at the mentioning of the pool incident. So he had believed John to be Moriarty, if only for a second? A little detail that none of them had felt necessary to share with Mycroft until now, not even Moriarty. Charming.
It is a good sign, daddy tries to tell me. It shows that my mind is trying to come to terms with what happened to us. Yet, they are shaking me to the core.
“There is something soothing about watching her drinking her milk,” he had told me.
John just shakes his head in (faked) annoyance. “How can I compete with hundreds of strangers?” he asks jokingly.
“Don't,” John says (to my surprise). I frown, and he explains, “Don't talk, Sherlock. It's not necessary. You are sure we will make it out of here, right?”
“I thought about killing you then, but maybe that will no longer be necessary.”
When he goes into the kitchen to get some water to stop the tickling in his throat, his eyes fall on a piece of paper that hangs out of the pocket of Sherlock's coat. It's a copy of his letter to Mary, and some of the points are marked with pink ink with glitter in it.
Can I believe that? Of course. It's Mycroft. He knows things. That's what he does. Did. Anyway. She is gone for good. The enormous amount of relief is overwhelming. But my hand is still stuck on that door handle. I try to open the door, but it is locked. I let my hand sink down and turn away.
“I love you,” John answers, his words still painfully slurred.
He must have done some research on him, John mused, thinking about his choice of victims, and yet he underestimated the fact that John had been a soldier. Only that could explain why Moran had neither blindfolded nor gagged John when he had tied him up. It was this realisation that made John hope to come out of this alive.
Good. Sherlock willingly obeyed. He relaxed a little, waiting for his strength to return, did not try to speak for a while. If John said everything was all right, it was.
I never fell asleep that night, and in the morning I observed that John had not slept at all too, and I failed to deduce.
When he finally reaches home, he is nearly hyperventilating, but is still not sure if with happiness or with fear. He jumps up the stairs, opens the door with shaking hands – and finds John sleeping on the sofa. His face is more relaxed than Sherlock has seen it in months, and he looks at least five years younger than only last week.
John jerked. Mycroft was sitting on the chair next to the sofa, a coffee pot and John's favourite mug placed on the side table. John's heart was pounding in his ears.
“I don't know what to do with you,” Sherlock confesses, and John's smile widens. Of course, John knows what to do, and so Sherlock generously lets him take the lead.
Sherlock stops trying to free them for a moment. He must also be thinking about point three now, which reads, “John needs a certain amount of danger in his life. He gets restless and cantankerous if too secure. Danger makes him forget his own imperfections.”
“I wasn't there that night,” I say quietly. God does my voice sound small. He nods.
“...confirm that there was smoke seen coming from the left engine. Why the pilots decided to turn off the right engine of the Airbus A 320-200 instead is not yet clear. Although already heading for Leeds Bradford International Airport, the plane was still high in the air when the left engine stopped working and the plane crashed down. Investigators of the AAIB have arrived at the scene already.”
Also been informed that Christmas presents have been bought for me. Spend eight hours of deducing what they would be. John spent eight hours pretending that I'm being wrong all the time. Couldn't figure out when he was telling the truth and when not. He's amused now. I'm not.
Breakfast is served before I can get angry.
“Is there anything you would not do for me?” I need to know.
High velocity impacts usually make it hard to identify the victims. The fact that John's body and mine might get inseparably scrambled touches my heart. It's poetic, in a cruel way. I look at him one last time, take in all I can. My final gulp of air before drowning. Then I brace for impact.
Then John chokes, on his blood most likely, and closes his eyes for a second. You can see how hard he is fighting to open them again. His breath is becoming more shallow and Sherlock can read in his eyes that he slowly realises that he, like Sherlock, is about to die.
“You love me,” Sherlock said, and shook his head in amazement.
There are oh so many emotions flickering over his face. Love and fear and regret and hope and so many more that I cannot name them all.
“Of course. Sherlock, we are going to raise that child together. Of course we will find its name together.” I am sure there are words for all these hot feelings that are filling my chest right now, but I cannot find a single one that would fit.
Steps in the alley, someone shouting. The beeping sound in Sherlock's ears is too loud to understand but the resonance the voice leaves in Sherlock's stomach tells him it is John. He wishes he could raise his head for he is longing to see John's face.
“Let's finish cleaning you,” he commands, voice rough but steady, without any bitterness in it.
So, where to go, to the front of the plane or towards the tail? When I look back, I can see the soft hill we must have touched when crash-landing. The tail section of the Airbus has broken off. I turn my head to the front section, and there are trees. So the plane has broken at least into three parts. (That’s where the dust is coming from, then. Earth, dispersed at the impact, still filling the air, entering the cabin through the enormous holes at both ends.)
Yes. It is time to go home.
I contemplate calling him but that would only cause him more pain. Not an option. Can I make any other kind of noise to wake him? I am tied to the ground with mountaineering cords. When I move my feet they barely produce a soft sound. Stomping my heels or the back of my hand onto the ground is not loud enough. The only thing I can to is bang my head on the concrete floor.
The silence stretches for a while. Finally, Janine looks up from her mobile and gives everybody an apologetic smile. “Sorry if I'm keeping you from something important.”
“I need your help, Sherl,” she tells me after I have led her into the kitchen, her hand still resting on my arm.
But you have been waiting for this chapter for so long and I am so proud of it this time. So I'll try and upload it from my smartphone.
The confrontation with Mary goes better than I expected. I know (theoretically) that John no longer loves her. But seeing the full display of her usually well-hidden viciousness (she knows of course how much bending down to pick up that coin hurts me) only helps John to show his anger.
Sherlock spends two days trying to convince himself that he needs John for selfish reasons. He needs him for support, for company, for recognising right and wrong. In the end he has to admit that his unfulfilled real love has made him strangely selfless.
“I won't,” I promise him, “I won't leave you again. Never. Please believe me. From now on I will be careful and stay out of harm's way and never do something stupid without talking to you about it first and ...”
Mycroft took his time to arrive, probably busy helping to get Sherlock out of the country one way or the other. When he finally showed up, all serious and subtly grieving, John had been awake for nearly 48 hours, not counting the little naps he had taken at the laboratory, and he really didn't need brilliant acting skills to appear broken. He was still wearing the same clothes he had on when Sherlock had jumped, still neither shoes nor socks, hadn't washed or shaved, had done nothing other than sitting in his chair, staring at the carpet.
When John finally speaks, his voice sounds calm but serious. “You have been waiting for me,” he states.
I cannot help thinking how much we have in common, and wonder how our relationship would have developed had she not turned out to be what she is.
Adjusting to driving on the wrong side of the street takes me only a moment. I want to look into the rear view mirror and watch Little Me, slowly falling asleep, head resting comfortably on Mycroft's shoulder. Instead, I remember leaving England via Calais three days after jumping off St. Bart's. I cannot help but notice how arrogant I was back then. Thinking I could go and destroy the spider's web within a few months, and then simply come back and confess my newly discovered love to John.
At least, returning to Mrs Hudson is reviving his spirits a bit. She cries and hugs him and slaps him across the cheek for being dead and kisses him on the other cheek for being alive. She makes clear that she will no longer be there to provide room service and then leaves to bring him tea. She does everything John should have done. It hurts. Still, it feels good.
“At home,” John writes, and adds, just to make sure Sherlock gets the point for he is not a genius when it comes to love, “or so I hope. 221b.”
And then it suddenly stops. There is a second of silence. It is as if all people stop screaming to listen to the engine and hear nothing. Both engines have stopped working now. We are still about 27,000 feet high and both engines have stopped working. I do not see how we can survive.
Only a few days, and I know Amrum as well as I know London.
I snap out of my trail of thoughts. “Get my mobile,” I whisper (out of habit, in order not to wake up Emilia). John reaches for it and hands it to me, but (for no apparent reason) my fingers are shaking too badly to dial.
24th November
Unpleasant memories surface. Holidays when I was seven. A thoughtless deduction about how Daddy smelled one day. Mummy crying, Mycroft frantically trying to pick up the pieces after she left to sleep in a hotel for an unknown number of nights. Little Sherlock not understanding why everybody was angry at him. Mummy and Mycroft had taught him how to deduce, hadn't they? So why were they furious at him for deducing about Daddy and the Bird Girl in the dunes?
With a cold smile still on his lips, Moran started to strangle him forcefully. “No,” John choked out, not needing to pretend to sound panicked. He involuntarily tried to move away from his grip, but he was tied up so tightly he could barely moved at all. Moran wouldn't have taken the time to tie him up had he really wanted to kill him immediately afterwards. John adhered to that thought with all his strength while his body was starting to twitch uncontrollably. He couldn't breathe, couldn't stop his body from trying to get air, his torso rocking violently within its restrains. His ears were ringing, and bright spots were dancing in front of his eyes while the room was growing darker.
“I wish I could give you something equally meaningful,” he whispers.
John's voice gets more and more distracting. When ignoring it becomes more exhausting than reacting, I slowly open my eyes. He is facing me, tied to the chair again, his eyes red, marks of tears on his cheeks. His voice is raw. Has been talking to me for a long time, apparently.
We continue until Emmi's impatient wailing breaks the spell.
I spend days looking around the flat aimlessly, only to accidentally find a sock or a toy block or a dummy that was left behind. Those days are the worst.
I can hear him using capital letters. Of course it would be WRONG, and if there is one thing John Watson is incapable of doing, then it is something WRONG. (Would I love him if he would be willing to do something WRONG?) (Is there be anything to stop me from loving him?) (I hope so.) (No, I don't.)
Damn, damn, damn. This was not good. This was really, definitely not good. John took a deep breath, steeled himself, and went to the living room to pick up his official mobile.
Never before has it been so tempting to ask Mycroft for help. A helicopter would do, or road barriers to keep the direct route from Gravesend to Baker Street free of traffic. Or some hand grenades to handle the annoyingly slow commuters in front of the cab.
(unconsciously moving the chair away from me just slightly, disappointment runs deeper than he admits to himself, need to fix it, how? seldom tried to fix something like that).
1. John prefers rooms warm. Make sure the indoor temperature is always around 21°. He will not complain when too cold, so keep an eye on the thermostat.
According to John, I still owe her something despite the cottage. “Your timing is a bit unfortunate,” I start, but Janine interrupts me instantly.
A nurse had to tell John all he missed back at 221b, about Mrs Hudson knocking down Mary, about Sherlock frantically trying to keep John's bleeding at bay, about being brought to hospital to have an emergency operation that saved his life.
John cannot be replaced in Sherlock's life, especially not by that emotionless wreck he has become. This new version of John looks like his life can be abbreviated “R.I.P.” He looks dead inside.
The beach in front of me becomes translucent for a moment. The idea of Baker Street can be guessed but remains vague and unreal.
Only that Sherlock knew that for three point eight seconds John's death had been more likely than his survival. If John had dodged that attack only slightly slower he would be dead now.
Yes, of course. I wouldn't be of any help in my current state, still too weak to stand on my own. So before leaving without me, John makes sure that I'm leaning against the wall so I won't collapse.
I nod, and his face relaxes a bit.
Our eyes meet, and he hesitates only for the fraction of a second before adding, “There is a complete set with basic equipment for baby Watson stored at one of my facilities. It should match the doctor's mundane taste and fits perfectly into his old room at 221b.” He gives me a little private smile, “The carrier is colour-coordinated with most of your shirts.”
He considered throwing his tea cup at the door just to make a point, but what was the sense in that? For a moment Sherlock longed for the times when he would have thrown it without even thinking about it.
Somehow it has always been understood that Emmi alone will receive Christmas presents this year. My parents are still mourning the loss of their son (when they think I am not looking), and John is way too unstable for a blunt display of affection, and I am … well, myself, so I never really expect presents anyway.
We stare at each other for a while. I am sure that my soul is as raw and open now as his.
Of course he has. Stating the obvious is one of John's coping mechanisms.
Thank you, Susi!
John does not answer for a while. I hear him breathing hard. "Sherlock ..." he starts and falls silent again.
John and I exchange looks. I silently try to communicate that I am sorry for what I will do next. He gives me a nearly imperceptible nod. I have to brace myself for speaking up, knowing it will cause him pain.
“I told myself not to give in to the feeling,” he continued then, looking as sad as possible. “But he was ... it was impossible not to fall for him. Do you know what I mean?” He held his breath for a second. Had this approach been too direct? But Moran bought it, took the bait again, didn't notice he was losing ground. “Yes, I know,” he admitted. Idiot!
There is nothing left to say really, so I remain silent. Just allow myself to lean into the embrace, feel like the ten year old boy that snuggles against big brother in the aftermath of a devastating hour at the vet. Thankfully he ignores the tears in my eyes when letting me go again.
15th December
I look up to the seat next to me and stare into the dead eyes of the woman who tried to flirt with John when we boarded the plane (broken neck, most likely not bracing for impact). For some reason, I cannot avert my eyes. She is dead. People died in the crash. (Of course they did. We fell straight from the sky.)
I cannot turn away. I need to stand beside him until he is dead. Finally, a shiver runs through his body and his hand drops down from his belly. Like the gesture you see in bad films, to hammer into the audience that somebody is really dead.
When he is done, he gets up to change the settings of the shower and rinses the shower gel and the shampoo off my body with clinical precision. Then he gets out of the shower cabin, helps me up and towels me thoroughly, head to toe. Then he wraps me up in the softest bath robe he can find.
But I need to.
But he loves me, of that I am sure. And I owe him more than I can say. If this is really what he wants, if this is what he needs …
When I look up, Inner Mycroft is sitting on the other side of the table, a mug with hot chocolate in his hand. “Coming here was a good idea, Sherlock,” he says. “Healing will take time, no doubt, but coming here was an important first step.”
Of course, Sherlock's endurance during cases is not only admirable, but also worrisome. No matter how much John is drawn along, no matter how willingly he stumbles after Sherlock, he never forgets to take care. Not after that one time, when Sherlock nearly collapsed in a client's barbers after following one lead or another for four days in a row.
I hover around them permanently (mute again). Ready to face my rightful punishment. But nothing happens the that day.
4th December
Heat pulsating, body slackening, brain burnt out. Panting. Sweat on my skin. Spent. Used. Fucked senseless.
John falls into his soldier mode only seldom, but it is plain to see that Sherlock loves every single time it happens. He gets aroused when John pulls rank on that young soldier at the Baskerville Research Facility. Apparently he is attracted to John's power play.
He looked revolted, tried to move away from her but was held in place by the guard. The look on his face made Mary angry. She grabbed him by the hair, forced his face in front of her, and placed a cruel kiss onto his mouth.
John's back is turned towards him, so he cannot read his face when John answers, “Sure, just a bit dizzy.”
(where is the connection between the victims? He is trying to tell me something is it only that he knows I'm alive? must be more to it, he's too clever to convey but one message with this, where's the connection? not gender, not age, not profession, not heritage, not hobbies, not denominations, there's something I can't see).
This time John found himself lying on the floor, handcuffed and with tied legs, but not tethered. He felt depleted and empty and cold. The adrenaline that had kept him going during the last torturing session was used up completely, replaced by a throbbing pain that seemed to come from every single muscle in his body.
My nervous stomach doesn't agree with the stale coffee. “You should store coffee in a dark sealed box” I tell John who starts grinning again almost instantly. Leans over and kisses my cheek.
"It was a trick," I whisper.
We share a moment of silence. A lonely seagull screams somewhere high above us.
Davies exchanged another glance with John and nodded once more. “I'll see you tomorrow then,” he said gently, and left.
Sherlock gasps for air. His entire front is in pain, burning, his body pierced with a thousand knives. He looks down his body and sees blood. So much blood. He feels dizzy, and thirsty, and he cannot force his lungs to breathe slowly. Agony is almost overriding his brain.
Before long, I am sitting in Mycroft's car again, the Watsons following us in the other one. “Well,” Mycroft says, looking out of the window, pretending to be mildly interested at best, “what do we make of Mrs Watson's … excitement?” But I am too tired, too overwhelmed for a conversation full of double meanings and hinted intentions.
He nods. “I know,” he says, not offering more. (Not able to. Not now.)
When John comes down, Emmi is delighted beyond words. She laughs and flails and wriggles herself off mummy's lap to get attached to John's leg and tells him “dadawadadwawa” until he picks her up. She presses one of her open-mouthed kisses onto his cheek and happily babbles on.
The emergency room is crowded.
(I shouldn't, should I? Those hands, desperately clinging to my arm, slipping away, dying, the body not able to function without the heart, I shouldn't have called him),
I spend an extra amount of time with dressing and styling, feeling the need to be in perfect armour today. Use the after shave John loves the most. Make sure every single curl is where I want it to be. Especially the ones that looks like errants. White shirt, black jacket. Perfection (on the outside). Ready to face the world.
Instead, he can only watch as John's pupils grow larger when his body finally gives in. He watches John's mouth slowly falling open, watches his neck becoming slack, making his head roll slightly to the right. He listens to the last futile gasp, watches John's breast stopping to move. He watches a final tremor running through John's entire body.
“If we crash into the ocean, don't inflate your life jacket before you are out of the plane,” John continues his monologue, unable to stop. He needs to have control, even if it is just imaginary. There is a silent plea in his eyes, and I nod obediently while the erratic movement of the plane makes my skin to crawl. It feels like we are still lurching about without descending. It cannot have been more than two minutes since the second bang but it feels like an eternity.
The ferry is new, but boarding it by car seems strangely familiar. When I get out of the Mini, I am surrounded by happy tourists. German is spoken all around me, sounding harsh but familiar. I know that I will be able to understand it fluently again soon.
And rightfully so, for Sherlock had prevented him from going to bed twice that day. Wait, why had John wanted to go to bed twice a day? Oh, because it had been more than one day. Sherlock checked his mobile. Oh. Three days. Well, no wonder John was looking tired then.
Thirty more minutes before the ferry arrives. It would be reasonable to wait another twenty minutes before leaving the house.
(He does not miss much of the gift giving for Emmi is still crawling around with the hammer in her hand, looking for things to hit while Daddy tries to stop her and Mummy takes a hundred pictures of it.)
Both might become important at some part of his life, but not now. Now, the only truly important things are rebuilding his reputation and the renaissance of his friendship with John. Friendship. How insufficient. Sherlock is ready for romance now, and all it took him to find out were a few months in unbearable loneliness and misery and the complete destruction of John's soul. He is sure that even the ravens are looking at him in pity.
“Oh my God,” I hear John say. Around us, hell breaks lose. The plane lurches again and again, people are screaming, the flight attendants trying to keep control. John instructs about how to brace for impact and that I need to put on my oxygen mask before I help him with his should he be unconscious already. He is on the edge of panic.
He placed himself in front of John, looking down on him, looming over him. One thing that must have connected Sherlock to him had surely been their marked preference for dramatic poses. Well, it wasn't as if John hadn't learnt anything from living with Sherlock, too. He closed his eyes again, sighing, hoping to appear even more tired and hopeless than he felt.
Mycroft was standing so close that he almost bumped into him. John gave him the coldest stare he could muster. “Don´t you dare to talk to me. Ever.” And without waiting for the inevitable reply, John left.
“Okay,” Dr Davies said, “Let's get you into an upright position so you can take off the oxygen mask!” He pushed a button at the side of Sherlock's bed and the bed-head was slowly going up. When it stopped in the right place, John helped Sherlock settle into a comfortable position and took off the oxygen mask. Breathing was easier now, he realised. There was something John had said about it yesterday but he could not remember. Well, the doctor would surely get to it soon.
“My sister earns less than me, she just married rich,” he answered.
There was fear in his voice. He did not expect me to call him. Rather someone who found his number on my mobile. Someone who wanted to inform him of my hospitalisation or my attempted suicide or my suicide.
Now that John's world was turned upside down, he had no idea what the future would hold. Or what he wanted it to hold. All he knew was that Sherlock would be kind of fine somehow, and for now, that would have to be enough.
“I will protect you,” he whispers before letting me go.
Holidays. Summer holidays with our parents, always leading back to a little island abroad, years and years in a row.
Sherlock's face darkened. “No,” he snapped.
No. Vaults.
John does not object to me carrying his stuff (not good). He does not look at me again, just follows me wordlessly. When he is sitting inside daddy's car, he gives me the address of his holiday home (Nebel, nice house on the land side of the island). Then he looks out of the window in silence.
When we are on the ferry, I delete how we got there. My final memory of Amrum will be John and Emmi and me in the garden of our old house, hugging.
I am in a relationship with the evil master of manipulation. I am not sure yet whether to admire his skills or to detest them. John baited me into a cab under the pretence of taking me to a brutal crime scene, knowing I could not resist that during the Christmas crime recession. Realized too late that we were heading towards Putney Vale Cemetery instead.
Then Sherlock theorises the problem to find out what is wrong. He hides in his mind palace and attempts to find a solution there. But that turns out to be a tricky thing, for he usually sees a mind version of John when dealing with emotional stuff.
Sorry, so sorry for being incredibly late with the update. I shamelessly blame real life. :-p
I am not.
“Sherlock, are you with me?”
The problem with considering his next moves was just that there were only so many moves to be accomplished. He would mourn for a while, and then slowly go on with his life, picking up a voluntary job at some charity medical project (no need to earn money with Mycroft keeping John's bank account even, no matter how much money he spent), starting to go out with friends again, but still feeling a certain emptiness in his life...
At that, Janine grins once more. “I am a Moriarty, after all,” she quips, and then moves closer. Kisses the tip of my nose and says, “Yasmin would be more than pleased if you and your little family came over for some tea one day.”
I switch to another channel (the right engine was shut down), then to another (the co-pilot is now dead, too), then to another (there is a hot line for family members), but that is all the information on the crash you can get.
Yes, I do. But without waiting for my answer she pushes the taser into my flank again and -
GoSherlocked, I cannot thank you enough!
Or so he tried. It was hard because that person moved closer to him, talked to him, touched him. The loneliness was about to swallow him when that person took him into their arms. It felt warm there and smelled like John, and that made the loss even worse.
Until I open my mouth and blurt out, “I think I cheated on you, but I'm not sure.”
“Sherlock, you didn't ...”
Always.
My mind starts spinning out of control. Does she know? Does she guess? She is good. Very good. And astute. But she cannot know. Can she? Is she just demonstrating that John is hers? Is she warning us not to get started? Does she tell us to stop?
What he does tells us is that there is a manhunt for Mary going on, and informs us that we all are under his personal protection from now on until further notice. (His body language furthermore tells me that he is not completely convinced that he will be able to protect us. When he has left I tell John, but not my parents.)
John stares at it for a long time. So that is what Sherlock has been up to all day. John continues to stare at it and loses his sense of time. Then he folds the sheet of paper carefully, hoping that he rearranged it exactly the way he found it, and slips back into bed.
When he leaned forward to resume the file at normal speed, Mycroft placed his hand on Sherlock's shoulder once more. He could have sworn his brother was leaning against it, but maybe it was only an inappropriate whiff of wishful thinking.
In the end, Sherlock was the first to look away. “Fine, fine,I will sleep!” he declared theatrically and pointedly closed his eyes.
Just in that second, an elderly nurse disturbs our enclave of peace by rolling John into the examination room. He does not say hello or how are you, just moves the stretcher into the room where an (exhausted looking) doctor (moved to England during puberty) is waiting for the next patient.
“Have you forgiven yourself?” he wants to know. No, he does not want to know. He knows. He wants me to say it loud.
If Mycroft is one thing, then he is efficient. Only two hours after his desperate call, Sherlock sits in a redirected private jet that takes him back to London in world record speed. There is still some network shattering going on behind the scenes, but Sherlock is no longer part of it.
"John didn’t want to come," I state matter-of-factly. Daddy gives me a pained look.
Inside the cramped metro they were squeezed against each other, and Sherlock used the closeness to fire random deductions into John's ear, so fast John could barely follow. “Couple over there: Both betraying their partners.” “That business man: on his way for an important meeting but knowing he's under-prepared.” “Watch out for your wallet, I've seen at least three pickpockets around.” “This woman: mother of three at least, married twice, working for a bank, diabetic, watch out, she's looking for husband no 3.”
“And what … “ (Again, patience is not my strength!) He draws a deep breath. “What if I will never be able to love you again?”
John is not aroused at all. There is still something very sober in his glance.
(An unusual feeling rises inside of me. One I experience so seldom that I cannot figure it out instantly.)
His head snaps up in surprise, “What?”
John could feel the prospect of him staying in Italy dwindling down rapidly. He looked at Sherlock who was deducing whatever from the carpet or the ceiling or something. Or was pretending to deduce something so he wouldn't have to look at John. “I'm fine” John said lamely, knowing that it wouldn't make any difference, for Moran had made his point clear: There was no way John would be safe, no matter what they did.
“John,” I say (using his name as a filler). My hand is lying next to his, ready to make contact but hesitating. I wait until he is looking at me (his guard finally down, his soul raw and open) before I go on, “John, you have spent the last three months trying to un-love everyone you care for and it didn't help you at all.”
Inner Mycroft smiles at me. “That was the one deduction you had still to make, right?” Of course he is right. He is Mycroft, even if only his mind palace version.
17th December
The gleam in her eyes tells me that she enjoys her victory. Then something bitter shows on her features as well. Honest anger because I force her to hurt John. (Damn, she is even more insane than I thought.)
“Nonsense,” Sherlock dismissed that thought. “Let us rather think of how to forgive her.”
"Stop it, Sherlock," his voice cuts through my thoughts. Insistent but not unkind. He feels uncomfortable under my deduction. I don't want to intensify that feeling even more. So I nod and ...
Less than an hour after calling Mycroft John received a short text from him. "Arrest successful" it read. "Contact me for further details if needed."
When the grunting goes on, I tune it out and when he doesn't stop pushing, I hide inside my mind palace, press my face into Redbeard's fur and wait for it all to be over.
The moon is nearly full and illuminates Sherlock's face. It is almost unbelievable how young and innocent he looks at night, with this nearly transparent skin of his and those delicate lips. It is completely unbelievable how much John is in love with him.
Yes. Yes, of course it was. Sherlock was the most self-centred man John knew. If Sherlock had been in love with John at some point of their relationship, he would have let John know and would have taken whatever he needed.
I look up at them (which is hard because my eyes insist on staring at the perfection in my hands) and the words I would like to say stumble over each other inside my brain without making it to my mouth. (My mouth must be hanging open but I have no brain capacity left to check that.)
After a few seconds she shrugs and uses the taser again.
I still marvel at how happy that makes me.
“How can you be so sure?” Daddy asks with that little smile reserved for Mummy being brilliant when he himself is wrong.
For some reason, John had to blink while listing up all the damage done to Sherlock's body. Must have been the sweat or something. He drew another deep breath to give the finer details of all complications but when he looked at Sherlock, he stopped himself.
Sherlock shook his hand rather weakly, but with satisfaction. "You are not intimidated by me," he said, and added, "That's good. I have no need for a coward at the moment."
John (clever John) drives me crazy by pushing me back a little, slowing me down. He makes me sit down on the bed, undresses himself while standing in front of me, not allowing me to help. He is looking at me the entire time, so I can see the playful gleam in his eyes. He knows that watching him undress drives me crazy, and he plays with me and my desire.
Sherlock stared at the floor. “Yes,” he whispered.
(Would I have been able to make him look that way if I had got the change? Probably not.)
I am concentrated so hard that I don't hear the door bell. But it must have rung, for Mrs Hudson makes a big fuss about opening the door and why should one of the younger ones move down the stairs instead of her? I concur, but telling her so seems to be a bad idea. When she comes back, she is followed by -
He spends another three days to find out what exactly it is that makes him love John. He considers everything that is impressive about the doctor: his caring, his smile, his absurd patriotism, his humour, his wonderful eyes, his incomprehensible preference for Sherlock, his plainness, his loyalty, his honesty, his strange faith in Sherlock, his devotion, his energy, his courage, his optimism, his nose, his understanding, his warmth.
He cannot tell if John, John who always seems to know what Sherlock is thinking, except when he is thinking about love but it is better that way, definitely, for -
I am moving into his hand now, while he kisses my throat again and again. I could not open my eyes even if my life depended on it. And he knows. He knows me so well it hurts.
I had wanted to write a longer epilogue, but then Sherlock said something and John said something, and then all was said.
No, not like I miss them. Mycroft is gone for good but John and Emmi are not. They need help, just like me and as far as I see it, I am the only one who can give them that help. So my course is set. I need to get over what Mary did to me. I need to deduce again, and I need to speak. Once that is done, I can fix John.
Which is perfect because it is exactly what Sherlock intends to do.
Of course I do.
When we go home later, she is still holding my hand the way she did when I was ten.
Watching too much telly has also left him thinking how handy it would be if he could just regenerate, come back to the world with a new face and a fresh mind. He deeply despises ties, but bow ties hold a certain fascination. But then, after regeneration, would he have to chose a new companion, too? If yes, there is no point to it.
There was a sound I didn't notice because I have been distracted by Mycroft's (loving) words. Three sounds, that is, or rather three times the same sound. Shots. (Sniper, rifle.) He started bleeding almost instantly. I had missed that because I was distracted by the surprise on his face. The blood tells me where he was hit (chest. Shot from the second storage of the empty house on the other side of the street. The bullets have flown by my shoulder. More difficult to miss me than to hit me from that angle. I was spared on purpose, so no need to duck for cover.) I watch the beginning of the bleeding again to judge the damage the bullets have caused. (Two bullets tearing up his heart and also hitting his lungs, the third one missing the heart but most likely shattering his spine. No need for first aid or an ambulance. Mycroft is dying already.)
“I had the plan of the cottage, knew when there was a shortage of body guards … It should have worked.”
When John asks him about it, Sherlock gets evasive and pretends that it is Vivaldi. John feels loved anyway. If he could only make Sherlock realise that.
Sherlock exchanged another quick look with John. The damage he was learning about right now was severe. What else was there? John glanced back reassuringly, or rather as reassuringly as he was able to. For a moment, Sherlock felt the irrational wish to end the briefing here and now. This was so much to take in already. How was he supposed to face even more?
I must have lost several minutes of the report that way, for the news presenter has already moved on to talking about why it is so important to find the flight recorder. Again, you can see Dan Miller in the background, looking at the debris in a very concentrated way. I have never paid much attention to plane crashes so I do not know what the debris can tell him but I recognise a man deducing when I see one.
There is consolation in how she sticks to her routine no matter what happened to John and me on that plane.
“Of course he is,” he answers, and if I am not completely mistaken, there is a little giggle in his voice. Why? Why the hell is he close to giggling?
John starts to get snappy, I get desperate, and no matter what we do, we seem to go back two steps every time we went one forward.
One day later Sherlock insists that his headache and stiff neck result from running around London all night when it's cold and wet outside. When he has to throw up John is glad they are having this en suite bathroom where he holds the curls away while Sherlock chokes.
A blatant lie.
Help! I am looking for a new beta reader. Please leave a comment if you are interested. :-)
So I pass the third row again. I cannot tell if the brother is still alive or if the lady managed to open her seat belt because I cannot see them clearly. They are just blurred figures now, barely visible.
Only that I can no longer remember why I resist.
“I know now,” he whispers.
Instead, I follow the memory image of little ten year old Sherlock to the front. He has never been one to look back. The warm evening breeze ruffles his curls and stings my eyes (for what else could be stinging my eyes?)
When John retreats to the kitchen to make some coffee, Sherlock follows discretely. “Thank you” he said quietly, and John's face does this funny thing it used to do occasionally a long time ago, where his eyes get a bit cloudy and his cheeks turn rosy and his lips move in impossible ways. He is moved. He feels.
- Make sure to spend enough time with bare feet.
It took me two hours to find out that there is a Christmas tree underneath the heap of decorations next to the fireplace. Judging from the overall looks of the flat, I am forced to live inside a Lewis Carroll novel now.
Still, afterwards he wishes he could delete John's reactions. He tries, very hard, but it does not work. He would like to delete the broken sound of John's voice, the broken look in his eyes. He would like to delete the fact that John needs medication afterwards. He would like to delete the video footage from the clinic, showing John, slack in Harriet's arms. But he cannot.
Knowing that we won't.
When John overhears one of their conversations about Sherlock, he is sure he heard them voicing the desire to do things to him that would sooner or later lead to “quivering flanks”.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she says, “look at you. Dying again to safe John. Doesn't it get boring?”
There would surely have been a long list of threats, but she stops in mid-sentence, her face shifting to surprise, and then annoyance. Looks down on the ground where a little puddle of fluid is growing bigger and bigger with each passing second.
and looked at Sherlock again.
So peaceful, was the first thought that crossed his mind. It seemed like someone had washed the hair, arranged the curls to frame the face, cleaned the face, closed the eyes. Covered the naked body with a white blanket. So peaceful. John´s mind was almost empty now, and he had no idea how long he simply stared at the... the body. Because that was what he should consider it to be, he told himself. A body. No matter what. A body.
Stopping to kiss parts of his body seems like a good idea, so I stop kissing his ear. But what now? “John?” I try, not sure what to expect. He just shakes his head. All right, what then?
John had to think of how he reacted when asked to be John's best man. And then it all made sense. Sherlock had no idea he was loved.
The nightmares bothered Sherlock so much he dedicated them a point in his email to Mary, a rather long one. He remembers the words clearly, “You can tell he will have a nightmare by the way he sits in his chair prior to going to bed. See pictures in attachment 1. Waking him when next to him can be dangerous (ex-soldier). Playing an instrument in another room shortly after the nightmare starts is a well-proven method. If you do not play an instrument, learn how to do so. Soon.”
12th December
Hear him breathe out. Feel my shirt get wet. (Blood. Warm.) He starts to tremble slightly, and I hold him even closer. Slowly start rocking him in my arms. “It's all right, I have you” my mouth keeps saying again and again.
“I doubt that,” John said dryly. He held Mycroft's scrutinising gaze with determination. The other man's eyebrow moved upwards.
End of part 1
And Sherlock is perfectly happy with John being alive.
This demonstration is completely unnecessary. I am fully aware of how mean that comment had sounded. (Mostly because I had wanted it to hurt him. Was lashing out like an animal in pain.) But I have apologized.
I nod, and he gives me a strange little smile. “Sherlock,” he says, his voice soft and demanding at the same time, his eyes piercing, “please let them take a look at you now!”
When they turn their attention back to John, I close my eyes for a second – and open them again almost instantly. I am tired, worn out, and surely on sensory overload. But closing my eyes means allowing memories (the moans of the dying) to come creeping in (a baby screaming), and I am not ready for that (the smell). Not yet.
“Sherlock?” John asked, “Do you hear me?”
So no, no secret sex at a spa for quite a while.
He took in a deep breath, and finally looked up.
“I am not so easy to get,” he quips. “I demand dinner and dancing before giving away my body.”
On the third day after Mycroft's death I completely ignore the fact that there was a fatality and spend it completely focused on Emilia and John instead. Which means that John and I completely focus on Emmi, to be honest. But isn't she the most interesting baby that has ever lived?
When I wake up the next time, John is flipping through a manila folder. There is an expression on his face I have never seen before. At first, I thought it was anger. Then I realize it is hatred. Never knew John would be capable of hate so concentrated. His jaws must hurt terribly by now.
How did that happen?
(Remember my surprise during my first John-made orgasm. Finally understood why people are doing that all the time.)
He has never imagined his return to be so rueful.
“Of course not,” John replies, but there is a smile in his voice and against all overwhelming odds he leans down and presses a gentle kiss on Sherlock's forehead.
How do you approach a topic like that? I have no idea. So we spend much of our time avoiding the obvious topics. (Something we already learnt to do before the fall.)
But would she really use poison? Too much of a cliché, maybe.
He never finishes the sentence, and I … I don't know what he wants to say. Can't deduce what he wants to tell me. I can't … I don't know. Why don't I know? I have to know, I have to ...
“Of course not.” She smiles, but then sobers before continuing, “Jesterton is a mean little vermin. Likes to humiliate women he is with. Hurt several prostitutes and always got away with it. No proof, you know.”
John was ashamed because he had secretly enjoyed holding Sherlock in his arms like that. He shook off the thought. “Good morning,” he said innocently, interrupting the discussion that was going on between doctor and patient.
The gleam in her eyes turns into something feral, she moves closer to me again. (Way too close.) “Of course, now that he loves you too, it will hurt him even more than before. Do you really think he deserves that?” She slips her arms around me (dislike that), places her hands on my back. My (imaginary) body stiffens with rejection. She laughs and lets her hands wander down until they rest on my bum.(Dislike that deeply.)
And wait.
Moran's voice now became cold and vicious. “He drugged you. On purpose.” He moved away from John's head, towards his side, and stood next to the outstretched hand, carelessly playing with the hammer. “With a drug he knew would cause sheer terror.” His voice grew louder now, his face displayed his anger. John knew exactly what would happen next, but forced himself not to look away. His whole body tensed in anticipation, and he felt sweat dripping down his face. The pain would be inevitable now.
The pain on Moran's face was obvious now. He seemed to follow exactly where John was leading him: to realise that what John and Sherlock were having was so much more than anything he ever had. A tear would be good now. Unable to cry on command, John tried to clench his broken fingers. Pain shot through him, making his eyes wet. Good.
“No sitting up just yet?” Sherlock asked instead. He remembered hanging in John's arms last night after his nightmare but had no clear memories of how he had gotten there. A panic-driven surge of adrenaline, most likely.
His eyes lost their focus, his head sank onto the ground. Slowly, very slowly you could see him giving in. His body buckled one last time when he heaved a surge of blood. Then his head lolled to the side, and his eyes lost their life.
Feeling slightly dispensable right now, John took that moment to go outside. He found his right hand toying with his mobile. Mary had shot Sherlock. One last time, he listened to his feelings, questioning his own determination. No, there was no way back to her.
“You will need an appointment with your local doctor,” he tells me, claps my back and hands me a rather big box of pain killers.
He is there whenever yet another tube is pulled out some other part of my body.
He does not know that actually, I fell in love with her before I dared to fall in love with him again. Unloving John had been hard work. I started right after leaving the wedding, and only succeeded when Mary died in his arms and he was mourning her so much more than he had mourned me. (Or so I had thought. I had been an idiot, not understanding John at that time, but it had helped me with the stupid unloving-business.)
Panic. He has realised now how much he wants me to call him again. How much he wants me to come to him. How much he misses me. How much he loves me. How terrible the punishment will be for both of us.
“You've been listening to gruesome, incomprehensible music the whole day,” John reminds him, just in case he has forgotten.
Now he snorts a bit. “Please, Sherlock, I never ruled the world.” He pauses, and the added, “Only the better part of Europe as well as Asia, Australia and Canada.”
(spinning and spinning not stopping for a second don't think about it again don't)
Why? Why does he play along Sherlock's lies? No matter how many hours Sherlock spends curled up on the sofa thinking about it, he can not solve that mystery. And he absolutely loves the fact that John is beyond him in certain respects.
Mary reaches for the whip. Places herself next to John and hesitates. Then it seems like she has brought herself to do what is necessary. Her body tension shows nothing but determination when she swings the whip. The sound it makes when it hits John's bare skin will most likely stay in my mind for ever.
When John talks about his first encounter with him, my parents are laughing tears. “That was my boy,” Daddy says, “always knew how to make a lasting first impression.”
They have talked about it before, and Sherlock knows that it was his apparent selflessness that made John leave Mary. A character trait he is sure has not existed before John entered his life.
That night, John needs to be held for hours and hours before he finally falls asleep in my arms.
I am still not good with emotions, but I am fairly sure that he is angry with me. (In the long run, he surely will be grateful. When he will hold his baby in his arms, for example. But now, he must be terribly angry, because I managed, once again, to do the only thing he asked me not to do. I left him. Again.)
My wonderful beta GoSherlocked has reminded me of the fact that a fic that is tagged "hurt and comfort" does not only need hurt, but also comford. Good point! So, here is some.
I try to play along by pretending to be confident as well. I hope that he cannot read my doubt.
There is a new feeling, one Sherlock does not know. It takes him three days to identify it. He is crestfallen. When he realises it, he stumbles into the bathroom and throws up with revulsion. Then he sags down next to the toilet, too exhausted to crawl back to bed. He stay inside the bathroom the whole night and cries and cries and cries.
That got him an astonished glance. Then suddenly Sherlock seemed to lose all the strength his anger had given him. He slipped deeper into his cushion. He paled, which made the rings underneath his eyes look even deeper.
“Dan Miller, leading investigator of the accident, says it is still too early to speculate on the cause of accident. Experts are now searching the crash site for the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. Once they have been found, a thorough analysis of the accident will begin.”
That night, I dream of Eurus and her tale of a girl on a crashing plane. It is a wild dream, illogical and painful. When I wake up, I am relieved, and unable to recall most of the dream. (Did she really know how it felt to be in a plane that crashes down? I still fail to say if she is capable of empathy or not.)
We are lying so close that John feels it, too, but he does not force us further. He pulls me even closer and just holds me tight.
I sit by his side (undetected) for several hours and ponder our desperate situation. One thing is clear to me now: We are destined to fail, but too stubborn to give up.
I do not want to look away. If I do, I'll see only more of that.
Who would have thought that “Sherlock Holmes” and “holidays” were not two concepts that excluded each other?
“Then why should she be willing to talk to me?”, I wonder.
Then there is a change in the light that hits his closed eyes, a shift of weight on the sofa. John is leaning closer, and Sherlock tries to brace himself for what is about to happen. John's healing hands slide to his neck, pulling him in, gently pressing their lips together, and the sexual hunger that suddenly rises inside of Sherlock surprises only himself.
I panic. Want to stand up and start looking for him. Want to find him. Want to see if he is alive and help him if he needs help and get out of this godforsaken plane.
Does he also know that it is just a lie? Surely not. I need to tell him. He has to know.
We spend the next minutes not crying. “And now you are here,” I can reply after some time. “And I want you to be here. And if you really didn't want to be here with me, you would have stayed on that ferry and gone back to Scotland.”
“I really shouldn't mention him,” Yasmin smiles at me, “with your brother still angry at losing track of him.”
And who had thought that it was possible to for his (one-sided) love to grow that deeply? What had started as mild curiosity and secret pining had now turned out to be something very serious. Well, pointless to think about it. It had nothing to do with John's state of mind and was hence of minor importance.
“No,” John says, “I need to hear it.”
The next chapter might be posted a bit later than usually. To make up for it, there will be sex in it. ;-)
(See the end of the chapter for
All I can think of before paternal pre-birth panic sweeps my mind away is: I will surely love that baby girl to pieces, for her aptitude of dramatic entrances is as distinctive as mine.
Yes, I desperately need the hot chocolate now.
The biggest thanks to my three wonderful betas. This fic would not be what it is today without you. <3
John drinks it. He knows something is wrong after the first gulp, but it's too late. I can see that he feels dizzy. He stands up but sways, has to reach for the edge of the table. He breathes, fast and desperate, but getting air inside his lungs is not the problem. His body is already reacting, his cells unable to use the oxygen any longer. His legs give in, he falls to the ground, his lips blue. His hands cling to the collar of his shirt, irrationally trying to widen it to get air. He panics, his legs kicking frantically at nothing. Then his movements slow down, until a seizure shakes his body. I can tell from his eyes that he is dead before his body stills.
In the end it is just another cruel move by his bossy wife. The thought of leaving John and GraceOrJoshua with her is even more scary than my imminent death. Need to talk about it with Mycroft soon.
Then he deliberately thinks of more pleasant things, because the whole orphanage incident is slowly killing him. The extremely delicious takeaway Sherlock had ordered yesterday, for example. It came from one of the best restaurants of London, one that does not usually deliver food. Food that Sherlock barely touched and clearly only ordered so John could enjoy it.
He can hear John standing in the living room for a moment before he speaks up, “I've brought take-away from your favourite Osteria.”
That leads to terrifying nightmares about John leaving him one way or the other. Those nightmares make him wake up sobbing with tears streaming down his face, which is annoying but acceptable, but they also wake up John, which is not. John gets crotchety when tired, and the last thing Sherlock wants is John being even more whatever-he-is than he already is.
Never before have I felt that calm.
I follow the same procedure the next day. Only this time I go through everything that happened down in that cellar.
Three weeks and two days after Mycroft's death we are on our way to the Yard, following a less than convincing lead when John suddenly collapses next to me. Immediately afterwards I feel a sting on my throat, and manage to get a hold on the tranquillizer dart that has hit me.
I think I like him less than all the other Johns I have met so far.
John puts his laptop away. I feel his movement, gentle and careful. He does not want to scare me away again. Then he places his hand on my head. I lean into his touch, and he understands the motion. He starts to slowly massage my scalp.
On their way out, Sherlock states “I wonder why this event attracts so many men with erectile dysfunctions?” and John's emotional balance is restored. He grins widely and mentions: “You would make a perfect elf.” Needless to say the rest of the day is filled with comments on what kind of creature John would be, none of them flattering, but all good-hearted.
I want to know if I will be able to play the violin again but somehow that is a too pathetic thing to ask. So instead I accept the pain killers that are pushed into my hand and find myself in the elevator, trying to locate John's room.
The flight attendants do their best to appear calm but it is obvious (to me) that they don't have any idea what is going on. I get one of them (“Mrs. A. McDonelly”, hair dyed brown because it turned prematurely grey, two dogs, two lovers, one male one female, studying pharmacy in her free-time, unaware that she is pregnant) to come to us.
He tries to engage in some activities. He tries to meditate, but cannot clear Sherlock from his mind enough to gain some inner peace. He thinks about mastering some martial arts, but realises he will never use them, for his life is safe and dull now. He musically maltreats his clarinet until he remembers why he stopped playing it years ago.
Then he concentrated on breathing for a moment. Now that he knew what was happening, he realised that his right lung was not working properly. He tried to take a few deep breaths and failed. A most unpleasant feeling.
The Vogelkoje and its mascot is not fiction. It's one of the strangest tourist attractions I have ever seen.
Both sessions had left him wretched and exhausted. Sherlock had wanted to yell at both therapists but his speech was still slightly slurry and he could not always remember all the words he needed, so he had decided against it.
And that Mary Morstan she mentions is surely not more important than Sarah and Jeanette and all the other colourless women in John's life have been. She may charm John an cheer him up a little, but Sherlock will easily scare her away, will cleanse John's life of her by being his cocky, cheeky self when he comes back.
“Okay,” he murmurs over and over again. “Okay, okay.”
“I will never forgive her,” he heard John say.
I guess he really is angry then.
“Grace” I correct him instantly, and he smiles, broader than I have ever seen him smile.
After another thirty minutes, he helped himself to the left-overs from the fridge, hoping it was really just Thai and not some experiment.
It feels strange, familiar and new at the same time. Mrs Hudson has had the door painted three months ago in the same colour it was before, and Speedy's has reacted to the slight decrease in income by an increase of annoyingly red adverts.
Why didn't Sherlock see that? His little brother's face was extremely open again, displaying fear and remorse and compassion all at once. And when they heard John teasing Sebastian: “Sounds like you should break his fingers instead of mine,” it was painfully obvious that Sherlock silently agreed with him.
He has to be unconscious. He has to. The alternative is … He has to be unconscious.
My inner Mycroft looks at me with pity. “So, now you know what will hurt both of you soon. Will that make it feel any better?” I (angrily) make him disappear.
With a fluid motion I sink into his arms when he breaks the kiss. Someone sighs, probably me.
“You say the murderer took money from the cash box,” Sherlock explained very friendly and gestured to the little blue box lying on the floor next to the desk. “Why do you think so?” “Because according to the accounting book there should be at least 50.000 Euro more in it.” Pezzutto looked like he instantly wanted to vanish from the face of the earth.
At first it is glorious. There is a clash of options on where to strike first. Sherlock catches one member of the network after another at breathtaking speed, right in front of the CID officers or whatever they are called in all those God forsaken countries. He, shows courage and superior intelligence. He feels brilliant, like a champion, like nothing can stop him. He never stays long enough to watch them being brought to the holding cell, never follows their trials at court.
John wanted to answer to that but Sherlock went on, “In it, I had deduced that Mary had shot me in exactly that spot simply to buy herself time. I called it surgery because she was such a crack shot that she was able to aim at the very spot that would incapacitate me without killing me.”
“An explosion at Baker Street. At least this time, I died shortly after you did.”
Inside the envelope there is a passport with Mary's picture on it, claiming her to be Christine Holden from Canada. And a return ticket for a flight from London to Vancouver, in a bit more than six weeks. (Clever, really. Returning to Canada is a lot more inconspicuous than entering Canada.)
- wife loves him
how Janine reacted to that …
(another half-hearted smile that doesn't reach his eyes “I know.”).
“Stop fighting your love for me,” Mary hissed, not sounding lovable at all.
When we come home (Daddy's car in front of the house) I notice (amount of rain drops on the bonnet tell me it has been standing in the drizzling rain for more than three hours. So they came here with the 10 o'clock ferry) that they took their time to unpack (five now empty bags means they intend to stay for a long time) before looking for me. What did they do after arriving?
When Christmas comes nearer, John thinks he can no longer stand feeling broken and lost. He honestly makes plans to join the military once more, or even a monastery. But then he would have to leave London, and that would surely finish him completely. So he stays.
Something in his pose changes. He did not know that. Of course not. Without me talking, how could he have known? Still, something (unpleasant) is working inside his mind now. Easy to deduce once again. He thinks he should have known. He realises that he just hurt me but he also realises how long I must have been oblivious to what happened behind my back when he killed her and Big Boy.
I was pushed into the helicopter. Of the ride I have no memory except the look on Mycroft's face. (Disappointed? Sad. Scared?)
“Oi,” John exclaims suddenly. “There are still four names missing!”
I look at John again. He is tired and angry, worried but not too confused. “So, what did Mary tell you already?” I ask him. (Pleased with his admiring surprise at my correct deduction.)
Exhaustion washed over him, forcing his eyes to close again. The only thing he could do right now was to hold on to John's hand. He held it, cling to it like to a life line.
I put all my despair, all my fear of losing him into this kiss, and he answers me. His hands start to stroke my entire body, stripping off my clothes, stripping off my despair with them. His movements are steady and precise. I can barely breathe. I want to press my body against him, melt with him. Tear his clothes off of him. (Not sure how to accomplish that with just one hand.)
John regarded him curiously. “What kind of simulation?” he asked. The painful expression on Sherlock's face stirred something inside him.
"I don't know if I can heal here with you," he whispers finally. His voice is raw. He looks as if he could break down any second. It hurts terribly to see him like that. "I don't know if I can heal at all, Sherlock. But I know for sure that I would be lost if I left now. "
John laughs. A wonderful sound, even when he laughs at my stupidity. “No, as a baby's name,” he explains, still (oh so gently) caressing my arm with his fingers. (One thing I never anticipated about John. No matter how wild or hard or inept the orgasm has been, afterwards he is the most gentle person in the world. But did he really imply ...)
(1) The scene at the tarmac is the one that needs to be fixed the most. Here we go.
But here, in reality, it had not been him who had killed that man. He was not a killer. What a relief.
At that, Mycroft gives me a long (unguarded, extremely touching) look. “Me,” he simply says, and adds, “and what a father you turned out to be.”
Sherlock had woken up from his stomach revolting at the sight of it. Then it had dawned to him that should he really need to vomit, he would not be able to get to the restroom on his own because he could not even sit up without help.
When I try to find some sleep, my exhausted mind sends me to my mind palace instead. I am standing in front of the door that has always been leading me to my sanctum, to my very own place of tranquillity and peace. Until, of course, until I opened the door after being shot, trying to calm down to avoid dying from shock. That day, Mary had been waiting there, dressed up as a bride, weapon pointing at me. I have never been able to open that door again.
“I should continue to work on those names soon,” I admit. And I can, really, because John is more stable than he was when he came here. He could play with Emmi while I ...
Thinking of the nightmares makes John feel guilty, for they have clearly started around the same time John had started asking himself if he can really live with a lover who constantly risks his life carelessly without thinking.
I cannot avert my eyes from her corpse.
I climb up the (twenty) steps, ignore my old room and go straight into (what used to be) Mycroft's room. Is our hidden treasure still there? The wooden floor creaks underneath my steps. It looks as if someone has modernized the parquet, but not replaced it. Good. Unfastening the second plank from the left in the third row is not easy, but in the end I am holding it in my hand. And underneath it, there it still is. An old freezer bag. It contains two letters. I take them both out carefully (exhaling, not sure for how long I have held my breath).
John tries to stroke away the tears with his fingers and manages to do so without gouging Sherlock's eyes. “You have to write your autobiography yourself, you git,” he whispers. “That's why it is called auto-biography.”
His mobile was in his hand before he really noticed it, and he had already dialled John’s number.
(Other survivors? I remember the horror of the first minutes after the crash landing, remember so many people my mind replaced by blurred figures to save me from reality. Are there really enough survivors to keep a whole medical unit busy?)
Now he does.
Edit: Due to a crash of my flash drive I lost the original mail to Mary some time ago. The version I am using for Like A Landslide right now contains the same points but in a different order. Changing the two lines about it here was the easiest way to fix it. :-) Eternal thanks to my beta Katzedecimal who noticed the problem.
(“A job offer I should like you to decline,” he said.)
His thoughts were disturbed when a nurse came into the room. “Mr. Holmes, it is so good to see you awake again,” she said and smiled. She started to follow a routine check-up.
I can tell that something is wrong with me when I am not only relieved but happy to see Mycroft that afternoon. The first thing I feel all day. He is oozing with concern. “How are you?” he asks. I don't know.
“Um,” John said, in his unique, urgent, yet as unobtrusive as possible way, “I don't know how critical the situation is, but I think you should intensify your surveillance on Madrid tonight. If this isn't a danger night, I don't know what one should be.”
He is apparently caught between reaching out to comfort me and running away. We are both holding perfectly still for a while. Then his fear wins over his compassion and he turns away wordlessly.

Thanks to my betas GoSherlocked, Katzedecimal and Grizzy. You are the best.
I love you?
“Sherlock,” he repeats, more urgent now.
Sherlock is hungry for everything John's body would have to offer, or at least for a hug, but never mentions it. Their truce is still unstable, and for nothing in the world would he risk it again. He is still trying not to think about homo-eroticisms when John points out an article that could be a hoax or the most intriguing case in years. And it is in Edinburgh.
“Papa, Daddy has a headache,” she tells me, proud to have information to share. She loves to share information and never understands who already knows what.
Love and hugs to my wonderful betas.
Mandini shook his head. “I must admit that we don't know. Vittorio Emanuele II is important to us, of course, but there was nothing inside that tomb besides his body. And to be honest... If you want to steal bodies from the Pantheon, why not start with Raphael's, for example?”
19. Get along with Harry, but do not become her best friend. John will prefer it if you and Harry are relaxed in each other's company, but he will also need you to complain to whenever she drinks again. For more detailed instructions on how to get along with Harry but just barely so, see attachment 2.
I cannot go on, for John grabs my arms hard and jerks me around. He is angry, very very angry. “Stop that thought right now,” he hisses.
A compliment, then. One that hit home. John smiled at him, a smile that widened when he saw Sherlock flushing ever so slightly. “I spent an unreasonable amount of time there after I left London” he admitted. Somewhat at a loss for words, John simply patted his friend's arm affectionately.
Changing diapers should be an unpleasant thing to do, but it isn't. I love taking care of Maddie, who would have thought. But today my mind is occupied. Postcard day. The last few postcards showed a steady healing of his soul.
