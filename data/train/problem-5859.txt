"You said you wasn't gonna get divor'sed, Papa," Peter whispered harshly, "You
He looked down at Sammy, babbling at the baby and laughing when he would babble back.
Tony whispered breathy encouragements as he stroked Steve through his orgasm, bringing his hand up to his lips to lick off the come on his fingers.
"Well, Sammy is a baby. So I baby talk him." Steve explained, reaching to play a little with Peter's hair. "And although you aren't a baby, you are still my baby, Pete."
"All right then. We'll get you packed and we'll drop you off in a little while, okay bud? Then you'll get cookies." He laughed, ruffling Peter's hair.
Steve moaned at the first bit as Tony pressed in, rolling his hips as he adjusted. When he was more comfortable, he slowly sank down onto Tony, a string of quiet moans leaving him with each inch downward until he had Tony fully in.
"If you butt-dialed me while Stark's sucking your dick I'm going to kill you," he announced, grinning at Steve's splutter.
Peter grinned over at Steve, giggling softly.
"What kinds of baby foods would Sammy gets ta eat?" Peter asked as he bit into a donut.
"Take a guess. Only one chance though." Tony ducked his head to kiss at the head of Steve's cock, slowly taking him into his mouth.
"Up," he demanded.
He smirked, running his fingers over the blond's neck.
Tony blinked.
Steve turned around with a chuckle, seeing Peter zip around after being so tired before.
"'Kay. I understand," he replied, "No handcuffs. However, I like handcuffs on me, so if you're brave enough to tackle me down, don't hesitate."
So he’d thrown himself into the task of building Steve a present. Something one of a kind. The type of gift that would leave a lasting impression on the alpha long after they’d parted.
“You can chew me out all you want, Tony. You’re dreaming if you think you’re getting another drop.”
I also wasn’t sure whether I wanted to take this fic to the next level of depravity or not and include knotting in the story, but then I was like, ‘self, what are you doing? This is already a nanny ABO fic, go big or go home’. So knotting is a tag now, I guess.
The beta—Amara—was older than Tony and Darcy. Tony guessed she was in her mid-30s. She had emerald green eyes and was wearing a string bikini of the same color. Her smile was as fake as her spray tan.
They might not have been true mates, but Tony was finding it increasingly difficult not to believe Steve hadn’t come into his life for a reason.
do better. Provided you’re, uh, still willing to teach me...”
, his body warned him.
“I have had it with these motherfucking Hydra agents on this motherfucking SHIELD helicarrier!” the 80-foot-wide image of Nick Fury yelled on screen.
“Oh. I almost forgot.” Remembering the tablet he was lugging around, Tony handed Steve a small, black knapsack. “Here. The screen’s as good as new. I also tweaked some of the glitches in the operating system. It should run faster and hold a longer battery life now.”
?” Steve repeated harshly.
“You don’t.”
“Jesus.” Tony shook his head. “Don’t answer that. I don’t want to know.”
Tony expelled the voice before it could do more damage. “My choice is for you to save your heroics for someone who wants ‘em. Anyway, don’t worry your pretty blond head about it. You’re leaving soon. It’s not anything you need t’ be concerned about.”
Something had to give before he died of blue balls.
Something made him move. Made him slide his hand into Steve’s, entangling their fingers together. Inhaling sharply, Steve tightened his fingers around Tony’s, his blue eyes widening like Tony had just given him something special. Like Tony had just given him the moon.
“It’s not like that,” Tony defended stiffly. “Yeah, he maybe says those kinds of things sometimes…but it’s nothing. He’s temporarily confused and thinks he’s got some tiny, harmless, inconsequential crush on me. It’ll pass. We’re just friends.”
Tony had cried an ocean of embarrassing tears. All the tears he’d spent decades keeping at bay.
He didn’t for one second think it’d be that easy to get rid of her.
Tony did a double take. “Really?”
“A character in an outdated movie from 1993. Also known as, before your time. Try to keep up, will you.”
He met his own eyes in the mirror, his pupils large with adrenaline.
Did the teenager even realize the implications behind half the shit he said?
Not wanting to spit in the face of Steve’s generosity, he tried to minimize his grimace as he forced himself to swallow.
Tony didn’t move his leg away.
The battle was lost.
The phone rustled before Nat came over the line. “Nanny Tony?” she said in a small voice.
If he had to go through another heat, then the only person he wanted to share it with was Steve. Tony would be in good hands. No hands were safer.
. “Life.” The teenager was all he could think about. It was so bad that he was being plagued by an itch under his skin like the alpha was actually there.
And, god, it was about to get worse.
I hadn’t planned to leave it off there, but I had to cut the chapter for length because it somehow became the longest one I've written and I didn’t want it to be *too* long.
He knew he was being an unfair, ‘woe is me’ jackass, but he couldn’t make himself stop. His brain-to-mouth filter was rusty on the best of days, and after copious amounts of alcohol, it was basically nonexistent.
And then pray the effects lasted until the end of summer.
. Half-crazed. Like he was on the verge of losing it completely. His blues eyes were scanning obsessively over Tony, honing in on every detail, as if he could somehow commit every last pore, eyelash, and hair follicle to memory. As if his gaze could hold Tony there. Could keep Tony with him.
He knew that drowning didn’t look like drowning—not in the way it was typically depicted in the movies.
“Tony…” Again, Steve looked like he desperately wanted to believe Tony’s reassurances. His breath rattled shakily, expression strained. “Don’t say that if you don’t mean it.”
Having this much contact with a highly compatible omega—and not being given any relief or allowances to claim him—had to be costing Steve. If he felt anywhere near as wound up as Tony, he’d be teetering on the razor’s edge of his control.
It wasn’t Tony’s first run in with the dictatorial dance instructor version of Natasha. Her parents had started Nat in ballet when she was three. They counted on him to make sure she was keeping up with her practices. Sometimes that entailed pretending he was studying ballet himself.
perfect? “Oh. That’s nice.” Tony feigned a glance at his wrist even though he wasn’t wearing a watch. “Wow, would you look at the time? I can’t believe it’s so late already. I really should be going. I have important errands and, uh, business to attend to. Busy, busy, busy. That’s me.”
“I can do more cartwheels than you!” Natasha yelled as she tumbled around the yard.
“Off me. Move it. Your bony butt is poking me—”
There wouldn’t be any part of him left that wasn’t Steve’s by summer’s end.
“…Am I not allowed to call you?” came Steve’s amused sounding reply. His voice was every bit as masculine and un-teenage-like over the phone as it was in person.
The last thing he remembered was a gentle stroking against his cheek; the safeguarded feeling of the alpha’s gaze watching over him.
He’d ruined a perfectly good cup of coffee is what he’d done.
“You’re hogging all the good shade.”
Being in the same place as his overprotective best friend and overprotective more-than-friend was going to be what finally killed him. If he made it through the night without being smothered under the combined weight of their territorialism, it’d be a major scientific breakthrough.
“Oh.” Tony blushed hard, his chest giving an uncomfortable squeeze because he still wasn’t used to emotions of the warm and fuzzy variety. “Okay, then.”
He’d given up on being happy a long time ago. It wasn’t in the cards for him.
“Yeah. Summer’s my favorite season,” Steve said without looking up from his paper. “I wish it lasted all year round. I’d live in the water if I could. It used to drive my mom crazy when I was younger—I never wanted to get out of the pool.”
Tony repressed the thought as soon as he had it, his heart squeezing painfully.
.” Anything, as long as Steve put his hands on him.
Once done with the cloth, Steve retrieved Tony’s boxers and helped him slide them back on.
Steve Rogers was, if possible, even better looking than he remembered.
"Chew your food before talking. Set an example,
"Tony? Are you in there?" He called out curiously.
"That's a good boy, such a good boy," Tony soothed, waiting for Steve to be spent before taking Steve's and his own condoms off, tying them and throwing them away.
"Okay. Okay, just...just wait until we get
a sexy Walmart.
Tony flushed at that, diving into Peter's room to grab new underwear and his shark pajamas.
"Anyway, Tony, don't ever hide things like that from me. I can help you if you ever need help." Steve whispered, running his hand through Tony's hair. "You don't have to say anything if you don't want, but don't block the bond. I don't block it from you. There is no reason for me to."
The brunette looked up at Steve, a little weirded out.
Once Steve was a distance away, Pepper looked to Tony and started to communicate with a hushed yell.
"Exactly. You get paid to do what you do now. Unless you don't want to get paid," Tony snickered, "I mean, I can pay you in blow jobs, if that's what you want."
"I love you, too." Steve whispered back happily. "But you make me happy and warm just being you." He kissed sweetly at Tony's neck with a hum. "I appreciated what you do, though. So very sweet of you, babe."
He dragged the picnic basket out to the kitchen, leaving it at Steve's feet.
The female student looked back at the woman, semi-accepting the sudden permission. The woman extended her hand towards Tony, which he graciously took in a handshake. The woman smiled at Tony and spoke again.
He smirked, scooting backward to tug off Steve's slippers and khakis, tugging off his own ascot before helping Steve out of his shirt.
desserts for breakfast?"? Tony interrupted as he put Sammy in his highchair.
"And I want to give you everything, Tony. Everything I can give." He answered sweetly, eyes fluttering closed. "I love you so much. I just want to take care of you... Keep you safe and loved..."
Steve nodded carefully, grabbing Tony's hand as they headed back to the house. He had never heard of movers going that fast with everything with it all intact, but Tony trusts it. He helped get all of the doors open, picturing different things in places.
"No matter what, you will always be perfect to us. And that’s all that should matter. Because we love you and you'll always be our first baby boy."
"Tony, wait. I need to talk to you."
Tony laughed at that, propping some things up in the suitcase before finding what he was looking for. Making sure Steve wasn't looking, Tony wriggled out of his jeans and boxers, tugging up chocolate edible underwear that Bruce had given him as a joke. He folded his clothes up and put his shirt aside, grabbing the chocolate lube before going over to Steve. He tossed the bottle on the bed, straddling the blond's waist.
"Would it have real web shootas 'n everythin'?!" Peter bounced even more, Steve scooping him up.
"Anything and everything," Tony grinned, sitting on the edge of the desk with his legs crossed, "Whatever you want, babe."
"Hey now, Steve. All that actually can wear anyone down if done enough, okay? And you're still getting used to actually having legs and walking. Takes a while to build that kind of strength up." Tony explained, shutting the trunk of the car and carefully grabbing Steve's shoulder in assurance. "There are more ways of being strong, y'know? And no amount of evil sea witch magic can take your strength away. ' Cause that heart of yours? What I've seen of it, its Herculean."
"Hey there." Steve said with a sigh, falling back on the bed. "Little bear's asleep. You sent the other out?" He asked softly. "I'm still miffed at Clint and Bucky."
Sammy took his prize happily, examining it by chewing on it and making a content garble.
"Yeah---yeah," Tony mumbled, a shy tint coloring his face, "Later."
I'm eager."
"Ew, gross. Didn't you do enough of that while you were gone?" Bucky said with a smirk as he came into the room, it dropping when he saw blood from Peter's nose. "Okay, I swear that wasn't like that when you were gone."
"I know, but whatever. Indulge me."
Tony whined in his sleep, hands fisting into Steve's shirt. He moaned softly, pressing his hips up into Steve's hand.
"Alright Jay, do your magic, buddy. Erase all history, and up the protection level to five. Add in an override code, eighteen digits, and send it to my phone, under Steve's name."
"I'm going to play with my tinker toys," Tony hummed, fetching his glasses from the bathroom rather than his contacts, "I've got some micro wiring to do."
"I'm gonna get it, and finally make a home bar like I've been wanting to," Tony replied excitedly, washing the soap out of his hair, "It's a tropical thing, with rum, cherry liquor--"
Tony nodded in silent agreement, still humming to himself. "We'll see," he sing-songed.
"Then we can get you some fluffy handcuffs. I don't feel comfortable about mentioning my estimated penis size in public, please." Steve whispered, the tips of his ears and the back of his neck heating up.
"Love you so much, Tony." He whispered, leaving a light kiss on Tony's lips before falling straight to sleep.
t for me."
"Daddy is goofy. In case you couldn't tell." He whispered. "A big goofball."
Steve giggled as the boy bounced in his arms, looking to see the penguin plush.
"Hey you, don't eat your fingers," Tony laughed, pulling Peter's thumb from his mouth, "Want me to get your binky to chew on?"
"Yeah!" Peter wiggled excitedly. "I want Sammy ta come home so's we can show him 'round da house and make 'im comfy." He said firmly.
Tony hummed appreciatively, not noticing Steve's glance at his bruising hips.
"Whichever sounds interesting to you. Or not, depending on if we choose to just completely ignore it and do other things on the couch." Steve chuckled as he followed Tony downstairs.
Tony nodded softly, grabbing one of the pillow off the bed and putting it on the floor, kneeling down on it. He looked up at Steve, a begging look on his face.
"Sorry 'bout that at the beginning." Steve apologized, kissing Tony's face out of breath. "For some reason I didn't realize that you wanted to go rough. Sorry."
Tony just stared at the woman, exhausted from running. It took a few seconds for him to realize what she was talking about. Steve.
"I'll leave ya to your project thing. I'm going to go meet up with Natasha in the gym.".
He laughed like it was a joke, missing the pained look on Steve's face.
They stayed locked together for a minute or two, until Tony pulled off, hissing slightly.
"Mmm, I love you." He grinned sweetly. "This all seems great and we haven't scratched the surface of our time yet. Can’t wait to show you your late Christmas present."
"A kitty would be nice, but Daddy is allergic to kitties, Peter. Like what happened with you and the shrimp." Steve answered the boy softly, apologetic eyes and all.
"I know, feels good, yeah? That's called a 'drop'. It's probably the best part of a subbing experience," Tony explained, "You'll fall asleep, okay? Let your body readjust. When you get up, we'll play some more, alright?"
Since Tony was fifteen years old, he’d wasted countless hours futilely wishing he’d presented differently. But, for the first time, he found himself making a different wish. A wish in which he was still an omega.
And maybe that made him a selfish bastard, but so be it.
“I’m sorry about your book,” the alpha continued, holding up the soggy, limp cover that read ‘Nuclear Physics: Experimental and Theoretical’. “It seems a tad waterlogged.”
“The problem is that I said no,” Tony said stiffly. He tried to yank his arm free, but Brock’s grip only tightened. Apparently, the assholes were out in full force this week. Lucky him.
Going for a walk down a park trail? Points for effort, but said walk rapidly progressed into desperate, seeking kisses against a tree, instead.
“One day you’ll let me,” Steve vowed, that infallible, youthful confidence back in his voice.
He was still smarting from his week of Steve withdrawal. He craved some kind of contact. Something to heal the miserable bleed of longing that had been wearing him down for days.
But he wouldn’t trade the feeling of having Steve looking out for him for the world.
Steve had seen the ugliest, most damaged, hidden parts of him...and he still wanted him. Wasn’t turning away. Wasn’t pressuring Tony for further explanations or for Tony to give him answers that he wasn’t ready for.
He couldn’t believe the night before hadn’t scared Steve off.
If someone had told Tony a month ago that he’d be willingly sitting across from an alpha—and a younger one, at that—wishing for said alpha to put the moves on him, he would’ve bet Dum-E’s memory chip that they were wrong. And laughed. A lot.
“What tipped you off?” Tony slurred, liquid sloshing around the bottle as he lifted it to his mouth for another swig.
“Don’t need them. Cutting off contact with the alpha works for me. In fact, he’s already gone. He’s dust in the wind.”
“Nothing big. Just, oh, you know, selling me to another alpha. Ain’t she a peach? Mother of the year, that one.”
pretty. Are you and she…?”
“Let’s get one thing straight,” Tony informed the teenager. “This isn’t a Netflix and Chill situation. When I invited you over to watch
“Don’t everyone choose me all at once,” Darcy joked dryly when it became clear that Rhodey and Steve were about to start vying for a position on Tony’s team.
Yeah, he’d been concerned about what his friends might think of their age difference. That was a factor. But if he was being completely honest with himself, the real reason he’d tried to keep their social circles separate was because he knew the deeper he embedded Steve into his life, the harder it would be to say goodbye.
“Share my heat with me,” he said.
“That…” Tony’s forehead creased, “is an awful story.”
“Nebula,” Rhodey informed him.
And for one bright, glorious second, the bad memories couldn’t touch him.
Now, though, he was beginning to have second thoughts.
. Hearing that had hurt. “It’s okay, pumpkin. Nothing bad happened to me. That’s what we have lifeguards for. And why we never swim in the deep end.” Trying to lighten the mood, he changed the subject. “I could use your help tomorrow morning though. I want to make our special stackable chocolate chip and raspberry waffles. You in?”
, he tried to tell himself.
Tony barely scolded him for it.
The teen hadn’t even given Tony a proper kiss goodbye when he’d left. No, Tony had gotten a chaste kiss on the forehead, instead.
Uh, oh. “It concerns me why you want to know.”
There was no two ways about it: he was fucked. Possibly literally.
He wasn’t three sheets to the wind—no, that was far too few sheets. He was 3000 sheets to the wind.
Nat stilled, as if her excitement was too much to process at once, and then she tore off towards the front door like she couldn’t understand why they weren’t at the park already.
The alpha likely didn’t make a point of celebrating his birthday with every hookup who crossed his path. Maybe the nature of their relationship simply precluded Tony from being involved.
“I’m making it my business,” Rhodey pushed.
The damn things were so Steve whipped, he’d already stumbled across the room and was opening the door before his sluggish, inebriated brain could caution him against what a stupid move it was.
Sure, the media liked to spread fanciful tales about some ‘lucky’ omegas being able to ‘sense’ their true mates, but Tony knew that was all bullshit. It was a concept made up by Hollywood in order to make money off of gullible romantics. And it definitely wasn’t what was happening to him now.
“You’ve been alarmingly quiet and monosyllabic all week, which in the world of Tony Stark is frankly unheard of and always a bad sign. I haven’t caught you texting Steve in I don’t know how long, when before that was all you seemed to be doing.
“Dunno. I wanted to. Is that okay?”
There was no way he was moving. He’d totally make fun of himself later for thinking it, but it was hard to deny how perfectly he fit against Steve’s chest. Almost as if the space had been made just for him. The alpha was such a strong, comforting pillar of support around him that Tony could feel a huge mass of tension releasing from his body.
, the needy omega in him rejoiced.
Steve was at his side in an instant, his big hands steadying him. “Careful, baby. Take it easy,” the alpha’s breath tickled his ear.
The teenager sounded like he’d been the one brought to his knees, voice hoarse and wrecked. “Tony...that was...you’re amazing.”
“To eat,” Steve clarified, a smirk edging his lips like he knew where Tony’s mind had gone.
“Right,” Tony said wryly. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
“You know what they say, sun’s out, puns out.”
“Oh, you’re
Thanks again for all the comments/kudos/bookmarks. They encourage me so much. Just knowing that there are actually people out here who are enjoying this story and want to find out what happens next blows my mind and gives me the ultimate warm fuzzies.
, an annoying, sentimental voice in his head piped in.
No longer resisting being comforted, he ducked his head into Steve’s shoulder, curling into the alpha’s touch and clinging to him like he would a lifeline.
“Ssh, baby, I’ve got you.” Steve made another rumbly, soothing noise. “I’m here.”
“But—”
“Right. Happy to be of assistance,” he joked to the small, sloshing wave she’d left behind.
“You’re fucking kidding me,” Steve swore at the TV. “What the hell was that? That pisshole umpire wouldn’t know a foul ball if it hit him in the face.”
“Are you close with your dad?” Tony found himself asking. The teen was exactly the type of son Howard would have preferred.
. I need—I need—”
Steve looked puzzled. “I am here, Tony.”
Tony moaned and squeezed his eyes shut. Despite his body’s demand for more, his inner muscles clamped down on the intrusion. Dark memories clouded the present, warning him of the past he longed to forget.
“Put your arms above your head and hold onto the bed frame,” Tony had instructed heatedly, kissing and nipping his way down the alpha’s naked chest. “If you let go, I’ll stop.”
“I have to be in the pool to hold your hand?”
to be Steve’s mate.
“Okay! I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” he relented, snickering.
Everything about the teen’s body language radiated ‘fight me’.
that had taken him over.
“It’s Bucky. B-U-C-K-Y,” the boy scowled.
“You don’t have to,” the teen pledged gruffly, like he had to be damn sure Tony understood him. “I know they teach omegas that it’s your job to keep us satisfied, but that’s all a load of bullshit. You don’t have to give me orgasms to keep me around. Or to make me happy. Or because I'm an alpha and you’re an omega. I'm here because I want to be. I couldn’t take it if...if you weren’t enjoying yourself—”
Honestly, what else had Tony expected? That Steve had seen something special in him? That he’d fallen for Tony’s incredibly flawed and not-so-sparkling personality? That he’d choose Tony over every other omega in the world to be his mate? Not a chance.
“Bucky’s bringing pizza?” Tony fumbled with the pot, almost dropping it on his way to the sink. “Bucky’s coming here? Now?”
The teen shrugged. “Yeah.”
“I know it won’t,” Steve clipped. “Start looking for another job.”
“Sure did. You think I’d miss an opportunity for this kind of irony? Few joys in life surpass getting to watch a robot dance ‘the robot’. Try and name one. I’ll wait.”
Big shout out to everyone who leaves kudos/bookmarks/comments/follows.
Had he been wrong to assume Steve would accept?
“Or…?” Steve rumbled. His eyes fell to Tony’s lips.
How was he supposed to wake up in the morning with the knowledge that Steve was out there in the world, and that Tony couldn’t be with him? That Steve’s true mate was someone else?
“Whatever you say, babe. Are you cold now?”
“I’m not even sure I can kiss you again without having another meltdown. So, you know, there’s that to look forward to.”
They ate in companionable silence.
Tony only mewled back at him, shakily standing and leaning back into Steve's chest, closing his eyes at his warmth.
"Stark's a sneaky bastard, that's why," Bucky replied, pouting at Natasha, "Tomorrow's fine, I gotta go,
"This sort of stuff is your clarification." Steve stated quietly. "You purposely place yourself in ways for me to pay attention to you in ways I should not. Especially when you know how I feel and you have no intentions of pursuing that endeavor."
"You know what I want, Rogers. It's been two weeks and my bond is throbbing," Tony muttered, gently sucking on Steve's collar, "Carry me?"
"Sorry," he croaked.
"Yeah, nightstand, should be in the back," Tony groaned, "Please, go get them and go to the desk--"
"Oooh yeah,
Steve let out a careful moan from the sensation, hips twitching upwards for a moment into the touch. Tony smirked over at him, work-calloused hands helping guide his own and developing a rhythm.
"Sending fees?" He asked, looking up.
He grinned, drawing Steve in for another kiss.
Peter finished off his cookie and grabbed his penguin, cuddling it and looking up at Steve.
"Mmhm," Tony raised an eyebrow at him, flicking flour at Peter with a smirk, "You might stay small with a comment like that, squeaker."
"You want to know something that makes this absolutely perfect to me?" He asked softly, earning him a nod from Tony.
Sammy fussed softly in Tony's arms, reaching up and grabbing at Tony's beard. He smacked at Tony's chin with a little giggle.
Peter leaned back in Steve's arms and groaned.
"Okay, silly bear, whatever you say," Tony laughed, taking Steve's and his luggage, "I'll go put this in our room, okay?"
"I might just take you up on that. I'll probably have my father/son day with Peter tomorrow then." Steve hummed softly as he washed himself off. "Then I can spend the day with you today and I'll have time with both my favorite boys."
He smiled at the man, a hunger in his eyes.
"Hey, it's nearly eight," Tony murmured, checking his phone, "Do you wanna get him bathed and in his pajamas while I turn down his bed?"
"I'm going kid, holy sh--shoot," Clint ground his teeth, taking the car keys from Bucky.
He let his eyes glaze over slightly, sinking back into Steve's warmth. He yawned and closed his eyes for only a second, easily falling asleep.
"Maybe when he is making things, but the rest of the time is what I worry about." Steve explained, putting some of the blueberries in the mix and handing some to Peter to toss in. "He's a troubled man."
"Carrots," Peter decided, "An' apples. An' deh pwetzels Daddy weally likes."
The blond smiled widely at that, pulling Tony in a bit tighter for a hug.
Tony grinned triumphantly.
Tony's expression softened at that.
"Ah, yes-- mo ghrá taibhseach ... Feel so good in me--".
"Ow." Steve deadpanned, grumbling as he rolled onto his stomach.
Steve grinned so big, he was practically beaming. He nearly let out an excited squeal before bringing Tony into a deep and excited kiss.
Teasing, a date, more sex, and more cuddles.
"How's 'bout you stay here. I'll find Papa, den we come and gets you." Peter explained, running off to help Steve fix Tony's present.
He shrugged, padding over to put his head in Steve's chest, breathing him in.
"I'm still giving him notes. He's not the best at knowing what to do when someone is sick." He murmured after he was off the phone. "He'll be here in ten minutes, okay? Take your aspirin and drink your water before then."
"Last gift?" Tony prodded hopefully.
"Probably because, other than my roommate, you are the first human being other than my parents that I've ever really gotten to talk and hang out with.".
. I'd
Thankfully, they got home without incident, allowing Tony to take Peter up to his bed.
The blond sat and sketched his husband as the man worked, keeping an eye on him in the process as he worked. He wasn't even sure if Tony knew he was there.
Tony bit down on Steve's neck to keep from crying out as he came, stars dancing in his eyes as Steve still pounded into him.
"Mmm?" Pete looked up, effectively smearing blood over the front of Steve's khakis. He reached a hand up, blinking as he pulled it back, stained slightly red.
"Whaaaaat? How do you know? Papa might be a girl," Tony teased, ruffling Peter's hair dry, "You haven't seen him, have you?"
The merman stay silent for the moment in thought. He and Tony were off to a great start, and three months had to be enough to be able to find something to keep him tethered to the land.
"Peggy? Like, 'don't call yourself a slut' Peggy?" Tony asked, heart twinging in relief.
idea," He hummed.
Tony reached across the table to lace his fingers with Steve's.
"Absolutely. Just telling Peter how you've got to put on clothes." Steve hummed, kissing Tony back happily.
Peter quietly spooned the treat into his mouth, not really tasting it. He ate about half by the time they got home, so he handed it to Steve, slumping back against his chest.
"Steve. Honey. That's
"Ah, a child's innocence," Tony wheezed, desperately trying not to giggle, "Y'know he's gonna find out sooner or later--"
"'Course it does." Steve smiled up at Tony softly. "It sounds wonderful. Thank you." He sighed, eyes falling closed again, but staying awake.
Bucky made sure Tony had left before whispering to Peter.
"Fineee," Tony grumbled, slumping down on one of the island stools.
"Hi," Tony murmured, smooching Steve's neck, "Sleep?"
Steve then quickly looked over at Tony carefully when he heard that.
Tony chuckled softly, leaning down to press a kiss to the tip of Steve's nose before starting to move, taking his time to make sure each thrust brushed against Steve's prostate.
"I don't take to reading those things. Usually just rumors, and no one likes a rumor." Steve explained, playing with the tab of his soda. "Sorry things were rough with your dad. Sure he'd be happy to know your soulmate is not a prostitute, but then again probably would be less than thrilled I’m a guy, by the sounds of it."
He sighed at Steve's giggled, unable to stop the fond smile on his lips.
Peter cried more as Steve carried him upstairs, uncomfortable at the cold wetness spreading through his khakis. He buried his face in Steve's chest and hiccupped, busting into tears when he felt the cold liquid trickle down his thigh.
Tony flushed, burying his face in his pillow while pushing back into Steve. He mewled softly, gently clutching at the sheets. Steve pressed in a few more fingers as he progressed, working Tony open nice and careful.
Steve lightly grinned.
"I wasn't trying to be mean. 'M sorry, just don't kiss Bucky. You have
And when it struck him, it did so like a speeding locamotive.
"Nah, maybe more like a loose-cannon superhero. Super Villains never really get a chance to win. They do have some pretty cool facial hair though.". Tony started to over-dramatically stroke his chin with his last statement, leaving Steve in a small fit of  laughter.
"Best fucking birthday," Tony groaned, nuzzling at Steve's crotch, "I love you, Steven. So much."
"Fuck myself senseless since you have to go to work tomorrow," Tony grunted, sucking on the sensitive flesh, "Think of things I can do you can punish me for."
"He-- Do I look like I know?" Tony grumbled, "I'm-- Nat, can you take us to our son?"
"Why'd ya make me younger...?" He murmured, smirking softly.
"Shhh," Peter muttered, putting his hand over Tony's mouth, "Loud."
8:58 P.M
He got a hand up into Steve's hair, sifting his fingers through it.
Tony nuzzled into Steve's neck, letting himself rest there for a moment. Which, inevitably, turned out to be a horrible idea. He let himself slip, for only a second, and he felt everything crash on him at once: his responsibilities, his failures, his past, his own stupid,
"Oh my god, you know how funny that would be?” Tony snickered, laughter soon turning to a blush across his face, "...Damn, I might have an exhibitionism thing. Or is it voyeurism? Oh well."
"Hey Bruce." Steve said, almost hesitantly. He could feel a light blush start to creep onto his face. "Um, is Tony around? I need to talk to him about something.".
Tony grunted and fell back against his pillow, pulling Sammy up onto his chest.
"That'd actually be best. Wouldn't be good to get him started on something we can't provide ourselves." Steve answered softly, working to fix up some formula.
"He really loves his brother," he murmured.
Steve stopped, looking to Tony a bit embarrassed realizing he was ranting.
"God, I love you so much, Tony." The man whispered, turning to watch the sun start to set.
“U! Baby, Daddy’s sorry! I was so worried. I thought you had followed me outta here early. Are you okay?” Tony gushed, reaching out to pet U’s fur.
Tony glanced at Peter, who was still attempting to talk with a full mouth, glanced down at his own arm, then back up at Steve.
The baby huffed softly, taking the binky from Steve and popping it back in his mouth with a small squeak. He smiled toothlessly up at Steve, reaching up to pat his cheek.
"Sammy do okay, Pete?"
Peter nodded, leaning into Tony's touch.
Tony was about to reply when he yelped, immediately drawing his fingers back. He wiped his finger clean before grabbing his phone, flicking on the light to look into the baby's mouth.
"Are you all right in there, Tony?" He called back from the bed. "What're you doing?"
"Hon?" Tony murmured, immediately going to put his hands in Steve's hair.
He took his time working Steve, relishing in his closeness with his husband. Steve gasped softly as Tony worked, soon evolving into quiet moans and praises. He moved his hand into Tony's hair, carding his fingers gently through dark hair.
"I'm ready to talk... If you are willing to listen...".
He sighed at Tony's nod, but understood.
"C'mon, I want a double chocolate malt," he grinned, rubbing his hands together excitedly.
“I'm always good to my boy," Tony murmured, rubbing circles in his back, "No matter how bad you get, I'll always be good to you." He kissed up Steve's jaw, slowly slipping out of him to let Steve readjust.
Peter let himself down out of Steve's arms to climb into bed, curling under his sheets.
Steve saw as Tony's face seemed to light up in excitement.
"I do."
Tony laughed nervously, flicking his eyes over to Steve as they sat on the couch next to Peter. The boy curled up in between them, head on Steve's side and feet in Tony's lap.
"C’mon, gripes. We'll take my car. No more of that talk." Tony laced their fingers together, trying very hard to not stare at Steve in uniform.
JARVIS had chimed in, still spooking the merman at the sound.
"We may have more in common than originally thought, Rogers," he mused, trying not to flush at the satin rubbing a reminder into his skin, "Also, water."
"Don't care, y'makin' fun a'me," Peter whined.
"I can too wear a shirt forever," He shot back to Steve, mouth full of food, "In fact--"
mommy and daddy have to. But just because someone's mommy and daddy end up getting separated, it doesn't mean that it happens to everyone. Doesn't mean it would happen to you, baby bear." Steve soothed, petting Peter's hair.
Steve smiled back at Tony then back to Babs happily.
"Alright, good plan," Tony smooched Peter's forehead, "Kiddo, can you give Papa and I a couple minutes to talk? Ask Jarvis to turn on the TV upstairs, and he can play Wii with you."
"I kinda-- well, I got really far progress on a project and I
Steve's lips quirked up in a smirk.
Tony nodded and slipped in a third finger, spreading him apart much quicker. "You're already so loose f'me, babe, been playin' with yourself when I'm not around?" he murmured, pulling his fingers out to slick his already hard cock up, positioning himself under Steve. Tony massaged his thumbs into Steve's hips before pushing in, resting so Steve could take time to adjust. Steve's eyes fluttered shut for the moment as Tony pushed in, trying to keep his breathing slow as he adjusted.
“Please. It’s the least I can do. You’ve been…so…” He fades off when Steve smirks at him. “Please.”
Nat should her head. “I wouldn’t say tons…but it seems to me he’ll like anywhere you pick.” Steve groaned. “Not helpful…”
Steve licks his lips as he sits up. “You’re mine,” Steve growls. He straddles Tony, his hard cock jutting out. Steve wraps a hand around his own cock, stroking fast and hard.
Tony remembered that one. Naughty. His retort was lost as Steve leaned down to bite and suck Tony’s nipples. “Please, please Steve,” Tony begged, yanking at his shirt. Steve wrenched off their clothes, throwing them behind him. “Tu veux que je te baise?”
Tony tears the drawing off the paper and tucks it into his pocket.
“Why would I be joking?”
“No! I mean, no there isn’t. And if there were, I’d still want to go out with you.” Steve beamed at him, reaching to take his hand across the table. “Really?” Tony flushed. “Yes. I…I’ve liked you for a while.”
Steve moves to pull Tony’s shirt off, but Tony’s elbows get stuck. He struggles and thrashes and then WHAM! Tony gasps, yanking off the shirt to look at Steve, who is cradling his jaw. “Oh my God! Steve are you okay?” Steve tries to hold back a laugh, smiling. “I’m fine. Wasn’t that hard.”
Steve fumbled for the key card and Tony took his chance. Wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, he began to rub at Steve’s erection through his pants. Steve’s breath hitched slightly and his hands trembled as he struggled with the door. Throwing open the door, he dragged Tony inside.
He gets some soft restraints, probably silk, and brings them over. Tony opens his mouth, closes it like he wants to say something. “Tony, you can speak.”
Tony walks back into his bedroom. He turns around and Steve is standing with a towel wrapped low on his hips. Water drips down his chiseled chest and abs. Absentmindedly, Tony licks his lips.
They’re alone in the elevator and Steve jumps at the chance. He pins Tony to the elevator wall, kissing him fiercely. He takes Tony’s wrists in his hands, pinning them next to his head.
The chat on the walk to Tony’s apartment, but Tony’s heart is pounding in his chest. Will his mouth taste like garlic if they kiss? Is there anything in his teeth?
“Tony?” Tony looks up from his place at the table, where Steve had told him to sit. “What?” Steve chuckles. “Would you like me to feed you?” Tony’s eyes widen. He sputters for a second, scrambling for an answer. No one had ever… ever wanted, ever asked Tony to partake in domestic submission.
T-Man: I SENT A MESSAGE TO THAT HOT TUMBLR ARTIST AND IT WASN’T ON ANON. I SAID HE WAS HANDSOME RHODEY. WHY. WHY DID I DO THAT
“Are you hungry, baby?” Tony flushes at the nickname. “Yes, Sir.” Steve breaks off a piece of toast and holds it to Tony’s lips. Tony takes it into his mouth, humming at the taste. Steve continues to feed him, sometimes giving him a chance to drink some coffee or water.
Pepper answers questions about SI, giving Tony the chance to slip away from the cameras and the artists silently begging him to buy their work, help propel them into the spotlight. So far, he’s not really impressed.
“Tony?” Steve asks, cupping Tony’s face. “Are you alright?”
“Is it the tongue ring?” Tony laughs. “Oh my God, no. I’m just…it’s a lot to deal with.” Steve leans over to steal a kiss. “I think you’re worth it.”
He nods again. “Alright. Drink your coffee while I get everything ready.” He snags a cushion from one of the chairs at the breakfast nook and sets it next to a chair. Tony takes his place, setting his mug on the table and then kneeling on the cushion. His heart pounds. Should he be naked? Should he look down?
“Rhodey,” Tony whined. Rhodey didn’t look up from his homework. “You got yourself into this mess.”
After setting the dishes in the sink, Steve walks to Tony’s side. “Follow me to the living room,” he tells Tony in that voice that makes Tony’s cock twitch between his legs. He moves to stand. With a firm hand on Tony’s shoulder, Steve stops him, shaking his head. “No standing.”
“Of course. Rose petals too.”
“Sir! Oh please, Sir!” Steve lets up on Tony’s cock, but drives his fingers deep. Tony is moaning loud. There’s no one here to hear them, to judge. He lets it all go. “Fuck, ah! S-Sir! Please, fuck me!” He’s babbling. He has no control over the words falling from his lips. It’s a litany of “please” and “fuck me” and “Sir.”
Steve follows Bucky into the club. He nibbles at his lip ring. Dating hasn’t always gone well for him. He gets stood up, ditched. People think he’s a sub, or that he’s not Dom enough. Bucky goes to grab them drinks, his combat boots clunking heavily and the chain on his pants jingling. Steve takes the opportunity to look around. He’s had a few subs, but he hasn’t found the right kind. He’s not quite sure what he’s looking for yet.
The first date is a complete success. Tony loved the exhibit, if his constant excited explanations were anything to go by. Steve listened, which was nice because he wasn’t sure he’d understand anything otherwise. They left the exhibit and went for dinner at one of Steve’s favorite Italian hole-in-the-walls.
Steve feels a strange anger boiling under his skin. The idea that someone could tell this precious man that he’s anything but beautiful. “Would you like to keep your shirt on?” Tony stares at him for a moment. He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head. Smiling at Tony’s trust, he helps hoist Tony to his feet. He’s not sure how old Tony is, but at least older than him. “Lie back on the bed, fully clothed. I’ll let you touch me a little before I restrain you.”
Tony’s body feels tingly as he remembers his request. “The whole weekend,” he croaks. Steve smiles. “Thought you might say that.”
The first time Tony saw Steve speak French was when he watched footage of his fight with Batroc. Steve’s challenge, On va voir, sent a shiver of lust down his spine. The rasp to his voice, the excellent pronunciation… Plus, Tony had “A Fish Called Wanda” level of attraction to polyglots. Could you blame him? Everything sounds sexier in a language you can’t understand.
They had sex right there on the couch, Steve using his French to proclaim his love in one moment and whispering what Tony could only assume were dirty things with a smirk on his face.
Tony quickly IM’d Rhodey.
“No! No, I’ve just…never done it before.” Steve blinks at him and Tony watches the same expression from last night- when he said his scars were ugly- flicker across his face. “Would you like to try it?”
Steve moans around Tony’s cock. The vibrations send a tingle to his entire body. Steve’s hand cups his balls, rolling them gently. Tony’s fingers tighten in Steve’s hair.
Suddenly, Steve grabs the bonds on Tony’s wrists and throws Tony’s arms around his neck. He pulls Tony into his lap, shifting so Steve’s legs are over the edge of the bed. He uses the floor to thrust into Tony. Tony thinks he’s screaming, but he can’t think about anything but how Steve is perfectly hitting his prostate.
“Oh? Well then I’m sure you won’t want to hear about the robotics exhibit at the Museum of Science?” Steve looked up at her, eyes wide. “Nat, that’s perfect!” She smirks, sipping her tea. “Of course.” Steve types frantically on his laptop. “Thank you, Nat!”
“Would you like me to feed you?” Steve asks. He’s shirtless, which gives Tony the chance to look more at the mix of colors and designs that extend down one arm and the ribs on the other side. Steve’s sandy blonde hair is a bit mussed, his bangs floppy in front of his eyes. He’s skinny, bones poking out, but he seemed to have handled himself just fine the previous night. Tony’s face feels hot at the rush of memories.
The car came to a sudden stop. The driver said something and Steve slipped out from underneath Tony, opening the door. Tony gave chase. He needed Steve to block his bulging erection from anyone who might want to snap a picture.
Tony takes a deep breath to give an answer in an even voice. “What could we try?” Steve smiles bigger. “Well, we could start with seeing each other naked. And if you want we can try handjobs or blowjobs, or just stop with nakedness.”
They walked back to the tower to burn off their lunch, chatting happily. Steve liked to people watch; he figured it was the best way to adapt to the new century- by understanding the people. Tony was happy to explain gauges to a stunned Steve.
“As much fun as tonight was, I’d like to take you out on a proper date.” Tony sits up quickly. “You’re joking.”
Tony pushes the door open, stepping inside to kick off his shoes and set down his keys and wallet. “Can I get you anything to dri-mmf!” Steve closes the distance between them, tilting Tony’s head up for a passionate kiss that leaves him dizzy. “Steve,” he croaks.
There are boxes lined against the hallway. “How’s the move coming St-” Tony’s words catch in his throat as he walks into the room. Steve, Captain America, the Star Spangled Man with a plan is contorted on the floor of his room, desperately trying to fit an allen wrench on some cheap piece of furniture.
Steve smiles into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. He opens his mouth, tongue proding at Tony’s mouth. Tony opens his mouth a little unsurely. Then Steve’s tongue is in his mouth and his brain feels like mush. Steve’s tongue thrusts in and out of his mouth, hot and nimble. Tony whimpers softly into the kiss, body pliant in Steve’s hold.
Steve glanced from magazine to laptop, back and forth. Natasha chuckled, watching him panic. “It’s not funny, Nat! Where am I going to take him? He’s been out with tons of other people. I want our date to be special.”
Tony lets go, wobbling to his door. “Good night, Steve.”
How should he end it? You’re handsome too? Not so bad yourself? Steve took a deep breath and started to type.
That won’t do. Not after one of the best night’s he’s ever had. “I’ll have my driver take you home or to work, or wherever.”
Steve trembles, immobilized by Tony’s tight hole. “Breathe, baby.” Tony pants harshly, but comes down eventually. He’s glassy eyed, gone under already. “So good for me, Tony. Do you want me to fuck you?”
The subs being drawn may be in the thrall of subspace. Their expressions convey complete trust, adoration, openness, even love. Tony steps closer. They all look so happy. Some have marks. One has a hand on their cheek, cupping their face. How can they be so happy? How is it that they get to live and enjoy being a sub? While he-
Steve really, truly fights the urge to find whoever hurt this man and beat the shit out of them. “Well, honestly, I’d like to see you again.” Tony’s eyes narrow. “You want to…see me again.”
Steve, clever bastard that he is, figured it out eventually. They were alone, cuddling on the couch and watching a movie, which just so happened to have French. During the confession scene, Steve turned to Tony. “Love confessions sound so much more beautiful in French, don’t they?”
They’re panting into each other mouths as they grind against each other. Tony feels a little silly, straddled against Steve and grinding like a teenager. Even so, they haven’t gotten very far yet, so this is a welcome change.
“You don’t think so?” Tony shrugged, avoiding eye contact with his boyfriend. Leaning close to whisper into his ear, Steve slowly enunciated in perfect French. “Je t’adore. Je t’aime.” Tony shuddered, a moan slipping unbidden from his lips. Steve nibbled on Tony’s ear, pulling their bodies together.
Steve is practically cackling, holding his stomach and rolling on the floor as Tony stands over the chair, staring at his handiwork. The chair is somehow backwards, half of the legs going in one direction and half going the other.
“Then go ahead. If you want to wait, just tell him. If he’s willing to wait, then you know you’ve picked the right guy.” Tony bites his lip. “And if he doesn’t want to wait?”
While they wait for the drinks Steve has ordered, Steve turns to Tony. “So, Tony, at the risk of sounding like an idiot, why me?” Tony chuckles. “I like the way you handled yourself earlier, with that pushy Dom.” Steve can’t hold back his grin. “The piercings and tattoos don’t scare you away? You don’t seem like the type,” Steve says, gesturing to Tony’s suit. “Let’s just say you’ve piqued my interest.” The bartender slides their drinks toward them and they get to talking. Tony is a businessman, but he’s far from the stiff types Steve usually meets. He’s also an engineer and he asks Steve about his art. Steve finds himself drawn to Tony’s enthusiasm and eagerness to please, even if it’s hidden under a cocky attitude.
Their lips meet and Tony surprises himself. He doesn’t back away, he doesn’t run, he leans in. Steve’s hand comes up to cup Tony’s cheek, thumb rubbing along his beard. His arm pulls Tony flush against him, and Tony practically melts against him. He’s kissing Steve. Steve is kissing him.
Cuddling is also a big thing. Steve is constantly warm. Who needs blankets when you can lie on the couch pressed up against your own personal super soldier space heater?
“My…my chest…it’s a little…scarred.”
“God damn that chair! JARVIS bankrupt Ikea! Swedish bastards!” Steve laughs at Tony, shouting to the ceiling and throwing broken pieces of chair. So cute when he’s flustered…
It was an accident. No big deal. Just have to finish the chair and then I can get out of here…
Tony starts to apologize, but the words die in his throat at the sight of Steve. He’s so muscular. Tony’s never done it before, but he sits up to put his mouth on Steve’s collarbone and touch the firm muscles of his abdomen. Steve huffs a little. “Tickles,” he says breathlessly. Tony’s hands come away immediately. He sits back, embarrassed by his own attempt.
Steve shudders at the sight. He’s definitely under. Tony is panting and his eyes won’t totally focus. Steve pulls out to take off and dispose of the condom. Reaching up, he unfastens the restraints to gently lower Tony back onto the bed. “You were so good for me. Such a good boy, Tony.” Tony preens, tilting his head back in submission. “You can touch me again. Good boy.” Tony’s hands caress Steve’s neck and shoulder, rubbing gently. “I’m going to get a towel and some water, okay? Is that alright?”
Tony loosened his tie slightly, body beginning to feel overheated. When was this stupid conference over?
“Of course, baby. Are you feeling okay?” Tony smiles brightly. “Yes. Yes, Steve that was wonderful.” Steve smiles, kissing Tony’s temple. “I’m glad. You were perfect.”
“Good boy.” He fumbles with the condom for a second. It’s been a while and he’s so god damn ready to be inside Tony already. Properly protected, he slides into Tony.
“Green.”
Texting back, he replies, “Sorry. Can’t tonight.” He hits send, hating the clench in his gut. His phone buzzes. “Aw that’s too bad :( Another time?” Tony shoves his phone into his pocket. He can’t bear to reply.
He places Tony on the bed, who lies back to let his Dom look at him. After so long, it’s like they never stopped doing this. He remembers what Steve loves, just what Steve expects of his sub.
“Don’t move, Tony. You can speak if you need to, but don’t move. If you move, I will punish you.”
When the couple disembarked, they were on each other again. Unfortunately, the elevator was fast enough to prevent any real action. They fast-walked to their room, laughing and hushing each other softly.
Tony flushes and God he’s going to look so beautiful under Steve. He nods. Steve’s hand caresses Tony’s cheek, letting his thumb run over Tony’s plush bottom lip. “Going to need a verbal answer there.”
Sarah doesn’t know if he’s compensating, but he seems happy with his loud music and his odd looking friends. She loves him all the same.
There were requests for more.
That bastard.
It’s Steve. He’s not in his usual attire; he seems to have traded his ripped up jeans and biker jacket for a more hipster vibe. He’s in black skinny jeans and a crisp, white button-up with a skinny black tie. His sleeves are rolled up and he’s wearing multiple rings on his fingers.
“Please, please.” He’s clawing at Steve’s shoulder blades, hanging on for dear life. Steve yanks the ring off and practically roars as he fills Tony, coming hard. Tony’s orgasm hits him like a freight train, slamming into him and shutting off everything but the feeling of his orgasm and Steve’s spurting inside him.
“You know, Tony, we’re in Paris. Maybe we should take a vacation… It will give me the opportunity to speak French as much as possible. You’d be hard all day, on the lookout of the Eiffel Tower, when I ordered our lunch… then I’d take you back to our hotel and fuck you? Aimerais-tu cela?”
Tony could tell Steve was desperate. There were two fingers in him, stretching, coaxing him open in half the usual time. Tony didn’t mind. He just needed Steve. Right now.
“Bedroom, please…I’ve wanted you for so long…” Tony flushes, stiffly walking to the bedroom, leading Steve by the hand. The bedroom door shuts behind them, and Steve is on him again, kissing and licking into Tony’s mouth. Tony moans softly, clinging to Steve’s shirt.
Tony lets Steve lay him back on the bed. He feels exposed, laid out before Steve in the light. “You’re beautiful,” Steve whispers. He says it reverently, like Tony is a piece of art.
Tony tugs on them, to test and to feel the floaty feeling he gets from being at Steve’s mercy. Steve, eager as ever, dives down to suck at Tony’s trembling cock. Tony arches, shouting as Steve slips a finger into him. His thighs tremble as Steve relentlessly licks the head of his cock and quickly adds a second finger.
Tony lights up, pouncing onto the huge bed and lying back obediently. Steve smiles at him. “You’re so good for me. Such a good sub.” Tony ducks his head bashfully. “There are better subs.” Steve furrows his brow. “If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”
“OK so this…goes here and that goes…yes…yes!” With a maniacal laugh, Tony reaches for an allen wrench. It’s just out of his reach, so Steve moves to hand it to him. Tony turns to ask, mind focused on his work. He comes face-to-face with Steve, so close their lips brush.
Steve opened his browser and typed in the letter “t”. Tumblr.com popped up immediately, and he pressed enter without even thinking. His art was starting to get more popular lately, so he’d gotten a few comments and reblogs. Up in the corner was a number indicating a new message. He sighed. It was probably another one of those stupid spam messages.
“How’s that feel?” Tony tugs on them. “Perfect.” Steve grins. Now Tony is completely his. He runs his lithe fingers all over Tony’s chest first, careful to avoid the center disk that Tony’s concerned about. “Knew you’d be even more beautiful like this,” Steve says reverently, “Tied up and hard for me.” Tony moans softly, tugging lightly on the restraints. Steve leans down as he starts to unbuckle Tony’s belt and open his pants. His tongue ring teases at Tony’s nipples, flicking across the hardened buds.Steve sits up to pull off Tony’s pants and his briefs. He spreads Tony’s legs wide, taking in the view of Tony’s puckered hole and twitching erection. “Fuck, baby. Wanna take you apart.”
Steve lies at his side, tugging Tony into a spooning position. Steve’s fingers brush over Tony’s hip, tracing small circles. He whispers praise into Tony’s ear, who hums softly. Steve is nice. Warm. He doesn’t doze off necessarily, but he just…is.
He begins to dig his thumbs into the tense spots in Steve’s shoulders. Steve groans softly, his posture relaxing into his boyfriend’s touch. “Tony…”
“Are you ready, Tony?” Tony looks up. His eyes a little glassy. “Do you want this?” Tony nods. Steve nips at Tony’s inner thigh. “Words, baby.”
They hold each other. Really, that’s the best gift of all, having Steve. Steve kisses the top of Tony’s head. “I haven’t forgotten about your present.” Tony looks up. “Would you like it to be for the whole weekend or just in the bedroom.”
Tony holds back a soft gasp. Steve knows this will be difficult for him- Tony’s never really been able to sit still. “If you’d like, I can tie you.” Tony’s heart leaps. He loves the way that Steve ties him, binds him in intricate ropes and patterns. Not now though. He shakes his head. He wants to try his hardest for his Dom.
They buy some art supplies, and Sarah doesn’t understand why they tear holes in their clothes, paint on the back of vests and jackets. She only freaks out a little when he comes with an undercut that he’s streaked with blue. She does freak out when Bucky helps him pierce his ears with a safety pin. He goes to a piercing parlor for the lip ring. She bans tattoos until he’s 18, but of course he goes out on his 18th with the money he’s been saving to get a tattoo on his rib.
Before he knows it, they’re in front of his building. “Good night, Tony,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s hand. “G-good night, Steve.” Tony waits for a moment, but when Steve doesn’t say anything, he begins to pull away. “Tony, wait!” Steve looks so earnest and a little nervous. “May I…kiss you?” Tony flushes and nods, stepping toward him.
Steve pulls back, whispering, “May I taste you?” Tony nods hesitantly. “Is that ok? Too far?”
After that, Steve was incorrigible. He’d whisper French in his ear at breakfast until Tony was squirming and needed to be excused. He’d say a sharp command on missions to get Tony hard in his suit. It was unfair, really.
Steve stands up, the concern evident on his face. “Tony, Tony it’s okay.” His hand is warm on Tony’s shoulder. “Breathe, breathe baby.” Tony blinks back tears. He didn’t realize his anxiety was acting up. He takes several shaky breaths.
Tony hiccups a little sob. “I’ve never done this,” he admits, more tears falling. Steve looks shocked, then he rushes forward, holding Tony against his chest. “You’ve never done this?” Tony shakes his head, crying into Steve’s pecs. “Baby…Tony, why didn’t you say anything?”
Steve groans, hands grabbing tight at Tony’s ass. He uses his grip to continue the grinding, and finally kisses Tony on the lips. Tony kisses back hungrily, quickly bringing his tongue into play.
He follows the hallway to the master bedroom. It’s a bit rustic, but homey. The bed is large and plush, with warm blankets. The bathroom is attached. It has a shower, but also a huge tub that Tony is certain they’ll want to use.
Tony wakes the next morning with Steve’s arm around his waist. He’s so warm. Their skin a little sticky from sweat and the night before. The night before…
“No, it’s just…I want to suck you, too.” Steve lets out a shaky moan. “Do you want to try first?” He nods, eyes falling to Steve’s hard cock. Steve sits on the bed, swinging his legs over. His cock juts out, huge and perfect. Tony wants to know what it tastes like. “Go slow, baby.”
“Tony,” the man says as he takes Steve’s hand to shake it. Steve squeezes Tony’s hand a little, letting his long fingers brush the inside of Tony’s wrist. Tony bites his lip and looks like he’s holding back a shudder. Tony moves to order drinks, but Steve holds a hand out, silencing him with a look. Tony’s mouth opens and closes in silent surprise, and then he smiles, slow and sweet.
Tony leans down to kiss Steve. “Are you sure you’re ok? You hit your head…” Steve gives him a peck. “I’m fine. Let’s go to bed.”
“Yes,” Tony whined. Steve grabbed the hotel kit from the nightstand, nearly crushing the boxes in his eager grip. He managed to free the lube, liberally coating Tony’s hole and his fingers.
Immediately, Tony sits up to kiss Steve, hands roaming everywhere. His fingers are callused, rough as they trace the lines of Steve’s tattoos. Steve jolts a little when he finds Steve’s nipple rings, tugging gently. “So hot, oh my God. Steve, please.” Steve laughs softly under his breath. “Take it easy, baby. We’ve got all night.” He kisses Tony back, instincts in the back of his brain telling him to mark Tony, to claim him. “Lie back,” Steve orders. He snatches the restraints and binds them to Tony’s wrists.
“What’s your safe word?”
“It’s not like what? It’s not like you could be in public with me? Like I could be Dom enough for you?”
The air is a little chilly, but the thrill of Steve’s orders is quickly warming him up. He pads across the wooden floors of the hallway into the kitchen. Steve has whipped up some pasta and a light salad. He’s still fully clothed and Tony feels the warm sensation of embarrassment and excitement curl in his stomach.
Steve dresses, pulling on his platform shoes and throwing his leather jacket over his shoulder. He leaves his number on the kitchen counter, scrawled onto the newspaper with an ink drawing of Tony’s face.
“Quark.”
“Don’t worry. JARVIS is installed into the house.” Tony looks at him. “When did you-?”
Tony’s mouth goes dry. He cleans up well.
They drift to sleep, wrapped up in each other’s embrace. Tony’s last thought before sleep takes him is how much he loves Steve.
Tony smiles up at his boyfriend. He’s had a lot of firsts in the past few days. He’s glad they’ve all been with Steve.
“Though, it’s pretty funny. I was going to ask you to this same gallery opening,” Steve says as he steps closer to Tony. Tony’s posture stiffens. He can’t be seen mooning over a Dom. He can’t think of anything to say.
“Hi Tony! Are you free tonight? :)”
Steve had insisted on a burger from a mom and pop diner he’d found while on a run one day. For some reason, $15 burgers seemed “overpriced.”
“Green.”
“Yes. Yes, I’m fine.” He leans in to kiss Steve’s worried look away. They fall back onto Tony’s bed while Steve kisses Tony’s neck. Tony tilts his head up, giving Steve better access to nip at the sensitive skin. He gasps as Steve rakes his teeth over his neck, then sucks a hickey there.
Tony clutches at Steve’s shirt. “I built your furniture. I deserve rewards.” He’s pulling Steve close, lips puckering. Steve laughs, light and airy. “We’ve still got the bed frame, the desk, and the bookshelf.” Tony whines, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder.
He turns on the shower. He’s glad he fixed the hot water machine. The water is immediately hot and steaming. Tony steps into the shower. He’s half-hard, the memories from the night before flooding in.
“Your place or mine?”
He breathes through his nose and opens his throat. Steve grips the headboard, taking more. “God I missed your mouth. You were made for this, baby. Made to suck my cock. You love it don’t you?” Tony can’t respond through the deep thrusts, but he moans around Steve’s cock.
“You…the way you’ve drawn u-them. Their submission is…”
“Do you want it to happen?” Tony gaped at him. “Have you seen Steve?” Rhodey snorted. “Yes I have.”
“Can I?” Tony asks. Steve smiles.
“Good! That was good! Again, baby. Do it for me? Breath again.” Tony inhales shakily. It feels better. It’s working. There’s air in his lungs. He mimics Steve’s breathing. Slowly but surely, his pulse stops racing. He can hear what’s happening. There are cameras flashing. Pepper is watching with a horror-struck expression while Steve holds him.
She also knows that boys can go through phases. She doesn’t panic when Bucky and her son come home from the local thrift store with piles of clothes. Steve takes to wearing a worn leather jacket and heavy boots.
“Tony, you know that’s not what I meant. Do you want Steve to be your first?” Tony’s mouth snapped shut and his face flushed crimson. “I…I really like him, Rhodes. I think I do…”
Tony snuggles into the bed. “Coffee?” Steve offers. Tony pokes his head out. “Black?”
There’s a small snap and then Steve growls, throwing a broken allen wrench across the room. He sits up with a huff, then notices Tony at the door. “Tony?”
He can’t. His chest is so tight. The shrapnel must be moving. He’s going to die. His lungs won’t fill with air. “You can do it, baby. Follow me. In-“ he inhales, “-out. Just like that.” Tony does his best to obey. He wants to be good for Steve, but his chest hurts so bad. He can barely hiccup in any air.
Steve reaches for the shampoo. He lathers it and reaches toward Tony’s head. “May I?” Tony nods.
Tony’s phone chimes as the board members exit the conference room. He sighs, expecting it to be Pepper.
Steve’s eyes widen and he comes, splattering Tony’s chest. It’s warm and wet, but Tony doesn’t mind. He’s staring at Steve’s flushed face, eyes shut as he pants.
“Does it matter?” Tony asks. Steve’s body is incredible. He’s firm and warm, and Tony loves being pressed against it. Feeling devious, Tony grinds down against Steve’s lap.
Steve steps closer, letting the towel fall to the floor. Tony’s arms open automatically to let Steve embrace him. Steve kisses Tony’s neck, then licks a drop of water from his heated skin. Tony shudders.
They eat like this, Steve reading the paper and alternating bites between himself and Tony. When he’s finished, Steve stands and puts the dishes away. Tony’s heart pounds. What is he planning next?
It’s new for Tony, and it sends sharp jolts of arousal straight to his cock. He tugs at Steve’s shirt, wanting to see. He knows Steve is built. He’s pretty sure Natasha gets him shirts that are too small on purpose. Steve tries to help, but they only get tangled together. By the time Steve’s free, his hair is going in every direction. He chuckles at Tony’s flustered expression.
Tony hadn’t expected him to stay. But he did. Not only that, but he flat out told Tony that he’d like to date him, regardless of the press. Steve then proceeded to get up and make him breakfast- breakfast! Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone made him breakfast. It wasn’t fancy, but there was coffee.
Tony plops down next to Steve, who offers him the instructions. Tony scoffs, waving them away. “You don’t actually need instructions.”
They fell to the bed together, hands entwined. Steve pecked Tony’s lips, repeatedly, but gently. “Je t’aime…. je t’aime…”
“This is…super embarrassing, but that was supposed to be on anon. I do really love your work, and I would be honored to be drawn by you.”
“Steve this is so good,” Tony moans as he takes another bite of tiramisu. Dinner had been amazing, but dessert had Tony moaning and Steve getting hot around the collar. “I’m glad you liked it.”
Tony can’t decide what he likes the best. Kissing Steve is definitely toward the top of the list. Steve is an amazing kisser. He can be gentle and sweet, or push Tony against the wall and kiss his soul out of his body.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispers, licking the shell of Tony’s ear. Tony shivers, pressing his back into Steve’s chest. “You did so well for me, Tony. Would you like a reward?” Tony swallows. He wants to nod, but he doesn’t want to be selfish, doesn’t want to ask for it.
“Not yet, Tony. Don’t want you to come until I’m inside you.” Tony moans, ankles crossing as he writhes. “Do you need the ring?” Tony nods. He won’t be able to hold back otherwise.
“Mmm…morning Tony,” Steve mumbles into Tony’s skin. His breath tickles, making Tony squirm. Steve’s breath hitches when Tony inadvertently presses back into Steve’s erection.
“Malibu.”
Tony Stark was not supposed to be a sub. He was supposed to be a Dom, like his father and his father before him. Stark men were Doms made of iron. And Tony was the weak link.
Steve picked up French when he was in Europe; it came in handy. Now he was just being cruel.
Someone clears his throat. Steve turns his head and there he is, the man in the suit. He grins at Steve, taking off his sunglasses. He has gorgeous eyes. Steve could spend an entire day trying to get his paints to make that exact color.
Steve squints at him. “Well the money goes to the VA.”
“Yes, Sir,” Tony croaks out. The word sends a shudder down Steve’s spine. “Good boy. Where are they?” Tony points to a trunk in the corner of the room. Steve opens it; it’s full of toys and supplies. His eyes wander over vibrators and plenty of toys that Steve will make sure he tries on Tony later. Right now, he wants restraints and to show Tony what he can do on his own.
“Dear Tony, Thanks so much for following. I’m glad you like my art. You “
Tony’s head turns hard, staring at Steve. “You drew these?” he asks incredulously. “I told you I was an artist.”
Tony swallows. “Yes, Sir.”
He’d been holed in his room for a while, using the expensive set of coloring pencils Tony had bought for him.
“Whether or not they’d like to come with me.”
“Because you’re Tony?”
“A gala opening with Miss Pots, Sir.” Tony hates the sense of relief that washes over him. He likes Steve, but he can’t. Steve is too good for him anyway.
“We’re going to a hotel,” Tony snapped. He shoved Steve into the car, then clambered on top of him, shutting the door. Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and said, “Conduisez, s’il vous plait.” Tony groaned softly, happy the car began to move.
“Not a big-Tony. It’s your birthday, of course it’s important!” Tony shouldn’t have turned around to look at him. He can’t take this big, blue eyes staring at him. “Steve- Can we… can we not make a big deal out of it? Please? I just…”
Tony is numb. His reputation is ruined. He lets himself get moved to the car. Steve sits in the back with him and holds him while he cries.
“No! No I just…nobody ever stays.”
Steve groans and rubs his head. “What happened?” Tony glances behind them. The damn nightmare of a chair has broken under their weight. Tony sit up with an angry huff.
Tony’s eyes go wide as he watches Steve’s cock spurt come all over his hand and cock. His eyes are tightly shut and his mouth his open wide as he moans. He’s beautiful. And Tony did that. He beams proudly. He did that.
Tony sips, drinking obediently. Steve makes sure to touch him as much as possible, easing Tony down from subspace. Tony seems to wake from it slowly, like waking up from a good dream. Steve, with his undercut and pierced tongue and sleeves of tattoos, looks down at him. “You…you’re still here,” is the first thing Tony says. Steve raises one eyebrow. “Do you want me to leave?”
“JARVIS do I have anything scheduled tonight?”
“Don’t be sorry,” Steve says. He kisses Tony’s temple, then rolls out of bed. Tony feels suddenly cold. He pulls up the blankets. “Hungry?” Steve asks.
Steve inhales sharply as Tony puts his hands above his head. Suddenly, Steve’s hands are tight around his wrists as he kisses him hard. “God, Tony. You’re so beautiful. Such a perfect sub.” He kisses Tony again and again, grinding his hard cock into Tony’s thigh. “Been hard since I started drawing you. Didn’t want to keep my hands off of you.” He kisses Tony’s neck, sucking dark marks onto the skin. Tony tilts his head back and moans.
Tony moves behind Steve’s chair and begins to rub at his shoulders. There are crumpled pieces of paper all over the desk. Steve’s grip is so tight on his pink pencil that Tony’s surprised he hasn’t snapped it in half.
—-Half an hour later—-
Steve sets their bags down in their room. “Like it?”
Tony shakes his head. “It’s alright. Just another first.”
Steve didn’t sound accusatory. He sounded hurt. Painfully vulnerable.
Steve had helped him stagger to the bathroom. Had rubbed his back while he’d been hunched over, praying to the porcelain god. Had kept him from accidentally putting face wash on his toothbrush when he’d insisted on brushing his teeth. Had brought him water and made sure he was hydrated, before tucking him back into bed.
Mr. Modok had been an angry little man with a large inferiority complex over being a beta. He’d used his position as a teacher to target and bully any children he’d suspected would later present as omegas.
Something about the comment made Tony’s temper flare. He loathed the way his instincts practically lapped up the praise. He could never shake his inborn omega desire to please.
. It was probably blowing his 18-year-old mind that Tony wasn’t acting like the generally accepted stereotype of a distressed omega. That he wasn’t throwing himself at Steve’s feet, begging for a chance to thank the alpha for saving him. Pinching the bridge of his nose, Tony willed himself to count backwards from ten. His patience was tested even further when Steve nudged a chair at him.
“You don’t have to do that.”
After cleaning his plate—his stomach much more settled now that it was no longer empty—Tony excused himself to take a shower. Getting washed up, brushing his teeth, and changing his clothes went a long way towards helping him feel less like a reanimated corpse. His headache had reduced to more of a dull throbbing—something he didn’t want to give Steve’s terrible concoction credit for.
He had a strict policy against the teenager staying the night. He knew he’d have to send Steve home soon, but he couldn’t bear to be separated from him yet—not after that.
He was a flailing mess of limbs as he detangled himself from the alpha, stumbling in his panic when Steve set him down.
“I know. But you might’ve found it anyway,” Darcy said, turning contemplative as her usual aloof, sarcastic humor vanished from her tone. She frowned. “God, you should’ve seen him when he pulled you from the water…he went totally berserk … especially when we thought you weren’t going to wake up…That was not the reaction of a friend. I don’t know how you haven’t noticed, but he’s kind of obsessed with you.”
“Would you like anything?” he rambled nervously, leading her into the kitchen. “I’ve got food. Actually, no, that’s a lie. There’s only a stack of frozen dinners and a single apple in the fridge but, uh, I have coffee. I could get you a cup of coffee?”
. So what if Tony had been a depressed, brooding loser who’d been counting every last tortuous second they’d spent apart? Steve didn’t need to know that. “Oh, have you been around less lately? I hadn’t noticed.”
The teen’s words made something inside Tony hurt. It was a confusing and good kind of hurt. A kind of hurt he wasn’t used to.
The two brothers started tussling and giving each other a hard time in the type of ‘I wouldn’t be doing my job as your sibling if I didn’t spend at least part of each day annoying you’ high jinks Tony had seen from them before.
“Yes,” Steve answered at rapid fire speed. “Please.”
Tony couldn’t see his own expression, but he was 99 percent sure that he looked like a deer caught in headlights. His stomach knotted as Steve reached him.
Opening himself up to physical intimacy with Steve was a bit like navigating a minefield. He desired Steve above everything, but he could still feel Obadiah’s hooks in him, keeping him trapped in the past.
overreacted. It’s been known to happen from time to time. Chalk it up to my laundry list of character defects.” Making his voice light as to not cause offense even though he wasn’t truly kidding, he tacked on, “Anyway, I didn’t realize alphas knew how to apologize.”
“I feel like I dreamed that,” Steve’s warm breath tickled Tony’s ear. “I never dared to hope... You looked so pretty on your knees, baby. Prettiest damn thing I’ve ever seen.”
A ringing phone jerked him back to wakefulness. Fumbling as he pulled it from his pocket, he lifted it to his ear. “Yeah?” he asked, fighting a yawn.
Tony pulled out some paper plates from the pantry and divvied up the slices, granting Natasha permission when she requested eating with Bucky in the backyard. The kitchen had a large, sliding glass door that led out to the patio, so he’d have no problem keeping an eye on them. He armed the terrible twosome with napkins and made them promise not to make a mess. All too soon, the kids had scampered off, leaving Tony to face the music. Or, more accurately, to face Steve.
He had to get out of the pool. Right the hell now.
Leaning in slightly, Steve cut him off. “Can I kiss you?”
of him.
Tony really must’ve been in a bad way if Steve was actually preaching to him about Rhodey.
He’d been hurled into his past—sent right back there with Obie. The older man’s hand on his neck, pinning him down. His face shoved roughly into the mattress, numb with the poisonous, inescapable horror of knowing there was nothing he could do to get away. Obie’s fingers squeezing, restricting his air. Tony fighting to breathe, to forget, to pretend he was anywhere else while the older man—
(See the end of the chapter for
Though he found it nearly impossible, Tony broke away to gasp out, “You should go.”
“Argh! Let me go, you jerk-faced butthead!” Bucky struggled to get free.
, for god’s sake—so much power over him.
Jesus. Steve was too much. If he was given a quarter for every time Steve complimented him, he’d never have to worry about his bank account again.
He’d been so focused on his own issues that he hadn’t thought about whether or not he’d hurt Steve last week by rejecting him.
Brock had been pulverized, but Steve didn’t have a scratch on him. The beta clearly hadn’t managed to get a single hit in.
Tony fought the urge to flinch as the tattoo on the back of his neck suddenly flared with a remembered, phantom pain.
He moved to push himself to his feet to demonstrate just how
“Keep it.” Steve’s eyes warmed. “It hasn't fit me since JV year. Besides, it looks better on you.”
He gripped Tony’s thighs and pulled them farther apart, spreading him open. “You have no idea how much I've thought about this. Gotta taste you. Tell me I can taste you.”
‘I didn’t see a reason to mention it’ basically translated into ‘you aren’t going to be around long enough to have warranted telling’.
Even if it was the very thing his entire body was rebelling at him not to do.
Nat giggled and smiled, suddenly appearing more angelic than a winged cherub.
They exchanged money and the guy took off, thanking Tony again before he left.
Grabbing onto Steve’s ears, Tony tried to pull Steve’s mouth up to his.
It might’ve been a line, but Tony didn’t think so. Steve seemed far too sheepish for it to be an act, even if it was hard to believe. Tony’s lips twitched, and before he knew it, he was smiling at Steve. A real smile—guarded and tentative, maybe, but real. The first one he’d given him.
Yeah, Tony was starting to get that. “You’re a bit of a freak, Rogers.” He paused as he mulled it over. “But I kind of like that about you.”
After a long series of tests to check his lungs, heart, and cognitive functions, Tony was given a clean bill of health and released from the hospital.
“Tony,” Rhodey said warningly.
“I really don’t like your dad, babe.” The tension in the alpha’s jaw gave Tony the impression that ‘really don’t like’ was a bit of an understatement. Steve was looking at him like Tony had just told him that Howard had murdered a litter of kittens versus merely dismantling a nonliving machine.
It took him an embarrassingly long recovery period before he was finally able to talk again after the teen’s dizzying kiss. He cleared his throat. “I thought I said no funny business in front of the kids.”
Steve appeared at his side like an avenging sobriety angel and confiscated it before Tony could get his hands on it.
“Teenager?” Rhodey asked skeptically.
He didn’t exactly have a good history when it came to being around angry alphas.
The teen wasn’t holding back or taking his sweet time anymore. He was eating him out like he wanted to devour him whole. To consume him. Claim him. Claim everything he was.
“Great suit, Darcy,” a tall, leggy, blonde sneered as she approached them. “Did you get it from the Juniors section at Walmart?”
Not three hours into his and Steve’s date, and Tony was already being reminded of why he’d never be able to have a nice, normal evening.
The teen took that as the highest of compliments. His lips tipped up into a soft smile that reached his eyes.
Getting people to care about him—to stick around—had always been like trying to hold onto smoke. The harder he’d hung on, the easier they’d slipped out of his hands. Even Rhodey, his one constant, still disappeared for long, extended tours in the military.
“I don’t wanna,” she complained.
“We could sign you up for lessons,” Darcy said innocently. “There’s a posting on the wall. I think I read that Steve,” she pronounced it more like
“I’m not, but you said
He hated it so much that he found himself caving, “You know what? On second thought, why don’t you come in? I’m feeling up for a quick tour. But you can’t say I didn’t warn you.”
He grabbed Steve’s arm, attempting to get the alpha to leave with him. The teen didn’t budge.
That wasn’t really a problem for Tony. ‘Unhealthy’ was practically his middle name.
“Hey, man. I’ve got you. Then or now. You know that. You’re my boy.”
Then, while still holding Tony’s gaze in a way that made the omega’s chest feel funny, he reached out and cupped Tony’s cheek in his hand. Leaning down, he nuzzled his face against Tony’s, emitting a low, purr-like rumble that Tony knew, in theory, was a sound that alphas could make, but that he’d never heard before now.
“I do. I do mean it. So can we skip the part where you use your magical Steve powers to make me spill my guts, whereby I say a bunch of sappy and embarrassing things to you, and jump straight ahead to the dirty part?”
Slowly, teasingly he began to experimentally jack his fist. The sight was so unexpectedly erotic he couldn’t stand it. Unable to hold off a second longer, he leaned down and swiped his tongue over the broad head of the teen’s cock.
“Not if you don’t want to.”
Tony’s feet barely touched the ground as Steve whisked him towards a bench located away from the pool.
Steve was transfixed on their point of connection, on where Tony was accepting him into his greedy heat.
He’d been six years old…and his father had been willing to let him die in order to teach him a lesson. To make him stronger. Less weak. Less of a disappointment.
The onslaught of need—of connection, longing, and belonging—that came over Tony was as wild and overpowering as it had been at the pool. Which was bad, because it meant that it hadn’t been an anomaly. Meant that things between him and Steve would always feel this good. Always feel this right.
And what, exactly, did a hurt like that mean?
“You really can’t swim?” Darcy asked Tony, surprised.
She’d made no mention of what his father had done to him. But then, she never did. She’d perfected the art of looking the other way.
He almost choked on the first sip. It tasted godawful. And from a man who could drink cheap, black coffee evocative of battery acid and engine residue, that was saying something.
thoughts. “Geez. I really know how to put my foot in my mouth, don’t I?”
He was in serious trouble.
Nat had wanted to help out, so he’d lent her a little lab coat and protective goggles, too. Then he’d assigned her the task of picking the color of the adhesive. She hadn’t been satisfied simply sitting back and watching Bruce work, however. And because the girl was frighteningly good at stealth, she’d sneakily managed to tamper with the ingredients without anyone seeing her do it.
And anywhere, I would have followed you
Steve pulled back looking at Tony with black eyes with a small ring of blue. “Don't you ever say that you don't matter” Steve whispered, before diving back in, smashing his lips into Tonys before he could say anything.
“You lost me when you left”. Tony said getting up from the floor and walking into the bedroom. Steve stayed on the floor sobbing into his hands. When Tony came back he was holding a little velvet box with S+T  in a little heart on the bottom. The second Steve saw the box, he started crying harder. That was the box he proposed with.
Bruce was the last one before him, and Tony was nervous everyone on the team at some point had heard him screaming the lyrics to black sabith in his lad but this was different and he had a feeling nat wasn't going to go easy on him. Bruce did great singing “Fuck you!”.
“Steve you left me” There were tears in his eyes now too. “Everything we build all the trust, all the love… the family. You threw that away when we left me for someone else. Just because you can't have bucky anymore doesn't mean I'm just gonna be your second choice. I loved you... So much it almost hurt. Then it did hurt. And I spent months trying to get over you, trying to forget you.” Tony sobbed. “I don't love Bucky like I love you. Please Tony I love you, I can't lose you. This ring will never leave my finger.”
“Did you really think we could bounce back from this? Steve, I can never trust you again. I can bearing stand staying in the same room as you. Let alone share a life with you! We're not together and we haven't been for 2 years, and we never will be again. I'm sorry.” Tony apologized. Fighting his instinct to go over and comfort Steve his husband. To kiss him until he was smiling with swollen lips. Instead, he put a little black box in his hand.
“No Steve you don't have a right to Peter at all. I won custody in the divorce, you could have fought for him but you weren't here.” Tony spat “and you bet your ass and I'm never letting my kid get near you. Ever.”
When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was gray. “Huh, I guess I'm on the floor.” Tony whispered. When he finally looked up Steve was standing next to his, shock, worry and hurt evident on his face. “Why are you here Steve?” Tony said looking back at the floor. “Why didn't you let me help you? I always get you through panic attacks. You're not gonna scare me away Tony, I have been dealing with this for years.” Steve said looking hurt, trying to get closer to Tony. “Captain Rogers step back from sir immediately or I will have to use force”. Jarvis stated in an angry tone.
Steve hated parties, before the serum he had never been to one, thought they were gonna be super fun. He went to his first one on his Captin America tour. There were girls fawning over him left and right, but he was only interested in Peggy. All the drunk men being sloppy and disrespect full. The strong smell of liquor, reminding him that he can never get drunk anyone. Yeah, Steve did not like parties.
“That's different and you know it. But Tony we can't let this divide us or the team. You said you're trying to get them back to be part of the Avengers again”. Said Steve refusing to look at the box. “Steve there is no team you have to get that. The New Avengers isn't just the old team with a new name, only a few people from the rogues will be on that team and its full of the new heroes.” Tony said pushing the box towards Steve. “Open it.”
“Ok, Steve the rings are yours and if you want to get any of your old clothes, they are in your old room. I have to go and I can honestly say I hope I don't see you later”. Tony said looking in the mirror on the wall and fixing himself up. “Wait tony we can't actually be done, we're soulmates!” Steve said with fire. “ No, we're not, not anymore.” Tony said pouring the forgotten pot of coffee. “Goodbye Steve.” he said setting down the cup drained of coffee.
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve said smiling into Tony shoulder. He finally set Tony down with a faint blush, seeing Tonys flustered look. Steve took a second just looking at him. He was the person he went to with anything, and after creaking a few jokes he would help. No matter what. He is the most generous man in the world. Steve can't believe he ever doubted that. Tony is amazing and the hottest person Steve has ever seen.
“Actually can I meet you in the common area, I have to talk to Steve.” Tony said glancing over at Steve, then looking back at Stephen with a meaningful look. It seemed they were communicating with looks, which pissed Steve off. If anyone should be able to understand Tony's glances, its Steve. How do they know each other so well? “If you're sure?” he said hesitantly, then let go of Tony and stepped through the portal and with one last glare at Steve he was gone.
Tony just sat there thinking, nat and Steve tried to drag him there conversation once or twice but gave up after a while making tony feel worse. Eventually, the other Avengers started tricking in and the atmosphere lighted. Tony got up to leave after a while, not really in the mood to talk to anyone.
Without looking up from his phone,Tony cried “ Brucie-Bear! Your jacket is in the workshop. “You want coffee? Actually, that wasn't a question, I want coffee so you're getting some”. Smirking slightly, he walked over to the coffee machine and started making a pot. Tony finally looked up, noticing that Bruce hadn't said anything or moved from the door when he froze.
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Steve just relaxed into it, feeling naturally at peace when he should be focusing on other things, like the mission, not Tonys hand sliding slightly up and down his side. “Why do you always do that?” Steve asked sounding kinda dased as Tony laid his head on his shoulder. “Do what?”
“No Steve you don't, you love Bucky. Now please either tell me why your here or just leave.” tony state still on the floor looking up at Steve. “What do you mean... I'm here for you, I know you still have a lot to work through and if you can't apologize right now that's ok. But bucky's back in the ice and I heard you are almost done getting our arrest warrant dismissed, so when that’s done we can go back to the way it was. With us and the team.” Steve said getting on his knees on the floor next to Tony and offering his hand.
But it had been 2 months. 2 months of Steve acting like nothing was wrong, 2 months of Steve acting like it didn't even hurt him and that's what really hurt tony in the end. The realization that Steve wasn't heartbroken at all, Steve never really loved him.
“You know that you don't always have to be in fighting mode. Relax your at a party! A shitty one but a party non the less. Go out and dance captain” Tony said vaguely gesturing at the ongoing party. Steve rolled his eyes “In case you forgot we are on a mission looking for a mob weapon dealer and I am responsible if something happens and I'm not ready because I was dancing.” Steve whispered to Tony leaning close and ignoring the flutter in his stomach.
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride, You're the one that I love
Tony wanted to walk away and forget about Steve, never open this door again. But he knew if he had to get closure or else he could never actually escape the feelings he had for Steve and move on.
Then it was Tony's turn and when he saw which song nat chose for him he almost barfed. He gave nat the worst death glare he could manage but she just shrugged with that stupid smirk. He sighed and presses start.
Steves brain was rolling. He was still trying to figure out the whole loving Tony thing. “Ok Shellhead. Steve said smirking.
And I will stumble and fall, I'm still learning to love
And I am feeling so small, It was over my head
“Tony we have a crack in our relationship but we can fix it, make it better than ever, Tony please just don't give up.” Steve said with glassy eyes still thinking back to that movement, back when everything was still perfect. “Some things are so broken that they can never be fixed.” Tony said voice not wavering.
He sat down at the counter next to Natasha and glared daggers at it. “So tony…” Steve said obviously trying to fill the awkward silence. “Why are you up so early? Your usually not up until way after my run, it's only 6;30 am”.
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
“Daddy!!” Peter squelled, running into the room and laching on Tony's leg. “Hi pumpkin, what are you doing? Our supposed to be at school!” Picking Peter up in his arms.  “Daddy school ended an hour ago its 1!” Peter giggled  “No it's not! You changed the time, you little munchkin. I guess I have to punish you.” Tony said a wide smile on his face. He swiftly turned peter around in his arms so he could hold him with one arm and swiftly started ticking him all over. “Daddy!!” Peter cried leaning into his father. When things finally calmed down, Tony and Peter were left grasping for air. Starting straight at Steve.
This used to be his home, now he couldn't feel more like a stranger. All the photos of him and the rest of the rogues were gone. It was more clean, no more random projects scattered on the floor, no more littered vodka and burden bottles on the kitchen counter. It made him frown. He knows he should be happy, the house is more put together, Tony is more put together. He was always trying to get Tony to clean up and it seemed like he finally did when he was gone. But now it felt like Steve didn't belong, it looked so different from the house he remembered. It was the little things, the ones that didn't feel like the tony he knew. Well, he doesn't know Tony, not anymore. He can fix that though.
“Tony! Jarvis just notified me you were in distress, I came as fast as I could”. Stephen said, not sparing a glance at Steve but walking over to Tony and putting a hand on his shoulder. Steve suddenly felt a low burn of jealousy in his gut. “Hi sorry but Tony and I were having a conversation.” Steve said trying to get the man away from tony. Stephen's eyes narrowed. “Tony why is he here. We are leaving”. Tony looked back at Steve uncertainty in his eyes “ok”. Stephen put his arm around Tony's waist, making a portal for them to jump through.
What Tony wanted to say was yeah I couldn't sleep I was just sitting in my bed thinking about you and how you don't care about me at all. What tony actually said was “sleep schedules change Steve, you just don't know mine anymore.” he realized by the silence that it sounded very passive aggressive, trying to backtrack he said, “plus I was working on a project so I didn't really sleep”.
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Steve finally reacted taking a few steps in and closing the door. He was smiling.” How could he be smiling right now?” Tony thought bitterly. Tony kept planted trying to keep a neutral face, the one he always put on for the press, never for Steve. He knew it was no use, no matter how hard he tried, Steve could always read him, make him crack. But he held trying to only give off bravery.
“But it was never enough, I was never enough. You made my worst fears come true when you left. That Howard was right… I'm worthless, weak and I will never be loved. And what about your team, the Rouges. Will you betray them just like you did us? Turn them in and forget about the people you once called family while they rot in a jail cell, just so you can have your way?”
I know nothing at all
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
He regretted all his life choices when he went to the kitchen to find the one and one Steve rogers leaning on the counter. He seemed like he was in a deep conversation with nat. He thought about just chickening out and going back to his bed to mop, but as he turned around to sneak out Nat called “Hey Tony, you want some coffee you know Steve makes a mean cup!”
Tony was laying on the couch texting Peter about his next decathlon tournament in dc when there was a loud knock on the door. “ Probably Bruce coming to get his jacket. But why would he knock, Jarvis should have let him in”. He sighed dramatically. “ Its 11 pm and I have not had enough coffee to deal with this shit. I'm still in my fucking clothes from working on the new car.” Tony thought padding over to the door.
They were at Central Park, that was where they first teamed up in the battle of New York, it was destroyed but it was rebuilt more beautiful. Steve said that was like their relationship when it cracks, its fixed and looks more beautiful. Steve got down on one knee and told Tony he was the love of his life and he didn't care about Tony's baggage because he will always be there to carry it. He hadn't seen that box since that day, thinking Tony threw it away. Seeing it brought all those memories back to the surface.
“Tony please you said you loved me. Don't go.” Steve cried barely holding back tears. “I did love you and I always will, but you left. You left me, you left our family. Did you know Peter said his first words? He took his first steps while you were gone.”
“Capsical you ok there? You're burning a hole in the counter.” Tony joked. Steve blushed, he was actually thinking about how good Tonys ass looked in that suit but Tony didn't need to know that. “Yeah, I'm good just thinking of a game plan.” Steve mumbled.
Steve took a step towards Tony, reaching out to him. The familiarity of it all intoxicating, both of them. Tony flinched, backing up against the wall, eyes downcast. Steve could still see the fear in them.
“Jarvis override code Captain Shellhead.”
Tony slowly stood up. His husband did not exist anymore. He is dead and replaced with, this Steve. Tony walked all the way to the elevator door, Friday opening it up without saying anything. He stepped in the elevator door and almost turned around. To get one more glance at the love of his life. To turn around and kiss Steve until he passed out. To tell him he loved him 1 last time. But he didn't. He kept his back to Steve as the elevator doors closed while he could still hear choked sobs. He didn't need Steve anymore, he has a family. He is finally happy again.
Now they were trying to make things more interesting. the Avengers can't just have a normal night out. Everyone was assigning each other songs. Tony ended up with Natasha which was kinda disappointing because A he couldn't do anything super annoying to her or else she would slit his throat with her bobby pin and B she was evil.
Steve knew Tony very well, well enough to tell when he was on the verge of a panic attack. He walked over to Tony, instincts taking over to comfort him. Tony flinched back hard when he looked up to see Steve looming over him. It was too much like Siberia, sure Steve's face was concerned but in the moment he looked just like he did when he had the shield right over his reactor. “ GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME”. Tony screamed, everything melting together. He could vaguely hear Steve talking to him, but it was overpowered by the heavy breathing.
Tony stood up and stretched his arms. “Well, we need to get close to the dealer to get evidence. So if you really want to leave soon, come dance with me Mr. America” he said the last part leaning forward putting his drink down behind Steve, whispering in his ear and grabbing his hand”
“I can forgive you Tony, we can work through yes you made mistakes but its ok I forgive you.” he said with a watery smile. “Is your head that far up your ass, that you can't realize, I'm not gonna apologize. I was not in the wrong, you were. You broke the team and you broke me. All for Bucky”. Tony said. “You were trying to kill him, I was just protecting my family.” said Steve  “I used to be your family and your right going after Bucky was wrong. But if you just saw a video of Bucky getting murder and the killer was right in front of you, even if it wasn't their fault, what would you do?” Tony said placing the box next to Steve.
Inside the box was a simple golden ring with a line of blue from the shield on the bottom and a line of red on the top from the suit. In graved on the back is “we will do it together”.
“We can still fix this if we try, both of us made mistakes but we can't let that ruin what we have.” Steve stressed. “What we had, Steve. All that was gone the second you kept secrets from me and abandon our infant son. It's over Steve.” Tony calmly stated though, he felt anything but calm.
Steve's pov-
As much as he hates to admit it he is having a good time, he and Bruce has sung
“Why would I apologize you're the one who tried to kill me, then left me to freeze to death in Siberia. There is no more us Steve, and there never will be again. As for your arrest warrant, I'm doing that because Fury asked me to. He thinks some of you might be eligible for the New Avengers.” Tony said hesitantly taking Steve’s hand to get help up to his knees.
As the door slid open, Steve was welcomed with blasting heavy metal and Tony sitting at his desk focused on a project that Steve couldn't understand. “Jarvis, music.” Steve said in a hushed tone knowing Jarvis would still hear it. He didn't want to disturb him yet, Tony always looked so peaceful what he was working. Completely unguarded.
He made it down the hall before a hand lightly grabbed his shoulder, and was about to shrug it off and say something about lab work when he heard a soft “tony”. He turned to find Bruce giving him a concerned look. Tony just shook his head to say he didn't want to talk about it, thinking that was it he started walking again until he felt the same hand on his shoulder again.
“Yes, Captain” Tony said breathlessly.
Steve just sighed “You never call me by my name. I'm pretty sure you have said Steve once and that was the first time we met.” Steve could feel Tony stiffen in his arms. “Don't know what you're talking about” He took a step back lifting his head up and staring at the ground. Now he regretted bringing it up but it was too late to back down now. “I was fine with it didn't really think anything of it until I noticed that you don't do it with anyone else.” Steve rushed out.
Holly shit! (language) Steve thought. I'm in love with Tony. Steve took a deep breath and tried to calm down when he realized Tony was talking. “-ing, I mean its only fair you get to call me a name.” Tony looked at him expectantly. “Sorry what?” Steve asked looking confused. “What cap got lost staring in my eyes?” Tony smirked. Your pretty close, Steve thought. “I was saying if I keep calling you a nickname its only fair that you can call me one too”
At the time (about 2 months ago), they also said that if Steve and tony were in a relationship tony is compromised as well and could not be use in court.
“I'm not throwing anything away. You did all on your own when you left me, to die. And team? We were never a team, you just tricked me into thinking we were. A real team would never trick me into thinking I'm safe and I finally have a family, then leave me all alone. Actually, scratch that I'm not alone. My actual team is here.” Tony started walking over to the counter, taking slow deep breaths. “In 1 2 out 1 2 3” that was what his therapist told him.
He slowly turned expecting Bruce to give him advice or some shit on how to get over Steve. But what he saw was Bruce looking at the ground with a grimace. “What Bruce?”
Suddenly there was a golden circle in behind Tony. “Tony run!” Steve screamed. He snapped his head back to look to whatever Steve was screaming about then to Steve's shock, seemed to relax. Then there was another man in the room.
Steve practically ran to him, catching his lips in a heated kiss. Tony was pushed up against the counter, hands all over Steve. Neither wanting to let go, knowing this is the last kiss. Steve tried to put all his emotions in the kiss, love, and passion from years of dating. But like all good thing do, it ended. Tony took a step back, hand going over his hair. He started to walk over to the door when Steve grabbed his wrist. “You're still leaving me?” Steve said trying to read Tony's face when he realized he can't. He doesn't know him anymore. “You already left.” Tony said sadly with one more glance at Steve, he turned and walked out the door.
Steve collapsed on the floor with sobs. He lost him, his soulmate, the love of his life. That's when Steve realized he was wrong. It wasn't worth it.
Clint was first singing “pumped up kicks” chosen by Thor (with a little help from Bruce). Then Natasha went singing “daddy lesions” captivating and terrifying. Thor was next with “I believe in a thing called love” hitting every note and getting a standing ovation, chosen by Bruce. Steve sang “kids of America”, which was the best and worst thing Tony had ever seen, best because well it was hilarious and crazy hot seeing Steve really get into the music, and the worst because it made him fall deeper in love with Steve which was the last thing he needed.
Say something, I'm giving up on you
When Steve turned to look at Tony with a nervous expression, he saw it. Absolute shock took over his face in a second. Tony was using what he called “The fake face”. All the walls that took years to break down were back up, and that broke his heart, more than tony already had.
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Suddenly Tony was shoved against the lab table with a hot mouth on his. His arms wrapped around steves neck by instinct as if they had done this 100 times. Steve hungrily slipped his tongue into Tony's mouth, both fighting for dominance, while Tony ran his hand through Steves hair. Steve grabbed Tony's thighs pulling him up so he was sitting on the counter, forcing him to wrap his legs around steves waist.
“Whos that?” Peter said turning his head into Tony shoulder, nervous around strangers. Steve had a mixed look on his face it was awe, fondness and deep sadness. “Not someone you will ever have to worry about.” Tony said voice stone cold. “NO TONY! You do not get to take my son away from me. I have as much right to him as you do!” Steve fumed, but took a step back when Peter looked up at Tony fear in his voice “Daddy?”
Of course, Steve had to go undercover in a party for a mission, there was no way he could say no, that would be bad leadership. If his team had to go, so did he. One thing did make the party more bearable and that was Tony Stark in a suit. Steve swears he got the tightest suit he could find, making every curve stick out. Steve was honestly surprised no one recognized Tony, sunglasses weren't exactly the best disguise.
“I put my mom’s hangover remedy in it,” the alpha offered in explanation.
alpha,” he said coldly, resenting the way his body made a mockery of his denial, still leaking slick and pheromones everywhere. “Now get out of my way.”
“Because you wanted them and I like giving you what you want.”
“Hey!” she objected. “I’m hate-reading it. I’m going to take a page out of Bruce’s book and write a strongly worded e-mail later tonight about everything they got wrong over a pint of cheap beer.”
He was shunned by the majority of society. Shunned by his own flesh and blood. So to have someone
“Here,” the alpha said, handing Bruce his glasses. “Don’t worry about Jeremy. I’ll have a talk with him. He won’t bother you two again.”
is what his life had come to.
He heard Steve huff out a small, startled laugh beside him.
“Promise. Every morning from Monday to Friday. You can’t get rid of me.”
“I wished for it.” The words were barely audible. Broken. His eyes locked on her image in a thousand-yard stare. “I made it happen.”
He hated to admit it, but his desire for the alpha wasn’t purely physical, either.
“It was a fluke,” Tony insisted. “I’m overtired. Delusional. In need of another coffee.”  He slumped pitifully onto a lounge chair, arms crossed over his chest, his heart still pounding. He needed to calm down. Before his scent—however faint it was—got him into trouble.
“Stay tonight. Don’t leave.”
“My father tried to drown me.”
Tony swallowed it all—something he’d hated doing in the past.
Tony shook his head. “Seriously, drop it.”
He cut the thoughts off before they could overtake him. “No,” he rasped. “I’m not pregnant.”
Ignoring the warning bells blaring in his head, Tony reached for the jersey. He was so wound up that he forgot to make sure that their hands didn’t touch. Or maybe he didn’t forget. Maybe he let their fingers touch deliberately.
’ by AC/DC started blasting out of the robot’s built-in speakers, and the bot began to bust a move.
Tony set down his phone. “Now that’s just a bald-faced lie. You love bread,” he denied jocularly.
Steve relaxed. Nuzzling him back, he rested his forehead against Tony’s. “Like I said, babe, I’m not going to push you. Take as long as you need.”
Uh-oh.
“Say it a little louder, why don’t you,” Tony moaned, hiding his head in his hands. “And I don’t want to mate with him. I don’t even know him.”
. He fought them down.
“Meaning, you approve of your present?” He was proud of himself for sounding relatively calm despite the desperate chant of
“You are. You’re pining like a 12-year-old waiting for young Leonardo DiCaprio to respond to your engagement letter, and I should know, because I was that 12-year-old.”
It took everything he had not to look back.
So, this chapter got somehow almost longer than the first three combined... Let me know if you prefer them shorter. :)
A pattern emerged in the days that followed.
The teenager was still in his apartment. And not only that, he was in the middle of whipping up breakfast.
Her cold composure burned him.
“And how’s he doing that?” Turning on the water and vigorously scrubbing the pot with a sponge.
“Sounds productive.”
You guys have no idea how much it means to me that people are actually reading this crazy little fic of mine. <3
His lungs burned with the need for air. And even though he knew he shouldn’t breathe in, he couldn’t help it. He gasped for breath and choked, sucking in water.
His hopes were immediately dashed.
“You’re probably wondering why I called you,” he said, fidgeting. “I’ll get to the point so I don’t take up too much of your time. I have some, uh, medical related concerns I was hoping to run past you.”
“Nothing wrong with decaf? Now I
“Wait, wait—what? Since when? You started dating this guy and you didn’t tell me?”
hadn’t been the one in trouble? What if Brock had thrown one of the kids in the deep end instead?
Tony wanted to know what it was like to be with an alpha like that. To have someone like Steve caring about him. To live in Steve’s world, if only for a little while.
She hesitated for a second, but then nodded, her bottom lip trembling. “You looked like you were sleepin’ but you wouldn’t wake up.”
“Cannonball!” Charging passed them, Bucky landed in the pool with a splash impressive enough to capsize a small ship.
“Why?”
Tony had watched in horror as the entire experiment had gone up like a volcano. The red, sparkly, glue-like substance had shot straight up onto the ceiling and all over the Romanoff’s white kitchen.
“It’s alright if I hold you for a bit?”
across the table—but the alpha wasn’t moving.
It was over too soon for his liking.
He could see her thinking his words over. Eventually, she dashed a hand over her eyes, batting away some of her drying tears, and asked, “If we get really old…will all our hair an’ teeth fall out?”
the memory of Darcy’s voice warned him.
Natasha would be devastated if Tony declined. The only way anyone was prying her apart from Bucky now was with a crowbar.
Lowering the phone from his ear, Tony stared down at it. It was bothering him that Natasha hadn’t acted like herself.
“Okay, out with it.” Darcy narrowed suspicious eyes at him. “You’re being way too quiet. Something is up with you.”
Steve was already a lot taller than him, and their height difference was only emphasized further by the fact that Steve was standing while Tony was sitting. The alpha looked positively gigantic. And every bit as tempting as usual.
His stomach instantly rebelled, souring like he was going to be sick. The world turned red and a near psychotic jealousy clouded his vision.
Tony would’ve protested that comment—it’d sounded a little too much like ownership not to set off his alarm bells—but Steve had swooped in and slammed his mouth over Tony’s, kissing the daylights out of him. Tony had quickly forgotten why he’d wanted to object.
When was he going to learn?
“Want me to call you?” Steve suggested.
He imagined Steve’s knot swelling inside him. How incredible it’d feel to have that big, hard cock locking them together, Steve pinning Tony down until he could never get away.
“I had a great time tonight,” Steve said, his hands in the pockets of the jacket Tony had just returned to him. “Do I get to take you out again?”
Their tongues met in a hot, wet caress, stoking the fire under Tony’s skin into a frenzy. The alpha tasted so good it was making him lightheaded. He could smell the faint trace of chlorine on Steve’s skin from the pool. Tony shivered, a moan breaking free from his throat.
particular alpha. Something unique to him and no other.
“Hey, babe, you’re up.” Steve lifted his head from over a frying pan of sizzling bacon, like it was perfectly natural for him to be making himself at home in Tony’s kitchen.
He was drowning in Steve’s heartbeat. It was louder than his own, resounding in his head from the fast, rushing pulse in Steve’s wrist.
“Alright...if you’re sure...Tell you what, I’ll write you a prescription anyway, just in case you change your mind.”
“Since when?”
He struggled, and he flailed, and he took multiple swings at Brock, but it all happened too fast. The beta still managed to wrangle him into his arms.
“You can’t promise that.”
“I’m not freaking out,” he said, awed. “Holy shit. I’m not freaking out.”
It was absolutely time for drastic measures. He had to do this. For Nat. And for himself. Even if the notion of doing something for himself was more foreign than it should’ve been.
“I need a minute,” Steve said, from still within the pool. His voice sounded strangled.
“Well,” the beta mother sniffed dismissively as she helped her sobbing offspring off the ground. “It’s no wonder my Emmaline got confused. This child has a completely inappropriate haircut for a young boy. You should take him to the barber and get a nice, clean, masculine cut. And take that…” she pointed to his mermaid crown like it personally offended her, “…that
Tony’s heart upticked at the thought of the alpha touching him. It was a bad idea that would surely end disastrously for him, but he found he couldn’t say no. Swallowing, he nodded his permission.
The teen considered him ‘phone status’ worthy. Tony had never been that for someone before.
“...I wouldn’t say I ‘hated’ it,” he mumbled uncomfortably. He couldn’t let Steve think he’d done something wrong or that Tony had been an unwilling participant, because that wasn’t the case. “It just...can’t happen again. That’s all.”
“Blow me,” Tony joked with no real malice.
“Uh.” Steve’s large body shifted in place, his eyes widening. “That’s not what I meant.”
“Is that your workshop?” Steve’s eyes continued to follow him.
Because that was all that would ever be between him and the alpha.
thankful. Having Steve in his corner was…well, it meant a lot. Too much, actually. So much that it made his damn heart pitter patter like a bad simile. “Though I’m not sure how that would’ve worked, considering you were busy not being born yet and everything.”
Tony was hit with a vivid flash of Obie’s leather belt sliding out of the loops of his suit pants before he could block it out. His stomach churned and his entire soul seemed to recoil.
He’d implode if he didn’t. Cease to exist.
“Whatever you need, baby. We don’t do anything you don’t want to do. You set the pace and call the shots.”
Not needing to be told twice, Steve reached across the sofa and slid the warm, solid weight of his arm around Tony’s shoulders.
